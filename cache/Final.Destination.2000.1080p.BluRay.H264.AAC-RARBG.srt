2
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,792
Alex.

3
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:06,295
Tod and George's
dad just called.

4
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:08,206
He's picking you up
at 3:30 tomorrow.

5
00:03:08,373 --> 00:03:11,343
And the bus leaves the high
school for the airport around 5.

6
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:13,503
How's my suitcase
working out for you?

7
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,093
Whoa, Mom, Mom, Mom, you
gotta leave that on.

8
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:20,848
Yeah, it's like the tag made the last flight
without the plane crashing or anything.

9
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:24,857
So I figure it's gotta be on the
bag, or at least, with the bag.

10
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:27,358
For luck.

11
00:03:27,517 --> 00:03:30,191
Where would you get a
nutball idea like that?

12
00:03:30,353 --> 00:03:31,696
I'm still here.

13
00:03:36,526 --> 00:03:39,496
So 17, on the loose.

14
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:41,998
Senior trip with your
friends in Paris.

15
00:03:42,157 --> 00:03:44,876
Ten days in the springtime.

16
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:47,629
Live it up, Alex.

17
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:49,539
You got your whole
life ahead of you.

18
00:04:34,334 --> 00:04:36,302
Alex.

19
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:38,088
Alex.

20
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:57,865
The white zone...

21
00:04:58,024 --> 00:05:00,994
is for immediate loading and
unloading of passengers only.

22
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:02,745
No parking.

23
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:06,534
Yeah, I've been sitting
here for over an hour.

24
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,452
Where are you?

25
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:09,710
- Hey, Hitchcock.
- What?

26
00:05:09,869 --> 00:05:12,463
Let me give you a hand with this, man.
There you go.

27
00:05:12,622 --> 00:05:13,965
Carter, you dick.

28
00:05:14,124 --> 00:05:16,468
- Schmuck.
- Good one.

29
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:20,301
- You left this on the bus.
- Oh, thanks.

30
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:22,010
Come on, let's get
your stuff together.

31
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:24,972
Hey, Christa. Hi, Blake.

32
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:27,854
- What are you doing?
- He's the man. The man.

33
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:29,639
All right, you guys
got everything?

34
00:05:29,806 --> 00:05:31,900
Yeah, yeah. Dad, we're all set.

35
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:37,485
Does that mean go?

36
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,237
Don't know.

37
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,995
Look, this is for both of you, all right?
Have a great time.

38
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:45,155
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah.

39
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:46,493
- Both of us.
- Let's go.

40
00:05:46,656 --> 00:05:47,828
- Alex.
- Yes?

41
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:50,619
- You take care of them.
- I will.

42
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,343
You know, I didn't think anything could
look worse than my yearbook photo.

43
00:06:02,505 --> 00:06:05,304
How do you think I feel having
to look at you all the time?

44
00:06:14,017 --> 00:06:15,985
- What the fuck does he want?
- Shh.

45
00:06:21,232 --> 00:06:23,451
"The airport does not
endorse solicitors."

46
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:34,708
Death is not the end.

47
00:06:37,624 --> 00:06:40,047
It will be for you if
you harass my students.

48
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:43,717
- Hare Rama.
- Fuck off.

49
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:51,805
I have to ask you a few
questions this evening.

50
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:53,439
Did you pack your bags yourself?

51
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,603
Have your belongings remained in
your possession the entire time?

52
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:01,405
Mr. Browning?

53
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:04,492
Oh, yeah.

54
00:07:04,901 --> 00:07:07,905
Have you received any packages
from persons unknown to you?

55
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:23,678
- Same as your birthday.
- What?

56
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:26,761
September 25, 9:25.

57
00:07:27,549 --> 00:07:30,428
Your birthday's the same
as your departure time.

58
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:38,193
- Because I looked at him.
- Are you sure?

59
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:40,274
Lisa, wait up.

60
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:43,065
No, it's okay.

61
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:44,483
Fuck, that was good.

62
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:45,946
Dick.

63
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:48,111
- Hey.
- Hey, George, Dad said both.

64
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:50,622
Both of us, all right, man?
Just give me some cash.

65
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,078
Hey, hey, knock it off.

66
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:55,369
- Excuse me.
- Catch.

67
00:07:55,535 --> 00:07:57,412
You asshole.

68
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:10,350
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

69
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:41,586
Alex, let's go take a shit.

70
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:45,551
- Why don't you go by yourself?
- No, dude. Listen, okay?

71
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,007
Listen, take some knowledge.

72
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,093
We're about to board
a seven-hour flight.

73
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:52,555
The toilets in coach are barely
ventilated closets, all right, if that.

74
00:08:52,717 --> 00:08:56,267
Now, let's say halfway through the
flight, your body wants that food out.

75
00:08:56,429 --> 00:08:58,056
You gotta go torque
a wicked cable.

76
00:08:58,222 --> 00:09:02,693
And then right after you, like, directly
after you walks in Christa or Blake.

77
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:07,699
You want them to associate you with
that watery sting in their eye?

78
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:10,360
That reflexive gag at the
back of their throat?

79
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:25,212
John Denver.

80
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:33,058
Died in a plane crash.

81
00:09:33,216 --> 00:09:36,060
Ladies and gentlemen, thank
you for your patience.

82
00:09:36,219 --> 00:09:38,221
At this time, we would like
to begin preboarding...

83
00:09:38,388 --> 00:09:42,939
of Volée Air Flight 180
to Paris through Gate 46.

84
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,613
Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock?

85
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,202
How did we lose him?

86
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,458
Go. Go.

87
00:10:32,483 --> 00:10:34,485
Go. 
Ow.

88
00:10:34,652 --> 00:10:35,452
Ow.

89
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:36,654
That hurt.

90
00:10:51,794 --> 00:10:53,467
Oh, my little baby.

91
00:10:54,255 --> 00:10:56,257
That's a good sign. The
younger, the better.

92
00:10:56,424 --> 00:10:58,643
It'd be a fucked-up God
to take down this plane.

93
00:11:00,136 --> 00:11:01,262
Hi.

94
00:11:03,806 --> 00:11:05,808
A really fucked-up God.

95
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:07,894
Yeah.

96
00:11:08,895 --> 00:11:09,987
- Hi.
- Hey, Tod.

97
00:11:10,146 --> 00:11:13,070
Hello. How you doing?
I'm gonna sit here.

98
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:32,210
- Can you switch seats with Christa?
- Oh, God.

99
00:11:32,376 --> 00:11:35,004
You know, I would, but
I got a bladder thing.

100
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:38,801
It's a urinary tract infection.

101
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,472
Let's go ask Alex.

102
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:52,109
Alex, could you trade seats with Blake
so she and I could sit together?

103
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:55,696
She asked Tod, but he said he
had some sort of medical thing.

104
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,486
Please?

105
00:11:59,612 --> 00:12:01,239
Yeah.

106
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,417
You're so sweet.

107
00:12:05,576 --> 00:12:08,876
- Thanks, Alex.
- Thank you, Alex.

108
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:11,541
You're welcome, you're
welcome, you're welcome.

109
00:12:11,707 --> 00:12:13,880
Fag.

110
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:19,758
Did you really think we're gonna
titty fuck them over Greenland?

111
00:12:19,924 --> 00:12:25,522
You know, because of you, I gotta sit
here and watch fucking Stuart Little.

112
00:12:25,972 --> 00:12:27,440
Thank you.

113
00:12:27,598 --> 00:12:29,646
Thanks, man. That's great.

114
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:35,111
Sorry I'm late. That's
my seat right there.

115
00:12:36,065 --> 00:12:38,488
- Hello?
- I'm going that way.

116
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:40,653
May I have your attention?

117
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,620
To properly fasten your seat belts,
slide the flat portion into the buckle.

118
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:50,835
Equipped with six emergency exits: Two in
front, two over the wing, two in the rear.

119
00:12:50,997 --> 00:12:52,340
All exits are clearly marked.

120
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:55,627
Follow the red exit signs and
public lighting in the aisle way.

121
00:12:55,793 --> 00:12:58,512
Flight attendants,
prepare for departure.

122
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:45,431
- All right.
- All right, all right.

123
00:13:48,137 --> 00:13:49,434
Yeah.

124
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,397
Whatever.

125
00:14:00,983 --> 00:14:01,984
Huh?

126
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:08,162
It's okay.

127
00:14:11,786 --> 00:14:13,754
- I wanna go.
- It's fine.

128
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:23,844
It's okay, honey, I...

129
00:14:31,222 --> 00:14:32,223
What the...?

130
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:43,367
Oh, my God!

131
00:14:50,032 --> 00:14:51,204
Everybody...

132
00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:17,398
No! No!

133
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,317
Christa! No!

134
00:15:43,836 --> 00:15:47,761
Alex, could you trade seats with Blake
so she and I could sit together?

135
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:50,638
She asked Tod, but he said
he had some medical thing.

136
00:15:51,927 --> 00:15:53,053
Please?

137
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,936
What's up, dude?

138
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:07,118
- Is there a problem, sir?
- What's your problem?

139
00:16:07,276 --> 00:16:08,573
Alex, qu'est-ce que c'e-st?

140
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:11,865
- The fucking plane's gonna explode.
- Shut up, Browning.

141
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,284
- You're so not funny.
- If this is your joke...

142
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,077
it's not a joke.
It's not a joke.

143
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:18,712
- Alex, take it easy.
- That's it, sit down, Browning.

144
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:21,294
- It's going down.
- We will remove you.

145
00:16:21,457 --> 00:16:23,459
- I'll remove him.
- I'll remove myself.

146
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:24,969
- Excuse me.
- Get off him.

147
00:16:26,295 --> 00:16:28,798
- That's my seat right there.
- This plane is going down.

148
00:16:28,964 --> 00:16:31,217
Everybody in the
aisle, off the plane.

149
00:16:31,384 --> 00:16:33,227
- Get off the plane.
- Stay where you are.

150
00:16:33,386 --> 00:16:35,809
- Just sit tight.
- The fucking plane is going down.

151
00:16:37,223 --> 00:16:38,975
Go check him out.
See how he's doing.

152
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:40,267
Okay.

153
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:51,950
- I got my ticket here.
- Get off me.

154
00:16:53,322 --> 00:16:54,494
Jerk.

155
00:16:54,657 --> 00:16:56,079
- Hey.
- You got this?

156
00:16:56,492 --> 00:16:57,835
No one gets back on board.

157
00:16:57,993 --> 00:17:00,587
- That's my call.
- Wait, please.

158
00:17:00,746 --> 00:17:03,169
I've got 40 students going to Paris.
Please, please?

159
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:07,053
- Look, you must understand my position.
- I understand, and I apologize for Alex.

160
00:17:07,211 --> 00:17:09,088
But one of us needs
to be on that plane.

161
00:17:09,255 --> 00:17:11,508
I cannot let students go
to Paris for ten days...

162
00:17:11,674 --> 00:17:13,472
Carter, no.

163
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:15,352
- Sit the fuck down, Carter.
- Sit down.

164
00:17:15,511 --> 00:17:16,512
Sit.

165
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:19,057
One of you can go on the flight.
That's it.

166
00:17:19,223 --> 00:17:20,941
Larry.

167
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,689
Airline's not taking this well.
They'll let one of us back on.

168
00:17:25,855 --> 00:17:28,483
The rest can take an 11:10 flight.
It gets in three...

169
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:30,242
I'll stay.

170
00:17:30,401 --> 00:17:34,031
No, no, you know the whole French thing.
Get on the plane, it's fine.

171
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:36,790
Hi, Mr. Murnau. See, I
was in the bathroom.

172
00:17:36,949 --> 00:17:38,872
And the lock, it
was stuck, and...

173
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:40,877
Oh, wait, I didn't
fight with anyone.

174
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:44,040
Damn.

175
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,042
Thanks.

176
00:17:50,546 --> 00:17:53,641
I just... I called your parents.
They're on their way.

177
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:00,063
We should be going.

178
00:18:03,142 --> 00:18:05,691
Alex, talk to me. Tell
me what happened.

179
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:07,901
I saw it.

180
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:11,199
Like, I don't know. I saw it.
I saw it on the runway.

181
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:12,735
I saw it take off.

182
00:18:12,902 --> 00:18:14,154
I saw out my window.

183
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,664
- I saw the ground, and...
- Carter.

184
00:18:16,822 --> 00:18:20,247
The cabin, it starts to shake, right?
And the left side blows up.

185
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:22,252
And then the whole
plane just explodes.

186
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:25,919
And it was so real. Just like how
everything happens, you know?

187
00:18:26,081 --> 00:18:27,549
You been on planes that blew up?

188
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,176
You must have fallen asleep.

189
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:32,258
Whoa, we get thrown
off the plane.

190
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:34,264
We blow, what, a half
a day in Paris...

191
00:18:34,423 --> 00:18:36,846
all because Browning has
a bad fucking dream?

192
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:40,013
But wait, "The plane, it's gonna
blow up, it's gonna blow up."

193
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:42,056
- Hey, hey, fuck you, Horton.
- Tod.

194
00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:44,772
The only trip you're taking
is to the fucking hospital.

195
00:18:44,934 --> 00:18:46,356
- Get off him.
- Hey, hey.

196
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:48,567
- Alex, stop it.
- Come on, now.

197
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:54,577
There they go, here we stay.

198
00:18:57,488 --> 00:19:00,207
- You're paying for my trip.
- I wish you were on that plane.

199
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:02,789
- You fucking prick.
- Oh, shit!

200
00:19:11,293 --> 00:19:13,967
- Call it in.
- Security...

201
00:20:05,848 --> 00:20:08,226
You're looking at me
as if I caused this.

202
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:13,735
I didn't cause this.

203
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:18,782
Are there any survivors?

204
00:20:24,241 --> 00:20:25,868
How should I know?

205
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:31,628
- What, you think I'm some sort of...?
- He's not a witch.

206
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:41,638
Hello, I'm Howard Seigel, National
Transportation Safety Board.

207
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,555
We've contacted all your families.
They are on the way.

208
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:50,067
Is there anyone here who feels they might
need a little medical attention...

209
00:20:50,225 --> 00:20:52,444
or spiritual counseling
at this time?

210
00:20:52,603 --> 00:20:53,900
What's going on?

211
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:55,906
Are there any survivors?

212
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,745
Well, the cause for the explosion
is still undetermined.

213
00:21:00,903 --> 00:21:03,201
The Nassau County authorities
are on the scene.

214
00:21:03,364 --> 00:21:05,162
Naval Search and Rescue en route.
We...

215
00:21:06,492 --> 00:21:07,744
Excuse me.

216
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,878
I'm Agent Weine. This
is Agent Schreck.

217
00:21:10,245 --> 00:21:11,713
We're with the FBI.

218
00:21:11,872 --> 00:21:14,250
I understand now you all
must be feeling right now.

219
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,918
I know it's gonna be difficult.

220
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:18,713
We're gonna ask you questions
regarding today's events...

221
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:20,881
while they're still
fresh in your mind.

222
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:25,394
This will prove invaluable to our rescue
attempts and any criminal investigation.

223
00:21:29,598 --> 00:21:33,444
You said, "Listen to me. This
plane will explode on takeoff."

224
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:36,030
How did you know that?

225
00:21:36,397 --> 00:21:38,445
I got this feeling.

226
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,276
This weird feeling.

227
00:21:41,902 --> 00:21:44,325
Did you take any sedatives
before boarding the plane?

228
00:21:44,488 --> 00:21:47,367
Did you take any sleeping pills,
any narcotics, hallucinogens?

229
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:49,877
- Alex, do you take any drugs?
- No.

230
00:21:51,495 --> 00:21:53,293
I saw it.

231
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,130
I saw it happen.

232
00:21:57,543 --> 00:21:59,136
I saw the plane explode.

233
00:21:59,294 --> 00:22:01,843
Did the feelings have anything
to do with your saying...

234
00:22:02,005 --> 00:22:06,135
that you wished that Carter Horton was
on the plane just before it exploded?

235
00:22:07,469 --> 00:22:10,097
- No.
- Then why'd you say it?

236
00:22:11,265 --> 00:22:13,518
Because I really didn't
think it was gonna happen.

237
00:22:13,684 --> 00:22:18,315
If that's the case, Alex, then why
did you really get off the plane?

238
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:27,415
My brother, George, he told me
to go and keep an eye on Alex.

239
00:22:28,115 --> 00:22:32,461
And so he stayed, and...

240
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,754
He told me to get off the plane.

241
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:47,394
Larry Murnau said I should get back
on, but I told him that he should go.

242
00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:51,480
I sent him back on the plane.

243
00:22:54,057 --> 00:22:55,479
All right.

244
00:22:56,351 --> 00:22:58,604
Nobody forced you off the plane.

245
00:22:58,771 --> 00:23:01,866
You said you weren't friends
with those that were.

246
00:23:02,024 --> 00:23:04,277
So, Clear, why did you
get off the plane?

247
00:23:06,361 --> 00:23:09,410
Because I saw and I heard Alex.

248
00:23:13,744 --> 00:23:15,838
And I believed him.

249
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:30,515
Honey.

250
00:23:32,888 --> 00:23:34,390
Oh, God.

251
00:23:37,726 --> 00:23:39,319
There he is.

252
00:23:39,478 --> 00:23:41,071
Over here.

253
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:08,090
Thank you for the ride.

254
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:12,655
You're looking at the
first piece of debris...

255
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:15,324
to wash ashore from
Volée Air Flight 180...

256
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,494
which erupted shortly after a 9:25 p.m.
takeoff...

257
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,129
From John F. Kennedy
Airport in New York.

258
00:25:21,288 --> 00:25:23,211
There are no known survivors.

259
00:25:23,373 --> 00:25:26,092
However, Coast Guard and Naval
Search and Rescue efforts...

260
00:25:26,251 --> 00:25:31,132
are continuing at this moment even as
jet fuel burns on the ocean's surface.

261
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:33,892
Authorities are pessimistic
about the possibility...

262
00:25:34,051 --> 00:25:37,146
of finding anyone alive
from the ill-fated flight.

263
00:25:37,304 --> 00:25:41,184
All 287 passengers
are feared dead.

264
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:45,321
Amongst the travelers, a class of
40 students and four teachers...

265
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:48,198
from Mount Abraham High School
in southeast New York...

266
00:25:48,357 --> 00:25:50,530
en route to Paris
on a field trip.

267
00:25:50,943 --> 00:25:54,413
There are reports that several students
were removed from the aircraft...

268
00:25:54,571 --> 00:25:56,039
moments before departure.

269
00:25:56,198 --> 00:26:00,203
However, investigators remain guarded
about the specifics of this incident.

270
00:26:00,702 --> 00:26:03,626
Authorities from the National
Transportation and Safety Board...

271
00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:06,838
and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation have arrived at JFK...

272
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,378
to begin the initial
investigation.

273
00:26:09,544 --> 00:26:12,388
Eyewitnesses at the airport,
as well as on Long Island...

274
00:26:12,547 --> 00:26:15,096
report seeing the plane explode.

275
00:26:15,258 --> 00:26:17,932
No other aircraft were
visibly near Flight 180.

276
00:26:18,095 --> 00:26:20,894
At JFK, air traffic controllers
are corroborating...

277
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,729
these eyewitness accounts.

278
00:26:22,891 --> 00:26:28,694
After the explosion, debris apparently rained
into the Atlantic Ocean for several miles.

279
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:32,450
However, investigators are cautious
about verifying these accounts...

280
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:37,911
believing they'll learn more from the
found debris when daylight arrives.

281
00:26:55,298 --> 00:26:57,596
Thirty-nine days have passed...

282
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:02,936
since we lost our 39 loved
ones, friends and teachers.

283
00:27:03,265 --> 00:27:07,771
As each day passes without a
determining cause for the accident...

284
00:27:07,936 --> 00:27:10,940
we ask ourselves, "Why?"

285
00:27:11,523 --> 00:27:14,072
Ecclesiastes tells us:

286
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:20,287
"Man no more knows his own time than
fish taken in the fatal net..."

287
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:22,952
or birds trapped in the snare.

288
00:27:23,118 --> 00:27:29,296
"Like these, the children of men caught
when the time falls suddenly upon them."

289
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:32,503
And so, before we can heal...

290
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:37,140
before we can escape the
presence of death and time...

291
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:42,430
we must mourn and celebrate
theirs with this memorial.

292
00:28:26,765 --> 00:28:29,689
I hope you don't think because
my name ain't up on this wall...

293
00:28:29,851 --> 00:28:31,524
that I owe you anything.

294
00:28:32,354 --> 00:28:33,401
I don't.

295
00:28:33,563 --> 00:28:35,281
Because all I owe
are these people.

296
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,033
To live my life to the fullest.

297
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:40,328
Why don't you stay off the
J.D., then, huh, Carter?

298
00:28:40,487 --> 00:28:43,411
Listen. Don't you ever fucking
tell me what to do, all right?

299
00:28:43,573 --> 00:28:44,870
I control my life, not you.

300
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:46,535
Carter.

301
00:28:48,995 --> 00:28:50,918
I'm never gonna die.

302
00:28:59,214 --> 00:29:00,761
Hey, Alex.

303
00:29:00,924 --> 00:29:02,892
- Hey.
- Hey.

304
00:29:03,385 --> 00:29:06,013
I took my driver's test
last week at the DMV.

305
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:09,058
Got a 70. it's the lowest score
you can get, but I passed.

306
00:29:09,474 --> 00:29:11,226
When I was done with the test...

307
00:29:11,393 --> 00:29:13,361
You know the guy that
drives with you?

308
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,817
- Right.
- Yeah, well, anyways.

309
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:19,486
He goes, "Young man, you're
gonna die at a very young age."

310
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:21,653
Yeah. Yeah.

311
00:29:22,737 --> 00:29:23,989
Is that true?

312
00:29:24,781 --> 00:29:27,159
Not now, not here,
not ever, Billy.

313
00:29:30,579 --> 00:29:33,298
If I ask out Cynthia
Paster, will she say no?

314
00:29:33,456 --> 00:29:35,049
Fuck.

315
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,255
- Okay.
- Yeah.

316
00:29:36,418 --> 00:29:37,886
Yeah.

317
00:29:45,594 --> 00:29:47,062
- Miss Lewton...
- Don't talk to me.

318
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,188
You scare the hell out of me.

319
00:29:50,807 --> 00:29:52,309
I'm gonna go up.

320
00:30:00,358 --> 00:30:01,701
Hey.

321
00:30:02,444 --> 00:30:03,946
Hey.

322
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,282
I don't want you to take
this the wrong way.

323
00:30:07,449 --> 00:30:10,498
But I miss you, you know?

324
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,957
Yeah.

325
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:14,289
Yeah, I miss you too.

326
00:30:14,664 --> 00:30:17,213
But my father, you know,
he doesn't understand.

327
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:18,752
Yeah.

328
00:30:20,378 --> 00:30:22,722
Hey, look, when he gets
over this thing...

329
00:30:22,881 --> 00:30:25,976
you and me, little road
trip to the city, you know?

330
00:30:26,134 --> 00:30:27,807
Catch the Yanks.

331
00:30:27,969 --> 00:30:31,064
Yeah. Yeah, all
right, we'll do that.

332
00:30:31,389 --> 00:30:32,641
Cool.

333
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:36,903
- Look, I'd better go.
- Yeah.

334
00:30:37,062 --> 00:30:40,692
This thing Miss Lewton showed me in
class, they're gonna let me read it.

335
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,948
It says what I'm feeling.

336
00:30:45,654 --> 00:30:47,327
Take care, man.

337
00:30:56,831 --> 00:30:59,505
Because of you, I'm still alive.

338
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,012
Thank you.

339
00:31:10,512 --> 00:31:14,107
"We say that the hour of
death cannot be forecast."

340
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,982
But when we say this, we imagine
that the hour is placed...

341
00:31:21,147 --> 00:31:24,697
in an obscure and
distant future.

342
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:28,204
It never occurs to us that
it has any connection...

343
00:31:28,363 --> 00:31:30,866
with the day already begun.

344
00:31:31,032 --> 00:31:34,832
Or that death could arrive
this same afternoon.

345
00:31:35,287 --> 00:31:39,167
This afternoon, which
is so certain...

346
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:44,388
"...and which has every
hour filled in advance."

347
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,768
What happened?

348
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:32,935
Where's Tod?

349
00:37:35,188 --> 00:37:37,031
Alex.

350
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:39,908
Get out of here.

351
00:37:54,582 --> 00:37:57,051
- Didn't you see it?
- What happened?

352
00:37:57,543 --> 00:38:03,425
You caused Tod so much guilt over George
staying on the plane, he took his own life.

353
00:38:04,092 --> 00:38:05,844
- No.
- Time to go.

354
00:38:08,096 --> 00:38:10,849
Look, he wouldn't do that.

355
00:38:11,015 --> 00:38:13,939
Okay? He said to me we'd be friends
again after you got better.

356
00:38:14,352 --> 00:38:18,027
Why would he make plans with me if he
was thinking about killing himself?

357
00:38:18,189 --> 00:38:19,532
Mr. Waggner.

358
00:38:21,984 --> 00:38:23,281
- Mr. Waggner.
- Here we go.

359
00:38:23,444 --> 00:38:25,117
Easy.

360
00:38:25,863 --> 00:38:27,490
All right.

361
00:38:28,241 --> 00:38:29,993
Here we go.

362
00:38:45,717 --> 00:38:47,560
Let's go.

363
00:39:17,457 --> 00:39:18,674
Almost autumn.

364
00:39:20,001 --> 00:39:21,548
It's only the end of June.

365
00:39:23,713 --> 00:39:26,091
Yeah, but everything's
always in transition.

366
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,150
If you focus even now,
just one week into summer...

367
00:39:28,176 --> 00:39:30,679
you can feel almost
feel autumn coming.

368
00:39:30,845 --> 00:39:33,189
Kind of like being able
to see the future.

369
00:39:34,557 --> 00:39:36,651
Why were you at Tod's
house last night?

370
00:39:39,854 --> 00:39:44,030
I've seen enough TV to know that the
FBI doesn't investigate teen suicides.

371
00:39:44,192 --> 00:39:46,695
They were there last night.
They don't have a clue...

372
00:39:46,861 --> 00:39:48,238
what caused the crash.

373
00:39:48,404 --> 00:39:49,872
They haven't ruled out anything.

374
00:39:50,031 --> 00:39:53,331
The fact that seven people got off
the plane is probably weird enough.

375
00:39:53,493 --> 00:39:57,088
Not to mention that one of those
people had a vision, or whatever...

376
00:39:57,246 --> 00:40:01,376
of the plane exploding minutes before
it did explode, is highly suspicious.

377
00:40:01,542 --> 00:40:05,046
And it doesn't help that the visionary's
friend just committed suicide.

378
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:08,508
Why were you there last night?

379
00:40:14,555 --> 00:40:16,853
Do you know what this is?

380
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,529
This is a...

381
00:40:23,898 --> 00:40:26,196
Who's the spring-head guy?

382
00:40:26,651 --> 00:40:28,745
It's you.

383
00:40:28,903 --> 00:40:31,372
Not a likeness.

384
00:40:31,531 --> 00:40:36,037
It's how you make me feel, Alex.

385
00:40:36,202 --> 00:40:37,920
I'm sorry.

386
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:43,131
You know, like you, the sculpture
doesn't even know what, or why, it is.

387
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:45,465
It's reluctant to take form.

388
00:40:45,628 --> 00:40:51,226
And yet, creating an absolute but
incomprehensible attraction.

389
00:40:53,469 --> 00:40:56,689
In four years of high school, we
haven't said one word to each other.

390
00:40:56,848 --> 00:41:00,318
At that moment on the plane,
I felt what you felt.

391
00:41:00,476 --> 00:41:02,604
I didn't know where those
emotions were from...

392
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:05,023
until you started freaking out.

393
00:41:05,857 --> 00:41:09,953
I didn't see what you
saw, but I felt it.

394
00:41:10,736 --> 00:41:12,784
You can still feel
it, can't you?

395
00:41:13,322 --> 00:41:16,747
Something from that day
is still with you.

396
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:21,498
I know because I can
still feel you.

397
00:41:23,624 --> 00:41:26,298
That's why I was
there last night.

398
00:41:28,337 --> 00:41:31,261
You know, I've never
dealt with death before.

399
00:41:31,716 --> 00:41:34,765
This could all be in our head.

400
00:41:35,636 --> 00:41:37,855
It just feels like
it's all around us.

401
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:40,141
It?

402
00:41:42,435 --> 00:41:45,279
What if Tod was just the first?

403
00:41:46,188 --> 00:41:47,314
Of us?

404
00:41:47,815 --> 00:41:49,658
Is that something
that you're feeling?

405
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:54,330
I don't know, you know.
I just wish I could see him again.

406
00:41:54,697 --> 00:41:56,244
One last time.

407
00:41:56,407 --> 00:41:58,830
So maybe I would know.

408
00:41:59,452 --> 00:42:00,795
Then let's go see him.

409
00:42:31,692 --> 00:42:33,365
Easy.

410
00:42:35,696 --> 00:42:37,949
Gives me a rush.

411
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,418
This place?

412
00:42:42,036 --> 00:42:44,630
Doing something I'm
not supposed to.

413
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,002
Come on.

414
00:42:53,422 --> 00:42:55,174
Hurry up.

415
00:43:09,271 --> 00:43:12,366
- Is that him?
- I think.

416
00:43:12,525 --> 00:43:14,903
Why did they make him up
like Michael Jackson?

417
00:43:15,736 --> 00:43:17,613
Yeah, that's him.

418
00:43:18,447 --> 00:43:21,747
But whatever it was that made
him Tod is definitely gone.

419
00:43:24,829 --> 00:43:25,876
Christ.

420
00:43:26,664 --> 00:43:28,712
Shh.

421
00:43:28,874 --> 00:43:30,626
Please.

422
00:43:31,252 --> 00:43:33,425
You'll wake the dead.

423
00:43:44,181 --> 00:43:45,353
Why did his hand do that?

424
00:43:45,516 --> 00:43:51,194
Chemicals in the vascular flush
create cadaveric spasms.

425
00:43:51,522 --> 00:43:53,650
Look, um...

426
00:43:53,816 --> 00:43:56,535
- I'm his friend and...
- I know who you are.

427
00:43:58,279 --> 00:43:59,997
What are all those tiny marks?

428
00:44:00,781 --> 00:44:03,785
Cuticle lacerations from
pulling at the wire.

429
00:44:03,951 --> 00:44:05,919
Pulling at the wire?

430
00:44:06,078 --> 00:44:09,002
If he was pulling at the wire, he
wasn't trying to kill himself.

431
00:44:09,165 --> 00:44:13,170
- It was an accident.
- In death, there are no accidents.

432
00:44:13,335 --> 00:44:16,305
No coincidences. No mishaps.

433
00:44:16,464 --> 00:44:18,808
And no escapes.

434
00:44:20,259 --> 00:44:25,891
What you have to realize is that we're all
just a mouse that a cat has by the tail.

435
00:44:26,432 --> 00:44:30,812
Every single move we make, from
the mundane to the monumental...

436
00:44:30,978 --> 00:44:33,902
the red light that
we stop at or run...

437
00:44:34,065 --> 00:44:36,659
the people we have sex
with, or won't with us...

438
00:44:36,817 --> 00:44:40,117
the airplanes that we
ride, or walk out of...

439
00:44:40,696 --> 00:44:45,167
it's all part of death's sadistic
design leading to the grave.

440
00:44:46,452 --> 00:44:48,375
Design?

441
00:44:49,497 --> 00:44:53,923
Does that mean if you figure out
the design, you could cheat death?

442
00:44:54,293 --> 00:44:56,421
Alex.

443
00:44:56,587 --> 00:44:59,807
You've already done that
by walking off the plane.

444
00:44:59,965 --> 00:45:02,184
Your friend's departure shows...

445
00:45:02,343 --> 00:45:06,519
that death has a new
design for all of you.

446
00:45:06,931 --> 00:45:12,938
Now, you have to figure out how
and when it's coming back at you.

447
00:45:14,188 --> 00:45:15,656
Play your hunch, Alex.

448
00:45:16,065 --> 00:45:19,035
If you think you can
get away with it.

449
00:45:19,193 --> 00:45:24,199
But remember the risk
of cheating the plan...

450
00:45:24,365 --> 00:45:28,666
of disrespecting the design
could incite a fury...

451
00:45:28,828 --> 00:45:31,707
that could terrorize
even the Grim Reaper.

452
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:37,337
And you don't even wanna
fuck with that Mack Daddy.

453
00:45:41,966 --> 00:45:43,593
Okay, then, well...

454
00:45:44,218 --> 00:45:47,017
Yeah, I'm sorry we
broke in and...

455
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:49,853
No harm. No foul.

456
00:45:53,811 --> 00:45:55,404
I'll see you soon.

457
00:46:02,236 --> 00:46:04,739
The mortician said that
death has a design.

458
00:46:04,905 --> 00:46:06,532
Okay.

459
00:46:07,741 --> 00:46:09,288
I'm talking about omens.

460
00:46:09,743 --> 00:46:13,589
How do we know that just by sitting
here, by sipping this coffee...

461
00:46:13,747 --> 00:46:16,341
or breathing the air or
crossing the intersection...

462
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:21,131
that we haven't started in motion the
events that will lead to our death...

463
00:46:21,297 --> 00:46:23,595
40 years from now, 10
years from now, tomorrow?

464
00:46:25,259 --> 00:46:28,354
We don't unless we
open ourselves up...

465
00:46:28,512 --> 00:46:32,016
to the signs it's
willing to show us.

466
00:46:35,269 --> 00:46:36,395
I don't understand.

467
00:46:36,562 --> 00:46:39,361
Did you see Tod die?

468
00:46:39,523 --> 00:46:42,367
Did it happen again,
like on the plane?

469
00:46:42,526 --> 00:46:45,951
No, no, it didn't, but I
mean, it might as well have.

470
00:46:46,655 --> 00:46:49,499
This is a message of
something, Clear.

471
00:46:49,658 --> 00:46:52,912
Or someone, hinting at a design.

472
00:46:53,078 --> 00:46:57,424
Total bullshit. I mean, you can find
death omens anywhere you want to.

473
00:46:57,583 --> 00:46:59,927
Coffee. Starts with a
C and ends with an E.

474
00:47:00,085 --> 00:47:03,259
So does the word choke. So, what,
we're gonna choke to death?

475
00:47:03,422 --> 00:47:04,674
I wanna hear you.

476
00:47:05,925 --> 00:47:08,269
We'll go nuts if you
start with this shit.

477
00:47:09,094 --> 00:47:12,598
The mortician said that
death has a design, right?

478
00:47:12,765 --> 00:47:18,317
Now, what if you, me, Tod, Carter,
Terry, Billy, Miss Lewton...

479
00:47:18,479 --> 00:47:20,527
messed up that design
for whatever reason?

480
00:47:20,689 --> 00:47:24,865
I saw death's plan,
then we cheated it.

481
00:47:25,069 --> 00:47:26,366
But what if it was our time?

482
00:47:26,528 --> 00:47:28,951
What if we were not meant
to get off that plane?

483
00:47:29,114 --> 00:47:32,459
What if it still is our time?

484
00:47:32,618 --> 00:47:36,088
If it is, then
it's not finished.

485
00:47:36,247 --> 00:47:40,468
And we will die now, not later.

486
00:47:40,626 --> 00:47:42,344
Unless...

487
00:47:42,503 --> 00:47:45,848
Unless we find the patterns
and cheat it again.

488
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:57,898
After hearing you,
I do believe...

489
00:47:59,436 --> 00:48:01,279
that Tod killed himself.

490
00:48:30,551 --> 00:48:32,804
Yeah, I'm fine. Whatever.

491
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:36,565
- You all right, man?
- Hey, baby, come on, not now.

492
00:48:36,724 --> 00:48:38,897
- Carter.
- Oh.

493
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:41,153
It looks like we have a
bit of a reunion here.

494
00:48:41,312 --> 00:48:43,406
- Let it go.
- When are you moving?

495
00:48:43,564 --> 00:48:44,690
A couple weeks.

496
00:48:44,857 --> 00:48:46,154
- That's too bad.
- You dick.

497
00:48:46,317 --> 00:48:48,570
- We're losing our favorite teacher.
- Baby, come on.

498
00:48:48,736 --> 00:48:51,239
Look, guys. There's something
I need to tell you, okay?

499
00:48:51,405 --> 00:48:53,908
- Alex.
- And you lived here your whole life? Yeah.

500
00:48:54,074 --> 00:48:56,577
And now she's gotta move
all because of Browning.

501
00:48:56,744 --> 00:48:59,748
Enough, both of you.

502
00:48:59,913 --> 00:49:01,881
They died and we lived.

503
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:04,419
Get over it.

504
00:49:04,585 --> 00:49:08,340
I will not let this plane crash be
the most important thing in my life.

505
00:49:10,007 --> 00:49:12,385
I'm moving on, Carter.

506
00:49:12,801 --> 00:49:14,769
And if you wanna
waste your life...

507
00:49:14,928 --> 00:49:18,273
beating the shit out of Alex
every time you see him...

508
00:49:18,432 --> 00:49:21,402
then you can just
drop fucking dead.

509
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:33,118
- Okay.
- You look like a smart shopper.

510
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,452
Well, thank you.

511
00:49:34,615 --> 00:49:37,494
Let's just say you were to see this
knife set in e department store.

512
00:49:37,659 --> 00:49:39,081
What do you think
you'd have to pay?

513
00:49:40,412 --> 00:49:42,212
Wow, that's a huge knife
set, but how many...?

514
00:49:47,878 --> 00:49:50,848
- Hello?
- Is Alex there?

515
00:49:51,006 --> 00:49:53,054
Oh, hi, Clear. Yeah,
just a minute.

516
00:49:54,385 --> 00:49:56,808
It's Clear again. You
wanna talk to her?

517
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:00,975
<i>The economy kept trading volume
below average today, and stocks...</i>

518
00:50:01,141 --> 00:50:03,735
Clear, he's in the shower.

519
00:50:03,894 --> 00:50:07,865
- Can I get him to call you back?
- Sure, bye.

520
00:50:08,607 --> 00:50:10,655
She's concerned about you.

521
00:50:10,818 --> 00:50:12,570
I'm concerned about you.

522
00:50:12,736 --> 00:50:14,363
Why won't you talk to her?

523
00:50:15,364 --> 00:50:16,581
Or me?

524
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:19,619
<i>Which could put a cloud
over both stocks and bonds.</i>

525
00:50:19,785 --> 00:50:22,334
Dad, you and Mom have
both been a big help.

526
00:50:22,496 --> 00:50:27,252
But there's something I need to
understand before I can talk to anyone.

527
00:50:27,418 --> 00:50:29,762
<i>The Dow down 75.</i>

528
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,049
<i>The National Transportation Safety
Board has a new theory tonight...</i>

529
00:50:33,215 --> 00:50:36,719
<i>on the possible cause of the
explosion of Volée Air Flight 180.</i>

530
00:50:36,885 --> 00:50:39,855
<i>Officials believe deterioration
of silicon insulation...</i>

531
00:50:40,013 --> 00:50:42,516
<i>on an electrical connector
to the scavenger pump...</i>

532
00:50:42,683 --> 00:50:44,435
<i>may have leaked
combustible fluids.</i>

533
00:50:44,601 --> 00:50:47,024
- <i>A spark in the fuel switch...</i>
- That's Tod's seat.

534
00:50:47,187 --> 00:50:51,112
<i>In the fuselage may have ignited the fuel
line and proceeded to the fuel pump...</i>

535
00:50:51,275 --> 00:50:54,620
<i>which would have set off the
catastrophic explosion.</i>

536
00:51:25,225 --> 00:51:27,068
The path of the explosion.

537
00:51:27,811 --> 00:51:31,861
Okay, the first was Tod.
Then it was Terry.

538
00:51:32,024 --> 00:51:34,527
They're dying in the order
they would have died.

539
00:51:34,693 --> 00:51:36,821
That's death's design.

540
00:51:37,529 --> 00:51:39,873
Miss Lewton's next.

541
00:51:41,658 --> 00:51:43,877
And whenever I can
fall asleep, I just...

542
00:51:44,036 --> 00:51:45,333
I see Terry Chaney.

543
00:51:46,413 --> 00:51:48,131
And in the day,
out of nowhere...

544
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:50,759
I hear the sound of my
own voice in my head...

545
00:51:50,918 --> 00:51:52,090
saying to Larry Murnau:

546
00:51:52,252 --> 00:51:55,882
"No, you know the whole French thing.
Get on the plane."

547
00:51:56,048 --> 00:51:58,676
Everything reminds
me of that day.

548
00:52:01,094 --> 00:52:02,812
Right, yeah.

549
00:52:02,971 --> 00:52:04,393
I'm hoping a change will help.

550
00:52:04,556 --> 00:52:10,279
It's just that I've lived
here my whole life, you know?

551
00:52:10,437 --> 00:52:13,236
And everywhere I looked
were great memories.

552
00:52:13,398 --> 00:52:15,947
And now all I see is Larry...

553
00:52:16,109 --> 00:52:20,330
and those kids, you know?

554
00:52:20,489 --> 00:52:24,744
Just looking out my own front yard
makes me feel nothing but fear.

555
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:33,961
Laura, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

556
00:52:34,127 --> 00:52:35,629
Right.

557
00:52:44,429 --> 00:52:47,103
Hi, this is Valerie Lewton.
I need Agent Schreck.

558
00:53:13,584 --> 00:53:15,632
What are you doing here?

559
00:53:15,794 --> 00:53:18,013
I was just...

560
00:53:18,171 --> 00:53:21,471
I was checking the air in the
tire to make sure it's safe.

561
00:53:21,633 --> 00:53:23,010
Get in the car.

562
00:53:34,813 --> 00:53:36,736
Put on your seat belt.

563
00:53:59,504 --> 00:54:05,102
I believe that Miss
Lewton is next.

564
00:54:06,136 --> 00:54:07,183
- Next?
- Yes.

565
00:54:09,097 --> 00:54:14,228
Yeah, next, because there's
this pattern that's occurring.

566
00:54:14,394 --> 00:54:17,694
Oh, right, a pattern, yeah.
You noticed that too, huh?

567
00:54:34,081 --> 00:54:36,254
Mom's favorite.

568
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,448
So, what about this
pattern, Alex?

569
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,735
Did you see it in another
one of your visions?

570
00:55:02,901 --> 00:55:05,120
Did you catch it
in some TV static?

571
00:55:07,781 --> 00:55:11,001
You know, I never asked for
what happened on the plane.

572
00:55:11,618 --> 00:55:15,748
You guys are gonna sit on your little chairs
and make fun of me. Whatever, it's fine.

573
00:55:15,914 --> 00:55:18,667
But I saved six lives
on that plane.

574
00:55:18,834 --> 00:55:22,555
Six lives, and everybody in my
entire school thinks I'm a freak.

575
00:55:23,296 --> 00:55:26,641
And I'm not... I'm not suffering
from post-traumatic stress.

576
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,100
I don't have a narcissistic
deity complex.

577
00:55:30,262 --> 00:55:33,357
I'm not going
Dahmer on you guys.

578
00:55:33,515 --> 00:55:34,687
This just is.

579
00:55:36,017 --> 00:55:38,145
There is a pattern for us all.

580
00:55:38,311 --> 00:55:41,030
There's a pattern for you,
there is a pattern for you.

581
00:55:41,189 --> 00:55:43,612
There's a design for everyone.
I don't know how yet.

582
00:55:43,775 --> 00:55:45,869
But I'm gonna break this one.

583
00:57:05,774 --> 00:57:08,027
Alex, you came to our
attention at first...

584
00:57:08,193 --> 00:57:11,242
because you were under suspicion
in this plane explosion.

585
00:57:11,404 --> 00:57:15,534
Now, I know you didn't
blow up the plane.

586
00:57:15,951 --> 00:57:20,957
And we were ready to move on, but then
the other survivors started to die.

587
00:57:21,122 --> 00:57:22,874
First, your friend Tod.

588
00:57:23,041 --> 00:57:25,464
Then Terry Chaney, while you
were there at the scene.

589
00:57:25,627 --> 00:57:28,346
And now tonight we pick you
up at Val Lewton's house.

590
00:57:28,505 --> 00:57:30,724
Alex, nobody has control
over life and death.

591
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:34,261
Unless they are taking
lives and causing death.

592
00:57:34,427 --> 00:57:37,226
Now, can you promise me that
no one else is going to die?

593
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,766
No, I can't.

594
00:57:39,933 --> 00:57:42,903
As long as I'm in here, it's
out of my control, I'm sorry.

595
00:57:48,859 --> 00:57:53,035
Okay, go ahead. Get out of here.

596
00:57:54,114 --> 00:57:55,866
Thank you.

597
00:58:04,124 --> 00:58:06,047
That kid gives me the creeps.

598
00:58:06,209 --> 00:58:08,462
What are we gonna do?
We got nothing to hold him.

599
00:58:08,628 --> 00:58:10,255
That's not what I'm
talking about.

600
00:58:10,422 --> 00:58:13,175
There were a couple
of moments there...

601
00:58:14,467 --> 00:58:16,185
where I almost believed him.

602
00:58:17,637 --> 00:58:20,231
Can I tell you something? Don't
take this the wrong way.

603
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:22,609
But sometimes, you
give me the creeps.

604
00:58:39,826 --> 00:58:42,454
You've gotta stop this. Stop
this, it's a stupid mug.

605
00:58:42,996 --> 00:58:45,840
You're out of here. Pretty
soon, you'll be gone.

606
00:58:45,999 --> 00:58:47,717
You'll be gone.

607
01:00:59,299 --> 01:01:01,142
Miss Lewton.

608
01:01:09,768 --> 01:01:11,395
Miss Lewton.

609
01:01:13,188 --> 01:01:15,316
Okay, all right, okay.

610
01:01:15,482 --> 01:01:17,484
Just stay still, okay?

611
01:01:25,825 --> 01:01:27,418
Oh, God. Ch, God. Miss Lewton.

612
01:01:42,842 --> 01:01:44,640
Hey, Alex.

613
01:02:05,115 --> 01:02:06,867
Dude.

614
01:02:09,035 --> 01:02:11,129
I don't know where he is.

615
01:02:11,287 --> 01:02:14,166
- He's not talking to me.
- Why?

616
01:02:14,374 --> 01:02:16,342
Because I didn't believe him.

617
01:02:16,501 --> 01:02:17,718
If he does contact you...

618
01:02:17,877 --> 01:02:21,381
I think it would be in the best interest
of your safety if you called us.

619
01:02:21,548 --> 01:02:24,301
Now, here's my card.

620
01:02:24,467 --> 01:02:25,969
Toll-free number.

621
01:02:30,056 --> 01:02:31,649
Interesting work.

622
01:02:43,278 --> 01:02:44,325
Carter, you dick.

623
01:03:01,421 --> 01:03:03,173
What are you doing?

624
01:03:05,758 --> 01:03:07,681
Terry's name should
be on this wall.

625
01:03:10,763 --> 01:03:12,606
Shit.

626
01:03:13,141 --> 01:03:15,769
Why'd you want us to meet
you here anyway, huh?

627
01:03:15,935 --> 01:03:19,439
Because they're watching
me, see if I go to Alex.

628
01:03:19,606 --> 01:03:21,529
That's why you're taking me.

629
01:03:21,691 --> 01:03:22,988
Why would I wanna see him?

630
01:03:24,235 --> 01:03:26,863
Because he knows which
one of us is next.

631
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:43,630
So drive the speed limit, okay?

632
01:03:43,796 --> 01:03:46,891
Oh, and don't pass on the right.

633
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:49,303
Billy, wait a minute here.
I'm getting a vision.

634
01:03:51,137 --> 01:03:52,684
You're the next one, man.

635
01:03:53,181 --> 01:03:54,603
Hey, man, why'd you say that?

636
01:03:54,766 --> 01:03:58,236
Because if you say another word,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

637
01:04:19,249 --> 01:04:21,343
He could be anywhere from
here to a mile down.

638
01:04:21,501 --> 01:04:24,220
So you guys drive down there,
we'll meet around the middle.

639
01:04:24,379 --> 01:04:26,347
It'll take half the time.

640
01:04:56,536 --> 01:04:58,630
Do you think they're
still up there?

641
01:05:00,707 --> 01:05:04,211
Somehow, Flight 180, are
they still in flight?

642
01:05:04,377 --> 01:05:07,472
Somewhere, are they safe?

643
01:05:10,675 --> 01:05:14,600
When I was a kid, like 6 or 7...

644
01:05:14,762 --> 01:05:17,390
I used to worry so much
about my parents dying.

645
01:05:18,057 --> 01:05:20,355
Lying awake at night
just worrying.

646
01:05:20,518 --> 01:05:22,816
Yeah, well, most
kids do, I guess.

647
01:05:23,396 --> 01:05:25,694
Most kids never have it happen.

648
01:05:30,737 --> 01:05:34,412
When I was 10, my dad went into
a 7-Eleven for cigarettes.

649
01:05:34,574 --> 01:05:37,077
I guess that he heard someone
say, "Don't turn around."

650
01:05:37,243 --> 01:05:40,588
So on reflex, or thinking it
was a friend joking, he did.

651
01:05:41,914 --> 01:05:43,541
And the guy blew his head off.

652
01:05:45,251 --> 01:05:47,094
Life became shit after that.

653
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,799
My mom just couldn't
deal anymore.

654
01:05:51,716 --> 01:05:53,184
She married this asshole...

655
01:05:53,343 --> 01:05:57,598
who my mom with my real dad would have
crossed the street to avoid this guy.

656
01:05:57,930 --> 01:06:01,776
He really didn't want a kid.
So my mom didn't either anymore.

657
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:07,866
If that was the design for
my father and my family...

658
01:06:08,024 --> 01:06:10,197
then fuck death.

659
01:06:11,277 --> 01:06:15,532
God, I have thought a lot
about that somewhere, Alex.

660
01:06:15,698 --> 01:06:19,373
It exists, that place. Where
my dad is still safe.

661
01:06:19,535 --> 01:06:23,711
Where he had a full pack of cigarettes
that night and just kept driving.

662
01:06:24,207 --> 01:06:26,630
Where me and my mom and my
dad are still together...

663
01:06:26,793 --> 01:06:29,797
and have no idea about
this life here.

664
01:06:31,964 --> 01:06:34,558
Where our friends are
still in the sky.

665
01:06:35,676 --> 01:06:38,725
Where everyone gets
a second chance.

666
01:06:39,847 --> 01:06:42,771
Alex, we can't give up.

667
01:06:47,146 --> 01:06:48,443
Look, I can't go home.

668
01:06:48,606 --> 01:06:51,655
All right? After Miss Lewton,
they're gonna be looking for me.

669
01:06:51,818 --> 01:06:53,661
No, we're taking you
to my dad's cabin.

670
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:55,493
It's only a couple
miles from my house.

671
01:06:55,655 --> 01:06:58,659
All right, Browning,
you fucking Warlock.

672
01:06:58,825 --> 01:07:03,046
- Did you know about Miss Lewton, or what?
- Why do you think I was hiding?

673
01:07:03,204 --> 01:07:06,208
Billy told the FBI he saw
you running from her house.

674
01:07:06,374 --> 01:07:08,092
I was running because
they blame me.

675
01:07:08,251 --> 01:07:11,380
They blame me for Tod, they blame
me for her, for the plane crash.

676
01:07:11,546 --> 01:07:15,892
The fire, like, caramelized her blood,
Alex. Your shoe prints were in it.

677
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:19,145
- Your fingerprints were on the knives.
- I told you they were not...

678
01:07:19,303 --> 01:07:23,900
I'm not talking about whether or not you
did it. Or even if you knew she was dead.

679
01:07:24,058 --> 01:07:27,107
Did you know she was gonna
be next before she was?

680
01:07:33,693 --> 01:07:35,161
Yeah, I did.

681
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:39,494
- I knew.
- All right.

682
01:07:39,991 --> 01:07:43,461
Out of us, who's next to see it?

683
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:47,544
Please, tell me I'm gonna get to
see the Jets win a Super Bowl.

684
01:07:48,249 --> 01:07:51,002
It's me, right? That's
why you're not saying.

685
01:07:53,171 --> 01:07:56,425
I knew I should have felt up
Tammy in the pool that time.

686
01:07:56,591 --> 01:08:01,392
- What are you whining about? I'm next.
- He didn't say anything. Just drive.

687
01:08:02,513 --> 01:08:04,356
You have a responsibility
to tell me.

688
01:08:04,515 --> 01:08:07,064
Do you think it's gonna make
it easier to know, Carter?

689
01:08:08,478 --> 01:08:11,402
Huh? It's not, it's gonna
make it fucking harder.

690
01:08:11,981 --> 01:08:14,575
You know, you get off
having control over me.

691
01:08:14,734 --> 01:08:18,955
- You let me decide how to deal with it.
- It doesn't matter who's next.

692
01:08:19,197 --> 01:08:21,746
Because we're all on the same list.
All of us.

693
01:08:23,493 --> 01:08:26,918
Oh, fuck. Really?

694
01:08:34,003 --> 01:08:36,756
All right, then why bother?
What's the fucking point, right?

695
01:08:36,923 --> 01:08:40,598
Me and Terry, we'll be back together on
the other side, so why wait any longer?

696
01:08:42,345 --> 01:08:43,688
Carter, what are you doing?

697
01:08:46,182 --> 01:08:47,650
Carter, slow down.

698
01:08:47,808 --> 01:08:49,936
- Slow down, Carter!
- Fuck you.

699
01:08:52,438 --> 01:08:55,442
- Knock it off.
- May as well go out on my own free will.

700
01:08:55,608 --> 01:08:57,110
Not with us in the fucking car.

701
01:09:04,283 --> 01:09:05,785
- Jesus, Carter, no.
- Stop it.

702
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:08,245
Carter, stop the car.

703
01:09:08,412 --> 01:09:10,460
Hey, what's the worry
if it ain't your time?

704
01:09:10,623 --> 01:09:13,297
I could get nailed and you all
wouldn't give a shit, right?

705
01:09:13,459 --> 01:09:16,429
- It's only me.
- It doesn't work that way, Carter.

706
01:09:24,762 --> 01:09:27,140
And I fucking hated
French class.

707
01:09:28,558 --> 01:09:30,481
- Control yourself.
- That's what I'm doing.

708
01:09:30,643 --> 01:09:33,317
I know what you're doing. And
it's all right to be scared.

709
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:36,073
I'm not afraid, all right?
I decide when it's time.

710
01:09:36,232 --> 01:09:38,985
I control my life, I
control my death.

711
01:09:39,151 --> 01:09:41,745
You don't have to prove to us how
big your balls are. Not now.

712
01:09:45,491 --> 01:09:48,495
- Carter, stop driving like such an asshole.
- What are you doing?

713
01:09:50,496 --> 01:09:54,251
Fuck it, Carter, Jesus Christ. Carter,
put your hands back on the wheel.

714
01:09:54,417 --> 01:09:56,511
- Carter, stop.
- Hands on the wheel, Carter.

715
01:09:58,421 --> 01:09:59,673
Oh, shit.

716
01:10:02,425 --> 01:10:03,472
Okay, Carter, easy.

717
01:10:03,634 --> 01:10:06,433
I am so close to puking right
now, you don't even wanna know.

718
01:10:09,307 --> 01:10:11,810
We're afraid too, Carter, but
we're not going to quit.

719
01:10:11,976 --> 01:10:15,071
Stop what you're doing and
stop this fucking car.

720
01:10:15,396 --> 01:10:19,196
Damn it, Carter.
I want you to stop this car right now.

721
01:10:37,335 --> 01:10:38,712
- Billy.
- Move it.

722
01:10:38,878 --> 01:10:41,677
- Hey, open the door, Billy.
- Move the fucking car!

723
01:10:41,839 --> 01:10:44,718
- Hey, open the fucking door.
- Move the car.

724
01:10:44,884 --> 01:10:45,931
Open it.

725
01:10:46,093 --> 01:10:48,061
- Open the door.
- Easy, easy, open the door.

726
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:50,564
- Open the door.
- Billy, open the fucking door!

727
01:10:50,723 --> 01:10:52,566
- Billy, open it!
- Open the door!

728
01:10:52,725 --> 01:10:53,817
Open the door!

729
01:10:57,647 --> 01:11:00,571
Carter, listen to me.
Don't do this.

730
01:11:05,154 --> 01:11:08,624
Goddamn it! Get out
of the fucking car.

731
01:11:08,783 --> 01:11:11,377
Carter, listen to me.
Hey, listen to me.

732
01:11:11,535 --> 01:11:12,582
This isn't the way.

733
01:11:12,745 --> 01:11:14,543
It's not the way.
Get out of the car.

734
01:11:14,705 --> 01:11:16,503
- Come on!
- It's coming, it's coming!

735
01:11:20,086 --> 01:11:23,056
- Carter.
- It ain't my time.

736
01:11:34,225 --> 01:11:35,442
Oh, shit.

737
01:11:35,601 --> 01:11:38,901
Carter, listen to me. This isn't the way.
Get out of the car, Carter.

738
01:11:39,063 --> 01:11:41,612
Carter, get out of the car.

739
01:11:41,774 --> 01:11:44,368
Come on, get out!

740
01:11:51,909 --> 01:11:53,126
I can't get out!

741
01:11:55,121 --> 01:11:58,591
Alex! No!

742
01:12:04,797 --> 01:12:06,390
Man, he really is next.

743
01:12:08,384 --> 01:12:10,102
- Get out!
- Get out!

744
01:12:10,261 --> 01:12:11,808
- Come on!
- Fuck!

745
01:12:31,907 --> 01:12:33,534
Oh, God.

746
01:12:34,827 --> 01:12:37,250
I saw it. I saw the belt.

747
01:12:37,413 --> 01:12:39,666
- Scared now?
- It broke.

748
01:12:39,832 --> 01:12:42,631
Bullshit. He saved
your life again.

749
01:12:42,793 --> 01:12:44,010
That's right.

750
01:12:44,754 --> 01:12:48,179
You're next, Carter. I'm staying
the fuck away from you.

751
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:50,684
- Shut up.
- We don't need this shit right now.

752
01:12:50,843 --> 01:12:54,188
I don't need it ever. What are you doing?
Get away from him, he's next.

753
01:12:54,346 --> 01:12:56,019
Hey, fuck you, Billy.
I'm not dead.

754
01:12:56,182 --> 01:13:00,358
Oh, you will be. You're
dead, you're dead.

755
01:13:00,811 --> 01:13:03,189
And you ain't
taking me with you!

756
01:13:06,192 --> 01:13:08,945
Oh, shit. Ch, shit.

757
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,464
Jesus fucking Christ!

758
01:13:21,957 --> 01:13:24,836
You should've been next. You
should've been next after Lewton.

759
01:13:25,002 --> 01:13:26,800
That's the plan.
That's the design.

760
01:13:26,962 --> 01:13:29,181
- You should be dead.
- You're the fucking devil.

761
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:31,013
I saw the seat belt.
I knew it would rip.

762
01:13:32,384 --> 01:13:34,104
That's how I saved him.
Just like the plane.

763
01:13:34,261 --> 01:13:35,638
Just like the
explosion, I saw it.

764
01:13:35,805 --> 01:13:37,807
- The police are coming.
- Fuck, I saved him.

765
01:13:37,973 --> 01:13:39,020
Because I saved him...

766
01:13:39,183 --> 01:13:42,733
it skipped Carter, went to the next
in the path of the explosion, Billy.

767
01:13:42,895 --> 01:13:44,397
I have to see it.

768
01:13:44,563 --> 01:13:48,568
And if I see it, then I intervene. And
if I intervene, I cheat the design.

769
01:13:48,734 --> 01:13:51,203
What, intervene? What
are you, God now?

770
01:13:51,362 --> 01:13:53,364
Gods aren't afraid to die.

771
01:13:53,531 --> 01:13:55,875
Gods don't die. We do.

772
01:13:56,033 --> 01:13:57,910
- You know?
- Baby, you're losing it, okay?

773
01:13:58,077 --> 01:14:00,626
The police will be here.
We have to get you to my cabin.

774
01:14:00,788 --> 01:14:02,756
You can hide, and get
your head together.

775
01:14:02,915 --> 01:14:06,795
Okay, after Billy, I'm next.
I'm next.

776
01:14:07,586 --> 01:14:10,590
- And then me.
- Hey, hey, hey, listen.

777
01:14:10,756 --> 01:14:12,383
I'm not gonna let
it happen, okay?

778
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:14,848
- Listen to me, all right?
- Hey, hey, hey.

779
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:17,763
Why don't you two just get
the fuck out of here?

780
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:13,317
Rusted.

781
01:17:14,106 --> 01:17:15,779
Tetanus.

782
01:17:17,151 --> 01:17:18,744
Nice one.

783
01:17:20,112 --> 01:17:22,035
I overlooked it.

784
01:17:23,866 --> 01:17:28,793
You tried to capitalize. But
I caught you, you fuck.

785
01:17:29,705 --> 01:17:31,457
I can beat you.

786
01:17:31,999 --> 01:17:37,677
Yeah, I mean, not forever, but I got
this cabin rigged to beat you now!

787
01:18:29,223 --> 01:18:33,148
- She was there a minute ago.
- What are you talking about?

788
01:18:33,602 --> 01:18:35,696
I'm not turning him in.

789
01:18:36,105 --> 01:18:38,699
It's too dangerous for
him out there alone.

790
01:18:41,026 --> 01:18:44,326
- I go with you.
- You can't.

791
01:18:47,324 --> 01:18:49,247
Clear, you just tell
us where he is.

792
01:18:49,409 --> 01:18:51,036
Wait at home, I
give you my word...

793
01:18:51,203 --> 01:18:54,377
that we will bring him in
safely in protective custody.

794
01:19:24,278 --> 01:19:26,326
I never moved.

795
01:19:27,739 --> 01:19:30,083
Christa asked me to change
seats but I never moved.

796
01:19:30,242 --> 01:19:33,041
I would've been up next to Tod.

797
01:19:33,745 --> 01:19:35,793
Fuck, why didn't
I remember that?

798
01:19:35,956 --> 01:19:38,254
I never moved. Clear's
seat was in front of mine.

799
01:19:55,058 --> 01:19:56,435
She's next.

800
01:20:34,681 --> 01:20:36,479
Alex!

801
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:39,937
Alex!

802
01:20:40,479 --> 01:20:43,278
Come on, get in the car. We're
going around. Get in the car.

803
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:44,487
Come on!

804
01:20:44,650 --> 01:20:46,652
- Go!
- Move!

805
01:21:14,638 --> 01:21:16,732
Oh, shit.

806
01:21:51,717 --> 01:21:53,719
- There!
- Come on, let's go, over here.

807
01:21:58,682 --> 01:22:00,150
Alex!

808
01:22:00,309 --> 01:22:02,027
Alex, we're trying to help you.

809
01:22:04,813 --> 01:22:06,861
Fritz, get away from it.

810
01:22:19,578 --> 01:22:20,670
Come on.

811
01:22:24,583 --> 01:22:25,584
Alex!

812
01:22:51,568 --> 01:22:52,785
Run!

813
01:23:39,324 --> 01:23:40,371
We lost him.

814
01:23:40,534 --> 01:23:43,162
From the direction, there's
only one place he's heading.

815
01:23:43,328 --> 01:23:44,671
No shit.

816
01:25:12,834 --> 01:25:14,381
Clear!

817
01:25:27,599 --> 01:25:28,851
No.

818
01:25:34,064 --> 01:25:35,281
Oh, my God.

819
01:25:41,238 --> 01:25:43,366
Don't move. Stay there.

820
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:47,453
Don't move, don't move.
Don't touch anything.

821
01:25:47,619 --> 01:25:49,587
You're grounded by
the tires, okay?

822
01:26:19,234 --> 01:26:21,657
The car's gonna explode.

823
01:26:25,907 --> 01:26:28,330
I can only hold on for so
long, you know what to do.

824
01:26:28,493 --> 01:26:29,995
Don't!

825
01:26:30,161 --> 01:26:32,459
When I do this, it'll skip
you, and it'll be over.

826
01:26:32,622 --> 01:26:36,297
- It's the only way we can cheat death again.
- No, don't!

827
01:26:36,459 --> 01:26:40,009
Clear, I am not gonna let it beat us both.
You know what to do.

828
01:26:42,799 --> 01:26:44,972
I'll always be with you.

829
01:26:48,388 --> 01:26:49,435
NO!

830
01:26:53,518 --> 01:26:56,522
Alex!
Alex, get away from there.

831
01:26:57,606 --> 01:26:59,153
NO!

832
01:27:17,292 --> 01:27:19,670
Alex. Alex.

833
01:27:22,589 --> 01:27:25,513
Damn it, you can't
do this to me.

834
01:27:25,675 --> 01:27:28,053
Come on, baby. Come on.

835
01:27:28,219 --> 01:27:29,596
Alex, Alex?

836
01:27:29,763 --> 01:27:33,813
Alex, Alex? Oh, shit,
he's not breathing.

837
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:36,728
Hold on, Alex. Come
on, stay with me.

838
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:16,560
- Well, we made it.
- Paris, I can't believe it.

839
01:28:16,726 --> 01:28:18,774
I just can't believe we
got on a plane again.

840
01:28:18,937 --> 01:28:20,939
You know what I'm saying?

841
01:28:48,133 --> 01:28:49,225
Wow.

842
01:28:49,384 --> 01:28:51,136
It's weird being here, huh?

843
01:28:51,302 --> 01:28:53,646
We finally completed a puzzle.

844
01:28:55,223 --> 01:28:58,978
It's just there's something
missing, you know?

845
01:29:01,479 --> 01:29:03,072
- To Terry.
- Yeah.

846
01:29:03,231 --> 01:29:06,235
- To Tod.
- To all of our friends that can't be here.

847
01:29:06,401 --> 01:29:08,745
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

848
01:29:11,614 --> 01:29:12,661
What?

849
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:15,668
If you would have told
me six months ago...

850
01:29:15,827 --> 01:29:18,956
that the three of us would be
sitting here having a drink...

851
01:29:19,122 --> 01:29:20,248
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

852
01:29:20,415 --> 01:29:22,918
I mean, sometimes it just
feels like the two of you...

853
01:29:23,084 --> 01:29:25,678
are the only ones who
can really understand.

854
01:29:29,048 --> 01:29:33,599
You were right, Browning. It did skip us.
There was a design.

855
01:29:34,012 --> 01:29:36,265
We beat it. You know, we won.

856
01:29:37,348 --> 01:29:40,648
I think the only thing we won,
Carter, is a chance at a full life.

857
01:29:41,853 --> 01:29:44,572
A chance that I
won't ever waste.

858
01:29:44,981 --> 01:29:48,030
Yeah, there's just something...

859
01:29:48,193 --> 01:29:50,287
You know, something
I can't figure out.

860
01:29:50,445 --> 01:29:52,789
- What?
- About the design.

861
01:29:52,947 --> 01:29:55,746
Alex, just let it go. All right?

862
01:29:55,909 --> 01:29:58,162
"I swear" Just hear
me out, all right?

863
01:29:59,704 --> 01:30:01,923
- Oh, my God.
- It's just... Listen.

864
01:30:02,081 --> 01:30:06,507
Now, the path of the explosion determined
the order of our deaths, right?

865
01:30:06,669 --> 01:30:08,671
When I intervened
and saved Carter...

866
01:30:08,838 --> 01:30:12,342
it skipped him and went to the next
person in the path. It went to Billy.

867
01:30:12,509 --> 01:30:14,136
All right, and
then it was Clear.

868
01:30:14,594 --> 01:30:18,315
But I intervened and saved her, so
it went to me, but in my case...

869
01:30:18,473 --> 01:30:20,976
no one intervened, right?

870
01:30:21,142 --> 01:30:24,112
I was thrown from that power
line by the explosion.

871
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:27,023
- So...
- So why did it skip you, right?

872
01:30:27,190 --> 01:30:30,490
How do we know that this isn't
exactly what was meant to happen?

873
01:30:30,652 --> 01:30:34,498
That out of everyone on Flight 180,
you, me and Carter were meant to live.

874
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:38,038
Maybe that was the
design all along.

875
01:30:39,077 --> 01:30:41,580
- Or you could still be next.
- Shut up, Carter.

876
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:44,127
What? I didn't
make up the rules.

877
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:46,793
Somebody's gotta intervene
before death can skip them.

878
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:50,214
Alex proved that three times.
In the plane, with me, you.

879
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:53,554
For all I know, it could circle
back and get us all again.

880
01:30:53,716 --> 01:30:59,268
But I am the safest fucker in the
world because you're still next.

881
01:31:04,269 --> 01:31:06,021
Can we just stop
talking about this?

882
01:31:06,187 --> 01:31:08,440
Let's figure out what
we're gonna do tomorrow.

883
01:31:24,539 --> 01:31:26,291
I'm gonna meet you
back at the hotel.

884
01:31:26,457 --> 01:31:29,461
- Just wait, I'll go with you.
- No, just stay here.

885
01:31:29,627 --> 01:31:31,254
Okay, Clear?
Just stay here.

886
01:31:31,421 --> 01:31:32,513
All right?

887
01:31:32,672 --> 01:31:35,471
See, it's true.
I told you you were next, man.

888
01:31:35,633 --> 01:31:36,680
Stop it, Carter.

889
01:31:36,843 --> 01:31:39,312
- Alex, wait.
- No, Clear, stay there.

890
01:31:39,470 --> 01:31:42,314
Okay?
Stay away.

891
01:31:49,314 --> 01:31:50,361
Alex!

892
01:32:09,626 --> 01:32:10,673
Alex!

893
01:32:14,756 --> 01:32:15,973
I told you, you were next.

894
01:32:16,716 --> 01:32:19,344
- Then it just skipped me.
- So who's next?
