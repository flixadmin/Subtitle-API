00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:06,038
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,973
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

4
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:08,974
By something impossible.

5
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,176
Run, Barry, run!

6
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:13,045
My father went to prison
for her murder.

7
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:16,982
Then an accident made me
the impossible.

8
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:19,685
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

9
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:22,721
But secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime

10
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:24,290
And find others like me.

11
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:26,959
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

12
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:27,993
Mom!

13
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:29,395
And get justice for my father.

14
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:32,298
I am the Flash.

15
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,266
Previously on <i>the Flash...</i>

16
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:36,068
last night, on my way
to the morgue,

17
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,537
I saw something.

18
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,573
Taxi!
Oh, come on!

19
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:41,874
I'm gonna be late!

20
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,609
Simon Stagg, remember him?

21
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,477
Hasn't been seen
in, like, six months.

22
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,146
You're saying wells
knows where Stagg is.

23
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:48,781
No, I'm saying wells killed him.

24
00:00:48,783 --> 00:00:50,683
I have evidence in
a secure digital file

25
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:52,017
That will explain everything.

26
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:54,286
There is a tsunami
heading for the city.

27
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:55,988
You need to get as far
away from here as possible.

28
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:00,192
I have not been able
to stop thinking about you.

29
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:02,628
Go!

30
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:08,000
Aah!

31
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,724
No, no...

32
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:34,393
Taxi!
Taxi!

33
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:37,363
Oh, come on!
I'm gonna be late!

34
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:38,597
Oh, boy.

35
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,733
Hey, what's going on?

36
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:43,235
- Dude?
- Yeah, Cisco.

37
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:44,470
I'm... Here...

38
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:47,172
What happened?
Why'd you stop?

39
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,275
I just got
a little disoriented.

40
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:50,609
Well, you need to
make up some time, man.

41
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,344
You better hurry up.

42
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:53,612
Hurry?
What are you...

43
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,849
Hurry, as in
get to the morgue.

44
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:00,152
The morgue?
I was there.

45
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:02,321
Yesterday.

46
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:03,489
What are you talking about?

47
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,691
Come on, you gotta go.

48
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:28,080
Hey, Barr.
What's with all the water?

49
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:30,015
Did the sprinkler system
go off or something?

50
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,751
What? No, I checked
the sprinklers.

51
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,386
They're all intact.

52
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:36,622
But the water has ice in it.

53
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:38,490
And the bruises
on the coroner

54
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,858
Aren't just on his face.

55
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,661
Check...
look at his torso.

56
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,433
Whoa.

57
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:48,767
How the hell
did you know that?

58
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,769
He was killed by hail.

59
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,371
We have to listen
to the recording.

60
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:53,472
Recording?

61
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:54,640
Joe, we got something.

62
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:55,774
The coroner's office
just installed

63
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,643
An automated
dictation system.

64
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,111
Listen to this.

65
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,879
Please... No more...

66
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,648
I'll stop when you tell me...

67
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,916
just stop!

68
00:03:03,918 --> 00:03:04,917
Who killed him?

69
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,618
It's mark Mardon.

70
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,886
He wants revenge.

71
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:13,859
And I really don't wanna go.

72
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,227
He's your brother, Cisco.

73
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,562
Not by choice.

74
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,263
Okay, well, how bad can
a birthday party be?

75
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:21,667
Um, my folks think
Dante's stink don't stink.

76
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,669
Doesn't matter how much
he screws up,

77
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,004
Or how many times
he gets into trouble.

78
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:26,972
In their eyes,
he can do no wrong.

79
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:29,775
And yet, they never
fail to remind me

80
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:32,511
That I can do no right.

81
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:33,912
What if I came with you?

82
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,180
What?
Seriously?

83
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,749
Absolutely.
You've done so much for me.

84
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:39,084
Let me be there for you
for a change.

85
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,120
And I could look at
old family photo albums

86
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:42,721
And see what little Cisco
looks like

87
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,623
Without long hair.

88
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,026
I'm rescinding your invite.

89
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,595
Clyde Mardon has a brother?

90
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:52,598
So, both Mardon brothers
survived the plane crash

91
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,932
And then the dark matter
released

92
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,567
By the
particle accelerator explosion

93
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,002
Affects them both in...

94
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,337
virtually the same way.

95
00:03:58,339 --> 00:03:59,772
That's right.

96
00:03:59,774 --> 00:04:02,408
Only mark's not
like Clyde at all.

97
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,309
He can do things that

98
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,811
You couldn't even imagine.

99
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,012
You mean
he's sort of like a...

100
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:09,314
weather wizard?

101
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,183
Yeah.

102
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:13,218
Mm.

103
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,789
Trigeminal headache?

104
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,391
Mr. Allen.

105
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,894
A word please.

106
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:23,228
Yeah.

107
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,901
You ruptured the time continuum,
didn't you?

108
00:04:28,903 --> 00:04:30,936
You're experiencing
temporal reversion.

109
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:32,337
- Yeah!
- How long?

110
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,139
Uh, a day and some change.

111
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:35,741
It's like I'm living it
all over again.

112
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:37,042
Yeah, well that's good.
That means there's

113
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,877
Not too much you could've
messed up yet.

114
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,345
How did this happen?

115
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,747
I... I don't know.
I mean,

116
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:44,516
I was running faster than
I've ever ran,

117
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:45,684
And the first time
that I lived this day

118
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:46,819
Some really horrible
things happened.

119
00:04:46,821 --> 00:04:47,820
There was a tidal wave and...

120
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:49,455
No.
Do not tell me.

121
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:50,756
I do not want
to know anything

122
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,891
About the future
you experienced. Nothing!

123
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,093
Okay, but Dr. Wells,
I...

124
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:55,427
Barry.

125
00:04:55,429 --> 00:04:57,763
Time...

126
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:00,699
Is an extremely
fragile construct.

127
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,469
Any deviation,
no matter how small,

128
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,104
Could result in a cataclysm.

129
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:06,705
Now here's what
you're going to do.

130
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:10,109
Everything you did before.

131
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:11,110
Every word you uttered,

132
00:05:11,112 --> 00:05:12,945
Every step you took,

133
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:14,279
You're going to do again.

134
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:15,681
And you're not going
to tell anyone

135
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:19,051
This happened.

136
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,858
Good day, Dr. Wells.

137
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,726
Time will tell, Gideon.

138
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,428
Show me the future.

139
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,896
As you wish.

140
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:33,732
The future remains intact,
Dr. Wells.

141
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,467
If anything changes,

142
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,802
Alert me immediately.

143
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,904
Of course, doctor.

144
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,021
Hey.

145
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,222
Hey.

146
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,390
What's going on with you?

147
00:05:58,392 --> 00:05:59,691
How'd you figure
all that stuff out

148
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,826
At the morgue?

149
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,995
Lucky guesses, I guess.

150
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:04,696
Look, I'm telling you,

151
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,267
I'm gonna get Mardon
if it kills me.

152
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:12,538
Joe, um...

153
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,906
I gotta run an errand.

154
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:16,108
I'll see you later.
All right?

155
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,260
I didn't know there was
anyone else like me.

156
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,866
I'm gonna break out of here!

157
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:45,337
I'm gonna create a tidal wave
that destroys your entire city!

158
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,573
So, I still don't understand.

159
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:49,074
How did you find him?

160
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,009
I just had a hunch.

161
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:52,711
That's gotta be
some kind of record.

162
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:54,146
Yeah.

163
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:55,581
Well, there goes my excuse

164
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,617
For bailing on
my brother's birthday.

165
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:02,654
Do you have any idea
what you've just done?

166
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,189
Yeah, I do.

167
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,191
I just saved a lot of lives.

168
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:08,327
I warned you not to mess
with the timeline.

169
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:09,861
Dr. Wells, if you
would just let me

170
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,063
Tell you
what was gonna happen,

171
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,564
You'd understand
why I did this.

172
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:16,134
Whatever tragedy you think
you've just averted,

173
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,836
Time will find a way
to replace it

174
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,304
And trust me, Barry,

175
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:22,507
The next one
could be much worse.

176
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,021
Don Santini, they're here.

177
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,489
Move it.

178
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:47,833
Oh, love the paneling.
Mahogany?

179
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:50,202
So glad your house
is made out of wood.

180
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:52,704
It's gonna be a pleasure
watching it burn.

181
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:55,307
Aah!
Refreshing!

182
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,743
What are you doing back
in Central City, Snart?

183
00:07:57,745 --> 00:08:00,212
This is my city.

184
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:01,346
Our city.

185
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,048
I told you if I ever
saw you again

186
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,683
I'd put the hurt on you.

187
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:09,054
You stir up trouble.
Trouble is bad for business.

188
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:11,356
It's time for you
and your family to pack up.

189
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:15,327
Leave town.
Retire to warmer climates.

190
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,662
Finito.

191
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:17,963
And if we don't?

192
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,965
You will all freeze.

193
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,466
Or burn.

194
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,669
I heard about your guns.

195
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:26,071
I also heard that you lost them.

196
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:27,472
So, tell me, Snart.

197
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,441
What the hell are you and
your pyro friend

198
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:32,344
Gonna do without
your fancy weapons?

199
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,645
This.

200
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,960
Now that was fun!

201
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:52,497
Fun. Fun. Fun.

202
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,366
Go.

203
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,868
Tell the rest of
the Santini family

204
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,304
There's a new godfather.

205
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:02,040
And his name is Cold.

206
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,250
<i>- Hola.
- Coma esta.</i>

207
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,587
Wow.

208
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:17,956
Your parents really
went all out with the cake.

209
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,892
Oh, well... It is
Dante's birthday.

210
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,394
The most important day
of the year.

211
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,162
<i>Mi hijo</i> was invited to play
carnegie hall

212
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,664
When he was just
13 years old.

213
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,632
They invited the entire band,
mama.

214
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,368
That doesn't make it
any less worthwhile.

215
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,137
Hey.
What's up, man?

216
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,972
- Hey.
- Glad you could make it.

217
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,507
Of course.

218
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,476
Hi, I'm Dante.

219
00:09:37,478 --> 00:09:38,844
This is my friend, Caitlyn.

220
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:40,045
Hi, Caitlyn.

221
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:41,146
- Happy birthday, Dante.
- Thank you.

222
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:42,414
Here, I...
I got you this.

223
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,149
- Oh...
- I think you'll really like it.

224
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,917
- It's...
- thanks, man.

225
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,719
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

226
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,531
I don't get it.

227
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,466
I've been running
just as fast as I was

228
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:02,667
When it happened,
and nothing.

229
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,069
I'm still here.

230
00:10:04,071 --> 00:10:05,670
Any number of things could've
triggered the wormhole

231
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:07,339
That allows you
to repeat your day.

232
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:08,774
Your emotions,
your circumstances,

233
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:10,942
Your cortisol levels,
all of the above.

234
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,145
Well, I mean, my adrenaline
was super high

235
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:14,446
since Iris and
the entire city...

236
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,248
No, no, no.

237
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:16,982
No details.
I told you.

238
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,517
All right, I'm sorry,

239
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,085
But mark Mardon's
already locked in the pipeline

240
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,520
and nothing bad has happened.

241
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:22,521
Yet.

242
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,190
Detective.

243
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:27,292
Hey.
What are you doing here?

244
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,927
So when were you
planning on telling me

245
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,762
you took down Mardon?

246
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:33,031
I... I just haven't
had a chance yet.

247
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,199
You got sidetracked,
you mean?

248
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:35,801
No, Joe, you can't be mad.

249
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,035
I'm not mad.

250
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:38,303
But I am curious.
I mean,

251
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,139
you were acting so weird
at the crime scene.

252
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,607
I always act weird.

253
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,609
Okay.
Weirder.

254
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,114
Look, Joe, there are just

255
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:52,050
Some things that
I can't tell you,

256
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,372
And you're gonna
have to trust me.

257
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:58,990
Hey, Linda.
Yeah, I know.

258
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,992
I'm so sorry.
I... I lost track.

259
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,194
I'm gonna head that way now.

260
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:04,329
All right, bye.

261
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,597
I have a lunch date
with Linda.

262
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,600
I gotta run.

263
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:10,902
And I don't suppose you're
gonna fill me in either?

264
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:11,903
No.

265
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:12,904
Mm.

266
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,609
<i>Que Linda, Dante!</i>

267
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:20,745
Well, here is one
who was touched by god.

268
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,083
Ah, I was a little rusty.

269
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:26,618
I haven't played in a while.

270
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,019
Oh, well...

271
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,421
If that was what you
sounded like rusty,

272
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:30,455
I can't imagine what
you sound like

273
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:31,923
When you've practiced.

274
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,159
Oh, for you, I'd practice
morning, noon, and night.

275
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,560
That means you'd actually

276
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:38,497
Have to get up
in the morning.

277
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:40,098
So, mom tells me
you're still working

278
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,199
at S.T.A.R. Labs,
huh?

279
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,134
Yeah.
Why?

280
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:44,469
No reason, man.

281
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,471
Guess it was just hard
to find another job, huh?

282
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:47,839
Oh, I wasn't looking.

283
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,508
I actually like working
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

284
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,844
And we couldn't do what we do
without Cisco.

285
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,579
Oh, he's loyal.

286
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:57,282
Just like a dog.

287
00:11:57,284 --> 00:12:00,485
Oh, come on.
Why are you so serious, <i>mi hija?</i>

288
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,227
Happy birthday.

289
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,965
Hey! I am here.
So sorry, again.

290
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:19,638
Well, you get a pass
considering you're never late.

291
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,439
Hey, um...

292
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:24,009
What's going on
with you lately?

293
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:25,677
Nothing.

294
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,645
Come on.

295
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:29,681
Give me a little credit here.

296
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,087
I've just been dealing with

297
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,557
A lot of things lately.

298
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,959
I like you, Linda.
And we really get along.

299
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:44,696
Relationships should be more
than just getting along.

300
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:48,967
Your heart should
ache for me.

301
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,970
Does it?

302
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,746
You're not upset with me?

303
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:05,283
No one did anything wrong.

304
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,653
I really do feel
a lot for you, Linda.

305
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:09,888
It's just...

306
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,291
Just not as much as
you feel for someone else.

307
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,964
Go get her.

308
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,906
"The Flash, speeding his way
into our lives."

309
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:30,108
It's a little bit on
the nose, don't you think?

310
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,110
I have something to show you.

311
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:33,545
Simon Stagg, remember him?

312
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,547
Hasn't been heard from
in nearly a year.

313
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,416
Hey, Iris.
Mr. Bridge, hi.

314
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,551
Do I know you?

315
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:42,988
Oh, no, we haven't met yet...

316
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,589
Fully, you know, um...

317
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:46,391
Iris, can I talk to you
for a second?

318
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:47,759
Uh, yeah, sure.

319
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:49,427
- We'll catch up later.
- Yeah.

320
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:53,164
Nice meeting you,
strange young man.

321
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,100
Is everything okay
with you and Linda?

322
00:13:55,102 --> 00:13:59,604
Uh...
No, that's done.

323
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,206
Oh, I... I am
so sorry.

324
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,041
No, no, no, it's okay.
We're gonna be friends.

325
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,410
Um, yeah, no,
it's gonna be awesome.

326
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:08,513
Uh... Anyway,
are you...

327
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,781
Are you free tomorrow?

328
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:11,716
Do you want to
get some coffee

329
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,752
And we can just talk and just

330
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:15,387
Tell each other stuff...

331
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:16,888
I don't know, stuff we got

332
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,323
Rolling around
in there, you know?

333
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,457
I don't know.

334
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,725
O-okay, yeah, sure.

335
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:21,559
It sounds great.

336
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,228
Okay, great.
Great!

337
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,430
All right, I'll see you.

338
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,337
I know you think
Harrison Wells

339
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:33,405
Had something to do with

340
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:34,539
Simon Stagg's disappearance,

341
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,709
But you're wrong.

342
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,618
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, man.

343
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,186
Thanks for meeting me here.

344
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,221
Even though...
You can't get drunk.

345
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,590
No worries.

346
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:55,493
So, how was your day?

347
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,195
Great.
But...

348
00:14:57,197 --> 00:15:00,031
Linda and I did break up.

349
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,499
That's the first time
I ever heard anyone

350
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,802
Use the word "great"
to describe a break-up.

351
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:06,504
I have a feeling
that I'm about to

352
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,507
Move forward with someone
really special.

353
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:11,342
Okay.
Go ahead, Barry.

354
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:14,412
Hi.

355
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,281
I don't normally do this,

356
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:19,217
But I was
watching you, and...

357
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:22,387
Can I buy you a drink?

358
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,089
Uh... Wow.

359
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,891
I mean,
I'm really flattered, but I...

360
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,394
Actually, I was
talking to him.

361
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,329
Um...
I'm... I'm sorry,

362
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,031
You said... you said
you were talking to me?

363
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,899
Yeah, I just told
my friends over there

364
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,367
That I thought you were cute

365
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:37,369
And they dared me
to come over here

366
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,470
And talk to you, so...

367
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:41,973
Please talk to me.

368
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:45,210
Yeah. Yeah, I suppose
I can talk to you

369
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:47,312
For a little bit.

370
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:50,949
Yeah, no, I was just leaving.

371
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,350
Make me proud.

372
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:56,054
I'm Lisa, by the way.

373
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,522
Hi, Cisco.

374
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:00,658
I'm just in town for
this symposium at mercury labs.

375
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,427
Really? You...
what do you do?

376
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,729
Oh, I'm a
structural engineer.

377
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:06,231
Why do you look so surprised?

378
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:07,665
Can't a girl be an engineer?

379
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,868
No, of course.
That's...

380
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,637
You just don't look
like an engineer.

381
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,672
I can't help how I look.

382
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,341
I... I mean,
it's good.

383
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,143
It's a...
it's a good look.

384
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,778
It's a great look.

385
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:24,149
Well, you don't look
so bad yourself.

386
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:27,152
Am I being pranked right now?

387
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,630
What do you think?

388
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,400
I can't believe this.
The day started out

389
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:45,136
Pretty terrible, but now it's
turning out pretty damn good.

390
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,038
- I'll say.
- Wow.

391
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,239
Look at this.

392
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,574
These are nice things.

393
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,409
Oh, we're just squatting.

394
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,710
We?

395
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,646
Yeah.

396
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:56,948
Me and my brother.

397
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,518
Hello, Cisco.

398
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,022
What exactly are
your intentions with my sister?

399
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,490
Oh, come on.

400
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:06,491
I should've known better.

401
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,960
I am not that lucky.

402
00:17:08,962 --> 00:17:11,462
Please don't kill me
for kissing your sister.

403
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:12,497
You kissed him?

404
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:13,598
You're not dad, Lenny.

405
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,066
I know.
Dad's in jail.

406
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:17,001
Sterling role model.

407
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,303
What do you want, Snart?

408
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:22,173
Guns. Heat and cold,
to be precise.

409
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,976
There's no way I am
making weapons for you.

410
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:26,177
Never again.

411
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:29,581
Mick.

412
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:35,587
I know I would do
everything in my power

413
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:38,223
To protect my family.

414
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:41,226
The question is, will you?

415
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:02,814
Dante.

416
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:04,449
Dante, just keep cool, okay?

417
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:05,984
- Let me do my thing.
- Oh, really?

418
00:18:05,986 --> 00:18:07,385
And what?
You're gonna save us

419
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,720
With your mechanical engineering
skills?

420
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:10,054
Right now, my skills
are the only things

421
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,022
Keeping us alive,

422
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:12,323
So if I were you,
I would shut up.

423
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,558
You shut up!

424
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,295
Ah!
There she is.

425
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,931
I missed this baby.

426
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,902
Here it is. All finished.
You gonna let us go now?

427
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:26,104
You know, I took the
first gun you made me apart

428
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,438
Dozens of times.

429
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,606
Learned how it ticked.

430
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,609
What went where.

431
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,054
Thought you could tamper
with the firing pin

432
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,657
Without me noticing.

433
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:48,059
Nice try, kid.

434
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,098
- Yes.
- Lenny?

435
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,733
Where's my gun?

436
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:57,936
Girl's gotta defend herself.

437
00:18:57,938 --> 00:19:01,539
Besides, why should
you two have all the fun?

438
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,608
My sister needs a weapon.

439
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,877
Something that suits
her personality.

440
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:08,413
Make me something
pretty and toxic,

441
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,948
Like me.

442
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:14,552
How about something
with gold?

443
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:15,553
Gold.

444
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,430
- Hey!
- Hey.

445
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:26,731
One incredibly heavy cronut

446
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,900
And one Americano
with an extra shot.

447
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:30,401
- Just the way you like it.
- Just the way I like it.

448
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:31,869
Yeah, I know.

449
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,671
I know you, Iris.

450
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:39,944
So... What is
going on with you?

451
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:42,213
You're acting like
Christmas came early.

452
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,614
Uh...

453
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:47,885
Yeah, no, I guess
it did, kind of.

454
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:50,588
Look, Iris, um...

455
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,123
I still think about
you all the time

456
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,525
And I know you've been
thinking about me too,

457
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,195
So let's just stop thinking

458
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,062
And start doing.

459
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,364
- Barry...
- I know.

460
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,933
I know that we both
have awful timing,

461
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:03,067
But we were meant to be...

462
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:06,137
Barry, what are you
talking about?

463
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:08,172
You and me.

464
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:11,843
We like each other.

465
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:13,478
Barry, we've been over this.

466
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,546
Okay? Nothing has
changed for me.

467
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,182
No, but it has.

468
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:21,686
How do you know that?

469
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,721
I just...

470
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,958
I just know
some stuff somehow.

471
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,326
I don't know, maybe it's like

472
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:29,327
ESP or something, but...

473
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,795
Barry.

474
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:33,331
I love Eddie, okay?

475
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,733
I'm sorry, but nothing
has changed for me

476
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,068
Since Christmas.

477
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,404
And you can't keep
springing this on me.

478
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,872
Okay?
It's not fair

479
00:20:40,874 --> 00:20:41,973
That you keep
making me the bad guy

480
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:45,009
Who keeps telling you no.

481
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,187
What?
No whoosh-in?

482
00:20:56,189 --> 00:20:57,855
I needed the walk.

483
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,757
What happened?

484
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,292
Nothing, uh...

485
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:04,295
Linda... Iris...

486
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:07,365
I don't want to
talk about it, actually.

487
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:08,366
Okay.

488
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:10,802
Have you talked to Cisco?

489
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:12,036
I've been trying him
on his cell,

490
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,504
But he's not answering.

491
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,540
Kind of...
Worried about him.

492
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:16,908
He had a rough night.

493
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:19,210
Trust me, it got better.

494
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,549
Hey, Joe.
What's up?

495
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:26,651
Yeah, Snart's back.

496
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,486
Wait, Cold is back?

497
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,688
Yeah, he was spotted at the
Santini crime family casino.

498
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,657
If he's hitting the Santinis,
we could be looking at

499
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:36,160
The beginning of a mob war.

500
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:42,733
Well, this day just keeps
getting better, doesn't it?

501
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,881
You killed my brother.

502
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:59,117
You shouldn't have messed
with my family.

503
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:01,352
That's funny.

504
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:03,955
I was gonna say
the same thing about ours.

505
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,325
All that glitters...

506
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,204
This is sick.

507
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:22,306
Well, you wanted us
to spend more time together.

508
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:35,520
How many times are we
gonna go through this, Snart?

509
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:39,190
Until the best man wins!

510
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:42,760
Drop the gun!

511
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:47,098
We both know you're not
going to do anything to her.

512
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,735
Oh, by the way,
meet my baby sister.

513
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:54,238
Lisa, Flash.
Flash, Lisa.

514
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,775
Cisco has been very, very busy.

515
00:22:57,777 --> 00:22:59,143
Unless you want me to mail

516
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:03,014
Small, frozen pieces
of him back to his family,

517
00:23:03,016 --> 00:23:06,284
I'd take your hands off her.

518
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:15,660
Let him go, Snart.

519
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:18,396
I'll think about it.

520
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,184
Barr.

521
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:42,053
Witnesses reported
seeing the Flash.

522
00:23:42,055 --> 00:23:43,554
They said you had
Snart dead to rights

523
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:44,555
But you let him go?

524
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:45,756
Why?

525
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:46,958
Cisco.

526
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,626
Snart and his sister
have him.

527
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:49,760
Oh, man.

528
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,729
Okay.
Get to S.T.A.R. Labs.

529
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:53,297
I'll get there when I can.

530
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:56,500
All right.

531
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:57,535
Allen.

532
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:58,536
Yeah, Eddie, I...

533
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:00,438
Whoa.

534
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,305
Stay away from Iris.

535
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:02,740
What the hell is
going on here?

536
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:04,342
Hey, if you two have a beef,
you take it outside.

537
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:06,844
You know what
the worst part is, Barry?

538
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:10,047
I thought you and I
were friends.

539
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,489
So there's Cisco getting
into a car with Snart's sister.

540
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:22,193
And the license plate
is iced over.

541
00:24:22,195 --> 00:24:24,662
All right, Dr. Wells,
you were right.

542
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:26,731
I... I... I screwed with time and
now time is screwing with me.

543
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:29,300
Cold is back, he kidnapped
Cisco, and Iris is...

544
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:31,002
Stop right there before
you cause another disruption

545
00:24:31,004 --> 00:24:32,036
To the timeline.

546
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:35,039
Please, Dr. Wells.

547
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:39,110
Please, I have to
talk to someone.

548
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,782
Go ahead.

549
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:49,954
In the previous version
of today,

550
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:53,658
Captain Singh
is seriously injured,

551
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,092
Joe is in danger,

552
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:59,897
And Iris said she
had feelings for me.

553
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:01,365
And now Cisco's life
is on the line,

554
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:06,003
And Iris has no idea
she confessed those feelings.

555
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:10,007
But she still
has them, right?

556
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:14,478
The unconscious mind, Barry,

557
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,182
It...
it's a powerful thing.

558
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:22,820
It sounds like it took
this apparent disaster

559
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:25,623
To jar those feelings loose

560
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:28,159
And without a disaster,
those feelings

561
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:30,828
Remain deeper down.

562
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,663
Unaccessed.

563
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:34,865
I don't understand.

564
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,768
I thought that
I was helping people

565
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,170
By stopping Mardon.

566
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:41,572
Yes, but this
new ability of yours,

567
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:44,875
Barry, is dangerous.

568
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,510
You only traveled back
in time one day.

569
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:49,680
What if you
traveled back decades?

570
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:51,582
Centuries?

571
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:54,218
Imagine the havoc
you could wreak.

572
00:25:56,788 --> 00:26:00,358
But I will
have the opportunity

573
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,662
To travel back in time
in the near future

574
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:07,598
And save my mom.

575
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,936
Or... You're saying
I shouldn't?

576
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:13,938
I'm saying

577
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,974
How many more people could die

578
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:19,176
If your mother lives?

579
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:21,178
Did you guys find Cisco?

580
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,718
Most people think
the hottest part of the flame

581
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,553
Is the white part.

582
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:30,788
They're wrong.

583
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:35,960
You gonna admire those
or you gonna drink 'em?

584
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:38,662
Both.

585
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:15,900
I told her you wanted
to become a priest.

586
00:27:15,902 --> 00:27:17,568
Broke her heart.

587
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,637
Why'd you do that?

588
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:23,040
Because I was
jealous of you, man.

589
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:25,109
I mean, even then I...

590
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:28,078
I knew exactly where
my life was headed.

591
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,048
- Nowhere.
- Dante.

592
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,049
That's not true.

593
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:33,717
I live at home.

594
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,953
And I work a crap job
for no pay.

595
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:37,154
Yeah, but you still manage

596
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,989
To be mom and dad's favorite.

597
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,959
I don't even know why.

598
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:44,128
It's because they...
they still think of me

599
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,697
As their son,
the concert pianist.

600
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:50,201
But you, man, they never
understood your talents.

601
00:27:50,203 --> 00:27:52,203
Never understood that
you pursued your passion

602
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:53,370
No matter what.

603
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:54,805
And me, I was just too scared

604
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:57,975
To even try.

605
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,651
Dant...
Dante...

606
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:10,154
No!

607
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:11,288
Aah!

608
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:18,796
Oh!

609
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:20,030
Mick!

610
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,299
Mick, calm down!

611
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:24,768
Mick!
We need them!

612
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:28,205
Mick?
Baby?

613
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,640
It sounds like you're hungry.

614
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:32,776
How about you and I grab
some dinner?

615
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:35,012
I like you, kid.

616
00:28:35,014 --> 00:28:36,146
You're smart.

617
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,147
You pulled yourself up

618
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:39,350
From humble beginnings.

619
00:28:39,352 --> 00:28:42,086
You seem like a good brother.

620
00:28:42,088 --> 00:28:43,521
You too.

621
00:28:43,523 --> 00:28:45,055
Debatable.

622
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,624
You answer one question
for me,

623
00:28:46,626 --> 00:28:50,761
I'll let you
and your brother walk.

624
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:51,896
What's the question?

625
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:56,898
The Flash.
Who is he?

626
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:01,672
I swear... he always
wears a mask.

627
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:02,673
Aah!

628
00:29:02,675 --> 00:29:03,674
No!

629
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:04,842
No! Stop!

630
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:08,445
This is first degree
frost bite.

631
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,614
Your brother could
recover with proper treatment.

632
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:13,551
If not, all his tendons,
blood vessels, and nerves

633
00:29:13,553 --> 00:29:14,752
Will freeze.

634
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:17,521
His fingers will need
to be amputated.

635
00:29:17,523 --> 00:29:20,724
No more concertos for
the Ramon family holidays.

636
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:22,059
Now tell me,

637
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:25,462
Who is the Flash?

638
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,307
There's nothing on
the satellite thermography.

639
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:37,875
You were right.
This is all my fault.

640
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:38,909
How is this your fault?

641
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:39,944
Brave heart, Barry.

642
00:29:39,946 --> 00:29:42,279
We'll get Cisco back.

643
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,048
I'm back.

644
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,116
Oh, my god.
Are you okay?

645
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,252
We were so worried.

646
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:49,920
What happened?

647
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:51,522
How did you escape?

648
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,692
I didn't.

649
00:29:54,694 --> 00:29:58,362
Snart just let you go?
Why?

650
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:02,366
He, um...
He tortured my brother.

651
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:05,369
And he said
he was gonna kill him

652
00:30:05,371 --> 00:30:08,405
If I didn't...

653
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,774
If I didn't tell him...

654
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:14,044
Tell him what?

655
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:18,248
Who the Flash really is.

656
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,918
I, honestly, man, they...

657
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,421
They could've killed me.

658
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:27,358
But they were gonna
kill my brother.

659
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,093
I couldn't let him do that.

660
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:32,563
Hey.

661
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:33,597
I'm sorry, Barry.

662
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,100
- No.
- I'm so sorry.

663
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:39,303
I put you in that position.

664
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,542
I'm the one who's sorry.

665
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,416
Where are you going?

666
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:57,855
I don't deserve to be here.

667
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:00,758
I won't be the one
to put you in jeopardy.

668
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,193
Not again.

669
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,796
Never again.

670
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:15,806
Hey.

671
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:17,107
What?

672
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:18,275
What a surprise.

673
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:19,743
Oh.

674
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:23,280
As big a surprise as
Eddie punching Barry

675
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:24,581
At a crime scene
this evening.

676
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:26,583
Oh, my god.
Is Barry okay?

677
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:29,453
Yeah.
He... Heals fast.

678
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:31,955
Look, Iris.
This got complicated.

679
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:35,526
I know.
I'm sorry.

680
00:31:35,528 --> 00:31:39,263
Barry was too late.
I'm with Eddie.

681
00:31:39,265 --> 00:31:41,999
Let me ask you something.

682
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:46,570
Who do you love?

683
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,706
I mean, I love Eddie.

684
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:51,108
Okay. You need to
make them believe that,

685
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,711
Because right now, I'm not
sure either one of them does.

686
00:31:53,713 --> 00:31:55,179
Okay?

687
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:58,749
Okay.

688
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:01,218
Did I ever tell you
how wise and amazing you are?

689
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,553
Not enough.

690
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:07,091
See you later.

691
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:10,961
- Bad time?
- Yes, actually.

692
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:28,712
Don't worry, I'll be
out of here soon.

693
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:33,350
Well, before you
shuffle off forever,

694
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,486
May I show you something?

695
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:46,697
I get it.
I failed.

696
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:50,334
No, no, no. Now, you're an
incredibly clever guy, Cisco.

697
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:54,404
So why don't you tell me

698
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:56,607
Why would I bring you
down here?

699
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,512
Because we all failed
that night.

700
00:33:01,514 --> 00:33:04,047
But we kept going.

701
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,283
We kept trying to
protect each other,

702
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:07,718
And Barry,

703
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,586
In spite of the setbacks.

704
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:11,388
Making a choice

705
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,956
Between two people you love,

706
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:15,893
That is the hardest dilemma
you will ever face.

707
00:33:15,895 --> 00:33:19,196
Well, you won't have to
worry about me

708
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:20,664
Making the wrong decision again.

709
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:23,467
All you proved
today, Mr. Ramon,

710
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:25,035
Is that you're human.

711
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:27,738
All you proved today

712
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,640
Is that you love
your brother.

713
00:33:29,642 --> 00:33:34,077
And the reason that
we all want you to stay

714
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,780
Is that we love you too.

715
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:40,083
Now, I am not a parent,

716
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:43,420
But, in many ways,

717
00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:45,055
You have shown me
what it's like

718
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:49,226
To have a son.

719
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:54,097
Guys, you should get up here.

720
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,099
Shall we?

721
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,772
The casino wasn't the target.

722
00:34:01,774 --> 00:34:02,973
Then why did he do it?

723
00:34:02,975 --> 00:34:05,008
Casinos keep tons
of cash on hand

724
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,410
To cover their markers,
not to mention

725
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:07,611
The money that they make.

726
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,246
But if they're under attack,

727
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:11,481
The protocol is to relocate
the money outside the casino.

728
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:13,784
So, that was Snart's plan
all along.

729
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:16,053
- To trigger the move.
- Okay, where is it now?

730
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:31,668
Get ready, we got company.

731
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:53,023
Aah!

732
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:13,977
Oh!

733
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:27,024
Good to see you...

734
00:35:27,026 --> 00:35:29,493
Barry.

735
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:31,161
We have to talk.

736
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:39,036
I know Cisco told you who I am.

737
00:35:39,038 --> 00:35:41,772
Can't really blame
the kid for giving you up.

738
00:35:41,774 --> 00:35:43,407
You or his brother?
Come on!

739
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:45,676
I put him in a tight spot.

740
00:35:45,678 --> 00:35:48,378
Same kind I got you in
right now.

741
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,615
Can't really stop me now
that I know who you are.

742
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:53,884
I could speed you
to my own private prison

743
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:55,585
Where you'll never
see the light of day.

744
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:57,020
You could, but then
I won't be around

745
00:35:57,022 --> 00:35:58,722
To stop my own private uplink

746
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:00,891
That'll broadcast
your identity to the world.

747
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:03,927
So, the million dollar
question.

748
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:06,563
What to do with me now,
Barry Allen?

749
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:07,965
I won't let you keep stealing

750
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:10,701
Whatever you want,
whenever you feel like it.

751
00:36:10,703 --> 00:36:12,769
- It needs to end.
- Can't do that.

752
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:13,937
It's what I do.

753
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,672
Then find a new line of work.

754
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,040
Don't want to.

755
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:18,241
Why is that?

756
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:20,911
The same reason you keep
running after guys like me.

757
00:36:20,913 --> 00:36:23,714
The adrenaline.
The thrill of the chase.

758
00:36:23,716 --> 00:36:25,382
I love this game.

759
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:27,684
And I'm very good at it.

760
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,820
Then go play it
somewhere else.

761
00:36:29,822 --> 00:36:30,921
Leave Central City.

762
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:32,556
Can't do that either.

763
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:33,557
I love it here.

764
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,560
This city is my home.

765
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:42,099
You've seen what I can do.

766
00:36:42,101 --> 00:36:45,002
You know that I can stop you.

767
00:36:45,004 --> 00:36:47,004
You want to keep
pushing your luck,

768
00:36:47,006 --> 00:36:48,505
Go for it.

769
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:50,273
But from here on out,

770
00:36:50,275 --> 00:36:52,309
No one else dies.

771
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:53,777
If you're as good
as you say you are,

772
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:55,278
You don't have to kill anyone

773
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,249
To get what you want.

774
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:02,386
That's true.

775
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:08,392
And if you, or anyone
in your rogues' gallery

776
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:12,462
Goes near any of my friends
or family again,

777
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:16,633
I don't care who you tell
my identity to.

778
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:18,802
I'm putting you away.

779
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,941
I guess your secret's safe...

780
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:27,511
Flash.

781
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:29,179
For now.

782
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:38,655
Oh, I don't suppose
you'd give me a ride

783
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:41,258
Back to town, would you?

784
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,466
The rogues.

785
00:37:49,468 --> 00:37:51,468
Cute.

786
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:05,015
I...

787
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:06,883
I am so sorry, pal.

788
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:08,151
It's not like me
to hit anyone.

789
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:10,053
I don't know
what came over me.

790
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:12,923
Uh... Thanks, Eddie.
It's... it's okay.

791
00:38:12,925 --> 00:38:15,826
You poor thing.
I had no idea.

792
00:38:15,828 --> 00:38:17,294
Is that right?
Um...

793
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:20,130
What exactly did you
have no idea about?

794
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:21,832
I was just explaining
to Iris and Eddie

795
00:38:21,834 --> 00:38:24,067
About your lightning psychosis.

796
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:24,868
My what now?

797
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,570
Your lightning psychosis.

798
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:28,238
How your recent odd behavior

799
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,774
Is a side effect
of being struck by lightning.

800
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:33,877
Mood swings,
sudden outbursts of affection,

801
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:35,779
And other lapses in judgment.

802
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:36,913
He has had
all of those things.

803
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:38,782
He told me that he had ESP.

804
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:40,484
Yeah, it's a very uncommon

805
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:41,585
Neurological phenomenon.

806
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:42,953
We're really only just now

807
00:38:42,955 --> 00:38:44,721
Starting to research in
kerauno-medicine.

808
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:46,056
That's why Barry's been

809
00:38:46,058 --> 00:38:48,291
Spending so much time
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

810
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:50,060
I just... I wish
you would've told me.

811
00:38:50,062 --> 00:38:53,396
I didn't... it hardly
feels real sometimes.

812
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:55,132
We're just glad you're
getting help.

813
00:38:55,134 --> 00:38:56,233
Yeah.

814
00:38:56,235 --> 00:38:57,801
So, we're good?

815
00:38:57,803 --> 00:39:00,370
Yeah, we're good.

816
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:02,906
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

817
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,544
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

818
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:29,232
Come on.
Hey.

819
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:36,640
Harrison Wells.

820
00:39:36,642 --> 00:39:38,708
What do you know about him?

821
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,243
Ooh!

822
00:39:45,284 --> 00:39:48,218
What do you know?

823
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,787
Everything I know
is in that drive.

824
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:52,222
I swear.

825
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:53,823
Oh!

826
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:56,126
Ugh!

827
00:39:56,128 --> 00:39:59,029
Everything?

828
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:02,265
Everything!
Just take it!

829
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:18,582
You really were on to the story
of the century.

830
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:19,849
Well...

831
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:22,385
This century, anyway.

832
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,997
Do you think I made a mistake

833
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:37,234
Letting Snart go?

834
00:40:37,236 --> 00:40:39,769
I think you did what you felt
was right in the moment.

835
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,105
And really, Barry,

836
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:46,276
That's the best any
of us can hope for.

837
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:50,714
Now, let's be thankful
the timeline remains intact.

838
00:40:50,716 --> 00:40:53,049
Oh!
I keep forgetting.

839
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,417
I've been meaning to ask you.

840
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:56,953
It's about Simon...

841
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,624
You were saying, Mr. Allen?

842
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:02,592
Uh...

843
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:05,695
Nothing.
Sorry.

844
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,430
Night, Dr. Wells.

845
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:09,966
Good night, Barry.

846
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,362
Barr, what's up?

847
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:42,265
Why'd you want to
meet up here so late?

848
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:47,437
I think that maybe you were
right about Dr. Wells.

849
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:49,839
Which part?

850
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,375
All of it.

851
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,133
Greg, move your head.
