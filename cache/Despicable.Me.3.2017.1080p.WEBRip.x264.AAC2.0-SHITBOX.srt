"Despicable Me 3 (2017)" ^ (Run time 01:29:32)

2
00:00:26,782 --> 00:00:28,792
Illuminat...

3
00:00:30,127 --> 00:00:31,905
Illuminat...

4
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:34,115
Illuminat...

5
00:00:34,116 --> 00:00:35,699
What?
A horn?

6
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:41,891
Illumination!

7
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,477
The year was 1985, and the
number-one show on TV was...

8
00:00:58,478 --> 00:01:01,256
Evil Bratt.

9
00:01:01,257 --> 00:01:05,151
The show starred young Balthazar Bratt
as a child prodigy

10
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:09,757
and criminal mastermind
bent on world domination.

11
00:01:09,758 --> 00:01:11,939
There he is!
Get him!

12
00:01:14,688 --> 00:01:17,825
I've been a bad boy!

13
00:01:17,826 --> 00:01:20,831
Bratt was the biggest child actor
of the 1980s,

14
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:24,188
striking a chord with audiences
all over the world.

15
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:25,596
- Yay!
- Yeah!

16
00:01:25,597 --> 00:01:26,770
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

17
00:01:26,771 --> 00:01:28,033
There he is!
Get him!

18
00:01:28,034 --> 00:01:30,856
But it all came to an end
in season three,

19
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:31,882
When...

20
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,436
I've been a bad boy!

21
00:01:34,437 --> 00:01:38,114
- The young star experienced
an unexpected growth spurt.
- Boy? Boy?

22
00:01:38,337 --> 00:01:41,158
The show was canceled.
Hollywood rejected him

23
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,597
and Bratt quickly plunged
into a downward spiral.

24
00:01:44,598 --> 00:01:49,813
Starting to actually believed he was
the character he played on TV.

25
00:01:49,814 --> 00:01:51,784
What are you looking at?

26
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:53,685
Leading us all to wonder...

27
00:01:53,686 --> 00:01:56,177
Where is he now?

28
00:02:02,312 --> 00:02:03,653
You know what, Clive?

29
00:02:03,654 --> 00:02:06,177
Playing a villain on TV was fun,

30
00:02:06,178 --> 00:02:09,682
but being one in real life
is even better.

31
00:02:09,683 --> 00:02:11,088
Heist music!

32
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,117
Here it comes.

33
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:16,825
What?
Clive!

34
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:19,668
What are you doing?
How is that heist music?

35
00:02:19,669 --> 00:02:21,903
Sorry, my bad.

36
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:55,981
Ewww!

37
00:02:55,982 --> 00:02:58,349
Wha-whoa!
Gah!

38
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,031
Mommy!

39
00:03:03,387 --> 00:03:04,935
Stop right...

40
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:07,320
ANTI VILLAIN LEAGUE   HEADQUARTERS

41
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:10,851
Sir, the ship has been boarded by
some kind of... monster.

42
00:03:10,852 --> 00:03:12,736
Wait, that's not a monster.

43
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:15,654
That's a man wearing shoulder pads.

44
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:19,550
There's only one supervillain whose
fashion sense is quite that dated,

45
00:03:19,551 --> 00:03:21,537
Balthazar Bratt.

46
00:03:21,538 --> 00:03:24,265
Blast it!
The Dupont Diamond is on that ship!

47
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:28,984
I want every agent in the area
on the scene immediately.

48
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:32,675
Ha, ha, ha... !

49
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:33,682
Woo-hoo!

50
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:36,524
We're already here!
Agents Grucy are closing in fast.

51
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:39,241
Yes... wait, wha?
What did you call us?

52
00:03:39,242 --> 00:03:42,179
Grucy. You know,
Gru and Lucy mushed together.

53
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,227
Try it.

54
00:03:43,228 --> 00:03:45,658
Haha!
I like it, but not a lot,

55
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,575
I don't like it.

56
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:53,098
Stop!

57
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,650
On the ground!

58
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:17,128
The jewel!
Move!

59
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:18,932
Go, go, go!

60
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,043
Don't move.

61
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:25,272
Uh?

62
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,539
Too late again, Gru.
Ha, ha, ha... !

63
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:45,645
WHAAA... ?

64
00:04:45,646 --> 00:04:46,683
He's getting away!!

65
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:48,709
That's what he thinks.

66
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:54,478
- Wahooo!
- Ha, ha!

67
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,455
Go, go!

68
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:58,504
Ugh!
Go, go.

69
00:04:58,505 --> 00:05:00,442
Go, go, go!

70
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:05,332
I don't think
we can make it, Gru.

71
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,220
We can make it!

72
00:05:08,737 --> 00:05:13,324
We can make it... !

73
00:05:13,325 --> 00:05:16,241
No, we can't!

74
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:18,940
Get ready!

75
00:05:19,296 --> 00:05:23,604
Get ready for whaaa... !

76
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:34,484
Hey.
How're you doing?

77
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:38,041
Are you okay?

78
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:40,081
- Hello.
- Oh.

79
00:05:40,082 --> 00:05:42,002
You guys are so cute.

80
00:05:42,003 --> 00:05:44,118
Go get him, Gru Gru!

81
00:05:44,284 --> 00:05:46,322
Hello, Gru.

82
00:05:46,828 --> 00:05:48,352
How's your transition coming?

83
00:05:48,353 --> 00:05:52,060
You know, from world's worst villain
to world's worst agent?

84
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,475
Oh, that's hilarious!
You should be on TV!

85
00:05:54,476 --> 00:05:56,528
Oh, that's right,
you were...

86
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:58,774
but then you got canceled.

87
00:05:58,988 --> 00:06:00,704
Ha ha!

88
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:02,261
What about that?

89
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:04,421
Whaaa...
Oh! Girls… !

90
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:05,626
Oh!

91
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:09,214
Dance fight!

92
00:06:21,774 --> 00:06:23,361
Ow!

93
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:29,405
Alpha team, the diamond is secure.

94
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:31,168
Come and pick up the package.

95
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:33,640
Copy that, Alpha team on approach.

96
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,469
Gru.

97
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,832
- Did you actually think
I was unconscious?
- Oh.

98
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,961
It's called acting, hoser!

99
00:06:44,962 --> 00:06:48,035
And clearly I've still got it!

100
00:07:02,357 --> 00:07:06,717
I've been a baaaaaaaad boy!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

101
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:07,945
Freeze!
Don't move!

102
00:07:07,946 --> 00:07:09,342
Son of a Betamax!

103
00:07:09,343 --> 00:07:10,878
Go! Go!
Get him! Get him!

104
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,886
He's getting away!

105
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:16,210
This isn't over, Gru!
You hear me?

106
00:07:16,211 --> 00:07:18,264
This is not over!

107
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:21,741
Yeah?
Well, I still have the diamond!

108
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:27,499
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to...

109
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:33,020
Happy birthday, dear Daaaaaan.

110
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:37,575
Happy birthday to you.

111
00:07:37,576 --> 00:07:40,745
- Ha, ha, ha, ha!
- Ha, ha, ha, ha!

112
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:43,072
- Hey, you ready?
- Yeah!

113
00:07:43,073 --> 00:07:47,136
Party!
Party, everyone!

114
00:07:52,176 --> 00:07:56,757
DESPICABLE ME 3

115
00:07:59,975 --> 00:08:02,153
Hey!
Watch it!

116
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,049
I can't believe
Bratt got away, again.

117
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:14,116
How is this possible?
How...

118
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,000
And it's not just that he got away!
It's that he's so smug about it!

119
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:28,685
Ewww.
I've been a baaaaaaaad boy!

120
00:08:28,686 --> 00:08:30,272
Edna, hey.

121
00:08:30,273 --> 00:08:32,083
Looking hot... today.

122
00:08:32,084 --> 00:08:34,035
Got the... cats on you.

123
00:08:34,036 --> 00:08:36,256
And it was just so humiliating.

124
00:08:36,257 --> 00:08:39,454
Dangling there in the
bubble-gum Speedo.

125
00:08:39,455 --> 00:08:41,857
And I didn't have time to go
to the gym this week!

126
00:08:41,858 --> 00:08:44,445
And I had a big breakfast!

127
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:47,486
I was feeling a little bloated!

128
00:08:48,955 --> 00:08:51,184
You know what?
He's not even worth talking about.

129
00:08:51,185 --> 00:08:55,625
I don't even want to waste
another breath about the guy.

130
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:57,169
And another thing!

131
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:02,656
Next time I see Bratt, I will
moonwalk all over his stupid face!

132
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,502
Thank you all for coming
in such short notice.

133
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:15,647
It is with great sadness that
I inform you that as of today

134
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:20,047
I am retiring as
head of the AVL.

135
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,969
Oh no.

136
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:30,810
Your new leader is coming directly from
head office, effective immediately.

137
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:38,756
She is the very gifted, very ambitious
Miss Valerie Da Vinci.

138
00:09:38,757 --> 00:09:44,622
As I look out over all of your faces,
I am flooded with so many memories.

139
00:09:44,623 --> 00:09:47,895
- Oh boy, this is a snoozeday.
- I... Excuse me.

140
00:09:47,896 --> 00:09:52,130
Blah blah blah. We understand.
You're old, you're fat, you're done.

141
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,258
Let me breathe in.

142
00:09:55,404 --> 00:09:58,036
Woo.
Broke a little sweat there.

143
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,904
First order of business.

144
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:04,335
Which one of you losers
is Agent Gru?!

145
00:10:05,024 --> 00:10:07,335
Uh… that would be me.

146
00:10:07,336 --> 00:10:11,753
Although I don't know
if I'd say 'loser' per Se,

147
00:10:11,754 --> 00:10:13,751
 kind of a...
Huh!

148
00:10:15,272 --> 00:10:18,834
Oh, it's the girls.
Not a good time.

149
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,326
- Hey!
- Aaah!

150
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:23,307
Yes, sir.
Huh, uh... ma'am.

151
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:24,698
You're making me nervous.

152
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:27,740
How could you let Balthazar Bratt,

153
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:31,441
the AVL's most-wanted villain,
just get away?

154
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:33,753
That is the opposite of
what we do here!

155
00:10:33,754 --> 00:10:37,946
Okay, okay, yes,
maybe he got away... again,

156
00:10:37,947 --> 00:10:40,746
but he didn't get the diamond!

157
00:10:40,747 --> 00:10:43,862
And I am this close
to bringing him in.

158
00:10:43,863 --> 00:10:46,098
This close!

159
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:47,898
Huh?
Interesting.

160
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:49,232
You're fired!

161
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,413
Huh!
What?

162
00:10:50,414 --> 00:10:53,299
This is totally not fair.
Gru is a great agent.

163
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,704
You know what?
If you fire him,

164
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:57,142
you're going to have to fire me,
sister sister.

165
00:10:57,143 --> 00:11:00,873
And do you really want to do that?
Do ya?

166
00:11:00,874 --> 00:11:02,940
No, no, no, no, no.

167
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:10,962
Well, I guess she did!

168
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:18,112
Honey, you didn't have to do that.

169
00:11:18,113 --> 00:11:19,899
I know how much
you love your job.

170
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,238
Well, I love other things more.

171
00:11:25,229 --> 00:11:27,584
You know, we're going to
have to tell the girls.

172
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:29,401
Can you do it?

173
00:11:29,426 --> 00:11:32,212
The whole Mom thing is
still kind of new to me.

174
00:11:32,237 --> 00:11:34,230
Oh, sure.

175
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,513
Hello?

176
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:02,892
- Aloha!
- Aloha!

177
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:04,457
Oh!

178
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,157
This is unexpected.

179
00:12:07,158 --> 00:12:09,646
Well, you never got to go
on a honeymoon, so…

180
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:10,931
We made you dinner!

181
00:12:10,932 --> 00:12:12,099
It's a luau!

182
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,905
We got pineapples and
coconuts and lukuleles!

183
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:17,232
- Oh ho, yeah.
- Yeah.

184
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:21,136
Hey!
Ya malatika tika, hee ha!

185
00:12:21,137 --> 00:12:23,150
Oww oww oww ah ah ah!

186
00:12:23,151 --> 00:12:25,723
Oww oww oww ah ah ah!

187
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,483
Ahem.

188
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:35,173
The soup of the day,
madame and monsieur.

189
00:12:35,174 --> 00:12:37,917
The gummy bears were my idea.

190
00:12:41,545 --> 00:12:44,963
Mmmmmm…
Looks too good to even eat!

191
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,780
Am I right?

192
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:50,419
- But I made it for you.…
- Oh.

193
00:12:53,596 --> 00:13:01,161
Good soup! I love the combination
of gummy bears and meat!

194
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,028
I'm gonna hold it
in my mouth,

195
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:10,013
because it's so good
I don't want to swallow it.

196
00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:11,697
So.
How was work?

197
00:13:11,698 --> 00:13:15,056
Did you take that guy down?
Did anything explode?

198
00:13:15,057 --> 00:13:19,757
Well, actually,
today Lucy and I

199
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:25,014
were invited to not work
at the AVL anymore.

200
00:13:25,015 --> 00:13:27,272
Huh!
No!

201
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,076
You got fired?

202
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:33,141
Oh no!
No, no, no...

203
00:13:34,102 --> 00:13:35,695
- Yes.
- What?

204
00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:37,674
But don't worry,

205
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:40,358
I'm sure we'll get
new jobs real soon.

206
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:42,626
Even better ones.

207
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:46,403
What's better than being
super-cool secret agents?

208
00:13:46,977 --> 00:13:49,532
Oh, I know!
You could gamble online!

209
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:51,607
That's what Katie's dad does!

210
00:13:51,608 --> 00:13:54,497
Okay, we will definitely
look into that.

211
00:13:54,498 --> 00:13:56,371
That's a good suggestion.

212
00:13:56,372 --> 00:14:00,911
And let's not go over
to Katie's house anymore.

213
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:03,496
Hmm.

214
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:09,569
Guys, shhhhhh.
I don't think you heard me right.

215
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,245
No, no, no, no, no, no, this does not mean
that we are going back to being villains.

216
00:14:13,246 --> 00:14:15,031
- Oh.
- Oh.

217
00:14:15,032 --> 00:14:16,513
Boring!
Please do something!

218
00:14:16,514 --> 00:14:18,665
Okay, alright,
I get it.

219
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:21,271
Look, I know it's been
a little tough lately,

220
00:14:21,272 --> 00:14:27,388
especially with Doctor Nefario
accidentally freezing himself in carbonite,

221
00:14:29,098 --> 00:14:29,719
Ow!

222
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,704
but our life of crime is over!

223
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:38,161
Mel.
Mel, you're with me on this, right?

224
00:14:38,371 --> 00:14:39,697
Look.

225
00:14:39,698 --> 00:14:41,340
- Good...
- Yay!

226
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:43,320
- Boring!
- Boo!

227
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:45,019
- Good...
- Yay!

228
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,195
- Boring!
- Ohh!

229
00:14:47,196 --> 00:14:49,058
- Good...
- Yay!

230
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:51,754
- Boring!
- Boo!

231
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:54,302
Minions… no more boring!!

232
00:14:54,303 --> 00:14:56,724
Boring!
Boring!

233
00:14:56,725 --> 00:14:59,744
Guys!
Listen to me and read my lips!

234
00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:04,431
Lissa me lippo, pomodoro la comquit!

235
00:15:06,444 --> 00:15:08,213
What?
Wha...

236
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:10,772
What did I say?
"la comquit?"

237
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:14,236
Oh, okay,
pomodoro la kumquat.

238
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:16,552
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you say no more crime?

239
00:15:16,553 --> 00:15:17,413
I cannot accept this.

240
00:15:17,414 --> 00:15:19,049
Don't take that tone with me!

241
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,115
We're not going back to villainy.

242
00:15:21,116 --> 00:15:22,460
Uh.
No villainy?

243
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:26,285
Yes. And I don't want to hear
another word about it.

244
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:32,008
Look, if you guys
don't stop that right now,

245
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:33,937
there will be consequences!

246
00:15:33,938 --> 00:15:36,004
Huh!
I can do whatever I want.

247
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:36,469
Hey.

248
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,645
Don't say anything
you're going to regret.

249
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,672
Oh. Listen to this.
I quit!

250
00:15:41,711 --> 00:15:43,219
See you!

251
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,550
What?
You quit?

252
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:48,566
You're serious?
Come on.

253
00:15:51,229 --> 00:15:53,508
Uh. Uh.
Bud-Buddy?

254
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:56,025
Dave!
Jerry!

255
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,904
Great news, guys...
you've been promoted.

256
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:03,970
You're in charge now, eh?
Not bad!

257
00:16:04,854 --> 00:16:07,788
Yipa! Yipo!
Yippee!

258
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:11,501
- Aruba-ruba-ruba-ruba!
- Aruba-ruba-ruba-ruba!

259
00:16:12,092 --> 00:16:13,929
Jeesh!

260
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:22,442
PARIS, FRANCE

261
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:27,531
Huh!

262
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:35,729
Monsieur Pompo.

263
00:16:35,754 --> 00:16:41,329
To what do we owe the presence
of the world's foremost gem expert?

264
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,321
The chief of police sent me.

265
00:16:43,322 --> 00:16:46,286
He was concerned that during
the recent heist attempt,

266
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:50,634
The Dupont Diamond
was replaced with a phony.

267
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:08,830
Ooh la la.

268
00:17:08,831 --> 00:17:11,610
You have been duped.

269
00:17:11,611 --> 00:17:13,101
What?
We have?

270
00:17:13,102 --> 00:17:14,299
Yes.

271
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,292
By me!

272
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,336
Wha-What is... ?

273
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,280
Oh no.
Help!

274
00:17:31,122 --> 00:17:33,568
Ha ha ha...

275
00:17:44,328 --> 00:17:47,211
I've been a bad boy!

276
00:17:47,212 --> 00:17:51,826
Or should I say,
"Je suis un mauvais garçon!"

277
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,351
Oh.

278
00:18:30,036 --> 00:18:33,145
Hey, Gru,
whatcha doing down here?

279
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:34,907
In the dark.

280
00:18:34,908 --> 00:18:35,852
Alone.

281
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:38,695
Oh nothing, just thinking.

282
00:18:38,696 --> 00:18:40,165
You okay?

283
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,842
Oh yes, yeah,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

284
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:44,786
It's just…

285
00:18:45,003 --> 00:18:50,688
I don't know.
I guess I just feel like a… failure.

286
00:18:50,877 --> 00:18:53,197
Like I don't have
a purpose anymore.

287
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:56,727
Hey, mister,
you are not a failure.

288
00:18:56,728 --> 00:19:00,258
If only I could've nailed Bratt.

289
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:03,683
So many times
I almost had him!

290
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,248
But now I'll never
get the chance.

291
00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:08,372
'Cause I have been
kicked to the curb.

292
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:12,037
Gru, you've got to let this go.
It's time to look forward.

293
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:14,886
Things will get better, I promise.

294
00:19:31,818 --> 00:19:34,342
Follow me.
Follow me.

295
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:36,406
Coming through, make way.

296
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:38,380
- Coming through.
- Uh, excuse me.

297
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:42,048
Pardon me,
young... people.

298
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:45,439
Would you tell me
how to get to this address?

299
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,235
Uh.
Uh, ah.

300
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:48,734
You are looking for Minions?

301
00:19:48,735 --> 00:19:51,127
I'm looking for a Mr. Gru.

302
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:53,557
Gru is a lousy boss!

303
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,803
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

304
00:19:55,804 --> 00:19:57,402
Bye!

305
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:05,995
Idiots.

306
00:20:09,017 --> 00:20:11,214
No. Kyle.
Stop!

307
00:20:11,215 --> 00:20:13,453
Kyle, let go.

308
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:16,909
BRATT STEALS WORLD'S
BIGGEST DIAMOND

309
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,107
No, no...
you've got to be kidding me.

310
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:21,286
Lucy, did you see...

311
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:25,163
He helps you if you have nightmares,
and he's really good to snuggle with...

312
00:20:25,164 --> 00:20:26,906
Oh no, no, no, Agnes!
Agnes!

313
00:20:26,907 --> 00:20:29,120
So, take good care of him.

314
00:20:29,121 --> 00:20:30,846
Thank you!

315
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,514
Agnes, what are you doing?
You...

316
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:35,394
You sold your unicorn?

317
00:20:35,395 --> 00:20:39,727
Well, I just wanted to help.
Since you don't have a job.

318
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:42,406
I got two whole dollars for it!

319
00:20:42,431 --> 00:20:44,545
- Awwwww.
- Awwwww.

320
00:20:45,137 --> 00:20:46,907
Uh, excuse me.

321
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:49,042
Sorry, buddy, the sale's over.

322
00:20:49,043 --> 00:20:50,512
Yes, but this will only take a....

323
00:20:50,537 --> 00:20:53,066
Hey, Eyebrows.
Get off the lawn.

324
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:54,466
Yeah, but...

325
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:57,867
- Hey, could you...
- Oh uh, of course.

326
00:20:57,868 --> 00:21:00,266
Now, as I was saying.
I...

327
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:03,093
- Uh... Oh.
- Goodbye.

328
00:21:08,373 --> 00:21:10,923
Listen, Agnes.
You don't need to worry.

329
00:21:10,924 --> 00:21:12,749
We're going to be fine.

330
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,027
- For real?
- For real.

331
00:21:15,028 --> 00:21:16,850
Now come on,
let's pack this stuff up.

332
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,071
Ow.
Ow.

333
00:21:18,096 --> 00:21:21,617
Seriously?
Buddy, you're not getting the hint.

334
00:21:21,618 --> 00:21:24,375
Excuse me, Mr. Gru.

335
00:21:24,376 --> 00:21:27,735
But I really must
have a word with you.

336
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:29,325
How did you know my name?

337
00:21:29,326 --> 00:21:33,777
Allow me to introduce myself...
my name is Fritz, and OW!

338
00:21:33,778 --> 00:21:36,064
Uh, good puppy.

339
00:21:36,065 --> 00:21:40,592
And I am inquiring…
on behalf of your twin brother, Dru.

340
00:21:40,593 --> 00:21:42,119
He needs your help.

341
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,887
What?
Twin brother?

342
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:44,978
Twin brother?

343
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:46,019
- Twin brother?
- Twin brother?

344
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,937
Oh Yeah.

345
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:50,417
He would like to fly you
to Freedonia to meet him.

346
00:21:50,418 --> 00:21:54,322
Your father has recently
passed away and...

347
00:21:54,323 --> 00:21:57,238
Okay, cuckoo.
I'm sorry, but my dad died

348
00:21:57,239 --> 00:21:59,898
when I was a baby,
and I don't have any brother.

349
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:01,257
You've got the wrong guy.

350
00:22:01,258 --> 00:22:02,465
Really?

351
00:22:02,466 --> 00:22:07,293
Well, then how do
you explain... this?

352
00:22:12,777 --> 00:22:16,027
Ahhhhh!
Bellissimo!

353
00:22:17,746 --> 00:22:20,806
- Oh, hello, Gru.
- Hi, Mom.

354
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:25,355
It's important to keep active
in one's golden years.

355
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,711
There you are, you cute cute.

356
00:22:32,148 --> 00:22:38,733
These are my diving instructors,
Vincenzo and Paolo!

357
00:22:39,271 --> 00:22:41,596
Ciao, boys!

358
00:22:41,597 --> 00:22:43,753
So what do you want?

359
00:22:43,754 --> 00:22:47,373
Mom, do I have a twin brother?

360
00:22:47,724 --> 00:22:49,795
How did you find out?
Who told you?

361
00:22:49,796 --> 00:22:51,266
Wait, what?
It's true?

362
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:53,380
You never told me
I had a brother!

363
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:56,933
And you told me that Dad died of
disappointment when I was born!

364
00:22:56,934 --> 00:23:00,498
Yeah, yeah, that was the agreement.

365
00:23:00,499 --> 00:23:04,175
Agreement?
What are you talking about?

366
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:11,928
Shortly after you and your brother
were born, your father and I divorced.

367
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:15,273
We each took one son
to raise on our own.

368
00:23:15,274 --> 00:23:19,372
And promised never
to see each other again.

369
00:23:20,247 --> 00:23:25,354
Obviously, I got second pick.

370
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,763
I have a brother.

371
00:23:36,176 --> 00:23:39,009
Hey girls, how are things
in row B, huh?

372
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,579
I've put together some
fun activities for the trip.

373
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,584
Who is up for some
Gin Rummy?

374
00:23:44,585 --> 00:23:48,470
Yeah. Umm...
We're good.

375
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:50,370
Oh.
Okay.

376
00:23:50,371 --> 00:23:53,032
I'll just sit here
and play solitaire.

377
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:54,932
I hope I win.

378
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:57,519
I wonder what Dru
will be like!

379
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:57,989
Woo!

380
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,783
Maybe we'll have that twin thing

381
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:02,854
where we can read
each other's minds, you know?

382
00:24:02,855 --> 00:24:06,817
- How cool would that be?!
- Um, super cool.

383
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:16,377
Ah, ha ha ha...

384
00:24:16,378 --> 00:24:18,327
Ooh.

385
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:22,078
Aah!
Ow! Ow!

386
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,618
Woo-hoo!

387
00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:28,078
Freedonia!
Freedonia!

388
00:24:28,293 --> 00:24:30,163
Hi, piggy, piggy!

389
00:24:30,164 --> 00:24:33,625
Huh! Whoa!
Look at that house!

390
00:24:33,626 --> 00:24:35,275
It's like a castle!

391
00:24:35,276 --> 00:24:39,315
I can't wait
to meet my brother!

392
00:24:39,316 --> 00:24:41,522
Uh.
What's with all the pigs?

393
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:43,882
This is the family business.

394
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:47,964
The largest pig farm
in the whole of Freedonia.

395
00:24:48,249 --> 00:24:50,759
Okay, nice pig.

396
00:24:50,971 --> 00:24:53,881
No!
That's my private part!

397
00:24:53,882 --> 00:24:56,159
Owww!

398
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,875
This pig has issues!

399
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:00,549
Please, come in.

400
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,979
Wow.
Yeah, haha!

401
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,533
Whoa!

402
00:25:10,534 --> 00:25:13,519
Oh, this is amazing!

403
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,892
Ah, it's like the Sistine Chapel.
But with pigs.

404
00:25:21,617 --> 00:25:29,431
My brother!!

405
00:25:29,432 --> 00:25:31,175
- My brother!
- My brother!

406
00:25:31,176 --> 00:25:32,434
Gru!

407
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:34,356
Dru!

408
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,957
Ahhhh!
Brother! I am hugging you!

409
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:48,055
I'm so happy!

410
00:25:48,145 --> 00:25:52,564
After all these years,
finally I'm meeting you!

411
00:25:52,565 --> 00:25:56,537
- Yup, alright, good.
- Oh, look at that!

412
00:25:56,538 --> 00:25:58,767
- Woo!
- You must be the beautiful wife!

413
00:25:58,768 --> 00:26:01,948
Beautiful, oh.
Stop it!

414
00:26:01,949 --> 00:26:02,754
Sweet talker.

415
00:26:02,755 --> 00:26:06,850
How is my brother finding a wife
like you when he is so bald?

416
00:26:09,713 --> 00:26:13,974
Woo-hoo!
These must be my nieces!

417
00:26:13,975 --> 00:26:17,771
Huh! You're Agnes,
you're small with big eyes!

418
00:26:17,772 --> 00:26:20,015
And it makes me want to
put you in my pocket!

419
00:26:20,016 --> 00:26:23,407
You can't do that.
I'm too big.

420
00:26:23,432 --> 00:26:25,014
And Edith,

421
00:26:25,015 --> 00:26:28,504
I can tell that you are
a little mischievous.

422
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:31,145
We're going to have to make
a little trouble later.

423
00:26:31,146 --> 00:26:32,870
Wha...
I already have!

424
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:34,571
Ow.
Ow! Ow!

425
00:26:34,572 --> 00:26:37,239
Please, stop.
Why are you doing that?

426
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,630
Ow!
Ow.

427
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:42,106
Fist bump for mischievous behavior.

428
00:26:42,107 --> 00:26:45,133
And Margo!
Oh, you are so mature.

429
00:26:45,134 --> 00:26:47,980
I'm guessing what… fifteen?

430
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,208
Fifteen?

431
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:52,851
She's twelve! She looks twelve.
And will always be twelve.

432
00:26:52,852 --> 00:26:55,963
So, Dru…
this place is amazing.

433
00:26:55,964 --> 00:26:59,731
I mean, you just walk through the doors
and you're like: wooooowwwooowwooooo!!

434
00:26:59,732 --> 00:27:05,459
Eh. It's nice, I guess, sure.
I'm not really into 'things.'

435
00:27:07,824 --> 00:27:09,941
Wow!
This is so cool!

436
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:12,306
Oh my gosh,
he's even got a helicopter!

437
00:27:12,307 --> 00:27:14,438
This is the best!

438
00:27:14,439 --> 00:27:16,764
Yes, the best.

439
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:19,144
- All right, let's go home now.
- Home? Why?

440
00:27:19,145 --> 00:27:22,819
I don't know, this guy,
with the mansion and the cars

441
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,596
and… all the hair,
silky-smooth, luxurious hair.

442
00:27:27,597 --> 00:27:29,986
I feel worse than
I did before I came.

443
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:32,790
Oh, but he's your brother, Gru.
Give him a chance.

444
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:36,462
Oh, I was thinking, while Gru and I
catch up on some brother stuff,

445
00:27:36,487 --> 00:27:39,189
you girls should go with Fritz.
He has a surprise for you.

446
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,446
- Yay!
- Yay!
- Awesome.

447
00:27:40,447 --> 00:27:41,751
I love surprises!

448
00:27:41,752 --> 00:27:43,983
Oh, this is perfect.
Mother, daughter bonding time.

449
00:27:43,984 --> 00:27:46,322
Let's do it.
Woo-woo!

450
00:27:46,323 --> 00:27:48,684
Bye!
You boys have fun.

451
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:51,920
Ha ha ha!
Whoopee!

452
00:27:54,249 --> 00:27:56,654
Now you can be as evil
as Balthazar Bratt

453
00:27:56,655 --> 00:27:59,134
with the evil Bratt action figure,

454
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:02,882
featuring music activated
Break Dance mode.

455
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:07,181
Also featuring bubble gum
launching shoulder pads.

456
00:28:07,182 --> 00:28:11,222
And the all new
Mega Diamond Laser.

457
00:28:12,741 --> 00:28:14,423
No more math!

458
00:28:14,424 --> 00:28:17,417
I've been a bad boy!

459
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:21,287
Mega Diamond Laser does not
actually incinerate books.

460
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:27,264
How could Hollywood cancel a show
that produced toys like this, Clive?

461
00:28:27,387 --> 00:28:29,808
Evil Bratt was a masterpiece.

462
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:32,418
Does no one value
true art anymore?

463
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,591
It's a disgrace and a travesty, sir.

464
00:28:34,592 --> 00:28:38,557
Well, now that I've got the diamond,
it's payback time.

465
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:42,468
Oh, it's too bad Gru won't be
around to try and stop me.

466
00:28:42,469 --> 00:28:45,086
Oh, wait! No, it's not!
I hate that tweeb!

467
00:28:45,111 --> 00:28:47,039
And you, Hollywood!

468
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,273
This time, I'm canceling you!

469
00:28:50,274 --> 00:28:53,729
And all the losers
who rejected me!

470
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,272
Ha ha ha... !

471
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:00,564
Ooooo, piggy, piggy!

472
00:29:00,565 --> 00:29:04,100
So how are things
going for you, career-wise?

473
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:05,927
Ahhaaaaa… great.

474
00:29:05,928 --> 00:29:08,933
So, so great.
Crushing it.

475
00:29:08,934 --> 00:29:15,534
Well, I've got something that I think
you will find very interesting.

476
00:29:16,873 --> 00:29:19,523
Hold on to your face, Brother.

477
00:29:24,126 --> 00:29:25,455
Whaaaaaaaaaa!

478
00:29:25,456 --> 00:29:28,102
Yee-haw!
Ya ya!

479
00:29:28,103 --> 00:29:29,739
Eh.
What?

480
00:29:30,071 --> 00:29:31,534
Yee-haw!

481
00:29:36,997 --> 00:29:38,572
Ow!

482
00:29:39,674 --> 00:29:42,175
Huh? Ah!
Salami!

483
00:29:42,669 --> 00:29:44,337
Hey, I got Salami.

484
00:29:44,338 --> 00:29:46,199
Ah, yes, yes.

485
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,890
It's Salami.

486
00:29:48,043 --> 00:29:51,340
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Come on, come on.

487
00:29:53,108 --> 00:29:55,284
What is all this?

488
00:29:55,285 --> 00:30:00,229
The pig farm was just a cover
for the real family business.

489
00:30:01,972 --> 00:30:03,370
Haha!
Hey.

490
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:05,468
It's Gru with boobs!

491
00:30:06,302 --> 00:30:10,336
Now, feast your eyes on…

492
00:30:10,337 --> 00:30:15,733
Dad's lair!
Ta-da!

493
00:30:15,734 --> 00:30:21,373
Whoa whoa whoa, wait…
So our dad was a villain?

494
00:30:21,374 --> 00:30:23,685
No, no, no.
Not just a villain.

495
00:30:23,686 --> 00:30:27,272
But one of the greatest
of all time!

496
00:30:27,273 --> 00:30:31,540
He was known
as the Bald terror.

497
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:34,749
That's him?
Our dad?

498
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:39,016
He was so proud of you.
And what a great villain you were.

499
00:30:39,017 --> 00:30:40,400
He was?

500
00:30:40,401 --> 00:30:43,747
But me…
not so much

501
00:30:43,748 --> 00:30:49,381
To Dad, I was just a failure.

502
00:30:49,382 --> 00:30:52,374
He never thought I had
what it took to be a villain.

503
00:30:52,375 --> 00:30:56,242
But now you can help me
prove him wrong.

504
00:30:56,243 --> 00:31:01,234
Brother, teach me the art of villainy!

505
00:31:02,515 --> 00:31:05,773
No. No, no, no.
I can't do that.

506
00:31:05,774 --> 00:31:10,741
What? But it's our family tradition!
You can't say no to that!

507
00:31:10,742 --> 00:31:14,293
Look, I'm sorry.
I've left that life behind me.

508
00:31:14,294 --> 00:31:16,967
- End of story.
- Oh.

509
00:31:17,607 --> 00:31:20,097
Okay.
I understand.

510
00:31:20,098 --> 00:31:23,025
Hmmm…
I wonder what this does?

511
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:24,312
Huh?

512
00:31:24,313 --> 00:31:25,469
Help.
Help!

513
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,645
No no no...

514
00:31:26,646 --> 00:31:29,668
- Aaah!
- Aah!

515
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,743
Holey moley!

516
00:31:40,744 --> 00:31:45,720
Dad's villain wheels.
Pretty slick, huh?

517
00:31:45,721 --> 00:31:48,144
Hey, you want to
take her out for a spin?

518
00:31:48,145 --> 00:31:50,427
Just for some fun?

519
00:31:51,148 --> 00:31:53,591
Hmmmmm…

520
00:31:54,023 --> 00:31:57,752
Woo-hoo!

521
00:31:58,439 --> 00:32:00,209
Look out!
Whoa! Whoa!

522
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,836
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

523
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,477
What a beautiful day!

524
00:32:05,478 --> 00:32:09,953
Zero to 400 in 3 seconds.
Able to withstand a nuclear blast,

525
00:32:09,954 --> 00:32:12,337
armed to the teeth!

526
00:32:13,486 --> 00:32:15,847
Oh yeah.
That's pretty nice.

527
00:32:15,848 --> 00:32:19,646
- And it's a hybrid.
- LOOK OUT!

528
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,651
Yeah!
Help me!

529
00:32:45,243 --> 00:32:49,682
I am not enjoying this...!

530
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:00,336
Whoa.
What is going on here?

531
00:33:00,337 --> 00:33:04,280
Welcome to the annual
Freedonian Cheese Festival!

532
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:05,657
Go!

533
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:13,811
Ooo. Look. Look.
Look at all the candies.

534
00:33:13,927 --> 00:33:15,753
Whoa!

535
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:19,043
Lucy, can we get these please?

536
00:33:19,044 --> 00:33:21,710
Okay, but only one each.
I mean it.

537
00:33:21,711 --> 00:33:23,779
- Awww.
- Oh, man.

538
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,162
No, I don't!
Get as many as you want,

539
00:33:26,163 --> 00:33:27,631
- I don't care!
- Yay!

540
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:28,706
Awesome!

541
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:30,868
- Um.
- What?

542
00:33:30,869 --> 00:33:34,249
It's okay to tell them no
sometimes, too, you know.

543
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,884
Moms need to be tough.

544
00:33:35,885 --> 00:33:37,761
Right. Right, tough.
Good one.

545
00:33:37,762 --> 00:33:41,414
I can totally do that. You know,
still figuring out this mom thing.

546
00:33:41,415 --> 00:33:44,108
Getting my sea legs, matie!

547
00:33:44,361 --> 00:33:46,906
It's a unicorn!

548
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:54,326
Can we go in there!
Please please please please please?

549
00:33:56,259 --> 00:33:58,514
Um, sure…
Yeah.

550
00:33:58,515 --> 00:34:01,877
But first, let's, um…
ooh, look!

551
00:34:01,878 --> 00:34:06,659
It's a traditional Freedonian dance!
How amazing does that look?

552
00:34:08,691 --> 00:34:11,434
Chee!
I love this.

553
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,851
The little girls go and get
the cheese from the little boys.

554
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,915
That's adorable.

555
00:34:18,819 --> 00:34:21,182
Oh, look at that
poor little guy.

556
00:34:21,183 --> 00:34:25,000
With his little boots.
Nobody picked him.

557
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:27,509
Margo, why don't you go up there?

558
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,934
- No way!
- Okay.

559
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,222
Wait a minute.
No.

560
00:34:32,223 --> 00:34:34,823
Go take a bite of
his cheese, young lady.

561
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:36,153
Right now.

562
00:34:36,154 --> 00:34:36,985
What?

563
00:34:36,986 --> 00:34:39,120
I'm being tougher.
You know, like you said.

564
00:34:39,121 --> 00:34:42,193
No. I meant be tougher
on them, not me.

565
00:34:42,194 --> 00:34:45,848
Oh, come on, just do it.
What's the worst that could happen?

566
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:49,848
Fine.

567
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:51,627
Huh!

568
00:34:53,864 --> 00:34:56,191
Wow!

569
00:34:56,442 --> 00:34:58,853
Hey there, I'm Margo.

570
00:34:58,854 --> 00:35:00,699
Hello, Margo.

571
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:05,320
I am Niko.
Would you like some of my cheese?

572
00:35:06,254 --> 00:35:07,441
Hmmm...

573
00:35:07,442 --> 00:35:11,577
Yes, yes, yes!
Thank you, Margo! Thank you!

574
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:15,021
BAM!
I am a great mother.

575
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:18,606
Did you see that, girls?
I lay down the...

576
00:35:18,631 --> 00:35:21,411
Oh no…
Where are they?

577
00:35:21,446 --> 00:35:24,162
Agnes!
Edith!

578
00:35:26,463 --> 00:35:28,041
Hello.

579
00:35:29,957 --> 00:35:33,728
Uh, look!
A unicorn horn!

580
00:35:35,499 --> 00:35:38,288
My little brain
is going to explode!

581
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:41,155
Ugh, Agnes.
That's a fake.

582
00:35:41,156 --> 00:35:44,797
Ohhhh, it's real alright.

583
00:35:44,798 --> 00:35:48,385
That horn
came from the Crooked Forest.

584
00:35:48,386 --> 00:35:53,927
The only place on earth
where unicorns still live.

585
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,274
Laugh!
Laugh, all of you!

586
00:36:02,802 --> 00:36:04,747
They all think I'm crazy.

587
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:08,167
But I'm telling you,
I saw one once.

588
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:10,109
With my own eye!

589
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:13,568
Wait, wait, wait…
You saw a for-real, live unicorn?

590
00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:15,016
What did it look like?

591
00:36:15,017 --> 00:36:17,135
Did you pet it?
Did it smell like candy?

592
00:36:17,136 --> 00:36:20,200
Was it… fluffy?

593
00:36:20,201 --> 00:36:25,447
It was so fluffy
I thought I was going to die.

594
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:28,250
Do you think maybe
I could find one, too?

595
00:36:28,294 --> 00:36:33,191
They say if a maiden pure of heart
goes into the Crooked Forest,

596
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:39,562
the unicorn will come…
and be hers forever.

597
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,613
Agnes!

598
00:36:52,757 --> 00:36:54,368
Goal!

599
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:56,268
Excuse me!

600
00:36:56,566 --> 00:36:58,790
Girls!
Don't worry, I'm here!

601
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:00,576
Are you okay?

602
00:37:00,592 --> 00:37:03,819
Yeah, we're fine.
Are you?

603
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:10,184
Unicorns are really real!
And I'm gonna find one!!

604
00:37:10,185 --> 00:37:12,828
Sorry, I went a little
mama bear on you.

605
00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:14,776
You know, I heard a scream and…

606
00:37:14,777 --> 00:37:16,845
yeah, okay.
Have a good one!

607
00:37:21,046 --> 00:37:23,125
- Wait for me here!
- Don't.

608
00:37:23,126 --> 00:37:26,422
Stop that! Ow!
You kicked me.

609
00:37:27,627 --> 00:37:30,500
Hey! Hey!
What are you doing?

610
00:37:30,741 --> 00:37:32,613
Did you just steal candies?

611
00:37:32,614 --> 00:37:33,290
Yes!

612
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:36,561
That was a lot of
effort for two lollipops.

613
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,801
Oh no!
The police!

614
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,872
What do we do?
What do we do?

615
00:37:44,873 --> 00:37:48,407
Come on!
This is going to be fun!

616
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,654
The police are going to get us!
I'm freaking out!

617
00:38:00,655 --> 00:38:02,343
Brakes!

618
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:06,197
Cops!

619
00:38:21,406 --> 00:38:23,572
Whoa, they're back!

620
00:38:47,628 --> 00:38:49,856
Man, that was crazy!

621
00:38:49,857 --> 00:38:52,501
- We're so close to getting busted.
- Tell me about it.

622
00:38:52,502 --> 00:38:55,439
I thought you were
going to pee your pants!

623
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,543
- I did!
- You did!

624
00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:07,738
Mel, food...

625
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,147
Ugh. Hey, Mel.
Hold on a sec.

626
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,597
We're tired, cold, and hungry.

627
00:39:12,598 --> 00:39:14,807
- Mel, hungry.
- Mel, hungry.

628
00:39:15,095 --> 00:39:18,347
It's pizza. Over there.
Our food, spaghetti!

629
00:39:18,624 --> 00:39:21,781
Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

630
00:39:23,782 --> 00:39:26,332
Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

631
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:28,452
Hey!
What are you doing?

632
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:31,089
Intruders!
Intruders!

633
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,197
Stop!
Hey, you! Don't move!

634
00:39:39,198 --> 00:39:40,579
Halt!

635
00:39:46,107 --> 00:39:47,911
Call for backup!

636
00:39:47,912 --> 00:39:50,988
Come on. Come on.
Let's go, keep going.

637
00:39:53,371 --> 00:39:54,792
What's this?

638
00:40:05,526 --> 00:40:08,061
Happy? It's on you.
Do something.

639
00:40:08,062 --> 00:40:11,356
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

640
00:40:50,358 --> 00:40:52,421
Get 'em!
Go! Go!

641
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,920
Hey, you!
Freeze!

642
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,617
Don't move!

643
00:41:33,384 --> 00:41:35,483
Hands in the air!

644
00:41:42,746 --> 00:41:46,523
Face it, Gru.
Villainy is in your blood.

645
00:41:46,524 --> 00:41:49,533
You can't tell me you don't
miss the rush.  A little?

646
00:41:49,534 --> 00:41:52,623
Well…
Yeah, maybe a little.

647
00:41:52,624 --> 00:41:55,392
And now you've got a chance
to get back on top.

648
00:41:55,393 --> 00:41:58,238
Get your mojo back.
Become Gru again!

649
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:01,302
How awesome would that be?

650
00:42:02,734 --> 00:42:07,014
Oh please, come on,
just one heist.

651
00:42:07,015 --> 00:42:10,945
There's got to be something
out there, somewhere,

652
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:14,395
that you still want to steal.

653
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:19,426
Hmmmm…
There is something.

654
00:42:19,427 --> 00:42:25,636
 How about we steal
the largest diamond in the world?

655
00:42:25,637 --> 00:42:28,614
Yes!
I love it!

656
00:42:28,775 --> 00:42:30,311
Oh, thank you, Brother!

657
00:42:30,312 --> 00:42:33,570
Thank you from the
bottom of my heart!

658
00:42:35,555 --> 00:42:38,774
Oh! You know what?
We should do something to celebrate.

659
00:42:38,775 --> 00:42:43,236
Ohhhh.
I've got the perfect idea.

660
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:46,991
Fritz, my good fellow.

661
00:42:46,992 --> 00:42:48,801
Could you get me
another napkin, please?

662
00:42:48,802 --> 00:42:51,467
Oh yes, of course, Miss Edith.

663
00:42:58,359 --> 00:42:59,968
Hey, where are Gru and Dru?

664
00:42:59,969 --> 00:43:02,413
Here we are!

665
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:04,492
How's it going?

666
00:43:05,304 --> 00:43:07,135
It's me, Gru.

667
00:43:07,136 --> 00:43:09,857
And me, Dru.

668
00:43:10,027 --> 00:43:14,135
I hug everybody whether
they like it or not.

669
00:43:14,136 --> 00:43:17,005
Why are they pretending
to be each other?

670
00:43:17,201 --> 00:43:18,296
Oh!

671
00:43:18,297 --> 00:43:21,601
What's for dinner?
I probably won't like it.

672
00:43:21,602 --> 00:43:24,516
 I'm so grumpy all the time!

673
00:43:24,517 --> 00:43:26,815
Hey!
I laugh a lot!

674
00:43:26,816 --> 00:43:29,623
And I'm kind of an idiot!

675
00:43:39,076 --> 00:43:40,950
Oh, a bust in the gut.

676
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:45,137
Look at them!
They had no idea!

677
00:43:45,138 --> 00:43:46,722
Total burn.

678
00:43:46,723 --> 00:43:48,827
Oh, look,
it's me...Gru!

679
00:43:48,828 --> 00:43:52,317
And I'm Dru!
We switched places!

680
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:54,732
Awww. It's so nice to see
you two are getting along

681
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:58,317
- Oh, we're getting...
- Along perfectly.

682
00:43:58,318 --> 00:43:59,830
- Wait. Did we...
- Just finish...

683
00:43:59,831 --> 00:44:00,852
- Each...
- Other's...

684
00:44:00,853 --> 00:44:02,501
- Sentences?
- Sentences?

685
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,881
Aw, that's delightful.
Not creepy at all.

686
00:44:05,882 --> 00:44:07,339
And you're gonna stop now,
though, right?

687
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,621
Sorry, it's a twin thing.

688
00:44:09,622 --> 00:44:11,195
Uh-huh.

689
00:44:11,196 --> 00:44:15,050
So...
what did you guys do today?

690
00:44:15,051 --> 00:44:17,036
- Nothing!
- Nothing!

691
00:44:17,164 --> 00:44:18,282
Okay.
What is it...

692
00:44:18,283 --> 00:44:19,847
All done!

693
00:44:20,152 --> 00:44:21,090
Pardon me!

694
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:23,072
Out of the way!
Good night, everybody!

695
00:44:23,073 --> 00:44:25,647
Hey, hey, hey, put the brakes on.
What's the rush?

696
00:44:25,648 --> 00:44:28,455
I need to go to bed so I can
wake up and find a unicorn!

697
00:44:28,456 --> 00:44:30,237
Good night!

698
00:44:31,573 --> 00:44:33,052
What was that about?

699
00:44:33,053 --> 00:44:36,953
Agnes thinks she's going to find
a real unicorn in the woods tomorrow.

700
00:44:36,954 --> 00:44:39,138
She's totally freaking out.

701
00:44:39,139 --> 00:44:41,535
I feel like someone got's to
tell her the truth.…

702
00:44:41,536 --> 00:44:42,888
Not it!

703
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,576
Ohhh, don't worry.

704
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:47,860
Parenting 101.
I've got this.

705
00:44:49,404 --> 00:44:52,712
Ummm… And please bless that
when I find the unicorn,

706
00:44:52,713 --> 00:44:55,758
he'll want to come home with me.
And sleep in my room.

707
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:59,031
And that I can ride him
to school every day.

708
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:02,730
And he will use his magical powers
to help me do math.

709
00:45:02,731 --> 00:45:04,251
Amen.

710
00:45:06,397 --> 00:45:08,474
Oh.
Hi, Gru.

711
00:45:08,813 --> 00:45:12,844
Hey.
So… big day tomorrow.

712
00:45:12,845 --> 00:45:15,512
Yeah, I'm finally going to
get to see a unicorn!

713
00:45:15,513 --> 00:45:17,232
 For reals.

714
00:45:17,345 --> 00:45:20,424
If I do, can I bring it home,
please?

715
00:45:20,425 --> 00:45:22,555
Ohhh.
Yeah, sure.

716
00:45:22,556 --> 00:45:25,418
Tell you what,
every unicorn you find,

717
00:45:25,419 --> 00:45:27,198
you can bring it home.

718
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:30,657
I'd better build a big pen, right?

719
00:45:31,077 --> 00:45:33,679
But you know…

720
00:45:33,704 --> 00:45:37,517
there's a chance that
you might not find one.

721
00:45:37,881 --> 00:45:39,394
Huh?

722
00:45:39,859 --> 00:45:41,063
I'm...

723
00:45:41,064 --> 00:45:45,858
It might not be good
unicorn finding weather.

724
00:45:47,014 --> 00:45:48,200
Umm.

725
00:45:48,201 --> 00:45:51,573
They're tricky to find them…

726
00:45:51,574 --> 00:45:53,559
and I don't know…

727
00:45:53,560 --> 00:46:03,051
Maybe, just...
maybe unicorns don't really ex...

728
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:08,422
...explore that part of the woods.

729
00:46:10,337 --> 00:46:12,648
But the man said

730
00:46:12,649 --> 00:46:15,846
a maiden could find one
if she was pure of heart.

731
00:46:15,847 --> 00:46:18,828
And I'm pure of heart, right?

732
00:46:19,267 --> 00:46:21,394
The purest.

733
00:46:25,232 --> 00:46:28,743
Can we stop talking now?
I need to get to sleep.

734
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,388
Goodnight, sweetie.

735
00:46:30,389 --> 00:46:32,477
Goodnight, Gru.

736
00:46:33,071 --> 00:46:38,910
Unicorns I love them.
Unicorns I love them.

737
00:46:38,911 --> 00:46:41,210
Huh!
Aaaah!

738
00:46:42,613 --> 00:46:44,505
I'm okay.

739
00:46:51,336 --> 00:46:52,479
Uh.

740
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,452
Hey!
Give that back!

741
00:46:54,453 --> 00:46:55,845
Huh?
Come on!

742
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:58,365
Guys!
Don't leave me!

743
00:46:59,143 --> 00:47:01,457
Oh, no!
Run!

744
00:47:26,597 --> 00:47:29,104
We've been waiting a long time.

745
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,794
No. No.
Ow!

746
00:47:30,795 --> 00:47:32,291
No.
Please, don't.

747
00:47:32,292 --> 00:47:33,667
Huh!

748
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:35,782
Gru?

749
00:47:57,843 --> 00:48:00,902
My plane... broke.

750
00:48:09,259 --> 00:48:10,830
Oh.

751
00:48:12,129 --> 00:48:13,412
Uh?

752
00:48:13,413 --> 00:48:14,875
Huh!

753
00:48:24,762 --> 00:48:26,426
Buddies, I've decided.

754
00:48:26,427 --> 00:48:31,056
We're going back to Gru.
We're going back to Gru!

755
00:48:35,892 --> 00:48:39,689
Because I'm training for
the big day,

756
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:42,440
nobody's gonna stop me

757
00:48:42,441 --> 00:48:48,179
'cause I am super sassy.
Super sassy. Super sassy.

758
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,240
What's today's plan, boss?

759
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:51,936
What's the plan?

760
00:48:51,937 --> 00:48:54,215
Silly robot.
I'll show you the plan.

761
00:48:54,216 --> 00:48:57,320
Time to watch a very
special episode of Evil Bratt

762
00:48:57,321 --> 00:49:01,430
to see exactly what I'm going
to do to stupid Tinseltown.

763
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:06,045
This week on Evil Bratt.

764
00:49:07,198 --> 00:49:12,725
It's a giant Evil Bratt robot!
Open fire!

765
00:49:17,116 --> 00:49:20,873
Nice try, coppers.
Chew on this!

766
00:49:22,956 --> 00:49:27,323
He's shooting his super sticky
self inflating gum!

767
00:49:27,498 --> 00:49:29,331
Run!

768
00:49:29,649 --> 00:49:32,359
Gum one!
Gum all!

769
00:49:33,986 --> 00:49:35,411
Gum one.
Gum all.

770
00:49:35,412 --> 00:49:39,251
Seriously, how did this show
never win an Emmy?

771
00:49:41,205 --> 00:49:46,018
And now, it's your turn
to shine, my diamond!

772
00:49:57,071 --> 00:49:58,087
Hey, Clive.

773
00:49:58,088 --> 00:50:02,670
I guess you can say our plan
was... out of this world.

774
00:50:06,279 --> 00:50:08,619
Now that's entertainment.

775
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:11,753
Come on.
Let's make it a reality.

776
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:18,407
Here we are, in the dark
and creepy Crooked Forest,

777
00:50:18,408 --> 00:50:20,640
in search of the
mythical unicorn.

778
00:50:20,641 --> 00:50:22,151
For some reason.

779
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:25,563
And here she is,
the fearless unicorn hunter, seeking the...

780
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:26,996
Edith, stop it!

781
00:50:26,997 --> 00:50:29,230
You're gonna scare away the unicorn!

782
00:50:29,231 --> 00:50:31,685
If somehow we actually
find a unicorn,

783
00:50:31,686 --> 00:50:33,668
I'm gonna film it
and get rich.

784
00:50:33,669 --> 00:50:35,748
Look over there!

785
00:50:35,794 --> 00:50:37,867
Wooah!

786
00:50:38,051 --> 00:50:40,968
This is it!
This is where we're gonna see it!

787
00:50:41,237 --> 00:50:44,428
Unicorns, here we come.

788
00:50:44,429 --> 00:50:45,419
What's that for?

789
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,442
Bait.
Duh.

790
00:50:47,443 --> 00:50:49,081
Come on!

791
00:50:50,953 --> 00:50:53,719
Now all we have
to do is wait.

792
00:50:57,296 --> 00:50:59,044
Okay.
This is Bratt's lair.

793
00:50:59,045 --> 00:51:01,125
It may not look like much,
but this place is armed

794
00:51:01,126 --> 00:51:04,297
with some of the most high-tech
weaponry known to man.

795
00:51:04,298 --> 00:51:06,484
It's considered impenetrable.

796
00:51:06,485 --> 00:51:09,550
But a piece of cake for us,
right, Brother?

797
00:51:09,551 --> 00:51:14,001
This is not like stealing lollipops.

798
00:51:14,903 --> 00:51:17,103
Whoa!

799
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:23,695
This security system can detect
an air assault from any direction.

800
00:51:24,952 --> 00:51:26,547
No!
Ouch!

801
00:51:26,548 --> 00:51:28,133
No!
Ouch!

802
00:51:28,134 --> 00:51:31,024
Please! Stop!
Ouch!

803
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:35,514
So we'll have to approach low
and close to the water.

804
00:51:35,515 --> 00:51:36,894
Next.

805
00:51:38,389 --> 00:51:40,714
Then there are these deadly spikes.

806
00:51:40,715 --> 00:51:43,729
Ha ha ha ha!
Geronimo!

807
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:48,454
Covered with enough poison
to blow your mind... literally.

808
00:51:48,455 --> 00:51:50,474
Ouch!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

809
00:51:50,475 --> 00:51:51,947
Ah...
Good to know.

810
00:51:51,948 --> 00:51:53,186
So here's the plan.

811
00:51:53,187 --> 00:51:56,313
You're the getaway driver.

812
00:51:56,314 --> 00:51:57,778
So you'll wait in the boat.

813
00:51:57,779 --> 00:51:59,985
Wait, hold on.
Wait in the boat?

814
00:51:59,986 --> 00:52:03,830
But... I want to be
in on the actions!

815
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:08,266
The getaway driver is the
most crucial part of any plan.

816
00:52:08,267 --> 00:52:12,847
Do you know how hard it is
doing nothing, touching nothing,

817
00:52:12,848 --> 00:52:15,938
with all of the adrenaline
coursing through your veins…

818
00:52:15,939 --> 00:52:17,677
and you must wait.

819
00:52:17,678 --> 00:52:19,843
Can I count on you?

820
00:52:20,644 --> 00:52:22,490
I guess so…

821
00:52:22,491 --> 00:52:26,312
So... I'll climb up the cube
and enter here.

822
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:28,934
Then once I'm inside,
I'll find the diamond.

823
00:52:28,935 --> 00:52:33,058
 I've underestimated Bratt before.
It's not going to be easy.

824
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:35,934
I think we can handle it.

825
00:52:37,807 --> 00:52:41,625
Dad's villain suits!
This will make us unstoppable.

826
00:52:41,626 --> 00:52:43,912
Whoa.
Ay, chihuahua!

827
00:52:43,913 --> 00:52:45,868
I call the black one!

828
00:52:48,096 --> 00:52:51,023
It's go time!

829
00:53:00,725 --> 00:53:03,304
Hello.
Oh, hi.

830
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:06,420
Hello, mother of Margo.
I am Niko.

831
00:53:06,421 --> 00:53:11,515
I present you with pig to confirm
my engagement to your daughter.

832
00:53:13,821 --> 00:53:15,361
- Hey, what now?
- What's going on?

833
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:16,854
Remember, little boots?

834
00:53:16,855 --> 00:53:20,280
- Hello, my schmoopsie poo.
- Whoa! Hey!

835
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:22,867
He seems to think you're engaged.

836
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,526
What?
We're not engaged!

837
00:53:25,527 --> 00:53:28,608
Look, Niko.
You seem like a very nice boy

838
00:53:28,609 --> 00:53:30,155
With a very nice pig.

839
00:53:30,156 --> 00:53:32,702
Uh, but you're not engaged.

840
00:53:33,164 --> 00:53:35,781
Okay?
It's not happening.

841
00:53:35,806 --> 00:53:38,867
I understand.
Who was I kidding?

842
00:53:38,868 --> 00:53:42,948
A dumpling like me with
a goddess like you?

843
00:53:42,949 --> 00:53:47,317
But I promise:
I will never forget you, Margo.

844
00:53:47,318 --> 00:53:48,960
Never.

845
00:53:50,084 --> 00:53:52,780
Oh, I'm pretty sure
I won't forget you, either.

846
00:53:52,781 --> 00:53:55,117
Bye.
Bye, Niko.

847
00:53:55,118 --> 00:53:57,624
Wow, that was crazy!
Wooo!

848
00:53:57,625 --> 00:53:59,863
That was totally humiliating!

849
00:53:59,864 --> 00:54:03,106
Taking a bite of that cheese was
the stupidest thing I've ever done.

850
00:54:03,107 --> 00:54:04,526
Why did I listen to you?

851
00:54:04,527 --> 00:54:06,943
Right, but it's over now, so...

852
00:54:06,944 --> 00:54:09,933
Ugh, here we go.
Niko...

853
00:54:10,404 --> 00:54:14,067
You!
You refuse my son's engagement pig?

854
00:54:14,068 --> 00:54:14,695
What?

855
00:54:14,696 --> 00:54:20,125
May you and your daughter die
a slow death and be buried with onions!

856
00:54:21,979 --> 00:54:23,709
Alright, lady.
That's it!

857
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:29,136
Nobody... nobody! ...curses my daughter!
You got that?

858
00:54:29,137 --> 00:54:32,117
Because if you mess with Margo,
you mess with me!

859
00:54:32,118 --> 00:54:36,570
 And I promise, you do not
want to mess with me!

860
00:54:36,571 --> 00:54:38,932
 Do you understand me?

861
00:54:38,933 --> 00:54:40,069
Yes, yes.

862
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:43,174
Good.
Now, GET!

863
00:54:46,229 --> 00:54:49,350
Look, Margo.
I think we just need to... Oh.

864
00:54:52,646 --> 00:54:53,966
Yes!

865
00:54:53,967 --> 00:54:56,554
Oh!
I've to tell Gru!

866
00:55:12,202 --> 00:55:14,892
- Can we go back now?
- Already?

867
00:55:14,893 --> 00:55:16,621
Just a couple more hours!

868
00:55:16,622 --> 00:55:19,307
We have to be home
before it gets dark.

869
00:55:19,971 --> 00:55:22,001
I don't understand.

870
00:55:22,002 --> 00:55:24,344
I did exactly
what the man said.

871
00:55:24,345 --> 00:55:27,791
You mean that one-eyed, scar-faced man
that everybody laughed at?

872
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:30,013
Yeah.
It makes no sense.

873
00:55:30,014 --> 00:55:32,901
- Look, Agnes, maybe we're not...
- Huh!

874
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:47,644
My whole life has been
building to this moment!

875
00:55:53,297 --> 00:55:54,551
Um.
It's a...

876
00:55:54,552 --> 00:55:56,561
Unicorn!

877
00:55:58,194 --> 00:56:00,512
I can't believe it!

878
00:56:00,737 --> 00:56:03,517
I'm gonna name you Lucky!

879
00:56:03,518 --> 00:56:06,856
Oh, Lucky, stop it...

880
00:56:07,703 --> 00:56:10,860
Yeah.
I'll let someone else burst her bubble.

881
00:56:17,292 --> 00:56:21,046
Look at us!
Two brothers pulling a heist.

882
00:56:21,047 --> 00:56:26,689
And that diamond will make us
the richest, most powerful villains in the world!

883
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:28,397
Right, Brother?

884
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:32,557
Right.
Yeah. Yeah...

885
00:56:35,831 --> 00:56:39,732
Bravo! Bravissimo!
You're amazing!

886
00:56:39,757 --> 00:56:42,176
I'm so sorry. I'm so embarrassed.
I was very rude.

887
00:56:42,177 --> 00:56:44,410
- And you were always such a gentleman.
- You did it! You did it!

888
00:56:44,411 --> 00:56:46,516
You got our jobs back.

889
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:54,931
What? Oh yeah.
Right. Sure.

890
00:56:54,932 --> 00:56:56,915
Oh look, we're here!

891
00:57:03,607 --> 00:57:06,060
I'm going in.
Take the wheel.

892
00:57:06,061 --> 00:57:08,647
I still don't see
why I can't go with you.

893
00:57:08,648 --> 00:57:10,201
Hey.
Hey, we discussed this.

894
00:57:10,202 --> 00:57:12,680
Now is not the time
to mess with the plan.

895
00:57:12,681 --> 00:57:14,668
Fine...

896
00:57:27,703 --> 00:57:29,518
- Hey, brother.
- What?

897
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:32,282
 I told you, you were
supposed to stay with the boat!

898
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:35,202
Oh, I didn't think
you meant that literally.

899
00:57:35,203 --> 00:57:37,822
What other way
could I have meant it?

900
00:57:38,227 --> 00:57:41,527
Alright. Let's move.
Just follow my lead.

901
00:57:41,528 --> 00:57:43,275
Got it.

902
00:57:46,474 --> 00:57:48,664
Help me!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

903
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:50,709
Oh no!
The poison spikes!

904
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:53,573
 Oh, I'm gonna be impaled!

905
00:57:55,249 --> 00:57:57,784
Ha ha!
I'm okay!

906
00:57:57,924 --> 00:57:59,821
I miss the Minions.

907
00:57:59,846 --> 00:58:01,365
Come on!

908
00:58:07,161 --> 00:58:08,942
Coming.

909
00:58:14,468 --> 00:58:16,171
Coming.

910
00:58:20,436 --> 00:58:22,033
Come on.

911
00:58:27,401 --> 00:58:29,132
It's a scanning device!

912
00:58:29,133 --> 00:58:31,453
Quick... camouflage mode.

913
00:58:31,623 --> 00:58:33,624
Freeze!
And close your eyes.

914
00:58:33,625 --> 00:58:35,637
And cover your mouth!

915
00:58:41,203 --> 00:58:43,403
Okay.
Take my hand!

916
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:09,435
Ha ha.
Follow me!

917
00:59:25,827 --> 00:59:27,322
Ha ha.

918
00:59:32,427 --> 00:59:34,452
Look out!

919
00:59:38,126 --> 00:59:41,478
You're right.
I should've stay in the boat.

920
00:59:41,479 --> 00:59:44,321
My stomach feels all queasy.

921
00:59:44,322 --> 00:59:48,361
I shouldn't have eaten
that hot pie.

922
00:59:48,539 --> 00:59:51,078
Hey. Hey.
Relax.

923
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:55,120
You're going to be just fine.
I got your back.

924
01:00:01,078 --> 01:00:03,045
Come on, this way.

925
01:00:04,793 --> 01:00:06,706
Gru would take this.
Gru would take that.

926
01:00:06,707 --> 01:00:08,319
Go, go, go!

927
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,091
Eh.
Peter, that way.

928
01:00:10,092 --> 01:00:11,955
Oh, okay, okay.

929
01:00:33,034 --> 01:00:34,912
Go, go.
Go, go, go!

930
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,584
Huh?
Hey, come back.

931
01:00:59,443 --> 01:01:02,937
Hello. Hello.
Hello.

932
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:11,213
You jacket is located
within easy reach.

933
01:01:11,238 --> 01:01:14,258
Inflate your jacket by pulling the toggle.
Like this...

934
01:01:14,283 --> 01:01:16,784
Thank you for your attention,
enjoy your flight.

935
01:01:22,364 --> 01:01:26,430
Straight ahead. Straight ahead.
Straight ahead.

936
01:01:27,738 --> 01:01:30,477
Bud-Buddy.
Bud-Buddy!

937
01:01:30,891 --> 01:01:34,116
Buddy!!!

938
01:01:34,355 --> 01:01:36,125
It looks like
it's right above us.

939
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:38,725
Okay! What do I do?
Should I wait in the vent?

940
01:01:38,726 --> 01:01:40,699
No.
Come with me.

941
01:01:55,763 --> 01:01:58,482
Yes, I'd like to
thank the Academy.

942
01:02:00,517 --> 01:02:02,137
- I can...
- No no no no no...

943
01:02:02,138 --> 01:02:04,605
- Why? I can do it.
- Don't, don't, don't!

944
01:02:04,606 --> 01:02:07,774
Yes, yes, Molly Ringwald.
I will take you to the prom.

945
01:02:07,775 --> 01:02:09,634
What... Who…
Where... What...

946
01:02:09,635 --> 01:02:11,543
 Who's there…?
 Who's there…?

947
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,370
Ninety nine red balloons...

948
01:02:21,371 --> 01:02:23,399
Whoops!
Almost forgot.

949
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:36,410
Shhh, shhh.
Over here!

950
01:02:37,827 --> 01:02:39,565
Stay close!

951
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,730
Huh!
Whaaa...

952
01:02:43,755 --> 01:02:45,128
Dolls.

953
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:49,012
Looks like Bratt was the only one
stupid enough to buy this junk.

954
01:02:49,013 --> 01:02:52,161
Oh.
I used to have one of these!

955
01:02:52,162 --> 01:02:54,531
Pew pew pew!

956
01:02:54,532 --> 01:02:57,423
Aaah!
Oww!

957
01:02:57,424 --> 01:02:59,843
Hey! Shh!
Come on!

958
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:10,253
Alright.
We're getting close.

959
01:03:10,254 --> 01:03:14,844
From now on, every move must be
made with ultra precision and purpose.

960
01:03:16,423 --> 01:03:17,687
Gum!

961
01:03:17,688 --> 01:03:19,120
Focus!

962
01:03:19,121 --> 01:03:21,744
We're after the diamond,
not the bubble gum!

963
01:03:21,745 --> 01:03:23,610
Ah, got it.

964
01:03:25,721 --> 01:03:27,902
Mmm.
Yum.

965
01:03:28,709 --> 01:03:30,375
This way!

966
01:03:30,784 --> 01:03:34,291
And now to put this
where it belongs.

967
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:36,183
What?

968
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:40,022
Look at it, Clive.
It's beautiful!

969
01:03:45,685 --> 01:03:48,851
Will you please shut up?
He's gonna spot us.

970
01:03:50,821 --> 01:03:54,481
Spit it out! Spit it out!
I told you not to touch anything!

971
01:03:57,372 --> 01:04:00,909
Intruders! Intruders!
Intruders!

972
01:04:02,609 --> 01:04:04,736
Freeze, dipsticks!

973
01:04:04,737 --> 01:04:07,312
Gru!
There's two of you now?

974
01:04:07,313 --> 01:04:10,264
 Then this will be
twice as much fun.

975
01:04:16,751 --> 01:04:19,031
Aaaaah!
Give me back my diamond!

976
01:04:19,032 --> 01:04:21,024
Total lockdown!!

977
01:04:21,025 --> 01:04:23,387
 Go get 'em, Bratt Pack!!

978
01:04:31,475 --> 01:04:34,767
They're gonna get us!
They're gonna get us!

979
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,862
Run!

980
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:48,853
Oh no…

981
01:04:48,854 --> 01:04:52,017
Oh no?
What does that mean?

982
01:04:52,042 --> 01:04:55,251
ARE WE GONNA DIE??
ARE WE GONNA DIE??

983
01:04:55,276 --> 01:04:57,366
WE'RE GONNA DIE!!

984
01:05:06,553 --> 01:05:07,972
What?

985
01:05:08,259 --> 01:05:10,506
Hey, guys.
Hold on!

986
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:12,614
Lucy!

987
01:05:19,114 --> 01:05:21,915
Thank you for saving us!
Woo!

988
01:05:21,916 --> 01:05:24,457
“Look! We got the diamond!
And we're going to...

989
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:28,199
Take it to the AVL
and get our jobs back!

990
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,002
Wait!

991
01:05:29,003 --> 01:05:30,620
What?
That's amazing!

992
01:05:30,621 --> 01:05:33,830
And the best part is
you are never ever

993
01:05:33,831 --> 01:05:37,791
go behind my back
ever again!

994
01:05:37,816 --> 01:05:40,838
- Right, honeybear?
- Yup! Yup! Right.

995
01:05:40,857 --> 01:05:42,677
Lesson learned.

996
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:58,186
I'll get the girls and start packing
and tell them the good news!

997
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:00,400
Ah, we're getting
our jobs back, yeah!

998
01:06:00,401 --> 01:06:03,078
Yes. Yes.
Go tell the girls.

999
01:06:03,999 --> 01:06:04,765
Dru.

1000
01:06:04,766 --> 01:06:07,879
No. No way!
We can't give the diamond back!

1001
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,413
- I have to.
- No, you don't!

1002
01:06:10,414 --> 01:06:12,449
- Yes, I do.
- Give it.

1003
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:13,847
- No!
- Give it!

1004
01:06:13,848 --> 01:06:15,764
Ow!
What is wrong with you?

1005
01:06:15,765 --> 01:06:17,091
What is wrong with you?

1006
01:06:17,092 --> 01:06:18,052
You kicked me!

1007
01:06:18,053 --> 01:06:19,493
You-You lied to me.

1008
01:06:19,494 --> 01:06:21,456
Hey.
I would have told you the truth.

1009
01:06:21,457 --> 01:06:24,403
But you're too much
of a wimp to handle it.

1010
01:06:24,404 --> 01:06:25,918
That's it, I'm out of here.

1011
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:28,934
You have no right to take that,
we stole it together.

1012
01:06:28,935 --> 01:06:30,727
Together?

1013
01:06:30,937 --> 01:06:32,278
You got to be kidding me.

1014
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:34,521
You did nothing but
screwed up the whole time.

1015
01:06:34,522 --> 01:06:36,281
I got this
in spite of you.

1016
01:06:36,282 --> 01:06:39,295
Oh, yeah?
Well, at least I didn't get fired

1017
01:06:39,296 --> 01:06:41,682
from my job
like a total loser.

1018
01:06:41,683 --> 01:06:43,392
At least I had a job.

1019
01:06:43,393 --> 01:06:45,489
What have you accomplished
that was so great?

1020
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:48,870
I'll tell you what:
Nothing!

1021
01:06:48,892 --> 01:06:52,653
No wonder Dad thought
you were such a failure.

1022
01:06:54,315 --> 01:06:56,260
We're no longer brothers!

1023
01:06:56,261 --> 01:06:58,329
That's fine with me!

1024
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:44,468
Gru!
I found a unicorn!

1025
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:48,481
My life is complete!

1026
01:07:50,614 --> 01:07:55,363
Honey, that's...
that's not actually a unicorn.

1027
01:07:55,388 --> 01:07:56,799
Huh?

1028
01:07:57,045 --> 01:08:00,829
But-But he has one horn.

1029
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:03,923
I'm-I'm sorry, sweetie,
but...

1030
01:08:03,924 --> 01:08:06,762
he's just a goat.

1031
01:08:06,763 --> 01:08:09,902
Life is just like that sometimes.

1032
01:08:09,903 --> 01:08:12,359
We're hoping for a unicorn

1033
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,822
and we get a goat.

1034
01:08:16,434 --> 01:08:18,592
Well, you know what?

1035
01:08:18,593 --> 01:08:22,707
Lucky is the best goat
in the whole wide world!

1036
01:08:22,708 --> 01:08:27,221
Look at that face!
I just want to squeeze it.

1037
01:08:31,335 --> 01:08:33,044
I'll take this.

1038
01:08:33,045 --> 01:08:36,164
You've been a bad boy, Gru.

1039
01:08:36,165 --> 01:08:38,204
Can you get the rest
of the suitcases?

1040
01:08:38,205 --> 01:08:40,036
Come on, girls, let's go!

1041
01:08:40,037 --> 01:08:44,339
Let's get physical, physical!

1042
01:08:50,755 --> 01:08:52,875
Change of plan, girls.

1043
01:08:52,876 --> 01:08:55,060
Instead of going home...

1044
01:08:55,061 --> 01:08:57,363
Eyebrows.
Ow!

1045
01:08:57,364 --> 01:09:00,773
We're going to Hollywood!

1046
01:09:01,656 --> 01:09:04,878
Now that's what I call acting.

1047
01:09:05,249 --> 01:09:09,173
Let's go, Clive.
We've got a giant robot waiting.

1048
01:09:11,824 --> 01:09:13,156
Huh?

1049
01:09:13,812 --> 01:09:16,287
Huh?
Lucy?

1050
01:09:17,418 --> 01:09:19,166
Bratt, he took the girls!

1051
01:09:19,167 --> 01:09:21,830
What?
No!

1052
01:09:24,019 --> 01:09:25,963
Dru!
Dru!

1053
01:09:25,964 --> 01:09:28,710
Go away.
I don't want to talk to you.

1054
01:09:28,711 --> 01:09:31,337
Bratt has the girls!

1055
01:09:37,421 --> 01:09:39,431
Listen, brother.
What...

1056
01:09:39,432 --> 01:09:41,713
- About what I said.
- No, I'm the one...

1057
01:09:41,714 --> 01:09:43,503
But I shouldn't have...

1058
01:09:43,504 --> 01:09:45,989
I'm-I'm sorry.

1059
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:49,189
I'm so sorry, Gru.

1060
01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:51,233
Awww.

1061
01:09:51,382 --> 01:09:53,070
Oh, look out!

1062
01:09:53,071 --> 01:09:54,868
What is that?

1063
01:09:54,977 --> 01:09:57,572
Mel. Mel!
Infront!

1064
01:09:58,429 --> 01:10:00,246
Caramba!
Caramba!

1065
01:10:00,247 --> 01:10:02,927
CARAMBAAAAA!

1066
01:10:02,928 --> 01:10:04,140
Mel?

1067
01:10:04,141 --> 01:10:06,080
Huh?
Gru?

1068
01:10:07,232 --> 01:10:09,981
Got to turn this thing around...

1069
01:10:10,411 --> 01:10:11,514
Gru!

1070
01:10:11,515 --> 01:10:16,239
Wait up!
GRUUUUU...

1071
01:10:40,018 --> 01:10:43,476
Hello, Hollywood!

1072
01:10:43,477 --> 01:10:46,912
I'm back and bigger than ever.

1073
01:10:48,221 --> 01:10:49,794
I'm scared!

1074
01:10:49,795 --> 01:10:52,727
Thank you.
Thank you so...

1075
01:10:58,077 --> 01:11:01,607
You can't leave me here!
I'm famous!

1076
01:11:02,044 --> 01:11:04,947
Clive, arm the cannons.

1077
01:11:06,844 --> 01:11:09,739
Chew on this!

1078
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:28,677
Hey, mullet-head.
Let us out!

1079
01:11:28,678 --> 01:11:30,701
Oh, don't worry, girls.

1080
01:11:30,702 --> 01:11:34,471
I've prepared
a front row seat for you.

1081
01:11:50,011 --> 01:11:52,324
- Waaah!
- Agnes!

1082
01:11:53,183 --> 01:11:56,860
Once again, I win
and Gru loses.

1083
01:11:56,861 --> 01:11:59,494
Enjoy the show, girls.

1084
01:12:06,539 --> 01:12:08,404
- What in the heck?
- Oh!

1085
01:12:08,405 --> 01:12:10,270
I hope the girls are okay.

1086
01:12:10,271 --> 01:12:11,310
Bratt!
Brother!

1087
01:12:11,311 --> 01:12:13,586
9 o'clock.
No. 3 o'clock.

1088
01:12:13,587 --> 01:12:15,469
He's on the left!

1089
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:19,512
Huh, no.
I've seen this episode.

1090
01:12:19,513 --> 01:12:21,169
He's going to bubble gum
the whole city

1091
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,318
and send it up into space.

1092
01:12:23,319 --> 01:12:25,102
Hurry!

1093
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:37,332
This is it.
This is it.

1094
01:12:37,357 --> 01:12:39,886
Lights!
Camera!

1095
01:12:39,887 --> 01:12:41,790
LASER!

1096
01:12:51,648 --> 01:12:53,565
Yeah.

1097
01:12:59,278 --> 01:13:00,949
Look.
I got the girls.

1098
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:02,322
You two go
take care of Bratt.

1099
01:13:02,323 --> 01:13:04,445
Wait.
What are you doing?

1100
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,849
Look, you guys.
It's Lucy.

1101
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:14,266
Lucy, over here.
Help! Help us!

1102
01:13:14,267 --> 01:13:16,093
Mama's coming, girls.

1103
01:13:16,094 --> 01:13:18,540
- Lucy!
- Right here! Lucy!

1104
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:20,119
Look at that laser go.

1105
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,448
I love it when a
plan comes together.

1106
01:13:22,449 --> 01:13:25,420
Aaaah!
It's Gru!

1107
01:13:27,292 --> 01:13:28,700
Get ready, Bratt.

1108
01:13:28,701 --> 01:13:32,116
You're about to be blasted
back to the 80s.

1109
01:13:43,396 --> 01:13:46,730
Ah ho!
We got him!

1110
01:13:54,775 --> 01:13:56,149
- Oh no.
- Don't worry.

1111
01:13:56,150 --> 01:13:58,222
There's more where that came from.

1112
01:13:58,223 --> 01:14:00,862
It'll take more than
that to stop me.

1113
01:14:00,863 --> 01:14:03,967
Bratt pack,
go get that barf bag.

1114
01:14:11,559 --> 01:14:14,015
Oh, incoming!

1115
01:14:14,801 --> 01:14:16,259
Ow. Ow. Ow.

1116
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:17,963
You, little...

1117
01:14:24,988 --> 01:14:27,040
Quick!
Jump!

1118
01:14:29,061 --> 01:14:30,458
Boners!

1119
01:14:30,483 --> 01:14:33,102
Did you see that, Clive?
All gone.

1120
01:14:33,103 --> 01:14:35,485
Bye bye, Wonder Twins.

1121
01:14:53,556 --> 01:14:55,338
Whoa!
Ooh la la!

1122
01:14:55,339 --> 01:14:57,656
Look are all those giant bubbles!

1123
01:15:03,237 --> 01:15:04,726
Help!

1124
01:15:04,727 --> 01:15:05,854
Help!

1125
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,630
Hang on!

1126
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:17,407
Hang on, girls!
I got you!

1127
01:15:17,408 --> 01:15:20,490
I can't.
I'm slipping!

1128
01:15:21,309 --> 01:15:23,407
No!

1129
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:26,008
Gotcha.

1130
01:15:28,048 --> 01:15:29,462
Thank you, Lucy.

1131
01:15:29,463 --> 01:15:32,069
Let's go!
We're not safe yet!

1132
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:37,054
Minions, time to do
what we do best.

1133
01:15:37,055 --> 01:15:39,922
We will cheer for our boss.
We will fight for our boss.

1134
01:15:39,923 --> 01:15:41,702
We're popping the bubbles!

1135
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:42,984
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1136
01:15:42,985 --> 01:15:44,669
- Villain!
- Villain!

1137
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:48,361
You guys too!
You guys are villains!

1138
01:16:00,703 --> 01:16:02,943
Look at what we have here.

1139
01:16:02,968 --> 01:16:07,790
Sorry, Gru.
This is going to be a total burn.

1140
01:16:12,324 --> 01:16:15,882
Oh, no. No!
No, no, no, no...

1141
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:23,035
I've been a bad boy!

1142
01:16:30,277 --> 01:16:34,431
Nobody messes with my brother!

1143
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:38,227
Aaaah!

1144
01:16:38,228 --> 01:16:40,050
Aaaaahh!

1145
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:47,754
What?
What's happening?

1146
01:17:00,256 --> 01:17:02,516
Dru!

1147
01:17:02,626 --> 01:17:04,722
Hold on!
I'm coming!

1148
01:17:08,655 --> 01:17:11,267
You've ruined everything.

1149
01:17:11,268 --> 01:17:13,779
And now, it's time to die.

1150
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:16,671
Any last words, Gru?

1151
01:17:16,693 --> 01:17:18,229
You know what?

1152
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:21,149
I got two words for you.

1153
01:17:21,505 --> 01:17:23,611
Dance fight.

1154
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:27,786
Oh, it is alright, Donkey Kong.

1155
01:17:27,787 --> 01:17:31,127
I'm going to enjoy this.

1156
01:17:50,122 --> 01:17:51,629
Enough!

1157
01:17:51,818 --> 01:17:53,451
My turn.

1158
01:18:13,165 --> 01:18:14,907
Oh oh.

1159
01:18:17,921 --> 01:18:20,007
Game over!

1160
01:18:22,184 --> 01:18:25,434
Is this what you're looking for?

1161
01:18:25,435 --> 01:18:27,026
No!

1162
01:18:27,263 --> 01:18:29,398
Ow! Ow!
Ow!

1163
01:18:36,482 --> 01:18:39,006
No... !

1164
01:18:41,954 --> 01:18:44,611
Curse you, Gru!

1165
01:18:44,858 --> 01:18:46,633
Curse you.

1166
01:18:46,634 --> 01:18:49,365
Bill, over there.
Robert, work your pick.

1167
01:18:49,366 --> 01:18:51,336
Chuck, more bashing.

1168
01:18:55,386 --> 01:18:56,727
Dru.

1169
01:18:56,752 --> 01:18:58,216
Dru.

1170
01:19:05,423 --> 01:19:07,842
Hey, we did it.

1171
01:19:08,005 --> 01:19:10,529
Yes, we did, brother.

1172
01:19:10,530 --> 01:19:12,873
- Gru!
- Gru!

1173
01:19:12,874 --> 01:19:14,576
Girls!

1174
01:19:27,234 --> 01:19:28,363
Gru!

1175
01:19:28,364 --> 01:19:30,946
Hey, Mel.
Welcome back.

1176
01:19:30,947 --> 01:19:31,725
Woo-hooooo!

1177
01:19:31,726 --> 01:19:34,842
- Yay!
- Yay!

1178
01:20:03,941 --> 01:20:05,908
Love you, Mom.

1179
01:20:10,132 --> 01:20:13,607
I'm a Mom.
I'm a Mom!

1180
01:20:16,299 --> 01:20:18,706
Fight!
Ha ha!

1181
01:20:23,806 --> 01:20:24,534
Ha ha ha...

1182
01:20:24,535 --> 01:20:26,056
Cheater!

1183
01:20:26,057 --> 01:20:28,839
- How do you like this, Cheater?
- No. No.

1184
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:31,777
Boys.
Time for bed.

1185
01:20:31,778 --> 01:20:33,960
We're back at work
in the morning.

1186
01:20:33,961 --> 01:20:37,106
- I'm coming, sweetie.
- Hi, Lucy.

1187
01:20:37,107 --> 01:20:38,847
See you tomorrow, brother.

1188
01:20:38,848 --> 01:20:42,128
Hey, I'm back on the job.
So no villainy tonight.

1189
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:43,325
Huh, got it?

1190
01:20:43,326 --> 01:20:46,524
I make no promises.
Love you!

1191
01:20:46,525 --> 01:20:48,655
Uh-huh, right.

1192
01:20:48,666 --> 01:20:50,343
I love you too.

1193
01:20:50,344 --> 01:20:52,476
- Awwww.
- Awwww.

1194
01:20:53,217 --> 01:20:55,081
Alright, every...
Go. Go.

1195
01:20:55,082 --> 01:20:56,751
Go to bed.

1196
01:21:00,759 --> 01:21:02,826
Hey. Guys.
Come on.

1197
01:21:02,827 --> 01:21:04,718
Shhh.
Shhhh.

1198
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:21,918
What the heck is happening?

1199
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:24,205
It's coming from outside!

1200
01:21:25,299 --> 01:21:25,877
Huh!

1201
01:21:25,878 --> 01:21:29,343
Hey, I thought we said
no more villainy!

1202
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,672
Sorry, brother.

1203
01:21:30,673 --> 01:21:33,848
- Somebody's got to keep
the family tradition alive.
- Yoo-hoo.

1204
01:21:33,849 --> 01:21:34,918
Right?

1205
01:21:34,919 --> 01:21:37,146
- Yeah!
- Villain!

1206
01:21:37,147 --> 01:21:39,306
- Yeah!
- Kumbaya!

1207
01:21:44,695 --> 01:21:46,555
Let's get him.

1208
01:21:46,691 --> 01:21:49,080
Honey, he's my brother.

1209
01:21:49,081 --> 01:21:51,767
We'll give him
a 5 minute head start.

1210
01:21:56,836 --> 01:22:02,091
