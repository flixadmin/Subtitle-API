[Oliver] <i>Previously on</i>Arrow...

2
00:00:01,793 --> 00:00:04,212
The prosecution's smoking gun

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,756
is a witness who is willing to testify

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,467
that you are the Green Arrow.
It's someone on the team.

5
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:12,137
Dinah isn't the witness, Oliver, it's me.

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,513
You're off the team.

7
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:15,598
It's been real, y'all.

8
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,142
I'm out, too.

9
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,601
I'm done.

10
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,230
So we've got 'em fighting with each other

11
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:23,940
instead of fighting us.

12
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,692
This is only the beginning.

13
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,074
Mr. Bertinelli, I think you're gonna
like these numbers.

14
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:37,954
We need a name
for the Panam-X that's, uh, coming in.

15
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:43,626
Christening ships does make it seem
more legit if the IRS checks in.

16
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,965
How about <i>The Huntress?</i> After my cousin.

17
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,633
Very good.

18
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,635
Thank you, sir.

19
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,764
[door opens and closes]

20
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,476
Who the hell are you?

21
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,270
Someone important.

22
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,732
Real important.

23
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,193
You don't look it.
How'd you get past my men?

24
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,778
I blew them a kiss.

25
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:14,824
Jerry Bertinelli
of the eponymous crime family

26
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,035
and the last of his kind.

27
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:22,457
The rest of your family is either
dead or incarcerated.

28
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,708
You... You writing a book?

29
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,251
I have heard

30
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,006
that sometimes ships appear
on your docking manifest,

31
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,841
but never actually arrive.

32
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,011
Sometimes ships arrive

33
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,347
and never end up on the docking manifest.

34
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,516
Well, it's, uh, very profound.

35
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:45,688
If the price is right, maybe,
maybe we can facilitate a few things.

36
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,899
No, I'm afraid you misunderstand.

37
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:49,317
We want to buy you out.

38
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,444
I got a feeling you're not hearing me.

39
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,488
Port's not for sale.

40
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,406
Take a walk.

41
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,202
Oh, it sounds to me like
you want a kiss, too.

42
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,537

You have 48 hours

[groaning]

Don't you have a daughter
attending Columbia University?

00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,060
I've always wanted to visit New York.

{\an8}Looks like you need this.

52
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:51,087
{\an8}Oh, John Diggle, the savior of souls
and bringer of java.

53

{\an8}-Thank you.
-I have been called.

54
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,842
{\an8}I guess I have to find ways to be useful.

{\an8}You're working overtime
trying to find Cayden James,

57
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,556
{\an8}and I'm still on the disabled list.

58
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,642
{\an8}Well, not for long. Curtis is on his
way over and we will fix you.

59
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,060
{\an8}We have the technology.

60

{\an8}Ah, I'm not the Six Million Dollar Man.

61

{\an8}Not yet, you're not.

62
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,316
{\an8}And more like $2.24 million man,

63
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,942
{\an8}because Curtis and I
are stretching pennies

Oh. He's early. He'll be here soon.

{\an8}-Who's early?
-[John] Curtis.

{\an8}Shouldn't you be getting home?

69

{\an8}Raisa must be making quadruple

{\an8}-William doesn't know you're here.
-I know.

{\an8}And I don't like it, but...

73
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,259
{\an8}We need to find Cayden James.

74
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,304
{\an8}Are we making any progress on that front?

75

{\an8}or he's just biding time.

-Another strikeout.

79
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,984
{\an8}I can't track her cry and Cayden must
have inserted some sort of Trojan

80
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,320
{\an8}into the software, it's confusing
our facial recognition algorithms.

81
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,404
{\an8}I cannot find her.

82
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,990
{\an8}All right, we will continue
with the low-tech option.

83
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,034
{\an8}I will go out up there again tonight.

84
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,411
{\an8}Yeah, and every time you do,
you're playing Russian roulette,

85
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,330
{\an8}considering you're being followed and all.

86
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,249
{\an8}And the Anti-Vigilante Law.

87
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,376
{\an8}I'm not worried. You should not be either.

{\an8}The three of us,
we will solve this problem together.

{\an8}Like your haircut. [chuckles] It's nice.

90
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,470
{\an8}I didn't get a haircut. Curtis, it's fine.

91
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,640
{\an8}I'm really appreciative
that you're helping John.

{\an8}No hard feelings?

93
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,019
{\an8}No.

94

{\an8}That wasn't super awkward. [chuckles]

{\an8}Ah, to what do I owe the pleasure?
Sit down.

00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,540
{\an8}Uh, well...

100
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,002
{\an8}I heard you needed a new assistant.

101
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,086
{\an8}Yeah.

102
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,505
{\an8}Developed some trust issues
with the last one.

103
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,633
{\an8}Yeah, Ollie told me you fired him.

104
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,385
{\an8}Yeah, about that.

105
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,178
{\an8}He also mentioned
that you wanted to, what?

106
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,638
{\an8}Err on the side of forgiveness?

107
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,225
{\an8}Yeah, I mean, look,
you know everyone makes mistakes.

108
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,520
{\an8}And I totally get
why you did what you did.

109
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,940
{\an8}But I just feel like
it might come across bad for optics.

110
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:21,070
{\an8}It might look like you're retaliating
against a whistle-blower.

111
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,072
{\an8}Yeah, I hear what you're saying.

112
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,866
{\an8}But, Thea,

113
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,787
{\an8}Oliver shouldn't have to work
shoulder to shoulder

114
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,706
{\an8}with a guy who's testifying against him.

115
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,667
Doesn't mean you're not still down
an assistant.

116
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,003
Yeah. Well, actually, I hired
a replacement this morning.

117
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,212
Oh.

118
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,008

-Seems simple.
-Yeah, for you,

126
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,865
I mean, making the chip.
That was the hard... [echoing]

127
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,118
What was that?

128
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,080
Some kind of electro-magnetic
frequency interference.

129
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,123
-From the chip?
-No, I doubt it, but...

130
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,209
[sighs] It's probably nothing.

All right, the moment of truth.

Round Two. El busto.

Why don't you just
stop pouring money into this? Into me.

135
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,560
You let us worry about the money,
okay? We're going to do this.

136
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,611
I can tinker with the design
some more when I get home.

without shooting a bad guy,

I'm gonna bust.

Who collared this guy?
We've had a warrant on him for weeks.

149
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,067
Nobody. He just up and turned
himself in five minutes ago.

150
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,611
-Turned himself...
-It's crazy. Fifth one this week.

151
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,989
All of a sudden these bad guys
grew a conscience.

Did you like my presents?

-What are you doing here?
-Seeing you.

154

You know, anybody in this office
could arrest you.

-Hell, I could arrest you.
-For what?

00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,294
I'm a Central City police officer.

157
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,963
The only rap on me
is that I'm presumed dead.

158
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:48,676
Then again, I was an undercover,
so that death is probably bogus.

159
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,429
The Vigilante put the fear of God
in these guys.

160
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,265
At least the Vigilante isn't killing them.

161
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,227
Most guys just send flowers.

162
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,190
How about a stroll by the pier instead?

163
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,818
Tomorrow, after your shift ends?

164
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,115
Sure.

165
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:12,575
Okay.

166
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,713
[device beeping]

167
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,092
Clear.

168
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,303
-What's going on?
-We've been compromised.

169
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,890
Curtis brought down some equipment
into the bunker for John's implant.

170
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,059
We got massive signal interference.

171
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,685
-We got lucky.
-Three months ago,

172
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,354
when Laurel infiltrated the bunker.

173
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,022
She stole one of Curtis' T-Spheres.

174
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,732
James had it on him
back at Starling Stadium.

175
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,984
We were so focused
on what she could have taken.

176
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,153
We never thought about
what she could've left behind.

177
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,198
-Like a bug.
-Exactly.

178
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,243
Then she's been watching us for months.

179
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,871
I put it on loop, okay?
Audio and visual of the bunker.

180
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,998
-He doesn't know that we know.
-All right.

181
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,166
[John] I spoke with Lyla.

182
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,919
She says we can use
A.R.G.U.S. for the time being.

183
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,463
-That's smart.
-No, smart is Cayden James

184
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,049
being one step ahead of us
from the very jump, Oliver.

185
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,801
I hate to belabor
the depressingly obvious,

186
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,304
but secret identities? No longer secret.

187
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,431
[cell phone chiming]

188
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,141
The block between 74th and Jansen

189
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,768
just lost their security signal uplink.

190
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,853
-That doesn't just happen on its own.
-Cayden James?

191
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,146
I'm on it.

192
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,821
Hey, hey, hey. Stand down.

193
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,031
I just needed to get your attention.

194
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,284
You're a hard man to find.

195
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,744
Have you ever considered a website?

196
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:43,374
Or maybe a spotlight in the sky,
big silhouette of an arrow?

197
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,792
What do you want?

198
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,837
-You know who I am?
-Jerry Bertinelli.

199
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,465
-You're in the Bertinelli Syndicate.
-I am the Bertinelli Syndicate.

200
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,050
At least, what's left of it.

201
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,219
And I can't go down without a fight.

202
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,887
In five seconds,
you're gonna be in a fight.

203
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,973
Just hear me out. Look, I...

204
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,892
I never actually
wanted to get in this life.

205
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,894
I know,
but we do certain things for family.

206
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,104
Am I right?

207
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,691
Now, the ports, these docks,
it's all we got left.

208
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,484
And last night, these people came over,

209
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,986
threatened to take it from me.

210
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,531
You know, some dweeb in glasses, a thug,

211
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,450
a woman with super powers.

212
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,911
-And you know them?
-Maybe.

213
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,955
Yeah, no, I figured you might.

214
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,082
They're looking to control the docks.

215
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,459
So talk to your cousin.

216
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,462
She's been underground. So I'm asking you.

217
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,380
Do you really think

218
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,383
that I'm gonna help you win a turf war?

219
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,594
Well, I think you're
the enemy of my enemy.

220
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,263
Which makes us allies.

221
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,985
We need to know what's on this.

222
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,905
Hi, Felicity, how are you?
Are you busy with anything?

223
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,948
Can you help me with something?
You look tired.

224
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,659
-Hi.
-Hi.

225
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,410
Jerry Bertinelli gave that to me.

226
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,372
The port is the only thing
the Bertinelli family has left.

227
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,291
Cayden James and Black Siren
are trying to take it from them.

228
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,918
So we're getting into bed
with the Bertinellis now?

229
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,170
I remember last time you got in bed
with one of the Bertinellis.

230
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,838
It did not work out well.

231
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,301
I have a long memory for
these sorts of things, call me crazy.

232
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,513
Two nights ago they paid him a visit.
This is the security footage.

233
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,056
They made a threat against his daughter.

234
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,599
Well, what's on here
might help us locate them.

235
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:24,767
That's the plan.

236
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,353
Well, we'll know about the license plate.

237
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,150
Old school. I like it.

238
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,361
A little bit of old school
combined with some new school,

239
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,613
and I'm about to find us
this Cayden James needle

240
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:38,864
in the Star City haystack.

241
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,616
Do it.

242
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,994
I mean, I was thinking after school
we could hit up the zoo.

243
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,914
They have this new reptile room
with a Komodo dragon.

244
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,250
Thing's so big, it could eat a cow.

245
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,836
-That's dope, right?
-I guess so.

246
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,046
What's up, sweets?

247
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,257
I thought you were all about
this animal stuff.

248
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,050
I am, but...

249
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,969
Why aren't you going to work today?

250
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,848
I'm going through
a little transitional period.

251
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,350
-Will I have to leave again?
-Hey...

252
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:13,607
No one will ever take you away from me.

253
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,359
Ever again.

254
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,237
[knock at door]

255
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,991
-What's up, dawg?
-What's up, dawg?

256
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,451
I brought crogurts.

257
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,704
-"Crogurts"?
-I didn't name them. I just eat them.

258
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,414
-Hey, Zoe.
-Hi, Curtis.

259
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,458
Hey, go get your bag.
We're about to leave.

260
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,669
Must be great having her back, huh?

261
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,088
Best feeling in the world.

262
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,885
You don't look like you're feeling
the best feeling in the world though.

263
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,262
I can't shake how everything
went down with Oliver.

264
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,057
In order to do right for me,
I had to betray him.

265
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,560
You had to put your daughter first.

266
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,438
She's family.

267
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,107
Is that why you called me over?

268
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,194
Actually, I was thinking...

269
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,198
All the evidence Agent Watson said
she has against me

270
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,741
has to be digitized, right?

271
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,619
-Yeah.
-So what if

272
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,246
that evidence suddenly vanished?

273
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,457
Then I'll be able to... [sighs]

274
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,501
What do you call it? Um...

275
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,420
-Recant.
-You put your family first, Rene.

276
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,048
That's nothing to be ashamed of about.

277
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,093
I mean, now, accessing the files
might be a little easier

278
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,680
now that the case has been moved back
to the Star City DA, but...

279
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,016
So, that's a yes...

280
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,810
No, that's a "Let me think about it."

281
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,773
Fine, yeah, I'll do it.
We all know I'll do it.

282
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,691
Awesome.
That's what I'm talking about, hoss.

283
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,529
[laughing] That was
the worst stakeout of my life.

284
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,240
Do you remember, it was like, what?
Minus one?

285
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,951
It was freezing. I was freezing my ass off

286
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,285
and the car's heater broke down.

287
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,455
-I warned you about that.
-Yeah, you did and I didn't listen.

288
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,583
I think there's a life lesson
in there somewhere.

289
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,709
Oh...

290
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,088
I think I drank a gallon of coffee
that night to stay warm.

291
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,800
I had to pee so...
I never had to pee so bad in my life.

292
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,927
And I had to go back behind the car.

293
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,929
So you know, I mean,
I wasn't gonna ask the scumbag

294
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,514
if I could use his bathroom.

295
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,849
Oh, God, and the second I go back there,

296
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,601
he decides to make a run for it.

297
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,437
That son of a bitch.
I had to go chasing after him,

298
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,023
fall face-first into the snow bank
[chuckling]

299
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,277
and knock myself out on the curb.

300
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,371
This is complicated. I know.

301
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,833
I'm used to complicated.
This is a whole new level.

302
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,626
It doesn't have to be.

303
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,880
I stopped being the Black Canary
five weeks ago.

304
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,801
I really want to uncomplicate
my life right now.

305
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,262
Just so long you don't forget to live it.

308
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,068
Sorry.

Text from an informant.

310
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,115
My next target's on the move.

311
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,368
Don't worry.

00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,412
I'm not gonna kill him.

313
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,373
Well, just make sure you bring him in
when I'm off duty.

314
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,293
Okay? Because all this intake
is giving me carpal tunnel.

315
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,353
[Thea] Pen?

316
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,565
I can always count on you.

317
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,361
So, Quentin told me the good news.

318
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,990
-You're back with us?
-Yes, I am.

319
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,492
And you're happy about that?

320
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:54,787
Well, I'm just sorry that I can't be
of more help to you

321
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,207
and the team, or lack thereof.

322
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,625
It's fine.

323
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,586
I just know you need
the manpower right now,

324
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,422
and I'm not just there...

325
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,548
Thea,

326
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,051
you will always be my Speedy

327
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,387
whether you're using
a bow and arrow or not.

328
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,263
[cell phone vibrating]

329
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,557
[clears throat]

330
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,684
Yeah.

331
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,395
-Found him.
-Where?

332
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,647
His vehicle is parked outside
a warehouse in Adams Heights.

333
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,565
-Looks like he's alone.
-And he doesn't know that we know.

334
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,150
-Okay, talk me in.
-Oliver,

335
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,194
if you do that, you'll be going in solo.

336
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,530
Let us stake the place out, do some recon.

337
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,532
We have the chance
to take him by surprise.

338
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,700
We can't pass it up.

339
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,743
-Hey, Ollie.
-Yeah?

340
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,745
Go get him.

341
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,418
[grunting]

342
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,675
[beeps]

343
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,385
Overwatch, I'm in the east sector.

344
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,469
Where to?

345
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,597
Okay, you're coming up on the main floor.

346
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,641
Same three heat sigs have been
there for a while now.

347
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,018
Good odds that's our target.

348
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,896
[Cayden] I'm sensing some impatience,
Miss Lance.

349
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,859
Would you care to elucidate?

350
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,570
I'm not impatient. I'm annoyed.

351
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,238
We have the numbers.

352
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,532
Why not just take the pier
from the Bertinellis?

353
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:14,992
Oh, no.

354
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,286
-Not impatient at all.
-[Cayden] Mr. Sheck.

355
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,539
No need to stir the pot.

356
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,125
I think you'll find that brute force,
while it's easy,

357
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,877
is exceedingly messy.

358
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,088
I prefer precision.

359
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,760
Design over chaos.

360
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,386
[grunts]

361
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,104
[choking]

362
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,940
[beeps]

363
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,212
You've taught yourself some new tricks.

364
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,089
No more games.

365
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,049
Overwatch, I have the target.

366
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,843
That's a whole lot of bad news.

367
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,220
Arrow, you're about to get company.

368
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,805
-[feedback ringing]
-Oliver?

369
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,389
Overwatch, do you copy?

370
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,850
I'm afraid Miss Smoak can't hear you.

371
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:25,229
You see, I also have some tricks,
Mr. Queen.

372
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,065
And I have friends.

373
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,733
Hello, Kapiushon.

374
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,444
How were your holidays?

375
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,988
[Diaz] Funny you should mention that.

376
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,074
[Black Siren coughs]

377
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,869
Looks like we're getting
a late Christmas present.

378
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,251
I only targeted criminals.

379
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:52,548
I thought you'd know vigilantes
are criminals, Mr. Mayor.

380
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,927
[Cayden] You'll find that I don't play
games, Mr. Queen.

381
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,096
-But I do win.
-It's enough.

382
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:04,101
I am so sick of everyone not killing him
when they get the chance.

383
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,728
[gun firing]

384
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,105
Let him go.

385
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,735
You know, for a smart guy,

386
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,738
that was a dumb move.

387
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,660
There's a time and a place
for Oliver Queen's demise.

388
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,955
Now is not it.

389
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,209
So Cayden James not only has Laurel,

390
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,920
but he's backed by two
different criminal organizations.

391
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,255
And a deranged killer that we haven't

392
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,175
-been able to put down for two years.
-[sighs] Oliver.

393
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,345
If Cayden James has his own posse men,

394
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,307
maybe we need to think about
evening the playing field.

395
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,517
We're not folding
Curtis, Rene and Dinah back in.

396
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,604
I don't trust they won't compromise us.

397
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,982
Cayden James told you that
he wants to watch the city burn.

398
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,693
This is no time for ego, man.

399
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,195
This is not ego.

400
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,990
John, you more than anyone know

401
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:03,452
you don't go into the field
with people you can't rely on.

402
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,579
[Felicity] Okay, then,
how about not going to the field?

403
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,747
They need to know what's going on.

404
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,290
Dinah deserves
to know the truth about her ex.

405
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,541
I agree.

406
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,877
So we share intel,

407
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,004
but that's it.

408
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,055
Is that a bottle?

409
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,389
[sighs]

410
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,850
[groans]

411
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,603
Worse. Maybe.

412
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,317
[Quentin sighs]

413
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,070
Oh.

414
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,657
A photo album.

415
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,911
Okay, you've definitely
just hit bottom, Quentin.

416
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,121
I think we need to call your sponsor.

417
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,290
Yeah. Maybe he can
talk some sense into me.

418
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,543
Okay, well,
I've been in a coma for six months,

419
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,128
so why don't you fill me in a little?

420
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,881
Um, you know, last month,
when I was held hostage?

421
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,883
You know, she let me go.

422
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,176
What I saw in her

423
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,719
is what I see here.

424
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,346
Look, I mean,

425
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,100
everyone, even Ra's al Ghul,
has had moments of kindness.

426
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,184
Yeah.

427
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:14,273
Look, I'm not saying
that this Laurel is that bad, but...

428
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,566
I just can't stop thinking

429
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,111
that if I abandon her,
if I write her off as some kind of psycho,

430
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,530
and I know this...

431
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,449
Sounds crazy,

432
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:28,203
but if there is just some way
to get through to her,

433
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,371
and I don't take it,

434
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,456
it's going to be like
watching her die all over again.

435
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,042
You're like a father to me, you know that?

436
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:39,506
If you go down this road, Quentin,
you could end up getting killed.

437
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,259
Even if you don't care
what happens to you,

438
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,553
don't forget to think about
your other daughter.

439
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,598
-Hey.
-Hey.

440
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,685
[John] Thanks for agreeing
to meet with us.

441
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,855
Yeah, I'm not really sure I see the point.
We're out of the game.

442
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:00,110
I don't exactly see Cayden James
respecting those types of boundaries.

443
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:04,281
Cayden had Laurel plant a camera...
at the bunker.

444
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,035
We're all compromised.

445
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,494
How long have you all known about this?

446
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,579
Twenty-four hours.

447
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,956
You've known we were exposed
like this for a whole day,

448
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,082
you're just telling us now?

449
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,251
Look, we thought our intel was rock solid.

450
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,339
And then we found out
that Laurel wasn't the only one

451
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,423
that he's in league with.

452
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,592
He's working with the Bratva
and Ricardo Diaz.

453
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,968
Just what this city needs.

454
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,595
She's not the only member of his group.

455
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,598
Dinah...

456
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,101
Vincent's working with them, too.

457
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,607
[scoffs]

458
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,652
No, no. [stutters]
That's insane. That's insane.

459
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,404
Vince hunts criminals,
he doesn't throw down with them.

460
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,156
Oliver saw him with James and the rest.

461
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:49,743
Well, excuse me if, uh, I don't
just take Oliver's word for it.

462
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,787
I mean, keeping us under surveillance,

463
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,998
sounds like he and Cayden James
have a lot in common.

464
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:58,251
Rene, we did that
for the good of the team.

465
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,377
Oh.

466
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,837
Is that how you sleep at night, John?

467
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,467
We were facing
an actual breach in security.

468
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,636
You guys gave up on Oliver.

469
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,305
You don't get to stay mad at Daddy
because he read your diary

470
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,890
and you get to just skip out on curfew.

471
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,266
That's not the way it works.

472
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,227
I'm getting sick and tired
of you talking to me

473
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,770
like I did what I did on a whim.

474
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,564
I did it for my daughter.

475
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,109
And your choice
put the whole team in jeopardy, Rene.

476
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,986
We think that showed us where you stand.

477
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,531
-Dinah.
-Where are you going, Dinah?

478
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,157
Out. I'm not gonna sit here

479
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,451
and watch you two point fingers
at everybody but yourselves.

480
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,079
[door slams shut]

481
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:50,303
Move, or get moved, hoodie.

482
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:54,266
Hey, stand down. He's a friend of mine.

483
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,852
Well, he's an, uh, acquaintance.

484
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,647
Business associate? What do you need?

485
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,274
You going somewhere?

486
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:06,653
I got a, uh, text sent to me tonight
from inside my daughter's dorm room.

487
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,365
Cayden James, he can have the port.

488
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,700
You're running scared.

489
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,327
I'm gonna run anywhere
for my baby girl, all right?

490
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,830
As long as James and this crew
are out there,

491
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,415
she will never be safe.

492
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,083
Neither will you.

493
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,087
-But?
-But I can stop them.

494
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,131
With your help.

495
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:29,009
Listen to me, you do what I say,

496
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,929
we can end Cayden James.

497
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,439
-I'm so glad you wanted to meet again.
-[grunts]

498
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,985
Cayden James.

499
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,947
-You don't understand.
-You lying son of a bitch.

500
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,743
You were just getting close to me for him.

501
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,830
Dinah, can we talk about this
somewhere else?

502
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,917
That's a great idea, Vince.

503
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,252
Precinct has a really nice room for you.

504
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,129
Really nice interrogation room.

505
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,797
I can't let you do this.

506
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,550
I should've taken you in
the second you came back into my life.

507
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,386
[grunts]

508
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:18,350
I'm sorry.

509
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,077
[device beeps]

510
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,204
[John] Charges are in place.

511
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,580
So are mine.

512
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,083
Oliver. You sure about this, man?

513
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,378
Doesn't sound like you are.

514
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,504
[sighs]

515
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:51,424
If we do this, Cayden James
will bring his whole group here.

516
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:52,884
And?

517
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,386
And Cayden will bring everyone, Oliver.

518
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,346
I'm no place close to 100%.

519
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,307
But, look, the rest of the team...

520
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,643
-There is no "rest of the team."
-Oliver, we could use their help.

521
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:02,727
All you have to do is ask.

522
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,396
We would have to trust them and we can't.

523
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,481
We can't. John, we've been over this.

524
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:09,192
I know. But we've also
been over other things.

525
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:12,570
Like you in the League of Assassins,
me, with my secret.

526
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,282
Oliver, the best partnerships
are built on forgiveness, man.

527
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,866
No one knows that more than you and me.

528
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,411
I got arrested in front of my son.

529
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,163
Got dragged away in handcuffs
because of something that Rene did.

530
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,748
I don't know how to forgive him.

531
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,375
I tried.

532
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:29,421
John, more importantly,
what's Cayden James up to?

533
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,006
We don't know.

534
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,342
He has known our identities for months.

535
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,803
He hasn't outed us. Why?

536
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:41,224
This started with you, with me,
and with Felicity.

537
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,561
Whatever comes our way, we can handle it.

538
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,730
I believe that.

539
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,245
Are you actually eating the old crogurt?

540
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,497
Shut up. Your old is my delicious.

541
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,207
-How's Zoe?
-I don't know.

542
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,919
I just need her to feel like
everything's going back to normal.

543
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,379
I hope it is.

544
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,631
It'll help if you could delete
whatever the DA's got.

545
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,551
We just found out that Cayden James
had the bunker bugged

546
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:17,635
for a couple of months,

547
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,803
so maybe we should just
take a little break

548
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,388
on saying incriminating things
like that out loud.

549
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,391
All right, all right. I'm sorry.
I'm just anxious is all.

550
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,185
[sighs] I know.

551
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:28,021
Unfortunately, they have a backup
of all these files,

552
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,900
and, even worse, their records are
saying that they have hard copies.

553
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,276
Damn.

554
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,071
Yeah. No, but I'm inside the system.
I'm just trying to find anything...

555
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,739
-Whoa.
-"Whoa," what?

556
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,741
I think I just found something. Yeah.

557
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,826
There's a record on how Watson
found out you were Wild Dog.

558
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,995
-There's an audio recording.
-You thinking what I'm thinking?

559
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,288
That depends on if you're thinking

560
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,749
that Cayden James leaked an audio file
of you from the bunker to the FBI.

561
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,250
Is that what you're thinking?
That's what you're thinking, right?

562
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,378
-Yeah.
-Okay, we're on the same page.

563
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,630
[door slams shut]

564
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:54,756
Don't you knock?

565
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,299
Don't you lock your doors?

566
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,759
You look like you were just in a fight.

567
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,219
You were just in a fight.

568
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,678
-With who?
-Vince.

569
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,139
I confronted him. He did this and ran.

570
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,849
I'm so sorry, Dinah.

571
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,602
It was my fault for believing in him
in the first damn place.

572
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:08,728
And for confronting him,

573
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,647
exposing the fact that we know
about him and Cayden James.

574
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,148
That's my fault, too. It's great.

575
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,109
Curtis and I were just talking about James

576
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,402
and the bunker being compromised.

577
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,530
Yeah, and how that might have
led to Rene being compromised.

578
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,532
You think Cayden provided
Samanda Watson with her case?

579
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,534
-That's the theory.
-A good one, though.

580
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:26,413
If Cayden had audio and video
on all of us, especially Oliver,

581
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,081
why would he just tee up Rene?

582
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:30,542
It figures he'd go after
the most handsome and charming.

583
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,087
Well, maybe when Oliver
finally takes down Cayden James,

584
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,965
we'll figure out the details
of his master plan.

585
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,134
Why assume we're gonna wait for Oliver?

586
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,594
What are we gonna do here?

587
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,805
We're gonna sit around and wait
to see how this all plays out?

588
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,890
Hope it plays out, you mean.

589
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,934
You guys are serious about this?

590
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,895
About taking on Cayden James
and his super posse?

591
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,231
I let Vince walk once. I'm not
gonna make that mistake again.

592
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,317
And I owe that son of a bitch
some serious payback.

593
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,361
If I'm reading the room correctly,

594
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,780
we're gonna form our own team, right?

595
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,950
Right.

596
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,871
Right.

597
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,206
[Oliver] What's going on?

598
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,750
Signal chatter from Bertinelli's laptop.

599
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,501
They're bringing in the Red Lions.

600
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,504
Ah. The Red Lions. Chechnyan death squad.

601
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,339
Bertinelli's not gonna
let the port go without a fight.

602
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,008
Well, I'm thinking the enemy
of Cayden James

603
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,718
is my favorite death squad.

604
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,053
The Red Lions liberated a town
in Kizlyar last year.

605
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,263
Turned it into a wasteland.

606
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:26,973
We cannot let James' group
go up against these guys.

607
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,017
The collateral damage
will destroy the port.

608
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,727
Where are Bertinelli
and the Red Lions holed up?

609
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,395
Storage facility on 5th and Brockton.

610
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,522
[rewinding]

611
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,816
We can take the port
without Bertinelli's say,

612
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,652
but there are
a lot of players in this city.

613
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,072
I think you should set a precedent
for when you're in charge.

614
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,576
I'm already in charge, Miss Lance.

615
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,704
Even more reason
to use his corpse as a message.

616
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,206
I concur.

617
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:57,504
Mr. Bertinelli has his army.
He should meet ours.

618
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,720
-You think Bertinelli's gonna show?
-He better.

619
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,098
He will.

620
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,771
[Jerry] Let's get this over with.

621
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,773
If Keyhole satellite imagery
is anything to go off of,

622
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,691
it looks like Cayden James took the bait.

623
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:30,787
Whoa!

624
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,500
Go, go!

625
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,835
Funny thing.

626
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,963
You guys don't look like
a Chechnyan death squad!

627
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,014

628
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,611
We have a Ricardo Diaz in the house,

but no Cayden James.

Oh, no. We have a very large problem.

635
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,246
Oliver, get out of there.

636
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,875
Send in the cavalry.

637
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,928
So, how does this compare to <i>Halo?</i>

638
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,388
So much better.

Stand down, Oliver.

642
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,487
You're are vastly outnumbered.

[silenced gunshots]

00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,524
All right. All right.

649
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,317
Don't leave early.

650
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,487
The best parts are always at the end.

[grunting]

652
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,951
I'm disappointed, Mr. Bertinelli.
I truly am.

653
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,494
But not unreasonable.

654
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,330
This can go one of two ways
for you and your men.

655
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,457
The choice is yours.

[Oliver grunts]

Mr. Bertinelli...

661
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,743
It's fine. Relax, all right?
Just take the freaking port.

662
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,244
Thank you.

663
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,874
Although you elected
to betray me this evening,

664
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,501
you ultimately made the right choice.

665
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:08,629
[gunfire]

666
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:16,846
Which is why
I won't have your daughter killed.

667
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:20,308
I expect you can find the most
effective use for this corpse

668
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,893
to... How did you put it?

669
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,145
"Send a message."

670
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,319
Aren't you happy to be back

671
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,530
in your newly debugged
crime-fighting lair?

672
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,907
Cayden James got away.

673
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,619
Everybody got away. [clears throat]

674
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,162
Did you ever see that movie

675
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,413
<i>-Bull Durham?</i>
-Hmm?

676
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,290
My mom made me
watch that movie all the time.

677
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,501
I mean, it is the best
baseball movie ever,

678
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,794
but she used to say

679
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,129
that Susan Sarandon
was her fictional life coach.

680
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:56,052
There's a line in this movie
where she says,

681
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,305
"Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose,

682
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,266
and sometimes it rains."

683
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,393
You can't control the weather.

684
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,312
You couldn't control
Bertinelli betraying you.

685
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,022
You know what else I can't control?

686
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,942
Their numbers advantage.

687
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,986
I can't be out there solo
against that group.

688
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,156
It's not the smart move.

689
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,450
I won't make that mistake again.

690
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,997
I just want to say that, I, for one,

691
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:28,501
think it's great that we're all
back in the same room together.

692
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,586
Trust and forgiveness.

693
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,383
For the past few weeks,
I have been really struggling

694
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,676
to square that circle.

695
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,637
I think all of us have.

696
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:44,183
Rene, as a father, I understand
why you did what you did.

697
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:49,647
I also recognize that you might be
taking me away from my son.

698
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:55,903
I reacted to that and I got angry.

699
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,906
The three of us decided

700
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,491
to put the three of you
under surveillance.

701
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,202
I take responsibility for that.

702
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,037
It was, without question...

703
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,748
It was a breach of trust.

704
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,627
So was lying to the team about Vince.

705
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,337
And I'm not trying
to point fingers, Dinah,

706
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,464
I am simply trying to illustrate

707
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:19,510
that there is blame on all sides here.

708
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:23,973
But we don't have time for grudges
or recriminations. We don't.

709
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,725
Not with what the city is up against.

710
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,769
So? What do you guys think?

711
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,522
Clean slate?

712
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,860
Clean slate.

713
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:40,198
Things just go back
to the way they were before?

714
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,409
Yeah.

715
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,328
I don't think I can do that.

716
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,455
Not after what the three of you did.

717
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,458
This city needs us.

718
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:54,879
And we know that, and we're not
shirking that responsibility.

719
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,507
We decided to go our own way.

720
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,551
-Wait a minute.
-No, no. Let's...

721
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,969
No, no, no.

722
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,096
This is what Cayden James wants.

723
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,891
Cayden didn't do this, Felicity.

724
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,102
He didn't create
an environment of distrust.

725
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,730
A team where some members of that team

726
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,899
were treated differently than others.

727
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,737
Cayden James didn't demand allegiance

728
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,740
and then play by his own set of rules.

729
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:27,036
I came because I want
to be a part of a real team.

730
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,621
Point taken.

731
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,874
I'd like to
wish the three of you good luck.

732
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,501
And I mean that sincerely,

733
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:39,048
with Cayden, with Anatoly, Diaz,
Black Siren, Vigilante,

734
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,758
these people are dangerous.

735
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,929
So, whatever you have planned,
whatever your move is,

736
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,225
good luck.

737
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,352
Let's go, guys.

738
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,313
[sighs]

739
00:37:56,983 --> 00:38:00,194
I may have solved the glitch in my chip.

740
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,447
I hope it helps.

741
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:09,120
I, um, really do.

742
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,167
[door closes]

743
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,977
What the...

744
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,731
I hope you don't mind.

745
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,650
Found these in my personal collection

746
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,153
and thought that we could add them
to your album.

747
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,612
Oh, thank you very much.

748
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,157
-It's my apology.
-For what?

749
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,326
You were right.

750
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:52,621
Look, Malcolm was every bit
as bad as this Laurel is right now,

751
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,581
and...

752
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:58,252
then in the end, he wasn't.

753
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,963
He changed.

754
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,674
And Laurel can, too.

755
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,510
I had no right
to tell you that she couldn't.

756
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,972
Right.

757
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,060
How the hell am I gonna do that?

758
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,561
Well, I can help.

759
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:20,399
And... I don't know. Maybe together,

760
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,736
we can find a way to break through to her.

761
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,446
Yeah.

762
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,698
[exhales]

763
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:30,159
When you said
you had something to show us,

764
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,370
didn't you think lights would be useful?

765
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,871
One second, guys.

766
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,707
It is all about the reveal.

767
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,299
What does it look like?

768
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,801
Some place.

769
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,844
[Curtis] No, it's our new lair. [chuckles]

770
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,721
Helix used to operate out of here,

771
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,099
but it's not like
they're using it anymore, so.

772
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,351
Curtis, it's genius.

773
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,978
Seriously, nice work.

774
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,563
I'm glad you guys like it.

775
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,191
Now, I don't suggest
we make this a regular thing,

776
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,692
seeing as how I'm a lightweight and all,

777
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:08,114
but this event warrants celebration.

778
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:12,535
Well, I am just glad that
I've found partners who I can trust.

779
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,994
That's what I'm talking about.

780
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,133
I'm concerned.

781
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,095
And the feeling doesn't suit me well.

782
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:34,515
You got the port like you wanted.

783
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,726
Sorry if I was unclear.
My concern relates to you.

784
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:41,313
Your continued association
with Miss Drake wouldn't worry me

785
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,984
if this surveillance

786
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:49,780
didn't suggest that she knows
about our association.

787
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,532
Don't worry.

788
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,367
I can handle Dinah.

789
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,165
There's not a button she has
I don't know how to push.

790
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,086
[Felicity] All right.

791
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:06,005
The new chip is in.

792
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,424
Just one second.

793
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,013
[sighing]

794
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,144
It doesn't feel any different.

795
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,645
It takes a minute.

796
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,110
[gasps]

797
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,904
Or not.

798
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,655
It worked?

799
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,706
Looks like we're not
as undermanned as we thought.

800
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,166
Yes.
