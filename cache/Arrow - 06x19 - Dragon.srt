1
00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,217
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,241 --> 00:00:03,218
Anatoly said that
you had a plan

3
00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:04,719
to take control
of this city.

4
00:00:05,123 --> 00:00:07,152
It's like you were
firing Overwatch.

5
00:00:07,153 --> 00:00:08,853
I need to stop Diaz,

6
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:10,455
and in order
to do that,

7
00:00:10,457 --> 00:00:13,057
I need to bring the mission
back to basics.

8
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:15,226
The impeachment was
just the latest step.

9
00:00:15,228 --> 00:00:17,094
And what's
the next one?

10
00:00:17,096 --> 00:00:20,932
Star City,
it's open for business.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,074
AmericasCardroom.com brings poker back
Million Dollar Sunday Tournament every Sunday

12
00:00:30,043 --> 00:00:33,010
Get your ass
out of bed, chillón.

13
00:00:33,012 --> 00:00:35,613
You can look at that
picture all you want.

14
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:37,582
Your father ain't never
coming back, Diaz.

15
00:00:40,386 --> 00:00:42,487
Getting breakfast.
When I come back,

16
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:45,056
this place better be clean
for inspection.

17
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:46,858
No wrinkles
on the bed--seriously--

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,827
or...

19
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,763
Get another souvenir
to help remind you.

20
00:00:56,102 --> 00:00:58,135
If you do it again,
I'll tell sister Heller.

21
00:00:58,137 --> 00:01:00,204
You think they'll believe
someone like you, chillón?

22
00:01:02,942 --> 00:01:07,144
What? You want to
take a shot at me?

23
00:01:07,146 --> 00:01:09,714
Go ahead.
I'm right here.

24
00:01:12,318 --> 00:01:14,652
Give it back.
That's my only one!

25
00:01:16,856 --> 00:01:19,957
No family's gonna want to
take you in.

26
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,326
Why would they?

27
00:01:22,328 --> 00:01:24,328
You're nothing.

28
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,631
You're a loser.

29
00:01:34,774 --> 00:01:36,574
You need
that reminder now.

30
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,618
You know that they invited
us here, right?

31
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,820
Breaking and entering
is a bit disrespectful,

32
00:01:49,822 --> 00:01:51,122
don't you think?

33
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:53,224
I'm tired
of waiting.

34
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:55,159
You're the one that wanted
to tag along.

35
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:58,296
To see how you operate,
to see your big job.

36
00:01:58,298 --> 00:02:00,865
So far, all we've done
is drive in the car for 3 hours

37
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:03,534
and wait outside...

38
00:02:03,536 --> 00:02:04,869
For two more.

39
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:07,705
Patience.

40
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:09,607
It's one of the most
important virtues

41
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:11,943
a person can have.

42
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:15,546
Meaning?

43
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:17,882
If you think
short-term,

44
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:20,217
you're gonna drift
moment to moment.

45
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:22,153
You want something big,

46
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:24,322
something truly
remarkable,

47
00:02:24,324 --> 00:02:26,591
you got to think
long-term.

48
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:29,393
We've been waiting
out here long-term.

49
00:02:31,064 --> 00:02:33,931
Let me put it
in perspective.

50
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:36,701
I've been working
on something for 5 years.

51
00:02:36,703 --> 00:02:38,769
What's waiting two hours?

52
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:40,871
A slap in the face.

53
00:02:40,873 --> 00:02:44,075
Small price to pay
for an introduction to the Quadrant.

54
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:46,243
I thought they were
an urban legend.

55
00:02:47,413 --> 00:02:49,080
They're very real.

56
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:51,048
They control all
criminal enterprises

57
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,317
across the entire country.

58
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:55,286
4 corners.

59
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:57,888
Yeah. Quadrant.
I get it. Very clever.

60
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,058
They didn't get that type of power
without patience.

61
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,593
Well, if they're
so powerful,

62
00:03:02,595 --> 00:03:04,462
then why didn't you
come with any backup?

63
00:03:04,464 --> 00:03:07,264
I'm not. I got you.

64
00:03:17,443 --> 00:03:19,276
You're early.

65
00:03:21,447 --> 00:03:23,247
My father couldn't
make it.

66
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:24,749
You don't mind, do you?

67
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:26,484
Let's get started.

68
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:28,019
We have a lot
to discuss.

69
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:30,287
Indeed we do.

70
00:03:36,963 --> 00:03:39,764
Hey. You made it.

71
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:44,135
Yeah. Um...I did.

72
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:46,470
Well, that's great.
I'm glad you did.

73
00:03:46,472 --> 00:03:49,106
- Hmm.
- What's wrong?

74
00:03:49,108 --> 00:03:50,775
You know, it's just
been a while since we've done

75
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:52,243
any Helix Dynamics
stuff.

76
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:54,045
Yeah. Well,
we've been busy.

77
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:55,680
We've been fighting.

78
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:57,248
Not you and me.
I mean, our teams, yeah,

79
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,764
but that's not
an issue for me anymore.

80
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:01,852
Glad it's not for you, but, you know,
Rene's still in the hospital.

81
00:04:01,854 --> 00:04:03,854
He's only now
just getting out.

82
00:04:03,856 --> 00:04:07,558
I'm sorry about
our teams. I'm...

83
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,094
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:10,096 --> 00:04:11,996
I'd really like
Helix to work.

85
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:16,701
Looks like you're trying to stabilize
the neuro-interface.

86
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:19,103
Yeah. I mean, it's just
still really twitchy.

87
00:04:19,105 --> 00:04:21,605
You know, actually,
I had a thought about this.

88
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:23,641
I think the serotonin
interface is a result

89
00:04:23,643 --> 00:04:25,976
of the pathogenic
reaction.

90
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:29,013
Star City's
open for business.

91
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:32,717
We have the police,
the ports, the whole city.

92
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:34,452
We got it wired.

93
00:04:34,454 --> 00:04:36,353
Now, you want to
run merchandise,

94
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:40,858
you want to move product,
launder money, anything,

95
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,326
Star City's the place.

96
00:04:42,328 --> 00:04:44,328
Assuming we're interested--

97
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:49,133
not saying that
we are but assuming,

98
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:51,068
how much you looking
to charge?

99
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,339
- It's free.
- Heh heh heh.

100
00:04:55,341 --> 00:04:58,175
Nothing's ever free.

101
00:04:58,177 --> 00:05:00,411
I just want a seat
at the table.

102
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:02,379
Of the Quadrant?

103
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:05,850
Mm-hmm. That seems
reasonable to me.

104
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:09,186
Well, you make the Quadrant sound
like it's a potluck,

105
00:05:09,188 --> 00:05:11,355
as if there's always
room at our table

106
00:05:11,357 --> 00:05:15,059
for anyone with
something to add,

107
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:17,061
but it's not.

108
00:05:18,364 --> 00:05:20,064
We're a family.

109
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:24,201
We're not really
that welcoming

110
00:05:24,203 --> 00:05:27,271
to outsiders

111
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:30,875
at least not
before we know--

112
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:35,746
ahem--that you can
operate at our level.

113
00:05:35,748 --> 00:05:39,950
I just offered you
a whole city.

114
00:05:39,952 --> 00:05:42,019
Now, if you can't see
the opportunity in that,

115
00:05:42,021 --> 00:05:44,421
why don't I talk
to your father?

116
00:05:44,423 --> 00:05:46,590
He sent me.

117
00:05:48,494 --> 00:05:51,128
We're just looking
for a little something extra.

118
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,132
Call it establishing
your bona fides.

119
00:05:55,134 --> 00:05:57,234
What'd you have
in mind?

120
00:05:57,236 --> 00:06:00,704
This is Robert Baylor,
one of our guys.

121
00:06:00,706 --> 00:06:02,540
Ahem. The FBI
pinched him.

122
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:05,209
- That's not ideal.
- Right?

123
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:07,812
We need to know where
the federal marshals

124
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:11,048
are holding Baylor
so we can get him out.

125
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,117
You want him
to audition.

126
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:15,519
Well, that's not a very
productive way of putting it.

127
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:16,854
And yet.

128
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:18,589
It'll be nothing for me.

129
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:20,224
It's not a problem.

130
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:22,159
Whatever it takes to get
the deal done, right?

131
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:24,929
Champion mind-set. Heh.

132
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:26,997
You got a John
in this place?

133
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:28,699
It's right
over there.

134
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:01,711

I'm at the location now.

137
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:12,982
Thanks for the address.

138
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:15,552
I'd say I owe you one,
but you owe me 20.

139
00:07:18,223 --> 00:07:20,557
Armand's contact
at the FBI.

140
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,726
Oh. So more
waiting, then.

141
00:07:22,728 --> 00:07:26,129
Have to get a picture
of the guy--

142
00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:28,765
proof of life.

143
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,567
They tell you to fetch,
you fetch.

144
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:33,436
So what's next--
roll over?

145
00:07:33,438 --> 00:07:36,439
Oh, that's right.
You've already done that.

146
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:38,908
You think I'm giving in
to these people too much?

147
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,244
I don't think it.
I know it.

148
00:07:44,082 --> 00:07:45,982
It's just business.

149
00:07:45,984 --> 00:07:47,884
You're ok with all this,

150
00:07:47,886 --> 00:07:49,452
how that guy
talked to you?

151
00:07:49,454 --> 00:07:51,421
Cartier's nothing.

152
00:07:51,423 --> 00:07:54,057
He's a steppingstone.

153
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:57,293
Long-term thinking.
Remember?

154
00:07:57,295 --> 00:07:58,895
Yeah, I remember.

155
00:07:59,898 --> 00:08:01,798
How's that working out
for you?

156
00:08:05,437 --> 00:08:07,470
Smoke break.

157
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,347
Fetch. Roll over,
sit. Good boy.

158
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:21,418
You know that the Quadrant's
the most powerful

159
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,453
criminal organization
on the continent?

160
00:08:23,455 --> 00:08:28,091
When I joined up
with Camden James, I gained a city.

161
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:31,094
When I join
the Quadrant,

162
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:33,363
I'm gonna have
an empire.

163
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,275
Ok. Try it.

164
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:49,145
- Success.
- Yes!

165
00:08:49,147 --> 00:08:51,147
Pathogenic reaction's
completely stabilized.

166
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:52,749
- Ha ha ha! Yes!
- Ha ha!

167
00:08:52,751 --> 00:08:55,318
Damn, we make
a good team!

168
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,153
- Well, speaking of team--
- No. Don't do that.

169
00:08:57,155 --> 00:08:59,289
Why would you do that?
We're having such a good time.

170
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,191
Well, earlier, you said the team thing
wasn't an issue for you anymore.

171
00:09:01,193 --> 00:09:02,992
- Did I say that?
- Yeah, you did.

172
00:09:02,994 --> 00:09:05,161
The question is why.

173
00:09:05,163 --> 00:09:07,997
Oliver sort of
fired me.

174
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:09,732
I mean, he--he's
saying that he didn't,

175
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:12,335
but--heh--it sure
feels like he did, you know.

176
00:09:12,337 --> 00:09:14,170
Not sort of fired.
He fired me.

177
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:17,640
Wait, wait. I'm sorry.
What happened?

178
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:19,776
Long story short--
Oliver had a run-in with Vertigo--

179
00:09:19,778 --> 00:09:21,544
the pharmaceutical,
not the person--

180
00:09:21,546 --> 00:09:23,213
and he came out of it
with this epiphany

181
00:09:23,215 --> 00:09:25,148
that to stop Diaz
he has to

182
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,850
"Go back to basics."

183
00:09:26,852 --> 00:09:29,586
- Meaning?
- Meaning he's a lone wolf,

184
00:09:29,588 --> 00:09:31,654
so no more team Arrow.

185
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:33,389
So did he also
fire John?

186
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:38,695
No. Uh, John left
about a week before.

187
00:09:38,697 --> 00:09:41,297
Wow! Ok. Uh, well,
I'm gonna have to try

188
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:43,233
not to take satisfaction
out of that.

189
00:09:43,235 --> 00:09:44,901
Try really hard.

190
00:09:44,903 --> 00:09:47,136
Ok. So it was down
to you and Oliver.

191
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:49,672
- Mm-hmm.
- Now it's just Oliver.

192
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:51,307
Yep.

193
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:52,876
How are you doing
with all this?

194
00:09:52,878 --> 00:09:54,410
Oh, I'm fine.

195
00:09:54,412 --> 00:09:56,212
You're not fine.

196
00:09:56,214 --> 00:09:57,914
Heh. What?

197
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:02,252
So none of your
people could find him.

198
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:04,521
I did.

199
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:06,189
Hmm.

200
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:09,392
I'll tell them to start
carving the monument.

201
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:11,194
They brought your
boy out for a smoke.

202
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:13,930
Looked more like
a guest than a prisoner.

203
00:10:13,932 --> 00:10:16,499
H-honey, ease up.

204
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:19,302
That's a 30-year-old
single malt. Heh.

205
00:10:21,606 --> 00:10:23,740
Call me "honey" again,

206
00:10:23,742 --> 00:10:25,909
and I might only
break your legs.

207
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,980
Mmm.

208
00:10:38,924 --> 00:10:40,456
I like this one.

209
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,862
So I held up my part
of the bargain.

210
00:10:45,864 --> 00:10:48,097
Time for you
to deliver yours.

211
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:50,767
You know, uh, your
pretty little friend makes

212
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:53,236
an inconvenient point.

213
00:10:53,238 --> 00:10:56,205
It seems that Mr. Baylor's
gotten a little chatty.

214
00:10:56,207 --> 00:10:58,875
- So what?
- So my father's going to

215
00:10:58,877 --> 00:11:00,476
have to debrief him,
you know, to find out

216
00:11:00,478 --> 00:11:02,712
what he told
the Justice Department.

217
00:11:02,714 --> 00:11:05,848
- You want me to--
- Fetch him?

218
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,285
What's a little favor
between future business partners?

219
00:11:09,287 --> 00:11:11,454
So what's next?

220
00:11:11,456 --> 00:11:13,122
You want me to
roll over,

221
00:11:13,124 --> 00:11:14,757
you want me to
play dead?

222
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,460
You're absolutely right.
Forget I asked.

223
00:11:17,462 --> 00:11:19,796
Thanks for tracking down
Baylor for us.

224
00:11:19,798 --> 00:11:21,798
We'll take it from here.

225
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,268
You should have asked
me from the beginning.

226
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:28,438
You wasting my time?

227
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,774
I don't react well
when people waste my time.

228
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:36,512
Hey. I--I had no idea
that Baylor would be cooperating

229
00:11:36,514 --> 00:11:39,482
with the frisbees.
Heh heh.

230
00:11:39,484 --> 00:11:42,819
I'm gonna deliver
Baylor to you.

231
00:11:42,821 --> 00:11:44,887
Afterwards,
I meet your father.

232
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,958
You solve this
little problem for us,

233
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,794
and my dad will be asking
to sit down with you.

234
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:54,731
Call me when you've
got Baylor.

235
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:56,766
I'll send over a car.

236
00:11:56,768 --> 00:11:59,936
Oh. What happened
to your hand?

237
00:11:59,938 --> 00:12:01,671
I got angry
at someone.

238
00:12:09,781 --> 00:12:12,315
The Quadrant's making you jump
through a lot of hoops.

239
00:12:12,317 --> 00:12:14,450
I hope it's worth it.

240
00:12:14,452 --> 00:12:16,319
Why don't I knock
on the door?

241
00:12:20,492 --> 00:12:22,258
Unh!

242
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,094
Hello, boys.

243
00:12:33,938 --> 00:12:35,738
Agh!

244
00:13:22,921 --> 00:13:24,220
Who are you?

245
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:25,488
Doesn't matter.

246
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,023
You gonna kill me?

247
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:29,158
If you keep asking
me questions.

248
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,828
On your feet.

249
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,130
Send the car.

250
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:36,299
Move.

251
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:38,067
Move!

252
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:45,742
Cartiers take care
of their own.

253
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:48,077
Once you're in,
you're family.

254
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,779
That's my expectation.

255
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:52,248
All's I'm saying is
I knew they'd send for me.

256
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,850
I would never snitch.

257
00:13:53,852 --> 00:13:55,451
Sure you wouldn't.

258
00:13:55,453 --> 00:13:57,587
I wouldn't take
the chance, though.

259
00:13:57,589 --> 00:13:59,622
You're lucky you
don't work for me.

260
00:14:03,895 --> 00:14:07,897
Baylor, buddy!
Feds treat you all right?

261
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:12,101
Whoa. I didn't say
nothing, I swear to God.

262
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:14,036
Tell him in person.

263
00:14:29,988 --> 00:14:31,854
They're gone.

264
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,127
That packs a punch.

265
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:40,410
And what would you have done if they
shot you in the head?

266
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:45,401
I'd be dead probably. Heh.

267
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:50,473
Getting shot...

268
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:52,441
Wasn't part
of my plan.

269
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:55,344
Understatement
of the year.

270
00:14:55,346 --> 00:14:57,880
You just can't trust
anyone these days.

271
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:02,652
Dad.

272
00:15:02,654 --> 00:15:04,220
Is it done?

273
00:15:04,222 --> 00:15:06,556
Baylor's
off the board.

274
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:08,024
And Diaz?

275
00:15:08,026 --> 00:15:09,959
Never saw it coming.

276
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:12,028
Heh. Idiot really
thought he had a shot.

277
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,064
As if we'd share
space with a thug like him.

278
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:16,833
Tomorrow, we'll send
a crew to Star City

279
00:15:16,835 --> 00:15:20,036
and lean
on Diaz's networks,

280
00:15:20,038 --> 00:15:24,106
and we'll make
his city...Ours.

281
00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:43,886
So this whole plan of yours
has gotten a little complicated.

282
00:15:43,888 --> 00:15:46,889
Anything worth wanting
shouldn't be simple.

283
00:15:46,891 --> 00:15:49,292
Hmm. Not my philosophy.

284
00:15:49,294 --> 00:15:51,127
Plans are like men.

285
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:53,496
It's best to avoid
the complicated ones.

286
00:15:53,498 --> 00:15:56,065
Aw, shucks.

287
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:58,034
You think I'm
not complicated.

288
00:15:58,036 --> 00:16:02,872
You do realize that the guys
that you wanted to impress tonight

289
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:05,341
are the same guys that
just tried to kill you.

290
00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:07,143
And I was prepared.

291
00:16:21,092 --> 00:16:23,626
It still doesn't explain
what we're doing back here

292
00:16:23,628 --> 00:16:27,530
at their place when we
should be on our way back to Star City.

293
00:16:27,532 --> 00:16:29,766
Maybe that's the difference
between us.

294
00:16:29,768 --> 00:16:33,136
When you get knocked down,
you give up.

295
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,840
- I get up.
- I get up!

296
00:16:37,842 --> 00:16:39,809
I just don't get
stupid, too.

297
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:46,249
Must be nice
being pretty.

298
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:48,351
You pout your lips,
you bat your eyes,

299
00:16:48,353 --> 00:16:50,620
everybody gives you
what you want.

300
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:54,557
Everything I wanted
I had to take.

301
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,227
♪ Hello, girls.
Hello, boys ♪

302
00:16:58,229 --> 00:17:00,663
♪ I'm feeling confrontational ♪

303
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:07,003
Bar's closed!
Everybody move!

304
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:08,471
Move!

305
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:19,282
Son of a bitch.

306
00:17:19,284 --> 00:17:23,820
In your enthusiasm
to take out your man...

307
00:17:23,822 --> 00:17:26,322
You forgot I was standing
next to him

308
00:17:26,324 --> 00:17:29,325
when you started
shooting.

309
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:31,327
But you're sorry
about that, aren't you?

310
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:33,296
It wasn't anything
personal.

311
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:35,231
Bullets make
things personal.

312
00:17:37,502 --> 00:17:40,970
- May I ask you something?
- Um...

313
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:43,673
Did you ever have to
fight for a meal?

314
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:47,744
Um, uh...

315
00:17:47,746 --> 00:17:51,013
Not once.
Not one time.

316
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:54,450
Mr. Silver Spoon.

317
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:59,021
I had to fight for every scrap of food
I ate as a kid.

318
00:17:59,023 --> 00:18:04,093
You don't know
what it's like to be hungry,

319
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:08,231
to want something
so bad

320
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:10,400
you'd kill for it.

321
00:18:10,402 --> 00:18:14,036
Ha! I've killed
plenty.

322
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:17,440
Not--not for survival.

323
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:20,743
Now when the outcome
of your life

324
00:18:20,745 --> 00:18:23,212
hangs in the balance.

325
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:25,114
It's funny you should
put it that way.

326
00:18:30,522 --> 00:18:33,156
You really got to
tell your guys,

327
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:36,092
creep a little quieter.

328
00:18:36,094 --> 00:18:39,262
There's two to my right,

329
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:41,631
3 more behind me.

330
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:45,134
Heh. That's
pretty confident

331
00:18:45,136 --> 00:18:47,136
for a thug
who's outnumbered.

332
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,975
You wouldn't think
I was outnumbered

333
00:18:52,977 --> 00:18:57,580
if you knew what
she can do. Hmm.

334
00:19:00,718 --> 00:19:03,553
Wow! We really need
to restock the fridge.

335
00:19:03,555 --> 00:19:05,588
Do you think soda
can go bad?

336
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,623
I should probably already know
the answer to that.

337
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,259
- Felicity?
- Hmm.

338
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:12,094
Hey.

339
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:15,331
Um, it's working,
remember?

340
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,666
- We high-fived.
- Yeah. Doesn't mean it can't

341
00:19:16,668 --> 00:19:18,301
be improved.

342
00:19:18,303 --> 00:19:20,069
Sure. Uh, so maybe
improve it tomorrow

343
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:21,771
when you've had some
sleep and some food

344
00:19:21,773 --> 00:19:23,573
and some
non-expired soda.

345
00:19:23,575 --> 00:19:25,708
Yeah. I just want to make
a couple adjustments here.

346
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,910
Because that's easier than talking
about your husband?

347
00:19:27,912 --> 00:19:30,246
Hey. He's going back
to basics, so, so am I.

348
00:19:30,248 --> 00:19:32,582
You're the one who described it as
getting fired.

349
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:34,984
I said, "kind of,"
and that was just shorthand.

350
00:19:34,986 --> 00:19:37,153
As much as I love
being a part of Team Arrow--

351
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:39,288
as downsized as it
may have become--

352
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,324
it was taking us away
from our real work, Helix.

353
00:19:41,326 --> 00:19:42,825
This is where it's at.

354
00:19:42,827 --> 00:19:44,427
And you're not
worried about him?

355
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:45,962
Nope. He can take
care of himself,

356
00:19:45,964 --> 00:19:47,597
and I have been doing
this for 5 years.

357
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,265
Yeah. In the bunker
with computers

358
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:51,100
and body cams
and GPS

359
00:19:51,102 --> 00:19:52,702
so you knew
where he was

360
00:19:52,704 --> 00:19:54,670
and what
he was doing

361
00:19:54,672 --> 00:19:56,405
and if he was ok.

362
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:59,108
Curtis.

363
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,310
Yeah. I thought throwing myself into work
would work, but it's not working.

364
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:03,112
I mean, I don't know
where he is.

365
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:04,680
He doesn't tell me where
he is anymore.

366
00:20:04,682 --> 00:20:06,182
I need to know if he's ok.
I'm dying here!

367
00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:08,951
Oh. Sorry.

368
00:20:08,953 --> 00:20:12,688
News alert: Shootout
in the Glades. Oliver?

369
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,057
The Green Arrow
was last seen in the center

370
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:17,760
of an altercation moments
before the explosion

371
00:20:17,762 --> 00:20:19,362
overtook the area.

372
00:20:19,364 --> 00:20:21,531
SCPD has yet to issue
a statement.

373
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:22,999
We will keep you updated.

374
00:20:27,872 --> 00:20:30,740
You're toying
with him.

375
00:20:30,742 --> 00:20:33,409
Oh, come on.
What's a little fun

376
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:37,146
between future
business partners?

377
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:40,316
Well, we wouldn't want
him to think that we're wasting his time

378
00:20:40,318 --> 00:20:42,251
by sending him
on some fool's errand.

379
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:44,353
Yeah. That would make
anyone furious.

380
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:59,569
Your daddy buy you
this place?

381
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:04,907
Not-so-shiny toy
to distract you

382
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:06,976
while he's running
the real business.

383
00:21:09,447 --> 00:21:12,415
I never got anything
from my family.

384
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:16,619
You know I'm an orphan?

385
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:20,790
It's true. I grew up
in a real-deal orphanage--

386
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:25,828
nuns and...
and everything.

387
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,230
The full package.

388
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:39,241
There was this older boy.

389
00:21:40,845 --> 00:21:43,245
His name was Jesse.

390
00:21:47,318 --> 00:21:50,486
Jesse thought he was
better than me,

391
00:21:50,488 --> 00:21:53,656
and I believed him,

392
00:21:53,658 --> 00:21:56,025
and I was afraid of him.

393
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:00,630
I'd cry every night.

394
00:22:02,266 --> 00:22:06,902
For years, he--
he treated me like a worm,

395
00:22:06,904 --> 00:22:08,838
like I was worthless...

396
00:22:10,274 --> 00:22:12,842
like I was
beneath him.

397
00:22:12,844 --> 00:22:14,443
I'd make his bed,

398
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:16,479
I'd clean our room.

399
00:22:20,018 --> 00:22:23,219
He treated me like
I was his damn servant.

400
00:22:25,356 --> 00:22:26,822
- Hyah!
- Unh!

401
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:33,496
Look at me.

402
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:37,099
I'm nobody's servant now.

403
00:22:37,101 --> 00:22:40,736
If you cut me, my father will never
give you what you want.

404
00:22:43,374 --> 00:22:47,843
That's prospective,
the future.

405
00:22:47,845 --> 00:22:50,880
I'm more interested
in the past.

406
00:22:50,882 --> 00:22:53,716
Why'd you try
and kill him, Eric?

407
00:22:53,718 --> 00:22:57,586
- Because I could.
- That's not good enough.

408
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:11,333
Stop!

409
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:14,203
It was
my father's idea!

410
00:23:14,205 --> 00:23:16,839
We were gonna take
Star City,

411
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:18,641
co-opt your networks.

412
00:23:18,643 --> 00:23:20,676
Take credit
for my sweat equity?

413
00:23:20,678 --> 00:23:22,545
That is
so inconsiderate.

414
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:25,214
Sounds like your
precious little Quadrant is

415
00:23:25,216 --> 00:23:27,383
a bunch of selfish jerks.

416
00:23:27,385 --> 00:23:29,719
They didn't know.

417
00:23:29,721 --> 00:23:32,121
We never told them
about you.

418
00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:33,823
What?

419
00:23:33,825 --> 00:23:35,691
My father and I,
we never brought

420
00:23:35,693 --> 00:23:39,428
your proposal
to the Quadrant.

421
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,598
You're a nobody,
so...

422
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,133
Agh! Ugh.

423
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,940
Unh!

424
00:24:01,953 --> 00:24:03,719
Satisfied yet?

425
00:24:03,721 --> 00:24:05,387
No.

426
00:24:05,389 --> 00:24:07,723
You're alive now.

427
00:24:07,725 --> 00:24:10,659
You want to stay
that way?

428
00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:12,962
Tell me when
the Quadrant's meeting.

429
00:24:12,964 --> 00:24:15,064
Tonight.

430
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:16,866
Well, isn't that
convenient?

431
00:24:16,868 --> 00:24:19,668
You gonna give me
all the details?

432
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,538
They're not just
gonna let you in.

433
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:27,243
I'm not planning
on knocking.

434
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:34,934
Somehow, we moved
past complicated

435
00:24:34,936 --> 00:24:37,703
and straight
into crazy.

436
00:24:37,705 --> 00:24:40,039
What I did
to Cayden James,

437
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:42,541
you think that's
crazy?

438
00:24:42,543 --> 00:24:44,677
This is manning up.

439
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:48,447
Ugh. Manning up.
I hate that phrase.

440
00:24:48,449 --> 00:24:50,015
Ok. Let's talk
this through.

441
00:24:50,017 --> 00:24:52,818
If the Quadrant is
as powerful as you say,

442
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,454
who knows what kind
of firepower they have in there?

443
00:24:55,456 --> 00:24:58,324
You're selling
yourself short, kiddo.

444
00:24:58,326 --> 00:25:00,192
You're better
than 10 men.

445
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:01,827
And if there's
more than 10?

446
00:25:01,829 --> 00:25:03,395
Trust me.

447
00:25:03,397 --> 00:25:07,166
While I appreciate
your self-confidence,

448
00:25:07,168 --> 00:25:10,603
you could be overestimating
your powers of persuasion

449
00:25:10,605 --> 00:25:13,005
by just a little bit.

450
00:25:13,007 --> 00:25:15,241
You might not be their
favorite person in the world

451
00:25:15,243 --> 00:25:17,343
considering what we've
just done

452
00:25:17,345 --> 00:25:18,878
to the prince
of hair gel.

453
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,881
I said, trust me.

454
00:25:21,883 --> 00:25:25,050
And I would find it
a whole lot easier to do so

455
00:25:25,052 --> 00:25:27,920
if you could just tell me
why it is so important

456
00:25:27,922 --> 00:25:30,923
for you to be a part
of this exclusive club.

457
00:25:30,925 --> 00:25:34,860
There are other ways
you can build your empire.

458
00:25:34,862 --> 00:25:36,762
It's not
about empire building.

459
00:25:36,764 --> 00:25:39,365
It's about respect.

460
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:41,233
Right, which you want,
and you're willing

461
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:43,502
to disrespect yourself in
order to get it from them.

462
00:25:43,504 --> 00:25:45,237
- That's not how it is.
- Really?

463
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:48,574
Because that's how
it looks like it is.

464
00:25:48,576 --> 00:25:50,442
Back at that bar,
you were talking

465
00:25:50,444 --> 00:25:52,444
about Jerry like he
still haunted you.

466
00:25:52,446 --> 00:25:58,817
Jesse. It's Jesse,
and he does.

467
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:01,620
Little bastard was
right. I was nothing,

468
00:26:01,622 --> 00:26:03,289
you know, a loser.

469
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:06,025
Not anymore.

470
00:26:06,027 --> 00:26:11,430
Hey. Now you're a king.
Forget about him.

471
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:15,000
I can't.

472
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:21,573
I was afraid of
Jesse for so long

473
00:26:21,575 --> 00:26:24,009
that all I had
was my fear...

474
00:26:26,914 --> 00:26:33,752
So I--I named that
fear The Dragon.

475
00:26:33,754 --> 00:26:35,487
That's cute.

476
00:26:35,489 --> 00:26:38,023
I lived with The Dragon
for so long...

477
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,660
It's all I had...

478
00:26:44,231 --> 00:26:46,465
But now being a part
of the Quadrant,

479
00:26:46,467 --> 00:26:48,634
I'm gonna have
something else...

480
00:26:50,237 --> 00:26:53,272
The type of power
where I'll never be nothing again.

481
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,477
You remind me of the guy
that brought me here...

482
00:27:00,114 --> 00:27:01,814
To this earth.

483
00:27:01,816 --> 00:27:07,553
He...He had so much
hate inside of him.

484
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,323
Took control over him.

485
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:13,392
I control The Dragon.

486
00:27:16,497 --> 00:27:18,330
It doesn't control me.

487
00:27:31,846 --> 00:27:34,513
We're here.

488
00:27:34,515 --> 00:27:36,382
You coming or not?

489
00:27:52,033 --> 00:27:55,067
Glad you decided
to come.

490
00:27:55,069 --> 00:27:57,536
Someone's got to make sure
you don't get yourself killed.

491
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,407
That's why I'm glad.

492
00:28:07,948 --> 00:28:09,715
If the Quadrant's
everything you say they are,

493
00:28:09,717 --> 00:28:11,350
they're gonna see
this coming.

494
00:28:11,352 --> 00:28:15,421
Maybe. Family can be
blinding.

495
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:23,262
What the hell?

496
00:28:30,738 --> 00:28:32,871
You think they saw
that coming?

497
00:28:52,076 --> 00:28:53,570
We got incoming!

498
00:28:53,572 --> 00:28:55,108
Sounds like a little bit
more than the 11 guys

499
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,776
he said there were.

500
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:59,011
Had to soften
the beach.

501
00:28:59,013 --> 00:29:01,147
C4 sends a message.

502
00:29:03,585 --> 00:29:05,484
Why don't you send
another one?

503
00:29:16,264 --> 00:29:18,097
Now the beach is soft.

504
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:31,811
Unh!

505
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,116
Agh!

506
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:55,768
I went through a lot of trouble
to get to this meeting.

507
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:58,037
It didn't have
to be, though.

508
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:00,573
You killed
my son.

509
00:30:00,575 --> 00:30:03,609
C4 killed your son.

510
00:30:03,864 --> 00:30:08,901
Do you have any
idea who I am, who we are?

511
00:30:08,903 --> 00:30:11,270
Yeah.

512
00:30:11,272 --> 00:30:12,955
That's why I wanted
to meet.

513
00:30:12,956 --> 00:30:14,455
If you know
who we are,

514
00:30:14,457 --> 00:30:15,957
you know I'm not
going to kill you

515
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:17,725
for what you did
to my boy.

516
00:30:17,727 --> 00:30:19,694
Well, that's a relief.

517
00:30:19,696 --> 00:30:22,297
I'm going to send you
someplace far away from here,

518
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:25,333
to a hospital I own.

519
00:30:25,335 --> 00:30:29,137
They know every way
there is to keep a man alive

520
00:30:29,139 --> 00:30:32,006
as other men carve
pieces out of him.

521
00:30:33,376 --> 00:30:38,413
Sure. Sure you could
go that way.

522
00:30:38,415 --> 00:30:39,948
You could try...

523
00:30:41,952 --> 00:30:43,651
But if you do,

524
00:30:43,653 --> 00:30:48,456
it'll cost you
billions annually.

525
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:51,993
Take him, but make sure
he doesn't die.

526
00:30:51,995 --> 00:30:53,361
Wait.

527
00:30:53,363 --> 00:30:55,630
He killed my boy.

528
00:30:55,632 --> 00:30:58,499
Frankly, I'm surprised your
idiot son made it this far.

529
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,038
Talk as if your life
depended upon it because it does.

530
00:31:07,444 --> 00:31:09,344
Like I said...

531
00:31:11,815 --> 00:31:14,182
It wasn't supposed
to be this way.

532
00:31:16,653 --> 00:31:18,553
Mr. Cartier's son...

533
00:31:22,292 --> 00:31:26,361
was supposed to arrange
this meeting without bloodshed,

534
00:31:26,363 --> 00:31:30,898
but Cartier senior,
he wanted to go another way.

535
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,735
Because you're not fit to be in
the same room as us.

536
00:31:33,737 --> 00:31:35,670
You're a street thug,

537
00:31:35,672 --> 00:31:38,673
not even qualified
to work on one of our crews.

538
00:31:38,675 --> 00:31:42,043
I came to this meeting

539
00:31:42,045 --> 00:31:44,712
because I have
a business proposition.

540
00:31:46,516 --> 00:31:49,117
You know what's happening
in Star City, right?

541
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:51,519
I see it's
falling apart.

542
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:53,054
I've seen chaos.

543
00:31:53,056 --> 00:31:55,089
No, no, no, no.

544
00:31:55,091 --> 00:31:57,458
Controlled chaos.

545
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,629
What you see
as dysfunction,

546
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:07,268
I see a machine running
on full efficiency.

547
00:32:08,838 --> 00:32:16,544
I control the PD,
city hall, the ports, the rails.

548
00:32:16,546 --> 00:32:20,715
I control everything,
and it could all be yours,

549
00:32:20,717 --> 00:32:26,054
all of it in exchange
for one thing,

550
00:32:26,056 --> 00:32:28,289
one thing.

551
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:34,062
A seat...

552
00:32:35,532 --> 00:32:37,932
At this table.

553
00:32:39,836 --> 00:32:42,503
I don't see
an empty chair.

554
00:32:42,505 --> 00:32:44,338
Even if there was one,
I would never sit

555
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,274
beside the man who killed
my own blood.

556
00:32:46,276 --> 00:32:48,876
He pushed me to it.

557
00:32:48,878 --> 00:32:55,917
And he pushed,
and he pushed, and he pushed.

558
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,620
A man's got
his limitations.

559
00:32:59,622 --> 00:33:02,457
And you are mine.

560
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:07,395
Look at you.

561
00:33:07,397 --> 00:33:09,831
A street thug

562
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:13,568
who couldn't even
keep himself out of prison.

563
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,503
You're nothing...

564
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,940
A loser.

565
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,650
Oh.

566
00:33:29,652 --> 00:33:33,087
Lookit here.

567
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:35,089
That's
an empty seat.

568
00:33:37,594 --> 00:33:40,995
We are successful
because we're deliberate,

569
00:33:40,997 --> 00:33:43,965
disciplined,
and precise.

570
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:46,755
We're not animals killing
each other for scraps.

571
00:33:47,431 --> 00:33:49,064
We are civilized.

572
00:33:49,066 --> 00:33:51,900
This is not,

573
00:33:51,902 --> 00:33:56,138
but your proposal
intrigues us, Mr. Diaz.

574
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,474
We'd like to hear more.

575
00:34:09,787 --> 00:34:14,523
Heh. Heh.

576
00:34:14,525 --> 00:34:16,492
Let's get started.

577
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,695
What's wrong?
You got what you wanted,

578
00:34:29,697 --> 00:34:31,530
you're not
a loser anymore.

579
00:34:31,532 --> 00:34:34,199
You are a legitimate
crime lord,

580
00:34:34,201 --> 00:34:36,101
and yet you still
seem on edge.

581
00:34:36,103 --> 00:34:38,137
You think a ring
and a seat at the table

582
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:40,873
changes things for me.

583
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:44,109
I think we ran a gauntlet because
you thought it would.

584
00:34:45,746 --> 00:34:48,547
It's not over yet.

585
00:34:48,549 --> 00:34:51,383
There's still one last thing
I have to take care of.

586
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:40,833
Can I help you?

587
00:35:43,337 --> 00:35:45,170
Oliver?

588
00:35:49,977 --> 00:35:53,178
There are no survivors
in the explosion

589
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,747
that consumed a city block

590
00:35:54,749 --> 00:35:56,782
in the Glades earlier
this evening.

591
00:35:56,784 --> 00:35:59,485
Given the power of the blast,
experts say that forensics

592
00:35:59,487 --> 00:36:02,821
may be required to determine
the fate of the Green Arrow.

593
00:36:02,823 --> 00:36:04,723
Oh. Go!

594
00:36:07,461 --> 00:36:08,927
Hey, you.

595
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:10,863
- Oh, my God!
- You ok?

596
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,667
Oh, my God!

597
00:36:15,669 --> 00:36:17,436
Oh, I saw the explosion
on the news,

598
00:36:17,438 --> 00:36:18,837
and you were right
in the middle of it.

599
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:20,339
Yeah. No. I fired

600
00:36:20,341 --> 00:36:21,974
a grappling arrow,
and I flew...

601
00:36:21,976 --> 00:36:23,342
- You--
- backwards right out of there.

602
00:36:23,344 --> 00:36:24,676
I'm f--I'm fine.

603
00:36:24,678 --> 00:36:26,545
- Well, I'm--I'm not!
- Ok.

604
00:36:26,547 --> 00:36:29,181
Worrying about you
out here is--

605
00:36:29,183 --> 00:36:31,784
well, it's completely different
from worrying about you in the bunker.

606
00:36:31,786 --> 00:36:33,519
Right, because when you're
in the bunker,

607
00:36:33,521 --> 00:36:35,387
you feel like you can
make a difference.

608
00:36:35,389 --> 00:36:38,757
I can. I can
make a difference.

609
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:41,927
I can--I can deploy backup.

610
00:36:41,929 --> 00:36:43,395
I can do--I don't know.

611
00:36:43,397 --> 00:36:46,431
I can do something.
Out here, I c--

612
00:36:48,068 --> 00:36:49,802
I'm helpless out here.

613
00:36:49,804 --> 00:36:54,706
You aren't helpless
anywhere ever,

614
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:57,409
but I'm not helpless
either, all right?

615
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,682
Made a promise
to that guy in there

616
00:37:03,684 --> 00:37:06,084
I would always
come back.

617
00:37:06,086 --> 00:37:08,220
Well, William made
an excellent point

618
00:37:08,222 --> 00:37:10,189
when he said you
coming back

619
00:37:10,191 --> 00:37:12,858
is not always gonna
be your decision.

620
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,327
William does make
excellent points,

621
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:19,798
but I made
the promise anyway.

622
00:37:21,035 --> 00:37:23,735
I'm making the same
promise to you

623
00:37:23,737 --> 00:37:25,804
right here
and right now.

624
00:37:27,741 --> 00:37:29,474
Felicity...

625
00:37:30,711 --> 00:37:32,744
I will always
come back.

626
00:37:50,231 --> 00:37:52,397
I've been waiting an hour.

627
00:37:54,935 --> 00:37:57,102
Get up the stairs.

628
00:37:59,974 --> 00:38:02,107
I know you hate waiting.

629
00:38:03,577 --> 00:38:06,745
Who's this?

630
00:38:06,747 --> 00:38:10,349
That last thing
I have to take care of.

631
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:12,217
I've got kids.

632
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:14,720
They need me. Please,
please don't hurt me.

633
00:38:14,722 --> 00:38:16,922
Whatever you want,
I can give it to you.

634
00:38:16,924 --> 00:38:20,425
You're lucky if you got
two dimes to rub together

635
00:38:20,427 --> 00:38:22,427
on a good day.

636
00:38:22,429 --> 00:38:26,965
How--how do you know me?

637
00:38:26,967 --> 00:38:30,869
What?

638
00:38:30,871 --> 00:38:34,006
What?

639
00:38:34,008 --> 00:38:36,508
How do I know you?

640
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,814
I've known you

641
00:38:42,816 --> 00:38:45,317
my whole life.

642
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:48,253
What?

643
00:38:48,255 --> 00:38:53,325
Laurel, meet
Jesse Fredericco.

644
00:38:53,327 --> 00:38:58,497
Jesse...
Meet Laurel.

645
00:38:58,499 --> 00:39:00,399
I don't think people are
supposed to know

646
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:03,368
that Laurel's working with
a crime lord.

647
00:39:05,372 --> 00:39:10,008
"Crime lord. Crime lord."

648
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,477
I love the sound of that.

649
00:39:15,482 --> 00:39:17,349
You really don't
remember me?

650
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,153
Hmm?

651
00:39:21,155 --> 00:39:23,055
Chillón?

652
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,593
Diaz?

653
00:39:30,698 --> 00:39:33,365
That is really
disappointing.

654
00:39:35,336 --> 00:39:39,237
I thought I made
a bigger impression.

655
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:41,406
On your knees.

656
00:39:44,311 --> 00:39:46,044
- Unh!
- Agh!

657
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:55,120
Hey. What
are you doing?

658
00:39:55,122 --> 00:39:57,622
Getting my payback.

659
00:40:01,695 --> 00:40:04,463
I think that this is a little bit
more than payback.

660
00:40:13,073 --> 00:40:15,374
Hey.

661
00:40:15,376 --> 00:40:17,142
See that?

662
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,214
I took this
from the fire.

663
00:40:25,586 --> 00:40:31,289
I stuck my hand
right in.

664
00:40:33,093 --> 00:40:36,395
I had blisters.

665
00:40:36,397 --> 00:40:39,831
I had raw, cracked skin!

666
00:40:42,903 --> 00:40:45,103
For weeks!

667
00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:50,075
Hey, Jesse.

668
00:40:50,077 --> 00:40:51,576
Hey.

669
00:40:54,848 --> 00:40:57,115
You still like fire?

670
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:06,324
Ricardo.

671
00:41:06,326 --> 00:41:09,127
I promised myself...

672
00:41:10,764 --> 00:41:13,098
When the time was right...

673
00:41:16,003 --> 00:41:18,170
That I'd get my payback...

674
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,174
When I wasn't a loser.
