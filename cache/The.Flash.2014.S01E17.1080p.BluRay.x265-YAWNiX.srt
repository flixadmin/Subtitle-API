1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:06,548
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:10,761
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,388
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,642
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,729
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:25,526
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:30,155
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,199
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,660
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,328
You're him, the Reverse-Flash.

11
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,372
I am Eobard Thawne...

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,873
and the Flash's speed...

13
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,709
Is the key to my returning to my time.

14
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,420
I've been teamed up
with Mason Bridge, who is a legend.

15
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,298
You're the guy who thinks
Wells is a mad genius.

16
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,133
What do you know about him?

17
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,722
I think that maybe you were right
about Dr. Wells.

18
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,933
- Which part?
- All of it.

19
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,450
Come on.

20
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,957
Sweet dreams, my beautiful boy.

21
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,906
- Mom! Mom!
- Barry!

22
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,783
- Stay back!
- Mom!

23
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,379
This is everything that we know
about Harrison Wells...

24
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,340
which is actually not a lot.

25
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,133
Didn't you read a book about him?

26
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:16,762
Six hundred pages and the big takeaway
is he's enigmatic.

27
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,767
Your mom was killed by a speedster.

28
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,977
Wells' machine turned you
into a speedster.

29
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,522
That's way too many coincidences
for this old cop.

30
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,821
Do you think that he wanted me
to become the Flash?

31
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,449
Everything he's done...

32
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,619
since that night
you got struck by lightning:

33
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,205
Bringing you to S.T.A.R. Labs,
giving you the suit...

34
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:47,542
training you.
It's all been to keep you safe.

35
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,960
And to make me faster.

36
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,131
Wells once said that he needed
more speed from me.

37
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,383
Why?

38
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,386
I don't know.

39
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,138
He wants something from you, Barry.

40
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,140
We just need to figure out what it is.

41
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,351
Let's go get him, let's get some answers.

42
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,895
We can't do that now
as much as we might want to.

43
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:10,482
Joe, you had your suspicions
about Wells from the very beginning.

44
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,859
You thought that he might be
the man in yellow.

45
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,487
Except the blood from your house
didn't match him.

46
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:18,198
All right, so maybe he's not
the Reverse-Flash.

47
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,950
You think he knows what happened.

48
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,577
He may have the key
to getting my dad out of prison.

49
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,163
Whatever Wells wants from you...

50
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,208
it started 15 years ago.

51
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,002
He's been patient.

52
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,587
Scary patient.

53
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,382
You gotta listen to me on this.

54
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,008
We have to be...

55
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,886
just as patient.

56
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,596
Yeah.

57
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,152
Oh, wow.

58
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,116
Wow. Look.

59
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,123
Wow.

60
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,316
Henry?

61
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,776
Henry!

62
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,945
Henry!

63
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,740
Henry!

64
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,450
Henry.

65
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,160
Nice name.

66
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,086
Tricked you. Ha, ha.

67
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,422
Look who's back.

68
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,840
My tricks.

69
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,550
My treat.

70
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,762
But I'll give you something good...

71
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,847
To eat.

72
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,849
Today's special:

73
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,560
A city in ashes.

74
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,438
The Trickster proudly welcomes you all...

75
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,440
Io the new...

76
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,359
disorder.

77
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,070
Talking in the third person.
That's never a good sign.

78
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,031
- You're mad because he named himself.
- Actually, he didn't.

79
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,868
Twenty years ago, Central City was hit
by a series of terrorist attacks.

80
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:30,038
One man killed at least 10 civilians,
two cops.

81
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,207
That guy called himself the Trickster.

82
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,002
Whoa. Someone was rocking the unitard.

83
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,213
James Jesse?

84
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,298
Like Jesse James, only more twisted.

85
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,300
Where is this Mr. Jesse now?

86
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,137
He's serving several life sentences
at Iron Heights.

87
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,224
He was the most dangerous thing
Central City had ever seen.

88
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,269
You mean until the particle accelerator
blew up.

89
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,187
- Um...
- Barry and I...

90
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,731
will go see this James Jesse
at Iron Heights.

91
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,943
See if he can give us something
that can help us catch his groupie.

92
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,988
I'll analyze the video
and see if I can figure out the source.

93
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:04,906
Hey, Joe.

94
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:06,658
Barry doing all right?

95
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,034
He seems cranky.

96
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,997
Even the Flash wakes up on the wrong side
of the bed some mornings.

97
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,999
He's fine.

98
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,588
Mom!

99
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,132
Nora, hold on!

100
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,175
Run, Barry. Run!

101
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,659
Gideon, what's happening to me?

102
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:53,455
Your latest time jump against the Flash
caused a massive drain on your powers.

103
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,624
Your cells contain no trace
of the Speed Force.

104
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,585
- That's impossible.
- Your ability to move at super-speed...

105
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,796
as well as travel in time
has been completely depleted.

106
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,466
How am I supposed to get back?

107
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,468
You can't.

108
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,531
I've never seen this part
of the prison before.

109
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,786
I had to have this cell specially built
for James Jesse about five years ago.

110
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,288
- Why's that?
- A criminal psychologist set up...

111
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:36,748
weekly visits with him.

112
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,418
James talked the shrink
into committing suicide.

113
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,756
Oh. You're gonna need these.

114
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,592
Okay.

115
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,984
Gentlemen.

116
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,278
Please, be seated.

117
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,243
I'm Detective Joe West.
This is Barry Allen.

118
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,454
Uh, we'd like to ask you a few questions.

119
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,040
Mm...

120
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,210
I can smell them in your pocket.

121
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,593
Yesterday, hundreds
of these parachute bombs...

122
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:33,763
were released throughout Central City.

123
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,352
Huh. Fun idea.

124
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:43,189
But not an effective delivery system.

125
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,607
How many died?

126
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:45,900
No one. Luckily.

127
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,487
You know, when I was free
and at my height...

128
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,365
a day without casualties was like...

129
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,702
Well, like the Cubs winning the pennant.

130
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,620
It just never happened.

131
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,085
The explosives I found
in the parachute bombs...

132
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:07,464
had the same explosive composition
as the bombs you set off...

133
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,633
- 20 years ago.
- That's impossible.

134
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,427
I never told anyone that formula.

135
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,471
The signatures are an exact match.

136
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,891
He called himself the Trickster too,
just like you.

137
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:22,228
He is nothing like me, detective.
Nothing.

138
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,314
Do you know...

139
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,399
who he is?

140
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,866
Oh...

141
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,039
If I did...

142
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,665
I would tell you.

143
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,084
So you could find him...

144
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,212
cut off his head,
and throw it right in his face.

145
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,256
No, this is obviously the work...

146
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,884
of a rank amateur at best.

147
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,097
A mere pretender angling for my throne.

148
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,724
I hear you.

149
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,601
So...

150
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,146
Help us catch him.

151
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,190
Prove there's only one Trickster.

152
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:14,531
Trying to trick the Trickster, Joseph, hmm?

153
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:17,909
No.

154
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,829
There's only one way...

155
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,498
this could happen.

156
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,625
Whoever he is...

157
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:29,212
he must have found my lair.

158
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,674
I ask only one thing.

159
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,592
When you find this...

160
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,928
shtick stealer, this gimmick grabber...

161
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,181
this pathetic, wannabe fake...

162
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,308
make sure...

163
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,519
your safety's off.

164
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,155
Something's happened to Mason Bridge.

165
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,865
No one has seen or heard from him.

166
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,242
He's a journalist, Iris.
Maybe he's on a story.

167
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,953
Then why hasn't he answered his phone
or his e-mails?

168
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,664
Maybe he stumbled on the wrong story
and is laying low.

169
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,207
You don't know him like I do.

170
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:09,002
When Mason's on a story,
nothing is getting in his way.

171
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,421
I mean, he considers threats
minor annoyances.

172
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,258
Maybe he's on a bender, or he met a girl
worth disappearing for a week over.

173
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,094
He said something weird
was going on at S.T.A.R. Labs.

174
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:22,432
Eddie, something has happened to him.
Something bad, I can feel it.

175
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,725
Please.

176
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,061
Captain Singh has everyone
on the Central City park bomber...

177
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,231
but as soon as I can, I'll
look into Bridge. I promise.

178
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,275
Okay.

179
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,365
This looks like nobody has been here
since the '90s.

180
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:41,784
Yeah, look at this thing.

181
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,829
You think Jesse doesn't know
who this new Trickster guy is?

182
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,456
He seemed pretty ticked off...

183
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,709
that someone was besmirching
his bad name.

184
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,544
Joe.

185
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,308
Let's see what he's got stashed in there.

186
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,559
Yeah.

187
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,822
- Damn.
- You good?

188
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,996
The copycat.

189
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,207
He took everything.

190
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,888
- Hey, can we have a second?
- Yeah, sure.

191
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,139
Dad.

192
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,516
- Hey.
- Barry.

193
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,893
Hey.

194
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:51,604
What are you doing here?

195
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:55,149
Uh, Joe and I have some questions
for an inmate about a bombing case.

196
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,402
Dad, listen.

197
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,695
I'm close.

198
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,072
The man who put you in here,
I'm getting close.

199
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,449
- Closer than I've ever been.
- Barry.

200
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,910
- We have talked about this.
- I know.

201
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,495
And I'm done talking.

202
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,291
You're not gonna pay
for another man's crime anymore.

203
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,335
Just hang in there, okay?

204
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,379
Joe.

205
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:20,341
- What's he talking about?
- Like he said, Henry, just hang in there.

206
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,891
What, no candy, fellas?

207
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,853
That storage space you sent us to
was booby-trapped.

208
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:36,399
You can never be too careful
with your private things.

209
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,942
You were protecting nothing.

210
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,444
Your secret stash was empty.

211
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,695
What do you mean?

212
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,614
No firearms,
none of your explosives, nothing.

213
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,118
Whatever you had in there, it was stolen.
All of it.

214
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,828
No.

215
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,456
He's stealing my legacy.

216
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,166
Whoever this is...

217
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,336
you need to find him.
I will not let this, this...

218
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,172
- Trickster?
- That is my name, mine.

219
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,465
What was in that room?

220
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,924
What were you keeping there?

221
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,551
A bomb.

222
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,970
A really big bomb.

223
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,139
How big?

224
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,267
Bye-bye, Central City.

225
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,854
- Cisco?
- Yo.

226
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,900
This Trickster guy just posted a vlog, you
gotta see this. I'm sending you the link.

227
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,443
Okay.

228
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,404
Denizens of Central City.

229
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:27,283
Or those of you who remain.

230
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:31,454
Welcome to Boom Day, ha-ha-ha.

231
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:35,208
I'm very proud to report that my
first trick was an exploding success.

232
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,628
- Show him.
- But I think you all deserve...

233
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,172
something much, uh...

234
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,132
- bigger.
- No, no, no.

235
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,717
So for my next trick...

236
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,552
Take off my mask, you fraud.

237
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,679
Keep your eyes
glued to this website.

238
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,015
Pretender. Sham.

239
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,518
What The Trickster
has planned for you all...

240
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,437
- Take off my mask.
- Ladies and gentlemen.

241
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,439
Take off my mask!

242
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,910
This was posted a few hours ago.

243
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,620
Whoever this Trickster is...

244
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,038
he's certainly not shy.

245
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,582
Not every criminal
likes to hide in the dark.

246
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,087
Cisco, can you trace
where the video was posted from?

247
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,380
I tried.

248
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,466
But this guy is using some crazy,
Felicity-caliber scrambler...

249
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,759
like I've never seen.

250
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,720
The origin of the upload's
coming from hundreds of locations.

251
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,306
Until he uploads another video,
it's gonna be tough.

252
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,559
He has the capability to destroy the city.

253
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,395
Hey, I said tough, not impossible.

254
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,772
Barry, we'll catch him. We always do.

255
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,399
Mr. Allen.

256
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,985
A word, please.

257
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,831
I know what's going on with you.

258
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,631
I know what you're thinking.

259
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,967
Do you?

260
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,972
I know going to Iron Heights
and conversing with Mr. Jesse...

261
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,517
has brought about feelings
of your father. How could it not?

262
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,811
Yeah, no, it's, uh...

263
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,521
It's been...

264
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,232
really tough knowing
that my mom's Killer...

265
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,151
is still out there.

266
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,029
Of course.

267
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,031
But we'll find him.

268
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,241
Together. You have my word.

269
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,118
Thank you.

270
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,537
But for now...

271
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:40,958
how about we focus on finding this
Trickster before anybody else gets hurt?

272
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,257
I have to go.

273
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:52,011
But thanks for the pep talk.

274
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,554
I'm always here for you.

275
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,980
A team of research laboratories
unconnected to the government...

276
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,317
unconnected to any business interests,
or any of that stuff.

277
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,861
We build right downtown
in the heart of the city...

278
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,072
In the epicenter, and we become...

279
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,075
the heart of the city.
We become the heart of the nation.

280
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,203
We change what you think
about the sciences and then...

281
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:20,706
What?

282
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,210
Just that my father would've loved you...

283
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,796
as much as I do.

284
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,007
Well, I wish...

285
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,385
I could've met him.

286
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,769
Oh.

287
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:46,607
- What would you call these laboratories?
- Well, we, Tess Morgan...

288
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,735
would call them
the Technological Engineering...

289
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,112
Scientific Studies...

290
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,781
or T.E.S.S. for short.

291
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,950
Well, that is very...

292
00:17:56,117 --> 00:18:00,204
very sweet, but how about:

293
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,959
Scientific and Technological...

294
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,753
Advanced Research Laboratories...

295
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,089
0rl...

296
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,843
S.T.A.R. Labs for short?

297
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,637
Because...

298
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,431
in the vast night sky...

299
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,057
you, Harrison Wells...

300
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,643
are the only star I see.

301
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,149
That's gonna get you kissed.

302
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,717
You're a full-time reporter now.

303
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,302
Why are we meeting here?

304
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,181
I still have a key.

305
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,682
And this is...

306
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,893
kind of our place, right?

307
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,649
What's up?

308
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:14,528
My co-worker, Mason Bridge, is missing.

309
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,198
He's not at home,
he's not answering his phone.

310
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,783
I mean, it's not like him.

311
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,786
I'm really worried
that something bad has happened.

312
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,622
I'm sure he's fine.

313
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,708
That's what Eddie says,
that's what everyone is saying.

314
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,503
Please, will you look into it?

315
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,129
For me?

316
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,341
For you.

317
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,719
Thanks.

318
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,181
Um...

319
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,933
Are you okay?

320
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,727
You seem like you have...

321
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,312
a heavy heart.

322
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,069
Sometimes I'm not sure
why I wear a mask with you.

323
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,489
Well, maybe one day you'll take it off.

324
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:02,284
Heads up, Trickster's broadcasting again.

325
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,204
Can I borrow your laptop?

326
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,872
Um...

327
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,582
Sure, help...

328
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,627
Help yourself.

329
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,671
Get ready for the games to begin!

330
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,923
I have...

331
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,508
a bomb.

332
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,093
It's a big bomb.

333
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,262
It will make a big bang...

334
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,098
and then a big hole,
and then a big drop...

335
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,851
In the population.

336
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,271
But never say...

337
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,231
the Trickster...

338
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,482
Is not fair.

339
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,360
The bomb is somewhere...

340
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,487
between 52nd Street...

341
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:39,864
and Avenue B.

342
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:45,077
I want all units, every uniform,
every detective searching that area now.

343
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,705
Somehow, we need to alert the Flash.

344
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,207
Something tells me he already knows.

345
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,046
Guys, I can't find it.

346
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,592
- I need your help.
- There's nothing on traffic cams or CCTV.

347
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,304
I retasked S.T.A.R. Labs' satellite
to scan the area for incendiary devices.

348
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,140
Bomb that large
should be giving off a thermal signature.

349
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,641
Then why can't you find it?

350
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,143
Because it's a trick.

351
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,561
The bomb's not there.

352
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,480
It has to be. I'm gonna keep looking.

353
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:16,150
That is what he wants, you and the police
to keep running around in circles.

354
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,403
There is something else going on.
I can feel it. Trust me.

355
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,782
I'm gonna keep looking.

356
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,409
- Barry.
- Why doesn't he just listen to you?

357
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,255
I found it.

358
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,153
Uh-oh.
There's an explosion at Iron Heights.

359
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:04,532
- This was all a diversion.
- The prison was the real target.

360
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,660
James Jesse.

361
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,620
I guess he's tricked us all.

362
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,791
Joe. There's no bomb in the city.

363
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,127
It was a diversion so the Trickster
could help James Jesse escape.

364
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,090
I know, we just got surveillance footage
from Iron Heights.

365
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,842
Jesse got away.

366
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,553
Barry, look, they took a hostage.

367
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,304
Well, who'd he take?

368
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,223
A guard? The warden?

369
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,642
No, your dad.

370
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,489
You have to admit.

371
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:49,577
That was one hell of a trick.

372
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:02,131
I cannot believe
we're finally in the same room.

373
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,550
I mean, you're my hero.

374
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,635
You need a better role model, kid.

375
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,889
Can't you see? He's just using you.

376
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,557
Why did we bring him along?

377
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,183
Huh?

378
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,728
Because his son works for the C.C.P.D.

379
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,355
Should we find ourselves in a jam...

380
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,442
a cop's dad makes
an excellent bargaining chip.

381
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,027
Right.

382
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:26,780
I wouldn't worry too much
about what the cops might do to you.

383
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:30,618
- Really?
- If the police aren't able to find you, trust me...

384
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,411
the Flash will.

385
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,039
Here's hoping.

386
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,666
So, what's next?

387
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,794
In your last letter, you said
you had something big in mind.

388
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,923
I've had 20 years to come up
with the perfect trick.

389
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,133
It's going to be...

390
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,760
my masterpiece.

391
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,304
My Mona Lisa...

392
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,806
my Breaking Bad season five.

393
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:56,310
They gave me cable in prison
so I'd stop killing the guards.

394
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,312
Right.

395
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,482
There's just one thing
I've been dying to ask.

396
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,402
Why did you choose me?

397
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,988
Because...

398
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:11,492
I knew you had the strength
to fulfill my legacy.

399
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,286
Besides...

400
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:18,499
it was in your blood.

401
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,670
What do you mean, in my blood?

402
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,007
The real reason I tracked you down...

403
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,717
and groomed you to be...

404
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,762
the best you could possibly be, Axel:

405
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,976
Am your father.

406
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,480
Really?

407
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,367
We were able to identify
the other Trickster.

408
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,494
His name's Axel Walker, age 25.

409
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:59,373
Him and James have been corresponding
through snail mail for over a decade.

410
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,375
I should've been there.

411
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,794
- We're gonna find your dad, okay?
- Definitely.

412
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,716
I guess I should've listened to you.

413
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,394
- Sorry, I am so tired.
- Hmm.

414
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:24,273
I think I'm just gonna put on my pajamas,
go straight to bed when we get home.

415
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,400
- Really?
- No.

416
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,154
Definitely not wearing pajamas.

417
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:31,572
Hello.

418
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,596
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

419
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,397
No, no, no, Tess.

420
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:06,940
Tess, Tess.

421
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:08,942
Hello, hold on.

422
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,570
Tess, Tess.

423
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,405
Oh, oh, thank God.

424
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,449
Help me, please, help me.

425
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:20,120
She's... She's... Help...

426
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:23,332
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Help. Call someone.

427
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:28,545
- Call someone. Can't you see? She's dying.
- This woman has been dead for centuries.

428
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,969
Help!

429
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,650
You okay?

430
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,985
Do you think my dad is still alive?

431
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,404
Yes, yes, he is. Of course.

432
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,324
Jesse only took your pop
to use as leverage.

433
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,451
He might be crazy, but he's not stupid.

434
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,663
And everyone upstairs
is looking to find him.

435
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:04,581
So...

436
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,836
now I'm supposed to just leave
my dad's fate in the hands of a man...

437
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,922
who may have had something to do
with my mom's murder.

438
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:18,512
- Joe, I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

439
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:22,015
This doesn't make any sense.
I mean, if Wells is a murderer...

440
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,642
why does he wanna help me?

441
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:27,855
Why has he helped me stop
sO many criminals, or saved Ronnie?

442
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,358
Why didn't I see this?

443
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:34,695
I spent a tenth as much time
with him as you did.

444
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:36,530
He almost had me believing in him.

445
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,365
Almost.

446
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,450
Look.

447
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,203
Whatever else he is...

448
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,997
he is Harrison Wells.

449
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:50,919
You love science, he is science. It's like
you made best friends with Einstein.

450
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,006
You're saying I wanted to be tricked.

451
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,801
You always wanna be the person
who sees the best in people.

452
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,554
I've been a cop for 25 years.
All I can see...

453
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,640
is the flaws, the lies.

454
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,810
The dark thoughts
that people think I don't see.

455
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,314
I wish I could be you.

456
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,692
As fast as you are...

457
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,320
that is your real power.

458
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,239
Don't let Wells take that from you.

459
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,867
I don't know...

460
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,703
why he's helping us.

461
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,705
All that matters...

462
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,498
is that he is.

463
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:35,172
- I can't lose my dad, Joe.
- Barr.

464
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,841
Barr.

465
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,384
Come on.

466
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,929
Come on, come on.

467
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:54,399
Hi. Iris West,
I'm with Central City Picture News.

468
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,109
Thanks.

469
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,657
- Champagne, miss?
- Ah, thank you. Heh.

470
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,411
We're almost out of champagne.

471
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,873
Then the fun's about to begin.

472
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,720
Oh, Mayor Bellows.

473
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,015
- Hi. This is a lovely party.
- Thank you.

474
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:31,436
Welcome, welcome, Central City's finest.

475
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,938
How about a toast?

476
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,815
To Mayor Anthony Bellows.

477
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:37,484
He doesn't just yell at his staff...

478
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:39,152
he bellows.

479
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,658
You see what I did there
with the word play and the...?

480
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,952
- Tough crowd.
- Excuse me.

481
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,829
Who are you?

482
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,039
How quickly they forget.

483
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,666
James Jesse, your honor.

484
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:56,962
A.K.A., ha-ha-ha, the Trickster.

485
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,631
And I'm here to relieve you fine people...

486
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,050
from all your money. Because we know...

487
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,344
if you're in this room, oh, ha, ha...

488
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,513
you've got loads of it.

489
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,224
What makes you think that anyone
would give you a cent?

490
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,600
Because...

491
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:15,022
that champagne they just slurped down
like so much fruit punch?

492
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,858
I added a little something special to it.

493
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:21,028
Trimethylmercury-32.

494
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,362
Poison.

495
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:27,951
Without the antidote, you'll begin
to feel the effects in about, oh, um...

496
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,787
- One hour.
- One hour.

497
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,624
I remember you.

498
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,794
You got to the party about an hour early.

499
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:41,381
I offered you the very first glass
of champagne.

500
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,721
An hour is plenty of time
for all of you to call your bankers...

501
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,724
and transfer everything you have
to the account number...

502
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,851
on the bottom of your glass.

503
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,395
Once my young friend and I are rich...

504
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,647
you'll get the antidote.

505
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,401
If any of you decide
to call 911 instead, well...

506
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,404
then we switch to lead poisoning.

507
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,425
- Anything?
- I'm scanning traffic cams.

508
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,869
- I got nothing.
- Hey, baby.

509
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,746
Iris?

510
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:19,669
How many of you feel the trimethylene-32
coursing through your veins?

511
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,048
- That's him, that's Jesse.
- Can you ping her phone?

512
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,508
I'm on it.

513
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,511
Trimethylmercury-32
is a relatively fast-acting poison.

514
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,389
- Is there a cure?
- Yes. We can synthesize the antidote.

515
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,140
Cisco, where is she?

516
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,643
- City Hall.
- The mayor's having a fundraiser.

517
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,145
Barry, do not underestimate the Trickster.

518
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,444
Well, hello.

519
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,571
You know, ahem...

520
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,907
I've been in prison for 20 years.

521
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,618
Then you'll know the routine
when you get sent back.

522
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,287
Where's Henry Allen?

523
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:56,623
He's where you'll be soon. Heaven.

524
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,794
Are you familiar with the movie Speed?

525
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,963
Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock?

526
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,798
You're the bus and that's the bomb.

527
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,801
Kinetic bomb, actually.
If you go below 600 miles per hour...

528
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,469
it'll explode.

529
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,097
Same thing happens
if you try to remove it.

530
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:15,934
Ooh! It's active, run, run, run.

531
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,108
Cisco.

532
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,819
He wasn't lying.
That thing's linked to a speedometer.

533
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,946
It will blow if you stop moving.

534
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:29,489
I can't run forever.

535
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,492
There's gotta be a way to get it off him
without damaging it.

536
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,745
- Barry, do you see any walls nearby?
- Why?

537
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:40,125
Because I need you to run into one.
Or more accurately, through one.

538
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,501
What?

539
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,338
If you vibrate
at the natural frequency of air...

540
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,508
your body, your cells,
will be in a state of excitement...

541
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:51,636
that should allow you to phase...

542
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:55,140
right through that wall.
Leaving the bomb on the other side.

543
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:58,810
- Should?
- You can do this, I believe in you.

544
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:02,689
- I can't.
- Listen to me, Barry. Breathe.

545
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,275
Breathe.

546
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:06,860
Feel the air.

547
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,779
Feel that wind on your face.

548
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,156
Feel the ground.

549
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:15,660
Your feet lifting you up,
pushing you forward, and the lightning.

550
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,245
Barry.

551
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,998
Feel the lightning.

552
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,791
Feel its power.

553
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,629
Its electricity pumping through your veins.

554
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,298
Crackling through you...

555
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:33,011
traveling to every nerve
in your body like a shock.

556
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,764
You're no longer you now.

557
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,308
You're part of something greater.

558
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:41,061
You're part of a Speed Force.

559
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,272
It's yours.

560
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,406
Now do it.

561
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:11,341
- How?
- Barry?

562
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,343
Oh! That felt weird.

563
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,847
I'm good.

564
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,599
Ooh, I like it.

565
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:22,686
Look at that. Lobsters on me, kid.

566
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:33,405
It's okay, you've all been given
an antidote.

567
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,615
That wasn't very sanitary.

568
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:39,369
Where's Henry Allen?
You're going to prison either way, James.

569
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,432
All right.

570
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,778
You always did look good in red.

571
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,126
Wow.

572
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:32,339
Half of this stuff didn't even exist
when I was practicing.

573
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:37,010
I'd be happy to give you a crash course
on all of it if you get out.

574
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,095
I'm gonna shut up now.

575
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:40,639
That's okay.

576
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,724
Dr. Allen?

577
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,435
- Yes?
- I'm feeling the need to give you a hug.

578
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,897
Absolutely, I will always accept a hug.

579
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,191
Thank you.

580
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,325
You gotta tell me:

581
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:04,788
What does it feel like when you're running
down the street like a bat out of hell?

582
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,211
There's no feeling like it.

583
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,047
I bet.

584
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:21,805
Actually, you're all heroes in my book.
Especially you, Dr. Wells.

585
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,558
Thank you.
For everything that you've done for my son.

586
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:29,312
Well, your son is an extraordinary man,
Dr. Allen.

587
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:33,650
I will do everything in my power
to ensure Barry's future.

588
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,711
It's time, Joe.

589
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,254
- No.
- No?

590
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,340
- No.
- Okay.

591
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:04,097
It seemed like you could use a hug too.

592
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,100
Your father's an extraordinary man.

593
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,561
You're lucky to have him.

594
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:14,023
I'm lucky to have you too.

595
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,563
Who are you?

596
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,733
My name is Eobard Thawne.

597
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:01,237
But that name doesn't matter, not anymore.
It won't matter for many years.

598
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:06,242
The only thing that really matters
is who you are. Harrison Wells.

599
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,162
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

600
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:13,666
In 2020, you and your wife, Tess Morgan...

601
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:17,629
successfully launched a particle
accelerator that changed history.

602
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,924
I need it to happen a bit sooner
if I'm going to get back.

603
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,675
Much sooner.

604
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,595
What is that?

605
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,472
My way home.

606
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:30,683
You see...

607
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,852
they're not coming to save you.

608
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,940
They're coming to save me.

609
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,317
Hi, Joe.

610
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:26,030
- Desk sergeant said you're looking for me.
- Hey, yeah, um...

611
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,203
Sit down.

612
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,206
It's about Iris.

613
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,918
She's looking into Mason Bridge's
disappearance.

614
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,920
We can't let that happen.

615
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,761
Detective.

616
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:04,903
Eddie, we need your help.

617
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:12,535
Brazil?

618
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,245
Why would...

619
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:17,248
Mason move to Brazil?

620
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,543
Apparently there was a girl involved.

621
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:24,380
And he decided to go hike the Amazon
with her for a year.

622
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:27,759
You know, live off the grid,
write his memoirs or something.

623
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,136
Wow, I guess you really don't know anyone.

624
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:33,973
- No, you don't.
- Hey, baby. Everything good?

625
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,768
Yeah, yeah, of course. Um...

626
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,979
- Dinner will be ready in a jiff, okay?
- Okay.

627
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,485
She buy it?

628
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,071
I think so.

629
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,115
Keeping her in the
dark, it's for her safety.

630
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:53,826
That is debatable
and we will have that debate.

631
00:40:54,494 --> 00:40:57,330
But for right now, what's our next move?

632
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,291
How do we figure out what Wells is up to?

633
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:04,504
When Wells was talking me through
phasing...

634
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:07,256
So I could get the Trickster's bomb
off my wrist...

635
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:11,511
the way that he described
my being the Flash running...

636
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,137
feeling the wind...

637
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:15,139
and the power...

638
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,185
it's like he was
talking from experience.

639
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:21,354
What are you saying?

640
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,189
I don't know how...

641
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:25,650
but he's the man in yellow.

642
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:29,487
Harrison Wells is the Reverse-Flash.

643
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,326
I got an 11-80, possible 10-54...

644
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,249
Copy that, units en route to your location.

645
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,878
Sir, we're gonna get you out of here.

646
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:49,549
Can you tell me your name?
Do you know who you are?

647
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,552
My name...

648
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,179
IS...

649
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,975
