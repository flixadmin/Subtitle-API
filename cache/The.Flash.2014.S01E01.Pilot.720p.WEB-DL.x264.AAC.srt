00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,638
To understand what I'm
about to tell you,

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,606
You need to do
something first.

4
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,809
You need to believe
in the impossible.

5
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:11,644
Can you do that?
Good.

6
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:12,978
You see that red blur?

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,847
That's me.

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,849
That too.

9
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:20,786
There I am again.

10
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:22,655
My name is Barry Allen.

11
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:24,623
I am the fastest man alive.

12
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,596
My story is pretty simple.

13
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:32,631
My whole life,
I have been running.

14
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:33,999
Usually from bullies.

15
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,569
Sometimes I escaped.

16
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:38,737
Sometimes I did not.

17
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,406
Tell me what happened.

18
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:42,341
Those guys were
picking on kids

19
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:44,810
just 'cause they thought
they weren't cool.

20
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:47,112
- It wasn't right.
- I know.

21
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:49,281
- I guess I wasn't fast enough.
- No.

22
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:52,017
You have such
a good heart, Barry.

23
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:55,120
And it's better to have
a good heart than fast legs.

24
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,423
Hello.
I'm home.

25
00:00:57,425 --> 00:00:59,825
- Barry got into a fight.
- Oh, yeah?

26
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:00,893
And he won.

27
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:04,063
Ah, way to go, slugger.

28
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:07,466
Oh, and uh, no more fighting.

29
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:08,500
Mm-mm.

30
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,585
But after that night,

31
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,854
I was running
from something much scarier.

32
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:31,223
- Something I could never explain.
- Henry! Henry!

33
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:34,159
Something impossible.

34
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,161
Help!

35
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:38,564
- Mom! Mom!
- Barry, don't!

36
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:41,200
- Mom!
- Don't let him touch you!

37
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:43,569
Mom!

38
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:45,237
Mom!

39
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,473
- Nora!
- Stay back!

40
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:49,909
Nora, hold on!

41
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:53,913
Run, Barry, run!

42
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:55,814
Mom?

43
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:57,650
Dad?

44
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,698
Sorry.

45
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,466
Second robbery this week.

46
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,635
The teller ID'd Clyde Mardon
as the shooter.

47
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,070
What?

48
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:19,805
Oh, jeez, the Mardon brothers
are back?

49
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,473
What do we got?

50
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,275
Perps took the bank,
shot out the cameras,

51
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,811
And as a chaser, killed
the security guard over there.

52
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,313
I've got unis
kicking in doors

53
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:28,814
of known Mardon brothers
associates.

54
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,816
CSI been over it?

55
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,718
Uh, no.

56
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,421
Where's Allen?

57
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:38,924
Sorry, sorry.

58
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:40,559
You can't keep
covering for him.

59
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,428
- CSI, CSI coming through.
- If he's not here now,

60
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,796
I'm gonna have to carry on this
investigation without him.

61
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:45,130
Sorry I'm late,
Captain Singh.

62
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,799
What was it this time,
Mr.. Allen?

63
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:48,267
Did you forget to set
your alarm clock?

64
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:49,802
Before you answer,
I should remind you

65
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:51,904
the excuse you gave last time
was car trouble.

66
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:53,472
Want to know why that one
was particularly memorable?

67
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:55,074
I do not own a car.

68
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:56,642
He was running
an errand for me.

69
00:02:56,644 --> 00:03:01,146
Barry, did you get me
what I asked for?

70
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,948
Yeah, yeah.
I did.

71
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,685
I have it right...

72
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,321
Here.

73
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,457
I had a few bites of it.

74
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,844
Getaway car's
a Mustang Shelby GT500.

75
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:34,279
Shelby's have a rear
super-wide tire

76
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,781
specific to that model.

77
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:39,018
12 inches with
an asymmetrical tread.

78
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,121
And there's something else.

79
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:43,789
Thanks.

80
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,795
Fecal excrement.

81
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:51,463
Animal, I'd guess.

82
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,966
My dad gave me that pen...

83
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,702
Before he died.

84
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,370
Sorry.

85
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:13,285
Okay, I am ready to see
this atom smasher smashing.

86
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,387
There was a shooting today.

87
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,556
Your dad needs me
to process some evidence,

88
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:18,991
Which means I don't know
if we're going

89
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:20,692
to be able to make it
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

90
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,062
But seeing this thing turn on
is like your dream.

91
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:24,997
Your sad, little nerdy dream.

92
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,365
Besides, I canceled
a date for this.

93
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:29,001
Hands off my fries.

94
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:30,536
Unbelievable.

95
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:33,238
I'm stress eating
over my dissertation.

96
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,907
We started selling cronuts
at jitters.

97
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:36,942
I ate two today.
If I don't graduate soon,

98
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,378
I'm gonna be
more muffin top than woman.

99
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,746
You look amazing.

100
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:45,617
What is so important

101
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,053
about this
particle accelerator anyway?

102
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,522
Harrison Wells' work
in quantum theory

103
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,524
is light-years ahead of anything
they're doing at CERN.

104
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:55,928
You're doing that thing where
you're not speaking English.

105
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,663
Okay.

106
00:04:57,665 --> 00:05:00,399
Just imagine

107
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:04,269
that that dot is everything
the human race

108
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,105
has ever learned
until this moment.

109
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:07,439
Does that include "twerking"?

110
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,341
That is everything
we could learn

111
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:10,943
from the particle accelerator.

112
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:12,744
It's a whole new way
of looking at physics.

113
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,113
It will literally
change the way

114
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:16,448
that we think
about everything.

115
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,350
You got to get yourself
a girlfriend.

116
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,185
Hey, leave him alone.
He's working.

117
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,287
Hi, dad.

118
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:26,125
- Your test thingy is done.
- Yeah.

119
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:28,427
I think the Mardon brothers
are hiding on a farm.

120
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:31,263
The fecal matter I found on
the street, it was cow manure,

121
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:33,899
Which contained traces
of oxytetracycline.

122
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,400
It's an antibiotic.

123
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,136
There are only four farms
in the area

124
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:39,271
that still use it
in their feed.

125
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:42,474
Bet you find a really sweet
Shelby parked at one of them.

126
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,610
Dad, seeing as how Barry
solved your poop problem,

127
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:48,080
How about letting him go
to S.T.A.R. Labs?

128
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:51,850
- Fine, go.
- Yes!

129
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,852
Thank you, Joe.

130
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,661
So, Barry, how was your trip?

131
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:05,631
Did you find proof of the
impossible in starling city,

132
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:10,002
Or did you just make my dad
mad for no reason?

133
00:06:10,004 --> 00:06:12,004
Actually, while I was away,

134
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:14,873
I had a chance
to think about...

135
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,642
You know, relationships.

136
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:19,378
And, well, I'm not in one.

137
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,748
And you're not in one,
either.

138
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,917
And you're my best friend,
Iris.

139
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:26,652
You're mine too.

140
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:28,120
Why else would I be here?

141
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:29,955
That's not what I meant.
What I...

142
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:30,989
I know what you're
gonna say, Barry.

143
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,357
I'm not sure you do.

144
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,892
Even though
we pretty much grew up

145
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,494
in the same house together,

146
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:38,497
And we're kind of like
brother and sister,

147
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,032
Because we're not
brother and sister,

148
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:42,568
It can get really weird
and awkward

149
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,669
to talk to me about girls.

150
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:44,970
But I just want you to know

151
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:47,005
that it shouldn't be awkward.

152
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,473
There is nothing
that I want more

153
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:49,841
than for you
to meet the right person

154
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:52,144
that totally loves
and adores you

155
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:55,647
for the amazing guy
that you are.

156
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,251
Took the words
right out of my mouth.

157
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,253
Aw, aren't you glad
I know you so well?

158
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,297
Thank you.

159
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,733
My name is Harrison Wells.

160
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:18,036
Tonight, the future begins.

161
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,806
The work my team
and I will do here

162
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:23,108
will change our understanding
of physics.

163
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,744
We'll bring about
advancements in power,

164
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,779
Advancements in medicine,

165
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,314
and trust me, that future

166
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,416
will be here faster
than you think.

167
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,588
Oh, hey, my laptop!
It's got my dissertation.

168
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,764
I'm sorry.

169
00:07:57,278 --> 00:08:00,145
All right, kid, you don't have
to do this, all right?

170
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,546
Just give me back
my friend's bag,

171
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,849
And we'll call it even.

172
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,484
Okay?

173
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,921
Barry!

174
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:13,825
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

175
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,193
Freeze! Police!

176
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,628
Or do you want to find out
the hard way

177
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,198
you're not faster
than a bullet?

178
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,637
Who is that guy,
and what is he so proud of?

179
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,972
So he caught a mugger?

180
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:28,840
He's a transfer
from keystone.

181
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,176
Started a few weeks ago.
Eddie Thawne.

182
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:35,314
Oh, that's
detective pretty boy.

183
00:08:35,316 --> 00:08:37,649
That's what my dad calls him.

184
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:41,320
Says he actually keeps score
when it comes to arrests.

185
00:08:41,322 --> 00:08:43,188
He is pretty though.

186
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:51,363
This is the last farm
on Barry's list.

187
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:52,664
Look, I know the kid's smart,

188
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,099
But you said it yourself.

189
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:57,002
Sometimes he's chasing
flying pigs.

190
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,171
Well, let's check
it out anyway.

191
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,084
I'm Linda Park, and we're live
outside S.T.A.R. Labs.

192
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:13,418
Despite
the inclement weather,

193
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,886
which is only going
to get worse,

194
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,855
the torrential downpour
has in no way affected

195
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,156
the particle accelerator,

196
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,858
which is up and
running smoothly

197
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,361
according to S.T.A.R. Labs
CEO Harrison Wells.

198
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:26,198
The weather has also...

199
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,595
- Whoa.
- Mardon.

200
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:59,097
Ah!

201
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,672
I've got a plane to catch!

202
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,080
What the hell?

203
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:16,448
Ah!

204
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:23,989
Chyre, hang in there.

205
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:34,866
Wait, we're now being told
to evacuate the facility.

206
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,535
The storm may have
caused a malfunction

207
00:10:36,537 --> 00:10:38,336
to the primary
cooling system.

208
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,871
Officials are now trying
to shut down

209
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,673
the particle accelerator,
but so far,

210
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:44,443
have been unable to regain
control of the system...

211
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:36,828
What the hell happened
to him?

212
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,829
He was hit by lightning.

213
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:40,065
How is he still alive?

214
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,666
Go.

215
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,568
No heartbeat. CBC, chem 24,
type and cross four.

216
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,003
- Bag him.
- He's coding.

217
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,005
- You can't be in here.
- I'm family.

218
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,573
- Charge the paddles to 200.
- Barry!

219
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,775
Clear.

220
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,093
What are you doing?

221
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,294
He likes this song.

222
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,029
How could you possibly
know that?

223
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,731
I checked his Facebook page.

224
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,233
I mean, he can
hear everything, right?

225
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,434
Auditory functions
are the last

226
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,637
sensory faculties to degenerate.

227
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,773
♪ Can't read my
no he can't read my poker... ♪

228
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:23,775
Oh, my God!

229
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,644
- Where am I?
- He's up.

230
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:28,213
Dr. Wells, get down
to the cortex, like, right now.

231
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:31,416
Pulse 120, pupils equally
reactive to light.

232
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,619
- Look at me, look at me.
- Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, relax.

233
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:35,921
Everything's okay, man.

234
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,522
You're at S.T.A.R. Labs.

235
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,291
S.T.A.R. Labs?
Who are you?

236
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:42,460
I'm Cisco Ramon.
She's Caitlin... Dr. Snow.

237
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:43,962
I need you to urinate
in this.

238
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,564
Not this second.

239
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:47,532
What is... what is happening?
What is going on?

240
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:50,402
You were struck
by lightning, dude.

241
00:12:50,404 --> 00:12:53,572
What?

242
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:55,640
Lightning gave me abs?

243
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,042
Your muscles
should be atrophied,

244
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:58,610
But instead they're
in a chronic

245
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,645
and unexplained state
of cellular regeneration.

246
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,348
Come here.
Have a seat.

247
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,716
You were in a coma.

248
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,518
For how long?

249
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,820
Nine months.

250
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:12,123
Welcome back, Mr. Allen.

251
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,660
We have a lot to discuss.

252
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:17,462
It's hard to believe I'm here.

253
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,831
I have always wanted
to meet you face to face.

254
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,433
Yeah?

255
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:23,001
Well, you certainly went to
great lengths to do it.

256
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,604
S.T.A.R. Labs has not
been operational

257
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:27,172
since FEMA categorized us

258
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:30,809
as a class four
hazardous location.

259
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,611
17 people died that night.

260
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:34,145
Many more were injured.

261
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,715
Myself amongst them.

262
00:13:36,717 --> 00:13:38,850
Jeez.

263
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,620
What happened?

264
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:44,255
Nine months ago,
the particle accelerator

265
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,291
went online
exactly as planned.

266
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:49,527
For 45 minutes,
I had achieved my life's dream.

267
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:53,098
And then... then there was
an anomaly.

268
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,533
The electron volts
became unmeasurable,

269
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,135
The ring under us popped.

270
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:59,371
Energy from that detonation
was thrown into the sky.

271
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:01,773
And that, in turn,
seeded a storm cloud...

272
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:04,009
...that created
a lightning bolt

273
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,077
that struck me.

274
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,180
That's right.

275
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:13,318
I was recovering myself...

276
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,488
When I heard about you.

277
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,557
The hospital was undergoing
unexplainable power outages

278
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,826
every time you were going
into cardiac arrest,

279
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:24,029
which was actually
a misdiagnosis.

280
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,365
Because you see,
you weren't flatlining, Barry.

281
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,701
Your heartbeat
was moving too fast

282
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,070
for the EKG to register it.

283
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:35,674
Now, I'm not the most popular
person in town these days,

284
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:38,243
but Detective West
and his daughter

285
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:39,611
gave me permission
to bring you here,

286
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,946
where we were able
to stabilize you.

287
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,281
- Iris?
- Iris, yes.

288
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:45,250
She came to see you
quite often.

289
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:46,584
She talks a lot.

290
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:48,053
Also, she's hot.

291
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,854
- I need to go.
- No, you can't.

292
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,656
No, no.
No, Caitlin's right.

293
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:53,091
No, now that you're awake,
we need to do more tests.

294
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:55,093
You're still going
through changes.

295
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56,494
There's so much
that we don't know.

296
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,830
I'm fine.
Really, I feel normal.

297
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:00,765
Thank you for saving my life.

298
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,967
Really?

299
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,736
Can I keep the sweatshirt?

300
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:07,005
- Yeah, keep the sweatshirt.
- Okay.

301
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,915
Sure.

302
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:21,820
- Fill 'er up?
- Thanks.

303
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,596
Oh, my God.

304
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,135
You're awake.

305
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,636
Why didn't
S.T.A.R. Labs call us?

306
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:40,105
I just woke up.

307
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,773
Should you even
be on your feet?

308
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:44,309
Iris, I-I'm okay.

309
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,413
I watched you die, Barry.

310
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,749
You kept dying.
Your heart kept stopping.

311
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:55,920
It's still beating.

312
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:59,257
- Feels really fast.
- Oops.

313
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,531
Are you okay, Tracy?

314
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:10,335
Yeah, I got it.

315
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:13,638
My dad is gonna be
so happy to see you.

316
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,074
Let me get my stuff, okay?
Be right back.

317
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,451
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

318
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:30,321
How can I help you today?

319
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,690
"This is a robbery."

320
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:33,792
Is this supposed
to be a joke?

321
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:36,294
You tell me.

322
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:51,342
Oh, you scared the hell
out of us, kid.

323
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,745
Yeah, that was quite the nap
you took there, baby face,

324
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:56,147
and you still look 12.

325
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,816
You look okay.

326
00:16:57,818 --> 00:16:59,384
Are you really?

327
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,286
- Yeah.
- Detective West,

328
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:04,589
We've got a 5.15 in progress
at gold city bank, two dead.

329
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,257
Storm's really picking up
on the south side.

330
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,625
I'd grab your rain gear.

331
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,260
I'm sorry, Barry.
I got to run.

332
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,229
- Do you need my help?
- No, you take it easy.

333
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,231
There'll be plenty for you to do
once you settle in.

334
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:16,100
Let's go, partner.

335
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:19,304
Hey, Allen.
Glad to see you.

336
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:21,639
- Thanks, Eddie.
- Hey, Iris.

337
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,141
Detective, you should go.

338
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:26,077
My dad doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

339
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,313
Glad you're back.

340
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,787
The night of the explosion,

341
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,689
Clyde Mardon shot
and killed Chyre.

342
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:39,424
Mardon and his brother
died trying to escape.

343
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:40,758
Their plane crashed.

344
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,560
Iris, got a minute?

345
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,295
Hey, Barry.
Good to see you.

346
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,570
Screw you!

347
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,272
You okay?

348
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,074
I-I'm fine.

349
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,475
I-I just need some air.

350
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,544
But I'll call you tonight,
all right?

351
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,288
What's happening to me?

352
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,931
Oh, oh!

353
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:47,992
Awesome.

354
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,567
You don't really believe he
can run that fast, do you?

355
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:57,869
Well, I believe anything
is possible,

356
00:18:57,871 --> 00:18:59,037
And in a few minutes,

357
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,106
Maybe you will too.

358
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,375
How does it fit?

359
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,615
It's a little snug.

360
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,050
At least you will
be moving so fast,

361
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:15,119
no one will see you.

362
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:17,588
See, you thought the world
was slowing down.

363
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,856
It wasn't.

364
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,425
You were moving so fast

365
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:23,227
it only looked like everyone
else was standing still.

366
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:25,263
Dr. Wells will be monitoring
your energy output,

367
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:27,565
And Caitlin, your vitals.

368
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:28,900
What do you do?

369
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:32,203
I make the toys, my man.
Check it.

370
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,906
This is a two-way headset
with a camera I modified.

371
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:36,975
Typically designed to combat
battlefield impulse noise,

372
00:19:36,977 --> 00:19:39,777
Or in your case,
potential sonic booms,

373
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,914
Which would be awesome.

374
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:52,056
- What?
- Nothing.

375
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:55,460
I just noticed
you don't smile too much.

376
00:19:55,462 --> 00:19:58,963
My once promising career
in bioengineering is over,

377
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,398
My boss is in
a wheelchair for life,

378
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,133
The explosion that put you
in a coma

379
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:04,969
also killed my fiance.

380
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:09,640
So this blank expression kind of
feels like the way to go.

381
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:12,076
Mr. Allen, while I am
extremely eager

382
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:15,046
to determine your full
range of abilities,

383
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:18,082
I do caution restraint.

384
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,917
Yeah.

385
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,583
Woo-hoo!

386
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,285
He just passed
200 miles per hour.

387
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,223
It's not possible.

388
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,699
Mom!

389
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:11,102
- No, Barry!
- Mom!

390
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,538
No!
Don't let him touch you!

391
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,508
Aah!

392
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,123
What is all this?

393
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,425
Witnesses from the robbery
at gold city bank.

394
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:36,327
Perp made off with 200 grand,
more or less.

395
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:38,963
- Catch these guys.
- The windows blew in.

396
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,432
It was like a hurricane.

397
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,167
Everyone ran for cover.

398
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:44,836
We're going to have
a sketch artist work with you,

399
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:48,873
If you feel up to it.

400
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,374
Third robbery in a month

401
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:52,043
where a freak storm
precedes it.

402
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:53,978
Sounds like one of those
"wide world of weird" cases...

403
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,613
- ...Barry's obsessed with.
- He's not obsessed.

404
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:56,881
Guess you haven't read
his blog.

405
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:58,749
The security cameras
at the bank.

406
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,518
Apparently it all
shorted out.

407
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,887
We got a bunch
of witnesses here.

408
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,755
They all have cell phones.

409
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:07,191
The sky went black
and then, boom.

410
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:09,260
Outside was inside.

411
00:22:09,262 --> 00:22:10,895
Man, it was like
there was a thunderstorm

412
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:12,363
in the bank.

413
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:15,099
Vukuvich, suspect is driving
a black mustang.

414
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:18,169
Partial plate
six-kilo-charlie-three.

415
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:19,737
- Put out an APB.
- Copy that.

416
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,743
It looks like you had
a distal radius fracture.

417
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:28,179
Had?

418
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,214
It's healed...
In three hours.

419
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:32,884
How is that even possible?

420
00:22:32,886 --> 00:22:35,720
We don't know... yet.

421
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:38,156
You really need to learn
how to stop.

422
00:22:38,158 --> 00:22:39,557
What happened
out there today?

423
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:41,058
You were moving pretty well,

424
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,163
And then something
caused you to lose focus.

425
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:47,398
I started
remembering something.

426
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,406
When I was 11,
my mother was murdered.

427
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:02,413
It was late.

428
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:03,948
A sound woke me up.

429
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:08,786
I came downstairs and...

430
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:12,323
I saw what looked like
a ball of lightning.

431
00:23:12,325 --> 00:23:15,059
Inside the lightning,

432
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:18,429
There was a man.

433
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:21,999
He killed my mom.

434
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:24,168
They arrested my dad.

435
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:27,905
He's still sitting
in Iron Heights for her murder.

436
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,341
Everyone, the cops,
the shrinks,

437
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:33,010
They all told me
what I saw was impossible.

438
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,482
But what if
the man who killed my mom

439
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:40,218
was like me?

440
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,087
Well, I think
I can say unequivocally

441
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,723
you are one of a kind.

442
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,130
Can I help you, detective?

443
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:54,999
You can stop acting
like you can't stand me

444
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:56,467
when your dad's around.

445
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:58,236
Aww.

446
00:23:58,238 --> 00:24:02,073
And I like having a boyfriend
who isn't shot to death.

447
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:19,357
You can't tell my dad.

448
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,292
He doesn't know
about me and Eddie.

449
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:23,361
Doesn't seem like anyone's
in on the secret.

450
00:24:23,363 --> 00:24:25,529
I was gonna tell you.

451
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:26,864
When you were
in the hospital,

452
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:28,299
Eddie covered
my father's shifts

453
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,334
so that we could
both be with you.

454
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:31,902
I thanked him
with a cup of coffee,

455
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:35,973
and things just
kind of happened.

456
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:39,176
And it's good.

457
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:40,645
Dating your
partner's daughter...

458
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:43,047
Isn't that against
department regulations?

459
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,882
Why are you so upset?

460
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:47,084
I just don't like having
to lie to your dad, you know?

461
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,731
Barry?

462
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:27,258
Hey!
Mardon!

463
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,240
That poor man.

464
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:17,575
The way that fog came in,

465
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:19,343
I have never seen
anything like it.

466
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:21,445
Barry!
Iris.

467
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:23,681
I'm all right, dad.

468
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:24,949
What the hell
were you thinking

469
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:26,317
- ...having her out here?
- No, no, no...

470
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:27,952
And I told you,
when you see danger,

471
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:29,787
You run the other way.
You're not a cop.

472
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,322
- Because you wouldn't let me.
- You're damn right.

473
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:32,423
Joe, I need to talk to you.

474
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:37,395
- It can wait.
- No, now.

475
00:26:37,397 --> 00:26:39,397
I know who did this.

476
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:41,599
It's Clyde Mardon.

477
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,634
I know everybody thinks
he died in a plane crash

478
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:44,835
after the S.T.A.R. Labs
explosion,

479
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:47,471
But he is alive.

480
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:48,906
All right, something
happened to him that night.

481
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:54,345
I... I think he can control
the weather.

482
00:26:54,347 --> 00:26:56,414
The recent robberies,
they all happened during

483
00:26:56,416 --> 00:26:58,115
freak meteorological events.

484
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,317
And when
I just confronted Mardon,

485
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,955
The street was instantly
enveloped in fog.

486
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:07,858
Of course
you don't believe me.

487
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,361
- You never believe me.
- Okay.

488
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:11,629
You want to do this now?

489
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:13,230
Out here?
Fine.

490
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:15,533
Mardon is dead.

491
00:27:15,535 --> 00:27:17,701
There is no controlling
the weather, Barry.

492
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:19,303
Just like there was no
lightning storm

493
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:20,838
in your house that night.

494
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,873
It was your brain
helping a scared little boy

495
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,074
accept what he saw.

496
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,709
My dad did not
murder my mother.

497
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,478
Yes, he did! Your dad killed
your mother, Barry!

498
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,313
I am sorry, son!

499
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,848
But I knew it,
the jury knew it,

500
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,049
And now he's paying
for what he did.

501
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:33,818
- Dad, enough!
- Unh-uh, Iris.

502
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,219
I have done my best
to take care of you

503
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:36,687
since that night,
and I have never asked

504
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:38,389
for anything in return,
not even a thank you.

505
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:40,991
But what I do ask now
is that you

506
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:44,395
for once in your life
see things as they are.

507
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:55,873
You're not going
to believe this.

508
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,141
We got the eyewitness sketch

509
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:59,543
of the robber
from the bank job.

510
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:03,547
If I didn't know better,
I'd say that's Clyde Mardon.

511
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,349
But that's impossible.

512
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:08,185
He's dead, right?

513
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,720
I wasn't the only one
affected

514
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:14,758
by the particle accelerator
explosion, was I?

515
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,960
We don't know for sure.

516
00:28:15,962 --> 00:28:17,261
You said the city was safe,

517
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:19,530
That there was
no residual danger.

518
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:24,101
But that's not true, so what
really happened that night?

519
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:25,736
Well...

520
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:27,605
The accelerator went active.

521
00:28:27,607 --> 00:28:31,408
We all felt like heroes,
and then...

522
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,643
it all went wrong.

523
00:28:32,645 --> 00:28:34,545
The dimensional barrier
ruptured,

524
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:36,981
unleashing unknown energies
into our world.

525
00:28:36,983 --> 00:28:38,549
Antimatter, dark energy,
x-elements...

526
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:39,917
Those are all theoretical.

527
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,919
And how theoretical are you?

528
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,422
We mapped the dispersion

529
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:46,724
throughout and around
Central City.

530
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:47,925
Though we have
no way of knowing

531
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:50,528
exactly what or...
who was exposed,

532
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,563
We've been searching
for other

533
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:55,566
- meta-humans like yourself.
- "meta-humans"?

534
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:57,535
That's what
we're calling them.

535
00:28:57,537 --> 00:28:59,203
I saw one today.

536
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:01,472
He's a bank robber,
and he can control the weather.

537
00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:03,440
This just keeps
getting cooler.

538
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:05,276
This is not cool.

539
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:07,545
All right?
A man died.

540
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:10,614
Mardon must have gotten his
powers the same way I did.

541
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:12,016
From the storm cloud.

542
00:29:12,018 --> 00:29:14,084
He's still out there.

543
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,287
We have to stop him
before he hurts anyone else.

544
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:18,122
Barry!

545
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:19,356
That's a job for the police.

546
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:20,658
I work for the police.

547
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,993
As a forensic assistant.

548
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:24,495
You're responsible for this.

549
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:25,596
For him.

550
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:28,532
What's important is you!

551
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:31,201
Not me.
I lost everything.

552
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:32,803
I lost my company.

553
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:34,338
I lost my reputation.

554
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,340
I lost my freedom.

555
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:38,375
And then you broke your arm,

556
00:29:38,377 --> 00:29:40,544
And it healed in three hours.

557
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:43,147
Inside your body
could be a map

558
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:46,016
to a whole new world...
genetic therapies,

559
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:49,153
vaccines, medicines,
treasures buried deep

560
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:52,489
within your cells and we cannot
risk losing everything

561
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:56,360
because you want to
go out and play hero!

562
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:59,463
You're not a hero.

563
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,832
You are just a young man
who was struck by lightning.

564
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:23,153
I didn't do this.

565
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,855
I swear to God,
I didn't do this.

566
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:26,490
Dad, why are they taking you?

567
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:28,359
- Barry, don't go in the house.
- Where's mom?

568
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:29,360
What's gonna happen
to my son?

569
00:30:29,362 --> 00:30:30,794
- Dad!
- Barry!

570
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:33,664
- Dad!
- Stay out of the house!

571
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:38,035
Barry!

572
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:39,970
Joe, you know these people?

573
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:42,439
My daughter's best friends
with their kid.

574
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:45,142
- I'm sorry.
- Mm.

575
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:56,020
- Mom.
- Barry.

576
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:57,521
Mom!

577
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,736
So that's my story.

578
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:15,773
I've spent my whole life
searching for the impossible,

579
00:31:15,775 --> 00:31:19,710
Never imagining that I would

580
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:22,446
become the impossible.

581
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,853
So why come to me?

582
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:32,089
Something tells me you
didn't just run 600 miles

583
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:34,024
to say "hi" to a friend.

584
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:39,029
All my life,
I've wanted to just do more...

585
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:40,831
be more.

586
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:42,266
And now I am.

587
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:44,935
And the first chance
I get to help someone,

588
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:47,671
I screw up.

589
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:49,506
What if Wells is right?

590
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:51,275
What if I'm not a hero?

591
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:53,610
What if I'm just some guy
who was struck by lightning?

592
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,245
I don't think that bolt
of lightning

593
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,848
struck you, Barry.

594
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:02,119
I think it chose you.

595
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:05,289
I'm just not sure
I'm like you, Oliver.

596
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:08,425
I don't know if
I can be some... Vigilante.

597
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:12,463
You can be better.

598
00:32:12,465 --> 00:32:16,433
Because you can
inspire people

599
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:19,570
in a way that
I never could...

600
00:32:19,572 --> 00:32:21,972
Watching over your city
like a guardian angel...

601
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:25,743
Making a difference...

602
00:32:25,745 --> 00:32:28,746
Saving people...

603
00:32:28,748 --> 00:32:31,682
In a flash.

604
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,654
Take your own advice.

605
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:39,656
Wear a mask.

606
00:32:46,765 --> 00:32:47,765
Cool.

607
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,470
Cool.

608
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,011
I've been going
over unsolved cases

609
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:02,312
from the past nine months,

610
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,781
And there's been
a sharp increase

611
00:33:03,783 --> 00:33:06,183
in unexplained deaths
and missing people.

612
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:07,651
Your meta-humans
have been busy.

613
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,319
Now, I'm not blaming you.

614
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,622
I know you didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

615
00:33:11,624 --> 00:33:13,891
I know you all
lost something.

616
00:33:13,893 --> 00:33:15,359
But I need your help
to catch Mardon

617
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:17,361
and anyone else out
there like him.

618
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:18,796
But I can't do it
without you.

619
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,236
If we're gonna do this,

620
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:28,472
I have something
that might help.

621
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:31,308
Something I've been
playing with.

622
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,676
Designed to replace
the turnouts

623
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,812
firefighters
traditionally wear.

624
00:33:34,814 --> 00:33:36,580
I thought if S.T.A.R. Labs
could do something nice

625
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:38,015
for the community,
maybe people wouldn't

626
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,983
be so angry at
Dr. Wells anymore.

627
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:41,985
How is it going to help me?

628
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:43,554
It's made of
a reinforced tri-polymer.

629
00:33:43,556 --> 00:33:45,389
It's heat
and abrasive resistant,

630
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:46,857
so it should withstand
your moving

631
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,192
at high-velocity speeds.

632
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:49,526
And the aerodynamic design

633
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:50,894
should help you
maintain control.

634
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:52,362
Plus, it has
built-in sensors

635
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,831
so we can track your vitals

636
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:55,299
and stay in contact
with you from here.

637
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:56,667
Thanks.

638
00:33:56,669 --> 00:33:58,302
Now how do we find Mardon?

639
00:33:58,304 --> 00:34:00,237
I retasked
S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

640
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:01,939
to track meteorological
abnormalities

641
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:03,073
over Central City.

642
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:04,474
We just got a ping.

643
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:06,410
Atmospheric pressure
dropped 20 millibars

644
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:08,445
in a matter of seconds.

645
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:11,381
I've tracked it to a farm
just west of the city.

646
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,552
I'm not saying
Mardon is alive.

647
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,054
But if he was,
this is the last place

648
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,388
him and his brother hid out.

649
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,890
Let's go.

650
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:32,903
Mardon?

651
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:34,538
On your feet.

652
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,039
Hands on your head.

653
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,875
You got me.

654
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:44,248
The night of the storm,
after S.T.A.R. Labs blew,

655
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,049
after our plane went down,

656
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:47,885
and I woke up
on the ground alive,

657
00:34:47,887 --> 00:34:53,090
when I saw what I can do,
I understood.

658
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:54,258
I am God.

659
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,394
Shut the hell up.

660
00:34:57,396 --> 00:34:59,296
Turn around.

661
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,173
Do you think that your guns
can stop God?

662
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:13,777
Why in the hell would God
need to rob banks?

663
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,779
You're right.

664
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:18,649
I've been thinking too small.

665
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,453
Barry!
Barry!

666
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:58,088
This thing's getting closer.

667
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,490
Wind speeds are 200
miles-per-hour and increasing.

668
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,558
Barry, can you hear me?

669
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,427
Yeah.
Loud and clear.

670
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:07,831
If it keeps up, this could
become an f-5 tornado.

671
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:08,999
But it's headed towards
the city.

672
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:11,768
How do I stop it?
Guys?

673
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,540
What if I unravel it?

674
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:18,175
How the hell
are you going to do that?

675
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:20,077
I'll run around it
in the opposite direction,

676
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,845
Cut off its legs.

677
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,580
He'd have to clock
700 miles-per-hour to do that.

678
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:25,649
Your body may not
be able to handle those speeds.

679
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,184
You'll die.

680
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:30,020
I have to try.

681
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:42,866
The suit's holding up.

682
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,668
- But he's not.
- He can do it.

683
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,669
I know he can do it.

684
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:04,888
It's too strong!

685
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,758
It's time to think big.

686
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:15,665
You can do this, Barry.

687
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:16,800
You were right.

688
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:19,169
I am responsible
for all of this.

689
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:21,138
So many people have been hurt

690
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,739
because of me,
and when I looked at you,

691
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,776
All I saw was another potential
victim of my hubris.

692
00:37:25,778 --> 00:37:27,344
And yes,
I created this madness,

693
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:30,614
but you, Barry,
you can stop it.

694
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:32,983
You can do this.

695
00:37:32,985 --> 00:37:36,119
Now run, Barry, run!

696
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,834
Barry?

697
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:29,139
Hey.

698
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:36,046
I didn't think there was
anyone else like me.

699
00:38:36,048 --> 00:38:38,148
I'm not like you.

700
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,485
You're a murderer.

701
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,690
- Barry?
- It's over.

702
00:38:46,692 --> 00:38:49,192
I'm okay.

703
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:25,061
What you can do...

704
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:28,265
It was the lightning bolt?

705
00:39:28,267 --> 00:39:31,535
More or less.

706
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:34,604
I'm sorry, Barry.

707
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:37,841
I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

708
00:39:37,843 --> 00:39:42,412
And I called you crazy
for chasing the impossible.

709
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:43,713
But you really did
see something

710
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:44,881
that night your mom died.

711
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:49,519
And your dad is innocent.

712
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:54,891
I need you to promise me
something.

713
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,893
I don't want you telling Iris

714
00:39:56,895 --> 00:40:00,096
about anything you can do,
any of it.

715
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:01,932
I want her safe.

716
00:40:01,934 --> 00:40:05,001
Promise me.

717
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:07,404
Yeah.

718
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,558
Hey, slugger.

719
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,760
You've been calling me that
since I was 11.

720
00:40:32,998 --> 00:40:34,164
Funny thing is, I finally got

721
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:35,565
into a fight today.

722
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:37,167
You just got out of a coma.

723
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:41,671
I'm not sure you should
be picking fights.

724
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:43,940
Hey...

725
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:46,776
Did you win?

726
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,012
Yeah, I did.

727
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:59,589
You didn't kill mom.

728
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:03,426
You know I know that, right?

729
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:07,330
You believing me
is all I need.

730
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:14,137
You're not gonna be
in here much longer.

731
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,306
Whoever killed mom...

732
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:19,976
Whatever killed her...

733
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,245
I think I finally have
a way to find them.

734
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:23,580
To stop them.

735
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:27,250
Barry, we've talked
about this.

736
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:28,785
It's time to let it go.

737
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:33,323
You have got to stop
worrying about me,

738
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:34,791
And live your life.

739
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:41,798
For the first time,
I feel like I finally can.

740
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,136
The truth is,
ever since the night mom died,

741
00:41:46,138 --> 00:41:48,605
I've been stuck in one place,

742
00:41:48,607 --> 00:41:52,108
Missed out on
a lot of things.

743
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,810
But I'm different now.

744
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:56,112
I've made some new friends.

745
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:57,814
They're helping me
find my way...

746
00:41:57,816 --> 00:42:00,083
Why is it shaped
like a lightning bolt?

747
00:42:00,085 --> 00:42:02,152
So it's not boring.

748
00:42:02,154 --> 00:42:03,887
To finally move forward.

749
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:06,823
You remember when you
wanted me to change my name

750
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:11,561
so I wouldn't have to deal with
people knowing you're my dad?

751
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:14,898
I'm glad they know.

752
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:22,238
I'm so proud to be your son.

753
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:31,281
I love you, son.

754
00:42:31,283 --> 00:42:35,318
I love you too, dad.

755
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,534
My name is Barry Allen,

756
00:42:51,536 --> 00:42:54,571
And I am
the fastest man alive.

757
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,076
A friend recently gave me

758
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,778
the idea for a new name.

759
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,552
And something tells me,
it's gonna catch on.

760
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,263
Greg, move your head!
