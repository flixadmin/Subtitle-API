1
00:00:00,984 --> 00:00:02,171
<i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>

2
00:00:02,242 --> 00:00:05,091
I have walked this earth for centuries.

3
00:00:05,164 --> 00:00:06,418
Only you can kill me.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,520
And only with that dagger.

5
00:00:12,659 --> 00:00:14,103
- What did I say?
- Wait!

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,794
I can help you get Tabitha back.

7
00:00:15,854 --> 00:00:17,086
Professor Hugo Strange

8
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:18,555
is the one man who can cure you.

9
00:00:18,657 --> 00:00:19,856
Join me,

10
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:21,291
and we will find him.

11
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:23,226
Okay.

12
00:00:23,328 --> 00:00:24,460
But you better deliver.

13
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:27,263
- Why would I help you?
- You love me.

14
00:00:27,365 --> 00:00:30,466
You've loved me all along.

15
00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:33,800
What's your record for how many
banks you've robbed in one day?

16
00:00:33,878 --> 00:00:36,272
You're playing
a dangerous game, Lee.

17
00:00:36,374 --> 00:00:39,372
Ra's al Ghul chose you
to pass on his spirit.

18
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:41,544
We have much more to show you.

19
00:00:41,646 --> 00:00:42,946
All my life,

20
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:45,615
I have known that I was meant for more.

21
00:00:45,717 --> 00:00:46,883
This isn't you.

22
00:00:46,985 --> 00:00:49,554
I'm not gonna let
your jealousy distract me.

23
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:53,217
Ladies, escort Miss Galavan
to the street.

24
00:00:53,279 --> 00:00:55,029
We serve the one
and only true master,

25
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:56,092
Ra's al Ghul.

26
00:00:56,194 --> 00:00:58,394
- But he's dead.
- Death is only an illusion.

27
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,693
What the hell?!

28
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,791
- You didn't sense our approach?
- Uh, no, you're ninjas.

29
00:01:28,893 --> 00:01:30,226
The Demon's Head gives its bearer power

30
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:32,395
to see past, present, future as one.

31
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:34,330
You should have anticipated our attack.

32
00:01:34,432 --> 00:01:35,765
So this was a test?

33
00:01:36,668 --> 00:01:38,668
I'm the Demon's Head.

34
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,567
My hand is a freaking lightbulb.

35
00:01:40,637 --> 00:01:41,871
That is only its mark.

36
00:01:41,973 --> 00:01:44,373
You have yet to access its real powers.

37
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:46,809
You're questioning whether I'm worthy?

38
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:48,644
I am sick of this.

39
00:01:48,746 --> 00:01:50,546
The men from the League, Tabitha,

40
00:01:50,648 --> 00:01:52,748
- and now you?
- You misunderstand.

41
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,684
How do you think Ra's al Ghul became

42
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:57,720
the world's most fearsome
warrior and ruled empires?

43
00:01:57,822 --> 00:02:00,723
He saw the future.

44
00:02:01,442 --> 00:02:04,427
So attacking me was, what,
a way to jump-start it?

45
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:06,162
Like, "Hey, Demon's Head, snap to it"?

46
00:02:06,264 --> 00:02:08,397
The powers of the Demon's Head
are triggered

47
00:02:08,499 --> 00:02:10,199
by intense emotions.

48
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:11,834
All right.

49
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:14,170
So next time, don't go so easy on me.

50
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,940
And take that knife out of my face.

51
00:02:35,793 --> 00:02:39,481
You don't have a covert mode
on this thing?

52
00:02:56,347 --> 00:02:58,447
Show-off.

53
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:00,496
So, you gonna tell me
what Tabitha needs us for?

54
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:04,855
All I know is it's about
Barbara, and it's important.

55
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:16,532
So, what's the emergency?

56
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:17,533
Inside.

57
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:21,303
You coming?

58
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,830
Tabitha, what am I doing here?

59
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:52,134
- What the heck?
- Wait.

60
00:03:52,236 --> 00:03:53,602
What the hell? What is this?

61
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:55,020
I don't know. She didn't
tell me this part.

62
00:03:55,082 --> 00:03:56,639
Barbara needs our help.

63
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:58,107
She's gonna get herself killed.
She has this thing

64
00:03:58,209 --> 00:03:59,241
called the Demon's Head.

65
00:04:01,443 --> 00:04:03,112
This is about Ra's al Ghul?

66
00:04:03,214 --> 00:04:04,713
He's the one who gave it to her.
These guys are gonna

67
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:05,881
help us take it back.

68
00:04:05,983 --> 00:04:08,350
Okay, so why do you need Bruce?

69
00:04:15,913 --> 00:04:17,480
You're gonna bring him back.

70
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:20,135
You, you can't do this.

71
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:21,864
Ra's wanted to die.

72
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:23,399
He wanted me to kill him!

73
00:04:26,814 --> 00:04:28,564
And now we need him alive.

74
00:04:28,632 --> 00:04:30,606
No. No! No!

75
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,278
No!

76
00:04:36,948 --> 00:04:37,947
No!

77
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,919
Bone, flesh, breath,

78
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:45,321
come back to us, our leader.

79
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:47,640
Now we close the circle.

80
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:50,085
We give you the blood
of the one who slew you.

81
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:01,237
No.

82
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:04,386
You have no idea what you've done...

83
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:25,600

84
00:05:31,302 --> 00:05:33,224
Five banks in one night?

85
00:05:33,294 --> 00:05:34,326
You're joking.

86
00:05:34,388 --> 00:05:35,787
I wish. These guys were slick.

87
00:05:35,888 --> 00:05:37,606
Banks didn't even know they
were hit till they opened.

88
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,108
One of the banks,
the thieves came in on boats

89
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,209
through the sewer.

90
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:41,646
Tunneled up into the vaults.

91
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,427
All branches of Gotham Savings and Loan.

92
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:44,539
Why the same bank?

93
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:45,915
Maybe a leak in security?

94
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:47,283
Maybe a grudge.

95
00:05:47,385 --> 00:05:48,817
Five banks in one night's...

96
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,653
it's like someone was
trying to make a point.

97
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:52,321
Prove how smart he is.

98
00:05:52,423 --> 00:05:54,757
- Ed Nygma?
- If the bowler fits.

99
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:56,659
Should I put out a BOLO out on him?

100
00:05:56,761 --> 00:05:59,595
Sure. In the meantime, there's
someone else I can talk to.

101
00:05:59,697 --> 00:06:01,640
Say hey to Lee for me, won't you?

102
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:03,666
Tell her nice shooting with Sofia.

103
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:07,859
What, I can't make a joke?

104
00:06:07,952 --> 00:06:09,171
That's what that was?

105
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:12,515
Why don't you go put that BOLO out, huh?

106
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:26,253
Look at them.

107
00:06:26,828 --> 00:06:28,756
We did good.

108
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:30,471
Oh, yeah. My brilliance allowed us

109
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,426
to rob five banks in one night,

110
00:06:32,762 --> 00:06:34,495
and now these fine folks in the Narrows

111
00:06:34,571 --> 00:06:36,664
are gonna be drowning in booze
and smokes for years to come.

112
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:38,761
It's so inspiring.

113
00:06:38,854 --> 00:06:39,940
They're also gonna use the money

114
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:43,504
to buy food and clothing and medicine.

115
00:06:44,774 --> 00:06:46,407
What's wrong?

116
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:51,045
What am I to you?

117
00:06:53,502 --> 00:06:54,601
A friend.

118
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:55,745
A partner.

119
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,524
Are you always this amorous
with your friends?

120
00:06:58,621 --> 00:06:59,953
I mean, I know
that only happened once...

121
00:07:00,016 --> 00:07:01,690
- Ed.
- Don't call me Ed.

122
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:03,158
Hey.

123
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,793
I care about you.

124
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:06,795
I depend on you.

125
00:07:06,897 --> 00:07:09,632
You know what we've got planned.

126
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:13,001
Other things are just gonna
have to wait.

127
00:07:13,095 --> 00:07:15,137
You're not stringing me along,
are you, Lee?

128
00:07:15,408 --> 00:07:17,676
Don't you want to find out

129
00:07:18,242 --> 00:07:20,976
the answer to the riddle?

130
00:07:23,814 --> 00:07:26,043
Maybe I do.

131
00:07:26,484 --> 00:07:28,584
Are we good for tomorrow night?

132
00:07:28,686 --> 00:07:30,586
Yeah, we just have a few last details.

133
00:07:30,688 --> 00:07:34,501
And trust me, this is
going to be a work of art.

134
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:37,259
That sounds promising.

135
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:39,273
Oh, what the hell?

136
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:40,963
Count us in.

137
00:07:49,031 --> 00:07:50,527
You could have told me.

138
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:51,697
You wouldn't have brought him.

139
00:07:51,773 --> 00:07:52,941
Yeah, because he's my friend.

140
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:54,943
And what is Barbara? What am I?

141
00:07:55,046 --> 00:07:57,246
Pick a side and stick to it.

142
00:07:57,824 --> 00:07:59,323
Do you know

143
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:01,216
what you've done?

144
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:04,720
The years I spent planning my death.

145
00:08:04,822 --> 00:08:06,689
Now you've ruined it.

146
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:08,257
Master.

147
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:10,693
The woman you gave the Demon's Head to.

148
00:08:10,795 --> 00:08:14,930
- She started a war.
- I started that war.

149
00:08:15,032 --> 00:08:16,932
The League of Shadows was rotten,

150
00:08:17,034 --> 00:08:20,469
and only through violence
could it be reborn.

151
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:28,610
Master, our lives
are yours to take.

152
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:31,980
But this woman does not serve
the League.

153
00:08:32,536 --> 00:08:35,703
Her goals are limited. Selfish.

154
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,167
That's Barbara, all right.

155
00:08:37,238 --> 00:08:39,488
Whatever faith
you had in her was misplaced.

156
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,724
If she keeps the Demon's Head,
the League shall die.

157
00:08:41,826 --> 00:08:45,594
Wait, what do you mean, if
she keeps the Demon's Head?

158
00:08:46,203 --> 00:08:48,633
I thought you were supposed
to get it the second you...

159
00:08:48,712 --> 00:08:49,932
came back.

160
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:51,133
No.

161
00:08:51,235 --> 00:08:53,802
Barbara must give it to me.

162
00:08:55,873 --> 00:08:57,639
She'll never do that.

163
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:02,821
Then, I'll kill her and rip it
from her corpse.

164
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,030
You owe us.

165
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,517
I-I'm sorry.

166
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,759
We owe you how?

167
00:09:14,835 --> 00:09:17,635
Because we made you.

168
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:19,320
Both of you.

169
00:09:19,377 --> 00:09:22,682
Without me, you would still
be trapped inside Ed.

170
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:24,705
And you would still be

171
00:09:24,741 --> 00:09:26,707
stitching up busted lips ringside.

172
00:09:26,743 --> 00:09:30,311
I need money to buy back Sofia's capos.

173
00:09:30,346 --> 00:09:33,714
Butch is saving for
future medical expenses.

174
00:09:34,751 --> 00:09:37,452
What'd you make last night?
Three, four million?

175
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,113
Say we go halvsies.

176
00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:43,168
I've heard your offer.

177
00:09:43,426 --> 00:09:45,406
And here's my counter:

178
00:09:45,441 --> 00:09:46,407
bite me.

179
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:47,841
I don't like people

180
00:09:47,877 --> 00:09:50,244
coming into my club,
telling me what to do.

181
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,429
And I don't like threats,
implicit or otherwise.

182
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:57,251
And I really don't like people
telling me they "made" me.

183
00:09:57,286 --> 00:09:58,952
Well said, Lee.

184
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:04,758
Oh, God, are you kidding me?

185
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:06,693
- What?
- Okay, we're done.

186
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:08,429
I-I thought you got past all that

187
00:10:08,464 --> 00:10:09,763
when you became the Riddler.

188
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,931
Past what?

189
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,567
Ed's pathetic adoration of her.

190
00:10:14,804 --> 00:10:18,087
But, no, clearly
he passed it along to you.

191
00:10:18,174 --> 00:10:19,840
Like a virus.

192
00:10:19,923 --> 00:10:22,242
She knows it, and she's using you.

193
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:24,445
Shame on you.

194
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,213
Stringing along this troubled man.

195
00:10:26,248 --> 00:10:27,381
Get out.

196
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,599
- I don't think so.
- W...

197
00:10:29,752 --> 00:10:32,772
We did not come here for violence.

198
00:10:32,955 --> 00:10:35,556
We came here hoping our friends
would honor their debts.

199
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:37,724
Let us hope they come to their senses.

200
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:42,396
Little advice:

201
00:10:43,048 --> 00:10:47,240
be sure to skim some off the top
when she tosses you aside.

202
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:09,423
Kind of defeats the purpose
if I can hear you.

203
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,625
Hello, Barbara.

204
00:11:14,697 --> 00:11:16,460
Ra's...

205
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,465
Don't be afraid.

206
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:22,603
What happened? How are you even...?

207
00:11:22,638 --> 00:11:24,705
It's a long story.

208
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,842
But tell me,
what have you done with my gift?

209
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:32,662
Well, you might've left a how-to.

210
00:11:32,748 --> 00:11:34,114
Plus a heads up

211
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:36,016
to your League of Shadows cronies.

212
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:37,484
Turns out the old boys club

213
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,953
don't appreciate a woman
calling the shots.

214
00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:42,571
But you have plans

215
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:45,099
on rebuilding the League of Shadows?

216
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:49,329
You've read the histories
that I left for you?

217
00:11:49,365 --> 00:11:52,540
I've read them, but I need
to do my own thing.

218
00:11:52,835 --> 00:11:55,774
Your own thing?

219
00:11:57,048 --> 00:12:00,061
With the power you gave me,
I can rule Gotham

220
00:12:00,116 --> 00:12:02,436
like no one ever has before.

221
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:05,616
The people will worship me like a queen.

222
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:08,058
How disappointing.

223
00:12:09,386 --> 00:12:11,152
You're right.

224
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,820
- They should worship me like a god.
- Enough.

225
00:12:13,862 --> 00:12:16,490
Give me your hand
so that I can take it back.

226
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,395
No. It is mine. You promised me.

227
00:12:22,098 --> 00:12:25,629
I was mistaken in you, Barbara.

228
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:29,346
Mistaken? Tell that to her.

229
00:12:30,404 --> 00:12:34,030
You think that is you?

230
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:42,493
She was just a whore.

231
00:12:44,235 --> 00:12:48,118
I killed her out of pity.

232
00:12:48,432 --> 00:12:50,719
You're lying.

233
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,243
The Demon's Head is my destiny.

234
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:57,678
Then why have you not
unlocked its secrets?

235
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,235
You sad,

236
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,967
deluded woman.

237
00:13:03,472 --> 00:13:06,707
You thought you were
a reincarnated queen,

238
00:13:07,936 --> 00:13:09,543
but in truth,

239
00:13:09,578 --> 00:13:14,214
you're just an unstable nightclub owner,

240
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:16,283
whose greatest accomplishment

241
00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:19,242
was the murder of her own parents.

242
00:13:19,723 --> 00:13:21,956
You are nothing.

243
00:13:22,861 --> 00:13:25,525
Now, give me your hand,

244
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:30,354
or I will kill you and take
the Demon's Head by force.

245
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:34,444
Try it, zombie boy.

246
00:13:57,326 --> 00:14:00,093
Get her out of here. Go!

247
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:10,209
I'm fine.

248
00:14:17,046 --> 00:14:18,311
Get in!

249
00:14:32,857 --> 00:14:34,669
All right, you know the rules.

250
00:14:34,756 --> 00:14:36,615
Hands only, no drinking water.

251
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:38,868
I want a good, clean eat. Ready?

252
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,193
Ready?

253
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,475
- Come on, eat it, eat it!
- Go, go, come on!

254
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:49,934
I'm looking for Lee Thompkins.

255
00:14:50,247 --> 00:14:51,909
The Doc.

256
00:15:00,506 --> 00:15:01,738
Lee?

257
00:15:05,463 --> 00:15:06,963
The winner!

258
00:15:07,065 --> 00:15:10,233
Jim. You don't look like a guy
who got shot four times.

259
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,435
Because you were able to keep me alive.

260
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,070
Thanks.

261
00:15:14,187 --> 00:15:15,764
I just just shot
Sofia Falcone in the head.

262
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:17,350
I was in a good mood.

263
00:15:19,343 --> 00:15:21,744
I'm looking for Ed Nygma.

264
00:15:22,034 --> 00:15:24,060
Five banks were robbed last night.

265
00:15:24,114 --> 00:15:26,497
Has all the hallmarks
of a Nygma special.

266
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:28,551
Haven't seen Ed in weeks.

267
00:15:30,402 --> 00:15:32,769
I know you feel loyalty towards him,

268
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:34,739
but you of all people
should know he's sick.

269
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:38,843
- He's a psychopath.
- We all have our flaws.

270
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:40,578
Lee.

271
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:43,748
I can understand why you're here.

272
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,617
But there are other ways
of finding absolution.

273
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:49,315
You can't take ownership
of everyone's problems.

274
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,788
This is the Narrows.

275
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,050
Nobody owns anything down here
but the slumlords.

276
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:55,941
Why don't you try going
after the real criminals?

277
00:15:56,043 --> 00:15:58,229
The people making money
off the backs of the poor.

278
00:15:59,221 --> 00:16:01,755
You mean like Gotham Savings and Loan?

279
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:05,598
None of the guards were killed.

280
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:07,708
The more I think about it,
doesn't exactly feel

281
00:16:07,794 --> 00:16:09,207
like Ed Nygma.

282
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:10,708
Or not just him.

283
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,543
If we're done here...

284
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:17,748
Whatever's happened,

285
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,383
you can always call me.

286
00:16:19,486 --> 00:16:21,571
I can help.

287
00:16:23,351 --> 00:16:25,389
You really don't get it, do you, Jim?

288
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,393
It was good to see you.

289
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:41,639
Ra's just tried to kill me
because of you.

290
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:43,307
You could've just given
him the Demon's Paw.

291
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:47,144
Head! It's the Demon's Head!
And it is mine!

292
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:48,846
You betrayed me.

293
00:16:48,948 --> 00:16:51,446
I was trying to save you from yourself.

294
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:52,416
Also, the other day,

295
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,685
you actually told your thugs to kill me.

296
00:16:54,787 --> 00:16:56,320
It was a spanking.

297
00:16:56,422 --> 00:16:57,688
If I wanted you dead,
I would've done it...

298
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,947
Oh, shut up, both of you!

299
00:17:00,017 --> 00:17:02,960
We're wasting time. Ra's could
be on his way right now.

300
00:17:03,062 --> 00:17:04,362
Which wouldn't be a problem
if Barbara would just

301
00:17:04,464 --> 00:17:05,830
give him what he wants.
Never gonna happen.

302
00:17:05,932 --> 00:17:07,243
Okay, so what are we gonna do, Barbara?

303
00:17:07,322 --> 00:17:09,500
We're just gonna walk around
with targets on our backs?

304
00:17:09,602 --> 00:17:12,481
No. We're gonna kill the son of a bitch.

305
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:14,071
The kid did it before, right?

306
00:17:14,173 --> 00:17:16,107
Yeah, but that was different.
We had, like, a special knife.

307
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:18,366
Yeah, that one you got from auction?
Where is it?

308
00:17:18,452 --> 00:17:19,944
We gave it back to
the Nanda Parbat embassy.

309
00:17:20,046 --> 00:17:22,146
Great. So we'll just do
a little smash and grab,

310
00:17:22,248 --> 00:17:23,548
and then I'll filet the zombie.

311
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,083
I have to be the one holding the knife.

312
00:17:27,153 --> 00:17:28,853
It's part of the ritual.

313
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:31,155
Like the blood.

314
00:17:32,124 --> 00:17:34,425
I have to kill him again.

315
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:37,451
Even if that's the case, Master Bruce,

316
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:38,654
I can't allow you to do it, not again.

317
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:41,232
We might not get another chance, Alfred.

318
00:17:41,334 --> 00:17:43,000
This is the only way.

319
00:17:43,102 --> 00:17:45,469
Says you, the mystical knife expert.

320
00:17:45,572 --> 00:17:47,511
I've got the Demon's Head.

321
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:49,941
I bet if I'm holding it in my hand...

322
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,495
What if killing Ra's unlocks my powers?

323
00:17:54,044 --> 00:17:56,178
Yeah, and what if you fail,
and Ra's gets the knife back?

324
00:17:56,249 --> 00:17:57,391
We'll worry about who kills him later.

325
00:17:57,462 --> 00:17:58,849
Right now, we have to get
the knife before Ra's does.

326
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,051
Embassies are heavily guarded,

327
00:18:00,153 --> 00:18:01,352
and we can't wait till night.

328
00:18:01,454 --> 00:18:03,321
We're gonna need guns,

329
00:18:03,423 --> 00:18:04,722
smoke grenades to cause a diversion.

330
00:18:04,824 --> 00:18:07,445
If I may, there may be another option.

331
00:18:08,351 --> 00:18:10,884
But you got to guarantee you're
not gonna stab us in the back.

332
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:12,663
Again.

333
00:18:16,436 --> 00:18:17,889
So, in short,

334
00:18:17,998 --> 00:18:19,203
we'd like to thank you very much...

335
00:18:19,313 --> 00:18:20,561
both of us would like to thank you

336
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:23,826
for taking such good...
such good care of her,

337
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:26,791
but now we'd like to take
the knife home, please.

338
00:18:28,394 --> 00:18:30,356
Wh... It was never yours

339
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,450
to begin with, Mr. Pennyworth.

340
00:18:32,552 --> 00:18:35,019
It belongs to my people.

341
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:38,015
When Mr. Bruce Wayne
purchased it at auction,

342
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,414
he was rescuing
a looted historical treasure.

343
00:18:42,578 --> 00:18:45,029
That's why you returned it to us.

344
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:47,832
Yeah, but it was a loan,
wasn't it, mate?

345
00:18:48,847 --> 00:18:51,363
It was never meant as a keepsie.

346
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:55,512
This knife is worth millions,
and you just gave it away?

347
00:18:55,613 --> 00:18:58,442
- You idiot!
- Easy, muffin.

348
00:19:01,214 --> 00:19:02,380
Look, you look like you got

349
00:19:02,482 --> 00:19:04,468
a stable head on your shoulders.

350
00:19:04,754 --> 00:19:07,088
Why don't I make a little donation,

351
00:19:07,487 --> 00:19:09,387
and you give us the knife.

352
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:11,722
And we walk away.

353
00:19:11,824 --> 00:19:13,958
Does Bruce Wayne even know about this?

354
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:19,330
Whatever your agenda is,

355
00:19:19,432 --> 00:19:23,334
I believe that you and
your chippie should leave.

356
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,359
A chippie?

357
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:27,900
Did you just call my missus a chippie?

358
00:19:28,174 --> 00:19:30,441
What is that, like...

359
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:33,411
What... A chippie?
Is that a new term or something?

360
00:19:33,513 --> 00:19:35,246
Something...

361
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:36,947
- What...
- What?

362
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,450
- What's happening?
- I can't breathe.

363
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:41,121
Oh, my God! I think
he's having a heart attack.

364
00:19:41,191 --> 00:19:42,832
- I can't breathe! I can't breathe!
- He's having a heart attack!

365
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:43,729
Ow!

366
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:45,921
- Look what you did.
- Tell security it's a false alarm.

367
00:19:45,992 --> 00:19:47,202
- I can't breathe.
- False alarm.

368
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:48,601
I can't breathe! I can't
breathe! I can't breathe!

369
00:19:48,671 --> 00:19:50,361
Give me your jacket.
Put your jacket under his head.

370
00:19:50,463 --> 00:19:51,362
Put your jacket.

371
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:55,232
It really hurts.
It really, it really hurts.

372
00:19:56,903 --> 00:19:58,202
You're okay.

373
00:19:58,304 --> 00:19:59,645
Continue breathing.

374
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:01,436
- Deep breaths.
- All right, you're doing just fine.

375
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,428
Ow, it really hurts.

376
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:06,177
Stay with me here.

377
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,245
Oh, I feel much better now.

378
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:15,953
Sorry about the fuss. Fellas.

379
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:17,455
Chippie.

380
00:20:23,267 --> 00:20:24,305
Ah...

381
00:20:31,316 --> 00:20:33,229
<i>And she's using you.</i>

382
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:34,780
<i>Shame on you.</i>

383
00:20:34,855 --> 00:20:36,588
<i>Stringing along this troubled man.</i>

384
00:20:36,623 --> 00:20:38,781
This troubled man.

385
00:20:38,847 --> 00:20:41,281
Ooh, can't argue with that.

386
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:42,660
Oh, no.

387
00:20:42,696 --> 00:20:44,451
Sorry, just because you're in charge

388
00:20:44,498 --> 00:20:45,459
doesn't mean I disappear.

389
00:20:45,522 --> 00:20:49,491
That's because you're too stupid
to know when you've lost.

390
00:20:49,526 --> 00:20:51,559
Have I?

391
00:20:51,595 --> 00:20:53,728
"Lee, what am I to you?"

392
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:57,165
Does that sound like you to you?
Because to me,

393
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,409
that sounds like me.

394
00:20:59,496 --> 00:21:00,871
I'm not proud of that phrasing.

395
00:21:00,906 --> 00:21:02,873
I'm inside you, buddy,

396
00:21:02,908 --> 00:21:04,912
like a virus,

397
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:07,745
- infecting your thoughts.
- Oh, please.

398
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,865
You couldn't even begin
to comprehend my thoughts,

399
00:21:09,904 --> 00:21:11,515
much less influence them.

400
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,418
What about your feelings?
How else would you explain those

401
00:21:14,453 --> 00:21:17,488
desperate attempts to gain her approval?

402
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:20,972
No, no. If anything,
she's the one who...

403
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:23,894
You gave money away
to the poor.

404
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:26,230
That was part of a larger plan.

405
00:21:26,265 --> 00:21:29,581
Yeah, her plan. What did you
ever care about the Narrows?

406
00:21:29,644 --> 00:21:30,834
I don't.

407
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:34,505
Every person here could drown
in a stew of their own filth

408
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,430
and I wouldn't lose a wink of sleep.

409
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:38,133
Oh, I know...

410
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:42,279
because all you care about is her.

411
00:21:42,314 --> 00:21:43,881
Just like I did.

412
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,305
So keep that up, buddy,

413
00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:47,284
'cause soon there will no telling

414
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:49,586
where you end and I begin.

415
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:57,361
That's not gonna happen.

416
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:04,968
Well done.

417
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:06,837
Now, knife, please.

418
00:22:07,907 --> 00:22:10,686
Selina, it has to be me.

419
00:22:11,277 --> 00:22:12,576
Selina.

420
00:22:13,313 --> 00:22:14,946
Give me the knife.

421
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:16,947
And you better scram
while you still can.

422
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:18,382
I'm taking the knife.

423
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:21,168
Oh, you do not want
to make me angry, kid.

424
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,254
Sorry, muffin.

425
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:23,473
I'm gonna need you to step back.

426
00:22:23,537 --> 00:22:24,996
Don't you even go there, love.

427
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:26,590
Selina, don't give her the knife.

428
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:27,925
Screw this.

429
00:22:31,772 --> 00:22:34,306
Your arrogance is gonna get
someone killed, you know.

430
00:22:34,368 --> 00:22:35,332
Or just you.

431
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:36,567
- What?
- Stop.

432
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,240
Thank you.

433
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:46,076
Now. Get in.

434
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,246
Selina, let's go.

435
00:23:01,127 --> 00:23:03,760
Nice doing business with you boys.

436
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,027
You were right.

437
00:23:16,408 --> 00:23:18,590
She's using me.

438
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:20,379
Finally.

439
00:23:20,846 --> 00:23:23,714
So much for you being smart now.

440
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:25,682
The most brilliant minds are often blind

441
00:23:25,718 --> 00:23:27,117
to the most obvious truths.

442
00:23:27,153 --> 00:23:28,752
Fine.

443
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:30,721
And you came to me...

444
00:23:30,756 --> 00:23:32,890
Because that lovestruck moron, Ed,

445
00:23:32,925 --> 00:23:34,992
is floating down a river of dopamine

446
00:23:35,027 --> 00:23:37,538
deep within the primitive
reward circuit of my brain

447
00:23:37,608 --> 00:23:39,796
and I need you to help me drown him

448
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:41,298
for good.

449
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,901
Did you bring the half-share
of profits we asked for?

450
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:45,135
That money's gone.

451
00:23:45,171 --> 00:23:47,471
Distributed among the riffraff
of the Narrows,

452
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:49,537
but...

453
00:23:50,276 --> 00:23:53,844
those five banks were merely
the first stage

454
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:56,740
of a very sophisticated plan.

455
00:23:57,108 --> 00:24:00,217
And the coup de grâce is tonight.

456
00:24:00,436 --> 00:24:02,886
I knew you were scheming something.

457
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:06,924
That's why we were
gonna rob you afterward.

458
00:24:07,985 --> 00:24:10,394
But I prefer this way.

459
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:13,197
There better be enough
in there to get me fixed.

460
00:24:13,232 --> 00:24:14,831
Don't forget our deal.

461
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:16,066
I won't.

462
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:19,036
Thank you so much.
And how big is the score?

463
00:24:19,071 --> 00:24:20,671
About a hundred million...

464
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,874
...apiece.

465
00:24:28,714 --> 00:24:31,515
And you help me deal with Lee Thompkins.

466
00:24:39,325 --> 00:24:41,558
Thank you for coming back.

467
00:24:41,594 --> 00:24:44,361
We serve the Demon's Head, Barbara.

468
00:24:44,396 --> 00:24:45,963
So what's the play?

469
00:24:45,998 --> 00:24:49,967
Simple. I do the flashlight-hand
thingy, summon Ra's,

470
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:51,835
a little stabby-stab with the knife,

471
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,370
send him back to hell.

472
00:24:53,405 --> 00:24:55,272
Think I can remember that.

473
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:57,608
You can't be serious.

474
00:24:57,643 --> 00:24:59,376
That's your plan?

475
00:24:59,411 --> 00:25:00,911
How do you expect to get the drop

476
00:25:00,946 --> 00:25:04,041
on someone who's studied
kung fu for 2,000 years

477
00:25:04,096 --> 00:25:05,439
and is a zombie?

478
00:25:05,486 --> 00:25:07,432
Not feeling a whole lot
of faith here, kitty cat.

479
00:25:07,486 --> 00:25:08,652
Maybe I'd have a little more

480
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:10,057
if you knew how to use your Demon Head

481
00:25:10,096 --> 00:25:12,623
for something other than a flashlight.

482
00:25:12,658 --> 00:25:14,157
You're gonna get us killed.

483
00:25:14,193 --> 00:25:15,726
You got any useful suggestions?

484
00:25:15,761 --> 00:25:16,727
Maybe call backup.

485
00:25:16,762 --> 00:25:18,095
I did.

486
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,129
Here they are.

487
00:25:19,164 --> 00:25:20,564
What if Bruce is right?

488
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:21,748
Let him use the knife.

489
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,734
At least we know that it worked before.

490
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:25,435
You just took the knife from him.

491
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:26,737
Because you told me to pick a side.

492
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:28,171
I thought you had some other plan

493
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:30,956
other than "Let's stab
the immortal, undead guy

494
00:25:30,995 --> 00:25:32,095
and hope for the best."

495
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,948
Listen, Selina, we're strongest
when we're together.

496
00:25:35,114 --> 00:25:36,747
Now are you in or are you out?

497
00:25:36,782 --> 00:25:38,749
If it's suicide by Ra's, I'm out.

498
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:40,679
Fine, then go.

499
00:25:49,528 --> 00:25:50,961
What if she's right?

500
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:54,031
I can't control the Demon's Head.

501
00:25:54,949 --> 00:25:56,633
Maybe it's like Ra's said.

502
00:25:56,699 --> 00:26:00,771
Maybe... I am just a nightclub owner.

503
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:04,031
I should've never trusted those men.

504
00:26:04,934 --> 00:26:07,429
I didn't want you to
have the Demon's Head.

505
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:09,446
Not even sure I want it now.

506
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:14,818
Three years we've been
together, on and off.

507
00:26:15,727 --> 00:26:18,622
And I've never seen you doubt yourself.

508
00:26:18,969 --> 00:26:21,792
So however you want
to play this, I'm in.

509
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:24,283
But if you're saying you're not worthy,

510
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,697
that's where I jump ship.

511
00:26:29,435 --> 00:26:30,901
Let's do this.

512
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:50,602
I suppose on the bright side,

513
00:26:50,661 --> 00:26:53,395
you won't have to kill him... again.

514
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:55,463
Except I'm the only one who can.

515
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:58,330
So said Ra's.

516
00:26:58,478 --> 00:27:00,779
I mean, no disrespect to your
magical daggers and all of that,

517
00:27:00,814 --> 00:27:02,104
but I'd love to see what would happen

518
00:27:02,145 --> 00:27:04,679
if I pulled his head
off his bloody shoulders.

519
00:27:04,918 --> 00:27:07,519
I can't believe Selina
gave Barbara the knife.

520
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:11,222
Yeah, well...

521
00:27:11,258 --> 00:27:12,624
at least we know where she stands.

522
00:27:12,815 --> 00:27:15,268
That's what you think.

523
00:27:16,787 --> 00:27:20,155
Oh, you've got bloody
cheek turning up here.

524
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:25,570
I gave Barbara the knife
because if there was a chance

525
00:27:25,605 --> 00:27:27,342
she could use it, I wanted her to.

526
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,592
That way Bruce didn't have to kill him.

527
00:27:29,654 --> 00:27:31,482
I would've done what I had to do.

528
00:27:31,545 --> 00:27:33,176
And you would've gone straight
back to being the douche bag

529
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:34,498
you've been the last few months.

530
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:36,611
So, no. Thank you.

531
00:27:36,681 --> 00:27:37,781
She's got a point there, Master Bruce.

532
00:27:37,816 --> 00:27:40,118
Thanks for the explanation.
You can leave now.

533
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:42,619
- Bruce.
- You sided with them.

534
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,930
Why does it
have to be about sides?

535
00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:48,158
There is somebody,

536
00:27:48,193 --> 00:27:50,160
some thing out there
that needs to be stopped,

537
00:27:50,187 --> 00:27:52,721
so why can't we focus on that?

538
00:27:52,764 --> 00:27:54,798
Another good point.

539
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:58,735
Barbara and Tabitha are gonna
get themselves killed.

540
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:01,404
And I don't want that to happen.

541
00:28:07,612 --> 00:28:10,322
There were easier banks to hit.

542
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,549
Why yours?

543
00:28:12,584 --> 00:28:15,985
I keep telling you, I have no idea.

544
00:28:16,645 --> 00:28:18,822
I'm the victim.
You're treating me like a criminal.

545
00:28:18,857 --> 00:28:20,690
Yeah, I wonder where we get that from.

546
00:28:21,626 --> 00:28:24,012
- Excuse me?
- We did some digging.

547
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:28,106
Your bank has been investigated
for redlining, usury,

548
00:28:28,168 --> 00:28:31,020
- illegal foreclosures.
- And cleared on all counts.

549
00:28:31,106 --> 00:28:32,569
You have good lawyers.

550
00:28:33,205 --> 00:28:35,527
So we deserve to be robbed?

551
00:28:36,741 --> 00:28:38,113
- I'm done here.
- Ma'am,

552
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:40,844
can you just give us a second, please?

553
00:28:47,085 --> 00:28:48,619
What the hell are you doing?!

554
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,687
She's a crook, a bigger crook
than whoever ripped her off.

555
00:28:50,722 --> 00:28:52,255
You mean like Lee?

556
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,790
Look, brother, I know
what this is about.

557
00:28:53,825 --> 00:28:54,924
You went down to the Narrows

558
00:28:54,975 --> 00:28:56,593
and came back all fired up, okay?

559
00:28:56,628 --> 00:28:59,195
But alienating her is not gonna help us.

560
00:28:59,231 --> 00:29:01,297
If Lee is involved with Nygma,

561
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:04,030
we got to stop it before it goes bad.

562
00:29:08,573 --> 00:29:10,874
Which of your branches
are the most vulnerable?

563
00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:12,976
As of this afternoon, none of them.

564
00:29:13,011 --> 00:29:15,612
We have a security protocol.

565
00:29:15,647 --> 00:29:17,480
After the Arkham breakout
and the robberies...

566
00:29:17,515 --> 00:29:19,148
You moved your assets
to a secure location.

567
00:29:19,184 --> 00:29:20,583
Yes, of course.

568
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:23,119
All 45 branches this morning.

569
00:29:24,089 --> 00:29:26,890
It's totally safe.

570
00:29:26,925 --> 00:29:29,325
- Fortified and heavily guarded.
- Where is it?

571
00:29:37,535 --> 00:29:40,670
- Pistol would've been more fun.
- You indulge me.

572
00:29:40,705 --> 00:29:42,672
Breaking open the vault
is the last detail.

573
00:29:42,707 --> 00:29:45,141
Big detail. How did you solve it?

574
00:29:45,176 --> 00:29:46,910
A little help from some friends.

575
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,147
I'm the revealer of masks.

576
00:29:51,602 --> 00:29:53,349
When I appear,

577
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:56,185
friend becomes foe.

578
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,373
And the one that you love
becomes the one that you hate.

579
00:30:00,452 --> 00:30:02,084
What am I?

580
00:30:02,171 --> 00:30:03,971
Betrayal.

581
00:30:04,162 --> 00:30:06,577
Hello, Lee.

582
00:30:07,204 --> 00:30:09,735
Yeah, it's not a dart gun.

583
00:30:09,811 --> 00:30:11,446
Let's go.

584
00:30:37,495 --> 00:30:39,862
♪ ♪

585
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:47,971
Nice entrance.

586
00:30:48,006 --> 00:30:49,806
I do hope you've reconsidered

587
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:52,141
and are planning to give me what I want.

588
00:30:52,177 --> 00:30:55,712
I've thought about it a lot

589
00:30:56,302 --> 00:30:58,287
and about us.

590
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:01,119
We had something, didn't we?

591
00:31:01,186 --> 00:31:03,720
Back when you were less dug-up-y.

592
00:31:03,755 --> 00:31:06,089
I do not have time for this.

593
00:31:06,124 --> 00:31:08,091
I will give you what you want, Ra's.

594
00:31:09,057 --> 00:31:12,036
But I want you to admit
we had a connection

595
00:31:12,297 --> 00:31:15,498
and that those things you said
to me were just mind games

596
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:17,033
to make me lose my nerve.

597
00:31:17,365 --> 00:31:20,837
You want me to tell you
that you're special?

598
00:31:21,404 --> 00:31:23,006
Would that be so hard?

599
00:31:23,426 --> 00:31:25,074
No.

600
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,442
And moreover, it's true.

601
00:31:29,551 --> 00:31:31,661
You are special.

602
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:35,351
I'm just sorry it had
to come to this, Barbara.

603
00:31:37,422 --> 00:31:38,888
Me, too.

604
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:42,594
But thank you for saying that.

605
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:49,673
Ouch.

606
00:31:52,437 --> 00:31:54,604
She must do this by herself.

607
00:32:11,089 --> 00:32:12,922
Barbara, fight.

608
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:23,833
This is Barbara's fight.

609
00:32:49,861 --> 00:32:52,116
This is Barbara's fight!

610
00:32:55,842 --> 00:32:58,835
Well, now... look at you.

611
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,670
Yeah, look at me.

612
00:33:00,705 --> 00:33:02,897
You want to give it another shot?

613
00:33:10,014 --> 00:33:12,239
She's mastered the Demon's Head.

614
00:33:12,271 --> 00:33:13,783
Wow.

615
00:33:13,818 --> 00:33:16,018
I can see why he likes this thing.

616
00:33:16,054 --> 00:33:18,387
That's enough.

617
00:33:18,423 --> 00:33:22,859
Give me what I want,
or your friend dies.

618
00:33:22,894 --> 00:33:24,894
I thought this was between us.

619
00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:27,630
Choose now.

620
00:33:32,403 --> 00:33:34,504
Tabby, I...

621
00:33:36,017 --> 00:33:38,007
I can't give this up.

622
00:33:49,649 --> 00:33:52,376
No!

623
00:33:56,842 --> 00:34:00,010
That's enough. Choose.

624
00:34:00,131 --> 00:34:01,931
Now.

625
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:08,398
You win.

626
00:34:10,832 --> 00:34:12,762
Just don't hurt her.

627
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,985
Barbara Kean,

628
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:24,547
you surprise me yet again.

629
00:34:25,016 --> 00:34:28,090
Maybe I wasn't mistaken
in you after all.

630
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,383
Give me the knife, Ra's.

631
00:35:13,504 --> 00:35:14,937
Let me kill you.

632
00:35:19,811 --> 00:35:22,144
Today is not the day that I die.

633
00:35:44,283 --> 00:35:46,817
This is the price for
taking advantage of me, Lee.

634
00:35:46,919 --> 00:35:48,824
You're wrong, Ed. I wasn't using you.

635
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,646
Again, don't call me Ed.

636
00:35:50,723 --> 00:35:52,689
And I'm not wrong about you.

637
00:35:52,791 --> 00:35:55,192
The truck is almost
full... we should go.

638
00:35:55,294 --> 00:35:57,194
Tell the ogre. Have him leave
the property deeds.

639
00:35:57,296 --> 00:35:58,995
They all belong to the Narrows.

640
00:35:59,098 --> 00:36:00,197
Worthless.

641
00:36:02,064 --> 00:36:05,198
And so ends the tale of
the Queen of the Narrows.

642
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,704
Mm. Good-bye, Lee.

643
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:15,011
- What are you doing?
- How did that go, again?

644
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,063
"I am the revealer of masks.

645
00:36:17,149 --> 00:36:20,450
"When I appear, friend becomes foe."

646
00:36:20,591 --> 00:36:23,750
- Betrayal.
- Exactly.

647
00:36:31,578 --> 00:36:32,869
What the hell you doing?!

648
00:36:32,938 --> 00:36:34,297
Just burning the Narrows property deeds.

649
00:36:34,376 --> 00:36:35,461
Not that.

650
00:36:35,555 --> 00:36:38,735
He's proving his love by betraying us.

651
00:36:38,837 --> 00:36:40,670
These bars can't hold me.
When I get out...

652
00:36:40,773 --> 00:36:42,305
We'll be gone.

653
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,408
I just wanted you to hear something.

654
00:36:46,011 --> 00:36:47,978
Oswald, we have been
through thick and thin.

655
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,424
And I hold no grudge on you.

656
00:36:52,572 --> 00:36:54,918
But you come against Lee,

657
00:36:55,035 --> 00:36:56,455
and you come against me.

658
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:00,490
I'm gonna dismember you, you twerp!

659
00:37:00,592 --> 00:37:01,958
Yeah, not even gonna try with you.

660
00:37:02,936 --> 00:37:04,436
Let's go, Lee.

661
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,029
It won't make any difference.

662
00:37:06,131 --> 00:37:08,432
She's still using you.

663
00:37:08,534 --> 00:37:12,369
You are not the Riddler! You are a fool!

664
00:37:12,471 --> 00:37:14,404
God!

665
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,743
Why do that?

666
00:37:19,845 --> 00:37:21,378
Why bring Penguin and Grundy

667
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,879
if you're just gonna lock them inside?

668
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:24,448
I needed Grundy to open the vault.

669
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,837
And Oswald was gonna rob us, anyway,

670
00:37:25,915 --> 00:37:27,584
so I just kept an eye on him.

671
00:37:27,686 --> 00:37:29,186
He'll get over it, or he won't.

672
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,855
So you don't think I'm using you?

673
00:37:31,957 --> 00:37:34,090
No, I know you are.

674
00:37:34,462 --> 00:37:36,884
Then why would you
betray your friends for me?

675
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,708
Is this... Are you Ed?

676
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,399
No, I'm me.

677
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:43,967
How can you be sure?

678
00:37:44,069 --> 00:37:46,436
Because Ed didn't understand you.

679
00:37:46,538 --> 00:37:50,254
He didn't see how deeply
you had changed. I do.

680
00:37:50,348 --> 00:37:52,476
I know that that virus

681
00:37:52,578 --> 00:37:55,301
woke up something deep inside you,

682
00:37:55,981 --> 00:37:58,882
and you let that something loose
when you shot Sofia.

683
00:37:59,669 --> 00:38:01,952
And you love it.

684
00:38:03,722 --> 00:38:05,155
And I love it, too.

685
00:38:05,257 --> 00:38:07,824
And I know that you don't
feel the same way about me.

686
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,313
But you will.

687
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:16,141
And when you do, I will be here.

688
00:38:18,704 --> 00:38:20,435
Ed Nygma...

689
00:38:20,706 --> 00:38:23,037
you are a riddle.

690
00:38:24,013 --> 00:38:25,935
That's the nicest thing
someone's said to me.

691
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,147
- That's Jim.
- This alarm just went off.

692
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,449
He was onto us.

693
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:35,664
- We can just go out the back.
- No, they'll see the truck.

694
00:38:35,742 --> 00:38:37,254
One of us needs to distract them.

695
00:38:39,224 --> 00:38:40,824
Done.

696
00:38:40,926 --> 00:38:43,159
No.

697
00:38:43,262 --> 00:38:45,028
I can handle Jim Gordon.

698
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:47,631
You take the money to the Narrows.

699
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:50,418
You trust me?

700
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:52,039
I do.

701
00:38:55,607 --> 00:38:56,940
Go.

702
00:39:06,781 --> 00:39:08,351
GCPD.

703
00:39:08,453 --> 00:39:09,953
Nygma, we know you're in there.

704
00:39:10,055 --> 00:39:11,521
Come out with your hands up.

705
00:39:18,897 --> 00:39:20,497
Sweet, merciful mother.

706
00:39:29,821 --> 00:39:31,808
You know your rights.

707
00:40:23,195 --> 00:40:25,829
You'd have done the same for me.

708
00:40:38,577 --> 00:40:40,410
Ladies.

709
00:40:40,512 --> 00:40:41,711
I hope this isn't one of those

710
00:40:41,813 --> 00:40:44,314
kill the old queen situations.

711
00:40:44,416 --> 00:40:45,882
We discussed things.

712
00:40:45,984 --> 00:40:49,219
Demon's Head or not, you fought.

713
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:52,290
Not for yourself,
but those alongside you.

714
00:40:53,395 --> 00:40:55,726
You are worthy, Barbara Kean.

715
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,766
We follow you

716
00:41:02,868 --> 00:41:04,534
to our deaths and beyond.

717
00:41:14,293 --> 00:41:16,079
We can find from Barbara
where the League hides:

718
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:18,181
temples, safe houses...
he'll be in one of them.

719
00:41:18,283 --> 00:41:19,616
Meanwhile, we'll try to fix the knife...

720
00:41:19,718 --> 00:41:21,251
Yeah, we'll just take it
to the magic knife shop,

721
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,852
no problem.

722
00:41:22,954 --> 00:41:25,088
- Selena, be serious.
- I am.

723
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:27,190
If Ra's wanted you dead, you would be.

724
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:29,492
He obviously likes you.

725
00:41:29,594 --> 00:41:31,661
- It's not about me.
- I know it's not about you.

726
00:41:34,032 --> 00:41:37,467
Gotham has managed
a long time without you.

727
00:41:37,569 --> 00:41:39,335
It can manage a little longer

728
00:41:39,438 --> 00:41:41,004
if you have one night off.

729
00:41:46,669 --> 00:41:48,402
You did good today.

730
00:41:51,957 --> 00:41:54,284
So did you.

731
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,386
Ahem. Poor timing.

732
00:41:56,488 --> 00:41:58,455
Apologies.

733
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,557
I only want to talk.

734
00:42:00,659 --> 00:42:02,559
Alone, please.

735
00:42:02,661 --> 00:42:04,427
I'm staying.

736
00:42:06,598 --> 00:42:08,364
Very well.

737
00:42:08,467 --> 00:42:10,533
She's right, you know, Bruce.

738
00:42:10,635 --> 00:42:11,968
I do like you.

739
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,204
Respect you. Respect you
for what you'll become.

740
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:20,149
You have no idea what I'll become.

741
00:42:20,245 --> 00:42:21,670
Of course I do.

742
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,417
At least, who you could become.

743
00:42:26,351 --> 00:42:28,129
Why are you here?

744
00:42:28,176 --> 00:42:29,686
I felt I owed you an explanation

745
00:42:29,788 --> 00:42:32,088
as to why I chose to live.

746
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,324
When I took back the Demon's Head,

747
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,025
I saw...

748
00:42:36,128 --> 00:42:38,761
a vision...

749
00:42:39,264 --> 00:42:42,766
of a cataclysmic event
soon to befall this city.

750
00:42:44,293 --> 00:42:45,894
What event?

751
00:42:45,972 --> 00:42:48,605
A cleansing fire

752
00:42:48,707 --> 00:42:52,609
that will destroy, purify,

753
00:42:52,711 --> 00:42:56,212
create... create you, Bruce.

754
00:42:56,314 --> 00:42:59,015
Because I will use it as a mighty forge,

755
00:42:59,117 --> 00:43:00,583
molding you into

756
00:43:00,685 --> 00:43:03,740
a dark knight of Gotham.

757
00:43:11,864 --> 00:43:14,512
If it doesn't kill you, that is.

758
00:43:15,066 --> 00:43:20,072
