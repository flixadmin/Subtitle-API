1
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:13,833
Where go you, my friend?

2
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,458
You're crawling in the wrong direction.

3
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,583
That wind you feel is coming from England.

4
00:01:28,583 --> 00:01:29,666
Scotland's that way.

5
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,500
My lords.

6
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,125
I'm most sorry for making you wait.

7
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:05,291
I know you've traveled far
and from great travail.

8
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:08,333
I pray you will know
that this time of civil unrest...

9
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:10,708
Consumes me...

10
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,750
day and night.

11
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,541
I understand...

12
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,125
battle with the rebel Scots
was hard fought.

13
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,166
It was, my liege.

14
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,000
We lost some 300 men.

15
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:45,625
- Amen.
- Amen.

16
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,083
Good Hotspur...

17
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,458
you led the charge.

18
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:57,208
Were any prisoners of note taken?

19
00:03:58,666 --> 00:03:59,500
Many.

20
00:03:59,791 --> 00:04:01,333
- Are they in train?
- No.

21
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,958
And why is that? Why have they not been
brought to me directly?

22
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,291
Why will you not pay
cousin Mortimer's ransom?

23
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,458
You'll need to speak up, my boy.

24
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:17,625
I'm an old man.

25
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,166
My ears...

26
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,041
are filled with hair.

27
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:23,625
Cousin Mortimer is held
by the rebels of Wales.

28
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,125
Why do you refuse to pay his ransom?

29
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,125
I refuse to pay Mortimer's ransom

30
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,833
because I refuse
to believe him a prisoner.

31
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,041
I rather believe Mortimer a traitor.

32
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,500
He has joined the Welsh rebels.

33
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,916
He has betrayed England
and is now an enemy of mine,

34
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,750
and, therefore, of yours.

35
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,833
You agree with my <i>précis, </i>young Hotspur?

36
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,083
- No.
- My son...

37
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,333
I believe yours to be the ramblings
of a crazy old demon.

38
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,916
Harry, please, stop this.

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,916
Oh, no, let him speak.

40
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,041
- I wish to hear him.
- My liege...

41
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:05,000
Yours are the ramblings of an old man
so saturated with malice and mistrust

42
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,750
that he no longer knows up from down,

43
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,500
can no longer see beyond the walls
of his own monstrous <i>schloss.</i>

44
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,041
My family have served you.

45
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,750
We aided you in your ascension,
and still we fight for you.

46
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,208
Cousin Mortimer has fought for you.

47
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,291
And yet, now, whilst you slobber
over that chicken's wing,

48
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,708
he shivers in a western prison

49
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,083
awaiting mutilation
at the hands of Welsh witches.

50
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,583
My liege...

51
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,333
you must excuse my son.

52
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,208
He needs rest.

53
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,291
We come only...

54
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,291
to advocate for your help
in securing Mortimer's release.

55
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,875
All that we've done for you
we have done for the good of England.

56
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:43,041
But our lands are now
more riven with war than ever before.

57
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,333
The Scots aren't finished.
The Welsh have only just begun.

58
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,458
And for what?

59
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,291
Why do you think this might be, old man?

60
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,916
Who do you imagine
might be to blame for this?

61
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,458
Chickens can't fly.

62
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:08,916
But I've seen one...

63
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:12,458
eke enough wing flap to clear a fence.

64
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,875
Then it's free.

65
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,666
But then so too are the foxes.

66
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,875
You are right, young Percy.
I owe you much.

67
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,083
I owe your family still more.

68
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,583
But if the Scottish traitors
you've taken prisoner

69
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,625
are not brought to me
as speedily as they might travel,

70
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,166
I will hang you by your fucking neck.

71
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,416
Has this been heard, young Percy?

72
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:04,791
Your Majesty, please forgive us.

73
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,416
What a venomous boy.

74
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,708
He'll betray me now. I'm sure of it.

75
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,625
If only he were my son.

76
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,666
Hal.

77
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,666
Mm.

78
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:35,250
Hal?

79
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,041
Hal.

80
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,958
What is it?

81
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:46,583
Falstaff has injured hisself.

82
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,833
Yeah. See?

83
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,666
- How did you get inside?
- The door was ajar.

84
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,625
It was not.

85
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,375
Yes, it was. It was ajar.

86
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,500
It was not ajar.

87
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,666
Well, how else might we gain entry?

88
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,166
Are you accusing me
of having cut myself a secret key?

89
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,083
Yes.

90
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,333
Falstaff has injured hisself, Hal.
Will you perform the small repairs?

91
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:05,541
No.

92
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:07,750
Oh, no.

93
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,750
Your Highness.

94
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:19,791
There's a fresh coin
in this for you, you know.

95
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,375
I don't want your coin.

96
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,625
I will require your undiminished loyalty
from here till Megiddo.

97
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,458
You have that already.

98
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,791
You're a soft negotiator.

99
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:33,666
Hey! You're wasting good wine.

100
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,457
- I'm keeping it clean.
- Give it.

101
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh. That looks very hot.

102
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:47,041
Do it.

103
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:49,708
Ow!

104
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,125
Prince Henry.

105
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:20,708
Who are you?

106
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,833
We come from the royal court.
We wish to speak with you privately.

107
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:24,750
For what?

108
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,791
Please, sire. Privately.

109
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,000
Oh, privately, in the middle of Eastcheap?

110
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:32,458
Should I make a quick up and down
and request a mass covering of ears?

111
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,416
Please, sire.

112
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,500
What is this?

113
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,625
Your father, His Majesty King...

114
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:48,541
Your father,
His Majesty King Henry, is ill.

115
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,708
He requests your presence.

116
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,250
Hmm. I suggest you return
to the palace directly

117
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,625
and tell him his request
was wholly ignored.

118
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:01,083
I've been instructed
to deliver the request with great urgency.

119
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:04,125
You might tell him the urgency
was also wholly ignored.

120
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:16,583
My lady.

121
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:18,458
My lady, it's time to leave.

122
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,916
Why?

123
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,375
The day has begun. See?

124
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,916
Out there.

125
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,291
It is well underway.

126
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,500
You might miss it.

127
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,458
Get up now. It's important that you leave.

128
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,833
Up. That's the spirit.

129
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,458
Right.

130
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,750
Now, lift your arms.

131
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,625
Very good.

132
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,583
You must get that door fixed.

133
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,041
What is it?

134
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,041
Visit with your father.

135
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,291
Go away.

136
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,291
If your father is indeed

137
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,750
gravely ill enough
to request your presence,

138
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:08,333
then you must visit with him.

139
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,541
It should be better to regret
having done so than it would to have not.

140
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,875
If your father is ill,

141
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,583
no matter your feelings for him,
you must visit with him.

142
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,875
But...

143
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,916
I say this not out of concern
for our king's well-being,

144
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,875
but more for fear of the drunken soak
to which you'll be likely to succumb

145
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,000
should you fail to heed his call
and he were to die

146
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,333
without you having squared your ledger.

147
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:41,666
I fear that would be soak enough
to put even me to shame.

148
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:45,916
Do it.

149
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,708
If nothing else I ever suggest.

150
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:10,000
While I see the strain
your treasury is under,

151
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:13,208
I cannot help but wonder
if the canker of Lollardy

152
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:17,125
be at the root of this suggestion
that the church be burdened with a tax

153
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,250
to relieve problems
that are not of the church's making.

154
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,500
Your Majesty.

155
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:24,416
Henry, Prince of Wales.

156
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,125
My son.

157
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:36,125
Come in.

158
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,958
I feel my life nearing its natural end,
and yet, still...

159
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,250
even I must appear
of ruder health than you.

160
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,708
The time has come for us to consider...

161
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,208
the issue of...

162
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,375
my succession.

163
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:31,500
You will not be king.

164
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,458
While you are my eldest son,

165
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:40,666
for reasons that are on display
for all here to see,

166
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,708
smell...

167
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,041
You will not inherit this crown.

168
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,375
Nor have I sought it.

169
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,416
That privilege and responsibility

170
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,166
will instead fall to your brother Thomas.

171
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:01,208
He is soft, but he is eager.

172
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:06,708
He will lead my army
against the newly treasonous Harry Percy.

173
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:13,666
I will assume that this news comes
as neither surprise nor disappointment.

174
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:18,083
But it is my duty as king,

175
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,708
and father...

176
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,791
to say it to you directly.

177
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,791
When do you fight?

178
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,916
I set off tomorrow.

179
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,208
We fight by week's end.

180
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,500
You need not fight.

181
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,250
These feuds need not be yours.

182
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,958
I have said...

183
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,708
what you were summonsed to hear.

184
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,458
Leave us now.

185
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,208
- Your Highness.
- Stop.

186
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,041
- Your Highness.
- Stop.

187
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,416
Move it!

188
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,625
Lord Dorset.

189
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,708
Are your men ready for the day?

190
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,791
They are, sire.

191
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,291
Very good.

192
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,625
Tell me of your preparations.

193
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:08,040
My lord.

194
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,165
Why are you here?

195
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,083
I will not allow this havoc to transpire.

196
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,833
I've come to see it stopped.

197
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,083
This is my battle.

198
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,708
If I have my way, there will be no battle.

199
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:34,375
You. Come here.

200
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,208
- My lord.
- You have no place here.

201
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,250
Go to the rebel camp,

202
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,666
deliver the following message
to Percy Hotspur.

203
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,416
Tell him that Prince Henry challenges him
to settle today's score man on man.

204
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,375
He and I.

205
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,541
We will fight in our armies' places.

206
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,500
Yes, my lord.

207
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:55,708
Who do you think you are?

208
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,375
I am nobody to you.

209
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:02,875
I will fight him.

210
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,125
And I will defeat him.

211
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,500
That you surely would, my son.

212
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,916
But it cannot be.

213
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,625
The prince speaks not for his father.

214
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,791
You are eager to fight, my son.

215
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,291
And you will.

216
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:24,416
And we shall fight alongside you.

217
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,416
We will burn them.

218
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,750
We will burn Henry's reign to the ground.

219
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:37,000
- You have no place here.
- You do not know war, Thomas.

220
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,583
- I do know war.
- You do not.

221
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,500
You've been recruited
to our father's madness,

222
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,750
to wars that need not be fought.

223
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,083
These men are not our enemies.

224
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,875
- Our father has made them thus.
- Why then are you here?

225
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,000
You so disapprove of our cause,

226
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:57,333
and yet, still, you find it necessary
to upstage me.

227
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,708
I do this not to steal your thunder,
brother.

228
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,333
I do it to save your life.

229
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,666
Pardon me, my lords.

230
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,333
Our herald is returned
from the rebel camp.

231
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,625
They have refused Prince Henry's offer.

232
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:11,833
They want battle.

233
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:26,916
Whoa, whoa.

234
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,458
Ha!

235
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:40,833
Ha! Go!

236
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,083
Where is Henry?

237
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:08,500
I come to fight him in our armies' stead.

238
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:09,875
No.

239
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,708
His offer was refused.

240
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,875
The offer has been reconsidered.

241
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:15,916
I said...

242
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:17,708
no!

243
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,166
Why is the little dog barking?

244
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,625
Hm?

245
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,208
Where be the big dog?

246
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,083
It will be done.

247
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,625
And here I am with the whoring fool.

248
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,458
This fight need not be had, Percy.

249
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,166
My father will soon be dead.
Your grievances will die with him.

250
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,625
Don't be afraid of our small contest,
young Hal.

251
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,291
I promise to finish it quickly.

252
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,500
Come on.

253
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,208
Your father...

254
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,500
is plague to England.

255
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,916
Come for me, big dog!

256
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:42,375
No!

257
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,208
Oh! Oh!

258
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,125
Hmm.

259
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:56,250
Someday this will be your head,
dropped at the feet of a man

260
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:58,375
who might otherwise
have been your brother.

261
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,958
Come with me now, Thomas, please.

262
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:03,625
Walk away from this field.

263
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,708
After you have stolen its prized scalp?

264
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:14,291
This is what will be spoken of tomorrow.

265
00:25:21,166 --> 00:25:22,750
This field was mine.

266
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,250
It was to mark my dominion.

267
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:30,458
Instead now...

268
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:32,666
it marks only this head.

269
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,750
This fucking head!

270
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,250
Move.

271
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:54,000
John.

272
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:55,791
John.

273
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:57,083
Go away.

274
00:25:57,166 --> 00:26:00,791
You might want to see
to your otherwise well-appointed friend.

275
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:04,958
He seems to have taken a pitiful turn.

276
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:11,583
Beale.

277
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:14,041
Hal's up-chucked again.

278
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:24,875
Hello, friend.

279
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:30,416
Many times have I seen men in your state.

280
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:34,291
I've been in it many times over myself.

281
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:39,666
For all our rejoice of...

282
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,208
courage and valor,

283
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:47,000
nothing stains the soul more indelibly
than killing.

284
00:26:51,416 --> 00:26:53,666
Never have I felt so vile...

285
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:57,125
than standing victorious on a battlefield.

286
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,750
The thrill of victory fades quickly.

287
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:09,125
What lingers long after...

288
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:11,375
is always ugly.

289
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:17,291
Never again, I say.

290
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:20,000
Stop talking, old man, please.

291
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:23,375
Please stop talking.

292
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,750
I will never stop talking, Hal.

293
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:31,750
Never.

294
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:37,708
Never ever.

295
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,000
Out.

296
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,625
My lord.

297
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,583
What business?

298
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:37,791
It is a matter of great urgency.

299
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:41,083
Mm. You should hurry along then.

300
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:44,750
Please, my lord.

301
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:46,375
It is your father.

302
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:49,416
He's dying.

303
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:54,375
Hmm, that hook has lost its worm.

304
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:02,458
Wait outside.

305
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:25,500
No doubt...

306
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:28,208
your father has brought...

307
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:31,708
much trouble to this kingdom,

308
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:39,208
and I fear the chaos
that might erupt in his absence.

309
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,875
England needs a king,

310
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:45,750
and I suspect those sentiments of yours

311
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:48,291
that had you resile from him

312
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:52,666
are precisely those
the governance of this land needs.

313
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:58,000
You must be king.

314
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:01,708
Why do you say this to me?

315
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:03,708
Speak to Thomas.

316
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:06,583
Is he not to be your new king?

317
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:11,041
I'm afraid that is not possible.

318
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:16,750
Your brother was killed in Wales.

319
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:20,416
After your defeat of Percy Hotspur,

320
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,125
young Thomas pressed on
to the western fields.

321
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:28,250
This is where he met his end.

322
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:36,375
It is said he gave
valiant account of himself.

323
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:10,125
Where is he?!

324
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:12,625
Where is the monster?!

325
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,208
Where is the monster?

326
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:26,791
Move. Leave him.

327
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,500
The King needs rest.

328
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:30,666
- Soon he will have it.
- He's dying.

329
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:32,833
Leave.

330
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:04,916
You feel this cold?

331
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:07,750
Wretch.

332
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:17,750
Hal.

333
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:19,875
Hal.

334
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:23,708
You must be king, Hal.

335
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:28,541
Please.

336
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:32,916
You must be king, Hal.

337
00:32:45,166 --> 00:32:46,708
I know not what I have done.

338
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:26,291
You know not what will become of you.

339
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,875
So, I offer you this...

340
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,250
The most blessed reprieve,

341
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,916
the most dreadful misery.

342
00:33:44,041 --> 00:33:46,583
You shall suffer the indignity
of serving me,

343
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:51,083
the wayward son you so revile.

344
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:59,541
But know now you will be watched over
by an altogether different king.

345
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:37,333
What is this?

346
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:38,708
Who are you?

347
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:40,583
I am I.

348
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:42,666
Who are you?

349
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,541
What is your purpose here?

350
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:48,500
I think you just woke me up from it,
didn't you?

351
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:50,666
Rise from that bed at once.

352
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,291
Who are you?

353
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,958
Where is Hal?

354
00:34:57,416 --> 00:35:00,666
These lodgings and their contents
are the property of the King of England.

355
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:04,791
You are trespassing
and I order you to vacate at once.

356
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:08,458
What King of England?

357
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,625
Amen.

358
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:12,166
All hail King Henry.

359
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:14,250
King Henry!

360
00:36:14,333 --> 00:36:15,791
King Henry!

361
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:17,583
King Henry!

362
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:21,750
King Wenceslaus of Bohemia

363
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:24,291
presents this gift
to King Henry of England.

364
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,083
To long and good health.

365
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:30,458
Beautiful.

366
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:36,458
I'm sure you all know...

367
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:39,916
my young sister Philippa
has joined us here today.

368
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,083
Queen of Denmark.

369
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,166
I'm thankful she and her husband,

370
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,375
the good King Eric,
have traveled all this way.

371
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:50,250
I wish for you take this vase, my dear.

372
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:55,666
Let its beauty stand for your beauty,
which stands in turn for England's beauty.

373
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:57,500
I thank you, my lord.

374
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:02,958
His Serenity,
the doge of the Republic of Venice,

375
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,291
present this gift in your honor, my liege.

376
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:09,875
- It says it is a bird from Constantinople.
- A bird?

377
00:37:09,958 --> 00:37:11,458
A dead one, I should suppose.

378
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:21,500
If I may, my liege.

379
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:32,500
Unnatural mechanics
from the edge of Christendom.

380
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:48,041
Hmm.

381
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:54,541
A wonder.

382
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,375
This belongs to my cousin, Cambridge.

383
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:03,125
Of all at this table,

384
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:06,000
none have I known longer than I have you.

385
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:09,916
Indeed I have known you longer
than I have my own young sister.

386
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:14,375
We were raised together.
You're like an older brother to me.

387
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:17,958
So, I think it only fitting
that you should have this magical bird.

388
00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:21,083
Let's hope its magic
isn't black and unholy.

389
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,250
From the Dauphin,

390
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:28,916
son of His Majesty, Charles,
King of France.

391
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:46,708
A ball.

392
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:54,041
There is no accompanying message
from the Dauphin?

393
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:55,666
No, my liege.

394
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:09,708
I shall keep this gift.

395
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,458
This one is sent only for me.

396
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:20,083
For the boy I once was.

397
00:39:29,791 --> 00:39:33,583
The ball is an insult to you
and to your kingdom.

398
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,541
You must respond.

399
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:41,666
Remember where, as prince, I whiled
and how I spent my days?

400
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,458
You spent them
in considered privation.

401
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:47,208
Drinking, clowning.

402
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,541
So, is there not some truth in this jest?

403
00:39:51,041 --> 00:39:54,208
If the Dauphin wants from me a paroxysm,
why give it him?

404
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:58,791
It would not be a show of foul temper

405
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:02,166
for you to respond forcefully
to an insult such as that.

406
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,083
It would be a show of strength.

407
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:07,041
I appreciate your umbrage, William,

408
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:08,708
but my strength does not lie

409
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:11,375
in me flapping up and down
at the slightest barb like...

410
00:40:12,041 --> 00:40:14,250
- some unholy mechanical bird.
- Mm.

411
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:19,208
Make sense of this.
This is what is pressing.

412
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:24,125
Civil strife has consumed us.

413
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:28,375
The war drains the purse like little else.

414
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,583
This strife must end.

415
00:40:31,708 --> 00:40:32,916
And it will end...

416
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,208
by conciliation.

417
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:36,541
We shall pardon our adversaries.

418
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:40,583
And we shall pay Mortimer's ransom
and have him returned from Wales.

419
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:44,291
I will write these pardons
in mine own hand.

420
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,500
I want it known these sentiments
are so personal to me.

421
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:53,458
We shall let these men know
they were my father's enemies, not mine.

422
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:56,416
Certainly, my liege.

423
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,208
How does this strategy greet you?

424
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:06,208
Great reforms are best enacted
with regime change.

425
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:09,916
If this is how you wish to proceed,

426
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,333
then, yes, my liege,

427
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:13,666
now is the time to do it.

428
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,458
Did you reconcile with our father
before his death?

429
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:40,375
There was no reconciliation to be had.

430
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:43,708
He did untold harm to this kingdom.

431
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:46,458
His death will bring calm with it.

432
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:48,958
I ask not after the kingdom.

433
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:51,000
What of you?

434
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:54,416
I want an end to this unrest.

435
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:02,208
Look around that table last night.

436
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:06,500
Look at the faces
of the men seated at it.

437
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,833
I can feel this calm of which you speak.

438
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:13,416
I do believe they wish you well.

439
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:20,125
But I also see that they have
their own kingdoms behind their eyes.

440
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:23,750
Do you understand what I say?

441
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:29,750
I've been away too many years
and I'm now to return to Denmark.

442
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:34,875
But I have, in my time in that court,
been privy to its commissions.

443
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:39,458
I have seen there, again and again,
that no one ever speaks true,

444
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:40,500
wholly true.

445
00:42:44,916 --> 00:42:46,958
Choose your steps wisely,

446
00:42:47,791 --> 00:42:48,750
dear brother.

447
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:53,916
I speak
to Charles of France's claim

448
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,333
to be the legitimate sovereign ruler
of said lands.

449
00:42:57,416 --> 00:43:02,083
It is said that the Salic law
would have no succession

450
00:43:02,541 --> 00:43:04,875
if the French crown fall to a woman.

451
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:08,583
Meaning, no rule
left in the lineage of the female

452
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:11,166
shall, by rights, pass to her issue.

453
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:15,583
Now, the law Salic,
which is of Frankish land

454
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:18,083
and tethered to said lands is not...

455
00:43:18,375 --> 00:43:23,208
not therefore legally bound
or adherent at all, in fact,

456
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:25,833
to the lands of France,
but to those of Francia,

457
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:28,875
which, as you know,
lies between the rivers of Elbe and Saale.

458
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:32,958
I claim here, with proof,
that hence it follows that the law Salic,

459
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:37,416
which has seen French sovereignty stolen
as such from a true lineage...

460
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,416
Thrice, as I can illuminate,
the French have cited the law Salic

461
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,250
- as reason to bar a female succession...
- With reverence.

462
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:46,958
Yes, my liege?

463
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,541
I'm finding this story
impossible to follow.

464
00:43:51,416 --> 00:43:55,500
My liege, I question
the so-called French king's claim

465
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,666
to the throne upon which he sits.

466
00:43:58,125 --> 00:43:59,125
Is that so?

467
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:03,000
What confuses me now
is why you are telling me this story.

468
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:08,125
My liege, I simply aim to bolster
your claim to France

469
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:10,708
should the need to meet her with force
soon arise.

470
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:13,208
And you believe that need
will indeed soon arise?

471
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:14,625
I...

472
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:15,916
My liege...

473
00:44:16,833 --> 00:44:18,541
by way of preparedness,

474
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:21,083
- I believe it always wise...
- Preparedness?

475
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:23,583
If we are to war with France,
it will not come as a consequence

476
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:25,500
of an old and impenetrable madrigal.

477
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:31,333
France was your father's
long-held ambition.

478
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:34,666
Had he not been bogged in civil feud,

479
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:37,750
he would most surely
have taken the fight to her.

480
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:39,458
And then...

481
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:41,250
on to Jerusalem.

482
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:42,208
Jerusalem?

483
00:44:44,458 --> 00:44:46,708
We're all the way to the Holy Land,
are we?

484
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:50,666
And presumably to sack
the rest of Christendom along the way.

485
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:54,750
I am not my father, archbishop.

486
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:58,666
I would have thought this
to be clear by now.

487
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:13,083
We must forgive our archbishop.

488
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,375
He is a far...

489
00:45:15,666 --> 00:45:18,458
far from gifted orator.

490
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:21,666
Which is strange,
given I would have thought gifted oratory

491
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,583
to be a requirement of the position.

492
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:28,291
Why is the archbishop speaking to me
of war with France?

493
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:33,291
What we are witnessing is a stirring,

494
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:35,875
of which we must be wary.

495
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,208
I applaud...

496
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:40,458
your restraint.

497
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:46,125
After so many years of strife,

498
00:45:47,791 --> 00:45:52,125
you are proving to be more
than your father's son.

499
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,375
You wish to be a king for the people.

500
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:58,875
Now, we must ensure to that end, however,

501
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:02,250
you do not remain oblivious to the mood

502
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:04,000
of the people.

503
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:06,458
And what mood is this?

504
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,333
That France is taunting us.

505
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:14,208
Do you share this mood?

506
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:15,708
Well...

507
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:18,375
this mood is a fantasy.

508
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:22,541
But that does not mean
it is not felt true.

509
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,958
- Where are you going?
- Disgusting.

510
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,750
- No, we can't be going to Hooper's.
- Yes, we can.

511
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:33,750
- No, she won't have you.
- Yes, she will.

512
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:34,666
- Nope!
- Yes.

513
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:35,625
- No.
- Yes!

514
00:46:35,708 --> 00:46:37,666
You're not welcome here.

515
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,458
Unless you've come to pay me
what you owe me.

516
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:40,750
I have paid you.

517
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:43,208
You've paid me a snatch of what you owe.

518
00:46:43,791 --> 00:46:46,250
And I presume, too,
from the proceeds of thieving.

519
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:47,166
Lies.

520
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:50,000
By all account, you be not specially good
at thieving neither.

521
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:50,916
Lies.

522
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,750
How dare you address me so?

523
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:56,750
Why would you be so churlish

524
00:46:56,833 --> 00:47:01,333
with the very man most likely to lift you
from your stinking rat hole?

525
00:47:01,958 --> 00:47:03,166
Oh, maybe you've forgot.

526
00:47:03,791 --> 00:47:07,083
My associations now stretch
to the highest reaches of the realm.

527
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:10,666
Your insolence might as well be directed
to the king himself.

528
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:12,541
Ponder that now.

529
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,708
Are you speaking of Hal?

530
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:15,625
Ah.

531
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:16,583
Where is he?

532
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,708
Where is Hal?

533
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:19,625
Oh.

534
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:20,666
Where's our king?

535
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:23,833
He be gone weeks and weeks now.
Where is he?

536
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:26,375
I would say...

537
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,083
you be the one that's been forgot.

538
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:32,500
- Oh.
- I would say that your dalliance

539
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,750
with the upper reaches of the realm

540
00:47:34,833 --> 00:47:36,458
was short-lived

541
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:40,041
in and around his stinking sick bucket.

542
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:45,958
Seems you were little more
than passing keeper of a prince's puke.

543
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:47,625
Shut up.

544
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:50,875
Ponder that now.

545
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:52,833
Nell, Sir John is down on his luck.

546
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:53,875
I am not.

547
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:57,291
You find someone to pay your way here.

548
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,750
I'll not be paying it for you.

549
00:48:22,083 --> 00:48:23,000
Head.

550
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:24,750
Head.

551
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:47,500
Who are you?

552
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:51,958
He seeks asylum in return for his tale.

553
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,416
I do not doubt this can be arranged.

554
00:48:56,375 --> 00:48:59,083
Can it or not?
You are the King, no?

555
00:49:04,166 --> 00:49:05,750
It can be arranged.

556
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:11,125
I have been sent by the King of France
to assassinate you.

557
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:17,625
Charles himself sent you?

558
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:19,916
You know this to be certain?

559
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,875
The order's origin I know, yes.

560
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:24,291
From the King.

561
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:27,500
What was the order?

562
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:30,500
That I should kill the King of England.

563
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,666
How?

564
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:35,208
However. Any way.

565
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:37,250
There are many ways to kill a man.

566
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:38,958
It is my talent...

567
00:49:39,833 --> 00:49:42,291
killing men
who do not expect to be killed.

568
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:50,791
At such a time as I endeavor
to foster a fresh and peaceful air

569
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:52,041
for this kingdom to breathe,

570
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:55,083
it is not in my interest to stir hostility
with another.

571
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:56,708
This is an act of war.

572
00:49:56,791 --> 00:50:00,541
We share your longing for peace,
my liege,

573
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:04,333
but to ignore
such an audacious act of aggression

574
00:50:04,416 --> 00:50:06,625
will be seen as weakness.

575
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:10,416
This is no game ball. This is an assassin.

576
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,541
Would you consider me weak, Chief Justice?

577
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:14,500
No.

578
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:17,333
No, I speak more of the kingdom.

579
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,208
What the kingdom sees.

580
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:21,041
What the kingdom sees. Mm.

581
00:50:21,125 --> 00:50:24,916
How, pray, might the kingdom
see the weasel beneath our feet?

582
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:27,041
If France's animus towards you

583
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:29,791
runs deep enough for them
to send an assassin,

584
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:34,333
it will be felt in the street,
ours and theirs.

585
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:35,666
It will be known.

586
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,750
We share your concerns.

587
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:43,500
But peace today needs more than harmony.

588
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,791
It needs strength...

589
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:47,250
and confidence.

590
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:51,750
These are qualities
that can originate only in you,

591
00:50:53,333 --> 00:50:54,250
the king.

592
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:57,958
Our king.

593
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:07,250
Take down these words...

594
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,333
addressed to King Charles of France.

595
00:51:16,916 --> 00:51:18,250
This assassin you send

596
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:21,291
can be taken as nothing other
than an infant act of war.

597
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,416
If this be your intention,

598
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,375
I say you let it be known plainly

599
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,458
and that you desist
from this timorous slither

600
00:51:30,541 --> 00:51:32,208
in which you presently engage.

601
00:51:35,041 --> 00:51:36,458
If it be war you seek,

602
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,750
send the full weight of your army.

603
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:43,416
For a lone, cowardly assassin

604
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,958
will not topple
this King Henry the Fifth of England

605
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:47,500
you so underestimate.

606
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,916
Fill this with gunstones
and send it back to France.

607
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:35,416
Go get the master.

608
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,166
- Who is it?
- A Frenchman, sire.

609
00:52:43,541 --> 00:52:45,791
He says he wishes
to speak with you privately.

610
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:47,500
About what?

611
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,500
He wouldn't say, sire.

612
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,500
I asked of him, he wouldn't say.

613
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:02,500
My king has sent me to seek out men
he feels he can trust.

614
00:53:03,166 --> 00:53:05,791
He believes there is
discreet discussion to be had.

615
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:07,958
What discussion?

616
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:13,000
He believes there is discussion to be had
about your new king of England.

617
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:56,750
Only myself and Lord Grey
were met.

618
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:02,208
We knew not where to turn
about what was spoken to us.

619
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:06,666
We're all of us aware
there's a standing problem.

620
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:09,791
Our king is of low repute.

621
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:11,833
The French king...

622
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:13,916
teaches you this?

623
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:16,708
Is he not thankful

624
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:21,125
for our young Henry's light reaction
to his provocation?

625
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:24,125
The assassin he swears he knows not of.

626
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:25,416
'Tis a charge he denies.

627
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,750
His plot came to naught.

628
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:29,208
Of course he would wish
to wipe his hands of it.

629
00:54:30,791 --> 00:54:32,291
Whatever the root,

630
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:35,791
they have expressed grave concern

631
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:38,416
regarding our king's mental fortitude.

632
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:42,875
This envoy is to be trusted, is he not,
Cambridge?

633
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:44,583
I believe so.

634
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:50,708
Charles wishes to dethrone our king.

635
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:53,750
The issue is not France.

636
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:58,208
This is but a reminder to us
of a more general lunacy.

637
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:01,541
A boy who but weeks ago
was a drunken boor

638
00:55:01,625 --> 00:55:04,375
from the sewers of Eastcheap
now wears England's crown.

639
00:55:04,875 --> 00:55:06,791
- Hmm.
- What shall become of us?

640
00:55:07,708 --> 00:55:09,833
What shall become of us
when civil misdeeds are forgiven

641
00:55:09,916 --> 00:55:11,833
as if they were but indiscretions?

642
00:55:12,833 --> 00:55:15,083
- When traitors...
- Yes, yes, Lord Grey, your...

643
00:55:16,166 --> 00:55:18,083
Your concerns are current.

644
00:55:19,958 --> 00:55:21,625
And they are numerous.

645
00:55:23,166 --> 00:55:24,833
Something must be done.

646
00:55:26,291 --> 00:55:27,625
Something will be done.

647
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:32,291
Give me quiet.

648
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:48,541
<i>Thus is a king's burden.</i>

649
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:53,791
A king must make decisions

650
00:55:54,416 --> 00:55:55,708
lesser men are...

651
00:55:57,208 --> 00:56:00,000
neither willing nor able to make.

652
00:56:02,208 --> 00:56:04,625
A king is indeed presented with quandaries

653
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:06,916
lesser men might never encounter

654
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,833
in the course of their whole lives.

655
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,000
I wish it were not so.

656
00:56:30,375 --> 00:56:31,791
But problems...

657
00:56:32,583 --> 00:56:34,416
And this is my experience.

658
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,458
Problems that are left unattended...

659
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,541
have a habit of becoming crises.

660
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:46,916
You have a chance here
to unite the land, Hal.

661
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:48,583
Truly.

662
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,625
You have refreshed its mood with promise.

663
00:56:54,916 --> 00:56:57,166
But promise must be fulfilled.

664
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:02,750
Promise can never be an end in itself.

665
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:32,166
As of this day, we're at war with France.

666
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:37,000
Twice I have given her
the benefit of my doubt.

667
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:40,708
This third affront
will not be left unchecked.

668
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:46,958
And so, in order to flush
these French rats from their nests,

669
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:50,500
I will have it communicated to them

670
00:57:51,083 --> 00:57:52,583
that we are now at war.

671
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:05,750
My Lord Grey.

672
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:07,750
Cambridge.

673
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:17,416
I would ask you to deliver this message
to France, given your...

674
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:21,333
familiarity with its recipient.

675
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:27,125
But I believe in the morning
you be otherwise engaged.

676
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:31,166
Pray how, my liege?

677
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:35,666
Tomorrow you will have your heads cut off.

678
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:36,583
No.

679
00:58:37,916 --> 00:58:40,916
I have chosen to send you
as an advance party to Hell

680
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:42,958
for the considerable French number

681
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:45,250
that will soon be needing
to find space there.

682
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:51,750
You were once my friend.

683
00:58:54,291 --> 00:58:55,916
I am your friend...

684
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,333
cousin.

685
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,500
All leave.

686
01:00:11,666 --> 01:00:12,500
Now.

687
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:20,583
You.

688
01:00:21,333 --> 01:00:22,166
Stay.

689
01:00:25,416 --> 01:00:26,250
You...

690
01:00:27,166 --> 01:00:28,000
leave.

691
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,666
This is my place.

692
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:32,041
The hostess can stay.

693
01:00:40,916 --> 01:00:43,250
I will not jump to your attention.

694
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:47,750
And surely not to retread
vile ground

695
01:00:47,833 --> 01:00:50,000
I vowed never to walk again.

696
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:53,875
I acknowledge my neglect of you, John.

697
01:00:56,458 --> 01:01:00,291
A new chapter of my life has begun
before the last could be properly closed.

698
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:05,875
These concerns are mine and mine alone.

699
01:01:07,708 --> 01:01:09,666
But the fact that this here
be the first occasion

700
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:12,250
I've had to sound them aloud
to anyone other than myself

701
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:13,625
speaks volumes.

702
01:01:17,125 --> 01:01:20,458
It speaks to the loneliness
of the position in which I find myself.

703
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:24,083
To steer our present course,

704
01:01:24,166 --> 01:01:26,250
I've been forced
to rely upon the counsel of men

705
01:01:26,333 --> 01:01:29,125
whose loyalty I question
every waking moment.

706
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:33,416
Every waking moment.

707
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:38,000
I need men around me I can trust.

708
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:46,416
I'm here because you are my friend.

709
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:51,916
A king has no friends.

710
01:01:54,666 --> 01:01:56,166
A king has only...

711
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:58,083
followers...

712
01:01:58,791 --> 01:01:59,708
and foe.

713
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:14,458
I'm sorry my occasion to visit...

714
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:17,958
carries with it this doleful weight.

715
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:24,416
Hal.

716
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,208
I will come with you.

717
01:02:30,166 --> 01:02:32,875
I ask only one favor in return.

718
01:02:35,333 --> 01:02:38,333
Square my account
with that terrible hag...

719
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:40,333
over there. Would you?

720
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:48,625
<i>We welcome</i>
<i>those newly arrived here.</i>

721
01:02:49,875 --> 01:02:53,416
Turn us now in common poise,
with one mind, sharpened.

722
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:56,083
Together...

723
01:02:57,041 --> 01:02:58,541
we will bring France down.

724
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:00,500
Together...

725
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,833
we will bring her to her knees.

726
01:03:04,416 --> 01:03:06,208
Captains all, to this end,

727
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:09,791
I wish to introduce to you
a new marshal of our campaign.

728
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:13,166
Sir John Falstaff.

729
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:21,916
Sir John's experience in battle
should need no recitation.

730
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:22,875
You know of him.

731
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:26,416
Some of you have had the honor
of fighting alongside him.

732
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:29,916
Others have heard tale of his exploits.

733
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:33,125
But I have tasked Sir John
to join this campaign

734
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:35,083
for one most vital reason alone:

735
01:03:35,166 --> 01:03:36,375
he respects war

736
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:39,500
as only a man who has seen
its most monstrous form can.

737
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:42,708
He lusts after it not,

738
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:45,333
but rather regards it
with the grim sobriety

739
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:47,541
that you and your men
should hope he would.

740
01:03:52,083 --> 01:03:53,041
Welcome,

741
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:54,750
and thank you...

742
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:56,583
good sirs.

743
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:58,416
You're all well met.

744
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:08,250
Very good.

745
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:18,625
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

746
01:04:28,541 --> 01:04:30,208
Are you ready for what awaits us?

747
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:34,208
One is never ready for what awaits us.

748
01:04:50,416 --> 01:04:51,291
Get!

749
01:05:02,166 --> 01:05:05,416
You believe Sir John there
to be fit and suitable enough

750
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:06,833
to captain this effort?

751
01:05:13,916 --> 01:05:15,291
John is a good man.

752
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:36,416
They meet us at sea
or upon landing.

753
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,458
We shall know soon enough.

754
01:05:44,916 --> 01:05:46,000
You must rest.

755
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:54,916
John.

756
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,083
Thank you.

757
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:12,208
What for?

758
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:13,958
For being here.

759
01:06:15,541 --> 01:06:16,541
With me.

760
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,750
Well, it's a small price to pay

761
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:21,291
to keep that detestable Hooper woman
off me back.

762
01:06:25,166 --> 01:06:26,708
Get some rest too, my liege.

763
01:07:03,625 --> 01:07:05,500
We land quickly!

764
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:35,208
Check every building.

765
01:07:39,541 --> 01:07:40,666
No man!

766
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:41,625
Watch.

767
01:07:41,708 --> 01:07:43,250
- No man here!
- Clear!

768
01:07:43,541 --> 01:07:45,333
- No man here.
- No man.

769
01:08:04,791 --> 01:08:05,791
Go on. Faster.

770
01:08:19,416 --> 01:08:20,250
Light.

771
01:08:21,166 --> 01:08:22,000
Pull!

772
01:08:37,291 --> 01:08:38,125
Pull!

773
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:28,125
We must storm that castle.

774
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:32,666
It will be bloody.
We will most surely sacrifice souls.

775
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:35,875
Thus is the nature of war.
It is bloody and soulless.

776
01:09:36,707 --> 01:09:38,125
We have no way of knowing

777
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:40,250
how well supplied they are
behind those walls.

778
01:09:40,332 --> 01:09:41,791
This siege may take months,

779
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:44,250
and months, I fear,
we have not at our disposal.

780
01:09:45,082 --> 01:09:46,916
Men in these numbers, fixed here,

781
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:49,207
will fall to hunger and disease.

782
01:09:54,375 --> 01:09:55,250
Sir John.

783
01:10:00,666 --> 01:10:01,583
War is...

784
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,000
bloody and soulless.

785
01:10:04,958 --> 01:10:05,791
Yes.

786
01:10:27,125 --> 01:10:28,708
The archbishop has arrived.

787
01:10:30,041 --> 01:10:32,208
Surely you cannot
simply idle here

788
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:34,208
until they decide to come out?

789
01:10:35,416 --> 01:10:38,666
That is precisely the definition
of a siege.

790
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:42,708
How long might that take?
Surely there's no way of knowing.

791
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:46,208
Uh, that too,
is a common characteristic of a siege.

792
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:48,791
- I will not send my men up that hill.
- But why in heavens not?

793
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:53,041
I will not sacrifice my men so flagrantly,
nor so speculatively.

794
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:57,708
Well, then why do you not
simply go around?

795
01:10:58,125 --> 01:11:02,250
If they insist on hiding in their castle,
why do you not simply go around it?

796
01:11:03,833 --> 01:11:06,375
So well versed in the art of warfare.

797
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:16,083
We must take this town,
Archbishop.

798
01:11:16,791 --> 01:11:19,666
We must establish
a garrison foothold here...

799
01:11:20,708 --> 01:11:23,250
for our lines of supply from England.

800
01:11:25,333 --> 01:11:28,416
Do not forget
that I have underwritten this campaign.

801
01:11:30,083 --> 01:11:31,333
I have interest here.

802
01:11:32,666 --> 01:11:33,916
And I will be heard.

803
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:38,416
Not today, Archbishop.

804
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:51,916
My liege.

805
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,625
They have surrendered.

806
01:11:57,458 --> 01:12:00,291
- Our debate now, it seems, is for nothing.
- Hmm.

807
01:12:03,375 --> 01:12:05,250
As are the archbishop's bleatings.

808
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:11,875
The day is yours.

809
01:12:13,625 --> 01:12:16,166
We ask only
that our women and children be freed.

810
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,458
Many are hungry and wounded
and becoming sick.

811
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:27,958
Upon full account of the castle,

812
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:30,583
I see no reason to deny your request.

813
01:12:30,958 --> 01:12:34,458
You will have tonight
to oversee this evacuation

814
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,291
and to corral your men prisoners.

815
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:54,875
Come.

816
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,291
He wishes to slow us.

817
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,625
Who wishes to slow us?

818
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:21,125
We have received word
that the Dauphin is en route.

819
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:23,875
He wishes conference with His Majesty.

820
01:13:24,958 --> 01:13:26,625
And we know nothing of his purpose?

821
01:13:26,708 --> 01:13:29,041
We know only that he desires conference.

822
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:33,583
I would hope his purpose be
to deliver his father's early surrender.

823
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:36,416
I strongly advise
we disregard this word of his approach

824
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,458
and ready our movement.

825
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:40,208
We must make advantage of their disarray.

826
01:13:43,416 --> 01:13:45,166
Sir John, your counsel.

827
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:48,041
I've never met the man...

828
01:13:48,916 --> 01:13:50,208
this French prince.

829
01:13:51,583 --> 01:13:53,333
I can't speak to his motivation.

830
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:17,083
My liege.

831
01:14:20,916 --> 01:14:21,791
He's here.

832
01:14:47,375 --> 01:14:48,333
Your Majesty.

833
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:53,041
Ah!

834
01:14:56,416 --> 01:14:57,416
To...

835
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:58,416
your little...

836
01:14:59,416 --> 01:15:00,291
victory.

837
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,166
Ah.

838
01:15:09,375 --> 01:15:10,916
Do you wonder why

839
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:12,416
I have come?

840
01:15:14,375 --> 01:15:15,208
Hmm?

841
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:17,458
Do you wonder this?

842
01:15:21,208 --> 01:15:25,375
I have not come to offer you surrender

843
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,375
if that is what you are hoping.

844
01:15:31,541 --> 01:15:35,208
I have come to describe for you

845
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:37,625
your end days,

846
01:15:39,375 --> 01:15:41,041
the screams of your men

847
01:15:41,666 --> 01:15:43,166
as they die slow.

848
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:47,000
And so, King of, uh, England,

849
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:51,625
you seem so intent
on making France your new home,

850
01:15:52,541 --> 01:15:53,666
so let me help you.

851
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:58,458
I will drain your body of its blood

852
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:02,333
and bury it under a tree.

853
01:16:03,375 --> 01:16:05,750
A little French tree.

854
01:16:07,041 --> 01:16:08,000
Very young,

855
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:09,833
very small.

856
01:16:11,916 --> 01:16:15,416
Since perchance that is fitting
of your mind for you to come here.

857
01:16:17,041 --> 01:16:17,916
Small.

858
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:21,916
And maybe your...

859
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:28,583
I mean, no, your balls must be big, no?

860
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:31,458
Giant balls.

861
01:16:34,583 --> 01:16:35,708
Giant balls...

862
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:37,791
with a tiny cock.

863
01:16:46,958 --> 01:16:51,333
And the sound
of your wives and children weeping

864
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:54,666
shall lull me to sleep at night.

865
01:17:12,083 --> 01:17:13,625
Have you heard what I said?

866
01:17:15,125 --> 01:17:16,041
I have.

867
01:17:17,541 --> 01:17:18,666
It was stirring.

868
01:17:21,958 --> 01:17:23,666
Sir John, please walk with me.

869
01:17:27,583 --> 01:17:28,416
Good night.

870
01:17:40,958 --> 01:17:42,375
Ready the men to move.

871
01:17:44,625 --> 01:17:45,750
Waste no time.

872
01:20:03,083 --> 01:20:03,916
Run!

873
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:16,750
Hush, hush, hush.

874
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:17,916
Hush.

875
01:20:18,708 --> 01:20:19,541
Hush.

876
01:20:22,833 --> 01:20:24,000
Hello, little boy.

877
01:20:25,916 --> 01:20:27,958
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

878
01:20:31,666 --> 01:20:36,125
I want you to deliver a gift to your king.

879
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,875
Will you do this for me?

880
01:20:40,833 --> 01:20:41,791
Good boy.

881
01:21:04,375 --> 01:21:05,291
No!

882
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:16,541
Double the guards to 20 yards
through the night.

883
01:21:16,875 --> 01:21:18,250
Three hours at a watch.

884
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,375
I want these men fresh and alert.

885
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,916
Any man caught sleeping
will have his eyes gouged.

886
01:21:24,291 --> 01:21:26,250
Any caught speaking will lose his tongue.

887
01:21:33,125 --> 01:21:36,000
And I want all French prisoners
in our train put to death.

888
01:21:37,416 --> 01:21:40,250
Leave their corpses speared on pikes
by the river's edge.

889
01:21:41,666 --> 01:21:43,958
The first command I'll heed.

890
01:21:44,958 --> 01:21:46,000
The second...

891
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:50,708
you'll have to carry out
that mass execution yourself.

892
01:21:52,541 --> 01:21:53,666
What did you say to me?

893
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:56,291
You are not that man.

894
01:21:57,166 --> 01:21:58,666
How dare you defy me?

895
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:00,625
Show your feeling in here, with me.

896
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:03,416
- Don't let it outside this tent.
- How dare you defy me? I am the king.

897
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,083
And where is
the fearsome old warrior Falstaff

898
01:22:07,166 --> 01:22:08,625
about whom I've heard so much?

899
01:22:09,666 --> 01:22:11,791
You've been mute since we crossed the sea.

900
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:14,333
I seem to be serving
as my own chief tactician,

901
01:22:14,416 --> 01:22:16,166
my own commander, my own counsel.

902
01:22:17,291 --> 01:22:19,541
Where is
the fearsome old warrior Falstaff?!

903
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,625
I speak only
when there's something to be said.

904
01:22:26,958 --> 01:22:29,250
Too often have I seen men of war

905
01:22:29,875 --> 01:22:31,666
invent work for themselves,

906
01:22:32,625 --> 01:22:35,708
work that leads to nothing
but vainglory and slaughtered men.

907
01:22:36,666 --> 01:22:37,708
I'm not that man.

908
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:41,625
And this here is the war
that you have chosen to wage.

909
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:44,291
I will disembowel you right here
with mine own hand.

910
01:22:49,625 --> 01:22:51,416
You are not that man, either.

911
01:23:08,041 --> 01:23:09,250
Evening, M'Lord.

912
01:23:09,666 --> 01:23:11,583
- Gentlemen.
- M'Lord.

913
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:48,750
Lord Dorset,

914
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,625
summon your fastest rider.

915
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:52,083
My liege.

916
01:24:53,208 --> 01:24:54,166
Dartmouth!

917
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:00,875
Sires. What can I do for you?

918
01:25:00,958 --> 01:25:04,041
Tell me what lies over that hill.
Ride fast, return directly.

919
01:25:04,416 --> 01:25:05,291
Hyah!

920
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,625
We are both outnumbered
and out-positioned.

921
01:25:33,416 --> 01:25:35,375
They have the downslope in their favor.

922
01:25:36,375 --> 01:25:38,708
Our need to advance
puts us already at disadvantage.

923
01:25:38,791 --> 01:25:40,791
The longer we wait,
the larger their force will grow,

924
01:25:40,875 --> 01:25:42,375
and with it, our disadvantage.

925
01:25:43,166 --> 01:25:45,708
Your archers, my lord,
are of superior faculty.

926
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,541
French crossbow is no match
for an English longbow.

927
01:25:49,208 --> 01:25:52,625
We should hobble their number
on first assault by these means alone.

928
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:58,291
York's charge in center
faces four lines of mounted knights.

929
01:25:58,375 --> 01:26:00,708
Our archers here
might weaken those by half. But...

930
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:03,541
But not eight lines.

931
01:26:04,708 --> 01:26:06,125
Nine. Ten. More.

932
01:26:06,416 --> 01:26:07,708
You speak true, my liege.

933
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:10,041
The longer we wait,
the greater our disadvantage.

934
01:26:10,125 --> 01:26:14,000
But it is possible our disadvantage
has already grown insurmountable.

935
01:26:15,583 --> 01:26:18,083
A great many men
are already desperately ill

936
01:26:18,166 --> 01:26:19,625
and weak from hunger.

937
01:26:19,708 --> 01:26:20,750
What then, my lord,

938
01:26:21,541 --> 01:26:22,958
do you propose we do?

939
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:26,166
I propose we consider turning back,
my liege.

940
01:26:27,458 --> 01:26:29,791
I know it will not bring
the outcome we desire,

941
01:26:29,875 --> 01:26:32,041
but nor will the evisceration of our army.

942
01:26:35,458 --> 01:26:37,791
I'm reticent to speak for others here now,

943
01:26:39,125 --> 01:26:41,166
but I'm certain my fears are shared.

944
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:51,791
Who here agrees with Lord Dorset?

945
01:26:57,291 --> 01:26:58,916
You can win this battle.

946
01:27:01,541 --> 01:27:03,041
Is that so, Sir John?

947
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:04,875
Yes.

948
01:27:05,541 --> 01:27:08,041
And precisely how is that so, Sir John?

949
01:27:08,875 --> 01:27:11,333
You fight without horses
and without armor.

950
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,416
Heavens above,
please spare us from this man.

951
01:27:15,166 --> 01:27:18,333
Their forward defense
is a front line of mounted men.

952
01:27:19,625 --> 01:27:20,541
Many deep.

953
01:27:20,958 --> 01:27:21,916
Knights all.

954
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:23,791
All on horseback,

955
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:25,541
all with heavy armor.

956
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:29,208
The ground out there...

957
01:27:30,291 --> 01:27:31,458
is a flood bowl,

958
01:27:32,541 --> 01:27:33,833
already half-sodden.

959
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:36,791
When it rains tonight, as I know it will,

960
01:27:38,166 --> 01:27:40,375
that ground will turn into a muddy bog.

961
01:27:41,083 --> 01:27:43,000
And with their horses and their armor,

962
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,375
they will get stuck,

963
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:47,250
they will fall,

964
01:27:48,416 --> 01:27:50,791
and they will flounder
like upturned beetles.

965
01:27:50,875 --> 01:27:51,958
As shall we.

966
01:27:52,583 --> 01:27:54,250
Not if we travel light,

967
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:56,625
without horses and without armor.

968
01:27:57,875 --> 01:28:00,708
Speed and mobility will be our advantage.

969
01:28:02,041 --> 01:28:03,666
And how, Sir John,

970
01:28:04,166 --> 01:28:06,625
can you be so sure of rainfall tonight?

971
01:28:09,333 --> 01:28:10,958
My right knee is aching.

972
01:28:11,041 --> 01:28:13,166
It only does that when rain is near.

973
01:28:14,541 --> 01:28:16,875
Oh, save us, my liege.
Please put a stop to this drivel.

974
01:28:18,125 --> 01:28:21,541
This would require their armored
front line come meet us in the mud.

975
01:28:21,625 --> 01:28:23,333
How do you propose we invite that?

976
01:28:23,958 --> 01:28:26,708
A small forward armored attack of our own.

977
01:28:28,458 --> 01:28:29,666
A false advance.

978
01:28:31,416 --> 01:28:32,458
They will counter.

979
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:37,625
We save our weight and our muscle
for a nimble assault from the flanks.

980
01:28:37,708 --> 01:28:42,000
They shan't be so easily deceived.
They will not respond to false attack.

981
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:42,916
Hmm.

982
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:47,500
They will respond.

983
01:28:48,916 --> 01:28:51,458
We move, they will meet us in the mud.

984
01:28:52,083 --> 01:28:54,791
Our men-at-arms are outnumbered.
This they know.

985
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:57,125
They will hope to overwhelm us,

986
01:28:57,541 --> 01:28:59,416
so they will meet us with full force,

987
01:28:59,958 --> 01:29:02,333
no matter how small our first advance.

988
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:07,208
Our great longbows
will rain chaos on them from above.

989
01:29:08,458 --> 01:29:10,333
That chaos will be your favor.

990
01:29:10,416 --> 01:29:14,500
My liege, I implore you, we mustn't...
we mustn't listen to this madness.

991
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:17,875
What is the true experience of this man?

992
01:29:18,458 --> 01:29:20,583
He once fought for Richard many years ago.

993
01:29:20,666 --> 01:29:22,666
Since then, he has done nothing...

994
01:29:23,916 --> 01:29:25,666
other than ride with the companies,

995
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:28,083
robbing and tormenting.

996
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:33,208
I never robbed anyone
who didn't deserve to be robbed.

997
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:41,208
If it rains tonight,

998
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,000
we fight tomorrow.

999
01:30:06,583 --> 01:30:10,083
If you have concocted this plan,
half-baked and speculative,

1000
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:13,208
merely to prove to me your worth,

1001
01:30:14,541 --> 01:30:15,750
please say so now.

1002
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:21,666
All plans are speculative.

1003
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:27,541
And as I say,
I only speak them when I feel them true.

1004
01:30:28,333 --> 01:30:30,041
This one I feel in my bones.

1005
01:30:32,416 --> 01:30:34,333
This one I feel in my knee bone.

1006
01:30:40,416 --> 01:30:42,958
Here we are on the eve of this fight,
and I am...

1007
01:30:46,208 --> 01:30:48,125
I am scared to wonder,

1008
01:30:48,791 --> 01:30:49,916
to tell it true,

1009
01:30:53,416 --> 01:30:54,625
why we are here.

1010
01:30:56,541 --> 01:30:58,833
You best discover the answer for that.

1011
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,666
The men out there deserve it.

1012
01:31:04,208 --> 01:31:05,958
They've given their lives to you.

1013
01:31:08,458 --> 01:31:11,750
I cannot say what forces
have conspired to bring you here,

1014
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:13,375
but these men need you,

1015
01:31:14,833 --> 01:31:16,208
just as you need them.

1016
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:20,125
These men deserve your confidence.

1017
01:31:25,166 --> 01:31:27,083
And if you cannot give them that,

1018
01:31:27,541 --> 01:31:30,583
at least then tell them a magnificent lie.

1019
01:31:37,958 --> 01:31:40,041
Though you might not think it possible...

1020
01:31:42,166 --> 01:31:43,416
you are my friend.

1021
01:31:49,416 --> 01:31:50,375
Good night, Hal.

1022
01:31:53,666 --> 01:31:54,583
Sleep well.

1023
01:33:19,416 --> 01:33:21,416
This wind whips from the north.

1024
01:33:23,291 --> 01:33:25,166
The rain was sent from England.

1025
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:28,625
Why are you being fitted with plate?
We were to fight without armor.

1026
01:33:29,333 --> 01:33:31,375
We need a front line to draw them in.

1027
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:35,041
It cannot be you.

1028
01:33:35,666 --> 01:33:36,916
The idea was mine.

1029
01:33:37,875 --> 01:33:41,708
Some man must lead the first push
to sell it well.

1030
01:33:43,125 --> 01:33:44,583
My men have been assembled.

1031
01:33:45,791 --> 01:33:47,375
And I cannot, in good conscience,

1032
01:33:47,458 --> 01:33:50,083
send them out there
to realize my speculative drivel

1033
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:52,125
without getting muddy alongside them,
can I?

1034
01:33:52,958 --> 01:33:54,125
I will fight with you.

1035
01:33:56,333 --> 01:33:58,166
It's noble,

1036
01:33:58,250 --> 01:33:59,666
but you know that cannot be.

1037
01:34:02,291 --> 01:34:03,875
This is what I was built for.

1038
01:34:05,375 --> 01:34:06,916
I die here or...

1039
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:10,041
I die over a bottle in Eastcheap.

1040
01:34:10,833 --> 01:34:13,458
And I think this makes
for a much better story.

1041
01:34:15,333 --> 01:34:17,125
And you have things still to do.

1042
01:34:19,958 --> 01:34:21,583
You will join this fight.

1043
01:34:23,666 --> 01:34:26,958
But promise me you don't join too early.

1044
01:34:27,791 --> 01:34:29,875
It doesn't matter what you see out there.

1045
01:34:31,541 --> 01:34:33,833
We must first draw them all in.
All of them.

1046
01:34:36,208 --> 01:34:37,458
Promise me that, Hal.

1047
01:34:40,125 --> 01:34:41,875
Win, my friend.

1048
01:34:43,666 --> 01:34:47,041
Maybe then you'll lighten enough
to have a drink with me. Hmm?

1049
01:35:10,333 --> 01:35:11,875
Where is the Dauphin?

1050
01:35:26,375 --> 01:35:29,125
I humbly thank you for receiving me,
noble lord.

1051
01:35:29,458 --> 01:35:30,458
Please.

1052
01:35:31,416 --> 01:35:32,500
Please speak English.

1053
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:37,041
I enjoy to speak English.

1054
01:35:38,875 --> 01:35:40,291
It is simple...

1055
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:41,833
and ugly.

1056
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:45,666
I have been waiting all morning,

1057
01:35:47,041 --> 01:35:48,000
all the night...

1058
01:35:48,541 --> 01:35:49,500
for your surrender.

1059
01:35:51,250 --> 01:35:54,333
It might have saved a great unease

1060
01:35:54,708 --> 01:35:55,791
had it come sooner.

1061
01:35:56,541 --> 01:35:58,416
I know you do not speak for your father.

1062
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,375
I do speak for my father.

1063
01:36:00,458 --> 01:36:03,750
I know you do not speak for your father,
so I come to you now directly.

1064
01:36:03,833 --> 01:36:05,291
I have not come to surrender.

1065
01:36:06,416 --> 01:36:09,708
Too much Christian blood
will be spilled on this field today.

1066
01:36:09,791 --> 01:36:11,125
So, I propose this:

1067
01:36:12,375 --> 01:36:14,666
You and I fight, one man on one man.

1068
01:36:16,291 --> 01:36:17,833
We fight in our armies' stead.

1069
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:22,166
If I lose, my men will leave this place
forthwith and forever.

1070
01:36:22,541 --> 01:36:23,666
You will have my head.

1071
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:26,083
If I win,

1072
01:36:26,166 --> 01:36:29,166
I will assume this kingdom's crown
upon your father's death.

1073
01:36:35,041 --> 01:36:35,958
What say you?

1074
01:36:38,583 --> 01:36:41,000
Are you scared, young Henry?

1075
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:44,916
What say you?

1076
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:47,333
Are you scared of this battle?

1077
01:36:48,375 --> 01:36:49,958
There is no shame of it.

1078
01:36:55,666 --> 01:36:56,708
Save your men.

1079
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:59,166
You save your own men.

1080
01:37:01,125 --> 01:37:02,458
You came here.

1081
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:03,916
To me!

1082
01:37:04,666 --> 01:37:06,166
Surrender to me!

1083
01:37:08,916 --> 01:37:10,125
I cannot do that.

1084
01:37:11,833 --> 01:37:13,000
Well, then, boy,

1085
01:37:13,958 --> 01:37:15,375
let us make famous...

1086
01:37:16,708 --> 01:37:17,958
that field out there.

1087
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:21,541
This little village of Agincourt,

1088
01:37:22,791 --> 01:37:26,000
that will forever mark the site
of your callow disgrace.

1089
01:37:57,625 --> 01:37:59,208
You expect of me a speech?

1090
01:38:02,041 --> 01:38:03,500
I have only one to give,

1091
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,291
and it is the same one I'd give

1092
01:38:05,375 --> 01:38:08,166
were we not standing
on the brim of a battlefield.

1093
01:38:08,625 --> 01:38:12,500
It is the same one I'd give
were we to meet in the street by chance.

1094
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:16,083
I have only ever hoped for one thing...

1095
01:38:17,833 --> 01:38:21,333
to see this kingdom united
under this English crown.

1096
01:38:28,583 --> 01:38:30,583
All men are born to die. We know it.

1097
01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:33,041
We carry it with us always.

1098
01:38:34,083 --> 01:38:37,250
If your day be today, so be it.

1099
01:38:37,333 --> 01:38:38,625
Mine will be tomorrow.

1100
01:38:39,833 --> 01:38:42,625
Or mine today and yours tomorrow.
It matters not.

1101
01:38:43,625 --> 01:38:45,750
What matters is that you know,
in your hearts,

1102
01:38:45,833 --> 01:38:48,375
that today you are that kingdom united.

1103
01:38:48,458 --> 01:38:49,750
You are England.

1104
01:38:49,833 --> 01:38:52,791
Each and every one of you. England is you.

1105
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:55,458
And it is the space between you.

1106
01:38:55,541 --> 01:38:58,500
Fight not for yourselves,
fight for that space.

1107
01:38:58,583 --> 01:38:59,666
Fill that space.

1108
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:01,166
Make it tissue.

1109
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:02,125
Make it mass.

1110
01:39:02,208 --> 01:39:03,833
Make it impenetrable.

1111
01:39:03,916 --> 01:39:05,125
Make it yours!

1112
01:39:05,208 --> 01:39:06,791
Make it England!

1113
01:39:07,375 --> 01:39:09,083
Make it England!

1114
01:39:16,833 --> 01:39:19,250
Great men to it. Captains, lords.

1115
01:39:19,583 --> 01:39:21,041
Great men to it!

1116
01:39:50,458 --> 01:39:53,416
For the King and St. George!

1117
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:56,916
For the King and St. George!

1118
01:40:17,833 --> 01:40:19,291
<i>Les imbéciles.</i>

1119
01:41:38,458 --> 01:41:39,416
Archers.

1120
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:40,625
Archers!

1121
01:41:41,208 --> 01:41:42,416
Archers!

1122
01:41:42,500 --> 01:41:44,583
Archers! Now!

1123
01:41:46,291 --> 01:41:47,416
Draw!

1124
01:41:51,208 --> 01:41:52,041
Loose!

1125
01:42:12,083 --> 01:42:13,250
Halt!

1126
01:42:15,041 --> 01:42:15,875
Ready!

1127
01:44:38,583 --> 01:44:39,541
Loose!

1128
01:45:00,375 --> 01:45:01,625
On me!

1129
01:49:31,916 --> 01:49:32,750
Come then...

1130
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,041
King of England.

1131
01:52:47,083 --> 01:52:48,166
Hail the King.

1132
01:52:48,416 --> 01:52:49,375
Hail the King.

1133
01:52:55,916 --> 01:52:56,958
Hail the King.

1134
01:52:57,791 --> 01:52:58,750
My liege.

1135
01:52:58,833 --> 01:53:00,666
- God save the King.
- Hail the King.

1136
01:53:03,791 --> 01:53:04,750
Hail the King.

1137
01:53:05,541 --> 01:53:06,541
Hail the King.

1138
01:53:09,708 --> 01:53:11,750
- Hail the King.
- Hail King Henry.

1139
01:53:11,833 --> 01:53:12,958
Hail the King.

1140
01:53:14,833 --> 01:53:16,000
My liege.

1141
01:53:16,625 --> 01:53:18,708
The prisoners we have took are a rabble.

1142
01:53:19,875 --> 01:53:22,916
I fear we will not secure them
should their army regroup.

1143
01:53:26,416 --> 01:53:27,416
Kill them all.

1144
01:54:11,833 --> 01:54:13,208
Your Majesty...

1145
01:54:14,041 --> 01:54:16,125
Henry, King of England.

1146
01:54:17,875 --> 01:54:18,708
Hmm.

1147
01:54:23,166 --> 01:54:25,041
Your Majesty...

1148
01:54:25,958 --> 01:54:27,375
Come sit here with me.

1149
01:54:31,875 --> 01:54:32,791
Please.

1150
01:54:43,583 --> 01:54:47,750
I like to have the sun on my skin,
but not too much.

1151
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,958
Too much is very dangerous.

1152
01:55:06,416 --> 01:55:10,208
This conversation we are about to have...

1153
01:55:11,250 --> 01:55:13,375
has been had many times before,

1154
01:55:13,458 --> 01:55:17,666
and will be had many times again
for centuries to come

1155
01:55:18,291 --> 01:55:22,583
between men of vanity
and men of good reason.

1156
01:55:23,625 --> 01:55:26,333
I would hope that you and I

1157
01:55:26,416 --> 01:55:28,000
are men of good reason.

1158
01:55:32,708 --> 01:55:35,541
I have, of course, traveled here

1159
01:55:35,625 --> 01:55:38,250
to offer you my surrender.

1160
01:55:41,416 --> 01:55:43,500
Do you ask anything of me in return?

1161
01:55:45,708 --> 01:55:46,541
No.

1162
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:54,750
I do, however,

1163
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:57,458
have for you a proposition.

1164
01:56:00,375 --> 01:56:03,625
You take the hand of my daughter,

1165
01:56:03,708 --> 01:56:04,625
Catherine,

1166
01:56:06,583 --> 01:56:07,666
in marriage.

1167
01:56:11,083 --> 01:56:12,625
It is most uncanny...

1168
01:56:14,375 --> 01:56:16,708
that the great movements of history

1169
01:56:16,791 --> 01:56:21,333
so frequently find their origins
in the minutia of family.

1170
01:56:24,375 --> 01:56:27,166
That in ways I dare not unsettle here,

1171
01:56:28,666 --> 01:56:30,916
my relationship with my son

1172
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,083
and yours...

1173
01:56:32,833 --> 01:56:33,916
with your father.

1174
01:56:35,166 --> 01:56:38,625
These are the things
that have led us here today.

1175
01:56:41,458 --> 01:56:43,250
We are leaders of lands

1176
01:56:44,041 --> 01:56:45,000
and peoples,

1177
01:56:46,291 --> 01:56:47,208
and yet...

1178
01:56:48,250 --> 01:56:50,375
it is family that moves us.

1179
01:56:52,666 --> 01:56:53,625
Family...

1180
01:56:54,250 --> 01:56:55,541
consumes us.

1181
01:57:37,958 --> 01:57:39,916
My condolences to you...

1182
01:57:40,875 --> 01:57:43,500
for the loss of your friend, Sir John.

1183
01:57:46,208 --> 01:57:49,041
I know you must feel this loss deeply.

1184
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,125
Thank you, William.

1185
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:00,208
Your loyalty to me has been comforting.

1186
01:58:19,416 --> 01:58:22,666
You have proven yourself
to be a most worthy king.

1187
01:58:26,208 --> 01:58:28,833
I would say you have proven yourself

1188
01:58:28,916 --> 01:58:31,416
to be one of England's great kings.

1189
01:58:45,041 --> 01:58:47,916
Your Majesty,
the crowd has gathered.

1190
01:58:49,416 --> 01:58:50,458
So I hear.

1191
01:59:16,833 --> 01:59:17,750
Leave us.

1192
01:59:30,958 --> 01:59:32,916
Please sit, Your Majesty.

1193
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,541
You are beautiful.

1194
01:59:44,625 --> 01:59:45,500
<i>Merci.</i>

1195
01:59:47,666 --> 01:59:49,166
I will no longer speak French.

1196
01:59:49,916 --> 01:59:51,041
We must speak English.

1197
01:59:51,750 --> 01:59:53,041
I cannot speak English.

1198
01:59:53,125 --> 01:59:54,083
You will learn.

1199
01:59:55,625 --> 01:59:57,083
I wonder, then,

1200
01:59:57,708 --> 02:00:00,333
how our union might proceed
in the meantime.

1201
02:00:03,791 --> 02:00:06,875
There is much I wonder
about a great many things.

1202
02:00:08,875 --> 02:00:10,541
Indeed there must be for you

1203
02:00:10,625 --> 02:00:13,416
to contemplate marriage
to a woman about whom...

1204
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:15,833
you know so little.

1205
02:00:16,125 --> 02:00:17,125
Hmm.

1206
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,833
I will not submit to you.

1207
02:00:23,916 --> 02:00:25,750
You must earn my respect.

1208
02:00:28,833 --> 02:00:30,083
I understand that.

1209
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:32,583
Do you?

1210
02:00:33,208 --> 02:00:34,208
I do.

1211
02:00:35,916 --> 02:00:38,208
Do you feel a sense of achievement?

1212
02:00:41,375 --> 02:00:42,416
In what regard?

1213
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:43,625
In any regard.

1214
02:00:43,875 --> 02:00:46,291
I have achieved that
which my father never could.

1215
02:00:46,875 --> 02:00:49,041
I have united this kingdom
in common cause.

1216
02:00:49,541 --> 02:00:50,375
Hmm.

1217
02:00:52,541 --> 02:00:55,291
You have achieved momentary respite.

1218
02:00:56,541 --> 02:00:58,416
A unity forged under false pretense

1219
02:00:58,500 --> 02:01:00,708
will never be a unity that prevails.

1220
02:01:01,041 --> 02:01:04,291
How, pray, have my endeavors
been forged falsely?

1221
02:01:07,041 --> 02:01:09,166
Why did you bring war to France?

1222
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:11,208
Your father came on spoiling.

1223
02:01:12,041 --> 02:01:14,166
How so? How was he spoiling?

1224
02:01:15,416 --> 02:01:16,791
He sent an assassin.

1225
02:01:17,375 --> 02:01:18,875
There was no assassin.

1226
02:01:19,541 --> 02:01:21,041
There was no plot to kill you.

1227
02:01:24,875 --> 02:01:25,875
How might you know?

1228
02:01:26,958 --> 02:01:30,208
Because I was with my father
when he received word of your charge.

1229
02:01:30,625 --> 02:01:33,500
I know him well enough
to know his reaction to be genuine.

1230
02:01:36,208 --> 02:01:37,416
How was his reaction?

1231
02:01:38,375 --> 02:01:39,541
He laughed.

1232
02:01:40,833 --> 02:01:43,208
He laughed very much.
He said you must be drunk.

1233
02:01:44,208 --> 02:01:45,750
Your father is a madman.

1234
02:01:46,541 --> 02:01:48,541
He may be mad, but he is true.

1235
02:01:49,250 --> 02:01:52,291
His madness makes him true.
He says only what he believes.

1236
02:01:53,083 --> 02:01:54,666
That is why he is loved.

1237
02:01:56,916 --> 02:01:58,875
The assassin then
was sent by your brother.

1238
02:01:58,958 --> 02:01:59,833
- My brother?
- Mm-hmm.

1239
02:01:59,916 --> 02:02:02,083
My brother was too stupid
to conjure such a plan.

1240
02:02:04,125 --> 02:02:05,500
What was your true reason?

1241
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:07,875
Did you know of the ball he sent?

1242
02:02:10,166 --> 02:02:11,750
The ball he sent to me?

1243
02:02:15,625 --> 02:02:16,541
A ball?

1244
02:02:19,833 --> 02:02:20,958
He sent to you...

1245
02:02:21,958 --> 02:02:24,333
- a ball?
- Why should you question my intent?

1246
02:02:25,291 --> 02:02:28,666
Your father's rule is illegitimate.
He has no right claim to his throne.

1247
02:02:28,750 --> 02:02:30,750
All monarchy is illegitimate.

1248
02:02:31,625 --> 02:02:33,791
You yourself are the son of a usurper.

1249
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:46,250
It would seem that you have no explanation
for what you have done.

1250
02:02:48,041 --> 02:02:51,125
You have shed the blood
of so many Christian souls, and yet...

1251
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,875
before me now, all I see is a...

1252
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,458
Young and vain and foolish man

1253
02:02:58,541 --> 02:03:00,000
so easily riled.

1254
02:03:03,333 --> 02:03:04,875
So easily beguiled.

1255
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,500
I must leave you now.

1256
02:03:28,625 --> 02:03:29,666
Gentle.

1257
02:03:39,500 --> 02:03:40,500
Ah.

1258
02:03:44,583 --> 02:03:48,041
We must be sure to revel in this day,
my friend.

1259
02:03:49,541 --> 02:03:53,208
A crowd has gathered
in honor of our victory.

1260
02:03:55,083 --> 02:03:57,500
These are the rare moments
for which a king truly lives,

1261
02:03:57,583 --> 02:03:58,916
I would imagine.

1262
02:04:01,875 --> 02:04:03,833
In all my preoccupation, I have...

1263
02:04:04,416 --> 02:04:06,541
neglected to ask after your family.

1264
02:04:07,083 --> 02:04:07,916
Oh.

1265
02:04:08,583 --> 02:04:11,416
Your preoccupations are hardly trifling.

1266
02:04:12,375 --> 02:04:13,541
You have two sons.

1267
02:04:14,166 --> 02:04:15,000
I do.

1268
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:17,583
And...

1269
02:04:18,458 --> 02:04:20,916
your wife minds your estate
in your absence.

1270
02:04:21,666 --> 02:04:22,666
She does.

1271
02:04:26,666 --> 02:04:27,708
Yours is sheep.

1272
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:31,083
You're a man of wool.

1273
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,666
As was my father before me.

1274
02:04:35,166 --> 02:04:36,375
How many head?

1275
02:04:37,375 --> 02:04:41,666
At last count, some 4,000.
Mostly Dorset Horns.

1276
02:04:45,541 --> 02:04:46,833
How much land have you?

1277
02:04:47,916 --> 02:04:48,750
Oh.

1278
02:04:49,958 --> 02:04:51,791
To be true, I'm not...

1279
02:04:52,875 --> 02:04:54,333
wholly certain, but...

1280
02:04:55,125 --> 02:04:56,083
but many...

1281
02:04:56,166 --> 02:04:58,750
many hundreds
of beautiful, beautiful acres.

1282
02:05:07,458 --> 02:05:09,958
What lands in France have you now annexed?

1283
02:05:12,583 --> 02:05:13,458
Stop.

1284
02:05:16,333 --> 02:05:17,166
Hmm?

1285
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:20,416
Now that France is ours,
how much of her land is now yours?

1286
02:05:23,166 --> 02:05:24,125
Oh, well...

1287
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,250
That has yet to be determined.

1288
02:05:27,791 --> 02:05:29,583
Your conquest is so recent.

1289
02:05:31,041 --> 02:05:33,833
- Why do you ask this question...
- Stay up there.

1290
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:36,458
- Hmm?
- Stay up there.

1291
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:45,625
Oh.

1292
02:05:55,958 --> 02:05:57,791
How did my assassin come to you?

1293
02:06:02,333 --> 02:06:04,041
I fail to remember the moment.

1294
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,250
Remedy this failure.

1295
02:06:10,375 --> 02:06:12,958
So much has happened
in the intervening months.

1296
02:06:13,041 --> 02:06:14,500
An event as pivotal as this one

1297
02:06:14,583 --> 02:06:17,916
should be amply equipped
to penetrate the fog of time elapsed.

1298
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:19,333
No?

1299
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:21,416
Of course.

1300
02:06:23,333 --> 02:06:24,583
Let me recall.

1301
02:06:29,625 --> 02:06:30,958
Was it in the street?

1302
02:06:33,166 --> 02:06:34,833
Did he come to you in the street?

1303
02:06:35,958 --> 02:06:37,750
Yes. Yes, it was in the street.

1304
02:06:37,833 --> 02:06:39,750
He approached me...

1305
02:06:39,833 --> 02:06:41,541
Most unusually.

1306
02:06:42,041 --> 02:06:45,583
My liege, please, tell me
the cause of this concern.

1307
02:06:45,666 --> 02:06:46,750
Stay up there.

1308
02:06:50,041 --> 02:06:51,250
Stay up there.

1309
02:07:02,791 --> 02:07:03,958
Did he know your name?

1310
02:07:05,708 --> 02:07:06,833
I don't believe he did.

1311
02:07:06,916 --> 02:07:09,541
How, then, did he know
who you were to approach?

1312
02:07:14,500 --> 02:07:15,333
Ah.

1313
02:07:17,666 --> 02:07:19,250
The memory is returning.

1314
02:07:22,791 --> 02:07:25,041
He surrendered himself to palace guards

1315
02:07:25,125 --> 02:07:27,041
and the matter
was brought to my attention.

1316
02:07:27,125 --> 02:07:28,666
I was taken to him.

1317
02:07:28,916 --> 02:07:30,500
So, he did not come to you in the street.

1318
02:07:30,583 --> 02:07:33,541
No. No, it was not in the street.
Forgive me.

1319
02:07:33,916 --> 02:07:35,583
I was summoned to his cell.

1320
02:07:43,041 --> 02:07:45,416
Has a problem arisen...

1321
02:07:46,750 --> 02:07:47,750
Hal?

1322
02:07:48,083 --> 02:07:48,916
Yes.

1323
02:07:49,458 --> 02:07:50,583
A problem has arisen.

1324
02:07:51,333 --> 02:07:54,208
And it wobbles before me now
on its silly little stool

1325
02:07:54,291 --> 02:07:56,791
- at mine own elevation.
- I'm afraid I don't understand.

1326
02:07:56,875 --> 02:08:00,000
- Please, please, stop this charade.
- Sincerely, I do not understand.

1327
02:08:00,083 --> 02:08:02,125
Stop the fucking charade!

1328
02:08:02,208 --> 02:08:03,041
Stop it!

1329
02:08:03,125 --> 02:08:05,708
I have given you
what you wanted, boy!

1330
02:08:07,083 --> 02:08:08,250
Have I not?!

1331
02:08:13,916 --> 02:08:14,916
Mm.

1332
02:08:16,583 --> 02:08:17,416
Mm.

1333
02:08:29,625 --> 02:08:31,458
You wanted peace.

1334
02:08:31,916 --> 02:08:32,875
Did you not?!

1335
02:08:39,166 --> 02:08:41,125
This is how peace is forged.

1336
02:08:42,958 --> 02:08:45,583
It is forged in victory.

1337
02:08:47,416 --> 02:08:48,250
Listen.

1338
02:08:55,625 --> 02:08:57,583
That is the sound of peace.

1339
02:09:02,500 --> 02:09:04,416
That is the sound of your peace.

1340
02:09:14,208 --> 02:09:17,250
That is the sound of your greatness.

1341
02:09:20,583 --> 02:09:21,416
Hmm?

1342
02:09:59,666 --> 02:10:01,041
- My liege.
- My liege.

1343
02:10:01,500 --> 02:10:02,541
My liege.

1344
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,666
I ask nothing of you...

1345
02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:27,333
only that you will always
speak to me clear and true.

1346
02:10:28,666 --> 02:10:29,541
Always.

1347
02:10:33,041 --> 02:10:34,916
Will you promise me only that?

1348
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,875
Long live the King!

1349
02:10:37,250 --> 02:10:39,250
- Long live the King!
- I will.

1350
02:10:40,583 --> 02:10:41,875
Long live the King!

1351
02:10:44,083 --> 02:10:45,750
Long live the King!

1352
02:10:45,833 --> 02:10:47,958
Long live the King!

1353
02:10:49,916 --> 02:10:51,583
King Henry!

1354
02:10:51,666 --> 02:10:53,791
King Henry!

1355
02:10:53,875 --> 02:10:55,458
King Henry!

1356
02:10:56,125 --> 02:10:57,625
King Henry!

1357
02:10:58,416 --> 02:10:59,833
King Henry!

1358
02:11:00,583 --> 02:11:02,000
King Henry!

1359
02:11:02,791 --> 02:11:04,250
King Henry!

1360
02:11:04,958 --> 02:11:06,458
King Henry!

1361
02:11:07,250 --> 02:11:08,750
King Henry!
