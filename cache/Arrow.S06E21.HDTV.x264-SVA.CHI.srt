no matter what
our feelings are about Oliver,

to go to prison.

I'm not the Green Arrow.

104
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,153
There appears to be
a fair amount of evidence

00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,889

mayor is guilty.

What evidence?

107
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,292
That photo from several months ago,
that was doctored.

Oliver Queen is a hero.

156
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:48,939
He is.

157
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:49,905
He's saved this city

158
00:06:49,906 --> 00:06:51,839
more times
than anybody can count,

159
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:55,476
but he's done it all
from behind a mask

160
00:06:55,477 --> 00:06:59,612
so that he could take
the law into his own hands.

161
00:06:59,614 --> 00:07:03,283
In fact, he's taken
as many lives as he's saved.

162
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:06,286
So, yes, Oliver Queen
is a hero,

163
00:07:06,288 --> 00:07:09,789
but that doesn't mean he's
not also a criminal.

164
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,179
<b><font color="#FF0080">Jean:</font></b> 3 weeks ago,

165
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,081
Oliver Queen was mayor
of this city.

166
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:22,385
In that time, he has gone
from being under indictment

167
00:07:22,387 --> 00:07:25,789
to impeachment
to being on trial.

168
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:30,527
How? How could everything
go wrong so quickly for him?

169
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:32,896
I think intuitively you know
the answer.

170
00:07:32,898 --> 00:07:37,701
Corruption. It runs through
this city like a cancer,

171
00:07:37,703 --> 00:07:41,104
compromising some city officials
while discrediting others,

172
00:07:41,106 --> 00:07:44,174
like...like the defendant.

173
00:07:44,176 --> 00:07:47,511
Even the anti-vigilante law that
he's being charged under is

174
00:07:47,513 --> 00:07:49,546
the work of the corrupt
men and women

175
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:52,382
who are holding our city
in their grip.

176
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:54,718
This may sound like
a conspiracy theory,

177
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,154
but at the conclusion
of this trial,

178
00:07:57,156 --> 00:08:00,457
I'm going to ask you what is
most likely,

179
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:03,593
that our city's government
has been compromised

180
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:07,964
or that we elected a superhero
as our mayor?

181
00:08:09,535 --> 00:08:12,569
Ms. Van Owen, please
call your first witness.

182
00:08:12,571 --> 00:08:14,905
The people call John Diggle.

183
00:08:18,443 --> 00:08:20,443
Where is he?

184
00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:23,814
A bench warrant will
issue for Mr. Diggle.

185
00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:25,916
If he's not made to
appear within one hour,

186
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:28,819
he'll be held in
contempt of this court.

187
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:30,854
Is your next witness
ready?

188
00:08:30,856 --> 00:08:32,455
Yes, your honor.

189
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:35,120
<b><font color="#D09090">Van Owen:</font></b> Please state
your name and occupation

190
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:36,114
for the record.

191
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,614
Dr. Elisa Schwartz.

192
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:39,216
I'm an attending
physician

193
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,117
at Starling General
Hospital.

194
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,986
Thank you, Dr. Schwartz.

195
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:45,655
And you've had an occasion
to treat the defendant?

196
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:47,324
Yes.

197
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,658
For various suspicious
injuries. Is that correct?

198
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,327
I can't say without
violating

199
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,963
doctor-patient
confidentiality.

200
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,498
I understand.

201
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,233
Then let me direct your
attention, please,

202
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:59,269
to an incident when
Mr. Queen was not a patient.

203
00:08:59,271 --> 00:09:01,505
On the night of
April 6, 2016,

204
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:04,107
the Green Arrow brought in
the Black Canary.

205
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:05,509
And according to your
records,

206
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,143
she had been stabbed.

207
00:09:07,145 --> 00:09:09,446
Objection. Is there
a question in our future?

208
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:12,516
<b><font color="#D09090">Van Owen:</font></b> Yes. That night,
you were close enough

209
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:15,318
to the Green Arrow to
determine his identity.

210
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,356
So my question is, whose
face did you see that night?

211
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,992
I was focused on saving
Ms. Lance's life.

212
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,960
I wasn't the least
bit concerned

213
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:26,296
with who
the Green Arrow was.

214
00:09:26,298 --> 00:09:29,232
Concern or not, whose face did you see
underneath that mask?

215
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:32,135
Well, it's not bad.
Oliver might just pull this one off.

216
00:09:32,137 --> 00:09:34,771
You want to put
money on that?

217
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:37,207
Diaz wants Oliver
in prison.

218
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,009
You think he'd
want to kill him.

219
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,610
I mean, at least try.

220
00:09:40,612 --> 00:09:42,345
What, so the Green Arrow
can become a martyr?

221
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:43,680
<font color="#0CEC0C">[Cell phone vibrates
and rings]</font>

222
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:44,915
Diaz is smarter
than that.

223
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,583
I have to go.

224
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:49,019
Diaz yank your leash?

225
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,387
Something like that.

226
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,556
You know, you don't
have to go.

227
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,591
The first step to
standing up to him

228
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:56,293
is to stand up to him.

229
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,794
Sounds like
the first step

230
00:09:57,796 --> 00:09:59,563
to getting
myself killed.

231
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,698
Not for nothing,
but apart from your face,

232
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,533
there is one thing
you've got in common

233
00:10:03,535 --> 00:10:04,834
with my Laurel.

234
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:06,469
And what's that?

235
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:08,371
Neither of you would let
somebody else tell you

236
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:10,640
what to do or have
you running scared.

237
00:10:10,642 --> 00:10:13,443
You think your Laurel
would stand up to Diaz?

238
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:14,978
I know it.

239
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,480
Well, maybe if she
were a little smarter,

240
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:19,916
she wouldn't have gotten
herself killed.

241
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:28,725
It's been one hour.

242
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:31,261
He is hereby in
contempt of this court.

243
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:34,097
I'm sorry I'm late,
your honor.

244
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:37,734
I had some business to take
care of out of town.

245
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,938
Oliver Queen is not
the Green Arrow.

246
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,474
I can't make it any
plainer than that.

247
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:46,242
How can you be so sure?

248
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:49,546
From 2012-16, I was
his personal bodyguard.

249
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:52,582
If he was running around
with a bow and arrow,

250
00:10:52,584 --> 00:10:54,284
I would've known it.

251
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,452
But would you admit
knowing it?

252
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,187
Why wouldn't I?

253
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:58,955
Because you were aiding
and abetting a vigilante?

254
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:01,157
I absolutely was not.

255
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,159
In fact, I had very limited interaction
with Oliver Queen.

256
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:04,728
How can that be?

257
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,363
You were head of his
security at city hall.

258
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,531
And my job was to keep
him safe.

259
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:11,434
And that included not
jumping off of rooftops.

260
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:13,903
Well, Mr. Diggle, you can't
even keep yourself safe.

261
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:15,805
I mean, in the past 4 years,

262
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:17,374
you've been abducted by
Damien Darhk,

263
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,442
your own child was
also kidnapped.

264
00:11:19,444 --> 00:11:22,078
You were hospitalized
for nerve damage caused

265
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,714
by severe trauma.

266
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:27,717
Mr. Diggle,
either you travel

267
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:31,488
in some very dangerous
circles,

268
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,824
or you have
the worst luck ever.

269
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:36,526
Who was Sean Sonus?

270
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:37,727
<b><font color="#FF0080">Jean:</font></b> Objection. Relevance.

271

- Your honor?

272
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,998
I said, overruled.
Answer the question.

273
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,767
He was a drug dealer
I investigated

274
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,268
while undercover

275
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,103
in the Central City
police department.

276
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:49,939
And he was shot and killed
in Hub City last year.

277
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:52,609
Your honor, I renew my
objection as to relevance.

278
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,010
Well, if Ms. Drake
is a murderer,

279
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:55,445
it would certainly
undermine

280
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:57,113
her credibility,
now, wouldn't it?

281
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:59,883
<b><font color="#D09090">McGarvey:</font></b>
Objection overruled again.

282
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,985
Again.
Sit down, Ms. Loring.

283
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,521
<b><font color="#D09090">Van Owen:</font></b> So you were not
with the Central City police department

285
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,524
Is that correct?

286
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,359
- That's right.

Your honor!

Answer the question.

289
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:20,470
I'm exercising my
fifth amendment right

against
self-incrimination.

291

You beckoned?

292
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:38,822
I saw something
interesting on TV.

293
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:43,359
And I'll testify to it
if they subpoena me.

294
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:45,528
Is there a problem?

295
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,732
Not yet,
there isn't.

296
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,734
You know, this would move
a lot faster

297
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,236
if you would stop
talking in circles.

298
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:56,172
You were given the
gift-wrapped opportunity

299
00:12:56,174 --> 00:13:00,677
to say that Oliver Queen
was the Green Arrow.

300
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,414
You didn't do it,
baby.

301
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,849
I was unaware
I was supposed to.

302
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:08,510
Well, that's why
we're here

303
00:13:08,512 --> 00:13:10,879
having this
little meeting,

304
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:13,215
so we can set
expectations.

305
00:13:13,217 --> 00:13:15,550
The prosecution
is holding you

306
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:17,552
as a rebuttal
witness.

307
00:13:17,554 --> 00:13:19,521
So when they call you,

308
00:13:19,523 --> 00:13:21,890
you're gonna be
the final nail in the coffin.

309
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:24,593
If I go in and try
and convince a courtroom

310
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:29,431
that I'm Laurel Lance,
I'm gonna get made.

311
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,233
Maybe you're right.

312
00:13:32,803 --> 00:13:35,637
You don't have
a poker face.

313
00:13:37,941 --> 00:13:40,876
For example...

314
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:44,313
The way you've been
acting lately, hmm?

315
00:13:44,315 --> 00:13:46,415
Ever since I torched
Fredericco

316
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:48,450
on that rooftop,

317
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:52,254
you've been keeping
your distance from me.

318
00:13:52,256 --> 00:13:55,157
I don't know what
you're talking about.

319
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:57,859
It's ok.

320
00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:01,763
You're ok.

321
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,268
I just want to be
a little clearer.

322
00:14:08,772 --> 00:14:11,773
When you take
the stand,

323
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:13,575
I want you to give
the jury

324
00:14:13,577 --> 00:14:16,278
a much better
performance

325
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,281
than the one
you're giving me.

326
00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:21,817
You know what I'm
talking about now?

327
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:27,689
Good.
That's a good girl.

00:14:32,963 --> 00:14:36,131
Got to go
to the courthouse.

330
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,006
It's not going
too good, is it?

331
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:47,042
Hey. No, it's going fine.
It's fine.

332
00:14:47,044 --> 00:14:48,877
That was just
the prosecution's turn.

333
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,047
So when it's our turn, we're
gonna kick some major ass.

334
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:53,615
That's a legal term.

335
00:14:53,617 --> 00:14:56,318
Why don't you go and get
yourself something

336
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,986
that's not too unhealthy

337
00:14:57,988 --> 00:14:59,521
from
the vending machine, ok?

338
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,723
Ok.

339
00:15:04,628 --> 00:15:06,862
What will happen
if Mr. Oliver goes to jail?

340
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,864
He's not going
to jail, Raisa.

341
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,033
He's not
the Green Arrow.

342
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:14,169
I think we both know better.

343
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:20,842
I tanked it.
I tanked it.

344
00:15:20,844 --> 00:15:22,377
I did exactly
what you said not to do.

345
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,246
The lawyer's
good, D.

346
00:15:24,248 --> 00:15:26,148
Don't worry.
I'll bring it home.

347
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,216
How? You got immunity
from the prosecution.

348
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,785
If watching every episode
of "Law & Order" ever

349
00:15:29,787 --> 00:15:31,219
has taught me anything,

350
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,221
it's that you can't
plead the fifth.

351
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,756
If you get cornered and you
refuse to testify,

352
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:36,091
you could go to jail, Rene.

353
00:15:36,093 --> 00:15:38,160
Well, then I'll go
to jail, Hoss.

354
00:15:38,162 --> 00:15:40,595
But I'm not screwing
Oliver over again.

355
00:15:40,597 --> 00:15:42,364
Hey, guys, the clerk
is calling court

356
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:44,366
back into session.

357
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:51,740
I worked in the mayor's
office close to a year,

358
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,542
side by side with
Mr. Queen

359
00:15:53,544 --> 00:15:55,677
every single day.

360
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:57,946
If he was running around
pretending to be

361
00:15:57,948 --> 00:16:00,749
Robin Hood,
I would've known.

362
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,317
And did you know it?

363
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:10,158
Mr. Ramirez?

364
00:16:11,395 --> 00:16:16,465
Mr. Ramirez, did you have
occasion to determine

365
00:16:16,467 --> 00:16:20,569
whether Oliver Queen was
the Green Arrow?

366
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,007
<b><font color="#FF0080">Oliver:</font></b> Rene.

367

368

371

Yeah.

And as a member

375

Yeah.

376

How many people did he
kill or maim?

That's right. I don't care.

Whatever it takes

How about taking on
the entire police force?

How does that sound

You want us to
light 'em up, boss?

If they had
an accident

406
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:23,184
I'd have to testify,
and it'd be awkward.

Hey.

Ok. Is this as bad
as it looks?

410
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:39,200
Arguably worse.

411
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,336
Can--can we prove

412
00:18:41,338 --> 00:18:44,239
that, uh, Diaz was putting
pressure on Rene?

413
00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:45,840
No, no, no.

414
00:18:45,842 --> 00:18:48,343
I mean, even assuming
we could, the jury has

415
00:18:48,345 --> 00:18:51,112
no idea
who Ricardo Diaz is.

416
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:53,915
Conventional wisdom says
you never ask a client

417
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:56,117
if they are guilty
because the more I know,

418
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,986
the more it might tie
my hands,

419
00:18:57,988 --> 00:19:01,256
but I am gonna ask.

420
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:05,059
Are you the Green Arrow?

421
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,229
Yes.

422
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:14,969
Then I'm gonna propose
a new strategy.

423
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:16,304
Ok.

424
00:19:16,306 --> 00:19:17,972
- Jury nullification.
- Hmm?

425
00:19:17,974 --> 00:19:20,108
You're going to admit to
being the Green Arrow.

426
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,776
We are then going
to highlight

427
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:23,811
every single thing you
have done for this city,

428
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:25,713
all the times you have
saved it.

429
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:28,750
We will argue you do not
deserve to go to prison.

430
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:33,755
This is a legitimate
chance, Oliver.

431
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:35,490
Why not?

432
00:19:35,492 --> 00:19:37,325
I'd be putting a target
on my back,

433
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:39,093
I'd be putting a target

434

on my wife and son's back.

435

for 6 years.

436

I didn't plan on doing it
forever.

437
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:51,272
I thought that one day,
my mission would end

438
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:54,342
and I would finally,
after all this time,

439
00:19:54,344 --> 00:19:57,845
get a chance to actually
live my life.

440
00:19:59,182 --> 00:20:02,116
That will never happen...

441
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:08,523

that I'm the Green Arrow.

to testify.

to call you.

something planned.

to take the chance.

00:21:11,254 --> 00:21:13,221
Fine, but make it quick.

469
00:21:13,223 --> 00:21:16,891
Ms. Smoak, this appears
to be a photograph

470
00:21:16,893 --> 00:21:19,494
of your husband,
Oliver Queen,

471
00:21:19,496 --> 00:21:21,262
dressed as
the Green Arrow.

472
00:21:21,264 --> 00:21:24,232
Yes. The key words
being "appears to be."

473
00:21:24,234 --> 00:21:25,800
This photo
has been doctored.

474
00:21:25,802 --> 00:21:27,502
A pixel level analysis
will show

475
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:29,504
almost undetectable
light shifts

476
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:31,572
and resolution
inconsistencies

477
00:21:31,574 --> 00:21:33,675
that would not be present
in a natural photo.

478
00:21:33,677 --> 00:21:35,043
<b><font color="#D09090">Van Owen:</font></b>
Objection, your honor.

479
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:36,577
What is the point
of showing us

480
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:38,246
an allegedly doctored
photograph at all?

481
00:21:38,248 --> 00:21:40,081
The better question
would be who,

482
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,883
and why would they
doctor a photo

483
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:43,484
to make Oliver Queen look
like the Green Arrow

484
00:21:43,486 --> 00:21:45,520
if he were the Green Arrow?

485
00:21:45,522 --> 00:21:48,589
I mean, which he's not. He's
my husband. I would know.

486
00:21:48,591 --> 00:21:50,792
<b><font color="#FF0080">Jean:</font></b>
No further questions.

487
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,262
When was Mr. Queen arrested?

488
00:21:54,264 --> 00:21:56,297
November 21, 2017.

489
00:21:56,299 --> 00:21:57,732
And when were
the two of you married?

490
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:58,966
November 28th.

491
00:21:58,968 --> 00:22:01,035
- Just a week later.
- Yes.

492
00:22:01,037 --> 00:22:02,603
Is it possible that you
rushed the wedding

493
00:22:02,605 --> 00:22:04,739
so that you could claim
spousal privilege

494
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,542
just in case you had to
testify against Mr. Queen?

495
00:22:07,544 --> 00:22:10,745
I have been in love
with Oliver for 6 years.

496
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,580
Trust me, it felt
anything but rushed.

497
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:14,615
<b><font color="#D09090">Van Owen:</font></b>
Let's change the topic.

498
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:16,417
Your father's Noah Kuttler,
the alleged Calculator.

499
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:18,252
- Objection.
- Overruled.

500
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,487
He's reformed.

501
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:20,988
But before he was,

502
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,657
did you know that he was

503
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:24,659
a notorious computer hacker
and cyber criminal?

504
00:22:24,661 --> 00:22:26,461
No. I had no idea.

505
00:22:26,463 --> 00:22:28,229
Doesn't say much about your
ability to see criminality

506
00:22:28,231 --> 00:22:29,831
in people close to you,
does it?

507
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,666
I w--

508
00:22:31,668 --> 00:22:34,001
And under the heading
"apples falling from trees,"

509
00:22:34,003 --> 00:22:36,304
have you yourself ever
engaged in cyber crime?

510
00:22:36,306 --> 00:22:38,339
No, I haven't.

511
00:22:38,341 --> 00:22:41,943
Good luck proving
otherwise, Ms. Van Owen.

512
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:45,780
Roy Harper is not
a vigilante.

513
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:48,149
He sacrificed himself
to protect the identity

514
00:22:48,151 --> 00:22:50,952
of a man that the city
at the time

515
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:54,355
referred to as the Hood
or the Arrow.

516
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:56,391
I've since come to learn
that the Green Arrow is

517
00:22:56,393 --> 00:22:57,992
the same person.

518
00:22:57,994 --> 00:22:59,360
But that's not you.

519
00:22:59,362 --> 00:23:01,062
It's absolutely not me.

520
00:23:01,064 --> 00:23:02,764
And do you know who it is?

521
00:23:02,766 --> 00:23:06,701
Yes, I do, but I will not
reveal his identity...

522
00:23:07,871 --> 00:23:10,138
Not even if it sends
me to prison.

523
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,807
Pass the witness.

524
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,509
Well, that's convenient.

525
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:15,977
You're not the Green Arrow.

526
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:17,512
You know who is
the Green Arrow,

527
00:23:17,514 --> 00:23:19,046
but you're not saying.

528
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:20,948
Well, I keep my promises,
Ms. Van Owen.

529
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,884
When did you meet
this mystery man?

530
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:24,485
Shortly after I returned
to Star City.

531
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:26,387
As you know, I was
marooned for 5 years

532
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:28,890
on an island named Lian Yu.

533
00:23:28,892 --> 00:23:30,658
This photograph was taken
during that 5-year period.

534
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,160
I'm just curious.

535
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:34,328
Why does Lian Yu look
a lot like Russia?

536
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,164
- Objection.
- Overruled.

537
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,999
<b><font color="#D09090">Van Owen:</font></b>
We obtained this photograph

538
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,401
from a reporter by the name
of Susan Williams.

539
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,005
I have not been
entirely forthcoming

540
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:48,209
about that period of time
in my life.

541
00:23:48,211 --> 00:23:51,646
Parts of it were spent
in Hong Kong,

542
00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:54,715
and, yes, parts of it
were spent in Russia.

543
00:23:54,717 --> 00:23:59,821
So you lied repeatedly
and publicly.

544
00:23:59,823 --> 00:24:02,490
You lied about being on
Lian Yu,

545
00:24:02,492 --> 00:24:04,859
and you lied about
5 years of your life,

546
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:07,495
which begs the question,
Mr. Queen,

547
00:24:07,497 --> 00:24:10,131
what else have you lied about
lied about?

556
00:24:42,483 --> 00:24:44,082
That night,
my father destroyed

557

a large portion
of the city.

558

With the heightened
scrutiny on my family,

559
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:50,655
I took the opportunity
to fake my own death

560
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:53,258
to protect my identity
as the Hood.

561
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:57,662
Three years ago, Roy Harper
confessed to being the Hood.

562
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,264
To protect me.

563
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:02,901
And then he was
attacked in prison.

564
00:25:02,903 --> 00:25:09,107
I have lived with
that guilt for 3 years.

565
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:12,277
I am not about to let
Oliver take the blame

566
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:14,079
for me the same way
that Roy did.

567
00:25:14,081 --> 00:25:16,681
And that's why
I'm here--

568
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:18,717
to set the record
straight.

Thank you. Your witness.

570
00:25:24,424 --> 00:25:27,692
If you're the Green Arrow,
how come Rene Ramirez

571
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:30,762
testified under oath
that Oliver Queen is?

572
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:34,332
Well, I would suspect that
he was being pressured to.

573
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:35,867
Are you saying he
perjured himself?

574
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:37,969
Well, I don't know.
I'm not a lawyer.

575
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:40,305
I'm just

Hey, I think I bought
you a perjury charge back there, Rene.

615

A small price to pay

At the very least,

00:27:48,268 --> 00:27:50,368
to take the chance of
lying, that was a pun.

623
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,903
I don't do puns.

624
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:53,271
Well, that was
Christopher Chance

625
00:27:53,273 --> 00:27:54,906
I did just see in
there, right?

626
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:56,341
Yes. I'm sorry that I
couldn't loop you in.

627
00:27:56,343 --> 00:27:57,909
We had officer Parks
listening

628
00:27:57,911 --> 00:28:00,045
to every word that
we said, and I...

629
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:08,787
I didn't know Chance was
gonna use Tommy's face.

630
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:10,021
Well, yeah, I mean,
I guess they were thinking,

631
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:11,856
"What's more compelling

632
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:13,825
than a testimony from
a dead guy," right?

633
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:17,028
Excuse me.

634
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,764
- Mr. Mayor.
- We've got a problem.

635

Chance just saved our bacon.

636
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:22,834
Laurel told me.

637
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:24,669
She also told me
that Diaz is making

638
00:28:24,671 --> 00:28:26,671
her testify as
a rebuttal witness.

639
00:28:26,673 --> 00:28:29,007
He's sending her
in there

640
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:31,309
with Chance's
entire CIA file.

641
00:28:31,311 --> 00:28:34,212
She will be telling
the jury everything

642
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:37,349
about what you guys
just pulled in there,

643
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:39,050
or Diaz is going
to kill her.

644
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:42,387
<b><font color="#FF0080">Felicity:</font></b> How does Diaz
even know about Chance?

645
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,522
Because Diaz has access
to everything

646
00:28:44,524 --> 00:28:46,825
that Cayden James learned
from his...

647
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:50,762
It's the bug in the bunker.

648
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:53,264
I'm sorry, Oliver.

649
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:54,733
We'll think of something.

650
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:57,035
I'll give you guys
some room.

651
00:29:02,442 --> 00:29:04,843
Ok. Ok. So...

652
00:29:06,313 --> 00:29:09,214
Ok, what's the something
that we're gonna think of?

653
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:11,149
Jean suggested that I just
admit I'm the Green Arrow

654
00:29:11,151 --> 00:29:12,817
and we go for some sort
of jury nullification,

655
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:14,886
but I explained to her
that I would like

656
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:18,089
to have a life after
being the Green Arrow,

657
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:20,358
but, more
importantly, I...

658
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,660
I cannot put a target
on you and William.

659
00:29:22,662 --> 00:29:24,295
Let me worry
about me and William.

660
00:29:24,297 --> 00:29:25,864
Let me at least

661
00:29:25,866 --> 00:29:28,233
take that off your plate.

662
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:30,268
That's not
how wedding vows work.

663
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,004
Well, we didn't
exchange vows.

664
00:29:33,006 --> 00:29:36,241
But if we did, exchange
means "goes both ways."

665
00:29:36,243 --> 00:29:40,211
So we fight for
each other, Oliver.

666
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:42,480
We protect each other.

667
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:45,717
We're gonna save each other.

668
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:47,685
I can't save anyone
from behind bars.

669
00:29:47,687 --> 00:29:49,187
We'll get you out,
just like we got John out.

670
00:29:49,189 --> 00:29:51,122
I could break out of
prison, Felicity,

671
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:53,091
but then what,
you know?

672
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:57,095
I--I'm not abandoning
the two of you.

673
00:29:57,097 --> 00:29:59,063
I can't make the two
of you fugitives.

674
00:29:59,065 --> 00:30:00,565
Oh, we're gonna be ok.

675
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:02,200
John and I have been
talking,

676
00:30:02,202 --> 00:30:06,571
and, uh, if I go
to prison, I need...

677
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:09,274
You and William
to go

678
00:30:09,276 --> 00:30:11,009
into A.R.G.U.S.
protective custody.

679
00:30:11,011 --> 00:30:12,744
Oliver...

680
00:30:14,915 --> 00:30:16,481
We're not...

681
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,416
We're not there yet.

682
00:30:18,418 --> 00:30:22,821
We cannot live in
denial, all right?

683
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:24,989
We have to have a plan.

684
00:30:26,793 --> 00:30:29,194
I can handle
losing my freedom.

685
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:34,766
I cannot handle losing
you and William.

686
00:30:49,592 --> 00:30:51,192
I solemnly affirm
to tell the truth,

687
00:30:51,194 --> 00:30:53,511
the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth.

as the Black Canary.

a known associate of
the Green Arrow,

is it fair to say you know

we heard Rene Ramirez testify

the Green Arrow, but a man
calling himself Tommy Merlyn

it fell upon you, the jury,

to sort out what he deemed
to be "a mess."

735
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:07,864
True, we have contradicting
witnesses.

736
00:33:07,866 --> 00:33:11,067
And, yes, we have
conflicting testimonies,

737
00:33:11,069 --> 00:33:13,703
but that is not a mess,
ladies and gentlemen.

738

That is the textbook definition
of reasonable doubt.

739
00:33:27,385 --> 00:33:30,887
15 minutes after being taken
into custody, Tommy Merlyn

740
00:33:30,889 --> 00:33:33,923
was freed by members of
the Green Arrow's team.

741
00:33:33,925 --> 00:33:36,225
Now, you might take that
as evidence

742
00:33:36,227 --> 00:33:38,428
that he is, in fact,
the Green Arrow,

743
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,129
but I would like to offer you

744
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:42,698
a much more
plausible explanation,

745
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,236
and that is Oliver Queen
has people and resources

746
00:33:47,238 --> 00:33:51,240
at his disposal to do whatever
it takes to keep his secrets.

747
00:33:51,242 --> 00:33:53,042
And don't think that
doesn't mean

748
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:56,212
someone falling out of the sky
into this courtroom

749
00:33:56,214 --> 00:33:58,548
with a false face
and a made-up story.

750
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:02,285
Because Tommy Merlyn is
just another Roy Harper.

751
00:34:02,287 --> 00:34:06,155
He's just another man
willing to go to prison

752
00:34:06,157 --> 00:34:09,258
to cover up the crimes that
that man committed.

753

Don't let him get away with it.

What do you mean?

766
00:34:51,636 --> 00:34:54,570
I mean that the man who
wants me in prison

767
00:34:54,572 --> 00:34:56,706
controls the judge,

768
00:34:56,708 --> 00:35:00,309
and we think it's a pretty
good bet that he has

769
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:03,179
a strong influence
over the jury.

770
00:35:03,181 --> 00:35:05,181
What does that mean?

771
00:35:05,183 --> 00:35:09,685
It means I might be
going to prison, ok?

772
00:35:09,687 --> 00:35:17,126
If that happens, Felicity
has assured me that she

773
00:35:17,128 --> 00:35:21,764
is going to make sure
you grow into the man

774
00:35:21,766 --> 00:35:23,533
that I know you can be.

775
00:35:23,535 --> 00:35:25,067
I don't want you to go.

776
00:35:25,069 --> 00:35:27,436
I don't want to go either.

777
00:35:28,673 --> 00:35:30,840
