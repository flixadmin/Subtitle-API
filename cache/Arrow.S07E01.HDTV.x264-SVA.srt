aiding and abetting these acts

334
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:09,676
You really have to ask me that?

335
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,295
You done giving your statement?

deal and saves my ass.

338
00:17:16,596 --> 00:17:18,570
If you ask me, you should
be helping this guy,

339

not hunting him down,

340
00:17:20,065 --> 00:17:22,070
especially with Diaz still out there.

341
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:23,632
Diaz has been gone for months,

342
00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:25,289
and the FBI still has its eye on us.

343

So as much as I doubt
Laurel's motives...

344
00:17:27,753 --> 00:17:29,609
And, uh, believe me, I do...

345
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:31,703
Taking a hard-line
stance was the right play,

346
00:17:31,706 --> 00:17:34,319
because if Agent Watson
even so much as suspects

347
00:17:34,322 --> 00:17:35,579
we have something to do with this...

348
00:17:35,581 --> 00:17:37,078
Our immunity goes adios.

349
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:38,915
That's right. And that's
why we have got to find

350
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:41,414
this Green Arrow wannabe
and shut him down.

351
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:44,804
Rene, we all agreed,
for better or for worse,

352
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:46,516
we were not gonna go out as Vigilantes.

353
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,710
Otherwise, what was
Oliver's sacrifice for?

354
00:17:48,713 --> 00:17:50,930
Ok, so we're supposed to just ignore

355
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:53,007
the rising crime rate
and do nothing about it?

356
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,759
Actually, I think risking
my officers every day

357
00:17:55,762 --> 00:17:57,250
fighting to maintain law and order is

358
00:17:57,253 --> 00:17:58,648
doing something about it.

359
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:00,818
I... I get that, D.,

360
00:18:00,821 --> 00:18:03,768
but Oliver asked us to carry on.

361
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,045
So whoever's behind that mask is doing

362
00:18:06,047 --> 00:18:07,796
what we're supposed to be doing.

363
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:09,757
But he's not helping the problem.

364
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:12,018
Actually, he's making it worse.

365
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,779
Rene, I'm not saying

366
00:18:14,781 --> 00:18:16,947
that we can't still
be heroes to this city.

367
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,190
We just have to do it in a
little bit of a different way.

368
00:18:22,196 --> 00:18:24,605
So where you at finding this wannabe?

369
00:18:24,607 --> 00:18:27,299
Well, we retrieved a few
arrows from the scene,

370
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:28,986
but forensics still turned up empty.

371
00:18:28,989 --> 00:18:30,065
But what about the perp?

372
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,916
Any pattern as to how
he's selecting his targets?

373
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:35,382
This weapons dealer has
a rap sheet 12 feet long.

374
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:36,596
He was an obvious mark.

375
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:38,313
But this first guy... Stent...

376
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:40,983
I still haven't figured out
how he fits into the puzzle.

377
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,205
You don't think he's innocent.

378
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,838
This guy? Hell, no.

379
00:18:43,841 --> 00:18:45,337
But his rap sheet's only clean

380
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,035
because he paid to make sure it was.

381
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:48,293
Well, it looks like
you might have to take

382
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,845
a deep dive through his financials.

383
00:18:49,848 --> 00:18:51,174
Yeah. But I can't exactly

been making his money.

What kind of dumbass leaves his
entire criminal enterprise online?

412
00:19:46,193 --> 00:19:48,026
He was actually pretty smart about it.

413
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:49,869
He kept himself clean, off the radar,

414

series of shell corporations.

weapons, Medina sold them.

on who this might be?
