1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I am the fastest man alive.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
After defeating Zoom
and saving the multiverse,

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I ran back in time and created

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I restored the timeline to how it was,

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
only to find things weren't as I left them.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I brought new threats to our world,

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I'm the only one
fast enough to stop them.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,137
I am The Flash.

26
00:00:00,147 --> 00:00:00,974
&nbsp

27
00:00:00,984 --> 00:00:02,390
Previously on "The Flash"...

28
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:02,392
&nbsp

29
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:04,275
They don't see your potential.

30
00:00:04,285 --> 00:00:04,277
&nbsp

31
00:00:04,287 --> 00:00:05,643
I do. You want to train?

32
00:00:05,653 --> 00:00:05,645
&nbsp

33
00:00:05,655 --> 00:00:06,978
I'll train you.

34
00:00:06,988 --> 00:00:06,980
&nbsp

35
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,696
You're Allen's friend, Dr. Snow.

36
00:00:08,706 --> 00:00:08,698
&nbsp

37
00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:10,364
I'm begging you, don't turn her in.

38
00:00:10,374 --> 00:00:10,366
&nbsp

39
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:12,033
I will do anything you want.

40
00:00:12,043 --> 00:00:12,035
&nbsp

41
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,535
Tender your resignation,
effective immediately.

42
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:14,537
&nbsp

43
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,954
It's a story... it used to be
written by Iris West-Allen.

44
00:00:16,964 --> 00:00:16,956
&nbsp

45
00:00:16,966 --> 00:00:18,573
Something's changed with our future.

46
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:18,575
&nbsp

47
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,992
- God, what did I do?
- My brother's dead.

48
00:00:21,002 --> 00:00:20,994
&nbsp

49
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:23,461
Now I'll never make another
memory with Dante again.

50
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:23,463
&nbsp

51
00:00:23,473 --> 00:00:25,630
You're only a man, Flash.

52
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:25,632
&nbsp

53
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:27,164
But I am a god.

54
00:00:27,174 --> 00:00:27,166
&nbsp

55
00:00:27,176 --> 00:00:29,333
I am Savitar.

56
00:00:29,343 --> 00:00:29,335
&nbsp

57
00:00:29,345 --> 00:00:30,801
Now we know Alchemy's just a lackey.

58
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:30,803
&nbsp

59
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:34,505
Julian, become my servant once more.

60
00:00:34,515 --> 00:00:34,507
&nbsp

61
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:36,924
Become Alchemy.

62
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:47,770
&nbsp

63
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,522
It's been six months since
I arrived here in India.

64
00:00:51,532 --> 00:00:51,524
&nbsp

65
00:00:51,534 --> 00:00:54,275
Though I have faith it's out there,

66
00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:54,277
&nbsp

67
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,028
the voice that once drove me has waned.

68
00:00:57,038 --> 00:00:57,030
&nbsp

69
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,364
And I fear my quest may be for naught.

70
00:01:00,374 --> 00:01:00,366
&nbsp

71
00:01:00,376 --> 00:01:02,750
Julian, come quick.

72
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:02,752
&nbsp

73
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:04,001
I think we found it.

74
00:01:04,011 --> 00:01:18,184
&nbsp

75
00:01:18,194 --> 00:01:20,434
This is it. Here, hold this.

76
00:01:20,444 --> 00:01:31,864
&nbsp

77
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:33,230
This is it.

78
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,232
&nbsp

79
00:01:33,242 --> 00:01:34,649
I can feel it.

80
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:34,651
&nbsp

81
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,734
I think we should wait before we open it.

82
00:01:36,744 --> 00:01:39,238
&nbsp

83
00:01:39,248 --> 00:01:40,955
It needs to be set free.

84
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:44,574

&nbsp

87
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,421
Holy winter wonderland.

88
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:57,423
&nbsp

89
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:59,256
Took the words right out of my mouth.

90
00:01:59,266 --> 00:01:59,258
&nbsp

91
00:01:59,268 --> 00:02:03,394
Well, I guess Earth-19's
Christmas is just like ours.

92
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:03,396
&nbsp

93
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:05,930
Some traditions are multi-versal.

94
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:05,932
&nbsp

95
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:07,431
So, um...

96
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:07,433
&nbsp

97
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:09,433
any more info on Savitar?

98
00:02:09,443 --> 00:02:09,435
&nbsp

99
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:11,819
Nope, all the we know
is that he's a speed god

100
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:11,821
&nbsp

101
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,521
and you're the only one who can see him.

102
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:13,523
&nbsp

103
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,607
All right, well, Alchemy is
Savitar's high priest

104
00:02:16,617 --> 00:02:16,609
&nbsp

105
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:18,159
and he gets his power from the stone

106
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:18,161
&nbsp

107
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,361
that he uses to create meta,
so I was thinking

108
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:20,363
&nbsp

109
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,946
if we can find out what that thing is,

110
00:02:21,956 --> 00:02:21,948
&nbsp

111
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,531
maybe we can figure out how to stop him.

112
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:23,533
&nbsp

113
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,783
I want to see if I can dig something up.

114
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:25,785
&nbsp

115
00:02:25,795 --> 00:02:27,585
Okay.

116
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:34,794
&nbsp

117
00:02:34,804 --> 00:02:36,927
I know this is our first
Christmas together as a couple

118
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:36,929
&nbsp

119
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:38,963
and I want everything to be perfect, but...

120
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:38,965
&nbsp

121
00:02:38,975 --> 00:02:40,297
You need to get to this.

122
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:40,299
&nbsp

123
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:41,966
Yes... no, I totally get it.

124
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:41,968
&nbsp

125
00:02:41,978 --> 00:02:45,636
Hey, uh, I got a dissertation
here from Oxford University

126
00:02:45,646 --> 00:02:45,638
&nbsp

127
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:49,023
about the myth of an ancient Hindu weapon

128
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:49,025
&nbsp

129
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,858
- called the Brahmastra.
- Mm-hmm.

130
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:50,860
&nbsp

131
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,311
Legendary artifact with incredible powers,

132
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:54,313
&nbsp

133
00:02:54,323 --> 00:02:56,981
capable of... wait for it...

134
00:02:56,991 --> 00:02:56,983
&nbsp

135
00:02:56,993 --> 00:02:58,315
Creating metas.

136
00:02:58,325 --> 00:02:58,317
&nbsp

137
00:02:58,327 --> 00:02:59,817
Creating meta-humans.

138
00:02:59,827 --> 00:02:59,819
&nbsp

139
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,736
Guys, that looks just like Alchemy's stone.

140
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:01,738
&nbsp

141
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,822
More importantly...

142
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:04,824
&nbsp

143
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:06,457
look who wrote this paper.

144
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:09,662
&nbsp

145
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:13,964
Julian?

146
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:15,835
&nbsp

147
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:17,668
Love what you've done with the place.

148
00:03:17,678 --> 00:03:17,670
&nbsp

149
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,553
Ah, Allen.

150
00:03:19,563 --> 00:03:19,555
&nbsp

151
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:20,838
Thought we had a deal.

152
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:20,840
&nbsp

153
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,390
I keep your frosty friend's secret,

154
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,392
&nbsp

155
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,592
and you never darken
these doors again, remember?

156
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:24,594
&nbsp

157
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,343
I just need some information from you

158
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:26,345
&nbsp

159
00:03:26,355 --> 00:03:29,180
about that stone that Alchemy uses.

160
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,182
&nbsp

161
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:33,017
And you've come to me because?

162
00:03:33,027 --> 00:03:33,019
&nbsp

163
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:35,853
Apparently, you know a lot about it.

164
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:37,657
&nbsp

165
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:40,608
Well, why don't you tell me
everything you know?

166
00:03:40,618 --> 00:03:40,610
&nbsp

167
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,778
And you'll never hear from me again.

168
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:43,780
&nbsp

169
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,530
Fine.

170
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:46,532
&nbsp

171
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:49,417
Many years ago,
I heard about the Brahmastra,

172
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:49,419
&nbsp

173
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,203
or as it's colloquially called,

174
00:03:52,213 --> 00:03:52,205
&nbsp

175
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:54,505
the Philosopher's Stone.

176
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:54,507
&nbsp

177
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:55,923
It is said to be the first object

178
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:55,925
&nbsp

179
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,458
to give human beings powers.

180
00:03:57,468 --> 00:03:57,460
&nbsp

181
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,210
Like the Particle Accelerator.

182
00:03:59,220 --> 00:03:59,212
&nbsp

183
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:01,212
Over the years, it got lost.

184
00:04:01,222 --> 00:04:01,214
&nbsp

185
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:03,848
I became quite obsessed
with trying to find it.

186
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:03,850
&nbsp

187
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,383
Did every piece of
available research I could

188
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:06,385
&nbsp

189
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:10,054
and much to my parents' dismay,
I used my future inheritance

190
00:04:10,064 --> 00:04:10,056
&nbsp

191
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:14,108
and funded an expedition to try and find it.

192
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:14,110
&nbsp

193
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,776
But we never found it.

194
00:04:15,786 --> 00:04:15,778
&nbsp

195
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,562
Pretty soon after that, I came here.

196
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:18,564
&nbsp

197
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:21,115
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.

198
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:21,117
&nbsp

199
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,067
In your research, have you ever come across

200
00:04:23,077 --> 00:04:23,069
&nbsp

201
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,068
the name Savitar?

202
00:04:24,078 --> 00:04:29,292
&nbsp

203
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,908
How do you know that name?

204
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:30,910
&nbsp

205
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,911
I've done some research of my own.

206
00:04:33,921 --> 00:04:33,913
&nbsp

207
00:04:33,923 --> 00:04:37,414
As far as I know, Savitar
is the first meta with speed.

208
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:37,416
&nbsp

209
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:39,917
That's all I know, Allen.

210
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:39,919
&nbsp

211
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:42,670
And I suggest that you don't
waste your time on this.

212
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,307
&nbsp

213
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,006
Move on.

214
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:48,638
&nbsp

215
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:49,839
Alright.

216
00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:54,183
&nbsp

217
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,432
Julian.

218
00:04:55,442 --> 00:05:11,534
&nbsp

219
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,284
Here you go.

220
00:05:13,294 --> 00:05:13,286
&nbsp

221
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:16,120
One whiff of aliens
and all the crazies come out.

222
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:16,122
&nbsp

223
00:05:16,132 --> 00:05:17,955
I'm gonna be buried under these alien files

224
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:17,957
&nbsp

225
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:19,123
until next Christmas.

226
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:19,125
&nbsp

227
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:21,375
Well, if by some Christmas miracle

228
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:21,377
&nbsp

229
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:22,793
you dig yourself out sooner,

230
00:05:22,803 --> 00:05:22,795
&nbsp

231
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:25,763
we do it up at the West house
on Christmas Eve.

232
00:05:25,773 --> 00:05:25,765
&nbsp

233
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:28,349
Turkey, tree, Grandma Esther's eggnog,

234
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:28,351
&nbsp

235
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,467
the whole shebang... and we would
love for you to come.

236
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:30,469
&nbsp

237
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,353
One condition, I bring the nog.

238
00:05:32,363 --> 00:05:32,355
&nbsp

239
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,272
My Grandma Millie's recipe, it
is gonna knock your socks off.

240
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:35,274
&nbsp

241
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:36,473
- Oh, wait a minute.
- Hmm?

242
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:36,475
&nbsp

243
00:05:36,485 --> 00:05:38,475
We gonna have a little nog-off.

244
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:38,477
&nbsp

245
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:39,810
Really?

246
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:39,812
&nbsp

247
00:05:39,822 --> 00:05:41,729
Grandma Esther versus Grandma Millie.

248
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:41,731
&nbsp

249
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:43,864
Oh, you know I love a challenge, Joe West.

250
00:05:43,874 --> 00:05:43,866
&nbsp

251
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,232
May the best grandma win.

252
00:05:45,242 --> 00:05:45,234
&nbsp

253
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:46,567
I am so sorry for your grandma.

254
00:05:46,577 --> 00:05:46,569
&nbsp

255
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:47,618
We'll see.

256
00:05:47,628 --> 00:05:47,620
&nbsp

257
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,320
- Fine.
- Oh, yeah.

258
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:49,322
&nbsp

259
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:51,572
- I'll pick you up, all right?
- Christmas miracle.

260
00:05:51,582 --> 00:06:06,505
&nbsp

261
00:06:06,515 --> 00:06:09,006
I told everyone inside I'd let them live

262
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:09,008
&nbsp

263
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:10,975
if they followed my instructions.

264
00:06:10,985 --> 00:06:10,977
&nbsp

265
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:12,509
But I tricked them.

266
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:12,511
&nbsp

267
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:14,511
Which is so me.

268
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:15,848
&nbsp

269
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:17,181
Give it up, Trickster!

270
00:06:17,191 --> 00:06:17,183
&nbsp

271
00:06:17,193 --> 00:06:19,516
Hiya, Swiftie.

272
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:19,518
&nbsp

273
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:22,486
Will you do me the honor
of allowing me to kill you?

274
00:06:22,496 --> 00:06:27,660
&nbsp

275
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,026
You're out of ammo.

276
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:30,780
&nbsp

277
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,414
But I'm not out of bombs.

278
00:06:33,424 --> 00:06:34,867
&nbsp

279
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:37,534
What do you say we take in
the afterlife, big boy?

280
00:06:37,544 --> 00:06:41,707
&nbsp

281
00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:43,958
- Nice timing.
- You're welcome.

282
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:43,960
&nbsp

283
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,709
There's something wrong with my eyes.

284
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:45,711
&nbsp

285
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:46,710
I'm seeing double.

286
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:46,712
&nbsp

287
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:48,295
The Flash hit me too hard!

288
00:06:48,305 --> 00:06:48,297
&nbsp

289
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,798
I'm gonna sue you, saucer-head!

290
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:50,800
&nbsp

291
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,133
One day, I'll own that helmet,

292
00:06:53,143 --> 00:06:53,135
&nbsp

293
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:56,103
and I'll use it as an ashtray
or a candy dish.

294
00:06:56,113 --> 00:06:56,105
&nbsp

295
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,938
No, wait, a hubcap!

296
00:06:57,948 --> 00:06:57,940
&nbsp

297
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,189
I had that, kid.

298
00:06:59,199 --> 00:06:59,191
&nbsp

299
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:01,058
That's what I always say.

300
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:01,060
&nbsp

301
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,860
Especially when I didn't have it.

302
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,862
&nbsp

303
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:04,945
So I'm assuming you didn't
come all the way to Earth-3

304
00:07:04,955 --> 00:07:04,947
&nbsp

305
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,363
to stop my Trickster.

306
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:06,365
&nbsp

307
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,148
I have something I need to
talk to you about.

308
00:07:08,158 --> 00:07:08,150
&nbsp

309
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,900
A speedster.

310
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:09,902
&nbsp

311
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:11,235
Calls himself Savitar.

312
00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:15,958
&nbsp

313
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:19,660
- So... Savitar.
- Yeah.

314
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,662
&nbsp

315
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,463
Apparently, you've grown powerful enough

316
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:22,465
&nbsp

317
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,664
to challenge him.

318
00:07:23,674 --> 00:07:23,666
&nbsp

319
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:24,882
Who is he?

320
00:07:24,892 --> 00:07:24,884
&nbsp

321
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:26,750
Don't know, never seen him.

322
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:26,752
&nbsp

323
00:07:26,762 --> 00:07:30,254
You're the first speedster
I know of who has.

324
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:30,256
&nbsp

325
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:32,306
But every story I ever heard about Savitar

326
00:07:32,316 --> 00:07:32,308
&nbsp

327
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,925
is basically the same.

328
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:34,927
&nbsp

329
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:38,228
Savitar was the first man
ever granted speed.

330
00:07:38,238 --> 00:07:39,649
&nbsp

331
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,766
And over time, he became the god of motion,

332
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:42,768
&nbsp

333
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:44,435
the fastest of us all.

334
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:47,106
&nbsp

335
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:50,274
Before Savitar graces an Earth
with his presence...

336
00:07:50,284 --> 00:07:52,194
&nbsp

337
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:54,778
He sends a predecessor to
prepare for his arrival.

338
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:54,780
&nbsp

339
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,864
- Alchemy.
- Mm.

340
00:07:56,874 --> 00:07:56,866
&nbsp

341
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,615
What's he preparing for?

342
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:58,617
&nbsp

343
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:00,200
A battle with you.

344
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:00,202
&nbsp

345
00:08:00,212 --> 00:08:01,585
Why me?

346
00:08:01,595 --> 00:08:01,587
&nbsp

347
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:03,287
You're threatening his power.

348
00:08:03,297 --> 00:08:03,289
&nbsp

349
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:04,505
How do you know all this?

350
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:04,507
&nbsp

351
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:08,759
Speed Force myths, legends, rumors.

352
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:08,761
&nbsp

353
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:10,794
If Savitar's come for you once,

354
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:10,796
&nbsp

355
00:08:10,806 --> 00:08:12,963
he'll be back.

356
00:08:12,973 --> 00:08:12,965
&nbsp

357
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:14,631
Then I'll be ready.

358
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:14,633
&nbsp

359
00:08:14,643 --> 00:08:16,433
We'll be ready.

360
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:23,406
&nbsp

361
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,573
Run! Wallace, run!

362
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:26,318
&nbsp

363
00:08:26,328 --> 00:08:29,069
You got to torque to the left!

364
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:31,023
&nbsp

365
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:32,773
- How'd I do?
- How'd you do?

366
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:32,775
&nbsp

367
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:35,359
Oh, I don't know,
why don't you see for yourself.

368
00:08:35,369 --> 00:08:37,363
&nbsp

369
00:08:37,373 --> 00:08:39,696
Hold up, are you saying
I'm faster than Barry?

370
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:39,698
&nbsp

371
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,199
I'm saying that at this point
in his training,

372
00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:42,201
&nbsp

373
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:44,167
you're faster than Barry.

374
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:44,169
&nbsp

375
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:47,204
You're faster than Barry,
you're faster than Barry,

376
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:47,206
&nbsp

377
00:08:47,216 --> 00:08:48,705
you're faster than Barry!

378
00:08:48,715 --> 00:08:48,707
&nbsp

379
00:08:48,717 --> 00:08:50,791
- We got to tell everyone.
- Not a good idea.

380
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:50,793
&nbsp

381
00:08:50,803 --> 00:08:52,793
- Why not?
- Self-preservation, basically.

382
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:52,795
&nbsp

383
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:55,762
Look, Wallace, you have
tremendous potential.

384
00:08:55,772 --> 00:08:55,764
&nbsp

385
00:08:55,774 --> 00:08:57,881
Yes, clearly, but one thing I've learned

386
00:08:57,891 --> 00:08:57,883
&nbsp

387
00:08:57,893 --> 00:09:00,884
since coming to this Earth
is you do not trifle

388
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:00,886
&nbsp

389
00:09:00,896 --> 00:09:02,469
with the West household.

390
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:02,471
&nbsp

391
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:04,638
No, you know... no, say you're with me.

392
00:09:04,648 --> 00:09:04,640
&nbsp

393
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,390
- Yeah, I'm with you.
- Yeah!

394
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:06,392
&nbsp

395
00:09:06,402 --> 00:09:09,226
Now, we're gonna work on
your... your... yeah, your dodging

396
00:09:09,236 --> 00:09:09,228
&nbsp

397
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:10,227
and your weaving.

398
00:09:10,237 --> 00:09:14,366
&nbsp

399
00:09:14,376 --> 00:09:16,900
I've read every Hindu textbook
there is on mythology

400
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:16,902
&nbsp

401
00:09:16,912 --> 00:09:18,869
and spirits and demigods and nothing.

402
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:18,871
&nbsp

403
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:20,654
No mention of Savitar, not once.

404
00:09:20,664 --> 00:09:20,656
&nbsp

405
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:25,742
In my experience, the answers
usually tend to come in time.

406
00:09:25,752 --> 00:09:25,744
&nbsp

407
00:09:25,754 --> 00:09:28,078
Yeah, I can't just sit back

408
00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:28,080
&nbsp

409
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,747
and wait for Savitar or Alchemy to attack.

410
00:09:30,757 --> 00:09:30,749
&nbsp

411
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:33,633
You can't worry about what
may or may not lie ahead.

412
00:09:33,643 --> 00:09:33,635
&nbsp

413
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:35,252
Besides...

414
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:35,254
&nbsp

415
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:36,553
it's Christmas.

416
00:09:36,563 --> 00:09:36,555
&nbsp

417
00:09:36,565 --> 00:09:39,339
A time to be with the ones you care about.

418
00:09:39,349 --> 00:09:40,893
&nbsp

419
00:09:40,903 --> 00:09:43,477
You know, it's just,
Savitar's still out there.

420
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:43,479
&nbsp

421
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:46,096
Yeah, but not right now.

422
00:09:46,106 --> 00:09:46,098
&nbsp

423
00:09:46,108 --> 00:09:50,317
And your beautiful girlfriend is.

424
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:50,319
&nbsp

425
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:52,152
Get your head out of the books

426
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:52,154
&nbsp

427
00:09:52,164 --> 00:09:54,104
and back into your life with your loved ones

428
00:09:54,114 --> 00:09:54,106
&nbsp

429
00:09:54,116 --> 00:09:55,355
while you have them.

430
00:09:55,365 --> 00:10:06,285
&nbsp

431
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:08,668
Hey, Jay thinks he figured out
a way to find the stone.

432
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:11,457
&nbsp

433
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:12,839
You okay?

434
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:12,841
&nbsp

435
00:10:12,851 --> 00:10:15,092
I don't know.

436
00:10:15,102 --> 00:10:15,094
&nbsp

437
00:10:15,104 --> 00:10:17,044
I keep seeing my brother.

438
00:10:17,054 --> 00:10:17,046
&nbsp

439
00:10:17,056 --> 00:10:20,097
Everywhere... here, in the cortex...

440
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:20,099
&nbsp

441
00:10:20,109 --> 00:10:22,933
Well, this is your first
Christmas since Dante died.

442
00:10:22,943 --> 00:10:22,935
&nbsp

443
00:10:22,945 --> 00:10:26,186
Maybe your mind's playing tricks on you.

444
00:10:26,196 --> 00:10:26,188
&nbsp

445
00:10:26,198 --> 00:10:28,355
Yeah.

446
00:10:28,365 --> 00:10:28,357
&nbsp

447
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:31,608
Probably.

448
00:10:31,618 --> 00:10:33,562
&nbsp

449
00:10:33,572 --> 00:10:37,314
There was this one Christmas,
big family affair.

450
00:10:37,324 --> 00:10:37,316
&nbsp

451
00:10:37,326 --> 00:10:39,066
and Dante and I, you know,

452
00:10:39,076 --> 00:10:39,068
&nbsp

453
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:41,318
we used to fight all the time as kids,

454
00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:41,320
&nbsp

455
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,154
but that one Christmas,

456
00:10:44,164 --> 00:10:44,156
&nbsp

457
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,655
we didn't fight.

458
00:10:45,665 --> 00:10:45,657
&nbsp

459
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:48,408
We just sat and we talked and we drank

460
00:10:48,418 --> 00:10:48,410
&nbsp

461
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,710
a whole bottle of whiskey, and...

462
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:50,712
&nbsp

463
00:10:50,722 --> 00:10:53,997
that whole night, we were laughing.

464
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:55,217
&nbsp

465
00:10:55,227 --> 00:10:56,750
It's...

466
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:56,752
&nbsp

467
00:10:56,762 --> 00:10:58,301
And that one night...

468
00:10:58,311 --> 00:10:58,303
&nbsp

469
00:10:58,313 --> 00:11:01,755
that one night, it was like
we felt like brothers.

470
00:11:01,765 --> 00:11:03,926
&nbsp

471
00:11:03,936 --> 00:11:06,143
The last Christmas before my dad died,

472
00:11:06,153 --> 00:11:06,145
&nbsp

473
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:09,513
it snowed and snowed.

474
00:11:09,523 --> 00:11:09,515
&nbsp

475
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:12,566
He and I just sat inside,
watching old movies

476
00:11:12,576 --> 00:11:12,568
&nbsp

477
00:11:12,578 --> 00:11:16,570
while the whole world turned white.

478
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:16,572
&nbsp

479
00:11:16,582 --> 00:11:19,156
It was magical.

480
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:19,158
&nbsp

481
00:11:19,168 --> 00:11:22,159
Hmm.

482
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:22,161
&nbsp

483
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:23,860
Are we about to be the Grinches this year?

484
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:34,456
&nbsp

485
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:37,624
Nice use of restraint.

486
00:11:37,634 --> 00:11:37,626
&nbsp

487
00:11:37,636 --> 00:11:40,127
Yeah, well, I shopped,

488
00:11:40,137 --> 00:11:40,129
&nbsp

489
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:43,130
and I shopped, and now,

490
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,132
&nbsp

491
00:11:43,142 --> 00:11:47,050
I am ready to drop into your arms.

492
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,520
&nbsp

493
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,720
I'm sorry I missed
Christmas shopping with you.

494
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:50,722
&nbsp

495
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:54,441
It's okay. I have everything I need.

496
00:11:54,451 --> 00:11:54,443
&nbsp

497
00:11:54,453 --> 00:11:56,726
So are you as excited to give me my present

498
00:11:56,736 --> 00:11:56,728
&nbsp

499
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:57,777
as I am to give you yours?

500
00:11:57,787 --> 00:11:57,779
&nbsp

501
00:11:57,789 --> 00:11:59,062
Yeah, of course.

502
00:11:59,072 --> 00:11:59,064
&nbsp

503
00:11:59,074 --> 00:12:01,481
Definitely. Yeah.

504
00:12:01,491 --> 00:12:01,483
&nbsp

505
00:12:01,493 --> 00:12:03,233
You did get me something, right?

506
00:12:03,243 --> 00:12:03,235
&nbsp

507
00:12:03,245 --> 00:12:04,784
I did get you something, yeah.

508
00:12:04,794 --> 00:12:04,786
&nbsp

509
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:06,987
I just... I haven't wrapped it yet, is all.

510
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:09,908
&nbsp

511
00:12:09,918 --> 00:12:11,458
- Okay.
- Okay.

512
00:12:11,468 --> 00:12:11,460
&nbsp

513
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,461
Okay, um, by the way,
after you told me about

514
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:14,463
&nbsp

515
00:12:14,473 --> 00:12:16,379
Julian's archeological dig,

516
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:16,381
&nbsp

517
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:19,249
I started doing some digging of my own.

518
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:19,251
&nbsp

519
00:12:19,261 --> 00:12:20,250
Uh-huh.

520
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,252
&nbsp

521
00:12:20,262 --> 00:12:21,885
Turns out, a few years ago,

522
00:12:21,895 --> 00:12:21,887
&nbsp

523
00:12:21,897 --> 00:12:24,504
four scientists were killed
in an excavation in India

524
00:12:24,514 --> 00:12:24,506
&nbsp

525
00:12:24,516 --> 00:12:26,923
and Julian was the point person.

526
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:26,925
&nbsp

527
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:29,009
He didn't mention that.

528
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:29,011
&nbsp

529
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:32,179
You said he was obsessed
with that stone for years.

530
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:32,181
&nbsp

531
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:35,098
What if he was covering something up?

532
00:12:35,108 --> 00:12:35,100
&nbsp

533
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,566
Or someone?

534
00:12:36,576 --> 00:12:36,568
&nbsp

535
00:12:36,578 --> 00:12:38,735
You think this is about Alchemy?

536
00:12:38,745 --> 00:12:38,737
&nbsp

537
00:12:38,747 --> 00:12:40,070
There's only one way to find out.

538
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,575
&nbsp

539
00:12:43,585 --> 00:12:45,775
Julian lied about the Philosopher's Stone.

540
00:12:45,785 --> 00:12:45,777
&nbsp

541
00:12:45,787 --> 00:12:48,028
I think he found it back
on that archeological dig.

542
00:12:48,038 --> 00:12:48,030
&nbsp

543
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,946
You think he's working with Doctor Alchemy?

544
00:12:49,956 --> 00:12:49,948
&nbsp

545
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,865
He's not answering my calls.

546
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:51,867
&nbsp

547
00:12:51,877 --> 00:12:53,166
Hey, everyone.

548
00:12:53,176 --> 00:12:53,168
&nbsp

549
00:12:53,178 --> 00:12:54,751
Gang's all here, what's going on?

550
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:54,753
&nbsp

551
00:12:54,763 --> 00:12:58,305
I think that Julian is
connected to Doctor Alchemy.

552
00:12:58,315 --> 00:12:58,307
&nbsp

553
00:12:58,317 --> 00:13:00,373
Jay, we got a hit.

554
00:13:00,383 --> 00:13:00,375
&nbsp

555
00:13:00,385 --> 00:13:02,759
There's energy coming from the
top of the Schults building.

556
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:02,761
&nbsp

557
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:04,628
- That's the stone.
- Are you ready?

558
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:04,630
&nbsp

559
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,679
- Ready.
- All right.

560
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:05,681
&nbsp

561
00:13:05,691 --> 00:13:06,763
I'm coming, too.

562
00:13:06,773 --> 00:13:06,765
&nbsp

563
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:07,964
- No you're not.
- No.

564
00:13:07,974 --> 00:13:07,966
&nbsp

565
00:13:07,976 --> 00:13:09,599
Dad, I'm ready.

566
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:09,601
&nbsp

567
00:13:09,611 --> 00:13:11,468
You... just tell them about how fast I am.

568
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:11,470
&nbsp

569
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,969
Tell them about the training.

570
00:13:12,979 --> 00:13:12,971
&nbsp

571
00:13:12,981 --> 00:13:14,437
- Training?
- Training?

572
00:13:14,447 --> 00:13:14,439
&nbsp

573
00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:16,606
Oh, training. The vocal training.

574
00:13:16,616 --> 00:13:16,608
&nbsp

575
00:13:16,618 --> 00:13:18,808
Because we're thinking of going caroling.

576
00:13:18,818 --> 00:13:18,810
&nbsp

577
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,111
We're gonna talk about this later.

578
00:13:21,121 --> 00:13:22,698
&nbsp

579
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,314
We're definitely gonna talk about it.

580
00:13:24,324 --> 00:13:29,621
&nbsp

581
00:13:29,631 --> 00:13:31,788
With energy form this stone,

582
00:13:31,798 --> 00:13:31,790
&nbsp

583
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,908
and this building as a refractor,

584
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:34,910
&nbsp

585
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,661
I shall restore the powers of all the metas

586
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:37,663
&nbsp

587
00:13:37,673 --> 00:13:39,212
from Flashpoint.

588
00:13:39,222 --> 00:13:39,214
&nbsp

589
00:13:39,224 --> 00:13:44,167
They will become the servants of Savitar.

590
00:13:44,177 --> 00:13:44,169
&nbsp

591
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:45,919
It's over, Alchemy!

592
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:49,725
&nbsp

593
00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:51,341
Please tell me you're seeing him.

594
00:13:51,351 --> 00:13:53,228
&nbsp

595
00:13:53,238 --> 00:13:54,761
Oh, I see him.

596
00:13:54,771 --> 00:13:54,763
&nbsp

597
00:13:54,773 --> 00:13:56,513
We have to take him together.

598
00:13:56,523 --> 00:13:56,515
&nbsp

599
00:13:56,525 --> 00:13:57,931
No, I'll cover Savitar,

600
00:13:57,941 --> 00:13:57,933
&nbsp

601
00:13:57,943 --> 00:14:00,016
you just get that stone!

602
00:14:00,026 --> 00:14:39,808
&nbsp

603
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:43,026
This is not your fight, Garrick.

604
00:14:43,036 --> 00:15:06,752
&nbsp

605
00:15:06,762 --> 00:15:08,385
Julian.

606
00:15:08,395 --> 00:15:16,908
&nbsp

607
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:18,507
Where am I?

608
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:18,560
&nbsp

609
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,726
What's going on?

610
00:15:19,736 --> 00:15:22,231
&nbsp

611
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:23,647
Let's just say you're gonna be

612
00:15:23,657 --> 00:15:23,649
&nbsp

613
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:25,032
our guest for a while.

614
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:25,034
&nbsp

615
00:15:25,044 --> 00:15:26,650
You.

616
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:26,652
&nbsp

617
00:15:26,662 --> 00:15:28,652
I always suspected you had
your own private facility

618
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:28,654
&nbsp

619
00:15:28,664 --> 00:15:30,120
for holding enemies.

620
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:30,122
&nbsp

621
00:15:30,132 --> 00:15:31,788
You care to explain what I'm doing in it?

622
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:31,790
&nbsp

623
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,491
- I know you're Alchemy, Julian.
- What?

624
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:34,493
&nbsp

625
00:15:34,503 --> 00:15:36,543
Turning innocent people into meta-humans,

626
00:15:36,553 --> 00:15:36,545
&nbsp

627
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:37,995
worshipping this Savitar?

628
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:37,997
&nbsp

629
00:15:38,007 --> 00:15:39,713
Sorry, um, I'm still not following.

630
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:39,715
&nbsp

631
00:15:39,725 --> 00:15:43,133
You think that I'm Alchemy?

632
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:43,135
&nbsp

633
00:15:43,145 --> 00:15:44,718
That's the most absurd thing
I've ever heard.

634
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:44,720
&nbsp

635
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,003
Is that a mask?

636
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:46,005
&nbsp

637
00:15:46,015 --> 00:15:47,504
I've never seen that before in my life.

638
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:47,506
&nbsp

639
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:49,006
I caught you!

640
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:49,008
&nbsp

641
00:15:49,018 --> 00:15:51,341
I caught you wearing this mask.

642
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:51,343
&nbsp

643
00:15:51,353 --> 00:15:52,509
You're trying to set me up.

644
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:52,511
&nbsp

645
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:54,227
You're framing me, aren't you?

646
00:15:54,237 --> 00:15:54,229
&nbsp

647
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:56,313
The Flash, of all the people,
you're setting me up.

648
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:56,315
&nbsp

649
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:57,514
- The hero.
- You're insane.

650
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:57,516
&nbsp

651
00:15:57,526 --> 00:15:59,099
The great hero!

652
00:15:59,109 --> 00:15:59,101
&nbsp

653
00:15:59,111 --> 00:16:01,768
I want my phone call,
when do I get my phone call?

654
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:05,524
&nbsp

655
00:16:05,534 --> 00:16:06,907
- Hey.
- Hey.

656
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:06,909
&nbsp

657
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:07,858
How you feeling?

658
00:16:07,868 --> 00:16:07,860
&nbsp

659
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,992
Not too bad for a guy

660
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:08,994
&nbsp

661
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:10,360
that got beat up by a myth.

662
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:10,362
&nbsp

663
00:16:10,372 --> 00:16:12,362
- Yeah?
- You stopped him.

664
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:12,364
&nbsp

665
00:16:12,374 --> 00:16:14,081
Well done, Barry.

666
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:14,083
&nbsp

667
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:16,249
It was nice, having you out there with me.

668
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:16,251
&nbsp

669
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:18,001
Yeah, I never had a sidekick.

670
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:18,003
&nbsp

671
00:16:18,013 --> 00:16:20,837
- Oh, I'm your sidekick?
- Well, as a senior partner.

672
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:20,839
&nbsp

673
00:16:20,849 --> 00:16:22,422
Senior citizen is more like it.

674
00:16:22,432 --> 00:16:24,009
&nbsp

675
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:25,876
I'll bet your dad
would've been proud of you.

676
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:25,878
&nbsp

677
00:16:25,888 --> 00:16:27,878
Right?

678
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:29,381
&nbsp

679
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:31,715
Hey, why won't you just
take it easy, all right?

680
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:31,717
&nbsp

681
00:16:31,727 --> 00:16:33,934
- I'll see you in a little bit.
- Yeah.

682
00:16:33,944 --> 00:16:39,570
&nbsp

683
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,653
What do you think about
what Julian was saying?

684
00:16:41,663 --> 00:16:41,655
&nbsp

685
00:16:41,665 --> 00:16:43,572
I know that every bad guy we've ever had

686
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:43,574
&nbsp

687
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:46,074
has pretended to be our best
friend, while really being

688
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:46,076
&nbsp

689
00:16:46,086 --> 00:16:48,910
an evil, murderous bastard, but...

690
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:48,912
&nbsp

691
00:16:48,922 --> 00:16:50,545
I think if he's lying, he sure believes

692
00:16:50,555 --> 00:16:50,547
&nbsp

693
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:51,913
the hell out of his own lie.

694
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:51,915
&nbsp

695
00:16:51,925 --> 00:16:53,248
Okay, well what do we think about this box?

696
00:16:53,258 --> 00:16:53,250
&nbsp

697
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,633
It's creepy.

698
00:16:54,643 --> 00:16:54,635
&nbsp

699
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:56,718
Like, "Indiana Jones" melt your face creepy.

700
00:16:56,728 --> 00:16:56,720
&nbsp

701
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,587
Have you guys figured out
anything about it yet?

702
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:00,674
&nbsp

703
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:01,973
It's nothing.

704
00:17:01,983 --> 00:17:01,975
&nbsp

705
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:03,391
Mm, it's something.

706
00:17:03,401 --> 00:17:03,393
&nbsp

707
00:17:03,403 --> 00:17:06,678
No, I mean the box is literally nothing.

708
00:17:06,688 --> 00:17:06,680
&nbsp

709
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,980
I've run it through every
possible test I can think of...

710
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:08,982
&nbsp

711
00:17:08,992 --> 00:17:13,018
MRI, x-ray, mass spectrometer,
the photon shifter.

712
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:13,020
&nbsp

713
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,403
Not a single reading. Nothing.

714
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:15,405
&nbsp

715
00:17:15,415 --> 00:17:17,439
It's like the box

716
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:17,441
&nbsp

717
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:20,609
doesn't even exist.

718
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:20,611
&nbsp

719
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:22,444
Two weeks ago, I almost lost you to Alchemy,

720
00:17:22,454 --> 00:17:22,446
&nbsp

721
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:24,079
then last week aliens.

722
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:24,081
&nbsp

723
00:17:24,091 --> 00:17:26,114
My heart can't take it, Wally.
Dad, he gets it.

724
00:17:26,124 --> 00:17:26,116
&nbsp

725
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:29,117
- Iris, does he?
- I think so, yeah.

726
00:17:29,127 --> 00:17:29,119
&nbsp

727
00:17:29,129 --> 00:17:30,418
And you...

728
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:30,420
&nbsp

729
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,953
A couple weeks ago, you were telling me

730
00:17:31,963 --> 00:17:31,955
&nbsp

731
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:33,788
how you believed in me and my instincts,

732
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:33,790
&nbsp

733
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,925
and now you're encouraging Wally
to do exactly the opposite?

734
00:17:36,935 --> 00:17:36,927
&nbsp

735
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:38,960
I don't know how much encouraging he needed.

736
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:38,962
&nbsp

737
00:17:38,972 --> 00:17:41,763
- What's the deal with you?
- Hmm?

738
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:41,765
&nbsp

739
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:44,049
You have some psychotic need
to make other people like you

740
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:44,051
&nbsp

741
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:45,183
no matter what?

742
00:17:45,193 --> 00:17:45,185
&nbsp

743
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:46,468
I wouldn't call it psychotic.

744
00:17:46,478 --> 00:17:46,470
&nbsp

745
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,886
No, my deal is,

746
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:47,888
&nbsp

747
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:49,721
I find people's true talents,

748
00:17:49,731 --> 00:17:49,723
&nbsp

749
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:51,273
and I just marshal them along.

750
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:51,275
&nbsp

751
00:17:51,285 --> 00:17:52,807
Do you even have your own opinions?

752
00:17:52,817 --> 00:17:52,809
&nbsp

753
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:54,859
Stop. Stop banging on H.R.

754
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:54,861
&nbsp

755
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:55,977
This was all me, okay?

756
00:17:55,987 --> 00:17:55,979
&nbsp

757
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:57,195
I pushed him to train me.

758
00:17:57,205 --> 00:17:57,197
&nbsp

759
00:17:57,207 --> 00:17:58,780
I pushed him to help me.

760
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:58,782
&nbsp

761
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:01,232
Wasn't like anyone else
was lining up to do it.

762
00:18:01,242 --> 00:18:08,125
&nbsp

763
00:18:08,135 --> 00:18:10,992
Hey. What's up?

764
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:10,994
&nbsp

765
00:18:11,004 --> 00:18:13,078
It's Wally.

766
00:18:13,088 --> 00:18:13,080
&nbsp

767
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,130
I don't get it, Bar, it's like
his brain goes to sleep

768
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:15,132
&nbsp

769
00:18:15,142 --> 00:18:16,498
and somebody else is at the wheel.

770
00:18:16,508 --> 00:18:22,255
&nbsp

771
00:18:22,265 --> 00:18:24,639
Have you been losing time? Blacking out?

772
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:24,641
&nbsp

773
00:18:24,651 --> 00:18:26,925
Hours passing,
waking up somewhere different?

774
00:18:26,935 --> 00:18:26,927
&nbsp

775
00:18:26,937 --> 00:18:28,510
Not being sure of how you got there.

776
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:28,512
&nbsp

777
00:18:28,522 --> 00:18:30,512
- No.
- No?

778
00:18:30,522 --> 00:18:30,514
&nbsp

779
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:31,563
No!

780
00:18:31,573 --> 00:18:31,565
&nbsp

781
00:18:31,575 --> 00:18:32,597
I've had enough of these

782
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:32,599
&nbsp

783
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:33,732
baseless accusations

784
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:33,734
&nbsp

785
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:35,650
and ridiculous theories of yours.

786
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:35,652
&nbsp

787
00:18:35,662 --> 00:18:37,235
Julian, I'm trying to help you!

788
00:18:37,245 --> 00:18:37,237
&nbsp

789
00:18:37,247 --> 00:18:38,653
But you need to trust me.

790
00:18:38,663 --> 00:18:38,655
&nbsp

791
00:18:38,665 --> 00:18:39,904
Says the man in a mask.

792
00:18:39,914 --> 00:18:42,743
&nbsp

793
00:18:42,753 --> 00:18:44,326
No, you're right.

794
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:51,418
&nbsp

795
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:52,584
I should've known.

796
00:18:52,594 --> 00:18:52,586
&nbsp

797
00:18:52,596 --> 00:18:53,868
I should've guessed it.

798
00:18:53,878 --> 00:18:53,870
&nbsp

799
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,004
Ah!

800
00:18:56,014 --> 00:18:56,006
&nbsp

801
00:18:56,016 --> 00:18:59,791
The unexplained absences,
your passion for metas.

802
00:18:59,801 --> 00:18:59,793
&nbsp

803
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:02,127
Your general thumbing your nose
at authority.

804
00:19:02,137 --> 00:19:02,129
&nbsp

805
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:04,346
I'm sure you had a good laugh
behind my back.

806
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:04,348
&nbsp

807
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:06,548
I actually wished
I could've told you before.

808
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:06,550
&nbsp

809
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,049
So why tell me now?

810
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:08,051
&nbsp

811
00:19:08,061 --> 00:19:10,218
Because I need you to trust me, Julian.

812
00:19:10,228 --> 00:19:10,220
&nbsp

813
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,603
You are Alchemy.

814
00:19:11,613 --> 00:19:11,605
&nbsp

815
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:13,355
I just don't think you're aware of it.

816
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:13,357
&nbsp

817
00:19:13,367 --> 00:19:16,391
Now, have you been blacking out?

818
00:19:16,401 --> 00:19:16,393
&nbsp

819
00:19:16,403 --> 00:19:18,226
Yes.

820
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:18,228
&nbsp

821
00:19:18,238 --> 00:19:19,644
When did it start?

822
00:19:19,654 --> 00:19:21,898
&nbsp

823
00:19:21,908 --> 00:19:25,900
My sister, Emma, died when I was 20.

824
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:25,902
&nbsp

825
00:19:25,912 --> 00:19:27,619
And it really broke the family up, you know?

826
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:27,621
&nbsp

827
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:28,903
Mom and Dad weren't speaking,

828
00:19:28,913 --> 00:19:28,905
&nbsp

829
00:19:28,915 --> 00:19:30,905
they wouldn't even stay at the house.

830
00:19:30,915 --> 00:19:30,907
&nbsp

831
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:32,457
One night, I was there alone,

832
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:32,459
&nbsp

833
00:19:32,469 --> 00:19:35,744
and she came back to me.

834
00:19:35,754 --> 00:19:35,746
&nbsp

835
00:19:35,756 --> 00:19:37,746
She stood right in front of me,

836
00:19:37,756 --> 00:19:37,748
&nbsp

837
00:19:37,758 --> 00:19:40,582
clear as day... a ghost
or a vision, I don't know,

838
00:19:40,592 --> 00:19:40,584
&nbsp

839
00:19:40,594 --> 00:19:41,916
but...

840
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:41,918
&nbsp

841
00:19:41,928 --> 00:19:43,635
she was real.

842
00:19:43,645 --> 00:19:43,637
&nbsp

843
00:19:43,647 --> 00:19:45,086
What happened?

844
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:45,088
&nbsp

845
00:19:45,098 --> 00:19:47,172
She told me about the stone.

846
00:19:47,182 --> 00:19:47,174
&nbsp

847
00:19:47,184 --> 00:19:48,556
She told me where to find it,

848
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:48,558
&nbsp

849
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:50,925
she told me that if I got it, then it would

850
00:19:50,935 --> 00:19:50,927
&nbsp

851
00:19:50,937 --> 00:19:52,594
bring us back together again.

852
00:19:52,604 --> 00:19:52,596
&nbsp

853
00:19:52,606 --> 00:19:54,345
And at that point, mate,
I would've done anything

854
00:19:54,355 --> 00:19:54,347
&nbsp

855
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:56,431
to have her back.

856
00:19:56,441 --> 00:19:56,433
&nbsp

857
00:19:56,443 --> 00:19:58,767
That's what I did.

858
00:19:58,777 --> 00:19:58,769
&nbsp

859
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:00,852
I mounted an expedition to India.

860
00:20:00,862 --> 00:20:01,772
&nbsp

861
00:20:01,782 --> 00:20:04,906
Days we searched, weeks.

862
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:04,908
&nbsp

863
00:20:04,918 --> 00:20:06,441
Nothing.

864
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:06,443
&nbsp

865
00:20:06,453 --> 00:20:07,409
And then we found it.

866
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:09,496
&nbsp

867
00:20:09,506 --> 00:20:11,780
And the next thing I remember,
I woke up in the hotel room.

868
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:11,782
&nbsp

869
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:13,915
I...

870
00:20:13,925 --> 00:20:13,917
&nbsp

871
00:20:13,927 --> 00:20:16,251
didn't remember anything,
and that's when the blackouts

872
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:16,253
&nbsp

873
00:20:16,263 --> 00:20:17,419
started happening.

874
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:17,421
&nbsp

875
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:19,621
There was a news report saying that

876
00:20:19,631 --> 00:20:19,623
&nbsp

877
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:22,624
every other member of my team
had been found...

878
00:20:22,634 --> 00:20:22,626
&nbsp

879
00:20:22,636 --> 00:20:26,294
dead at the site.

880
00:20:26,304 --> 00:20:26,296
&nbsp

881
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:28,847
I panicked, I thought they were
gonna blame me for their deaths,

882
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:28,849
&nbsp

883
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:31,800
so I ran.

884
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:31,802
&nbsp

885
00:20:31,812 --> 00:20:33,802
I ran to America.

886
00:20:33,812 --> 00:20:33,804
&nbsp

887
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:35,970
What happens when you black out, Julian?

888
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:35,972
&nbsp

889
00:20:35,982 --> 00:20:37,689
How does it start?

890
00:20:37,699 --> 00:20:37,691
&nbsp

891
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:39,474
I hear the voice.

892
00:20:39,484 --> 00:20:43,146
&nbsp

893
00:20:43,156 --> 00:20:45,029
Cisco.

894
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:45,982
&nbsp

895
00:20:45,992 --> 00:20:47,115
You're losing it, man,

896
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:47,117
&nbsp

897
00:20:47,127 --> 00:20:48,149
you're losing it.

898
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,986
&nbsp

899
00:20:49,996 --> 00:20:51,786
Stop scaring me!

900
00:20:51,796 --> 00:20:51,788
&nbsp

901
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:55,657
Whatever you are, it's not cool, okay?

902
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:55,659
&nbsp

903
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:57,709
Oh, I know exactly what you are.

904
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:57,711
&nbsp

905
00:20:57,721 --> 00:21:01,079
You are a figment of my grief.

906
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:01,081
&nbsp

907
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:03,214
Please just leave.

908
00:21:03,224 --> 00:21:03,216
&nbsp

909
00:21:03,226 --> 00:21:05,500
I can't do that, Cisco.

910
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:05,502
&nbsp

911
00:21:05,512 --> 00:21:07,168
This is not real.

912
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:07,170
&nbsp

913
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,671
Okay, I need an anti-psychotic. Caitlin!

914
00:21:09,681 --> 00:21:09,673
&nbsp

915
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:11,256
If you leave,

916
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:11,258
&nbsp

917
00:21:11,268 --> 00:21:13,725
I'm gonna have to leave, too.

918
00:21:13,735 --> 00:21:13,727
&nbsp

919
00:21:13,737 --> 00:21:16,060
So you're telling me that...

920
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,062
&nbsp

921
00:21:16,072 --> 00:21:17,762
that every time I'm blacking out...

922
00:21:17,772 --> 00:21:17,764
&nbsp

923
00:21:17,774 --> 00:21:19,097
You've become Alchemy.

924
00:21:19,107 --> 00:21:19,099
&nbsp

925
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:20,348
That's impossible.

926
00:21:20,358 --> 00:21:20,350
&nbsp

927
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,066
Alchemy is a monster,

928
00:21:22,076 --> 00:21:22,068
&nbsp

929
00:21:22,078 --> 00:21:24,652
he's been terrorizing people for years.

930
00:21:24,662 --> 00:21:24,654
&nbsp

931
00:21:24,664 --> 00:21:26,104
Look, it's not you.

932
00:21:26,114 --> 00:21:26,106
&nbsp

933
00:21:26,116 --> 00:21:27,822
Just like it wasn't you back on that dig.

934
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:27,824
&nbsp

935
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:29,991
I know that this is hard to believe,

936
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:29,993
&nbsp

937
00:21:30,003 --> 00:21:33,244
but you have to start accepting
what's happening to you.

938
00:21:33,254 --> 00:21:33,246
&nbsp

939
00:21:33,256 --> 00:21:36,748
Don't you want us to be together again?

940
00:21:36,758 --> 00:21:36,750
&nbsp

941
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,949
The stone.

942
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:37,951
&nbsp

943
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:39,701
It's the key to everything.

944
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:39,703
&nbsp

945
00:21:39,713 --> 00:21:42,453
It can transform people.

946
00:21:42,463 --> 00:21:42,455
&nbsp

947
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:45,540
Open it and I can be reborn.

948
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:45,542
&nbsp

949
00:21:45,552 --> 00:21:47,041
We can be together again.

950
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:48,712
&nbsp

951
00:21:48,722 --> 00:21:51,880
We can have that bottle of whiskey.

952
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:51,882
&nbsp

953
00:21:51,892 --> 00:21:54,933
After all, it is Christmas, hermano.

954
00:21:54,943 --> 00:21:54,935
&nbsp

955
00:21:54,945 --> 00:21:57,101
It's the time of miracles.

956
00:21:57,111 --> 00:22:03,393
&nbsp

957
00:22:03,403 --> 00:22:05,560
I just want this to be real.

958
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,230
&nbsp

959
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,781
Just open the box.

960
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:15,071
&nbsp

961
00:22:15,081 --> 00:22:16,738
I love you, Cisco.

962
00:22:16,748 --> 00:22:23,547
&nbsp

963
00:22:23,557 --> 00:22:24,796
Dante.

964
00:22:24,806 --> 00:22:27,751
&nbsp

965
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:29,834
Dante?

966
00:22:29,844 --> 00:22:36,155
&nbsp

967
00:22:36,165 --> 00:22:37,905
What's that?

968
00:22:37,915 --> 00:22:38,471
&nbsp

969
00:22:38,481 --> 00:22:40,337
- Guys, what's going on?
- Cisco's workshop.

970
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:40,339
&nbsp

971
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:42,590
Barry, he opened the box.

972
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:42,592
&nbsp

973
00:22:42,602 --> 00:22:44,425
Wait...

974
00:22:44,435 --> 00:22:44,427
&nbsp

975
00:22:44,437 --> 00:22:46,393
Cisco?

976
00:22:46,403 --> 00:22:46,395
&nbsp

977
00:22:46,405 --> 00:22:48,562
Bow to your god.

978
00:22:48,572 --> 00:22:53,102
&nbsp

979
00:22:53,112 --> 00:22:55,269
- What is happening?
- We can't see it,

980
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:55,271
&nbsp

981
00:22:55,281 --> 00:22:56,470
just like at Alchemy's lair.

982
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:56,472
&nbsp

983
00:22:56,482 --> 00:22:57,938
Savitar's loose.

984
00:22:57,948 --> 00:22:57,940
&nbsp

985
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:00,691
Hey, Jay, Jay, you're still too badly hurt.

986
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:00,693
&nbsp

987
00:23:00,703 --> 00:23:04,578
Remember, dodge and weave.

988
00:23:04,588 --> 00:23:06,082
&nbsp

989
00:23:06,092 --> 00:23:07,781
Wally, no!

990
00:23:07,791 --> 00:23:10,002
&nbsp

991
00:23:10,012 --> 00:23:11,118
I can see him.

992
00:23:11,128 --> 00:23:11,120
&nbsp

993
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,454
Great. Get his attention.

994
00:23:13,464 --> 00:23:13,456
&nbsp

995
00:23:13,466 --> 00:23:15,506
Uh, yo, metal mouth.

996
00:23:15,516 --> 00:23:17,209
&nbsp

997
00:23:17,219 --> 00:23:19,510
Clearly, nobody taught you how
to place nice with others.

998
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,681
&nbsp

999
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:24,014
Cisco? Cisco, you have to close the box!

1000
00:23:24,024 --> 00:23:27,687
&nbsp

1001
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,136
I'm gonna save Dante.

1002
00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:29,138
&nbsp

1003
00:23:29,148 --> 00:23:31,305
It's... that's not Dante, it's Savitar.

1004
00:23:31,315 --> 00:23:31,307
&nbsp

1005
00:23:31,317 --> 00:23:34,358
Please, he's using
your memories against you!

1006
00:23:34,368 --> 00:23:34,360
&nbsp

1007
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,277
You're a good brother, Cisco.

1008
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:36,279
&nbsp

1009
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,811
Cisco, we're running out of time.

1010
00:23:37,821 --> 00:23:37,813
&nbsp

1011
00:23:37,823 --> 00:23:39,196
Please, just hand me the box.

1012
00:23:39,206 --> 00:23:39,198
&nbsp

1013
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,815
I won't lose him again.

1014
00:23:41,825 --> 00:23:41,817
&nbsp

1015
00:23:41,827 --> 00:23:44,234
I will not lose my brother again!

1016
00:23:44,244 --> 00:23:44,236
&nbsp

1017
00:23:44,246 --> 00:23:45,869
Cisco, Dante is gone.

1018
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:45,871
&nbsp

1019
00:23:45,881 --> 00:23:48,872
I'm so sorry, but there is
nothing you can do about it.

1020
00:23:48,882 --> 00:23:48,874
&nbsp

1021
00:23:48,884 --> 00:23:51,709
But there are people you can save right now.

1022
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:51,711
&nbsp

1023
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:53,327
If you don't close that box,

1024
00:23:53,337 --> 00:23:53,329
&nbsp

1025
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:55,496
Barry and Wally will die.

1026
00:23:55,506 --> 00:23:57,416
&nbsp

1027
00:23:57,426 --> 00:23:58,999
If you do, we can't be together.

1028
00:23:59,009 --> 00:23:59,001
&nbsp

1029
00:23:59,011 --> 00:24:00,467
Cisco, listen to me!

1030
00:24:00,477 --> 00:24:08,010
&nbsp

1031
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,343
Don't.

1032
00:24:09,353 --> 00:24:11,480
&nbsp

1033
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,347
Lo siento, hermano.

1034
00:24:13,357 --> 00:24:22,525
&nbsp

1035
00:24:22,535 --> 00:24:24,658
Thanks.

1036
00:24:24,668 --> 00:24:24,660
&nbsp

1037
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,777
You kidding? That was awesome.

1038
00:24:26,787 --> 00:24:28,831
&nbsp

1039
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:30,197
Are you sure you're okay?

1040
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:30,199
&nbsp

1041
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:32,249
Still in one piece.

1042
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:32,251
&nbsp

1043
00:24:32,261 --> 00:24:33,500
I don't know what happened.

1044
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:33,502
&nbsp

1045
00:24:33,512 --> 00:24:35,536
So now that the box is closed,

1046
00:24:35,546 --> 00:24:35,538
&nbsp

1047
00:24:35,548 --> 00:24:37,087
Savitar's, what, gone for good?

1048
00:24:37,097 --> 00:24:37,089
&nbsp

1049
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:39,923
I don't know, but we need to find out.

1050
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:39,925
&nbsp

1051
00:24:39,935 --> 00:24:41,291
Cisco?

1052
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:41,293
&nbsp

1053
00:24:41,303 --> 00:24:43,627
If we can't use this box, Julian,

1054
00:24:43,637 --> 00:24:43,629
&nbsp

1055
00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:46,347
he may be our only link to
Savitar now, right?

1056
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:46,349
&nbsp

1057
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,882
I think we can use both of them.

1058
00:24:48,892 --> 00:24:48,884
&nbsp

1059
00:24:48,894 --> 00:24:52,353
If Caitlin's right and this
thing messes with brainwaves,

1060
00:24:52,363 --> 00:24:52,355
&nbsp

1061
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,304
then I have a plan.

1062
00:24:54,314 --> 00:24:58,561
&nbsp

1063
00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:00,828
Hey.

1064
00:25:00,838 --> 00:25:00,830
&nbsp

1065
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,397
You put my son's life in danger again.

1066
00:25:03,407 --> 00:25:03,399
&nbsp

1067
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:06,483
And he saved Barry's life.

1068
00:25:06,493 --> 00:25:06,485
&nbsp

1069
00:25:06,495 --> 00:25:08,402
Joe, why...

1070
00:25:08,412 --> 00:25:08,404
&nbsp

1071
00:25:08,414 --> 00:25:10,204
why do you think I help Wally?

1072
00:25:10,214 --> 00:25:10,206
&nbsp

1073
00:25:10,216 --> 00:25:11,739
'Cause I'm selfish, I get something...

1074
00:25:11,749 --> 00:25:11,741
&nbsp

1075
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:13,073
I don't get anything out of it.

1076
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:13,075
&nbsp

1077
00:25:13,085 --> 00:25:16,744
I help Wally 'cause the kid is special.

1078
00:25:16,754 --> 00:25:16,746
&nbsp

1079
00:25:16,756 --> 00:25:18,128
He's extraordinary.

1080
00:25:18,138 --> 00:25:18,130
&nbsp

1081
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,216
His powers are extraordinary
and... look, I get it.

1082
00:25:22,226 --> 00:25:22,218
&nbsp

1083
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:24,134
I'm... I'm not his dad
and I don't have the same

1084
00:25:24,144 --> 00:25:24,136
&nbsp

1085
00:25:24,146 --> 00:25:25,719
safety concerns as you, of course not,

1086
00:25:25,729 --> 00:25:25,721
&nbsp

1087
00:25:25,731 --> 00:25:28,088
but Joe, one thing I do know,

1088
00:25:28,098 --> 00:25:28,090
&nbsp

1089
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,424
the longer you deny someone their potential,

1090
00:25:30,434 --> 00:25:30,426
&nbsp

1091
00:25:30,436 --> 00:25:32,593
the more they're gonna
look for it elsewhere.

1092
00:25:32,603 --> 00:25:37,471
&nbsp

1093
00:25:37,481 --> 00:25:38,599
So what am I doing here?

1094
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:39,072
&nbsp

1095
00:25:39,082 --> 00:25:41,390
Okay, Julian, today
when I was fighting Savitar,

1096
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:41,437
&nbsp

1097
00:25:41,447 --> 00:25:43,854
it... he and Alchemy, they had the same voice.

1098
00:25:43,864 --> 00:25:44,901
&nbsp

1099
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:45,884
All right, what does that mean?

1100
00:25:45,894 --> 00:25:45,955
&nbsp

1101
00:25:45,965 --> 00:25:48,405
I don't think there is an Alchemy,

1102
00:25:48,415 --> 00:25:48,407
&nbsp

1103
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:50,908
I think it's Savitar speaking through you.

1104
00:25:50,918 --> 00:25:50,910
&nbsp

1105
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,461
Savitar clearly possesses
someone who rallies worshippers.

1106
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:54,463
&nbsp

1107
00:25:54,473 --> 00:25:56,380
But he's like a poltergeist,
he needs a medium

1108
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,382
&nbsp

1109
00:25:56,392 --> 00:25:57,381
to manifest himself.

1110
00:25:57,391 --> 00:25:57,383
&nbsp

1111
00:25:57,393 --> 00:25:58,499
You.

1112
00:25:58,509 --> 00:25:58,501
&nbsp

1113
00:25:58,511 --> 00:25:59,833
Right, but what does that mean?

1114
00:25:59,843 --> 00:25:59,835
&nbsp

1115
00:25:59,845 --> 00:26:01,552
We think we figured out a way

1116
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:01,554
&nbsp

1117
00:26:01,564 --> 00:26:04,421
to sync your brain to the stone.

1118
00:26:04,431 --> 00:26:04,423
&nbsp

1119
00:26:04,433 --> 00:26:06,557
And it'll allow us
to speak directly to Savitar.

1120
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:06,559
&nbsp

1121
00:26:06,569 --> 00:26:07,341
I thought...

1122
00:26:07,351 --> 00:26:07,369
&nbsp

1123
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:08,669
If you want to try to be free of this,

1124
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:08,671
&nbsp

1125
00:26:08,681 --> 00:26:10,704
you need to trust us.

1126
00:26:10,714 --> 00:26:16,045
&nbsp

1127
00:26:16,055 --> 00:26:18,962
- I've never liked you, Allen.
- Yeah.

1128
00:26:18,972 --> 00:26:18,964
&nbsp

1129
00:26:18,974 --> 00:26:20,714
Having a little siance with your friends now

1130
00:26:20,724 --> 00:26:20,716
&nbsp

1131
00:26:20,726 --> 00:26:22,049
is not gonna help change that fact.

1132
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:22,051
&nbsp

1133
00:26:22,061 --> 00:26:23,016
You do know that.

1134
00:26:23,026 --> 00:26:26,689
&nbsp

1135
00:26:26,699 --> 00:26:28,638
Fine, I'll try it.

1136
00:26:28,648 --> 00:26:32,277
&nbsp

1137
00:26:32,287 --> 00:26:33,860
Deep breaths.

1138
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:33,862
&nbsp

1139
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:35,228
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1140
00:26:35,238 --> 00:26:35,230
&nbsp

1141
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,731
You're gonna count backwards from ten.

1142
00:26:37,741 --> 00:26:40,235
&nbsp

1143
00:26:40,245 --> 00:26:41,902
Te...

1144
00:26:41,912 --> 00:26:46,408
&nbsp

1145
00:26:46,418 --> 00:26:47,874
That was quick.

1146
00:26:47,884 --> 00:26:47,876
&nbsp

1147
00:26:47,886 --> 00:26:50,127
Okay, so, um, how long till this works?

1148
00:26:50,137 --> 00:26:50,129
&nbsp

1149
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:52,462
Not really sure, it may take
a minute for his brain waves...

1150
00:26:52,472 --> 00:26:59,421
&nbsp

1151
00:26:59,431 --> 00:27:01,304
Hello, Barry.

1152
00:27:01,314 --> 00:27:01,306
&nbsp

1153
00:27:01,316 --> 00:27:02,672
It's been a while.

1154
00:27:02,682 --> 00:27:10,912
&nbsp

1155
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:12,161
Savitar?

1156
00:27:12,171 --> 00:27:13,748
&nbsp

1157
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,581
None of you are on your knees.

1158
00:27:15,591 --> 00:27:15,583
&nbsp

1159
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:18,551
It's a smart move to bow before a deity.

1160
00:27:18,561 --> 00:27:18,553
&nbsp

1161
00:27:18,563 --> 00:27:20,052
You're not God.

1162
00:27:20,062 --> 00:27:20,054
&nbsp

1163
00:27:20,064 --> 00:27:21,921
To be a god, you just have to make people

1164
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:21,923
&nbsp

1165
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:22,972
believe you are.

1166
00:27:22,982 --> 00:27:22,974
&nbsp

1167
00:27:22,984 --> 00:27:24,590
No one believes in you.

1168
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:24,592
&nbsp

1169
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,392
You should, Iris.

1170
00:27:26,402 --> 00:27:26,394
&nbsp

1171
00:27:26,404 --> 00:27:29,845
I hold the power of life
and death over all of you.

1172
00:27:29,855 --> 00:27:29,847
&nbsp

1173
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,430
How do you know so much about us?

1174
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:31,432
&nbsp

1175
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:32,932
I know you, Caitlin.

1176
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:32,934
&nbsp

1177
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:35,985
Cisco, Joe, Wally.

1178
00:27:35,995 --> 00:27:35,987
&nbsp

1179
00:27:35,997 --> 00:27:37,486
The fake Wells.

1180
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:37,488
&nbsp

1181
00:27:37,498 --> 00:27:39,822
I know your fears
and I know your weaknesses.

1182
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:39,824
&nbsp

1183
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:43,108
I know you better than you know yourselves.

1184
00:27:43,118 --> 00:27:43,110
&nbsp

1185
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,111
I know your destinies.

1186
00:27:46,121 --> 00:27:46,113
&nbsp

1187
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:49,114
One shall betray you.

1188
00:27:49,124 --> 00:27:49,116
&nbsp

1189
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,667
One shall fall.

1190
00:27:51,677 --> 00:27:51,669
&nbsp

1191
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,788
One will suffer a fate far worse than death.

1192
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:55,790
&nbsp

1193
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,756
This is the knowledge I have for you.

1194
00:27:57,766 --> 00:27:57,758
&nbsp

1195
00:27:57,768 --> 00:28:00,676
About your everlasting damnation.

1196
00:28:00,686 --> 00:28:00,678
&nbsp

1197
00:28:00,688 --> 00:28:03,512
Who are you?

1198
00:28:03,522 --> 00:28:03,514
&nbsp

1199
00:28:03,524 --> 00:28:05,431
I am the future, Flash.

1200
00:28:05,441 --> 00:28:05,433
&nbsp

1201
00:28:05,443 --> 00:28:06,932
What do you want from us?

1202
00:28:06,942 --> 00:28:06,934
&nbsp

1203
00:28:06,944 --> 00:28:08,934
Everything!

1204
00:28:08,944 --> 00:28:08,936
&nbsp

1205
00:28:08,946 --> 00:28:12,354
Everything you took from me, I want it back.

1206
00:28:12,364 --> 00:28:12,356
&nbsp

1207
00:28:12,366 --> 00:28:14,306
And I'm gonna take it back.

1208
00:28:14,316 --> 00:28:14,308
&nbsp

1209
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,308
Then, I will destroy you.

1210
00:28:16,318 --> 00:28:16,310
&nbsp

1211
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,394
Then why haven't you already?

1212
00:28:18,404 --> 00:28:18,396
&nbsp

1213
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:20,613
If you're all-powerful,
then why don't you just

1214
00:28:20,623 --> 00:28:20,615
&nbsp

1215
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:23,983
go ahead and kill us all now,
be done with it?

1216
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:23,985
&nbsp

1217
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:25,734
Because you can't.

1218
00:28:25,744 --> 00:28:25,736
&nbsp

1219
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:28,487
You did this to me.

1220
00:28:28,497 --> 00:28:28,489
&nbsp

1221
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,823
You trapped me in eternity.

1222
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:30,825
&nbsp

1223
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:34,827
Your future self...
you did this to me, Barry.

1224
00:28:34,837 --> 00:28:34,829
&nbsp

1225
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:37,463
And now the age of my revenge rises.

1226
00:28:37,473 --> 00:28:37,465
&nbsp

1227
00:28:37,475 --> 00:28:39,381
My freedom is at hand.

1228
00:28:39,391 --> 00:28:39,383
&nbsp

1229
00:28:39,393 --> 00:28:41,333
You will feel my wrath.

1230
00:28:41,343 --> 00:28:41,335
&nbsp

1231
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:44,336
The wrath of Savitar!

1232
00:28:44,346 --> 00:28:48,559
&nbsp

1233
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:50,976
Did it work?

1234
00:28:50,986 --> 00:28:50,978
&nbsp

1235
00:28:50,988 --> 00:28:54,013
That was so scary.

1236
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:54,015
&nbsp

1237
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:56,148
I mean, that was...
was it not truly frightening,

1238
00:28:56,158 --> 00:28:56,150
&nbsp

1239
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,517
what the voice and the prophesies and the...

1240
00:28:58,527 --> 00:28:58,519
&nbsp

1241
00:28:58,529 --> 00:29:01,020
oh, it was... I mean,
that a scare-a-thon, wasn't it?

1242
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:01,022
&nbsp

1243
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:03,372
I'm gonna have a mint tea
and a coffee and a lay down.

1244
00:29:03,382 --> 00:29:03,374
&nbsp

1245
00:29:03,384 --> 00:29:05,658
Do you think the things that he said about

1246
00:29:05,668 --> 00:29:05,660
&nbsp

1247
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,777
one of us betraying him and one of us dying

1248
00:29:08,787 --> 00:29:08,779
&nbsp

1249
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,029
could really be true?

1250
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:10,031
&nbsp

1251
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:12,831
I mean, if it really was future Barry

1252
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:12,833
&nbsp

1253
00:29:12,843 --> 00:29:14,667
that pissed him off
and locked him up somewhere,

1254
00:29:14,677 --> 00:29:14,669
&nbsp

1255
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:17,836
then maybe he knows
what happens to future us.

1256
00:29:17,846 --> 00:29:17,838
&nbsp

1257
00:29:17,848 --> 00:29:19,505
He doesn't.

1258
00:29:19,515 --> 00:29:19,507
&nbsp

1259
00:29:19,517 --> 00:29:21,707
He's never getting out of
wherever he's trapped.

1260
00:29:21,717 --> 00:29:21,709
&nbsp

1261
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:23,876
So how are we supposed to stop him?

1262
00:29:23,886 --> 00:29:23,878
&nbsp

1263
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:26,712
The stone.

1264
00:29:26,722 --> 00:29:26,714
&nbsp

1265
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:29,098
Jay's right, the stone has
been the key to everything.

1266
00:29:29,108 --> 00:29:29,100
&nbsp

1267
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,133
It's... it's how he controlled Julian,

1268
00:29:31,143 --> 00:29:31,135
&nbsp

1269
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:32,885
it's how he's created more metas.

1270
00:29:32,895 --> 00:29:32,887
&nbsp

1271
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:36,555
So we destroy the stone
and Savitar is gone for good.

1272
00:29:36,565 --> 00:29:36,557
&nbsp

1273
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,607
It's impossible to destroy.

1274
00:29:38,617 --> 00:29:38,609
&nbsp

1275
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:40,693
It's been around forever,
there's a reason for that.

1276
00:29:40,703 --> 00:29:40,695
&nbsp

1277
00:29:40,705 --> 00:29:42,277
Why don't we just bury it again,

1278
00:29:42,287 --> 00:29:42,279
&nbsp

1279
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:43,529
put it back in the ground
where you found it?

1280
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:43,531
&nbsp

1281
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:45,280
Mm-mm. "Jumanji."

1282
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:45,282
&nbsp

1283
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:46,732
Someone would just find it
and we'd be right back

1284
00:29:46,742 --> 00:29:46,734
&nbsp

1285
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:48,150
where we started.

1286
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,152
&nbsp

1287
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:50,402
We need to make that box disappear forever.

1288
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:50,404
&nbsp

1289
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,538
There's only one thing we can do with it.

1290
00:29:52,548 --> 00:29:52,540
&nbsp

1291
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:55,240
Throw it into the Speed Force.

1292
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:55,242
&nbsp

1293
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,159
- Wait, you can do that?
- Oh, yeah.

1294
00:29:57,169 --> 00:29:57,161
&nbsp

1295
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,495
The Speed Force is eternity itself,

1296
00:29:59,505 --> 00:29:59,497
&nbsp

1297
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:01,914
an endless void of time and energy.

1298
00:30:01,924 --> 00:30:01,916
&nbsp

1299
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:04,416
It'd be like trying to find it
after it got lost in space.

1300
00:30:04,426 --> 00:30:04,418
&nbsp

1301
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:07,052
But that stone is loaded
with gravimetric force.

1302
00:30:07,062 --> 00:30:07,054
&nbsp

1303
00:30:07,064 --> 00:30:09,922
I mean, I don't think
you could run fast enough

1304
00:30:09,932 --> 00:30:09,924
&nbsp

1305
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:12,141
to reach the Speed Force and
carry that at the same time.

1306
00:30:12,151 --> 00:30:12,143
&nbsp

1307
00:30:12,153 --> 00:30:14,259
He can with my help.

1308
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:14,261
&nbsp

1309
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,095
We run as fast as we can.

1310
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:16,097
&nbsp

1311
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:18,647
You trail behind me,
siphon off some of my speed,

1312
00:30:18,657 --> 00:30:18,649
&nbsp

1313
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,649
combine it with your own,
and when you have enough,

1314
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:20,651
&nbsp

1315
00:30:20,661 --> 00:30:22,484
throw that thing deep into the Speed Force.

1316
00:30:22,494 --> 00:30:24,271
&nbsp

1317
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,405
And that would work?

1318
00:30:26,415 --> 00:30:26,407
&nbsp

1319
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:27,773
We need to find out.

1320
00:30:27,783 --> 00:30:29,777
&nbsp

1321
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:32,161
Sure you're up for this, Flash?

1322
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:32,163
&nbsp

1323
00:30:32,173 --> 00:30:33,662
You got it, Flash.

1324
00:30:33,672 --> 00:30:33,664
&nbsp

1325
00:30:33,674 --> 00:30:36,532
I'll let you know
when you reach optimal speed.

1326
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:36,534
&nbsp

1327
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,117
Ready... go!

1328
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:43,791
&nbsp

1329
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:46,175
Jay's moving really fast,
this might actually work.

1330
00:30:46,185 --> 00:30:54,685
&nbsp

1331
00:30:54,695 --> 00:30:55,768
Now, Barry!

1332
00:30:55,778 --> 00:31:14,155
&nbsp

1333
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:16,989
In other legal news,
the highly publicized trial

1334
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:16,991
&nbsp

1335
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:20,492
of Jared Morillo, AKA
"Plunder," comes to a close.

1336
00:31:20,502 --> 00:31:20,494
&nbsp

1337
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:23,078
Morillo was found guilty of grand theft

1338
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:23,080
&nbsp

1339
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,415
and aggravated assault after he
was caught by the Flash

1340
00:31:26,425 --> 00:31:26,417
&nbsp

1341
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:29,468
robbing the Central City Museum
earlier this year.

1342
00:31:29,478 --> 00:31:29,470
&nbsp

1343
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,919
Don't!

1344
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:38,012
&nbsp

1345
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:41,180
Please don't!

1346
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:41,182
&nbsp

1347
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:42,598
Don't do this.

1348
00:31:42,608 --> 00:31:42,600
&nbsp

1349
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:45,567
Now, finally, I am free of you.

1350
00:31:45,577 --> 00:31:45,569
&nbsp

1351
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:47,603
Barry, I love you.

1352
00:31:47,613 --> 00:31:47,605
&nbsp

1353
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:49,238
No, don't say that, all right?

1354
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,240
&nbsp

1355
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,355
You're gonna be all right.

1356
00:31:50,365 --> 00:31:50,357
&nbsp

1357
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,324
- I'm begging you, just...
- Barry!

1358
00:31:52,334 --> 00:31:52,326
&nbsp

1359
00:31:52,336 --> 00:31:55,694
You lose, Barry.

1360
00:31:55,704 --> 00:31:55,696
&nbsp

1361
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:56,829
No!

1362
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:05,206
&nbsp

1363
00:32:05,216 --> 00:32:07,289
Hey, hey, Iris.

1364
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:07,291
&nbsp

1365
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:09,007
Iris, hey...

1366
00:32:09,017 --> 00:32:11,011
&nbsp

1367
00:32:11,021 --> 00:32:13,045
No. Iris.

1368
00:32:13,055 --> 00:32:13,047
&nbsp

1369
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,880
Iris, Iris...

1370
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:28,729
&nbsp

1371
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,062
Jay?

1372
00:32:30,072 --> 00:32:30,064
&nbsp

1373
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:32,815
What the hell was that? Where was I?

1374
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:32,817
&nbsp

1375
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:34,783
The future.

1376
00:32:34,793 --> 00:32:40,598
&nbsp

1377
00:32:40,608 --> 00:32:42,148
I've never run to the future.

1378
00:32:42,158 --> 00:32:43,012
&nbsp

1379
00:32:43,022 --> 00:32:44,344
I've traveled to the past,

1380
00:32:44,354 --> 00:32:44,346
&nbsp

1381
00:32:44,356 --> 00:32:46,547
but I always came back to the present.

1382
00:32:46,557 --> 00:32:46,549
&nbsp

1383
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,798
I saw myself.

1384
00:32:47,808 --> 00:32:47,800
&nbsp

1385
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,050
And Iris.

1386
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,052
&nbsp

1387
00:32:50,062 --> 00:32:52,019
And Savitar, what...

1388
00:32:52,029 --> 00:32:52,021
&nbsp

1389
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:53,554
he killed her.

1390
00:32:53,564 --> 00:32:53,556
&nbsp

1391
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:55,722
That's five months from now.

1392
00:32:55,732 --> 00:32:55,724
&nbsp

1393
00:32:55,734 --> 00:32:57,558
Is that actually gonna happen?

1394
00:32:57,568 --> 00:32:57,560
&nbsp

1395
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,059
- I don't know.
- You don't...

1396
00:32:59,069 --> 00:32:59,061
&nbsp

1397
00:32:59,071 --> 00:33:00,527
You shouldn't have seen that.

1398
00:33:00,537 --> 00:33:02,064
&nbsp

1399
00:33:02,074 --> 00:33:03,564
This doesn't make sense, we...

1400
00:33:03,574 --> 00:33:03,566
&nbsp

1401
00:33:03,576 --> 00:33:05,816
we just got rid of the Philosopher's Stone.

1402
00:33:05,826 --> 00:33:05,818
&nbsp

1403
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:09,453
I mean, Savitar shouldn't have
even been there!

1404
00:33:09,463 --> 00:33:09,455
&nbsp

1405
00:33:09,465 --> 00:33:11,655
Oh, my God.

1406
00:33:11,665 --> 00:33:11,657
&nbsp

1407
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:15,576
This is why the newspaper
in the time vault changed.

1408
00:33:15,586 --> 00:33:15,578
&nbsp

1409
00:33:15,588 --> 00:33:18,829
The byline, this is why
it's not Iris, this...

1410
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:18,831
&nbsp

1411
00:33:18,841 --> 00:33:20,914
Iris didn't write that story anymore

1412
00:33:20,924 --> 00:33:20,916
&nbsp

1413
00:33:20,926 --> 00:33:23,500
eight years from now, because...

1414
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,588
&nbsp

1415
00:33:25,598 --> 00:33:26,637
She's dead.

1416
00:33:26,647 --> 00:33:26,639
&nbsp

1417
00:33:26,649 --> 00:33:28,388
Barry...

1418
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:28,390
&nbsp

1419
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,674
I just watched her die.

1420
00:33:30,684 --> 00:33:30,676
&nbsp

1421
00:33:30,686 --> 00:33:34,478
I saw myself try to save her,
but I wasn't fast enough.

1422
00:33:34,488 --> 00:33:34,480
&nbsp

1423
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:37,064
Jay, tell me that this isn't my destiny.

1424
00:33:37,074 --> 00:33:37,066
&nbsp

1425
00:33:37,076 --> 00:33:39,766
What you saw was one
possibility of the future.

1426
00:33:39,776 --> 00:33:39,768
&nbsp

1427
00:33:39,778 --> 00:33:41,735
What may be, or may not.

1428
00:33:41,745 --> 00:33:41,737
&nbsp

1429
00:33:41,747 --> 00:33:43,403
Okay, then I can stop this from happening.

1430
00:33:43,413 --> 00:33:43,405
&nbsp

1431
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:45,606
- I can run back there...
- You can't go back there.

1432
00:33:45,616 --> 00:33:45,608
&nbsp

1433
00:33:45,618 --> 00:33:47,574
Not again, not ever.

1434
00:33:47,584 --> 00:33:47,576
&nbsp

1435
00:33:47,586 --> 00:33:49,326
All right, then I'll figure
out exactly how it happened,

1436
00:33:49,336 --> 00:33:49,328
&nbsp

1437
00:33:49,338 --> 00:33:51,028
how we wind up on that street,

1438
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:51,030
&nbsp

1439
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,446
and I'll just make sure
that we don't go there.

1440
00:33:52,456 --> 00:33:52,448
&nbsp

1441
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:54,081
- And if we don't go there...
- Barry!

1442
00:33:54,091 --> 00:33:54,083
&nbsp

1443
00:33:54,093 --> 00:33:56,617
This is why speedsters
don't travel to the future.

1444
00:33:56,627 --> 00:33:56,619
&nbsp

1445
00:33:56,629 --> 00:33:59,336
Nobody should know this much
about their own.

1446
00:33:59,346 --> 00:33:59,338
&nbsp

1447
00:33:59,348 --> 00:34:02,589
Just as their are infinite
Earths in the multiverse,

1448
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:02,591
&nbsp

1449
00:34:02,601 --> 00:34:05,125
there are infinite possibilities
to the future.

1450
00:34:05,135 --> 00:34:05,127
&nbsp

1451
00:34:05,137 --> 00:34:07,461
It's always bending, always changing.

1452
00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:07,463
&nbsp

1453
00:34:07,473 --> 00:34:11,298
Every decision you make
creates another alternative.

1454
00:34:11,308 --> 00:34:11,300
&nbsp

1455
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,350
I won't let Iris die.

1456
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,352
&nbsp

1457
00:34:13,362 --> 00:34:15,435
The future isn't written yet.

1458
00:34:15,445 --> 00:34:15,437
&nbsp

1459
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:18,188
And it might not even turn out
to be what you saw.

1460
00:34:18,198 --> 00:34:18,190
&nbsp

1461
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,193
You need to focus on the here and now.

1462
00:34:23,203 --> 00:34:23,195
&nbsp

1463
00:34:23,205 --> 00:34:24,978
You have to live your life.

1464
00:34:24,988 --> 00:34:30,736
&nbsp

1465
00:34:30,746 --> 00:34:32,819
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

1466
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:32,821
&nbsp

1467
00:34:32,831 --> 00:34:34,988
Are you okay?
You and Jay disappeared, and...

1468
00:34:34,998 --> 00:34:34,990
&nbsp

1469
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,623
Nah, I'm okay.

1470
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:36,625
&nbsp

1471
00:34:36,635 --> 00:34:39,576
- I'm just glad to see you.
- So where's Jay?

1472
00:34:39,586 --> 00:34:39,578
&nbsp

1473
00:34:39,588 --> 00:34:42,412
Jay, uh, decided to
go ahead and go back to Earth-3.

1474
00:34:42,422 --> 00:34:42,414
&nbsp

1475
00:34:42,424 --> 00:34:46,717
But he wanted to wish everybody
a Merry Christmas.

1476
00:34:46,727 --> 00:34:46,719
&nbsp

1477
00:34:46,729 --> 00:34:48,719
So, it worked? The stone...

1478
00:34:48,729 --> 00:34:48,721
&nbsp

1479
00:34:48,731 --> 00:34:50,637
It's gone.

1480
00:34:50,647 --> 00:34:50,639
&nbsp

1481
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:53,724
- It's lost in the Speed Force.
- Good, good.

1482
00:34:53,734 --> 00:34:53,726
&nbsp

1483
00:34:53,736 --> 00:34:55,842
I don't know about you guys,
but being mind-punked

1484
00:34:55,852 --> 00:34:55,844
&nbsp

1485
00:34:55,854 --> 00:34:57,978
by a speed god that we
piss off in the future,

1486
00:34:57,988 --> 00:34:57,980
&nbsp

1487
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:01,431
it's... it's enough to kill
your Christmas spirit.

1488
00:35:01,441 --> 00:35:01,433
&nbsp

1489
00:35:01,443 --> 00:35:04,101
Guys, Christmas time is here.

1490
00:35:04,111 --> 00:35:04,103
&nbsp

1491
00:35:04,113 --> 00:35:05,686
We need a little Christmas.

1492
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:05,688
&nbsp

1493
00:35:05,698 --> 00:35:07,571
Right this very minute. Who's with me?

1494
00:35:07,581 --> 00:35:07,573
&nbsp

1495
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:10,190
- BA.
- Well, he's right.

1496
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,192
&nbsp

1497
00:35:10,202 --> 00:35:11,775
It's Christmas, we should be together.

1498
00:35:11,785 --> 00:35:11,777
&nbsp

1499
00:35:11,787 --> 00:35:13,110
Let's have it.

1500
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,112
&nbsp

1501
00:35:13,122 --> 00:35:14,695
I'm still in if everybody else is.

1502
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:14,697
&nbsp

1503
00:35:14,707 --> 00:35:16,363
- Yes!
- Okay, we'll be there.

1504
00:35:16,373 --> 00:35:16,365
&nbsp

1505
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:17,914
Yeah!

1506
00:35:17,924 --> 00:35:17,916
&nbsp

1507
00:35:17,926 --> 00:35:19,583
Julian...

1508
00:35:19,593 --> 00:35:20,813
&nbsp

1509
00:35:20,823 --> 00:35:22,064
Where's he going?

1510
00:35:22,074 --> 00:35:23,372
&nbsp

1511
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:25,706
Hey, where are you going?

1512
00:35:25,716 --> 00:35:28,377
&nbsp

1513
00:35:28,387 --> 00:35:29,926
Do you have Christmas plans?

1514
00:35:29,936 --> 00:35:29,928
&nbsp

1515
00:35:29,938 --> 00:35:33,180
The West's are having
a Christmas get-together.

1516
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,182
&nbsp

1517
00:35:33,192 --> 00:35:35,932
After what you've been through,
you shouldn't be alone.

1518
00:35:35,942 --> 00:35:37,436
&nbsp

1519
00:35:37,446 --> 00:35:39,219
I actually prefer to be alone at Christmas.

1520
00:35:39,229 --> 00:35:46,695
&nbsp

1521
00:35:46,705 --> 00:35:48,028
Rain on Christmas.

1522
00:35:48,038 --> 00:35:48,030
&nbsp

1523
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,031
That's neither holly nor jolly.

1524
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:51,033
&nbsp

1525
00:35:51,043 --> 00:35:53,233
Hey, listen, um...

1526
00:35:53,243 --> 00:35:53,235
&nbsp

1527
00:35:53,245 --> 00:35:55,736
about Dante.

1528
00:35:55,746 --> 00:35:55,738
&nbsp

1529
00:35:55,748 --> 00:35:57,904
Thank you for talking me off the ledge.

1530
00:35:57,914 --> 00:35:57,906
&nbsp

1531
00:35:57,916 --> 00:36:00,073
Of course, you'd do the same for me.

1532
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:00,075
&nbsp

1533
00:36:00,085 --> 00:36:02,292
In fact, you did the same for me.

1534
00:36:02,302 --> 00:36:02,294
&nbsp

1535
00:36:02,304 --> 00:36:03,577
I was gonna say.

1536
00:36:03,587 --> 00:36:03,579
&nbsp

1537
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:05,912
Caitlo... Caitlo, Ciscan...

1538
00:36:05,922 --> 00:36:05,914
&nbsp

1539
00:36:05,924 --> 00:36:08,999
okay... whoo... you got to try the eggnog

1540
00:36:09,009 --> 00:36:09,001
&nbsp

1541
00:36:09,011 --> 00:36:11,918
a holiday concoction done by Joe

1542
00:36:11,928 --> 00:36:11,920
&nbsp

1543
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,970
and his hot girlfriend...

1544
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:13,972
&nbsp

1545
00:36:13,982 --> 00:36:15,972
Babe.

1546
00:36:15,982 --> 00:36:15,974
&nbsp

1547
00:36:15,984 --> 00:36:17,641
- Hey.
- What's up?

1548
00:36:17,651 --> 00:36:17,643
&nbsp

1549
00:36:17,653 --> 00:36:20,477
- Nothing.
- You seem a little weird.

1550
00:36:20,487 --> 00:36:20,479
&nbsp

1551
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:23,146
No?

1552
00:36:23,156 --> 00:36:23,148
&nbsp

1553
00:36:23,158 --> 00:36:25,182
You do know we won, right?

1554
00:36:25,192 --> 00:36:25,184
&nbsp

1555
00:36:25,194 --> 00:36:27,434
We defeated the bad guy.

1556
00:36:27,444 --> 00:36:27,436
&nbsp

1557
00:36:27,446 --> 00:36:29,519
- Yeah, I know.
- Okay.

1558
00:36:29,529 --> 00:36:29,521
&nbsp

1559
00:36:29,531 --> 00:36:32,355
- Grandma Esther.
- Grandma Millie.

1560
00:36:32,365 --> 00:36:32,357
&nbsp

1561
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:34,157
Let's see.

1562
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:36,195
&nbsp

1563
00:36:36,205 --> 00:36:37,360
Mm.

1564
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:37,362
&nbsp

1565
00:36:37,372 --> 00:36:38,745
- Damn, that's strong.
- Oh!

1566
00:36:38,755 --> 00:36:38,747
&nbsp

1567
00:36:38,757 --> 00:36:41,248
So is that, my God!

1568
00:36:41,258 --> 00:36:41,250
&nbsp

1569
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,616
Our grandmothers are alcoholics.

1570
00:36:42,626 --> 00:36:42,618
&nbsp

1571
00:36:42,628 --> 00:36:46,203
Yes.

1572
00:36:46,213 --> 00:36:46,205
&nbsp

1573
00:36:46,215 --> 00:36:48,955
You know, technically,
we don't have to be standing

1574
00:36:48,965 --> 00:36:48,957
&nbsp

1575
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:51,424
under the mistletoe to... mm.

1576
00:36:51,434 --> 00:36:54,346
&nbsp

1577
00:36:54,356 --> 00:36:56,797
Finally.

1578
00:36:56,807 --> 00:36:56,799
&nbsp

1579
00:36:56,809 --> 00:36:58,632
No comments from the peanut gallery.

1580
00:36:58,642 --> 00:36:58,634
&nbsp

1581
00:36:58,644 --> 00:37:00,300
No, but really, it's about time.

1582
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:00,302
&nbsp

1583
00:37:00,312 --> 00:37:01,685
Mm-hmm.

1584
00:37:01,695 --> 00:37:04,106
&nbsp

1585
00:37:04,116 --> 00:37:06,306
Hold on.

1586
00:37:06,316 --> 00:37:06,308
&nbsp

1587
00:37:06,318 --> 00:37:08,225
And it's my daughter.

1588
00:37:08,235 --> 00:37:08,227
&nbsp

1589
00:37:08,237 --> 00:37:10,193
ah, just give me a quick minute,

1590
00:37:10,203 --> 00:37:10,195
&nbsp

1591
00:37:10,205 --> 00:37:12,979
and then we can... yeah.

1592
00:37:12,989 --> 00:37:12,981
&nbsp

1593
00:37:12,991 --> 00:37:14,114
- Hey, kiddo...
- Joe.

1594
00:37:14,124 --> 00:37:14,116
&nbsp

1595
00:37:14,126 --> 00:37:15,365
I saw you kiss her, good job.

1596
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:17,202
&nbsp

1597
00:37:17,212 --> 00:37:18,985
We're... oh, that's right, the thing.

1598
00:37:18,995 --> 00:37:18,987
&nbsp

1599
00:37:18,997 --> 00:37:20,370
BA, hey.

1600
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:20,372
&nbsp

1601
00:37:20,382 --> 00:37:22,155
How many of those have you had?

1602
00:37:22,165 --> 00:37:22,157
&nbsp

1603
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:23,957
- B... where'd you go? Here.
- I'm right here.

1604
00:37:23,967 --> 00:37:23,959
&nbsp

1605
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:24,991
Oh, I see ya.

1606
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:24,993
&nbsp

1607
00:37:25,003 --> 00:37:26,793
Now that Cecelia's away,

1608
00:37:26,803 --> 00:37:26,795
&nbsp

1609
00:37:26,805 --> 00:37:30,664
this is from all of us to you.

1610
00:37:30,674 --> 00:37:30,666
&nbsp

1611
00:37:30,676 --> 00:37:31,665
Merry Christmas, son.

1612
00:37:31,675 --> 00:37:36,338
&nbsp

1613
00:37:36,348 --> 00:37:38,839
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, man, it's time.

1614
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:38,841
&nbsp

1615
00:37:38,851 --> 00:37:41,057
You're ready, Wallace.

1616
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:41,059
&nbsp

1617
00:37:41,069 --> 00:37:42,809
Welcome to the team.

1618
00:37:42,819 --> 00:37:42,811
&nbsp

1619
00:37:42,821 --> 00:37:44,594
Kid Flash.

1620
00:37:44,604 --> 00:37:44,596
&nbsp

1621
00:37:44,606 --> 00:37:46,680
Are we really calling me "Kid Flash"?

1622
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:46,682
&nbsp

1623
00:37:46,692 --> 00:37:48,148
Yeah, I think we are.

1624
00:37:48,158 --> 00:37:48,150
&nbsp

1625
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,066
- Kid Flash!
- Shh!

1626
00:37:50,076 --> 00:37:51,069
&nbsp

1627
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:52,652
- Police!
- I got it.

1628
00:37:52,662 --> 00:37:52,654
&nbsp

1629
00:37:52,664 --> 00:37:54,187
It's not the police. We're the police.

1630
00:37:54,197 --> 00:37:54,189
&nbsp

1631
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:57,741
- You're the police!
- Calm down.

1632
00:37:57,751 --> 00:37:57,743
&nbsp

1633
00:37:57,753 --> 00:37:59,576
Hey, Julian.

1634
00:37:59,586 --> 00:37:59,578
&nbsp

1635
00:37:59,588 --> 00:38:00,261
- Hi.
- Come on in.

1636
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:00,294
&nbsp

1637
00:38:00,304 --> 00:38:02,043
- Here, let me get that.
- Thanks.

1638
00:38:02,053 --> 00:38:02,045
&nbsp

1639
00:38:02,055 --> 00:38:04,095
Uh, after everything that happened,

1640
00:38:04,105 --> 00:38:04,097
&nbsp

1641
00:38:04,107 --> 00:38:06,431
being alone felt a bit lonely, so...

1642
00:38:06,441 --> 00:38:06,433
&nbsp

1643
00:38:06,443 --> 00:38:08,967
- Yeah.
- This is for you.

1644
00:38:08,977 --> 00:38:08,969
&nbsp

1645
00:38:08,979 --> 00:38:10,719
What's this?

1646
00:38:10,729 --> 00:38:10,721
&nbsp

1647
00:38:10,731 --> 00:38:12,470
I spoke to Captain Singh,
and he hadn't put through

1648
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:12,472
&nbsp

1649
00:38:12,482 --> 00:38:14,222
your resignation paperwork yet, so...

1650
00:38:14,232 --> 00:38:14,224
&nbsp

1651
00:38:14,234 --> 00:38:18,143
well, if you'd, uh, you know,
like your old lab back,

1652
00:38:18,153 --> 00:38:18,145
&nbsp

1653
00:38:18,155 --> 00:38:21,980
or you'd like to share it again.

1654
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:21,982
&nbsp

1655
00:38:21,992 --> 00:38:23,815
Thanks, Julian.

1656
00:38:23,825 --> 00:38:23,817
&nbsp

1657
00:38:23,827 --> 00:38:25,950
Merry Christmas, man.

1658
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:25,952
&nbsp

1659
00:38:25,962 --> 00:38:27,902
- Cheers, mate.
- Yeah, thank you.

1660
00:38:27,912 --> 00:38:27,904
&nbsp

1661
00:38:27,914 --> 00:38:29,654
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1662
00:38:29,664 --> 00:38:29,656
&nbsp

1663
00:38:29,666 --> 00:38:32,207
- Can I offer you some eggnog?
- I'd love some, yeah.

1664
00:38:32,217 --> 00:38:32,209
&nbsp

1665
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:34,292
Happy Christmas, everyone.

1666
00:38:34,302 --> 00:38:34,294
&nbsp

1667
00:38:34,304 --> 00:38:35,660
- I'm glad you came.
- Thank you, yeah.

1668
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,665
&nbsp

1669
00:38:38,675 --> 00:38:40,298
- Do you hear that?
- It's outside.

1670
00:38:40,308 --> 00:38:53,013
&nbsp

1671
00:38:53,023 --> 00:38:54,679
Caroling in the rain.

1672
00:38:54,689 --> 00:38:54,681
&nbsp

1673
00:38:54,691 --> 00:38:57,565
That sucks.

1674
00:38:57,575 --> 00:39:00,487
&nbsp

1675
00:39:00,497 --> 00:39:02,153
Hey.

1676
00:39:02,163 --> 00:39:02,155
&nbsp

1677
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:03,905
- What're you doing?
- It's okay, I got this.

1678
00:39:03,915 --> 00:39:03,907
&nbsp

1679
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:06,024
We may not be able to have
a perfect Christmas,

1680
00:39:06,034 --> 00:39:06,026
&nbsp

1681
00:39:06,036 --> 00:39:08,193
but we can have a white one.

1682
00:39:08,203 --> 00:39:16,787
&nbsp

1683
00:39:16,797 --> 00:39:18,753
So.

1684
00:39:18,763 --> 00:39:18,755
&nbsp

1685
00:39:18,765 --> 00:39:21,039
When are we gonna exchange presents?

1686
00:39:21,049 --> 00:39:21,041
&nbsp

1687
00:39:21,051 --> 00:39:22,874
How 'bout right now?

1688
00:39:22,884 --> 00:39:22,876
&nbsp

1689
00:39:22,886 --> 00:39:24,542
- Okay.
- Follow me.

1690
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:24,544
&nbsp

1691
00:39:24,554 --> 00:39:26,211
- Okay.
- Let's get out of here.

1692
00:39:26,221 --> 00:39:28,348
&nbsp

1693
00:39:28,358 --> 00:39:30,882
Okay, going through a door, be careful.

1694
00:39:30,892 --> 00:39:30,884
&nbsp

1695
00:39:30,894 --> 00:39:34,219
Okay, right here.

1696
00:39:34,229 --> 00:39:34,221
&nbsp

1697
00:39:34,231 --> 00:39:36,805
- Okay, are you ready?
- Yeah.

1698
00:39:36,815 --> 00:39:36,807
&nbsp

1699
00:39:36,817 --> 00:39:38,390
All right.

1700
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:38,392
&nbsp

1701
00:39:38,402 --> 00:39:39,974
Open your eyes...

1702
00:39:39,984 --> 00:39:39,976
&nbsp

1703
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:41,226
now.

1704
00:39:41,236 --> 00:39:47,117
&nbsp

1705
00:39:47,127 --> 00:39:50,618
I... I don't understand, where are we?

1706
00:39:50,628 --> 00:39:50,620
&nbsp

1707
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,036
Home.

1708
00:39:52,046 --> 00:39:56,543
&nbsp

1709
00:39:56,553 --> 00:39:58,126
What?

1710
00:39:58,136 --> 00:39:58,128
&nbsp

1711
00:39:58,138 --> 00:40:00,795
I couldn't sleep on Cisco's couch anymore,

1712
00:40:00,805 --> 00:40:00,797
&nbsp

1713
00:40:00,807 --> 00:40:04,249
and your place is sort of small for two,

1714
00:40:04,259 --> 00:40:04,251
&nbsp

1715
00:40:04,261 --> 00:40:06,418
so I signed a lease

1716
00:40:06,428 --> 00:40:06,420
&nbsp

1717
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:09,671
and I put both of our names on it.

1718
00:40:09,681 --> 00:40:11,758
&nbsp

1719
00:40:11,768 --> 00:40:13,925
I got you a wallet.

1720
00:40:13,935 --> 00:40:13,927
&nbsp

1721
00:40:13,937 --> 00:40:16,811
I'm sure I'll love it.

1722
00:40:16,821 --> 00:40:16,813
&nbsp

1723
00:40:16,823 --> 00:40:19,931
Barry, this is a big step.

1724
00:40:19,941 --> 00:40:19,933
&nbsp

1725
00:40:19,943 --> 00:40:21,149
Not for me.

1726
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:25,739
&nbsp

1727
00:40:25,749 --> 00:40:29,908
I don't know what's
gonna happen in the future.

1728
00:40:29,918 --> 00:40:29,910
&nbsp

1729
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,693
All I know is, right here, right now,

1730
00:40:31,703 --> 00:40:31,695
&nbsp

1731
00:40:31,705 --> 00:40:34,446
I want to spend every moment I can with you.

1732
00:40:34,456 --> 00:40:34,448
&nbsp

1733
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:37,615
You're the first thing I
want to see when I wake up.

1734
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:37,617
&nbsp

1735
00:40:37,627 --> 00:40:39,417
And the last thing...

1736
00:40:39,427 --> 00:40:45,041
&nbsp

1737
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:47,292
I love you, Barry Allen.

1738
00:40:47,302 --> 00:40:47,294
&nbsp

1739
00:40:47,304 --> 00:40:49,177
I love you, Iris West.

1740
00:40:49,187 --> 00:40:54,187
