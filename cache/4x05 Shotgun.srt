1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,592
Say you understand.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,358
You understand?

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,154
Tell me you understand, Saul!

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,033
Every dollar. If you don't hear from me in 24 hours -

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,518
No, look. Shut- Saul. Saul, shut up. Shut up and listen to me.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,509
I want you to give her every dollar.
I don't care if you stuff it in trash bags.

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,269
Just make sure she gets everything.
All right? Just make it happen.

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,719
Hi. You've reached the White family. Please leave a message.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,560
Hey. It's me.

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,428
I...

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,873
I just wanted to say that I was
thinking about you and the kids, and...

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,438
I love you.

13
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,189
Hello, would you like...

14
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,868
...to try our breakfast chicken chalupa combo meal?

15
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,308
Gus Fring.

16
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,555
Excuse me?

17
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,594
Gustavo Fring, your boss, now. Please.

18
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,394
- Mr. Fring isn't here right now. Is-?
- He's here.

19
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,875
His car is parked out front. He's here.

20
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,513
He was here. Mr. Fring was -

21
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,474
You just go in the back and you tell
him it's Walter White. Understand?

22
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,831
He'll know what it's about.

23
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,392
I'll wait.

24
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,437
Yeah, let me get a chalupa special.

25
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,635
Hello?

26
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,912
Walter, what exactly are you doing?

27
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,395
Where is Jesse?

28
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,636
Jesse's with me. He's fine.

29
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,796
What, do you expect me to just believe that?

30
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,036
I'm crossing my heart, Walter.

31
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,391
- Where is he?
- Hold on.

32
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,518
- Yo.
- Jesse?

33
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,994
Yeah. What's up?

34
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,954
- Jesse, where are you?
- With Mike.

35
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,472
I know you're with Mike.

36
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,069
Are you all right? Does he have a gun on you?

37
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,079
No.

38
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,794
What's going on, then?

39
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,468
- We're driving.
- Driving.

40
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,793
Driving where?

41
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,397
I don't know.

42
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,869
North.

43
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,149
Why is he driving you? Where is he going?

44
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,998
Beats me.

45
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,035
I don't- Put Mike back on.

46
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,872
Hello again.

47
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,152
Mike, tell me now exactly what is going on.

48
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,349
Jesse's with me today.

49
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,836
So, what you need to do is go back
to your lab and get on with the cook.

50
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,508
You're gonna have to muddle through this without him.

51
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,314
- That's what's going on.
- But it doesn't -

52
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,318
- Goodbye, Walter.
- Mike -

53
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,553
Sir.

54
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,479
Excuse me. Hey. You're not allowed back there.

55
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,715
Excuse me, sir.

56
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,155
As I said, sir, Mr. Fring is not here.
This area is for employees only.

57
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,954
I have to ask that you leave immediately.

58
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,673
What you told Mr. White, that's...

59
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,799
It's just bullshit, right?

60
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,748
What, you figure on just leaving me in some ditch?

61
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,078
What do you care?

62
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,791
I don't.

63
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,513
But I'll tell you now, you better shoot straight, old man...

64
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,156
...or I'll slice off your other ear before this is over.

65
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,873
You coming?

66
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,717
We gotta do this six more times today
with a lot of miles in between.

67
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,753
I'd like to finish before dark.

68
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,278
This freaking guy, I tell you what.

69
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,632
It's like Scarface had sex with Mr. Rogers or something.

70
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,399
Who does this, you know?

71
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,875
Your boy Heisenberg, thought we had him already.

72
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,832
Yeah. Keep dreaming.

73
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,315
Yeah, no. Getz busted him a few months back.

74
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,796
Yeah, well, no offence to Detective Doogie Howser there...

75
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,916
...but all he caught was a dipshit
lifer by the name of Jimmy In-'N-Out.

76
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,350
This one, he's your Heisenberg?

77
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,513
Yeah, I believe he is.

78
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,871
So, what are you thinking?
Rival drug gang taking out the mastermind?

79
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,675
Any names I should check out?

80
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,438
I wish I could help you there.

81
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,757
Only two people I know connected with the blue stuff.

82
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,520
One is a beanie-wearing jizz-stain...

83
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,951
...by the name of Brandon Mayhew, street name "Badger."

84
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,594
Definitely not a player.

85
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,597
And the other one...

86
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,676
...is Jesse Pinkman.

87
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,911
He and I have a history.

88
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,599
Yeah.

89
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,838
You see Pinkman as a shooter?

90
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,558
That would surprise me.

91
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,753
Well, we have a composite of a person of interest.

92
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,669
It's a guy the neighbours saw at Boetticher's place...

93
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,791
...right after the shooting.

94
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,033
- Yeah. Sorry.
- No, hang on to it, just in case.

95
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,674
We got a couple of prints we're hoping to ID.

96
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,792
If I get any kind of hit, I'll keep you in the loop on that.

97
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,194
You know...

98
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,673
...Tim, look, I appreciate what you're doing, really...

99
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,633
...you know, keeping me involved and all...

100
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,752
...but, you know, finding this guy Heisenberg dead like this...

101
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,316
...I have to say, it...

102
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,592
...kind of feels like closure to me.

103
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,509
Hank, you really are a big help here.

104
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,199
No, I know. I get it, really.

105
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,039
But I'm done.

106
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,630
You don't need to do that.

107
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,874
This is why I'm out here, right?

108
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,276
To be, like, your backup?

109
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,718
So if I'm out here in a guard-type capacity...

110
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,550
...to watch over the money, that means I need, like, a gun, right?

111
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,239
Nope.

112
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,514
I mean, isn't that, like,
idiotic for me to be out here without a gun?

113
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,029
You haven't said dick about what I'm doing here.

114
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,071
Now I'm supposed to do it without a gun?

115
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,589
How does that even make sense?

116
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,235
What? I can smoke, right?

117
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,276
Not a chance.

118
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,679
It's finally hitting me what the plan is here.

119
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,792
It's to bore me to death...

120
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,110
...so mission accomplished because it's totally working.

121
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,392
Great job.

122
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,840
You know, I really do get what's going on...

123
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,749
...with all the dead drops and bags of cash.

124
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,353
Me and my boys had the exact same
system when I was running things.

125
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,879
My crew.

126
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,152
Nowhere near the same cheese you
guys are slinging, but same theory.

127
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,955
You know, maintain separation between dealer and supplier...

128
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,071
...reduce risk...

129
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,471
...et cetera.

130
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,558
Look, don't you think it'd be good
if there was some communication here?

131
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,718
You got me riding shotgun to every dark anal recess in the state.

132
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,115
Be nice if you clued me in a little.

133
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,508
I mean, I'm here to do a job, right?

134
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,553
And, I mean, yo, like, if I'm the guy...

135
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,116
...then you should just tell me what the hell is up.

136
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,314
- What?
- You are not the guy.

137
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,069
You're not capable of being the guy. I had a guy, but now I don't.

138
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,192
You are not the guy.

139
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,594
- Then what the hell am I doing here?
- I don't know.

140
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,268
It's not my call. I just do what I'm told.

141
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,631
And now you're gonna do what you're told, which is to sit here...

142
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,709
...shut up, and stay in the car till
we finish our pickups. You got it?

143
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,071
- We having second thoughts?
- Every hour of every day.

144
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,874
Let me tell you, that is perfectly normal.

145
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,957
But your expectations are realistic.

146
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,914
You have a good, solid business plan. I'm feeling very confident.

147
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,395
You have an excellent shot at making this work.

148
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,073
Walt?

149
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,032
Are you good?

150
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,999
Yeah.

151
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,952
All right.

152
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,270
Well, my congratulations to the both of you.

153
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,311
Thank you very much, Alan.

154
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,670
It is my pleasure.

155
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,958
Mr. White.

156
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,555
- Best of luck.
- Thank you.

157
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,117
I'm bringing the car over first
thing next week for a wash and wax.

158
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,515
- We'll be looking for you.
- I'll be there.

159
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,278
- Thank you again.
- You're welcome.

160
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,277
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

161
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,991
It's official.

162
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,954
How are you feeling?

163
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,318
I'm...

164
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,392
Well, I'm- How do you feel?

165
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,311
Nervous.

166
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,191
Scared.

167
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,032
This is a big step, Walt.

168
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,231
If we don't do this right -

169
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,714
We'll be fine.

170
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,639
We will?

171
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,519
Tell me again.

172
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,591
We will be fine. Believe it.

173
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,430
If we're gonna do this, I mean, really gonna do this...

174
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,313
...then we have to promise each other...

175
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,392
...no more secrets.

176
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,592
There can't be any mistakes like before.

177
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,439
There has to be complete honesty.

178
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,918
I'm all for that.

179
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,793
Good.

180
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,391
Well, then...

181
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,955
...how about a drink to celebrate?

182
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,958
- Well -
- Well, we own a big-ass car wash now.

183
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,879
We do. I guess that merits a celebration.

184
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,308
Nothing too expensive.

185
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,956
- Right. Right. Non-fancy liquor it is.
- Yes.

186
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,072
Just as long as it gets the job done.

187
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,396
It's me.

188
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,038
I just wanted to say that I was
thinking about you and the kids, and...

189
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,432
I love you.

190
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,309
- Okay.
- Okay.

191
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,717
- Just take it off. Just take it off.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

192
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,111
The sheets, they smell different than I remember.

193
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,313
Don't they?

194
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,035
New fabric softener.

195
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,557
Yeah, I like it.

196
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,716
I also got a new haircut.

197
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,310
- Don't know if you -
- Oh, yes, I was gonna say something.

198
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,988
Were you, really?

199
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,317
I do like it.

200
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,353
Thanks.

201
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,919
So...

202
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,391
...dinner tomorrow night?

203
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,115
I told Marie that we'd come over and eat with them.

204
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,953
Think maybe you'll be free?

205
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,158
Yeah.

206
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,395
Yeah, we can do that. That'll be nice.

207
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,999
Good.

208
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,078
Marie says it's about the only thing
that'll get Hank out of his room.

209
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,197
Mom?

210
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,956
- Hey, Mom? Dad?
- Hey, son.

211
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,951
Where are you?

212
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,630
We're back here. We'll be out in a minute.

213
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,110
Oh, God.

214
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,470
- Seriously?
- I'm parked in the driveway.

215
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,231
This is going to make for some very
interesting dinner conversation.

216
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,437
He is definitely gonna ask about our living situation now.

217
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,272
Maybe...

218
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,034
Maybe you should move back in.

219
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,836
You know, just so it's easier to explain to everyone.

220
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,392
You think?

221
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,071
I have to get back to work.

222
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,750
You know, schedule.

223
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,518
Yeah.

224
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,193
Damn it.

225
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,549
Hey!

226
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,230
Hey! This is a two-man job. I can't do it alone.

227
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,475
I'm done. That's it.

228
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,070
Finished. Nothing else happens until I get my partner back.

229
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,279
Jesse?

230
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,352
Where is Jesse?

231
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,358
I need him. You people have me down here...

232
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,950
...trying to complete a two-man operation by myself.

233
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,073
It's unacceptable. It's dangerous and counterproductive.

234
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,513
Jesse operates the forklift, not me.

235
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,553
That's one of the many, many things he does around the lab...

236
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,955
...that keeps us on schedule, so I suggest...

237
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,549
...that you get him back down here as soon as you -

238
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,910
Are you listening to me?

239
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,075
Hello?

240
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,756
Where do you want it?

241
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,476
This is it, right? Last stop?

242
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,272
Last stop?

243
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,151
Hey, I've been counting, yo. No more pickups after -

244
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:36,153
Yeah. I'm gonna need to be picked up. Now.

245
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:42,111
Garcia's on Central. Honk once. I'll meet you in the parking lot.

246
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,995
Cancel that.

247
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,952
Hey, this dude -

248
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,948
This dude was coming right at me with a shotgun.

249
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,948
They blocked the alley and they were
gonna rip us off. I didn't have a choice.

250
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:13,188
I had to put it in reverse, slam into the guy's car, and just -

251
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,752
I saw.

252
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,313
You saw.

253
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,719
Jesus.

254
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,678
I just -

255
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,918
I don't know.

256
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,076
Go ahead, kid.

257
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,958
Smoke up.

258
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,439
Morning.

259
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,710
Hey. Good morning, son.

260
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,031
You want me to pour you some juice?

261
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,194
I'll take a coffee.

262
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,996
Didn't know you started drinking coffee.

263
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,832
Yeah. I also started tying my own shoelaces too, all by myself.

264
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,315
Go grab a mug.

265
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,756
Milk? Sugar?

266
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,151
Just black.

267
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,874
Black. I like it.

268
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:57,036
Hey, Dad, I just gotta say...

269
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,359
I just wanted to say it's really cool to have you here.

270
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,438
Thank you, son.

271
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,915
It's cool to be back home.

272
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,992
It just feels...

273
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:14,239
Mom said you're moving back in this Tuesday.

274
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,872
She...?

275
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,037
She said that?

276
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,878
Yeah.

277
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,357
Tuesday, is it?

278
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,636
How about that?

279
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,673
Jesse. Jesse.

280
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,994
Yo, what's up?

281
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,792
What are you doing?

282
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,909
- Breaking ice.
- I mean, what are you doing here?

283
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,510
- Where's your car?
- Mike dropped me off.

284
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,472
Jesse.

285
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,631
Jesse!

286
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,996
What happened yesterday? Where were you?

287
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,430
I was out with Mike, helped him make pickups.

288
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,552
- Picking up what?
- Cash. Dead drops.

289
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,275
Mike made the pickups and I guarded him.

290
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,993
You...

291
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,389
...guarded Mike?

292
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,589
What is this, a joke?

293
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,758
Hey, know what? Two dudes tried to rob us and I saved the stash.

294
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,112
I took care of business, just like I'm
taking care of business right now.

295
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,074
You wanna stand there dicking around,
or you wanna suit up and get to work?

296
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,549
Get in gear, yo, because I'm meeting up with Mike this afternoon.

297
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,478
What, again? Why?

298
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,514
Guess I have two jobs now.

299
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,798
Los Pollos Hermanos, can I take your order?

300
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,154
Any injuries?

301
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,670
Twisted ankle, nothing too bad.

302
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,557
It all went like you thought it would, more or less.

303
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,068
I will, of course, reimburse you for the damage to your vehicles.

304
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,318
Questions?

305
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,110
More than a few, yeah.

306
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,072
But I know better than to ask.

307
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,592
Anyway...

308
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,111
...just like you wanted.

309
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,515
The kid's a hero.

310
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,591
Just the idea of owning a car wash
seems so daunting, but I have to...

311
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,076
Who is just the most beautiful little girl in the world? You.

312
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,794
So coming into a business that's up and running...

313
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,117
...fully operational, puts us way ahead of the game.

314
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,709
We're gonna still have some changeover time.

315
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,319
We'll have to hire some people.

316
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,909
But we do have a staff in place, so, you know...

317
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,112
...we'll be able to hold on to most of Bogdan's employees.

318
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,551
We might lose a few to the UltraWash across town, though.

319
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,910
They're making a grab, I hear.

320
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,156
- Gonna put the kid to work?
- I've got school.

321
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,239
Not you. I'm talking about your baby sister.
I wouldn't let you near my car.

322
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,636
Hey, that's not a bad idea, you guys.

323
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,191
You should put Holly on the sign.

324
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,837
- Like a mascot?
- Like the Gerber baby.

325
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,157
I would get my car washed there if I saw her face out front.

326
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,315
What about me?

327
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,149
The goal is to bring customers in, not scare them away, so...

328
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,957
Walt, there's another bottle in the kitchen. Just help yourself.

329
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,559
Good.

330
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,795
Maybe we could roll Uncle Hank through the car wash.

331
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,150
He could be the first customer.

332
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,512
The wipe-down crew would clean you up good.

333
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,432
I got your wipe-down right here.

334
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,633
Hank, can we get through one meal
without you grabbing your crotch?

335
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,389
So, what are you gonna do with Holly?
You can't take her to work...

336
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,309
...with all those chemicals and migrants hanging around.

337
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,592
- Marie -
- What? That can't be safe.

338
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,314
Fortunately, five minutes from the car wash...

339
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,751
...there is the top child-care centre in the city.

340
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,997
The National Child Care Association gives it high ratings.

341
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,637
So that's a huge relief and, you know,
we could walk there if we had to.

342
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:04,789
Sky, I gotta tell you, I'm just - I'm really, really impressed.

343
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,075
You came together on this.
I'm happy that it's working out for you.

344
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,636
It's been a little scary, but it needed to be done.

345
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,831
And we get possession of the keys tomorrow.

346
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,554
Oh, that's awesome.

347
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,036
I can't wait to see what kind of car
I'm going to get for my birthday...

348
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,992
...now with all this money rolling in.

349
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,919
You've been spending too much time around your Uncle Hank.

350
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,873
The squeaky wheel gets the grease. Right, Uncle Hank?

351
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,958
Squeaky and greasy. That's you, my friend.

352
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,916
Hey, Nick the Greek, you gonna share that bottle or what?

353
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,348
Yeah. Sorry.

354
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,913
Who's Nick the Greek?

355
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,076
He's a famous big-time card player.

356
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,679
Hank, that's not funny.

357
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,189
- What? It's a compliment.
- That's even worse, then.

358
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,638
You're giving positive reinforcement...

359
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,958
...to behaviour that Walt is working very, very hard to change.

360
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,072
- Right, Skyler?
- Yeah.

361
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,272
I don't see how it's bad. Dad's raking in the beaucoup bucks.

362
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,870
You know, I just think maybe we could change the subject?

363
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,719
Yeah. Sure. You know. Absolutely.

364
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,639
Hey, Uncle Hank, what about that case you were looking at...

365
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,274
...with that crazy singing guy?

366
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,713
I'm off that. I gave my assessment to A.P.D. I'm done.

367
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,309
The case of the crazy singing guy.

368
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,272
Sounds like an Encyclopedia Brown story.

369
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,109
Crazy is the wrong word.

370
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,474
This guy, Gale Boetticher, he was eccentric.

371
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:34,152
A real character, you know? He's dead now.

372
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,832
- Who was he?
- He was a meth cook.

373
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,917
He was a meth chef.

374
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:45,240
I mean, we're talking five stars. Candles and white tablecloth.

375
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,830
Hey, I can't believe these words are gonna come out of my mouth...

376
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,272
...but he was a genius, plain and simple.

377
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,031
I mean, boy, if he had applied that
big brain of his to something good...

378
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,038
...who knows, he could've helped humanity or something.

379
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:05,677
I mean, how many actual geniuses are there in the world, right?

380
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,350
If he'd kind of taken his life in
a different direction, who knows?

381
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,232
Hank...

382
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:16,714
...not to tell you your business, but I'm not sure I agree.

383
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,478
- What do you mean?
- Well, I mean...

384
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,275
...you showed me that notebook, and from what I saw -

385
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,516
And this is just my humble opinion.

386
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,757
From what I saw on those papers...

387
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,311
Genius?

388
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,152
Not so much.

389
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:37,315
I mean, there was no reasoning, no deductions in those pages.

390
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,637
So to my eye, all his brilliance...

391
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,399
...looks like nothing more than just simple rote copying.

392
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,957
Probably of someone else's work.

393
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,874
Believe me, I have been around enough students to know.

394
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,395
This genius of yours...

395
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,909
...maybe he's still out there.

396
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,918
- Hank.
- Hey, babe.

397
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,071
Tim stopped by. He brought over some file boxes on that case.

398
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,316
- Thought I'd take another peek.
- That's great.

399
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,753
Sorry about the mess.

400
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,155
No, no, no. Don't be.

401
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,191
You want me to make some coffee?

402
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,879
Yeah.

403
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,838
Yeah, that'd be good.

404
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,394
You find something?

405
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,195
Oh, just this guy I'm looking at.

406
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,672
You know, everything he buys and eats...

407
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:26,078
...is organic, fair trade, vegan.

408
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,477
Since when do vegans eat fried chicken?
