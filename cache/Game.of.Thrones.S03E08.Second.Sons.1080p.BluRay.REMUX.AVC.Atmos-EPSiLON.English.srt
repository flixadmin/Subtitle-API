00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,156
I'll give you one try, girl.

2
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:39,910
Kill me and you're free.

3
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,456
But if I live, I'll break both your hands.

4
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,793
Go on, hit me.

5
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:50,254
Hit me hard.

6
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:01,515
Sulk all you want.

7
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:05,061
The truth is, you're lucky.

8
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:09,273
You don't want to be alone out here, girl.

9
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,942
Someone worse than me would find you.

10
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,861
There's no one worse than you.

11
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,280
(SCOFFS) You never knew my brother.

12
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,741
He once killed a man for snoring.

13
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,202
There's plenty worse than me.

14
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:25,873
There's men who like to beat little
girls, men who like to rape them.

15
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,626
I saved your sister from some of them.

16
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,295
You're lying.

17
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,214
Ask her, if you ever see her again.

18
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:37,635
Ask her who came back
for her when the mob had her on her back.

19
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,014
They would have taken her every which way

20
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,475
and left her there with her throat cut open.

21
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:51,482
Is that the Blackwater?

22

The Blackwater?

23
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,195
Where do you think I'm taking you?

24
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,283
Back to King's Landing,
to Joffrey and the Queen.

25
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,911
Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the Queen.

26
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:08,124
That's the Red Fork.
I'm taking you to the Twins.

27
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,293
But why?

28
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:16,382
Your mother and brother will be
there, and they'll pay me for you.

29
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,678
Why would they be at the Twins?

(LAUGHS) Those outlaws
you love so much never told you?

The whole countryside is yapping about it.

32
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:31,689
Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls.

33
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,233
So quit trying to bash my skull in,

34
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:38,362
and we might
just make it there in time for the wedding.

You know these men?

Only by the broken swords on their banners.

42
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:11,687
They're called the Second Sons.

43
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,817
A company led by
a Braavosi named Mero, the Titan's Bastard.

44
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,695
Is he more titan or bastard?

45
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:23,574
He's a dangerous man, Khaleesi. They all are.

46
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,410
How many?

47

I'm sure the sellswords
prefer to fight for the winning side.

I imagine you're right.

I'd like to talk
to the Titan's Bastard about winning.

He may not agree to meet.

He will.

You'll all be

Take your clothes off

and I may give you my Second Sons.

how many men fight for the Second Sons?

Under 2,000, Your Grace.

We have more, don't we?

BARRISTAN: 10,000 Unsullied.

81

I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war,

82
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,260
but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself

83
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,888
can explain to me
how you propose to defeat us.

84

I hope the old man
is better with a sword than he is with a lie.

You have 8,000 Unsullied.

You're very young to be a captain.

87
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,109
He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.

Even if your numbers are right,

89
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,947
the odds don't favor your side.

90
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:29,116
The Second Sons have
faced worse odds and won.

91
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,660
The Second Sons have
faced worse odds and run.

92
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:34,955

You have no cavalry.

Perhaps you'd like a flagon
to help you ponder.

Only a flagon?
And what are my brothers in arms to drink?

- A barrel, then.
- Good.

The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone.

In the Second Sons, we share everything.

116

After the battle, maybe we'll all share you.

Then why bathe him
and dress him in fine clothes?

If it needs to be
done, do it. Don't torture the boy.

No.

If the lamb sees the knife, she panics.

131

Her panic seeps into
her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor.

You've slaughtered many lambs?

I didn't know she'd been gone.

164
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,842
Came back with a bastard boy.

165
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:41,637
Robert's bastard boy.

166
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,846
Why?

167
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:46,516
She says there's power in king's blood.

168
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,311
She's going to kill him.

169
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,604
Sacrifice him.

170
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,773
Forgive me, Your Grace,
I'm not a learned man,

171
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,067
but is there a difference
between kill and sacrifice?

172
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,694
The boy is your nephew.

173
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,905
What of it? We're at war.

174
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,991
Why should I spare the son
of some tavern slut

175
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,702
Robert bedded one drunken night?

176
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,996
Because he has your blood in his veins.

177
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,708
So did Renly.

178
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,295
Renly wronged you.

179
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,965
Renly declared himself
king when the throne belonged to you.

180
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,676
He raised an army, stole your bannermen.

181
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:22,886
This boy has done you no harm.

182
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,221
He's an innocent.

183
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,597
How many boys live in Westeros?

184
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:28,976
How many girls?
How many men? How many women?

185
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:32,562
The darkness will devour them all, she
says. The night that never ends.

186
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,775
Unless I triumph. I never asked for this.

187
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,568
No more than I asked to be king.

188
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:44,241
We do not choose our destiny,
but we must do our duty, no?

189
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:47,119
Great or small, we must do our duty.

190
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:52,416
What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?

191
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,090
Your Grace,
why did you come to see me today?

192
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,718
I came to free you.

193
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:06,555
If you swear never to raise your hand
to the Lady Melisandre again.

194
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:08,765
I swear it.

195
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,601
I can't swear never to speak against her.

196
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,104
You have little regard for your own life.

197
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:17,232
Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none.

198
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,945
You could have
freed me yesterday or tomorrow,

199
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,032
but you came to me now
before this boy is put to the knife

200
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:28,785
because you knew I'd counsel restraint.

201
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:33,707
You came to hear me
say it because you believe it yourself.

202
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,085
You're not a man who
slaughters innocents for gain or glory.

203
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,801
When my son was five, he said to me,

204
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,679
"I don't ever want to die."

205
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:51,349
I wanted to say to him,
"You won't, child. You won't ever."

206
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:55,896
I hated the idea
of him lying awake in the dark, afraid.

207
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,651
I think mothers and fathers made up the Gods

208
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:05,655
because they wanted their
children to sleep through the night.

209
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,242
I saw a vision in the flames.

210
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,832
A great battle in the snow. I saw it.

211
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,171
And you saw whatever she gave birth to.

212
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,550
I never believed, but when you see the truth,

213
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,637
when it's right there in front of you,

214
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,809
as real as these iron bars,
how can you deny her god is real?

You talk too much.

00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,045
She won't talk so much
when she's choking on my cock.

Is there any place that my cock can't reach?

She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.

who doesn't like whores.

225
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,729
I like them very much.
I just refuse to pay them.

00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,315
And I'm no whore, my friend.

- For beauty?

We fight for gold.

231
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,744
The Gods gave men
two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die,

232
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:38,165
the thrill of fucking
a woman who wants to be fucked

But you do look glorious.

I didn't ask for this.

You're right. I have no idea how you feel.

you'd see further than all the rest.

You'd be alone with nothing
but blue sky above you.

So Lord Reyne built a castle
as grand as Casterly Rock.

He gave his wife diamonds

high above the gates of Casterly Rock.

to give you away to your husband.

Have you ever seen one like it?

334

I've never seen
anything like any of this. Not in my life.

335

It's shocking, isn't it,
the first time you encounter real wealth?

336
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,815
When I was your age,
I lived on one bowl of stew a day.

337
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,443
And stew is a kind word for it.

In Flea Bottom
we called them "bowls of brown."

We'd pretend that
the meat in them was chicken.

340

I'm a mistake.

358

I'm only here because
my father grabbed my mother

359

instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.

360

Your father chose your
mother because the Lord of Light willed it.

He willed it so you could be here right now

you can't even begin to understand.

And He brought me here
to draw it from you and birth it into the world.

We're both a part of His plan.

He wants this for us.
No, He demands this of us.

muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts?

Mmm?
