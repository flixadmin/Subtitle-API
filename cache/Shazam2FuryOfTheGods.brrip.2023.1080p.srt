1
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:14,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The lore tells us of a valiant few
who stood above the fray and fog.</font>

2
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My, what weapons they must have wielded.</font>

3
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which brings us to our current exhibit,</font>

4
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the mythical staff of the gods.</font>

5
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In Homer's tale,</font>

6
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:28,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the staff was said to harness
the gift of all gods.</font>

7
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Welcome, proud soldiers.</font>

8
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:32,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did I say?</font>

9
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Museums are fun.</font>

10
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,222
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amusement parks for the brains.</font>

11
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay,</font>

12
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there's no reason to get pushy.</font>

13
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone will get a chance to see it.</font>

14
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:46,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Carved from a heartwood
not seen in over 2,000 years,</font>

15
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the two halves of this ancient replica</font>

16
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">were recently discovered in,
of all places,</font>

17
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:55,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a waste processing plant
outside of Philadelphia.</font>

18
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So strong, they reportedly broke
three trash compactors.</font>

19
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, friends, that's enough.</font>

20
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sort of the star of the show here.</font>

21
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!</font>

22
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop! Sir!</font>

23
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir!</font>

24
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

25
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, what are you doing?</font>

26
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Unleash the chaos.</i></font>

27
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Unleash the chaos.</i></font>

28
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Unleash the chaos.</i></font>

29
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait. Move, move, move!</font>

30
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No.</font>

31
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help me!</font>

32
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

33
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladies, please just let me go.</font>

34
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God! Look out!</font>

35
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turns out museums are fun.</font>

36
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's have more of it.</font>

37
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can do nothing
while the staff remains sundered.</font>

38
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The champions of this realm outnumber us.</font>

39
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Human champions are still humans,</font>

40
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we are gods.</font>

41
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not underestimate
the judgement of the wizard.</font>

42
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To protect the power of the gods,</font>

43
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he will have chosen,
with meticulous precision,</font>

44
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the strongest, most keenly
intelligent champions</font>

45
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this realm has ever witnessed.</font>

46
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm an idiot.</font>

47
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't deserve these powers,
if I'm being honest.</font>

48
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, what am I even contributing?</font>

49
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's already a superhero
with a red suit,</font>

50
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with a lightning bolt on it</font>

51
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm fast, but he's faster.</font>

52
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aquaman is literally huge,
and he's so manly</font>

53
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Batman is so cool!</font>

54
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm just me.</font>

55
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I can't say this to anyone else,</font>

56
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause my family looks to me as a leader,</font>

57
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I feel like a fraud.</font>

58
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You understand I'm a</font>

59
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">pediatrician,</font>

60
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:06,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">right?</font>

61
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, yeah, well, you were recommended</font>

62
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by another patient, Billy Batson.</font>

63
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't matter.</font>

64
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you help fix my thoughts so that</font>

65
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they just, like, you know, stop happening?</font>

66
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:17,627
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, look.</font>

67
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, again, pediatrician,
not a psychiatrist,</font>

68
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:23,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it sounds to me like
you're experiencing imposter syndrome.</font>

69
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And often, that originates
from trauma early in life,</font>

70
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so if you don't mind me asking,</font>

71
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how well do you remember your childhood?</font>

72
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like it was today.</font>

73
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trauma? I don't know.</font>

74
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I never met my dad.</font>

75
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mom abandoned me
at a Christmas carnival.</font>

76
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I spent a lot of time
in the foster system,</font>

77
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ran away from 11 homes,
got into a lot of fights.</font>

78
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I was abducted by a wizard
who gave me superpowers</font>

79
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then dude just, like,
died in front of my face.</font>

80
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not a small amount.</font>

81
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A doctor conjured seven demons
and held my whole family hostage,</font>

82
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so we had to rip out one of his eyeballs,</font>

83
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then everybody got superpowers,</font>

84
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but now everyone's kind of,
like, doing their own thing</font>

85
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm the only one
trying to keep everybody together.</font>

86
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay. Well, let's just process that.</font>

87
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right? Rejected by your parents,</font>

88
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then by the system,</font>

89
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now rejected by
a city you try to protect.</font>

90
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never said I was rejected by my city.</font>

91
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Rejected by city."</font>

92
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the <i>Tribune.</i>
Nobody reads the <i>Tribune.</i></font>

93
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I do.
- Anyway, okay, well,</font>

94
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I appreciate your help,
but I got some real problems.</font>

95
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's this terrorist hostage
situation going on, so...</font>

96
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hostage situation?
- Yeah.</font>

97
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suck balls at this.</font>

98
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do we always have to play war games?</font>

99
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, it's practice for our other job.</font>

100
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm serious.</font>

101
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Military strategy, multiple team members,</font>

102
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">each with a special skillset</font>

103
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">unleashed against an unknown enemy.</font>

104
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know how it sounds,</font>

105
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the house keeps getting
struck by lightning, Leo.</font>

106
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,062
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm telling you.</font>

107
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides, you're the one
always talking about teamwork.</font>

108
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we don't need guns!</font>

109
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darla?</font>

110
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is it. This is big time.</font>

111
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We are the guns.
- Darla!</font>

112
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why were there Skittles in my pockets?</font>

113
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was supposed to be a surprise.</font>

114
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was.</font>

115
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's very moody lately.</font>

116
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you think
I put Skittles in her pocket?</font>

117
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh.
- Olé.</font>

118
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this an army of unicorns</font>

119
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- killing Genghis Khan?
- Yes.</font>

120
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unicorns aren't real.</font>

121
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's called speculative history, Eugene.</font>

122
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look it up.
- Billy, you can't just leave.</font>

123
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your guy's gonna die!</font>

124
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you you would get into it
if you gave it a chance.</font>

125
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm really starting
to see the appeal.</font>

126
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on?</font>

127
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, what are you doing?</font>

128
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Possible 10-99 in progress.</i></font>

129
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Multiple reports of cracking on roadway.</i></font>

130
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Fraying suspension cables.</i></font>

131
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>All units to the Ben Franklin Bridge.</i></font>

132
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. It's crazy music, Freddy.
- It is, isn't it?</font>

133
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very urgent melody to it.</font>

134
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should see it performed live.</font>

135
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was thinking the same thing.</font>

136
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel like we can get tickets
to that concert.</font>

137
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two. Maybe not six.</font>

138
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All or none. That's the rule.</font>

139
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yet I'm still gonna walk backwards now.</font>

140
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, now's your last and final chance.</font>

141
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy Batson, come with me.</font>

142
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no!</font>

143
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, it sure is a beautiful day
in Philadelphia!</font>

144
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it, though?</font>

145
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Almost finished.
- Again?</font>

146
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- This better be good.</font>

147
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's everyone going?</font>

148
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To fight crime?</font>

149
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Bye, Mom.</font>

150
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Mom.</font>

151
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bye.
- Bye, Rosa.</font>

152
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:52,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give it time.</font>

153
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys ready?</font>

154
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shazam!</font>

155
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

156
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna break!</font>

157
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run!</font>

158
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I need a hero</i></font>

159
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm holding out for a hero
Till the end of the night</i></font>

160
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He's...</i></font>

161
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.</font>

162
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way, shut up!</font>

163
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I just save you
while you were listening to this song?</font>

164
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! I got you, I got you, I got you.</font>

165
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No need to panic.</font>

166
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain Everypower is here.</font>

167
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just kidding, it's real easy.</font>

168
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:36,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi!</font>

169
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my gosh. Kittens!</font>

170
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! They're so cute!</font>

171
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did she just leave us?</font>

172
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let's go.</font>

173
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- No, no, no, I got ya!</font>

174
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my sidekick.</font>

175
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Captain Everypower Junior.</font>

176
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Junior?</font>

177
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna wanna hold on tight.</font>

178
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:06,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone's safe.</font>

179
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Awesome job, Mary.</font>

180
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Circle up, fam!</font>

181
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, here's the situation.</font>

182
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have one more job to do,</font>

183
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that's to keep this bridge
from collapsing.</font>

184
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The Ben Franklin Bridge has collapsed.</i></font>

185
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Fortunately, there are no casualties.</i></font>

186
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks in part to our local heroes,
one with me now.</font>

187
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's great to be here, Nancy.
What can I say?</font>

188
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all in a day's work.</font>

189
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Well, how do you feel about
being dubbed the Philadelphia Fiascoes?</font>

190
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Given that that's not an official title,
we feel nothing about it.</i></font>

191
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That is not our name.</i></font>

192
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Right, right, right.
But the important thing is...</i></font>

193
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is wrong with these people?</font>

194
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever...</font>

195
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna go check on the kids.</font>

196
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you should.
God only knows what they're up to.</font>

197
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,938
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably drugs, right?</font>

198
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably taking selfies
while vaping on TikTok.</font>

199
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

200
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:04,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that a kitten?</font>

201
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Destroy bridge"?</font>

202
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

203
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not saving is different than breaking.</font>

204
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I wrong? Am I wrong about this?</font>

205
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also, we saved countless lives.</font>

206
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A 162. It's countable.</font>

207
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Emotionally countless, Mary.</font>

208
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Eugene?</font>

209
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where he always is.</font>

210
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mapping out the room of doors.</font>

211
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eugene!</font>

212
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, buddy! Where you at?</font>

213
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:24,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Eugene.</font>

214
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello? We have a meeting, Eugene.</font>

215
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're late.</font>

216
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not go in there.</font>

217
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,132
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, fam-jam, let's jump in.</font>

218
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, big day,</font>

219
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">big bridge,</font>

220
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">kind of a couple blunders, right?</font>

221
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we're gonna meditate
on those mistakes right now.</font>

222
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mary?</font>

223
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Organic chem is my meditation.</font>

224
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Said nobody with friends ever, really.</font>

225
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In point of fact, I'd have friends</font>

226
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:11,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if I had gone to college.</font>

227
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"In point of fact" is exactly the kind of</font>

228
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">smart thing that a smart person
who doesn't need to go to college says.</font>

229
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:19,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, let's go back to the tape.</font>

230
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, guys, as you can see,</font>

231
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we started off
real, real, real strong, right?</font>

232
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right up top,
all that cohesiveness, energy,</font>

233
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">terrific!</font>

234
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, sorry, coach.</font>

235
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotta fly IRL.</font>

236
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, I'm not done
with the presentation.</font>

237
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. And I love these daily recaps.</font>

238
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just gotta spread my wings a bit
before dinner.</font>

239
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It helps keep me loose!
- Okay, fine, fine. No recap.</font>

240
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll go have a group hang in the air.
That sounds great.</font>

241
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta test this slime for toxicity
'cause I'm starting to tingle.</font>

242
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. The Phillies game just came on</font>

243
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I'm gonna go ahead and watch baseball.</font>

244
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's right that I give Tawny back.</font>

245
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on! What is happening?</font>

246
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is happening right now?
All or none, guys!</font>

247
00:17:58,828 --> 00:17:59,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you say you have to work...</font>

248
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to work.</font>

249
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you even have a job?</font>

250
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wonder Woman doesn't have a job!</font>

251
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stop.
- No, seriously.</font>

252
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think she wears
a ponytail and glasses</font>

253
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and, like, nobody recognizes her</font>

254
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:09,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she's, like,
an accountant or something?</font>

255
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just stop.</font>

256
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are holding on too tight.</font>

257
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:16,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just 'cause Freddy wants to fly solo
for 10 minutes</font>

258
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">doesn't mean he's gonna
leave you like your mom.</font>

259
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or me wanting to go to college</font>

260
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">means I'm abandoning the family.</font>

261
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Okay, cool, it's about college again.
I totally get it.</font>

262
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

263
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you really not see yourself?</font>

264
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:36,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You turn 18 in 5 months.</font>

265
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not gonna kick me out.
They didn't kick you out.</font>

266
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Victor and Rosa are saints, yes,</font>

267
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you're about to age out
of the foster system just like I did.</font>

268
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I get it. I know how it works, okay?</font>

269
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:47,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you?</font>

270
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Victor and Rosa can barely pay rent.</font>

271
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the state no longer sends checks
to feed or house me</font>

272
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and soon there will be no checks for you.</font>

273
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care if Wonder Woman has a job.</font>

274
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to contribute.</font>

275
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At some point, Billy, like,</font>

276
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:09,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">everyone on Earth,
we have to get a job or leave home.</font>

277
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing lasts forever.</font>

278
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:28,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, it's literally called
the Rock of Eternity.</font>

279
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, clearly, some things do last forever.</font>

280
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave me to die.</font>

281
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:16,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. But we come bearing gifts.</font>

282
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Magic.</font>

283
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Impossible.</font>

284
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This realm was sealed off from magic.</font>

285
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. After you ripped it
from our father's very core.</font>

286
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From every god in this realm.</font>

287
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From me.</font>

288
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you not remember what you took?</font>

289
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What my particular power was?</font>

290
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The power of elements.</font>

291
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

292
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cast a barrier to prevent your kind</font>

293
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from entering the human realm.</font>

294
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:59,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only way that barrier
could be removed is if...</font>

295
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone broke this?</font>

296
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did...</font>

297
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:05,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is the Champion?</font>

298
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:09,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was your hands that
forged this staff for our father</font>

299
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and yours that will mend it.</font>

300
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you,</font>

301
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would die before I help you.</font>

302
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, say the word.</font>

303
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never. Never!</font>

304
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never say never.</font>

305
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say the word.</font>

306
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shazam!</font>

307
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we get to have our fun.</font>

308
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fun is for children, dear.</font>

309
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are at war.</font>

310
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry!
- Oh, my goodness. I am so sorry!</font>

311
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:01,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, don't be sorry. I'm sorry!</font>

312
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's totally my fault. Are you okay?</font>

313
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm okay, yeah. I'm always okay.
- Okay, yeah. Good.</font>

314
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, do you know where this is?</font>

315
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miss Saunders!</font>

316
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, absolutely</font>

317
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is what I meant to say.
Voice crack. It's weird.</font>

318
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no worries.
If it makes you feel any better,</font>

319
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's nothing compared to the amount
that you're blushing right now.</font>

320
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:19,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I blush when I'm confident.</font>

321
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There she is.</font>

322
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:23,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey.
- New girl. First period.</font>

323
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- I'm Brett. This is Burke.</font>

324
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:27,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, if you need anything at all,</font>

325
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we're your guys. We got it.</font>

326
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brett and Burke Breyer.</font>

327
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They got it all. I mean, what is it,</font>

328
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">narcissistic personality disorder,</font>

329
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">chlamydia, they got it.</font>

330
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plenty of it to go around, too.</font>

331
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Thundercrack's Make-A-Wish kid.</font>

332
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fanboy here thinks he's a big boy now.</font>

333
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, he doesn't know where he belongs.</font>

334
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure I do.
I don't belong in that trash can.</font>

335
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause that's...
I'll smell like human garbage,</font>

336
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">do you realize that?
And that's your brand, guys!</font>

337
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Down goes Freeman.</font>

338
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey! Look!</font>

339
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Now I'm a superhero.
- Nice!</font>

340
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is this thing doing here?</font>

341
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Janitors.</font>

342
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get up, man. What are you doin'? Come on.</font>

343
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna want to get this fixed, huh?</font>

344
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's probably why you fell.</font>

345
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Bye, new girl.</font>

346
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeez, thanks, Mr. Geckle.</font>

347
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't sweat it. That trash can</font>

348
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:15,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was like a second home to me
when I went here.</font>

349
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:18,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

350
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You knew those guys were gonna hit you,</font>

351
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you stepped in anyway.</font>

352
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know something?
That's how I amuse myself.</font>

353
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The funnier I am,</font>

354
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the more I get punched.</font>

355
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it made me laugh.</font>

356
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hero.</font>

357
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gonna walk me to class or what?</font>

358
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would I... Walk you to class? No.</font>

359
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would I wanna do that? Yes!</font>

360
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

361
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, from the top.</font>

362
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is Thundercrack's Make-A-Wish kid?</font>

363
00:24:56,453 --> 00:25:00,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. It's real inside baseball,
but basically,</font>

364
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a while ago I happened to have some lunch</font>

365
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the cafeteria with a few superheroes.</font>

366
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:08,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, the kid who's friends
with superheroes.</font>

367
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That was you?
- Yeah.</font>

368
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they're still dicks to you?</font>

369
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sadly, just 'cause you know someone cool,
doesn't really necessarily make you cool.</font>

370
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You seem pretty cool to me.</font>

371
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddy!</font>

372
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is my name.</font>

373
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:26,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, that was weird and loud.
I'm Freddy,</font>

374
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he said in a normal voice.</font>

375
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Anne.</font>

376
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anne.</font>

377
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nice!
- Bullseye.</font>

378
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you gotta fix that crutch, bro!</font>

379
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

380
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good, little one.</font>

381
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well done.</font>

382
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now go find me
the one responsible for this.</font>

383
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,225
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

384
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm flattered that you feel this way.</font>

385
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truly. I mean, you know, like,
look at all this, you know,</font>

386
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:51,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">romantic setting and fancy champagne,
big plates, tiny food.</font>

387
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you went all out.</font>

388
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love that, I do.</font>

389
00:26:56,698 --> 00:27:00,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just not sure that I'm really ready
to commit right now, you know?</font>

390
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait, wait.
No, this isn't about you.</font>

391
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:06,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise this is not about you.
Okay? Look.</font>

392
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know the whole world
wants to see this happen.</font>

393
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and me.</font>

394
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The dynamic duo. The hottie goddies.</font>

395
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She-zam.</font>

396
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:21,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess I'm just afraid that
I'm gonna let 'em all down.</font>

397
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know?</font>

398
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That I'm gonna let you down.</font>

399
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what? Screw it. Let's try.</font>

400
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's try this crazy thing.</font>

401
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:35,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we'll</font>

402
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:39,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">seal it with a kiss?</font>

403
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy Batson!</font>

404
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are a fool of a champion.</font>

405
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is going on?</font>

406
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to her beautiful face?</font>

407
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also, aren't you, like, dead-ass dead?</font>

408
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bring a warning from beyond your realm.</font>

409
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The daughters of Atlas are coming for you.</font>

410
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daughters of Atlas?</font>

411
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're coming to unmake your world</font>

412
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and torture mankind for all eternity</font>

413
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- in the Pit of Endless Agony.
- Okay, I feel like maybe</font>

414
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should be writing all this down.</font>

415
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:17,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Quiet!
- Okay, okay.</font>

416
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,185
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know what you've done.</font>

417
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I regret ever choosing you.</font>

418
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because of you,</font>

419
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the barrier between the world
has been brought down.</font>

420
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They will be hunting for you now.
Hunting your family.</font>

421
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:35,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, they're coming. Listen to me, Billy.</font>

422
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fate of your world depends on it.</font>

423
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One thing you absolutely must not allow</font>

424
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the daughters of Atlas to do is...</font>

425
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Freddy?</font>

426
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope, over it. Done it.</font>

427
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check fraud? What, are you kidding me?</font>

428
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Armored car heist?</font>

429
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I got that in the bag.</font>

430
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shazam!</font>

431
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:41,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Bon appétit.</i></font>

432
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, hi! Yes, I mean, hi.
- Hi.</font>

433
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:50,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna show me where you were sitting
when it happened?</font>

434
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, of course. Totally.</font>

435
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. Follow me.
- Okay, yeah.</font>

436
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,505
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, basically, it's a table
down at the end.</font>

437
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I was sitting, yeah.</font>

438
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:06,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Basically, I was sitting right here,
and he was sitting</font>

439
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:07,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">right there.</font>

440
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Here?
- Right there, yeah.</font>

441
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, sorry. Overbearing brother.</font>

442
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I have one of those. A sister.</font>

443
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always has to know where I am.</font>

444
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

445
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel that, clearly.</font>

446
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always thinks she knows better, too.</font>

447
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even when it's been
factually proven otherwise?</font>

448
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly. And it's not
that I don't love her.</font>

449
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, of course. It'd just be nice
not to have someone...</font>

450
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:27,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Constantly breathing down your neck.</font>

451
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- From the moment you wake up!
- 'Cause I'm not a kid anymore.</font>

452
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:32,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! I'm a month younger,
one month exactly.</font>

453
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And do we have to do
every single thing together?</font>

454
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:40,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy!</font>

455
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a coinkidink!</font>

456
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just telling my friend Anne</font>

457
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- what a great guy you are.
- We need to talk.</font>

458
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to talk. This guy loves to talk.</font>

459
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's a great talker.
- Freddy.</font>

460
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to talk to him. I'll be right back.</font>

461
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

462
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, didn't you tell us
the wizard disintegrated?</font>

463
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The skin peeled off his face.</font>

464
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He turned into a literal pile of ash.</font>

465
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, seems definitive.
- I don't know.</font>

466
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Except now he's in my dreams</font>

467
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and, Freddy, he's trying
to give me a message.</font>

468
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could be astral projection powers.</font>

469
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's that?
- Obi-Wan Kenobi-ing you</font>

470
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- from the great beyond?
- That's it, I'm calling</font>

471
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:13,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">an emergency meeting after school.</font>

472
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I want you there.
- Where else am I gonna go?</font>

473
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Dude.</font>

474
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, first of all, I didn't explode it!</font>

475
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right? It was already like that and...</font>

476
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that, the <i>Tribune?</i> It's fake news!</font>

477
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddy, we only have one rule.</font>

478
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All or none.
- All or none.</font>

479
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's a stupid rule, by the way.</font>

480
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a girl talking to me, Billy.</font>

481
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A girl. For the first time in my life!</font>

482
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I probably don't have
a shot in hell with this girl,</font>

483
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'll never find out</font>

484
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you keep trying to control
everything I wanna do!</font>

485
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:38,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just be at the Rock, Freddy.</font>

486
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

487
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way, she has a sister.</font>

488
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:45,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Total control freak.</font>

489
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you guys would get along.</font>

490
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:48,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think you'd love her, actually.</font>

491
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:50,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Look, look, look. Fam,</i></font>

492
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it sounds crazy.</font>

493
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:55,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And obviously I don't know
exactly what this all means,</font>

494
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but he was super aggro</font>

495
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and super loud and he was
trying to warn us, I think.</font>

496
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:00,728
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was yelling about all this</font>

497
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wizard-y mumbo-jumbo
about realms and stuff.</font>

498
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,298
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have to talk so loud?</font>

499
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,175
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, Mary, 'cause this is not that loud.</font>

500
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think this is a perfectly
acceptable indoor voice volume.</font>

501
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:11,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is the deal? Are you okay?</font>

502
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Why do you have sunglasses on?</font>

503
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you go to the eye doctor this morning?</font>

504
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know, it looks to me like
Mary did go to the eye doctor,</font>

505
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:23,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it was last night,
and she had a lot of fun.</font>

506
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In point of fact, I did have a great time.</font>

507
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I met other people my age,
and I enjoyed myself.</font>

508
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You made friends at the eye doctor?</font>

509
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:32,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, she...</font>

510
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Can we get back on track?</font>

511
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, he's yelling at me</font>

512
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he's saying the daughters of Atlas</font>

513
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are coming to hunt us.</font>

514
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, check out what I found.</font>

515
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The daughters of Atlas are
the offspring of the Titan Atlas,"</font>

516
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is obvious,</font>

517
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:50,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but also Nyx,
the Goddess of Night and Death.</font>

518
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, good things can happen at night.</font>

519
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And death.</font>

520
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:55,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me see this.</font>

521
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:04,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The daughters guard
the mythic Tree of Life</font>

522
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:08,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which grows golden apples
that contain the seeds of life</font>

523
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which gave birth to their realm</font>

524
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">protected by a</font>

525
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- dragon."
- Hey, now.</font>

526
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:15,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I am suddenly here for this.</font>

527
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, right?</font>

528
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause, like, on one hand,
totally terrifying.</font>

529
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- On the other hand, dragon!
- Dragon!</font>

530
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mary. What are we doin'?</font>

531
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know, man. This is your meeting.</font>

532
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, yes, fine, but we all
need to be on the same page</font>

533
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and, look,</font>

534
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I often think that
you think better than me.</font>

535
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The wizard did not exactly give me
a tutorial here, guys, okay?</font>

536
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, I don't know
how a lot of this stuff works.</font>

537
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That room of doors, or that violin</font>

538
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that is, like, constantly burning</font>

539
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is super weird, but also</font>

540
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">definitely keeps the lair cozy, right?</font>

541
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't even tell me my superhero name.</font>

542
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:49,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's not like I'm not tryin'.</font>

543
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I really, really need your help.</font>

544
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I might know somebody that can help.</font>

545
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up. That lights up?</font>

546
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up.</font>

547
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:44,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I'm mapping out the entire lair
and you withhold this?</font>

548
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you have really
been holding out on us.</font>

549
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeez Louise, dude.</font>

550
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Whoa" what?</font>

551
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- "Whoa" what?
- Look!</font>

552
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Steve.</font>

553
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? You call the pen "Steve"?</font>

554
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I thought he looked like a "Steve."</font>

555
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He totally looks like a "Steve."</font>

556
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"Crime and Punishment,</i>
a book report by Pedro Peña"?</font>

557
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

558
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pedro.</font>

559
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:12,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dude, that's cheating.
- I mean, he knows everything.</font>

560
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously. Ask him.</font>

561
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:15,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can just ask him stuff?</font>

562
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pretty much.
- Slick. Okay, cool.</font>

563
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Steve, we're looking for information</font>

564
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about the daughters of Atlas.</font>

565
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you please help us with that?</font>

566
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- These are book titles.
- Okay.</font>

567
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's just all pick a book, or something.</font>

568
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Freddy? I mean, obscure mythology?</font>

569
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Definitely his thing.</font>

570
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:42,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not even sure Freddy knows
what his thing is anymore.</font>

571
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I've actually never been up here.</font>

572
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:54,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't lie. This is where you hang out
with your superhero friends, isn't it?</font>

573
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:57,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, actually,
why would they ever come here?</font>

574
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, yes, they've driven by...</font>

575
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you actually know those guys?</font>

576
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:03,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or is this, like,
a "Canadian girlfriend" situation?</font>

577
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:04,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you mean Collette?</font>

578
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, she and I aren't
really exclusive, as of now.</font>

579
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you wanna meet one of them?</font>

580
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meet, like, how?</font>

581
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, face-to-face, right now.</font>

582
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna take that as a yes.</font>

583
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:18,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And today is your lucky day,</font>

584
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:20,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because I'm gonna call the hot one.</font>

585
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her?</font>

586
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, the male hot one.</font>

587
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Him?</font>

588
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:26,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Him?</font>

589
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I mean, it's all subjective, right?</font>

590
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But Captain Everypower usually
tops most online polls, so...</font>

591
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's no big deal.</font>

592
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this a joke, Freddy?</font>

593
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I didn't mean to make you
actually prove it, really.</font>

594
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's not a joke.</font>

595
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,179
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm gonna call him right now.
I'm gonna call him right now.</font>

596
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, don't move. So, stay right there.</font>

597
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Captain Everypower. What's goin' on?</font>

598
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's your boy Freddy. Yeah.</font>

599
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember that time I saved your life?</font>

600
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, the other time.</font>

601
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

602
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm calling in that favor.</font>

603
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must be Anne.</font>

604
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

605
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friend of Freddy's, I hear.</font>

606
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am, actually. Yeah. How are you...</font>

607
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I may be
the one with the superpowers,</font>

608
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but that kid,</font>

609
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he's the real hero.</font>

610
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I mean, honestly,</font>

611
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never met anyone like him.</font>

612
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:33,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's genuine</font>

613
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:36,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and warm and funny.</font>

614
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's a lot of nice things.
- Yeah.</font>

615
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you two meet?</font>

616
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,343
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Comic-Con.</font>

617
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:44,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's Comic-Con?
- What?</font>

618
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>According to this,</i></font>

619
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:49,934
<font face="Comic Sans MS">gods considered humans servants,
toys to be played with,</font>

620
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">children to be punished.</font>

621
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, Steve.</font>

622
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until the rebellion,
when the humans turned on the gods.</font>

623
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm reading about that right now.</font>

624
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, apparently, all of this</font>

625
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">revolves around a powerful weapon.</font>

626
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Atlas, the father</font>

627
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the daughters of Atlas, obviously,</font>

628
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">yeah, he crafted a quarterstaff
from the Tree of Life</font>

629
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he used that staff
to give powers to certain deities</font>

630
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but also to take powers away from others.</font>

631
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:18,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, the staff's where Atlas
stored all supernatural power.</font>

632
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:22,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, exactly.
It's like a battery for magic.</font>

633
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But when things got bad,</font>

634
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a council of human wizards got together</font>

635
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:27,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they stole the staff from Atlas.</font>

636
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they used that
to take his powers away.</font>

637
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And once they had his magic,
they went after other gods...</font>

638
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, that's the wizard! I know this guy.</font>

639
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the wizard that I know!</font>

640
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do these say?</font>

641
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:42,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The Wisdom of Solomon,</font>

642
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,906

643
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Power of Zeus, Courage of Achilles,
Speed of Mercury."</font>

644
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are the powers they stole.</font>

645
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:54,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, look!</font>

646
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what the name means.</font>

647
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is way cooler
than what I thought it was,</font>

648
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,144
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is just a bunch
of hot garbage, so...</font>

649
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I may point out one of the powers</font>

650
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,424
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that may be possibly MIA. Boop.</font>

651
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,342
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry,</font>

652
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:09,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are you very unsubtly implying
that I somehow lack the wisdom of</font>

653
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Solo Man?
- Yeah.</font>

654
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:13,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe it comes later.</font>

655
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you do usually
ask Mary what to do.</font>

656
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:17,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm just saying.
- Yeah.</font>

657
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is very, very hurtful.</font>

658
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want you all to know that.</font>

659
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it's pronounced "Solomon."</font>

660
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

661
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,904
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What else have we learned, fam?</font>

662
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:28,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, once the staff
contained the powers of the gods,</font>

663
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:33,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the wizards apparently
encased the God Realm</font>

664
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in some magical sphere</font>

665
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sealing it away forever.</font>

666
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:38,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut off from magic.</font>

667
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, so that's what that was about.</font>

668
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I don't think that
they are so cut off anymore.</font>

669
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:51,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A bizarre and gruesome scene unfolded
in Athens, Greece this morning.</i></font>

670
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Two women dressed in
what appears to be ancient Greek...</i></font>

671
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the wizard's staff.</font>

672
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did they get that?</font>

673
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, all those statues used to be people.</font>

674
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:01,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm wondering,
how did the staff end up in Europe,</font>

675
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:02,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where Greece is at?</font>

676
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, gee-whiz, mister,
sorry I took your cane.</font>

677
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want it back?</font>

678
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I did break it in half
and then throw it away.</font>

679
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, that's probably
where the journey started.</font>

680
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know?
- What?</font>

681
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean, "What"? What?</font>

682
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,426
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You just left it there?
- We were all there.</font>

683
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, I had a staff.
I gave you all superpowers.</font>

684
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:24,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome, by the way.</font>

685
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then I had to break it in half
so Sivana didn't do</font>

686
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">super bad-guy stuff with it, okay?</font>

687
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You broke the staff,</font>

688
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">meaning you broke the barrier
between worlds.</font>

689
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:33,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which we now know.</font>

690
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We also now know what they look like,</font>

691
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so when they come to hunt us,
we'll see those two coming a...</font>

692
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three.</font>

693
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:39,687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

694
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:43,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Atlas had three daughters.</font>

695
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kalypso, Hespera,</font>

696
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anthea.</font>

697
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anne-thea.</font>

698
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I'm not just a superhero.</font>

699
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a super listener.</font>

700
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:00,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I sense</font>

701
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you may have feelings for Freddy.</font>

702
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just wanna know when he's coming back.</font>

703
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:08,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't want him to get hurt.</font>

704
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well, Anne. I mean, we can't choose</font>

705
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the people we fall for.</font>

706
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

707
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not talking about that.</font>

708
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:20,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he shows up now,
he's in serious danger.</font>

709
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look who you're with.</font>

710
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What could possibly be dangerous?</font>

711
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

712
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see how it is.</font>

713
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's dance.</font>

714
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:35,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

715
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:37,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddy?</font>

716
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Freddy, I didn't know.</font>

717
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never meant for you to get hurt.</font>

718
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I'm not the one who's gonna get hurt.</font>

719
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:45,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shazam!</font>

720
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:48,423
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shazam!</font>

721
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shazam.</font>

722
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on up here?</font>

723
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,053
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddy, are you all right?</font>

724
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:55,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back inside.
Just get back inside, Mr. Geckle.</font>

725
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm okay. Go back inside.</font>

726
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you? Do you have kids here?</font>

727
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:00,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing? Don't hurt him.</font>

728
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't touch him. You have my word.</font>

729
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. G.</font>

730
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,306
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did she say? What are you doing?</font>

731
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:19,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

732
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:20,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you... No, no, no!</font>

733
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop, stop, stop! Wait, wait, wait!
Hey, no, no, no!</font>

734
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:25,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, no, no, no! No! No, no, no!</font>

735
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I forgot how easily they burst.</font>

736
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would you do that?</font>

737
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like grapes.</font>

738
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the...</font>

739
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:55,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, child, tell us
where to find the others.</font>

740
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No need.</font>

741
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:03,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clip his wings, Anthea.</font>

742
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>

743
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are more.</font>

744
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:52,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Perfect. We take them all.
- No.</font>

745
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not why we're here.</font>

746
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're here for the seed of life.
Yield, sister.</font>

747
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We stick to the plan we have.</font>

748
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father would never yield.</font>

749
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Father is dead.</font>

750
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you know your place, sister.</font>

751
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or I will show it to you.</font>

752
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We do this our way, not theirs.</font>

753
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:18,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make one move,</font>

754
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I will snap this child's neck.</font>

755
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:55,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Freddy.</font>

756
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:03,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy, no!</font>

757
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:39,546
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy, stay back!</font>

758
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're using the staff
to take our powers.</font>

759
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? What?</font>

760
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry!</font>

761
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

762
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:14,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, just save yourself.</font>

763
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, all or none. We stick together.</font>

764
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:18,772
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that you will,</font>

765
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because you cannot leave.</font>

766
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:21,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's see how you like</font>

767
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">being sealed off in a dying world.</font>

768
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

769
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:28,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddy!</font>

770
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>From City Line Avenue in the north</i></font>

771
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>to the western shore
of the Schuylkill River</i></font>

772
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:42,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>to Cobbs Creek.</i></font>

773

in the shape of a dome</i></font>

774
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>with no one allowed into the city or out</i></font>

777
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:18,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy...</font>

778
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:20,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying to sleep.</font>

779
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is the only escape
from the tortures here.</font>

780
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Bleak.</font>

781
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a second.</font>

782
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hagrid beard, Batman voice.</font>

783
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the wizard.
You're the wizard! Oh, my...</font>

784
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're back! Billy told me all about you.</font>

785
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:38,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy? You know Billy Batson?</font>

786
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy Batson. Yeah, he's my best friend.</font>

787
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Freddy Freeman, Captain Everypower.</font>

788
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, used to be. It's complicated now.</font>

789
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She... It's complicated.</font>

790
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:48,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That halfwit Billy gave you
the powers of Shazam?</font>

791
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, he did. And he said that
you turned into ash but didn't?</font>

792
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once I gave him the power,</font>

793
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could no longer remain in my realm.</font>

794
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But death would have been a luxury</font>

795
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">compared to being trapped in this cell</font>

796
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the knowledge of my failure,
and with you.</font>

797
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:04,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mostly with you.</font>

798
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little more sarcastic than Billy said,
but, hey, all good.</font>

799
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's just get out of here.
- "Let's just get out of here."</font>

800
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:11,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, sure.</font>

801
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I sound nothing like that, but okay.</font>

802
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's what we've got.</font>

803
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A cranky wizard with a cynical streak</font>

804
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a precocious young man
with an encyclopedic knowledge</font>

805
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">regarding magical shit.</font>

806
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:22,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no way
these sisters are keeping us in here.</font>

807
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:25,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These prison bars,
they're probably enchanted!</font>

808
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What spells do you know?
- Please, stop talking.</font>

809
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about an arcane focus?</font>

810
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't even know what that is.</font>

811
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:34,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine, then let's make a potion.</font>

812
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a potion of giant strength
or diminution.</font>

813
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh! Gaseous form!</font>

814
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah! Maybe we could
float out of here like a fart.</font>

815
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gave my powers to children
who squandered it.</font>

816
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We will die here, Freeby.</font>

817
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:50,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Freddy, by the way.
"Freeby"? Where do you even...</font>

818
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sooner you accept it,</font>

819
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:54,140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the easier it will be.</font>

820
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:56,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this a tooth? There's a tooth in here!</font>

821
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:10,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Power of elements. Power of chaos.</font>

822
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Power of axis."</font>

823
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are primordial forces.</font>

824
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know
how we fight powers like this.</font>

825
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:17,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tell you how we fight it.</font>

826
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With the wisdom of...</font>

827
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Solomon.
- Exactly.</font>

828
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We set up a meeting.</font>

829
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we tell 'em we want to negotiate.</font>

830
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Offer up our powers for Freddy.</font>

831
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:32,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But then we grab one of them
and that's what we really use to trade!</font>

832
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what if they steal our powers?</font>

833
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, they won't,
'cause we know how they work now.</font>

834
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:38,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I mean?
If they just point that staff at us,</font>

835
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:39,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we dodge.</font>

836
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:40,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like dodgeball.</font>

837
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, I suck at dodgeball.</font>

838
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,108
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe Pedro sucks at dodgeball,</font>

839
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:47,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but not Super Pedro.</font>

840
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Super Pedro also sucks at dodgeball.</font>

841
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:51,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine. Listen, all I know</font>

842
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:52,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is that there's five of us
and three of them.</font>

843
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:55,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I think we should send them
a little invitation.</font>

844
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:58,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

845
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:00,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Steve says that this paper</font>

846
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:03,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a stack of magical parchment.</font>

847
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You write a message on the magical paper</font>

848
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:07,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and say the name of the god
that you would like to talk to</font>

849
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then the paper folds into a...</font>

850
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:13,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, yes!</font>

851
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A paper bird.</font>

852
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it flies to the god.</font>

853
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:19,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's kinda cute.</font>

854
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:22,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, what about demigods?
You know, like, Wonder Woman?</font>

855
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think she's accepting
bird letters right now?</font>

856
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did the pen just shrug?</font>

857
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Steve, do I just dictate to...</font>

858
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:35,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do. Okay, cool, wad that up.</font>

859
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

860
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Letter.</font>

861
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Letter, writing a letter. No, no, no!</font>

862
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just talking out loud.</font>

863
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:47,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not a part of the letter.
Wad that up, too.</font>

864
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:49,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe if you try</font>

865
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">speaking from the heart.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I know I shave,
like, every week-ish.</font>

876
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes or no?</font>

877
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Your answer is no
because nobody's stupid enough</font>

to a bunch of kids.</font>

- The names of the Champions?</font>

you're a total control freak.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of you.</font>

888
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:05,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably you.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Power of chaos.</font>

00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:20,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It emanates fear
from every pore of its body.</font>

950
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladon's fear paralyzes any mortal</font>

951
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:25,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so that none can approach
the garden it protects.</font>

952
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:29,386
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Power of axis. Very cool,</font>

953
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- very rare.
- Anthea!</font>

954
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I must go.</font>

955
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The door back to your world is
at the center of the labyrinth.</font>

956
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, left, left</font>

957
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then follow the right-hand wall
to the center.</font>

958
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:42,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You'll need this.
- How did you find this?</font>

959
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:46,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You once protected me from the bullies
in your world, Freddy Freeman.</font>

960
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I've protected you in mine.</font>

961
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:54,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hero.</font>

962
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:58,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, to be fair, I didn't
actually need your protection.</font>

963
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was about to rearrange those boys'
internal organs when you stepped in.</font>

964
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you didn't know that,
which does make you brave.</font>

965
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:07,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just brave because
I knew I had powers.</font>

966
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:10,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, the most powerful thing
about you is you.</font>

967
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How lovely for both of you.</font>

968
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goddess, we thank you much, but we must...</font>

969
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:20,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should go.
My sisters don't need you anymore.</font>

970
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All they require now is the seed.</font>

971
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:24,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The seed?
- Yes.</font>

972
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which remains hidden
in a place unreachable</font>

973
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by any of their kind.
Come, come, Jeff. Faster.</font>

974
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you just call me Jeff?
She just said my entire name!</font>

975
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, God... No?</font>

976
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, Low Voltage.</font>

977
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you fixing this dome shit, man?</font>

978
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:57,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no, no, no, don't worry, sir.</font>

979
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a plan.</font>

980
00:57:58,684 --> 00:57:59,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

981
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause look like all you got
is a sandwich.</font>

982
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:02,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, these sandwiches?</font>

983
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, these sandwiches are important.</font>

984
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:05,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're for a meeting.</font>

985
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:09,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, sure, Colonel Cheesesteak.</font>

986
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:10,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Colonel?</font>

987
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:13,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, boy, I really need a name.</font>

988
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quiet one, she is.</font>

989
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:22,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I find it the most effective way
to slit an enemy's throat.</font>

990
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:24,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that...</font>

991
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you're totally serious. Okay.</font>

992
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:31,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, so, look, here's the thing.
You're upset.</font>

993
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:33,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A bunch of wizards came
and stole your powers,</font>

994
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which totally sucks balls,
I totally get it.</font>

995
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:39,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I kind of feel like
you're taking this all,</font>

996
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:42,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like, really personally and, like,
I don't even know you, lady, right?</font>

997
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:46,857
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If thieves stormed your home in the night
and stole all your coin and then fled,</font>

998
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you would naturally give chase,
would you not?</font>

999
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And say, in this pursuit, the thieves</font>

1000
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">dropped the money on the ground</font>

1001
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:56,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and your neighbor picked it up
and kept it.</font>

1002
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, imagine it is not money</font>

1003
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:04,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the lifeblood of your father,
the last breath of your mother,</font>

1004
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the power of all the gods,</font>

1005
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:10,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the magic of the entire realm
that was stolen.</font>

1006
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now this magic courses through you,</font>

1007
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:14,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you have the gall</font>

1008
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:17,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to believe that you deserve it?</font>

1009
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:22,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is very personal,</font>

1010
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:24,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy.</font>

1011
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:29,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are very menacing.</font>

1012
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want you to know that.
Like, I really...</font>

1013
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:34,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see the presence that you have,
and that goes a long way.</font>

1014
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:38,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But today, I really wanted
to talk about compromise.</font>

1015
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is no compromise.</font>

1016
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:42,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew you were gonna say that.</font>

1017
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wisdom of Saruman.
Don't mess with me, okay?</font>

1018
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:46,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give us back Freddy,</font>

1019
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:50,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you take down this
sphere-y dome-y magic bowl thing</font>

1020
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then, you know,</font>

1021
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:54,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we won't have to annihilate you
into the ground.</font>

1022
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:56,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a good offer. I'm being serious.</font>

1023
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You play the part of a man,</font>

1024
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you do not play it well.</font>

1025
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:04,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give us the powers, child.</font>

1026
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:06,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of them.</font>

1027
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are no leader, Billy.</font>

1028
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:11,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are a lost boy</font>

1029
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who likes to make-believe
that he's a warrior.</font>

1030
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:17,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, look. I might not have
as much experience as you</font>

1031
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:18,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause I'm not, like, super old like you,</font>

1032
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I think I have a few experiences
that you don't have.</font>

1033
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I've seen all
of the <i>Fast and the Furious</i> movies, lady.</font>

1034
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:27,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And let me tell you something.</font>

1035
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all about family!</font>

1036
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:36,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Family!</font>

1037
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, that was the signal.
We practiced this, like, 12 times.</font>

1038
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,262
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1039
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgot all about my family,
didn't you, Goddess?</font>

1040
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:47,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, human. You forgot about mine.</font>

1041
01:00:58,113 --> 01:00:59,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

1042
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:00,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's go.
- Pedro!</font>

1043
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:38,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're wasting my time, boy.</font>

1044
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:18,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1045
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She sure didn't see that coming</font>

1046
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:24,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because she didn't go to the eye doctor.</font>

1047
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darla, that was, 'cause...</font>

1048
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:30,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A euphemism. It was a euphemism.</font>

1049
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1050
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:54,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've taken the power from two
in your family already.</font>

1051
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:57,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now two more must die, and for what?</font>

1052
01:02:57,649 --> 01:02:59,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you can keep playing soldier?</font>

1053
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:37,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father was Atlas.</font>

1054
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:41,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Titan god of stamina and strength.</font>

1055
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:47,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His magic and power
may course through you,</font>

1056
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you will never be a true god.</font>

1057
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:52,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah? Did your dad have superspeed?</font>

1058
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:59,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope!</font>

1059
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:07,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay? That was fun. Let's go.</font>

1060
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Come on, come on.</font>

1061
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hurry, everyone!</font>

1062
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:18,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go, let's go.</font>

1063
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:29,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1064
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:35,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You thought you were just goin'
into some regular porta-potty, didn't ya?</font>

1065
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which I can somehow still smell.</font>

1066
01:04:37,499 --> 01:04:39,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah, it really sticks around.
It's crazy, right?</font>

1067
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:40,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Like, permeates the air.</font>

1068
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't matter. Anyway,</font>

1069
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:43,963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">welcome to the Rock of Eternity.</font>

1070
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:45,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only Champions</font>

1071
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:48,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can get in here,
through any door that we want.</font>

1072
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little thing that we can do
that your sisters can't.</font>

1073
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:54,099
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, that's what I call a total success.</font>

1074
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, maybe, like, a partial total win.</font>

1075
01:04:57,519 --> 01:04:59,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Told you I suck at dodgeball.
- Yeah.</font>

1076
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:02,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do, yeah, but you know,
look, Pedro, we all have our weak spots.</font>

1077
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:03,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I mean?</font>

1078
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And hers,</font>

1079
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:06,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lack of strategic thinking.</font>

1080
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, for the real trade.</font>

1081
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:11,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddy and the staff, for your freedom.</font>

1082
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And get rid of the dome.
- Oh, yeah.</font>

1083
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And get rid of the dome.</font>

1084
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:20,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause the city of brotherly love
is gettin' a little moist.</font>

1085
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:23,545
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Word choice, man.</font>

1086
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:26,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I regretted it as soon as
it was coming out of my mouth.</font>

1087
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:28,422
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's just one of those words...
- I know. I just...</font>

1088
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Dear daughters of Asshat-Las."</font>

1089
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Burn!</font>

1090
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:38,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just came up with that.</font>

1091
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:40,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make sure you put a dash in there, though,</font>

1092
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:41,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so it's really clear. Okay.</font>

1093
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:44,402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, it's so good
having Steve cover grammar</font>

1094
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and spelling and stuff,
it makes me sound so much smarter.</font>

1095
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"A brother for a sister, huh?</font>

1096
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:53,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's that feel?</font>

1097
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:56,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also, how are you actually sisters,</font>

1098
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:59,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because the age difference
is very noticeable</font>

1099
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:01,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and slightly upsetting,
I'm not gonna lie."</font>

1100
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:06,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even though I don't like you very much,
I believe everyone deserves human rights,</font>

1101
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:11,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you don't deserve strawberry.
You only get yellow.</font>

1102
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:15,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's gone!</font>

1103
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:17,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, what?</font>

1104
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:32,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought we brought her in too easily.
She wanted to get caught.</font>

1105
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:35,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't get it. Where would she even go?</font>

1106
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:47,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, this seemed inevitable.</font>

1107
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:56,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep. We are so lost. Thanks, bozo.</font>

1108
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are not lost. Who's the wizard here?</font>

1109
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:01,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

1110
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,937
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have any spells,
no magical artifacts,</font>

1111
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you know nothing about magic,
you're just...</font>

1112
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:10,568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the wizard.</font>

1113
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:11,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- Whatever.</font>

1114
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:14,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, let's see if that</font>

1115
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:15,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">girlfriend of yours can be trusted.</font>

1116
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get back, get back. Get back, get back.</font>

1117
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I think the coast is clear.
Let's go home.</font>

1118
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:04,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One moment.</font>

1119
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:06,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you not see what she was holding?</font>

1120
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:09,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was an apple. She wanted a snack.
What's the big deal?</font>

1121
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:13,339
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The golden apple. From the Tree of Life.</font>

1122
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:14,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From the Tree of Life.</font>

1123
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:17,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Wait, hold up, didn't you say
that was somewhere safe?</font>

1124
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Billy!
- Billy. Gosh.</font>

1125
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:25,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you going now?</font>

1126
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:34,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope.</font>

1127
01:08:35,486 --> 01:08:36,529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not in there.</font>

1128
01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:40,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope, nope. No, no, no.
That's a hard pass.</font>

1129
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's a hard pass.
- Yo, Billy,</font>

1130
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:43,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you don't gotta worry about that one.</font>

1131
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just a labyrinth
that doesn't go anywhere.</font>

1132
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Like an ancient Greek labyrinth?
- Guys.</font>

1133
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:51,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Porta-potty.</font>

1134
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:04,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hespera.</font>

1135
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:10,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's over, sisters.</font>

1136
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:14,651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we can plant the seed
and restore our realm.</font>

1137
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or we plant it in their realm.</font>

1138
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:21,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that would destroy their world.</font>

1139
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:25,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just as they destroyed ours.</font>

1140
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:26,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't be serious.</font>

1141
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- No.</font>

1142
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:30,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that's not what we agreed to.</font>

1143
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:32,585
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anthea, you simpering bore.</font>

1144
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:35,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's right, we've spent ages
waiting for this moment.</font>

1145
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:39,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have the seed.
We have the staff and its powers.</font>

1146
01:09:39,217 --> 01:09:42,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are not squandering it
for your personal satisfaction.</font>

1147
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:45,181
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I should go, not you.</font>

1148
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:46,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I know what you're thinking.</font>

1149
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The kid with the crutch
doesn't exactly sing "sneak thief."</font>

1150
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:50,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But here's the deal.</font>

1151
01:09:51,062 --> 01:09:52,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your knees crack like crazy when you walk.</font>

1152
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:53,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's pathetic.</font>

1153
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:54,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See?</font>

1154
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:57,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fortune be with you, Freddy.</font>

1155
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:59,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. What did you just call me?</font>

1156
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:02,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddy. Freddy Freeman.</font>

1157
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:06,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it. You nailed it.</font>

1158
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:07,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll see you on the other side.</font>

1159
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:12,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even if we did, the Tree of Life
would not thrive in their soil.</font>

1160
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It would despoil,
it would disfigure into something...</font>

1161
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Monstrous?</font>

1162
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is what humans are.</font>

1163
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:22,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is only fitting that we bring
our monsters to their world</font>

1164
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:25,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and do to them as they did to us.</font>

1165
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:30,977
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We agreed to restore balance</font>

1166
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and vengeance has great measure of weight
on those scales.</font>

1167
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:37,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anthea, humans are villains,
even to themselves.</font>

1168
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, not all.
- All.</font>

1169
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:42,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sister, I fear your rage
has gotten the better of you.</font>

1170
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:43,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

1171
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:46,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Humans wreak havoc and devastation,</font>

1172
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then pray to the gods to absolve them.</font>

1173
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:51,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They actually pray for order and peace</font>

1174
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:54,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when all they do
is dismantle it at every turn.</font>

1175
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:58,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anthea, I want you to take the apple
and plant it in our garden.</font>

1176
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course you turn to her.</font>

1177
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:03,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father would be ashamed of both of you.</font>

1178
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:06,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where did that even come from?</font>

1179
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:10,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi!
- You favor her, Hespera,</font>

1180
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and see how she betrays us.</font>

1181
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:17,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deliver him to his proper fate, sister.</font>

1182
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No!
- Kill him!</font>

1183
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:24,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

1184
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:26,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great question. No idea.</font>

1185
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:28,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But made you look.</font>

1186
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy!</font>

1187
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh.</font>

1188
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your crutch!</font>

1189
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:38,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shazam!</font>

1190
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:39,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes!
- No!</font>

1191
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:45,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, we have a lot to talk about.</font>

1192
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kalypso, hand me the staff.</font>

1193
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:01,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are not fit to wield it.</font>

1194
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:03,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More fit than you.</font>

1195
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:05,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had him in your hands yet did nothing.</font>

1196
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:07,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our sole purpose is to avenge our father,</font>

1197
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:10,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but everyone here has become weak.</font>

1198
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:13,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladon, world-eater,</font>

1199
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:16,666
<font face="Comic Sans MS">rise from the pit!</font>

1200
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:26,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, go!</font>

1201
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:29,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Captain Everypower! Where's he going?
- What the...</font>

1202
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:47,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Victor?</font>

1203
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:48,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Victor, wake up.</font>

1204
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello. Oh, God, woman. What?</font>

1205
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:53,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, we gotta go!</font>

1206
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We gotta get out of here.
- We have to go right now!</font>

1207
01:12:56,581 --> 01:12:58,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is funny, right?
I know what this looks like.</font>

1208
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not true.
I have no idea what this looks like.</font>

1209
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:01,084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just don't freak out.</font>

1210
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:08,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said, don't freak out!
Look at me, it's Billy.</font>

1211
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:10,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rosa, it's Billy, okay? And that's Eugene,</font>

1212
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:11,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and that's Freddy...
- It's me.</font>

1213
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...that's Darla and that's Mary, obvi,</font>

1214
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then Pedro, just normal Pedro.</font>

1215
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:19,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, this is no time for secrets, okay?
We have to tell 'em the truth.</font>

1216
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We're superheroes.
- I'm gay.</font>

1217
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:23,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we know, bud.</font>

1218
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:26,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You knew?
- Yeah.</font>

1219
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:29,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Oh.</font>

1220
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:31,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm the wizard.
- Oh, this is the wizard.</font>

1221
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:32,968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a wizard who's called "the wizard."</font>

1222
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:34,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, get dressed right now.
Come on, come on, come on, hurry up.</font>

1223
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:35,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta put on these clothes.</font>

1224
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:37,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is so weird.</font>

1225
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:38,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep, yep.</font>

1226
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:41,417
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys are the Philly Fiascoes?</font>

1227
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. This is in no way an acknowledgement</font>

1228
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of that stupid nickname,</font>

1229
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but, yes, that would be us.
Now, can you pick up the pace?</font>

1230
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to go. The dragon is here!</font>

1231
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:50,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dragon?</font>

1232
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:29,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

1233
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:31,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1234
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:35,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know this is a lot to take in,
but I promise to explain it all later.</font>

1235
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:36,764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Explain what?</font>

1236
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:39,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That our kids are superheroes
being hunted by Greek gods</font>

1237
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:40,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that used a dragon
to destroy the house we just bought?</font>

1238
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:43,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Wait, you bought the house?</font>

1239
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:44,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1240
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:52,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run! Go!</font>

1241
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:02,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

1242
01:15:05,292 --> 01:15:06,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down.</font>

1243
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, that's it!</font>

1244
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:12,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Again?</font>

1245
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:14,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddy!</font>

1246
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:20,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey! This is what you want, right?</font>

1247
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:36,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, we're good. We're good.</font>

1248
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're safe right now. Let's go. Let's go.</font>

1249
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:04,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mary.</font>

1250
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:07,104
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1251
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:48,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Are you okay?</font>

1252
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

1253
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:52,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

1254
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:56,570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, where is this dragon?</font>

1255
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:26,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fitting place for a garden.</font>

1256
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:02,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go! Let's go, let's go!</font>

1257
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:10,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, I'm slipping! Slipping!</font>

1258
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:13,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My shoe!</font>

1259
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:34,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy moly.</font>

1260
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:58,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I never thought
I'd say this about a dragon,</font>

1261
01:20:58,228 --> 01:21:00,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it is the least
of our problems right now.</font>

1262
01:21:04,318 --> 01:21:05,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your world will not survive this.</font>

1263
01:21:05,736 --> 01:21:06,820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, no shit, Merlin!</font>

1264
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:08,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's right.</font>

1265
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:10,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anne!</font>

1266
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you okay? Are you hurt?
- I'm okay, I'm fine.</font>

1267
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the God Realm, this tree</font>

1268
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:19,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a thing of beauty.</font>

1269
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:20,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of peace.</font>

1270
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:23,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was not meant
for the soil of this realm</font>

1271
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's become monstrous
by the hand that planted it.</font>

1272
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:28,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whose side is she on, anyway? Do you...</font>

1273
01:21:28,175 --> 01:21:29,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I must try to sway Hespera.</font>

1274
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:32,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only she can subdue our sister.</font>

1275
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:34,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will give it my all, or die trying.</font>

1276
01:21:34,348 --> 01:21:35,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Die? No, I'm pretty sure</font>

1277
01:21:35,766 --> 01:21:37,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we can come up with
an alternative to dying.</font>

1278
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:39,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My sweet Freddy, I'm ready if need be.</font>

1279
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:41,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've lived a long life.</font>

1280
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:42,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about,
"Lived a long life"?</font>

1281
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:43,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're the same age.
You're young. We're young.</font>

1282
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:46,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm over 6,000 years old.</font>

1283
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:50,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look great.</font>

1284
01:21:57,162 --> 01:21:58,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suddenly seems inappropriate.</font>

1285
01:21:58,914 --> 01:21:59,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1286
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:10,134
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't let her die. She called me sweet!</font>

1287
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:11,885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to figure something out.</font>

1288
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:14,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take my powers back.</font>

1289
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:15,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, Billy!
- No, no, no.</font>

1290
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:16,765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, hey, take my powers back.</font>

1291
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:18,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gave 'em to me,
so you can take 'em back, right?</font>

1292
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am no longer the Champion. You are!</font>

1293
01:22:21,019 --> 01:22:23,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think I know how to fix this, dude,
but I really don't, okay?</font>

1294
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:26,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't even know
who those Greek sisters were.</font>

1295
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:27,961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to Google them.
But you know who they are,</font>

1296
01:22:27,985 --> 01:22:29,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which means you know what to do.</font>

1297
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:30,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you were right.</font>

1298
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You picked the wrong champion, man.</font>

1299
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:35,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, that's why
I always say "all or none," right?</font>

1300
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:37,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because without my family, I'm nothing.</font>

1301
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:42,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And honestly,
I have no idea what I'm doin'.</font>

1302
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:44,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1303
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:47,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have a shred of wisdom
in that brain of yours.</font>

1304
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But your heart is wise.</font>

1305
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:53,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it knows exactly what must be done.</font>

1306
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:58,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I spent millennia
searching for a worthy champion</font>

1307
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:02,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and no one was worthy
of what I once shared</font>

1308
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:04,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with my brothers and sisters.</font>

1309
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:06,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But when you shared your powers,</font>

1310
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:09,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you did not hesitate.</font>

1311
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:13,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For you, everyone can be worthy
if given a chance.</font>

1312
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:16,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, go fight for your family.</font>

1313
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:18,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go fight for the world.</font>

1314
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:21,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I chose right when I chose you.</font>

1315
01:23:25,375 --> 01:23:26,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy?</font>

1316
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:28,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy, what are we gonna do, man?</font>

1317
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:31,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Same thing we always do, Freddy.
Save the goddarn world.</font>

1318
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I'm gonna go get that staff</font>

1319
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:34,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I need you to lure these things away</font>

1320
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:37,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from the stadium
while I deal with the dragon, all right?</font>

1321
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait, wait. Billy, Billy.</font>

1322
01:23:39,556 --> 01:23:41,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I just see you before you go?</font>

1323
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:43,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not this version.</font>

1324
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"You" you.</font>

1325
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:47,146
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My Billy.</font>

1326
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:54,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shazam!</font>

1327
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that why the house keeps
getting struck by lightning?</font>

1328
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:03,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1329
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:12,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise after this,</font>

1330
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:14,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if I don't get eaten by a dragon,</font>

1331
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:17,302
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not gonna force you to keep me.</font>

1332
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay?
- What?</font>

1333
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:21,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know I age out soon.</font>

1334
01:24:22,683 --> 01:24:23,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy.</font>

1335
01:24:24,518 --> 01:24:27,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My wonderful, kind, brave son.</font>

1336
01:24:28,855 --> 01:24:30,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will never age out of your home.</font>

1337
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:33,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Never.</font>

1338
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:38,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, do me a favor,</font>

1339
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:42,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I mean this
from the bottom of my heart,</font>

1340
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:44,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">go kick their ass, okay?</font>

1341
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:47,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, Mom.</font>

1342
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:49,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, too.</font>

1343
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:53,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shazam!</font>

1344
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:00,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's gonna take some getting used to.</font>

1345
01:25:01,346 --> 01:25:03,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody to the battle wagon!</font>

1346
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:04,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The battle wagon?</font>

1347
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:07,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trying to get into the spirit of things.</font>

1348
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:27,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you see
what you're doing to these people?</font>

1349
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:28,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do.</font>

1350
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what I see is just.</font>

1351
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:32,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hespera, look at this tree.</font>

1352
01:25:33,003 --> 01:25:35,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is blighted. It is unnatural here.</font>

1353
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:38,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We made a vow to restore our realm,
not destroy another.</font>

1354
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:40,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A god has answered their prayers at last.</font>

1355
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:44,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They did not know their place,
so I am showing it to them.</font>

1356
01:25:44,931 --> 01:25:48,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your fanatical tone
echoes our Uncle Hades.</font>

1357
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I'm putting an end to this.</font>

1358
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:01,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hespera.</font>

1359
01:26:08,955 --> 01:26:10,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hespera.</font>

1360
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:14,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If your emotions rest
with the humans so, Anne,</font>

1361
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:16,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then perhaps you should be human.</font>

1362
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:14,813
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Help, somebody!</font>

1363
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody help!</font>

1364
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:17,899
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody help!</font>

1365
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:31,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, now what?
There are only so many minotaurs</font>

1366
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:32,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can run over with this van.</font>

1367
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:38,587
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Steve.</font>

1368
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:41,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are monsters afraid of?</font>

1369
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:46,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The king of beasts."</font>

1370
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:47,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lions?</font>

1371
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:48,972
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unicorns.</font>

1372
01:27:49,055 --> 01:27:51,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? I love unicorns.</font>

1373
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:53,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yet the unicorn does not love you.</font>

1374
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:55,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, unicorns don't exist.</font>

1375
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:57,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1376
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my...</font>

1377
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:03,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess maybe it's not so crazy.</font>

1378
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:06,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The unicorn is the most fearsome creature
of its realm.</font>

1379
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:09,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ruthless and cruel,
not like the ponies from your storybooks.</font>

1380
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:11,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They loathe humanity.</font>

1381
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:12,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there anything they do like?</font>

1382
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:16,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Dark caverns." "Ambrosia"?</font>

1383
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ambrosia.
It's like the nectar of the gods.</font>

1384
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:19,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's supposed to be sweet, like honey.</font>

1385
01:28:19,753 --> 01:28:20,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have an idea.</font>

1386
01:28:21,004 --> 01:28:22,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go! Quick, quick.</font>

1387
01:28:22,631 --> 01:28:25,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, get as many of these people
to safety as you can.</font>

1388
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:27,301
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kids?</font>

1389
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:33,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's go.
- Come on, let's go!</font>

1390
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:35,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wizard?</font>

1391
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:36,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going with them.</font>

1392
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:38,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddy?</font>

1393
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:42,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anne?</font>

1394
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:45,945
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anne! Anne!</font>

1395
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:51,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am not entirely sure how to parent here.</font>

1396
01:28:59,376 --> 01:29:00,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Khaleesi!</font>

1397
01:29:14,224 --> 01:29:17,143
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was really satisfying.</font>

1398
01:29:17,227 --> 01:29:18,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How was that for you?</font>

1399
01:29:35,745 --> 01:29:37,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1400
01:29:37,414 --> 01:29:39,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We love you, Thundercrack.</font>

1401
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:41,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the best, Captain Marvel.</font>

1402
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:43,378
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, go, High Voltage!
- Oh, wassup, bro?</font>

1403
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Maximum Voltage, actually,
amongst other names.</font>

1404
01:29:46,089 --> 01:29:47,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're still kinda workshopping it, so...</font>

1405
01:29:54,973 --> 01:29:58,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You thought you were invulnerable. But no.</font>

1406
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:00,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Magical fire.</font>

1407
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:02,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Magic can kill magic.</font>

1408
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:05,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah, yeah, "Magic kills magic."
Way ahead of you, lady.</font>

1409
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:08,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just trippin' out because
I've never seen my suit burn like this.</font>

1410
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:11,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also, nobody messes with my town!</font>

1411
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Know what I'm saying?</font>

1412
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:15,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I defeated my traitor sister.</font>

1413
01:30:15,142 --> 01:30:16,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A god.</font>

1414
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:18,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think I won't destroy you?</font>

1415
01:31:05,919 --> 01:31:07,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The staff is absorbing it all.</font>

1416
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:09,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a battery.</font>

1417
01:31:15,512 --> 01:31:16,721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

1418
01:31:17,263 --> 01:31:18,264
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run!</font>

1419
01:31:19,015 --> 01:31:20,141
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a terrible idea.</font>

1420
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:22,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't understand
the savagery, the barbarity.</font>

1421
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:27,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

1422
01:31:56,594 --> 01:31:58,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello.
- No.</font>

1423
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:03,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. Come here.</font>

1424
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:08,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darla.</font>

1425
01:32:08,982 --> 01:32:11,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. Good girl.</font>

1426
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:20,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch out!</font>

1427
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:23,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darla!</font>

1428
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:46,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Taste the rainbow.</font>

1429
01:32:48,938 --> 01:32:49,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good, isn't it?</font>

1430
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:52,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the closest to ambrosia we have.</font>

1431
01:33:17,217 --> 01:33:18,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good girl.</font>

1432
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:36,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna need more Skittles.</font>

1433
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:15,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Taste the rainbow, mother...</font>

1434
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:37,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no, no! No!</font>

1435
01:34:37,755 --> 01:34:39,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lady, lady, you can't die!</font>

1436
01:34:39,132 --> 01:34:41,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Billy, come on!
Powers, powers, powers.</font>

1437
01:34:41,259 --> 01:34:44,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Medical powers. No.
How-to-fix-dead-people powers.</font>

1438
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:53,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clear?</font>

1439
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:56,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! One more time,
one more time. Clear!</font>

1440
01:34:56,983 --> 01:34:58,026
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop! Stop!</font>

1441
01:34:58,109 --> 01:35:00,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me go to the underworld
in peace, please.</font>

1442
01:35:00,945 --> 01:35:03,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, lady, lady, listen to me,
listen to me, okay?</font>

1443
01:35:03,907 --> 01:35:05,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want anyone else to die.</font>

1444
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:08,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not my family, not Anthea, not anyone,
and we can save them.</font>

1445
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:09,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This all came from the tree, right?</font>

1446
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:11,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I might know a way to destroy</font>

1447
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:12,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the tree and the dragon all in one.</font>

1448
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:16,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladon's powers are too great, boy.</font>

1449
01:35:16,294 --> 01:35:18,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, not if I can overload the staff</font>

1450
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:20,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- with enough lightning.
- A bomb?</font>

1451
01:35:21,424 --> 01:35:22,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that enough to kill the dragon?</font>

1452
01:35:22,759 --> 01:35:23,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And more.</font>

1453
01:35:25,595 --> 01:35:29,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You would annihilate
everything that's inside the dome.</font>

1454
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:32,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then I have one more favor to ask.</font>

1455
01:35:35,647 --> 01:35:38,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go, let's go. Let's go.
There's shelter ahead.</font>

1456
01:35:38,858 --> 01:35:41,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's shelter ahead. Let's go.</font>

1457
01:35:41,236 --> 01:35:43,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walk, don't run. There's shelter ahead.</font>

1458
01:35:44,113 --> 01:35:45,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go, let's go.</font>

1459
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:48,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep going. Keep going!</font>

1460
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:49,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anne!</font>

1461
01:35:49,786 --> 01:35:50,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anne!</font>

1462
01:35:51,829 --> 01:35:52,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anne!</font>

1463
01:36:01,047 --> 01:36:02,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go. Run.</font>

1464
01:36:02,257 --> 01:36:04,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch that rear.</font>

1465
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:18,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go, go, go!</font>

1466
01:36:26,864 --> 01:36:27,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back away!</font>

1467
01:36:27,991 --> 01:36:30,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Run, run, run!</font>

1468
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:40,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anne!</font>

1469
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:43,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladon, kill the traitor.</font>

1470
01:37:16,789 --> 01:37:18,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Impossible.</font>

1471
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:19,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bow him!</font>

1472
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:35,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I lost it. Freddy, I can't.</font>

1473
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:37,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is a god without her power?</font>

1474
01:37:38,227 --> 01:37:41,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The most powerful thing about you is you.</font>

1475
01:37:41,397 --> 01:37:42,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You taught me that.</font>

1476
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:52,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kill them!</font>

1477
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:12,387
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boom!</font>

1478
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:14,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That must be super disappointing
as a dragon.</font>

1479
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:18,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Assuming that you are one.</font>

1480
01:38:18,518 --> 01:38:20,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you fly, and you breathe fire,</font>

1481
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:22,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you're also made of wood,
which is a weird flex</font>

1482
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:24,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a serious design flaw,
if I'm being honest.</font>

1483
01:38:26,526 --> 01:38:27,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddy, Anthea, don't!</font>

1484
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:33,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, made you look!</font>

1485
01:38:33,116 --> 01:38:34,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, lady, that's twice.</font>

1486
01:38:34,534 --> 01:38:36,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I didn't even need
a flaming violin that time.</font>

1487
01:38:38,496 --> 01:38:40,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want the staff? Come get it.</font>

1488
01:39:15,366 --> 01:39:16,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, Hespera.</font>

1489
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:20,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, Hespera.</font>

1490
01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:25,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, now.</font>

1491
01:40:26,062 --> 01:40:29,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No! No!</font>

1492
01:40:53,256 --> 01:40:54,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remove the dome.</font>

1493
01:40:54,632 --> 01:40:56,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As long as I still breathe,</font>

1494
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the dome still stands.</font>

1495
01:41:00,263 --> 01:41:04,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Till I see you on the other side, sister.</font>

1496
01:41:47,685 --> 01:41:48,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy!</font>

1497
01:41:49,145 --> 01:41:50,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get out of there.
- I can't.</font>

1498
01:41:50,896 --> 01:41:52,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy.</font>

1499
01:41:52,148 --> 01:41:53,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to do this.</font>

1500
01:41:56,068 --> 01:41:58,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy, what are you doing?
You're not supposed to be in there.</font>

1501
01:41:58,738 --> 01:42:00,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I am.</font>

1502
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:03,927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I used to think that
I couldn't do anything right,</font>

1503
01:42:03,951 --> 01:42:05,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I didn't deserve my powers but,</font>

1504
01:42:07,496 --> 01:42:08,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's something that I can do.</font>

1505
01:42:09,165 --> 01:42:10,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1506
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:12,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can save all of you.</font>

1507
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:14,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's all or none!</font>

1508
01:42:14,503 --> 01:42:15,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1509
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:17,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of my family gets to live
and none of them gets hurt.</font>

1510
01:42:21,218 --> 01:42:23,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddy, I've never had a family.
You know that.</font>

1511
01:42:24,013 --> 01:42:25,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody I've ever cared about,
they all left me.</font>

1512
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:27,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mom, my dad, everyone.</font>

1513
01:42:29,268 --> 01:42:30,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So when I found you guys, I had to hang on</font>

1514
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:32,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I've been hanging on too tight.</font>

1515
01:42:32,362 --> 01:42:33,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1516
01:42:33,606 --> 01:42:35,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should have let you do your own thing.</font>

1517
01:42:37,068 --> 01:42:38,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now it's time for you to fly.</font>

1518
01:42:39,278 --> 01:42:40,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about you?</font>

1519
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:46,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Captain Everypower Junior.</font>

1520
01:42:49,372 --> 01:42:50,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you forget it.</font>

1521
01:43:43,509 --> 01:43:45,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We end this now.</font>

1522
01:43:45,511 --> 01:43:47,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. We do.</font>

1523
01:43:58,691 --> 01:43:59,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Billy.</font>

1524
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:31,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got this. We got this.
He's got this. He's got this.</font>

1525
01:44:31,599 --> 01:44:32,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy.</font>

1526
01:44:37,104 --> 01:44:38,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fly.</font>

1527
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:51,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy.</font>

1528
01:44:52,703 --> 01:44:54,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, baby. Come on, let's go!</font>

1529
01:45:01,629 --> 01:45:03,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1530
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:56,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shazam!</font>

1531
01:47:13,886 --> 01:47:14,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy.</font>

1532
01:47:15,804 --> 01:47:19,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A true god, after all.</font>

1533
01:48:12,277 --> 01:48:13,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He did it.</font>

1534
01:48:21,245 --> 01:48:22,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We must go.</font>

1535
01:48:29,753 --> 01:48:30,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy?</font>

1536
01:48:31,338 --> 01:48:32,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy?</font>

1537
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:34,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy!</font>

1538
01:48:36,385 --> 01:48:37,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy!</font>

1539
01:48:39,096 --> 01:48:40,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy, where are you?</font>

1540
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:42,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy!</font>

1541
01:48:44,727 --> 01:48:45,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy?</font>

1542
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:51,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy! Billy.</font>

1543
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:56,363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy! Billy!</font>

1544
01:48:57,614 --> 01:49:00,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy! Dude, wake up. You did it.</font>

1545
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:04,663
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. You're supposed to wake up.</font>

1546
01:49:04,747 --> 01:49:05,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the part where
you're supposed to wake up,</font>

1547
01:49:05,998 --> 01:49:07,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're supposed
to open your eyes and laugh,</font>

1548
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:10,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're supposed to say you got me,
'cause you got me.</font>

1549
01:49:12,129 --> 01:49:13,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude. Joke's over, man.</font>

1550
01:49:14,673 --> 01:49:15,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy!</font>

1551
01:49:17,718 --> 01:49:19,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy. Billy, come on.</font>

1552
01:49:22,389 --> 01:49:23,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freddy.</font>

1553
01:49:26,852 --> 01:49:28,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you do?</font>

1554
01:49:30,689 --> 01:49:31,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wake up, Billy.</font>

1555
01:49:31,648 --> 01:49:33,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Billy?
- He's over here!</font>

1556
01:49:36,487 --> 01:49:37,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy.</font>

1557
01:49:39,156 --> 01:49:41,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You asshole!</font>

1558
01:49:42,701 --> 01:49:44,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're a team! We're a team!</font>

1559
01:49:46,121 --> 01:49:47,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Billy.</font>

1560
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:49,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Billy.</font>

1561
01:49:49,875 --> 01:49:51,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my baby. No.</font>

1562
01:49:56,632 --> 01:49:57,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was a hero.</font>

1563
01:49:59,718 --> 01:50:01,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was a hero and a god.</font>

1564
01:50:02,346 --> 01:50:04,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he should be laid to rest like one.</font>

1565
01:50:08,811 --> 01:50:09,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, pal.</font>

1566
01:51:18,422 --> 01:51:19,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will this land ever come back?</font>

1567
01:51:21,383 --> 01:51:23,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The staff is drained of magic.</font>

1568
01:51:23,969 --> 01:51:27,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only the spark of a god
can restore its power</font>

1569
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:29,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and there are no gods left.</font>

1570
01:51:30,893 --> 01:51:32,102
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is one.</font>

1571
01:51:50,913 --> 01:51:51,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1572
01:53:19,668 --> 01:53:20,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a zombie!</font>

1573
01:53:22,170 --> 01:53:23,964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys!</font>

1574
01:53:24,881 --> 01:53:26,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>

1575
01:53:26,174 --> 01:53:27,384
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You buried me?</font>

1576
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:30,304
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In what, like, 2 minutes?</font>

1577
01:53:30,721 --> 01:53:31,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Billy!</font>

1578
01:53:33,557 --> 01:53:34,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1579
01:53:34,558 --> 01:53:36,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, man. I missed you guys.</font>

1580
01:53:39,896 --> 01:53:40,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. Hey.</font>

1581
01:53:42,774 --> 01:53:44,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. Hi.</font>

1582
01:53:44,276 --> 01:53:45,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't anybody tell me...</font>

1583
01:53:45,944 --> 01:53:47,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. Sorry, sorry.</font>

1584
01:53:48,030 --> 01:53:50,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't see you there,</font>

1585
01:53:50,991 --> 01:53:52,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was dead at the time.</font>

1586
01:53:55,412 --> 01:53:56,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you got my bird letter?</font>

1587
01:53:57,914 --> 01:53:58,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I...</font>

1588
01:54:01,001 --> 01:54:02,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you've got something.</font>

1589
01:54:04,046 --> 01:54:05,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On my...</font>

1590
01:54:05,422 --> 01:54:06,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where? Oh.</font>

1591
01:54:07,507 --> 01:54:08,507
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1592
01:54:09,509 --> 01:54:10,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a spider.</font>

1593
01:54:10,594 --> 01:54:11,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, that's disgusting.</font>

1594
01:54:12,054 --> 01:54:14,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also, that's really embarrassing.</font>

1595
01:54:14,598 --> 01:54:15,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, it is.</font>

1596
01:54:15,766 --> 01:54:17,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it was an amazing thing you did.</font>

1597
01:54:18,393 --> 01:54:19,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sacrifice you made.</font>

1598
01:54:20,395 --> 01:54:22,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You brought this world back to life.</font>

1599
01:54:23,398 --> 01:54:26,777
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe this time, gods and humans
can learn to live in peace.</font>

1600
01:54:27,444 --> 01:54:28,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1601
01:54:29,613 --> 01:54:31,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Use the power of Zeus wisely.</font>

1602
01:54:33,992 --> 01:54:35,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be well, Billy Batson.</font>

1603
01:54:37,704 --> 01:54:41,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you know, just because
your father's power is surging through me,</font>

1604
01:54:41,625 --> 01:54:44,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that doesn't technically
make us related, you know,</font>

1605
01:54:44,169 --> 01:54:47,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm gonna be 18
in, like, 5 months, so...</font>

1606
01:54:47,547 --> 01:54:49,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stick to saving the world, kid.</font>

1607
01:54:49,758 --> 01:54:51,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you know, like, that's...
Okay, cool.</font>

1608
01:54:51,718 --> 01:54:53,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See ya.</font>

1609
01:54:53,428 --> 01:54:55,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's with our boys and older women?</font>

1610
01:54:57,974 --> 01:54:58,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1611
01:54:59,893 --> 01:55:01,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who wants their powers back?</font>

1612
01:55:03,397 --> 01:55:04,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can do that, right?</font>

1613
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:07,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay, good. Good, good, good.</font>

1614
01:55:07,609 --> 01:55:09,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like our house back.</font>

1615
01:55:09,694 --> 01:55:11,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we do that?</font>

1616
01:55:12,781 --> 01:55:14,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dinner!
- Coming.</font>

1617
01:55:14,866 --> 01:55:17,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aw. Thank you for respecting
the cross-stitch.</font>

1618
01:55:21,790 --> 01:55:22,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anthea.</font>

1619
01:55:22,916 --> 01:55:24,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you decided what you're gonna do</font>

1620
01:55:24,251 --> 01:55:26,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about that god realm of yours?</font>

1621
01:55:26,837 --> 01:55:29,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, actually, I'm gonna take
some time off while it heals.</font>

1622
01:55:29,548 --> 01:55:31,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spend some time with the common folk.</font>

1623
01:55:31,716 --> 01:55:33,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Learn some about your world,</font>

1624
01:55:33,218 --> 01:55:35,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about how, maybe,
we can learn from each other.</font>

1625
01:55:35,762 --> 01:55:37,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Number one sign of wisdom:</font>

1626
01:55:37,472 --> 01:55:39,182
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Admitting there's always more to learn.</font>

1627
01:55:39,266 --> 01:55:40,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming around to it.</font>

1628
01:55:42,602 --> 01:55:43,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it.</font>

1629
01:55:49,860 --> 01:55:51,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys?</font>

1630
01:55:52,112 --> 01:55:53,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys!</font>

1631
01:56:00,662 --> 01:56:01,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the wizard.</font>

1632
01:56:03,415 --> 01:56:05,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my God!
- No way!</font>

1633
01:56:05,584 --> 01:56:07,002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- Look at this guy!</font>

1634
01:56:07,085 --> 01:56:08,420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at him, he's so handsome.</font>

1635
01:56:08,837 --> 01:56:10,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You pimpin' now, what is this?</font>

1636
01:56:10,130 --> 01:56:11,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You look amazing.
- You look great!</font>

1637
01:56:11,798 --> 01:56:13,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I was in the neighborhood</font>

1638
01:56:13,049 --> 01:56:15,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I just wanted to express my gratitude</font>

1639
01:56:15,635 --> 01:56:18,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before I go.</font>

1640
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:21,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. Doorbell's broken.
Actually, everything's broken.</font>

1641
01:56:22,476 --> 01:56:23,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not everything.</font>

1642
01:56:26,771 --> 01:56:28,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were just in the neighborhood?</font>

1643
01:56:28,482 --> 01:56:30,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I came for the staff.</font>

1644
01:56:30,775 --> 01:56:32,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps I will hold onto it for now.</font>

1645
01:56:32,819 --> 01:56:36,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I also wanted to see your faces
one last time</font>

1646
01:56:36,865 --> 01:56:38,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before I turn into a pile of ash.</font>

1647
01:56:38,575 --> 01:56:39,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wait, what?
- No!</font>

1648
01:56:39,993 --> 01:56:42,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am making a joke.
I have an Uber waiting.</font>

1649
01:56:42,245 --> 01:56:43,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And besides,</font>

1650
01:56:43,622 --> 01:56:46,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been trapped in rocks and prisons
for far too long.</font>

1651
01:56:46,958 --> 01:56:48,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's time to see your world.</font>

1652
01:56:49,044 --> 01:56:50,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been an honor,</font>

1653
01:56:50,879 --> 01:56:52,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a privilege, watching you all soar.</font>

1654
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:54,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, you're not such a bad wizard.</font>

1655
01:56:54,633 --> 01:56:55,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Jeff.</font>

1656
01:56:56,426 --> 01:56:57,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It never ends.</font>

1657
01:56:59,346 --> 01:57:00,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also,</font>

1658
01:57:01,765 --> 01:57:03,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what's my superhero name?</font>

1659
01:57:05,894 --> 01:57:08,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your name is</font>

1660
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:10,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shazam.</font>

1661
01:57:11,399 --> 01:57:12,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Of course.
- Yeah.</font>

1662
01:57:16,029 --> 01:57:17,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I still think we can beat it.</font>

1663
01:59:57,607 --> 01:59:59,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My feet hurt. How much further?</font>

1664
01:59:59,317 --> 02:00:02,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About 10 seconds less
than the last time you asked me.</font>

1665
02:00:02,112 --> 02:00:05,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, I just feel like we could
have parked a little bit closer.</font>

1666
02:00:05,031 --> 02:00:07,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He doesn't know we're coming,
and I didn't want to spook him.</font>

1667
02:00:07,617 --> 02:00:09,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Spook him." He's a superhero, not a deer.</font>

1668
02:00:10,078 --> 02:00:11,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's go.</font>

1669
02:00:11,496 --> 02:00:13,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then you can tell Waller
that even though</font>

1670
02:00:13,623 --> 02:00:15,863
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she thinks this guy could be
a good addition to the team,</font>

1671
02:00:15,917 --> 02:00:19,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we never actually met him
because you wore shitty walking shoes.</font>

1672
02:00:19,921 --> 02:00:23,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, first of all, they're boots,
and they're not shitty, they're new.</font>

1673
02:00:23,633 --> 02:00:24,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just haven't had a chance
to break them in yet.</font>

1674
02:00:24,843 --> 02:00:25,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up.</font>

1675
02:00:26,845 --> 02:00:29,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Waller said this guy is
as powerful as they come,</font>

1676
02:00:29,472 --> 02:00:30,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but a little immature.</font>

1677
02:00:31,683 --> 02:00:32,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, great.</font>

1678
02:00:45,113 --> 02:00:46,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Billy Batson.
- Yeah?</font>

1679
02:00:46,656 --> 02:00:47,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, no.</font>

1680
02:00:48,491 --> 02:00:51,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never heard that name in my life.
I don't know who you're talking about.</font>

1681
02:00:51,578 --> 02:00:53,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'd like to meet that person</font>

1682
02:00:53,288 --> 02:00:54,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause they sound super cool. And funny.</font>

1683
02:00:54,998 --> 02:00:59,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And talented. And ridiculously handsome,
but like in a dangerous way.</font>

1684
02:00:59,252 --> 02:01:01,171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell are you talking about?</font>

1685
02:01:01,254 --> 02:01:02,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax. We know who you are.</font>

1686
02:01:03,798 --> 02:01:05,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How?
- Don't worry about that.</font>

1687
02:01:06,676 --> 02:01:07,761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you guys?</font>

1688
02:01:07,844 --> 02:01:09,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry about that either.</font>

1689
02:01:09,220 --> 02:01:10,847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, we've seen what you can do.</font>

1690
02:01:10,930 --> 02:01:12,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we're here to make you an offer.</font>

1691
02:01:12,766 --> 02:01:14,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How would you like to join the Justice...
- Yes!</font>

1692
02:01:15,185 --> 02:01:16,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A thousand times yes!</font>

1693
02:01:16,436 --> 02:01:18,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my gosh!
I've been dreaming about this!</font>

1694
02:01:19,230 --> 02:01:20,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I mean, not this exactly.</font>

1695
02:01:20,482 --> 02:01:22,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, normally, it's Wonder Woman
in the dream, but...</font>

1696
02:01:22,734 --> 02:01:24,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ew.</font>

1697
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:25,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that was easy.</font>

1698
02:01:26,571 --> 02:01:27,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to the Justice Society.</font>

1699
02:01:27,989 --> 02:01:29,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah! Awesome. Wait, what?</font>

1700
02:01:30,074 --> 02:01:31,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Justice Society?</font>

1701
02:01:31,367 --> 02:01:32,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that different than the Justice League?</font>

1702
02:01:32,827 --> 02:01:36,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. The Justice Society
is different than the Justice League</font>

1703
02:01:36,039 --> 02:01:37,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because of how words work.</font>

1704
02:01:37,832 --> 02:01:39,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want to be
in the Wonder Woman group.</font>

1705
02:01:39,793 --> 02:01:42,003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So that's you guys, right?
- No.</font>

1706
02:01:42,086 --> 02:01:44,130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you so obsessed
with Wonder Woman, dude?</font>

1707
02:01:44,214 --> 02:01:45,214
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's joking, right?</font>

1708
02:01:46,132 --> 02:01:48,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No?
- Okay. I'm out.</font>

1709
02:01:49,427 --> 02:01:51,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna wait here, 'cause of the shoes.</font>

1710
02:01:51,429 --> 02:01:53,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you drive by and get me?</font>

1711
02:01:53,473 --> 02:01:55,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, just a little constructive criticism.</font>

1712
02:01:56,059 --> 02:01:59,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's pretty confusing that there are
two separate groups of superheroes</font>

1713
02:01:59,312 --> 02:02:00,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that are totally unaffiliated,</font>

1714
02:02:00,647 --> 02:02:02,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but both have "Justice"
in their name, you know.</font>

1715
02:02:02,649 --> 02:02:04,943
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, have you guys ever thought
about doing a rebranding of sorts?</font>

1716
02:02:05,026 --> 02:02:08,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause just a quick search
on Thesaurus.com,</font>

1717
02:02:08,279 --> 02:02:09,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you got so many options, man.</font>

1718
02:02:09,823 --> 02:02:11,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, "Authority Society."</font>

1719
02:02:12,826 --> 02:02:14,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Code Society." That's stupid.</font>

1720
02:02:14,994 --> 02:02:16,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are, like, legal terms.</font>

1721
02:02:16,246 --> 02:02:19,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The Avenger society."</font>

1722
02:02:20,834 --> 02:02:22,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like that for some reason.</font>

1723
02:08:58,147 --> 02:09:01,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, well, Doctor. We meet again.</font>

1724
02:09:01,859 --> 02:09:03,653
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where in the hell have you been?</font>

1725
02:09:03,736 --> 02:09:06,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To implement the perfect plan, Doctor,</font>

1726
02:09:06,864 --> 02:09:09,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one must have patience.</font>

1727
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:10,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?</font>

1728
02:09:12,495 --> 02:09:14,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been 2 goddamn years!</font>

1729
02:09:14,413 --> 02:09:19,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. But what is time
but a trick of the mind?</font>

1730
02:09:19,252 --> 02:09:20,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A meaningless measure.</font>

1731
02:09:20,836 --> 02:09:23,381
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. I'm 57 years old.</font>

1732
02:09:23,464 --> 02:09:26,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm stuck in a concrete box
surrounded by lunatics</font>

1733
02:09:26,676 --> 02:09:28,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">waiting for a worm to enact some, what,</font>

1734
02:09:28,886 --> 02:09:31,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">vague plan I've been told
absolutely nothing about?</font>

1735
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:33,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It takes me a very long time
to get places, okay?</font>

1736
02:09:33,891 --> 02:09:36,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do not have legs, I do not have wings,</font>

1737
02:09:36,978 --> 02:09:40,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just slither around endlessly.</font>

1738
02:09:40,189 --> 02:09:42,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But not for long.</font>

1739
02:09:45,528 --> 02:09:47,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me everything.</font>

1740
02:09:48,739 --> 02:09:50,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just one more thing I need to do.</font>

1741
02:09:50,574 --> 02:09:52,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No!</font>

1742
02:09:54,495 --> 02:09:56,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, goddamn it!</font>
