1
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:09,174
I'm in the woods.

2
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,877
I'm tired, cold, and hungry,

3
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,345
and I'm being hunted!

4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,613
Aah!

5
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:17,850
Jade, I thought
you were going
to gather firewood.

6
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:23,355
Hello. Have you learned
nothing from the movies?

7
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,556
Whoever gets the firewood

8
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:26,992
is always the creeping
terror's first victim.

9
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:29,795
So that's what happened
to the other little girl

10
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:31,830
I sent out for firewood.

11
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:34,099
Very funny.

12
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:42,307
I thought
Mr. excitement there
was going to guide us

13
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,643
straight to
the low-cost temple.

14
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:46,378
"Lotus" temple,

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,714
and I didn't ask you
to come along.

16
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:50,282
Yeah, well, I didn't
want to miss out

17
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:51,417
on all the fun.

18
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:53,152
Ancient wisdom:

19
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:55,387
Crouching tiger
is invisible

20
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,689
until teeth flash
in moonlight.

21
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,326
Well, duh.
Can we go home?

22
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:03,295
Jade, it's
very important

23
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,097
that we locate
the lotus temple.

24
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,067
Somewhere inside is
the scroll of hung-chao.

25
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,669
It holds inscriptions
of great power.

26
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,707
Ancient wisdom:

27
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:19,945
Words are breath that blows
the fire of knowledge.

28
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,347
Yes! And our fire
needs wood. Go.

29
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,984
Oh, stay in sight
of the camp.

30
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:37,196
Stay in sight,
like, I was going to...

31
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,201
Get lost.

32
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:44,536
Oh, boy. This is
exactly what happens

33
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:47,106
before the creeping terror
shows up.

34
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,442
No problem.

35
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,244
I'll just retrace my steps.

36
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:53,378
Uhh!

37
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:58,951
Aah!

38
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:07,226
Ok. This was
not here before.

39
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,201
(Crying)

40
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,204
Ohh.

41
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:20,706
You should
not be here.

42
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:22,841
Why? What's the matter?

43
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,143
Why are you crying?

44
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:26,311
Run from this place.
Please!

45
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,616
(Roars)

46
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,921
Whoa. Talk about
a mood swing.

47
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,612
Jade! Ohh, I told
her to stay close.

48
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,080
She never listens.

49
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,748
Ancient wisdom:

50
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,384
The foolish monkey
chases its tail

51
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,220
and catches trouble.

52
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,656
Mm. I should have
brought a map.

53
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:46,825
Jade!

54
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,194
(Growls)

55
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,329
Uhh!

56
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,863
Ohh.

57
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,499
Aah!

58
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,471
This is exactly why

59
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,573
I didn't want
to go get firewood.

60
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,841
(Roars)

61
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,053
(Growls)

62
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,188
Aah!

63
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,067
Aah!

64
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,606
Whew.

65
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,741
Aah!

66
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:37,509
(Growls)

67
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:38,844
Whoooooa!

68
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:42,981
(Growls)

69
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,249
Grrrrr.

70
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,019
Aah!

71
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:48,287
(Roars)

72
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,823
Psych.

73
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,961
(Roaring)

74
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,898
Whoooooa!

75
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,471
(Roaring in pain)

76
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,983
(Breathless)
I humbly...

77
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,651
Beg forgiveness.

78
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,587
It is the power
of the lotus temple

79
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,855
that changes me.

80
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,925
I am forced to guard it
against all intruders.

81
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,461
Yeah, well,
you should put up

82
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:31,930
a beware of monster
sign or something.

83
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:35,133
If you heard my tale,
you would understand.

84
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,234
Please.

85
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,270
Oh, man.

86
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:39,371
I'll listen...

87
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:40,439
As long as
you don't get

88
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,441
all "grrr" on me.

89
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:45,177
5 years ago,
on an evening like this,

90
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,745
I wandered into the forest

91
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,447
against my father's wishes.

92
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:49,715
It grew dark,

93
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:51,817
and I was soon
lost in the bamboo.

94
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,119
Hey, same here.

95
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,822
Then, under the light
of the full moon,

96
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,792
the lotus temple appeared.

97
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,561
I thought
it was a miracle,

98
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,596
saving me from the cold.

99
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,999
The next morning,

100
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,570
with the first
rays of the sun,

101
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:14,272
the temple began
to disappear,

102
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:17,576
and I vanished
along with it.

103
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,611
Hold the cell phone.
Are you saying

104
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,513
this place only
exists at night?

105
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:24,082
Yes, and only
under a full moon.

106
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,485
Anyone trapped within
when the sun rises

107
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:29,388
becomes a temple guardian
and may never leave again.

108
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,490
Pretty good fairy tale,

109
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:32,991
but there's one hole
in your story.

110
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:35,293
Why weren't you attacked
by a temple guardian?

111
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:36,895
The previous guardian

112
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,997
found the means
to escape.

113
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,233
I've searched 5 years
for that secret,

114
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,634
but have not found it.

115
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,803
I miss my family so much.

116
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,171
Hmm.

117
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:48,039
I'm all about
beating the system.

118
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,474
Let's see.

119
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,675
You only go monstery

120
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,611
about intruders,
right?

121
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,846
So if you ask
for my help,

122
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,149
I'm not intruding.
I'm helping.

123
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,353
Please, would you
enter and assist me?

124
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:04,956
But if I grow horns,
flee at once!

125
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,391
You got it.

126
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,397
I am xu-lin.

127
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,732
I'm Jade.

128
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,539
Jade! Jade!

129
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,240
Oh, where is she?

130
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,444
Bwaa!

131
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:28,713
Perhaps the little
monkey is closer
than you think.

132
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,319
The lotus temple.

133
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,689
Are you coming?

134
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,357
I will wait here.

135
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,226
I would not want to...

136
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:42,527
Intrude.

137
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,234
This is the library.

138
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:53,004
Here lies the wisdom
of many ages.

139
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:56,875
Wow! I'll bet the secret
to escape is written
on one of these.

140
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,377
Aah! Aah! Aah!

141
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,013
Xu-lin?!

142
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,148
Jade!

143
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,216
I'm changing.

144
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,251
There must be an intruder.

145
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,620
Run, Jade! Hide!

146
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,457
Hey! I'm a guest.

147
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,960
But I sure feel
sorry for whoever--

148
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,461
uncle Jackie!

149
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,897
Jade?

150
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,675
(Growling)

151
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:32,878
Bwaa!

152
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,314
(Growls)

153
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,286
Uh, heh heh.

154
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,356
(Growls)
- Aah!

155
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,365
Bwaa!

156
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,770
Uncle Jackie!
Oh, man!

157
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:00,639
Which way? Which way?

158
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,509
Unh! Ohh!

159
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,246
Excuse me,

160
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,215
I'm just looking for...

161
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,083
Bwaa! Aah!

162
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,355
Ow!

163
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,059
(Roars)

164
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,314
Huh?

165
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,003
(Gasps)

166
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,440
Aah! Unh!

167
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,209
(Coughs)

168
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,117
(Roars)

169
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,251
Unh!

170
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,279
(Gurgling)

171
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,427
Bwaa!

172
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,029
Bwaa!

173
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,902
The scroll of hung-chao.

174
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,340
Dah!

175
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,242
Oof!

176
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:24,482
(Coughing)

177
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,919
Ohh...

178
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,087
Yaah!

179
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,827
Huh?

180
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,095
Uncle Jackie!

181
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,664
Are you--
what have you done
to xu-lin?!

182
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,099
She was a monster.

183
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,434
She attacked me.

184
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,569
Ohh, ohh.

185
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,105
Duh! It's her job.

186
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,640
She's the temple guardian.

187
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:51,342
It's a bizarro
temple power or something.

188
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:52,544
It turns her
into a monster

189
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:53,978
whenever
there are intruders.

190
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,380
Intruders?

191
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,116
I would not
want to...

192
00:11:58,118 --> 00:11:59,417
Intrude.

193
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,292
You knew about
the temple guardian.

194
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:10,128
Of course. Ancient wisdom:

195
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,297
The worm realizes
he is bait

196
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:14,933
only after
the fish bites.

197
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,501
Yah!
- Whoa! Ohh!

198
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,343
Hyah! Yah! Yah!

199
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,387
Yah!

200
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,724
Ugh! Intruders!

201
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,726
Tell me you aren't doing
what I think you're doing.

202
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,061
Unh! Ugh!

203
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,130
Uncle Jackie?

204
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,332
(Growling)

205
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,773
Jade! Run!

206
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,345
No! Wrong way! Wrong way!

207
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:02,814
Xu-lin! Stop!
That's my uncle.

208
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,282
He's to help you, too!

209
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,550
(Roars)

210
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,821
I don't think
she wants my help!

211
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,424
Ah, yes.

212
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,859
Intriguing.

213
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,435
Jade: Oh!

214
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,805
Jade!

215
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,606
I'm ok.
Help xu-lin!

216
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,452
Jade!

217
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:42,854
(Xu-lin moans)

218
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,656
Ancient wisdom:

219
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:47,025
The cornered rat
finds peace...

220
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,493
In eternity.

221
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,579
The door!

222
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:08,980
Uncle Jackie, wait!

223
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:10,481
Ow!

224
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,821
I tried to tell you,
she's trapped here.

225
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,089
It's some kind
of curse.

226
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,224
Ohh.

227
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,161
Leave me, Jade.
Escape while
you can.

228
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:25,597
No! We're going
to find a cure

229
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,799
or an antidote
or something.

230
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,267
Right, uncle Jackie?

231
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:30,735
We will try.

232
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,210
Unh! Aah!

233
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,515
Jade, I'm changing.

234
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:45,750
No biggie.

235
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,619
Stay calm.
Just try
to remember,

236
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:50,121
I am your guest
and uncle Jackie...

237
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,324
He is invited.

238
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,726
Good girl!

239
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:07,605
No more palm blasting!

240
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,774
You think that
is the only power

241
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,010
granted by the scroll
of hung-chao?

242
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,978
<i>Haison! Haison! Haison!</i>

243
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,787
Xu-lin, what happened
with the monster bit?

244
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,355
Go hulk already!

245
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:25,690
Too weak.

246
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,530
Huh? Unh!

247
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:13,304
Ancient wisdom:
The wise man
never walks out

248
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,173
on free
entertainment.

249
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,016
Hey! How come you
can leave the temple?

250
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,890
Xu-lin? Wake up! Wake up!

251
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,195
Get him, uncle Jackie!

252
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:38,930
Get who?

253
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,633
Jackie,

254
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,068
your hands! Look!

255
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,436
Huh?

256
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:48,406
No more palm blasting!

257
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,808
The inscriptions.

258
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:58,416
Give armor-boy a taste
of hung-chao mojo, quick!

259
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,023
No!

260
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,463
Xu-lin! Come on!

261
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,598
Ohh.

262
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,301
Both: Uh-oh.

263
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,804
(Roars)

264
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,044
No!

265
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,746
<i>Fung dah! Fung dah!</i>

266
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,920
Ruh!
- <i>Fung dah! Fung dah!</i>

267
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,625
(Monk straining)

268
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,835
Uncle Jackie,
the sun's coming up!

269
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,937
Good.

270
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,406
You don't understand.
The temple vanishes at Dawn,

271
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,208
and anyone inside
goes with it.

272
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,111
How many crazy rules
does this temple have?

273
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,982
You go! I will save
xu-lin!

274
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,096
Raah!

275
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:20,832
Come on!

276
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,066
It will not work.

277
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:25,002
The power of the temple
will not let me leave.

278
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,538
The armor...

279
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,507
It can leave
the temple.

280
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,928
Yes!

281
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,299
Jackie:
Whooaa!

282
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,270
(Coughing)
Whew.

283
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,112
Noooo!

284
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:20,124
Heh.
Easy come, easy go.

285
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,326
Oh, thank you
for freeing me.

286
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,166
At least the scroll
of hung-chao is destroyed.

287
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:31,702
No one else will learn
its dangerous secret.

288
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:34,472
You know, I'll bet
we could redraw
those inscriptions

289
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:35,706
on your hands.

290
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,542
I mean, it'd take
a few tries--

291
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:41,412
Jade, playing with magic
is too dangerous.

292
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,881
I only hope
to once again
see my parents

293
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:46,984
and have nothing
more to do with
magic ever again!

294
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:50,221
Come on.
Where's your spirit
of adventure, xu-lin?

295
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,856
Ancient wisdom:

296
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,992
Wise monkey knows
when to stifle spirit
of adventure

297
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,261
and concentrate
on schoolwork.

298
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:00,464
You just made that up.

299
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,267
No. It's old,
very old.

300
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:12,276
Hey, Jackie, where
did you live when
you were little?

301
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:15,613
After my father,
for the living,

302
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:19,884
he had to go to Australia,
American embassy.

303
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:24,188
As soon as my father move,
then I have nowhere to live,

304
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,558
so they put me
- to the martial opera school.

305
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,162
Inside, just like
the movie called <i> fame.</i>

306
00:20:31,164 --> 00:20:33,564
One thing's different is
we have to stay there.

307
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,800
We stay, live there,
eat there.

308
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:38,836
Teach you how to dance,
how to kicking, punch,

309
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:42,139
somersault, acrobatic,
all kind of things.

310
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:44,041
School is very,
very important.

311
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,876
Education is
very, very important.
