1
00:44:00,475 --> 00:44:02,687
<i>The Vatican announced today...</i>

2
00:44:02,691 --> 00:44:08,500
<i>that Pope Paul VI has canceled his
Sunday blessing... due to ill health.</i>

3
00:44:09,135 --> 00:44:12,013
<i>His physician has ordered total bedrest...</i>

4
00:44:12,298 --> 00:44:14,926
<i>and cessation of all activities.</i>

5
00:44:56,974 --> 00:44:59,911
The purpose of this meeting is to ratify...

6
00:44:59,913 --> 00:45:03,713
the motion passed by our
shareholders in New York.

7
01:18:07,223 --> 01:18:09,185
What do you think about Altobello?

8
01:18:11,529 --> 01:18:13,776
A very talented man.

9
01:18:13,778 --> 01:18:17,740
He has kept the peace between
our Sicilian and American friends.

10
01:18:18,596 --> 01:18:20,590
The saint of reason.

11
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:44,399
The Corleones left drugs, so New York
is weak, and Palermo is strong.

12
01:18:46,178 --> 01:18:49,808
Your enemies always get strong
on what you leave behind.

13
01:18:52,921 --> 01:18:57,342
Who could give the
order for that massacre...

14
01:18:59,339 --> 01:19:03,112
and still pressure the Vatican deal?

15
01:19:03,352 --> 01:19:08,482
Only Lucchesi can reach
between these two worlds.

16
01:19:37,175 --> 01:19:42,002
Is there someone in the
Church we can turn to?

17
01:19:42,004 --> 01:19:43,678
Someone we can tell our problem to?

18
01:19:46,597 --> 01:19:48,599
Cardinal Lamberto.

19
01:19:48,802 --> 01:19:53,690
A wise and good man... very influential.

20
01:19:54,547 --> 01:19:57,842
He will see you.

21
01:20:32,248 --> 01:20:35,247
Politics and crime,
they're the same thing.

22
01:21:50,856 --> 01:21:57,112
Burns the moon in the sky,
and I burn with love

23
01:21:58,248 --> 01:22:04,505
Fire that wastes away like my heart

24
01:22:05,559 --> 01:22:10,364
My soul cries in pain

25
01:22:12,317 --> 01:22:18,573
It has no peace,
what a terrible night

26
01:22:19,707 --> 01:22:25,964
Time passes, but day never comes

27
01:22:26,812 --> 01:22:33,318
There is never sun,
if she doesn't return

28
01:22:34,181 --> 01:22:40,437
Burns my earth and burns my heart

29
01:22:42,007 --> 01:22:48,263
She is thirsty for water,
and I am thirsty for love

30
01:22:48,971 --> 01:22:54,227
To whom can I sing my song

31
01:22:55,431 --> 01:23:03,731
If no one appears at the balcony.

32
01:35:14,690 --> 01:35:22,926
<i>Pope Paul VI, Supreme Pontiff
of the Roman Catholic Church,...</i>

33
01:35:23,622 --> 01:35:26,792
<i>died last night at 9:40 p.m.</i>

34
01:35:27,807 --> 01:35:31,227
<i>The Pope was 81 years old,...</i>

35
01:35:31,928 --> 01:35:35,431
<i>and had been in poor health
for the last several months.</i>

36
01:38:19,352 --> 01:38:26,901
I am honored, Don Altobello, that you've
come from Palermo to visit me.

37
01:38:29,626 --> 01:38:34,075
Hey, the little kid! He's grown.

38
01:38:35,529 --> 01:38:37,044
Do the donkey for me.

39
01:38:54,648 --> 01:38:58,735
It's been some time since
we did business together.

40
01:39:02,414 --> 01:39:06,763
You are my "ace in the hole,"
as we say in America.

41
01:39:07,879 --> 01:39:13,677
I have a stone in my shoe.
You can remove it.

42
01:39:20,950 --> 01:39:23,244
Only one stone?

43
01:45:04,721 --> 01:45:07,787
"Oh father, my father!"

44
01:45:08,138 --> 01:45:10,995
"Give me some time
to pray to the Lord."

45
01:45:10,997 --> 01:45:13,959
The Baroness of Carini had
betrayed her husband...

46
01:45:14,423 --> 01:45:18,619
and fallen in love with her cousin.

47
01:45:18,621 --> 01:45:20,010
"There will be no forgiveness!"

48
01:45:20,012 --> 01:45:24,943
Her father stabbed her
through the heart.

49
01:46:50,181 --> 01:46:54,497
Father, where are you going?
Would you like a ride?

50
01:47:04,072 --> 01:47:08,326
I know you.
You're Mosca of Montelepre.

51
01:47:09,129 --> 01:47:12,978
You were an assassin then,
and you're an assassin now.

52
01:47:12,980 --> 01:47:16,233
I know Michael Corleone
is at your house.

53
01:47:17,139 --> 01:47:18,974
I will pass through the gates with you.

54
01:52:36,334 --> 01:52:39,292
What is it? What's wrong?

55
01:52:39,294 --> 01:52:42,154
They found Don Tommasino shot.

56
01:52:43,618 --> 01:52:45,828
Is he dead?

57
01:52:47,509 --> 01:52:50,971
My master is dead.
Blood calls for blood.

58
01:52:51,489 --> 01:52:54,810
I must have revenge!

59
01:52:57,838 --> 01:53:03,052
Some day, you may have
to do a difficult service for me.

60
01:53:03,894 --> 01:53:10,409
Command me.
I will avenge him!

61
01:53:25,773 --> 01:53:27,275
Totals...

62
01:53:29,191 --> 01:53:31,527
Lorscheider, 1 vote.

63
01:53:32,586 --> 01:53:35,422
Siri, 11 votes.

64
01:53:36,204 --> 01:53:39,600
Lamberto, 99 votes.

65
01:53:44,976 --> 01:53:50,698
Do you accept your
election as supreme pontiff?

66
01:53:50,700 --> 01:53:56,159
Oh, God, shed light on the decision
they have taken on my behalf.

67
01:53:57,480 --> 01:53:58,997
I accept.

68
01:53:59,364 --> 01:54:02,059
By what name do you wish to be called?

69
01:54:02,061 --> 01:54:04,980
John Paul the First.

70
01:54:34,709 --> 01:54:39,547
I will do things "right away,"
rather than in "a little while"...

71
02:09:48,433 --> 02:09:51,060
Mr. Lucchesi's house?

72
02:09:52,817 --> 02:09:57,030
I bring a message
from Michael Corleone.

73
02:09:58,435 --> 02:09:59,769
Let him in.

74
02:16:52,627 --> 02:16:55,922
Tea, Your Holiness?
It will help you sleep.

75
02:17:18,331 --> 02:17:21,334
This is from Vincent Corleone.

76
02:19:10,328 --> 02:19:11,829
Your Holiness?

77
02:19:18,247 --> 02:19:19,373
Eminence.

78
02:19:35,854 --> 02:19:38,266
The Holy Father is dead!

79
02:22:22,845 --> 02:22:25,064
Speak... tell me.

80
02:22:25,066 --> 02:22:32,252
You have lost the faith of the people.

81
02:22:34,461 --> 02:22:37,632
He who builds on the
people builds on mud.

82
02:22:38,812 --> 02:22:42,670
And Michael Corleone's message?

83
02:22:59,988 --> 02:23:06,370
It's very important.
I must whisper it in your ear.

84
02:23:10,079 --> 02:23:11,427
He's clean.

85
02:23:30,128 --> 02:23:32,798
Power wears out those who don't have it.
