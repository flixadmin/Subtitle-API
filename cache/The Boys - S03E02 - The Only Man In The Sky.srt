00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:04,922
This Thursday on vtv:
Television for women...

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:08,550
I guess I'm just searching
for a more purposeful life, Mr. Adana.

3
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:13,472
The church of the collective
can offer you so much more.

4
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:18,268
We can offer you a family.

5
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,023
Mr. Adana, tell me the truth.

6
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,525
Are you having me followed?

7
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:29,446
I had to find out
if you were putting the church first,

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,323
before your career.

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,534
Before everything.

10
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,994
You branded me with your initials!
It's enough.

11
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:42,459
I am afraid that you have become
a toxic personality, deep.

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,171
Then you've left me no choice but to run.

13
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,722
Not without my dolphin.

14
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:59,059
Brought to you by lean lady
frozen dinners, by vought.

15
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:03,438
Tonight, simulcast live
across vbs, vtv, vnn,

16
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,566
vought soul and voughtemundo,

17
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,402
join me for my annual
birthday spectacular,

18
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,821
along with my cocaptain starlight,

19
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,949
as well as emeril lagasse,
rascal flatts, supersonic,

20
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,702
the cast of Riverdale, dame judi dench

21
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,079
and, of course,
my dear friend black noir...

22
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,836
Hey, William.

23
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,921
Goddamn the pusher man, am I right?

24
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,387
You really gonna shoot
that shit in your veins?

25
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,176
You know, I think I just might.

26
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,304
Odds are you'll die screaming.

27
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,974
Well, I've gambled more for less.

28
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,018
I don't think
you're gonna do it.

29
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,603
Turn yourself into a supe?

30
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,855
That's a new low, even for you.

31
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,189
Oh, I can go lower.

32
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,733
I can go straight to hell.

33
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,237
Butcher, you have to stop.

34
00:01:55,699 --> 00:02:00,037
Please. For Becca.
This would break her heart.

35
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,456
Becca don't care what I do.

36
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,210
She's dead.

37
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,649
Hello, love. A bit early, isn't it?

38
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,902
You said I could call you after 8:00.
It's 8:03.

39
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,780
Ah, yeah. Right you are.

40
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,367
Are you okay?

41
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,203
Yeah. Hunky-dory. Why?

42
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,746
You look tired.

43
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,540
Ah, just, uh,
had a naff night, that's all.

44
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,209
No sleep.

45
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,877
Did you watch the video I made?

46
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,128
Uh, no, no.

47
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,756
I, uh... I ain't had a chance yet.

48
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,424
I think you should watch it.

49
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,719
It kind of helps me
when I don't sleep so good.

50
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,805
Yeah, look, I told you,
I'll watch it later.

51
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,057
Are you mad at me?

52
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,771
No, uh... of course not.

53
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,233
Look, you're your mother's son.

54
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,362
And I'll always watch out for you.

55
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,450
Just how I promised.

56
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,870
All right?

57
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,008
Hey there, sleepyhead.

58
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,052
Rise and shine. Big day.

59
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,849
Anything a little extra special
about today? Hmm?

60
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,356
It's my birthday, silly.

61
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,032
Okay, just blink if you want to
wish me a happy birthday, hmm?

62
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,589
Okay.

63
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,812
Okay,
so red river is a group home

64
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,815
owned by a vought subsidiary, of course.

65
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,692
I guess that's where Vicky grew up.

66
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:36,985
You mean Nadia?

67
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,739
God, I'm a fucking idiot.
I should have seen it.

68
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,866
- How could you have seen this?
- I don't know.

69
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,952
Maybe when she killed rayner
or when she blew up congress.

70
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,371
Goddamn it.

71
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,417
Maybe we leak it to the times.

72
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,861
No, she could head-pop everybody
in the office, me included.

73
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,130
Wait, wait, you're going in?

74
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,984
- Call in sick.
- We... we have an all-hands at 3:00.

75
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,344
I've never missed one before.

76
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,889
What if we tell butcher?

77
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,558
We tell butcher I've been
a supe's sidekick for a year?

78
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,229
Oh, Christ, he's never gonna
not torture me for this, is he?

79
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,772
Well, maybe he won't.

80
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:18,735
No. No, no, no.
Look, we can... handle this ourselves.

81
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:19,945
All right?

82
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,614
Just don't do anything.

83
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,158
- What, crazy, stupid?
- No.

84
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,619
Don't do anything until I get back.

85
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,120
- Okay?
- You're leaving?

86
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,748
Yeah, it's the sound check

87
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,751
for homelander's stupid birthday special.

88
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,255
Wait for me.

89
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,050
Yeah. Okay. Sure.

90
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:50,100
J" baby, baby, baby
got your license to drive j”

91
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,703
-j' you got your license j"
-j' got your license to drive me... j"

92
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,020
And pop, pop.

93
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,438
Head slide.

94
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,358
- I'll slide tonight. Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

95
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,318
Whew! Still got it.

96
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,654
Looks like you're back on
the "sweet as I wanna be" tour.

97
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,490
Oh, wow. No, this is humiliating.

98
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:07,325
That song was gross when I was 18.

99
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,495
I sing it now, they're gonna make me
keep a thousand feet from schools.

100
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,830
Then don't sing it.

101
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,207
That's easy for you to say.
You're already in the seven.

102
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,251
I-I don't want to make waves.

103
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,713
Trust me... make waves.

104
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:24,718
Hey, Jay, um, could we run
my segment now, actually?

105
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,137
- 'Cause I only have a few lines.
- Of course. Yeah.

106
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,638
Where's the fire, starlight?

107
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,516
What, are you on a break?

108
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,852
Sir, happy birthday. I'm...

109
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,454
- Supersonic, right?
- Yeah, that's right.

110
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,706
- Great to meet you.
- You, too.

111
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,858
Yeah. You're a real, uh,
contender on American hero.

112
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,027
Keep it up. We could be teammates.

113
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,570
Oh, wow, I hope so, sir.

114
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,533
Of course, it doesn't hurt
that the show's judge

115
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,741
used to get come-drunk
on your chorizo picante.

116
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,996
Homelander, sir,
we're loading the prompter

117
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,581
- with starlight's revisions.
- Sure.

118
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,082
- Revisions?
- Yeah.

119
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,834
I had Bruce make a couple of tweaks,

120
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,461
- gave you some more juicy stuff.
- No.

121
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,184
After all, you are cocaptain.

122
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,923
Need you front and center.

123
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,008
- Roger, cue these up.
- Yes, sir.

124
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,301
Thank you.

125
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:12,891
You know, I got to admit,
I was a little unsure about this.

126
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:17,562
But now, honestly, I am just so excited
about what's coming.

127
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,982
- Partner.
- Ready for rehearsal.

128
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,574
All right, mate?

129
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,078
Bloody hell, Janine. You shot up.

130
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,163
You remember your uncle Billy, don't you?

131
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,249
Here. I got this for you.

132
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,210
You and your dad can build it together.

133
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,546
523 pieces of family fun.

134
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,635
Okay, one, you don't
just pop up here. You call first.

135
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,553
And, two, eff soldier boy.

136
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,224
I don't give a mother effin' doo-doo
how he checked out.

137
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,642
Ah, bollocks.

138
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,686
He didn't die like no hero.

139
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,272
I'll wager he went out on his knees,
begging like a right cunt.

140
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,149
What the f...

141
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,276
Sorry, love.

142
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:11,241
Look, if there's a weapon
out there that killed soldier boy,

143
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,701
then it can kill homelander.

144
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,995
And that's got to be worth something.

145
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:18,999
Now, we're working our way
through his old team.

146
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,002
Frenchie and kimiko are starting
with the crimson countess,

147
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,962
and I'm gonna hit up gunpowder.

148
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:26,965
Sounds like you got everything covered.

149
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,134
This ain't just anyone.

150
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,386
It's soldier boy.

151
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,348
You could close the book on him
once and for all.

152
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,809
For your dad. Your family.

153
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,394
Fuck off with that shit.

154
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:49,529
My father died hunched over a desk,
obsessing over a dead man,

155
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,615
while he was ignoring
his two living children.

156
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,744
And I almost did the same thing to her.

157
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,290
Thanks for coming by.

158
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,098
You're doing a bang-up job with her, mate.

159
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,814
Butcher, hold on a second.

Since when?

178
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,891
Okay, first, work, then pleasure.

in the birthplace of American Liberty.

191
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,484
Born poor on the mean streets
of south Philadelphia,

192
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:18,363
he learned the values of hard work,
tenacity and bravery.

193
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:22,825
He used those values to prove
america's exceptionalism to the world.

194
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,828
Okay, boys, let's give

Congress, I have a list right here
of avowed communists.

197
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:39,384
He helped guide america
into a brighter future,

198
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,637
and along the way,
he found the love of a good woman,

199
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,932
which made his sacrifice
all the more noble,

200
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:50,019
when he gave his life saving us
from a nuclear holocaust.

You seem a little old
for the countess tea package.

00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,628
We're young at heart.

Oh, sweetie.

218
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,345
Can't you talk?

219
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,389
Would you like to hear something new?

220
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,516

you know that chimps
are physically incapable of crying?

225
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,750
But that doesn't mean
they're not crying on the inside.

Don't let her hands touch!

Ow! Let go of me, you bitch.

234
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,775
No fireball if your hands
don't touch, oui?

235
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,777
You stay quiet and relax.

236
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,571
- She will hurt you.
- What do you want?

237
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,032
We want to know about soldier boy.

238
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,243
What the fuck do you care
about soldier boy?

239
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,703
We want the truth about soldier boy,

not the merde you've been giving us
in your appalling show.

How did he die? Who killed him? Talk.

242
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,044
The show is the truth, motherfucker.

243
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,252
- Three minutes with the countess.
- He died a hero.

Fuck!

God...

Hughie, my man.

00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,716
You okay?

261
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:53,513
A-Alex? Uh... uh, where's Annie?

262
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:54,865
She's actually onstage with homelander.

263
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,807
It's a crazy fucking day, man.

264
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,435
Yeah, yeah. Uh, so glad
that you're... you're there with her.

265
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,729
Um, hey, why'd you, uh...
Why'd you pick up the phone?

266
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,832
Well, you called three times
in the last three minutes.

267
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,709
- Is anything wrong?
- No, no, everything's good.

268
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,252
Everything's fine.
Just tell her that I called, okay?

269
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,986
Uh...

270
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:18,120
It is such an honor
to be with you all tonight,

271
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:22,625
celebrating my... my dear friend
and mentor homelander.

272
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:27,421
Now, before we bring out dame judi dench,
I would like to take a moment...

273
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,341
Uh, hey, Jay. What's that?

274
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,593
I'm supposed to be announcing
the starlight house.

275
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,303
You sing me "happy birthday."

276
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,889
Fun, right?

277
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,642
Go on. Go for it.

278
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,646
J happy birthday to you j

00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,043
Hold on, hold on,

281
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,902
Um, starlight.

282
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,030
Listen, starlight, i-i...

283
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:56,284
Hate to direct you, but, um,
we're gonna need a little more

284
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,245
"jfk just got rimmed out by Marilyn"
version.

285
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,332
It's got to fit with the routine.
A-Actually, show her the routine.

286
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,502
You're gonna fucking love this.

287
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:15,094
- That's your backup.
- Okay...

288
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,929
Okay, uh, hold on, everybody.

289
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,348
Okay, ladies, thank you.
Just stand down, okay?

290
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,558
Real quick.

291
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,352
Can I talk to Roger?

292
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,476
- Uh, yeah, sure, abso...
- Problem?

293
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,152
I have... concerns.

294
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,403
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

295
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,739
Oh, okay, well, uh, what are they?

296
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,824
- It's demeaning.
- It's demeaning

297
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,035
to sing your friend "happy birthday"?

298
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,330
Are you gonna sing all sexy for me
on my birthday?

299
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,790
Starlight, where... wh-what's
with all this animosity?

300
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:48,085
Hey, um, can we just have
one minute, please?

301
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,963
- Yes. Go.
- Thank you.

302
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,592
Hey, um... okay.

303
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,303
- For the record...
- Mm-hmm.

304
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,680
I know you don't care
whether I sing or not.

305
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,974
This is a juvenile attempt

306
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:05,895
to get me to look like a sex doll
instead of a cocaptain.

307
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,065
I'm not doing it.

308
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,441
I have an idea.

309
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,234
Why don't you lighten the fuck up?

310
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,528
Come on, you're gonna sing
the shit out of this song.

311
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,696
Ready? Let's hit it.

312
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,325
If starlight doesn't want to sing,
she doesn't sing.

313
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,203
Stan. What a surprise.

314
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:26,957
Our testing shows
that 76% of likely viewers

315
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,418
will make every effort to watch tonight
for starlight.

316
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:33,339
As for you, 53% might dvr.

317
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:37,510
I think that that means that she can
call her own shots. Don't you?

318
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,137
So how about I just walk, Stan?
How would that rate?

319
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,224
After the PR hole you dug
for yourself this past year,

320
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,851
I'd say you're lucky
we're putting on this farce at all.

321
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:49,313
But hey, it's your party.
You can cry if you want to.

322
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,126
- Damn, Annie.
- Hmm.

323
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,086
What happened to you in New York?

324
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,838
I started making waves.

325
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,646
Thank you so much for coming in.

326
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,468
Have you met my new development exec?

327
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,971
Hi. I'm also Ashley.

328
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:23,848
Uh-huh.

329
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,434
We are super curious to hear
what you have for us today.

330
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,853
- Mm-hmm. So curious.
- I've been thinking a lot

331
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,772
about all the ways
that I can contribute around here.

332
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,649
Maybe I can't run as fast as I used to,

333
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,235
but I've neverjust been
the world's fastest man.

334
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,530
There's a lot of layers to the a-train
that people haven't seen yet.

335
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,781
Such as?

336
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,410
Well, I'm also a-a strong,
very proud black man.

337
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,412
Right, Seth?

338
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,332
Seth, come on, man.

339
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,293
Tell them.

340
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,920
Right. Um...

341
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,923
The seven have been dipping
in the African American demo.

342
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,342
Our numbers for dawn of the seven
have been soft.

343
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,137
People of color don't tend
to react well to Nazis.

344
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,513
Facts.

345
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,641
We thought a rebranding of a-train
maybe could change that.

346
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,728
If done tastefully.

347
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,147
- A rebranding.
- So, listen,

348
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,109
we start with a docuseries on vought soul.

349
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,404
A-train to Africa.

350
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:21,989
Boom.

351
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,200
The art's, uh, just a mock-up.

352
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,993
It'll trace his family's journey

353
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,871
from the plains of Africa
all the way to vought tower.

354
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,791
Yeah, like, I want to get back
in touch with my roots.

355
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,210
Like in roots.

356
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,796
And for the gen 23,

357
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:40,007
a state-of-the-art interactive
learning experience.

358
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,268
Is that a video game
about the slave trade?

359
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,229
It's some powerful stuff.

360
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,940
It's really something.

361
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,025
I even had lj redesign the suit.

362
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,611
You know, for the culture.

363
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,464
- I want to introduce it tonight.
- Oh, yeah, no.

364
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:06,283
Let's have a beat on that
and think about that.

365
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,202
- Okay. Wow.
- Okay.

366
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,372
Thank you so much for that pitch.

367
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:14,333
That was so well told.

368
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,668
Mm-hmm. So well told.

369
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,628
All right. Yeah.

370
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,341
We're gonna discuss with the team
and-and get back to you.

371
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,260
Cool. Yeah. Thanks.

372
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,262
See you tonight.

373
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,934
I'm kind of surprised
that they didn't buy it in the room.

374
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,143
She hated it.

375
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:34,979
What? No.

376
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,397
Man, she said it was "well told."

377
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,440
Yeah, that's code
for she fucking hated it.

378
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:41,151
Look, man, she didn't buy it
because it's total bullshit.

379
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,879
You couldn't care less
about your African roots.

380
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,739
You know it, and she knows it,
and frankly, Africa knows it.

381
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,366
Yeah?

382
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,952
You don't have a fucking dick.

383
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,838
So, uh, where at vought do you work?

384
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,884
Um, uh, the tower,
social media, up on 47th.

385
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:08,095
Um, I'm sorry, you said you don't get
many potential parents?

386
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,306
Well, you know what kind
of a home we are, right?

387
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,850
Yeah, no, of course, it's a group home...

388
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,604
For the s-super-abled.

389
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,107
Mason, please get down from there.

390
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,942
Yeah, uh, so many tragic stories,

391
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,153
but, uh, with the right attention,

392
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,113
uh, they can bounce back so quickly.

393
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,325
Yeah, they're little treasures.

394
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,411
Geez.

395
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,873
Teddy stillwell, we don't teleport.

396
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,751
- Can I play with my toys?
- Yeah.

397
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,421
So, their... their parents, they're, uh...

398
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,883
Well, uh, some of the kids,
they discovered their gifts quite early,

399
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,718
before they were able to control them.

400
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,929
But listen, i-I'm sure
you'd be perfectly safe.

401
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,809
Hey, can you... can you, uh...
Can you show me the rest of the place?

402
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,312
- Uh, what did you want to see?
- Anything. Whatever you got.

403
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,772
Oh.

404
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,398
Sorry, what, uh... what is it, Teddy?

405
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,863
Hey, wait a minute. I know you.

406
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,782
You're starlight's boyfriend?

407
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,493
- Uh...
- And you work at the bureau.

408
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:14,596
- Uh... no, no, I can...
- This is highly irregular.

409
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,121
Hey, hey, I-I-I can explain.

410
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,707
Um, okay, the-the truth is...

411
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,835
Starlight is-is the one
that sent me here.

412
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,214
I'm completely sterile.
Doctor says my sperm are bad.

413
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,757
Like, really, really bad,

414
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,259
like a bunch of fat, dead tadpoles.

415
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:33,806
But we-we want a kid, and, um,
she wanted to keep it quiet,

416
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,684
so she sent me here to cover for her.
H was never here, by the way.

417
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:40,187
We just want to keep it
about love and not publicity.

418
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,355
You know?

419
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,485
This is fantastic.
With a superhuman mother,

420
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,071
there is far less chance
of parental fatality.

421
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,740
Oh, yeah. That's great.
That's great news.

422
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,785
So I have a few standouts
I think you'll be pretty thrilled with.

423
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,871
You mind if I, uh,
just kind of flip around a bit?

424
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,085
Thank you. Thank you.
Sorry. Move this over.

425
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,253
Sorry.

426
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,936
Is there anything in particular
that you're looking for?

427
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,465
Um, boy, girl?

428
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,759
No, you know, we don't really
see gender that way.

429
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:14,096
- Well, Samir is south Asian.
- Mm-hmm.

430
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,724
That is very hot right now.

431
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,517
No, that sounds great.

432
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,080
- Wh... uh, Samir... right here? Okay.
- South Asian.

433
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:39,597
Nadia, do you know
why you're here today?

434
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:40,956
Did I do something wrong?

435
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,917
Not at all. You've made so much progress.

436
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,335
That's why you're here.

437
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,047
You're getting what you've always wanted.

438
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,009
You're-you're adopting me?

439
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,220
No, I can't adopt you, sport,
not technically.

440
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,931
It's more complicated
than you need to worry about.

441
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,685
But you are a very rare
and exceptional girl,

442
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,187
and you're coming with me.

443
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,897
I'm gonna take care of you now.

444
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,356
Is that all right?

445
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,903
"It has been a terrible, horrible,
no good, very bad day.

446
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,907
My mom says some days are like that.

447
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,618
Even in Australia."

448
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,661
You want me to read it again?

449
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:23,290
- Actually too old for that.
- Oh, you smart-ass.

450
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,918
Scoot. Let me talk to your mom.

451
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,840
Bad days do happen.

452
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,968
Maybe I need to read this to you.

453
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:37,888
You have. About a million times
before bed.

454
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,770
- Anything in the news?
- Still nothing.

455
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:47,981
Good.

456
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:58,867
Tony was a friend of yours.

457
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,494
I understand why you'd be upset.

458
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,538
Somebody at vought dropped the ball.

459
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,624
I can't have people showing up
at my work calling me Nadia.

460
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:10,420
A cleaning crew sterilized the site
within 15 minutes of the incident.

461
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,339
No witnesses have come fonnard.

462
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,800
And if they do, we'll deal with them.

463
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,344
The same way you dealt with Tony.

464
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:22,141
Come on, sport.
Haven't I always taken care of you?

465
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,611
Welcome. Next.

466
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:35,946
Ah, ah.

467
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,240
Oh. Sorry, mate.

468
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,368
Here you go.

469
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,412
Nice piece. Welcome.

470
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,247
Next.

471
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,207
Come through.

472
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:52,421
J this country rocks, this country rolls j

473
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:56,508
j no matter if you're young
or if you're old j

474
00:27:56,592 --> 00:28:00,596
j you can stand up for the red
white and blue j

475
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,391
j and cheer for the freedoms
that it gave to you... j

476
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,910
And I I! Tell you something,

477
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,896
if "Dakota" Bob singer
gets elected president,

478
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:11,398
well, you say hello
to left-wing socialism.

479
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,941
'Cause I'll tell you this right now,

480
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:17,154
he is gonna follow the George soros
globalist playbook to a t.

481
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:21,325
Step one, oppress the citizens
and confiscate their firearms.

482
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:26,413
Step two, have it all gleefully reported
by the so-called news media.

483
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,849
- Fake news!
- And step three,

484
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:29,750
in every classroom around the country,

485
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,519
they're gonna teach your kids
to hate america,

486
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,146
the constitution
and the second amendment.

487
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,298
Good for us, the silent majority,

488
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,634
and the vought rifle association,

489
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,237
let me tell you something, we are armed
and we're ready to fight back.

490
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,941
Thank you for coming,
ladies and gentlemen.

491
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,742
Don't forget, two-for-one
on hollow-points on the way out.

492
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,017
Use the promo code "gunpowder."

493
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,685
God bless y'all.

494
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,321
Excuse me, Mr. Powder.
I'm your number one fan.

495
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,406
I've bought all your rifles.
Every one of them.

496
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,659
That vought vr-15. Ooh.

497
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,619
That is a hell of a gun.

498
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,121
Smooth trigger pull.

499
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,414
Smooth.

500
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:14,962
I'd shake your hand,
but, uh, well, you know.

501
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,005
Well, I appreciate that.

502
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,106
Yeah, I followed you
since your payback days.

503
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,818
I mean, 14 years old,

504
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,778
picked to be soldier boy's sidekick.

505
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,571
He was a great man.

506
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:45,033
Well, it's nice meeting you, buddy.

507
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:47,035
You must've been chuffed, eh?

508
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,704
Helping him on his missions,

509
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,247
letting him watch you on the bog,

510
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,165
stick his finger up your burn a bit,

511
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,126
give him a sloppy little nosh.

512
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,461
All in a day's work
for a young ward, innit?

513
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:59,548
Like I haven't heard that sidekick
pedo shit a thousand times before.

514
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,050
Why don't you do me a big favor,
buddy, and fuck off.

515
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,553
You're right. I'm sorry.

516
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,055
That's a filthy, unsubstantiated rumor.

517
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,640
Goddamn right it is.

518
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,059
Till now.

519
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,395
This is a complaint you filed to vought,

520
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,397
begging to be taken off payback

521
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,568
on account of, and I quote,
"soldier boy's habitual abuse."

522
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:23,322
Of course they buried it,
vought being the cunts they are.

523
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:24,906
That right there is a fake.

524
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,908
- Course it is.
- I'm sorry, who are you?

525
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,828
I told you. Biggest fan.

526
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,205
And I want to help you.

527
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,291
Keep shtum.

528
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:38,587
Be a crying shame
if your red-meat faithful out there

529
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,298
found out you were soldier boy's
underage nob-gobbler.

530
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,177
Now, all I want to know

531
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,723
is what happened to him,
and you're gonna tell me.

532
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,683
Or maybe I put a bullet in your head.

533
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,022
You do that,

534
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,316
and it'll be all over the intenneb
within an hour.

535
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,109
See, buddy, I don't give a shit.

536
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:02,986
'Cause that never happened.

537
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,615
Soldier boy never touched me like that.

538
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,081
{gunshofl -

539
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,669
Oh, fuck.

540
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,846
Oh, my god! Don'tjump!

541
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,351
Hi, Chelsea.

542
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,145
It's your lucky day.

543
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,772
Well, considering.

544
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,982
You're-you're my annual birthday save.

545
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:49,152
- Don't come any closer.
- Life is a precious gift.

546
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:52,030
To throw yours away would be
a real slap in the lord's face,

547
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,448
don't you think?

548
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,076
You don't want to go to hell
for all eternity, do you?

549
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,829
I'm Jewish. I...

550
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:04,501
All right, well, regardless,
just step back from the ledge, please?

551
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,462
Okay, that's good.
Just don't be afraid of the zoom.

552
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,880
You're not Roger deakins.

553
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,424
Mike, frame up. He could
be flying down any second.

554
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:13,134
Yep. You got it.

555
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,846
Oh, fuck.

556
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,683
Come on, look. I'm here now.

557
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,644
If you jump, I'm just gonna
fly down and save you anyway.

558
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,062
It's all futile and...

559
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,450
Sh-she wouldn't...

560
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:40,745
It's my... it's my birthday.

561
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:42,038
She...

562
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,461
She...

563
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:07,147
You probably don't know this
because, you know, Jew,

564
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,568
but Jesus wasn't born
on the 25th of December.

565
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,613
That was piggybacked
off a pagan festival, and guess what.

566
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,531
Today is not my birthday, either.

567
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:19,075
Nope.

568
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,245
Don't know when it is,
but sure as hell ain't today.

569
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:26,916
This was just chosen for me
by a marketing department.

570
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,046
I mean, I can't even
have a birthday at all.

571
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,339
I wasn't born.

572
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,717
I was just poured
out of a fucking test tube.

573
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,220
Immaculate conception.

574
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,683
I know exactly how he must have felt.

575
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:44,893
Jesus.

576
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,104
You give and you give...

577
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:51,733
You give
your whole fucking life,

578
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:56,154
and what happens?
People just tear you down.

579
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:59,532
Why do people destroy their gods?

580
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,035
H-How is it fair that you get saved,

581
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:05,538
while a beautiful, perfect god
gets killed?

582
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,715
You know what, Chelsea?

583
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:19,969
I think you should jump.

584
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,722
I-I don't think I want to.

585
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:23,932
You don't want to?

586
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,101
Why don't you show a little
follow-through, Chelsea?

587
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,354
- Jump.
- Please, I... I just want to get down.

588
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,439
I'm not suggesting anymore.

589
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:33,775
Jump.

590
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,611
No. No, please.

591
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,029
Oh, god, oh, god.

592
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,322
No, no, no.

593
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:41,908
No god.

594
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:47,122
The only man in the sky is me.

595
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,583
How the fuck did she bite off
her own tongue?

596
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,335
Stormfront million dollar babied herself.

597
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:53,579
- That's horrible.
- Oh, so...

598
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,279
Daddy? It smells smoky.

599
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,617
It's okay, baby, I got it.

600
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,003
Fucking piece of shit.

601
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,504
Shut the fuck up!

602
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:48,349
I'm sorry.

603
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:51,311
Baby, I'm sorry.

604
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,495
I'm sorry.

605
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,509
- Hey.
- Hey.

606
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,472
- Hughie.
- Hi.

607
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,974
- Hey, where you been?
- Uh...

608
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,936
You know, just, um, working from home.

609
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,729
Oh, my god, your hand.

610
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:38,441
Yeah. Yeah, no, that's...
It's nothing. I'm fine.

611
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:41,194
- So, who's Nadia?
- Nadia?

612
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:44,030
Yeah, Scotty said some guy
came in yesterday, asking for Nadia.

613
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,658
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, there was, there was a guy,

614
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,036
um, and he...
He was looking at your picture,

615
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,038
he said your name was Nadia,
said he knew you

616
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,361
- from, like, way back when.
- You weren't gonna tell me?

617
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,168
Uh, no, I mean, it was just some guy
off his meds, seemed like, yeah.

618
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:02,090
I'm sorry, I-I mean,
you're missing work, your hand.

619
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,008
- Lot going on.
- Hmm.

620
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,302
Is there something I should know?

621
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,014
He was with me.

622
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,892
I'm sorry for stealing him
away from you, but...

623
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:16,104
We had some things
that we needed to discuss.

624
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,940
Very loudly, actually.

625
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,025
- We made quite the scene at panera.
- Oh.

626
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,069
I mean, it's a miracle
nobody recognized me.

627
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:26,155
Yeah, sorry, I was, I was trying
to preserve just a tiny,

628
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,159
little shred of my dignity,
but, uh, we had a fight.

629
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:33,496
We didn't leave things in the greatest
place, so I thought I would come by and...

630
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,707
- Check up on me?
- Well, I was worried about you.

631
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,060
Yeah, well, you know I can
handle some things by myself, right?

632
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,752
Okay, I'm just trying to help.

633
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,981
I don't always need your help.
You don't have to treat me like I'm a kid.

634
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,607
Here I was thinking
that I was treating you like my boyfriend.

635
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,674
Well, you...

636
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,302
This is actually none of my business,
so I'm just, I'm gonna go.

637
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,012
Good-good luck with all of that.

638
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,764
- Oh, and hughie?
- Yeah.

639
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:53,057
Cut her some slack.

640
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,560
You shouldn't be afraid
of a powerful woman.

641
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:05,862
Oh... my god.

642
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,699
Uh, thanks for the save, by the way.

643
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:13,828
What are you doing here?

644
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,747
What am I doing here?

645
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,625
Well, uh, Alex said
that you were acting weird,

646
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:21,127
and I've been calling you
literally every five minutes.

647
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,754
- So...
- Right.

648
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,964
Shit. Sorry, I left
my phone off at red river.

649
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,425
I thought we were gonna
handle that together.

650
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,635
I know.

651
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:31,429
I'm sorry.

652
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,432
And you're bleeding.

653
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,225
I know,
because I can't open a fucking jar,

654
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:37,989
because I can't do anything fucking right.

655
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,520
Hughie.

656
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,731
What's going on?

657
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,942
Vicky was my friend.

658
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,361
I know her daughter.

659
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,822
She-she-she surprised me
in the office on my birthday.

660
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,660
We used to roll through that office
like we were the fucking untouchables.

661
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:57,163
I thought things were finally,
finally going my way.

662
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,376
God, what a goddamn joke I am.

663
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,045
Hey, that's not true, hughie.

664
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,888
Oh, um...

665
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,058
I may have signed us up to adopt a child.

666
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,322
Hey, look at that.

667
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:34,200
- There you go.
- Seven tower.

668
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,535
- Amazing.
- Bye, dad.

669
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,804
I love you, baby.

670
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,121
- I love you, too.
- Mmm.

671
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:39,831
All right.

672
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,624
Is Monique here?

673
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,418
Uh, Monique, Marvin's here.

674
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,522
Hey, you gonna stay
for homelander's birthday special?

675
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:47,964
I got some brats on the grill.

676
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,592
Think I'll pass, but thanks.

677
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,679
Oh.

678
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,980
You know
I've been trying, Monique.

679
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,359
Been trying to stay away from all of it.

680
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:09,652
The supes.

681
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,738
Butcher.

682
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,740
For Janine.

683
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,952
- And for you.
- I know.

684
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,245
But this...

685
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,331
This soldier boy thing came up,

686
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,793
and you know the baggage there, I...

687
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,715
I tried upping my meds, just...

688
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,052
You're having bad thoughts again.

689
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:37,055
And the tics and the compulsions.

690
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,515
Monique, I lost my shit
in front of Janine.

691
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,935
It's like, soldier boy, he's like this...

692
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,689
This steel sliver
inside of my brain, after he...

693
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,485
I don't know what to do.

694
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,577
You need to go back to butcher.

695
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,122
That's what.

696
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,959
I never wanted to try to turn you
into something you're not.

697
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,879
I-I hate that you're making yourself
sick over it.

698
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:17,011
Maybe I can't be with you anymore, Marvin,

699
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:19,097
and I am so sorry for that.

700
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:24,519
But you should go do what you have to do.

701
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:28,397
Face this shit down.

702
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,320
Please don't tell Janine about this.

703
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,782
About any of it. My pops, none of it.

704
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,993
I just want to leave her out of it.

705
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:44,872
Janine will be right here, waiting.

706
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,210
Just... stay safe for her.

707
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,966
Stormfront was right!

708
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:58,803
Stormfront was right!
Stormfront was right!

709
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,365
The stormchasers
marched in Portland today,

710
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,075
mourning their fallen idol stormfront...

711
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,393
When violence broke out between...

712
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,353
Mon coeur. Look.

713
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:10,648
Look at this.

714
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,944
Six flags in queensbury. We go tomorrow,

715
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:18,197
we ride the greezed lightnin'
and, uh, steamin' demon

716
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:21,284
until we vomit
the doughnut hamburgers, huh?

717
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:32,378
I know.

718
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,853
Little girl.

719
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,359
Mon coeur, no.

720
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:01,532
That wasn't your fault.

721
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,838
Hi, buddy.
I'm sorry I'm running late.

722
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,968
I thought I 'd have time
to sneak in a haircut.

723
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,512
It always takes longer
than I think it will.

724
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:10,184
There's some double stufs in the pantry,
but only two, mister.

725
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:12,937
More than two, and I will know.

726
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:15,940
Okay. I'm hanging up now.

727
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,526
Just wanted to tell you
that I love you and I'll see you soon.

728
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:22,029
So, I love you, and I'll see you soon.

729
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,010
Butcher?

730
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,013
You all right, mate?

731
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:48,347
Hey, um...

732
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:50,683
Frenchie told me about crimson countess.

733
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,101
What the hell happened?

734
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,894
We was chasing down something, but...

735
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:56,856
I'm gonna knock it on the head.

736
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:00,067
Y-You was right the other day.

737
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:03,237
Things are good.

738
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,365
Ryan's good.

739
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:11,370
I should leave it well enough alone,
before I go and fuck it all up.

740
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:16,417
You there?

741
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,297
Neuman's a supe.

742
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,174
She's the head popper.

743
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:27,511
Yeah, what?

744
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:29,239
Yeah, she's pretty much
Stan Edgar's daughter, too.

745
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,724
Past year of my life has been a waste.

746
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:34,852
I thought we could fight vought the
right way, but we can't. It's all rigged.

747
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,271
If we 're gonna take them down,

748
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,523
we have to do whatever it takes.

749
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,567
We have to do it your way.

750
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:46,364
Butcher, you there?

751
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:26,070
You got to be fucking kidding me.

752
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,280
Get your ass off of my car.

753
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,534
Why you protecting soldier boy?

754
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,412
If he'd have slipped me a length,
I wouldn't hesitate.

755
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:36,288
I'd throw him to the fucking dogs.

756
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,511
Oh, shit.

757
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:47,318
Okay, okay.

758
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,446
Please.

759
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,258
Soldier boy used to slap me
around a little bit, all right?

760
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:55,659
It was just hazing
that went too far, all right?

761
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,870
- That's it.
- What fucking happened to him?

762
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,622
He didn't die in an accident, all right?

763
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,792
The whole nuclear meltdown thing,
it was just bullshit.

764
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:06,045
I fucking know that. What killed him?

765
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,296
I don't know.

766
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:10,841
I-I don't know! I don't fucking know!

767
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:13,135
All right? We were in Nicaragua,

768
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:16,180
in fucking '84,
but I didn't see it happen.

769
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,974
- Well, you must have seen something.
- I didn't see shit.

770
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:20,559
Fuck, I was just a kid.

771
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:23,896
Ask the others. Ask the fucking CIA.

772
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:26,148
- CIA?
- Yeah.

773
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,443
Yeah. We were working with the CIA.

774
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,154
Who was the case officer?

775
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:34,698
Grace.

776
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,034
Grace... grace Mallory.

777
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,453
All right? Fuck.

778
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,126
Look, please.

779
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,503
Please, look...

780
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,922
Look, I told you everything I know.

781
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,216
All right? Please, just-just...

782
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:54,260
I know you did.

783
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:58,430
But it don't change what you are.

784
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,520
J your road's getting wetter j

785
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:48,188

00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:09,627
-j got your license to drive j
-j license to drive j

793
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,712

794
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,172
j me crazy j

795
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:27,061
Yeah.

796
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,438
- What the fuck is he wearing?
- Yeah!

797
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,899
What the fuck is he wearing?

798
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,860
Yeah, all right. Let's hear it
for supersonic, everybody.

799
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,195
Get me fucking wardrobe.

800
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:39,615
Get me fucking wardrobe
so I can fucking choke them out!

801
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:43,577
All right, so now, I would like
to bring out our cocaptains.

802
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,496
So let's give it up for starlight

803
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:48,791
and the man of the hour himself,
homelander!

804
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:54,963
Happy birthday, homelander.

805
00:52:55,047 --> 00:52:56,256
- Hey, thank you.
- Yeah.

806
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,385
I can see your girdle,
you disgusting fat fuck.

807
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:01,095
Get off the fucking stage.

808
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:11,271
Wow, I'm so honored
to be with you guys tonight

809
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:16,694
to celebrate my dear friend
and mentor homelander.

810
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:19,905
I'm here to do more than wish you
a happy birthday, though.

811
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,116
I'm thrilled to be announcing

812
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,411
a project that is near
and dear to my heart.

813
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,872
The starlight house
is a nonprofit foundation

814
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:32,501
dedicated to helping
homeless and at-risk youth.

815
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,795
Hey, homelander! Your Nazi died!

816
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,715
Did he just say his Nazi died?

817
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:38,882
Let's go.

818
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,684
Homelander...

819
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,605
He's just, he's a human.
He's just like the rest of us.

820
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:56,066
And we all make mistakes, right?

821
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,154
But we all deserve second chances.

822
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:05,409
In that spirit, homelander has agreed

823
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:09,621
to donate $10 million...

824
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:12,458
- To the starlight house, which is...
- No.

825
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,835
I mean... come on. Give it up.
Give it up for this guy.

826
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,003
No. No.

827
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,421
No.

828
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,259
Starlight lied to you just now. She did.

829
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,969
I don't make mistakes.

830
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:26,221
I'm not "just like the rest of you."

831
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,724
I'm stronger. I'm smarter.

832
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,519
I'm better. I am better.

833
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,855
I'm not some weak-kneed fucking crybaby

834
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,775
that goes around fucking
apologizing all the time.

835
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,335
And why the fuck would you want me to be?

836
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,029
Go to fucking commercial, Roger.
Go to fucking commercial.

837
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,323
Don't you dare
stop rolling, Roger!

838
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,786
All my life, people
have tried to control me.

839
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:50,537
My whole life.

840
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,956
Rich people, powerful people

841
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,292
have tried to muzzle me, cancel me,

842
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:59,338
keep me impotent and obedient,
like I'm a fucking puppet.

843
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,131
You know what? It worked.

844
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:03,383
Because I allowed it to work.

845
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:05,886
And guess what. If they can control me,

846
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,055
then you can bet your ass
they can control you.

847
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,224
They already do.
You just don't realize it.

848
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,018
I'm done.

849
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:16,021
I am done apologizing.

850
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:18,690
I am done being persecuted
for my strength.

851
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:21,985
You people should be thanking Christ

852
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:25,239
that I am who and what I am,
because you need me.

853
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,200
You need me to save you.

854
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:30,160
You do.

855
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:36,625
I am the only one who possibly can.

856
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:40,796
You're not the real heroes.

857
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,466
I'm the real hero.

858
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,098
I'm the real hero.

859
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:57,479
