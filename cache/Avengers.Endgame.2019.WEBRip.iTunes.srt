I can tell you
where Thanos is.

209
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:59,279
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

210
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:03,951
And when he worked, he talked
about his Great Plan.

211
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,204
Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

212
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:08,789
I'd ask...

213
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:12,000
where would we go
once his plan was complete?

214
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,503
And his answer
was always the same.

215
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:19,716
"To the Garden."

216
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:23,095
That's cute.
Thanos has a retirement plan.

217
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:24,805
So, where is he?

218
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:27,224
When Thanos snapped
his fingers...

219
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,393
Earth became ground zero
for a power surge

220

it's gonna end any differently

00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:28,866
Are you talking
about a time machine?

497
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:31,785
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

498
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:32,995
This is more like a...

499
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,957
Yeah. Like a time machine.

500
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:38,917
I know, it's crazy.
It's crazy.

501
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:41,128
(STAMMERS) But I can't stop
thinking about it.

502
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:42,462
There's gotta be...

503
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:44,590
some way... (SIGHS)

504
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,466
-It's crazy.
-NATASHA: Scott.

505
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:47,926
I get emails from a raccoon...

506
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:50,095
so nothing
sounds crazy anymore.

507
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:52,931
So, who do we talk to
about this?

508
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,284
Chow time!

509
00:33:14,745 --> 00:33:15,787
Maguna.

510
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,460
Morgan H. Stark,
you want some lunch?

511
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:23,504
Define "lunch"

512
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:24,838
-or be disintegrated.
-Okay.

513
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:27,716
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

514
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:29,218
That is part of
a special anniversary gift

515
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:30,385
I'm making for Mom.

516
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:36,725
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

517
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:38,810
I can give you a handful of
crickets on a bed of lettuce.

518
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:40,687
-No.
-That's what you want.

519
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:42,981
How did you find this?

520
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:44,983
-Garage.
-Really?

521
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,152
-Were you looking for it?
-No.

522
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:49,905
-I found it, though.
-Hmm.

523
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:51,823
You like
going in the garage, huh?

524
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,909
So does Daddy. (GRUNTS)

525
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:56,828
It's fine, actually. Mom never
wears anything I buy her.

526
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,791
So, I'm gonna...

527
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:20,853
(STAMMERS) No.
We know what it sounds like.

528
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:21,978
Tony, after everything
you've seen,

529
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:23,063
is anything really impossible?

530
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:25,357
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale...

531
00:34:25,524 --> 00:34:27,192
which then triggers
the Deutsch Proposition.

532
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:28,318
Can we agree on that?

533
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:29,570
Thank you.

534
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,864
In layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.

535
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:33,447
-I did.
-No.

536
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,492
You accidentally survived.
(SIGHS)

537
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:37,744
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

538
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:40,998
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

539
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,376
A time heist?

540
00:34:44,543 --> 00:34:46,670
Yeah, a time heist. Of course.

541
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:47,963
Why didn't we think
of this before?

542
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,591
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

543
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:52,842
The stones are in the past.

544
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:54,261
We could go back,
we could get them.

545
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:56,722
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

546
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,807
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

547
00:34:58,974 --> 00:34:59,975
I don't believe we would.

548
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:03,103
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss
that giddy optimism.

549
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:05,689
However, high hopes
won't help...

550
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,816
if there's no logical,
tangible way

551
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:11,361
for me to safely execute
said time heist.

552
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:13,405
I believe
the most likely outcome

553
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:14,489
will be our collective demise.

554
00:35:14,573 --> 00:35:17,409
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

555
00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:20,245
All right? It means no talking
to our past selves...

556
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:21,872
no betting on sporting events.

557
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:23,790
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

558
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,084
Are you seriously telling me

559
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:27,961
that your plan
to save the universe...

560
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,796
is based on
Back to the Future?

561
00:35:30,923 --> 00:35:32,674
-Is it?
-No.

562
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:33,884
Good. You had me
worried there.

563
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:35,010
'Cause that would be
horseshit.

564
00:35:35,177 --> 00:35:37,471
That's not how
quantum physics works.

565
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:38,805
Tony.

566
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:42,226
We have to take a stand.

567
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:44,770
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

568
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:48,398
SCOTT: I know you got
a lot on the line.

569
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:51,443
You got a wife, a daughter.

570
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,112
But I lost someone
very important to me.

571
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:55,864
A lotta people did.

572
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:59,034
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

573
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:00,369
to bring everyone back,

574
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:01,954
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

575
00:36:02,037 --> 00:36:03,830
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

576
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:06,875
-I can't.
-(DOOR CLOSES)

577
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:08,293
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

578
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:11,380
MORGAN STARK: Mommy told me
to come and save you.

579
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:13,882
Good job. I'm saved.

580
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:16,677
I wish you were coming here
to ask me something else.

581
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,886
Anything else.

582
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,763
I'm honestly happy
to see you guys, I just...

583
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:21,223
Oh, look,
the table's set for six.

584
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:22,808
Tony. I get it.

585
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:25,269
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

586
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:27,563
But this is a second chance.

587
00:36:28,272 --> 00:36:30,691
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

588
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:32,401
Can't roll the dice on it.

589
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:36,405
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

590
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:40,868
Well, he's scared.

591
00:36:41,535 --> 00:36:42,661
STEVE: He's not wrong.

592
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:44,830
SCOTT: Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

593
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:46,206
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

594
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:49,126
No, I wanna do it right.

595
00:36:52,337 --> 00:36:54,006
We're gonna need
a really big brain.

596
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,508
Bigger than his?

597
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:58,552
Come on, I feel like
I'm the only one eating here.

598
00:36:58,635 --> 00:36:59,678
Try some of that.

599
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:00,762
Have some eggs.

600
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:02,598
I'm so confused.

601
00:37:02,681 --> 00:37:04,433
These are confusing times.
(CHUCKLES)

602
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:06,435
Right, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

603
00:37:06,602 --> 00:37:09,104
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

604
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:11,481
I know, it's crazy.

605
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:12,858
I'm wearing shirts now.

606
00:37:13,025 --> 00:37:15,861
Yeah. What? How? Why?

607
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,655
Five years ago,
we got our asses beat.

608
00:37:19,281 --> 00:37:20,908
Except it was worse for me...

609
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:22,284
'cause I lost twice.

610
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:24,244
First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...

611
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,455
and then, we all lost.

612
00:37:26,538 --> 00:37:27,789
No one blamed you, Bruce.

613
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:29,333
I did.

614
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:32,336
For years,
I've been treating the Hulk

615
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:33,545
like he's
some kind of disease...

616
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:35,088
something to get rid of.

617
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,509
But then, I start looking
at him as the cure.

618
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:41,220
Eighteen months
in the gamma lab.

619
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:43,972
I put the brains
and the brawn together...

620
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:45,390
and now, look at me.

621
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:47,768
Best of both worlds.

622
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:49,853
-Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
-Yes.

623
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,355
Can we get a photo?

624
00:37:51,772 --> 00:37:53,774
100%, little person.

625
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:55,984
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

626
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:58,445
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-SMART HULK: Thanks.

627
00:37:58,529 --> 00:38:00,113
Say "green."

628
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,533
-FANS: Green.
-Green.

629
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:03,617
Did you get that?

630
00:38:03,784 --> 00:38:05,035
That's a good one.

631
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:08,080
Did you want to grab one
with me? I'm Ant-Man.

632
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,669
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

633
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:14,920
-Nobody does.
-No, he wants you to take

634
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:16,713
-a picture with him.
-I don't want a picture.

635
00:38:16,797 --> 00:38:17,881
BOY 1: Stranger danger.

636
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,508
Yeah, look, he's even
saying no, he doesn't.

637
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:20,592
I get it.
I don't want it, either.

638
00:38:20,676 --> 00:38:21,802
But come on. The kid...

639
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:23,303
I don't want a picture
with them.

640
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,471
-He's gonna feel bad.
-Sorry.

641
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:25,889
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

642
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,516
SCOTT: I don't want to do it.
BOY 2: We can do it.

643
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,643
-SMART HULK: No, you feel bad.
-Take the goddamn phone.

644
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:30,936
SMART HULK: Okay.

645
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:32,020
GIRL: Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

646
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:33,772
SMART HULK: No, it was great,
kids. Thank you very much.

647
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:35,607
ALL: Hulk out!

648
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:36,817
STEVE: Bruce.

649
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:38,235
Dab.

650
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:40,195
-Bruce.
-Listen to your mom.

651
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:41,572
She knows better.

652
00:38:41,738 --> 00:38:43,407
About what we were saying.

653
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:44,783
Right.

what the hell
you're all talking about.

1077
01:02:10,355 --> 01:02:13,233
Regardless, we only have
enough Pym Particles

1078
01:02:13,317 --> 01:02:15,110
for one round-trip each.

1079
01:02:15,277 --> 01:02:16,486
And these stones have been

1080
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:18,488
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

1081
01:02:18,655 --> 01:02:19,948
Our history.

1082
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:23,118
So, not a lot of convenient
spots to just drop in, yeah?

1083
01:02:23,285 --> 01:02:25,078
Which means we have to
pick our targets.

1084
01:02:25,537 --> 01:02:26,788
Correct.

1085
01:02:28,165 --> 01:02:29,750

with the Aether.

I'm pretty sure he's dead.

1089
01:02:43,722 --> 01:02:45,390
Uh, where to start? Um...

1090
01:02:47,059 --> 01:02:49,603
The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

1091
01:02:50,062 --> 01:02:51,897
Someone called it
a stone before.

1092
01:02:53,065 --> 01:02:57,277
Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

1093
01:02:57,444 --> 01:02:59,071
so someone's gonna need
to amend that

1094
01:02:59,154 --> 01:03:00,322
and stop saying that.

1095
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:03,325
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.

1096
01:03:03,492 --> 01:03:05,369
My grandfather,
many years ago...

1097
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:09,039
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

1098
01:03:09,665 --> 01:03:11,917
Ooh. (CHUCKLES) Scary beings.

1099
01:03:12,084 --> 01:03:13,794
So, Jane, actually...

1100
01:03:14,378 --> 01:03:15,921
Oh, there she is.

1101
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:19,758
Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.

1102
01:03:20,926 --> 01:03:23,971
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

1103
01:03:24,137 --> 01:03:26,974
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

1104
01:03:27,391 --> 01:03:29,184
and she became
very, very sick.

1105
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:31,228
And so I had to
take her to Asgard,

1106
01:03:31,311 --> 01:03:32,479
which is where I'm from...

1107
01:03:32,646 --> 01:03:34,606
and we had to try and fix her.

1108
01:03:34,773 --> 01:03:36,400
We were dating at the time,
you see...

1109
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:39,945
and I got to introduce her
to my mother...

1111
01:03:44,741 --> 01:03:46,243
Oh, you know, Jane and I

1112
01:03:46,326 --> 01:03:48,245
aren't even
dating anymore, so...

1113

that is permanent in life

1118
01:03:55,752 --> 01:03:57,171
is impermanence. (LAUGHS)

was tough on me.

01:47:14,101 --> 01:47:16,478
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1936
01:47:18,021 --> 01:47:20,023
You wanna know
how he does that?

1937
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:25,571
You wanna know
what he does to you?

1938
01:47:26,071 --> 01:47:27,072
That's enough.

you're useless.

didn't have to climb
a mountain.

Technically he's not
a raccoon, you know?

In order to take the stone...

you must lose
that which you love.

No.

I don't think so.

1978

Why? 'Cause he knows
your daddy's name?

1979
01:50:26,585 --> 01:50:27,628
I didn't.

1980

Yeah.

1989
01:51:00,369 --> 01:51:02,496
Then I guess we both know
who it's gotta be.

1990
01:51:03,247 --> 01:51:04,414
I guess we do.

been trying to do one thing.

Get to right here.

Bringing everybody back.

all decent on me now.

want you to. How's that?

on their worst mistakes.

As long as we have
the stones...

Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?

we're all just sitting around

waiting for
the right opportunity?

2079
01:58:13,594 --> 01:58:14,720
We should at least discuss it.

02:43:50,747 --> 02:43:51,999
How can I?

You're taking
all the stupid with you.

2594
02:44:01,550 --> 02:44:03,343
Gonna miss you, buddy.

How long is this gonna take?

2598
02:44:14,646 --> 02:44:17,399
For him, as long as he needs.
For us, five seconds.

2599
02:44:22,487 --> 02:44:23,739
You ready, Cap?

2600
02:44:23,906 --> 02:44:26,325
All right, we'll meet you
back here, okay?

I don't know. He blew
right by his time stamp.

2611
02:44:53,393 --> 02:44:54,853
He should be here.

Hi, Sam.

2618
02:45:55,998 --> 02:45:59,042
So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?

2619
02:46:01,170 --> 02:46:05,007
Well, after I put
the stones back, I thought...

2620
02:46:06,133 --> 02:46:07,467
maybe...

2621
02:46:07,968 --> 02:46:12,764
I'll try some of that life
Tony was telling me to get.

Only thing bumming me out...

2628
02:46:29,865 --> 02:46:31,450
is the fact
I have to live in a world
