<i>( theme music playing )</i>

2
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,870
You did this.
You did this!

3
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,415
- We have to leave.
- Cersei:<i> Take him! Take him!</i>

4
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,212
Where is his wife?

5
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,547
Where's Sansa?

6
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,007
Find her.
Bar the gates of the city.

7
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:16,594
<i>Seize every ship</i>
<i>in the harbor.</i>

8
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,222
- Where is she?!
- No one leaves the capital!

9
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,224
<i>No one!</i>

10
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,352
<i>( bells tolling )</i>

11
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,629
- Get in.
- Where are we going?

12
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,506
Somewhere safe.

13
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,803
Up you go, my lady.

14
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,766
You'll be fine.

15
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,851
You're stronger
than you know.

16
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,701
( gasps )

17
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,289
- Lord Baelish?
- Petyr.

18
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,166
Are you hurt,
my lady?

19
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,834
Good. Good.

20
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,671
I'm sure you've
had quite a fright.
Rest easy.

21
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,673
- The worst is past.
- Dontos:<i> Lord Baelish.</i>

22
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,258
-<i> I promised I'd get</i>
<i>her to you safely.</i>
<i>- Softly, my friend.</i>

23
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,970
Voices carry
over water.

24
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,973
I should get back
before someone thinks
to look for me.

25
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,975
First you'll want
your pay.

26
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,978
- 10,000 was it?
- 10,000.

27
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,439
( snaps fingers )

28
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,026
Wait!
( groans )

29
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,028
( screams )

30
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,613
Littlefinger:
<i>Shh.</i>

31
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,740
You don't want
the queen to hear,
do you?

32
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:46,077
1,000 gold cloaks
are searching for you.

33
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,037
And if they found you,

34
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,040
how do you think they
would punish the girl
who murdered the king?

35
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,876
- I didn't murder anyone.
- I know. I know.

36
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,670
But you must admit
it looks suspicious.

37
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,547
The king who
executed your father,

38
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,841
who tormented you
for years,

39
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:03,636
and you fled the scene
of his murder.

40
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,805
Why did you kill him?

41
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,682
Because he was
a drunk and a fool

42
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:11,436
and I don't trust
drunk fools.

43
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,812
He saved me.

44
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,565
Saved you? My lady,
he followed my orders.

45
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:20,069
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.

46
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,739
<i>Money buys a man's</i>
<i>silence for a time.</i>

47
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:26,200
A bolt in the heart
buys it forever.

48
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,414
He was helping me
because I saved his life.

49
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:35,585
Yes, and he gave you
a priceless necklace

50
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,504
that once belonged
to his grandmother.

51
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,591
The last legacy
of House Hollard.

52
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,603
I had it made
a few weeks ago.

53
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,731
What did I once tell
you about the capital?

54
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,525
We're all liars here.

55
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,321
Come, my lady.

56
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,449
I know you've had
a difficult day.

57
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,618
But you're safe now.

58
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,536
I promise you that.

59
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,830
You're safe with me

60
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,500
and sailing home.

61
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,133
So am I the queen?

62
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,135
More than you were
with Renly.

63
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,013
Less than you would
have been if Joffrey
had done you the courtesy

64
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,183
of consummating
the marriage before dying.

65
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,478
In any case, this would
not be an opportune moment

66
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,230
to press the issue.

67
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,815
Clawing at his own throat,

68
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,609
looking to his mother
to make it stop--
it was horrible.

69
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,986
The world is overflowing
with horrible things.

70
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,740
But they're all a tray
of cakes next to death.

71
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,160
They brought me
your grandfather's body
when he died, you know?

72
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,954
Made me look at it.

73
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,539
What was it like?

74
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,667
They took me
to the Great Hall
and there he was.

75
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,460
The man I'd married

76
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,839
and suffered to father
my children.

77
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,174
A great doughy lump
I'd sat next to

78
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:09,804
at endless dinners
and tedious gatherings.

79
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,181
There he was...

80
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,642
lying on a table.

81
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,814
One of my husbands
preferred the company of men

82
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,440
and was stabbed
through the heart.

83
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,901
Another was happiest
torturing animals

84
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,487
and was poisoned
at our wedding feast.

85
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,698
- I must be cursed.
- Nonsense.

86
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,617
Your circumstances
have improved markedly.

87
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,080
You may not have enjoyed
watching him die,

88
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,957
but you enjoyed it more
than you would have enjoyed

89
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,042
being married to him,
I can promise you that.

90
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,211
But I would have been
the queen.

91
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,046
Our alliance
with the Lannisters

92
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,632
remains every bit
as necessary to them

93
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,260
as it is unpleasant
for us.

94
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,263
You did wonderful
work on Joffrey.

95
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,349
The next one
should be easier.

96
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,944
Tywin:
<i>Your brother is dead.</i>

97
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,449
Do you know
what that means?

98
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,954
I'm not trying
to trick you.

99
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,208
It means I'll become king.

100
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,586
Yes, you will
become king.

101
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,714
What kind of king
do you think you'll be?

102
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,508
A good king?

103
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,720
Mm, I think so as well.

104
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:36,599
You've got the right
temperament for it.

105
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,769
<i>But what makes</i>
<i>a good king? Hmm?</i>

106
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,147
What is a good king's
single most important
quality?

107
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,108
This is hardly
the place or the time.

108
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,069
Holiness?

109
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,154
Hmm.

110
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:53,115
<i>Baelor the Blessed</i>
<i>was holy.</i>

111
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,700
And pious.

112
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,328
He built this sept.

113
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,790
He also named
a six-year-old boy
high septon

114
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:05,127
because he thought the boy
could work miracles.

115
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,880
He ended up fasting
himself into an early grave

116
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,049
because food
was of this world

117
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,343
and this world
was sinful.

118
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,806
Justice.

119
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,724
Yeah.

120
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,060
A good king
must be just.

121
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,938
Orys I was just.

122
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,316
Everyone applauded
his reforms.

123
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,360
Nobles and commoners alike.

124
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,570
But he wasn't just for long.

125
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,030
He was murdered
in his sleep

126
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,909
after less than a year
by his own brother.

127
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,661
Was that truly
just of him?

128
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,997
To abandon his subjects
to an evil

129
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,666
that he was too gullible
to recognize?

130
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,294
- No.
- No.

131
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:51,132
- What about strength?
- Yes.

132
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,509
Strength.

133
00:09:53,592 --> 00:09:56,178
King Robert was strong.

134
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,389
He won the rebellion

135
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,976
and crushed
the Targaryen dynasty.

136
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,729
And he attended three
small council meetings

137
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,564
in 17 years.

138
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:11,152
<i>He spent his time</i>
<i>whoring and hunting</i>
<i>and drinking</i>

139
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,280
until the last two
killed him.

140
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:18,242
<i>So, we have a man</i>
<i>who starves himself</i>
<i>to death,</i>

141
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,370
a man who lets his own
brother murder him,

142
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:25,082
and a man who thinks
that winning and ruling
are the same thing.

143
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,671
What do they all lack?

144
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,802
- Wisdom.
- Yes!

145
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,804
Wisdom is what
makes a good king.

146
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,473
Yes.

147
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,100
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?

148
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,938
<i>A house with great wealth</i>
<i>and fertile lands</i>

149
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,940
<i>asks you</i>
<i>for your protection</i>

150
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,943
against another house
with a strong navy

151
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,738
that could one day
oppose you.

152
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:59,408
How do you know which choice
is wise and which isn't?

153
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,244
You've any experience
of treasuries and granaries

154
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,414
<i>or shipyards and soldiers?</i>

155
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,042
- No.
-<i> No. Of course not.</i>

156
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:12,129
A wise king
knows what he knows
and what he doesn't.

157
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,673
You're young.

158
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,175
<i>A wise young king listens</i>
<i>to his counselors</i>

159
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,929
and heeds their advice
until he comes of age.

160
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,639
And the wisest kings

161
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:25,601
continue to listen to them
long afterwards.

162
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,396
Your brother was not
a wise king.

163
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,023
<i>Your brother was not</i>
<i>a good king.</i>

164
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,775
<i>If he had been,</i>

165
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,611
perhaps he'd still
be alive.

166
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:40,074
Now, as the king,
you will have to marry.

167
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,617
Do you understand why?

168
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,411
Tommen:
<i>A king needs a queen.</i>

169
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,913
Tywin:
<i>Yes, but why?</i>

170
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,958
To further
the family line.

171
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,086
-<i> Do you know how</i>
<i>that happens?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

172
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:56,090
Yes, but has anyone
explained the details
to you?

173
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,383
I don't think so.

174
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,594
It's all relatively
straightforward.

175
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:03,139
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

176
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,224
You are.
You will be.

177
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,685
I'll see to that.

178
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,817
Please give the queen
a moment alone with her son.

179
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,944
- Yes, my lord.
- All of you.

180
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,321
( snaps fingers )

181
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,760
( doors echo shut )

182
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:50,102
It was Tyrion.

183
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,355
He killed him.

184
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,608
He told me he would.

185
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,821
"A day will come when you
think you are safe and happy

186
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:04,533
and your joy will turn
to ashes in your mouth."

187
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,080
That's what he said
to me.

188
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,128
You saw it.

189
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,088
You saw Joff point at him
just before he--

190
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,090
I don't know
what I saw.

191
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,179
Avenge him.

192
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,723
Avenge our son.

193
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,352
Kill Tyrion.

194
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,689
Tyrion's my brother.

195
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,650
<i>Our brother.</i>

196
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,236
There'll be a trial.
We'll get to the truth
of what happened.

197
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,238
I don't want a trial.

198
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,824
He'll squirm
his way to freedom
given the chance.

199
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,660
I want him dead.

200
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,414
( crying )
Please, Jaime.

201
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,750
You have to.

202
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,837
He was our son.

203
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,257
Our baby boy.

204
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,241
( gasps )

205
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,798
You're a hateful woman.

206
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:46,176
Why have the gods made
me love a hateful woman?

207
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,562
Jaime, not here,
please.

208
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,314
Please.

209
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,565
- ( fabric rips )
- Stop it.

210
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,901
- Stop it. Stop.
- No.

211
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,404
Stop it.
Stop.

212
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,910
Stop.

213
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,838
- Stop.
It's not right.
- ( grunts )

214
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:25,090
It's not right.
It's not right.

215
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,009
- I don't care.
- ( crying )

216
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,094
- Don't.
- I don't care.

217
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,347
- Don't. Jaime, don't.
- I don't care.

218
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,682
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

219
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,643
Gonna rain soon.

220
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,020
( urinating )

221
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,022
Where are we?

222
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,694
Near Fairmarket,
I think.

223
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,695
You think?

224
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,280
You don't have a map?

225
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,033
-<i> No, I don't have a map.</i>
<i>- Maybe we should get one.</i>

226
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,370
Just point out
the next map shop you see
and I'll buy you one.

227
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,163
How far is it
to the Eyrie?

228
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,999
- Far.
- And you're sure we're
going the right way?

229
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,586
Believe me, girl,
I want you there
as soon as I can.

230
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,339
Get my gold,
be on my way.

231
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,300
- On your way where?
- Why do you care?

232
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,893
Might book passage
across the Narrow Sea.

233
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:20,062
<i>Fight as a sellsword.</i>

234
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:24,733
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.

235
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,360
I'd like to see
Braavos one day.

236
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,405
Why Braavos?

237
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,156
I have friends there.

238
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,158
( blows )
I doubt it.

239
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:37,329
Seven blessings
to you.

240
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,332
- What do you want?
- What do I want?
This is my land.

241
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,251
If I'm standing on it,
it's my land.

242
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,838
We were just
watering the horses.
We'll be on our way.

243
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,344
Forgive my father.

244
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,304
<i>He was wounded fighting</i>
<i>in the war.</i>

245
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,516
Our cottage burned
down while he was gone
and my mother with it.

246
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,605
He's never been the same.

247
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,155
Which house did he
fight for?

248
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,495
The Tullys of Riverrun.

249
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,916
There's a storm coming.

250
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,585
<i>You'll be wanting</i>
<i>a roof tonight.</i>

251
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,670
<i>There's fresh hay</i>
<i>in the barn.</i>

252
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,798
And Sally here makes
rabbit stew just like
her mom used to do.

253
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,136
We don't have much,
but any man that bled

254
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,388
for House Tully
is welcome to it.

255
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:41,643
-<i> ( thunder rumbling )</i>
<i>- ( rain pattering )</i>

256
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,146
Man:
<i>We ask the Father</i>
<i>to judge us with mercy</i>

257
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,106
<i>accepting our</i>
<i>human frailty.</i>

258
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,067
<i>We ask the Mother</i>
<i>to bless our crops</i>

259
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,195
so we may feed ourselves
and all who come to our door.

260
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,530
<i>We ask the Warrior</i>
<i>to give us courage</i>

261
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,532
in these days of strife
and turmoil.

262
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,868
We ask the Maiden
to protect Sally's virtue

263
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,495
to keep her from
the clutches of depravity.

264
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,122
You got to do
all seven of the fuckers?

265
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,416
Father!

266
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,463
We ask the Smith
to strengthen our hands

267
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:12,508
and our backs
so we may finish
the work required of us.

268
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:16,678
We ask the Crone to guide
us on our journey from
darkness to darkness.

269
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,014
And we ask the Stranger
not to kill us

270
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:21,683
in our beds tonight
for no damn reason at all.

271
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,358
I'm so sorry.

272
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:33,779
( slurping loudly )

273
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,337
Really good.

274
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,965
- Did you fight at the Twins?
- Call that a fight?

275
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,842
Slaughtering livestock
more like.

276
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,886
The Red Wedding
they're calling it.

277
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,222
Walder Frey committed
sacrilege that day.

278
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,725
He shared bread
and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.

279
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,727
Guest right
don't mean much anymore.

280
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:09,064
It means something
to me.

281
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:11,650
The gods will have
their vengeance.

282
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,695
Frey will burn
in the seventh hell
for what he did.

283
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:18,156
Things were different
when Hoster Tully ruled
the Riverlands.

284
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,033
We had good years
and bad years,
same as anyone.

285
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,161
But we were safe.
Now with the Freys,

286
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,915
raiders come plundering,
steal our food,
steal our silver.

287
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,959
I was gonna send Sally north
to stay with my brother,

288
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:33,213
but the north's no better.
The whole country's gone sour.

289
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,173
You got any ale?

290
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,343
Afraid not.

291
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:43,557
How can a man
not keep ale in his home?

292
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,853
You look like you could
really swing that sword.

293
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:51,899
<i>A real warrior</i>
<i>with proper training.</i>

294
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,401
Those raiders wouldn't
stand a chance against you.

295
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:57,070
<i>How would it be if you stayed</i>
<i>on till the new moon?</i>

296
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,907
I could use a man to help
with the farmwork.

297
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,241
Sally does what she can,

298
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,620
but she can't lift
a bale of hay.

299
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,622
And if any thieves came
looking for easy pickings,

300
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,666
one look at you,
I'd bet they'd run
the other way.

301
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,712
Meaning no offense.

302
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,762
What'll you pay?

303
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,348
I don't have much.

304
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,976
But I have hidden
a bit of silver
from the bandits.

305
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,147
Fair wages
for fair work?

306
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,821
Fair wages
for fair work.

307
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:51,541
<i>( chickens clucking )</i>

308
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,127
<i>( faint voices arguing )</i>

309
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:00,842
-<i> ( punch lands )</i>
<i>- ( man groans )</i>

310
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,387
<i>( girl screams )</i>

311
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,931
<i>( man groaning )</i>

312
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,398
- What did you do?!
-<i> Get your horse saddled.</i>

313
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,567
- You told me
you weren't a thief.
- I wasn't.

314
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,237
He took us in.
He fed us and you--

315
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,989
Aye, he took us in.
He's a good man

316
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,532
and his daughter makes
a nice stew.

317
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,492
And they'll both
be dead come winter.

318
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,036
- You don't know that.
- I do know it.

319
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,289
He's weak.
He can't protect himself.

320
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,709
They'll both be dead
come winter.

321
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,836
Dead men don't need silver.

322
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,716
You're the worst shit
in the Seven Kingdoms.

323
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,634
There's plenty
worse than me.

324
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,554
I just understand
the way things are.

325
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:49,224
How many Starks
they got to behead
before you figure it out?

326
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,189
Ranger:
Raper. Raper.

327
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,941
Horse thief.

328
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,402
Ninth born son.

329
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,445
Raper.

330
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,740
Thief.
Thief and raper.

331
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,242
There he is,
Sam the Slayer.

332
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,745
Going to visit
your wildling whore?

333
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,413
- She's not a whore.
- No?

334
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,707
Maybe I'll give her
a copper tonight
and find out.

335
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,423
They all think
I'm lying.

336
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,550
About what?

337
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,719
Killing the white walker.

338
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,888
You're not lying.

339
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,973
I'll never forget
the way it screamed.

340
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,269
But you're the only one
that saw it.

341
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,063
And they all think
you're just a--

342
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,355
A what?

343
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,317
Well, a wildling.

344
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,612
My father hated that word.

345
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,698
It's not a very nice word,
I suppose.

346
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,617
I don't know.

347
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,746
It makes me sound
a bit dangerous,
doesn't it?

348
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,301
So...

349
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,969
are you all right?

350
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,180
No one bothering you?

351
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,681
I get a lot of looks.

352
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,767
I hear them making
their jokes.

353
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,396
But no one's touched me
if that's what you mean.

354
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,066
I worry about
it sometimes.

355
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:23,360
All the time.

356
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,487
Why do you worry
about it?

357
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,490
100 men, one woman.

358
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,992
They've got other things
to think about.

359
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,662
That's the only thing
they think about.

360
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,748
- You're being silly.
- I'm not being silly.

361
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:41,044
There's 100 men
lying awake at night
picturing you.

362
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,047
What about you?

363
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,051
What about me?

364
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,181
Gilly?

365
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,896
I worry about you.

366
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,528
Thank you.

367
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,779
For what?

368
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,240
For worrying
about me.

369
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,205
I don't know
if you're safe here.

370
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,583
They're my brothers,

371
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,793
but some of them
were thieves before
they came here.

372
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,461
Some of them were rapers.

373
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,756
You saw what they did
at your father's keep.

374
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,218
So what are you saying?

375
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:36,808
Maybe you'd be safer
in Mole's Town.

376
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,733
Are you bored of me?

377
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,902
Bored of you?

378
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,321
I...

379
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,492
I want to protect you.

380
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,792
I'll get these to Hobb.

381
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,253
Keep an eye
on little Sam.

382
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,655
<i>( door closes )</i>

383
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:34,824
<i>( thunder rumbling )</i>

384
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,952
Your Grace.

385
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,955
You're a literary man now.
What do you make of that?

386
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,718
- Joffrey?
- The usurper
Joffrey Baratheon.

387
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,097
<i>I said those words</i>
<i>when I tossed a leech</i>
<i>into the fire.</i>

388
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,933
A leech filled with
bastard blood.

389
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,435
A bastard you set free.

390
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,980
I am now faced with
a great opportunity

391
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,523
and I am powerless
to take advantage of it.

392
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,358
I will find you
an army, Your Grace.

393
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,194
- I've been working
day and night--
- What progress have you made?

394
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,363
I've rallied House Peasebury
to your cause.

395
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,864
House Peasebury.

396
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:18,243
- House Musgood.
- House Musgood.

397
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,537
- And House Haigh.
- House Haigh.

398
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,998
<i>( pieces clatter )</i>

399
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,253
They don't have
enough men between them
to raid a pantry.

400
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:32,090
Westeros is not
the world, Your Grace.

401
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,800
We need to look east
for ships and men.

402
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:37,178
10,000 skilled soldiers
fight for the Golden Company.

403
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,222
- The Golden Company?
- They've never broken
a contract.

404
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,849
They're sellswords.

405
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,434
We're willing to use
blood magic to put you
on the throne,

406
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,227
but we're not willing
to pay men to fight?

407
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,521
Now the Red Woman's
magic is real.

408
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,940
Her visions and prophecies
may be, too,

409
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,609
but I've never heard
of visions and prophecies
winning a war.

410
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,154
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.

411
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:55,322
It's dirty on the ground.

412
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,282
We don't have any gold.

413
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,658
Not yet.

414
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,622
If I do not
press my claim,

415
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,833
my claim
will be forgotten.

416
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:11,629
I will not become
a page in someone
else's history book.

417
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,674
I'm running out
of time, Ser Davos.

418
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,886
Which means you're
running out of time.

419
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:22,098
<i>( knocking )</i>

420
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,600
You're late.

421
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,185
I'm sorry, Princess.

422
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,978
I thought you
weren't coming.

423
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,230
The Hand of the King
doesn't have much
leisure time.

424
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,942
You won't be a very good
Hand if you see the word
knight and say "ka-nigit."

425
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,527
That happened once,
weeks ago.

426
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,404
You're your father's
daughter, no mistake.

427
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,615
Bloody relentless,
the both of you.

428
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,242
It's a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.

429
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,453
But I think you can manage.

430
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,624
You'll never read well
if you move your lips.

431
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,834
That's how children do it.

432
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:59,135
"The Life and Adventures
of Elyo Grivas

433
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,513
First Sword of Braavos."

434
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,556
- ( claps )
- Thank you very much.

435
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,268
I like this one.
It's full of sword fights
and pirates.

436
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,561
You were a pirate once.

437
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,106
No, I was never a pirate.
I was a smuggler.

438
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,357
What's the difference?

439
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,525
Well, if you're
a famous smuggler,

440
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,276
you're not doing it right.

441
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,028
My father says
a criminal is a criminal.

442
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,696
Your father lacks
an appreciation

443
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,283
of the finer points
of bad behavior.

444
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,660
So do the Braavosi.

445
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,286
- You've sailed to Braavos?
- Of course.

446
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,039
Almost got beheaded
by a First Sword of Braavos.

447
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:32,127
I tried to explain to him
the difference between
pirates and smugglers,

448
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,964
but he didn't seem any more
interested in the distinction
than your father.

449
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,841
I suppose if you work
for the Iron Bank of Braavos

450
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,301
and each one
of your gold barges
is worth half a kingdom,

451
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:44,431
you tend not to be overly
concerned with the kind
of distinction--

452
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,243
- What was that for?
- I need you to write
a message.

453
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,328
You should write it yourself.
It's good practice.

454
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,955
It's too important for me.

455
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,208
I need a smart person
to do it. Go on.

456
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:16,296
To the offices
of the Iron Bank of Braavos

457
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:20,175
from Stannis Baratheon
the one true king
of Westeros.

458
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,551
But that's not you.

459
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,344
I need to get
their attention.

460
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,139
Go on. Write.

461
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,272
( baby cooing )

462
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,651
He's seen some
adventures, hasn't he?

463
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,993
<i>( people laughing,</i>
<i>chatting )</i>

464
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,216
- Precious little thing.
- Thank you.

465
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,219
- What's his name?
- Sam.

466
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,721
Lovely.

467
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:07,805
That the daddy?

468
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:08,932
No.

469
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,558
Where's the daddy?

470
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,061
He's dead.

471
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:16,189
Oh. Where you from?

472
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,651
North of here.

473
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,111
North of here?

474
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,909
You a fucking wildling?

475
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,828
- Only room and board?
- That's right.

476
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,248
She'll clean and cook

477
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,708
and look after the other
girls' babies.

478
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,211
Could find other
work for her, too.

479
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,505
- No other work.
- There'd be money.

480
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,131
Give you a piece of it.

481
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,634
No other work.

482
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,866
I promise to come back
and visit whenever I can.

483
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,497
You'll be safer here.

484
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,749
Who's gonna protect you
at Castle Black? Me?

485
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,128
You protected me
north of the Wall.

486
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,671
This is different.

487
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,131
They're brothers
of the Night's Watch

488
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,008
and I can't just stab
them in the back

489
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:28,136
and I can't run away,
which is what we did
at Craster's.

490
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,388
( baby crying )

491
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,016
You have to trust me.

492
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,767
It's for the best.

493
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,149
Best for you.

494
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,693
Oh, Gilly.

495
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,113
Please don't.

496
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,865
( baby crying )

497
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,794
( moaning )

498
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,565
Greedy.

499
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,698
No?

500
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,742
I'm sorry.
You're lovely,

501
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,202
I just never
acquired the taste.

502
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,621
You're calling my beauty
an acquired taste?

503
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:40,583
That's quite
all right, lover.
It's more for you.

504
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,297
Your loss.

505
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,888
You like them
both the same?

506
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:55,890
- Boys and girls?
- Does that surprise you?

507
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:57,600
Everyone has a preference.

508
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,436
Then everyone is missing
half the world's pleasure.

509
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,732
<i>The gods made that</i>
<i>and it delights me.</i>

510
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,902
The gods made this

511
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:09,737
and it delights me.

512
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,739
When it comes to war,
I fight for Dorne.

513
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:15,702
When it comes to love,
I don't choose sides.

514
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,079
I hope I have as much
stamina when I'm your age.

515
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,622
What are you, 25?

516
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,917
- Children.
- ( chuckles )

517
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,461
Someday,
if you're lucky,

518
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,213
you will wake up
and realize you are old.

519
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,215
That pretty ass
of yours will sag.

520
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:32,593
Your belly will grow soft
and your back will ache
in the night

521
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:36,764
and gray hairs will sprout
from your ears.

522
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,183
<i>No one will want</i>
<i>you anymore.</i>

523
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,520
Make sure you fucked
your fill before that day.

524
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:46,357
Did you?

525
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,444
He is a prince of Dorne.

526
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,404
Girls and boys
will line up

527
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,365
to fuck him
till the day he dies.

528
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:00,621
They will all have
to line up behind you.

529
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,040
<i>( door opens )</i>

530
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:08,880
-<i> Prince Oberyn.</i>
<i>- Lord Tywin.</i>

531
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,424
May we have the room?

532
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,138
Call my name
if you need me, lover.

533
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,567
Would you like
to sit?

534
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,736
No, thank you.

535
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,029
Some wine?

536
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,031
<i>No, thank you.</i>

537
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,908
<i>( door closes )</i>

538
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,410
- I'm sorry
about your grandson.
- Are you?

539
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:44,665
I don't believe that
a child is responsible
for the sins of his father.

540
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,126
Or his grandfather.

541
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,170
An awful way to die.

542
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,380
Which way is that?

543
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,674
Are you interrogating
me, Lord Tywin?

544
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,885
Some believe
the king choked.

545
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,970
Some believe the sky
is blue because we live

546
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,681
inside the eye
of a blue-eyed giant.

547
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,061
The king was poisoned.

548
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:07,772
I hear you studied
poisons at the Citadel.

549
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,191
I did.
This is why I know.

550
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,569
Your hatred for my family
is rather well known.

551
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,656
You arrive at the capital,
an expert in poisoning,

552
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:20,535
some days later my grandson
dies of poisoning.

553
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,869
Rather suspicious.

554
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,746
Why haven't you thrown
me in a dungeon?

555
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,457
You spoke with Tyrion
in this very brothel

556
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,584
on the day
that you arrived.

557
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,877
What did you discuss?

558
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,046
You think
we conspired together?

559
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:33,297
What did you discuss?

560
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,801
The death of my sister.

561
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,553
For which you blame me.

562
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,596
She was raped and murdered
by the Mountain.

563
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,474
The Mountain follows
your orders.

564
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,226
Of course I blame you.

565
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,562
Here I stand unarmed,
unguarded.

566
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,355
Should I be concerned?

567
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:54,402
You are unarmed
and unguarded because you
know me better than that.

568
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,736
I am a man of reason.

569
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,280
If I cut
your throat today,

570
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,031
I will be drawn
and quartered tomorrow.

571
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,075
Men at war commit
all kinds of crimes

572
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:02,910
without their
superiors' knowledge.

573
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:06,998
So you deny involvement
in Elia's murder?

574
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,834
Categorically.

575
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,094
I would like to speak
with the Mountain.

576
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:22,388
I'm sure he would enjoy
speaking with you.

577
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:25,349
He might not
enjoy it as much
as he thinks he would.

578
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,688
I could arrange
for this meeting.

579
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:34,483
But you want
something in return.

580
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,028
There will be a trial
for my son.

581
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,071
And as custom dictates,

582
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,116
three judges
will render a verdict.

583
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,492
I will preside.

584
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:46,829
Mace Tyrell will serve
as the second judge.

585
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,123
I would like you
to be the third.

586
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:51,000
Why?

587
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,462
Not long ago, the Tyrells
sided with Renly Baratheon.

588
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,506
Declared themselves
enemies of the throne.

589
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,634
Now they are
our strongest allies.

590
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,802
Well, you made
the Tyrell girl a queen.

591
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,681
Asking me to judge
at your son's trial
isn't quite as tempting.

592
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:09,268
I will also invite you
to sit on the small council

593
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,855
to serve as one of the new
king's principal advisors.

594
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:23,282
I never realized
you had such respect
for Dorne, Lord Tywin.

595
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:27,036
We are not the Seven
Kingdoms until Dorne
returns to the fold.

596
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,665
The king is dead.
The Greyjoys are in
open rebellion.

597
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,960
A wildling army
marches on the Wall.

598
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:38,589
And in the East, a Targaryen
girl has three dragons.

599
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,469
Before long, she will
turn her eyes to Westeros.

600
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,180
Only the Dornish
managed to resist

601
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:50,226
Aegon Targaryen
and his dragons.

602
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,688
You're saying
you need us?

603
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:57,400
That must be hard
for you to admit.

604
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:00,194
We need each other.

605
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:03,030
You help me serve justice
to the king's assassins

606
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:06,075
and I will help you
serve justice to Elia's.

607
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:21,132
<i>( door unlocks )</i>

608
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,264
Podrick.

609
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,141
Apologies for the stench.

610
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,226
I brought you
some wine, my lord,
but they took it from me.

611
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:33,894
A noble effort.

612
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,897
They didn't find
the candles, though.

613
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,233
A quill, some parchment,

614
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,069
duck sausage,
almonds,

615
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,238
and some hard cheese.

616
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:47,033
You're a good lad.

617
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,076
Any word of Shae?

618
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,870
I've heard nothing,
my lord.

619
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:54,206
I suppose
that's a good thing.

620
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,418
What are they
saying about me
out there?

621
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,588
You're to stand trial
in a fortnight

622
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,339
for murdering the king.

623
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,091
Do you believe
I murdered Joffrey?

624
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,761
No, my lord.

625
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,137
You didn't?

626
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,931
No. Gods, no.

627
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,725
The world is a better
place without him,

628
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,686
but I had nothing
to do with it.

629
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,104
I would like to think

630
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,273
if I were arranging
a royal assassination,

631
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:21,400
I'd plan it in such
a way that I wouldn't
be standing there

632
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,570
gawking like a fool
when the king died.

633
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,949
Trial in a fortnight.

634
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,577
<i>Have they announced</i>
<i>the judges yet?</i>

635
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:37,625
- Your father.
- Of course.

636
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,752
Mace Tyrell.

637
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:42,963
Who will vote exactly
as my father tells
him to vote.

638
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,466
And Prince Oberyn
of Dorne.

639
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,510
Oberyn?

640
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,804
Give it to my father.

641
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,556
He never fails
to take advantage
of a family tragedy.

642
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,976
I'm supposed to get a list
of names from you, my lord.

643
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,437
Anyone who might testify
on your behalf.

644
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,898
Oh, I can call
my own witnesses?

645
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,316
<i>How generous of them.</i>

646
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:04,402
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.

647
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,153
My lord, she's gone.

648
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,573
- Gone?
-<i> No one's seen her</i>
<i>since the wedding.</i>

649
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,995
You don't think she...

650
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:21,919
<i>No one had more cause</i>
<i>to kill Joffrey than Sansa,</i>

651
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,921
but the girl
is no assassin.

652
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:27,174
Whoever killed
the king wanted me
to lose my head for it.

653
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:31,887
And with my wife's
disappearance, it makes me
seem that much more guilty.

654
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,639
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

655
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,224
- They'll be
following you now.
- Who will?

656
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:38,018
I don't know. They.
They. The ominous they.

657
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:42,022
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman. My father.

658
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,525
Maybe Joffrey
was too much work for him.

659
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:48,279
Sweet Tommen will be
so much easier to handle.

660
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,364
Whenever something
bad happens to me,

661
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:53,325
I assume it's my sister
that had a hand in it.

662
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,202
<i>But say what</i>
<i>you will of Cersei,</i>

663
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,204
she loves her children.

664
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:01,083
She is the only one
I'm certain had nothing
to do with this murder.

665
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,210
Which makes it unique

666
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,546
as King's Landing
murders go.

667
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,674
Any other witnesses,
my lord?

668
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,801
Varys could vouch
for me if he dared.

669
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,845
He's already been called
as a witness for the queen.

670
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:15,222
Of course. Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.

671
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,682
I've already asked,
my lord.

672
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,392
- They won't let him see you.
- Why not?

673
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:21,187
They say he's
a known cutthroat
and your close associate.

674
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,063
He's under
investigation himself.

675
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,358
And my brother?
Will they at least
allow me to see Jaime?

676
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,736
I'll ask, my lord.

677
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,252
There's something else,
my lord.

678
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:48,505
A man,
I didn't know his face,

679
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,091
he came to ask if
I'd testify against you.

680
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,094
Said I'd be named
Ser Podrick Payne

681
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,473
if I told the judges
you'd bought a poison
called the Strangler.

682
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,767
Ser Podrick Payne?

683
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,478
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?

684
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,355
I didn't tell them
anything, my lord.

685
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,150
Are you going to
accept their offer?

686
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,527
My lord.

687
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,403
Testifying against me
wasn't a suggestion.

688
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,821
If they can't
tempt you with honey,

689
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,531
they'll choose something
less sweet.

690
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:15,991
You've been good
to me, my lord.

691
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,452
Pod, the trial's in
a fortnight.

692
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:20,287
They'll want an answer
before that.

693
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,623
I already gave them
an answer, my lord.

694
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:26,585
I will not have you
dying on my behalf.

695
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,671
Do you hear me?
If I have to take

696
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,673
that long walk to
the executioner's block,

697
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,133
I don't want to see
your head already mounted.

698
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:37,429
- My lord.
- Pod, I am giving
you an order.

699
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:40,683
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.

700
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,310
And get yourself
out of King's Landing

701
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,104
before it's too late.

702
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,855
Pod!

703
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,899
This is farewell.

704
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,779
Farewell, my lord.

705
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,741
<i>( door opens )</i>

706
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:01,453
Pod.

707
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:07,126
There has never lived
a more loyal squire.

708
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:16,051
<i>( door closes )</i>

709
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,359
Boy:
Mother says
it's time to eat.

710
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:36,113
What's she got boiling?
Wait. Wait. Let me guess.

711
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,531
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

712
00:43:37,614 --> 00:43:40,951
Well, no one boils a potato
better than your mom.

713
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,787
Has she got--

714
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,205
Man:
<i>The wildlings!</i>

715
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,874
Guymon!

716
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,002
Hide.

717
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,171
Hide!

718
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,591
( screams )

719
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,010
( shouting, screaming )

720
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,773
( grunting )

721
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:45,099
You know how to get
to Castle Black?

722
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,059
Yes. Yes.

723
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,527
Those your parents?

724
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,781
Open your eyes.

725
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,158
I'm going to eat them.

726
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,827
Do you hear me?

727
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,704
I'm going to eat
your dead mama

728
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:11,208
and I'm going to eat
your dead papa.

729
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:14,920
Go tell the crows
at Castle Black.

730
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,556
Yarwyck:<i> We need to teach</i>
<i>them a lesson about the way</i>
<i>we deal with their kind.</i>

731
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,307
Men:
<i>Aye! Aye!</i>

732
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,809
Yarwyck:
<i>Three dozen bodies</i>
<i>with slit throats</i>

733
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,936
<i>tossed off the top</i>
<i>of the Wall.</i>

734
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:33,105
- Seems like that would
be a good lesson.
- Aye!

735
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:36,525
If we go after them,
we'll be giving them
what they want.

736
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,193
They want to draw us out,

737
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,612
pick us off
a few at a time.

738
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:43,282
We have just over
100 men.

739
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:46,994
And that's including
stewards and builders.

740
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:50,664
And me.
We can't afford
to lose a single man.

741
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:55,252
We must remember our
first responsibility.

742
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:58,505
We are the watchers
on the Wall.

743
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:02,301
There's got to be
a way to protect them.

744
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,887
You're a champion
of the common people,
Lord Snow.

745
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,931
<i>What do you say to</i>
<i>Brother Pyp's proposition?</i>

746
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,105
Mance Rayder is coming.

747
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,525
If the wildlings
breach the Wall,

748
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,487
they'll roll over everything
and everyone for 1,000 miles

749
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,614
before they reach an army
that can stop them.

750
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:30,287
We need to shore up
Castle Black

751
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,707
and we need
to defend the Wall.

752
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,210
<i>That is our job.</i>

753
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,172
<i>( horn blows )</i>

754
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,759
Rangers returning.

755
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,392
Help him.

756
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,980
Thought you'd have
blue eyes by now.

757
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,319
What took you so long?

758
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,863
- We were held up.
- By what?

759
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,448
Chains.

760
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:09,535
We were guests
of the mutineers
at Craster's Keep.

761
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,329
- And the mutineers stayed?
- They're not going anywhere.

762
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:15,374
They've got Craster's food
and his wives.

763
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,792
Dolorous Edd:
<i>Poor girls.</i>

764
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,378
Never thought they'd
miss their daddy.

765
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:20,963
Karl's running things now.

766
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,423
He's the one who put a knife
through Craster's mouth.

767
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,092
We need to ride north
and kill them all.

768
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,593
We just went
over this, boy.

769
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,221
- Justice can wait.
- It's not about justice.

770
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:35,269
I told the wildlings
we had over 1,000 men
at Castle Black alone.

771
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,774
Karl and the others know
the truth as well as we do.

772
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:43,235
How long do you
think they'll keep that
information to themselves

773
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:46,780
when the wildlings
are peeling their
fingernails off?

774
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:51,118
Mance has all he needs
to crush us, he just
doesn't know it yet.

775
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:54,454
As soon as he gets
his hands on them, he will.

776
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:57,124
Then he'll throw
his full strength at us.

777
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:00,460
And even if every one
of us kills 100 wildlings,

778
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,505
there's still not a thing
we can do to stop them.

779
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,426
I don't think I can
kill 100 wildlings.

780
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:34,953
<i>( people murmuring )</i>

781
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,033
Daenerys:
<i>Are they attacking?</i>

782
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,952
Jorah:
<i>A single rider.</i>

783
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,413
<i>A champion of Meereen.</i>

784
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:21,583

788
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,736
What is he doing?

789
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,905
I believe he means to...

790
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:54,491
<i>( city crowd</i>
<i>laughing, cheering )</i>

791
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:55,909

( laughing )

793
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:02,874
He says that we're an army
of men without man parts.

794
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:06,753
He claims you are no woman
at all, but a man who...

795
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,339
hides his cock
in his own asshole.

796
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,925
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.

797
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:15,470
They're not meaningless
if half the city you intend
to take is listening to them.

798
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,723
<i>( continues speaking Valyrian )</i>

799
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:23,812
I have something to say
to the people of Meereen.

800
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:27,899
First, I will need
this one to be quiet.

801
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,609
Do I have a champion?

802
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:33,280
( speaking Valyrian )

803
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:42,456
Your Grace, I've won
more single combats
than any man alive.

804
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,167
Which is why you must
remain by my side.

805
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:48,628
I've been by your side
longer than any of them,
Khaleesi.

806
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,464
Let me stand for you
today as well.

807
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,382
You are my most
trusted advisor,

808
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,510
my most valued general,
and my dearest friend.

809
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,304
I will not gamble
with your life.

810
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,723
Daario:
I was the last
to join your army.

811
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:02,142
I'm not your general
or a member of your
Queensguard

812
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,643
or the commander
of your Unsullied.

813
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,480
My mother was a whore.
I come from nothing.

814
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,065
And before long,
I will return to nothing.

815
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,903
Let me kill
this man for you.

816
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,280
Very well.

817
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,824
You have quite
an audience.

818
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:21,244
Make it worth
their while.

819
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,996
He is very brave,
Your Grace.

820
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,706
Yes, win or lose,

Daario:
<i>Why would I want</i>
<i>a horse?</i>

824
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,519
Horses are faster

825
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,396
Horses are dumber
