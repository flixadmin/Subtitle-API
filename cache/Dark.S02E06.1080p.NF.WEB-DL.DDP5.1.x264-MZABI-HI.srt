I don't follow him, I follow the light.

it all happens exactly as it always has.

No, he does not.

He doesn't want to fix things,
he wants to destroy them forever.

Your role in all this
is much greater than you think.

You alone can finally stop all this.

What are you saying?

477
00:41:52,171 --> 00:41:55,755
You have to fight yourself.

Fight Adam.

479
00:41:58,671 --> 00:42:02,255
But if I don't exist,
if I'm never born, then...

then how could Adam ever come?

it's not what you're expecting.

There are moments
when we must understand

that the decisions we make influence
more than just our own fates.

It's not just about you and Mikkel.

It's about everyone.
