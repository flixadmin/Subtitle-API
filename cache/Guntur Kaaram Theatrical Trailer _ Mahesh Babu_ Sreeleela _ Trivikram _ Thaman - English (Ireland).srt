<font color="#ff2300">>>>> TRAILER <<<<</font>

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,833
You have left your elder son..

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,583
Mom…

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,541
like an orphan...they say.

5
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:13,750
What do you have to say about it?

6
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:22,541
My first emotion when I saw the boy..

7
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,500
Thrilled to see me?

8
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:35,875
Did your heart rate go up?

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,125
Did you feel like whistling?

10
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:44,500
The name is Ramana.

11
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:45,708
Nice to meet you, sir

12
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:46,833
Where is Pani, man?

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,916
Err…he’s waiting inside, sir.

14
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,333
It's his obligation.
Why wouldn't he wait?

15
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:58,125
Pani's daughter is incredible!

16
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,583
Stop pulling my leg, Ramu.

17
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,666
Goodness Gracious!

18
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:04,041
I'm beginning to blush, man.

19
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,916
Do you tear them before wearing
or simply wear them out?

20
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,708
Where to tear and how much to show!

21
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:12,291
It's completely distinct.

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,875
You should have offered her light.

23
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:15,166
I didn't because I had no matchstick.

24
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,041
Leave them.
They made a mistake.

25
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,625
As if he has done some Engineering.

26
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,208
Slap him so tight he should divulge
his mistress's name before his wife.

27
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:36,500
Your son is on a drinking spree, uncle!

28
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,583
That is Royal Satyam.
Simple like a black and white film!

29
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:43,208
This is Rowdy Ramana...
Cinemascope and 70mm.

30
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:45,583
Want to see my game?

31
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:48,125
"Spicy and pungent"

32
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,916
"Stinging curry chilli"

33
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:58,583
Hey!

34
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:00,208
He swallowed a mike.

35
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,583
"Iron bar, heavy hammer,
broken into pieces, by Ramana's blow"

36
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,125
He's a truck without brakes!

37
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,083
Who has the power to halt him?

38
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:21,583
Guntur chilli...

39
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,791
It appears fiery and red.

40
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,041
Once you taste it,
you can't help your tears.

41
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,375
My mother, who was supposed to
beat me when I was small,

42
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:38,541
now sends for me and slaps me
in all dignity.

43
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:40,583
Ramana, I say.

44
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,083
Your life is a miracle, bro.
