1
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,950
CRASH

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,453
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,955
GROUPS, AND BACKGROUNDS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTIONAL

4
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,813
DRIVER

5
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,067
- What is it?
<i>- Where are you?</i>

6
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,735
- I'm busy.
<i>- You're busy?</i>

7
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,153
Yes, I'm hanging up.

8
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,213
Yes.
I'm in front of the dealership.

9
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,715
<i>Come inside. I'll be standing there.</i>

10
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,759
Inside? Okay.

11
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,262
<i>Commence operation.</i>

12
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,266
2023 SEOUL

13
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,575
- Gosh.
- Let's go.

14
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,138
You are insanely hot.

15
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,182
It's beautiful girls, yeah!

16
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,101
You're here to check out the DLE, right?

17
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,561
No, the Benz.

18
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:29,399
- Benz. That one. Yes.
- Yes, the Benz DLE.

19
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,942
It's this way.

20
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,736
I'll show you everything today.

21
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,655
Follow me.

22
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,659
It's this one.

23
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,788
The car is very tidy.
It's clean.

24
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,499
It has no record of any accidents.

25
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,502
It came out in February 2022,
with extremely low mileage.

26
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,212
I mean, 45,000 km. It's practically new.

27
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:55,425
On top of that, it's efficient because
it's diesel. It's to die for.

28
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,635
- It's 4MATIC.
- What? What MATIC?

29
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,388
- Four?
- Oh, 4MATIC.

30
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:01,931
It has an all-wheel drive system.

31
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,725
That means it's strong,

32
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,768
just like me.

33
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:09,022
Then why is it so cheap?
Is there something wrong?

34
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,357
It wasn't damaged in the flood, was it?

35
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,359
Gosh, you girls are so doubtful.

36
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,571
Don't worry. You can check
the vehicle inspection report later.

37
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,991
It's because it was acquired
from an auction. You understand?

38
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,535
We offer an extended warranty too.

39
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,454
So, shall we go sign the contract?

40
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,538
- The contract?
- Yes.

41
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,624
What's the rush?
I'll take it out for a spin and--

42
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,792
The price is unbelievably cheap.

43
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,461
One, two, three.

44
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:34,839
If you don't make a deposit,
it'll go to someone else. Goodbye, 4MATIC.

45
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,759
- But without a test drive--
- Like you'd know anything.

46
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,511
You're supposed to feel the car.

47
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,931
Don't you hear its heartbeat?

48
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:54,484
Girls, you don't know much
about cars.

49
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,528
Besides, that's the rule here. L-U-L.

50
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,156
You can test drive the car
after making a deposit.

51
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,784
Okay?

52
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,411
All right. Come on.

53
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,289
- Let's go. Okay.
- Let's go then.

54
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,668
Delivery.

55
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,800
- Gosh, I'm so hungry.
- Understood, boss.

56
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,635
Mr. Jo Seoktae?

57
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,097
I'm Cha Yeonho, the one who called.

58
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,017
Gosh, what timing.
We were just about to eat.

59
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,105
This was the time
you decided on, Mr. Jo.

60
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,524
Hey, is that my fault?

61
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,525
No, Boss.

62
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,735
I made a big mistake.

63
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,445
No, Boss.

64
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,573
Jjajangmyeon tastes bad
if the noodles get soggy.

65
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,618
I'll wait then.

66
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,328
Let's eat.

67
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:53,960
USED CAR SALES CONTRACT

68
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:13,563
- Mister, I'll start the car.
- Okay. 4MATIC, go, go. Yes.

69
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,445
What's going on?

70
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,239
What's wrong? Try-- Try again.

71
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,325
Is it broken?

72
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,534
It was fine earlier.

73
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,412
This is ridiculous.
We even signed a contract.

74
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:34,083
Used cars can be like that,
even after an examination.

75
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:39,922
Okay. I'll take responsibility
and show you a cheaper and better car.

76
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,718
Come on out. There are many nice cars,
so take a look around.

77
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,511
Let me pop the hood.

78
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,764
What? Why?

79
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,558
Don't you know what a hood is?

80
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:54,437
Why would you open the hood?
What are you going to do?

81
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,898
All right. Let's see.

82
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,153
Goodness, it was unplugged.

83
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,864
Or maybe someone unplugged it on purpose.

84
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,701
Hyunkyung, start the car again.

85
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,789
Yes! Okay.

86
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,791
We can take the car, right?

87
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,125
Well--

88
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,293
Oh, that's right.

89
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,213
I forgot to tell you.
It was acquired from an auction--

90
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,006
So the balance remains?

91
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,674
Or it's imported, so the duty remains.

92
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,551
Perhaps, installment payments remain.

93
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,221
Then you'll take us around
to see other cars

94
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,891
and end up overcharging us
for a lousy used car, right?

95
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,061
If you wanted to make it look like
the car was broken,

96
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,439
you should've removed some fuses too,
not just the injection connector.

97
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,900
Your work was too half-hearted.

98
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:44,070
Did you underestimate us
since we're women? Or did you get lazy?

99
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,491
I didn't want to get grease on my skin.

100
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,995
By the way, are you in this industry?

101
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,624
We aren't in this industry,
but a different one.

102
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,001
Hmm? A different one?

103
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,379
Don't tell meâ€¦

104
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,508
- Po-po?
- Did you hear that?

105
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,344
He called us the po-po.

106
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,685
Okay.

107
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,936
You girls are done for.

108
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:22,859
Get them.

109
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,114
Take this. Yeah!

110
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,001
Which one of you is Jo Seoktae?

111
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,755
- Who are you guys?
- TCI.

112
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,678
Well I'm JST, Jo Seoktae.
Are you guys from a TV station?

113
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,514
See? No one knows about our division.

114
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,058
- I'm sorry.
- Let's just say the Korean name.

115
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:00,605
It's cooler to use the English acronyms.
FBI, CIA, and BTS.

116
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,648
Where did BTS come from?

117
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,151
Which country's police agency is BTS?

118
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,112
What?

119
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,577
- What are you looking at?
- You startled me!

120
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,786
Who are you guys?

121
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,164
- I said TCI. T-C-I.
- Traffic Crime Investigation.

122
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,082
T-- Stop!

123
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,709
One, two, three.

124
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,504
TCI. Traffic Crime Investigation.

125
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,130
Boys, get them.

126
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,883
Okay. Hyunkyung, get jjajang.
I'll get pizza.

127
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,927
- Donggi, get the others inside.
- Okay.

128
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,678
Let's go.

129
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,181
Are you jjajang or pizza?

130
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,724
I didn't eat--

131
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,615
Excuse me. Look over here.

132
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,576
- Excuse me.
- <i>This is your announcement.</i>

133
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,411
- Look over here.
- <i>Please pay attention.</i>

134
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:43,624
I'll teach you how to use this.
These are disposable handcuffs.

135
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,252
Push your hands through the holes here.

136
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,754
Then you'll pull the ends.

137
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,172
It'll be hard to do it alone,

138
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,092
so form a group of two
and help the person next to you.

139
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,677
Here you go. Thank you.

140
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,345
Here you go. It's the other way.

141
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,431
It's the other way. Yes.

142
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,408
Darn it.

143
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,744
- Hey, these po-pos--
- Hey!

144
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,997
These officers know everything.

145
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,376
Mr. Jo Seoktae. You are under arrest
for fraud, intimidation, assault--

146
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,629
- Where are they?
- Boss.

147
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,006
- What's going on?
- Hey.

148
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,634
Don't just stand there. Do something!

149
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,218
Okay.

150
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,810
Freeze. No, wait.

151
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,896
Freeze!

152
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:53,277
- Freeze!
- Okay, well doneâ€¦ â€¦nice play.

153
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,489
- What?
- You startled me. Why are you shouting?

154
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,740
What did you say?

155
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,658
Can't you hear me?

156
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,659
- Freeze!
- Stop it.

157
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,285
His eardrums are ruptured. Cuff them.

158
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,996
- His eardrums are ruptured. Yawn.
- What? What?

159
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,748
He startled me.

160
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,541
What?

161
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,669
Yawn.

162
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,799
Mister, get up.

163
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,802
Mister. I said, get up.

164
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:30,189
CRASH

165
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,443
EPISODE ONE

166
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:47,373
SEOUL NAMGANG POLICE STATION

167
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,959
- What's this?
- They must be here for our case.

168
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,877
- What?
- Did you call the reporters?

169
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,004
What?

170
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,841
Either way, it's been a while
since we've been on the news.

171
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,432
They're here.

172
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,642
- They're here.
- The van is here.

173
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,980
Do you confess
to committing the crime?

174
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,815
How many times did you do it?

175
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,442
Please answer the question.

176
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,902
Please say a word.

177
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:17,903
Isn't that Han Jiho?

178
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,447
- Who?
- Don't you know who Han Jiho is?

179
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,407
Han Jiho.

180
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,910
- Mr. Han.
- Please say something.

181
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,787
Mr. Han.

182
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,880
Who are these people?

183
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:40,551
Ah, the TCI arrested used car dealers
who utilized false advertising--

184
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,803
- Oh, a used car fraud.
- Yes.

185
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,013
All right then.

186
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,434
Can you just e-mail me a short summary?

187
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,435
Yes, of course.

188
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,937
- Would you pose for a photo?
- Sure.

189
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,647
- Step forward.
- It's for a photo.

190
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,193
- Shall we say, "Let's go?"
- Let's go.

191
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,319
One, two, three.

192
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,945
Let's go.

193
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,864
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

194
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,243
They should use tax money
to build a better office.

195
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,537
- It's dirty--
- Hey. Why are you number one?

196
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,831
I have insanely hot looks.

197
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,208
Switch with me, you punk.

198
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,585
Aren't you exercising
the right to remain silent?

199
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,379
Quiet down.

200
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,673
Number 34, come on in.

201
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,467
Shouldn't you start
with number one?

202
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,135
This is ridiculous.

203
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,388
What do you think you're doing?

204
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,140
Come over here.

205
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,017
- Stay still.
- Hey.

206
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,228
- Stay still.
- For goodness' sake.

207
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,897
- What do you think you're doing?
- Darn it.

208
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,190
- Gosh.
- Right now--

209
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,900
Isn't this too much?

210
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,778
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

211
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,279
- Hey, stop it.
- Sit here.

212
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,245
Name.

213
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,997
- Pardon?
- Don't you have a name?

214
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,292
- It's Cha Yeonho.
- Cha Yeonho.

215
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,213
- Resident registration number.
- 901114-135729.

216
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,006
Specialty.

217
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,428
Management, sales, or inducement.
Which department did you work in?

218
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,769
Goodness.

219
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,279
- What's this?
- You asked me where I worked.

220
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,241
INVESTIGATOR CHA YEONHO

221
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,077
- You're not involved in the used-car scam?
- No.

222
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,330
Oh, my. I mean-- Goodness.

223
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,500
Sir, come here. Mr. Cha.

224
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,420
You should've told us
that you weren't involved.

225
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:43,215
Why did you come all the way here
in these heavy handcuffs?

226
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,009
I didn't have a chance to speak.

227
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,679
Who did that? Gosh, I can't believe
these punks.

228
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,475
I see. Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

229
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:58,272
Why was an insurance investigator having
a jjajangmyeon party with those guys?

230
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,274
I was investigating something.

231
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,194
Since I'm here, I'll make a report.

232
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,245
It's a serial murder case.

233
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,748
That's for the Criminal Division.

234
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,625
But cars were used in the murders.

235
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:36,185
Then I'll look over these documents
and contact you later.

236
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,610
Why? Do you have something else to say?

237
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,280
I'll await your call.

238
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,240
Okay.

239
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,205
Take care, Mr. Cha.

240
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,752
For goodness' sake.

241
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,754
Hey, I didn't tell you to come in.

242
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,255
- Ms. Hot Looks.
- What?

243
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,216
I'm number one. You should go in order.

244
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,885
Miss, my heart feels tight.
It's the lack of oxygen.

245
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,221
- What are these numbers for?
- Be quiet!

246
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,810
Be quiet.
You guys can go next.

247
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,396
Eight leaders,

248
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,065
including three in charge, were detained.
The rest were let go.

249
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,692
- You guys did well.
- All done.

250
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,568
It's up. Our article is online.

251
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,237
- Let's see it. Captain.
- Here.

252
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,446
- Here.
- Let's see it.

253
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,614
TCI BUSTS USED CAR FRAUD GROUP

254
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,075
Gosh, an innocent civilian
ended up in the photo.

255
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,035
What's up with this article?

256
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,329
We aren't the
Traffic Investigation Crime Team.

257
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,915
It's the Traffic Crime Investigation Team.

258
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,583
- Let's read the comments.
- Comments?

259
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,002
It got six downvotes.

260
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,503
Why did they downvote it?

261
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,380
- What's a downvote?
- Downâ€¦

262
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,428
We're done, so let's eat something tasty.

263
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,470
Okay. Let's go.

264
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,348
- Let's go.
- Okay.

265
00:16:58,642 --> 00:16:59,935
Over here.

266
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,605
Gosh, Captain Jung's face
has gotten gaunt.

267
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:07,234
I'll make you a fried egg. Wait a little.

268
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,319
For goodness' sake!

269
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,453
We should eat beef on a day like this.

270
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,289
Is bulgogi your idea of tasty food?

271
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,708
It's all the same.
Who can tell if it's beef or pork?

272
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,168
The tongue knows.

273
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,218
Sir, did you read the article about TCI?

274
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,928
They arrested 30 scammers.

275
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,680
They say an empty wagon is louder.

276
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,850
They aren't the Criminal Division.
TCI doesn't do investigations.

277
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,019
They should know their place
as the traffic police.

278
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,646
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hey.

279
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,233
What? There are no seats.

280
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,985
- How many people?
- Seven.

281
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,070
Seven?

282
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,281
The big tables aren't available.

283
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,784
You'll need to wait a little.

284
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,951
Darn it.

285
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,330
Did they come to work or to eat?

286
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,291
Why is your small team
using such a big table?

287
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,544
- Just let it go.
- Don't get up.

288
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,380
Captain So, I can hear you.

289
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,884
I wanted you to hear it. Am I wrong?

290
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,804
You should've found a table
that suited your size and place.

291
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,847
Why would you talk about our place?

292
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,433
Captain Jung is here too.
Aren't you being too blunt?

293
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:25,229
Chaeman, you were here.
I didn't see you there in the corner.

294
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,524
By the way,
what do you think you're doing?

295
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,485
That attitude lacks respect
for your senior.

296
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,987
If you want me to treat you
like my senior, act like one.

297
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,739
Excuse me?

298
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,242
Let's go.

299
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,036
Don't just sit there.

300
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,163
- Captain.
- Come here.

301
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,964
What are you doing?
Your captain is calling you.

302
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:54,842
Come on in.

303
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,052
Come on in.

304
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,405
Why did you move? It made us lose face.

305
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,782
We're here to eat meat, not to save face.

306
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,660
They think we're their underlings
since you keep acting that way.

307
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,168
I shouldn't have joined TCI.

308
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:33,338
At the Traffic Accident Investigation,
I would've moved up easily as an ace.

309
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,301
Ever since following you here,
I get all the work and criticism.

310
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,387
The Criminal Division look down on us
for being the traffic police.

311
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,598
The Traffic Division criticizes us
for stealing manpower.

312
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,394
Why did you even make TCI?
You should've just switched teams.

313
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,148
For honor? Or to brag?

314
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:54,860
How would a petty bird understand
the profound thoughts of a phoenix?

315
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,570
A petty official?

316
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,114
Did you call me a petty official?

317
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,449
- A petty bird.
- A petty--

318
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,661
Hey, Dad.

319
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,456
<i>Hurry over here.
Grandma Bongsoon passed away.</i>

320
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,373
What?

321
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,046
MAY YOU REST IN PEACE

322
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,830
Jinyoung.

323
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,542
I'm so sorry.

324
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,421
Jinyoung, how did this happen?

325
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,055
It's okay.

326
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,020
Dad, what happened?
Grandma was fine a few days ago.

327
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,647
It was a car accident.

328
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,733
Last night, she was pulling a handcart
to collect waste paper.

329
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,737
How did that happen?

330
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,992
- What about the perpetrator?
- He's in a pitiful situation too.

331
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,578
He's a young man without a secure job.

332
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,706
He lives from hand to mouth.

333
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,792
He came by earlier and bawled

334
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,295
while embracing Jinyoung.

335
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,421
My goodness.

336
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,092
Want a glass?

337
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,307
What? Why is heâ€¦

338
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,268
What is it? Do you know him?

339
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,854
What? Dad, hold on.

340
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,946
Number 34, right?
We met at the police station earlier.

341
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,660
What brings you here?

342
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,330
Did you know Grandma Bongsoon?

343
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,837
You didn't read the document I gave you.

344
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,385
Could it beâ€¦

345
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,972
Your action came first,
so I thought you'd be different.

346
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,102
That was my fourth police station.

347
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,229
I shouldn't even bother anymore.

348
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:59,211
KIM BONGSOON

349
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:15,912
INSURANCE CLAIM FORM

350
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,298
JUNG HOKYU

351
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,011
Jung Hokyu.

352
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,512
Jung Hokyu.

353
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,979
Name, Jung Hokyu. Age, 32 years old.

354
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:44,191
He doesn't have a stable job.
Two years ago, he had a bad credit score.

355
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:47,527
Then he began getting driver's insurance.
Now, he has five in total.

356
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,321
Including Grandma Kim Bongsoon,

357
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:52,157
he caused four accidents
in a year in a half.

358
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,242
Three died and one was seriously injured.

359
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,497
All his victims were old grandmas
without any close family members.

360
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,790
He settled with the families
in the previous three cases.

361
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:04,127
The court ruled them as accidents
and put him on probation.

362
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:07,005
The settlement money ranged
from three to five million won.

363
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:12,135
But from his driver's insurance policies,
he received a total of 120 million won.

364
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,138
That means he kept at least
100 million won to himself.

365
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,183
To reduce the settlement money,
he targeted old women

366
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,727
- without close family members.
- Yes.

367
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,980
Despite the bad credit,
he has too many insurance policies.

368
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,900
Circumstances tell us
that the accidents were intentional.

369
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,735
For a sum of one death benefit,

370
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:32,364
he attempted to kill four people
despite having to pay for the settlement.

371
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,199
It reduces his chances of getting caught.

372
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:38,787
If Lieutenant Min is right,
it's a serial murder of senior citizens.

373
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,749
But as the court ordered probation,
it won't be easy to overturn it.

374
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,252
And we only have jurisdiction
over the last accident.

375
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,254
The insurance investigator who reported it

376
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,006
already visited three police stations
before coming here.

377
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,343
It was the lack of investigation
that led to this serial murder.

378
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,970
We must find evidence.

379
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,097
Let's be open to different possibilities.

380
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,933
We don't know if it's a coincidence
or a serial murder.

381
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,395
- Let's meet the victim's family first.
- Okay.

382
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,605
Hyunkyung, check the vehicle.

383
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,984
Donggi, check the nearby
surveillance footages.

384
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,902
- Okay.
- All right then.

385
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:18,493
â™ª <i>A dragonfly flies around</i> â™ª

386
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,664
â™ª <i>A dragonfly sits on a flower</i> â™ª

387
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,916
Nayeon, are you in a good mood?

388
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,751
â™ª <i>Hush, hush</i> â™ª

389
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,760
Darn it.

390
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,431
Is she insane? Damn.

391
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,563
â™ª <i>The dog's barking made it fly away</i> â™ª

392
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:47,689
Hey!

393
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,316
- Hey, are you insane?
- Hey!

394
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,318
They startled me.
What's up with them?

395
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,569
Can't you drive?

396
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:55,697
- Who do you think you are? Stop the car!
- Hey!

397
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,491
- Drive properly!
- Hey!

398
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,619
- Hey!
- Stop the car!

399
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,620
Hey!

400
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,538
Those bastards.

401
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,125
Nayeon, don't cry. It's okay.

402
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,793
Stop the car.

403
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,670
Come on.

404
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,137
- Stop the car, okay?
- Stop the car.

405
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,513
Pick on someone your own size!

406
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,682
- Hey.
- What? Is that a woman?

407
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,267
- Stop the car.
- What is she doing?

408
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,270
Son One, Son Two.
We need backup for retaliatory driving.

409
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,147
- Stop the car.
- We'll teach you a lesson.

410
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,106
You're laughing?

411
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,275
- Hey.
- What? What's that?

412
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,360
- Gosh.
- Damn it!

413
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,362
- Captain, hold tight.
- Why?

414
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,993
What? What are you doing?

415
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,955
You could just drive forward!

416
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,255
- Gosh.
- Can't you drive properly?

417
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,674
- Gosh.
- Darn it!

418
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,886
Pull over.

419
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,846
- Darn it.
- Are they cops?

420
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,431
Back off.

421
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,309
What's that?

422
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,812
- Gosh.
- The police are behind us.

423
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,438
Pull over.

424
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,360
- Come on.
- I told you to drive properly.

425
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,319
Damn!

426
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,406
Captain, hold on tight.

427
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,038
Unbelievable.

428
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,464
She got into an accident
because she jaywalked.

429
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,924
What do you expect me to do?

430
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:43,430
I told her repeatedly to use
the crossroads, even if it took longer.

431
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,516
She never listened
and jaywalked all the time.

432
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,351
For goodness' sake.

433
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:53,898
You received four million for settlement.

434
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,735
What was I supposed to do?
He has no money.

435
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,445
I would've felt victimized too.

436
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,488
It wasn't even a crosswalk.

437
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,783
The accident happened at a place
without a single street lamp.

438
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,368
The driver was unlucky.

439
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,955
Why is everyone talking
about the accident?

440
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,875
Did someone else come?

441
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:17,338
He was from an insurance company.
He said he was an insurance investigator.

442
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,299
My goodness.

443
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,510
My aunt was 82 years old.

444
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,346
She got Alzheimer's last year.

445
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:29,809
I got a call from the police every day
to come pick her up.

446
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,729
Right. Do you see her scar right here?

447
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:36,316
Don't get me started.
She cut my baby with scissors.

448
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,109
I was so shocked.

449
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,154
Thank goodness her eyes weren't hurt.

450
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:43,406
Your aunt didn't have any children?

451
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,577
She had one son,
but he cut off contact a long time ago.

452
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,288
Perhaps I shouldn't say this,

453
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,624
but I'm rather glad that she passed away.

454
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:56,711
I feel like she left in order to save
her niece the trouble.

455
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,380
- You met the driver, right?
- Yes.

456
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,467
Yes, and he cried so much.

457
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,261
Even I felt bad for him,

458
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,847
as this accident could ruin his future.

459
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,809
Would you like more tteokbokki?

460
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,644
No, thank you.

461
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,398
Do you have any plans
to enter a different profession?

462
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,775
Stop speaking nonsense.

463
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:19,692
Mr. Song Jiman.

464
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,779
- Yes?
- Hello, Mr. Song Jiman.

465
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:25,907
What are you doing here?

466
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,408
I had something to investigate.

467
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:32,580
We're here on police duty,
so please give us some privacy.

468
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:36,584
I got here first. Why don't you wait?

469
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,258
Let's just investigate.
The police duty can come later.

470
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,595
Please resume.

471
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,890
Okay. You know how it is
in the countryside.

472
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,393
The roads have no shoulder.

473
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,521
When she returned from the field,
she had to walk down the roads.

474
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,066
Your mother's accident occurred
on a long, straight road.

475
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,026
Was there anything strange about it?

476
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,946
At first, I found it strange.

477
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,407
There were no other cars around
and the road was straight.

478
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,117
I wondered how he missed my mother.

479
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:13,454
But then I noticed that the place had
poor backlight around sunset.

480
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,624
I almost got in an accident there
a few times too.

481
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,084
Excuse me.

482
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:22,630
It might be a rude question,
but the settlement money was quite small.

483
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,758
Was I supposed to make a profit
from my mother's life?

484
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,636
- No, I mean--
- I know what you mean.

485
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,930
It wasn't as if he did it on purpose.

486
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,599
He was simply unlucky.

487
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,269
I'm a driver myself,
so I know what car accidents are like.

488
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:39,731
It might happen
if I get distracted for a split second.

489
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,155
Excuse me.

490
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,324
Hello? Excuse me.

491
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:54,370
Although it's late,
we're investigating the case you reported.

492
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:58,708
- So please leave the investigation to us.
- I'm simply doing my job.

493
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:02,170
It's not only a murder case,
but also an insurance fraud.

494
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,342
It seems like we're visiting
the same places. Where are you going next?

495
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,802
Why do you ask?

496
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,597
If we're headed the same way,
I can give you a lift.

497
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,975
It's okay. This is more convenient for me.

498
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:28,071
Let's hurry up. Come on.
Why are you smiling?

499
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,365
He'll go to Jung Hokyu.
Let's get there first.

500
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,659
Hurry up.

501
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,873
I've already been through
questioning at the police station.

502
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,752
Yes. We checked the files,
but we wanted to go over a few things.

503
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:50,176
Uh-- By any chance,
did anyone else pay you a visit?

504
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:54,263
No. Is someone else coming?

505
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,640
No, don't worry about it.

506
00:32:56,933 --> 00:33:00,019
You testified
that you couldn't see the victim

507
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,604
because the street lamp was dim.

508
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,733
The road was very dark.

509
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,027
I was checking the GPS.

510
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,572
I saw her and stepped on the brakes,
but it was too late.

511
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,995
I see. What were you doing
in that neighborhood?

512
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,621
It was quite far from your place.

513
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,081
Oh. Well,

514
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,835
I had just bought a used car.

515
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:28,881
I was heading home
after driving around in my new car.

516
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,634
But I ended up getting lost.

517
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:37,015
It's all my fault. Had I checked
the GPS properlyâ€¦

518
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:42,603
It was
your fourth traffic accident

519
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:45,481
in the span of two years.

520
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,736
I must be cursed or something.

521
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,531
It drives me crazy because
these things keep happening to me.

522
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,950
I'm sorry.

523
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,202
I'm sorry.

524
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,348
He does have
the most innocent-looking eyes.

525
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,561
What did he do to have
all the bereaved families side with him?

526
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,980
They aren't necessarily siding with him.

527
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,066
It's unfortunate, but it seems like

528
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:31,027
the victims were a big burden
to the people around them.

529
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,781
Is there a chance all four
accidents are purely a coincidence?

530
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:36,908
<i>Jeongeojigam.</i>

531
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,534
LEARN FROM YOUR PAST MISTAKES

532
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:42,205
When a wagon flips over, the following
wagons are bound to take caution.

533
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:45,416
Unfortunately, Jung Hokyu repeated
the same mistake four times.

534
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,002
It's one of the two.

535
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,963
He's either a fool who doesn't learn
anything from his mistakes,

536
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,091
or a natural-born scammer.

537
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:04,060
- Guys.
- Lieutenant, you brought snacks.

538
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,144
Stop it.

539
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,562
Did you find anything?

540
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,191
All four cases didn't have
any CCTV footage

541
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,984
or dashcam videos.

542
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,569
If the accidents were planned,

543
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,613
he must've picked such locations
on purpose.

544
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,866
- How about the vehicle?
- We were too late.

545
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,828
All four vehicles were scrapped.

546
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,247
He bought cheap used cars only

547
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,749
and got them scrapped
right after committing the crimes.

548
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,084
He's quite meticulous.

549
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,796
That means there isn't a single lead.

550
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,175
Let me step outside for a second.

551
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:37,718
Where are you going?

552
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,887
We'll eat without you.

553
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,383
Are you okay?

554
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,806
What were you doing
in the middle of the road?

555
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,770
Mr. Cha Yeonho.

556
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,192
Let's go to the hospital, Mr. Cha.

557
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,653
What did you do just now?

558
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:44,452
I was simulating the accident
using the same car as Jung Hokyu.

559
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,046
What is it?

560
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,301
The weather was very clear
on the evening of the accident.

561
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,638
If I calculate the coefficient of friction
to be 0.8 on a flat asphalt road,

562
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,891
the speed of the vehicle
was about 78 km per hour.

563
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,852
He stepped on the brakes
3 m before the impact.

564
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,438
That information is already in the report.

565
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,731
He admitted to speeding.

566
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,483
He said he stepped on the brakes late

567
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,610
because he was looking at the GPS.

568
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,819
The problem isâ€¦

569
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,032
this spot where the yaw mark begins.

570
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,117
THE TRACE OF A TIRE'S ABRASION

571
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,744
Two meters before the impact,

572
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:12,581
the driver suddenly turned the wheel
to the left.

573
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,639
When the accident occurred,
the victim was picking up waste paper.

574
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,853
The victim's handcart was parked 5 m away.

575
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:49,201
Jung Hokyu didn't turn the wheel
in order to avoid the victim.

576
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,416
He was afraid that he'd miss the victim
by avoiding the handcart,

577
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,542
so he turned the wheel.

578
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,509
That's a nice interpretation,

579
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:09,930
but how can we prove
that the driver hit the victim on purpose?

580
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,939
The vehicle from the accident
was already scrapped.

581
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:22,485
There isn't a single surveillance camera
at the scene.

582
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,738
- We need some kind of a lead--
- Have you ever been in a car accident?

583
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:32,536
Those who have been in one know
how scary cars can be.

584
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,831
It applies to both the perpetrator
and the victim.

585
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,588
Jung Hokyu caused four accidents
in two years.

586
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,632
Three of them resulted in death.

587
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,843
And within a month
after causing the accidents,

588
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,762
he bought another used car.

589
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:55,893
Jung Hokyu will soon buy another used car.

590
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,321
What's this?

591
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,074
I found it
in Jung Hokyu's insurance records.

592
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,425
Don't we have records
of Jung Hokyu's used car purchases?

593
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,844
Where are they?
We'll need to see where he got them.

594
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,596
And go over this. Where did I put it?

595
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,225
It's a recording of his call
to the insurance company's call centerâ€¦

596
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,186
employee.

597
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,106
Are you guys heading home?

598
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,607
Well, no.

599
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,484
Of course not.

600
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,694
Captain, please go home.

601
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,029
You must be hungry. I'll go buy snacks.

602
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,030
Rabokki, please.

603
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,782
With ten boiled eggs.

604
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,868
- Cheesy gimbap too.
- Stop acting cute.

605
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,453
What's "Cheesy"?

606
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,538
It's-- Thank you.

607
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,040
Tell me what it is.

608
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,418
<i>If the victim dies,</i>

609
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,171
<i>how much do I get
for police investigation and settlement?</i>

610
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,006
<i>It depends on the plan,</i>

611
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,633
<i>but the usual number is
from 30 to 50 million won.</i>

612
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,594
<i>Thirty to fifty million won?</i>

613
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,179
<i>Hold on.</i>

614
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,097
<i>What?</i>

615
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,310
<i>- Hello?</i>
<i>- Yes, go ahead.</i>

616
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:23,147
<i>I don't want the plan that gives</i>
<i>me benefits when the insurance expires.</i>

617
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:27,651
<i>I want the plan that gives me
benefits when there's an accident.</i>

618
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,864
It's quite blatant.

619
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,408
We'll be able to use it
as circumstantial evidence.

620
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,202
Where did you get it?

621
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:39,747
What? Well, I got it
from an insurance company employee.

622
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:44,752
I see. That was why you left so suddenly.

623
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,546
You're the best.

624
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,258
MAGIC DREAM CAR

625
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,135
What?

626
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,014
What? Hold on.

627
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,019
Oh, so it was you?

628
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,562
What? Who is it?

629
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:07,107
We didn't need to look far.
We caught a useful lead.

630
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,192
MAGIC DREAM CAR

631
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:17,034
Why are you looking for him?

632
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,078
That's none of your business.

633
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:28,754
Perhaps I've seen him somewhere.

634
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,674
- If you don't know him, go back inside.
- Miss.

635
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,886
What if I know him?

636
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,681
This place makes
tasty seolleungtang, right?

637
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,058
Their galbitang is even tastier.

638
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,102
Galbitang.

639
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,485
I think it was about two years ago.

640
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,655
He said he was fine
as long as the car moved.

641
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:55,990
The cheapest cars,

642
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,201
compact cars, and old cars.

643
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,287
He only looked for such cars.

644
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:05,916
In less than half a year, he came back
looking for the same cars.

645
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,377
And he didn't tell you why?

646
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,587
I asked him.

647
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:15,175
I was like, "Who could this man be?
I'm curious about him."

648
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,306
Sir, what do you do for a living?

649
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,351
This car will give me a living.

650
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,691
That was when I got a hunch.

651
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,569
"He isn't an ordinary man."

652
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:40,242
SEOUL NAMGANG POLICE STATION

653
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,927
Where to, Miss?

654
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:03,849
All right. Home, please.

655
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,477
You must be very tired.

656
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,770
Yes.

657
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,731
I barely got any sleep. I'm exhausted.

658
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,778
- What about dinner?
- I had gimbap.

659
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:19,281
Or was it instant noodles?
I don't remember.

660
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,370
Did you send Grandma Bongsoon off well?

661
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,080
Yes.

662
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:31,335
It seems like
Jinyoung reached a settlement.

663
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,421
A settlement? With whom?

664
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,759
Must you ask?
The young man who caused the accident.

665
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:39,927
Jung Hokyu?

666
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,680
How? How much did Jinyoung get?

667
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,474
- I think 3.5 million won.
- Did you say 3.5 million?

668
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:52,064
The driver was
in a pitiful situation.

669
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:55,859
He could only pull together
about 3.5 million won.

670
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,445
He begged for forgiveness

671
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,073
and promised to pay back
when his situation improved.

672
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:03,492
So Jinyoung couldn't complain.

673
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:18,257
He got 50 million won from insurance
and paid 3.5 million won for settlement.

674
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,678
The only surviving next of kin is
a high schooler, but this is too much.

675
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,355
Let's use Jo Seoktae.

676
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,526
Jung Hokyu will come again
to buy a used car.

677
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,487
So you want to set a trap and wait?

678
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,656
Do you want to install a camera
in the car?

679
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:45,367
That's illegal. Go with wiretapping
and location tracking.

680
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,703
It'll only be circumstantial evidence.

681
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:50,205
It's the only way
to prove his intentionality.

682
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,875
Illegally-obtained evidence
is inadmissible. You know that.

683
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,043
It was admissible sometimes.
We have a chance.

684
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:58,297
We can't depend on a slim chance
and run an illegal investigation.

685
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,924
- We're the police.
- Another old woman will die.

686
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,095
The court let him go every time.

687
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,265
Without concrete evidence,
we'll never put Jung Hokyu behind bars.

688
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:12,644
The deceased victims,

689
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,022
including Grandma Bongsoon,

690
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:18,066
were old grandmas who didn't have
family members to come to the funeral.

691
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,696
As if he was on a hunt, Jung Hokyu
picked the helpless and ran them over.

692
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,157
It's sad enough that they suddenly passed
in a car accident.

693
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,452
If they were murders,
who'll bring justice?

694
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:32,247
No spring comes
before the camellia flowers.

695
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:34,875
Excuse me?

696
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,879
Nothing good will come out
if we cross the line.

697
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,510
Okay. I understand.

698
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,807
You can feign ignorance.
I'll take full responsibility.

699
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,104
I'm sorry.

700
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,491
Bring Jo Seoktae.

701
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,829
Who are you to take responsibility?
That's my role as the captain.

702
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,080
Gosh, how is this my life?

703
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,375
I'll probably end up dying early.

704
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,050
This galbitang tastes incredible.

705
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:27,177
How long do I need to wait?

706
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,554
Shall I call him and say

707
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,097
that there's a nice car?

708
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,225
By the way, what does he do with the cars?

709
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,936
Fraud? Murder?

710
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,397
Girls. Hey, fatty.

711
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,734
I need to know the situation
to respond accordingly.

712
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,321
We're the ones who'll respond.
You just do as we say.

713
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,324
She always says hurtful things.

714
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,119
COMPACT CAR REGULAR

715
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,592
- Hello.
<i>- You have a car, right?</i>

716
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:11,096
My goodness. I was waiting for your call.

717
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:19,980
A good car came in. When will you visit?

718
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,316
<i>I'll call you when I'm there.</i>

719
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,611
You know the parking lot
in front of the dealership, right?

720
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,864
Yes, I'll be waiting there. Uh--

721
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,073
Hello?

722
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:39,374
Even if you roll in poop,
outside is better. The sky is beautiful.

723
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,628
- Be your usual self. Don't overreact.
- Take off your jacket.

724
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,881
Miss, credibility is my virtue.

725
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,216
- Just keep your promise.
- You talk too much.

726
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,762
I feel like a police officer.

727
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,279
What do you think?

728
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,699
The body is rusty, but a 2009 model
with a mileage of 170,000 km.

729
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,451
It's pretty excellent, right?

730
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:15,869
I'll take this one.

731
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,204
<i>You have a good taste.</i>

732
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,999
<i>Shall we sign the contract at a cafÃ©?
I'm craving some caffeine.</i>

733
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,167
- <i>And the car?</i>
<i>- Leave it.</i>

734
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,752
<i>My employee will come and park it.</i>

735
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:24,878
Let's go.

736
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,295
Drive safely.

737
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:15,012
- A customer is always welcome.
- I told him not to overreact.

738
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,221
But you come too often.

739
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,647
Take care.

740
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,452
Let's grab a cup of coffee.

741
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,079
I already drank coffee.

742
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,251
Let's talk.

743
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:36,885
- Do you have a light?
- Why did you call me over?

744
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,971
So, you're reinvestigating
Jung Hokyu's case.

745
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,057
I'm examining it.

746
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,018
Why would you poke around a closed case?
It's too much work.

747
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:48,146
I suspect an insurance fraud
for the police investigation fund.

748
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,439
So it's natural to--

749
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,109
The police investigation fund?
Fifty million?

750
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:55,237
The total is 120 million won for 3 cases.
He caused another accident recently.

751
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,448
It has only been
a single 50-million won case for us.

752
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:02,577
You know well.

753
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,205
You were in charge, after all.

754
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,752
Three people died.

755
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:14,339
- One got a first-degree disability.
- You little--

756
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,967
It isn't our fault, is it?

757
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,345
Bury it. Don't blow up the matter
for a measly sum.

758
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,433
I told you to bury it.

759
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:29,688
- Did you receive money?
- What?

760
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,982
Out of 50 million won,
how much did you receive?

761
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,817
How dare you?

762
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,612
If you didn't receive money,

763
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,282
why are you doing this?

764
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,370
In a year, one trillion won gets lost

765
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,414
due to insurance fraud.

766
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,208
One trillion won.

767
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,044
Who cares about 50 million won?

768
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,215
First,

769
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,594
I'll report it to the director.

770
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,014
Go ahead.

771
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,640
The director won't bat an eye.

772
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:13,815
Nothing brings profits these days.
Isn't it the same for you?

773
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:17,527
Investing in land, stocks, and properties
doesn't bring profits.

774
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,945
It's the same everywhere.

775
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,780
No. Hey, listen.

776
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,033
We shouldn't meet there.

777
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:26,203
Let's meet at the sashimi place
across the street at 7 p.m.

778
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:28,955
Okay. Take your time.

779
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,625
Yes.

780
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,084
It's okay.

781
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,795
I'll call a chauffeur.
I'll be ruined if I get caught.

782
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:36,880
Okay.

783
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:40,091
All right.

784
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,274
Name, Yoon Sungja. Age, 81 years.

785
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:59,319
She's a welfare recipient
without a family that can support her.

786
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:03,114
Jung Hokyu followed her eight times
over the course of a week.

787
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:09,246
<i>She works in the field during the day.</i>

788
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:12,958
<i>Because she has a mobility scooter,
she always uses the shoulder of the road.</i>

789
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,836
<i>He approached her</i>
<i>in the guise of help</i>

790
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,838
<i>and asked about her family
and her routine.</i>

791
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,091
<i>I think he did it to track her.</i>

792
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:37,482
She fits the profile
of Jung Hokyu's previous victims.

793
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,069
Let's stay alert.

794
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:44,114
Jung Hokyu will make a move soon.

795
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,491
- Donggi, mark Jung Hokyu starting today.
- Okay.

796
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:48,243
- Hyunkyung, mark the grandma.
- Okay.

797
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,916
What?

798
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,251
Let's do that.

799
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,919
- Let's go.
- Okay.

800
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:58,920
All right.

801
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:35,957
Damn it.

802
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,135
Damn.

803
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,934
What were you doing in that neighborhood?

804
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,895
It was quite far from your place.

805
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,569
TRAFFIC CRIME INVESTIGATION

806
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,533
TCI'S USED CAR FRAUD BUST

807
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:13,661
TCI BUSTS USED CAR FRAUD GROUP

808
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:15,997
TCI?

809
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:20,085
ARRESTING A USED CAR FRAUD RING

810
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,211
<i>Hurry up.</i>

811
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:25,799
<i>How much further</i>
<i>do we need to walk?</i>

812
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,176
Used car?

813
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,553
Shall we sign the contract at a cafe?

814
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,555
Drive safely.

815
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,683
That little--

816
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:53,827
Damn it!

817
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:12,720
Hey.

818
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,014
Why did you get so many things?

819
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,893
Cream bread.
And one with sweet red bean paste.

820
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,228
Close the door.

821
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,354
Sweet red bean paste bread.

822
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,064
- Red bean?
- Yes.

823
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,691
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

824
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,067
Did you see Jung Hokyu?

825
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,402
No, I didn't see him inside.

826
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,654
What did he come here to buy?

827
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:31,990
What?

828
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,533
- He's moving.
- What?

829
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:35,994
Let's go.

830
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:39,873
Let's go and get him.

831
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:49,507
Where is he going? This isn't
the way to the old lady's house.

832
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,509
No. It's the opposite direction.

833
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,559
Hold on.

834
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,706
- Lieutenant.
- He steps on the brakes differently.

835
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,833
- Jung Hokyu does it at once.
- Move the car!

836
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,668
The light changed.

837
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,003
What are you doing?

838
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,546
Who are you? Where's Jung Hokyu?

839
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,924
- Who's Jung Hokyu?
- The owner of this car!

840
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,842
I bought it today
through a direct transaction.

841
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,261
I have the contract inside the car.

842
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,765
Ms. Yoon. Please excuse me.

843
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,226
Move the car!

844
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,728
- We're sorry. We're police officers.
- Okay.

845
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:45,438
Ms. Yoon?

846
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,524
She just went inside. Why?

847
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:49,108
Jung Hokyu disappeared.

848
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,193
Disappeared?

849
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:52,403
He might go to her, so keep an eye on her.

850
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:53,488
Okay.

851
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:02,997
Which gang are you from?

852
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,291
Bring it on.

853
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,005
I won.

854
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,385
You punk!

855
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,682
Mommy!

856
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,001
CRASH

857
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,403
You little bastard.

858
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:18,531
<i>By the way, you aren't supposed to
install cameras in the car, no?</i>

859
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,117
Without a warrant,
we'll have to let him go in 48 hours.

860
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,287
- <i>He said his battery died.</i>
<i>- He suddenly asked to borrow my phone.</i>

861
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,538
He was all worked up.

862
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,333
He left the house,
got gas, and went back to his house.

863
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,752
If I cover it up,
will I also get some benefits?

864
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:31,794
Someone is coaching him.

865
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,921
<i>He asked someone next to him, right?</i>

866
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,840
Imagine the press finding out about it.

867
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,759
I'll return my ID.

868
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:40,803
Donggi will take the back,
and Hyunkyung and I'll take the front.

869
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:45,725
PEOPLE OF THE POLICE STATION

870
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:52,482
I'm sure you've had the experience

871
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:54,400
of getting into an argument

872
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,361
while passing another car or cutting.

873
01:00:57,111 --> 01:01:00,698
"Since the other car was at fault,
I could honk while chasing after itâ€¦

874
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:01,783
MIN SOHEE, TCI

875
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:04,869
â€¦and swearing a bit."
If you think lightly of the matter,

876
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:08,164
you'll run the risk of becoming
the perpetrator of retaliatory driving.

877
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:09,957
Did you know that?

878
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:15,838
By the law, a car is a dangerous property
an individual can own.

879
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:18,049
Thus, it's seen as a weapon.

880
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:22,220
So threatening or hurting another
while driving in a car

881
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:25,098
counts as aggravated intimidation
or aggravated assault

882
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,974
and can lead to severe punishment.

883
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,434
Some examples might be

884
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,813
cornering the other car so that it stops,

885
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:34,524
following the other car
with the high beams on,

886
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,442
and passing the other car

887
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,945
and hitting the brakes.

888
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:44,033
All other violent actions
that could intimidate others

889
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:47,328
count as retaliatory driving.

890
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:53,334
Such actions are aggravated intimidation,
so the perpetrator can receive

891
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:58,131
a prison sentence of seven years
or a fine of ten million won.

892
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,757
If the other person gets hurt,

893
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,885
the perpetrator can receive
a prison sentence of one to ten years.

894
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,929
It's a serious crime,

895
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:08,808
so don't do such things
even if you get extremely angry.

896
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:15,314
And if you fall victim
to retaliatory driving,

897
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,818
don't open the window,
and report it to the police right away.

898
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:24,699
To prepare yourself for such events,
don't forget to turn on the dashcam audio.

899
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:25,783
