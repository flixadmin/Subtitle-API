1
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:08,842
{\an8}<i>KDK-12, come in.</i>

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,177
<i>- KDK-12.</i>
- KDK-12.

3
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,764
<i>Hey, Bobby, need you to look in
on Mrs. Peyketewa.</i>

4
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:17,892
- She all right?
<i>- Her daughter called from California.</i>

5
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:21,229
<i>She hasn't heard from her in a while,
kind of worried.</i>

6
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,106
Will do.

7
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,161
Miss Peyketewa, hello.

8
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,124
Miss Peyketewa.

9
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:33,802
Miss Peyketewa.

10
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:17,864
KDK-12 here.
Janet, Jesus, we got a homicide.

11
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,074
<i>- Come again?</i>
- Miss Peyketewa, she's dead.

12
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,328
- I need some backup out here.
<i>- Okay. On their way.</i>

13
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,753
Whoever's in there,
show yourself right now!

14
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,556
Hold it right there.

15
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,058
Let me see your hands.

16
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,267
Hands!

17
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,813
All right, down.

18
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,315
On your knees.

19
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,400
You understand me?

20
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,945
Do you speak English?

21
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,033
I said, down. On your knees.

22
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,785
Down!

23
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,373
Damn it, get down.

24
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,791
On your knees.

25
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,251
Do it.

26
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,755
On your knees or I'll fire!

27
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,551
- Yeah?
<i>- I found the papers.</i>

28
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,013
<i>Right where you left them, in the crib.</i>

29
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,098
Yeah, well...

30
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,643
{\an8}You know best, right?

31
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,604
Anything else?

32
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,397
Do you have any thought

33
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:20,194
{\an8}about how we're going
to approach this with Walter Jr.?

34
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,071
<i>Well, he's still my son.</i>

35
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,282
<i>- I mean, he will remain...</i>
- Of course.

36
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,660
<i>My point being</i>

37
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,121
the divorce.

38
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,709
<i>Well, I...</i>

39
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,837
{\an8}I think he gets it, don't you?

40
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,965
{\an8}I mean, I...

41
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:43,551
{\an8}I think he saw it coming.

42
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,845
{\an8}He sees your unhappiness and...

43
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,847
{\an8}<i>My unhappiness?</i>

44
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,141
{\an8}<i>My completely out-of-the-clear</i>

45
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:55,438
blue-sky unhappiness?

46
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,273
{\an8}<i>Really?</i>

47
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,568
{\an8}Look, as you said, for the best.

48
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,111
Yeah.

49
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,946
Okay.

50
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,575
Last thing and then I'll let you go.

51
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:12,789
{\an8}<i>In the child-support worksheet,
you list medical, dental</i>

52
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:19,169
{\an8}child care, transportation, housing,
education, food, clothing.

53
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,838
That's right, all of it.

54
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,425
{\an8}Walt.

55
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,971
{\an8}- No.
<i>- Skyler, you wanted me out</i>

56
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,974
I'm out,
but I will provide for my family.

57
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,227
<i>Not with that money.</i>

58
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,480
You'd be making us accessories
after the fact.

59
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,359
{\an8}How do you think we've been paying
our bills these last six months?

60
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,323
I have to go.

61
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:49,575
{\an8}Yep, I was right.

62
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,245
{\an8}Three units available,
exact same floor plan.

63
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,289
{\an8}I can call over, get you in
to see any of the others.

64
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,125
{\an8}No, no, this one's fine.

65
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,460
I'll take it.

66
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:05,967
Now, unfortunately,
this one is the model, so...

67
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,635
Yeah, I like it.

68
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,637
{\an8}I like everything about it.

69
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,807
{\an8}I'll take it as-is.

70
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,355
{\an8}Name one thing in this world
that is not negotiable.

71
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,157
- You have to clean the fryer.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,454
We try to clean them every night,

73
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,499
{\an8}but make sure it's off
before you open the intake valve.

74
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,837
{\an8}Good. Now, I suggest that you add this
to your Monday maintenance schedule.

75
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:45,506
Yes, sir. Now, select freezing mode

76
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:49,719
{\an8}clock button off, press and hold
auto-control until it beeps.

77
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,721
Main valve on, main switch on.

78
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,308
Give the compressor time
for the needle to enter the green.

79
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,488
{\an8}Yo, for real?

80
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,073
{\an8}- This is all you?
- All me.

81
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,409
Heisenberg who? That's what I say.

82
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,578
My man Jesse can cook.

83
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,539
Check it, yo.
It ain't cloudy or dirty or nothing.

84
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,042
- Just the right shade of blue.
- Good shade.

85
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,212
Check out that crystal size.
If that bitch was any bigger

86
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,381
- it would be a Jolly Rancher.
- Be my guest.

87
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,553
You sure?

88
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,932
I feel kind of dickish
with you being in rehab and all.

89
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,560
{\an8}No. I can watch, yo.

90
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:43,022
{\an8}- I can cook and I can watch.
- Go for it.

91
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,358
I tried it last week.
I'm still coming down.

92
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,735
Go easy.

93
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,404
Okay.

94
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,215
<i>Riverdance.</i>

95
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,426
Hey, hey, stop marking up my floor,
dumb-ass. Come on.

96
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,558
Bow before me.

97
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:22,436
I am Lord of the Dance.

98
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,939
{\an8}Shit.

99
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,607
{\an8}I gotta try that again.

100
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,693
Yeah, no, I think you're good.

101
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,445
That is awesome, Jesse.

102
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:36,826
I feel like somebody took my brain out
and boiled it in, like, boiling hot...

103
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,120
It's the bomb, man, seriously.

104
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,455
Like anthrax.

105
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,958
Good.

106
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,918
So

107
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,254
You ready to talk some business?

108
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,426
{\an8}You mean this is not, like,
just recreational?

109
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,096
{\an8}I know

110
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,181
{\an8}what you're thinking.

111
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,643
{\an8}Trust me, it's not gonna be like it was.

112
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,438
{\an8}All right, never gonna be like it was.

113
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,982
- How's that?
- We sell it safe.

114
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,359
{\an8}All right? We sell it smart.

115
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,821
{\an8}We don't get greedy, like before.

116
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,490
I don't know, man.

117
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,492
Combo and all.

118
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,336
Still

119
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,005
man's gotta make his living.

120
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:36,052
{\an8}If it's like Jesse says
and we're not greedy...

121
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,845
{\an8}I mean

122
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,889
{\an8}I guess I can see it.

123
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,225
{\an8}Had a good thing going
before we started pushing our luck.

124
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,812
{\an8}- If it can go back to being like that...
- Hey, it will be.

125
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,398
{\an8}Step one, we build inventory.

126
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,025
{\an8}Badger, go see Clovis.

127
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:55,696
{\an8}Get the RV in shape, tune-up,
oil change, brake lights, and whatnot.

128
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:59,575
{\an8}Cops always pull you over
for brake lights. Not us.

129
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:00,868
{\an8}Cautious.

130
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,235
- Right on.
- You got it.

131
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:06,874
You know that buzzer thing?
Leave the key in the ignition, it buzzes?

132
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:10,044
{\an8}Just have him put in one of those too.

133
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,546
{\an8}Skinny, you're in charge of supplies.

134
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,757
I'll get you a list.

135
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,425
Right on.

136
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,386
Yeah?

137
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,888
- Yeah.
- All right.

138
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,517
So

139
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,268
- We good?
- Yeah.

140
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,520
Good?

141
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,064
- All right.
- Let's do this thing.

142
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,248
Brandon Mayhew.

143
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,458
I know you.

144
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,587
Small world, Albuquerque.

145
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,611
Wanna talk about it?

146
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:01,031
Why? It's not like I get a vote.

147
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,826
You know, ironically

148
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:09,206
I think you're gonna see
much more of me from now on.

149
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,457
Sure.

150
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,168
Well, just as much of me at least.

151
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,213
I'm taking you to the school,
to and from, every day.

152
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,840
What, I don't get a vote in this either?

153
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:23,010
I gotta stop going with Louis
just because you're feeling guilty?

154
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,641
I do feel guilty.

155
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,440
I am the man that I am, son,

156
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:39,945
and there's plenty
that I would change about that, but...

157
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:47,202
Here we are, and this is just what it is.

158
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,501
You know what? Call me crazy,

159
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:59,381
but I'm actually feeling very good
about the future.

160
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,417
Morning.

161
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,085
They're back.

162
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,757
I'm wondering if we should
maybe call the police or something.

163
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,384
Why?

164
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,720
They're doing nothing wrong.

165
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:54,811
Okay, let's put this on Table 33, okay?

166
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,022
Hello there.

167
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,192
Mr. White, I presume?

168
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,403
Oh, yes. Hi.

169
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,029
I...

170
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:31,324
Sorry. I'll be right down.

171
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,837
- Hi. Gale Boetticher.
- Hi.

172
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,550
You're my new lab assistant, I take it.

173
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:49,759
Yes, I am.

174
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,387
I suppose you'll wanna hear
my qualifications.

175
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:55,181
I have my résumé here for you.

176
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,228
I received my bachelor's degree from UNM.

177
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:03,064
My master's
from the University of Colorado.

178
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,693
Organic chemistry with a specialty in...

179
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,570
It's all right there.

180
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:12,031
"X-ray crystallography."

181
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,241
Really?

182
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,079
I could talk about that for hours.

183
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,581
I would love to.

184
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:23,376
But first, I'm curious about this.

185
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:29,382
That's a little pet project of mine.

186
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:34,471
See, in my opinion,
it's all about the quinic acid level.

187
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,600
You want just north of 4800 milligrams
per liter,

188
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:42,312
but if you over-boil to get there,
you'll leach your tannins.

189
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,731
Bitterness, yuck.

190
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,275
So I pull a mild vacuum.

191
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:52,739
That way, I can keep the temperature
no higher than 92 C and...

192
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,913
Judge for yourself.

193
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,803
Oh, my God.

194
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:26,147
My God, that is the best coffee
I've ever tasted.

195
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,651
Sumatran beans,

196
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:33,112
and I also have to give credit
to the grind,

197
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,990
- but thank you, Mr. White.
- Walt.

198
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,243
Please, call me Walt.

199
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,746
Why the hell are we making meth?

200
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,859
Hey.

201
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,569
Tell me

202
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:57,280
with the phenylacetic acid solution

203
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:02,076
you said 150 drops per minute
for the first 10 minutes,

204
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:05,914
and then 90 for the remainder.
Why is that?

205
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,960
Well, my thinking is,
by tapering the phenyl

206
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,756
you get an oilier aqueous layer,
and hence...

207
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:16,591
Better benzene extraction.

208
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,427
Exactly.

209
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,971
But actually, I prefer ether.

210
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,932
Oh, I'll have it for tomorrow.

211
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:34,734
Gale, I'm wondering how you...

212
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,778
Ended up here.

213
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:43,284
Well, actually, I'm still wondering
how I ended up here, but, yes.

214
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:48,456
I mean, I can't imagine
we strike each other as criminals.

215
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:54,629
Well, there's crime
and then there's crime

216
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,798
I suppose.

217
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,800
I'm definitely a libertarian.

218
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,844
Consenting adults want what they want,

219
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:05,515
and if I'm not supplying it,
they will get it somewhere else.

220
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,476
With me, they're getting exactly
what they pay for.

221
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:12,438
No added toxins or adulterants.

222
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:17,443
Yeah, I was doing it
the way you are supposed to

223
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,489
pursuing my doctorate at Colorado,
NSF research grant.

224
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:24,367
I was on my way, jumping through hoops

225
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,452
kissing the proper behinds

226
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:32,000
attending to all the non-chemistry
that one finds oneself occupied by.

227
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,668
You know that world.

228
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:37,714
That is not what I signed on for.

229
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:43,845
I love the lab.

230
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,473
Because it's all still magic.

231
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,683
You know?

232
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,520
Chemistry?

233
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,189
I mean

234
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,525
once you lose that...

235
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:58,860
It is.

236
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,529
It is magic.

237
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,865
It still is.

238
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:09,746
And all the while, I kept thinking
about that great old Whitman poem:

239
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,875
"When I Heard
the Learn'd Astronomer."

240
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:16,377
I don't know it.

241
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:17,879
Anyway...

242
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,381
Well, can you recite it?

243
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,928
Pathetically enough, I could.

244
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,222
All right, well...

245
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,850
No, no, come on. Come on.

246
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,101
Yeah?

247
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,984
<i>When I heard the learn'd astronomer</i>

248
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:45,865
<i>When the proofs, the figures
Were ranged in columns before me</i>

249
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,743
<i>When I was shown the charts
And the diagrams</i>

250
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,578
<i>To add, divide, and measure them</i>

251
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,956
<i>When I, sitting Heard the astronomer</i>

252
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:59,045
<i>Where he lectured with much
Applause In the lecture-room</i>

253
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:04,926
<i>How soon, unaccountable
I became tired and sick</i>

254
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,386
<i>Till rising and gliding out</i>

255
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,596
<i>I wander'd off by myself</i>

256
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:13,600
<i>In the mystical moist night-air</i>

257
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,520
<i>And from time to time</i>

258
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:20,274
<i>Look'd up in perfect silence At the stars</i>

259
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,783
Yes.

260
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:30,617
I am a nerd.

261
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:36,332
- Bravo.
- Thank you.

262
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,795
Come on, Pinkman.

263
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,005
You little rat bastard.

264
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:46,467
Get off your lazy ass
and go break the law.

265
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,881
- Hey, baby.
<i>- Are you ever coming home?</i>

266
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,382
Marie, I'm working.

267
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:28,342
Did you find it? The RV?

268
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,219
<i>No. Working on it, so...</i>

269
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:35,516
Why can't you just arrest him,
make him tell you?

270
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,561
<i>It's not simple. There's a thing
called the Constitution.</i>

271
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:41,898
Constitution, blah, blah, blah.

272
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:48,404
<i>This kid, I swear to God,
I wish I just could...</i>

273
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:51,698
This is that Pinkman character?

274
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,034
<i>That's the one.</i>

275
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:55,411
<i>Positive the little bastard's got an RV.</i>

276
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,830
I just don't know where he keeps it.

277
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:01,584
Until he actually leads me to it
or does something

278
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:05,588
I'm stuck here, Marie, so sorry.

279
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:09,550
Well, not to bring up ancient history,

280
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:14,639
but I, for one, can think of someone
who might know something.

281
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,891
Possibly.

282
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:18,434
It's worth a shot.

283
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:20,394
Yeah?

284
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,397
Who?

285
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,070
- Hello.
<i>- Oh, hey, buddy.</i>

286
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:30,446
<i>Hey, how you doing?</i>

287
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:32,365
Oh, hey, Hank. What's up?

288
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,450
<i>Listen, I hate to bother you.</i>

289
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:37,578
<i>- I just had a quick question.</i>
- Shoot.

290
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:41,916
I only ask this because I'm at a,
you know, dead end here, potentially.

291
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,418
I'm working a case and...

292
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:50,883
You know that I would never put you
on the spot or make you uncomfortable.

293
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,719
Hank, you could just cut to the chase.

294
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:58,599
Back when we lost you
and I was trying to track you down

295
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,810
<i>through your student, Jesse Pinkman.</i>

296
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:04,897
Now, you know that I know
that once upon a time

297
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,316
he may have dealt you a little weed.

298
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:08,775
- Hank...
<i>- Just a little.</i>

299
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:11,570
<i>And I so do not care about that.</i>

300
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,948
As far as I'm concerned,
you never inhaled.

301
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:15,782
<i>Like you said, cut to the chase.</i>

302
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:21,330
<i>Do you remember
if this Pinkman kid ever had an RV?</i>

303
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,585
<i>You know, a recreational vehicle</i>

304
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:31,257
you know, like a Winnebago-type
deal, brown and beige?

305
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,136
Why?

306
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:39,265
<i>Long story, but I'm personally of the
opinion he's moved on from weed,</i>

307
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:45,313
<i>and graduated to selling
crystal meth, using it as a rolling lab.</i>

308
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:51,944
Walt?

309
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,045
Yo.

310
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,677
What, Mr. White?

311
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,028
<i>How's my favorite genius?</i>

312
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,905
Is this a secure line?

313
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,825
<i>Is this a secure...?
Yes, what's with the...?</i>

314
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,326
Hey, hello to you too.

315
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,037
Listen, we've got a problem,
a DEA problem.

316
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,997
- I'm listening.
<i>- My brother-in-law</i>

317
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,041
<i>he knows about the RV.</i>

318
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,250
What RV?

319
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:50,669
Our RV

320
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:55,090
the one which contains a meth lab,
which is covered with my fingerprints.

321
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:58,886
What does "knows about" mean?
Does he have it? Has he searched it?

322
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,847
No, he knows it exists
and he's trying to find it.

323
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:06,059
<i>He has linked it to Jesse. It's a matter
of time before he tracks it down.</i>

324
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,896
<i>So get rid of it!
What are you doing sitting there?</i>

325
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:12,608
Better yet, have Pinkman get rid of it.
Right? You don't go near it.

326
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,694
My brother-in-law,
he is surveilling Jesse's house.

327
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:19,198
So he might have tapped the phones
or bugged his house.

328
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,701
Jesus. Plan A, then.
Go. Get to it before the feds do.

329
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:26,038
And do what exactly?

330
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,748
I mean, what...?

331
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:32,127
The thing is the size of a...

332
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:33,629
It's RV-size.

333
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,423
<i>I mean, where do I go
to make an RV disappear?</i>

334
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,050
I'm not David Copperfield.

335
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,928
What do I look like,
the RV disposal people?

336
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,430
- Did you not plan for this contingency?
- No.

337
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,933
Well, next time, plan for it, would you?

338
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,811
The <i>Starship Enterprise</i>
had a self-destruct button.

339
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,104
Okay. Shut up.

340
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,274
I'm just saying,
you're good with tools and all.

341
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:59,780
Why don't you invent
a water-powered car, you know?

342
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,991
You did that, you would be rolling in it.

343
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,452
Socket wrench.

344
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,454
The big one.

345
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:12,584
What? You scared of the Arabs?

346
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,890
You out of your minds?
Why is this in the open?

347
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,178
- Who the hell are you?
- He's Heisenberg.

348
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,805
- Is this drivable?
- Yeah. I was changing the oil.

349
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:29,142
Finish it. We'll wipe it clean,
take it out to the desert.

350
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,644
Come on, help me.

351
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,980
Hold up. What's this about?

352
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,483
The DEA,
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

353
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,850
You've heard of them, right?
I know you have.

354
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:43,198
They know all about this RV
and they're trying to find it right now.

355
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,883
I want this off my property now.

356
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,370
No, no, we have got
to destroy the evidence.

357
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:52,165
- We've gotta rig this thing to burn.
- Not here. Get it out of here.

358
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,626
Now, listen to me.
I need your help, okay?

359
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,046
If I go down, we all go down.
Do you understand?

360
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,049
All right, just...

361
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:05,053
I know a way. I know a guy that'll
wipe this off the planet, no questions.

362
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,513
Call him.

363
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,229
Hey, what about Jesse?

364
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:15,522
What about him?

365
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:29,202
Hey, it's me.
Wanna hear something weird?

366
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,372
Now, listen to me.
You get that address.

367
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:36,877
Now, Badger, I don't care how.
You find out where he's taking it.

368
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,507
Oh, yeah.

369
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,612
Excuse me. Are you leaving?

370
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:21,296
Excuse me, gentlemen, these booths
are for paying customers only.

371
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:25,759
Cynthia, it's okay. I'll handle this.

372
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:05,757
Ninety-six, 97, 98, 99, 100.

373
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,968
Beyond recovery, right?

374
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:11,304
- Beyond recovery means...
- I got it. Beyond recovery.

375
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,932
- Obliterated, no evidence.
- Hey, don't worry.

376
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:17,144
When we're through with it,
it's gonna be about yay big.

377
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,981
Then we flatbed it over to Long Beach,
ship it across the Pacific.

378
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:24,484
Chinese turn it into patio furniture,

379
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,987
so mind at ease.

380
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:30,657
Listen, can you do me a favor?
I'm obviously gonna need a ride.

381
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:33,868
- Could you call a cab?
- You got it. Pleasure doing business.

382
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,330
Thank you. I'll be right behind you.
I just need to...

383
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:18,079
- The hell you think you're doing?
- Me?

384
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:21,333
This is mine just as much as yours.
You don't get to just...

385
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,543
- Oh, God.
- What?

386
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,842
What?

387
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,011
He's here.

388
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,930
Who's here?

389
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,394
Oh, no.

390
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,067
Oh, God.

391
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,401
Oh, God.

392
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,071
You led him right to us.

393
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,812
Shit.

394
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:13,528
Shit.

395
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,198
Jesse Pinkman,
you wanna add resisting arrest?

396
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:19,368
We'll add it. No skin off my ass.

397
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:23,121
Last chance to do it the easy way.

398
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,830
Got a warrant?

399
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:09,418
Who are you, huh? Who are you
and what do you know about this RV?

400
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,712
Well, I'm the owner of this lot

401
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:15,257
which means you're trespassing
on private property.

402
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:18,260
As far as the RV goes,
seems to me it's locked

403
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:23,306
which means you're trying to break
and enter, so again, you got a warrant?

404
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:28,103
Well, I don't need one
if I've got probable cause, counselor.

405
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:32,107
Probable cause usually relates
to vehicles, is my understanding.

406
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,735
You know, traffic stops and whatnot.

407
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,571
See these round rubber things?

408
00:36:37,738 --> 00:36:39,072
Those are wheels.

409
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,741
This is a vehicle.

410
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,578
This is a domicile, a residence

411
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,708
protected by the Fourth Amendment
from unlawful search and seizure.

412
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,919
- Why don't you just go out...?
- Did you see this drive?

413
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:54,421
How do you know it runs?

414
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:57,466
Did you actually witness any wrongdoing?

415
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:01,595
It seems to me
you're just out here fishing.

416
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:06,433
Don't see that holding up
in a court of law.

417
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,978
Oh, yeah?

418
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,647
Look at these.

419
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:20,071
What do those look like to you?
They sure look like bullet holes to me.

420
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:24,659
There was a firearm discharged
inside of this domicile.

421
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:28,747
There's a judge or two out there
who'd see that as probable cause.

422
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,464
Call the Albuquerque police...

423
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:35,837
How could you have known they were
there before you took off the tape?

424
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,088
What?

425
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:41,259
How could you have known they were
there before you took off the tape?

426
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:43,345
Say it. Say it.

427
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:47,056
...DEA operation, there's 20 guys
rushing in here like the wrath of God.

428
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,811
How could you have known they were
there before you took off the tape?

429
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,270
That's right.

430
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,148
Probable cause
needs to be readily apparent.

431
00:37:57,818 --> 00:37:59,945
There's somebody in there.

432
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:04,491
"Private domicile
and I won't be harassed."

433
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:09,329
I'll give you three seconds
to get your ass out here. One, two...

434
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:13,500
This is my own private domicile
and I will not be harassed.

435
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,627
Bitch.

436
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,472
Fine. You want your warrant?

437
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:34,229
I'll have my guys bring it and deliver it
on a little satin pillow. How's that?

438
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:38,859
I waited this long.
I'll wait a little longer.

439
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:00,922
Hey, Vicky.

440
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:03,675
Yeah, Schrader.
Get me Merkert, will you?

441
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:16,396
You know, I say...

442
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,523
I say we just ram him.

443
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,191
All right?

444
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,028
I mean, we... We...

445
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:27,574
We start her up
and just ram the shit out of his truck.

446
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:30,368
We make our escape. Right?

447
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,252
Yeah, he'd shoot me in the head.

448
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,590
Yeah, he'd shoot me in the head.

449
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:47,093
So, what do we do, man, huh?

450
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,888
What do we...? What?

451
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:56,019
Please, tell me you got something.

452
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,610
Yeah, I got something.

453
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,165
It's me.

454
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,960
We need your help.

455
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:43,483
Yeah.

456
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,361
<i>Is this Mr. Henry R. Schrader?</i>

457
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:47,946
Yeah. Who's this?

458
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:51,533
<i>Sir, this is Officer Elaine Tanner
with the Albuquerque police.</i>

459
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,451
<i>Is your wife Marie Schrader?</i>

460
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,495
Yes, why?

461
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:58,962
<i>I'm sorry to inform you your wife's
been in an automobile accident.</i>

462
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:01,732
<i>She's being airlifted
to Los Ranchos Medical Center,</i>

463
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:04,212
<i>and should be arriving there shortly.</i>

464
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:11,636
- How is she? What's her condition?
<i>- I don't have the current information.</i>

465
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,806
<i>But I think you might wanna get there
as soon as possible.</i>

466
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,810
You're gonna have to
start paying me more.

467
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,036
- Marie?
<i>- I'm just checking in.</i>

468
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:21,956
<i>I'd love to have some idea of whether
I should cook dinner or not.</i>

469
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:25,418
- Are you okay?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

470
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,170
<i>Why?</i>

471
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,674
<i>Hank?</i>

472
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,052
<i>What's up?</i>
