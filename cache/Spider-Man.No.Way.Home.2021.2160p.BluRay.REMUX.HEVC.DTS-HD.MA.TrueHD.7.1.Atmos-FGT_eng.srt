1
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:06,548
We come to you now with revelations
about last week's attack in London.

2
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:08,717
An anonymous source provided this video.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,597
It shows Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio,
moments before his death.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,891
You may find this video disturbing.

5
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,952
I managed to send the Elemental
back through the rift,

6
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,038
but I don't think
I'm gonna make it off this bridge alive.

7
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:21,730
Spider-Man attacked me.

8
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,316
He has an army of drones,
Stark technology.

9
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,070
He's saying he's the only one who's
gonna be the new Iron Man. No one else.

10
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,405
Are you sure you want
to commence the drone attack?

11
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:32,366
There will be significant casualties.

12
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,326
Do it. Execute them all.

13
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,667
This shocking video was released
earlier today

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,753
on the controversial news website
The Daily Bugle.net.

15
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,838
There you have it, folks: Conclusive proof

16
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:51,176
that Spider-Man was responsible
for the brutal murder of Mysterio,

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,680
an interdimensional warrior
who gave his life to protect our planet

18
00:00:54,763 --> 00:01:00,310
and who will, no doubt, go down in history
as the greatest superhero of all time.

19
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,604
But that's not all, folks.

20
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,106
Here's the real blockbuster.

21
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,899
Brace yourselves.
You might wanna sit down.

22
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:08,277
Spider-Man's real--
Spider-Man's real name is--

23
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:13,448
Spider-Man's name is Peter Parker.

24
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,867
What the fuck?

25
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,704
That's right, folks. Peter Parker.

26
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,582
A 17-year-old high school delinquent...

27
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,334
- She knows him.
- Are you Spider-Man's girlfriend?

28
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,294
...is, in fact...

29
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:29,172
- Are you Spider-Man's girlfriend?
- ...the vile vigilante villain Spider-Man.

30
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,507
Yo, it's him.

31
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,427
- Please don't touch her, sir.
- You're just a kid?

32
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,137
You murdered Mysterio?

33
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,638
- You helped him?
- No, I didn't--

34
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,807
Come on, kid, let me see your face.

35
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,642
- He hit me. Spider-Man hit me.
- Come on.

36
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:41,560
He hit me.

37
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:45,147
All this time, people looked up
to this boy and called him a hero.

38
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,817
Well, I'll tell you what I call him,
public enemy number one.

39
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,570
I told you
I never wanted to do this ever again!

40
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,990
MJ, I'm so sorry, but I can't see anything
with your hand in my--

41
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,617
Sorry. Where are we gonna go?

42
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,493
- I don't know. Your house?
- No!

43
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,120
My dad will kill you.

44
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,997
What? You said your dad really liked me.

45
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,832
Yeah, well, not anymore.

46
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,377
- Dude.
- Dude.

47
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:08,712
- Dude.
- Dude.

48
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,796
Dude!

49
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,923
- Dude!
- Dude!

50
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,885
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

51
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,928
- No, not really.
- Yo, Peter!

52
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,064
We should go. We should go. Come on.

53
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,334
- You said you don't want to swing.
- You should just swing me.

54
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:30,901
- Okay. We can take the subway.
- Okay.

55
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,030
No.

56
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:42,954
Look out!

57
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,341
That was so much worse. Okay. It's okay.

58
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,677
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,846
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, I'm so sorry.

60
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,148
Okay.

61
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,608
Okay.

62
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,111
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,949
I just feel so dumb.
I didn't realize you were miserable.

64
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,411
No, it was really fun, right?
That's why they call it a fling.

65
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:26,123
- And we flung.
- It was fun. I could've been more fun.

66
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,625
- We'll hang out again.
- Like, when do you think?

67
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,172
- I should see what that is.
- No, no, no.

68
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,925
- It's what I do. Peter?
- He's always coming and going.

69
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:37,926
- Peter?
- Oh, no.

70
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:38,885
- Oh, God.
- Oh, no.

71
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,637
- Peter? Peter?
- I don't know what to do.

72
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,434
- I didn't see anything.
- This isn't what it looks like.

73
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,227
- No, no, no, May.
- Practice safe--

74
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,063
Oh, hey. You must be MJ.

75
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,816
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

76
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,569
- Wait, have you been crying?
- We broke up.

77
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,822
Hey, Spider-Man!

78
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,159
Thank you. I didn't know you broke up.

79
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,203
I thought you were in love, May.
Can we talk about this in the kitchen?

80
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,830
I should probably leave.

81
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,874
I thought you guys were
such a handsome couple.

82
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,042
It's really about boundaries.

83
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,462
- Let me answer the door.
- Let's go in here.

84
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,046
- Is that the door?
- Hey. Is it true?

85
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,048
- I was gonna go, but...
- Not now.

86
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:20,093
I didn't know you were
so awkward about sex, Peter.

87
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,095
This has nothing to do with sex.

88
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:25,056
If you wanna go over it again.
I mean-- What's that sound?

89
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,894
- Hey, Spider-Man!
- Oh, my God.

90
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:32,439
I mean, I'm happy to rehash it
if you want to.

91
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,192
You take care of your side,
I'll take care of mine.

92
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,029
What is up with this phone?

93
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,031
Will you get off your phones
for five minutes?

94
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,408
I just wanna talk to you
about your relationship, okay?

95
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,492
Peter?

96
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,537
What?

97
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,750
- Is that--?
- Is that here?

98
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,142
- Yo, Peter Parker!
- Yo, Peter!

99
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,186
Maybe it's not such a big deal.

100
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,395
Spider-Menace!

101
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,649
Governments around the world
launch investigations

102
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:19,861
into the murderer known as Spider-Man,
aka Peter Parker,

103
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,781
aka the web-headed war criminal

104
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:27,244
who, for years, has been terrorizing
the decent citizens of New York.

105
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,997
Well, now this city and the world see him
for what he truly is.

106
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,166
Murderer! Mysterio forever!

107
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,379
New details from last week's
devastating attack in London have emerged.

108
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,173
For more, we go now
to Joint Intelligence headquarters.

109
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,926
Authorities,
just a short while ago, confirmed

110
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,262
that the deadly drones used
in the London attack

111
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,639
were designed by Stark Industries.

112
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,641
Federal agents! Open up!

113
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,518
Federal agents? You stay here.

114
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,812
Department of Damage Control.

115
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,790
We have a warrant
for the arrest of Peter Parker.

116
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,399
- You know the Fourth Amendment?
- Sure.

117
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:00,235
- Unreasonable search and seizure?
- Get in here, guys. Let's go.

118
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,864
I didn't kill Quentin Beck.
The drones did, okay?

119
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,782
- The drones that are yours.
- No.

120
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,159
Nick Fury was there the entire time.

121
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,953
He can explain everything.

122
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,831
Nick Fury has been off-planet
for the last year.

123
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,791
- What?
- Peter! Hey.

124
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,003
MJ! They have nothing
to do with this, sir.

125
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,171
Don't say anything without a lawyer.

126
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,798
I want a lawyer.

127
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,843
- Ms. Jones-Watson.
- Jones. I don't go by Watson.

128
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,180
- Ms. Jones, why do you want a lawyer if--?
- If I have nothing to hide?

129
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,350
- Exactly. Unless--
- I'm actually guilty of something?

130
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,686
I'm very aware of your tactics
and my rights.

131
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,230
Just answer my questions.

132
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,024
I've seen your file.

133
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,027
You're a smart young woman
with a bright future ahead of her.

134
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,862
Why would you risk it all

135
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,324
by getting involved
with a vigilante like Peter Parker?

136
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,535
So sorry to keep you waiting.

137
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,162
- Can we get Ned a shack?
- Absolutely.

138
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,538
- He's been waiting.
- I got you.

139
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,248
Dude, I'm so sorry about that.

140
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,627
- I'm not supposed to say anything to you.
- Not even a thing.

141
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,589
I just have one question.
When MJ told you Peter was Spider-Man--

142
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,967
- What's up?
- I knew way before MJ did.

143
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,553
- I was Spider-Man's "guy in the chair."
- I know about those.

144
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,889
- Dude, half my guys are guys in the chair.
- Exactly.

145
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,351
You would know.
I literally helped him find the Vulture.

146
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,686
- I didn't know that.
- I helped him hack a suit once

147
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,229
and helped him get to space.

148
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:22,442
So in Spider-Man's illegal vigilantism,
you were his main accomplice.

149
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,490
I would like to have
my words stricken from the record.

150
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:32,118
With all due respect,
and I mean that very insincerely,

151
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,288
unless you have
some real specific charges to throw at us,

152
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,832
legally, you can't hold us here.

153
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,543
- You should definitely lawyer up.
- Excuse me?

154
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,754
Child endangerment's a nasty rap.

155
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,589
A boy was entrusted to you,

156
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,050
and as his legal guardian,
essentially his mother,

157
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,096
you not only allowed him
to endanger himself, you encouraged it.

158
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,847
Who does that?

159
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,933
I wanna see Peter right now.

160
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,602
Stark Industries was caught in the web

161
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,480
of the Spider-Man/Mysterio
controversy today,

162
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,066
when federal agents opened
an investigation

163
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,735
into missing Stark technology.

164
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,446
Agents wanna know
exactly what was taken...

165
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,741
- At least they used a good picture.
- What is happening?

166
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,662
That's great.

167
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,746
Thank you.

168
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,540
I have some good news, Peter.

169
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,251
I don't believe any of the charges
against you are gonna stick.

170
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,585
Wait, seriously?

171
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,712
- I knew it.
- Nice.

172
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,380
Mr. Murdock, thank you.

173
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,132
- Thank you.
- That's amazing.

174
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,299
- You're welcome.
- Perfect.

175
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,468
- However, Mr. Hogan...
- Yes?

176
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,763
...the feds are investigating
that missing technology.

177
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,182
I understand your loyalty
to Mr. Stark and his legacy,

178
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,642
but if you were involved--

179
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,477
- If was?
- I advise securing a lawyer.

180
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,605
I need a lawyer because I'm--?
I thought he was--

181
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,859
You said there's no charge.
I could say under advisement of counsel,

182
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,986
I refuse to answer
the question respectfully

183
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,030
because the answer can incriminate me--

184
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,615
It's in Goodfellas. What's the thing
they say in Goodfellas?

185
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,952
I know that's what you think. Calm down.
Let's hear what he has to say. Matt?

186
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,871
You're gonna need a really good lawyer.

187
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,375
You may have dodged your legal troubles,
but things will get much worse.

188
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,335
There is still the court
of public opinion.

189
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,340
Murderer! Mysterio forever!

190
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,303
How did you just do that?

191
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,722
I'm a really good lawyer.

192
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,684
We'll need a safer place to live.

193
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,990
How do we--? How do we--?

194
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,867
Alarm system deactivated.

195
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,289
It looks nice. And this is safe.

196
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,420
Welcome to the spiritual oasis.

197
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,589
You like Donkey Kong Jr.?

198
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,927
Nicky, from Jersey City,
you're on the line.

199
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,679
Hi. I'm not saying
I don't want to honor the Avengers,

200
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,140
but, you know, not doing it this way.

201
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,477
Putting the Captain America shield
on the Statue of Liberty?

202
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,395
Nah, that will look ridiculous.

203
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,523
Leave the Statue of Liberty alone.

204
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,650
Oh, Happy.

205
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,403
- Did you send in your applications yet?
- I finished my MIT one.

206
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,488
- You?
- Same.

207
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,365
Can you imagine
if we both got in? And Ned?

208
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:19,327
Yeah, but we'd have to get scholarships,
so we could actually go.

209
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,704
You got the scores and the grades.

210
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,248
You think I'm being too pragmatic.

211
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,749
No, no, no. Well...

212
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,586
Kind of. It's okay.
It's one of my favorite things about you.

213
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,963
- Really?
- Yeah.

214
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,881
What are your other favorite things?

215
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:35,885
- Your relentless optimism.
- I'm a glass-half-full kind of gal.

216
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,596
- I really like how you're a people person.
- I love people.

217
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,141
- I love them so much.
- You like sports.

218
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,393
I think the Mets are gonna go
all the way this year.

219
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,562
- Really?
- What's that noise?

220
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,648
It's-- It's Happy. Look.

221
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,568
Gave his room to May,
so he's sleeping down here.

222
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,157
I have a weird question.

223
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,411
Does any part of you
feel relieved about this?

224
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,125
Ever since I got bit by that spider...

225
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,297
I've only had one week
where my life has felt normal.

226
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,841
Or kind of normal, I guess.

227
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,383
And...

228
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,262
that was when you found out.

229
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:23,975
Because then everyone that was in my life
that I wanted to know knew.

230
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,101
And it was perfect.

231
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,270
But now everybody knows and...

232
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,483
I am the most famous person
in the entire world.

233
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,153
And I'm still broke.

234
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,240
I'm...

235
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,077
excited to see you tomorrow.

236
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,456
Yeah. Me too.

237
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,790
Wrap it up.

238
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,959
You both like each other.
We get it. Hang up.

239
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,545
There's no new ground being broken.
I need my eight hours.

240
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,131
- Have you been listening this whole time?
- Hi, Happy.

241
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,216
Not by choice.

242
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,509
- MJ says hi.
- Hello.

243
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,887
We're covering
the first day of senior year

244
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,348
for Midtown High's most famous student,

245
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,807
Peter Parker.

246
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:08,436
Go get them, tiger!
Or should I say "spider"?

247
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,981
The crowd has continued
to grow here all morning long

248
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,067
at the Midtown School of Science...

249
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:18,112
The crowd seems evenly divided
between supporters of Spider-Man

250
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,197
and protestors.

251
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,990
MJ!

252
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,326
MJ! MJ! We love you!

253
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,828
MJ, are you gonna have his spider-babies?

254
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,997
Back up. Back up. Back up!

255
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,209
MJ, you know he's a murderer, right?

256
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,919
Peter, do a TikTok with me.

257
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,046
Mysterio forever!

258
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,172
Do a flip!

259
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,841
- Hey, let's see you and MJ kiss!
- Back off.

260
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,093
Who are you?

261
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,905
- Ned Leeds. Spider-Man's best friend.
- I'm Peter Parker's best friend.

262
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,515
You come at my boy,
you come at Flash Thompson.

263
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,642
If you wanna read
about our inspiring friendship,

264
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,811
you can in my new book, Flashpoint.

265
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,605
One spider, two hearts,
a million crazy-ass memories.

266
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:53,940
Check it out.

267
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,152
- Go.
- No, I gotta wait--

268
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,571
- No. Go.
- I'll see you inside, okay?

269
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,450
Keep watching Midtown News all year

270
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,536
as we bring you up close
and personal coverage

271
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,706
of Peter fighting his biggest battle yet:

272
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,332
College admissions.

273
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,504
Peter,

274
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:20,967
we would love to welcome you
back to Midtown High,

275
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,760
where we shape heroes.

276
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,637
Or murderers.

277
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:25,722
Stop it.

278
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,475
- It's an honor to serve you, sir.
- It's not.

279
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,893
Mysterio was right.

280
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,687
- Stop. That's all.
- Mysterio was right.

281
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,398
Some students put this together for you.

282
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,276
- No, you did that.
- I helped a little bit.

283
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,279
And I tried to stop you so many times,
but you powered through.

284
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,840
- He did all of that.
- Did a great job.

285
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,325
I hope you have time to check it out.

286
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,119
Feel free to walk
or swing through the hallway.

287
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,455
Or crawl on the ceiling
to avoid everybody.

288
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,957
- We all know you can do it.
- I'm just gonna...

289
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,460
- I know what you did.
- Stop. You're embarrassing yourself.

290
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,170
He's a conspiracy theorist.

291
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,144
Can we just stay up here all day?

292
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,938
- It is so crazy down there.
- This one's good.

293
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,108
"Some suggest that Parker's powers
include the male spider's ability

294
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,818
to hypnotize females,

295
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:25,281
which he used to seduce Jones-Watson
into his cult of personality.”

296
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,075
Stop. Stop.

297
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,826
Yes, my Spider-Lord.

298
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,961
Finally, some privacy.

299
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,755
It is so crazy down there.

300
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,216
So I was thinking...

301
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,220
when we get into MIT,
we should live together.

302
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,263
- Yeah, for sure.
- Yeah, I'd love that.

303
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,852
- This is gonna be us.
- Yes. Minus the Frisbee and the smiling.

304
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,604
MIT's obviously the dream,

305
00:14:56,687 --> 00:15:01,067
but if we match up our backup schools,
then either way, we'll be in Boston.

306
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,152
New school, new town.
I can Spider-Man there.

307
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,405
- They have crime in Boston, right?
- Yes.

308
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,032
- Wicked crime.
- It'll be like a fresh start.

309
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,077
What's up?

310
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,788
I don't know.
I just feel like, if you don't--

311
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,374
If you expect disappointment,

312
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,960
then you can never really
get disappointed.

313
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,169
Come on.

314
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,549
Be a fresh start.
And we'll all be together.

315
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,428
Yeah. No, you're right. Fresh start.

316
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,511
Yeah.

317
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,391
Fresh start.

318
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,311
First one's here!

319
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,651
It's okay. It's a backup.

320
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,027
Peter.

321
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,281
No?

322
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:52,909
Last one.

323
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,662
MIT?

324
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,376
Okay.

325
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,805
Okay.

326
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,476
- Ready?
- Jones,

327
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,187
I told you to take down
the Halloween decorations.

328
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,482
- Actually, that was Sasha, so--
- Enough attitude. Just do it.

329
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,816
On it.

330
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,487
Feel like I'm gonna puke.

331
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,198
Don't because he will
just make me clean it.

332
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,867
This is our only shot.
It's here or nowhere.

333
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,036
- Hey. Come on.
- Okay. You ready?

334
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,079
- Yeah.
- Okay, on three.

335
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:40,541
One, two, three.

336
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,066
No.

337
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,193
No. You?

338
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,363
"In light of recent controversy,

339
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:15,034
we are unable to consider
your application at this time."

340
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,869
This is so not fair.

341
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,914
I mean, this is so not fair.
I didn't do anything wrong.

342
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,083
You guys definitely didn't do
anything wrong.

343
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,711
Expect disappointment
and you will never get disappointed.

344
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,215
No sleep till

345
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,678
Boston

346
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,017
You didn't get in?

347
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,603
Yeah, because we're actually friends
with Spider-Man.

348
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,149
Yeah. I better get going.

349
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:50,278
There's a mixer for new admissions and--

350
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,571
Sorry, guys.

351
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,198
Jones, what are you doing?
Get back to work.

352
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,283
Yeah, I'm coming.

353
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,908
Know what?

354
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,371
I wouldn't change a thing I did.

355
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,789
Me neither.

356
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,754
Although I do need
to show this letter to my parents.

357
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,575
Hi.

358
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,621
Hi?

359
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,706
I'm--

360
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,211
The most famous person
in the world. I know.

361
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:35,424
Wong. Try not to slip.
We don't have liability insurance.

362
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,138
- Is all this for a holiday party?
- No.

363
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:44,308
One of the rotunda gateways
connects to Siberia.

364
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,018
A blizzard blasted through.

365
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,773
Because someone forgot
to cast a monthly maintenance spell

366
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,274
to keep the seals tight.

367
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,486
That's right, he did, because he forgot
I now have higher duties.

368
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,696
Higher duties?

369
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,989
The Sorcerer Supreme has higher duties.

370
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:01,242
Wait, I thought
you were the Sorcerer Supreme.

371
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,829
No, he got it on a technicality
'cause I blipped for five years.

372
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:07,623
- Congratulations.
- If I'd been here, then--

373
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:08,916
You'd burn the place down.

374
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,335
You two, no one said stop shoveling.

375
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,004
So, Peter, to what do I owe the pleasure?

376
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,758
Right. I'm really sorry
to bother you, sir.

377
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,802
Please. We saved half
the universe together.

378
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,514
- Think we're beyond you calling me "sir."
- Okay, Stephen.

379
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,182
That feels weird, but I'll allow it.

380
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,060
When...

381
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,939
When Mysterio revealed my identity,

382
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,652
my entire life got screwed up
and I was wondering--

383
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:39,655
I don't know if this would actually work,
but I was wondering if...

384
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,660
maybe you could go back in time
and make it so he never did?

385
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:50,124
Peter, we tampered
with the stability of space-time

386
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,001
to resurrect countless lives.

387
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,336
You wanna do it again now
just 'cause yours got messy?

388
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,796
It's not about me.

389
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,965
This is really hurting a lot of people.

390
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:01,051
My Aunt May, Happy,

391
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,553
my best friend, my girlfriend,

392
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,614
their futures are ruined
just because they know me,

393
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,724
and they've done nothing wrong.

394
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,809
I am so sorry...

395
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,228
but even if I wanted to...

396
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,482
I don't have the Time Stone anymore.

397
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:17,818
That's right.

398
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:25,159
I'm really sorry if I wasted your time.

399
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,286
- You didn't.
- Just forget about it.

400
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,206
Oh, he will. He's very good
at forgetting things.

401
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,710
Wong, you've actually generated
a good idea.

402
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:35,795
What?

403
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,963
The Runes of Kof-Kol.

404
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,632
The Runes of Kof-Kol?

405
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,051
It's just a standard spell of forgetting.

406
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,095
Won't turn back time, but people will
forget you were ever Spider-Man.

407
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,097
- Seriously?
- No, not seriously.

408
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:50,768
That spell travels the dark borders
between known and unknown reality.

409
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,061
It's too dangerous.

410
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,772
We've used it for a lot less.

411
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,982
Do you remember
the full moon party at Kamar-Taj?

412
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,609
- No.
- Exactly.

413
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,614
Come on, Wong.

414
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,909
Hasn't he been through enough?

415
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,584
Just leave me out of this.

416
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,460
Fine.

417
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,712
Fine.

418
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,143
So, what is this place?

419
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:38,023
The Sanctum’s built at the intersection
of cosmic energy currents.

420
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,733
We weren't the first to seek them out.

421
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,862
Some of these walls
are thousands of years old.

422
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:47,491
And they shot an episode
of The Equalizer here in the '80s.

423
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:48,575
Well, I...

424
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,329
really appreciate you
doing this for me, sir.

425
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,248
Don't mention it.

426
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,626
And don't call me "sir."

427
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,752
Right. Sorry.

428
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,630
You ready?

429
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:03,673
I'm ready.

430
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,219
Nice knowing you, Spider-Man.

431
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:12,932
Wait, excuse me?

432
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,147
The entire world's about to forget
that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.

433
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,524
- Including me.
- Everyone?

434
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,987
- Can't some people still know?
- That's not how the spell works.

435
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,949
And it's very difficult and dangerous
to change it mid-casting.

436
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,160
So my girlfriend's gonna
forget everything?

437
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,745
Is she even gonna be my girlfriend?

438
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,205
Was she your girlfriend
just 'cause you were Spider-Man?

439
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,750
- I don't know. I really hope not.
- All right, fine.

440
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:43,297
Everyone's gonna forget
you're Spider-Man except your girlfriend.

441
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,506
Thank you so much.

442
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,134
Oh, my God, Ned. Ned.

443
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,137
What is a Ned?

444
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,057
He's my best friend,
so it's important to me that Ned knows.

445
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:01,941
Okay, let's not change
the parameters of this spell any more

446
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,817
- while I'm casting it.
- Okay, I'm done.

447
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,110
I swear, I'm done. I'm done.

448
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:08,864
- But my Aunt May should really know.
- Peter, stop tampering with the spell.

449
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,367
When she found out I was Spider-Man,
it was really messy.

450
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,661
I don't think
I could go through that again.

451
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,330
- So my Aunt May?
- Yes.

452
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,706
Thank you. Happy?

453
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,999
No, I'm annoyed.

454
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,043
No, it's a nickname. Harold "Happy" Hogan.

455
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,253
He used to work with Tony Stark,
but then he was...

456
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:25,005
Would you just stop talking?

457
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:37,434
Basically, everyone that knew
I was Spider-Man before should still know!

458
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,206
- Did it work?
- No.

459
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,376
You changed my spell six times.

460
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,086
- Five times.
- You changed my spell.

461
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,506
You don't do that.
I told you. And that is why.

462
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,259
That spell was out of control.
If I hadn't shut it down,

463
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,678
something catastrophic
could have happened.

464
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,389
- Stephen, listen, I am so--
- Call me "sir."

465
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,143
Sorry, sir.

466
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:25,566
After everything we've been through,
somehow I always forget you're just a kid.

467
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,653
Look, Parker, the problem is not Mysterio.

468
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:31,989
It's you trying
to live two different lives.

469
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,533
And the longer you do that,
the more dangerous it becomes.

470
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,826
Believe me.

471
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:39,747
I'm so sorry about you
and your friends not getting into college,

472
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,460
but if they rejected you and you tried
to convince them to reconsider,

473
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,712
there's nothing else you can do.

474
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,800
When you say "convince them,"

475
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,511
- you mean, I could have called them?
- Yeah.

476
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,138
I could do that?

477
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,558
You haven't called the...?

478
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,393
I got their letter. I assumed that was--

479
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,603
I'm sorry.

480
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,438
Are you telling me

481
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,775
that you didn't even think
to plead your case with them first

482
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:11,612
before you asked me
to brainwash the entire world?

483
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,283
When you put it like that...

484
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,709
Come on, pick up, pick up.

485
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,169
Dude, what? I'm busy.

486
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,505
- Flash, where's the MIT mixer?
- Why?

487
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,090
Because I need to talk to someone.

488
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,151
I'm trying to get Ned and MJ
a second chance at getting in.

489
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,384
What's in it for me?

490
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,178
I'm risking a lot just talking to you.

491
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,721
Okay, I will...

492
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,975
pick you up and swing you
to school for one week?

493
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,059
For a month.

494
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,187
- For a week.
- Two weeks.

495
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,523
- Flash, please. Help me.
- You know what I want.

496
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,610
Okay, I'll tell everyone
you're my best friend.

497
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,654
- Flash, please, help me.
- Cool.

498
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,740
There's the assistant vice chancellor.
You can plead your case with her.

499
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,534
- Okay, perfect. Where is she?
- She left.

500
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,369
- To go where?
- To the airport.

501
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,919
Stark network unavailable.

502
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,047
Facial recognition unavailable.

503
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,301
Hi.

504
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,139
Yeah, I can see you.

505
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,358
Oh, my God!

506
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,320
- That's Peter Parker.
- Mom.

507
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,989
- Mom, look.
- Mommy.

508
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,657
No, it's Peter Parker.

509
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,333
Hey!

510
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:50,918
Okay.

511
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,764
Yeah.

512
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:04,725
Hi. I'm Peter Parker.

513
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,352
- You do know you're in the street, right?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

514
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:10,606
I really needed to talk to you and I know
you're on your way to the airport.

515
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:14,234
MJ Watson and Ned Leeds are
the two smartest people I've ever met,

516
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,695
and I'm the dumbest person
because I let them help me,

517
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,697
but if I didn't, millions would've died,

518
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,908
so please don't let MIT be dumb like me.

519
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:21,992
MIT is dumb?

520
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,995
No, I'm saying, don't let MIT be dumb.

521
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:29,625
I mean, like the dumber version of me
that wouldn't have let them help.

522
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,754
You didn't rehearse that, did you, Peter?

523
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,173
Basically, what I'm trying to--

524
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,474
Why are you running?

525
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,562
Oh, my God.

526
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,190
Ma'am, you should get out of the car.

527
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,442
Everybody get off the bridge!

528
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,445
The door's locked.

529
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,197
Door's-- Hey!

530
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,382
Hello, Peter.

531
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,426
Hi? Do we--? Do I know you?

532
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,762
What have you done with my machine?

533
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,682
I don't know what you're talking about.
What machine?

534
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,601
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

535
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,103
It's gone.

536
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,272
Listen, if you stop smashing cars,

537
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,983
we can work together
and I can help you find your machine.

538
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,567
You want to play games?

539
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,530
Catch!

540
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:00,841
It's okay. You guys are good.
You're safe. Get out of here.

541
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,635
You think
your fancy new suit's gonna save you?

542
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,486
Should've killed your little girlfriend
when I had the chance.

543
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:26,867
What did you just say?

544
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,119
Looks like we got competition.

545
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,223
Peter!

546
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,350
Help!

547
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:15,665
Don't worry, ma'am! I'm coming!

548
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,752
Peter!

549
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,155
Ma'am, just stay calm.

550
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,407
Just take a deep breath.

551
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,158
- Are you okay?
- No!

552
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:55,080
I promise,
I've got this all under control.

553
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,463
Suit compromised.

554
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,549
Nanotechnology.

555
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,552
Ah, you've outdone yourself, Peter.

556
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,435
I underestimated you.

557
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,104
But now you die.

558
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:36,955
You're not Peter Parker.

559
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,416
I am so confused right now.

560
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:43,253
What's happening?

561
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,796
New device detected.

562
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,175
Pairing new device.

563
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,931
You don't listen to him. You listen to me.

564
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,812
Hey.

565
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,536
Hey. Hey.

566
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,746
Listen to me.

567
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,457
No, not him. Me.

568
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,632
Ma'am, you okay?

569
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,258
You can still make your flight.

570
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:32,301
Peter.

571
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,013
You're a hero.

572
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,348
No. Well, I'm--

573
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,516
No, I'm--

574
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:40,393
I'm gonna talk to Admissions
about your friends.

575
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:41,957
And I'm gonna talk to them about you.

576
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,148
But, ma'am, this isn't about me.

577
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:49,194
I am going to talk to them
about your friends and you.

578
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,862
- Okay?
- Really?

579
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,949
And if you keep your noses clean,
maybe you'll have a fair shot.

580
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,867
Here. Get out of the way.
Let me get that man.

581
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:58,620
Hey. You. I see you. Come here!

582
00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,996
That was not okay.

583
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,164
Unbelievable.

584
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,833
Who are--?

585
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,085
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

586
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,046
Until you stop trying to kill me,
I'm in control, buddy,

587
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:11,800
of this whole tentacle situation
you got going on here, okay?

588
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,885
Now, who are you? What is going--?

589
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,270
No.

590
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,404
Osborn?

591
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:56,302
Doctor--?

592
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:08,231
Be careful what you wish for, Parker.

593
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,858
Let me out of here!

594
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,985
Can you please explain to me
what is going on?

595
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,695
That little spell that you botched

596
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,573
where you wanted everyone
to forget that Peter Parker's Spider-Man,

597
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:19,576
it started pulling in everyone
who knows Peter Parker's Spider-Man

598
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,329
from every universe into this one.

599
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:26,374
- From every universe?
- Who are you? And where am I?

600
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,960
I think it's better we don't engage
with them because, frankly,

601
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:33,173
the multiverse is a concept
about which we know frighteningly little.

602
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,258
The multiverse is real?

603
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,761
This shouldn't be possible.

604
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,096
- I thought you stopped the spell.
- No, I contained it.

605
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,432
It would appear
a few of them squeaked through.

606
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,809
After you left,
I detected an otherworldly presence.

607
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,646
I pursued it into the sewers,
where I found that...

608
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,732
slimy, green son of a gun.

609
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,109
Spell? As in magic?

610
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,612
What is this, a birthday party?

611
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,198
Who is this clown? What is this madness?

612
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,660
Watch this. Do you know
a Peter Parker who's Spider-Man?

613
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,203
- Yes.
- Is that him?

614
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,788
-See?

615
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:07,916
Here's what we gotta do.

616
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,335
I don't know how many visitors we've got--

617
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,962
I saw another one on the bridge.

618
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,508
He was like a flying green elf.

619
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,593
He sounds jolly. Start with him.

620
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,346
I need you to capture them,
bring them here while I figure out

621
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:25,100
how to get them back
before they destroy the fabric of reality,

622
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,976
or worse, Wong finds out.

623
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,145
Doctor Strange?

624
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,229
What?

625
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:33,942
My friends and I just got
a second chance to get into MIT,

626
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,820
and if the school sees me
fighting these crazy monsters--

627
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,613
- Hey, watch your mouth.
- I'm sorry, but--

628
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,907
Are you seriously
still talking about college?

629
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,957
- Hey, what did you just do?
- This.

630
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,918
Hey, you can't just--

631
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,841
- How did you do that?
- Lots of birthday parties.

632
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,598
Hey.

633
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:10,854
One shot, send them here, move on.
You're welcome.

634
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,564
- Get to work.
- Sir?

635
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,441
Now what?

636
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,278
This is my mess,
and I swear that I'll fix it,

637
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,904
but I'm gonna need help.

638
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,535
I can't believe
I'm in the Sanctum Sanctorum.

639
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,828
Neither can I.

640
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,039
So how did you know
you were a man of magic?

641
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:32,292
Because my Nana says
that we have it in our family,

642
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,420
- and I get these tinglings in my hands--
- Talk to your physician.

643
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,838
- Peter.
- Hey.

644
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,715
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

645
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,341
Sorry for dragging you into this.

646
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:43,219
- Help me find these guys.
- You don't have to apologize, okay?

647
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,388
You got us
a second shot at MIT. It's fine.

648
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:48,099
So how did the bad guys get here?

649
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:51,269
We screwed up a spell
trying to get you into college.

650
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,105
- You did it with magic?
- I thought it was the MIT lady you saved.

651
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:57,442
No, that was after.
Let's just focus on the good news, okay?

652
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,235
No, let's just focus on the bad news.

653
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:03,406
As of now, you have detected
zero multiversal trespassers,

654
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:07,744
so get on your phones,
scour the Internet, and...

655
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,412
Scooby-Doo this shit.

656
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:14,125
You're telling us what to do, even though
it was your spell that got screwed up,

657
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,294
meaning that all this is your mess.

658
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:21,132
I know a couple of magic words myself,
starting with the word "please.”

659
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,554
Please Scooby-Doo this shit.

660
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,140
You can work in the undercroft.

661
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,018
The undercroft?

662
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:37,941
Badass.

663
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,659
- About this whole spell thing--
- It's totally okay.

664
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,744
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean, I get it.

665
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:54,624
You were just trying
to fix things, and so...

666
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:57,418
Maybe just run it by us next time,
you know?

667
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,963
That way, when you're thinking,
"I'm about to do something

668
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,715
that could break the universe,"

669
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:06,052
we could, like, help you
workshop something or...

670
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:09,305
brainstorm ideas.

671
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,432
Deal.

672
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:14,894
Ned?

673
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,815
Oh, dude, I don't care.
It's seriously not a big deal.

674
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:23,069
A torture rack.

675
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,447
That is a Pilates machine.

676
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,575
- That is--
- The crypt.

677
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,827
Okay, so we get the rest of the guys,

678
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,912
you zap them,
Doctor Magic will send them back,

679
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:37,000
and when we get into MIT,
round of stale doughnuts, my treat.

680
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,793
Let's catch some multiverse men.

681
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,838
Hey! Who the hell are these two?

682
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,465
- My friends. This is MJ. And this is Ned.
- Hey.

683
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:45,549
Hello.

684
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:49,345
- Sorry, what was your name again?
- Dr. Otto Octavius.

685
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,060
Seriously, what's your actual name?

686
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,645
Oh, is that a dinosaur?

687
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,753
If the paint won't come off,
I'll get it out.

688
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,839
No, no, no, May.
We gotta find these guys first.

689
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,008
Finish your mission and then come by.

690
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,551
We're having a canned food drive.

691
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,346
- That could work.
- I got one.

692
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,764
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

693
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,933
I mean, you can take
the guy out of the chair,

694
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:37,143
but you can't take
the chair out of the guy.

695
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,604
- What'd you find?
- There's a...

696
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:43,358
A disturbance near a military
research facility outside of the city,

697
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:47,236
and witnesses say that they saw
a monster flying through the air.

698
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,698
It's gotta be the guy I saw on the bridge.

699
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,075
That's impossible.

700
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:55,787
You know him, don't you?

701
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,040
On the bridge, you said his name.

702
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,709
Norman Osborn.

703
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,838
Brilliant scientist. Military research.

704
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,842
But he was greedy, misguided.

705
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:14,180
- What happened to him?
- We tire of your questions, boy!

706
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:16,515
Okay.

707
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,895
- I gotta go. Where am I going?
- It can't be him.

708
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,315
Why?

709
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:27,860
Because Norman Osborn died years ago.

710
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:31,280
So either we saw someone else...

711
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:37,745
or you're flying out
into the darkness to fight a ghost.

712
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,938
Keep an eye out on the trees.
We don't know where this guy is.

713
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,819
I genuinely don't know
how you do this without throwing up.

714
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,047
Did you see that?

715
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,592
- No.
- It's really dark.

716
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,773
Okay, okay, okay.

717
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,864
What's happening?

718
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:56,032
Peter, what is it?

719
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,036
Are you getting the tingle thing?

720
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,538
Is the tingle happening?
Is your tingle tingling?

721
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,549
- Are you guys seeing this?
- Yeah.

722
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,677
- Osborn?
- No. He was green. This guy's blue.

723
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:21,182
You wouldn't happen to be
from another universe, would you?

724
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,643
What's he doing?

725
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,896
- I don't know. Looks like he's charging.
- I don't like this. Just web him.

726
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:43,121
Go left! Left, dude, left!
Left! Go! Left! Yes!

727
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:47,083
What are you talking about? Right.
Go to the right! Right! Right!

728
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:50,920
- He means right. Don't listen to him.
- This is not helping!

729
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,221
Oh, no, no, no.
What happened? Peter? Peter.

730
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:13,442
Peter, it's me, Flint Marko. You remember?

731
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:16,696
- I'm Peter, but I'm not your Peter.
- What do you mean, you're not my Peter?

732
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:20,783
- What the hell is going on?
- I'll explain, but first, can you help me?

733
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,743
- Okay.
- You try to surround him,

734
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,871
and I'll pull the plug.
All right, let's go!

735
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,888
I can't hold him much longer.

736
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,390
I got it, I got it!

737
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,378
Different Peter. Weird.

738
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:17,506
- Thanks. Sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

739
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,225
I got my body back.

740
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,142
Hey.

741
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:33,689
This is gonna sound really crazy,
but this isn't your universe.

742
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:34,815
Another universe?

743
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,026
- What?
- That's what I was feeling.

744
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,112
The power, it's different.

745
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:42,865
I like it.

746
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:48,454
- Easy, buddy.
- It's actually my fault that you're here.

747
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:51,624
Like, the universe or the woods?

748
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,376
I hate the woods.

749
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,378
I meant, the universe, sir.

750
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,839
So, what, y'all just gonna stand here
and act like I ain't butt-ass naked?

751
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,633
- I am.
- No, no.

752
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:02,218
I...

753
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,857
What was that?
What did you just do to him?

754
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:18,943
- No. It's okay.
- Did you kill him?

755
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,112
I can explain everything. Trust me.

756
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,948
- Please, just trust me.
- I don't trust you. I don't know you.

757
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,160
What is this?

758
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,080
You picked the wrong side.

759
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:34,917
Connors?

760
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,587
Wait. You know this creature?

761
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:41,716
No, no, no. Not a creature. A man.

762
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,010
The same universes.

763
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:48,139
Dr. Curt Connors. He was a scientist
at Oscorp when I worked there.

764
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,266
A brilliant scientist.

765
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,976
Until he turned himself into a lizard.

766
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,186
Then he tried to turn
the whole city into lizards.

767
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,689
- It was crazy.
- It wasn't crazy, Max.

768
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,899
It was the next step in human evolution.

769
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:01,068
- The dinosaur can talk. Right.
- Lizard.

770
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,737
What happened to you?

771
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,574
Last I recall, you had bad teeth,
glasses and a comb-over.

772
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,451
Did you get a makeover?

773
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:11,787
You know I can give you a real makeover.

774
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,247
Let me guess, into a lizard?

775
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,916
- Exactly.
- Would you two just shut up?

776
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,710
- Where are we?
- It's complicated.

777
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,421
- A wizard's dungeon.
- Wizard's dungeon?

778
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:24,175
There's no real way to sugarcoat that.
It's literally the dungeon of a wizard.

779
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,760
You can keep your magic.

780
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,555
I want a taste of that energy I just felt.

781
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:35,978
- Oh, Peter, hey.
- Did those guys come through yet?

782
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:38,064
There should be an electric guy
and a sand guy.

783
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:40,691
Yeah, they're all here and locked up.

784
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,694
Perfect. I'm gonna just stay here
and try and fix some of this damage,

785
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,529
so they don't blame it on me again.

786
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,448
- Okay.
- But, hey, I...

787
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,660
I couldn't do any of this without you,
so thank you.

788
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:52,744
Of course.

789
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:55,956
Hey, ask him
if this is like a tree monster

790
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,417
or like a scientist
that turned into a tree.

791
00:47:58,501 --> 00:47:59,835
It's just a tree, man.

792
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:01,921
Just a tree.

793
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:22,441
Coward. We have a new world to conquer.

794
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:25,861
You make me sick.

795
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,738
Leave me alone, please.

796
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:30,449
Hiding in the shadows.

797
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,244
Hiding from who you truly are.

798
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,872
- No.
- You can't escape yourself.

799
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:55,433
- Hey, May.
- Hey, Peter. I'm at work, and...

800
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:58,519
one of the guys
you're looking for just walked in.

801
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,072
May? Where's May? Thank you.

802
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:14,451
May.

803
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:18,164
Hey, here he is.

804
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:21,500
Norman, this is my nephew.

805
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,629
Norman Osborn? I thought that you were--

806
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:29,300
I saw Spider-Man in an ad for this place.

807
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:32,136
And I thought he could help me.

808
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,054
But you're not him.

809
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:36,474
Wait, so you want Spider-Man's help?

810
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,267
He just wandered in.

811
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:43,063
I didn't know where else to go.

812
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:46,609
Someone's living in my house.

813
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,196
Oscorp doesn't exist.

814
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,157
My son...

815
00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:00,206
Sometimes I'm not myself.

816
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:04,210
I'm... someone else.

817
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:07,338
And every time he's in control,
I can't remember.

818
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,715
- Who's in control?
- And now I'm here--

819
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,968
- Who's in control?
- I don't know what's going on.

820
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:16,639
- Okay, it's okay.
- And I don't-- Doesn't make sense.

821
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,517
He's lost.

822
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:23,145
And I don't mean just in the cosmos.
I mean, in his mind.

823
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,316
Are they all like this?

824
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,318
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

825
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:32,780
They all have their own mental
or physical issues.

826
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,783
Oh, well, he needs help
and maybe they all do.

827
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,912
Wait, you don't mean--?
No, May, this isn't my problem.

828
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,914
Peter, not your problem?

829
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:46,418
May, their chance of getting help is
way better back where they came from.

830
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:51,340
Sending them home, that's the best thing
that we can do for them.

831
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,676
For them? Or for yourself?

832
00:50:56,762 --> 00:51:00,015
Look around you. This is what we do.

833
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:03,936
- We help people.
- This is what's best for them.

834
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:05,896
Trust me.

835
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:12,403
But the fact remains,
Spider-Man is a menace.

836
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,533
We'll be right back after a brief word
from Daily Bugle Supplements.

837
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:20,411
The only other daily fix you need.

838
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,537
And we're out.

839
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,540
What?

840
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,795
I got eyes on him.

841
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:32,089
- He's with his aunt and some guy.
- You sure?

842
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:35,134
- They're just leaving the shelter.
- Okay. Don't lose him.

843
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:49,023
Thanks, May. Hope to see you again.

844
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:53,027
Hey. He trusts you. So do.

845
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,447
Thanks for cleaning my suit.

846
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:58,656
See you later.

847
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,871
- Guys, this is Mr. Osborn.
- Hey, it's "doctor."

848
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,206
Sorry. Dr. Osborn, these are my friends.

849
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,625
This is Ned and MJ.

850
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:11,962
- Mary Jane?
- It's Michelle Jones, actually.

851
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:14,882
Fascinating.

852
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,221
Do you think there are other Ned Leedses?

853
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:35,944
Octavius?

854
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:41,241
Osborn?

855
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,494
What happened to you?

856
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,703
What happened to--?

857
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,916
- You're the walking corpse.
- What do you mean?

858
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,543
You died, Norman.

859
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:53,212
Years ago.

860
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,756
You're insane.

861
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,840
God, I love it here.

862
00:52:56,924 --> 00:53:00,260
What are you talking about?
He's standing right there.

863
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:01,387
- He's not--
- Dead.

864
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:05,224
They both died, fighting Spider-Man.

865
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:11,105
It was all over the news.

866
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:16,026
Green Goblin, impaled
by the glider you flew around on.

867
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:20,739
And a couple of years later, you, Doc Ock,

868
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:23,867
- drowned in the river with your machine.
- Nonsense.

869
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:29,164
Spider-Man was trying to stop
my fusion reactor, so I stopped him.

870
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:33,502
I had him by the throat, and then I...

871
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:39,717
And then I was here.

872
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:44,138
Please. Let me tell you something.
I was whupping Spider-Man's ass.

873
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,765
He'll tell you.
And then he caused an overload.

874
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:49,059
I was stuck in the grid, absorbing data.

875
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:51,520
I was about to turn
into pure energy, and then...

876
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:52,603
And then...

877
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,649
And then-- Oh, shit.

878
00:53:57,025 --> 00:54:01,405
- I was about to die.
- Max, do you know? Do I die?

879
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,952
- Oh, great. You caught another one.
- No, wait, Strange.

880
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,704
He's not dangerous.

881
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:11,665
It's okay.

882
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:15,835
What is that?

883
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:19,047
It's an ancient relic.
The Macchina di Kadavus.

884
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:22,426
I've trapped your corrupted spell inside,
and once I finish the proper ritual,

885
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:26,555
it'll reverse the spell and send
these guys back to their universes.

886
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,141
And then what? We perish?

887
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,934
No. No, thanks. I'll pass on that.

888
00:54:31,018 --> 00:54:34,021
Let me out of here. Peter!

889
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:37,900
Strange, we can't send them back. Not yet.

890
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,650
Why?

891
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:44,740
- Well, some of these guys are gonna die.
- Parker.

892
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:47,159
It's their fate.

893
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,620
Come on, have a heart.

894
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:54,500
In the grand calculus of the multiverse,

895
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,921
their sacrifice means infinitely more
than their lives.

896
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:05,803
I'm sorry, Kid.

897
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,348
If they die, they die.

898
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,321
Peter!

899
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,960
Don't.

900
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:43,966
- What are you doing?
- Peter, you gotta go. Go.

901
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,050
- Okay.
- Get out of here.

902
00:55:47,386 --> 00:55:49,137
This is why I never had kids.

903
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,945
- Give me the box.
- No.

904
00:56:23,422 --> 00:56:24,798
Oh, my God, I'm dead.

905
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:27,801
You're not dead, you've just been
separated from your physical form.

906
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:29,845
My physical-- What?

907
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,598
How are you doing that?

908
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:36,268
- I have no idea.
- You should not be able to do that.

909
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,811
This feels amazing.

910
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:50,884
One of the coolest things
that's ever happened to me,

911
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:52,367
but don't ever do that again.

912
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,500
Hey! Get off of me!

913
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,133
What is this place?

914
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:53,053
The Mirror Dimension,
where I'm in control.

915
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:04,731
Strange, stop.
Can we just talk about this?

916
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:07,818
Parker, don't you realize
that in the multiverse,

917
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:12,489
there are an infinite number of people
who know Peter Parker is Spider-Man?

918
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:15,450
And if that spell gets loose,
they're all coming here.

919
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:18,286
I know, I get it,
but we can't just send them home to die.

920
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:19,579
It's their fate.

921
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,250
You can't change that any more
than you could change who they are.

922
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,545
What if we could?
What if we could change their fate?

923
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:29,715
What are you doing?

924
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:36,096
I'm not giving you the--

925
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,775
Give me that back.

926
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:11,965
Wait a minute.
Is that an Archimedean Spiral?

927
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:14,468
The dimension is just geometry?
You're great at geometry.

928
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,136
You can do geometry.

929
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:19,931
Square the radius. Divide by pi.

930
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,142
- Plot points along the curve.
- It's over, Parker.

931
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,853
I'll come pick you up when it's done.

932
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:28,774
Hey, Strange.

933
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,193
You know what's cooler than magic?

934
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,574
- Math.
- Don't do this.

935
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:42,537
I'm sorry, sir, but...

936
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,418
I have to try.

937
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:51,797
- What happened?
- I had a fight with Strange and I won.

938
00:59:51,798 --> 00:59:54,091
- What happened?
- I had a fight with Strange and I won.

939
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:56,176
- What?
- I stole his ring thing.

940
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:01,056
I was swinging, and then I went
through this massive mirror thing,

941
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,766
- and then I was back--
- Where is he?

942
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,684
He's trapped,
but I'm not sure for how long.

943
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:06,770
You could have left us to die.

944
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,313
Why didn't you?

945
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:09,856
'Cause that's not who he is.

946
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,278
I think I can help you guys.

947
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:18,073
If I can fix what happened to you,
then when you go back,

948
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:21,576
things will be different,
and you might not die fighting Spider-Man.

949
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,954
- What do you mean?
- Our technology is advanced--

950
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:28,500
I can help you. You know,
I'm something of a scientist myself.

951
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:32,379
Octavius knows what I can do.

952
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:35,006
Fix? You mean, like a dog?

953
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,424
I refuse.

954
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:39,177
I can't promise you guys anything,
but at least this way,

955
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:41,471
you get to go home and have a chance.

956
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:42,722
A second chance.

957
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,225
Isn't that worth trying?

958
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,937
Trust me, Peter,
when you try to fix people,

959
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,731
there are always consequences.

960
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:55,026
You don't have to come.
I also didn't know that you could talk.

961
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,570
But if you stay here...

962
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,052
you'll have to deal with the wizard.

963
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:03,618
So we go along or die.
Not much of a choice, is it?

964
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:05,120
I just wanna go home.

965
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:08,915
I, myself, don't wanna be killed,
especially by a guy dressed

966
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:12,502
like Dungeons & Dragons,
so, what's your plan?

967
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:15,630
I have it all under control.

968
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,136
What are we gonna do about this thing?

969
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:23,805
We need
to find somewhere safe for it, right?

970
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:26,099
- Yeah, sure. You gotta take it.
- Wait, what?

971
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:29,519
If something bad happens,
you just push this and then it's over.

972
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:31,396
We're not gonna leave you.

973
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:32,731
You can't. It's dangerous.

974
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,816
- You have done enough.
- We're in this together.

975
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:38,445
I know we're in this together, Ned,
but I can't do this if you're in danger.

976
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,281
Okay? So for me, MJ,
please just take this.

977
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:46,161
- Please.
- Fine.

978
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:48,079
- Thank you.
- But, Peter,

979
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:50,415
if I don't hear from you,
I'm pressing the button.

980
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:52,709
- Sure.
- Okay. And I will do it.

981
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:55,837
Yeah, we all believe you, Michelle.

982
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:58,798
No way that's his girlfriend. No way.

983
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:01,509
- She'll do it.
- Absolutely, she will.

984
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:05,764
- Okay. See you later.
- Be safe.

985
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:06,932
- You too.
- Okay.

986
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,269
Okay.

987
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:15,857
- Be careful, okay?
- Yeah. You too.

988
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:24,823
So...

989
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:27,577
who's coming with me?

990
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:32,873
Well, I'm in.

991
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,835
But if this goes sideways...

992
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:39,089
I'm gonna fry you from the inside out.

993
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:54,396
- Where's Connors?
- He wants to stay in the truck.

994
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:57,274
- Okay.
- Alarm system deactivated.

995
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,400
Hey, May.

996
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:02,988
- Yeah?
- I feel bad using Happy's place like this.

997
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:05,073
No, no, no. He'll get over it.

998
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,952
New Yorkers oppose
the Statue of Liberty renovation...

999
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,035
Oh, sorry.

1000
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:12,414
So this is your plan, Peter?

1001
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:14,499
No lab, no facilities?

1002
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:16,459
Just performing miracles in a condominium?

1003
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:20,588
What, you gonna cook us some cures
and some frozen burritos in a microwave?

1004
01:03:20,672 --> 01:03:23,675
- I could go for a burrito.
- He's gonna kill us all.

1005
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,051
Well, let's hope not.

1006
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,929
- You're up first, Doc.
- What?

1007
01:03:28,013 --> 01:03:29,597
Hey, I told you, I don't need fixing.

1008
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:32,434
I don't need fixing!

1009
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:36,855
Especially by a teenager using scraps
from a bachelor's junk drawer.

1010
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:39,524
Nah, nah, nah.
He got something back there.

1011
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:42,402
I can feel it. That weird energy.

1012
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:46,406
- What the hell is that?
- It's a fabricator.

1013
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:50,535
It can analyze, design,
construct basically anything.

1014
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,788
I thought that was
the tanning bed Happy broke.

1015
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:57,709
Look at that.

1016
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,551
He's gonna kill us all.

1017
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:17,187
What's going on there?

1018
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:20,982
So the chip in the back of Doc's neck
was designed to protect his brain

1019
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:24,736
from the Al system that's controlling
these tentacles, but if you look here...

1020
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:27,989
the chip is fried.

1021
01:04:28,073 --> 01:04:30,325
So rather than him being
in control of the tentacles,

1022
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:32,494
the tentacles are now in control of him.

1023
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:37,665
Which, I guess, explains why
he is so miserable all the time.

1024
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:47,049
Thirsty?

1025
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:51,596
Well, yes, I am thirsty.

1026
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:53,807
Fresh water or salt?

1027
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:56,476
You know, because you're an octopus.

1028
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,687
What?

1029
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:02,482
Fresh water it is.

1030
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:04,776
Look at this place.

1031
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:08,863
- And all the possibilities.
- What, this condo?

1032
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:12,033
Yeah, yeah, the condo.
I love the whole open floor plan. No.

1033
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:14,327
Nah, man, I'm talking about the world.

1034
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,205
I kind of like who I am here.

1035
01:05:19,082 --> 01:05:20,583
And all that power back there...

1036
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:23,378
I could be so much more.

1037
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:25,839
So why'd you come along?

1038
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,716
I have a daughter, and I want to see her.

1039
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,927
But he's not gonna send anyone home

1040
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:33,847
till he's finished
his little science project back there.

1041
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:35,640
You trust him?

1042
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,016
I don't trust anyone.

1043
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:40,603
How'd you end up like that, anyway?

1044
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,773
The place where I worked at,

1045
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:48,611
they were experimenting with electricity
created by living organisms, and then...

1046
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,823
I fell into a vat of electric eels.

1047
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:54,909
You're kidding.
I fell into a supercollider.

1048
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:55,993
Damn.

1049
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,621
Gotta be careful where you fall.

1050
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:00,832
Remarkable.

1051
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,711
The technology and you.

1052
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:08,882
When all this is over,

1053
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:14,137
if you need a job and you're willing
to commute to another universe...

1054
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:23,646
It worked. That totally worked!

1055
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:26,941
- I got it. I did it. Will you send him up?
- Here we go.

1056
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,153
- Sorry.
- Hold on, Doc.

1057
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,822
Oh, will these humiliations never cease?

1058
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:35,909
You, keep your science-fair project
away from me!

1059
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,619
It'll work. Have faith.

1060
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:40,705
Says the reckless fool
who turned himself into a monster.

1061
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:43,249
Please stop moving your head.

1062
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,419
- Hold still.
- Don't you dare.

1063
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:55,553
I swear, when I get out of this,
we're gonna rip you a new--

1064
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:01,059
Doc?

1065
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:07,981
Doc?

1066
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:10,943
Doc?

1067
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,028
Dr. Octav--

1068
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:21,246
It's so quiet.

1069
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:28,002
Those voices inside my head...

1070
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:34,676
I'd almost forgotten.

1071
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,177
Otto.

1072
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:40,265
Yes. Norman.

1073
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:47,814
It's me.

1074
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,401
Would you look at that?

1075
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:15,133
I'm grateful, dear boy. Truly.

1076
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:16,509
Yeah, you're welcome.

1077
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:18,344
How can I help?

1078
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:21,222
This is Peter. Leave a message.

1079
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:25,768
Yeah, Peter, this is Happy.
I accessed my doorbell camera.

1080
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:28,062
Who are those guys, huh? Is that a cyborg?

1081
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:30,523
You bring a cyborg
with robot legs into my house?

1082
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:33,109
Was one of the guys made of mud?
What's going on? Call me.

1083
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:43,536
How does it feel, Norman?

1084
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,664
You're about to become whole again.

1085
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:49,792
No more darker half.

1086
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:51,793
Just you.

1087
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:53,880
Just me.

1088
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:04,390
Okay.

1089
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,435
It just goes right here. This...

1090
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:10,772
That should be drawing power now.

1091
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:14,567
I'll come back in a second to check on it,
but keep an eye on the lights.

1092
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:17,570
When they're all green,
the electricity in your body's dissipated.

1093
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:21,407
Well, not all of the electricity. You need
electricity for your brain to function.

1094
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:22,867
Your nervous system is...

1095
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:26,037
I'm not really sure
why I'm explaining electricity to you.

1096
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,665
- Yeah, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1097
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:29,874
Are these your Legos?

1098
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:34,170
I gotta go. I'll be back.

1099
01:09:40,051 --> 01:09:42,387
- Something feels off.
- What do you mean?

1100
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:46,057
- I don't like this.
- Leave it alone.

1101
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:50,103
The sooner you guys get through this,
the sooner we go home.

1102
01:09:57,819 --> 01:10:00,113
- Well, where is he?
- He's inside.

1103
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,864
And yet here we are, outside.

1104
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:03,950
Did you not hear me say, "Don't lose him"?

1105
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,952
I want incriminating footage
of Spider-Man.

1106
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,995
I called Damage Control.
They're on their way.

1107
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:09,747
And so it begins.

1108
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:11,624
Place is about to be swarming with cops.

1109
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:31,727
- Peter?
- Peter?

1110
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:34,479
What's wrong?

1111
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:36,732
I don't know.

1112
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:38,734
May?

1113
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:45,491
What is it, Peter?

1114
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,167
What's happening?

1115
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,884
Why are you looking at me like that?

1116
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:23,362
That's some neat trick,
that sense of yours.

1117
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:26,949
- Norman?
- Norman's on sabbatical, honey.

1118
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,911
- The hell?
- The Goblin.

1119
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:35,917
"No more darker half'? Did you really
think that I'd let that happen?

1120
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:40,296
That I'd let you take away my power
just because you're blind

1121
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:43,758
- to what true power can bring you?
- You don't know me.

1122
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:45,051
Don't I?

1123
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:51,057
I saw how she trapped you,

1124
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,768
fighting her holy moral mission.

1125
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:58,689
We don't need you to save us.

1126
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:00,817
We don't need to be fixed.

1127
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:06,322
These are not curses.

1128
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:09,325
They're gifts.

1129
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:12,703
- Norman, no.
- Quiet, lapdog.

1130
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:15,373
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- I've watched you

1131
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:19,252
from deep behind Norman's cowardly eyes.

1132
01:12:19,919 --> 01:12:25,258
Struggling to have everything you want

1133
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:28,886
while the world tries to make you choose.

1134
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:34,308
Gods don't have to choose.

1135
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:37,895
We take.

1136
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:39,438
May, run.

1137
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:03,880
Oh, my God.

1138
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:07,842
- What have you done?
- I liked you better before.

1139
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:20,396
Up here! He's up there.
It's the guy from the bridge.

1140
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:44,295
Did you see that?

1141
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:11,948
No, you don't!

1142
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,709
Strong enough to have it all.

1143
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:28,464
Too weak to take it!

1144
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:05,376
Now I got you.

1145
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:09,880
I told you, there'd be consequences!

1146
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:31,569
Your weakness, Peter, is morality.

1147
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:35,990
It's choking you. Can't you feel it?

1148
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:45,666
It didn't work.

1149
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:48,711
Norman was right.

1150
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:52,465
He got it from you,
that pathetic sickness.

1151
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:58,804
You tried to fix me.

1152
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:00,848
May, go.

1153
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:03,142
Now I'm gonna fix you.

1154
01:16:07,188 --> 01:16:08,272
May, run, please.

1155
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:13,276
May!

1156
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,744
Peter, Peter, Peter.

1157
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:24,914
No good deed goes unpunished.

1158
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:27,666
You can thank me later.

1159
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:34,799
No!

1160
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:05,538
- May?
- Peter.

1161
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:06,914
May, May, I'm here.

1162
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:11,960
May.

1163
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:13,462
May, I'm here.

1164
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:16,841
Are you okay? What happened?

1165
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:25,182
It's okay. We're okay, right?

1166
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:26,976
Yeah. Knocked on my ass.

1167
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,185
- Yeah, me too.
- That's all.

1168
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:31,897
I think I broke my ribs.

1169
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:39,446
- This is all my fault, May.
- No.

1170
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:41,490
I should have let Strange send them back.

1171
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:42,700
You did the right thing.

1172
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:46,662
They would have been killed.
You did the right thing.

1173
01:17:47,371 --> 01:17:49,415
It's not my responsibility, May.

1174
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:54,211
What Norman said?

1175
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:57,548
My moral mission? No.

1176
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,717
- No, May--
- Peter, you listen to me.

1177
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:02,094
You have a gift.

1178
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,055
You have power.

1179
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,349
And with great power,

1180
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:10,644
there must also come great responsibility.

1181
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:17,443
I know.

1182
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,445
Let's get the... out of here.

1183
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:20,654
Okay, let's go.

1184
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:23,532
Let me just catch my...

1185
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:41,634
- What happened? Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1186
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,469
Yeah, you're okay. What happened?

1187
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:46,388
Just have to...

1188
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:48,556
catch my breath.

1189
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:50,517
Okay, well, catch your breath.
I'm right here.

1190
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:51,727
We're gonna take our time.

1191
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:54,813
You catch your breath
and then we'll take you to a doctor, okay?

1192
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:14,291
Are you okay?

1193
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:18,254
Somebody help!
I need an ambulance, please! Somebody?

1194
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:20,256
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

1195
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,967
You're okay, you're okay.

1196
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:27,179
Let me just-- Let me catch my breath.

1197
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:29,139
I'm right here. I'm right here.

1198
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:30,724
I'm right here.

1199
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:38,774
You're okay.

1200
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:41,485
It's just me and you.

1201
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:52,745
May?

1202
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:00,253
May?

1203
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:07,886
Will you look at me, please?

1204
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:17,687
May.

1205
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:19,689
May.

1206
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:22,568
What are you doing, May?

1207
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:25,529
Please, will you just wake up
and talk to me? Please?

1208
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:50,179
Get out of the car now! Move!

1209
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:58,395
Get off, get off, get off me.

1210
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:01,565
Peter!

1211
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:03,442
- Run!
- It's just me and you, okay?

1212
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:05,402
It's just me and you, okay?

1213
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:07,237
Oh, May, I'm sorry.

1214
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:08,489
I'm so sorry.

1215
01:21:08,572 --> 01:21:12,785
- I'm so, so, so sorry. I love you.
- Parker, come out with your hands up!

1216
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:15,913
Come out right now, or we will open fire!

1217
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:16,996
Run!

1218
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:23,212
All right, let's go, let's go! Move in!

1219
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:42,189
Tragedy.

1220
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:47,528
What else can I call it?

1221
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:50,656
What more need be said?

1222
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:54,159
The damage, the destruction.

1223
01:21:54,952 --> 01:21:56,829
You saw it with your own eyes.

1224
01:21:58,372 --> 01:22:03,293
When will people wake up and realize
that everywhere Spider-Man goes,

1225
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:06,213
chaos and calamity ensue?

1226
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:11,135
Everything Spider-Man touches
comes to ruin.

1227
01:22:12,219 --> 01:22:14,221
And we, the innocents,

1228
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:16,849
are left to pick up the pieces.

1229
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:21,478
J. Jonah Jameson reporting.

1230
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:24,648
Good night, and God help us all.

1231
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:47,504
We are told
that multiple people have been injured,

1232
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:52,050
and we can confirm
at least one person has been Killed.

1233
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:53,177
Still nothing?

1234
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:55,845
No.

1235
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:12,820
I'm gonna press it.

1236
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,367
- What? No, he--
- I know he told me to wait...

1237
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,996
- but I'm gonna do it.
- I just wish--

1238
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:22,789
I just wish we could see him.

1239
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:29,171
- Ned?
- Yeah?

1240
01:23:30,214 --> 01:23:31,632
- Do that again.
- Yeah.

1241
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:35,344
I just wish we could see him.

1242
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:40,264
Okay.

1243
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,684
I just wish we could see Peter.

1244
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:51,401
Lola, you're right. I am magic.

1245
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:53,694
Is that him?

1246
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:56,823
- Yeah, yeah, it has to be.
- Peter. Peter!

1247
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:58,951
- Hey, Peter! Yeah.
- Peter!

1248
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:08,961
Hi. Hi.

1249
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:12,130
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay. I'm a nice guy.

1250
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,134
Okay.

1251
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,265
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Peter Parker.

1252
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:25,519
- That's not possible.
- I am Spider-Man, in my world.

1253
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:28,689
But then yesterday, I was--

1254
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,234
I was just here.

1255
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:40,200
String theory, multidimensional reality...

1256
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:42,995
and matter displacement.

1257
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:44,580
All real?

1258
01:24:44,663 --> 01:24:45,664
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1259
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:46,957
I knew it.

1260
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:50,460
This has to be because of the spell.

1261
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:52,838
The spell? Like magic spell?

1262
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:54,756
- There's no spell. No.
- No spell.

1263
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,592
- Magic's real here too?
- I mean--

1264
01:24:56,675 --> 01:24:58,510
- Shut up, Ned.
- No, it's not real.

1265
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:01,722
- Shut up. Stop talking.
- There's magicians, but there's no--

1266
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:03,473
Stop. Stop.

1267
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:05,601
- Prove it.
- Prove what?

1268
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:09,062
- That you're Peter Parker.
- I don't carry an ID with me, you know?

1269
01:25:09,146 --> 01:25:11,565
Kind of defeats
the whole anonymous superhero thing.

1270
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:16,462
- Why'd you do that?
- To see if you have the tingle thing.

1271
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:18,447
I have the tingle thing,
just not for bread.

1272
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:20,532
Can you not throw the bread again?

1273
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:22,868
You're a deeply mistrusting person...

1274
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:25,621
and I respect it.

1275
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:32,127
Crawl around.

1276
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:34,129
- Crawl around?
- Yes.

1277
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:35,797
- No.
- Yes, crawl around.

1278
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:37,507
- Why do I need to?
- This is not enough.

1279
01:25:37,591 --> 01:25:38,884
- This is plenty.
- No, it's not.

1280
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:40,636
- Yes, it is. It is.
- No, it's not. No.

1281
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:43,263
- How do I stick to the ceiling?
- Do it.

1282
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:46,098
Ned.

1283
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:54,983
My iota's asking if you could
just get the cobweb there.

1284
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:56,943
- Since you're, like, up there.
- Yeah.

1285
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:05,951
Thank you.

1286
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:11,749
We--

1287
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:13,043
We good?

1288
01:26:13,126 --> 01:26:14,126
For now.

1289
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:17,714
So I opened the wrong portal
to the wrong Peter Parker.

1290
01:26:17,798 --> 01:26:20,092
I guess you keep doing it
until we find the real one.

1291
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:22,094
No offense.

1292
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:24,262
- Okay.
- Okay. You got it.

1293
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,016
Find Peter Parker.

1294
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:30,143
What's the thing on his hand?

1295
01:26:30,227 --> 01:26:32,229
Find Peter Parker.

1296
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:35,774
Find Peter Parker!

1297
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:46,618
Great, it's just some random guy.

1298
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:48,494
Hello.

1299
01:26:49,329 --> 01:26:51,498
I hope it's okay,
I just came through this...

1300
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:54,376
It just closed.

1301
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:57,170
You're Peter?

1302
01:26:57,963 --> 01:27:00,173
Yeah. Peter Parker.

1303
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,969
I've seen you two--

1304
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:07,430
Hi.

1305
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:14,146
Wait. He's-- He's not your friend.

1306
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:33,248
Wait. So you're Spider-Man too?
Why didn't you just say that?

1307
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:35,834
I generally don't go around
advertising it.

1308
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:38,003
Kind of defeats
the whole anonymous superhero thing.

1309
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:39,926
- I just said that.
- That's what he just said.

1310
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:55,729
My iota's asking if you could clean up
the webs you just shot.

1311
01:27:55,812 --> 01:27:57,522
- Oh, sorry, Lola.
- Yes, of course.

1312
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:58,982
I'm going to bed.

1313
01:27:59,065 --> 01:28:01,318
- Night, Lola.
- Good night, Ned's lola.

1314
01:28:02,486 --> 01:28:04,279
This might seem kind of weird,

1315
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:07,449
but I've been trying to find
your friend ever since I got here.

1316
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:10,744
I just have this sense...

1317
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:14,164
that he needs my help.

1318
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:15,248
Our help.

1319
01:28:17,209 --> 01:28:18,293
He does.

1320
01:28:18,376 --> 01:28:20,086
We don't know where he is.

1321
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:24,174
And, honestly,
right now we're all he really has left.

1322
01:28:25,675 --> 01:28:30,680
Well, is there someplace that he might go

1323
01:28:30,764 --> 01:28:32,933
that has meaning to him?

1324
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:37,938
Like a place where he would go to just--?

1325
01:28:38,021 --> 01:28:39,523
Get away from everything?

1326
01:28:42,609 --> 01:28:45,862
For me, it was the top
of the Chrysler Building.

1327
01:28:45,946 --> 01:28:47,197
Empire State.

1328
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:50,450
- It's just a-- It's a better view.
- That is a sweet view.

1329
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:54,245
Yes.

1330
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:58,124
Yeah. I think
I know exactly where that would be.

1331
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:35,369
I'm sorry.

1332
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:44,045
Peter, there's...

1333
01:29:45,589 --> 01:29:47,090
There's some people here.

1334
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:49,592
What?

1335
01:29:58,602 --> 01:29:59,936
Hey, wait, wait, whoa.

1336
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:02,146
What...?

1337
01:30:05,108 --> 01:30:06,108
Sorry...

1338
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:08,861
about May.

1339
01:30:12,532 --> 01:30:14,618
Yeah. Sorry.

1340
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:18,705
I got some understanding
of what it is you're--

1341
01:30:18,788 --> 01:30:21,416
No, please don't tell me
that you know what I'm going through.

1342
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:23,919
- Okay.
- She's gone.

1343
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:28,298
And it's all my fault.

1344
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:33,803
She died for nothing.

1345
01:30:37,724 --> 01:30:39,844
So I'll do what I should have done
in the first place.

1346
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:41,853
- Peter--
- Please don't.

1347
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:46,232
You don't belong here. Either of you.
So I'm sending you home.

1348
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:49,986
Those other guys are
from your worlds, right?

1349
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:52,405
So you deal with it.

1350
01:30:52,489 --> 01:30:54,407
If they die, if you Kill them...

1351
01:30:55,367 --> 01:30:56,367
that's on you.

1352
01:30:57,410 --> 01:30:58,410
It's not my problem.

1353
01:30:59,245 --> 01:31:00,497
I don't care anymore.

1354
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:02,915
I'm done.

1355
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:10,006
I'm really sorry
that I dragged you into this.

1356
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:15,387
But you have to go home now.

1357
01:31:17,931 --> 01:31:18,931
Good luck.

1358
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,022
My Uncle Ben was killed.

1359
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:28,942
It was my fault.

1360
01:31:30,527 --> 01:31:31,527
I lost...

1361
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:36,116
I lost Gwen, my...

1362
01:31:37,951 --> 01:31:38,952
She was my MJ.

1363
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,039
I couldn't save her.

1364
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:47,085
I'm never gonna be able
to forgive myself for that.

1365
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:51,923
But I carried on, tried to...

1366
01:31:53,299 --> 01:31:55,552
Tried to keep going,
tried to keep being...

1367
01:31:57,303 --> 01:31:59,180
the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man

1368
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:01,433
'cause I know that's
what she would've wanted.

1369
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:05,478
But at some point,
I just stopped pulling my punches.

1370
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:10,650
I got rageful.

1371
01:32:13,153 --> 01:32:14,446
I got bitter.

1372
01:32:15,864 --> 01:32:19,909
I just don't want you to end up like me.

1373
01:32:21,703 --> 01:32:23,997
The night Ben died...

1374
01:32:25,331 --> 01:32:27,459
I hunted down the man
who I thought did it.

1375
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:30,628
I wanted him dead.

1376
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:34,966
I got what I wanted.

1377
01:32:37,427 --> 01:32:38,970
It didn't make it better.

1378
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:45,185
It took me a long time...

1379
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:48,855
to learn to get through that darkness.

1380
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:53,443
I wanna kill him.

1381
01:32:56,279 --> 01:32:57,781
I wanna tear him apart.

1382
01:33:01,826 --> 01:33:03,661
I can still hear her voice in my head.

1383
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:10,919
Even after she was hurt,

1384
01:33:11,002 --> 01:33:13,088
she said to me
that we did the right thing.

1385
01:33:22,514 --> 01:33:24,057
She told me that with great power...

1386
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:27,977
Comes great responsibility.

1387
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:34,859
Wait, what? How do you know that?

1388
01:33:34,943 --> 01:33:36,486
Uncle Ben said it.

1389
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:38,029
The day he died.

1390
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:44,828
Maybe she didn't die for nothing, Peter.

1391
01:33:54,921 --> 01:33:58,925
Okay, so Connors, Marko, Dillon and...

1392
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:03,513
I think that I can repair
the devices for Dillon and Marko,

1393
01:34:03,596 --> 01:34:04,806
but the others...

1394
01:34:05,473 --> 01:34:08,685
Oh, I got Connors.
I've cured him once, so no big deal.

1395
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:12,230
- What? It's no big deal.
- Great.

1396
01:34:13,106 --> 01:34:14,232
Yeah, that's great.

1397
01:34:16,985 --> 01:34:19,779
I think I can make an antiserum
for Dr. Osborn.

1398
01:34:20,947 --> 01:34:22,574
Been thinking about it a long time.

1399
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:28,371
Gotta cure all of them. Right?

1400
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:30,998
Right.

1401
01:34:32,584 --> 01:34:33,793
That's what we do.

1402
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:43,260
What?

1403
01:34:43,803 --> 01:34:45,180
Just three yous.

1404
01:35:03,406 --> 01:35:06,451
So... do you have a best friend too?

1405
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:09,870
I did.

1406
01:35:11,915 --> 01:35:12,915
You did?

1407
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:16,169
He died in my arms...

1408
01:35:18,129 --> 01:35:19,672
after he tried to kill me.

1409
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:23,134
It was heartbreaking.

1410
01:35:25,386 --> 01:35:26,471
Dude.

1411
01:35:33,436 --> 01:35:35,897
- Hey.
- Will you run a diagnostic?

1412
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:36,980
Yeah.

1413
01:35:46,449 --> 01:35:47,450
Hey, you okay?

1414
01:35:49,035 --> 01:35:50,745
Yeah, I'm fine. Are you okay?

1415
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:56,209
You don't deserve this.

1416
01:35:57,669 --> 01:36:00,797
- I've ruined your life. I ruined it.
- No. No, no, no.

1417
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:03,424
Look at me. I'm here.

1418
01:36:05,051 --> 01:36:06,219
Not going anywhere.

1419
01:36:08,137 --> 01:36:11,140
We'll get through this
and we'll get through it together.

1420
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:13,183
Okay?

1421
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:16,396
- Okay.
- Okay.

1422
01:36:21,484 --> 01:36:22,484
Thank you.

1423
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:35,331
You have someone?

1424
01:36:36,165 --> 01:36:37,165
No.

1425
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:42,380
I got no time
for Peter Parker stuff, you know?

1426
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:45,633
Do you?

1427
01:36:47,093 --> 01:36:49,095
That's a little complicated.

1428
01:36:50,096 --> 01:36:51,306
I understand.

1429
01:36:51,389 --> 01:36:53,766
I guess it's just not
in the cards for guys like us.

1430
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:56,519
Well, I wouldn't give up.

1431
01:36:56,602 --> 01:36:59,522
Took a while, but we made it work.

1432
01:36:59,605 --> 01:37:01,232
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1433
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:04,027
Me and... MJ.

1434
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:06,779
My MJ.

1435
01:37:08,531 --> 01:37:10,074
It gets confusing here.

1436
01:37:11,451 --> 01:37:12,285
Yeah.

1437
01:37:12,368 --> 01:37:14,370
- Peter!
- Yeah?

1438
01:37:14,454 --> 01:37:17,874
- Oh, sorry, did you mean...?
- "Peter" Peter.

1439
01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:19,792
- We're all called Peter.
- We're all Peter.

1440
01:37:19,876 --> 01:37:22,920
- Peter Parker?
- Same again. We're all Peter Parker.

1441
01:37:23,004 --> 01:37:24,130
The computer.

1442
01:37:25,882 --> 01:37:27,342
- Oh, I'm ready.
- Yeah. Me too.

1443
01:37:27,425 --> 01:37:32,430
Okay, so now, all we gotta do is lure
these guys someplace, right?

1444
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:36,017
Try to cure them
while they try to kill us,

1445
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:37,643
and then send them home.

1446
01:37:37,727 --> 01:37:40,355
- Using a magic box.
- Well, that's the plan.

1447
01:37:40,438 --> 01:37:42,940
Are you gonna go into battle
dressed as a cool youth pastor,

1448
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:44,609
or do you got your suit?

1449
01:37:46,652 --> 01:37:47,487
Good.

1450
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:50,031
- Here's your web cartridges.
- Thanks, man.

1451
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:51,324
What's that for?

1452
01:37:51,407 --> 01:37:54,243
It's my web fluid.
It's for my web shooters. Why?

1453
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:59,415
- That came out of you.
- Yeah.

1454
01:37:59,499 --> 01:38:01,167
- You can't do that, huh?
- No.

1455
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:03,002
How on earth does that even--?

1456
01:38:03,086 --> 01:38:05,838
We're getting sidetracked.
This is where we'll do this, okay?

1457
01:38:05,922 --> 01:38:07,673
It's isolated, so no one should get hurt.

1458
01:38:08,424 --> 01:38:10,903
We draw them there with the box.
It's the one thing they all want.

1459
01:38:10,927 --> 01:38:13,054
All we have to do is figure out
how to get there.

1460
01:38:13,137 --> 01:38:14,555
- We could portal there.
- What?

1461
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:17,058
- I'm magic now.
- Yeah, he's right. He can.

1462
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:18,810
- Yeah, we saw.
- Yeah, he is.

1463
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:21,187
- Wait, really?
- I got Doctor Strange magic.

1464
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:22,480
- No way.
- Yeah.

1465
01:38:23,231 --> 01:38:26,567
I promise you, I won't turn
into a supervillain and try to kill you.

1466
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:30,029
Okay.

1467
01:38:30,988 --> 01:38:32,240
Thank you.

1468
01:38:38,204 --> 01:38:40,957
Here goes nothing.
What's that thing you always say?

1469
01:38:41,666 --> 01:38:44,043
- Expect disappointment and--
- No, no, no.

1470
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:47,088
We're gonna kick some ass.

1471
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:48,172
Okay.

1472
01:38:48,881 --> 01:38:51,342
Cure. Cure some ass.

1473
01:38:51,426 --> 01:38:53,261
Cure that ass.

1474
01:38:55,721 --> 01:38:56,973
Ladies and gentlemen,

1475
01:38:57,056 --> 01:38:58,933
the Bugle tip line has
just received a call

1476
01:38:59,016 --> 01:39:02,270
from none other
than the fugitive known as Spider-Man,

1477
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:04,814
fresh from his rampage in Queens.

1478
01:39:05,565 --> 01:39:09,694
So, Peter Parker, what pernicious
propaganda are you peddling?

1479
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:11,446
- Just the truth.
- Oh, sure.

1480
01:39:11,529 --> 01:39:12,697
Truth is...

1481
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,575
that this is all my fault.

1482
01:39:16,534 --> 01:39:19,078
I accidentally brought
those dangerous people here.

1483
01:39:19,162 --> 01:39:20,830
Well, he admits it.

1484
01:39:20,913 --> 01:39:22,457
And if those people are watching...

1485
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,377
just know that I did try to help you.

1486
01:39:27,753 --> 01:39:29,297
I could have killed you...

1487
01:39:30,590 --> 01:39:32,717
at any given moment, but I didn't.

1488
01:39:34,886 --> 01:39:38,014
'Cause my Aunt May taught me
that everyone deserves a second chance.

1489
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:40,975
- That's why I'm here.
- Where is "here," exactly?

1490
01:39:42,935 --> 01:39:44,979
A place that represents second chances.

1491
01:39:47,899 --> 01:39:50,651
The Statue of Liberty? Good God, folks.

1492
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:53,988
He's about to destroy
another national landmark.

1493
01:39:54,071 --> 01:39:55,740
World, if you're watching...

1494
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:57,408
Believe me, the world is watching.

1495
01:39:58,451 --> 01:39:59,577
...wish me luck.

1496
01:40:01,537 --> 01:40:03,748
Your friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man could use some.

1497
01:40:10,296 --> 01:40:12,381
Okay, it could be any minute now.

1498
01:40:12,465 --> 01:40:14,675
Yep, almost done.

1499
01:40:19,597 --> 01:40:24,185
You know, Max was,
like, the sweetest guy ever

1500
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:26,145
before he fell into...

1501
01:40:27,063 --> 01:40:29,690
- a pool of electric eels.
- That'll do it.

1502
01:40:32,485 --> 01:40:33,819
Oh, there it goes.

1503
01:40:35,947 --> 01:40:37,114
You okay?

1504
01:40:37,198 --> 01:40:39,033
Oh, it's my back.

1505
01:40:39,116 --> 01:40:42,411
It's kind of stiff
from all the swinging, I guess.

1506
01:40:42,495 --> 01:40:44,664
- Yeah. No, I got a middle back thing too.
- Really?

1507
01:40:44,747 --> 01:40:46,874
Yeah. You want me to crack it?

1508
01:40:48,167 --> 01:40:49,418
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1509
01:40:49,502 --> 01:40:50,920
- That'd be great.
- All right.

1510
01:40:52,505 --> 01:40:53,589
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1511
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:58,511
Yep. That's good.

1512
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:00,303
How is it?

1513
01:41:02,723 --> 01:41:05,142
- That's good. That's better.
- Right? Yeah.

1514
01:41:09,397 --> 01:41:12,233
This is so cool. I always wanted brothers.

1515
01:41:13,859 --> 01:41:16,904
So you, like,
make your own web fluid in your body?

1516
01:41:16,988 --> 01:41:18,698
I'd rather not talk about this.

1517
01:41:18,781 --> 01:41:20,741
- I don't mean to--
- But are you teasing me?

1518
01:41:20,825 --> 01:41:24,662
No, no, no. He's not teasing you.
It's just that we can't do that,

1519
01:41:24,745 --> 01:41:28,249
SO we're curious as to how
your web situation works, that's all.

1520
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:31,043
If it's personal, I don't wanna pry,
but I think it's cool.

1521
01:41:31,127 --> 01:41:34,213
I-- I wish I could tell you,
but it's, like, I don't do it.

1522
01:41:34,297 --> 01:41:36,591
Like I don't do breathing.

1523
01:41:36,674 --> 01:41:38,634
Like, breathing just happens.

1524
01:41:38,718 --> 01:41:43,055
Does it just come out of your wrists,
or does it come out of anywhere else?

1525
01:41:43,139 --> 01:41:45,349
Only-- Only the wrists.

1526
01:41:45,433 --> 01:41:47,643
Never had a web block?
I run out of webs all the time.

1527
01:41:47,727 --> 01:41:50,229
- I have to make my own in a lab.
- Right. That's--

1528
01:41:50,313 --> 01:41:53,274
- It's a hassle compared to what you got.
- Sounds like a hassle.

1529
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:56,819
But I did. You said that,
I was like, "I had a web block."

1530
01:41:57,445 --> 01:41:59,905
- Why?
- Existential crisis stuff.

1531
01:41:59,989 --> 01:42:02,408
- Yeah. Don't get me started on that.
- Hey.

1532
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:06,037
What are some of the craziest villains
that you guys have fought?

1533
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:08,831
- Seems you've met some of them.
- That's a good question.

1534
01:42:08,914 --> 01:42:14,253
Yeah, I fought an alien
made out of black goo once.

1535
01:42:14,337 --> 01:42:16,422
Oh, no way. I fought an alien too.

1536
01:42:16,505 --> 01:42:18,215
On Earth and in space.

1537
01:42:18,299 --> 01:42:20,092
- He was purple.
- I wanna fight an alien.

1538
01:42:20,176 --> 01:42:23,929
I'm still, like, that you fought
an alien in space.

1539
01:42:24,847 --> 01:42:29,060
I'm lame compared-- I fought
a Russian guy in a rhinoceros machine.

1540
01:42:29,143 --> 01:42:31,854
Can we rewind it back
to the "I'm lame" part?

1541
01:42:31,937 --> 01:42:33,147
'Cause you are not.

1542
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:35,316
Thanks. I appreciate that.
I'm not saying I am--

1543
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:37,360
But it's just the self-talk.
Maybe we should...

1544
01:42:37,443 --> 01:42:40,196
- Listen, I--
- 'Cause you're amazing.

1545
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:42,198
Just to take it in for a minute.

1546
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:44,784
- Yeah, I can take it in.
- You are amazing.

1547
01:42:44,867 --> 01:42:46,577
- I can. Thank you.
- You are amazing.

1548
01:42:46,661 --> 01:42:49,705
- Will you say it?
- I needed to hear that. Thank you.

1549
01:42:50,206 --> 01:42:52,625
All right, guys, focus up. You feel that?

1550
01:42:52,708 --> 01:42:53,708
Yeah.

1551
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:02,218
What's up, Peter?

1552
01:43:05,304 --> 01:43:06,806
How you like the new-new?

1553
01:43:07,973 --> 01:43:11,852
Look, you give it to me,
I'm gonna destroy it.

1554
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:14,480
But I'll let you live.

1555
01:43:15,147 --> 01:43:16,691
Don't make me a murderer, Peter.

1556
01:43:19,568 --> 01:43:20,945
Okay, guys, here he comes.

1557
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:30,204
Hey, Max! I missed you, man.

1558
01:43:33,499 --> 01:43:35,042
All right, MJ, heads up!

1559
01:43:36,085 --> 01:43:37,253
Got it. Close it.

1560
01:43:41,298 --> 01:43:43,384
- Ned, it's not closing.
- Yeah, I know.

1561
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:45,052
- Why isn't it closing?
- I don't know.

1562
01:43:45,136 --> 01:43:48,180
- Did you close it before? No?
- I mean, I've opened some.

1563
01:43:57,106 --> 01:43:59,525
Max, Max, Max. Can we talk for a second?

1564
01:43:59,608 --> 01:44:01,694
- Just you and me, just talk?
- Look who showed up.

1565
01:44:02,403 --> 01:44:03,696
My old friend Spider-Man.

1566
01:44:03,779 --> 01:44:05,740
I'm trying to save you.
That's all I've wanted.

1567
01:44:05,823 --> 01:44:07,408
- You're not trying to save me.
- I am.

1568
01:44:07,491 --> 01:44:09,285
You ain't even the shit no more.

1569
01:44:10,119 --> 01:44:12,705
Don't worry about me. I'll save myself.

1570
01:44:13,414 --> 01:44:14,540
Burn up!

1571
01:44:16,208 --> 01:44:17,835
Well, I got his attention. Now what?

1572
01:44:17,918 --> 01:44:19,420
Okay, great.

1573
01:44:20,379 --> 01:44:23,174
Just FYI, lizard guy's here too.

1574
01:44:24,884 --> 01:44:26,302
Guys, comm check. Hello?

1575
01:44:27,511 --> 01:44:30,097
- I need Max's cure!
- Yeah. I'm on it.

1576
01:44:31,056 --> 01:44:32,475
Peter, I need the Lizard cure.

1577
01:44:33,392 --> 01:44:34,435
Okay, okay.

1578
01:44:39,774 --> 01:44:41,484
Where's the box, Peter?

1579
01:44:41,567 --> 01:44:44,361
- Flint, we could help everyone.
- I don't care.

1580
01:44:55,748 --> 01:44:56,748
Sorry!

1581
01:44:58,209 --> 01:44:59,293
Gross!

1582
01:44:59,376 --> 01:45:02,046
Sad to tell you, Sandman,
nobody's going home.

1583
01:45:40,459 --> 01:45:42,795
What the hell is going on out there?

1584
01:45:42,878 --> 01:45:44,630
I keep yelling at you, Peter 2!

1585
01:45:44,713 --> 01:45:47,842
- But I thought you were Peter 2.
- What? I'm not Peter 2.

1586
01:45:47,925 --> 01:45:50,177
Stop arguing, both of you!
Listen to Peter 1.

1587
01:45:50,261 --> 01:45:53,180
- We're clearly not very good at this.
- I know, I know. We suck.

1588
01:45:53,264 --> 01:45:56,100
- I don't know how to work as a team.
- Me neither.

1589
01:45:56,183 --> 01:45:58,143
I do. I've been in a team, okay?

1590
01:45:58,227 --> 01:46:00,855
I don't wanna brag, but I will.
I was in the Avengers.

1591
01:46:00,938 --> 01:46:02,273
- The Avengers?
- Yeah.

1592
01:46:02,356 --> 01:46:03,566
- That's great.
- Thank you.

1593
01:46:03,649 --> 01:46:04,649
What is that?

1594
01:46:05,693 --> 01:46:06,902
You don't have the Avengers?

1595
01:46:06,986 --> 01:46:08,487
Is that a band? Are you in a band?

1596
01:46:08,571 --> 01:46:11,949
No, I'm not in a band.
The Avengers is Earth's mightiest--

1597
01:46:12,032 --> 01:46:13,784
- How's this helping?
- It's not important.

1598
01:46:13,868 --> 01:46:15,703
All we gotta do is focus,
trust your tingle,

1599
01:46:15,786 --> 01:46:17,204
and coordinate our attacks.

1600
01:46:17,288 --> 01:46:19,999
Yes. Okay. Let's pick one target.

1601
01:46:20,082 --> 01:46:22,459
- Right.
- We take them off the board one at a time.

1602
01:46:22,543 --> 01:46:25,129
- You got it. Okay, Peter 1, Peter 2.
- Peter 2.

1603
01:46:25,212 --> 01:46:26,505
- Peter 3.
- Peter 3.

1604
01:46:26,589 --> 01:46:28,507
- Let's do this. Ready?
- Wait, wait, wait!

1605
01:46:29,466 --> 01:46:30,676
I love you guys.

1606
01:46:33,345 --> 01:46:34,471
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1607
01:46:36,098 --> 01:46:37,641
- All right, let's do this.
- Let's go.

1608
01:47:07,588 --> 01:47:08,672
Okay, Spider-Mans.

1609
01:47:09,632 --> 01:47:11,091
Sandman’s first.

1610
01:47:12,259 --> 01:47:15,095
- I'm gonna lead him inside the statue.
- I'll meet you at the top.

1611
01:47:18,057 --> 01:47:19,433
- Come on!
- Hey!

1612
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:25,731
- Hey, Dr. Connors.
- Hello, Peter.

1613
01:47:27,024 --> 01:47:28,233
Peter 1!

1614
01:47:28,317 --> 01:47:29,317
I got it!

1615
01:47:40,913 --> 01:47:43,374
Flint, we're trying to help you!

1616
01:47:45,459 --> 01:47:47,127
Guys, I'm at the top!

1617
01:47:47,211 --> 01:47:48,337
I need the cure!

1618
01:47:50,881 --> 01:47:52,424
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

1619
01:47:54,385 --> 01:47:58,222
Just wait your turn, doc!

1620
01:47:58,305 --> 01:47:59,431
I'll be right back.

1621
01:48:36,677 --> 01:48:37,886
It's okay, Flint.

1622
01:48:40,139 --> 01:48:41,765
We're gonna get you home.

1623
01:48:42,558 --> 01:48:44,476
You just stay right here.

1624
01:48:49,648 --> 01:48:51,942
How do we stop him?
I've never seen him this powerful.

1625
01:48:52,026 --> 01:48:54,111
It's the arc reactor.
We gotta get it off him.

1626
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:55,594
You're not gonna take this from me.

1627
01:48:58,699 --> 01:48:59,699
That's not gonna work.

1628
01:49:04,913 --> 01:49:06,540
We gotta do this up close.

1629
01:49:06,623 --> 01:49:09,460
Peter 2, go right.
Peter 3, go left. On me.

1630
01:49:14,506 --> 01:49:15,506
Yeah!

1631
01:49:36,987 --> 01:49:40,157
I'm trying to close it.
I can't help that it's not working.

1632
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:43,077
It's fine. You'll do it again.
We'll keep trying.

1633
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:46,288
- All right, we got this.
- Focus and close the portal.

1634
01:49:49,625 --> 01:49:51,376
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1635
01:49:51,460 --> 01:49:54,004
And that is a lizard and we should go!

1636
01:49:58,592 --> 01:49:59,592
Run!

1637
01:50:00,427 --> 01:50:02,888
Come on! Come on, this way!
Quick, quick, quick!

1638
01:50:02,971 --> 01:50:04,223
Connors, stop!

1639
01:50:13,607 --> 01:50:14,733
Yeah.

1640
01:50:27,204 --> 01:50:29,748
Leave them. They're mine.

1641
01:50:29,832 --> 01:50:32,417
I don't need your help.
I got it just fine.

1642
01:50:32,501 --> 01:50:34,670
Dr. Octavius, no.

1643
01:50:37,256 --> 01:50:38,632
What are you doing?

1644
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:41,510
Get it off of me.

1645
01:50:52,479 --> 01:50:53,605
There you go.

1646
01:51:12,833 --> 01:51:13,833
MJ!

1647
01:51:26,096 --> 01:51:27,848
- We gotta hide this thing.
- Oh, right.

1648
01:51:32,102 --> 01:51:33,729
- Nice, Ned!
- Yeah!

1649
01:51:37,399 --> 01:51:38,317
Where is he?

1650
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:39,943
- No!
- Wait, wait, wait.

1651
01:51:40,027 --> 01:51:44,072
Before you do anything, Mister--
Doctor Strange, Peter's plan is working.

1652
01:51:44,156 --> 01:51:45,908
- What plan?
- He's curing them.

1653
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:56,084
Dr. Connors?

1654
01:51:59,504 --> 01:52:00,589
Welcome back, sir.

1655
01:52:02,674 --> 01:52:03,926
Well, I'll be damned.

1656
01:52:06,887 --> 01:52:08,513
Did you just open a portal?

1657
01:52:09,514 --> 01:52:10,682
Yes, sir, I did.

1658
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:19,483
Max?

1659
01:52:20,651 --> 01:52:22,194
Max?

1660
01:52:22,277 --> 01:52:25,405
- Don't worry. I'm all tapped out.
- Are you sure about that?

1661
01:52:27,366 --> 01:52:28,659
Back to being a nobody.

1662
01:52:28,742 --> 01:52:32,037
- You were never a nobody, Max.
- Yes, I was.

1663
01:52:32,663 --> 01:52:33,747
You didn't see me.

1664
01:52:35,290 --> 01:52:37,960
- Can I tell you something though?
- Yeah.

1665
01:52:39,002 --> 01:52:40,754
You got a nice face. You're just a kid.

1666
01:52:42,256 --> 01:52:43,423
You're from Queens.

1667
01:52:44,549 --> 01:52:47,803
You got that suit.
You help a lot of poor people.

1668
01:52:47,886 --> 01:52:49,721
I just thought you was gonna be Black.

1669
01:52:50,931 --> 01:52:53,308
- Oh, man, I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

1670
01:52:53,392 --> 01:52:55,811
There's gotta be a Black Spider-Man
somewhere out there.

1671
01:52:59,273 --> 01:53:00,482
Goddamn eels.

1672
01:53:04,236 --> 01:53:05,654
The power of the sun.

1673
01:53:08,907 --> 01:53:10,409
In the palm of your hand.

1674
01:53:10,492 --> 01:53:11,702
Peter?

1675
01:53:14,288 --> 01:53:15,288
Otto.

1676
01:53:17,082 --> 01:53:18,792
Oh, it's good to see you, dear boy.

1677
01:53:19,710 --> 01:53:21,086
It's good to see you.

1678
01:53:21,878 --> 01:53:23,088
You're all grown up.

1679
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:25,882
How are you?

1680
01:53:28,176 --> 01:53:29,219
Trying to do better.

1681
01:53:36,643 --> 01:53:38,520
- Strange, wait, we're so close.
- Skip it!

1682
01:53:38,603 --> 01:53:41,398
I've been dangling
over the Grand Canyon for 12 hours.

1683
01:53:41,481 --> 01:53:43,150
I know, I know, I know. I-

1684
01:53:45,402 --> 01:53:47,237
I'm sorry about that, sir. I mean...

1685
01:53:47,321 --> 01:53:50,324
- You went to the Grand Canyon?
- He could have used your help.

1686
01:53:50,407 --> 01:53:52,576
It's okay. These are my new friends.

1687
01:53:52,659 --> 01:53:55,120
This is Peter Parker, Peter Parker.
Spider-Man, Spider-Man.

1688
01:53:55,203 --> 01:53:56,788
They're mes from other universes.

1689
01:53:56,872 --> 01:53:59,624
They're here to help.
This is the wizard I told you about.

1690
01:53:59,708 --> 01:54:03,045
I am really impressed that you've managed
to give them all a second chance, kid.

1691
01:54:04,254 --> 01:54:06,381
But this has to end. Now.

1692
01:54:06,465 --> 01:54:09,843
Can the Spider-Man come out to play?

1693
01:54:31,782 --> 01:54:32,991
Strange, no!

1694
01:55:02,270 --> 01:55:03,480
Are you okay?

1695
01:55:04,564 --> 01:55:05,440
Yeah.

1696
01:55:05,524 --> 01:55:06,691
I'm okay.

1697
01:55:09,694 --> 01:55:10,821
Are you okay?

1698
01:56:28,356 --> 01:56:29,858
Thank you, Mr. Cape, sir.

1699
01:56:33,195 --> 01:56:34,195
Ned?

1700
01:56:35,447 --> 01:56:36,490
- Ned!
- Hey!

1701
01:56:41,119 --> 01:56:42,037
MJ!

1702
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:43,288
Peter?

1703
01:56:43,371 --> 01:56:45,207
- Ned!
- Peter!

1704
01:56:46,082 --> 01:56:47,250
Hey!

1705
01:56:47,334 --> 01:56:49,377
- Are you okay?
- We're okay!

1706
01:57:03,517 --> 01:57:04,768
Poor Peter.

1707
01:57:05,519 --> 01:57:09,022
Too weak to send me home to die.

1708
01:57:09,773 --> 01:57:10,773
No.

1709
01:57:11,483 --> 01:57:13,193
I just wanna kill you myself.

1710
01:57:14,027 --> 01:57:15,027
Attaboy.

1711
01:59:05,221 --> 01:59:06,556
She was there...

1712
01:59:07,557 --> 01:59:09,559
because of you.

1713
01:59:09,643 --> 01:59:11,895
I may have struck the blow,

1714
01:59:12,812 --> 01:59:14,230
but you...

1715
01:59:17,651 --> 01:59:20,862
You are the one that killed her.

1716
01:59:47,806 --> 01:59:48,806
Peter.

1717
02:00:02,278 --> 02:00:03,488
What have I done?

1718
02:00:07,575 --> 02:00:09,285
- It's you.
- You okay?

1719
02:00:10,787 --> 02:00:12,622
Yeah, I'm good. I've been stabbed before.

1720
02:00:12,706 --> 02:00:14,332
- Oh, good, good, good.
- Hey.

1721
02:00:14,416 --> 02:00:16,793
- Oh, man.
- Hey, nice catch.

1722
02:00:17,919 --> 02:00:18,919
Nice throw.

1723
02:00:21,423 --> 02:00:25,802
- What? Is that happening, or am I dying?
- Yeah, no, that's happening. That's real.

1724
02:00:25,885 --> 02:00:27,637
Are there people in the sky?

1725
02:00:36,354 --> 02:00:38,606
- I gotta go.
- Yeah. I got it. You okay?

1726
02:00:43,111 --> 02:00:44,404
What's happening?

1727
02:00:44,487 --> 02:00:46,698
They're starting to come through.
I can't stop them.

1728
02:00:46,781 --> 02:00:49,826
There's gotta be something we could do.
Can't you just cast the spell again?

1729
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:53,496
- The original way, before I screwed it up.
- We're too late for that. They're here.

1730
02:00:54,581 --> 02:00:56,624
They're here because of you.

1731
02:01:02,088 --> 02:01:03,590
What if everyone forgot who I was?

1732
02:01:03,673 --> 02:01:06,342
- What?
- They're coming here because of me, right?

1733
02:01:06,426 --> 02:01:07,969
Because I'm Peter Parker?

1734
02:01:08,511 --> 02:01:09,721
So cast a new spell.

1735
02:01:09,804 --> 02:01:12,223
But this time, make everyone forget
who Peter Parker is.

1736
02:01:12,307 --> 02:01:13,683
Make everyone forget...

1737
02:01:15,643 --> 02:01:17,061
- me.
- No.

1738
02:01:17,145 --> 02:01:19,939
- But it would work, right?
- Yeah, it would work.

1739
02:01:21,357 --> 02:01:23,943
But you gotta understand
that would mean that everyone

1740
02:01:24,027 --> 02:01:26,571
who knows and loves you, we...

1741
02:01:28,740 --> 02:01:30,617
We'd have no memory of you.

1742
02:01:32,410 --> 02:01:34,245
It would be as though you never existed.

1743
02:01:37,624 --> 02:01:38,624
I know.

1744
02:01:40,502 --> 02:01:41,795
Do it.

1745
02:01:45,423 --> 02:01:48,092
You better go and say your goodbyes.
You don't have long.

1746
02:01:48,718 --> 02:01:50,762
- Thank you, sir.
- Call me Stephen.

1747
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:55,432
Thank you, Stephen.

1748
02:01:57,352 --> 02:02:00,146
Yeah. Still feels weird.

1749
02:02:02,816 --> 02:02:04,108
I'll see you around.

1750
02:02:05,944 --> 02:02:06,986
So long, kid.

1751
02:02:14,994 --> 02:02:15,994
Hey.

1752
02:02:16,955 --> 02:02:19,499
I think this is it.
I think you're about to go home.

1753
02:02:19,582 --> 02:02:21,084
- Okay.
- All right.

1754
02:02:21,167 --> 02:02:22,168
Look, I...

1755
02:02:24,587 --> 02:02:25,588
Thank you.

1756
02:02:26,506 --> 02:02:29,634
I just wanna-- I want you to--
I wanna tell you that--

1757
02:02:30,343 --> 02:02:32,303
I don't know how to say this. I--

1758
02:02:32,387 --> 02:02:34,055
- Peter.
- I want you to know that I...

1759
02:02:35,765 --> 02:02:38,268
You know. It's what we do.

1760
02:02:40,144 --> 02:02:41,479
Yeah, it's what we do.

1761
02:02:43,064 --> 02:02:45,483
Right, I gotta find Ned and MJ. I--

1762
02:02:47,026 --> 02:02:49,028
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1763
02:02:53,408 --> 02:02:55,910
- I guess ['ll see you.
- See you.

1764
02:02:55,994 --> 02:02:56,994
Bye.

1765
02:03:00,123 --> 02:03:01,374
You're in so much pain, huh?

1766
02:03:01,457 --> 02:03:02,584
- I am.
- Yeah.

1767
02:03:06,671 --> 02:03:07,922
Oh, you're okay.

1768
02:03:09,674 --> 02:03:10,800
So proud of you.

1769
02:03:11,885 --> 02:03:14,220
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, we're okay.

1770
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:16,723
- Oh, my God, you're bleeding.
- I'm fine. I'm okay.

1771
02:03:16,806 --> 02:03:18,224
- You sure?
- I'm fine, I promise.

1772
02:03:18,892 --> 02:03:20,143
- Okay, okay.
- I promise.

1773
02:03:20,226 --> 02:03:21,226
Good.

1774
02:03:22,770 --> 02:03:24,939
We should go, right?

1775
02:03:27,483 --> 02:03:30,278
Yeah. You're gonna forget who I am.

1776
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:34,574
- What?
- Forget? What are you talking about?

1777
02:03:35,992 --> 02:03:40,705
It's okay. I'm gonna come and find you,
and I'll explain everything.

1778
02:03:42,624 --> 02:03:44,167
I'll make you remember me.

1779
02:03:45,001 --> 02:03:48,087
And it'll be like none of this
ever happened. Okay?

1780
02:03:48,171 --> 02:03:51,507
But what if that doesn't work?
What if that doesn't work?

1781
02:03:51,591 --> 02:03:53,968
What if we can't remember you?
I don't wanna do that.

1782
02:03:54,719 --> 02:03:57,597
- I don't wanna do that.
- I know. MJ, I know.

1783
02:03:57,680 --> 02:04:01,142
There's not something we can do?
We can't come up with a plan?

1784
02:04:01,225 --> 02:04:02,727
There's always something we can do.

1785
02:04:04,854 --> 02:04:06,064
There's nothing we can do.

1786
02:04:10,693 --> 02:04:11,778
But it'll be okay.

1787
02:04:16,282 --> 02:04:17,282
You promise?

1788
02:04:20,286 --> 02:04:21,579
Yeah, I promise.

1789
02:04:33,007 --> 02:04:34,509
I'll come find you, okay?

1790
02:04:35,134 --> 02:04:36,386
I know you will.

1791
02:04:37,887 --> 02:04:38,972
- Okay.
- Okay.

1792
02:04:41,391 --> 02:04:42,684
You better.

1793
02:04:44,644 --> 02:04:48,439
If you don't, I'll just figure it out.
I've done it before, I can do it again.

1794
02:04:50,149 --> 02:04:51,651
I promise, I'll fix this.

1795
02:04:53,027 --> 02:04:54,278
I really hate magic.

1796
02:04:55,989 --> 02:04:57,115
Yeah. Me too.

1797
02:05:01,869 --> 02:05:02,954
I love you.

1798
02:05:09,377 --> 02:05:10,795
- I love--
- Just wait.

1799
02:05:12,005 --> 02:05:14,340
Wait and tell me when you see me again.

1800
02:05:16,342 --> 02:05:17,342
Sure.

1801
02:06:44,972 --> 02:06:45,972
I love you.

1802
02:07:24,971 --> 02:07:28,015
It's been a few weeks
since the fiasco on the Statue of Liberty,

1803
02:07:28,099 --> 02:07:31,060
and Spider-Man's cultists
continue to contend

1804
02:07:31,144 --> 02:07:33,604
that the vile vigilante is a hero.

1805
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:38,651
If he were a hero, he'd unmask himself
and tell us who he really is

1806
02:07:38,734 --> 02:07:42,238
because only a coward
conceals his identity.

1807
02:07:42,321 --> 02:07:45,491
Only a coward hides his true intentions.

1808
02:07:45,575 --> 02:07:47,660
Rest assured, ladies and gentlemen,

1809
02:07:47,743 --> 02:07:52,039
this reporter will uncover
those intentions, come hell or high water.

1810
02:07:52,123 --> 02:07:55,710
Hi. My name is Peter Parker.
You don't know me, but I...

1811
02:07:58,462 --> 02:08:01,048
Hi, my name is Peter Parker,
and you don't know me, but you--

1812
02:08:04,844 --> 02:08:05,928
Okay, come on.

1813
02:08:08,306 --> 02:08:09,932
- No way.
- Hard to believe, isn't it?

1814
02:08:19,692 --> 02:08:20,693
Hey.

1815
02:08:26,157 --> 02:08:28,618
One sec. Can I help you?

1816
02:08:28,701 --> 02:08:29,701
Hi.

1817
02:08:30,411 --> 02:08:33,080
My name is Peter Parker, and I...

1818
02:08:36,792 --> 02:08:39,462
would like a coffee, please.

1819
02:08:40,254 --> 02:08:42,465
Okay, no problem, Peter Parker.

1820
02:08:49,055 --> 02:08:51,432
Doughnut for my fellow Engineer.

1821
02:08:52,516 --> 02:08:55,353
- Wait, what?
- MIT, they're the Engineers. The mascot.

1822
02:08:55,436 --> 02:08:57,939
Oh, right, right, right.
I should probably know that.

1823
02:08:58,022 --> 02:09:02,026
- Look at you with the school spirit.
- Tell anybody, I will deny it.

1824
02:09:02,109 --> 02:09:03,319
Oh, okay.

1825
02:09:13,496 --> 02:09:15,706
Peter Parker? Peter Parker.

1826
02:09:16,457 --> 02:09:17,625
Your coffee.

1827
02:09:17,708 --> 02:09:19,001
Right. Thank you.

1828
02:09:22,088 --> 02:09:23,547
Are you excited for MIT?

1829
02:09:25,049 --> 02:09:27,176
Oh, right. Yeah.

1830
02:09:28,678 --> 02:09:30,721
Yeah, I am excited, which is weird

1831
02:09:30,805 --> 02:09:33,140
'cause I don't really
get excited about things,

1832
02:09:33,224 --> 02:09:34,892
I kind of expect disappointment.

1833
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:37,270
'Cause then you'll never
actually be disappointed.

1834
02:09:38,187 --> 02:09:39,187
Right?

1835
02:09:42,024 --> 02:09:43,776
Yeah. Right.

1836
02:09:45,111 --> 02:09:49,031
I don't know, it kind of feels different
this time for some reason.

1837
02:09:59,959 --> 02:10:00,959
Right.

1838
02:10:02,628 --> 02:10:03,629
What I was--

1839
02:10:13,222 --> 02:10:14,222
You okay?

1840
02:10:15,516 --> 02:10:17,059
It doesn't really hurt anymore.

1841
02:10:28,279 --> 02:10:30,281
Is there anything else?

1842
02:10:43,044 --> 02:10:44,044
No.

1843
02:10:47,798 --> 02:10:48,841
Thank you.

1844
02:10:49,842 --> 02:10:50,842
No problem.

1845
02:10:57,224 --> 02:10:58,434
I'll see you around.

1846
02:12:03,833 --> 02:12:04,959
How'd you know her?

1847
02:12:08,879 --> 02:12:10,047
Through Spider-Man.

1848
02:12:11,048 --> 02:12:11,966
You?

1849
02:12:12,049 --> 02:12:13,092
Same.

1850
02:12:18,681 --> 02:12:20,474
I lost a good friend a while back.

1851
02:12:21,350 --> 02:12:22,351
Felt like this.

1852
02:12:25,312 --> 02:12:27,731
Hurts 'cause they're gone
and then it hurts all over again

1853
02:12:27,815 --> 02:12:29,483
because you remember
what they stood for

1854
02:12:29,567 --> 02:12:32,611
and you wonder, "Is all that gone too?"

1855
02:12:37,450 --> 02:12:38,701
No, it's not gone.

1856
02:12:41,745 --> 02:12:43,372
Everyone that she helped...

1857
02:12:45,833 --> 02:12:46,959
they'll keep it going.

1858
02:12:48,335 --> 02:12:49,545
You really think so?

1859
02:12:50,838 --> 02:12:51,839
I know it.

1860
02:12:54,008 --> 02:12:57,386
- Take care of yourself, okay?
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.

1861
02:13:04,810 --> 02:13:08,063
Rent is due on the first
of the month. Don't be late.

1862
02:13:59,573 --> 02:14:01,784
Four-three-Edward, do you need EMS assist?

1863
02:14:01,867 --> 02:14:02,868
Negative, Central.

1864
02:14:03,702 --> 02:14:04,954
We're gonna need a car tow.

1865
02:17:19,732 --> 02:17:20,732
Okay.

1866
02:17:22,276 --> 02:17:23,777
Okay, I think I got this.

1867
02:17:23,861 --> 02:17:27,573
You're saying that this whole place here,

1868
02:17:27,656 --> 02:17:29,575
it's just tons of...

1869
02:17:30,743 --> 02:17:32,119
super people.

1870
02:17:32,202 --> 02:17:34,913
And he has been saying it for hours.

1871
02:17:35,706 --> 02:17:38,834
All right, tell me again.
I'm sorry, I'm an idiot.

1872
02:17:38,917 --> 02:17:42,755
There was a billionaire,
he had a tin suit and he could fly, right?

1873
02:17:45,090 --> 02:17:48,093
Okay, and there was
a really angry green man.

1874
02:17:48,177 --> 02:17:49,720
- Hulk.
- Hulk.

1875
02:17:49,803 --> 02:17:52,181
And you thought
Lethal Protector was a shit name.

1876
02:17:52,264 --> 02:17:54,308
Yeah, because it is.

1877
02:17:54,391 --> 02:17:58,729
Now tell me again about
your purple alien that loves stones.

1878
02:17:58,812 --> 02:18:01,482
'Cause I'll tell you what, man,
aliens do not love stones.

1879
02:18:01,565 --> 02:18:03,567
- Eddie, don't start.
- They don't.

1880
02:18:03,650 --> 02:18:05,652
Know what aliens love? Eating brains.

1881
02:18:05,736 --> 02:18:07,905
Because that's what they do. All right?

1882
02:18:07,988 --> 02:18:10,616
Senor, he made my family disappear.

1883
02:18:12,034 --> 02:18:13,076
For five years.

1884
02:18:14,495 --> 02:18:15,537
Five years?

1885
02:18:17,831 --> 02:18:18,957
That's a long time.

1886
02:18:21,627 --> 02:18:22,961
Maybe I...

1887
02:18:23,045 --> 02:18:25,756
Maybe I should go to New York
and speak to this...

1888
02:18:27,299 --> 02:18:28,300
Spider-Man.

1889
02:18:28,383 --> 02:18:31,428
Eddie, we are drunk.

1890
02:18:33,263 --> 02:18:35,724
- Let's go skinny-dip!
- I don't think we should skinny-dip.

1891
02:18:35,808 --> 02:18:36,934
You have to pay the bill.

1892
02:18:37,726 --> 02:18:39,061
What is happening? No!

1893
02:18:39,144 --> 02:18:41,522
No, we just got here! No, not again!

1894
02:18:46,193 --> 02:18:47,361
And there he goes.

1895
02:18:48,070 --> 02:18:50,989
Without paying the bill, no tips, nothing.

1896
02:26:01,544 --> 02:26:03,546
Don't cast that spell.

1897
02:26:03,630 --> 02:26:05,632
- It's too dangerous.
- Why?

1898
02:26:05,715 --> 02:26:08,551
We tampered with
the stability of space-time.

1899
02:26:09,135 --> 02:26:14,099
The multiverse is a concept
about which we know frighteningly little.

1900
02:26:16,059 --> 02:26:17,978
Your desecration of reality...

1901
02:26:19,312 --> 02:26:20,647
will not go unpunished.

1902
02:26:26,569 --> 02:26:27,904
It was the only way.

1903
02:26:33,118 --> 02:26:37,580
But I never meant
for any of this to happen.

1904
02:26:56,474 --> 02:26:57,474
Wanda.

1905
02:26:59,602 --> 02:27:02,188
Well, I knew sooner or later
you'd show up.

1906
02:27:03,189 --> 02:27:06,026
I made mistakes, and people were hurt.

1907
02:27:06,109 --> 02:27:08,445
I'm not here to talk about Westview.

1908
02:27:09,446 --> 02:27:10,739
Then what are you here for?

1909
02:27:10,822 --> 02:27:11,823
We need your help.

1910
02:27:13,325 --> 02:27:14,576
With what?

1911
02:27:14,659 --> 02:27:16,286
What do you know about the multiverse?

1912
02:27:25,170 --> 02:27:26,338
I'm sorry, Stephen.

1913
02:27:28,798 --> 02:27:31,051
I hope you understand...

1914
02:27:33,720 --> 02:27:35,430
the greatest threat...

1915
02:27:36,681 --> 02:27:38,058
to our universe...

1916
02:27:46,566 --> 02:27:47,776
is you.

1917
02:27:50,612 --> 02:27:53,239
Things just got out of hand.
