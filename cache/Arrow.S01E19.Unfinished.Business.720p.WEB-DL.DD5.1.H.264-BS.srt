1
00:00:01,187 --> 00:00:04,540
My name is Oliver Queen.
For 5 years,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,824
I was stranded on an island
with only one goal--

3
00:00:07,826 --> 00:00:09,993
survive.

4
00:00:09,995 --> 00:00:11,811
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,813 --> 00:00:14,414
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:16,583
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:20,003
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:23,941
To do this, I must
become someone else.

9
00:00:23,943 --> 00:00:27,427
I must become something else.

10
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:28,845
<i>Previously on</i> Arrow...

11
00:00:28,847 --> 00:00:30,380
Who supplies you with Vertigo?

12
00:00:30,382 --> 00:00:31,831
They call him the Count!

13
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:36,637
56 people died
to perfect this high.

14
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:39,957
I've never seen anyone od on
this much Vertigo and live.

15
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:42,059
The police never caught
your brother's shooter.

16
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:43,716
The bullets were laced
with curare, that's

17
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:45,480
Floyd Lawton's M.O.

18
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:47,698
- Lawton's alive.
- I'm sorry, John.

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,983
This Lawton guy
kick his dog or something?

20
00:00:49,985 --> 00:00:53,070
He killed his brother.

21
00:01:40,084 --> 00:01:42,068
How we doing?

22
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,688
We're in the black,
and the green.

23
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,041
I like how we've gone from throwing
money at clubs to catching it.

24
00:01:48,043 --> 00:01:49,876
Oh, look at these.

25
00:01:49,878 --> 00:01:51,745
What sort of business
has a lost and found

26
00:01:51,747 --> 00:01:53,630
that's just filled
with women's underwear?

27
00:01:53,632 --> 00:01:55,132
The best business ever?

28
00:01:55,134 --> 00:01:57,517
Ohh, having this much fun
should be against the law.

29
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,586
Oh, if wishing made it so.

30
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:01,421
Sorry, am I
interrupting anything?

31
00:02:01,423 --> 00:02:03,774
- Is Laurel ok?
- She's fine.

32
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:05,642
This visit is about
something else.

33
00:02:05,644 --> 00:02:08,612
A girl just got mowed down
a couple blocks from here.

34
00:02:08,614 --> 00:02:11,715
On Starling bridge.

35
00:02:11,717 --> 00:02:13,533
Ring any bells with you two?

36
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:15,569
- No.
- Should she?

37
00:02:17,655 --> 00:02:18,955
She was in your club tonight.

38
00:02:18,957 --> 00:02:20,123
A lot of people were.

39
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,541
You think someone killed her?

40
00:02:21,543 --> 00:02:22,942
Not someone.

41
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:24,578
Something.

42
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,713
Vertigo.

43
00:02:26,715 --> 00:02:30,050
Yeah. You got a problem
with that in this club?

44
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:31,785
Not that I'm aware of.

45
00:02:31,787 --> 00:02:34,087
We don't allow drugs
in here, Detective.

46
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:39,125
Control your clientele.

47
00:02:39,127 --> 00:02:41,645
Before anyone else
wanders into traffic.

48
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:47,567
Is there any chance she could
have scored the drugs in here?

49
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:50,404
I doubt it. I try not
to hire too many drug dealers.

50
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:51,971
Get me a list
of employees, anyway.

51
00:02:51,973 --> 00:02:53,874
I'll have Felicity cross reference
it for drug arrests.

52
00:02:53,876 --> 00:02:56,493
That includes
the two of us, you know.

53
00:02:56,495 --> 00:03:00,113
I thought the Vigilante
finished off the Count.

54
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:03,884
I did.

55
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:06,986
I just need to ask him
a few questions, Doc.

56
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:08,789
Well, you're welcome
to try, Detective,

57
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,173
but I'm not sure you'll get
very far with him.

58
00:03:10,174 --> 00:03:11,224
What does that mean?

59
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:13,249
Is this a load about
doctor-patient privilege?

60
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:16,046
No, far from it. The unrefined
Vertigo overdose he suffered

61
00:03:16,048 --> 00:03:19,383
caused damage to the caudal portion
of his anterior cingulate.

62
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:20,851
Well, you'll probably be
shocked to hear

63
00:03:20,853 --> 00:03:22,386
that I didn't go
to medical school.

64
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:23,987
I've been working
with him for months now.

65
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:26,606
And all I've gotten
out of him is word salad

66
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:28,608
and the occasional
spit in the face.

67
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,644
- Best of luck to you.
- Thanks.

68
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:38,735
Here I was born,
and there I died.

69
00:03:38,737 --> 00:03:41,538
It was only a moment for you.

70
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,708
You took no notice.

71
00:03:48,697 --> 00:03:51,081
A woman died tonight...

72
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,716
from your poison.

73
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:55,202
Lots of women die,
lots of nights,

74
00:03:55,204 --> 00:03:57,487
for lots of reasons.

75
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:00,590
Someone is selling Vertigo
again. Where is it coming from?

76
00:04:00,592 --> 00:04:03,393
I remember you.

77
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:06,012
Man in hood.

78
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:11,184
You are never far
from my thoughts.

79
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:18,825
You have failed this city!

80
00:04:18,827 --> 00:04:21,828
You have failed this city!

81
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,230
You have failed this city!

82
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:29,836
You could have just
said he was nuts.

83
00:04:29,838 --> 00:04:32,706
You failed this city!

84
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,614
All right!
You're teaching me that one.

85
00:04:57,616 --> 00:04:59,483
Only if you show me
where the knife was.

86
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:07,106
Who taught you how to fight?

87
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:08,625
My father wanted a son.

88
00:05:08,627 --> 00:05:11,745
He got one.

89
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:14,080
The tension of that
bow's 150 pounds.

90
00:05:14,082 --> 00:05:17,467
Snap it, you'll both be covered
by fiber shrapnel in your eyes.

91
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:19,836
She's right.
You're not strong enough, kid.

92
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:21,471
Go again?

93
00:05:21,473 --> 00:05:22,973
It's pretty exciting

94
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:25,425
that both of you are
such bad asses,

95
00:05:25,427 --> 00:05:26,541
but do you think that
maybe we should be

96
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:28,012
making a plan to stop Fyers?

97
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:30,897
And, I don't know...
Save your dad?

98
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:32,465
Does he always
whine this much?

99
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:35,485
Today's one of his good days.

100
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:37,604
Can he fight?

101
00:05:37,606 --> 00:05:40,156
I've tried.
Never much success.

102
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:41,825
I'm sitting right here.

103
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:44,411
Well, I haven't tried yet.

104
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:56,155
- Uncle John.
- Hey, buddy.

105
00:05:56,157 --> 00:05:58,592
Will you read
"Logan Bogan" to me?

106
00:05:58,594 --> 00:06:00,290
Sweetheart, get into bed

107
00:06:00,315 --> 00:06:01,345
and mommy will read
to you in a minute.

108
00:06:01,346 --> 00:06:03,847
But I want Uncle John
to read to me!

109
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:05,615
Uncle John's had a long day.

110
00:06:05,617 --> 00:06:07,884
He'll read to you next time.

111
00:06:12,356 --> 00:06:14,608
Hey, I'm sorry.

112
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,777
I've been some place else today.

113
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:20,363
What's going on with you?

114
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:21,881
I'm just trying
to figure some stuff out.

115
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:24,517
If you need to talk
about anything,

116
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,319
you know I'm here for you.

117
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:39,466
It is Oliver Queen,
with an emergency.

118
00:06:39,468 --> 00:06:41,568
Got to go.

119
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:44,838
Got here as quickly
as I could.

120
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,506
This about the glyph
in your father's notebook?

121
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:47,891
Felicity is still
working on that.

122
00:06:47,893 --> 00:06:49,092
We have another problem.

123
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:52,012
Starling City
is once again at war

124
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:54,147
with the drug known on
the streets as Vertigo.

125
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:55,815
It used to be the city's
most lethal vice,

126
00:06:55,817 --> 00:06:57,550
but the purple and green pill

127
00:06:57,552 --> 00:07:00,070
was nowhere to be found
for the last 3 months.

128
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:01,938
Over the past few days, the city
has been flooded

129
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,573
with a new version of Vertigo.

130
00:07:03,575 --> 00:07:05,892
More addictive, more unstable.

131
00:07:05,894 --> 00:07:07,694
It killed a girl in the club.

132
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:10,396
Just like it
almost killed Thea.

133
00:07:10,398 --> 00:07:12,599
Ok, what are you think?
We should pay the Count a visit?

134
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:15,502
He was my first visit.
Waste of time.

135
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:18,121
He's... sumasshedshiy.

136
00:07:18,123 --> 00:07:19,923
Ahh.

137
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:22,842
Since he was the only one that
knew the forumla for Vertigo,

138
00:07:22,844 --> 00:07:24,094
I don't...

139
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:26,079
I don't even know
where to begin.

140
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:27,631
Good, you're here.

141
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:29,415
Of course you're here.
Where else would you be?

142
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:30,917
You clearly love it down here.

143
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:33,086
You got to see this.

144
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:37,641
I'm here at the scene
where police say

145
00:07:37,643 --> 00:07:39,092
a disturbed patient

146
00:07:39,094 --> 00:07:40,927
escaped only hours ago.

147
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:43,613
Authorities issued
an immediate lockdown

148
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,949
at the Starling County
Institute for Mental Health

149
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:47,651
following the breakout.

150
00:07:47,653 --> 00:07:49,869
Police are warning people
to avoid contact

151
00:07:49,871 --> 00:07:52,455
with the drug dealer
known as the Count.

152
00:07:52,457 --> 00:07:54,240
Not so crazy after all, huh?

153
00:07:56,206 --> 00:08:00,206

Resync for WEB-DL by lost0ne

155
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:07,121
I was administering his meds.
He was babbling.

156
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:09,489
His usual ranting,
then he's ice cold.

157
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:10,744
He overpowered me.

158
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:12,926
He forced me to take him out
through the maintenance exit.

159
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:15,195
I thought he was harmless.
Basically a vegetable, you said.

160
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:17,547
I know. Which means...

161
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:19,883
I've interviewed him
dozens of times

162
00:08:19,885 --> 00:08:21,002
in the past few months.

163
00:08:21,027 --> 00:08:22,420
To be deceived by
a patient so completely--

164
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:25,088
Don't worry.
We'll find him.

165
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,091
He's going to find prison
a lot harder to break out of.

166
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:29,676
Detective...

167
00:08:29,678 --> 00:08:31,328
He's dangerous.

168
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,413
Don't underestimate him.

169
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,318
Did we get anything
from the security cameras?

170
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,970
Not according
to the orderly here.

171
00:08:39,972 --> 00:08:42,823
Due to budget cuts, the
cameras were the first to go.

172
00:08:42,825 --> 00:08:45,158
That is unbelievable.

173
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,726
There's another angle.

174
00:08:46,728 --> 00:08:48,662
Veronica Sparks,
the dead girl from Verdant?

175
00:08:48,664 --> 00:08:51,248
- Yeah?
- I checked her LUDs.

176
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,416
The last person
she texted before she died

177
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:54,751
was Tommy Merlyn.

178
00:08:54,753 --> 00:08:56,586
He said he didn't know her.

179
00:08:56,588 --> 00:08:59,172
Merlyn has two collars for
possession, one with intent.

180
00:08:59,174 --> 00:09:01,041
Yeah, that was over
five years ago.

181
00:09:01,043 --> 00:09:03,009
Maybe he's just better at
not getting himself arrested.

182
00:09:03,011 --> 00:09:05,679
Well, Laurel says he's changed
ever since his father cut him off.

183
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:07,130
Yeah, a leopard
and his spots, you know?

184
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:08,554
Maybe pushing Vertigo
at his new club

185
00:09:08,555 --> 00:09:10,256
is a way of maintaining
his old lifestyle.

186
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,841
Yeah, or maybe
going after Meryln's

187
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,509
a great way to get my daughter

188
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,177
to stop speaking
to me again, Hilt.

189
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,346
Look, Quentin,
you know I get that.

190
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,695
But here's the thing--
on a hunch,

191
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
I subpoenaed
the club's bank accounts.

192
00:09:20,902 --> 00:09:23,352
There's ten large missing
from their operating expenses.

193
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,604
You think Merlyn spent
that money on Vertigo?

194
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,407
I think I can't explain how that
much money just gets misplaced.

195
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:30,476
Look, I'll take a run at it.

196
00:09:30,478 --> 00:09:31,994
- Keep you out of it.
- No.

197
00:09:31,996 --> 00:09:34,480
I should do it.

198
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,657
What you need?

199
00:10:02,943 --> 00:10:04,643
All right.

200
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,346
The person of color has
successfully purchased your drugs.

201
00:10:07,348 --> 00:10:09,315
For the record, I offered.

202
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,400
How will we know
when the tracker is active?

203
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,736
It already is.
I'm getting a good signal

204
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,955
off the monofilament strips
we placed in the bills.

205
00:10:15,957 --> 00:10:18,240
Drug money's like a pigeon--
it always finds its way home.

206
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,659
We can follow the money
all the way back to the Count.

207
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,028
Keep tracking it.

208
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,863
Well, what are you going to do
with all the Vertigo you bought?

209
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:26,715
Plan on having
a party, Felicity?

210
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:29,001
My only experience with
drugs was an encounter

211
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,057
with a pot brownie
my freshman year--

212
00:10:31,082 --> 00:10:32,416
by mistake.

213
00:10:32,807 --> 00:10:35,975
Which could have been fun,
except I'm allergic to nuts.

214
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:37,593
All right, head shot.

215
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,545
Kills again,
this time a U.S. senator.

216
00:10:39,547 --> 00:10:41,013
Where have you been
tracking him?

217
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,549
Not very far.
I ran his Floyd Lawton alias

218
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:45,651
through every conceivable
law enforcement database.

219
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:48,420
He's made a series of calls
to an Alberto Garcia.

220
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:50,359
- Huh.
- According to NSA,

221
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,217
Garcia's a reputed
underworld talent scout.

222
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:54,893
He books all
the Deadshot's hits.

223
00:10:56,729 --> 00:10:58,280
It's not much to go on, but...

224
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,399
Yeah, but it's
something, Felicity, thanks.

225
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:02,001
Don't you think
Oliver should know?

226
00:11:02,003 --> 00:11:03,986
No, this is personal.

227
00:11:05,288 --> 00:11:07,673
Lawton is my problem
to deal with.

228
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,927
What brings you by?

229
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:14,363
Hey, would you like
some dinner?

230
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:16,382
Your daughter ordered
way too much Thai food.

231
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,517
No, thanks.

232
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,687
This is a business
visit, actually.

233
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:25,724
I got some follow up questions
on the Sparks' girl's death.

234
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,811
Sure. The girl was in the club
before she got run-over.

235
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,297
You said you didn't
know her, but, um,

236
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:33,765
but the last text
off her phone was to you.

237
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:36,869
Really? Because, uh...

238
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:39,771
Well, I'll be damned.

239
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:43,919
Huh. Well, I didn't reply.

240
00:11:43,944 --> 00:11:45,078
I get a hundred texts
like this a night.

241
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,795
People wanting
to get into the club.

242
00:11:46,797 --> 00:11:49,798
So that's what she meant by,
"Can you hook me up?"

243
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,650
What else would it be about?

244
00:11:52,903 --> 00:11:56,005
$10,000 is missing from
your club's bank accounts.

245
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,307
What'd you spend the money on?

246
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:00,392
No idea. There must be some sort
of bookkeeping error--

247
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:02,478
Ok, let me put this
another way--

248
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,647
if you spent that money on Vertigo
so that you could "hook up"

249
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:06,215
- your clientele--
- Dad!

250
00:12:06,217 --> 00:12:07,566
Then the best thing
for you right now

251
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:09,518
is to cop to it, ok?
Get out in front of this.

252
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,603
Don't say anything.

253
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:11,803
I am trying to--

254
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:13,255
To do your job?
Yeah, I know.

255
00:12:13,257 --> 00:12:14,440
And this is me doing mine.

256
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,942
Laurel, I know I look like

257
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,844
the disapproving
father--again.

258
00:12:18,846 --> 00:12:22,915
But I came down here
so another cop wouldn't.

259
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:25,651
You understand?

260
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:27,703
Tommy, I...

261
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,821
I'm not hungry anymore.

262
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,478
Hold up hand up.

263
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,481
Palm facing me.

264
00:12:56,516 --> 00:12:58,517
Hit the water.

265
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,986
- What?
- Hit it.

266
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:05,124
Again.

267
00:13:07,827 --> 00:13:09,328
Again. Harder.

268
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,696
If the point of this

269
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:13,031
is to make me feel like
an idiot, it's working.

270
00:13:14,634 --> 00:13:16,552
"A journey of a thousand miles

271
00:13:16,554 --> 00:13:18,637
begins with
a single step."

272
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,639
Confucius, great.

273
00:13:20,641 --> 00:13:23,041
I'm starting to see
the family resemblance.

274
00:13:23,043 --> 00:13:25,561
Laozi, actually. Again.

275
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,897
Now what?

276
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:31,883
Fill the bowl.
Start again.

277
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:35,404
What have you got?

278
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:37,239
The end of the money trail.

279
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:40,275
Sending the dealer's
location to you now.

280
00:13:57,427 --> 00:13:59,745
Oh, hey! Hey, dude.

281
00:14:09,756 --> 00:14:12,891
Hey yo.

282
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,277
Who's looking to party?

283
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,763
Oh, yeah.
Come on.

284
00:14:17,765 --> 00:14:19,598
That's not enough, man.

285
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,734
You don't pay, you don't play.

286
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,737
It's all right.
Good for business.

287
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,790
My boss seems to like you, G.
That's right.

288
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:33,945
Hey, hey, come here.
How much for this?

289
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:35,447
Now that...

290
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:37,833
That'll buy you
a brick, my man.

291
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:51,597
Go, go, go!

292
00:15:17,024 --> 00:15:19,108
Don't forget to breathe.

293
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,778
He won't.
I won't.

294
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:29,035
Congratulations.

295
00:15:29,037 --> 00:15:31,354
You're officially the creepiest
person I've ever met.

296
00:15:31,356 --> 00:15:32,822
I don't--I don't
feel so good.

297
00:15:32,824 --> 00:15:35,692
Get away from me, creep.

298
00:15:35,694 --> 00:15:37,694
Have we got a problem?

299
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:40,163
Are you ok?

300
00:15:44,418 --> 00:15:46,336
All units,
all units, code 99.

301
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:49,139
417 in progress, Starling Aquarium.
All available units--

302
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:51,508
this just came over
the police frequency.

303
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,678
I hacked the aquarium
security system to get a better look.

304
00:15:58,049 --> 00:15:59,516
Bystanders said
they saw him pop

305
00:15:59,518 --> 00:16:00,934
some green and black pills...

306
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:11,277
There's a lunatic
high on Vertigo who's taking hostages,

307
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,748
and you're making--
making tea.

308
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:19,419
They're medicinal herbs
from the island.

309
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:22,071
They counter balance the effects
of certain drugs and poisons.

310
00:16:22,073 --> 00:16:26,376
They should counteract
the effects of Vertigo.

311
00:16:26,378 --> 00:16:27,844
And you aren't going to--

312
00:16:27,846 --> 00:16:30,413
- What?
- You know...

313
00:16:30,415 --> 00:16:32,799
My sister got high
on this garbage.

314
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:34,289
Could have killed someone.

315
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:36,225
She didn't deserve
an arrow in the heart.

316
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:39,556
This guy didn't fail the city.

317
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:41,391
The city failed him.

318
00:16:41,393 --> 00:16:44,661
And so did I.

319
00:16:44,663 --> 00:16:46,429
What's happening now
isn't your fault.

320
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:48,231
You didn't make him
take drugs.

321
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:49,866
No, but I did fail to put the Count
in a grave so deep

322
00:16:49,868 --> 00:16:51,484
that he couldn't come back
and hurt anyone again.

323
00:16:51,486 --> 00:16:52,786
You caught him.
They locked him up.

324
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:54,421
And now the city is on fire!

325
00:16:54,423 --> 00:16:57,323
So clearly, it wasn't
the right decision.

326
00:17:04,382 --> 00:17:08,134
Get in touch with Diggle.

327
00:17:08,136 --> 00:17:09,584
With the security feed out,

328
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:11,676
I'm going need a second
set of eyes at the aquarium.

329
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:25,735
Glad I caught you stateside.

330
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:29,172
Just barely. I leave in
two days for Pyongyang.

331
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,407
Isn't that classified?

332
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:34,244
I figure an old army
buy can keep a secret.

333
00:17:34,246 --> 00:17:36,145
I was glad to get your call.

334
00:17:36,147 --> 00:17:40,333
Lyla, that's not why I called.

335
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:42,585
There's something else
you'd like me

336
00:17:42,587 --> 00:17:44,621
to do for you, then.
Well, actually,

337
00:17:44,623 --> 00:17:46,539
I think there's something
I can do for you.

338
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,591
I'm going to go out on a limb
and assume that Deadshot

339
00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:50,710
is on Argus' most wanted list.

340
00:17:50,712 --> 00:17:52,579
What do you know about him?

341
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:55,298
Well, his name, for starters.
Floyd Lawton.

342
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,334
We don't even have that.
Where'd you get it?

343
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:00,603
Same place I got this.

344
00:18:00,605 --> 00:18:02,806
This is everything
you need to locate

345
00:18:02,808 --> 00:18:06,242
who's giving Deadshot
his targets.

346
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:08,645
What's your interest in this?

347
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:10,613
Lawton came up in connection with
some things I'm working on.

348
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:13,366
I thought you were
the right person to pass it off to.

349
00:18:13,368 --> 00:18:16,820
I remember you being
a better liar than that, Johnny.

350
00:18:16,822 --> 00:18:19,622
Listen, Lyla, Lawton
is a very dangerous man.

351
00:18:19,624 --> 00:18:21,407
And your people are the most
qualified to take him down.

352
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:22,659
It's that simple.

353
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:24,911
Nothing in our business
is simple.

354
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:41,344
Me to ask for my help again,
Mr. Lance?

355
00:18:41,346 --> 00:18:44,430
Eric Messner?

356
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:46,349
Who?

357
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:49,385
He's a zoning commissioner
for Starling City.

358
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:51,321
A notoriously corrupt one,
at that.

359
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:54,824
Missing ten grand.
You paid it to him

360
00:18:54,826 --> 00:18:56,993
to skip the inspection
of your nightclub.

361
00:18:56,995 --> 00:19:00,029
Why'd you do that, Merlyn?
What didn't you want him to find?

362
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:01,481
We got nothing to hide here.

363
00:19:01,483 --> 00:19:04,417
Great. Then let's just
take a little look around.

364
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:06,068
Absolutely.

365
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,004
When you come back
with a search warrant.

366
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:16,245
Are you sure this is how
you want to play this?

367
00:19:16,247 --> 00:19:20,116
Apparently.

368
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:24,020
Doesn't my daughter
know how to pick 'em.

369
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:31,344
Stop laughing at me!

370
00:19:33,063 --> 00:19:35,481
Shut up!

371
00:19:35,483 --> 00:19:36,950
Shut up!

372
00:19:55,786 --> 00:19:58,805
Stop! I don't want to hurt you.

373
00:20:05,262 --> 00:20:07,730
I'm here to help you.

374
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,488
Hey, hey.

375
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:25,582
My mom does yoga.

376
00:20:27,117 --> 00:20:29,435
Hey, remember when Slade
and I rescued you?

377
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:30,870
You rescued me?

378
00:20:30,872 --> 00:20:34,824
Fine. When we all
rescued each other.

379
00:20:34,826 --> 00:20:38,177
You said you knew
why Fyers wanted Yao Fei,

380
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:41,431
and how he was
forcing him to help.

381
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:43,433
Feel like sharing?

382
00:20:43,435 --> 00:20:47,437
We're almost out
of slapping water.

383
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:55,778
My father was a Shangjiang
in the People's Liberation Army.

384
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,481
A general. I didn't hear
the details of Fyers plans,

385
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:01,851
but he wants my father
to be the face of it.

386
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:04,287
A scapegoat.
To take the blame

387
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:06,406
and conceal
their own involvement.

388
00:21:06,408 --> 00:21:09,325
Why was Yao Fei
on the island in the first place?

389
00:21:09,327 --> 00:21:12,378
Fyers says he murdered people.

390
00:21:13,464 --> 00:21:15,832
No, he didn't.

391
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:19,252
The Chinese military
comitted the massacre.

392
00:21:19,254 --> 00:21:21,137
Someone had to take the blame.

393
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:23,873
They chose him.

394
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,676
Sent him to this
island for life.

395
00:21:26,678 --> 00:21:28,845
I spent years looking for him.

396
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:31,397
A few months ago, a man
came to my apartment.

397
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:34,817
Said he had information
about my father's whereabouts.

398
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:37,437
I had given up hope.

399
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:42,625
Let my guard down.
Didn't see the tazer until...

400
00:21:42,627 --> 00:21:44,861
When I woke up, I was here.

401
00:21:51,168 --> 00:21:54,537
I'm worried.
This island...

402
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:58,240
What he must have had
to do to survive.

403
00:21:58,242 --> 00:22:00,293
That it changed him.

404
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:02,912
He saved my life.

405
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,932
He's still a good man, Shado.

406
00:22:11,605 --> 00:22:13,690
Again.

407
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,778
So there I am sitting
at our favorite Sushi restaurant,

408
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,563
a bottle of saki,

409
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:24,400
and the only thing
that's missing is my boyfriend.

410
00:22:24,402 --> 00:22:26,602
My God, I'm so sorry, baby.

411
00:22:26,604 --> 00:22:29,739
I just have
a lot going on here.

412
00:22:29,741 --> 00:22:32,158
Tommy, whatever's
going on with you,

413
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,626
I want you to know
I believe you.

414
00:22:33,628 --> 00:22:35,995
I'm here for you.

415
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:40,666
Sorry.

416
00:22:40,668 --> 00:22:42,168
Ollie.

417
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,386
What's wrong?

418
00:22:43,388 --> 00:22:44,637
Bad night.

419
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:47,173
It's about to get worse.
Mr. Meryln,

420
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:49,809
as requested, a warrant to search
these premises.

421
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:52,295
I can't believe
you're doing this.

422
00:22:52,297 --> 00:22:54,180
- Believe it.
- Detective,

423
00:22:54,182 --> 00:22:56,682
I'm not an attorney,
but on what grounds

424
00:22:56,684 --> 00:22:58,351
are you searching my club?

425
00:22:58,353 --> 00:23:00,153
Your general manager bribed
a government official to keep him

426
00:23:00,155 --> 00:23:02,438
from inspecting
the entirety of your building.

427
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,773
What?

428
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:05,608
Because he's selling
Vertigo out of the club.

429
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,477
Ollie, it's valid.
Thank you.

430
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:10,279
A sub level is not listed

431
00:23:10,281 --> 00:23:12,115
on the inspection's
floor plans.

432
00:23:12,117 --> 00:23:14,200
However, I pulled
the county records.

433
00:23:14,202 --> 00:23:16,369
There's something down there.

434
00:23:16,371 --> 00:23:19,155
I want to see
for myself what it is.

435
00:23:19,157 --> 00:23:21,841
Oh, look at that.

436
00:23:21,843 --> 00:23:25,294
Open the door.

437
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:32,435
You're making a mistake.

438
00:23:32,437 --> 00:23:34,520
No. You are.

439
00:23:34,522 --> 00:23:36,856
If you don't open that door.

440
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:50,693
I said, open the door.

441
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,267
Thank you.

442
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,601
The place is kind of a mess.

443
00:24:20,603 --> 00:24:24,521
I've been using it to store
the bulk of our inventory.

444
00:24:26,141 --> 00:24:27,591
What's in the boxes?

445
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:30,260
Why don't you have a look.

446
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,615
Well, if prohibition
were still in effect,

447
00:24:34,617 --> 00:24:37,117
you might actually have a basis
of a criminal complaint.

448
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:39,286
Would you like to open
the rest of the crates?

449
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:53,300
So if you don't have
anything to hide...

450
00:24:53,302 --> 00:24:56,870
Why didn't you want
the inspector down here?

451
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,524
Well, the ventilation
system in this place

452
00:25:00,526 --> 00:25:03,560
hasn't been updated
since the sixties.

453
00:25:03,562 --> 00:25:06,263
Maybe we shouldn't
even be open.

454
00:25:08,733 --> 00:25:12,319
Yeah.

455
00:25:15,323 --> 00:25:17,107
I'm sorry.

456
00:25:17,109 --> 00:25:18,626
I thought he was ok
with us being together.

457
00:25:18,628 --> 00:25:20,277
He wasn't wrong.
I bribed a guy.

458
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:22,329
That's not why
he brought out his jackboots.

459
00:25:22,331 --> 00:25:23,980
It's all gonna be fine.

460
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:26,450
I'll see you at home.

461
00:25:26,452 --> 00:25:27,534
Good night.

462
00:25:27,536 --> 00:25:28,985
Good night.

463
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:31,088
Is there something
you want to say to me?

464
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,322
Thank you.

465
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:33,674
No, I meant the thing
that you were thinking

466
00:25:33,676 --> 00:25:35,709
when Lance accused me
of dealing out of the club.

467
00:25:35,711 --> 00:25:37,344
I don't understand
why you wouldn't

468
00:25:37,346 --> 00:25:39,329
just tell me about the bribe.

469
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:41,331
I run the club, Oliver.

470
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,133
I don't tell you
a lot of things.

471
00:25:43,135 --> 00:25:45,386
So let me ask you
a question, pal.

472
00:25:45,388 --> 00:25:48,288
What have I done in the last
6 months since you've been home

473
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,525
that would lead you
to believe that I would sell drugs?

474
00:25:51,527 --> 00:25:53,711
In the last 6 months?
Nothing.

475
00:25:53,736 --> 00:25:54,629
Yeah.

476
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,647
Before I left,
you played hard.

477
00:25:56,649 --> 00:25:59,015
You played with bad people
who were into bad stuff.

478
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:01,285
And so did you, Oliver.

479
00:26:01,287 --> 00:26:04,038
But I changed
just like you did.

480
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,625
Now you put arrows in people
who do illegal things.

481
00:26:08,627 --> 00:26:12,162
Last time I checked, bribing
a city inspector was not legal.

482
00:26:12,164 --> 00:26:16,333
Do you actually think
that I could hurt you?

483
00:26:16,335 --> 00:26:18,602
Truthfully, I have no idea what
the hell you would do.

484
00:26:18,604 --> 00:26:20,768
You are a complete
mystery to me.

485
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:24,953
I've got no idea how you find it
so easy to kill people.

486
00:26:26,456 --> 00:26:29,441
The next time you decide to think
the worst of me,

487
00:26:29,443 --> 00:26:31,260
imagine what I now
think of you.

488
00:26:38,853 --> 00:26:40,418
What's his problem?

489
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,754
What's yours?

490
00:26:42,756 --> 00:26:43,972
Excuse me?

491
00:26:43,974 --> 00:26:46,375
I asked Felicity
to get in touch with you.

492
00:26:46,377 --> 00:26:49,478
There was a hostage
situation at the aquarium.

493
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,780
I'm sorry, I didn't get
that message till it was over.

494
00:26:51,782 --> 00:26:52,948
Why?

495
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,734
Because I was busy
doing something else.

496
00:26:57,487 --> 00:26:59,571
Lawton.

497
00:26:59,573 --> 00:27:01,790
Oliver, you didn't
end up needing me.

498
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:02,958
You couldn't have known that.

499
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,576
In other words,

500
00:27:04,578 --> 00:27:06,295
find your brother's killer
on your own time, right?

501
00:27:06,297 --> 00:27:08,413
Vertigo's tearing
this city apart, Diggle.

502
00:27:08,415 --> 00:27:10,899
So, yeah, maybe now's
not the best time

503
00:27:10,901 --> 00:27:12,518
to indulge
a personal vendetta.

504
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,836
You're actually gonna stand
there and tell me

505
00:27:13,838 --> 00:27:16,889
that you going after
the Count is not personal?

506
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:19,758
Oliver, listen, I cannot read
a book to my nephew

507
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,626
without knowing that Lawton
took his father from him.

508
00:27:21,628 --> 00:27:24,480
I can't move on with Carly,
I can't move on with my life

509
00:27:24,482 --> 00:27:28,150
knowing that he's
still out there.

510
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:32,521
I thought if anybody
got that it'd be you.

511
00:27:38,778 --> 00:27:40,078
What happened here?

512
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,998
The ethernet cable
still works.

513
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,816
Would you plug in
your tablet, please?

514
00:27:44,818 --> 00:27:45,918
Did you decide to remodel?

515
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,919
Long story.

516
00:27:46,921 --> 00:27:47,953
Where's Dig?

517
00:27:47,955 --> 00:27:49,621
Long story.

518
00:27:49,623 --> 00:27:51,340
The hostage-taking junkie.

519
00:27:51,342 --> 00:27:53,091
He is the only lead
to the Count we've got left.

520
00:27:53,093 --> 00:27:54,877
What type of information
are you looking for?

521
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:58,380
Anything that will give us
a line on the Count's location.

522
00:27:58,382 --> 00:28:00,766
Has the M.E. performed the
autopsy report yet?

523
00:28:00,768 --> 00:28:02,684
Yeah, just pulling it up now.

524
00:28:02,686 --> 00:28:04,436
Check the toxicology to see

525
00:28:04,438 --> 00:28:06,271
if there's something related
to the Vertigo he was on.

526
00:28:06,273 --> 00:28:07,839
He didn't die of
a Vertigo overdose.

527
00:28:07,841 --> 00:28:09,892
I saw it, Felicity.

528
00:28:09,894 --> 00:28:12,703
According to the
coroner, cause of death

529
00:28:12,728 --> 00:28:13,897
was severe anaphylaxis.

530
00:28:13,898 --> 00:28:16,899
He died of an allergic reaction
to chlorpromazine.

531
00:28:16,901 --> 00:28:18,483
That's an anti-psychotic.

532
00:28:18,485 --> 00:28:21,453
Pull up the
Veronica Sparks autopsy.

533
00:28:21,455 --> 00:28:24,890
Did she have chlorpromazine
in her system?

534
00:28:24,892 --> 00:28:27,692
Yes.

535
00:28:27,694 --> 00:28:29,378
How did you know?

536
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,963
The Count must have added it
as a new ingredient

537
00:28:30,965 --> 00:28:32,981
in this latest iteration
of Vertigo.

538
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:36,552
But wouldn't the amount
he'd need

539
00:28:36,554 --> 00:28:38,837
to manufacture enough
for circulation be huge?

540
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:40,672
Where would he get that much?

541
00:28:40,674 --> 00:28:44,343
A mental institution.

542
00:28:44,345 --> 00:28:46,395
What if we're looking
at this all wrong?

543
00:28:46,397 --> 00:28:47,712
How so?

544
00:28:47,714 --> 00:28:49,565
Everybody is looking
for him outside the asylum,

545
00:28:49,567 --> 00:28:50,682
but what if he never left?

546
00:28:50,684 --> 00:28:51,934
What if...

547
00:28:51,936 --> 00:28:55,020
What if he faked his escape

548
00:28:55,022 --> 00:28:58,690
the same way that he
faked being insane?

549
00:29:46,572 --> 00:29:49,408
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

550
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,660
Turn around.

551
00:29:52,545 --> 00:29:56,748
I said turn around.

552
00:30:13,713 --> 00:30:14,413
Yah!

553
00:30:33,103 --> 00:30:35,121
Oliver Queen.

554
00:30:35,195 --> 00:30:38,296
All those years
on that island.

555
00:31:00,002 --> 00:31:03,221
So the Count didn't fake losing
his mind, did he?

556
00:31:04,105 --> 00:31:05,906
This was you the whole time.

557
00:31:05,908 --> 00:31:09,076
How'd you get him to give you
the formula for Vertigo? Huh?

558
00:31:09,078 --> 00:31:12,613
Chemistry doesn't seem
like his best subject right now.

559
00:31:12,615 --> 00:31:15,265
He couldn't tell me
if he wanted to.

560
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:17,501
I ordered a biopsy
on his kidneys.

561
00:31:17,503 --> 00:31:21,255
The tissue was suffused
with the narcotic after his O.D.

562
00:31:21,257 --> 00:31:23,941
When I got the results,
I realized I could

563
00:31:23,943 --> 00:31:26,543
reverse engineer the chemical
compound of the drug,

564
00:31:26,545 --> 00:31:28,512
produce a synthesized
version myself

565
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:30,497
using the facilities here.

566
00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:32,299
And made a few improvements,

567
00:31:32,301 --> 00:31:33,500
like adding chlorpromazine.

568
00:31:33,502 --> 00:31:35,552
That's how you found us.

569
00:31:35,554 --> 00:31:38,071
Cops came around,
started asking questions,

570
00:31:38,073 --> 00:31:40,326
you faked the Count's
disappearance to draw

571
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:41,887
attention away from yourself.

572
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:45,229
It's clever.

573
00:31:45,231 --> 00:31:49,700
I wasn't trying to be
a criminal mastermind.

574
00:31:49,702 --> 00:31:51,485
I just needed the money.

575
00:31:51,487 --> 00:31:55,489
Something I'm sure a billionaire
wouldn't understand.

576
00:31:55,491 --> 00:31:57,491
Believe me,

577
00:31:57,493 --> 00:32:00,294
I understand you perfectly.

578
00:32:00,296 --> 00:32:02,529
Open his mouth.

579
00:32:02,531 --> 00:32:04,998
What? No! No!

580
00:32:20,244 --> 00:32:22,829
From what I've read
in the tabloids,

581
00:32:22,831 --> 00:32:25,882
no one will be surprised
to hear Oliver Queen

582
00:32:25,884 --> 00:32:28,251
died of a drug overdose.

583
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:33,316
Uhh!

584
00:33:43,873 --> 00:33:45,406
Clear.

585
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,897
Freeze!

586
00:33:53,752 --> 00:33:56,637
You don't look so good.

587
00:33:56,639 --> 00:33:59,806
I doubt you could aim
a single arrow.

588
00:34:33,642 --> 00:34:39,280
Looks like I'm
the last one standing.

589
00:34:39,282 --> 00:34:45,252
Sitting. Spinning.

590
00:34:45,254 --> 00:34:48,622
Something to do.

591
00:34:48,624 --> 00:34:51,242
What was I going to do?

592
00:34:51,244 --> 00:34:54,428
Memory not what it once was.

593
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:58,582
Nothing what it once was.

594
00:35:04,556 --> 00:35:08,709
Is there a name
on the gravestone?

595
00:35:10,562 --> 00:35:12,930
No.

596
00:35:12,932 --> 00:35:14,682
It's new.

597
00:35:14,684 --> 00:35:17,985
And clean.

598
00:35:17,987 --> 00:35:21,438
And waiting.

599
00:35:33,301 --> 00:35:35,185
We're finished here.

600
00:35:41,492 --> 00:35:44,244
Hey. How we doing?

601
00:35:44,246 --> 00:35:45,695
In the black.

602
00:35:45,697 --> 00:35:47,747
Did the Hood get his man?

603
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:53,586
Well, we won't be having
any problems with Vertigo anymore.

604
00:35:53,588 --> 00:35:55,538
Look, Tommy, I'm sorry.

605
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,023
I've caught up the bookkeeping

606
00:35:57,025 --> 00:35:59,926
and all my notes
on the inventory are in there,

607
00:35:59,928 --> 00:36:02,545
along with a list
of suppliers that we use.

608
00:36:02,547 --> 00:36:05,164
Ok.

609
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:07,400
I don't see why
you're telling me that.

610
00:36:07,402 --> 00:36:09,385
This club is important to me.

611
00:36:09,387 --> 00:36:11,604
But for you it's just a front.

612
00:36:11,606 --> 00:36:12,872
You want me to keep
your secret,

613
00:36:12,874 --> 00:36:15,108
help you be this thing
you've become,

614
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,761
but you refuse to see me
for what I've become.

615
00:36:17,763 --> 00:36:22,282
I've got just a bit
too much self-respect for that.

616
00:36:23,951 --> 00:36:26,035
I quit.

617
00:36:34,545 --> 00:36:36,613
Dinner.

618
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:38,148
You're still doing that?

619
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,800
Fyers better be careful
with his bowls of water.

620
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,838
When are we going to do
actual training?

621
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,924
There once was a young boy
whose father dropped him off

622
00:36:47,926 --> 00:36:50,209
at a shaolin monastery
to study Kung Fu.

623
00:36:50,211 --> 00:36:52,479
Good, a story.

624
00:36:52,481 --> 00:36:55,098
After a year, the boy came
to visit his family.

625
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,933
When they asked what
he'd learned,

626
00:36:56,935 --> 00:36:59,786
the boy hung his head
in shame.

627
00:36:59,788 --> 00:37:03,773
All the monks had him do was
slap water in a barrel for a year.

628
00:37:03,775 --> 00:37:05,391
We don't have a year.

629
00:37:05,393 --> 00:37:08,278
So I hope your training
regimen is a bit faster.

630
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:13,733
The family didn't believe him,
so he showed them.

631
00:37:13,735 --> 00:37:18,872
He raised his hand and hit
the table they were eating on.

632
00:37:18,874 --> 00:37:20,023
It broke in half.

633
00:37:20,025 --> 00:37:21,875
I'm gonna be able
to break a table?

634
00:37:21,877 --> 00:37:25,345
Better.

635
00:37:31,635 --> 00:37:33,770
Ok.

636
00:37:45,115 --> 00:37:46,900
Draw the bow.

637
00:37:54,074 --> 00:37:55,792
I'll be damned.

638
00:38:01,131 --> 00:38:03,149
What's next?

639
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:05,051
We teach you to shoot.

640
00:38:23,988 --> 00:38:24,971
Drinking alone?

641
00:38:24,973 --> 00:38:27,657
Oh. Well, no,
not anymore.

642
00:38:31,862 --> 00:38:34,797
Just soda?

643
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:37,050
Bartender forget the scotch?

644
00:38:37,052 --> 00:38:40,420
I didn't really feel
the need for it.

645
00:38:40,422 --> 00:38:45,625
So, um, the girl who died,

646
00:38:45,627 --> 00:38:48,928
it turns out that she got
her Vertigo from a co-worker.

647
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,080
Guess I owe your
boyfriend an apology.

648
00:38:51,082 --> 00:38:52,832
He has a name, you know.

649
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:54,634
Yeah, I just can't
seem to bring myself to use it.

650
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:56,102
Baby steps.

651
00:38:58,906 --> 00:39:02,102
Did I screw things up
between us again?

652
00:39:03,962 --> 00:39:05,144
No.

653
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,351
Look, I really wasn't
looking to jam up Merlyn, ok?

654
00:39:12,353 --> 00:39:15,121
I knew by pursuing him
that I could throw a wrench in--

655
00:39:15,123 --> 00:39:16,623
Then why did you do it?

656
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:18,157
There was evidence, Laurel,

657
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:20,460
and I had to follow it.
I had to.

658
00:39:20,462 --> 00:39:23,379
Look, your mom was
right, you were right.

659
00:39:23,381 --> 00:39:24,781
Like you said about me
and the Vigilante,

660
00:39:24,782 --> 00:39:26,722
I can't let things go.

661
00:39:26,968 --> 00:39:30,470
I close cases, it's what I do.

662
00:39:30,472 --> 00:39:33,589
Everyone else be damned.

663
00:39:33,591 --> 00:39:36,175
Well, maybe the fact that
there's no scotch in there means

664
00:39:36,177 --> 00:39:38,261
you're ready to work on that.

665
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,048
People can change.

666
00:39:49,823 --> 00:39:51,107
Hey.

667
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:52,275
Hey.

668
00:39:53,777 --> 00:39:56,796
You had my back.

669
00:39:56,798 --> 00:39:59,549
You needed me.

670
00:39:59,551 --> 00:40:01,668
Felicity told me
where you were headed.

671
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,070
You ok?

672
00:40:04,072 --> 00:40:07,006
I'm the killer, remember?

673
00:40:07,008 --> 00:40:08,808
I've killed before, Oliver.

674
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,710
It's just been a while.

675
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:17,500
If you're the killer,
why isn't the Count down, too?

676
00:40:17,502 --> 00:40:20,470
I'm sure it must have been tempting
to take him off the board for good.

677
00:40:20,472 --> 00:40:22,105
People change.

678
00:40:22,107 --> 00:40:23,473
People like the Count?

679
00:40:23,475 --> 00:40:27,944
No. I meant me.

680
00:40:27,946 --> 00:40:31,230
Not so long ago I would have
put that guy down for good,

681
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:36,319
but looking at him today
all vacant...

682
00:40:38,055 --> 00:40:40,106
There didn't seem to be
a point.

683
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:45,778
But not everybody
deserves mercy.

684
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,331
For example.

685
00:40:52,186 --> 00:40:54,453
I thought he wasn't
a priority to you.

686
00:40:54,455 --> 00:40:56,288
He's a priority to you.

687
00:40:58,058 --> 00:41:02,712
You two have
unfinished business.

688
00:41:02,714 --> 00:41:04,630
Where do we start?

689
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,102
I'd prefer we skip
the I-told-you-sos,

690
00:41:09,104 --> 00:41:13,990
but the nightclub wasn't
really working out.

691
00:41:13,992 --> 00:41:18,578
I guess I need something
more boring, stable.

692
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:23,315
9:00 to 5:00, go home kiss Laurel,
that sort of thing.

693
00:41:24,868 --> 00:41:29,989
I guess what I'm saying is...

694
00:41:29,991 --> 00:41:31,924
I want a job.

695
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:48,434
