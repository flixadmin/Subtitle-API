1
00:00:02,587 --> 00:00:03,672
<i>In 2166,</i>

2
00:00:03,838 --> 00:00:06,132
<i>an immortal tyrant named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,593
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:10,261
<i>I have assembled an elite team</i>

5
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:12,847
<i>to hunt him throughout time
and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:15,100
<i>Unfortunately, my plan is opposed</i>

7
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:17,268
<i>by the body I had sworn my allegiance to,</i>

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,603
<i>the Time Masters.</i>

9
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:21,147
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,607
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

11
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:25,527
<i>they will be remembered as legends.</i>

12
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:30,365
<i>Previously,
on</i> Legends of Tomorrow...

13
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:32,283
Ray! Ray, I need you, please!

14
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:33,702
<i>I thought you were dead.</i>

15
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:35,712
<i>Not only did you
fail to capture Savage,</i>

16
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:37,956
but you exposed yourselves
and your powers to him,

17
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:40,404
giving away the element of
surprise for now and all time.

18
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,460
I let you go,
you'll deliver the <i>Waverider?</i>

19
00:00:42,669 --> 00:00:44,295
Boys! The ship's all yours.

20
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:46,339
<i>You're a liability to the team.</i>

21
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:48,883
Only one of us
is walking outta here alive.

22
00:00:57,976 --> 00:00:59,686
Tommy, promise me you won't go too fast.

23
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:01,479
You gotta hold on to something, honey.

24
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:03,314
Preferably me.

25
00:01:03,523 --> 00:01:05,334
Remember, just 'cause you stole
your grandma's wheels

26
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:06,627
don't mean you gotta drive like her.

27
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:07,878
Oh, you run your mouth pretty fast,

28
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,237
let's see if
your car can keep up.

29
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:35,972
Tommy, hold tight.

30
00:01:55,742 --> 00:01:57,494
Yo, James Dean, are you...

31
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:02,499
<i>What's that?</i>

32
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:07,629
I think that's a comet or something.

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,256
It's a meteorite.

34
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,011
In point of fact,
I was drawn to it as well.

35
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:20,058
Your presence out here was unexpected.

36
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:25,647
Or perhaps that's
just another word for destiny.

37
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:40,387
<i>I'm not the only one</i>

38
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:42,330
whose vision is blurry
in their left eye, am I?

39
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:45,708
Seeing three of everything,
that's normal, right?

40
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,155
<i>Yes, as I mentioned before,</i>

41
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:48,896
the effect of time travel
on the human body

42
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,588
increases with the length of each jaunt.

43
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:51,965
So, where are we?

44
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:53,591
Harmony Falls, Oregon.

45
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:55,593
According to Captain Baxter's intel,

46
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,264
Savage makes an appearance
in this quaint little hamlet.

47
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,270
What the hell is Savage doing
in Pleasantville?

48
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:05,061
Murder, apparently.

49
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:06,756
<i>Several denizens of Harmony Falls</i>

50
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,064
have been brutally slain

51
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:09,391
and others have gone missing.

52
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:11,484
Huh. Kind of like Rory.

53
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:13,111
<i>Reports are vague,</i>

54
00:03:13,278 --> 00:03:15,358
but it seems like the killer's
an expert with knives.

55
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:17,532
That sounds like Savage's MO.

56
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:18,992
Yeah, but serial killing isn't.

57
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:20,201
<i>Sounds pretty small time</i>

58
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:21,953
for a guy who's had coffee with Hitler.

59
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:23,347
Clearly, we have to assume that Savage

60
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:24,914
has a larger, more nefarious plan

61
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:26,916
but since we've jumped back in time,

62
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,323
Savage isn't expecting us here.

63
00:03:28,877 --> 00:03:32,088
Savage is pretty good at hiding
even in a small town,

64
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:33,798
so how do you plan to find him?

65
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:35,758
By investigating these murders.

66
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:39,137
Now, there has to be a common
link between the victims,

67
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:41,472
starting with the first.

68
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,309
<i>A piano teacher was found
slain in her home</i>

69
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:45,555
<i>which is now on the market.</i>

70
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:47,687
There is, of course, crown molding.

71
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:50,899
All original floors, stucco ceiling.

72
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:53,484
There's a small room above the garage

73
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:56,195
suitable for live-in help.

74
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:58,323
Oh, well, we don't need a maid.

75
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:00,408
My husband and I
get along just fine on our own.

76
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:05,997
You know, I have a lovely
Tudor style in another town.

77
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:10,501
A more accepting one.
Forward-thinking.

78
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:15,673
No, that's fine.
I like my towns backward.

79
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:19,385
<i>Dr. Matt Miller
was found murdered</i>

80
00:04:19,552 --> 00:04:21,429
<i>on the grounds of the asylum
where he worked.</i>

81
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:23,973
<i>The sanitarium
was in need of a replacement.</i>

82
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,392
It's a very impressive facility.

83
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:30,313
I did my doctoral thesis
on sociopathology

84
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,899
in relationship to serial murder actually.

85
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:34,418
Now, that'll certainly
come in handy around here.

86
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:35,735
We've been short-staffed

87
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:38,613
ever since Dr. Miller's sudden demise.

88
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:40,215
Of course, I could never consider

89
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,366
accepting a position here

90
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:44,869
without my faithful nurse/assistant.

91
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:48,706
Yes, well, she looks like
she'll fit right in.

92
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,962
Meanwhile,
Jefferson is the perfect age

93
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,839
to discern the facts behind the
disappearance of three teenagers

94
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:59,384
who went missing a week before
these murders began.

95
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:02,303
So, Raymond and Kendra are shacking up,

96
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,972
<i>Sara's Nurse Ratched,</i>

97
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,974
and Jax's the new kid in town.

98
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,558
Where does that leave me?

99
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:19,946
We're looking for the Sheriff.

100
00:05:20,113 --> 00:05:22,448
Well, you found him. Bud Ellison.

101
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:23,700
How can I help you, folks?

102
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,285
Special Agent Rip Hunter.

103
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:28,579
This is my partner, Leonard.

104
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:31,416
We are here to investigate
the serial murders,

105
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:34,168
which have plagued this
sleepy old town of yours.

106
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:37,296
Whoa. Now, slow down there, buddy, there.

107
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:39,173
There ain't no serial killer anywhere.

108
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,093
All we've got is some
unexplained accidents, is all.

109
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,696
How about you hand over those case files,

110
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,179
so we can decide for ourselves?

111
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:47,098
<i>Or we can come back</i>

112
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,935
with a court order
and a really nasty disposition.

113
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:55,189
Anything for our friends at the Bureau.

114
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:01,362
Nice work, partner.

115
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,156
You're not my partner.

116
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,908
There's only one person
I ever trusted on this job,

117
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,412
and we all know how that turned out.

118
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:15,918
Schwinn Hornets. I had the
very same when I was their age.

119
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:20,548
Seeing white picket fences
and perfect family houses,

120
00:06:20,757 --> 00:06:22,258
it's enough to make one nostalgic.

121
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,302
Or nauseated.

122
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:25,720
Oh, come on, Ms. Lance.

123
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:27,207
Even someone as jaded as yourself

124
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:30,558
can't deny how idyllic this time was.

125
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:33,311
Yeah, if you're white.

126
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:34,520
And a man.

127
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:37,857
- And straight, and--
- Okay, okay. I get the point.

128
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:41,095
Dude, even if this town wasn't
full of small-minded idiots,

129
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,403
it'd still be creepy as hell.

130
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,966
I used to watch all these
old horror movies with my mom

131
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,618
and they all started off
in places like this.

132
00:06:48,785 --> 00:06:50,787
See, first it's all perfect,

133
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:52,955
and then, boom,
some alien monster beast thing

134
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:54,433
starts killing kids on Lovers' Lane.

135
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:55,958
- Ooh.
- I'm telling you, man.

136
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:00,671
<i>What is it?</i>

137
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:04,509
An unhappy cheerleader.
Now, that is scary.

138
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:07,428
That girl was from the newspaper
articles Rip showed us.

139
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:09,639
She knows the guys that went missing.

140
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:11,926
Perhaps she can illuminate us
as to their whereabouts.

141
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,685
Dude, can you not just say,

142
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,687
"Hey, Jax, why don't you go talk to her

143
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:18,054
"and find out what she knows?"

144
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:19,357
Like a normal person?

145
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:21,859
Hey, Jax, why don't you just go do that?

146
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:24,445
All right, we mustn't dawdle.

147
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,372
I believe our lunch hour
is nearly at an end.

148
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:29,117
Come along, Nurse.

149
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:30,952
Just so you know,

150
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,871
Ra's al Ghul taught me how to
kill someone slowly

151
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:36,290
over the course of days.

152
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:45,091
Hey, do you mind if I sit?

153
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:48,928
What is up with them?

154
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:52,265
Um...

155
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:55,375
I don't think they've seen anyone--

156
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:57,198
Dip their fries in their milkshake before?

157
00:07:58,646 --> 00:07:59,647
Oh.

158
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:02,042
Uh-uh. Don't knock it
till you tried it, girl.

159
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:03,401
No.

160
00:08:04,277 --> 00:08:05,403
Okay.

161
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:11,993
Okay, that's really good.

162
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,619
- Right?
- Yeah.

163
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:15,955
- I'm Jax.
- Betty.

164
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:18,082
Nice to meet you, Betty.

165
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:22,211
Hey, Betty, just because
your boyfriend went AWOL

166
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:24,298
doesn't mean you have to slum it
with this loser.

167
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,301
Why don't you do yourself a favor, Biff?

168
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:32,180
Keep walking before you really,
really embarrass yourself.

169
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,605
What? You want to take a swing at me?

170
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,568
Hey, let's go.

171
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:48,112
This isn't over.

172
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:54,285
I'm so sorry about that.
Uh, where were we?

173
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:55,453
No, that was amazing.

174
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:02,477
Do you want to hang out tomorrow night?

175
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:04,337
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

176
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,796
- It's a date.
- Okay.

177
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,614
Well, now that we're done moving in...

178
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,805
Care to dance?

179
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:17,475
Sure.

180
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,567
So, yesterday we kissed
and now today we're married.

181
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:27,961
Okay, I know it seems
like we're moving fast,

182
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,111
but this is all pretend.

183
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,698
As soon as we get a divorce,
we'll figure us out.

184
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:37,161
In the meantime, doesn't mean
we can't have fun with it.

185
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:41,457
This is a waste of time.

186
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:44,064
We should be out there looking
for Savage, not playing doctor.

187
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,211
You know what I mean.

188
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:46,379
I'd like to think that

189
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:49,632
in a town with multiple murders
and missing teenagers,

190
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,843
the local insane asylum would be
a fertile ground for clues.

191
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:54,553
Let's start by reviewing the files

192
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,400
of every inmate
with a history of violence.

193
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:01,519
If you wouldn't mind getting me
those files, Nurse?

194
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,690
Literally, four days.

195
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,205
<i>Is that
a new perfume I smell?</i>

196
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:23,475
You know, if you're trying to
drive everyone crazy,

197
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,376
I have to tell you, it's working.

198
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:26,794
I'm very busy right now.

199
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:28,161
You know what your problem is?

200
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:30,214
<i>You don't know how to have a good time.</i>

201
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:33,676
Now, what you need is a man
who can show you--

202
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,220
Uh...

203
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:37,596
Oops.

204
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,813
Thank you. That was incredible.

205
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:48,399
Well, maybe next time he'll take
no for an answer.

206
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,403
Uh, it's not just him.

207
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,656
Most of the doctors here
are looking for a good time,

208
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,700
and most of the nurses all say yes

209
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,387
'cause they're looking to get married.

210
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,912
Hmm. Not you, though?

211
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:05,416
I'm not really looking for a husband.

212
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:11,005
Today is my first day.
Care to give the new girl a tour?

213
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,262
The files you asked for, Doctor.

214
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:19,847
Excellent, Nurse.

215
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:22,016
I could also go for a cup of coffee.

216
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,269
Me, too. Black. Two sugars.

217
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,149
And the cafeteria is over there.

218
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:32,716
It's better than what we serve
the patients, but not by much.

219
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:33,778
- Mmm.
- Oh.

220
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,322
And what's down there?

221
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,492
Oh, that's Hall H, the restricted ward.

222
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:43,454
It's for Dr. Knox's patients.
Violent psychotics.

223
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,208
That part of the tour is worth skipping.

224
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,672
Coming. I'm coming.

225
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,026
Welcome to the neighborhood!

226
00:11:57,468 --> 00:12:01,013
Thank you. Thank you so much, Miss...

227
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:06,185
Mrs. Knox. Gail Knox.
And this is my husband Curtis.

228
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,020
Lovely to meet you.

229
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,814
I'm sorry, have we met before?

230
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,899
I doubt it.

231
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:58,696
Uh... We just moved in
from way out of town.

232
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,364
I hope you like tuna surprise.

233
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:02,867
You kidding? I love
tuna surprise... Oh, my God!

234
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:06,662
Raymond, these are our new neighbors.

235
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,956
Curtis and Gail.

236
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:11,208
What a surprise! Tuna surprise.

237
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,128
So many surprises.

238
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:15,921
Well, another reason why we dropped by

239
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:18,024
was to let you know that
we're having a soiree tonight.

240
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,329
Stop by any time after 8:00,
we're just across the street.

241
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:21,793
Don't bother to ring the bell.

242
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:23,262
No, you just walk right on in.

243
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:26,765
It's that kind of neighborhood.

244
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,517
Savage doesn't think I recognize him,

245
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,686
which means he won't try to kill me.

246
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,230
He can't steal my powers
before I found them.

247
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:34,791
Don't forget, we also have to figure out

248
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,275
why he's killing the townsfolk.

249
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:38,110
Are you really eating that?

250
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:39,463
Say what you want about Savage,

251
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:40,807
he makes one hell of a casserole.

252
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:41,945
Yes, well, Mr. Snart and I

253
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,700
have been analyzing these forensic files.

254
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,035
Which reveal nothing

255
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:50,206
except Savage is very good
at making people disappear.

256
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,012
That's something you both have in common.

257
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,991
What, we're just gonna pretend
like none of this happened?

258
00:13:57,505 --> 00:13:59,423
<i>That Mick Rory wasn't a part of our team?</i>

259
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,847
If you can just ice
your best friend like that,

260
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:03,761
I hate to think what you could do to us.

261
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:06,180
Right now, we need to
stay focused on the mission.

262
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:09,141
Look, Savage is going to be busy
with his little cocktail party.

263
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,768
<i>Whilst you two keep an eye on him,</i>

264
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:12,329
Sara and Martin have the opportunity

265
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:15,022
to find out what he's doing in
the secret wing of that asylum.

266
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:25,115
If you're looking for booze,
you're in the wrong office.

267
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,451
Dr. Knox doesn't drink.

268
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:31,330
But I know where Dr. Enbom
keeps the good stuff.

269
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:47,805
Oh, there you are, dear. I could
go for another glass of bubbly.

270
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,141
Then I suggest you find a waitress.

271
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:54,562
- I just assumed--
- You assumed wrong.

272
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:57,267
So why don't you go ahead
and get your own champagne?

273
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:02,486
Wow. I guess this whole
interracial marriage thing

274
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:04,113
really is a novelty.

275
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:06,490
Go ahead and let them stare.

276
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:08,857
I've got the most beautiful
woman in the room in my arm.

277
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:10,494
I couldn't agree with you more.

278
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,454
Oh. Hello.

279
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:17,543
Uh, thank you for inviting us.
Your home is, um, very normal.

280
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,963
Well, we're just glad
that you could attend.

281
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,340
Let me fix you a drink.

282
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,345
Okay, we need to split up.

283
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:29,513
You check the back rooms,

284
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,515
and I'll see what I can find up here.

285
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,434
Are you sure that's a good idea

286
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:36,520
leaving you up here by yourself
with Savage?

287
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,814
I'm pretty sure

288
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:41,150
he's not gonna kill me
next to the canapés, Ray?

289
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,737
Go. I'll let you know if I need help.

290
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,577
You've been so many places.

291
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:53,871
It's like you've had three lives.

292
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:57,082
Me, I've never left Harmony Falls.

293
00:15:57,249 --> 00:16:00,252
That's your first mistake.
This town sucks.

294
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:02,713
Wow. You do not hold back.

295
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:04,997
I've learned life's too short.

296
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,427
So, you have a girlfriend?

297
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:10,596
Well, I just mean

298
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:12,523
it seems pretty obvious
you're not into guys.

299
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:18,312
Uh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

300
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:21,607
Okay. We don't have to talk
about it if you don't want to.

301
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:28,739
But, just so you know, I'm
really good at keeping secrets.

302
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:39,458
Funny you should say that,
I did kiss a girl once.

303
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:45,297
And I didn't think
that made me, you know...

304
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,132
A lesbian?

305
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:49,677
What?

306
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:50,969
It's not a bad word.

307
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,432
Well, it is around here.

308
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,521
Well, good thing
I'm not from around here.

309
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,652
Uh, Nurse Lance, may I have
a word with you, please?

310
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,970
Well, now I see what's been going on.

311
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,193
While I've been busy working,

312
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,120
you were busy seducing that young woman.

313
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,122
Actually, I was liberating her

314
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:20,958
with an option to seduce her later.

315
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:24,002
Then what? This poor young woman
will have to remain

316
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,046
in the sexually oppressive 1950s,

317
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,813
long after you've returned to a Timeship

318
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:29,485
and disappeared from her life forever.

319
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:30,718
You know what, Doc?

320
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,803
I would love for someone
to drop into my life

321
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,130
and tell me that the future
is gonna be a better place.

322
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,049
Oh.

323
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:38,809
<i>Get to Hall H.</i>

324
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,190
Your husband must be a fool

325
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,235
to leave a woman such as
yourself alone at a party.

326
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:51,280
He doesn't seem like your type.

327
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:55,367
It's a rather interesting thing
to say, you hardly know me.

328
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,246
And yet I feel like I do.

329
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:02,750
Let me ask you a question, Kendra.

330
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,587
Do you believe in past lives?

331
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,894
Do you believe in fate?

332
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,146
Fate is a prison.

333
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:26,607
When free will is gone, what's left?

334
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:29,943
Destiny.

335
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,030
Oh.

336
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:39,578
Hello.

337
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:43,707
Yeah, I understand.
Of course, I'm on my way.

338
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,754
Looks like we have to finish
our discussion later.

339
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:51,006
One of my patients needs attention.

340
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:53,884
Enjoy the party.

341
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:14,363
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy,

342
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,824
I thought the two of us
had an understanding.

343
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:19,243
I've allowed you and your cohorts

344
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,537
the occasional freedom to run free

345
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:26,416
and to feast your thirst and
then you do something like this?

346
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:40,597
I'm sorry, Mr. Palmer,

347
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:43,934
I'm unfamiliar with the term "man cave."

348
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:46,461
Oh, it's a room in a basement
where a dude goes to be alone,

349
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:47,604
or watch football.

350
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,940
Uh, in Savage's case, it's kill people.

351
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:51,608
So, Ray and I break in

352
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,777
and find out what Savage
is doing in Harmony Falls.

353
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,657
- Oh, ho, ho!
- Oh-ho.

354
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:01,243
Is tonight the Enchantment
Under the Sea dance?

355
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:02,554
I got a date tonight

356
00:20:02,578 --> 00:20:04,258
with Tommy Fuller's
cheerleader girlfriend.

357
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,622
Turns out Betty's boyfriend

358
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,583
was one of the missing high school kids.

359
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:10,168
I think she knows
more than she's letting on.

360
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:13,964
Hmm. She's also a white girl in a
very, uh, unenlightened community.

361
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:17,885
So, please be careful when
you are out in public with her.

362
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,678
An immortal psychopath and racists.

363
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:20,846
I'm beginning to like

364
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:22,533
this quaint little town less and less.

365
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,444
<i>How's it going over there?</i>

366
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:36,987
I'm in.

367
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:39,823
What do you see?

368
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:41,909
Uh...

369
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,827
Nothing all that hideous.

370
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:47,080
Except for a terrible collection
of golf pants.

371
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,000
Hang on.

372
00:20:58,884 --> 00:21:00,177
Ray.

373
00:21:00,886 --> 00:21:02,304
<i>Ray, it's Savage. He's back.</i>

374
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:04,640
<i>Did you hear me, Ray?</i>

375
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,059
<i>You need to get out of there!</i>

376
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:08,435
I think I found something.

377
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,771
<i>No, no, no. You don't have time.</i>

378
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:12,731
<i>He's already inside.</i>

379
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,513
Do you ever get freaked out
in being in an insane asylum

380
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,891
by yourself in the middle of the night?

381
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:49,518
Freaked out, no.

382
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:53,063
Lonely, yes.

383
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:58,986
Actually, there is one place
in the hospital that scares me.

384
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:01,238
Dr. Knox's restricted wing.

385
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:05,200
Do you know what he is doing
to the patients down there?

386
00:22:06,243 --> 00:22:08,912
No. I don't like to think about it.

387
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:11,081
What do you like to think about?

388
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:22,092
What's wrong?

389
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:25,846
Nothing. I just...
I have to get back to work.

390
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:32,894
You look great tonight.

391
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,901
Whoa. Whoa.

392
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:43,462
I'm sorry. I thought that...

393
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:45,782
No, don't be sorry. It's just, uh...

394
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:49,369
I thought girls from 1958
moved a little bit slower.

395
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,497
"Girls from 1958"?

396
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,709
I mean, uh... I think we should

397
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:57,796
get to know each other
a little bit better first.

398
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:02,299
Okay, what do you wanna know?

399
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:05,886
Those guys back at the soda shop,

400
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:08,430
they mentioned something
about your boyfriend going AWOL.

401
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:11,349
Tommy.

402
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:12,976
What happened to him?

403
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:14,311
It's kind of a long story.

404
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:16,957
Well, I got all the time in the world.

405
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:22,069
We were drag racing down
on Route 7 with Davis and Billy

406
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:25,447
when Tommy's car went into a ditch.

407
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:28,825
- That's when they found it.
- Found what?

408
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:30,660
This--

409
00:23:30,827 --> 00:23:32,621
Been looking all over for you.

410
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:35,207
- Get out! Get out of the car!
- No!

411
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:36,958
Hey, get the hell off me, man.

412
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,504
Stop it! Stop it!

413
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:47,469
Get in! Get in!

414
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:51,181
Go!

415
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,937
Oh, come on!

416
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:00,357
Tommy?

417
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:11,409
I'm not playing anymore.

418
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,502
Don't worry, Betty,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

419
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:28,677
Nice driving.

420
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:30,595
Hang in there. Gideon's gonna fix you.

421
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:34,766
- Who's Gideon?
- A doctor, of sorts.

422
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:42,065
You need to pull over, Jax.

423
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,783
Hey, relax.

424
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,579
Yeah, 'cause it's not like I'm
a black kid in a small town

425
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:57,789
with a white girl
bleeding all over my seat.

426
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:04,880
You were driving
to beat the devil back there.

427
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:06,756
That explain
why your car looks like hell?

428
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:08,443
I need to get my friend to a hospital.

429
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:10,260
- Friend?
- Yeah.

430
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:11,904
And there's more wounded on Lovers' Lane.

431
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,471
Some kind of attack.

432
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:16,038
Now, what were you doing with
this girl on Lovers' Lane, boy?

433
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,369
There are kids back there
that could really use your help

434
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:20,103
and she needs medical attention right now.

435
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,160
Put your hands on the car and spread 'em.

436
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,066
Listen, you can play
Boss Hogg all you want,

437
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:27,152
but I'm not gonna
let that girl bleed to death.

438
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,361
So, I'll tell you what.

439
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:29,672
I'm gonna get back in my car,

440
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:31,256
and I'm gonna take her to the hospital.

441
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:51,218
Gideon traced Jax's last
bio-signature to this location.

442
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,000
<i>Well, it seems you had good reason</i>

443
00:25:58,141 --> 00:26:00,393
to be concerned for Mr. Jackson's safety.

444
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,104
Yeah, sucks being right all the time.

445
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,944
<i>She has suffered several
severe lacerations.</i>

446
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,654
<i>I'm attempting to cauterize the wound.</i>

447
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:12,322
- What happened?
- I don't know,

448
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:13,949
but I'm guessing Jax and Peggy Sue

449
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:15,700
had a pretty lousy first date.

450
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:17,160
Where is Jefferson?

451
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,454
There was no sign of him
in the car.

452
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:23,208
These wounds don't appear
consistent with a knife.

453
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,003
<i>Correct. I believe these
lacerations were made by talons.</i>

454
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:28,755
It's Tommy.

455
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:31,716
Tommy Fuller,
one of the missing teenagers.

456
00:26:31,883 --> 00:26:33,843
He's like a bird, he...

457
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:36,137
Like a bird monster.

458
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,515
<i>Captain, analysis of
Ms. Seaver's blood</i>

459
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:40,517
<i>reveals traces of silicate minerals.</i>

460
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,020
Ms. Seaver, do you recall

461
00:26:44,187 --> 00:26:48,191
Tommy coming into contact
with a meteor of some kind?

462
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:50,026
The car crash.

463
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:52,028
It was...

464
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:53,363
It was glowing.

465
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,532
She's talking
about an Nth metal meteorite.

466
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:58,076
Say something that makes sense.

467
00:26:58,243 --> 00:26:59,803
It seems Mr. Fuller's come into contact

468
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:02,205
with a meteorite
with mutagenic properties.

469
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:03,581
Try again.

470
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:05,108
Apparently, Ms. Seaver's boyfriend

471
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,888
has been exposed to
the same type of meteor

472
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:09,170
<i>that Kendra came into contact with.</i>

473
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:10,880
Me?

474
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:14,592
Well, you and Carter, 4,000 years ago.

475
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,803
The meteorite which gave you your powers

476
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,430
appears to be of the same variety

477
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:20,223
that mutated Tommy Fuller.

478
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,225
And I'm guessing it's not curable.

479
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,854
I suppose if the talons
which lacerated her

480
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:27,230
left some mutagenic residue

481
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:29,232
- I could--
- Yes or no?

482
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,192
Perhaps.

483
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,039
Why don't you get to work on that, Martin?

484
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:37,574
Okay, so if Savage isn't the one
doing the killing,

485
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:39,367
what is he doing in town?

486
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:40,702
Doesn't matter.

487
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,122
We can take him down.

488
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:45,609
The Amon Dagger. Where did you...

489
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:46,916
<i>Savage's house.</i>

490
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,419
All right. We need to
proceed on two fronts.

491
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:53,048
Locate Jefferson and make
an all-out assault on Savage.

492
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:55,342
A full-on attack only plays
to Savage's strengths.

493
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:56,968
If we want to get him...

494
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:58,553
We need to target his weaknesses.

495
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:00,930
Sadly, very few come to mind.

496
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:03,224
I can think of one.

497
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:05,769
Me.

498
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,438
He wants me and he always has.

499
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,274
So, if I can get
close enough to him, then--

500
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:12,650
Then he'll kill you.

501
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:15,779
Thank you for the vote of confidence,

502
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:17,447
but I don't need your protection.

503
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:19,574
There's no reason to go alone.

504
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,201
We're a part of a team for a reason.

505
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:25,038
Yes, and the team seems
comfortable with me doing this.

506
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:26,790
So, that makes it about you and me.

507
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:35,757
- Any updates?
- We're making progress.

508
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,301
In the meantime, we need to
get ready to back Kendra up.

509
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:40,512
She's going into the asylum
to meet Savage tonight.

510
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:43,348
Another opportunity for you
to see Nurse Carlisle.

511
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,268
Yeah, and apologize.

512
00:28:49,312 --> 00:28:50,772
I warned you, Ms. Lance.

513
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,441
Rushing a repressed woman from the 1950s

514
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:55,819
into the freewheeling sexual mores

515
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:57,278
of the 21st century--

516
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:59,045
Actually, I was the one who freaked out.

517
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:01,116
Oh.

518
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:04,119
Ever since I got brought back to life,

519
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:08,832
I haven't really experienced
much in the way of feelings,

520
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,001
and then when Lindsey kissed me--

521
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:15,004
It was like you were
being kissed for the first time.

522
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,091
How romantic.

523
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:19,509
It was more like terrifying.

524
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,846
That's the thing
that sucks about feelings,

525
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:26,224
is you realize how much
you can hurt someone

526
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:29,310
or get hurt.

527
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:33,022
Wakey-wakey.

528
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:39,404
Do the words "police brutality"
mean anything to you?

529
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:40,697
You think this is brutal?

530
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:43,199
You'll be begging for me
after he gets through with you.

531
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:47,704
That's enough, Sheriff.
Thank you. Leave us be.

532
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:52,083
This young man
and I have a lot to discuss.

533
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,961
Forgive my friend for his ignorance.

534
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:57,547
You will learn that
I'm much more enlightened.

535
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:00,675
Well, I'll take racist
over crazy any day.

536
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:05,555
Oh, I'd hardly describe
what I'm doing here as crazy.

537
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:09,893
Therapy is nothing more than
a process of self-discovery.

538
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:14,063
And you are about to experience
an extraterrestrial power.

539
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:15,648
Shall we begin?

540
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:46,471
What a piece of work is man.

541
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,308
When I was exposed to a meteorite

542
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:53,937
I was blessed with eternal life,
immortality.

543
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:57,857
<i>But sadly, the effect of this meteorite</i>

544
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:00,610
turned out quite differently.

545
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:02,987
But no less advantageous.

546
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:05,949
Doc, you have a visitor.

547
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,425
What a pleasant surprise.

548
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:26,386
Is it a surprise?

549
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:27,845
Or fate?

550
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:31,966
We didn't get to finish
our discussion the other night.

551
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:34,936
What of your
square-jawed husband Raymond?

552
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:37,981
I didn't come here
to talk about my husband,

553
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:39,816
Doctor.

554
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,318
May I?

555
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:45,697
May I take your coat?

556
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,579
<i>Make yourself comfortable.</i>

557
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:53,997
Nurse.

558
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:55,915
Nurse, I keep hearing voices in my head.

559
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:58,543
My wife with another man,

560
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:00,795
and it's driving me crazy.

561
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:03,673
Maybe you should learn to trust
your wife a little bit more.

562
00:32:04,507 --> 00:32:07,719
Orderly. Show our new patient
to his room.

563
00:32:08,845 --> 00:32:10,485
And don't hesitate to give him a sedative

564
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:12,015
if he doesn't calm down.

565
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,891
Right away, Nurse.

566
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:26,613
I'm sure the kid is fine.

567
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,532
Jefferson and I, as you know,
share a psychic connection.

568
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:33,244
But for some inexplicable reason
I can't seem to reach him.

569
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:36,289
I've grown so accustomed
to our partnership,

570
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:38,791
to suddenly be without him is disquieting.

571
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,251
I know the feeling.

572
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:47,717
So, have you tried psychoanalysis before?

573
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:49,594
No.

574
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:52,221
My husband thinks it's baloney.

575
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:53,556
Oh, is that so?

576
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:57,644
Well, my specialty is
interpreting dreams.

577
00:32:58,603 --> 00:32:59,812
What do you dream, Kendra?

578
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:01,564
To be honest,

579
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,609
I've dreamt of you before,

580
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:06,402
and me.

581
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,572
Together.

582
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:11,574
Well, that's interesting.

583
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:15,244
And what do we do in those dreams?

584
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:18,915
I'm afraid you'll think me forward.

585
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:20,917
Oh, but you are forward,

586
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,670
coming here in that dress.

587
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:26,798
Perhaps you should
learn to embrace your desires

588
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:29,092
so the two of us can finally be together.

589
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:38,059
Did you lose something?

590
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:41,521
I was wondering how long

591
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:43,815
you could play out this little charade.

592
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,111
You show up on my doorstep
and then my dagger goes missing.

593
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,738
You must think me stupid

594
00:33:50,905 --> 00:33:53,533
not to suspect
that your powers had emerged.

595
00:33:57,537 --> 00:34:02,291
Well, well, well, an FBI agent
moonlighting at the loony bin.

596
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:05,545
I'm afraid both of you boys
have some explaining to do,

597
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:06,963
down at the station.

598
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,133
Who else have you
brought to the asylum tonight?

599
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,635
No one. No one! It's just me.

600
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:15,638
I hope you're better at lying
in your next life.

601
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:23,187
Oh, boy.

602
00:34:23,354 --> 00:34:25,034
Just when you think
you've seen everything.

603
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:34,031
Guess those missing kids
are no longer missing.

604
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,784
What have you done?

605
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:39,996
I released my test subjects.

606
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:42,999
The energy from the meteorite
has changed them.

607
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:46,502
I set out to build
an army as powerful as you,

608
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:50,006
pity they didn't turn out
nearly as beautiful.

609
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:03,186
Oh, my God.

610
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:05,646
<i>It's Jefferson.</i>

611
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:09,025
Jefferson, it's us!

612
00:35:15,198 --> 00:35:16,616
Jax! Don't make me do this!

613
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:38,221
I'll deal with this lot. Find Kendra now.

614
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:06,165
I can explain, just not now.

615
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:18,511
Perhaps it'll turn out better
in our next life, my love.

616
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:22,598
Are you okay?

617
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,658
It's time to go.

618
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:43,286
Not without Jefferson.

619
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,288
<i>Or whatever's left of him.</i>

620
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:52,795
Gideon was able to help me
devise a gene therapy

621
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:54,442
that will hopefully restore Jefferson

622
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,258
and those at the asylum
to their former selves.

623
00:36:57,425 --> 00:36:59,635
If genome bonding occurs
we should know right away.

624
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:01,470
Of course, we'd never have had

625
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:03,848
the slightest chance of saving
him were it not for you.

626
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:05,725
Let's not get sentimental.

627
00:37:05,892 --> 00:37:08,811
Another minute and things might
have gone down very differently.

628
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:11,272
Despite your bravado, Mr. Snart,

629
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:13,708
the actions that I witnessed last night

630
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:15,401
were nothing short of heroic.

631
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:25,786
It's working.

632
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,961
Hey.

633
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:36,797
How are our friends doing over in Hall H?

634
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:39,634
Whatever Dr. Stein gave those
creatures seemed to have worked.

635
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:41,302
They're back to normal.

636
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:46,057
And you?

637
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:49,685
I'm not sure if I'm ever
gonna get fully back to normal.

638
00:37:51,354 --> 00:37:52,355
Good.

639
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:03,032
Thank you

640
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:04,867
for rescuing me.

641
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:07,411
Well, you rescued me first so...

642
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:09,872
Now we're even.

643
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:12,208
You have to go, don't you?

644
00:38:14,168 --> 00:38:15,169
I get it.

645
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:18,255
Should've known better
than to fall for a ninja.

646
00:38:23,678 --> 00:38:26,013
Who knows? Maybe I'll be back one day.

647
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:29,058
- And if so...
- You know where to find me.

648
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:37,358
So, I felt bad about trashing your dad's.

649
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:39,542
Uh, I thought this might make up for it.

650
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:41,946
You bought me a car?

651
00:38:42,113 --> 00:38:44,490
I souped it up too, in case of
future monster attacks.

652
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,453
- I wish you didn't have to go.
- Yeah.

653
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,747
I don't belong here.

654
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:53,249
And neither do you.

655
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:56,794
Promise me you'll get out
of this town, the both of you.

656
00:38:58,129 --> 00:38:59,130
Tommy.

657
00:38:59,797 --> 00:39:01,465
It's a great big world out there, Betty,

658
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,925
and it's changing fast.

659
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:05,644
Maybe we'll catch up
down the road somewhere.

660
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:15,604
Hey. I was just packing up.

661
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:17,165
I thought you were back at the <i>Waverider.</i>

662
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:18,441
I just forgot something.

663
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:20,523
I forgot to say I'm sorry.

664
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:23,821
Look, I was wrong to think that I could

665
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:26,032
- actually end Savage by myself.
- Whoa. Whoa.

666
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:27,700
Whoa, whoa. Just slow down.

667
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:29,493
I made a mistake, too.

668
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:32,079
I got so caught up playing house

669
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:35,291
that I forgot about
why we were really here.

670
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,418
And you will end Savage someday.

671
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:41,338
I guess that last thing
a 4,000-year-old demi-goddess needs

672
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:43,549
is an over-protective husband.

673
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:47,136
What she needs is a partner.

674
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:49,555
What do you say?

675
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:54,935
Partner.

676
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:07,948
Well, look who's up and around.

677
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:10,117
Hmm. Yeah.

678
00:40:11,202 --> 00:40:13,996
I guess I owe you an apology.

679
00:40:14,163 --> 00:40:16,248
Grey told me about what happened
back at the asylum.

680
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:19,335
You had the chance to kill me
and you didn't.

681
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:22,082
After last night, I know
enough about being a monster

682
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:23,506
to know that you're not one.

683
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:25,341
Stop. I'm getting misty-eyed.

684
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:28,344
I just want you to know,

685
00:40:29,637 --> 00:40:30,846
about what happened with Rory,

686
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:33,015
I get it.

687
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:35,226
You were protecting us.

688
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:36,828
And that doesn't make you a murderer,

689
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:38,229
it makes you a part of this team.

690
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:40,231
Jefferson, you should be resting.

691
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:42,191
Oh, man, I'm done laying around.

692
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:43,668
I just want to get
the hell out of Mayberry.

693
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:44,735
<i>Agreed.</i>

694
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:48,405
We're still waiting on Sara and
the two lovebirds to get back.

695
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:51,659
It seems they've taken
quite a shine to 1958.

696
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:54,411
What on earth?

697
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:56,038
Gideon?

698
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:58,290
Not this guy again.

699
00:40:58,457 --> 00:41:00,685
<i>Captain, Chronos has breached
the starboard hatch.</i>

700
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:01,710
How is that possible?

701
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,146
Clearly, he's received some new toys

702
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,023
from his Time Master friend,
since our last encounter.

703
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:07,383
Gideon, seal the bulkheads
from here until--

704
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:16,851
Grey, come on! Let's do this!

705
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:18,352
If we merge on the <i>Waverider,</i>

706
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,839
we could destroy the entire ship!

707
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:22,182
Are you not paying attention
to what Chronos is doing?

708
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,525
Fall back!

709
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:25,901
Get to the Jumpship!

710
00:41:31,073 --> 00:41:34,368
1958's swell and all,
but I miss the Internet.

711
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:36,912
And cell phones.

712
00:41:40,249 --> 00:41:41,250
Uh...

713
00:41:42,418 --> 00:41:43,836
What are they doing?

714
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:45,045
- Hey!
- Hey!

715
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,968
Where did they go?

716
00:41:52,428 --> 00:41:55,890
Better question, why did they leave us?

717
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:29,632
English - SDH
