1
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,950
CRASH

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,244
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, EVENTS,

3
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,955
GROUPS, AND BACKGROUNDS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTIONAL

4
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,752
When Jungwook was in LA…

5
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,045
<i>Why can't I reach you?</i>

6
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,379
<i>I won't wait long.</i>

7
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,758
Back then, you were always drunk
on alcohol and drugs.

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,178
What's wrong? What was the message about?

9
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,763
It's nothing.

10
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,142
Let's do ice today.

11
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,771
- You're good at injections, right?
- Yes.

12
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,608
Hey, tone it down.

13
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,359
You should think about your father--

14
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,363
This isn't murder.

15
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,201
Let me just blow off some steam.

16
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,744
Shall I have the guys bring it?

17
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,080
Tell them to bring something pure.

18
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,164
Okay.

19
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,971
Why are you so late?

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,557
Late? It took me less than five minutes.

21
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,310
Is it that punk again?
The police officer's son?

22
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:43,770
Goodness.

23
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,236
Don't use too much.
Your bones will weather.

24
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,278
Give me a break.

25
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,863
Wait here. He'll be out soon.

26
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:54,948
Yes, sir.

27
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,289
All right.

28
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,583
- It's going in.
- Take it out. Out!

29
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,909
Oh, Jungwook. My goodness.

30
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,077
Darn it.

31
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:42,996
Are you okay?

32
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,372
Please get in, sir.

33
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,418
- Look at that. A new car?
- Yes, it's a Mercedes-Benz 4MATIC.

34
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,961
It's perfect for speeding.

35
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,423
Jungwook!

36
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:01,639
You shouldn't drive.
I mean, it's a new car.

37
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,518
It isn't under your name, is it?
It's a burner car.

38
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:11,024
You little jerk. It's a violation
of the Motor Vehicle Management Act.

39
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,067
Do you want it to get confiscated?

40
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,115
So let me drive it once. I won't steal it.

41
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,953
Jungwook, let's get comfortable
in the back and have a drink.

42
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,749
I haven't been high in a while,
so I want to enjoy it, Mijin!

43
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,002
Hurry up and get in, you wench.

44
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,466
Damn it.

45
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,902
Thank you.

46
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,570
Thank you.

47
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,490
Have a good night.

48
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,168
Gosh! That bastard came out of nowhere!

49
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,127
Is he hurt?

50
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,755
- How could you drive that way?
- For goodness' sake.

51
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:16,965
Hey, don't get scared.

52
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,549
- Hey!
- Don't drive away!

53
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,176
That car is just driving off.

54
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,890
Hey!

55
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,314
Are you okay?

56
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:40,071
I'm at an alley
behind exit two of Sungoh Station.

57
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,323
A black sedan hit a motorcycle
and drove off.

58
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,582
- Jungwook!
- Whoa, whoa.

59
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,794
Darn it. What's going on?

60
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,171
What's up with that yellow bastard?

61
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,889
What do we do? He's following us.

62
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,517
Follow us all you want!

63
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,233
Stop the car!

64
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,362
- How could you hit someone and drive off?
- What the hell is he saying?

65
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,239
Jungwook.

66
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,492
That little…

67
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,956
Stop the car!
How could you youngsters be that way?

68
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,292
That yellow bastard is
getting on my nerves.

69
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,711
- I'll follow you until the end!
- He keeps following.

70
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,631
Let's just bribe him and make him leave.

71
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,343
- Don't turn this into a bigger problem.
- Damn it!

72
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,931
What are you doing?

73
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,019
Stop the car. It's dangerous.

74
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,065
That bastard!

75
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,072
Hey!

76
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,531
Goodbye!

77
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:42,068
CRASH

78
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,611
<i>I'm at…</i>

79
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,612
EPISODE 9

80
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,989
<i>…an alley
behind exit two of Sungoh Station.</i>

81
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,408
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- A black sedan</i>

82
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,410
<i>hit a motorcycle and drove off.</i>

83
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,954
<i>A black sedan? Do you have</i>
<i>the license plate number?</i>

84
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,915
<i>I couldn't see it because it was dark.</i>

85
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,292
<i>But it went toward Sungoh Bridge.</i>

86
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,421
The report to 112 was made at 1:34 a.m.

87
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,132
He got into an accident
while chasing a car

88
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,967
that hit a deliveryman and ran.

89
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,428
Have we confirmed
what happened at the scene?

90
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,054
Yes.

91
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,561
What's this? My goodness.

92
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:17,854
What's going on?

93
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,356
That's…

94
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,108
What a lunatic.

95
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,902
The driver was determined.
Is he trying to kill him?

96
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,779
Was it drunk driving?

97
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,866
- Did you identify the driver?
- We checked, but it's a burner car.

98
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,785
It's under a bankrupt company
with a ton of overdue bills.

99
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,079
So we don't know who the actual driver is.

100
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,206
No, but please watch the clip.

101
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,296
They're unlicensed taxi drivers
waiting near Gangnam.

102
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,299
If you look over there,
the black suspect vehicle was filmed.

103
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,342
I think it's an unlicensed taxi.

104
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,886
An unlicensed taxi in Gangnam?

105
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,847
Didn't Director General Lee Taeju
take on the case?

106
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,016
Why are they still roaming freely?

107
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,851
During our last investigation, we found

108
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,270
that each club had
a designated taxi company.

109
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,315
If we find the club,
we can identify the driver.

110
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,816
We put the car on the wanted list.

111
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,444
We have the dashcam video
from Lieutenant Min's father's taxi.

112
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,738
We'll identify the suspect soon.

113
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,822
We'll help too.

114
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,492
Tell us when you identify the driver.
We'll make the arrest.

115
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,578
That's right. Tell us if you need help.
We'll back you up.

116
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:19,665
Support the team with certainty.
Be genuine and fierce.

117
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,503
In any case, wrap up the case quickly,

118
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,046
with speed and precision.

119
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,479
This taxi is like her home.

120
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,316
Her mom passed away when she was young,

121
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,946
so I didn't want to leave her
at home alone.

122
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:55,660
That's why she always rode around
in my taxi.

123
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,121
She ate in here.

124
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,499
She studied in here.

125
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,251
She slept in here.

126
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,962
She practically grew up in here,

127
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,632
so I feel quite bad for her.

128
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,279
The visiting hours are over.

129
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,363
Okay.

130
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,164
Dad, hang in there.

131
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,209
I'll be waiting.

132
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,670
Okay?

133
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,674
I'll wait.

134
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,264
Ma'am.

135
00:09:58,931 --> 00:09:59,932
Okay.

136
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,731
I'll get going now. I'll come again.

137
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:25,875
Sohee.

138
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,961
Why are you…

139
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:34,008
Why did you come here? You have no right.

140
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,429
Can I help you with anything?

141
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,058
The culprit is an unlicensed taxi driver.

142
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,978
You took the Gangnam taxi case
and promised to take care of it.

143
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,440
This wouldn't have happened
had you investigated properly. So what--

144
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,233
What can you help me with?

145
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,202
Just go. You won't hear
anything good from me.

146
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,879
Sohee.

147
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,881
You wrapped up the case
with a few arrests.

148
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:17,051
It's ridiculous. Give the case
back to me and I'll start over.

149
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,178
The taxi drivers won't talk anyway.

150
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,514
We won't have a way
to check the client list.

151
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,891
Is it because of Deputy Commissioner Pyo?

152
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,060
Because his son is involved in this case?

153
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,978
Has there been any external pressure?

154
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,315
- It isn't like that.
- Then what?

155
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,443
Is it the opposite?

156
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,873
Why are you looking for him?

157
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,041
Do you know him?

158
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,421
Tell Mijin to come here.

159
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,480
They're looking for your man.

160
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,487
You know him, right?

161
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,157
Yes. His name is Byungchan.

162
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,742
Did you meet him yesterday?

163
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,162
Are you here because of that?

164
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,708
He was driving a customer home
and got into a fight with a taxi driver.

165
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,134
Lee Byungchan, age 33.

166
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,220
He has six convictions for assault,
extortion, drug distribution,

167
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,680
and illegal taxi operation.

168
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,601
Since March, he has been working
at Quick Call, an unlicensed taxi company.

169
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,937
But he suddenly stopped
coming to work yesterday.

170
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,107
The last person who used the taxi
was an employee named Yoon Mijin.

171
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,277
While driving a customer,
there was a collision with the motorcycle.

172
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,737
The taxi driver who followed--

173
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,447
It was Lieutenant Min's father.

174
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,574
Yes.

175
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,495
According to Ms. Yoon Mijin,

176
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,080
she got off with the customer midway.

177
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,208
So she doesn't know what happened after.

178
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,085
The accident occurred after they got off?

179
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,298
What about the customer who was with her?

180
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,591
Well…

181
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,558
Pyo Jungwook.
He's Commissioner General Pyo's son.

182
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:33,479
He's well-known in the scene.
He spends generously and has good manners.

183
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,190
His father is in the police,
so there's no worry about a bust.

184
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,192
Gosh, Commissioner General Pyo's son?

185
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,237
Wasn't he on the list
during the unlicensed taxi and drug case?

186
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,447
Meet up with Lee Byungchan first.

187
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,116
If it was an unlicensed taxi,
Lee Byungchan was the driver.

188
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,245
Check and see
if his car was caught on any cameras.

189
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,915
- What should we do with Pyo Jungwook?
- Let's meet him as a witness.

190
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,209
See if his story checks out
with Yoon Mijin's.

191
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,295
Yes, sir.

192
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,003
Who are you?

193
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,380
Who are you?

194
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,591
Why are you doing this to me?

195
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:45,926
Tell me.

196
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,596
Why are you doing this to me?

197
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,727
Excuse me. I don't know anything.

198
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,020
I really don't…

199
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,818
Jungwook!

200
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,528
Jungwook! Jungwook!

201
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,749
TRANSPORTATION
INFORMATION CENTER

202
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,506
Yes, Detective Woo.

203
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,093
<i>The suspect car was caught on camera
on a highway near Homyeong Junction.</i>

204
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,887
Okay.

205
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,517
Please show me the road
near Homyeong Junction.

206
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,063
On Local Highway 348 near Unho Bridge 1,

207
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,440
the suspect car was caught
on camera for speeding.

208
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,526
Local Highway 348 is connected
to Sinae Interchange.

209
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,113
Lee Byungchan's parents live in Haeju.
Perhaps he went there.

210
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,907
To go to Haeju, you need to pass

211
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,326
the North Haeju Interchange
and Mokgang Interchange.

212
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,995
He would've gotten caught
on traffic cameras.

213
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:59,333
So he's still between Mokgang-myeon
and Jeongdong-myeon.

214
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,961
This area has many mountains and lakes.

215
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,587
Did he hide the car there?

216
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,465
Rather than hiding the car,

217
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,717
getting rid of it would be better.

218
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,927
Will he scrap it?

219
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,305
Go through the junkyards in the area
and find the car.

220
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,433
Perhaps he ditched it in a lake.
See if there are any witnesses.

221
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,227
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

222
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,030
SCRAPPED CAR LIST

223
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,824
There hasn't been a black sedan.

224
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:36,245
I'm from Namgang Police Station.
Have you seen this black car?

225
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,538
I haven't seen it.

226
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,801
Hold on.

227
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,262
Please wait. Just a second.

228
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,019
This one.

229
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,774
If we were a little late,
it would've vanished.

230
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,110
He already took the SD card
from the dashcam.

231
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,904
I'll ask NFS to run forensics on the car.

232
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,156
<i>Okay. Well done.</i>

233
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,992
<i>Explain the situation thoroughly
to the forensic analysts.</i>

234
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,076
Yes, sir.

235
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,913
Will we get anything from the car?
It's in a bad shape.

236
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:20,956
Who knows?

237
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,709
We might be able to restore the ECU data.

238
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:27,755
Judging by the way he scrapped it
in a hurry, he must be hiding something.

239
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,590
You're right.

240
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,385
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

241
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,554
About the car from Namgang Police Station…

242
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,057
Didn't they say only the driver
was in the car?

243
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,767
Yes, they did. What about it?

244
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,895
I'm going through the information
on the EDR.

245
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,146
Something seems off.

246
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,273
Come check this out.

247
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,400
RECORDS INFORMATION
DURING COLLISIONS

248
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,030
What's this?

249
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,743
Check this out.

250
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:09,254
Seat belts were fastened
in the passenger seat and the back seat.

251
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,634
What? There must've been a driver, so…

252
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,929
At the time of the accident,
three people were in the car.

253
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,023
ANALYSIS ON SUSPECTED VEHICLE

254
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,235
On the upper part of the window
by the driver's seat,

255
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:33,695
Pyo Jungwook's blood and DNA were found.

256
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,240
The driver was Pyo Jungwook.

257
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,992
But Yoon Mijin said
she got out of the car--

258
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,621
Pyo Jungwook must've made her say that
in order to hide his crime.

259
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:51,255
Captain, what are you doing?
This bastard hurt Lieutenant's father.

260
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,965
He's Commissioner General Pyo's son.

261
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:56,301
If we go into this unprepared,
we'll suffer from a counterattack.

262
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,428
But we can't wait around like this.

263
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,223
If we stall, he may destroy the evidence.

264
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,102
We must get an arrest warrant
as soon as possible.

265
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,443
What about it?

266
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:20,033
Over here.
"Belted." Seat belts were fastened.

267
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,452
"Not belted." Seat belts weren't fastened.

268
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,954
I know what that means!

269
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,333
So what does this mean?

270
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,212
The driver was Pyo Jungwook.
Commissioner General Pyo's son.

271
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,801
Commissioner General Pyo's son?

272
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,928
I thought the culprit was a taxi driver.

273
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,890
Pyo Jungwook's blood and DNA
were found in the driver's seat.

274
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,227
Commissioner General Pyo's son?

275
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,354
DNA. Hold on.

276
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,109
Why did Commissioner General Pyo's son
suddenly enter the picture?

277
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,070
Are you certain about all this?

278
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,155
Yes, sir.

279
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,700
Hold on. Let me think.

280
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,160
We need to be careful.

281
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,330
Otherwise, everyone here will die.

282
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,332
Everyone will get fired!

283
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,543
We'll get a confession from the suspect
and request a warrant.

284
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:18,050
Are we really going
to go through with this?

285
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,885
We need to do this, right?

286
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,643
Oh, gosh. My goodness.

287
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,853
My goodness.

288
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,481
Oh, dear.

289
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,652
As a suspect?

290
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,779
Okay then.

291
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,031
I'm hanging up now.

292
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,251
<i>It appears Pyo Jungwook drove the car.</i>

293
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,710
<i>Commissioner General Pyo's son.</i>

294
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,255
<i>We have forensic analysis
and circumstantial evidence.</i>

295
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,804
Pyo Jungwook, was it you?

296
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,681
Were you really the driver?

297
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,475
Answer me!

298
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,979
- What the heck?
- She startled me.

299
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,565
Who are you?

300
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:19,361
How could you have a drinking party
after running over a man? That's nonsense!

301
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,989
Oh, right. You're talking
about that accident.

302
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,658
I'm sorry. I heard from my lawyer.

303
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,535
I heard that you're a police officer.

304
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,871
I have a question.
Is a police officer's salary that low?

305
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,665
Seeing that your father drives a taxi.

306
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,629
I mean, let's look on the bright side.

307
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,841
It'd be nice for him
to get a good rest at the hospital.

308
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,553
Hey, don't laugh. Fill up your glasses.

309
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,639
- Cheers.
- The detective's father is quite ill.

310
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:51,852
For your father's complete recovery!

311
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,145
Cheers!

312
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,396
Cheers!

313
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:00,319
But if anything were to go wrong,
don't worry.

314
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,530
I'll give a hefty amount
at his funeral as condolatory money.

315
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:06,658
- Wow! You're so cool!
- I'll be conscientious.

316
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,994
You crazy bastard!

317
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:12,205
What did you just say?

318
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:14,958
Hey!

319
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:16,877
Let's leave.

320
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,880
Inspector Cha, hold on.

321
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,340
- You bastard!
- Are you okay?

322
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,175
- Are you okay?
- What a lunatic.

323
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,718
Is she insane?

324
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,178
How entertaining.

325
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,680
Has she lost her mind? Are you okay?

326
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,767
- For goodness' sake.
- Gosh, totally.

327
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,477
Be quiet.

328
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,354
- She ruined the mood.
- I said, be quiet!

329
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,359
Yes, Father.

330
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,443
<i>Where are you?</i>

331
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,821
Well, I'm working out right now.

332
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:47,824
<i>Come outside.</i>

333
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,163
He doesn't even know where I am.

334
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,682
How did you know I was here?

335
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,310
What happened to your forehead?

336
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,480
It's nothing.

337
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,610
Seriously, stop it.

338
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:28,031
Hey, I told you to stay in your lane
when you play around.

339
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,867
If you want to do drugs or meet women,
do so in secret.

340
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,038
How long must I clean up your mess? Huh?

341
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,502
That's why I didn't tell you.
I'll take care of it myself.

342
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,089
How? What can you do on your own?

343
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,300
You only know how to drink
and cause trouble.

344
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,512
Do you still take me for a child?

345
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,181
- What did you say?
- Father.

346
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,601
Be honest. Do you want me to go to prison?

347
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,895
- Will you be relieved then?
- You little…

348
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,856
I'm doing this because of you.

349
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,733
So that I don't harm your career!

350
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,611
Do you remember what you told me?

351
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:12,576
Ever since I was little, you told me
to get what I want using any means.

352
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,703
I learned that lesson by heart.

353
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:19,124
So now, please just trust your son…

354
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:23,628
and watch from outside.

355
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,431
Damn it.

356
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:38,977
Damn it!

357
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,287
Thank you.

358
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,459
Are you okay?

359
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:06,963
How did you know I was there?

360
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,592
Pyo Jungwook's interrogation is tomorrow.

361
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,428
<i>I thought it'd be advantageous
to find Lee Byungchan first,</i>

362
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,055
<i>so I was on a stakeout.</i>

363
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,474
<i>Then I saw Pyo Jungwook.</i>

364
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,897
What?

365
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,946
I know why you went there.

366
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:44,251
Tomorrow, I'll prove that Pyo Jungwook

367
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,962
is the real culprit.

368
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,401
Lieutenant.

369
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:11,444
Captain.

370
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,905
Welcome back. How's your father?

371
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:19,119
Well, he's getting a little better
day by day.

372
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,039
I want to observe
the interrogation with Pyo Jungwook.

373
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,124
Would that be okay?

374
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,298
Inspector Cha.

375
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,408
SEOUL NAMGANG POLICE STATION
WILL PROTECT

376
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,660
THE CITIZENS' DAILY LIVES

377
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,417
Gosh, I see you so often.

378
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,210
Are you a stalker or something?

379
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,005
Geez, is she the only detective here?

380
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,019
Before we begin,

381
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:29,314
I'd like to inform the suspect
that he can refuse to make statements.

382
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,276
You have a lawyer present
during the interrogation, right?

383
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,112
Yes, I am the suspect's lawyer.

384
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:44,663
According to Ms. Yoon Mijin,
who was in the car during the accident,

385
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,790
she sat behind the driver's seat

386
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:50,001
and Mr. Pyo Jungwook sat
behind the passenger seat.

387
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,088
- Is it true?
- Yes.

388
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:57,008
When you were in the car,
did you put on the seat belt?

389
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,803
No.

390
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,262
When you got in the car,

391
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,182
was the seat belt fastened?

392
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,642
Say that you don't remember.

393
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,770
I don't remember.

394
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,605
When you got out of the car,

395
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:15,360
- did you leave the seat belt fastened?
- Say that you don't remember.

396
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,613
I have no recollection.

397
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,745
This is the EDR information
of Lee Byungchan's car

398
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,039
from the moment of the accident.

399
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,042
As you can see,

400
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,420
the seat belts were fastened
in the passenger seat

401
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,171
and the seat behind it.

402
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,884
Do you know what this means?

403
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,430
My client got out of the car
before the accident occurred,

404
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,973
so he knows nothing about this.

405
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,394
According to Ms. Yoon Mijin,

406
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:53,523
the car took off right after
she and Mr. Pyo Jungwook got out.

407
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,734
Lee Byungchan was busy running away.

408
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,403
There's no way he went
to the empty passenger seat

409
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:01,823
and the seat behind it
to fasten the seat belts.

410
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,118
What do you think?

411
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,748
How would I know?

412
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:15,044
My client's claim is consistent.

413
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,796
He got out before the accident,

414
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,382
so he doesn't know
what happened afterward.

415
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,762
Mr. Pyo Jungwook.

416
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:27,766
When did you get the wound
on the left side of your forehead?

417
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,017
Oh, this?

418
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,145
I got it while exercising.

419
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,649
It's not from when you hit it
on the window of Lee Byungchan's car?

420
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:42,280
On top of the driver's seat window
of Lee Byungchan's car,

421
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,365
your blood and DNA have been found.

422
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,203
On the driver's side seat and floor,

423
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,039
the fiber of the clothes
you were wearing has been found.

424
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,754
Here is the forensic analysis.

425
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:03,802
Judging by the blood, DNA,
and fiber I had just mentioned,

426
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,387
the passengers' seats are as follows.

427
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,682
Pyo Jungwook in the driver's seat.

428
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:15,146
Lee Byungchan in the passenger seat
and Yoon Mijin in the back seat.

429
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,941
All the evidence

430
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:21,528
tells us that you were the driver
at the time of the accident.

431
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,282
Will you continue to play innocent?

432
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:31,120
Such simulations can only be used
as reference material in court.

433
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,331
Don't you know
these aren't direct evidence?

434
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,834
These are just circumstantial evidence.

435
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,001
Mr. Pyo Jungwook.

436
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,337
That night,

437
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,257
you drove the car, didn't you?

438
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,676
Let me repeat.

439
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,095
My client got out of the car
before the accident.

440
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,347
You drove the car, didn't you?

441
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,599
You were afraid of the truth getting out,

442
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,977
so you made up a lie
about getting out beforehand.

443
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,781
Thank you so much for your hard work.

444
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,492
My heart is beating so fast
because I feel like the culprit.

445
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,286
But you know,

446
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,457
such evidence is useless.

447
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,043
Bring me something cool.

448
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:24,048
Did you think that you could arrest me
with such lousy evidence?

449
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,080
How may I help you?

450
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,417
Oh, well.

451
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,253
I'm here to turn myself in.

452
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,260
Captain, Mr. Lee Byungchan
came to turn himself in.

453
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,099
What's this? Turn himself in?

454
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,226
I think he talked to Pyo Jungwook.

455
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,145
Otherwise, the timing is…

456
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,859
- I'll go in.
- Donggi, go in.

457
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,486
- I'll go in.
- Hey!

458
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,446
Don't you know the rules?

459
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:32,700
Donggi, go in.

460
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,286
Lieutenant.

461
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:49,092
The taxi driver followed me persistently.

462
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:53,346
I became angry
and did it without thinking.

463
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,349
Who was in the car
at the time of the accident?

464
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,309
I was alone.

465
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,230
I had a passenger, but he got out before.

466
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,358
Are you certain
he got out before the accident?

467
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,862
Why would I lie about that?

468
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,531
I was alone.

469
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,741
Seat belts were fastened
in the passenger seat

470
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,576
and the seat behind it.

471
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,997
Oh, that.

472
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:23,167
I fastened them. It's a habit of mine.

473
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,795
I do it so it's more convenient
for the passengers.

474
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,588
Do you expect me to believe that?

475
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,756
It's true.

476
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,926
Gosh, I'm getting hounded
because of my strange habit.

477
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,556
Why did you scrap the car right away,
if you were planning to turn yourself in?

478
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,224
I did that

479
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,601
because the car was badly damaged.

480
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:44,063
It would've happened sooner or later
since it was a burner car.

481
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,152
In any case…

482
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,155
I'm sorry.

483
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:58,494
I'm really sorry about what happened
to the taxi driver.

484
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,040
Here.

485
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,263
- All of it.
- You were very natural.

486
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,723
I was so nervous.

487
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:22,226
- Really? You didn't look that way.
- I was extremely nervous.

488
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,937
Can we go now?

489
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,065
Yeah?

490
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,159
When can we go?

491
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,511
I heard the culprit turned himself in.

492
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,471
I told you I didn't do it.

493
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,431
A selfie.

494
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,603
I'll keep it a secret from my father.

495
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,940
You became an officer recently,
so it'd be bad to get fired already.

496
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,069
Can't you hear me?

497
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,281
Why are there so many frustrating people?

498
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,243
Hey, Pyo Jungwook.

499
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,953
What?

500
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,996
I heard that the culprit got caught.

501
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,373
Congratulations. Wow.

502
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:30,461
Well, work hard.
We have nothing else to talk about.

503
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,629
All right, then.

504
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:38,219
I meant it when I said that I'd give
a lot of condolatory money.

505
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:40,888
What did you just say?

506
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,431
So give me a call.

507
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,727
- Lieutenant, calm down.
- You bastard.

508
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,479
How dare you say that?

509
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:49,605
Lieutenant.

510
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,235
These police officers are running wild!

511
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,655
What do you think you're doing?

512
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,159
You should've worked harder.

513
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,543
Lieutenant.

514
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,673
He got Lee Byungchan and Yoon Mijin
to tell his version of the story.

515
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,843
He was at a disadvantage,
so he had Lee Byungchan turn himself in.

516
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,887
I'm certain he promised monetary rewards.

517
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:26,392
If that's the case,
we need evidence like bank transactions.

518
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:28,311
We'll find the evidence.

519
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,189
Let's use what we have now
to request an arrest warrant.

520
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,066
Hold on. That'd be a bit…

521
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,486
I talked to a judicial officer earlier.

522
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,031
Though he's suspicious,
there's no direct evidence.

523
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:43,701
If the prosecution releases him
due to the lack of evidence,

524
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:48,080
Namgang Police Station
will be put in a difficult position.

525
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,082
Are you asking because you don't know?

526
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,668
He's Commissioner General Pyo's son!

527
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,213
Why would the prosecution dismiss it
despite the clear evidence?

528
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,339
How frustrating.

529
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:59,508
That man named Lee something
turned himself in.

530
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,761
Am I wrong? He pleaded guilty.

531
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,263
That means it's over!

532
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,706
I'm sorry.

533
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,296
It's my fault Pyo Jungwook walked free.

534
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,424
I should've considered
Lee Byungchan turning himself in.

535
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,759
Why would you be sorry?

536
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,179
Why are you sorry?
The guilty ones are just fine.

537
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,520
I'm so angry it's driving me crazy.

538
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:59,443
I'm a police officer, but I'm powerless
before the culprit who hurt my family.

539
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,571
It makes me so furious.

540
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,667
I promise to catch the culprit.

541
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,587
Pyo Jungwook.

542
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,300
I also have a reason to do so.

543
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,562
What's all this?

544
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,149
They're related to my past accident.

545
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,444
Why would you…

546
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,071
We were blackmailed.

547
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,615
Everyone here, including myself.

548
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,703
Yang Jaeyoung, Han Kyungsoo, Pyo Jungwook…

549
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:53,122
They're the witnesses of the accident.

550
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,795
Hold on. Those three were
the witnesses of your accident?

551
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,505
How is this possible?

552
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,507
Among them, Yang Jaeyoung was killed.

553
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,260
Han Kyungsoo is currently missing.

554
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,386
Missing?

555
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:11,891
HAN KYUNGSOO

556
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:14,643
- Hello?
<i>- Help me.</i>

557
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,438
<i>Help me. Pyo Jungwook…</i>

558
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,691
Hello?

559
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,069
<i>That day, I got a call from Han Kyungsoo.</i>

560
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,820
<i>He said Pyo Jungwook was after him.</i>

561
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,031
Mr. Han Kyungsoo.

562
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,158
<i>I visited his place the next day.</i>

563
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:37,166
<i>It looked like he had gone out,
but I couldn't reach him since then.</i>

564
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:41,837
Could it be that Pyo Jungwook
killed Han Kyungsoo?

565
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,298
Yes. There's a possibility.

566
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,426
Or it could be the culprit
who killed Yang Jaeyoung.

567
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:54,058
At the scene of his accident,
there was a black car with tinted windows.

568
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:57,061
At Sangsan Rest Area
where I ran into Han Kyungsoo,

569
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,896
I saw a similar car.

570
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,732
Captain is investigating that car.

571
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:02,983
Hold on.

572
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,444
What exactly happened in the past?

573
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,697
Who is after the witnesses? Why?

574
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,824
I mean…

575
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,077
Why did Pyo Jungwook and Han Kyungsoo--

576
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,665
All I know is that three high schoolers
drove a car without a driver's license.

577
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:22,336
They witnessed my accident by chance
and reported it to 911.

578
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,881
Was Pyo Jungwook the driver back then?

579
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,092
No, they said Han Kyungsoo was the driver.

580
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,386
The car was Pyo Myunghak's.

581
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,431
Han Kyungsoo drove Pyo Myunghak's car?

582
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,808
It's a pattern we're familiar with.

583
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,435
They switched the driver.

584
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,396
Could it be why Pyo Jungwook
is after Han Kyungsoo?

585
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:45,276
Even if that's the case,
it's no reason to kill a man.

586
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,862
After all, the one who caused the accident

587
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,530
was me.

588
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:54,785
It can only mean that
something else happened back then.

589
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,913
Is there anything else you remember?

590
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,999
Was there anything suspicious?

591
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,215
I can't remember it clearly,

592
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,092
no matter how hard I try.

593
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,222
Oh, right.

594
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,892
It must be a difficult memory for you.

595
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,979
Although it isn't clear,

596
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,983
there's an image I see regularly.

597
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,445
Lights?

598
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,821
I can't be certain.

599
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:35,201
Hold on. If you saw lights,
it must've been from the headlights.

600
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:39,497
Perhaps Pyo Jungwook did something
at the scene of the accident.

601
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,626
He might be killing off his accomplices
in order to cover it up.

602
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,252
If that's the case,

603
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:50,257
why did Commissioner General Pyo
give Yang Jaeyoung's case to Captain?

604
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,594
- Why did he send the letters too?
- You're right.

605
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,596
Then who on earth…

606
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,806
Where's the letter?

607
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:58,891
It's here.

608
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,479
This is what I received.
That's what Han Kyungsoo received.

609
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,233
As you can see,
the printing pattern is the same.

610
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,401
They're from the same printer.

611
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,076
It means they came from the same person.

612
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:20,663
What's certain is that Pyo Jungwook
did something in the past.

613
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:25,376
And that's why someone hurt
Yang Jaeyoung and Han Kyungsoo.

614
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,888
Did you confirm Lee Jungsub's alibi?

615
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,308
He was at the hospital at the time
of Han Kyungsoo's disappearance.

616
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,310
But we can't be certain.

617
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,729
There's a chance
he left the hospital secretly.

618
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,691
I guess they took the initiative.

619
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,819
I don't know if this is a good thing.

620
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,993
Yang Jaeyoung and Han Kyungsoo.

621
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,870
The next one will be…

622
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,004
Leave Lee Jungsub to me.

623
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:13,757
I'll… take care of him.

624
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:17,761
Myunghak, if he's the one
who killed Jaeyoung,

625
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,555
we can't give him the easy way out.

626
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:23,267
We're in no situation to get rid of him.

627
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,769
I'm the Commissioner General of Seoul.

628
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,522
We need to do it by the law!

629
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,737
Cha Yeonho was the one
who reported Han Kyungsoo missing.

630
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:36,363
What?

631
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,658
Han Kyungsoo called Cha Yeonho
just before he went missing.

632
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,995
Does that mean Han Kyungsoo
told Cha Yeonho?

633
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,079
Damn it!

634
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,709
- Commissioner General.
- What?

635
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,461
Let's corner them.

636
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,588
What?

637
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,526
<i>What? An evasive investigation?</i>

638
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,821
You can give an explanation
to the disciplinary committee.

639
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:18,989
Let's go.

640
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:33,170
Is this the best
Commissioner General has got?

641
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:36,590
Cutting me off
and putting you in my position?

642
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,178
Captain.

643
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,807
Reflect on your mistakes
before you start writing a novel.

644
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,227
Why'd you hesitate to investigate
Yang Jaeyoung's case?

645
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,729
Is there a reason why
the culprit cannot be caught?

646
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:57,027
"He that touches pitch shall be defiled."

647
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,822
You are becoming more and more
like Commissioner General.

648
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,408
Escort Captain out.

649
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,409
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

650
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,035
It's this way.

651
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:17,506
In the meantime,
I'll be the captain of TCI.

652
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,385
Report every development
in your investigation to me.

653
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:25,723
Why are you doing this?
What are you trying to hide?

654
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,183
I'm simply following
Commissioner General's order.

655
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,896
Do you even know what you're doing?

656
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:47,536
Why is the disciplinary committee
at Seoul Metropolitan Police?

657
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:48,996
Commissioner General called.

658
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:53,876
He asked me to send Captain
to Seoul Metropolitan Police

659
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:56,712
since he was the one
who assigned the case.

660
00:45:56,795 --> 00:46:00,966
He should've been given time
to prepare for the disciplinary committee.

661
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,968
He wasn't even given a notice to attend--

662
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:05,888
You're right. That's how it should be.

663
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,347
But this is…

664
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,183
What do you want me to do?

665
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,643
It was Commissioner General Pyo's order.

666
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:15,606
Was I supposed to ask
for a private meeting and attack him?

667
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,983
Was I supposed to go all out without fear?

668
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,444
This is a very difficult position.

669
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:21,862
A very difficult position.

670
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,530
As for me,

671
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,408
I'm struggling a lot too.

672
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:32,080
It's already past 10 p.m.

673
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:33,957
He's late.

674
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,961
What's going on?

675
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,467
- Captain.
- Why didn't you go home?

676
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,178
What did the disciplinary committee say?

677
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,721
Well…

678
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,475
Three months of disciplinary action.

679
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:55,020
Neglect of duty, excessive investigation,
and undermining the police prestige.

680
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,355
I couldn't believe it.

681
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,232
Don't worry about it.

682
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,070
Why is Commissioner General Pyo
doing this to you?

683
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:06,073
Why did he assign
Yang Jaeyoung's case to you

684
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,200
and submit you
to a disciplinary action for it?

685
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,620
What's the relationship
between the two of you?

686
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:30,305
This is my investigation of your accident
at Eunseong Police Station.

687
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,101
I went over your case thoroughly
because Jungsub asked me to.

688
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,311
There was one strange thing.

689
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,774
The initial report to 911.

690
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,616
The first report was made
from Han Kyungsoo's phone.

691
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,327
He called and hung up without a word.

692
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:56,832
The emergency dispatcher found it strange
and called him back repeatedly.

693
00:47:56,915 --> 00:48:00,043
Four minutes later,
the one who answered was

694
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,087
Han Kyungsoo.

695
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,383
Those four minutes.

696
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,387
I was suspicious about
what happened during that time.

697
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:19,062
During my interrogation,
Pyo Myunghak, who was Chief at the time,

698
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,814
suddenly entered the room.

699
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:25,193
I think you should be cool
and just admit it.

700
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:30,824
You need to be honest for me to help you.

701
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,917
I saw lights.

702
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,502
I can't be certain,

703
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:46,173
but I saw some lights
that crossed the center line.

704
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,301
Was there a car that crossed--

705
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:50,969
Hold on.

706
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,473
Mr. Cha Yeonho.

707
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,809
What are you talking about?

708
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,103
You killed a person by mistake.

709
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,356
Why are you coming up
with a strange excuse?

710
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,983
Is there evidence?

711
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,361
You'll only complicate the matter

712
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,947
if you behave this way
when there are witnesses.

713
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:11,949
Do you understand?

714
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:14,284
For goodness' sake.

715
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,827
<i>If your memory is correct,</i>

716
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:19,665
Pyo Myunghak intentionally left out
that part of the testimony.

717
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:25,253
Because the only car that could've crossed
the center line belonged to him.

718
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,256
If you and I

719
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,927
clung tenaciously
to what seemed trivial at the time,

720
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,430
things might've been different now.

721
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:37,975
I was planning to do so,

722
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,520
but I was transferred
to the countryside right after.

723
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:42,646
Transferred?

724
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:45,565
Gosh, it was only a transfer by name.

725
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,026
It was a demotion
for illegal investigation.

726
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:53,323
The Chief of Eunseong Police Station,
Pyo Myunghak, probably had a say.

727
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:54,950
On top of that,

728
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,495
my wife passed away from a hit-and-run.

729
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,332
I'm sorry.

730
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,092
Captain.

731
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:15,262
Where did you get these photos?

732
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,847
They aren't from the forensics.

733
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,724
Go meet

734
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:21,560
the reporter who wrote this article.

735
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:25,272
He was as invested as I was
in the accident.

736
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,691
I got these photos from him.

737
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:39,202
EUNSEONG DAILY

738
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,581
There were suspicions
regarding the accident at the time,

739
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,250
but they removed the follow-up articles.

740
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,962
They said the story wasn't newsworthy.

741
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,506
I didn't understand at the time.

742
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,510
I wondered
what outside pressure was at play.

743
00:50:56,636 --> 00:51:00,098
Hold on. It occurred in 2014.

744
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,143
Here are the photos from the time.

745
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,232
All right.

746
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:15,572
Here.

747
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:17,991
DAEJEON EUNSEONG POLICE STATION

748
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,493
These are photos of the scene.

749
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,801
Did you notice anything strange
while covering the story?

750
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:41,223
The witnesses' testimonies
were suspicious.

751
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,642
Their testimonies didn't match.

752
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:46,311
They also didn't match
with the photos of the scene.

753
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,901
May we take these photos?

754
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,069
Sure.

755
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,405
By the way,

756
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,451
why are you digging up this case again?

757
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,289
Don't you know who their fathers are?

758
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,295
One is the current Commissioner General

759
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:15,298
and one is the chairman of YSC Group,
a former gangster.

760
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,553
You'd better be careful.

761
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,430
Okay. Thank you.

762
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:34,693
Hello.

763
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,445
Where are Lieutenant Min
and Inspector Cha?

764
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,826
There was a report of a staged crash,
so they went to the scene.

765
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,327
Where would that be?

766
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,163
She received the report herself,

767
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,748
so we're not so sure…

768
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:52,544
I guess the superiors take
such trivial cases in this team.

769
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,319
For goodness' sake.

770
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,947
It's Lee Taeju. Don't mind him.

771
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,702
Over here. It's a skid mark.

772
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:27,954
It was at the location of the accident.

773
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,415
I think it was from a car
on the opposite side.

774
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:33,835
Could it be the car that passed
the center line?

775
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,795
It makes sense if it was from that car.

776
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,631
And this.

777
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:42,928
The name of the tire is in the photo,
so I looked it up on the Internet.

778
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:44,930
The tread of the tire…

779
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,516
has this pattern.

780
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,229
Isn't it the same tire?

781
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,189
Like Captain said,

782
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:57,817
the car that crossed the center line was…

783
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,325
Look at this photo.

784
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:09,079
It's the tire mark
from Lee Hyunsoo's body.

785
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:20,173
I need to go back to the scene.

786
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,547
Are you okay?

787
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,090
Yes.

788
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,219
Shall we begin?

789
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,809
TRAFFIC ACCIDENT
EUNDONG JUNCTION, EUNSEONG-GU

790
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:18,231
Pyo Jungwook's car stopped
over there, across the road.

791
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,650
But according to their testimonies,

792
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:26,197
the witnesses' car should've been there,
across the road ahead of the accident.

793
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:31,786
Why was Pyo Jungwook's car
on the same side of the road?

794
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:57,979
Are you sure you're okay?

795
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:01,274
Yes.

796
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,089
Kyungsoo!

797
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:30,804
What's this?

798
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,182
Hey! Hey!

799
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,936
Hey! You bastard!

800
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:38,853
Hey!

801
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,272
What the hell!

802
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,447
You crazy bastard!

803
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,461
The witnesses were the culprits.

804
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,797
Then the tire mark on Lee Hyunsoo's body…

805
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,674
It's from Pyo Myunghak's car.

806
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:22,897
Pyo Jungwook and his friends ran over
and killed Lee Hyunsoo.

807
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:26,693
- I think the culprit knows the truth.
- Wouldn't it be Pyo Jungwook's doing?

808
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:31,239
Perhaps he got rid of Yang Jaeyoung
and Han Kyungsoo, witnesses to his crime.

809
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,658
- <i>It isn't Pyo Jungwook.</i>
- Why not?

810
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:35,618
<i>There's something I haven't told you two.</i>

811
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,079
<i>The culprit who drives the black car…</i>

812
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,207
has a crippled leg.

813
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,173
Could it be…

814
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:45,813
KIM HYUNMIN

815
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,774
Where's your son-in-law right now?

816
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,901
Mr. Kim Minsung.

817
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:04,249
Inspector Cha,
what brings you here at this hour?

818
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,126
Mr. Kim Minsung.

819
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:10,338
Perhaps,

820
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:14,050
I should call you Mr. Kim Hyunmin now.

821
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:39,033
CRASH

822
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,771
Kim Hyunmin, the forensic analyst,
is Kim Minsung.

823
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,398
<i>He's getting revenge for his late wife.</i>

824
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:13,192
Chairman Yang,
since when did you abide by the law?

825
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,361
<i>I'll avenge Jaeyoung's death.</i>

826
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,572
<i>Putting those bastards in prison</i>
<i>won't change a thing.</i>

827
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:19,198
<i>I promise I'll catch them.</i>

828
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,908
<i>Why don't you mind your own business?</i>

829
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,036
<i>Don't meddle and risk losing your team.</i>

830
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,455
<i>The world is quite unfair.</i>

831
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:28,499
<i>Bring him to me.</i>
<i>I'll carry out the last blow.</i>

832
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,335
<i>Han Kyungsoo has testified.</i>

833
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,003
The evidence is inadmissible.

834
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:33,671
<i>This is just the beginning.</i>

835
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:37,675
<i>From now on,
I'll make you pay for all your sins.</i>

836
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:43,014
PEOPLE OF THE POLICE STATION

837
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:47,769
I'm here today

838
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:53,149
because I had a feeling
that some may have heard

839
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:56,361
an unfamiliar term in today's episode.

840
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:57,528
DIRECTOR PYO JUNGWOOK

841
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:00,490
An unlicensed taxi. Not unicyclist.

842
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:03,117
Some might wonder exactly what it means.

843
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,453
If you don't know the term,

844
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:08,331
it means that you're leading
an upright life.

845
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:12,210
So you don't need to be embarrassed.

846
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:16,589
So what is an unlicensed taxi?

847
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:23,513
They're illegal taxis that usually operate

848
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:26,015
in entertainment districts
such as Gangnam.

849
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,518
Luxury foreign cars are used

850
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:32,730
to pick up and drop off customers
and entertainment business employees.

851
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:35,858
It's a mode of transportation

852
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:39,195
that's secretive and quite expensive.

853
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,992
Customers pay a hefty price
to ride illegal taxis

854
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,286
since they're secretive people

855
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:51,749
who wish to keep
their destinations and partners private.

856
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,042
But here's the problem.

857
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:56,546
Unlicensed taxis that guarantee privacy

858
01:01:56,629 --> 01:02:00,091
are used for crimes
as you saw in this episode.

859
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,759
If they become involved in crimes,

860
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,679
it's hard to track down
the cars and culprits.

861
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:07,140
Thus, they hinder investigations.

862
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:13,020
Just like burner phones and burner cars,

863
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:15,857
illegal taxis are widespread
due to low public awareness

864
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:20,027
and their difficulty to track
in a crackdown.

865
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:24,866
Thus, unlicensed taxis
are being used in various crimes.

866
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:31,998
In <i>Crash</i>, Sohee wishes to eradicate
unlicensed taxis

867
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:34,375
because of such problems.

868
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:38,254
Until now, unlicensed taxis
were not a major concern

869
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:40,840
because they were seen
as a lesser-known practice.

870
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:46,679
Let's wait for the day
they become eradicated.

871
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:50,516
Jungwook, don't use unlicensed taxis.

872
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:55,688
