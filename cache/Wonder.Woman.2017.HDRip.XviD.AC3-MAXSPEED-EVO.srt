1
00:00:45,807 --> 00:00:48,046
<i>I used to want to
save the world.</i>

2
00:00:49,947 --> 00:00:51,814
<i>This beautiful place.</i>

3
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:55,645
<i>But I knew so little then.</i>

4
00:00:57,955 --> 00:01:00,241
<i>It is a land of
magic and wonder.</i>

5
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,805
<i>Worth cherishing in every way.</i>

6
00:01:06,664 --> 00:01:08,410
<i>But the closer you get...</i>

7
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:13,204
<i>...the more you see the great
darkness shimmering within.</i>

8
00:01:17,418 --> 00:01:18,860
<i>And mankind?</i>

9
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:23,949
<i>Mankind is another
story altogether.</i>

10
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:28,841
<i>What one does when
faced with the truth..</i>

11
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:31,119
<i>is more difficult than you think.</i>

12
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:43,165
<i>I learned this the hard way.</i>

13
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:46,254
<i>A long long time ago.</i>

14
00:01:49,178 --> 00:01:50,179
<i>And now...</i>

15
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,680
<i>...I will never be the same.</i>

16
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:03,814
Yeah.. Si.

17
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:51,148
Hello, Diana.

18
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,079
<i>- Hello, Diana.
- Hello.</i>

19
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:54,975
<i>Diana!</i>

20
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:57,411
Diana!

21
00:02:58,022 --> 00:02:59,023
Come back!

22
00:03:39,163 --> 00:03:40,416
- Looks very good.
- Very good.

23
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:41,466
How is she?

24
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:42,761
She's good.

25
00:03:43,162 --> 00:03:44,270
- Keep working.
- I will.

26
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,300
Niobi.

27
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:09,824
Diana!

28
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,932
Diana, I see you.

29
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:21,424
Where are you going?
Slow down!

30
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:33,532
Hello mother.

31
00:04:34,277 --> 00:04:35,634
How are you today?

32
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,754
Let's get you back to school,
before another tutor quits.

33
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:43,341
But don't you think it's time
to start my training?

34
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:45,800
Antiope thinks I'm ready.

35
00:04:46,565 --> 00:04:47,866
Does she?

36
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,069
I could begin showing
her some things.

37
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:55,035
She should at least be
able to defend herself.

38
00:04:55,374 --> 00:04:56,375
From whom?

39
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,457
In the event of an invasion.

40
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:01,959
Isn't that why I have the greatest
warrior in our history...

41
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,462
...leading an entire army,
General?

42
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:08,627
I pray there will never come
when she has to fight.

43
00:05:08,628 --> 00:05:11,902
But you know,
a scorpion must sting...

44
00:05:11,903 --> 00:05:14,586
- A wolf must hunt.
- She is a child.

45
00:05:14,587 --> 00:05:17,175
The only child on the island.
Please let her be so.

46
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,221
But, mother...

47
00:05:18,288 --> 00:05:19,619
There will be no training.

48
00:05:27,385 --> 00:05:28,867
What if I promise to be careful?

49
00:05:30,104 --> 00:05:31,699
It's time to sleep.

50
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:35,696
What if I didn't use a sword?

51
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,598
Fighting does not
make you a hero.

52
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,523
Just the shield then,
no sharp edges.

53
00:05:42,357 --> 00:05:45,794
Diana, you are the most precious
thing in the world to me.

54
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:50,688
I wished for you so much,
so I sculpted you from clay myself.

55
00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:53,454
...and begged Zeus
to give you life.

56
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,288
You've told me this story.

57
00:05:55,985 --> 00:05:59,404
Which is why.. tonight
I'll tell you a new one.

58
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:03,216
The story of our people
and my days of battle.

59
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:04,276
Yes!

60
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,490
So you will finally understand
why war is nothing to hope for.

61
00:06:14,435 --> 00:06:17,065
<i>Long ago,
when time was new...</i>

62
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,695
<i>...and all of history
was still a dream...</i>

63
00:06:20,907 --> 00:06:23,198
<i>...the gods ruled the earth.</i>

64
00:06:23,464 --> 00:06:26,032
<i>Zeus king among them.</i>

65
00:06:28,676 --> 00:06:31,807
<i>Zeus created beings over
which the Gods would rule.</i>

66
00:06:32,402 --> 00:06:34,855
<i>Beings born in his image...</i>

67
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,717
<i>...fair and good,
strong and passionate.</i>

68
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:43,548
<i>He called his creation "Man".
And mankind was good.</i>

69
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:47,754
<i>But Zeus' son.. grew
envious of mankind...</i>

70
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:51,121
<i>...and sought to corrupt
his father's creation.</i>

71
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:55,596
<i>This was Ares,
the God of War.</i>

72
00:06:57,803 --> 00:07:01,967
<i>Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion.</i>

73
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:04,261
<i>He turned them against
one another...</i>

74
00:07:04,486 --> 00:07:07,456
<i>...and war ravaged the Earth.</i>

75
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:12,572
<i>So, the gods created
us, the Amazons...</i>

76
00:07:12,573 --> 00:07:15,221
<i>...to influence men's
hearts with love...</i>

77
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:17,920
<i>...and restore
peace to the Earth.</i>

78
00:07:20,822 --> 00:07:24,045
<i>And for a brief time,
there was peace.</i>

79
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:31,369
<i>But it did not last.</i>

80
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:41,863
<i>Your mother, The Amazon Queen,
led a revolt...</i>

81
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:44,966
<i>...that freed us all
from enslavement.</i>

82
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:55,264
<i>When Zeus led the gods
to our defence...</i>

83
00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:58,597
<i>...Ares killed
them one by one...</i>

84
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:01,953
<i>...until only Zeus
himself remained.</i>

85
00:08:03,307 --> 00:08:07,742
<i>Zeus used the last of his
power to stop Ares...</i>

86
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:10,453
<i>...striking such a blow,</i>

87
00:08:10,483 --> 00:08:13,287
<i>the god of war was
forced to retreat.</i>

88
00:08:14,645 --> 00:08:15,684
<i>But Zeus knew...</i>

89
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,023
<i>...that one day Ares might
return to finish his mission.</i>

90
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:21,959
<i>An endless war...</i>

91
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:25,548
<i>...where mankind would finally
destroy themselves...</i>

92
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:29,116
<i>...and us with them.</i>

93
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:31,818
<i>So Zeus, left us a weapon.</i>

94
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:35,117
<i>...One powerful enough
to kill a god.</i>

95
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:40,337
<i>With his dying breath,
Zeus created this island...</i>

96
00:08:40,338 --> 00:08:42,511
<i>to hide us from
the outside world...</i>

97
00:08:42,911 --> 00:08:45,134
<i>...Somewhere Ares
could not find us.</i>

98
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,915
<i>And all has been
quiet ever since.</i>

99
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:03,773
We give thanks to the gods
for giving us this paradise.

100
00:09:05,757 --> 00:09:07,201
And the God Killer?

101
00:09:11,973 --> 00:09:13,004
The God Killer?

102
00:09:13,305 --> 00:09:15,720
The weapon that is strong
enough to kill a God.

103
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:18,044
Can I see it?

104
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:30,034
The Gods gave us many gifts.

105
00:09:30,676 --> 00:09:32,235
One day,
you'll know them all.

106
00:09:32,837 --> 00:09:35,750
This great tower..
is where we keep them.

107
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:49,412
The God Killer.

108
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:54,659
It's beautiful.

109
00:09:56,406 --> 00:09:57,617
Who would wield it?

110
00:10:00,264 --> 00:10:02,771
I pray it will never
be called to arms.

111
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:06,461
But only the fiercest
among us even could.

112
00:10:06,726 --> 00:10:08,873
And that's not you, Diana.

113
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:12,076
You see?
You are safe...

114
00:10:12,594 --> 00:10:15,498
...and there is nothing you
should concern yourself with.

115
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:30,471
You keep doubting
yourself, Diana.

116
00:10:30,684 --> 00:10:32,900
- No, I don't.
- Yes. You do.

117
00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:34,556
No, I don't.

118
00:10:39,212 --> 00:10:41,071
You arestronger than you believe.

119
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:43,241
You have greater
powers than you know.

120
00:10:43,566 --> 00:10:45,551
- But if you don't try harder...
- Diana!

121
00:10:57,393 --> 00:10:58,394
Are you hurt?

122
00:10:58,709 --> 00:10:59,903
No, Mother, I'm fine.

123
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:01,797
- I was just...
- Training.

124
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,719
Seems I'm not the
revered queen I should be.

125
00:11:05,821 --> 00:11:08,239
Disobeyed, betrayed
by my own sister...

126
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,590
No, mother. It was me.
I asked her...

127
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:11,852
Take her to the palace.

128
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:15,140
Off you go.

129
00:11:23,405 --> 00:11:25,505
You left me no
choice, Hippolyta.

130
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:29,841
You neglect your duty,
if she cannot fight.

131
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,178
You speak of a time
that may never come.

132
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,284
He might never return.
He could have died from his wounds.

133
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:41,196
Ares is alive.

134
00:11:41,673 --> 00:11:44,901
You feel it as I do,
in your bones.

135
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:47,980
It is only a matter of
time before he returns.

136
00:11:51,997 --> 00:11:55,782
The stronger she gets,
the sooner he will find her.

137
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,671
Hippolyta,
I love her as you do.

138
00:12:00,246 --> 00:12:03,217
But this is the only way
to truly protect her.

139
00:12:14,288 --> 00:12:17,614
You will train her harder
than any Amazon before her.

140
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,027
Five times harder...

141
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,409
...ten times harder.

142
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,512
Until she's better
than even you.

143
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:27,915
But she must never
know the truth...

144
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,572
about what she is...

145
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,320
...or how she came to be.

146
00:13:26,775 --> 00:13:27,976
Harder.

147
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:30,134
You are stronger
than this, Diana.

148
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,176
Again.

149
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:51,005
Never let your guard down.

150
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,842
You expect the battle to be fair.

151
00:13:54,058 --> 00:13:55,604
A battle will never be fair.

152
00:14:09,623 --> 00:14:10,624
Anti­ope!

153
00:14:12,338 --> 00:14:13,539
Lay still..

154
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:15,066
You're bleeding.

155
00:14:16,044 --> 00:14:18,568
- I'm sorry...
- Wait, Diana.

156
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:26,041
What had I done?

157
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:29,315
I'm sorry.

158
00:17:00,776 --> 00:17:02,586
Where did this fog come from?

159
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:09,207
There...
Go forward.

160
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,040
<i>There he is!</i>

161
00:17:27,063 --> 00:17:28,772
<i>- The pilot! I can see him.
- He's there!</i>

162
00:18:00,491 --> 00:18:01,792
Wow.

163
00:18:04,593 --> 00:18:06,100
You are a man.

164
00:18:10,414 --> 00:18:13,317
Yeah. I mean...

165
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,007
Do I not look like one?

166
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,743
Where are we?

167
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,735
Temiscira.

168
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:25,867
What?

169
00:18:26,386 --> 00:18:27,442
Who are you?

170
00:18:35,575 --> 00:18:38,432
I'm one of the good guys
and those are the bad guys.

171
00:18:38,637 --> 00:18:39,638
What?

172
00:18:39,883 --> 00:18:40,276
The German.

173
00:18:40,306 --> 00:18:41,594
Come on,
we need to get out of here.

174
00:18:41,795 --> 00:18:43,541
- The Germans?
- Diana!

175
00:18:44,402 --> 00:18:46,307
Step away from her.. now!

176
00:18:48,687 --> 00:18:50,388
Ready your bows!

177
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:54,801
They have guns.
Right?

178
00:18:57,686 --> 00:18:58,687
Fire!

179
00:19:00,026 --> 00:19:01,027
Come on!

180
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,851
Stay down!

181
00:21:18,138 --> 00:21:19,561
Shield!

182
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:41,324
No!

183
00:21:42,178 --> 00:21:43,432
No!

184
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,201
No.

185
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:54,211
No. No.. Antiope.

186
00:21:54,371 --> 00:21:56,964
Anti­ope, hey.

187
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:01,809
Diana.

188
00:22:03,793 --> 00:22:05,495
- The time has come.
- No.

189
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:08,434
You... you must...

190
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:11,730
What?
What, Anti­ope?

191
00:22:15,693 --> 00:22:16,967
God Killer!

192
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,697
- Diana, go...
- Go where?

193
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,685
- Where?
- Go...

194
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:26,114
No, please no.
No, no!

195
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:29,500
- No!
- Anti­ope!

196
00:22:31,452 --> 00:22:32,465
No!

197
00:22:39,637 --> 00:22:41,315
- You.
- No..

198
00:22:42,691 --> 00:22:43,745
No mother no.

199
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,288
He fought at my side
against the invaders.

200
00:22:45,389 --> 00:22:47,725
What man fights against
his own people?

201
00:22:47,751 --> 00:22:48,643
These aren't my people.

202
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:50,978
Then, why do you
wear their colors?

203
00:22:53,097 --> 00:22:54,036
I can't tell you that.

204
00:22:54,061 --> 00:22:55,413
You need to tell us now!

205
00:22:55,513 --> 00:22:56,404
What's your name?

206
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,166
I can't tell you that either.

207
00:23:00,057 --> 00:23:03,014
We should kill him now
and be done with it.

208
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,341
If he dies...

209
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,891
...we know nothing about who
they are and why they came.

210
00:23:16,894 --> 00:23:17,895
My...

211
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,224
Name is Captain Steve Trevor, pilot,

212
00:23:22,254 --> 00:23:24,075
American Expeditionary Forces.

213
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,463
Serial number 8141921.

214
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:36,425
Assigned to British
Intelligence.

215
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:39,936
What the hell is this thing?

216
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:42,938
The lasso of Hestia compels
you to reveal the truth.

217
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:44,835
But it's really hot.

218
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,841
It is pointless and
painful to resist.

219
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:50,187
What is your mission?

220
00:23:50,424 --> 00:23:54,050
Whoever you are,
you are in more danger than you think.

221
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,590
What is your mission?

222
00:23:58,719 --> 00:23:59,720
I am a...

223
00:24:04,407 --> 00:24:05,419
I am a...

224
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:10,430
I'm a spy.

225
00:24:13,515 --> 00:24:15,874
I'm a spy.
I'm a spy.

226
00:24:18,588 --> 00:24:20,088
<i>British Intelligence got word...</i>

227
00:24:20,188 --> 00:24:22,883
<i>...that the leader of the
German Army Gen. Ludendorff.</i>

228
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:26,933
<i>...would be visiting a secret military
installation in the Ottoman empire.</i>

229
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:30,032
<i>I posed as one of their
pilots and flew in with them.</i>

230
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,851
<i>According to our Intel, the
Germans had no troops left...</i>

231
00:24:33,876 --> 00:24:36,696
<i>...no money, no
munitions of any kind.</i>

232
00:24:37,205 --> 00:24:38,633
<i>But our Intel was wrong.</i>

233
00:24:38,663 --> 00:24:41,460
<i>The German had the Turks
building bombs for 'em.</i>

234
00:24:41,485 --> 00:24:43,803
<i>And not just bombs, new weapons.</i>

235
00:24:43,828 --> 00:24:45,412
<i>Secret weapons.</i>

236
00:24:46,907 --> 00:24:52,155
<i>Invented by Ludendorff's chief
psychopath, Dr. Isabelle Maru.</i>

237
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:56,492
<i>The boys in the trenches
called her "Doctor Poison".</i>

238
00:24:57,332 --> 00:24:58,904
<i>And for good reason.</i>

239
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:31,495
<i>From what I could tell if Dr Maru
was able to complete her work,</i>

240
00:25:31,615 --> 00:25:34,916
<i>...millions more would die.
The war would never end.</i>

241
00:25:34,941 --> 00:25:37,078
<i>I was there to observe and
report, nothing more...</i>

242
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:40,324
<i>...but, I had
to do something.</i>

243
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:52,063
Which is.. I need more time.

244
00:25:52,088 --> 00:25:53,835
Unfortunately,
Dr. we don't have more time.

245
00:25:53,836 --> 00:25:56,325
This work, this...

246
00:26:02,021 --> 00:26:03,578
Get that man!

247
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,667
Now!

248
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:01,406
But if I can get these notes back to
the British Intelligence in time...

249
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:05,225
...it could stop
millions more from dying.

250
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:07,617
It could stop the war.

251
00:27:08,217 --> 00:27:09,913
War? What war?

252
00:27:12,185 --> 00:27:13,618
The War.

253
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,991
The war to end the all wars.

254
00:27:20,395 --> 00:27:21,900
Four years...

255
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,769
27 countries...
25 million dead.

256
00:27:27,387 --> 00:27:29,089
...Soldiers and civilians.

257
00:27:29,989 --> 00:27:31,647
Innocent people...

258
00:27:32,327 --> 00:27:34,561
...Women and
children slaughtered.

259
00:27:35,764 --> 00:27:39,148
Their homes and thier villages
looted & burned.

260
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,391
Weapons far deadlier
than you can...

261
00:27:48,939 --> 00:27:50,332
...ever imagine.

262
00:27:54,859 --> 00:27:56,806
It's like nothing
I've ever seen.

263
00:27:57,837 --> 00:27:59,944
It's like the world's gonna end.

264
00:28:01,803 --> 00:28:03,063
Should we let him go?

265
00:28:03,574 --> 00:28:06,167
And risk him bringing
more men to our shores?

266
00:28:06,192 --> 00:28:08,240
We can not hold him
forever, my queen.

267
00:28:08,265 --> 00:28:10,212
Mother, excuse me...

268
00:28:10,237 --> 00:28:14,495
...but after everything the
man said, this must be Ares.

269
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,818
What are you talking
about, child?

270
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:19,290
Forgive me, Senator, but the man
called it a war without end.

271
00:28:19,983 --> 00:28:22,038
Millions of people already dead.

272
00:28:22,748 --> 00:28:24,679
Like nothing he's ever seen.

273
00:28:24,766 --> 00:28:26,618
Only Ares could do such a thing.

274
00:28:28,826 --> 00:28:31,912
We can not simply let him go.
We must go with him.

275
00:28:32,685 --> 00:28:35,443
I will not deploy our army and
leave them scare defences...

276
00:28:35,543 --> 00:28:36,302
...to go and fight their war.

277
00:28:36,303 --> 00:28:38,222
It's not their war.

278
00:28:38,247 --> 00:28:41,476
Zeus created man to be just,
and wise, strong and passionate...

279
00:28:41,501 --> 00:28:43,892
That was a story, Diana!

280
00:28:44,017 --> 00:28:45,578
This much, you
do not understand?

281
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:46,580
Men are easily corrupted.

282
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:49,115
Yes, but Ares is behind
that corruption!

283
00:28:49,877 --> 00:28:52,927
It is Ares who has these
Germans fighting..

284
00:28:53,205 --> 00:28:56,699
And stopping the God of war
is our fore ordinance.

285
00:28:57,024 --> 00:28:59,608
As Amazons this is our duty.

286
00:28:59,681 --> 00:29:03,064
But you're not an Amazon
like the rest of us.

287
00:29:03,573 --> 00:29:05,000
So you will do nothing.

288
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:07,168
As your queen I forbid it.

289
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:21,454
Strange.

290
00:29:23,087 --> 00:29:24,975
Is it true you saved his life?

291
00:29:25,495 --> 00:29:26,682
Who told you that?

292
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,032
He did.

293
00:29:53,902 --> 00:29:55,525
Ah.. I didn't see you come in.

294
00:30:01,503 --> 00:30:04,386
Would you say you are a...

295
00:30:05,348 --> 00:30:08,047
...a typical example
of your sex?

296
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:10,568
I am...

297
00:30:13,157 --> 00:30:14,833
...above average.

298
00:30:18,709 --> 00:30:19,806
What's that?

299
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,106
It's a...

300
00:30:25,213 --> 00:30:26,214
Oh...

301
00:30:29,096 --> 00:30:30,097
It's a watch.

302
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:31,920
A watch?

303
00:30:31,971 --> 00:30:33,292
Yeah, it's a watch.

304
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,927
Tells time.

305
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:37,465
My father gave it to me.

306
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:40,659
Went through hell 'n back with him.

307
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:45,023
Now it's for me and,
good thing it's still ticking..

308
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:47,145
What for?

309
00:30:49,075 --> 00:30:50,687
Because it tells time.

310
00:30:52,081 --> 00:30:54,567
When to eat, sleep,
wake up, work...

311
00:30:56,098 --> 00:30:59,067
You let this little thing
tell you what to do?

312
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:00,833
Yeah...

313
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:08,739
Can I ask you some questions?

314
00:31:10,152 --> 00:31:11,982
- Where are we?
- Temiscira.

315
00:31:12,076 --> 00:31:15,763
No, I got that before, but I mean..
Where are we?

316
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:18,659
What is this place?
Who are you people?

317
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:20,967
Why does the water do that?

318
00:31:21,067 --> 00:31:22,328
How come you don't
know what a watch is?

319
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:23,429
How can you speak
English so well?

320
00:31:23,629 --> 00:31:25,402
We speak hundreds of languages.

321
00:31:26,123 --> 00:31:29,667
We are the bridge to a greater
understanding between all men.

322
00:31:31,898 --> 00:31:33,121
Right.

323
00:31:36,455 --> 00:31:39,302
You know,
I didn't get a chance to say this...

324
00:31:40,944 --> 00:31:44,964
...earlier, but thank you for
dragging me out of the water.

325
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:47,774
Thank you...

326
00:31:48,514 --> 00:31:50,703
...for what you
did on the beach.

327
00:31:58,679 --> 00:31:59,680
So...

328
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:02,501
...you are here to let me go?

329
00:32:03,765 --> 00:32:07,369
I tried, but it's not up to me.

330
00:32:08,082 --> 00:32:09,755
I even asked them to
send me with you..

331
00:32:12,396 --> 00:32:13,747
Or anyone.

332
00:32:14,105 --> 00:32:15,109
In Amazon..

333
00:32:15,258 --> 00:32:17,160
The Amazons.

334
00:32:17,213 --> 00:32:18,370
The Amazons?

335
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:21,271
It is our sacred duty
to defend the world.

336
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:24,153
And I wish to go..

337
00:32:26,718 --> 00:32:28,982
But my mother will not allow it.

338
00:32:31,455 --> 00:32:32,456
Well...

339
00:32:34,308 --> 00:32:35,344
I can't say I blame her.

340
00:32:36,357 --> 00:32:37,546
The way this war's going...

341
00:32:37,547 --> 00:32:40,047
...I don't wanna let
anyone I care about near.

342
00:32:40,072 --> 00:32:42,508
Then why do you want to go back?

343
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:45,155
I don't think "want"
is the word, right?

344
00:32:47,056 --> 00:32:49,510
I guess I gotta try.

345
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:54,113
My father told me
once he said...

346
00:32:54,213 --> 00:32:55,986
" If you see something wrong
happening in the world...

347
00:32:56,206 --> 00:32:58,809
"... you can either do nothing,
or you can do something."

348
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,483
And I already tried nothing.

349
00:35:41,528 --> 00:35:42,643
Nice outfit.

350
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:44,516
Oh, thank you.

351
00:35:45,433 --> 00:35:48,365
Now..
I'll show you the way off the Island...

352
00:35:49,131 --> 00:35:50,695
...and you'll take me to Ares.

353
00:35:51,795 --> 00:35:52,796
Deal.

354
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:02,979
I am leaving on that?

355
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:04,486
We are..

356
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,857
Yeah, we're leaving in that?

357
00:36:08,057 --> 00:36:09,459
Do you not know how to sail?

358
00:36:09,842 --> 00:36:10,918
Of course I know how to sail.

359
00:36:10,946 --> 00:36:12,908
Why wouldn't I know how to sail?
It's just...

360
00:36:13,826 --> 00:36:15,378
It's been a while.

361
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,975
I am going, mother.

362
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:49,972
I cannot stand by while
innocent lives are lost.

363
00:36:51,049 --> 00:36:55,361
If no one else will defend the
world from Ares, then I must.

364
00:36:56,963 --> 00:36:58,392
I have to go.

365
00:36:58,769 --> 00:36:59,891
I know.

366
00:37:01,144 --> 00:37:03,668
Or at least I know I
can not stop you.

367
00:37:09,272 --> 00:37:10,993
There is so much...

368
00:37:11,954 --> 00:37:13,070
So much you do not understand.

369
00:37:13,071 --> 00:37:14,292
I understand enough.

370
00:37:15,104 --> 00:37:18,639
But I'm willing to fight for those
who cannot fight for themselves.

371
00:37:21,459 --> 00:37:22,920
Like you once did.

372
00:37:23,422 --> 00:37:25,528
You know that if you
choose to leave...

373
00:37:27,148 --> 00:37:28,746
...you may never return.

374
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:32,518
Who will I be if I stay?

375
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:44,447
This belonged to the greatest
warrior in our history...

376
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,947
...our beloved Anti­ope.

377
00:37:47,108 --> 00:37:49,481
Make sure you're worthy of it.

378
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,641
I will.

379
00:37:55,783 --> 00:37:58,112
Be careful in the
world of men, Diana.

380
00:37:59,848 --> 00:38:02,222
They do not deserve you.

381
00:38:06,665 --> 00:38:09,609
You have been my greatest love.

382
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,054
Today...

383
00:38:16,977 --> 00:38:19,735
...you are my greatest sorrow.

384
00:38:57,853 --> 00:38:59,506
Should you have told her?

385
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:04,722
The more she knows, the
sooner he will find her.

386
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:18,080
How long until we reach the war?

387
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,415
The war, which part?

388
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:23,251
The Western Front in France is...

389
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,654
...400 miles long, from the
Alps to the North Sea.

390
00:39:26,954 --> 00:39:29,195
Where the fighting is
the most intense then.

391
00:39:29,219 --> 00:39:32,249
If you take me there, I'm
sure I'll find Ares.

392
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:38,205
Ares as in..
the God of War?

393
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,482
The God of war is our responsibility.

394
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,306
Only an Amazon can defeat him.

395
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,218
With this.

396
00:39:46,543 --> 00:39:47,973
And once I do...

397
00:39:48,312 --> 00:39:50,134
...the war will end.

398
00:39:56,945 --> 00:39:59,422
Look. I appreciate your spirit...

399
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,361
...but this war is...

400
00:40:01,415 --> 00:40:04,373
It's a great big mess.

401
00:40:04,997 --> 00:40:07,772
And there's not a whole lot
you and I can do about that.

402
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,640
I mean, we can get back to London
and try to look for men who can.

403
00:40:10,734 --> 00:40:12,719
I'm the man who can!

404
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,939
Once I find and destroy Ares...

405
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:17,816
...the German armies will be
freed from his influence...

406
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,402
...they will good men again
and the world will be better.

407
00:40:25,032 --> 00:40:26,033
Great.

408
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:27,770
You will see.

409
00:40:31,356 --> 00:40:32,157
What are you doing?

410
00:40:33,617 --> 00:40:35,301
I thought maybe you wanna...

411
00:40:36,355 --> 00:40:37,505
...get some sleep.

412
00:40:40,498 --> 00:40:43,376
What about you?
Are you not sleeping?

413
00:40:43,643 --> 00:40:45,469
Does the average men not sleep?

414
00:40:49,693 --> 00:40:52,516
Yes, we sleep. We just
don't sleep with a...

415
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:53,803
You don't sleep with women?

416
00:40:54,129 --> 00:40:56,866
No, I mean, I do, I sleep with...
I sleep with...

417
00:40:58,303 --> 00:40:59,659
Yes, I do..

418
00:40:59,684 --> 00:41:01,296
But out of the...

419
00:41:02,295 --> 00:41:05,410
...confines of marriage.

420
00:41:08,994 --> 00:41:10,969
Not polite to assume,
you know?

421
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:16,317
"Marriage"?

422
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:18,202
Weird! You don't have that...

423
00:41:19,529 --> 00:41:20,851
You go before a judge...

424
00:41:21,176 --> 00:41:25,658
...and you swear to love, honor
and cherish each other...

425
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:26,860
...Until death do you apart.

426
00:41:27,461 --> 00:41:29,682
And do they.. love
each other till death?

427
00:41:29,964 --> 00:41:31,799
Not very often, no.

428
00:41:31,824 --> 00:41:33,251
Then why do they do it?

429
00:41:33,276 --> 00:41:35,857
I have no idea.

430
00:41:37,438 --> 00:41:39,684
So you cannot sleep
with me unless I marry you..

431
00:41:39,884 --> 00:41:41,511
I will sleep with you if you want.
I'll sleep right there.

432
00:41:41,536 --> 00:41:42,611
There is plenty of room.

433
00:41:42,937 --> 00:41:45,203
- Then fine, if you don't mind...
- No, it's up to you.

434
00:41:45,231 --> 00:41:48,038
- I'm just fine.
- Coming to sleep with you.

435
00:41:48,127 --> 00:41:49,248
Okay.

436
00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:15,453
You know, where I come from,
I'm not considered average.

437
00:42:16,268 --> 00:42:18,809
You know, um..
being a spy...

438
00:42:19,107 --> 00:42:22,182
You have to show a
certain amount of...

439
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,031
...vigor.

440
00:42:28,369 --> 00:42:31,698
Have you never met a man before?
What about your father?

441
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,547
I have no father.

442
00:42:34,266 --> 00:42:35,842
My mother sculpted
me from clay...

443
00:42:36,067 --> 00:42:38,258
...and I was brought
to life by Zeus.

444
00:42:41,387 --> 00:42:42,682
Well that's neat.

445
00:42:46,394 --> 00:42:47,395
Sorry.

446
00:42:50,281 --> 00:42:51,887
Where I come from..

447
00:42:53,325 --> 00:42:55,501
...babies are made differently.

448
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:58,398
You refer to
reproductive biology.

449
00:42:58,423 --> 00:43:00,116
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah, I know.

450
00:43:00,985 --> 00:43:02,429
I know all about that.

451
00:43:02,685 --> 00:43:05,516
I mean I refer to that
and other things.

452
00:43:06,447 --> 00:43:07,745
The pleasures of the flesh.

453
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:12,198
Do you know about that?

454
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:17,486
I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's
criticism on earthly pleasures

455
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:20,551
12 huh?

456
00:43:25,659 --> 00:43:27,188
Did you bring any
of those with you?

457
00:43:27,703 --> 00:43:28,958
You would not enjoy them.

458
00:43:28,959 --> 00:43:30,393
I don't know.
May be.

459
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:31,614
No you wouldn't.

460
00:43:31,879 --> 00:43:32,880
Why not?

461
00:43:33,421 --> 00:43:36,520
They came to the conclusion that
man are essential for procreation...

462
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,545
...but when it comes
to pleasure...

463
00:43:39,738 --> 00:43:40,743
...Unnecessary.

464
00:43:40,913 --> 00:43:41,914
No.

465
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:48,225
Goodnight.

466
00:44:02,344 --> 00:44:03,744
How long until we're operational?

467
00:44:04,045 --> 00:44:05,366
Two days, sir.

468
00:44:05,367 --> 00:44:07,249
We'll have it up
tonight, Captain.

469
00:44:07,484 --> 00:44:11,594
Sir, the men have had
no food, no sleep.

470
00:44:11,595 --> 00:44:13,756
Do you think I have had a
neat food or rest, captain?

471
00:44:14,368 --> 00:44:16,235
Do you hear me making excuses?

472
00:44:16,335 --> 00:44:16,991
No.

473
00:44:17,191 --> 00:44:18,934
Your men, they are
weak, complacent.

474
00:44:19,134 --> 00:44:21,579
You've let them forget for an
attack can happen at any time.

475
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:23,112
...from any cover!

476
00:44:23,383 --> 00:44:24,664
So let's you & I remind them...

477
00:44:25,051 --> 00:44:25,852
...Shall we?

478
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:42,306
- Doctor.
- General.

479
00:44:42,536 --> 00:44:43,537
Progress?

480
00:44:43,659 --> 00:44:44,966
Not enough.

481
00:44:45,778 --> 00:44:47,609
It is over, General.

482
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:49,694
Germany is giving up.

483
00:44:49,885 --> 00:44:53,788
Von Hindenburg has recommended
the Kaiser sign the armistice.

484
00:44:54,111 --> 00:44:56,078
We have run out of time.

485
00:44:57,721 --> 00:45:00,433
As soon as the Kaiser sees
the newest weapon...

486
00:45:00,682 --> 00:45:02,405
...he will not
sign the armistice.

487
00:45:02,406 --> 00:45:03,593
But without my notebook...

488
00:45:03,808 --> 00:45:05,178
We will get your book!

489
00:45:05,179 --> 00:45:07,690
It is you that I believe in,
not it.

490
00:45:09,114 --> 00:45:12,170
I know what you can
and will succeed...

491
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:17,247
It is what you're put
on this earth to do.

492
00:45:20,894 --> 00:45:24,228
Something, did come
to me last night.

493
00:45:24,729 --> 00:45:26,453
A different type of gas.

494
00:45:27,684 --> 00:45:28,588
For you.

495
00:45:29,095 --> 00:45:31,039
To restore your strength.

496
00:46:01,152 --> 00:46:03,815
I have got it!
I have got it!

497
00:46:04,104 --> 00:46:07,068
And if it's what I think...

498
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,235
It's going to be...

499
00:46:11,777 --> 00:46:13,252
...terrible.

500
00:46:34,745 --> 00:46:35,819
Morning!

501
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:38,909
We got lucky. We caught a
ride, we make some good time.

502
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:41,595
Welcome to Jolly old London!

503
00:46:41,881 --> 00:46:43,523
It's hideous..

504
00:46:43,732 --> 00:46:45,536
Yeah, it's not for everybody.

505
00:47:07,543 --> 00:47:09,160
- Good morning Darling.
- What a babe.

506
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:10,414
Oh no!

507
00:47:10,435 --> 00:47:12,904
Gentlemen, eyes to yourself.
Thank you so much.

508
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,729
Come on!

509
00:47:18,313 --> 00:47:19,846
Why are they holding hands?

510
00:47:20,786 --> 00:47:22,969
Probably because
they're together.

511
00:47:25,769 --> 00:47:28,355
No... No.. We're not together,
I mean, in that way.

512
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,641
This way.

513
00:47:29,741 --> 00:47:30,742
To the war!

514
00:47:30,983 --> 00:47:32,396
Well, technically,
the war is that way.

515
00:47:32,426 --> 00:47:33,585
But we gotta get this way first.

516
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:35,086
And where are we going?

517
00:47:35,407 --> 00:47:37,078
We gotta get this
notebook to my superiors.

518
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:38,399
Hey! Hey..!

519
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,571
No. I let you go.
You take me to Ares.

520
00:47:41,837 --> 00:47:43,569
- We made a deal, Steve Trevor.
- Yeah.

521
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,032
And a deal is a promise.

522
00:47:45,274 --> 00:47:47,174
And a promise is unbreakable.

523
00:47:48,211 --> 00:47:50,129
Oi, damn it, alright.

524
00:47:51,227 --> 00:47:52,912
Come with me first
to deliver this...

525
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:54,769
...and then we'll
give you a ticket...

526
00:47:55,786 --> 00:47:56,787
...to the war.

527
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:58,071
Deal?

528
00:47:59,636 --> 00:48:00,705
- Let's go.
- Diana...

529
00:48:00,914 --> 00:48:01,730
What are you doing?

530
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:04,171
You can not do that because
you're not wearing any clothes.

531
00:48:04,196 --> 00:48:07,407
Let's go... Let's go
buy some clothes.

532
00:48:07,695 --> 00:48:09,612
What do these women
wear into battle?

533
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:10,989
They don't...

534
00:48:11,598 --> 00:48:12,852
A baby!

535
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,348
No, no.. No babies.

536
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,231
One's not made out of clay.

537
00:48:19,545 --> 00:48:20,595
Come on.

538
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,824
Diana! Please.

539
00:48:38,246 --> 00:48:39,479
Thank God! You're not dead!

540
00:48:42,215 --> 00:48:43,783
Hurray!

541
00:48:43,784 --> 00:48:46,117
I did think you're dead till
I got your call, you know?

542
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:49,059
He's been gone for weeks..
Not a single word.

543
00:48:49,382 --> 00:48:50,383
Very unlike him.

544
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:52,839
I am introducing myself.
It's Etta Candy.

545
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,857
I am Steve Trevor's secretary.

546
00:48:55,144 --> 00:48:56,342
What is a secretary?

547
00:48:56,996 --> 00:48:57,997
Well, I do everything.

548
00:48:58,249 --> 00:49:00,651
I go where he tells me to go and
I do what he tells me to do.

549
00:49:00,809 --> 00:49:03,151
Well, where I am from,
that's called slavery.

550
00:49:03,472 --> 00:49:04,424
I really like her.

551
00:49:04,449 --> 00:49:06,011
Fantastic.
Ladies after you.

552
00:49:06,012 --> 00:49:07,181
Oh.. I do, I like her.

553
00:49:15,844 --> 00:49:19,865
Is this what passes for
armor in your country?

554
00:49:20,616 --> 00:49:22,497
Ah. well, "Oh my".
It's fashion.

555
00:49:22,724 --> 00:49:24,130
Keeps our tummies in..

556
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:25,833
Why must you keep them in?

557
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:28,291
Any woman with a tummy
would ask that question!

558
00:49:30,085 --> 00:49:33,505
Conservative, but
not entirely unfun.

559
00:49:34,729 --> 00:49:36,054
Try it on at least.

560
00:49:36,414 --> 00:49:37,432
Very well..

561
00:49:38,821 --> 00:49:39,822
No!

562
00:49:47,198 --> 00:49:48,199
Come on!

563
00:49:57,472 --> 00:50:00,134
How can a woman
possibly fight in this?

564
00:50:00,513 --> 00:50:01,523
Fight?

565
00:50:01,524 --> 00:50:03,132
We use our principles.

566
00:50:03,409 --> 00:50:05,036
I mean that's how we are
gonna get to vote.

567
00:50:05,306 --> 00:50:08,917
Although I am not opposed to
engaging in a bitter fist stickups..

568
00:50:09,118 --> 00:50:10,842
...should the occasion arise.

569
00:50:12,297 --> 00:50:13,502
Lovely.

570
00:50:15,247 --> 00:50:17,466
It's itching.
It's choking me.

571
00:50:18,941 --> 00:50:20,818
Can they blame it?

572
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,353
Etta.

573
00:50:22,883 --> 00:50:23,631
Where is she?

574
00:50:23,857 --> 00:50:26,115
She's trying on upto number 226.

575
00:50:35,801 --> 00:50:39,028
Ms. Candy, the whole point
was to make her look less

576
00:50:39,251 --> 00:50:40,268
...distracting.

577
00:50:42,686 --> 00:50:43,797
May I?

578
00:50:48,322 --> 00:50:49,636
Yeah, really? Specs?

579
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:52,012
Certainly she's not the most
beautiful woman you've ever seen?

580
00:50:58,757 --> 00:50:59,951
Better.

581
00:51:11,157 --> 00:51:12,372
Yep, that's not gonna work.

582
00:51:12,651 --> 00:51:14,299
Please put the
sword down, Diana.

583
00:51:14,551 --> 00:51:15,552
Diana!

584
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:17,774
Let me try it by myself.

585
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,080
After you, sir.

586
00:51:28,626 --> 00:51:29,656
Etta...

587
00:51:30,124 --> 00:51:32,348
Why don't I meet you
back at the office?

588
00:51:32,598 --> 00:51:34,419
And meanwhile, I'll take
this for safekeeping.

589
00:51:34,698 --> 00:51:35,699
Oh no, I don't think so.

590
00:51:35,735 --> 00:51:37,529
You gotta put the sword down,
Diana. Please.

591
00:51:37,765 --> 00:51:39,537
- It doesn't go with the outfit.
- At all.

592
00:51:39,538 --> 00:51:41,824
Put the sword down,
first of all.

593
00:51:44,414 --> 00:51:47,820
Promise me you'll protect
it with your life.

594
00:51:48,553 --> 00:51:50,226
Yes... no.

595
00:51:50,496 --> 00:51:52,419
You can trust her.
Just hand that over.

596
00:51:52,804 --> 00:51:54,596
- Shield.
- And the shield to her..

597
00:51:56,028 --> 00:51:57,060
You got it? Thanks, Etta.

598
00:51:57,085 --> 00:51:58,302
This is easy.

599
00:52:00,633 --> 00:52:01,634
There we go.

600
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:30,647
What is it?

601
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:34,722
Hopefully, nothing.
Come on.

602
00:52:44,447 --> 00:52:46,489
- Steve, why are we hiding?
- Shh! Come on, come on!

603
00:52:56,288 --> 00:52:57,722
Captain Trevor.

604
00:52:58,647 --> 00:53:01,635
I believe you have something that
is the property of Gen. Ludendorff.

605
00:53:03,396 --> 00:53:05,869
Ah, it's the bad guy convention.

606
00:53:06,648 --> 00:53:08,226
Give us Dr Maru's note book.

607
00:53:09,056 --> 00:53:10,456
Where I put that thing?

608
00:53:12,632 --> 00:53:13,433
Stand back!

609
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:25,619
Or maybe not.

610
00:53:41,705 --> 00:53:42,706
Oh, tough luck.

611
00:53:49,488 --> 00:53:51,534
Is there anything else
you wanna show me?

612
00:53:52,538 --> 00:53:54,225
Where do you think you're going?

613
00:54:00,967 --> 00:54:03,458
I'm sorry, but you're clearly
under Ares' control.

614
00:54:04,053 --> 00:54:06,366
- Diana.
- Let me help you get free.

615
00:54:06,636 --> 00:54:08,066
Where will I find Ares?

616
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:17,279
He's... He's dead.

617
00:54:18,574 --> 00:54:19,733
Cyanide.

618
00:54:28,689 --> 00:54:30,336
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

619
00:54:30,578 --> 00:54:33,211
<i>Come on! Gentlemen, please!</i>

620
00:54:38,694 --> 00:54:40,039
<i>Let him speak!</i>

621
00:54:40,139 --> 00:54:41,397
Yes thank you, gentlemen...

622
00:54:42,051 --> 00:54:46,046
<i>Germany is an immensely
proud nation.</i>

623
00:54:47,303 --> 00:54:49,204
<i>They will never surrender.</i>

624
00:54:49,575 --> 00:54:52,231
<i>Now look.
The only way to end this war...</i>

625
00:54:52,232 --> 00:54:54,867
Colonel, I need to
talk to you outside.

626
00:54:54,967 --> 00:54:57,553
<i>...and restore world peace...</i>

627
00:54:58,185 --> 00:54:59,827
<i>is to negotiate...</i>

628
00:55:01,634 --> 00:55:03,217
...an armistice.

629
00:55:03,923 --> 00:55:05,423
<i>There's a woman.</i>

630
00:55:06,413 --> 00:55:07,877
What is she doing here?
Get her out..

631
00:55:09,842 --> 00:55:11,083
Ger her out..

632
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:12,727
Sorry.

633
00:55:12,775 --> 00:55:15,230
Blind sister,
she got lost on the way to her bathroom..

634
00:55:15,231 --> 00:55:17,409
I think it's this way.
Sorry guys.

635
00:55:18,136 --> 00:55:20,091
<i>Our only aim at this time...</i>

636
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:22,936
<i>...must be to achieve peace...</i>

637
00:55:22,937 --> 00:55:24,940
<i>...at any cost!</i>

638
00:55:28,548 --> 00:55:30,846
Why you been not hearing speech?
He is talking of peace.

639
00:55:30,847 --> 00:55:32,458
Not right now!

640
00:55:37,453 --> 00:55:40,043
Trevor, what the hell were you thinking
bringing a woman into the counsel?

641
00:55:40,044 --> 00:55:42,056
The Intel that I brought
back is time sensitive.

642
00:55:42,349 --> 00:55:44,274
This is one of Dr.
Maru's notebooks.

643
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:45,010
Notebook or notes...

644
00:55:45,061 --> 00:55:45,938
We need to get it
to Cryptography.

645
00:55:45,939 --> 00:55:47,717
And I need a immediate
audience with the generals.

646
00:55:47,718 --> 00:55:49,800
You do not just barge in here.

647
00:55:49,834 --> 00:55:51,568
Sir with all due respect..
What I saw in my last trip...

648
00:55:51,569 --> 00:55:52,705
...will change the
course of war.

649
00:55:52,706 --> 00:55:54,296
Captain Trevor!

650
00:55:56,418 --> 00:55:58,144
I heard we lost you in
one of your mission...

651
00:55:58,145 --> 00:55:59,576
...and yet here you are,
back from the dead...

652
00:55:59,577 --> 00:56:01,527
...and I see you
brought a friend with you.

653
00:56:01,556 --> 00:56:03,318
My deepest apology for
interruption sir.

654
00:56:03,456 --> 00:56:04,987
No, no no... non sense.

655
00:56:05,189 --> 00:56:06,955
Thanks to this young woman...

656
00:56:07,257 --> 00:56:10,606
...the room was finally quiet enough
for me to get atleast a few words in.

657
00:56:10,857 --> 00:56:12,908
Sir Patrick Morgan,
at your service.

658
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:14,882
Diana, princess of the...

659
00:56:15,124 --> 00:56:16,864
"Prince". Diana Prince.

660
00:56:17,732 --> 00:56:18,780
She is...

661
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:20,031
and I..

662
00:56:20,197 --> 00:56:21,198
...are...

663
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,361
...working together.

664
00:56:22,891 --> 00:56:24,973
She actually helped me bring
this notebook back here.

665
00:56:25,116 --> 00:56:26,778
That's from Dr Maru's lab.

666
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:30,070
I think the information it contains
inside will change the course of the war.

667
00:56:30,385 --> 00:56:32,095
My.. God.

668
00:56:33,135 --> 00:56:35,042
- Dr Poison herself.
- Yes.

669
00:57:05,437 --> 00:57:06,438
Yes.

670
00:57:07,045 --> 00:57:08,246
Intriguing.

671
00:57:08,505 --> 00:57:09,868
Any further intelligence?

672
00:57:10,114 --> 00:57:12,877
Sadly not, sir.
Cryptography had no luck.

673
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:15,036
It seems like it's a mixture
of two languages...

674
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:18,830
...but as if they failed to
determine which two languages.

675
00:57:19,175 --> 00:57:20,704
Ottoman & Sumerian.

676
00:57:23,038 --> 00:57:25,384
Surely someone else in
this room knew that.

677
00:57:25,664 --> 00:57:26,695
Who is this woman?

678
00:57:26,964 --> 00:57:28,646
She is my...

679
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,481
...secretary, sir.

680
00:57:30,982 --> 00:57:33,214
And she can understand
Ottoman and Sumerian?

681
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,089
She's a very good secretary.

682
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:40,068
Sir, if this woman
can read it...

683
00:57:40,299 --> 00:57:42,125
...we should hear
what she has to say.

684
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,022
Yes, very well.

685
00:57:50,207 --> 00:57:51,851
It's a formula...

686
00:57:52,333 --> 00:57:54,831
...for a new kind of gas.

687
00:57:54,856 --> 00:57:57,589
Mustard gas, hydrogen
based instead of sulfur.

688
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:58,999
<i>Hydrogen based...</i>

689
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,811
Gas masks would be useless
against hydrogen.

690
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,822
The book says, they plan
to release the gas...

691
00:58:05,042 --> 00:58:06,499
At the front?

692
00:58:06,712 --> 00:58:07,511
When?

693
00:58:07,606 --> 00:58:08,879
It doesn't say.

694
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:10,837
Wait. In "front" of what?

695
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:11,955
Sir...

696
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:13,611
...that is the
evidence we need.

697
00:58:13,612 --> 00:58:15,438
You have to find out where
they are making that gas.

698
00:58:15,439 --> 00:58:16,815
You have to burn
it to the ground.

699
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,036
Destroy it.

700
00:58:18,112 --> 00:58:20,519
Ludendorff was last
seen in Belgium.

701
00:58:20,802 --> 00:58:24,902
We can't be seen in sending troops
into German-occupied Belgium...

702
00:58:25,203 --> 00:58:28,360
...As we are negotiating
their surrender.

703
00:58:28,385 --> 00:58:30,264
Sir, I have seen that
gas with my own eyes.

704
00:58:30,297 --> 00:58:33,157
If it is used, it will kill
everyone on both sides.

705
00:58:33,182 --> 00:58:34,028
They will all die.

706
00:58:34,275 --> 00:58:37,218
Yes, that's what
soldiers do, Captain.

707
00:58:37,783 --> 00:58:39,987
Send me in.. with some
logistical support.

708
00:58:40,037 --> 00:58:43,001
At least give me the chance to take
out Ludendorff's operation myself.

709
00:58:43,025 --> 00:58:44,127
Are you insane?

710
00:58:44,628 --> 00:58:46,587
I can't introduce rogue
elements this late in the case.

711
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,524
Sir, I can take...

712
00:58:47,764 --> 00:58:49,008
Now more than ever...

713
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:52,951
...the armistice is
off paramount importance.

714
00:58:53,153 --> 00:58:56,800
It must be negotiated
it must be signed..

715
00:58:57,586 --> 00:59:00,285
It's the best way
of stopping the war.

716
00:59:00,501 --> 00:59:02,400
Captain, you will do nothing.

717
00:59:02,663 --> 00:59:04,718
And that's an order.

718
00:59:05,607 --> 00:59:06,608
Yes sir.

719
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:08,962
I understand, sir.

720
00:59:09,767 --> 00:59:10,792
I don't!

721
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,561
Diana, I know this confusing...

722
00:59:12,642 --> 00:59:14,101
It is not confusing!
It's unthinkable!

723
00:59:14,131 --> 00:59:14,975
Who is this woman?

724
00:59:14,976 --> 00:59:16,092
She is with me, she is with us.

725
00:59:16,093 --> 00:59:17,097
I'm not.. I am not with you!

726
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:20,336
You would knowingly
sacrifice all those lives.

727
00:59:20,337 --> 00:59:21,800
...as if they mean
less than yours.

728
00:59:21,825 --> 00:59:23,912
- Diana, let's talk about it outside.
- As if they mean nothing?

729
00:59:23,913 --> 00:59:26,947
Where I come from, generals don't
hide in their offices like cowards.

730
00:59:26,948 --> 00:59:29,194
That's enough! They fight
alongside their soldiers.

731
00:59:29,195 --> 00:59:31,023
They die with them
on the battlefield!

732
00:59:31,024 --> 00:59:32,748
- That's enough! My apologies.
- You should be ashamed.

733
00:59:32,749 --> 00:59:33,821
- My apologies.
- You should be ashamed.

734
00:59:34,122 --> 00:59:35,895
- Diana... Diana!
- All of you should be ashamed!

735
00:59:37,569 --> 00:59:39,018
Please slow down!

736
00:59:39,236 --> 00:59:40,427
Is that your leader?

737
00:59:40,764 --> 00:59:42,810
How could he say that?
Believe that?

738
00:59:43,128 --> 00:59:44,466
And.. and you!

739
00:59:44,696 --> 00:59:46,956
Was your duty to simply
give them a book?

740
00:59:46,986 --> 00:59:47,317
No!

741
00:59:47,509 --> 00:59:49,138
You didn't stand your ground.
You didn't fight.

742
00:59:49,139 --> 00:59:50,811
Because there was no chance
of changing anything.

743
00:59:50,812 --> 00:59:54,199
This is Ares and
he's not going to allow negotiation,

744
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:55,549
...nor a surrender!

745
00:59:55,574 --> 00:59:58,276
The millions of people you
talked about, they will die.

746
00:59:58,301 --> 00:59:59,661
We are going anyway!

747
01:00:02,008 --> 01:00:03,866
You mean you were lying?

748
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,966
I'm a spy!
That's what I do!

749
01:00:06,066 --> 01:00:08,184
How do I know you're not
lying to me right now?

750
01:00:13,187 --> 01:00:14,743
I'm taking you to the front.

751
01:00:15,051 --> 01:00:17,138
We are afraid you're gonna die.

752
01:00:18,217 --> 01:00:20,165
This is a terrible idea.

753
01:00:24,856 --> 01:00:26,603
We're gonna need reinforcements.

754
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:39,377
These are the reinforcements?

755
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:40,403
Yep.

756
01:00:40,535 --> 01:00:42,493
Are these even good men?

757
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:44,704
Well, relatively.

758
01:00:45,852 --> 01:00:49,894
Even in Africa gentlemen,
we haven't seen such luxuries.

759
01:00:49,919 --> 01:00:52,132
The luxury that we have now is like...

760
01:00:52,162 --> 01:00:54,200
is like we can't stop making money!

761
01:00:54,225 --> 01:00:56,588
So my uncle, the
Prince, and I...

762
01:00:57,149 --> 01:00:58,580
Which prince is that?

763
01:00:59,206 --> 01:01:01,348
I decided to extend
your profanity...

764
01:01:01,349 --> 01:01:02,971
But seriously, which prince?

765
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:06,440
Hey, Sultan, Angoora,
Next Kashmir...

766
01:01:06,589 --> 01:01:08,390
<i>...Care to talk for a minute?</i>

767
01:01:08,962 --> 01:01:11,094
Gentlemen, excuse me one second.

768
01:01:12,192 --> 01:01:13,763
- A bar... Well, a pub.
- You hypocrite.

769
01:01:13,963 --> 01:01:17,102
I've been racing those peacocks
all night, and you've...

770
01:01:17,515 --> 01:01:19,215
Oh my goodness, gracious.

771
01:01:20,205 --> 01:01:21,038
That's a work of art.

772
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:23,317
Sameer, Diana.
Diana, Sameer!

773
01:01:23,342 --> 01:01:25,595
Hi, Diana. You can
call me Sammy please.

774
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:26,429
"Sammy".

775
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:28,970
Oh Sameer, I wouldn't...
do that if I were you.

776
01:01:29,013 --> 01:01:30,319
Sameer is a top undercover man.

777
01:01:30,344 --> 01:01:32,989
He can talk the skin off a cabbage
many ways as you can.

778
01:01:33,304 --> 01:01:35,998
<i>He doesn't look that impressive to me.</i>

779
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:37,651
<i>You do for me.</i>

780
01:01:38,015 --> 01:01:40,936
<i>Your eyes, as soft as your smile.</i>

781
01:01:41,162 --> 01:01:42,113
<i>And your eyes...</i>

782
01:01:42,138 --> 01:01:45,016
<i>...looks like they want something.</i>

783
01:01:45,454 --> 01:01:47,374
<i>I know Chinese too, tricky girl.</i>

784
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:49,658
<i>But, can you recite Socrates
in ancient Greek?</i>

785
01:01:52,019 --> 01:01:53,022
Oh, you're done.

786
01:01:53,047 --> 01:01:54,048
Where is Charlie?

787
01:01:58,176 --> 01:01:59,177
Voila!

788
01:02:01,906 --> 01:02:04,315
At least this Charlie
is good with his fists.

789
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:06,716
That's not Charlie.

790
01:02:14,699 --> 01:02:15,800
That's Charlie.

791
01:02:20,238 --> 01:02:21,239
Steven!

792
01:02:21,288 --> 01:02:24,229
May god grow a flower
upon your head son.

793
01:02:24,329 --> 01:02:25,373
Good to see you.

794
01:02:26,939 --> 01:02:28,842
So what were you fighting about?

795
01:02:30,085 --> 01:02:32,576
I mistook his glass for mine.
That happens.

796
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,311
This man is no fighter.

797
01:02:34,524 --> 01:02:36,533
Charlie is an expert marksman.

798
01:02:37,103 --> 01:02:38,415
Means he shoots people.

799
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,005
From very far away.

800
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:41,600
You never know what hit 'em.

801
01:02:43,287 --> 01:02:45,830
So, how do you know who you kill
if you can't see their face?

802
01:02:46,031 --> 01:02:48,193
I don't. Trust me
it's better that way.

803
01:02:48,342 --> 01:02:49,791
You fight without honor.

804
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:51,948
Who gets paid for honor?

805
01:02:53,323 --> 01:02:54,715
So, what's the job, boss?

806
01:02:56,213 --> 01:02:57,229
Two days tops.

807
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:59,852
We need supplies and
passage to Belgium.

808
01:02:59,952 --> 01:03:01,184
What's the going rate?

809
01:03:01,284 --> 01:03:01,997
Better be a good pay.

810
01:03:01,998 --> 01:03:04,209
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

811
01:03:06,354 --> 01:03:07,324
..I told you it was going to be quick.

812
01:03:08,608 --> 01:03:11,019
And there's a lot to
be gained by this.

813
01:03:11,294 --> 01:03:13,218
It's for a great cause...

814
01:03:14,517 --> 01:03:15,518
...Freedom.

815
01:03:16,052 --> 01:03:17,460
Friendship...

816
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:21,226
...ending the war, friendship...

817
01:03:21,227 --> 01:03:22,583
- Okay, You have no money.
- No.

818
01:03:22,884 --> 01:03:25,861
<i>All I want now is a picture
of that beautiful face.</i>

819
01:03:27,031 --> 01:03:28,841
<i>You will not need a photo...</i>

820
01:03:29,226 --> 01:03:30,176
<i>...because I'll go with you.</i>

821
01:03:31,247 --> 01:03:32,248
What?

822
01:03:32,303 --> 01:03:33,373
What is this?

823
01:03:33,401 --> 01:03:34,734
We're gonna drop her up at front!

824
01:03:35,025 --> 01:03:36,627
- "Dropping her off"?
- Yeah.

825
01:03:37,325 --> 01:03:39,384
Question sweetheart, I am not
gonna get myself killed...

826
01:03:39,485 --> 01:03:40,785
...with helping every last human.

827
01:03:40,831 --> 01:03:43,431
- That's no I mean.
- Here's the little thief now!

828
01:03:57,180 --> 01:04:00,329
I am both frightened and aroused.

829
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:08,502
Oh here they are! Sorry I'm late.
Sir Patrick!

830
01:04:08,527 --> 01:04:10,146
Yes, that's what I
was gonna mention.

831
01:04:11,523 --> 01:04:13,182
- Sir Patrick.
- No... No..!

832
01:04:13,627 --> 01:04:15,661
Gentlemen, sit.
Ms. Prince, sit..

833
01:04:20,498 --> 01:04:22,411
I assume you are here
planning something...

834
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:25,458
...that's going to get you
either court martial or killed.

835
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:27,699
And I assume,
you are here to stop us.

836
01:04:28,249 --> 01:04:29,250
No.

837
01:04:29,729 --> 01:04:31,541
Not at all in fact..

838
01:04:32,365 --> 01:04:33,307
Well, look.

839
01:04:33,332 --> 01:04:34,499
I was an younger man once.

840
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,201
And had I been in better health,

841
01:04:36,231 --> 01:04:38,410
I like to think that
I might do the same.

842
01:04:39,497 --> 01:04:41,944
It's very very honorable
thing you're doing.

843
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:42,671
Therefore..

844
01:04:43,722 --> 01:04:45,023
...I am here to help.

845
01:04:45,621 --> 01:04:46,997
Unofficially, of course.

846
01:04:48,138 --> 01:04:49,366
What's your plan?

847
01:04:50,897 --> 01:04:54,002
If there's another weapon's
facility, find it and destroy it.

848
01:04:54,471 --> 01:04:56,279
Along with Ludendorff and Maru.

849
01:04:57,368 --> 01:04:59,952
In that case, to
allay suspicion...

850
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:05,299
...our charming Etta could run
the mission from my office.

851
01:05:05,653 --> 01:05:06,654
"Run"...

852
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:09,799
Also.

853
01:05:10,834 --> 01:05:13,292
...There is enough
here for a few days.

854
01:05:18,936 --> 01:05:19,937
Thank you sir.

855
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:21,413
You're very welcome.

856
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:24,039
Take great care all of you...

857
01:05:24,064 --> 01:05:25,065
...and good luck.

858
01:05:46,373 --> 01:05:48,275
<i>Fresh ice-cream.</i>

859
01:05:48,376 --> 01:05:50,280
Hello miss, would you like
to buy an ice cream?

860
01:05:50,401 --> 01:05:51,820
- Me?
- You hungry?

861
01:05:52,072 --> 01:05:53,073
Yes.

862
01:05:53,514 --> 01:05:54,252
Thank you.

863
01:05:54,277 --> 01:05:55,718
Eight pence please, sir.

864
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,182
There you go, and keep the change.

865
01:05:57,183 --> 01:05:58,725
Thank you very much sir.

866
01:05:59,876 --> 01:06:01,378
- What you doing?
- It's wonderful!

867
01:06:01,403 --> 01:06:02,555
Yeah.

868
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:06,182
- You should be very proud.
- Thank you very much!

869
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,584
You should be very proud.

870
01:06:18,064 --> 01:06:19,181
I hope I got niches here.

871
01:06:19,211 --> 01:06:20,865
The chief's expecting
us before dark.

872
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:23,118
Chief?

873
01:06:24,143 --> 01:06:25,724
Oh yeah.
A smuggler.

874
01:06:26,561 --> 01:06:27,918
Very reputable.

875
01:06:28,347 --> 01:06:31,324
A liar, a murderer,
and now a smuggler.

876
01:06:31,928 --> 01:06:32,929
Lovely.

877
01:06:33,399 --> 01:06:34,600
Careful, I might get offended.

878
01:06:34,624 --> 01:06:36,126
I wasn't referring to you.

879
01:06:36,977 --> 01:06:37,978
Really?

880
01:06:37,991 --> 01:06:40,240
I wanna recover from pretending
to be somebody else.

881
01:06:40,365 --> 01:06:42,314
...I shot people on your
beach, smuggle a notebook.

882
01:06:42,315 --> 01:06:44,920
A liar, murderer and smuggler.
You still coming?

883
01:07:04,473 --> 01:07:05,474
It's awful.

884
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:08,257
That's why we're here.

885
01:07:26,396 --> 01:07:28,132
The gas will kill everything.

886
01:07:28,457 --> 01:07:30,581
What kind weapons
kills innocents?

887
01:07:31,509 --> 01:07:33,002
In this war...

888
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,271
...Every kind.

889
01:07:40,317 --> 01:07:42,634
You were absent at the
counsel meeting, General.

890
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:45,516
I see you are negotiating the
terms of the armistice without me.

891
01:07:45,541 --> 01:07:48,045
- On the Kaiser's behalf.
- I'm on your insistence.

892
01:07:48,925 --> 01:07:51,928
We could easily win this war if
only you had a little faith.

893
01:07:51,953 --> 01:07:53,184
We don't.

894
01:07:53,509 --> 01:07:55,539
There are shortages of food...

895
01:07:55,564 --> 01:07:57,409
...meds and ammunition.

896
01:07:58,416 --> 01:08:02,300
Every hour we delay costs
thousands of German lives.

897
01:08:02,425 --> 01:08:05,157
One attack and the
world could be ours.

898
01:08:07,518 --> 01:08:09,549
As we speak, my chemistry...

899
01:08:09,574 --> 01:08:11,721
We stand against you and your...

900
01:08:11,746 --> 01:08:12,985
...witch.

901
01:08:13,721 --> 01:08:18,900
Ludendorff, enough!
24 hours from now...

902
01:08:18,925 --> 01:08:20,897
...this war will end.

903
01:08:21,445 --> 01:08:23,081
It is over.

904
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:25,698
It's over for you.

905
01:08:29,602 --> 01:08:30,911
It is over for all of you..

906
01:08:47,547 --> 01:08:49,538
But the mask won't help.

907
01:08:49,563 --> 01:08:50,806
They don't know that.

908
01:09:05,758 --> 01:09:07,018
Let's go.

909
01:09:07,043 --> 01:09:09,695
Time to stage a demonstration
for the Kaiser!

910
01:09:12,369 --> 01:09:12,901
You're late.

911
01:09:13,202 --> 01:09:14,328
Cowboy sneak attack, chief!

912
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:16,672
How are you?

913
01:09:17,587 --> 01:09:19,583
- Good to see you pal.
- Big mike.

914
01:09:22,096 --> 01:09:23,824
- Good to see you.
- Oh yes!

915
01:09:24,717 --> 01:09:26,218
Good to see you my friend.

916
01:09:26,985 --> 01:09:28,205
Yaa beauty!

917
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:30,000
Who is this?

918
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:38,556
And I am Diana.

919
01:09:39,947 --> 01:09:40,997
Where did you find her?

920
01:09:41,161 --> 01:09:42,425
She found me.

921
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:45,018
- I plucked him from the sea.
- Well. It's a long story.

922
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:46,631
You don't have to talk
about that right now.

923
01:09:46,632 --> 01:09:48,033
What's there?

924
01:09:49,422 --> 01:09:51,324
British tea from the Germans...

925
01:09:51,579 --> 01:09:53,540
...German beer for the British.

926
01:09:53,565 --> 01:09:57,630
And Edgar Rice Brurroughs
novels for both.

927
01:09:57,841 --> 01:09:59,142
And guns!

928
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:03,911
Well...
May we get what we want?

929
01:10:03,936 --> 01:10:05,144
May we get what we need.

930
01:10:05,538 --> 01:10:07,539
But may we never get
what we deserve.

931
01:10:07,564 --> 01:10:08,565
Bang!

932
01:10:16,189 --> 01:10:17,413
Strange thunder.

933
01:10:18,928 --> 01:10:20,435
German 77's.

934
01:10:20,784 --> 01:10:22,206
Guns, big ones.

935
01:10:23,321 --> 01:10:24,767
It's the front out there.

936
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:29,995
- The evening hay.
- So, who do you fight for in this war?

937
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:31,289
I don't fight.

938
01:10:31,314 --> 01:10:33,179
You're here for profits then?

939
01:10:33,664 --> 01:10:35,625
No better place to be.

940
01:10:36,615 --> 01:10:39,097
Nowhere better to be than in a
war where you don't take a side.

941
01:10:39,516 --> 01:10:41,673
I have no where else.
The last war took

942
01:10:41,698 --> 01:10:44,338
everything from my people.
We have nothing left.

943
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:46,403
At least here...

944
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:48,189
...I'm free.

945
01:10:49,008 --> 01:10:50,773
Who took that from your people?

946
01:10:51,535 --> 01:10:52,716
His people.

947
01:10:57,673 --> 01:10:58,721
<i>Don't go...</i>

948
01:10:59,592 --> 01:11:02,371
<i>Don't go there.
Do not go!</i>

949
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:05,729
<i>Don't go in there.</i>

950
01:11:05,754 --> 01:11:06,852
You are safe.

951
01:11:07,053 --> 01:11:09,683
You are safe.
Are you okay?

952
01:11:09,927 --> 01:11:11,252
Shut up, you woman!

953
01:11:11,277 --> 01:11:13,030
Stop making a fuss!

954
01:11:13,353 --> 01:11:14,512
God!

955
01:11:18,597 --> 01:11:20,972
He sees ghosts.

956
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:26,998
Hey, you're gonna get cold.

957
01:11:27,023 --> 01:11:28,245
Oh I do...

958
01:11:28,724 --> 01:11:31,175
Don't worry about Charlie.
He doesn't mean any, alright?

959
01:11:51,335 --> 01:11:53,354
These animals, why are
they hurting them?

960
01:11:53,901 --> 01:11:55,497
Because they need to move quick!

961
01:11:55,745 --> 01:11:57,942
- Like us!
- But this is not the way.

962
01:11:58,142 --> 01:11:59,577
I could help them.

963
01:11:59,578 --> 01:12:00,881
There is no time.
Come on, woman!

964
01:12:04,309 --> 01:12:05,311
Mama!

965
01:12:10,073 --> 01:12:12,194
That man... he's wounded.

966
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:14,652
There is nothing you can
do about it, Diana.

967
01:12:14,922 --> 01:12:16,234
We must keep moving.

968
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:38,362
What is this?

969
01:12:38,576 --> 01:12:40,469
You wanted me to take you to war.
This is it.

970
01:12:40,536 --> 01:12:41,966
Then where are the Germans?

971
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:44,474
Couple of 100 yards
across the field.

972
01:12:44,738 --> 01:12:46,161
- The trench is...
- Watch out!

973
01:12:48,819 --> 01:12:50,848
Chief! Oh it's good to see you.

974
01:12:51,148 --> 01:12:53,313
Oi, chief's back! Chief's back!

975
01:12:54,498 --> 01:12:55,781
Alright, let's move.

976
01:12:57,014 --> 01:12:58,755
<i>Help me please.</i>

977
01:12:59,048 --> 01:13:00,920
<i>They have taken everything...</i>

978
01:13:00,921 --> 01:13:02,927
<i>...houses, food...</i>

979
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:05,007
<i>...and those who
could not escape...</i>

980
01:13:05,224 --> 01:13:07,123
<i>...they were taken
away as slaves.</i>

981
01:13:07,124 --> 01:13:08,366
<i>Where did that happen?</i>

982
01:13:08,367 --> 01:13:11,647
<i>In Veld... On the other
side of No Man's Land.</i>

983
01:13:11,648 --> 01:13:12,745
Diana, we have to go.

984
01:13:12,746 --> 01:13:14,183
We need to help these people.

985
01:13:14,208 --> 01:13:15,355
We have to stay on mission!

986
01:13:15,356 --> 01:13:17,037
Next safe crossing is
at least a day away.

987
01:13:17,251 --> 01:13:18,174
What are we waiting for?

988
01:13:18,204 --> 01:13:19,819
We can not leave
without helping them.

989
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:21,354
These people are dying.

990
01:13:21,603 --> 01:13:23,230
Nothing to eat and
in the village...

991
01:13:23,443 --> 01:13:24,885
- enslaved it there!
- I understand that.

992
01:13:24,886 --> 01:13:25,887
Women and children!

993
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:27,187
We need to make our next
position by sunset.

994
01:13:27,188 --> 01:13:29,228
How can you say that? What
is the matter with you?

995
01:13:29,891 --> 01:13:31,851
This is No Man's Land! Diana!

996
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:34,375
Means no man can
cross it, alright?

997
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:36,799
This battalion has been
here for nearly a year...

998
01:13:37,124 --> 01:13:39,382
...and they barely
gained an inch.

999
01:13:39,596 --> 01:13:42,295
Alright? Because on the other side,
there are a bunch of Germans

1000
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,122
...pointing machine guns at
every square inch of this place.

1001
01:13:45,373 --> 01:13:47,621
This is not something you can cross.
This is not possible.

1002
01:13:47,622 --> 01:13:49,014
So what? So we do nothing?

1003
01:13:49,231 --> 01:13:51,105
No, we are doing something.

1004
01:13:51,106 --> 01:13:52,485
- We are, we just...
- Steve.

1005
01:13:52,732 --> 01:13:54,121
We can't save
everyone in this war.

1006
01:13:54,348 --> 01:13:55,580
Steve...

1007
01:13:55,813 --> 01:13:57,470
This is not what we
came here to do.

1008
01:14:13,919 --> 01:14:14,920
No...

1009
01:14:14,972 --> 01:14:16,872
...but it's what
I'm going to do.

1010
01:14:32,146 --> 01:14:33,405
Diana!

1011
01:14:55,592 --> 01:14:57,883
What the bloody hell she's playing at?

1012
01:15:03,548 --> 01:15:05,548
<i>Engage, fire!</i>

1013
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:16,576
She's taking all the fire!
Let's go!

1014
01:15:20,263 --> 01:15:22,152
Sniper! stay down!

1015
01:15:22,153 --> 01:15:23,700
Stay down! That's an order!

1016
01:16:16,887 --> 01:16:17,888
Come on!

1017
01:16:18,045 --> 01:16:19,792
She's done it!
Let's go!

1018
01:16:39,815 --> 01:16:40,816
Steve!

1019
01:16:41,247 --> 01:16:42,394
Let's go!

1020
01:16:45,141 --> 01:16:46,898
Come on, go!

1021
01:17:07,296 --> 01:17:08,907
Stay here, I'll go ahead.

1022
01:17:44,446 --> 01:17:45,723
- What the...
- Let's move.

1023
01:18:24,108 --> 01:18:25,535
We need more firepower.

1024
01:19:42,031 --> 01:19:43,032
Sniper!

1025
01:19:43,096 --> 01:19:44,309
Move!

1026
01:19:46,645 --> 01:19:47,410
Get in!

1027
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:49,118
Charlie, bell tower.

1028
01:19:57,374 --> 01:19:58,644
Come on, Charlie. Shoot him.

1029
01:20:00,218 --> 01:20:01,757
It's okay.

1030
01:20:06,735 --> 01:20:08,737
Follow me.
Give me some cover.

1031
01:20:15,445 --> 01:20:16,499
Good!

1032
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:19,579
We're gonna put this on our
back and when I say go..

1033
01:20:19,604 --> 01:20:20,765
- ...Lift hard!
- All right.

1034
01:20:21,836 --> 01:20:23,949
Diana! Shield!

1035
01:20:27,646 --> 01:20:28,647
Go!

1036
01:21:30,845 --> 01:21:33,224
Stay very very still,
for me my friends.

1037
01:21:33,249 --> 01:21:34,887
Please. It's so important.

1038
01:21:38,857 --> 01:21:40,027
Thank you very much.

1039
01:21:40,052 --> 01:21:42,921
This has been such an honor
for me taking you photograph.

1040
01:21:42,946 --> 01:21:44,012
Thank you so much.

1041
01:21:50,448 --> 01:21:52,667
For obvious talk of shooting...

1042
01:21:52,988 --> 01:21:54,759
...you cannot shoot.

1043
01:21:57,406 --> 01:21:59,824
Not everyone gets to be where
they want to be all the time.

1044
01:22:00,489 --> 01:22:02,871
Me, I'm an actor.

1045
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:04,333
I love acting.

1046
01:22:04,599 --> 01:22:06,216
I didn't want to be a soldier.

1047
01:22:07,525 --> 01:22:08,866
But I'm the wrong color.

1048
01:22:09,879 --> 01:22:12,168
Everyone's fighting their
own battle, Diana.

1049
01:22:13,824 --> 01:22:15,129
Just as you're fighting yours.

1050
01:22:20,881 --> 01:22:22,785
<i>Oh it's too much. I wish you...</i>

1051
01:22:22,786 --> 01:22:23,787
<i>Thank you.</i>

1052
01:22:27,902 --> 01:22:29,479
Hi.. I'm on the phone...

1053
01:22:29,897 --> 01:22:32,969
Ah, it's "Veld", V-E-L-D.

1054
01:22:32,994 --> 01:22:34,701
It's a tiny village.

1055
01:22:34,726 --> 01:22:36,582
It may not even be on the map.

1056
01:22:36,607 --> 01:22:37,898
Ooh! I found it!

1057
01:22:38,152 --> 01:22:40,012
Did you find
Ludendorff's operation?

1058
01:22:40,037 --> 01:22:41,751
No. No, but I located him.

1059
01:22:41,917 --> 01:22:44,788
And oh, lucky you, he's
only a few miles away...

1060
01:22:44,813 --> 01:22:46,529
...At German High Command.

1061
01:22:46,986 --> 01:22:48,529
The German High Command?

1062
01:22:48,652 --> 01:22:50,006
And to Intel report...

1063
01:22:50,277 --> 01:22:52,498
...Ludendorff is
hosting a gala..

1064
01:22:52,714 --> 01:22:54,032
Sort of a last hara...

1065
01:22:54,357 --> 01:22:56,859
...before the Germans
sign the armistice.

1066
01:22:56,884 --> 01:22:59,739
And then the Kaiser himself
is going to be there.

1067
01:22:59,966 --> 01:23:02,392
As well as Dr. Maru.

1068
01:23:03,143 --> 01:23:04,790
Actually the Gala could
be perfect cover.

1069
01:23:04,815 --> 01:23:06,777
- Captain Trevor.
- Yes sir.

1070
01:23:06,802 --> 01:23:10,006
You're under no circumstances
to go anywhere near that...

1071
01:23:10,031 --> 01:23:11,568
...gala tomorrow night.
Do you hear me?

1072
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:14,135
You'll be jeopardizing
everything we've worked for.

1073
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,978
You can not compromise
the armistice.

1074
01:23:16,443 --> 01:23:17,914
- Sir, there will be no armistice...
- Steve!

1075
01:23:17,915 --> 01:23:19,908
.. once Ludendorff bombs
the entire front line.

1076
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:21,216
Hold on one second, sir.

1077
01:23:21,241 --> 01:23:23,526
We shouldn't be bothered about
setting the peace agreement.

1078
01:23:23,527 --> 01:23:25,203
- Why not?
- Ares would never let...

1079
01:23:25,804 --> 01:23:26,805
What?

1080
01:23:27,331 --> 01:23:28,332
What is that?

1081
01:23:28,591 --> 01:23:30,704
Of course, it makes
complete sense.

1082
01:23:32,294 --> 01:23:35,380
Ares developed a weapon,
the worst ever devised.

1083
01:23:35,405 --> 01:23:37,082
- Ares? You mean Ludendorff.
- No.

1084
01:23:37,647 --> 01:23:39,041
I mean Ares.

1085
01:23:39,687 --> 01:23:41,845
Ludendorff is Ares!

1086
01:23:42,735 --> 01:23:44,777
Sir, this is our last chance...

1087
01:23:44,802 --> 01:23:46,552
...our final chance to find
out where the gas is...

1088
01:23:46,553 --> 01:23:48,878
...and to learn how Ludendorff
plans on delivering it.

1089
01:23:48,903 --> 01:23:50,780
No... No.. No. I forbid it.

1090
01:23:50,805 --> 01:23:51,955
Do you hear me? I forbid it.

1091
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:53,706
Sir, I am losing you! Sir?

1092
01:23:53,731 --> 01:23:55,161
- Hello?
- Sir...

1093
01:23:58,464 --> 01:24:00,141
How likely is he to
respect my wishes?

1094
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:02,450
Not very like convinced.

1095
01:24:08,078 --> 01:24:09,880
Sammy, Sammy, no, no.

1096
01:24:10,358 --> 01:24:11,472
Sammy, I have to work.

1097
01:24:11,879 --> 01:24:13,610
I gotta rustle up
with a German uniform

1098
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,282
I took to plough
the course tomorrow.

1099
01:24:15,382 --> 01:24:16,580
That's easy, boss.
Come on.

1100
01:24:16,829 --> 01:24:18,371
There's nothing we can
do till tomorrow.

1101
01:24:18,372 --> 01:24:19,413
You said yourself, Steve.

1102
01:24:25,332 --> 01:24:26,696
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1103
01:24:44,938 --> 01:24:46,129
You did this.

1104
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:49,444
We did.

1105
01:24:54,198 --> 01:24:55,790
Do you have dancing on...

1106
01:24:56,839 --> 01:24:58,054
...Paradise Island?

1107
01:24:58,079 --> 01:24:59,800
Oh, dancing, yeah of course.

1108
01:25:00,781 --> 01:25:03,940
These people are just...
swaying.

1109
01:25:04,937 --> 01:25:08,291
Okay, if you're gonna be
fighting the God of war...

1110
01:25:08,292 --> 01:25:11,712
...I might as well teach you how
to dance, you poor thing.

1111
01:25:11,767 --> 01:25:14,330
Alright, probably
without the gun.

1112
01:25:18,457 --> 01:25:19,908
If you would...

1113
01:25:20,758 --> 01:25:21,759
Well...

1114
01:25:23,608 --> 01:25:26,292
If I'm going to the Gala, I'll
need to know how to dance.

1115
01:25:26,317 --> 01:25:27,452
- You aren't going to the Gala.
- Of course I am.

1116
01:25:27,453 --> 01:25:29,504
- No.
- Why wouldn't I?

1117
01:25:29,711 --> 01:25:31,614
Well, for one, you don't
know how to dance.

1118
01:25:32,244 --> 01:25:34,595
I would argue with this, they
don't know how to dance.

1119
01:25:34,844 --> 01:25:36,023
Be polite. Be polite.

1120
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:41,209
All right.
Give me your hand.

1121
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:42,483
Like so.

1122
01:25:43,154 --> 01:25:46,375
And I'll put my arm...

1123
01:25:46,376 --> 01:25:48,240
...around you like so.

1124
01:25:49,168 --> 01:25:51,052
And we just..

1125
01:25:51,391 --> 01:25:52,794
What do you call it? Sway?

1126
01:25:52,819 --> 01:25:53,820
We'll just sway.

1127
01:25:54,509 --> 01:25:56,078
You're awfully close.

1128
01:25:58,312 --> 01:26:00,365
Nice ritz.

1129
01:26:03,331 --> 01:26:04,573
I see.

1130
01:26:13,338 --> 01:26:15,520
I haven't heard him
sing in years.

1131
01:26:32,857 --> 01:26:34,811
It's started to snowfall.

1132
01:26:39,146 --> 01:26:40,233
Touch it.

1133
01:26:43,706 --> 01:26:45,210
It's magical!

1134
01:26:45,775 --> 01:26:47,407
It is, isn't it?

1135
01:26:49,596 --> 01:26:50,911
Yes, yeah.

1136
01:26:57,570 --> 01:27:00,976
Is this what people do when
there are no wars to fight?

1137
01:27:01,947 --> 01:27:02,948
Yeah.

1138
01:27:03,986 --> 01:27:06,989
Yeah, this... and other things.

1139
01:27:07,231 --> 01:27:08,662
What things?

1140
01:27:16,172 --> 01:27:17,715
They have breakfast.

1141
01:27:18,336 --> 01:27:19,925
They really love a breakfast.

1142
01:27:19,953 --> 01:27:22,788
And they love to wake up...

1143
01:27:23,759 --> 01:27:25,932
...read the paper
and go to work.

1144
01:27:27,011 --> 01:27:28,629
They get married.

1145
01:27:29,425 --> 01:27:31,118
Makes some babies and
grow old together.

1146
01:27:31,629 --> 01:27:32,662
I guess.

1147
01:27:36,654 --> 01:27:38,205
What is that like?

1148
01:27:42,335 --> 01:27:43,769
I have no idea.

1149
01:29:18,876 --> 01:29:20,208
The villagers gave them to us.

1150
01:29:21,008 --> 01:29:23,596
- A gracious gift.
- And they call us heroes.

1151
01:29:24,173 --> 01:29:25,174
You are.

1152
01:29:25,839 --> 01:29:27,536
Hey, fellas, I know that...

1153
01:29:28,834 --> 01:29:30,725
...I said this job
was 2 day's...

1154
01:29:32,767 --> 01:29:33,968
...and a deal is a deal.

1155
01:29:36,115 --> 01:29:37,573
You can't last without us.

1156
01:29:38,461 --> 01:29:39,462
Yeah.

1157
01:29:39,676 --> 01:29:41,838
We all know Diana is capable
of taking care of herself.

1158
01:29:42,399 --> 01:29:44,172
I'm worried that
you won't make it.

1159
01:29:44,877 --> 01:29:45,702
No more money.

1160
01:29:45,727 --> 01:29:47,119
We have been paid enough.

1161
01:29:50,993 --> 01:29:52,497
No, Charlie.

1162
01:29:53,875 --> 01:29:55,832
Who will sing for us?

1163
01:29:56,830 --> 01:29:58,839
- Yeah.
- Oh no, please.

1164
01:29:59,879 --> 01:30:00,945
Sing?

1165
01:30:02,334 --> 01:30:03,335
You asked for it.

1166
01:30:03,516 --> 01:30:05,860
<i>The reeds are green.</i>

1167
01:30:06,337 --> 01:30:09,961
<i>The reeds are green.</i>

1168
01:30:10,224 --> 01:30:13,751
<i>The sweetest hours I could live.</i>

1169
01:30:14,766 --> 01:30:16,987
You must think I was
born yesterday.

1170
01:30:17,204 --> 01:30:18,911
I know it sounds
crazy, but it's true.

1171
01:30:19,176 --> 01:30:20,267
Every word.

1172
01:30:20,757 --> 01:30:22,021
Wait...wait.

1173
01:30:22,022 --> 01:30:24,160
There is a whole island
of women like her?

1174
01:30:24,362 --> 01:30:25,966
And not a single man among them?

1175
01:30:27,437 --> 01:30:28,307
How do we get there?

1176
01:30:29,587 --> 01:30:30,508
And she thinks..

1177
01:30:30,509 --> 01:30:32,661
...that Ludendorff is
Ares, the god of war?

1178
01:30:32,692 --> 01:30:34,479
And only by killing
him will the war end.

1179
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:37,832
Don't be daft.
You saw what happened out there.

1180
01:30:38,026 --> 01:30:39,929
The way she dropped
that machine gun next.

1181
01:30:40,250 --> 01:30:42,025
The way she took out the tower?

1182
01:30:43,784 --> 01:30:45,183
May be it's true.

1183
01:30:46,321 --> 01:30:47,573
I think it's true.

1184
01:30:48,195 --> 01:30:49,209
I believe it's true.

1185
01:30:50,294 --> 01:30:53,898
Steven son, you don't really
believe those rubbish thing?

1186
01:31:17,225 --> 01:31:19,349
Diana, Diana, hide in..

1187
01:31:21,715 --> 01:31:23,540
How the hell do
we get into that?

1188
01:31:24,099 --> 01:31:26,757
I see only a couple of guards
in the door to distract.

1189
01:31:27,012 --> 01:31:28,338
Yeah, it won't look
suspicious...

1190
01:31:28,539 --> 01:31:30,104
...when I wanna come
sauntering out of the woods.

1191
01:31:30,105 --> 01:31:30,896
I could get in.

1192
01:31:31,072 --> 01:31:33,082
You are not going in
there, it's too dangerous.

1193
01:31:33,107 --> 01:31:34,589
- Too dangerous?
- Yes, too dangerous.

1194
01:31:34,603 --> 01:31:35,873
And you are too distracting.

1195
01:31:36,098 --> 01:31:38,150
Look, I will go in there, follow them to..

1196
01:31:38,151 --> 01:31:40,879
...where ever they are working on the gas or
better yet, where it is.

1197
01:31:41,094 --> 01:31:43,296
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you are not coming with me.

1198
01:31:43,353 --> 01:31:45,285
What you're wearing isn't
exactly undercover.

1199
01:31:45,811 --> 01:31:46,401
I don't know.

1200
01:31:46,402 --> 01:31:49,201
I would say she was pretty undercover
on that battlefield.

1201
01:31:49,226 --> 01:31:52,734
It's just gonna, we can't get you there.
It's all scouted out, we'll put back...

1202
01:31:52,759 --> 01:31:54,561
But as long as he's still
alive, it doesn't...

1203
01:31:54,570 --> 01:31:56,957
You cannot go into German high command
and kill anyone.

1204
01:31:57,502 --> 01:31:59,311
You just can't.
You have to trust me.

1205
01:32:00,678 --> 01:32:02,235
- Oh, Wow!
- Where did that come from?

1206
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:04,585
Oh, can I drive it?
Please let me drive it!

1207
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:05,781
Yes, I'll be your chauffeur.

1208
01:32:05,883 --> 01:32:07,127
Come on... come on.

1209
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:08,606
Stay put!

1210
01:32:10,552 --> 01:32:11,427
Where this come from?

1211
01:32:11,627 --> 01:32:13,108
A field over there.
It is full of them!

1212
01:32:17,623 --> 01:32:19,043
Chief, I think you and
me scope out the area...

1213
01:32:19,044 --> 01:32:20,913
...in case we need to
beat the haste and retreat.

1214
01:32:20,914 --> 01:32:22,490
- What do you say, Diana?
- Huh?

1215
01:32:27,815 --> 01:32:28,816
Colonel.

1216
01:32:33,003 --> 01:32:35,518
Steve, they have invitations.

1217
01:32:37,069 --> 01:32:39,347
Don't worry. Play it cool,
you go this, you got this.

1218
01:32:43,450 --> 01:32:45,072
Your invitation, please.

1219
01:32:45,097 --> 01:32:47,283
<i>Thank you sir.
The Colonel and I wish...</i>

1220
01:32:47,308 --> 01:32:49,655
...many blessings and all my
love to fall up in your head.

1221
01:32:49,906 --> 01:32:53,415
Your head must be empty.
Find the invitation, you idiot.

1222
01:32:53,715 --> 01:32:54,316
I am sorry.

1223
01:32:54,454 --> 01:32:57,056
I am so sorry, I must apologize
a thousand times, my master.

1224
01:32:58,072 --> 01:33:01,039
I made the most horrible,
the most unforgivable mistake.

1225
01:33:01,331 --> 01:33:03,357
- I lost the Colonel's invitation.
- What?

1226
01:33:03,658 --> 01:33:06,270
You saying we travelled all the way
through the mud and rain...

1227
01:33:06,563 --> 01:33:09,759
- ...Only for you to loose my invitation?
- No, I am a bug.

1228
01:33:09,784 --> 01:33:11,930
Not even a bug, I'm
a dung of a bug.

1229
01:33:11,955 --> 01:33:13,175
And you're right master...

1230
01:33:13,615 --> 01:33:14,972
Blessing will up on us.

1231
01:33:25,515 --> 01:33:26,873
This is ridiculous.

1232
01:33:27,107 --> 01:33:29,123
I'm not gonna be spending
my evening out here.

1233
01:33:29,211 --> 01:33:31,628
You stupid idiots!
Move your car!

1234
01:33:52,829 --> 01:33:54,716
What are you supposed to be?

1235
01:33:58,013 --> 01:33:59,887
What are you doing?

1236
01:34:24,577 --> 01:34:25,597
Excuse me.

1237
01:34:28,143 --> 01:34:29,839
I don't drink.

1238
01:34:37,966 --> 01:34:38,991
Have we met?

1239
01:34:39,016 --> 01:34:40,776
No, but I have
been watching you.

1240
01:34:42,169 --> 01:34:43,518
Following your career.

1241
01:34:44,615 --> 01:34:47,131
You are Dr. Isabel Maru.

1242
01:34:47,156 --> 01:34:49,698
The most talented chemist
in the German army.

1243
01:34:50,214 --> 01:34:51,634
I am a friend.

1244
01:35:02,708 --> 01:35:04,786
I hope I'm not causing any...

1245
01:35:06,521 --> 01:35:08,785
I know you and General
Ludendorff are...

1246
01:35:08,811 --> 01:35:09,776
...very close.

1247
01:35:09,801 --> 01:35:13,321
We work well together..
Yes.

1248
01:35:13,899 --> 01:35:16,888
Tell me some one like
me behind you...

1249
01:35:17,644 --> 01:35:19,545
I could provide a lot more.

1250
01:35:19,570 --> 01:35:21,338
And who are you?

1251
01:35:21,544 --> 01:35:25,628
A man who shows you appreciation
a genius like yourself deserves.

1252
01:35:32,318 --> 01:35:34,889
I love fire. Don't you?

1253
01:35:37,281 --> 01:35:38,927
It is like...

1254
01:35:40,581 --> 01:35:42,683
...a living act of entropy.

1255
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:45,323
The ultimate weapon
of destruction.

1256
01:35:46,008 --> 01:35:48,234
Reminding us that in the end...

1257
01:35:48,906 --> 01:35:52,072
...everything eventually
returns to the ash it came from.

1258
01:35:54,578 --> 01:35:57,842
There is something reassuring about it.

1259
01:36:02,443 --> 01:36:04,556
I see all of that in your eyes.

1260
01:36:08,032 --> 01:36:10,244
Perhaps you could show me
what you're working on.

1261
01:36:26,279 --> 01:36:27,897
I hear it is...

1262
01:36:30,175 --> 01:36:32,180
I hear it is extraordinary.

1263
01:36:33,145 --> 01:36:36,769
I appreciate your
interest in my work...

1264
01:36:36,794 --> 01:36:39,150
...but I'm loyal to
General Ludendorff.

1265
01:36:39,937 --> 01:36:40,958
Besides...

1266
01:36:40,983 --> 01:36:43,623
...Now I see your
attention is...

1267
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:48,101
...elsewhere.

1268
01:37:12,216 --> 01:37:14,137
Enjoying the party?

1269
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:18,964
I confess I'm not sure what
it is we're celebrating.

1270
01:37:18,989 --> 01:37:21,885
A German victory, of course.

1271
01:37:22,186 --> 01:37:22,893
Victory?

1272
01:37:22,914 --> 01:37:25,615
When I hear peace
could be so close.

1273
01:37:25,810 --> 01:37:26,919
Peace?

1274
01:37:26,937 --> 01:37:28,806
It's only an armistice...

1275
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:30,613
...and an endless war.

1276
01:37:31,281 --> 01:37:32,736
Thucydides.

1277
01:37:33,143 --> 01:37:34,782
You know your ancient Greeks?

1278
01:37:35,046 --> 01:37:36,790
They understood...

1279
01:37:36,811 --> 01:37:38,254
...that war was a god.

1280
01:37:38,795 --> 01:37:41,475
A god that requires human sacrifices.

1281
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:42,740
And in exchange...

1282
01:37:42,765 --> 01:37:45,505
...war gives man purpose...

1283
01:37:45,530 --> 01:37:47,477
...meaning, a
chance to rise...

1284
01:37:47,502 --> 01:37:49,880
...above his petty,
mortal little self...

1285
01:37:50,615 --> 01:37:51,930
...and be courageous...

1286
01:37:52,753 --> 01:37:54,144
...Noble!

1287
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:58,595
Only one of the many
gods believed in that.

1288
01:37:59,592 --> 01:38:01,178
And he was wrong.

1289
01:38:02,475 --> 01:38:03,860
You know nothing of the gods.

1290
01:38:03,885 --> 01:38:05,392
<i>Herr General.</i>

1291
01:38:08,522 --> 01:38:10,076
Enjoy the fireworks.

1292
01:38:15,689 --> 01:38:16,750
What are you doing?

1293
01:38:16,775 --> 01:38:18,216
- Out of my way!
- Diana, look at me.

1294
01:38:18,346 --> 01:38:20,183
If you kill Ludendorff
before we find the gas...

1295
01:38:20,184 --> 01:38:21,595
...we won't be able to stop anything.

1296
01:38:21,596 --> 01:38:22,775
I will stop Ares!

1297
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,333
What if you're wrong?

1298
01:38:25,903 --> 01:38:27,505
What if there's no Ares?

1299
01:38:29,268 --> 01:38:30,719
You don't believe me.

1300
01:38:30,821 --> 01:38:32,556
I can not let you do this.

1301
01:38:33,218 --> 01:38:34,676
What I do is not up to you.

1302
01:38:41,482 --> 01:38:42,635
Diana!

1303
01:38:46,910 --> 01:38:47,911
Diana...

1304
01:38:48,412 --> 01:38:49,413
The gas.

1305
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:52,428
The villagers!

1306
01:38:54,598 --> 01:38:56,230
What they cheering for?

1307
01:38:58,778 --> 01:38:59,857
Diana!

1308
01:39:02,248 --> 01:39:03,856
What did they fire?

1309
01:39:04,169 --> 01:39:05,170
The gas.

1310
01:39:05,201 --> 01:39:07,241
- It was Ludendorff.
- I saw him, he was in the tower.

1311
01:39:07,242 --> 01:39:08,711
Wherever he goes you follow.

1312
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:10,945
How will you find us?

1313
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:12,865
I know how.

1314
01:40:30,674 --> 01:40:32,022
Diana!

1315
01:40:35,017 --> 01:40:37,679
They are dead.
They are all dead.

1316
01:40:38,595 --> 01:40:40,246
I could have saved them.

1317
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:42,919
I could have saved them
if it weren't for you.

1318
01:40:43,161 --> 01:40:45,137
You stopped me
from killing Ares!

1319
01:40:45,338 --> 01:40:47,726
- No!
- Get away from me!

1320
01:40:47,921 --> 01:40:49,418
I understand everything now.

1321
01:40:49,443 --> 01:40:51,229
It isn't just the Germans
that Ares has corrupted.

1322
01:40:51,230 --> 01:40:52,547
It's you too.

1323
01:40:53,233 --> 01:40:54,260
All of you.

1324
01:40:55,455 --> 01:40:56,761
I'll find Ares...

1325
01:40:56,982 --> 01:40:58,546
...and I'll kill him.

1326
01:41:01,867 --> 01:41:03,002
Diana!

1327
01:41:04,045 --> 01:41:05,153
That smoke...

1328
01:41:06,290 --> 01:41:07,292
...it's the chief!

1329
01:41:07,313 --> 01:41:08,760
He followed Ludendorff.

1330
01:41:10,251 --> 01:41:11,834
Follow the smoke!

1331
01:41:38,150 --> 01:41:39,849
Hey! Diana, Over there!

1332
01:41:56,265 --> 01:41:57,466
Come on. Let's go!

1333
01:42:19,546 --> 01:42:21,156
Ooh! what a surprise.

1334
01:42:21,782 --> 01:42:23,074
Strange.

1335
01:42:24,453 --> 01:42:26,558
Unfortunately, I have
another matter...

1336
01:42:27,616 --> 01:42:28,617
...to attend to.

1337
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:36,285
What are you?

1338
01:42:36,286 --> 01:42:37,525
You will soon find out.

1339
01:43:11,730 --> 01:43:15,847
As magnificent as you are, you
are still no match for me.

1340
01:43:19,698 --> 01:43:21,681
We'll see about that.

1341
01:43:46,036 --> 01:43:48,019
I am Diana Temiscira...

1342
01:43:49,924 --> 01:43:51,781
...daughter of Hippolyta...

1343
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:55,186
...Queen of the Amazons.

1344
01:43:57,909 --> 01:44:00,657
And your wrath upon
this world is over.

1345
01:44:18,142 --> 01:44:20,641
In the name of all that it
is good in this world...

1346
01:44:20,892 --> 01:44:23,493
...I hereby complete the
mission of the Amazons...

1347
01:44:23,779 --> 01:44:25,581
...by ridding this
world of you...

1348
01:44:25,836 --> 01:44:26,838
...forever!

1349
01:45:34,405 --> 01:45:35,406
Diana?

1350
01:45:41,143 --> 01:45:42,144
Diana!

1351
01:45:46,420 --> 01:45:47,959
I killed him.

1352
01:45:49,588 --> 01:45:51,778
I killed him, but nothing stops.

1353
01:45:53,225 --> 01:45:55,899
You kill the god of
war, you stop the war.

1354
01:45:56,175 --> 01:45:58,165
Exactly what we have to do now.

1355
01:45:58,347 --> 01:45:59,748
We need to stop the gas.
Come on.

1356
01:45:59,961 --> 01:46:01,422
No. All this should
have stopped.

1357
01:46:01,531 --> 01:46:02,479
Diana...

1358
01:46:02,523 --> 01:46:04,510
The fighting should have stopped.
Why are they?

1359
01:46:04,511 --> 01:46:06,586
I don't know! I don't know.

1360
01:46:06,807 --> 01:46:07,669
Ares is dead.

1361
01:46:07,908 --> 01:46:10,900
They can now stop fighting.
Why are they still fighting?

1362
01:46:11,108 --> 01:46:12,801
Because maybe it's them!

1363
01:46:13,221 --> 01:46:14,222
Maybe...

1364
01:46:16,058 --> 01:46:18,613
Maybe people aren't always good.

1365
01:46:19,686 --> 01:46:21,534
Ares or no Ares...

1366
01:46:22,836 --> 01:46:26,151
...Maybe it's just,
who they are.

1367
01:46:29,087 --> 01:46:30,378
- Diana...
- No.

1368
01:46:30,709 --> 01:46:32,161
Diana, we can talk
about this later.

1369
01:46:32,366 --> 01:46:33,705
- I need you to come with me.
- No, no!

1370
01:46:33,706 --> 01:46:35,471
After everything I
saw, it can't be!

1371
01:46:35,695 --> 01:46:36,902
Can not be!

1372
01:46:37,352 --> 01:46:39,433
They were killing each other.

1373
01:46:39,685 --> 01:46:42,216
Killing people they cannot see.
Children...

1374
01:46:42,496 --> 01:46:44,082
Children!

1375
01:46:44,317 --> 01:46:46,663
No, it had to be him.
It can not be them!

1376
01:46:46,911 --> 01:46:49,238
Diana, people... I...

1377
01:46:49,496 --> 01:46:51,040
She was right.

1378
01:46:51,567 --> 01:46:52,576
My mother was right.

1379
01:46:52,577 --> 01:46:54,622
She said the world of
men do not deserve you.

1380
01:46:54,824 --> 01:46:56,518
They don't deserve
our help, Steve.

1381
01:46:56,764 --> 01:46:59,321
- It's not about deserve!
- They do not deserve our help.

1382
01:46:59,346 --> 01:47:01,216
Maybe we don't!

1383
01:47:02,877 --> 01:47:05,045
But it's not about that.
It's about what you believe.

1384
01:47:06,042 --> 01:47:08,856
You don't think I get it, after
what I've seen out there?

1385
01:47:10,341 --> 01:47:13,823
You don't think I wish I could tell
you that I was one bad guy to blame?

1386
01:47:14,454 --> 01:47:16,128
It's not!

1387
01:47:18,299 --> 01:47:19,979
We are all to blame.

1388
01:47:20,253 --> 01:47:21,254
I am not.

1389
01:47:22,863 --> 01:47:24,465
But maybe I am!

1390
01:47:28,342 --> 01:47:29,343
Please.

1391
01:47:29,704 --> 01:47:31,563
If you believe that this
war should stop...

1392
01:47:31,564 --> 01:47:33,380
...if you want to stop it...

1393
01:47:33,712 --> 01:47:35,153
...help me stop it right now.

1394
01:47:35,161 --> 01:47:36,462
Because...if.

1395
01:47:37,861 --> 01:47:43,166
If you don't, there will be thousands
more. Please, please come with me.

1396
01:47:43,191 --> 01:47:44,674
I have to go.

1397
01:47:51,195 --> 01:47:52,808
I have to go.

1398
01:48:04,631 --> 01:48:05,667
Hey!

1399
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:11,515
- Where is Diana?
- We are on our own.

1400
01:48:11,658 --> 01:48:14,470
- What?
- What did you see, Charlie?

1401
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:16,497
Seems like a bunch
of gas pumps...

1402
01:48:16,759 --> 01:48:19,093
...but I can't see where
they're taking them.

1403
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:20,730
How are we gonna get in there?

1404
01:48:21,461 --> 01:48:23,564
I have got an idea.
Come on guys.

1405
01:48:23,793 --> 01:48:24,794
Come on!

1406
01:48:38,395 --> 01:48:40,140
Who's there?

1407
01:48:52,613 --> 01:48:54,523
Sir Patrick.

1408
01:48:55,232 --> 01:48:59,563
You were right, Diana.
They don't deserve our help.

1409
01:49:00,726 --> 01:49:04,591
They only deserve destruction.

1410
01:49:05,954 --> 01:49:07,422
You...

1411
01:49:09,096 --> 01:49:11,055
You are him.

1412
01:49:14,523 --> 01:49:15,927
I am.

1413
01:49:16,314 --> 01:49:20,940
But I'm not what
you thought I was.

1414
01:49:41,584 --> 01:49:43,149
What is that?

1415
01:49:44,442 --> 01:49:45,760
Future.

1416
01:49:50,475 --> 01:49:52,481
I'm not your enemy, Diana.

1417
01:49:54,511 --> 01:49:58,250
I'm the only one who
truly knows you.

1418
01:49:58,485 --> 01:50:03,009
And who truly knows
them, as you now do.

1419
01:50:05,324 --> 01:50:08,995
They always been and
always will be...

1420
01:50:09,175 --> 01:50:13,136
...weak, cruel, selfish...

1421
01:50:13,236 --> 01:50:16,510
...and capable of the
greatest horrors.

1422
01:50:25,796 --> 01:50:27,246
All I ever wanted was...

1423
01:50:27,247 --> 01:50:32,306
...for the Gods to see how
evil my father's creation was.

1424
01:50:34,283 --> 01:50:35,428
But they refused.

1425
01:50:35,754 --> 01:50:36,995
I am Diana of Temiscira...

1426
01:50:37,156 --> 01:50:38,654
So I destroyed them.

1427
01:50:38,688 --> 01:50:40,687
...daughter of Hippolyta...

1428
01:50:40,725 --> 01:50:42,757
...and I am here
to complete her...

1429
01:50:50,730 --> 01:50:52,361
The God Killer...

1430
01:50:55,060 --> 01:50:57,082
My dear Child..

1431
01:50:58,409 --> 01:51:00,931
...that's not the God Killer.

1432
01:51:03,425 --> 01:51:04,926
You are.

1433
01:51:07,515 --> 01:51:10,653
Only a God can kill another God.

1434
01:51:11,697 --> 01:51:15,594
Zeus left the child he had
with the queen of the Amazon.

1435
01:51:15,821 --> 01:51:18,094
...As a weapon to
use against me.

1436
01:51:18,119 --> 01:51:19,992
No. You liar.

1437
01:51:21,776 --> 01:51:24,089
I compel you to
tell me the truth.

1438
01:51:26,392 --> 01:51:27,879
I am.

1439
01:51:54,283 --> 01:51:56,629
I'm not the god of war, Diana.

1440
01:51:56,837 --> 01:51:59,305
I am the God of truth.

1441
01:52:00,838 --> 01:52:02,161
Mankind...

1442
01:52:02,795 --> 01:52:05,812
...Stole this world from us.

1443
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:11,316
They ruined it, day by day.

1444
01:52:11,317 --> 01:52:15,593
And I, the only one wise
enough to see it...

1445
01:52:17,049 --> 01:52:19,815
...was left too weak to stop them.

1446
01:52:20,742 --> 01:52:24,368
All these years I have
struggled alone...

1447
01:52:24,369 --> 01:52:26,521
...whispering into their ears.

1448
01:52:26,522 --> 01:52:31,341
Ideas, inspiration
for formulas...

1449
01:52:32,255 --> 01:52:33,851
...weapons...

1450
01:52:36,513 --> 01:52:39,050
...but I don't
make them use them.

1451
01:52:40,109 --> 01:52:42,058
They start these
wars on their own.

1452
01:52:43,054 --> 01:52:46,872
All I do is orchestrate an armistice
I know they cannot keep...

1453
01:52:47,146 --> 01:52:49,391
...in the hope they
will destroy themselves.

1454
01:52:51,449 --> 01:52:53,545
But it has never been enough.

1455
01:52:54,983 --> 01:52:56,082
Until you.

1456
01:52:58,732 --> 01:53:02,986
When you first arrived I
was going to crush you.

1457
01:53:03,564 --> 01:53:06,696
But I knew that if
only you could see...

1458
01:53:06,901 --> 01:53:10,773
...what the other
gods could not...

1459
01:53:12,147 --> 01:53:16,660
...then you would join me, and
with our powers combined...

1460
01:53:16,933 --> 01:53:20,865
...we could finally end all the
pain, all the suffering...

1461
01:53:21,086 --> 01:53:23,651
...destruction they bring.

1462
01:53:24,104 --> 01:53:29,237
And we could return this world to
the paradise it was before them.

1463
01:53:30,841 --> 01:53:32,571
Forever.

1464
01:53:35,462 --> 01:53:36,945
I...

1465
01:53:41,741 --> 01:53:44,475
I can never be a part of that.

1466
01:53:47,597 --> 01:53:50,373
My dear, I don't
want to fight you.

1467
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:52,753
But if I must...

1468
01:54:02,346 --> 01:54:04,201
- Steve!
- Come on, let's go!

1469
01:54:04,710 --> 01:54:05,974
Sammy, let's go!

1470
01:54:06,414 --> 01:54:07,902
Get these things out of here.

1471
01:54:37,837 --> 01:54:42,281
Oh my dear, you have
so much to learn.

1472
01:55:07,311 --> 01:55:09,796
Oh my God!

1473
01:55:10,269 --> 01:55:11,697
What are we gonna do?

1474
01:55:13,455 --> 01:55:15,548
There is not much we can do...

1475
01:55:15,695 --> 01:55:17,324
...if that's who I think it is.

1476
01:55:22,609 --> 01:55:24,548
But we can stop that plane.

1477
01:55:37,754 --> 01:55:39,650
If we could get on the radio...

1478
01:55:39,651 --> 01:55:42,236
...we can ask flying
corp to shoot her down.

1479
01:55:42,261 --> 01:55:45,537
No. If it crashes, it will wipe
everyone out for 50 square miles.

1480
01:55:45,562 --> 01:55:46,481
We gotta ground it!

1481
01:55:46,706 --> 01:55:48,297
Bad news. It's on a timer.

1482
01:55:48,599 --> 01:55:50,757
If we ground it here,
it's the same thing.

1483
01:55:57,791 --> 01:55:59,734
Is it flammable, Chief?

1484
01:55:59,759 --> 01:56:03,237
Yes, you said it's hydrogen.
It's flammable.

1485
01:56:10,378 --> 01:56:12,808
I need you guys to clear
me a path to that plane.

1486
01:56:12,833 --> 01:56:14,985
- No, Steve!
- Hey, Steve!

1487
01:56:17,007 --> 01:56:18,008
Come on!

1488
01:57:00,622 --> 01:57:03,046
Come on! This way! Steve!

1489
01:57:12,612 --> 01:57:14,459
- Come on, Steve.
- Ahead! Go!

1490
01:57:14,873 --> 01:57:16,347
Steve!

1491
01:57:59,265 --> 01:58:02,391
Let's see what kind of
god you really are.

1492
01:58:28,851 --> 01:58:32,195
You will help me
destroy them, Diana.

1493
01:58:35,503 --> 01:58:37,259
Or you will die.

1494
01:58:47,322 --> 01:58:49,674
Come on! Let's move, let's go!
Go. Go. Go.

1495
01:58:52,856 --> 01:58:54,854
- Now!
- Go! Run!

1496
01:59:19,914 --> 01:59:22,659
Is that all you have to offer?

1497
01:59:38,955 --> 01:59:42,876
It is futile to
imagine you can win.

1498
01:59:43,713 --> 01:59:45,422
Give up, Diana.

1499
01:59:49,450 --> 01:59:51,112
Chief! Anything left?

1500
01:59:51,137 --> 01:59:52,072
I got nothing.

1501
01:59:52,097 --> 01:59:53,403
- Anything!
- No!

1502
02:00:11,243 --> 02:00:12,244
Steve.

1503
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:00,171
Steve.

1504
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:07,069
No!

1505
02:01:40,289 --> 02:01:42,891
Yes, Diana!

1506
02:01:43,293 --> 02:01:45,859
Take them all!

1507
02:01:46,204 --> 02:01:49,290
Finally you see.

1508
02:01:49,714 --> 02:01:52,289
Look at this world.

1509
02:01:52,588 --> 02:01:55,404
Mankind did this, not me.

1510
02:01:57,189 --> 02:01:59,262
They are ugly...

1511
02:01:59,287 --> 02:02:01,101
...filled with hatred...

1512
02:02:01,402 --> 02:02:02,485
...weak...

1513
02:02:02,886 --> 02:02:05,610
...Just like your
captain Trevor.

1514
02:02:06,178 --> 02:02:11,892
Gone and left you nothing.
And for what?

1515
02:02:12,279 --> 02:02:13,864
Pathetic!

1516
02:02:15,238 --> 02:02:16,981
He deserved to burn!

1517
02:02:27,991 --> 02:02:32,127
Look at her and
tell me I'm wrong.

1518
02:02:40,534 --> 02:02:44,533
She is the perfect example
of these humans...

1519
02:02:46,289 --> 02:02:50,196
...and unworthy of your
sympathy in every way.

1520
02:02:51,700 --> 02:02:53,847
Destroy her, Diana.

1521
02:02:54,930 --> 02:02:58,289
You know that she deserves.
That they all do.

1522
02:03:01,511 --> 02:03:02,872
Do it!

1523
02:03:07,680 --> 02:03:09,382
Diana!

1524
02:03:12,591 --> 02:03:14,025
Diana...

1525
02:03:23,555 --> 02:03:24,556
What?

1526
02:03:25,056 --> 02:03:26,660
We have to go.

1527
02:03:29,406 --> 02:03:30,899
What are you saying?

1528
02:03:31,465 --> 02:03:32,511
Steve...

1529
02:03:33,343 --> 02:03:35,475
...Whatever it is, I can do it.

1530
02:03:35,801 --> 02:03:36,649
No.. No..

1531
02:03:36,776 --> 02:03:38,165
- Let me do it.
- No.

1532
02:03:38,390 --> 02:03:40,042
It has to be me.

1533
02:03:40,067 --> 02:03:41,721
It has to be me.

1534
02:03:42,041 --> 02:03:45,289
I could save today.
You can save the world.

1535
02:03:54,107 --> 02:03:56,547
I wish we had more time.

1536
02:03:56,792 --> 02:03:59,571
What?
What are you saying?

1537
02:04:02,479 --> 02:04:03,480
I love you!

1538
02:04:15,422 --> 02:04:16,905
You are wrong about them.

1539
02:04:26,677 --> 02:04:28,340
They are everything you say...

1540
02:04:29,208 --> 02:04:30,797
...but so much more.

1541
02:04:31,067 --> 02:04:32,364
Lies!

1542
02:04:58,610 --> 02:05:02,240
They do not deserve
your protection!

1543
02:05:04,016 --> 02:05:05,103
It's not about deserving.

1544
02:05:09,978 --> 02:05:11,882
It's about what you believe.

1545
02:05:15,518 --> 02:05:16,898
And I believe in love.

1546
02:05:16,932 --> 02:05:22,179
Then I will destroy you!

1547
02:05:49,397 --> 02:05:51,126
<i>Goodbye brother.</i>

1548
02:09:23,294 --> 02:09:25,687
<i>I used to want to
save the world.</i>

1549
02:09:26,776 --> 02:09:30,517
<i>To end war and bring
peace to mankind.</i>

1550
02:09:31,271 --> 02:09:35,146
<i>But then I glimpsed the darkness
that lives within their mind</i>

1551
02:09:35,995 --> 02:09:38,260
<i>...and learned that inside
every one of them...</i>

1552
02:09:38,975 --> 02:09:41,261
<i>...there will always be both.</i>

1553
02:09:41,967 --> 02:09:44,823
<i>A choice each must
make for themselves.</i>

1554
02:09:45,090 --> 02:09:48,519
<i>Something no hero
will ever defeat..</i>

1555
02:09:49,865 --> 02:09:51,109
<i>And now I know...</i>

1556
02:09:52,281 --> 02:09:56,824
<i>...that only love can
truly save the world.</i>

1557
02:09:58,546 --> 02:10:00,249
<i>So I stay...</i>

1558
02:10:00,516 --> 02:10:02,670
<i>...I fight and I give...</i>

1559
02:10:05,658 --> 02:10:07,634
<i>...for the world I know can be.</i>

1560
02:10:12,210 --> 02:10:13,878
<i>This is my mission now.</i>

1561
02:10:16,749 --> 02:10:18,092
<i>Forever.</i>

1562
02:10:21,122 --> 02:10:34,122
