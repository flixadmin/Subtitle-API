We'II worry about who kills him later.

321
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,336
Right now, we have to get
the knife before Ra's does.

smoke grenades to cause a diversion.

324

If I may, there maybe another option.

325
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,720
But you got to guarantee
not to stab us in the back.

326
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Again.

327
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,632
S0, in short, we'd like to thank you
very much.

328

Both of us would like to
thank you for taking such good...

329
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,675
Such good care of her.

330
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,715
But now we'd like to
take the knife home. Please.

331
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,154
It was never yours
to begin with, Mr. Pennyworth.

It belongs to my people.

purchased it at auction,

he was rescuing a looted
historical treasure.

335
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,030
That's why you returned it to us.

336
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,631
Yeah. But it was a loan.
Wasn't it, mate?

479
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,240
Now, are you in or are you out?

480
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,152
If it's suicide by Ra's, I'm out.

481
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,509
Fine, then go.

482
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,389
What if she's right?

483
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,711
I can't control The Demon's Head.

484
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,592
Maybe it's like Ra's said. Maybe...

485
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,431
I am just a nightclub owner.

486
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,633
I should have never
trusted those men.

487
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,757
I didn't want you to have
The Demon's Head.

488
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,079
Not even sure I want it now.

489
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,916
Three years we've been together,
on and off.

490
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,638
And I've never seen you
doubt yourself.

491
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,791
So, however you
wanna play this, I'm in.

492
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,039
But if you're saying
you're not worthy,

493
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,799
that's where Ijump ship.

494
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,395
Let's do this.

495
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,800
I suppose on the bright side,
you won't have to kill him.

496
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,709
Again.

497
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,074
- ExcepL I'm the only one who can.
- Well, so said Ra's.

498
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,234
I mean, no disrespect to your
magical daggers and all of that.

499
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,376
But I'd love to see what would happen

500
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,200
if I pulled his head off
his bloody shoulders.

501
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,517
I can't believe
Selina gave Barbara the knife.

502
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
(SCOFFS)

503
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,554
Yeah, well, at least
we know where she stands.

504
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
That's what you think.

505
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,509
Oh, you got a bloody cheek
turning up here.

506
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,152
I gave Barbara the knife
because if there was a chance

507
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,558
she could use it, I wanted her to.

508
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,752
That way,
Bruce didn't have to kill him.

509
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,280
I would've done what I had to do.

510
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,656
And you would've gone straight back

511
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,536
to being the douchebag
you've been the last few months.

512
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,392
So, no, thank you.

513
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,136
She's got a point there,
Master Bruce.

514
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,151
Thanks for the explanation.
You can leave now.

515
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,357
- Bruce...
- You sided with them.

516
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,996
(SIGHS) Why does it have
to be about sides?

517
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,075
There is somebody,

518
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,231
something out there
that needs to be stopped.

519
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,510
So why can't we focus on that?

520
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,949
Another good point.

521
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,875
Barbara and Tabitha
are gonna get themselves killed.

522
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,719
And I don't want that to happen.

523
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,640
GORDON: There were easier banks to hit.

524
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,676
- Why yours?
- I keep telling you.

525
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,480
I have no idea.

526
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
I'm the victim.
You're treating me like a criminal.

527
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,673
Yeah, I wonder
where we'd get that from.

528
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,876
- Excuse me?
- We did some digging,

529
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,232
and your bank has been
investigated for redlining,

530
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,118
usury, illegal foreclosures.

531
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,679
And cleared on all counts.

532
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,640
You have good lawyers.

533
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,799
So we deserve to be robbed?

534
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,960
I'm done here.

535
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,839
Ma'am, can you just
give us a second, please?

536

(DOOR opens)

537
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,551
- What the hell are you doing?
- She's a crook.

538
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,056
A bigger crook
than whoever ripped her off.

539
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,080
You mean like Lee?

540
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,976
Look, brother,
I know what this is about.

541
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,913
You went down to The Narrows
and came back all fired up, okay?

542
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,276
But alienating her
is not gonna help us.

543
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,393
If Lee's involved with Nygma,

544
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,596
we got to stop it before it goes bad.

545
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,837
Which of your branches
are the most vulnerable?

546
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,071
As of this afternoon, none of them.

547
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,151
We have a security protocol.

- Pistol would've been more fun.
- You indulge me.

555
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,991
Breaking open the Vault
is the last detail.

556
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,958
Big detail. How did you solve it?

557
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,599
A little help from some friends.

and are planning to give me
what I want.

572

I've thought about it. A lot.

573

And about us.

But I want you to admit
we had a connection.

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,313
And that those things you said to me

were just mind games

654
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,840
Oswald, we've been
through thick and thin.

655
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,831
And I hold no grudge on you.

656
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,353
But you come against Lee.

657

And you come against me.

I'm gonna dismember you, you twerp!

Yep, not even gonna try with you.

Let's go, Lee.

It won't make any difference.

Why bring Penguin and Grundy if
you're just gonna lock them inside?

668
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,359
I needed Grundy to open the vault.

669
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,119
And Oswald was gonna rob us anyway,

670
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,474
so, just kept an eye on him.

He'II get over it, or he won't.

So you don't think I'm using you?

No. I know you are.

674
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,477
Then why would you
betray your friends for me?

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,960
Is this...

676
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,557
- Are you Ed?
- No, I'm me.

677
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,320
- How can you be sure?
- Because Ed didn't understand you.

678
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,553
He didn't see how deeply
you had changed. I do.

I know that that virus

680
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,911
woke up something deep inside you.

681
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,629
And you let that something loose
when you shot Sofia.

682
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,552
And you love it.

you don't feel same way about me.
