1
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,037
According to our GPS unit,

2
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:08,207
we are directly in the heart
of the Sahara desert.

3
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:11,110
Heh. Wyoming is
not in Africa, is it?

4
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:14,246
Hmph! Technology!

5
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:17,216
Carrot will tell us
when we are near.

6
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:19,685
So where in yellowstone park

7
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:23,389
would a talisman-powered
rabbit hide?

8
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:26,625
It's gotta be
in one of these
giganto rabbit holes.

9
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:29,294
Jade!
Yeah, yeah, I know.

10
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,430
(As Jackie)
You are supposed to be
on the tour.

11
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:34,600
No, Jade!
Those are not rabbit holes!

12
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:38,137
"Danger! Geysers"?

13
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:39,471
(Rumbling)
Uh-oh.

14
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:41,540
(Grunting)

15
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:42,641
Jackie, I'm stuck!

16
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:49,748
Grab on!

17
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:54,186
Whoa-oa-oa-oa!

18
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,526
(Gasps)
Jackie, dark warriors ho!

19
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:04,296
Finn: D-master wong wants
the power of superspeed,
chan.

20
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:07,099
So hand over
the bunny pronto!

21
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:09,535
But we haven't even
found it yet.

22
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:11,737
Be that way.

23
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:12,805
(Gasp)

24
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,197
Aah!

25
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:17,169
Whoa! Timber!

26
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,303
Jade!

27
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,340
Uh, ratso?

28
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:22,908
Aah!

29
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,877
Nice catch.

30
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,412
Oh, thanks.
That was close.

31
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:28,747
Hey!

32
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,320
Come on!

33
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:44,730
So the dark warrior
wants a piece of unc--aah!.

34
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,499
(Chuckles)

35
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,369
A geezer in a geyser.

36
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,237
Jackie!

37
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,839
Stay in here.

38
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,140
Oh!

39
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,046
Hmm.

40
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:02,447
Unh!

41
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,783
I'll teach you
to mess with Finn 2.0.

42
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:05,884
Whoa!

43
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:09,254
(Chanting)

44
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:13,659
And I will teach you
to mess with
uncle original recipe.

45
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,700
Heh. Occupied.

46
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,202
Oh!

47
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:26,538
So that's where you're hiding
Peter cottontail.

48
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,675
You caught me,
Sherlock.

49
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,714
Ooh.

50
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,149
Short ears.

51
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:39,685
Uh...

52
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,954
Yours?

53
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:44,356
(Snarling)

54
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,225
Aah!

55
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,993
Yup. That'll leave a mark.

56
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,334
(Rumbling)

57
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:56,702
Aah!

58
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,570
Sayonara, chan.

59
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,372
Huh?

60
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,507
Finn: Gah!

61
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,511
You mean, "cowabunga."

62
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,513
Come on, uncle.

63
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:20,092
Something tells me
we are close to finding
our rabbit, uncle.

64
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,234
Aah! What manner
demonic creatures
are these?!

65
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,335
Midget deer.

66
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,471
Uncle, they are
rabbits. Ow!

67
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:34,406
Rabbits
do not have antlers!

68
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:36,041
He's right, you know.

69
00:04:36,043 --> 00:04:39,311
Howdy, folks, and welcome
to Douglas, Wyoming,

70
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:42,314
home of the jackalope.

71
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,883
Whatever it is,
it's not packin'
talisman heat.

72
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:48,920
(Gasp)
It destroyed
the locator!

73
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:52,324
Uh, sir, I am hoping
you can help us.

74
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:56,862
It is very important
that we locate
a particular rabbit.

75
00:04:56,864 --> 00:05:00,232
Heh heh, well,
you're barkin' up
the wrong tree, partner.

76
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:02,601
I said this was
jackalope country.

77
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,973
Look, we both know
jackalopes are rabbits

78
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,043
who wear fake antlers
for the tourists.

79
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:13,478
(Chuckles) No sirree.

80
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,283
I assure you
that Douglas jackalopes
are the real deal.

81
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,022
Now, that was
an ugly thing to do.

82
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:28,293
Jade, you know
the dark warriors
could return at any time.

83
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:31,363
Uncle and I must search
for the rabbit alone.

84
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:35,400
But, Jackie,
I'm an essential member
of clan chan!

85
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:39,271
Which is why I am giving you
an essential mission.

86
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:41,173
Go to the nice library
down the block,

87
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,208
and do your homework.

88
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,844
Ooh. Highly classified.

89
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:52,617
When is Jackie gonna realize
I'm his secret weapon?!

90
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:55,153
Tch! His loss
if he can't figure out

91
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:57,222
I have a nose
for sniffing out magic.

92
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,290
Whoa!

93
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,462
I got it, coach!

94
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,464
Psyche!

95
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,400
Good arm.

96
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,205
Thanks for making me
look bad, kid.

97
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,272
Coach: Hey, chip!

98
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:15,474
Ready for me, coach?

99
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,809
How about some h-2-0
for the troops?

100
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:20,579
Oh, right away,
coach.

101
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,484
Nice work, chip.

102
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:28,820
Now, let's get all
that equipment stacked
nice and neat.

103
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:30,155
Then can I get in
some practice

104
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,223
for the big game
tonight?

105
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,290
We'll talk.

106
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:33,492
Now hustle!

107
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,470
Hey, sorry I goofed on you
back there, chip.

108
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:46,938
Whatever.

109
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,674
It's tough enough
getting coach to
take me seriously.

110
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:52,344
I don't need
your help in
that department.

111
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:54,212
Tch! Listen, chip.

112
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:57,749
If there's one rule
Jade chan lives by,
it's this.

113
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,217
If coach won't
give you a shot,

114
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,620
you have to put yourself
in the game.

115
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,221
You're just
a little girl.

116
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,390
What do you know
about football?

117
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:08,660
Let's just say my coach
doesn't always
put me in the game,

118
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:11,663
but I know you can't
make the big plays
from the sidelines.

119
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,031
Totally.

120
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:16,401
I mean, I'm as good
as any of
the other players.

121
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,770
Well, I could be
faster.

122
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,472
Faster shmaster.

123
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,774
I can see you've got
what it takes.

124
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,109
You can?

125
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,510
Sure thing.

126
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:27,279
So are you gonna
just stand there
and look pretty

127
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,948
or are you gonna
belt this pigskin
to the moon?

128
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,052
Go jackalopes!

129
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,120
Coach: Hey, chip!

130
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,188
Huh?

131
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,723
You need me coach?

132
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,859
Yeah. Did you
feed lucky?

133
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,727
Ohh.

134
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,329
Right away, coach.

135
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,865
Lucky?

136
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,333
Our mascot.

137
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,802
Yeah, we never lost
a game he's been at.

138
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,939
The other schools
try to steal him
just to jinx us.

139
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:57,742
Lucky wouldn't
happen to be
a rabbit, would he?

140
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:58,944
Jackalope.

141
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:08,653
Chip: Mmm.

142
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,322
There you go, luckster.

143
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:20,465
Hmm, can a rabbit
wear silly antlers
and still be noble?

144
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:21,933
Let's find out.

145
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,902
Shoo.

146
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,373
Vamoose!

147
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,774
Come on, super-speed,

148
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,376
and you're off.

149
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:33,445
Activate already!

150
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,286
Oopsy.

151
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,425
(Pants)

152
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:49,661
Jackie, I found
our bunny.

153
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,596
You--wha--
you did what?

154
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:52,831
(Sighs)

155
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,801
Jade, what was the bunny
doing at the library?

156
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,803
Uh--crrrrrr.

157
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,272
Uh, you're
breaking up.

158
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:01,740
Meet me at
the town square--

159
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,408
crrrr--and make it
snappy.

160
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,214
Chip!

161
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,349
You need me coach?

162
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,952
You wanna explain that?

163
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:22,360
Locator carrots also
make good rabbit bait.

164
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,331
Jade:
Here comes turbo-hare.

165
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,401
Jackie: Got you!

166
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,173
Aaahhh!

167
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:40,645
Aah! Ugh!

168
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,617
Nooo--oof!

169
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:55,760
Aah--oop!

170
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,696
Oof!

171
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:58,797
Ohh.

172
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,265
Whoa!

173
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:05,637
Jackie, you are terrible
rabbit catcher.

174
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:10,041
You have to go about
this the right way,
Jack-rabbit.

175
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,077
Speed catches speed.

176
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:16,948
Jade: Go get 'em.

177
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,622
Come to Jackie!

178
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,357
Eeeyaaah.

179
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:28,426
Bad day, bad day,
bad day!

180
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:32,998
Jackie: Yes!

181
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,165
Come to Jackie!

182
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:36,601
Jackie: Huh?

183
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,138
Daolon wong.

184
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,410
Daolon: Ah, super-speed.

185
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:48,446
Chip: I know I shut
the cage door.

186
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,649
I bet that Jade girl
took lucky.

187
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,351
She's gotta be a ringer
for the other team.

188
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:55,253
Oh, if coach
ever finds out

189
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,855
I led her
to our mascot,

190
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,990
I'll be benched forever.

191
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:03,762
Whoa.

192
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:04,896
Lucky.

193
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,733
Whoa--agh!

194
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,201
(Chants)

195
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,537
Sir, you are
in possession of

196
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,005
Warren oates
memorial high

197
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,840
football team
property.

198
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,542
Haaa!
Whoa!

199
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,477
What school
are you from?

200
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,547
I will not
bring it back later!

201
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:23,682
Thank you!

202
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:27,152
How many schools
are trying to nab him?

203
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:30,255
Because of you,
I have lost
the rabbit.

204
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:31,356
(Gulp)

205
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,792
Um, it's a jackalope.

206
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,164
Mondo blading, Jackie.

207
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:41,499
Listen carefully...

208
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,868
Aah! Shoo!
(Blows air)

209
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,004
For you will bring
the rabbit to me

210
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:49,374
tonight at
the town square.

211
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:52,110
Tch! In your dreams,
creepopotamus.

212
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:53,478
If you do not,

213
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,182
this child's fate
shall haunt
your dreams.

214
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,283
(Jade gasps)

215
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,884
Chip!

216
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,857
Jade: Jackie.

217
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,058
It's all my fault.

218
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,593
We have to
rescue chip.

219
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,695
Of course,
and we will--ow!

220
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,397
We cannot hand
over the rabbit

221
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,099
to forces
of darkness.

222
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:16,234
Of course,
and we won't.

223
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,671
Jackie?

224
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,773
I just had a light bulb.

225
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,780
Come on, jackalopes.

226
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:30,348
We don't need lucky
to win.

227
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,584
Announcer:
Touchdown, bears.

228
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:35,320
That chip better find
lucky soon.

229
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:37,388
Chip: Please
let me go, mister.

230
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,890
The game already started,

231
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,191
and it's homecoming,

232
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,259
and this could be my--

233
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,327
silence!

234
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,495
If I must hear about

235
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:45,930
your cursed big chance
once more--

236
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,466
Jackie: Daolon wong.

237
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:49,801
Hand over the boy.

238
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:53,104
Not until you deliver
the power of the--

239
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,175
that is not the rabbit.

240
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,910
Uh, yes, it is.

241
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,545
Then why does it
not move?

242
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,681
Um, it is napping?

243
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,118
(Chants quietly)

244
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,789
Wake up!

245
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,857
See? It moved.

246
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:15,026
If this is indeed
the rabbit,

247
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:18,129
why does my scepter
not glow bright red?

248
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,631
Um.

249
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,835
Because it is really
a jackalope.

250
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,346
Aiyaah!
Whoa!
Bwaa!

251
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,884
(Chants rapidly)

252
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,019
Huh?

253
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,421
Jackie, what's
taking you?

254
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:46,024
Jade? You are supposed
to be at the motel,

255
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,158
guarding the--

256
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,561
rabbit.

257
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:51,362
Daolon: Hoo!

258
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,264
No sweat, Jackie.

259
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,866
As long as I have
the rabbit,

260
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,634
old rigor mortis
can't catch me.

261
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,639
don't worry, chip.

262
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,041
You're in
good hands.

263
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,243
So you did kidnap lucky.

264
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,412
It was me or the forces
of darkness.

265
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:08,546
Duh.

266
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:09,681
Yaah!

267
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,685
Lucky's more than lucky.

268
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,920
He's magic.

269
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:17,388
Jade:
I'm greased lightning.

270
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,059
Jade!

271
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,928
Whoop!
Ooh!

272
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,029
Jade.

273
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,164
Give me that.

274
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,665
Chip: Hand-off.

275
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:30,235
Time to put myself
in the game.

276
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:31,469
No, wait!

277
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,505
Ball hog.

278
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,074
Grrr!

279
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,846
Both my running backs
are out of the game?

280
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,516
Ready for me now, coach?

281
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,619
What do I have to lose?

282
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,692
Only one way we can
win this one, lucky.

283
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,646
Announcer:
Touchdown, jackalopes.

284
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,482
He's fast.

285
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:26,991
I knew it.
There's chip.

286
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,694
Jackie, you must
retrieve the rabbit.

287
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,562
How can I get near him?

288
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,897
Oh, wardrobe.

289
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,074
Announcer:
Unbelievable!

290
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:46,077
Another touchdown,
jackalopes!

291
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,379
Yeah, chip!
That's my boy.

292
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,114
You know, he's like
a son to me.

293
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,785
Show 'em what you got,
chan-man.

294
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,759
Gan! Ren! Chui!

295
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,264
Hey, football.

296
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,032
Bonding time,
eh, big "d"?

297
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:10,134
We knew you were
one of us.

298
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,235
Ugh!

299
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:12,670
The rabbit.

300
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,341
Let's win one
for the wongster.

301
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,309
Go dark warriors.

302
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,315
Grrr.

303
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,651
I will destroy you.

304
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,287
Uncle, singsong:
Hey, ugly!

305
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,293
(Daolon and uncle chant)

306
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,134
Hey!

307
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,702
Chip, please give me
the rabbit.

308
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:47,105
No way. I'm on
a major streak here.

309
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,146
Listen, you are in
grave danger.

310
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,381
Hike.

311
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,319
Time-out.

312
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,887
Baaahhh!

313
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,789
He's going the wrong way.

314
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,657
Who is that guy?

315
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,259
(Chants)
(Chants)

316
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,871
Uh-oh, uncle
needs an assist.

317
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,473
Hey, girls,
wanna learn
a new cheer?

318
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:23,875
(Pants)

319
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:24,942
Huh?

320
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,679
Whoa-oh.

321
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:29,814
Chip!

322
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,216
Jackie: Buh!

323
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,585
Dah! Egh!

324
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:37,955
Yaah!

325
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:39,023
Sorry.

326
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,627
That's not how
I drew up the play.

327
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:45,096
Uh, I don't have
the ball, guys.

328
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:47,165
But you do have
Mr. floppy ears.

329
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,305
Chip: Baaah!

330
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,606
Oh ho ho.

331
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,408
Ohh.

332
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,010
Lucky?

333
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:00,578
Fumble!

334
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,684
Catch!

335
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,488
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

336
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,992
Please do not run,
little bunny rabbit.

337
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:16,427
Come to Jackie.

338
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,663
It's ok.

339
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,131
Good bunny.

340
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,068
Give me a "d"!

341
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,403
"D"!
"D"!
"D"!

342
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:26,537
Give me a <i> zho!</i>

343
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:27,738
<i>Zho!</i>
À <i> zho!</i>
À <i> zho!</i>

344
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,340
Put that together,
and what do
you have?

345
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:32,577
(Cheering in Chinese)

346
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,452
Erggghhh.

347
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,887
Urggghhh.

348
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:43,955
Gaah!

349
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,660
Go, jackalopes.

350
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,262
Jade, where's lucky?

351
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,564
There's only 10 seconds
left in the game.

352
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,002
Lucky's taking 5, chip,

353
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,237
but that's all right

354
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,506
because you don't need
no stinkin' rabbit.

355
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,608
You can win it
on your own.

356
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,742
You think?

357
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:05,977
I know.

358
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,045
Now go out there,
show us what you're made of,

359
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:10,615
and win one
for the jadester.

360
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,117
Hey, buddy,
that's our mascot.

361
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,453
Uh, you must be
mistaken.

362
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:16,654
No antlers.

363
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:19,724
Quarterback: Hike.

364
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,811
(Slow motion)
He's gonna make it!

365
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:55,059
Crowd: Chip! Chip! Chip!

366
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,160
Chip! Chip! Chip!

367
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:58,062
Chip! Chip! Chip!

368
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,130
Player: You the man!

369
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,035
Who knew you had it
in you, son?

370
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,837
Let's try starting you
in the next game.

371
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,712
Aw, keep
your rabbit.

372
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,847
That kid's
my good luck charm.

373
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,620
Yep, he's a chip off
the old block.

374
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,997
Hey, Jackie,
how many push-ups
do you do a day?

375
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,832
There's a lot of things
to train.

376
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,467
Push-ups, lift-ups,

377
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:37,868
kicking, punch,

378
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,738
30 each for 6 times.

379
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,109
It's not like I can do
1000 push-ups,
then what?

380
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,378
After you do
1000 push-ups,

381
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,614
you can't.
You cannot do anything.
