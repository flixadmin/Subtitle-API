1
00:00:00,735 --> 00:00:02,668
- Previously on Gotham...
- Oh, no.

2
00:00:03,323 --> 00:00:05,623
Help me, help me! Somebody help!

3
00:00:05,658 --> 00:00:08,802
They think she might've
fallen asleep at the wheel.

4
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,160
Her brake lines were cut!

5
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,174
Which leaves one conclusion: murder.

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,743
And I know who did it.

7
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:16,912
Hold on, Butch.

8
00:00:16,948 --> 00:00:19,215
I might be in trouble.
I stole a necklace.

9
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,816
Why is this necklace so important?

10
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:22,284
What makes someone kill for it?

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,086
- What is it?
- A key.

12
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:25,554
We need to go somewhere.

13
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,655
Go to my house.

14
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:28,090
You two are a couple now?

15
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:29,758
- No.
- Yes.

16
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:31,860
My engagement announcement is

17
00:00:31,896 --> 00:00:33,195
coming out in The Gazette tomorrow,

18
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:36,198
and it will feature Mario's
name, his family name.

19
00:00:36,234 --> 00:00:39,101
You mean Falcone?

20
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:42,504
Such a beautiful space
for a rehearsal dinner.

21
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,173
We can't thank you enough.

22
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:47,309
And did Roberto's food
live up to all my hype?

23
00:00:47,345 --> 00:00:48,711
Are you kidding?

24
00:00:48,746 --> 00:00:50,713
Ugh, any more burrata,
and I wouldn't fit

25
00:00:50,748 --> 00:00:53,582
into my wedding dress.

26
00:00:53,618 --> 00:00:55,451
Can't believe we're getting
married in two days.

27
00:00:55,486 --> 00:00:56,685
Have you two settled on a, uh,

28
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:58,631
honeymoon destination?

29
00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,577
Uh, no.

30
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:02,224
But Lee finally agreed to
take some time off of work.

31
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,792
With everything going on, I
didn't want to leave anybody

32
00:01:03,828 --> 00:01:05,060
in the lurch.

33
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:07,696
I was very sorry to hear
about Captain Barnes.

34
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:09,131
He's a good man.

35
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:12,234
What he did was due
entirely to the virus.

36
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,937
What's truly frightening
is that nobody knew.

37
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:16,171
Nobody could see it.

38
00:01:16,207 --> 00:01:17,606
There aren't any symptoms?

39
00:01:17,642 --> 00:01:19,675
Well, looking back
now, there were signs.

40
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,244
Increased strength,
emotional instability...

41
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,812
Nothing he couldn't hide.

42
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:25,447
The lab analyzing

43
00:01:25,483 --> 00:01:27,082
Alice Tetch's blood has developed a test

44
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:28,217
to see if someone's infected.

45
00:01:28,252 --> 00:01:29,618
You're kidding? When?

46
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:30,953
They just finished.

47
00:01:30,988 --> 00:01:32,988
It's a step toward finding a cure.

48
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:35,124
How are we? Good?

49
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,258
Wonderful, Roberto.

50
00:01:36,294 --> 00:01:38,093
We can't wait for tomorrow night.

51
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:40,996
Oh, your rehearsal dinner's
gonna be fantastico.

52
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:42,731
We're gonna take care of everything.

53
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:44,099
It's a privilege to serve you again,

54
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:45,734
Don Falcone.

55
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,746
Don Falcone, please.

56
00:01:57,782 --> 00:01:59,214
We'll pull your car around.

57
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,482
Ah, okay.

58
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:02,384
Wonderful evening, Roberto.

59
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,019
You betcha.

60
00:02:06,123 --> 00:02:08,023
I love you.

61
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:09,658
I love you too.

62
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:22,027

63
00:02:25,343 --> 00:02:27,476
You don't understand anything, okay?

64
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:29,345
My friend got blown up.

65
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,146
And I want to know what happened?

66
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:32,514
Can you explain that to me?

67
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,327
We need to talk.

68
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:48,063
Is everyone okay?

69
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:49,665
A few first degree burns, but that's it.

70
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,866
They're lucky.

71
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:52,434
Any idea who might've done this?

72
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,870
I've made my share of
enemies over the years.

73
00:02:54,905 --> 00:02:56,338
Could be anyone.

74
00:02:56,374 --> 00:02:58,340
Why come after you now?

75
00:02:58,376 --> 00:02:59,942
My oldest son is getting married.

76
00:02:59,977 --> 00:03:01,944
When better to settle an old score

77
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:03,078
and hurt me and my family?

78
00:03:03,114 --> 00:03:04,079
Maybe.

79
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:05,781
Or maybe someone thinks

80
00:03:05,816 --> 00:03:07,349
you're coming out of retirement?

81
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:08,884
I'm not.

82
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,419
Good.

83
00:03:10,454 --> 00:03:13,255
Doesn't mean I'm gonna stand
by after something like this.

84
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,492
The captain of police was
just indicted for murder

85
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:17,559
and sent to Arkham.

86
00:03:17,595 --> 00:03:19,628
The last thing I need
is you and your men

87
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:22,264
tearing up Gotham looking for revenge.

88
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:25,134
I didn't start this.

89
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:27,569
I'll get to the bottom of it.

90
00:03:27,605 --> 00:03:29,905
You have my word.

91
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:33,942
I'll give you one day.

92
00:03:43,254 --> 00:03:46,321
As members of the Five Families,

93
00:03:46,357 --> 00:03:47,589
you are well aware that

94
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,426
with the tragic downfall
of Captain Barnes,

95
00:03:50,461 --> 00:03:52,561
people are frightened.

96
00:03:52,596 --> 00:03:55,764
They will be looking
to us for stability.

97
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,000
To feel safe.

98
00:03:58,035 --> 00:03:59,735
So...

99
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,239
how does a 50% increase
on protection fees sound?

100
00:04:05,543 --> 00:04:06,675
Sounds a little steep to me.

101
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,744
What do we have here?

102
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:10,512
Little family reunion?

103
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:12,848
- My invitation get lost in the mail?
- No.

104
00:04:12,883 --> 00:04:14,616
This meeting is for grown-ups,

105
00:04:14,652 --> 00:04:16,852
so I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

106
00:04:16,887 --> 00:04:18,420
Hmm. Quick question.

107
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:22,958
Is it, "How do I commit suicide?"

108
00:04:22,993 --> 00:04:25,127
Because that answer is coming.

109
00:04:25,162 --> 00:04:27,529
Tabitha and Butch are
missing. Where are they?

110
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:29,431
I have no idea.

111
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:32,067
I have not seen Butch since his little

112
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:34,703
summer stock revival
of the Red Hood Gang.

113
00:04:34,738 --> 00:04:36,638
Let's cut the crap, shall we?

114
00:04:36,674 --> 00:04:38,140
Tabitha has been helping Butch hide

115
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:39,541
since your little victory celebration.

116
00:04:39,577 --> 00:04:41,243
They're an item now.

117
00:04:41,278 --> 00:04:42,845
Barf. She's supposed to
check in every night,

118
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,979
and she hasn't.

119
00:04:44,014 --> 00:04:45,180
She's not answering her phone

120
00:04:45,216 --> 00:04:47,149
and no one has seen her.

121
00:04:47,184 --> 00:04:48,717
And you think I took them?

122
00:04:48,752 --> 00:04:49,952
Obviously.

123
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:53,989
How about this?

124
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:55,524
You lower your gun

125
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:58,360
and beg my forgiveness

126
00:04:58,395 --> 00:05:00,629
for this gross insubordination,

127
00:05:00,664 --> 00:05:03,198
and I might let you
walk out of here alive.

128
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,746
My apologies.

129
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:20,849
They must've run off
somewhere without telling me.

130
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:23,919
Love...

131
00:05:23,954 --> 00:05:26,388
makes people do crazy
things, doesn't it?

132
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:30,158
We have a history,

133
00:05:30,194 --> 00:05:31,760
you and I.

134
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:34,830
But if you ever point a gun at me again,

135
00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:38,200
Olga will be cleaning
your brains off the floor.

136
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,938
She's a real whiz with stains.

137
00:05:42,973 --> 00:05:44,973
Bye, Pengy.

138
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:49,144
Everyone out.

139
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:51,413
Now.

140
00:05:55,953 --> 00:05:57,619
Are you checking up on me?

141
00:05:57,655 --> 00:05:59,721
What? No.

142
00:05:59,757 --> 00:06:01,256
Barbara Kean was just here.

143
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:02,624
She's looking for them.

144
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,625
So?

145
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:04,626
So...

146
00:06:04,662 --> 00:06:06,528
are you finished yet?

147
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:07,629
We've talked about this.

148
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:09,364
I need to work through my grief,

149
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,666
my way.

150
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:11,667
Of course.

151
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:13,535
And I support you.

152
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:17,506
Any chance you could work
through it a smidge faster?

153
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,242
I am swamped today.

154
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,083
Sorry you had to hear that.

155
00:06:28,118 --> 00:06:31,887
He can just be so self-centered.

156
00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:32,955
What were we talking about?

157
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,089
I'm gonna kill you!

158
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:35,324
Oh, right, how I found you.

159
00:06:36,694 --> 00:06:39,161
Well...

160
00:06:39,196 --> 00:06:41,029
it wasn't hard.

161
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:43,165
The next time you want to disappear,

162
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,833
consider taking a sabbatical
from your favorite restaurant.

163
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:46,468
Your love of Gusto's eggplant parmesan

164
00:06:46,503 --> 00:06:48,003
isn't exactly a state secret.

165
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:50,572
Come here.

166
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:53,575
That, with a healthy amount
of Midazolam in your food

167
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:54,843
to knock you out, 100 bucks

168
00:06:54,878 --> 00:06:56,745
to your delivery boy, who by the way,

169
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,215
I get the feeling hasn't been
being tipped very well, Butch.

170
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,920
I'm sorry, what was that?

171
00:07:07,257 --> 00:07:08,590
You're gonna regret this.

172
00:07:08,626 --> 00:07:10,292
You touch one hair

173
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:12,194
on her head, I swear I'll kill you.

174
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:13,395
Save your strength, big guy.

175
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,130
You're gonna need it.

176
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:18,033
You tell Penguin he's a coward!

177
00:07:18,068 --> 00:07:20,235
If he wants me dead, he should come here

178
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,204
and do it like a man.

179
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:28,110
This has nothing to do with Penguin.

180
00:07:28,145 --> 00:07:29,411
And you...

181
00:07:29,446 --> 00:07:31,713
are the coward.

182
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:34,049
Killing an innocent woman.

183
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:35,050
What?

184
00:07:35,085 --> 00:07:36,051
Who?

185
00:07:36,086 --> 00:07:38,387
Isabella.

186
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:41,256
She was my everything,
and you took her from me.

187
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:44,526
What in the hell are you talking about?

188
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,432
I was hoping you'd be difficult.

189
00:08:02,713 --> 00:08:05,747
Hey. You okay?

190
00:08:05,783 --> 00:08:06,882
Stomach.

191
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:08,250
If being acting captain

192
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:10,085
is such of a strain, why do it?

193
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,387
I'm the senior guy around here.

194
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:13,755
- What about Tuttle?
- Tuttle?

195
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,091
Guy shot a cat last week.

196
00:08:16,126 --> 00:08:17,192
On purpose?

197
00:08:17,227 --> 00:08:18,760
Does it matter?

198
00:08:18,796 --> 00:08:20,829
Look, I might not have always
seen eye-to-eye with Barnes,

199
00:08:20,864 --> 00:08:22,998
but he was a good captain.

200
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:24,433
Least I can do is keep his seat warm

201
00:08:24,468 --> 00:08:27,102
until they find some kind
of cure for this virus.

202
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:28,270
Detective Gordon.

203
00:08:28,305 --> 00:08:29,738
Car bomb used a mercury switch

204
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:31,506
with military-grade plastic.

205
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:35,110
That's kind of high-end for a mob hit.

206
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:36,478
That's not all.

207
00:08:36,513 --> 00:08:38,680
The explosive was laced with
some sort of accelerant.

208
00:08:38,716 --> 00:08:41,683
Made the explosion burn at ten
times the heat of standard C-4.

209
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,386
Whoever set this bomb didn't
want anything left behind.

210
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:45,520
Only one guy I know with

211
00:08:45,556 --> 00:08:46,988
that level of expertise.

212
00:08:47,024 --> 00:08:48,657
Ex-military nut job.

213
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:51,126
Goes by the name of "Fuse".

214
00:08:57,167 --> 00:09:00,235
- This is our guy.
- Not for nothing,

215
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,503
but ensuring Don Falcone's safety

216
00:09:01,538 --> 00:09:03,872
is not why I wear the badge.

217
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:06,174
- Well, it's not just about him.
- You mean Lee.

218
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,009
If you're worried, you
could tell her not to marry

219
00:09:08,045 --> 00:09:10,946
the son of a former crime boss.

220
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:16,619
GCPD!

221
00:09:26,563 --> 00:09:28,430
Dead but still warm.

222
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:31,066
Whoever did this must've just left.

223
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:32,667
So whoever hired Fuse to plant the bomb

224
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:34,169
doesn't want any loose ends?

225
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:37,172
Looks like he was on
his way out of town.

226
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:39,441
Must've figured his employers
weren't that forgiving.

227
00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:40,976
Guy can pack,

228
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:42,477
I'll give him that much.

229
00:09:42,513 --> 00:09:44,212
Once a soldier, always a soldier.

230
00:09:45,516 --> 00:09:48,083
Bed sheets aren't tucked in.

231
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:56,758
Times,

232
00:09:56,794 --> 00:10:01,029
locations, surveillance photos.

233
00:10:01,064 --> 00:10:02,731
This doesn't make any sense.

234
00:10:02,766 --> 00:10:03,899
What?

235
00:10:03,934 --> 00:10:07,202
Carmine's not the target.

236
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:30,492
Down!

237
00:10:38,535 --> 00:10:40,635
What the hell's going on?

238
00:10:40,671 --> 00:10:42,470
Carmine's not the target.

239
00:10:42,506 --> 00:10:44,506
You are.

240
00:10:53,114 --> 00:10:54,714
There you are. Voila.

241
00:10:54,749 --> 00:10:56,349
Thank you very much, Master Bruce.

242
00:10:56,384 --> 00:10:57,516
What is this?

243
00:10:57,552 --> 00:10:58,517
That is a

244
00:10:58,553 --> 00:11:00,553
Pennyworth signature frittata.

245
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:03,356
It's a crustless quiche.

246
00:11:04,492 --> 00:11:05,591
It's eggs, miss. Just...

247
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:07,093
Just eat it, will you?

248
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:09,862
Where's your mate, anyway?

249
00:11:09,897 --> 00:11:11,097
Conservatory.

250
00:11:11,132 --> 00:11:12,865
Girl loves it there.

251
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,500
Well, she's hardly what you call

252
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:15,735
a girl,

253
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,269
- is she?
- Yeah.

254
00:11:17,305 --> 00:11:20,673
Well, thanks for the crustless

255
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,775
egg thing, but I got errands to run.

256
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,110
Uh no, sorry, miss. No one is to

257
00:11:24,145 --> 00:11:25,611
leave the house, until we find exactly

258
00:11:25,646 --> 00:11:27,380
who is following you.

259
00:11:27,415 --> 00:11:29,515
It's been days, I can't take it anymore.

260
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,851
I'm sorry, what is it
exactly that you object to?

261
00:11:31,886 --> 00:11:33,052
Is it the gourmet food
or the king-sized,

262
00:11:33,087 --> 00:11:34,487
double bed with the Egyptian linen?

263
00:11:34,522 --> 00:11:35,688
Would you tell the help here

264
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:37,857
that I can come and go
as I please, please?

265
00:11:37,892 --> 00:11:39,258
Alfred's right.

266
00:11:39,293 --> 00:11:41,127
It's not safe for you
to be in Gotham alone.

267
00:11:41,162 --> 00:11:44,497
I've been in Gotham,
alone, my whole life.

268
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:48,000
I can take care of
myself. Nothing's changed.

269
00:11:48,035 --> 00:11:51,003
Yeah. You've made that clear.

270
00:11:51,038 --> 00:11:52,772
What's that supposed to mean?

271
00:11:52,807 --> 00:11:54,774
Nothing.

272
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:55,941
Those men were willing
to kill for this key.

273
00:11:55,977 --> 00:11:57,943
We need to know why.
I'll be in the study.

274
00:11:57,979 --> 00:12:00,413
There's more books I
haven't gone through.

275
00:12:00,448 --> 00:12:02,248
There has to be a reference
to the key somewhere.

276
00:12:02,283 --> 00:12:05,317
And have you stopped to consider
that maybe it's just an old key?

277
00:12:05,353 --> 00:12:07,019
No.

278
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:22,568
I'll get you some breakfast, miss.

279
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:24,970
You know, some of these plants would do

280
00:12:25,006 --> 00:12:27,706
much better in direct sunlight.

281
00:12:27,742 --> 00:12:29,141
Could you turn off the alarm

282
00:12:29,177 --> 00:12:30,810
so I can put them outside?

283
00:12:30,845 --> 00:12:32,311
Well, maybe later.

284
00:12:32,346 --> 00:12:34,046
I'd rather not you be walking
around the grounds on your own.

285
00:12:37,218 --> 00:12:39,018
Can you smell this?

286
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:41,687
Beg your pardon?

287
00:12:42,757 --> 00:12:44,723
Right here.

288
00:12:50,998 --> 00:12:52,998
Oh, what is that?

289
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:53,999
Just a mix of clove,

290
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:57,937
fenugreek and yarrow root oils.

291
00:12:57,972 --> 00:12:59,538
It's lovely.

292
00:12:59,574 --> 00:13:00,773
It is, isn't it?

293
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:02,475
- Yeah.
- Now,

294
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,677
I need you to tell me something, okay?

295
00:13:05,713 --> 00:13:07,480
Anything.

296
00:13:07,515 --> 00:13:10,015
How do you turn off the alarm?

297
00:13:16,457 --> 00:13:17,623
This doesn't make any sense.

298
00:13:17,658 --> 00:13:20,192
Do you know anyone who
might want you dead?

299
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:21,994
You can't be serious.

300
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:23,829
- Everyone has enemies.
- No, Detective.

301
00:13:23,865 --> 00:13:25,564
- They don't.
- Regardless,

302
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,799
you need to limit your exposure.

303
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:28,167
Lay low for a while,

304
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:29,668
until I can find out who's behind this.

305
00:13:29,704 --> 00:13:31,170
How do you propose I do that?

306
00:13:31,205 --> 00:13:33,806
I'm picking up our wedding
rings this afternoon.

307
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:35,441
Lee and I are getting married tomorrow.

308
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:38,110
Oh.

309
00:13:38,145 --> 00:13:40,412
You want me to cancel the wedding.

310
00:13:40,448 --> 00:13:41,413
I just want to keep you safe.

311
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:43,082
I'd bet you'd love that.

312
00:13:43,117 --> 00:13:44,450
I run home to Lee,

313
00:13:44,485 --> 00:13:46,552
tell her we need to hide
until Detective Gordon can

314
00:13:46,587 --> 00:13:48,721
- save the day?
- This is not a time for ego.

315
00:13:48,756 --> 00:13:50,256
Oh, you're talking to me about ego?

316
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:54,493
How do I even know you're
gonna be able to find him?

317
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:56,095
Or that you'll even try?

318
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,897
You need to trust me.

319
00:13:57,932 --> 00:14:00,432
Whoever is behind this
is gonna keep coming

320
00:14:00,468 --> 00:14:02,801
until they get the job done.

321
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:05,104
If that's true,

322
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:08,073
it doesn't matter where
we go or what we do.

323
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:10,075
As long as I got a target on my back,

324
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:11,777
Lee isn't safe.

325
00:14:18,286 --> 00:14:19,785
- Hey.
- Yeah?

326
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:22,955
Keep an eye on Mario.
Don't let him leave.

327
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,790
What are you doing?

328
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:26,358
I'm keeping an eye on Mario.

329
00:14:26,394 --> 00:14:27,593
Don't look at him.

330
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:29,028
What the hell's going on?

331
00:14:29,063 --> 00:14:30,262
I don't know, something doesn't fit.

332
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:32,131
I need to talk to Carmine.

333
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,732
Maybe once he knows Mario is the target,

334
00:14:33,768 --> 00:14:37,369
something will jog his memory. Just...

335
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:38,370
- Just keep it...
- I... yeah.

336
00:14:38,406 --> 00:14:40,105
I got it.

337
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,450
Hello, comrade.

338
00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:54,553
Comrade is not a Russian word.

339
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,455
Oh, shut up, of course it is.

340
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,923
You shouldn't be here.

341
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,225
Relax. I know Penguin's
out for a few hours.

342
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:03,095
I just want to talk.

343
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,930
I don't know anything.

344
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:06,298
Listen,

345
00:15:06,334 --> 00:15:08,934
I grew up in a place like this.

346
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,803
A large staff of people

347
00:15:10,838 --> 00:15:13,072
always coming and going.

348
00:15:13,107 --> 00:15:14,506
Listening.

349
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:18,177
You can't help but overhear things.

350
00:15:18,212 --> 00:15:21,013
Is handsome ring.

351
00:15:21,048 --> 00:15:23,649
It is. And very expensive.

352
00:15:24,852 --> 00:15:26,585
I bet it would look
just fabulous on you.

353
00:15:32,126 --> 00:15:33,359
Mr. Penguin,

354
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:34,994
he treat me nice.

355
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:37,663
I have warm feeling for him.

356
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:39,598
But the other one...

357
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:40,833
Nygma?

358
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:43,335
Don't know why Mr. Penguin

359
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:45,270
likes him so much.

360
00:15:45,306 --> 00:15:47,172
He could do better.

361
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,507
Wait.

362
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:50,442
You mean likes, likes?

363
00:15:51,846 --> 00:15:53,412
Wow. Okay, we should definitely

364
00:15:53,447 --> 00:15:55,314
revisit that another time.

365
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:56,715
But what about Nygma?

366
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:58,350
Does he say anything
about my missing friend?

367
00:15:58,386 --> 00:15:59,718
Mm. I don't know,

368
00:15:59,754 --> 00:16:01,453
but I hear Mr. Nygma

369
00:16:01,489 --> 00:16:02,888
talking about

370
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:06,225
special delivery, but nothing

371
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,226
come to the house

372
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:09,461
but bill.

373
00:16:11,565 --> 00:16:13,399
"Stocks & Bondage"?

374
00:16:21,342 --> 00:16:23,242
Mm.

375
00:16:23,277 --> 00:16:25,144
How many times do I have to tell you?

376
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:27,079
I have never...

377
00:16:27,114 --> 00:16:28,747
even heard of this woman.

378
00:16:28,783 --> 00:16:32,017
Well,

379
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:34,019
then I suppose I should

380
00:16:34,055 --> 00:16:35,020
put my attention elsewhere.

381
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:36,588
No, no!

382
00:16:36,624 --> 00:16:37,856
Leave her out of this!

383
00:16:37,892 --> 00:16:38,857
Afraid I can't do that.

384
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:42,327
She is an integral part of your penance.

385
00:16:42,363 --> 00:16:43,495
It was such a pleasant surprise

386
00:16:43,531 --> 00:16:44,663
when I discovered that the two of you

387
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:46,565
were together.

388
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,566
You know,

389
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:49,768
after the initial gag reflex.

390
00:16:51,305 --> 00:16:52,738
You know,

391
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:55,374
I bet this gal doesn't even exist.

392
00:16:55,409 --> 00:16:58,077
I mean, come on. Who would fall in love

393
00:16:58,112 --> 00:16:59,578
with a freak show like you?

394
00:16:59,613 --> 00:17:01,447
Oh, wait.

395
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:03,015
Let me guess.

396
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,484
I bet she's got a certificate, too, huh?

397
00:17:09,757 --> 00:17:10,956
What do you want?

398
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:14,927
Tell me what you want.

399
00:17:16,397 --> 00:17:18,263
Tell me what you want.

400
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,133
I want to break Butch's heart

401
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:23,035
before I end his life.

402
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:26,105
You know, kind of a
eye-for-an-eye thing.

403
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,539
But in this case,

404
00:17:29,477 --> 00:17:31,443
I'll take a hand.

405
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:39,218
Is that vinegar?

406
00:17:39,253 --> 00:17:41,453
Vinegar and baking soda.

407
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:43,021
Takes tarnish off anything.

408
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,358
Selina, that key is
hundreds of years old!

409
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:48,961
I'm not an idiot, you know.

410
00:17:48,996 --> 00:17:51,130
Maybe there's something on the key

411
00:17:51,165 --> 00:17:52,564
that you can't see,

412
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,134
because a hundred years
of crap is covering it up?

413
00:17:57,838 --> 00:18:00,339
Why did you tell Ivy
we weren't a couple?

414
00:18:00,374 --> 00:18:02,174
Why did you tell her we were?

415
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:03,475
Is that a trick question?

416
00:18:04,512 --> 00:18:07,713
Why can't we just be us?

417
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:12,484
Can you take that key out
now? It's making me nervous.

418
00:18:16,624 --> 00:18:18,457
Hmm.

419
00:18:18,492 --> 00:18:20,759
There's an engraving on it.

420
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:24,897
Like a bird or something.

421
00:18:27,735 --> 00:18:29,835
Not just a bird.

422
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,037
An owl.

423
00:18:33,073 --> 00:18:34,339
Uh, and?

424
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,374
Alfred!

425
00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:37,409
If you're right,

426
00:18:37,444 --> 00:18:40,145
merely possessing this
key could be seen as

427
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:41,547
breaking your agreement with
the people that the woman

428
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:42,981
in the owl mask represents.

429
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:44,216
Which is why we need to contact them.

430
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:45,350
They have to understand

431
00:18:45,386 --> 00:18:47,119
Ivy didn't know what she was stealing.

432
00:18:47,154 --> 00:18:48,754
Wait, where is she anyhow?

433
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:55,027
Oh, bloody hell. She's gone.

434
00:18:55,863 --> 00:18:56,962
How did she disable the alarm?

435
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:59,498
Don't worry about that now, all right?

436
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:00,566
What's the big deal? She'll be back

437
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:01,567
when she's hungry.

438
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:08,473
Wayne Manor.

439
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:10,676
You have the necklace.

440
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:12,477
We have your friend.

441
00:19:12,513 --> 00:19:14,413
We'll make exchange, no?

442
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,717
Where and when?

443
00:19:48,295 --> 00:19:49,895
We're supposed to go down the manhole?

444
00:19:50,391 --> 00:19:52,891
That's what they said.

445
00:19:52,927 --> 00:19:54,159
All right, give me the key.

446
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:55,594
I'll sort it out.

447
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,097
No.

448
00:19:58,132 --> 00:19:59,898
I need to speak with them personally.

449
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:01,800
Make sure they understand
this was a mistake.

450
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:04,370
Very well, Master Bruce.

451
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:09,942
There's no way of
asking you to stay here

452
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:11,810
that doesn't end with you
yelling at me, is there?

453
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:13,612
No.

454
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:26,392
Over there.

455
00:20:26,427 --> 00:20:28,127
Ivy?

456
00:20:28,162 --> 00:20:29,495
It's about time!

457
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:39,972
My name is Bruce Wayne.

458
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:42,508
I need to speak with Kathryn.

459
00:20:43,978 --> 00:20:46,945
She needs to understand
I've honored our deal.

460
00:20:46,981 --> 00:20:49,214
Hand over the necklace and
you get your friend back.

461
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,649
That's the deal.

462
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:53,018
You mean the key, don't you?

463
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:55,587
You're not getting it back

464
00:20:55,623 --> 00:20:57,456
until I talk to the people you work for.

465
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:59,858
Maybe we just kill you and take it?

466
00:20:59,894 --> 00:21:01,393
You think we're stupid
enough to bring it with us?

467
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,666
You really want it back?

468
00:21:07,702 --> 00:21:09,635
I'd listen to him.

469
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,671
Put the tools down, lads, aye?

470
00:21:23,384 --> 00:21:24,717
I need reassurances

471
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:26,552
my friends are no longer in any danger.

472
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:30,155
I need to speak to
the woman in the mask.

473
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:34,326
Any assurances that
woman gives you are lies.

474
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:35,694
How do you know?

475
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,795
Because the people

476
00:21:36,831 --> 00:21:38,831
you are talking about have no honor.

477
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:40,899
And they will betray you

478
00:21:40,935 --> 00:21:42,868
as they betrayed us.

479
00:21:42,903 --> 00:21:44,136
Wait. You...

480
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:45,504
you don't work for them?

481
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:48,040
No, we work to destroy them.

482
00:21:50,344 --> 00:21:52,177
Who are they?

483
00:21:52,213 --> 00:21:54,413
They call themselves

484
00:21:54,448 --> 00:21:56,949
the Court of Owls.

485
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:03,689
They're after Mario?

486
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:05,224
Yes.

487
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:07,192
Where is he?

488
00:22:07,228 --> 00:22:09,328
GCPD. He's safe for now.

489
00:22:09,363 --> 00:22:10,829
But I can't help him

490
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:12,831
if you don't tell me what's going on.

491
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:15,334
You think I'm holding something back?

492
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:17,636
A military grade explosion.

493
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:18,837
The clean up.

494
00:22:18,873 --> 00:22:22,007
A sword-wielding assassin
in broad daylight.

495
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:23,909
This doesn't feel like a mob grudge.

496
00:22:23,944 --> 00:22:26,111
What else is there?

497
00:22:26,147 --> 00:22:29,581
Could Mario be mixed up in something?

498
00:22:29,617 --> 00:22:32,584
Is that what you came to ask me?

499
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,253
I'm working the evidence I have.

500
00:22:34,288 --> 00:22:36,555
I understand why you'd want to believe

501
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,858
the man who's marrying Lee
must be mixed up in something.

502
00:22:39,894 --> 00:22:41,860
But my son

503
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:44,696
is the most decent
person I've ever known.

504
00:22:44,732 --> 00:22:46,932
He's not like us.

505
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:52,304
That just tells me there's
something you don't know.

506
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:56,141
Jim, Mario's gone.

507
00:22:56,177 --> 00:22:58,143
You were supposed to keep him there.

508
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:00,712
I know, I tried, but he said
he didn't trust you or the GCPD

509
00:23:00,748 --> 00:23:03,248
to take care of this,
so he was going to.

510
00:23:03,284 --> 00:23:04,516
Whatever the hell that means.

511
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,052
What is it?

512
00:23:07,087 --> 00:23:08,821
Mario just walked out of the GCPD.

513
00:23:08,856 --> 00:23:12,357
I think he's gonna try
to finish this himself.

514
00:23:12,393 --> 00:23:13,525
How?

515
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:15,227
I have a pretty good idea.

516
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:22,301
Can I help you?

517
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:23,569
I hope so.

518
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:26,538
I had something that was
supposed to be delivered to me.

519
00:23:26,574 --> 00:23:28,040
Could you check your records?

520
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,741
Sure. Let me check the safe.

521
00:23:29,777 --> 00:23:31,009
Uh, what was the last name?

522
00:23:31,045 --> 00:23:32,377
- Nygma.
- Oh!

523
00:23:32,413 --> 00:23:34,980
That item was already delivered.

524
00:23:35,015 --> 00:23:36,682
Great.

525
00:23:36,717 --> 00:23:39,585
Well, I guess as long
as I'm already here,

526
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,054
I should pick up
something for the weekend.

527
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:43,388
Right?

528
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:46,992
Hmm.

529
00:23:47,027 --> 00:23:49,061
Well, this looks fun.

530
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,562
Could I ask a favor

531
00:23:50,598 --> 00:23:51,897
- of you...?
- Uh,

532
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:53,565
- Todd.
- Todd.

533
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:55,734
Could you show me how this works?

534
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:59,605
We're not really supposed to...

535
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,241
I won't tell if you don't.

536
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:05,344
It's pretty basic, really.

537
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:06,411
Um, you just...

538
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:09,081
put your arms through here,

539
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,316
and then your head through here.

540
00:24:11,352 --> 00:24:12,784
And you bring it up...

541
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,952
And then... oh! Hey!

542
00:24:13,988 --> 00:24:16,455
Do you like role-play, Todd?

543
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:19,091
Good.

544
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:21,526
I will play the beautiful,

545
00:24:21,562 --> 00:24:23,295
coquettish bank robber

546
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:26,465
who needs to get into
that safe, and you...

547
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,467
get to play

548
00:24:28,502 --> 00:24:31,203
the lucky young shopkeeper
who gives her the combination.

549
00:24:31,238 --> 00:24:33,138
Okay?

550
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:36,241
My friend was taken by this man, Nygma.

551
00:24:36,277 --> 00:24:39,311
I need to know where she is.

552
00:24:39,346 --> 00:24:40,746
If I find her,

553
00:24:40,781 --> 00:24:41,947
I could come back here

554
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:43,949
and personally thank you.

555
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:48,153
Give Mommy...

556
00:24:48,188 --> 00:24:50,255
the combination.

557
00:24:52,593 --> 00:24:55,961
Uh, nine to 25, 72.

558
00:24:55,996 --> 00:24:57,663
Good.

559
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:11,343
Nygma, you sick bastard.

560
00:25:11,378 --> 00:25:12,778
Hey!

561
00:25:12,813 --> 00:25:15,147
Y-You can't just leave me here!

562
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:16,748
H-H-Hello?

563
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:27,626
Oh, goodie.

564
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:29,328
You're finally awake.

565
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:31,129
The show continues.

566
00:25:33,634 --> 00:25:35,634
Ta-da!

567
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:38,937
I designed it myself.

568
00:25:38,973 --> 00:25:40,672
You want to see how it works?

569
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:42,274
Okay!

570
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:44,042
I love a captive audience.

571
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:46,678
So, we'll set the timer for, say...

572
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:48,981
55 seconds.

573
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:50,315
Now, when the timer hits zero,

574
00:25:50,351 --> 00:25:53,285
the spring-loaded blade is released.

575
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,653
Simple.

576
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,088
Now.

577
00:25:56,123 --> 00:25:57,656
For the fun part.

578
00:25:57,691 --> 00:25:59,291
You can stop the blade
from being released

579
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:00,959
if you click this...

580
00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:02,894
little button. But if you do,

581
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,564
it will send a fatal jolt

582
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,400
of electricity to zap Butch.

583
00:26:08,435 --> 00:26:10,969
It's a simple test, really.

584
00:26:11,005 --> 00:26:14,072
Stop the blade from falling

585
00:26:14,108 --> 00:26:16,541
and kill Butch, or...

586
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:24,549
Mm.

587
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:26,852
The choice...

588
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,156
my dear,

589
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:32,758
is yours.

590
00:26:32,793 --> 00:26:35,894
Will we hear the zap of heartbreak?

591
00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:40,565
Or the sound of one hand clapping?

592
00:26:48,453 --> 00:26:50,152
My name is Volk.

593
00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:53,789
My brother, Jacob, and that's Dmitry.

594
00:26:55,226 --> 00:26:57,360
What's with the stupid mask?

595
00:26:58,563 --> 00:26:59,996
I like you.

596
00:27:00,031 --> 00:27:02,498
You remind me of my sister in Kiev.

597
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:05,167
Dmitry is an initiate.

598
00:27:05,203 --> 00:27:06,502
The mask ensures his silence

599
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:08,638
until he proves himself

600
00:27:08,673 --> 00:27:11,274
- and becomes a full member.
- Of what?

601
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:12,441
Who are you?

602
00:27:12,477 --> 00:27:14,810
We are called the Whisper Gang.

603
00:27:14,846 --> 00:27:17,680
Gotham's most notorious smugglers.

604
00:27:17,715 --> 00:27:20,583
We used to number in the
hundreds until the Court saw

605
00:27:20,618 --> 00:27:23,853
our growing strength, and
they offered us a partnership,

606
00:27:23,888 --> 00:27:26,689
only to betray us.

607
00:27:26,724 --> 00:27:29,292
Many escaped back to Ukraine
but a few of us stayed back,

608
00:27:29,327 --> 00:27:30,793
hoping to find a way

609
00:27:30,828 --> 00:27:33,429
to enact revenge.

610
00:27:33,464 --> 00:27:34,997
And we did.

611
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:36,132
The key.

612
00:27:37,268 --> 00:27:39,135
Well, what does it open?

613
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:41,304
A safe.

614
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:45,341
Is is in one of the Court's buildings...

615
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:48,044
here.

616
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,578
Inside, there is a...

617
00:27:49,614 --> 00:27:51,480
a device, that we believe

618
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:53,382
can destroy them.

619
00:27:53,418 --> 00:27:55,751
What, like, some kind of... weapon?

620
00:27:55,787 --> 00:27:58,487
Well, honestly, we don't know.

621
00:27:58,523 --> 00:28:00,089
We captured a member,
but even he didn't know

622
00:28:00,124 --> 00:28:02,825
what's inside the safe, only that

623
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,094
the Court fears it falling

624
00:28:05,129 --> 00:28:06,996
- into the hands of their enemies.
- Wait,

625
00:28:07,031 --> 00:28:08,698
Wouldn't they know you stole it?

626
00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:10,132
They're probably waiting for you

627
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:11,734
- to show up there.
- No.

628
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:14,103
Because originally,
the safe had two keys.

629
00:28:14,138 --> 00:28:15,838
The Court still has one of them,

630
00:28:15,873 --> 00:28:18,040
and the second was thought lost.

631
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:20,042
Until I found it.

632
00:28:20,078 --> 00:28:23,079
You mean we did.

633
00:28:24,148 --> 00:28:27,249
The Court of Owls killed my parents.

634
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:30,353
I stood down because I thought
there was no way to defeat them.

635
00:28:30,388 --> 00:28:33,122
What are you proposing?

636
00:28:33,157 --> 00:28:34,890
If what you're saying is true,

637
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:37,927
and there is something in that safe,

638
00:28:37,962 --> 00:28:41,330
then that's no longer the case.

639
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:53,142
Mario?

640
00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:57,913
You really think this is a good idea?

641
00:28:57,949 --> 00:28:59,582
Using yourself as bait?

642
00:28:59,617 --> 00:29:01,617
If those guys are out
there, Lee isn't safe.

643
00:29:01,652 --> 00:29:03,652
They're pros. You're gonna get killed.

644
00:29:03,688 --> 00:29:05,054
What do you care?

645
00:29:05,089 --> 00:29:06,422
Why would someone want to kill you?

646
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:07,456
I have no idea.

647
00:29:07,492 --> 00:29:08,624
Because it seems to me,

648
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:11,494
an operation like this
doesn't happen for no reason,

649
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:13,829
and putting yourself in the
crosshairs feels a lot like

650
00:29:13,865 --> 00:29:15,331
someone protecting a secret.

651
00:29:15,366 --> 00:29:17,666
I want to protect Lee.

652
00:29:17,702 --> 00:29:19,335
That's it.

653
00:29:22,006 --> 00:29:23,773
We're sitting ducks in here.

654
00:29:23,808 --> 00:29:25,408
We need to get away from bystanders.

655
00:29:27,145 --> 00:29:28,744
- They're here.
- What?

656
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,112
Get down!

657
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,952
No, no!

658
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:40,022
No! No, please!

659
00:29:53,071 --> 00:29:54,303
You could've killed her.

660
00:29:54,338 --> 00:29:55,938
Who sent you?

661
00:29:55,973 --> 00:29:58,474
Why are you coming after me?!

662
00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:01,077
You... know...

663
00:30:01,112 --> 00:30:02,611
why.

664
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,496
Ed, come on.

665
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:23,032
Come on, let's talk about this, huh?

666
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:24,400
Come on, Ed.

667
00:30:24,435 --> 00:30:25,501
You don't have to do this.

668
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,569
Come on, let's talk about this.

669
00:30:26,604 --> 00:30:28,637
Come on! Listen!

670
00:30:28,673 --> 00:30:31,640
I told you, I've never heard
of anyone named Isabelle!

671
00:30:31,676 --> 00:30:33,275
Isabella!

672
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:35,311
Why is that so difficult?

673
00:30:35,346 --> 00:30:37,813
Also, I'm not the one you
should be pleading with.

674
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:39,882
Your life is in her...

675
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:41,350
hand.

676
00:30:42,386 --> 00:30:45,087
What difference does it make?

677
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:46,889
You're gonna kill me one
way or the other, right?

678
00:30:48,459 --> 00:30:50,860
Good point.

679
00:30:50,895 --> 00:30:53,662
New deal.

680
00:30:53,698 --> 00:30:55,498
If she loves you enough
to sacrifice her hand...

681
00:30:55,533 --> 00:30:56,999
Twinsies...

682
00:30:57,034 --> 00:30:58,701
In exchange for your life.

683
00:30:58,736 --> 00:31:00,503
I swear on the memory

684
00:31:00,538 --> 00:31:02,238
of my beloved Isabella,

685
00:31:02,273 --> 00:31:04,673
I will set you both free.

686
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,250
Tabby.

687
00:31:14,285 --> 00:31:16,051
Baby, come on.

688
00:31:20,057 --> 00:31:21,857
We can... get out of here, we can...

689
00:31:21,893 --> 00:31:23,959
I like you, Butch. I really do.

690
00:31:23,995 --> 00:31:26,095
But to be completely honest,

691
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,731
I'm not exactly in a
"love" place right now.

692
00:31:32,069 --> 00:31:34,203
Sorry, big fella.

693
00:31:34,238 --> 00:31:36,338
I wish I could say that I was surprised,

694
00:31:36,374 --> 00:31:39,074
but I knew that she
was going to say that.

695
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,809
It's why I made the offer.

696
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:42,711
Any final words?

697
00:31:42,747 --> 00:31:44,146
I would keep it brief.

698
00:31:47,185 --> 00:31:48,784
Tabby.

699
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:50,886
Baby.

700
00:31:50,922 --> 00:31:53,923
The last few weeks have
been the best of my life.

701
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:58,127
And it's okay you don't love me.

702
00:31:58,162 --> 00:32:02,231
'Cause I love you.

703
00:32:02,266 --> 00:32:06,001
And for a guy like me?
That's... that's enough.

704
00:32:06,037 --> 00:32:07,803
And you.

705
00:32:07,838 --> 00:32:09,438
You're damn right I killed her.

706
00:32:09,473 --> 00:32:12,141
I killed the woman you loved,

707
00:32:12,176 --> 00:32:13,943
You know what she said to me?

708
00:32:13,978 --> 00:32:15,978
Right before I put a
bullet in her brain?

709
00:32:16,013 --> 00:32:18,948
You know what she told
me? She said she wished

710
00:32:18,983 --> 00:32:20,516
she would have been with a real man.

711
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:22,051
Hey, Butch.

712
00:32:22,987 --> 00:32:24,753
Yeah?

713
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:27,423
You're sweet.

714
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:32,528
No!

715
00:32:32,563 --> 00:32:34,330
No!

716
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:44,426
Untie me!

717
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:46,762
Please, untie me! She's
got to get to a hospital!

718
00:32:46,797 --> 00:32:48,230
Quick! Unh!

719
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:50,665
You said that you put
a bullet in her head.

720
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:52,868
Isabella died in a car crash.

721
00:32:52,903 --> 00:32:54,302
The brake lines were cut.

722
00:32:54,338 --> 00:32:56,671
I don't care! I told you
I never heard of her!

723
00:32:56,707 --> 00:32:59,241
You... you really didn't kill her?

724
00:32:59,276 --> 00:33:00,609
No! Untie me!

725
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:02,744
She's got to get to a hospital, come on!

726
00:33:08,752 --> 00:33:10,986
I'd put that hand on some ice.

727
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,664
Neither of you recognize him?

728
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:23,965
No.

729
00:33:25,235 --> 00:33:26,635
Has he said anything?

730
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,503
Not a peep.

731
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:31,473
Hey, I ran your guy's prints.

732
00:33:31,508 --> 00:33:33,441
They're not in the system,
which, considering he's a pro,

733
00:33:33,477 --> 00:33:34,810
wasn't that hard to believe.

734
00:33:34,845 --> 00:33:37,078
Yeah, still, now that we have him,

735
00:33:37,114 --> 00:33:39,414
we should work him, find
out who's behind this.

736
00:33:39,449 --> 00:33:40,916
You better act quick. Call came in.

737
00:33:40,951 --> 00:33:43,552
They're transferring him to
a federal facility upstate.

738
00:33:43,587 --> 00:33:45,987
What? No, no, no, no. We
can't let this guy leave.

739
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:47,756
What can I do? My hands are tied.

740
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:49,624
The Feds want him, they get him.

741
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,992
The question is why?

742
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:53,995
Maybe somebody wants him
out of this precinct.

743
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:56,398
Away from us.

744
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:58,333
I don't know anyone
with that kind of pull.

745
00:33:58,368 --> 00:34:00,202
Do you?

746
00:34:04,975 --> 00:34:06,508
The other assassin.

747
00:34:06,543 --> 00:34:09,211
You want to tell me what
happened in the store?

748
00:34:09,246 --> 00:34:10,879
There's nothing to tell.

749
00:34:10,914 --> 00:34:13,915
He came after me, I did
what I needed to do.

750
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,221
You called her?

751
00:34:21,024 --> 00:34:23,225
She deserves to know what's going on.

752
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,793
Either you tell her or I will.

753
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,135
Come on.

754
00:34:46,116 --> 00:34:49,084
I think I know who sent you.

755
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,420
But I need to know for sure.

756
00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:55,624
And we both know that
you're not going to tell me.

757
00:34:57,027 --> 00:34:58,526
So...

758
00:35:04,868 --> 00:35:07,068
So, how does it feel?

759
00:35:07,104 --> 00:35:10,171
I don't know, maybe I could be captain.

760
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:12,507
Yell at people for not having proof,

761
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:14,242
or, uh, at one of my detectives

762
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,243
for going after a pair of assassins

763
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,612
all by his lonesome.

764
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:18,880
Not bad.

765
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,116
Right? Very interesting play,

766
00:35:21,151 --> 00:35:22,317
by the way.

767
00:35:22,352 --> 00:35:23,318
It's not every day that you get

768
00:35:23,353 --> 00:35:25,987
to save the man who's
marrying the woman you love.

769
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:29,357
Yeah, I'm really something.

770
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,559
It's not too late, Jim.

771
00:35:32,863 --> 00:35:35,263
Lee deserves to know how you feel.

772
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:39,467
God knows I know that life
gives us enough regret.

773
00:35:39,503 --> 00:35:41,069
There's no need adding to it.

774
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,440
- Oh, crap.
- I know it's hard.

775
00:35:45,475 --> 00:35:46,840
It's just, it's something you have to...

776
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:48,451
Falcone.

777
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,890
Falcone, up against the wall!

778
00:36:01,925 --> 00:36:03,091
What are you doing?

779
00:36:03,126 --> 00:36:05,393
Just having a chat.

780
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,028
Turns out our friend here works

781
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,230
for a former associate of mine.

782
00:36:09,266 --> 00:36:11,533
So now that I know who's behind this,

783
00:36:11,568 --> 00:36:14,069
I can take care of it... my way.

784
00:36:14,104 --> 00:36:15,070
It's over.

785
00:36:15,105 --> 00:36:16,237
You think you're gonna walk away?

786
00:36:16,273 --> 00:36:18,573
You just assaulted a
suspect in police custody.

787
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,877
He won't be pressing charges.

788
00:36:22,913 --> 00:36:24,913
I'm gonna find out what happened today.

789
00:36:24,948 --> 00:36:27,449
Who's pulling the strings,
and how Mario's involved.

790
00:36:27,484 --> 00:36:28,650
Trust me.

791
00:36:28,685 --> 00:36:31,987
If I were you, I'd let it go.

792
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,831
Gather the men. Tell them
we are joining forces

793
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:43,965
with the boy.

794
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,433
I will brief them tomorrow night myself.

795
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:46,768
Volk!

796
00:36:46,803 --> 00:36:49,471
Dmitry, eyes.

797
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:09,858
We know you've been
searching for the second key.

798
00:37:11,695 --> 00:37:13,094
Have you found it?

799
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:25,740
I'll ask you again.

800
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:29,244
Have you found the second key?

801
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:32,247
Why don't you ask Dmitry, huh?

802
00:37:51,189 --> 00:37:53,222
Think she'll be okay?

803
00:37:53,258 --> 00:37:54,457
Think they can re-attach the hand?

804
00:37:54,492 --> 00:37:55,758
Please, she's tough as nails.

805
00:37:55,793 --> 00:37:56,726
She'll be fine.

806
00:37:56,761 --> 00:37:58,427
You know this is war, right?

807
00:37:58,463 --> 00:37:59,795
Nygma, Penguin, anyone
who stands with them...

808
00:37:59,831 --> 00:38:01,063
They're all dead.

809
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:02,732
This woman Isabella...

810
00:38:02,767 --> 00:38:04,700
Nygma said she was a librarian, right?

811
00:38:04,736 --> 00:38:07,336
Well, who kills a librarian?
I mean, what's the motive?

812
00:38:07,372 --> 00:38:08,938
I don't know. Maybe someone had

813
00:38:08,973 --> 00:38:11,210
an overdue book, and
things got out of hand.

814
00:38:12,143 --> 00:38:14,710
Excuse me, but you just can't wa...

815
00:38:14,746 --> 00:38:16,946
Come on! Come on!

816
00:38:16,981 --> 00:38:19,115
We got a hand here, people. Hand!

817
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,883
You cut someone's brake lines.

818
00:38:20,918 --> 00:38:23,085
You know where they're going and when.

819
00:38:23,121 --> 00:38:25,421
You'd know...

820
00:38:25,456 --> 00:38:27,623
You know them.

821
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:29,625
I know who did it.

822
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:32,228
I know who killed the librarian.

823
00:38:32,263 --> 00:38:33,896
Who?

824
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:35,331
The same person who's in love with Nygma

825
00:38:35,366 --> 00:38:37,867
- and doesn't want to share him.
- Okay.

826
00:38:37,902 --> 00:38:39,602
One woman in love with
that psychotic bean pole

827
00:38:39,637 --> 00:38:41,070
defies explanation, but two?

828
00:38:41,105 --> 00:38:44,006
Who said anything about a woman?

829
00:38:44,042 --> 00:38:47,610
I am tired of sitting
at the kids' table.

830
00:38:47,645 --> 00:38:51,414
If I'm right, we can have
way more than vengeance.

831
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:53,716
We can have it all.

832
00:38:53,751 --> 00:38:56,352
We don't need to go to war.

833
00:38:56,387 --> 00:38:59,288
All we need to do is start one.

834
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:10,232
There must have been some mistake.

835
00:39:10,268 --> 00:39:12,568
We don't make mistakes.

836
00:39:12,603 --> 00:39:15,104
I've always done whatever
the Court has asked of me.

837
00:39:15,139 --> 00:39:17,506
Even against my own interest.

838
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:20,676
I got you Indian Hill when
Maroni refused to sell.

839
00:39:20,712 --> 00:39:23,346
No one is questioning your loyalty.

840
00:39:23,381 --> 00:39:24,547
If this isn't about me,

841
00:39:24,582 --> 00:39:26,849
Then why are you trying to kill my son?

842
00:39:26,884 --> 00:39:29,752
There are things you're not privy to.

843
00:39:29,787 --> 00:39:31,687
That's not an answer.

844
00:39:31,723 --> 00:39:34,924
It will have to do.

845
00:39:35,926 --> 00:39:36,926
We both know the level

846
00:39:36,961 --> 00:39:39,061
of destruction I can cause.

847
00:39:39,097 --> 00:39:41,697
You think we're scared of you?

848
00:39:41,733 --> 00:39:42,765
The car bomb was designed

849
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,934
to look like a mob hit.

850
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:46,936
You didn't want me to
find out it was you.

851
00:39:46,971 --> 00:39:48,204
I have.

852
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:51,107
I don't care about your reasons.

853
00:39:51,142 --> 00:39:52,308
If my son is harmed in any way,

854
00:39:52,343 --> 00:39:55,378
I will come after you
with everything I have.

855
00:39:55,413 --> 00:39:57,380
You won't win.

856
00:39:57,415 --> 00:39:59,982
If my son is dead,

857
00:40:00,017 --> 00:40:01,684
winning won't be the point.

858
00:40:03,321 --> 00:40:06,055
Gotham will burn.

859
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:09,892
This city is on the brink of chaos.

860
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:13,229
Only we can save it.

861
00:40:13,264 --> 00:40:16,132
We will expect your
assistance when called on.

862
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:18,834
Until then, your son is safe.

863
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,437
At least from us.

864
00:40:21,472 --> 00:40:24,407
What aren't you telling me?

865
00:40:24,442 --> 00:40:27,810
A great many things.

866
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,981
Enjoy your dinner.

867
00:41:01,279 --> 00:41:02,711
Hey.

868
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,120
Is everything okay?

869
00:41:11,155 --> 00:41:14,657
I was on my way to the rehearsal dinner.

870
00:41:14,692 --> 00:41:17,493
Then I heard myself telling
the cab driver your address.

871
00:41:17,528 --> 00:41:19,695
Mario told me everything.

872
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,163
About today.

873
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:23,666
How you risked your own
life to make sure...

874
00:41:23,701 --> 00:41:25,968
I didn't do it for him.

875
00:41:26,003 --> 00:41:29,338
I know.

876
00:41:29,373 --> 00:41:31,140
He's a good man.

877
00:41:31,175 --> 00:41:32,641
Uh-huh.

878
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:37,546
Tell me.

879
00:41:37,582 --> 00:41:39,482
What?

880
00:41:39,517 --> 00:41:41,817
What you have to tell me.

881
00:41:45,823 --> 00:41:49,692
I missed my chance to give
you the life you deserve.

882
00:41:49,727 --> 00:41:51,894
To make you happy.

883
00:41:53,531 --> 00:41:57,266
But I do want that for you.

884
00:41:57,301 --> 00:41:59,235
More than anything.

885
00:42:02,773 --> 00:42:05,007
Why does it feel like
we keep saying good-bye?

886
00:42:08,045 --> 00:42:10,913
Maybe it's all we have left.

887
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:14,083
Or we just haven't done it properly yet.

888
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:24,927
Good-bye, James Gordon.

889
00:42:43,915 --> 00:42:45,014
Yo, Peeping Tom

890
00:42:46,517 --> 00:42:48,584
You lost?

891
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:51,153
Lucky for you, we sell directions.

892
00:42:53,057 --> 00:42:56,725
The price... everything you've got.

893
00:42:56,761 --> 00:42:58,727
She loves him. She loves him.

894
00:42:58,763 --> 00:43:00,362
- She loves him...
- You deaf?

895
00:43:00,398 --> 00:43:02,464
She loves him, she loves him!

896
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,166
I said...

897
00:43:04,201 --> 00:43:05,968
Hey, man...

898
00:43:07,605 --> 00:43:11,206
She... loves... me!

899
00:43:11,242 --> 00:43:13,008
And I won't let her go.

900
00:43:13,811 --> 00:43:14,843
She...

901
00:43:14,879 --> 00:43:18,781
loves... me!
