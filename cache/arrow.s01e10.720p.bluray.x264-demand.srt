WOMAN <i>[ON TV]: Eyewitnesses contend
that numerous lives would have been lost...</i>

457
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,006
<i>...if not for the timely intervention
of the vigilante.</i>

458
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,362
<i>But these were not the actions
of a vigilante.</i>

459
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,885
<i>What's been described
are the actions of a hero.</i>

460
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,201
What's got you all smiley?
Your new club's a briquette.

461
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,081
It was under construction before.
Now it's just more under construction.

462
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,208
MOIRA:
Good morning.

463
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,283
Sharp suit, Mom.

464
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,523
Not used to seeing you without
your bedroom wrapped around you.

465
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,963
Well, I could hardly go
to the office in my pajamas.

466
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,608
I'm taking Walter's position at the office.

467
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,040
- What changed your mind?
- Not what. Who.

468
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,007
My daughter.

469
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,769
My family.

470
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,724
And I promise you,
Walter will get back to us.

471
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,850
I will keep looking for him
and I will find him.

472
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,691
- And I'll see you for dinner.
OLIVER: Mm-hm.

473
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,761
- What?
- Just feeling the whiplash.

474
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,447
She went from shut-in
to chairman pretty fast.

475
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,166
- Sounds like you got through to her.
- Yeah, I guess.

476
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,363
It'll just be for a few months.
My mom, she's taking it so hard.

477
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,046
Whatever you have to do
to take care of your family.

478
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,721
Before I forget.

479
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,286
My brother's badge.

480
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:08,485
My mom was hoping maybe you could
find a way to get it to, you know, him.

481
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,001
As a thank-you.
I don't care what anyone has to say.

482
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,689
He really is a guardian angel.

483
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,200
I'll find a way to get it to him.

484
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,286
I'm gonna miss you.

485
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,850
Yeah.

486
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,531
- Hi.
- Hey.

487
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,206
- You look after yourself, all right?
- I will.

488
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,930
Good.

489
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,003
So Joanna's taking
a leave of absence, huh?

490
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,167
- She has to go be with her family.
- Yeah, well, family's important.

491
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,929
- I already apologized.
-It's my turn.

492
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,409
After what happened last night...

493
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,484
...maybe it's a good thing
you got the hood involved.

494
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,681
He didn't take
the phone off you, did he?

495
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,571
Maybe you should hold onto this.

496
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,569
I mean, I may not like the guy's methods,
but whoever this guy is...

497
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,850
...he's got a habit of putting himself
between danger and you.

498
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,241
And that's not something
I can argue with.

499
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,004
Besides,
I shouldn't have this thing anyway.

500
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,731
Kelton, are we good?

501
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,641
I got a strong signal from the crystal
VHF transmitter you hid in the speaker.

502
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,730
- It can't be back-traced.
- Talk to me like a third grader.

503
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,042
Next time your daughter calls
the vigilante...

504
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,248
...we'll be able to listen to every word.

505
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,646
I know you swore
to bring this guy down, detective...

506
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,691
...but using your own daughter as bait,
that's stone cold.

507

508
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,210
Good thing the fire didn't spread
to down here.

509
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,168
It's one of the benefits of concrete
and steel construction.

510
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,767
Thank you.

511
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,531
- What for?
- You know what for.

512
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,922
- So, what's next? More training?
- No.

513
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,282
We go hunting.
