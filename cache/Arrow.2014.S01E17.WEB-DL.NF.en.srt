I'll move to Coast City.

464
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:59,634
That's very sweet,
but your club just opened.

465
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:04,556
-And your work is here.
-Don't worry about me.

466
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:09,352
-It's my responsibility to worry about you.
-Just stop, okay?

467
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,939
Listen, you know how I feel about you.

468
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:20,196
Please don't make this harder
than it already is.

469
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,118
Okay.

470
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,038
Okay. It's, uh...

471
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,208
It's whatever you need.

472
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,049
[SIGHS]

473
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:49,434
-Cleaning out your desk?
-No. A friend's.

474
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,060
Um...

475
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,979
You asked to see me?

476
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,357
Take a seat.

477
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,040
I'm ready to listen now.

478
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,172
Thank you.

479
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,013
TOMMY:
Hey.

480
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:33,102
I, uh, heard about McKenna. You okay?

481
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,314
Not really.

482
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:41,319
Look, I know
that I have been a jerk lately.

483
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:47,492
I just couldn't understand how you could
keep such a huge secret from me.

484
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:51,996
But I never considered the toll
it must take on you.

485
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:58,253
Lying to the people
that are closest to me.

486
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,839
It's the hardest part.

487
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,633
I get that.

488
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,885
[SIGHS]

489
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:12,559
I was wrong
to think that I could have it both ways...

490
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,395
...that I can do what I do...

491
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,607
...and still have a normal life.

492
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,654
-With anyone.
-Except if you're alone...

493
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,698
...you're never gonna be happy.

494
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,869
Maybe not.

495
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:37,250
But me being happy
isn't what's important right now.

496
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,923
Your plan. Your call.

497
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,097
Fyers.

498
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,685
Mr. Queen, I thought
I might be hearing from you.

499
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:57,478
We have the circuit board.

500
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:00,607
You are making a grave mistake.

501
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:04,027
<i>My men are scouring the island for you
as we speak.</i>

502
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:07,655
And when they find you,
they will kill you.

503
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,449
Very slowly, I'm afraid.

504
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,286
If your men kill us,
you'll never find the circuit board.

505
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:18,958
<i>After that, we both know all you'll be left with
is a really ugly piece of modern art.</i>

506
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,295
Then what do you propose?

507
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,841
-A trade.
FYERS: <i>I see.</i>

508
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:29,510
<i>And what do you want in exchange?</i>

509
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,768
I want a way off the island.
