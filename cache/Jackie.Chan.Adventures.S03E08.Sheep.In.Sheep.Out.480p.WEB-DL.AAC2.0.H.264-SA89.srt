1
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:06,872
Jackie: Traveling
through Scotland

2
00:00:06,874 --> 00:00:09,141
is like walking
in pea soup.

3
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:10,676
How can you
think of food

4
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:13,212
when the forces
of darkness
are near?

5
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:15,280
I meant
it is difficult

6
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:17,683
to see in this fog,
uncle.

7
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,685
Fog not important!

8
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:22,321
Locator spell is.

9
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:24,323
The enchanted moth
is drawn

10
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:26,525
to enchanted wool.

11
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:29,528
Its light leads us
through the fog

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,697
toward the power
of the sheep.

13
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:32,898
Ha ha ha!
But we are heading

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,166
toward the lake.

15
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:36,168
I do not think
that the loch ness monster

16
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,670
is one of the animals
of the Chinese zodiac.

17
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:40,639
(Gasps)

18
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,307
What is that?

19
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:48,614
Loch ness monster!

20
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,669
(Gasps)

21
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,039
Jackie: Jade?

22
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,440
Hey, Jackie. Uncle.

23
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,608
You are supposed

24
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,809
to be at
the bed and breakfast,

25
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,744
where there
is no daolon wong,

26
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,480
no dark chi warriors--

27
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:55,881
no cable.

28
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:06,825
Jade: Whoa.

29
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,694
Whole lotta lamb.

30
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,635
We must seek
the most noble

31
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,303
of the beasts.

32
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,507
Baa, baa, black sheep,

33
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,175
have you any magic?

34
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,245
Eh...Next.

35
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:29,414
One down, 199 to go.

36
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,750
Jade: don't start countin'
sheep yet, Jackie,

37
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:34,186
'cause I see one
woolly bully.

38
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,292
We found it?

39
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:41,927
Tsk! We?

40
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,262
Quiet!

41
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:45,664
Startling the beast
may activate its power

42
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,799
of astral projection.

43
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,134
Finn: Evenin', chan.

44
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:52,271
I'll have
the roast lamb.

45
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:55,407
(Gasps)
Dark chi warriors!

46
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,289
Wow.

47
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,490
Dude fainted.

48
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:14,193
The sheep released
its astral form!

49
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,561
Hyah!

50
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,799
Hee-yah!

51
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,467
Ohh!
(Laughs)

52
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:23,902
You've been fleeced!

53
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,541
Uncle: Jade...

54
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,976
Uncle
must borrow this.

55
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,611
Uh, you're welcome?

56
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,823
Uncle needs this.

57
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:45,891
My belt?

58
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:46,959
Ohh!

59
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,600
Ohh. Like a--uhh!--

60
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:57,069
baby elephant! Ohh.

61
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,242
(Gasps) Oh, no!

62
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,443
The loch ness monster!

63
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:05,510
Where?!
Where?!

64
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,247
Phthht!

65
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,381
Made ya look!

66
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:11,049
She--uhh!

67
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,385
Whoa. Ohh--uhh!

68
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,354
Ohh, ohh!

69
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:16,622
Time-out.

70
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,790
Yo, yo. Careful
with lambchop.

71
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,259
If we mess this one up,

72
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,860
wong will have our hides.

73
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,362
No kiddin'.

74
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:25,097
Last time I brought him
the wrong tea,

75
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,732
he turned me
into an ottoman.

76
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:27,933
Daolon wong: Minions!

77
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,402
Have you claimed
my talisman power?

78
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:31,603
Wrapped in wool
and ready

79
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,605
for winter,
d-master.

80
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,040
Uh, it's
just hard to lift

81
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,208
when it's sleepin'.

82
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,044
It is not sleeping,
you fools!

83
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:42,147
It has released
its astral form!

84
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,017
Uhh!

85
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,520
Ohh!

86
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,390
Heads up.

87
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,793
Aah!

88
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:55,994
Uhh!

89
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,496
The sheep!

90
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,400
Mine!
Mine!
Mine!

91
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:02,868
Ohh!
Ohh!
Ohh!

92
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,247
Big d!
Hiya!

93
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:18,116
Uh, we're pumped
for round 2.

94
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,484
Daolon wong:
I have no further use

95
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,086
for those
who allow themselves

96
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:24,856
to be waylaid by
unconscious livestock!

97
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,124
So...

98
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,359
We're free to go?

99
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,801
Uh, when
the wongmeister said

100
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:37,769
he had no
further use for us,

101
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,105
you think
he meant today?

102
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:42,240
Or forever?

103
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:47,713
Ohh! Why are we leaving
the sheep here, uncle?

104
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:49,681
Sheep not important.

105
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,850
Astral form is.

106
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:55,220
That is where
the power lies.

107
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:56,855
So we just wait here

108
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,657
for Casper
the friendly ram
to trot home.

109
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,858
No.

110
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,160
We must find
its astral form

111
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,363
before daolon wong does.

112
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:06,131
How will we find
an astral sheep

113
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,033
if we cannot see it?

114
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,235
With proper eyewear.

115
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,239
(Reciting incantation)

116
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,383
Awaken from shadow.

117
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:26,818
Serve your new master.

118
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,561
Take this...

119
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,634
And bring
the astral sheep to me.

120
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,440
Cool specs!

121
00:06:48,442 --> 00:06:50,409
They're better than 3-d.

122
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,210
Ohhh.

123
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,612
They are 4-d, Jade,

124
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,380
and they
are not a toy.

125
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:58,350
If I were
an astral sheep,
where would I go?

126
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,485
Lookin' for
some astral turf?

127
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,154
Hot-cha!

128
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,626
Sheep flies
this way!

129
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,965
(Man snoring)

130
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,907
Sheep has entered
Shepherd's head.

131
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,241
Why would
a sheep do that?

132
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,943
To drop in on a dream.

133
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,779
I was
astral once, remember?

134
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,781
We must
maintain contact.

135
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:34,453
(Reciting incantation)

136
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,123
Whoa, uncle!

137
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,225
Your spells keep
getting more awesome!

138
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:43,028
Must keep up with
forces of darkness.

139
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:50,936
Tasty grub you're
serving here, laddie,

140
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,939
though it's
not as filling
as the real McCoy.

141
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,307
Say,

142
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:58,143
what's this I hear
about shaving me
in winter?

143
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,978
Talking sheep?

144
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,379
Cool!

145
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,153
Uh-oh.

146
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,991
Jade: Shadowkhan.

147
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,260
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!

148
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,566
All: Aah!

149
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,669
What's happening?

150
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,373
Who invited ninjas?

151
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,609
Aah!

152
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,530
(Gasps) The cube
of tang shan!

153
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,965
It absorbs astral forms.

154
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,467
The shadowkhan
are working

155
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:56,868
for daolon wong?

156
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,003
Larry, moe, and curly

157
00:08:58,005 --> 00:08:59,604
must be
on spring break.

158
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:02,908
I am needed.

159
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,242
I'll cover you. Wha--

160
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,911
too dangerous.

161
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,078
Grrr!

162
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,654
Eh, you wouldn't hit
a guy wearing glasses,

163
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:16,721
would you?

164
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,301
Grrr.

165
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,678
Now we are
even Steven.

166
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,088
The astral form did
not return to its body.

167
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,923
Poor fella's probably scared.

168
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,525
What do we
do now, uncle,

169
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:56,261
lead it back with
an astral sheepdog?

170
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,097
We talk sheep.

171
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,933
Ohh. No exit.

172
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,269
And
no magazines.

173
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,937
Maybe the wong-man's
just tryin'

174
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,105
to make a point.

175
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,940
I bet he calls us
back any minute.

176
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,375
Yo!

177
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,612
We're waiting!

178
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,547
Wanna play
charades?

179
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,520
Well?

180
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,860
Ohh! Why is good help
so hard to find?

181
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,631
Jade will lure
the astral sheep

182
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:33,965
to her dream

183
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,568
so that she may
communicate with it.

184
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,504
Uncle, even if
the sheep returns,

185
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:41,740
the shadowkhan
may be right behind.

186
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,074
You're right, Jackie.

187
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,242
Why don't <i> I</i> mix it up

188
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,677
with the legions
of darkness

189
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,312
while <i> you</i> get
some shuteye?

190
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,280
You are the first
line of defense,

191
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,649
and, failing that,

192
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,118
shadowkhan cannot
physically penetrate

193
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,687
a tae ho han circle

194
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,490
as long as
Jade sleeps.

195
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,591
Ohhh.

196
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:00,992
Time to count sheep.

197
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,763
(Snoring quietly)

198
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,201
Jade as sheep: Baa! Baa!

199
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,939
(Snoring)

200
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,111
Uncle!

201
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,514
(Clicks tongue)

202
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,983
I haven't
seen you before.

203
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:27,152
I'm baaab.

204
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,720
I'm Jade,

205
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:30,355
and I'm not from
around here.

206
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:33,158
Yaa! The old wolf
in sheep's clothing ruse!

207
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,359
'Cept I'm no wolf.

208
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,827
You have
to trust me, baaab.

209
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:36,895
You're in danger,

210
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:38,163
and the only way
I can help is

211
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,732
if you get back
to your body, asap.

212
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,634
Now, where's
the fun in that?

213
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:44,302
I like flying about.

214
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:45,503
You won't be flying for long

215
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,639
if those guys in black pjs
get a hold of you.

216
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:49,841
I'll explain everything
on the way to section 13,

217
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,876
where you can
mingle with other
exceptional animals

218
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,078
like yourself.

219
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,381
This section 13
is like a club?

220
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,316
A very elite club.

221
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,718
12 members only.

222
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,200
I thought the shadowkhan
couldn't penetrate
your circle!

223
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:16,901
They have entered
Jade's dream

224
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,737
through
the shadow realm.

225
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:20,438
We must wake her.
Uhh!

226
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,675
Uncle, I can't
penetrate your circle!

227
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:24,743
Uh...

228
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,412
Might I request
bagpipes be played

229
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,681
at our dream funeral,
Lassie?

230
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,486
Oh, no! The
loch ness monster!

231
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,606
Didn't think
that thing existed.

232
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,541
It does in my dream.
Now, hurry!

233
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:57,876
We'll meet you back
at your body

234
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:59,511
in 2 shakes
of a lamb's tail!

235
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,215
Let's move.

236
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,957
Ahh.

237
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,295
Come on, uncle!

238
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,431
(Wheezing)
You two run.

239
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,700
Uncle
- will power walk.

240
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,172
(Gasps) Ohh!

241
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,642
(Chants)

242
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,077
The power
of astral projection

243
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,046
now belongs to me.

244
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,487
Tsk! That didn't
hurt one bit!

245
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,823
Hee-yah!

246
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:48,259
Ha ha ha!

247
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,163
Jade, get back here!

248
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,998
We must return
to our--ohh!

249
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,204
Uhh!
Uhh!

250
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:00,505
A little finishing spell

251
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,707
to seal
your human forms

252
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,810
makes both of you
as good as ghosts.

253
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:08,847
Ha ha ha!

254
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:21,693
Jackie!

255
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,294
No sleeping!

256
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,831
No "ow"?

257
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,534
Uncle,
we're right here!

258
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,170
Hello? He can't
see or hear you.

259
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:34,305
Then how will he know
where we are?

260
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,709
(Gasps)

261
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,978
Daolon wong now
possesses the power

262
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,145
of astral projection,

263
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,348
which he has inflicted
upon Jackie and Jade

264
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,416
and then applied
a finishing spell

265
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:49,153
so that they cannot
return to their bodies!

266
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,290
And you doubted him.

267
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,762
Returning astral forms
to your bodies

268
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:01,599
will be
very complicated.

269
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:07,138
(Reciting incantation)

270
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,919
Ohh.

271
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,754
It worked?!

272
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,522
Jade's voice:
Uncle, you rock!

273
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:25,757
Now let's find
daolon wong

274
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,192
and kick
some shriveled--aah!

275
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:29,727
Jade's voice:
Why are there 2 of me?

276
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,296
Jackie's voice:
W-why is your voice

277
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,864
coming out of my body?!

278
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,034
Aah!
Aah!

279
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,771
I told you
spell complicated.

280
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,206
Jackie's voice:
Uncle, you returned
our astral forms

281
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,474
to the wrong bodies!

282
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:44,943
You must
switch us back!

283
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,411
No time.

284
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:48,046
With the power
of the sheep,

285
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:50,114
daolon wong
can travel
the astral plane

286
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,816
and easily seek
the location

287
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,785
of the other
talisman powers.

288
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,386
Jade's voice: Hyah!

289
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:56,821
Hyah!

290
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,825
Jade's voice:
I'm ok with this.

291
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,229
The moth indicates

292
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:09,033
that the sheep's power
lies in there.

293
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,839
Jackie's voice: There
is only one way inside.

294
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,078
Jackie's voice:
Ohhh. Uhh!

295
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,482
Jackie's voice: Eh.
I forgot who I wasn't.

296
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,551
Jade's voice: Tryin'
to do this, Jackie?

297
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,823
Jade's voice: Cool, huh?

298
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,658
Jade is better
at being you

299
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,426
than you, Jackie.

300
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,761
Jackie's voice: Ohhh.

301
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,370
Jade's voice: Yoga?

302
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,108
Daolon
is in a trance.

303
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,843
Jade's voice: The better
to turn his lights out!

304
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,679
No! His astral form
wanders,

305
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,448
but the sheep's
is trapped within.

306
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,617
I must free
its astral form

307
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:02,887
before daolon wong's
returns.

308
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,155
(Blowing)

309
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,690
Jackie's voice: Jade,
how do you keep these

310
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,291
out of your eyes?

311
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,531
Jade's voice:
Uh-oh.

312
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:18,403
Jackie's voice:
Stay back, Jade.

313
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:19,837
Jade's voice:
Yes, <i> Jade,</i>

314
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,206
maybe you <i> should</i>
stay back.

315
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,941
Jackie's voice: Uh...

316
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,410
Ok,

317
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:27,412
but I am giving
you permission

318
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:30,248
to defend us--(Blows)--
This one time only.

319
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,683
Jade's voice:
I'm gonna do you proud.

320
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,452
Hee-yah!

321
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,761
(Reciting incantation)

322
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,934
Jade's voice: Oohh.

323
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:52,804
Jackie's voice:
Ooh, I'm going
to feel that tomorrow.

324
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,793
Jade's voice: Ooh!

325
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:17,495
Now I know
why he does that.

326
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:23,935
Jade's voice: Who da man?

327
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,269
<i>I</i> da man!

328
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:26,304
Wha--

329
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:28,840
heh. You wouldn't
hit a little girl?

330
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,777
Jackie's voice:
Tsk. When in Jade,

331
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,278
do like Jade.

332
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,013
Hee-yah!

333
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,991
Jade's voice: Cool!

334
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,060
Jackie's voice: Jade,
do not try that at home.

335
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,330
Jackie's voice:
Bad day, bad day, bad day!

336
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,532
(Chanting)

337
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,469
Jackie's voice,
gasping: Oh, no!

338
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,872
The loch ness monster!

339
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,307
Jade's voice:
Nightie night, ninjas.

340
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,682
Jackie's voice:
What do you know?

341
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:12,817
I made them look.

342
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,852
(Chanting)

343
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,089
Baa!

344
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,727
The sheep
has been released.

345
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,934
Phthht!

346
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,036
Huh? (Gasps)

347
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:42,280
Jackie's voice: But,
uncle, what about him?

348
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,015
Uhh!

349
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,050
Daolon wong
is not the only one

350
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,452
with recipe
for finishing spell.

351
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,223
Grrr.

352
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,958
Shadowkhan--pah!

353
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,360
Gan! Ren! Chui!

354
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,363
Big d! Dude, I knew
you'd take us back!

355
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,365
Did you lose weight?
Looks good!

356
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,201
You should
apologize to us.

357
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,669
I will pulverize you

358
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,204
if you do not assist me

359
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,973
in reversing the old man's
finishing spell!

360
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,241
Apology accepted.
Works for me.

361
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:11,375
Mm-hmm.

362
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,045
Jade's voice:
So, uncle,

363
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,680
can I keep the skin
a while longer?

364
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:18,082
If Jackie agrees
to do your homework

365
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:19,417
in the meantime.

366
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:20,952
Jade's voice:
Please, Jackie?!

367
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,822
Jackie's voice:
Eh, no, Jade,
you cannot.

368
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,924
Jade's voice: Ohh!

369
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:36,067
Hey, Jackie? What's
your favorite dessert?

370
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,569
Ice cream
with tiramisu.

371
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,737
I eat everything.

372
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,339
I eat all junk food.

373
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,873
Ice cream, tiramisu,

374
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:43,908
ice cream, tiramisu.

375
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,043
But, most important,
exercise.

376
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:49,580
Exercise--you can
beat all the calories,
all the bad food.
