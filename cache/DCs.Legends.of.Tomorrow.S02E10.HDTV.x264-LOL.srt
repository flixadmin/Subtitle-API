1
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:05,335
My name is Damien Darhk.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,064
In 2016, I was murdered
by the Green Arrow.

3
00:00:09,066 --> 00:00:12,303
But I was removed from the
timeline 31 years before

4
00:00:12,328 --> 00:00:16,177
my death by a speedster from
the future named Eobard Thawne.

5
00:00:16,202 --> 00:00:17,868
Together, with Malcolm Merlyn,

6
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,075
a former head of the
League of Assassins,

7
00:00:20,077 --> 00:00:23,445
the three of us are going to
locate the Spear of Destiny;

8
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:27,115
a mystical object which
can rewrite reality itself.

9
00:00:27,117 --> 00:00:28,750
With the Spear in our possession,

10
00:00:28,752 --> 00:00:31,586
we will change our past and our future.

11
00:00:31,588 --> 00:00:34,756
And the world as you know it.

12
00:00:34,758 --> 00:00:36,792
Previously on “Legends of Tomorrow”...

13
00:00:36,794 --> 00:00:38,627
A deep scan reveals that Captain Hunter's

14
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:40,696
neural architecture
has been reprogrammed

15
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:41,930
with a new identity.

16
00:00:41,932 --> 00:00:43,711
The Longinus Medallion.

17
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,437
Rip!

18
00:00:47,462 --> 00:00:49,738
I know that you're one of the protectors

19
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,507
of the Spear of Destiny
and I know that you know

20
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:53,976
where the other pieces are hidden.

21
00:00:53,978 --> 00:00:55,911
You're gonna torture me, aren't you?

22
00:00:55,913 --> 00:00:57,646
I'm not gonna torture you.

23
00:00:57,648 --> 00:00:59,781
They are.

24
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,358
Damien Darhk, the man behind
tonight's siege of Star City,

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,226
was killed by the masked vigilante

26
00:01:11,228 --> 00:01:12,995
known as the Green Arrow.

27
00:01:12,997 --> 00:01:15,697
Amateur cell phone video
captured his final moments,

28
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:19,001
putting an end to the chaos
that has gripped the city.

29
00:01:39,256 --> 00:01:41,890
This is the great Malcolm Merlyn?

30
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:43,325
I am unimpressed.

31
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:45,027
Well, he's fallen on hard times.

32
00:01:45,029 --> 00:01:49,525
But this man used to be Ra's al Ghul.

33
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,344
Uh, we haven't met. I'm Eobard Thawne.

34
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:55,447
I'm... from the future.

35
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,149
What the hell is going on here?

36
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,451
Excellent question. Here's another...

37
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,620
Do you believe in second chances?

38
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,722
I just watched you die.

39
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:06,392
Yeah, I hear 2016's not my best year,

40
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:08,394
but I plan on fixing that.

41
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:10,529
But the question for you, Malcolm, is:

42
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:14,733
Do you wish to see your
fortunes similarly reversed?

43
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:16,235
By time travel?

44
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:18,771
No. No.

45
00:02:18,773 --> 00:02:21,173
Something much better.

46
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,142

47
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:42,561
- Well?
- No luck. So far.

48
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:44,430
It's not that Captain
Hunter's uncooperative.

49
00:02:44,432 --> 00:02:48,267
It's that he's not fully in
possession of his marbles.

50
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:51,337
So he won't tell us where the
rest of the Spear of Destiny is?

51
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:53,105
Uh, it's more like... can't.

52
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:54,940
Which wouldn't be such a problem

53
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:58,344
if you two idiots hadn't
lost the Longinus Medallion.

54
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:00,679
I seem to remember
you being there as well.

55
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,681
Until you weren't.

56
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:05,451
I hate when he does that.

57
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:07,386
If you have something
to say to me, Malcolm,

58
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,455
I suggest you keep it to yourself.

59
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,023
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,591
Am I supposed to be afraid of you?

61
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:15,461
Oh, I would be.
Considering I can kill you

62
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:17,463
before you even knew I was doing it.

63
00:03:17,465 --> 00:03:18,764
Ah, yes.

64
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:21,166
But then you wouldn't get what you want.

65
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:24,636
You brought me and Damien into
your little quest for a reason.

66
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:26,171
Without the Medallion,

67
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:29,008
Hunter is our only way to
get the rest of the Spear.

68
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,010
You need me to get it out of him.

69
00:03:31,012 --> 00:03:32,678
We already tried torture.

70
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,413
I'm not talking about torture.

71
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:36,515
I'm talking about hypnosis.

72
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:38,350
Regression therapy.

73
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,156
Hunter's mind is locked away.

74
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,059
I've got the key.

75
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,897
Is this some technique you picked up

76
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,799
with the League of Assassins?

77
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:56,635
The League didn't call me
“the Magician” for nothing.

78
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,303
Well, be quick about it.

79
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:02,908
Speedsters aren't
known for their patience.

80
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,344
What's to keep Hunter's crew from finding

81
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:06,678
the rest of the Spear

82
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,946
before Merlyn finishes

83
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,715
unscrambling Hunter's brain?

84
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:11,183
The workings of the Medallion

85
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:13,185
are lost to history.

86
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:15,587
Trying to get it to reveal its
secrets will prove difficult.

87
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,424
Plus, we have an additional
advantage over them.

88
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:20,793
Enlighten me.

89
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:22,094
They're idiots.

90
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,762
- You're all idiots.
- Excuse me?

91
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,364
Pot, meet kettle...

92
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:26,598
Yeah, Mick. Given your glass house,

93
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,695
you shouldn't throw stones.

94
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,868
Mixing metaphors isn't
going to solve anything.

95
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,900
How about instead of bickering,

96
00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:32,571
we figure out our next
move against the speedster

97
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:33,649
and his allies.

98
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,274
“Legion of Doom”
has a sexier ring to it.

99
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:37,076
I'm not calling them that.

100
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:39,611
And we need to figure
out a way to rescue Rip.

101
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,214
All you gotta do is trade
the Amulet, or the Medallion,

102
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:44,483
for the Englishman. It's really simple.

103
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,285
The only thing is, I
don't know how it works.

104
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,387
Hmm. You're an idiot.

105
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,589
You want to put an artifact
that can rewrite reality

106
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,758
into the hands of the
enemy and we're the idiots?

107
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,226
- Mm-hmm.
- Our priority has to be

108
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:55,928
identifying this speedster.

109
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,564
Of course you'd say
that. I mean, he is the one

110
00:04:58,566 --> 00:04:59,832
that killed your boyfriend, so...

111
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:00,902
He's at the center of this,

112
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,601
and you can't defeat an
enemy that you don't know.

113
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:03,869
Look, Amaya's right.

114
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,904
And I hate to say it, but so is Mick.

115
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,707
- I'm not an idiot.
- Not about being idiots.

116
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,143
About using the Medallion as leverage.

117
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:13,345
But first, we need to
figure out how it works.

118
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:15,147
Well, in my defense,
it's a mystical object.

119
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:16,882
It doesn't come with
a set of instructions.

120
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:18,984
Maybe's that been the
problem, approaching it

121
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,753
from a mystical vantage instead
of leaning into our strengths,

122
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,021
- which are...
- Technological.

123
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,656
Exactly. And as it happens,

124
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,059
I have a colleague in
Central City whose knowledge

125
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:29,795
might prove to be advantageous.

126
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:33,232
Gideon, set a course
for Central City, 2017.

127
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:34,900
Jax, stick with Martin.

128
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:37,736
And let's work on putting
a name to our speedster.

129
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:41,673
Aww, here comes a man

130
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,442
who looks like he just struck out.

131
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:45,177
Don't get smug with me, Damien.

132
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,112
I may not have all my prior resources,

133
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,947
but at least I'm not dead.

134
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,482
Look, I couldn't get Hunter to remember

135
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:54,119
because his memories aren't
buried or locked away.

136
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,454
They're gone.

137
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:58,457
It's like his old self didn't exist.

138
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,092
Are you sure about that?

139
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:01,360
Do you think you can do any better?

140
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:02,661
You are welcome to try.

141
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:03,929
We already tried torture.

142
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:05,731
You know what I love about torture?

143
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,666
I'm not sure if you have
enough time for me to list

144
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,601
all the reasons, but mainly it's because

145
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:12,337
there's always another gear to find.

146
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:19,545
This is what I get for relying
on a washout and a dead man.

147
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,713
I don't like that guy.

148
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,218
Hmm, you know.

149
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,053
I'll be honest.

150
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:31,356
Which I have to admit, I
don't have much practice in.

151
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:33,992
I don't like this situation.

152
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,061
Not one bit.

153
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:39,364
For one thing, Mr. Thawne
has this habit of treating me

154
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,166
like a henchman.

155
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:43,969
And do you know what all
henchmen have in common,

156
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:47,072
Captain Hunter?

157
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,840
No thoughts on this one?

158
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,909
The thing that all
henchmen have in common

159
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,612
is that they all end up dead.

160
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:57,716
A fate that I am
fastidiously trying to avoid.

161
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,952
Maybe it's that I just
hate taking orders.

162
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:01,353
Or being threatened.

163
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:03,689
You don't like being threatened, do you?

164
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:05,891
Hm? What's that?

165
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,660
Oh, sorry.

166
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,562
Oh, God. No.

167
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:11,930
Yeah, neither do I.

168
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,166
Which is why I need your cooperation.

169
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:18,003
To end Mr. Thawne's tedious threats.

170
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,072
Look, I... I don't know anything.

171
00:07:20,074 --> 00:07:22,708
- I swear.
- Shhh!

172
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,743
I can't take your word for it.

173
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,211
But don't worry.

174
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:31,116
I will start you off
with an easy question.

175
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,685
Right eye or left eye?

176
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,921
No, please. Please, don't.

177
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:38,156
I'll do anything, I'll...
I'll tell you anything

178
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,658
you want to know. Even
if I don't know it!

179
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,593
- Please, don't!
- Shh.

180
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,629
Second question.

181
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:46,798
When was the last time you
had any dental work done?

182
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,135
What? No, no, God.

183
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,711
It may not be in the best
condition, but then again,

184
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,313
Captain Hunter is British.

185
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,315
You pulled out his tooth?

186
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:06,118
As torture goes, isn't
that kind of bush league?

187
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,919
Look closer.

188
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,554
Thank you, but no.

189
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:18,997
There're some markings
on here, like a barcode.

190
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,433
Account information.
From a security deposit box

191
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:23,068
in Switzerland.

192
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,337
Who puts that kind of
information on a tooth?

193
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,772
A Time Master.

194
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:28,407
That's no ordinary security box.

195
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:29,941
My thinking exactly.

196
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,710
Now, it's possible the box could contain

197
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,545
his son's birth certificate
and the like, but...

198
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:36,048
Given the exotic nature of the
care that's been taken here,

199
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,317
I would have to assume...
- It's the rest of the Spear.

200
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:39,985
When was it last accessed?

201
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,920
January 2025.

202
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:46,525
Oh, you got somewhere to go?

203
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,727
Funny, just like clockwork...

204
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:52,397
Take the Time Sphere back to 2025

205
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,533
and secure the rest of the Spear.

206
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:55,967
The next one of you who screws up

207
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:59,204
will lose more than just a tooth.

208
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:03,975
Well, I'd hate to see you
lose another hand, Malcolm.

209
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,352
Seriously, Grey?

210
00:09:13,354 --> 00:09:16,655
I know you didn't bring me
to 2017 just so we could get

211
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:18,056
lattes and frappuccinos, man.

212
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,391
Of course not.

213
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:21,293
Just my colleague merely frequents

214
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:22,661
this establishment at this hour.

215
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,930
Sorry, Jefferson.

216
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:26,131
You should go back to the Waverider.

217
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,499
I can handle things from here.

218
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:29,468
What the hell is going on with you, man?

219
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,902
Dad?

220
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,738
I didn't know you were coming to town?

221
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,172
Dad?

222
00:09:34,197 --> 00:09:35,793
Well, I... I wanted to surprise you.

223
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:36,775
Oh.

224
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,810
Wait. Your colleague
is your daughter?

225
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,212
Lily, this is my friend Jefferson.

226
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:42,581
Jefferson, this is my daughter.

227
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,982
Nice to meet you.

228
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,717
Hey.

229
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,153
- Should we, uh, sit down?
- Yeah.

230
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:51,189
This is... So weird.

231
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:55,160
Uh, because I didn't think
I'd get the chance to meet you.

232
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:58,029
Like, ever. But, uh, here we are.

233
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:01,266
I was explaining to Jefferson
how you might be able

234
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,001
to assist us with the, um...

235
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,803
Research project.

236
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:06,805
Uh, sort of like Indiana Jones.

237
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,975
Yeah, sort of.

238
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:13,979
You brought it to a coffee shop?

239
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,748
Oh, well, for one thing.

240
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,985
It's throwing off low
levels of ionic radiation

241
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,154
Is that an ionic transmographer?

242
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:24,222
I've never seen one
smaller than a house!

243
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,291
Yeah, I had an idea
for hyperminiaturization

244
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,726
when I was in Tahiti.

245
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:30,462
I don't vacation well.

246
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:36,067
You know, I'm thinking a
shortwave ionic pulse might...

247
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,138
Whoa!

248
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,408
Hey.

249
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,311
Perhaps we should, uh, take
our little research project

250
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:50,048
somewhere a bit more private...

251
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,419
A temporal navigation vessel.

252
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:57,289
I... I absolutely cannot believe it.

253
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,557
Um, hello, who are you?

254
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,091
Oh, hi. Hi, I'm Lily.

255
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,593
I'm... I'm Martin's daughter.

256
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:03,228
We didn't know Martin had a daughter.

257
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,030
Yeah, you told me
you didn't have kids.

258
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:07,432
Well, I like to keep my
private life... private.

259
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,134
There's private, and there's lying.

260
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,335
Sara, do you know about this?

261
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:14,406
Oh, I know all about this.

262
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:18,844
What are you doing?

263
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,479
Trying to make up my mind.

264
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:22,781
I mean, Eobard has
such a delicious selection

265
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,149
of killing devices.

266
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,684
We can't just storm into the bank

267
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,519
and demand to see the deposit box.

268
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,054
We absolutely can.

269
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:30,755
We're former members of
the League of Assassins.

270
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:33,024
This operation requires subtlety.

271
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,759
Not a bloodbath.

272
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,395
Well, I... I'm sorry. I'm
not up on current events,

273
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:40,131
But might this squeamishness
that I'm witnessing

274
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,867
be the cause of your downfall?

275
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,335
Hunter is an asset.

276
00:11:43,337 --> 00:11:46,137
One that we can use to gain
access to our objective.

277
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,373
To not use him is foolish.

278
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,375
Oh. Well, in that case,

279
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,044
I would have to defer to
your superior expertise

280
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,247
in foolishness.

281
00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:58,717
But if your plan goes south,
it's not our speedster friend

282
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,152
you need to worry about.

283
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,654
One thing I hate more

284
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:06,157
than taking orders from him...

285
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,826
is being threatened by you.

286
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:18,336
Luckily, Damien...

287
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,771
I don't find you threatening.

288
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:34,336
What's the big deal?

289
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:37,123
The professor didn't
have a kid, now he does.

290
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,157
Mazel tov.

291
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,039
Thank you.

292
00:12:39,064 --> 00:12:41,894
The big deal is Lily
is a Time Aberration,

293
00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:43,929
which was all well and good,

294
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:47,833
until you plucked her out of
2016 and showed her a timeship,

295
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:50,970
which could cause more aberrations.

296
00:12:50,972 --> 00:12:52,338
Hey, what you looking at me for?

297
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,639
Because you were with him.

298
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:55,608
I quite simply missed my daughter.

299
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,410
If Lily's presence
on the Waverider posed

300
00:12:57,412 --> 00:12:59,311
any temporal issues, I'm sure Gideon

301
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:00,913
would have detected them.

302
00:13:00,915 --> 00:13:03,682
Plus, Grey said Lily
could hook the Medallion

303
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:05,351
up with Gideon, so...

304
00:13:05,353 --> 00:13:07,319
Wait, she wants to try
networking an ancient amulet

305
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:08,788
with an advanced AI system?

306
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:11,624
I'm totally helping.

307
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:14,060
Fine. Then I would
appreciate it if you...

308
00:13:14,062 --> 00:13:18,230
If none of you would reveal to
her that she's an Aberration.

309
00:13:18,232 --> 00:13:19,512
Why you looking at me?

310
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:21,801
So where are we on
identifying the speedster?

311
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:23,869
I think the technical term is nowhere.

312
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:25,304
All the speedsters the Flash faced

313
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:27,239
are either dead or his friends.

314
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:29,875
Or people he thought were
his friends and are now dead.

315
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:32,144
Okay, we will figure this
out. And in the meantime,

316
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:34,346
you and Lily keep working
with the amulet to figure out

317
00:13:34,348 --> 00:13:36,415
to figure out where the
rest of the Spear is.

318
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:40,286
Who's to say he won't kill us anyway?

319
00:13:40,288 --> 00:13:44,790
Even after we've gotten
his precious spear?

320
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:46,859
Oh, forget it. Why am I asking you?

321
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:48,794
I don't know, man.
I don't know anything.

322
00:13:48,796 --> 00:13:50,763
I don't even know why you're
getting me to wear this...

323
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:53,265
This... this... this...
This monkey suit.

324
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:55,101
And my mouth is so sore.

325
00:13:55,103 --> 00:13:57,136
Quit whining.

326
00:13:57,138 --> 00:13:58,437
The fact of the matter is,

327
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:00,606
we have something in common, Rip.

328
00:14:00,608 --> 00:14:01,640
My name is Phil.

329
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:03,008
Whatever.

330
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,844
We are both dealing with
unstable individuals.

331
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:07,947
And that is not something I enjoy.

332
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:10,916
Hey, this is not exactly a
walk in the park for me, either.

333
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:13,385
Which is why

334
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:17,723
you will do exactly as I say.

335
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:20,259
And maybe, just maybe,

336
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:22,495
you will make it through this alive.

337
00:14:22,497 --> 00:14:24,430
Cool. Right.

338
00:14:24,432 --> 00:14:27,600
Um, what... what is
it you want me to do?

339
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:30,302
Tell me, Phil. Have you ever been

340
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:31,670
to Switzerland?

341
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:43,749
Put this in your ear.

342
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:44,850
What is it?

343
00:14:44,852 --> 00:14:46,051
Communication device.

344
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,254
Really? It's so small...

345
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:50,289
Do it, or I'll shove
it down your throat.

346
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,324
It will allow us to monitor you.

347
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:54,059
This is very simple.

348
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,428
You go to the bank
associate and you tell them

349
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,098
you want to access security box 4587.

350
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,666
4587, right.

351
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:02,434
Um, what... What do I do then?

352
00:15:02,436 --> 00:15:04,003
Bring the contents
of said box back to us.

353
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:05,538
If you don't, you'll be killed.

354
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,739
Really?

355
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:08,207
What? I'm motivating him.

356
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:09,475
In and out.

357
00:15:09,477 --> 00:15:10,609
Take no longer than five minutes.

358
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:12,311
You will be fine.

359
00:15:12,313 --> 00:15:14,213
I'll be fine.

360
00:15:14,215 --> 00:15:16,048
I'll be fine. Okay.

361
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,385
This would be easier if
we just killed everybody.

362
00:15:21,656 --> 00:15:23,155
Hi, how are you?

363
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:27,493
I'd like box 4587, please.

364
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:29,028
Well, sure, have a seat.

365
00:15:31,132 --> 00:15:32,898
What do you think's going on with him?

366
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,935
It's simple. His mind is pudding.

367
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:37,937
Not Hunter. Thawne.

368
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:40,639
It's strange how he never stays
in one place for very long...

369
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:43,442
Perhaps that's why they
refer to them as speedsters.

370
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:46,879
What, you think he left us
behind in 1967, Los Angeles,

371
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:49,515
because he had a more
pressing engagement?

372
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:51,283
What about what he said to us earlier?

373
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:52,885
That he wanted to kill one of us?

374
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:55,554
No. That he didn't know
why he was relying on us.

375
00:15:55,556 --> 00:15:57,189
I mean, fair question.

376
00:15:57,191 --> 00:15:58,557
Why does a time traveling speedster

377
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,759
need to rely on anyone?

378
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:03,162
Thawne's hiding something.

379
00:16:03,164 --> 00:16:04,830
Wouldn't you like to know what it is?

380
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:09,335
Thawne said we knew
each other back in 2016.

381
00:16:09,337 --> 00:16:11,003
Do I really become so stupid

382
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:12,739
that you think these mind
tricks will work on me?

383
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,988
I am not trying to...

384
00:16:14,013 --> 00:16:16,342
In a trio such as ours,
turning one against each other

385
00:16:16,344 --> 00:16:19,011
for your own benefit is not
only obvious, but cliché.

386
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:21,647
Thawne does not treat
us as equals to him.

387
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:25,384
And until he does, neither of
us is getting what he wants.

388
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:29,555
All right. Let's go over this again.

389
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:31,423
I already been over it, Sara.

390
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:32,725
Mm-hmm, again and again.

391
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:34,159
And again.

392
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,562
We're obviously dealing
with a new player.

393
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:38,364
Whoever this speedster
is, it's someone you

394
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:40,065
and your friends haven't
encountered before.

395
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:42,034
Which means the
speedster's from the future,

396
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:44,770
which makes sense, because
speedsters can time travel.

397
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:47,172
Then would the speedster
need the Spear of Destiny for?

398
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:49,408
He could just go back and
change history himself.

399
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,776
But not reality.

400
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:52,678
That's why he needs the Spear.

401
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,681
Question is, what is the
speedster trying to change?

402
00:16:57,385 --> 00:16:59,051
Or fix?

403
00:16:59,053 --> 00:17:01,020
That's the question.

404
00:17:01,022 --> 00:17:03,088
He knows what we want to do
with the Spear of Destiny,

405
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,257
but he's being very coy about his plans.

406
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:17,770
Very well, Mr. Hunter.

407
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:20,639
Please lean towards
the panel, if you would.

408
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:22,141
Excuse me?

409
00:17:22,143 --> 00:17:23,509
A retinal scan.

410
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:25,544
- Rectal scanner?
- What?

411
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:28,514
It's an eye scan. Part
of the bank's security.

412
00:17:28,516 --> 00:17:29,581
You know,

413
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,949
this whole situation sucks,

414
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:33,585
but man, I love being in the future.

415
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:36,855
- What?
- What?

416
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:39,458
Retinal scan. Right.

417
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:45,998
Oh.

418
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:52,438
Why, uh... Why is it not working?

419
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,806
Voice ID is next.

420
00:17:53,808 --> 00:17:56,809
You need to speak your access code.

421
00:17:56,811 --> 00:17:58,110
Access code.

422
00:17:58,112 --> 00:17:59,345
Oh, boy.

423
00:17:59,347 --> 00:18:01,146
Oh, boy.

424
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:04,116
Yes, so, the one you set
when you opened your account.

425
00:18:04,118 --> 00:18:05,250
Uh...

426
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,952
Get out of there now.

427
00:18:06,954 --> 00:18:08,454
Yeah.

428
00:18:08,456 --> 00:18:12,725
No, don't.

429
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:14,560
Go. Move.

430
00:18:14,562 --> 00:18:16,995
Don't.

431
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:18,328
This was your plan.

432
00:18:18,353 --> 00:18:20,232
Which I am trying to execute.

433
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:22,835
And failing spectacularly, per usual.

434
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:25,838
Look, we can't just
let them call security.

435
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,406
I am calling security.

436
00:18:27,408 --> 00:18:29,174
Great idea. Security, no, that's...

437
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:30,809
Security is awesome.

438
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:37,649
You aren't planning on going
rogue on us, now, were you, Rip?

439
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:40,586
I have told you. My name is Phil.

440
00:18:40,588 --> 00:18:42,287
All right, Phil. It
was lovely knowing you.

441
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,489
Don't! We still need him.

442
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:45,023
He's useless to us.

443
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:46,525
Hey, I can be more useful.

444
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,647
Ah, damn it.

445
00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:49,795
Security is gonna be on
top of us at any moment.

446
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:51,964
Might I suggest you kill them instead?

447
00:18:51,966 --> 00:18:53,899
Try and run, and I will find you

448
00:18:53,901 --> 00:18:55,968
and feed you your testicles.

449
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,903
Okay.

450
00:18:57,905 --> 00:18:59,505
Oh, my God.

451
00:19:02,777 --> 00:19:03,809
Ahh!

452
00:19:03,811 --> 00:19:05,744
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

453
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:19,691
Reinforcements are on their way.

454
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:22,528
Let's get the hell out of here.

455
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:40,503
Okay, that should just about do it.

456
00:19:40,505 --> 00:19:42,372
And now we just have
to activate the Medallion

457
00:19:42,374 --> 00:19:44,374
and see if Gideon can access its data.

458
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:47,010
Okay.

459
00:19:47,012 --> 00:19:51,080
So what are we waiting for?

460
00:19:51,082 --> 00:19:53,283
Nothing, it... It's just if...

461
00:19:53,285 --> 00:19:55,852
If we've underestimated the size
of the artifact's data stream...

462
00:19:55,854 --> 00:19:58,054
We'll fry the ship's
CPU and we'll all spend

463
00:19:58,056 --> 00:20:00,323
the rest of our lives
stranded in the Temporal Zone.

464
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,349
The ship's CPU has a name.

465
00:20:02,374 --> 00:20:03,350
Sorry, Gideon.

466
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,462
Can we at least talk about
this before you connect...

467
00:20:09,468 --> 00:20:11,801
Gideon?

468
00:20:11,803 --> 00:20:13,536
You still there?

469
00:20:13,538 --> 00:20:15,705
Oh, my God, we killed her.

470
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:18,308
Artificial intelligences
cannot, by definition,

471
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,770
be killed, Dr. Palmer.

472
00:20:19,795 --> 00:20:20,639
Yes, I know.

473
00:20:20,664 --> 00:20:23,012
It's pretty remarkable
considering we just mainlined

474
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:25,782
1.2 zettabytes directly into her brain.

475
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:26,615
Yeah.

476
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,219
I'm processing the Medallion's
temporal output as we speak.

477
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:33,753
- Nice work, doctor.
- Doctor!

478
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:36,392
You don't happen to have any
champagne on this ship, do you?

479
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,896
Hey.

480
00:20:39,898 --> 00:20:43,366
Ah, 1998 Blanc de Noir.

481
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,502
I like beer.

482
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:47,670
Gets me drunk.

483
00:20:50,108 --> 00:20:52,208
To Lily.

484
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,143
To Gideon.

485
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,849
Wow.

486
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:00,984
That tastes real.

487
00:21:00,986 --> 00:21:02,285
It's completely synthetic.

488
00:21:02,287 --> 00:21:04,387
The food fabricator can make anything.

489
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:06,155
Except American Cheese,

490
00:21:06,157 --> 00:21:08,358
which is pretty much
synthetic to being with.

491
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,792
Beluga caviar?

492
00:21:09,794 --> 00:21:11,895
Fake food never tasted so good.

493
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:13,830
Fake food for a fake person.

494
00:21:17,202 --> 00:21:18,801
What did you say?

495
00:21:18,803 --> 00:21:20,778
Uh, no. He didn't say anything.

496
00:21:22,107 --> 00:21:24,574
Everyone has been looking
at me weird ever since

497
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:27,020
I came on board this ship.

498
00:21:27,045 --> 00:21:28,945
What are you not telling me?

499
00:21:30,048 --> 00:21:31,514
Cat's out of the bag, Haircut.

500
00:21:31,516 --> 00:21:32,749
You may as well tell her.

501
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,384
Tell me what?

502
00:21:34,386 --> 00:21:37,420
Tell me what?

503
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:40,690
Sweetheart, I don't
wanna rain on your parade,

504
00:21:40,692 --> 00:21:42,492
but you're a, uh...

505
00:21:42,494 --> 00:21:44,994
How would the Professor put it?

506
00:21:44,996 --> 00:21:47,230
An abrasion... No, that's not it, um...

507
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:49,532
An asphyxiation, hmm...

508
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:51,167
Aber... Aberration!

509
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:55,672
You're a Time Aberration.
You're a Time Aberration.

510
00:21:55,674 --> 00:21:58,274
Ray?

511
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:00,877
What is a Time Aberration?

512
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:04,213
Um, I think maybe you
should talk to your dad.

513
00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:12,488
Perhaps we could all just
talk about what went wrong.

514
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,057
- Shh!
- Oh, I know what went wrong.

515
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:15,725
I listened to him.

516
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:17,703
If you'd have listened to
me, we would have walked out

517
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:19,307
of that bank instead
of being chased out.

518
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:22,332
Either way, we came out empty-handed.

519
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:24,367
I seem to remember Eobard mentioning

520
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:26,402
how he was going to punish your failure.

521
00:22:26,404 --> 00:22:28,304
If anyone's a failure, it's you.

522
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:30,940
You were the one who learned
about Hunter's secret account,

523
00:22:30,942 --> 00:22:34,644
yet seem not to know about a passcode.

524
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,112
Sloppy, Damien.

525
00:22:36,114 --> 00:22:37,814
No wonder they passed
you over for Ra's...

526
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,983
You see, this is where he reminds me

527
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:41,584
that he was Ra's al Ghul.

528
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:43,753
Poor Malcolm. Always living in the past.

529
00:22:43,755 --> 00:22:47,090
This is when I remind
you about your future.

530
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:49,626
Aww, that's right.

531
00:22:49,628 --> 00:22:51,260
I've been there.

532
00:22:51,262 --> 00:22:52,729
I've seen how pathetic you are.

533
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:54,697
In this future that you're from,

534
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:58,701
do I at least have two hands?

535
00:22:58,703 --> 00:23:02,639
Either way, I intend to change
my future, but look at you now.

536
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:04,474
You're pathetic. I don't even know

537
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:06,442
why Thawne recruited
you in the first place.

538
00:23:06,444 --> 00:23:07,844
We could argue all night, Damien,

539
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:10,146
but I don't want to bore our guest here

540
00:23:10,148 --> 00:23:14,751
with your impotent
insults and recriminations.

541
00:23:14,753 --> 00:23:16,619
What are you suggesting?

542
00:23:16,621 --> 00:23:18,688
Do you recall how we resolved
disputes within the League?

543
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,289
Mm-hmm.

544
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:21,257
Now...

545
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,794
I suggest you choose a blade

546
00:23:24,796 --> 00:23:27,296
that matches that sharp tongue of yours.

547
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:29,966
Excuse me for a second.

548
00:23:29,968 --> 00:23:31,534
Gladly.

549
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:35,171
You did it, my darling!

550
00:23:35,173 --> 00:23:37,640
You created an interface
between a mystical relic

551
00:23:37,642 --> 00:23:41,411
from the first century and
a 22nd century supercomputer.

552
00:23:41,413 --> 00:23:43,346
Only a Stein could be so brilliant!

553
00:23:43,348 --> 00:23:46,149
What is a Time Aberration?

554
00:23:46,151 --> 00:23:47,383
I'm sorry, what?

555
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:50,720
You heard me, Dad.

556
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:53,990
An Aberration... Is
an unnatural alteration

557
00:23:53,992 --> 00:23:56,893
of history as a result of time travel.

558
00:23:56,895 --> 00:24:01,564
Dad? Am I...

559
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:03,332
Am I an Aberration?

560
00:24:03,334 --> 00:24:07,503
That word could never
describe who you are

561
00:24:07,505 --> 00:24:09,806
or how much you mean to me.

562
00:24:09,808 --> 00:24:11,808
- So it's true?
- Please let me explain.

563
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:16,012
That's why you were acting so weird

564
00:24:16,014 --> 00:24:18,247
when you visited Central
City the first time.

565
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,817
The reason you were
treating me like a stranger...

566
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:22,952
Was because you didn't
even exist the last time

567
00:24:22,954 --> 00:24:25,822
I boarded this ship
and... And left 2016.

568
00:24:25,824 --> 00:24:28,691
But now you do exist and
that's all that matters.

569
00:24:28,693 --> 00:24:30,460
How could this be happening?

570
00:24:30,462 --> 00:24:32,662
But it's... it's... It's
really quite simple.

571
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:37,066
You see, I interacted with
my younger self back in 1987.

572
00:24:37,068 --> 00:24:40,236
And who then interacted with
your mother's former self.

573
00:24:40,238 --> 00:24:41,938
And, and...

574
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,840
When two former selves
love each other...

575
00:24:43,842 --> 00:24:46,042
Okay, Dad. We've already
had the birds and bees talk.

576
00:24:46,044 --> 00:24:49,178
I was ten. Or did we?

577
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,214
That's a very interesting point.

578
00:24:51,216 --> 00:24:54,584
I... I mean, who is to say
which of our realities is real

579
00:24:54,586 --> 00:24:56,819
and which one is aberrant?

580
00:24:56,821 --> 00:24:58,788
It's really a matter of perspective.

581
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,423
Actually, it's quite fascinating.

582
00:25:00,425 --> 00:25:03,459
This is not fascinating, Dad!

583
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,895
This is a nightmare.

584
00:25:05,897 --> 00:25:07,597
Oh, Lily, I'm so sorry.

585
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,599
This is not how I
wanted you to find out.

586
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:12,268
No. No, I get it.

587
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,870
You didn't want kids

588
00:25:13,872 --> 00:25:18,775
when you first came
on board this timeship.

589
00:25:18,777 --> 00:25:23,079
And now you have me.

590
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,434
You just reminded me of something.

591
00:25:45,436 --> 00:25:46,636
Which is?

592
00:25:46,638 --> 00:25:48,838
How much I've missed this.

593
00:26:13,298 --> 00:26:16,299
Okay, stop, stop! Time out, time out!

594
00:26:16,301 --> 00:26:18,668
Can't you see that this
is what your boss wants?

595
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:21,304
For his underlings to be
at one another's throats.

596
00:26:21,306 --> 00:26:23,606
Like, literally.

597
00:26:23,608 --> 00:26:24,807
He is not our boss.

598
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:25,908
Did he call us underlings?

599
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,243
Oh, I'm sorry.

600
00:26:27,245 --> 00:26:30,847
Uh... Henchmen.

601
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:32,215
Try again.

602
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:33,349
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

603
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:34,383
What if he's right?

604
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:35,685
You actually care

605
00:26:35,687 --> 00:26:37,320
what this pudding-brained
hippie has to say?

606
00:26:37,322 --> 00:26:38,721
It's just like the movie

607
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:40,323
“The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly”

608
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:41,457
Three bad guys.

609
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:43,059
No one knows who to trust.

610
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:45,127
So they all end up
screwing each other over.

611
00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:47,063
It's an interesting theory.

612
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:48,698
Which one are we?

613
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,666
The point is that neither
of you are Clint Eastwood

614
00:26:50,668 --> 00:26:53,769
and so neither of you end
up going home with the gold.

615
00:26:53,771 --> 00:26:55,371
We're not after the gold.

616
00:26:55,373 --> 00:26:56,405
Yeah, I know, I know.

617
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:57,840
I know what you're after.

618
00:26:57,842 --> 00:27:00,476
You... You wanna change your past.

619
00:27:00,478 --> 00:27:03,312
And you... You wanna change your future.

620
00:27:03,314 --> 00:27:05,014
And, uh, the fast guy is the only one

621
00:27:05,016 --> 00:27:09,185
who could make those
two things, uh, happen.

622
00:27:09,187 --> 00:27:10,753
I told you.

623
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:12,488
Thawne doesn't treat us as equals.

624
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,323
Even the hippie knows it.

625
00:27:14,325 --> 00:27:16,525
And he also knows that
the only way to stop Thawne

626
00:27:16,527 --> 00:27:20,830
from screwing us over is
for us to work together.

627
00:27:20,832 --> 00:27:23,833
Two former members of
the League of Assassins

628
00:27:23,835 --> 00:27:25,501
versus a speedster.

629
00:27:27,505 --> 00:27:29,164
I am liking those odds.

630
00:27:39,142 --> 00:27:41,843
Dude, what is going on with you?

631
00:27:41,845 --> 00:27:44,079
What do you mean?
And don't call me dude.

632
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:46,081
I've gotten used to
sharing a brain with you.

633
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:48,416
But, this, whatever this is.

634
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:49,818
This is something new.

635
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:53,354
Just enjoying a cup of Earl Grey.

636
00:27:53,356 --> 00:27:54,689
Is that whiskey?

637
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:56,558
Of course it's not whiskey.

638
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,726
It's brandy. What do you
take me for, a sailor?

639
00:27:58,728 --> 00:28:01,930
Okay. Let's start this over, hmm?

640
00:28:03,166 --> 00:28:05,066
Come on.

641
00:28:05,068 --> 00:28:09,337
Fine.

642
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:11,225
I made a terrible mistake.

643
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:14,642
I should never have brought
Lily on board this ship.

644
00:28:14,644 --> 00:28:17,846
She found out.

645
00:28:17,848 --> 00:28:19,714
She knows she's an Aberration.

646
00:28:19,716 --> 00:28:23,485
Mr. Rory spilled the
beans, as predicted.

647
00:28:26,423 --> 00:28:29,858
So what you gonna do?

648
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,593
What can I do?

649
00:28:31,595 --> 00:28:32,794
Just tell her how you feel.

650
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:34,095
She knows how I feel.

651
00:28:34,097 --> 00:28:35,330
It goes without saying.

652
00:28:35,332 --> 00:28:37,332
Yeah, for us, it does.

653
00:28:37,334 --> 00:28:39,968
We have a psychic
connection, but for her?

654
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:44,372
She just hears whatever comes
out of that big brain of yours.

655
00:28:44,374 --> 00:28:46,407
Just tell her you love her.

656
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:47,842
That's what dads do.

657
00:28:47,844 --> 00:28:50,078
Clearly, you never met my father.

658
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:55,183
You know, the...

659
00:28:55,185 --> 00:28:57,886
The reason Clarissa and I
chose not to have children

660
00:28:57,888 --> 00:29:01,322
the first time around was because...

661
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:03,892
I feared that history
would repeat itself,

662
00:29:03,894 --> 00:29:05,693
that I would be

663
00:29:05,695 --> 00:29:08,062
the kind of father that he was.

664
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:13,801
We're legends, Grey.

665
00:29:13,803 --> 00:29:15,403
Changing history is what we do.

666
00:29:24,738 --> 00:29:27,010
Why would a speedster
need to change reality?

667
00:29:27,035 --> 00:29:29,951
Ohh. How many times are
you gonna ask that question?

668
00:29:29,953 --> 00:29:32,287
Until we have an answer.

669
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:34,489
She's right. Speedsters can time travel.

670
00:29:34,491 --> 00:29:36,791
So what's stopping him
from changing history

671
00:29:36,793 --> 00:29:38,760
even without the Spear?

672
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:44,499
Unless he doesn't exist.

673
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:46,167
Okay, so what, he's a ghost?

674
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:47,368
What if he's a Temporal Aberration?

675
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,870
- Just like...
- Excuse me.

676
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:50,181
Have any of you seen my daughter?

677
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,506
- One second, Professor.
- I'm sorry!

678
00:29:51,508 --> 00:29:52,674
This is quite urgent.

679
00:29:52,676 --> 00:29:54,175
Look, what if instead of

680
00:29:54,177 --> 00:29:56,110
creating a person
like you did with Lily,

681
00:29:56,112 --> 00:29:58,880
our mystery speedster
erased himself from history?

682
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:00,381
Why would he want to do that?

683
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:02,016
I don't know, but it would explain

684
00:30:02,018 --> 00:30:04,619
why we don't have any
evidence of his existence.

685
00:30:04,621 --> 00:30:08,623
Okay, so, we just need to
ID someone who doesn't exist?

686
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:10,959
Eobard Thawne.

687
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:12,660
Um, is... Is he okay?

688
00:30:12,662 --> 00:30:14,896
I'm fine. Eobard Thawne is a name.

689
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:17,966
The name of a speedster who...

690
00:30:17,968 --> 00:30:18,967
Who what?

691
00:30:21,271 --> 00:30:24,405
Thawne was erased from
existence when his progenitor,

692
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:27,642
Eddie Thawne, committed
suicide in order to stop him.

693
00:30:27,644 --> 00:30:29,444
Which would explain why

694
00:30:29,446 --> 00:30:31,512
the Time Masters didn't
have a file on him.

695
00:30:31,514 --> 00:30:33,214
But if Thawne doesn't exist, then how?

696
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,250
He was protected from
his ancestor's death

697
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:37,051
because he was a member
of the Speed Force.

698
00:30:37,053 --> 00:30:39,954
It's a little complicated.

699
00:30:39,956 --> 00:30:42,757
A little?

700
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:49,430
Oh, and for the record,

701
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:51,833
this is how I wanted to approach
things in the first place.

702
00:30:51,835 --> 00:30:54,102
Only because you enjoy
killing a lot of people.

703
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:55,503
As if you don't.

704
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:00,832
Hmm.

705
00:31:00,857 --> 00:31:02,944
All right, that's pretty
impressive, Malcolm.

706
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:04,557
But how did you get Hunter's passcode?

707
00:31:04,582 --> 00:31:05,947
It's not Hunter's.

708
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:08,650
It's the bank manager's
security override code.

709
00:31:08,652 --> 00:31:10,551
It only cost him three fingers.

710
00:31:15,392 --> 00:31:17,358
Uh, yes!

711
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,459
Ow!

712
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:21,729
Oh, God.

713
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,836
Going somewhere?

714
00:31:28,838 --> 00:31:29,704
No.

715
00:31:31,508 --> 00:31:33,107
Yes.

716
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:34,942
What do you expect me to do?

717
00:31:34,944 --> 00:31:38,780
Your partners just left
me here all tied up.

718
00:31:38,782 --> 00:31:40,982
Where are they?

719
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:43,851
They... told me...

720
00:31:43,853 --> 00:31:45,586
Not to tell you.

721
00:31:47,057 --> 00:31:48,823
The bank. They're...
They're at the bank.

722
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:50,825
Look, you could help yourself

723
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:54,228
to... to whatever is in that
safe deposit box, but please...

724
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,897
Please, just... Just let me go, man.

725
00:31:55,899 --> 00:31:57,065
Let me go.

726
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:14,716
Does this look like a spear to you?

727
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,753
It most certainly does not.

728
00:32:18,755 --> 00:32:20,355
It's a mnemonic archive.

729
00:32:20,357 --> 00:32:22,423
I'm sorry, are we supposed
to know what that means?

730
00:32:22,425 --> 00:32:24,726
Since it won't be
invented for a century, no.

731
00:32:24,728 --> 00:32:27,161
This device is designed
to store memories.

732
00:32:27,163 --> 00:32:28,896
Rip Hunter's, I'd assume.

733
00:32:30,734 --> 00:32:32,367
Guys, I think I just figured it out.

734
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:34,669
Why a seemingly invincible speedster

735
00:32:34,671 --> 00:32:36,270
would need to take on partners.

736
00:32:36,272 --> 00:32:38,239
By all means, Dr. Heywood,
please enlighten us.

737
00:32:38,241 --> 00:32:40,875
Okay. What if Thawne
isn't just chasing us?

738
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:42,944
What if he's running from something?

739
00:32:42,946 --> 00:32:44,579
But running from what?

740
00:32:44,581 --> 00:32:45,813
Time.

741
00:32:45,815 --> 00:32:47,582
Time takes time to harden.

742
00:32:47,584 --> 00:32:49,350
And if Thawne ceased to exist the moment

743
00:32:49,352 --> 00:32:50,752
his great-great-whatever
killed himself,

744
00:32:50,754 --> 00:32:53,955
then, maybe, he has to keep moving

745
00:32:53,957 --> 00:32:55,790
in order for his own nonexistence

746
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:58,960
not to catch up with him. Poo!

747
00:32:58,962 --> 00:33:01,529
That doesn't even begin
to make any kind of sense.

748
00:33:01,531 --> 00:33:03,698
I don't know, it could work.

749
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,200
Professor, what do you think?

750
00:33:06,202 --> 00:33:07,468
Per the scientific method,

751
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,437
there's only one way to prove it.

752
00:33:09,439 --> 00:33:13,207
You'd have to trap Thawne in one
place and then see what happens.

753
00:33:16,146 --> 00:33:17,879
What do you think you're doing?

754
00:33:17,881 --> 00:33:20,348
Renegotiating the
terms of our partnership.

755
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,950
And it is going to be a partnership.

756
00:33:22,952 --> 00:33:24,752
We need a bit more of a guarantee

757
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:27,555
that you're going to uphold
your end of our bargain.

758
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,127
I'll guarantee you one thing.

759
00:33:33,129 --> 00:33:35,329
If you don't open that door,

760
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:37,665
I'll kill you.

761
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:41,903
Yes, but I'm the only one
who knows the code to open it.

762
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:46,574
Perhaps you can persuade
our friend to cooperate?

763
00:33:46,576 --> 00:33:47,408
Me? No.

764
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:49,833
I'd rather see how this plays out.

765
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:52,113
Aww.

766
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:54,048
It seems you two have
formed an alliance.

767
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,683
There's just one problem.

768
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:56,918
That you're the only
one who could give us

769
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,419
what we want... Yes, we know.

770
00:33:58,421 --> 00:33:59,954
You're always so quick to remind us

771
00:33:59,956 --> 00:34:02,790
how much we need you, Eobard.

772
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:04,725
But, clearly, you need us.

773
00:34:04,727 --> 00:34:06,561
You could have gotten in
this vault all by yourself.

774
00:34:06,563 --> 00:34:07,528
Why didn't you?

775
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,798
And for that matter...

776
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,201
why would a man who
can travel through time

777
00:34:13,203 --> 00:34:14,669
always be in such a hurry?

778
00:34:14,671 --> 00:34:16,204
We don't have time for this.

779
00:34:16,206 --> 00:34:18,840
Oh, I've got all the time in the world.

780
00:34:26,496 --> 00:34:27,628
Okay!

781
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:30,398
Okay, you two have made your point.

782
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,401
I need you as much as
you need me, all right.

783
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:35,636
But if you do not open that door,

784
00:34:35,638 --> 00:34:36,904
he is going to kill us.

785
00:34:36,906 --> 00:34:38,305
He is coming for me!

786
00:34:38,307 --> 00:34:39,807
Who's coming for you?

787
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:41,542
It's not a who. It's a... it's a...

788
00:34:41,544 --> 00:34:44,011
A what? A thing.

789
00:34:44,013 --> 00:34:45,312
What thing?

790
00:34:45,314 --> 00:34:46,647
Can you be a little more specific?

791
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:48,716
My ancestor killed himself in an effort

792
00:34:48,718 --> 00:34:50,317
to erase my very existence.

793
00:34:50,319 --> 00:34:52,720
Well, you look pretty spry despite it.

794
00:34:52,722 --> 00:34:54,755
The Flash pulled me from the timeline.

795
00:34:54,757 --> 00:34:57,725
He held me captive for months
and when I finally got loose,

796
00:34:57,727 --> 00:35:01,929
I found myself... pursued by something.

797
00:35:01,931 --> 00:35:03,831
I-I thought it was a time wraith,

798
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:07,067
the monsters that hunt
speedsters who mess with time.

799
00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:10,871
But, whatever is hunting me is...

800
00:35:10,873 --> 00:35:15,643
far worse than a time wraith.

801
00:35:17,313 --> 00:35:20,481
It can sense the Speed Force.

802
00:35:20,483 --> 00:35:22,316
And it's trying to kill me.

803
00:35:22,318 --> 00:35:24,852
Interestin... so that's why
you keep running out on us.

804
00:35:24,854 --> 00:35:27,388
Huh. So you're kinda
like a shark who'll die

805
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,856
if you stay in one place.

806
00:35:28,858 --> 00:35:30,157
We are all going to die if you don't...

807
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:34,562
It's too late.

808
00:35:34,564 --> 00:35:36,964
It's here.

809
00:35:36,966 --> 00:35:38,899
Ah, well, the good
news is you two finally

810
00:35:38,901 --> 00:35:40,835
got what you wanted, you managed
to balance our partnership.

811
00:35:40,837 --> 00:35:42,169
We're now all equally dead.

812
00:35:42,171 --> 00:35:44,038
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

813
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,673
This isn't the first scary speedster

814
00:35:45,675 --> 00:35:47,508
that we had to put in his place.

815
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:50,077
We're gonna get you out
of this bank vault, Eobard.

816
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,612
But on one condition.

817
00:35:51,614 --> 00:35:54,815
You stop treating us like lackeys.

818
00:35:54,817 --> 00:35:58,085
You think you can stop that?

819
00:35:58,087 --> 00:36:00,120
Good luck!

820
00:36:00,122 --> 00:36:01,922
Was that a yes?

821
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:04,758
- Yes.
- Great!

822
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,960
Let's go to work.

823
00:36:05,962 --> 00:36:07,394
Right, so, you say this thing

824
00:36:07,396 --> 00:36:09,330
is attracted to the Speed Force?

825
00:36:09,332 --> 00:36:12,032
What if you don't use it?

826
00:36:12,034 --> 00:36:13,467
What are you suggesting?

827
00:36:13,469 --> 00:36:15,269
That you stop running.

828
00:36:30,653 --> 00:36:32,456
It knows I'm here.

829
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,457
Good.

830
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,322
Because we've only got one shot at this.

831
00:36:41,931 --> 00:36:45,165
Remember, as long as you stay still,

832
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:46,567
he can't sense you.

833
00:37:11,127 --> 00:37:12,826
Easy, Eobard.

834
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:27,274
Easy.

835
00:37:50,938 --> 00:37:52,466
It won't stay trapped for long.

836
00:37:52,468 --> 00:37:54,101
We have to go.

837
00:37:54,103 --> 00:37:57,004
We?

838
00:37:57,006 --> 00:37:59,039
We...

839
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:00,841
Partners.

840
00:38:00,843 --> 00:38:01,942
Better.

841
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:10,216
Gideon, can you please take
the ship back to Central City?

842
00:38:10,218 --> 00:38:12,485
If your goal is to return to 2017,

843
00:38:12,487 --> 00:38:14,320
I'm afraid your father has instructed me

844
00:38:14,322 --> 00:38:16,122
not to permit you to leave the ship.

845
00:38:16,124 --> 00:38:18,991
Well, considering he never
wanted to be my father,

846
00:38:18,993 --> 00:38:21,060
that should draw his parental dictates

847
00:38:21,062 --> 00:38:22,528
into question, wouldn't it?

848
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,797
You share my fondness for erudition.

849
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:29,568
You truly are my daughter.

850
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:32,838
Well, I am sorry about that.

851
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,708
No, I'm... I'm the one who's sorry.

852
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,344
For what?

853
00:38:38,346 --> 00:38:40,412
It's not your fault I'm a mistake.

854
00:38:40,414 --> 00:38:44,016
Uh, I've made many mistakes
in my life, Lily, but you...

855
00:38:44,018 --> 00:38:47,653
most certainly are not one of them.

856
00:38:47,655 --> 00:38:50,656
The apology that I owe
you is for not telling you

857
00:38:50,658 --> 00:38:54,293
about the unique circumstances
of your conception.

858
00:38:54,295 --> 00:38:56,695
You didn't want me to
know that you didn't want me.

859
00:38:59,934 --> 00:39:02,968
No, you're right, I...

860
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:04,603
I didn't want children.

861
00:39:06,707 --> 00:39:09,708
But if there's one thing my travels

862
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:13,012
aboard the Waverider have taught me,

863
00:39:13,014 --> 00:39:16,649
it's that time often doesn't
provide us with what we want.

864
00:39:16,651 --> 00:39:20,186
But it... it's quite adept
at giving us what we need.

865
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:25,157
And I... I nel ed you...

866
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,425
in my life...

867
00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:33,098
In ways that I... I could
never even dare to imagine.

868
00:39:39,173 --> 00:39:43,642
I just don't want there to
be any more secrets between us.

869
00:39:43,644 --> 00:39:47,246
Well, in that spirit, I
suppose I should tell you

870
00:39:47,248 --> 00:39:51,116
that I am one half of a
nuclear powered superhero

871
00:39:51,118 --> 00:39:53,085
called Firestorm.

872
00:39:55,356 --> 00:39:56,989
So not funny, Dad.

873
00:40:00,494 --> 00:40:03,729
Anyway, as fun as this was,

874
00:40:03,731 --> 00:40:08,000
I probably should be getting home.

875
00:40:08,002 --> 00:40:09,802
You're sure you can't stay?

876
00:40:09,804 --> 00:40:11,971
I... I would. I just, um...

877
00:40:11,973 --> 00:40:14,607
I'm working on a series
of synthetic proteins

878
00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:17,509
that are not gonna
fold themselves, so...

879
00:40:17,511 --> 00:40:19,812
So then, I guess this is good-bye.

880
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:25,517
Good luck folding those proteins.

881
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:27,193
Good luck rescuing your friend, Rip.

882
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:28,487
Hm.

883
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:36,929
Bye, Dad.

884
00:40:53,147 --> 00:40:55,528
Feel no pressure to tell
us what all this techno-crap

885
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:56,342
is about.

886
00:40:56,367 --> 00:40:58,017
We're sure we can
figure it out ourselves.

887
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:00,252
This, uh, techno-crap,

888
00:41:00,254 --> 00:41:02,721
as you so eloquently put it,

889
00:41:02,723 --> 00:41:04,590
is Captain Hunter's memories.

890
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:06,725
Including the locations
of the other pieces

891
00:41:06,727 --> 00:41:08,227
of the Spear, I hope.

892
00:41:08,229 --> 00:41:10,162
That is my working assumption, yes.

893
00:41:10,164 --> 00:41:12,264
All we have to do now
is upload his memories

894
00:41:12,266 --> 00:41:14,233
to his cerebral cortex.

895
00:41:14,235 --> 00:41:16,635
And that's not happening now because?

896
00:41:16,637 --> 00:41:20,205
Well, we would hardly be doing
Captain Hunter any favors

897
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:22,775
if we just restored the memories
without taking the liberty

898
00:41:22,777 --> 00:41:25,010
to address some of his shortcomings.

899
00:41:25,012 --> 00:41:27,446
What, like, stopping him biting his nails?

900
00:41:27,448 --> 00:41:31,150
Not exactly.

901
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:48,467
Can I help you with something, soldier?

902
00:41:48,469 --> 00:41:50,336
No, General Washington, I'm fine.

903
00:41:51,806 --> 00:41:55,040
You, on the other hand...

904
00:41:58,193 --> 00:42:02,818
