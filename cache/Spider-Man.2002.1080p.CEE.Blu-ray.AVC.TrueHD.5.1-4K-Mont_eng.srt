1
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,274
<i>Who am I?
You sure you wanna know?</i>

2
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,736
<i>The story of my life
is not for the faint of heart.</i>

3
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,531
<i>If somebody said
it was a happy little tale...</i>

4
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,202
<i>...if somebody told you I was just your
average guy, not a care in the world...</i>

5
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,162
<i>...somebody lied.</i>

6
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,625
<i>But let me assure you, this,
like any story worth telling...</i>

7
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,210
<i>...is all about a girl.</i>

8
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:35,549
<i>That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.</i>

9
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,802
<i>The woman I've loved
since before I even liked girls.</i>

10
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,638
<i>I'd like to tell you that's me
next to her.</i>

11
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,807
<i>Aw, heck, I'd even take him.</i>

12
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,728
Hey! Stop the bus!

13
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,929
<i>That's me.</i>

14
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,982
Tell him to stop! Please!

15
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,400
Stop!

16
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,819
Hey! Stop the bus!

17
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:59,072
Stop! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven Boulevard.

18
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,490
Catch a cab, Parker!

19
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,748
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.

20
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,463
What a geek!

21
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,342
- Don't even think about it.
- You're so lame, Parker.

22
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,094
Would you date him?

23
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,198
Midtown High seniors.

24
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:45,076
No wandering. Proceed direct...
Knock it off.

25
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,830
Remember, it is a privilege
to be here.

26
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,459
We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.

27
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,878
So behave accordingly.

28
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,089
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.

29
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,925
Come on, people, stay together.

30
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,011
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.

31
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,224
- Where were you?
- Checking out the library.

32
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,935
- Looking at the books.
- Yeah, right.

33
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,064
Charles, can we drive
around the corner, please?

34
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,524
Why?

35
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,526
The entrance is right there.

36
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:21,404
Dad, these are public-school kids.
I'm not showing up in the Rolls.

37
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,907
What, you want me
to trade in my car for a Jetta...

38
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,077
...because you flunked out
of every private school I sent you to?

39
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,247
- It wasn't for me.
- Of course it was.

40
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,582
Don't ever be ashamed
of who you are.

41
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,252
I'm not ashamed of who I am.

42
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,753
It's just...

43
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,380
Just what, Harry?

44
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,090
Forget it.

45
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,427
Pete!

46
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,513
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, man. What's up?

47
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,056
Harry.

48
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,433
- Won't you be needing this?
- Thanks, Dad.

49
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,770
Peter, may I introduce my father,
Norman Osborn.

50
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,355
I've heard so much about you.

51
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:59,025
- Great honour to meet you, sir.
- Harry says you're a science whiz.

52
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,112
You know,
I'm something of a scientist myself.

53
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,448
I read all your research
on nanotechnology. Really brilliant.

54
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,660
- And you understood it?
- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

55
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,122
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.

56
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,124
I live with my aunt and uncle.
They are.

57
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,877
Hey, you two! Let's move!

58
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,714
- Nice to meet you.
- Hope to see you again.

59
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,553
- He doesn't seem so bad.
- Not if you're a genius.

60
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,680
I think he wants to adopt you.

61
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:33,560
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.

62
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:37,564
They're in the order Araneae,
divided into three suborders.

63
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:38,972
That's amazing!

64
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:42,944
This is the most advanced electron
microscope on the Eastern Seaboard.

65
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,322
It's unreal.

66
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,283
Arachnids from all three
groups possess...

67
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,745
...varying strengths to help them
search for food.

68
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:56,416
For example, the Delena spider,
family Sparassidae...

69
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,754
...has the ability to jump
to catch its prey.

70
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,672
For the school paper?

71
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:12,182
Next, we have the net web spider,
family Filistatidae...

72
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,267
...genus Kukulcania.

73
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:18,855
Spins a funnel-shaped web whose
strands have a tensile strength...

74
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:24,319
...proportionately equal to the
high-tension wires used in bridges.

75
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,446
- Leave him alone.
- Or what?

76
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,616
Or his father will fire your father.

77
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,369
What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?

78
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,038
What is going on?

79
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,291
The next person who talks
will fail this course. I kid you not.

80
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,502
- This spider...
- Let's go.

81
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,839
...hunts using reflexes with
nerve-conduction velocity so fast...

82
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,551
...that some researchers believe
it borders on precognition.

83
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,887
- An early awareness of danger.
- Jerks.

84
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,847
A spider-sense.

85
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,141
Hey, look at that spider.

86
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:59,729
Some spiders change colours
to blend into their environment.

87
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,898
It's a defence mechanism.

88
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,360
Peter, what makes you think
I would want to know that?

89
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,736
Who wouldn't?

90
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,740
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's genetic research facility...

91
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:15,286
- You gonna talk to her now?
- Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.

92
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,414
Armed with these DNA blueprints...

93
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,250
...we have now begun
what was once thought impossible.

94
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,129
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, hateful little things.

95
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,714
I love them!

96
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,924
Yeah, me too.

97
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,762
You know, spiders can change
their colour...

98
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,766
- ...to blend into their environment.
- Really?

99
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:41,146
- Yeah, it's a defence mechanism.
- Cool.

100
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,649
...Transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

101
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,944
...combining the genetic
information from all three spiders...

102
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:52,782
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

103
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,451
There's 14.

104
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,286
I beg your pardon?

105
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,997
- One's missing.
- Yeah.

106
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,544
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.

107
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,381
Do you know that this is the largest
electron microscope...

108
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,799
...on the Eastern Seaboard?

109
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:14,012
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.

110
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,930
Let's go talk about how we listen.

111
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:24,105
Now, I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...

112
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,191
...but at Midtown High...

113
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:38,411
Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.

114
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,163
- Sure.
- Great.

115
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,540
Where do you want me? Over here?

116
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,084
Yeah, that's great.

117
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,169
Don't make me look ugly.

118
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,379
That's impossible.

119
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,888
Perfect.

120
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,189
- Is that good?
- Great.

121
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,113
That's great.

122
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,703
M.J., let's go!

123
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,833
Wait. Thanks!

124
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,057
Parker, let's do it.

125
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:01,244
We solved the horizon glide
and the multi-G balance issues.

126
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,955
I've already seen the glider.

127
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,416
That's not what I'm here for.

128
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,294
General Slocum,
good to see you again.

129
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,297
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

130
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,382
- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.

131
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,094
Always a pleasure to have
our board of directors visit.

132
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:21,723
I want to see the progress report
on human performance enhancers.

133
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,394
We tried vapour inhalation with rats.
Their strength increased by 800%.

134
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,438
- Excellent.
- Any side effects?

135
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,805
In one trial, yes.

136
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,525
An aberration. All the tests since
have been successful.

137
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,446
In the trial that went wrong,
what were the side effects?

138
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,948
Violence, aggression...

139
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,867
...and insanity.

140
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,786
- What do you recommend?
- That was only one test.

141
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,874
Except for Dr. Stromm, our entire
staff certifies the product...

142
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,960
- ...ready for human testing.
- Dr. Stromm?

143
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,965
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

144
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,636
- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.

145
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,639
I'll be frank with you.

146
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:07,727
I never supported your programme. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.

147
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,647
The general has approved
Quest Aerospace...

148
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,733
...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton design.

149
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,654
- They test in two weeks.
- And if your performance enhancers...

150
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,242
...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...

151
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:26,871
...I'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.

152
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,333
Gentlemen. Ladies.

153
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:40,843
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voile! There is light.

154
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,179
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

155
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:48,184
Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.

156
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,937
I'm already on my ass, May.

157
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:55,608
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years...

158
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,486
...what else would you call it?
I am on my ass.

159
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,030
Hand me that dish. The green one.

160
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,033
The corporation is downsizing
the people...

161
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,369
...and upsizing their profits.

162
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,539
Oh, Ben, you'll get another job
somewhere.

163
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,459
Well... Well, let's look
in the paper and see.

164
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,380
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

165
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,173
Computer...

166
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:23,136
Computer salesman, computer
engineer, computer analyst.

167
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:27,056
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

168
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:32,645
I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and
besides, I have a family to provide for.

169
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,732
I love you. And Peter loves you.

170
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,235
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.

171
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,906
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.

172
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:49,329
Hi, sweetie. You're just...
Just in time for dinner.

173
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,081
Hey. How you doing, buddy?
How was the field trip?

174
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,084
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

175
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,754
- You won't have a bite?
- No thanks. Had a bite.

176
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,340
Did you get some pictures, Peter?

177
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,010
I gotta crash. Everything's fine.

178
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,013
What's that all about?

179
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,495
<i>In this recombination lab...</i>

180
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:35,291
<i>...we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...</i>

181
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,544
<i>...combining the genetic
information from all three spiders...</i>

182
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:43,549
<i>...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.</i>

183
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,984
Dr. Osborn, please. The
performance enhancers aren't ready.

184
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,488
The data just doesn't justify
this test.

185
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:09,325
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.

186
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,702
Don't be a coward.

187
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,747
Risks are part of laboratory science.

188
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:18,668
Let me reschedule, with a proper
medical staff and a volunteer.

189
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,338
- Just give me two weeks.
- Two weeks? In two weeks...

190
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:26,008
...we'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.

191
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,928
Sometimes you gotta
do things yourself.

192
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,764
- Get me the Promachloraperazine.
- For what?

193
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,685
It begins catalyzation when the vapour
hits the bloodstream.

194
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,273
40,000 years of evolution...

195
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,193
...and we've barely tapped
the vastness of human potential.

196
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,375
Oh, that's cold.

197
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,300
Norman?

198
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,899
Norman!

199
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,443
Norman!

200
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:16,953
Oh, my God.

201
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,582
Oh, my God! Norman?

202
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,377
Oh, my God! Norman!

203
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,978
Back to formula?

204
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,514
Weird.

205
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,818
- Peter?
- Yeah?

206
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,778
Are you all right?

207
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,324
I'm fine.

208
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,743
Any better this morning?
Any change?

209
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,286
Change?

210
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,205
Yep. Big change.

211
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:47,376
- Well, hurry up. You'll be late.
- Right.

212
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,146
Okay.

213
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:15,655
- Goodness me!
- Jeez. I thought you were sick.

214
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,531
- I got better.
- You see?

215
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,077
- Bye, guys.
- Have you got your lunch money?

216
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,914
Hey, Michelangelo, don't forget,
we're painting the kitchen after school.

217
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,875
Sure thing, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.

218
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,169
And don't start up with me.

219
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:35,424
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.

220
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:40,096
You're trash!
You're always gonna be trash!

221
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,849
- I have to go to school.
- Who's stopping you?

222
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,910
Hi, M.J.

223
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,287
Hey, M.J.

224
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:10,084
I don't know if you realise this, but
we've been neighbours since I was 6.

225
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:13,587
And I was wondering
if we could get together sometime?

226
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,339
I got the car. Hop in.

227
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,134
Do something fun?
Or, I don't know.

228
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,053
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.

229
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,681
Or not.

230
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,856
Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!

231
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,943
- Stop the bus!
- Catch a cab!

232
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,987
Tell him to stop.

233
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,656
- Check him out!
- Dork!

234
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,388
Dad!

235
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,724
Dad, are you all right?

236
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,851
Harry.

237
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,190
What are you doing on the floor?

238
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,691
I don't know.

239
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,861
Have you been there all night?

240
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,114
Last night I was...

241
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,701
What?

242
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,704
- I don't remember.
- Mr. Osborn?

243
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,248
Sir, I asked her to wait in the foyer.

244
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:35,795
- My father's not feeling well.
- Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.

245
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:37,099
What?

246
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,716
They found his body in the lab.
He's been murdered, sir.

247
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:44,178
- What are you talking about?
- And the flight suit and the glider...

248
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,430
- What about it?
- It's been stolen, sir.

249
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,124
Wow! Great reflexes!

250
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,169
- Thanks.
- No problem.

251
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:22,174
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.

252
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,593
You just get contacts?

253
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,519
Well, see you.

254
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:18,814
- What happened?
- He's freaking weird.

255
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:20,649
Did you see that?

256
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,903
Parker?

257
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,103
- It's a fight!
- Think you're pretty funny, freak?

258
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,315
- Flash, it was an accident.
- So is my breaking your teeth.

259
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,193
- Come on, Flash, stop.
- I don't wanna fight you, Flash.

260
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,820
- I wouldn't wanna fight me neither.
- Kick his ass.

261
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,249
Help him, Harry.

262
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,556
How'd he do that?

263
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,892
Which one?

264
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,435
He's all yours, man.

265
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,661
Flash, get up!

266
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:00,416
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.

267
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,836
Peter, that was... That was amazing.

268
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,755
I'm out of here. Come on.

269
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,144
Go, web!

270
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,198
Fly.

271
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,868
Up, up and away, web.

272
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,871
Shazam!

273
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,706
Go! GO!

274
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,708
Go, web, go!

275
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,577
Tallyho.

276
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,123
- Is she back with the beer yet?
- What?

277
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,541
Bring me some beer.

278
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,294
- Get up off your ass.
- I paid for beer...

279
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,962
- Stop yelling.
- Stop it!

280
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,465
You're as stupid as your mother.
Get away from me!

281
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,217
You are drunk, do you know that?

282
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,928
Where's she going?
Where you going?

283
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:45,349
These dishes are not done.
Somebody's gotta do the dishes.

284
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,852
- Why don't you do them?
- Get in here and do the dishes.

285
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:53,190
- You do them. They're yours, anyway.
- I'm going out!

286
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,901
- Were you listening to that?
- No.

287
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,488
Well, I heard, but I was
just taking out the trash.

288
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:02,407
I guess you can always hear us.

289
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,868
Everybody shouts.

290
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,328
Your aunt and uncle don't.

291
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,290
Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.

292
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,879
Listen, M.J., about today
at school with Flash...

293
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,756
You really freaked us out.

294
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,217
I'm sorry. Is he okay?

295
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:24,471
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.

296
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,769
So where are you going
after you graduate?

297
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,818
I wanna move into the city.

298
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:43,532
And hopefully get a job
as a photographer.

299
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,535
Work my way through college.

300
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,870
What about you?

301
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,039
Headed for the city too.

302
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,001
Can't wait to get out of here.

303
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,670
I wanna...

304
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,423
What?

305
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,428
No, come on. Try me.

306
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,930
I wanna...

307
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,391
...act...

308
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,060
...on-stage.

309
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,396
Really?

310
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,940
Oh, that's perfect.

311
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,776
You were awesome
in all the school plays.

312
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,945
- Really?
- Yeah.

313
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,615
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.

314
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,285
Peter, that was first grade.

315
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,287
Well...

316
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,331
...even so.

317
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,250
Sometimes...

318
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,753
...you know people.

319
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,507
You can just see what's coming.

320
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:48,347
What do you see coming for you?

321
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,601
I don't know.

322
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:59,608
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.

323
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,114
And what for me?

324
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,616
For you?

325
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,787
You're gonna light up Broadway.

326
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,623
You know...

327
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,630
...you're taller than you look.

328
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,340
I hunch.

329
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,094
Don't.

330
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,309
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.

331
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,561
Come on.

332
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,980
I gotta go.

333
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:40,982
Bye.

334
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,319
- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
- Yeah, right?

335
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,488
- Look at it!
- Hop in.

336
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,907
Oh, my God! What a cool car!

337
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,742
Pretty tight, huh?

338
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:55,497
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.

339
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,500
Cool car.

340
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,261
What's going on in there?

341
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,097
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.

342
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,935
Well, you're acting
so strangely, Peter.

343
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,312
Okay. Thanks.

344
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,471
Something's bothering him. Maybe
he's too embarrassed to tell me.

345
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:19,307
Maybe I'm too embarrassed
to ask him.

346
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,143
I just don't know anymore.

347
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,896
I'm going to the library.
I'll see you later.

348
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,692
- Wait, Pete. I'll drive you there, buddy.
- I'll take the train.

349
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:32,112
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go.

350
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,626
- Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
- Wait a minute, we need to talk.

351
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:51,172
- We can talk later.
- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.

352
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,259
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?

353
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,303
Because we haven't talked
for so long...

354
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,471
...May and I
don't know who you are anymore.

355
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:03,685
You shirk your chores. You have all
those weird experiments in your room.

356
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:07,981
- You start fights at school...
- I didn't start that fight, I told you that.

357
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:11,151
- You sure as hell finished it.
- Was I supposed to run away'?

358
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,362
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but...

359
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:19,075
Pete, you're changing. I went through
exactly the same thing at your age.

360
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,827
No. Not exactly.

361
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,194
Peter...

362
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,373
...these are the years
when a man changes...

363
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,544
...into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life.

364
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,005
Just be careful
who you change into.

365
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:38,845
This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably deserved what happened.

366
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,098
But just because you can
beat him up...

367
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,809
...doesn't give you the right to.

368
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:50,732
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.

369
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:56,321
Are you afraid I'll become a criminal?
Quit worrying about me, okay?

370
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,908
Something's different.
I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing me.

371
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,412
I don't mean to lecture or preach.
And I know I'm not your father...

372
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,415
Then stop pretending to be!

373
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,754
Right.

374
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,676
I'll pick you up here at 10.

375
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,754
<i>Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!</i>

376
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:03,513
- One, two, three. That's it!
- Who's the man?

377
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,853
Ladies and gentlemen...

378
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:14,566
...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.

379
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:21,322
For $3000..

380
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:25,118
...is there no one here man enough
to stay in the ring...

381
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:29,998
...for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?

382
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,669
Who?

383
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,796
I know who.

384
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:41,801
The Flying Dutchman!

385
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,595
Next.

386
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,724
There's no featherweight
division here, small fry. Next.

387
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,726
No, no. Sign me up.

388
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:53,563
Okay. You understand the NYWL
is not responsible...

389
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:57,859
...for any injury you may and probably
will sustain in said event?

390
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,278
And you're participating
under your own free will?

391
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,645
Yes.

392
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:05,492
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.

393
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,330
Told you! Told you!

394
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,332
Winner!

395
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,750
Next victim!

396
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,505
Are you ready for more?

397
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:23,218
Bone Saw is ready!

398
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:30,308
Will the next victim please
enter the arena at this time?

399
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:35,230
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...

400
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,859
...the sum of $3000 will be paid to...

401
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,738
- What's your name, kid?
- The Human Spider.

402
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,699
That's it? That's the best you got?

403
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,993
- Yeah.
- Oh, that sucks.

404
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,665
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...

405
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:57,085
...the terrifying, the deadly...

406
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,547
...the amazing Spider-Man!

407
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,552
- It's "The Human Spider."
- I don't care, get out there.

408
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,763
- No, he got my name wrong.
- Get out there, you moron.

409
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,810
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out.

410
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,062
I hope you brought your mommy.

411
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:19,774
- We'll break you!
- You'll need someone to cry to.

412
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:26,197
I'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one.

413
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,741
Oh, my God!

414
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,577
Oh, my legs!

415
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,371
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.

416
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,540
Kill! Kill! Kill!

417
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,300
Kill! Kill! Kill!

418
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,676
Cage!

419
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,478
Hello? Guys?

420
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:03,484
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?

421
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:08,489
This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

422
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,160
Unlock the thing!
Take the chain off!

423
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,162
Hey, freak show!

424
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,998
You're going nowhere.

425
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,542
I got you for three minutes.

426
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,003
Three minutes of playtime.

427
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,429
- What are you doing up there?
- Staying away from you.

428
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,891
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?

429
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,566
Finish him off!

430
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,283
Smash him!

431
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,209
- Hit him!
- Harder!

432
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:05,546
Kick his spider ass!

433
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,748
Hit him!

434
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,940
One, two, three!

435
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,943
That's it! That's it! Winner!

436
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:32,198
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion, Spider-Man!

437
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:36,744
<i>Spider-Man! Spider-Man!
Spider-Man!</i>

438
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,259
Now get out of here.

439
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,722
A hundred bucks'?
The ad said 3000.

440
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,307
Well, check it again, webhead.

441
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:02,353
It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.

442
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:05,940
For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.

443
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,483
I need that money.

444
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:11,029
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

445
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,457
- Hey, what the hell...?
- Put the money in the bag.

446
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,626
Hurry up!

447
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,052
Hey! He stole the gate!

448
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,179
Stop that guy!

449
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:39,015
Stop him! He's got my money!

450
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,475
Thanks.

451
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,145
What's the hell's the matter with you?
You let him go!

452
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,522
Cut him off in the lobby
and call the cops!

453
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:50,735
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he'll get away with my money.

454
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,154
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

455
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,593
- Sir, you gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?

456
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,221
Old dude, man.

457
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:22,600
Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving. Let's go!

458
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,603
- What happened?
- Someone got hurt.

459
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,192
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Stay back.

460
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,528
- Stay back!
- That's my uncle!

461
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,407
- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.

462
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,994
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

463
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,579
Uncle Ben?

464
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:45,998
Uncle Ben.

465
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,087
Uncle Ben?

466
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,217
Peter.

467
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,886
I'm here, Uncle Ben.

468
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:05,726
Peter.

469
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,751
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth Avenue.

470
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,673
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.

471
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,790
Get a unit to the rear!

472
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,295
I got the back!

473
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,601
Who's there?

474
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,963
Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.
Give me a chance!

475
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:07,635
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?

476
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,303
Answer me!

477
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,974
<i>Stop that guy!</i>

478
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,148
<i>Thanks.</i>

479
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,275
See you.

480
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:57,309
<i>Freeze! We've got the place
completely surrounded.</i>

481
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,396
Oh, no. My God.

482
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:48,068
Oh, no. Oh, my God. No!

483
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,371
- Good evening.
- General. Good to see you.

484
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:03,042
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, general.

485
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:08,380
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.

486
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,885
- He's clear, let's go!
- You're confident about this test?

487
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,346
Absolutely.
Captain Curtis is our top pilot.

488
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,849
Now, what about your commitment
to OSCORP?

489
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,937
Nothing would please me more than to
put Norman Osborn out of business.

490
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,317
Preflight complete. Mark.

491
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,074
<i>We are picking up
an unidentified object, closing fast.</i>

492
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:36,441
What the hell is that?

493
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:37,993
<i>Can you see anything?</i>

494
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,828
Oh, my God!

495
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:52,967
- Say "chess."
- Chess!

496
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,344
Peter!

497
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:59,473
Darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.

498
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,727
Pete? Good news. Dad got the place
in New York, so we're all set this fall.

499
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,479
- That's great.
- You made it.

500
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:11,569
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.

501
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:15,155
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Dad.

502
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:18,200
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.

503
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:19,868
Yeah.

504
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:26,208
I know this has been
a difficult time for you...

505
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:29,628
...but I want you to try
to enjoy this day.

506
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,380
Commencement:

507
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:35,676
The end of one thing,
the start of something new.

508
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:41,181
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.

509
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,934
You know what? Whatever.

510
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,936
Your loss.

511
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:50,190
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.

512
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,319
And if you ever need anything,
just give me a call.

513
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,336
Can I fix you something?

514
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,004
No, thanks.

515
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:58,967
I missed him a lot today.

516
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,055
I know.

517
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,642
I miss him too.

518
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,729
But he was there.

519
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:19,113
I can't help thinking about
the last thing I said to him.

520
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:24,326
He tried to tell me something
important, and I threw it in his face.

521
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:28,163
You loved him...

522
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,084
...and he loved you.

523
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,630
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.

524
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:40,259
How you were meant
for great things.

525
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:43,137
You won't disappoint him.

526
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:20,841
<i>With great power
comes great responsibility.</i>

527
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:24,219
<i>Remember that, Pete.
Remember that.</i>

528
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,522
Hurry up!

529
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:51,622
He's not a man. My brother saw him
building a nest in Lincoln Center.

530
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:55,000
I think he's human, a man.
Could be a woman.

531
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,840
Bobby. Get a load of this!

532
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:07,054
He throws up his hands,
ropes come out...

533
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:09,264
...and he climbs up them
like a spider web.

534
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:13,685
I see the web, his signature,
and I know Spider-Man was here.

535
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,480
The guy protects us,
protects the people.

536
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,399
Some kind of freakyloo
or something. Wackadoo.

537
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,568
He stinks and I don't like him.

538
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,904
Don't move, lady!

539
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,748
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.

540
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,084
He has those tights
and that tight little...

541
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:40,587
<i>Dresses like a spider
He looks like a bug</i>

542
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:44,550
<i>But we should all just give him
One big hug</i>

543
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:49,346
<i>Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man</i>

544
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:56,770
"Who is Spider-Man?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.

545
00:55:56,937 --> 00:56:00,816
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

546
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:02,943
<i>Mr. Jameson, your wife needs...</i>

547
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,528
There's a page six problem.

548
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,613
We have a page one problem.
Shut up.

549
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,323
- Well?
- He's news.

550
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,951
- The clients can't wait.
- They're about to.

551
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:15,205
- He pulled six people off a subway.
- From a wreck he probably caused.

552
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,040
Something goes wrong
and he's there.

553
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,543
Look! He's fleeing the scene.
What's that tell you?

554
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,462
He's not fleeing, he's probably
going to save somebody else.

555
00:56:22,567 --> 00:56:23,767
He's a hero!

556
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,633
Then why does he wear a mask?
What's he got to hide?

557
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,761
She needs to know if you want
chintz or chenille in the dining room.

558
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,472
- Whichever one's cheaper.
- Mr. Jameson, it's like this:

559
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,974
We double-booked page six.

560
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:36,476
So Macy's and Conway's both have
three quarters...

561
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:39,813
- We sold out four printings.
- Sold out?

562
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,231
Every copy.

563
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,318
Tomorrow, Spider-Man, page one,
with a decent picture.

564
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,153
- Conway to page 7.
- That's a problem.

565
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,655
Page eight, give him 10 percent off.
Five percent.

566
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,532
- That can't be done.
- Get out of here!

567
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,618
We don't have a decent picture.

568
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:55,537
Eddie's been on it for weeks,
but we can barely see him.

569
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:57,831
Aw, what is he, shy?

570
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:02,002
If we can get a picture of Julia Roberts
in a thong, we can get this weirdo.

571
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:05,589
Put an ad on the front page:
"Cash for a picture of Spider-Man."

572
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:09,217
He doesn't wanna be famous?
I'll make him infamous!

573
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,637
Hey!

574
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,106
Buzz off.

575
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,777
- M.J., it's me, Peter.
- Hi!

576
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:33,367
- What are you doing around here?
- Begging for a job. How about you?

577
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,579
- I'm headed to an audition.
- An audition? So you're acting?

578
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:38,946
Yeah.

579
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:42,876
I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.

580
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:44,243
That's great.

581
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:48,006
- You're doing it. Living your dream.
- Glamour girl!

582
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:49,800
Your drawer was short $6!

583
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,594
Next time that happens,
I'll take it out of your cheque.

584
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:57,474
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!

585
00:57:57,683 --> 00:57:59,977
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.

586
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:04,272
It better not happen no more.
Don't roll your eyes at me.

587
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,948
Some dream, huh?

588
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:16,451
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

589
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:19,413
- Don't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry?

590
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:24,418
Don't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

591
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,420
Oh, yeah. Right.

592
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,756
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.

593
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:34,344
- He'd think it was low or something.
- It's not low. You have a job.

594
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:39,016
You know, Harry doesn't live on
a little place I like to call Earth.

595
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,436
No, I guess not.

596
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,026
Thanks, Pete.

597
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,362
We should catch up sometime.

598
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:59,119
Let's get some lunch some evening.

599
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:04,875
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.

600
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,794
- And I won't tell Harry.
- No, don't tell Harry.

601
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,212
I won't.

602
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,133
I won't tell Harry.

603
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,897
Timing's perfect. Hey.

604
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:30,400
Five new contracts. It'll be great.

605
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:35,197
Storming Norman's
making his weekly inspection.

606
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:38,283
Spent half of it on the phone.

607
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:43,580
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help. I'm really lost here.

608
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,707
Are you all right?

609
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:51,588
You look like you just got
second place in the science fair.

610
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:55,801
I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.

611
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,552
You were late again?

612
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:00,931
I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?

613
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,558
Around.

614
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,435
Peter Parker.

615
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:08,271
- Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
- Who's that?

616
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,525
- This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
- Dad.

617
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,568
- When do I get to meet her?
- Dad.

618
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:17,030
Well, sorry.
Harry hasn't mentioned her.

619
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:23,161
Pete, you're probably looking
for a job now, right?

620
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,206
Dad, maybe you can help him out.

621
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:30,710
- No, I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
- It's no problem. I'll make a few calls.

622
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:35,173
No, I couldn't accept it, sir.
I like to earn what I get. I'll find work.

623
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,008
I respect that.

624
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,845
You want to make it
on your own steam.

625
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:41,847
That's great.

626
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:45,058
What other skills do you have,
Parker?

627
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:47,227
I was thinking about photography.

628
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,606
Hello.

629
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:55,819
Let's go! Move it!

630
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,655
Watch the street!

631
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,463
Cheese!

632
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,682
They're crap.

633
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:28,852
Crap, crap. Megacrap.

634
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:32,230
- I'll give you $200 for all of them.
- That seems a little low.

635
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,191
Take them somewhere else, then.

636
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,902
<i>Your wife says the tile for the foyer
is out of stock.</i>

637
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,695
Tell her we'll put a rug there.

638
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,031
Sit down. Give me that.

639
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,160
Give you 300.
That's the standard freelance fee.

640
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:47,662
- Tear up page one. Run that photo.
- Headline?

641
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:51,249
<i>"Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Daily Bugle Photos."</i>

642
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,251
Menace? He was protecting
that armoured...

643
01:01:53,398 --> 01:01:54,598
Tell you what, Atticus.

644
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:57,339
You take the pictures,
I'll make up the headlines. Okay?

645
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,507
- Yes, sir.
- Goody.

646
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:03,470
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.

647
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,723
- I'd like a job, sir.
- No jobs. Freelance.

648
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:08,558
Best thing for a kid your age.

649
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:13,063
You bring me more shots
of that clown, maybe I'll buy them.

650
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:16,233
But I never said you have a job.
Meat.

651
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:20,695
I'll send you a box of Christmas
meat. Bring me more photos.

652
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,490
- Hi.
- Hi.

653
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:27,118
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.

654
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:31,331
- Welcome to the <i>Daily Bugle</i>.
- Thank you.

655
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,250
I'm Peter Parker.

656
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,921
I'm a photographer.

657
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,258
Yes. I can see that.

658
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:50,809
As of today...

659
01:02:50,976 --> 01:02:54,980
...OSCORP Industries has surpassed
Quest Aerospace...

660
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:59,651
...as the principal supplier
to the United States military.

661
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:02,654
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...

662
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:05,991
...costs are down,
revenues are up...

663
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:09,077
...and our stock
has never been higher.

664
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:13,665
Wonderful news, Norman.
That's why we're selling the company.

665
01:03:14,729 --> 01:03:15,929
What?

666
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:21,131
Quest is recapitalizing in the wake
of the bombing. Expanding.

667
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:24,092
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.

668
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:25,459
Why wasn't I told?

669
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:29,681
They don't want a power struggle
with entrenched management.

670
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:32,267
The deal is off if you come with it.

671
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:35,854
The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.

672
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:38,023
You can't do this to me.

673
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:43,486
I started this company.

674
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,948
You know how much I sacrificed?!

675
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:56,249
- Oh, Max. Please.
- Norman, the board is unanimous.

676
01:03:56,791 --> 01:04:00,795
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

677
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,464
I'm sorry.

678
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,592
You're out, Norman.

679
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:16,978
Am I?

680
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:24,110
<i>Welcome to OSCORP Industries
Unity Day Festival.</i>

681
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:27,697
<i>Let's hear it for Macy Gray.</i>

682
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:07,654
M.J., why didn't you wear
the black dress?

683
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:12,367
Just, I wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.

684
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:17,038
Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what. You think I'm pretty.

685
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,999
I think you're beautiful.

686
01:05:32,804 --> 01:05:36,057
M.J., would you do me a favour?
I forgot my drink inside.

687
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:48,403
- Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
- Oh, Harry.

688
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:54,659
- Have you seen my father around?
- Well, I'm not sure if he's coming.

689
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:09,174
- What is that?
- Must be new this year.

690
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,305
What is that?

691
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:16,672
That's our glider!

692
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,277
What the hell was that?

693
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,098
Code three!

694
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:17,283
- Oh, my God! Harry!
- M.J.!

695
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:26,709
Harry! Help me! Harry!

696
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:34,425
Out, am I?

697
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:41,057
- Mary Jane!
- Harry!

698
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:46,062
Hello, my dear.

699
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,898
It's Spider-Man!

700
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:02,370
- Come on, move, kid.
- Billy!

701
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:08,209
Somebody help him!

702
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:09,669
No!

703
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:13,006
Mommy!

704
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:16,968
- Hold it!
- I surrender.

705
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:20,054
- Oh, boy.
- Hold it right there!

706
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,103
Impressive.

707
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:54,839
- Mary Jane!
- Help! Someone please help me!

708
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:21,398
Hold on!

709
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:24,109
Watch out!

710
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:36,839
We'll meet again, Spider-Man!

711
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:40,343
Hold on, Mary Jane!

712
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:25,012
Well, beats taking the subway.

713
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,433
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.

714
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:29,841
Wait.

715
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:31,185
Who are you?

716
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,938
- You know who I am.
- I do?

717
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:36,149
Your friendly neighbourhood
Spider-Man.

718
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:52,373
Incredible?
What do you mean he's incredible?

719
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:57,211
No. All right, wait.
Stay there. I'm gonna come over.

720
01:10:57,879 --> 01:10:59,547
No, I'm gonna come...

721
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:03,301
All right. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?

722
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:06,471
And we'll go and have breakfast
and...

723
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:08,931
...I wanna buy you something.

724
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:12,435
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.

725
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:17,148
Okay. And what do you mean,
incredible?

726
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:22,361
All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.

727
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,280
Don't let the bedbugs...

728
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:32,997
She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.

729
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:38,336
Look, Pete, I should have
told you about us.

730
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:42,340
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.

731
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:45,551
It's just, you know,
you never made a move.

732
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:48,137
You're right.

733
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,556
I didn't.

734
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,979
I'm gonna get some rest.

735
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:00,483
I'm gonna stay up for a while.

736
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,319
What was that thing?

737
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:05,321
I don't know.

738
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:10,034
Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.

739
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:27,593
Somebody there?

740
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,887
<i>Somebody.</i>

741
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:32,765
Who said that?

742
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:36,769
<i>Don't play the innocent with me.</i>

743
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:41,899
<i>You've known all along.</i>

744
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:47,280
Where are you?

745
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:51,576
<i>Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.</i>

746
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,209
<i>I'm right here.</i>

747
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:03,963
I don't understand.

748
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:08,134
Did you think it was coincidence?

749
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:11,929
So many good things,
all happening for you.

750
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:15,766
All for you. Norman.

751
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,729
What do you want'?

752
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:22,315
To say what you won't.

753
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:25,151
To do what you can't.

754
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:29,906
To remove those in your way.

755
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,828
The board members.

756
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,497
You killed them.

757
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:40,291
We killed them.

758
01:13:40,562 --> 01:13:41,762
We?

759
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:43,336
Remember?

760
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:46,172
Your little accident
in the laboratory.

761
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,800
The performance enhancers.

762
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:55,014
Bingo. Me!
Your greatest creation.

763
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:59,310
Bringing you
what you've always wanted:

764
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:02,355
Power beyond your wildest dreams.

765
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:05,024
And it's only the beginning.

766
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:10,863
There's only one who can stop us.

767
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:15,159
Or imagine if he joined us.

768
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:23,042
Spider-Man. And the Green Goblin.

769
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:26,545
The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.

770
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,339
These weirdos
all gotta have a name.

771
01:14:28,506 --> 01:14:29,715
Mr. Jameson, Spider...

772
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,550
- Hoffman!
- Yeah?

773
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:36,472
Copyright the name "Green Goblin."
I want a quarter every time it's said.

774
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:37,839
How about "Green Meanie"?

775
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:42,061
Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city.
That's slander.

776
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:44,563
It is not. I resent that.

777
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:47,566
Slander is spoken.
In print, it's libel.

778
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:49,402
You don't trust anybody.

779
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,612
I trust my barber.

780
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:53,990
What are you, his lawyer? Get out.

781
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:56,283
Let him sue me,
get rich like a normal person.

782
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,202
That's what made this country...

783
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:09,547
Jameson, you slime.

784
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:13,050
Who's the photographer
who takes the pictures of Spider-Man?

785
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:15,094
I don't know.
His stuff comes by mail.

786
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:17,179
- You're lying!
- I swear.

787
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,348
He's the one
who can bring me to him.

788
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:22,435
- I don't know who he is.
- You are useless.

789
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:24,895
Set him down, tough guy.

790
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:29,150
- Speak of the devil.
- I knew you two were in this together!

791
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:32,528
Hey, kiddo, let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute, will you?

792
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:35,197
Sleep...

793
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:53,674
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.

794
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:58,262
No, you're not dead yet.

795
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,639
Just paralyzed...

796
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,767
...temporarily.

797
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:06,854
You're an amazing creature,
Spider-Man.

798
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:09,732
You and I are not so different.

799
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:13,778
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.

800
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,864
Well, to each his own.

801
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:19,992
I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.

802
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:25,289
And they found you amusing
for a while, the people of this city.

803
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:28,751
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...

804
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:32,546
...is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.

805
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:37,343
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

806
01:16:37,489 --> 01:16:38,689
Why bother?

807
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:43,432
- Because it's right.
- Here's the real truth.

808
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:46,852
There are eight million people
in this city.

809
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:51,357
And those teeming masses exist
for the sole purpose...

810
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:55,528
...of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.

811
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:57,113
You, me...

812
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,615
...we're exceptional.

813
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:04,537
I could squash you like a bug
right now.

814
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:08,374
But I'm offering you a choice.
Join me.

815
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:12,169
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

816
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:15,131
What we could create.

817
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:17,716
Or we could destroy.

818
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:21,846
Cause the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish battle...

819
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:24,473
...again and again and again until
we're both dead.

820
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,934
Is that what you want?

821
01:17:28,936 --> 01:17:31,814
Think about it, hero.

822
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:49,123
<i>In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.</i>

823
01:17:58,195 --> 01:17:59,395
Hey!

824
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:00,926
- It's me again.
- Hey!

825
01:18:01,302 --> 01:18:02,720
How was your audition?

826
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:05,931
- How'd you know?
- The hot line. Your morn...

827
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:08,058
...told my aunt, told me.

828
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:09,852
So you just came by?

829
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:13,689
I was in the neighbourhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.

830
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:17,568
I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighbourhood, but...

831
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,196
So how'd it go?

832
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:24,950
They said I needed acting lessons.

833
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:28,871
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.

834
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:34,376
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.

835
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,796
I'd like a cheeseburger.

836
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:41,717
Oh, but I'm going out to dinner
with Harry.

837
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:43,552
Come with us.

838
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:46,472
No, thanks. How's it going with...?

839
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,893
Never mind.
That's none of my business.

840
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:52,895
It's not?

841
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:55,981
Why so interested?

842
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:58,150
I'm not.

843
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,777
You're not?

844
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:04,156
- Well, why would I be?
- I don't know.

845
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:06,200
Why would you be?

846
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:10,412
I, that's a...

847
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:12,122
I don't know.

848
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:17,169
Sorry you won't come with us.

849
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,590
I better run, tiger.

850
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,309
Hey, check it out, man.

851
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:34,144
Come on, man.

852
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:40,943
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!

853
01:19:58,836 --> 01:20:00,296
Get off me!

854
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:35,080
Wait!

855
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:42,296
You have a knack
for getting in trouble.

856
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:46,842
You have a knack for saving my life.
I think I have a superhero stalker.

857
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:48,927
I was in the neighbourhood.

858
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:53,432
You are amazing.

859
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:57,102
Some people don't think so.

860
01:20:58,187 --> 01:21:01,190
- But you are.
- Nice to have a fan.

861
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:05,152
Do I get to say thank you this time?

862
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:07,529
Wait.

863
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:18,684
Let me in! My baby's in there!

864
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:20,936
- Let me go!
- The roof's collapsing!

865
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:24,606
- Somebody save my baby!
- The roof's about to collapse!

866
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:26,150
Look! Up there!

867
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:34,616
Save my baby, please!

868
01:22:58,307 --> 01:22:59,507
No!

869
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:11,195
- It's okay. Your baby's fine.
- Oh, my baby!

870
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:15,157
God bless you, Spider-Man.
Bless you.

871
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,117
Don't let him get away!

872
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:20,579
Hold it! You're under arrest.
I'm taking you in.

873
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:22,998
Oh, my God, there's somebody
still up there!

874
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:26,450
I'm going.

875
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:31,590
- I'll be here when you get back.
- Not coming back, chief.

876
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:33,207
Go! Go!

877
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:43,769
Where are you?

878
01:23:45,812 --> 01:23:47,397
Where are you?

879
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:55,155
I'm gonna get you out of here!

880
01:23:57,741 --> 01:23:59,243
It's okay.

881
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,877
You're pathetically predictable.

882
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:10,963
Like a moth to the flame.

883
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:14,299
What about my generous proposal?

884
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:18,178
Are you in or are you out?

885
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:20,973
It's you who's out, Gobby.
Out of your mind.

886
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:23,392
Wrong answer.

887
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:26,228
Oh, great.

888
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:07,686
No one says no to me!

889
01:25:15,027 --> 01:25:18,447
- M.J., will you stop goofing around?
- Harry, relax.

890
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,200
He's here.

891
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:25,621
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

892
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:28,999
Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.

893
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:32,294
Work was murder.
I picked up a fruitcake.

894
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:35,839
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.

895
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:38,884
Who is this lovely young lady?

896
01:25:39,051 --> 01:25:43,347
I'd like you to meet my father.
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.

897
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:46,224
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

898
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:50,145
- Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
- Now, where is Peter?

899
01:25:50,312 --> 01:25:52,689
He'd better have remembered
that cranberry sauce.

900
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:02,032
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.

901
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:06,536
Peter?

902
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:12,834
Peter?

903
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:16,296
Is that you?

904
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:25,931
How strange. There's nobody here.

905
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:36,900
- Bit of a slob, isn't he?
- All brilliant men are.

906
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:12,102
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, Peter!

907
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:14,104
Sorry I'm late,
it's a jungle out there.

908
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:18,108
I had to beat an old lady with a stick
to get these cranberries.

909
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:21,403
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...

910
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,155
...and we can say grace.

911
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,324
Parker.

912
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,452
Here we go.

913
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:37,753
- There we are.
- It looks delicious.

914
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,755
Norman.

915
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:43,842
Will you do the honours?

916
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,774
Why, Peter, you're bleeding.

917
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:02,360
Oh, yeah...

918
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:06,948
I stepped off a kerb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

919
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:08,658
Well, let me see.

920
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:10,452
Oh, my goodness.

921
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:13,038
- Oh, that looks awful.
- No, it's nothing.

922
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:16,333
I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.

923
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:21,838
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving
here, and we'll do things properly.

924
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:25,884
How did you say that happened?

925
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:28,011
Bike messenger.

926
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,180
Knocked me down.

927
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:39,314
- If you'll excuse me, I've got to go.
- Why?

928
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:43,527
Something
has come to my attention.

929
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:44,986
Are you all right?

930
01:28:45,195 --> 01:28:48,698
I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.

931
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,701
- Enjoy the fruitcake.
- Dad!

932
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:57,666
I planned this so you'd meet M.J.,
and now you have to leave?

933
01:28:57,874 --> 01:28:59,584
I've got to go.

934
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:04,005
- This girl is important to me.
- Harry, please. Look at her.

935
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:08,176
Think she's sniffing around
because she likes your personality?

936
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:11,429
- What are you saying?
- Your mother was beautiful too.

937
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:12,796
They're all beautiful.

938
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:17,018
Until they're snarling after your trust
fund like a pack of ravening wolves.

939
01:29:17,227 --> 01:29:18,520
You're wrong about her, Dad.

940
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:22,190
A word to the not-so-wise
about your little girlfriend:

941
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:25,068
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

942
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:39,207
Thanks for sticking up for me,
Harry.

943
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:42,377
- You heard?
- Everyone heard that creep.

944
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:46,464
That creep is my father.
With luck, I'll be half of what he is.

945
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:49,050
Shut up about stuff
you don't understand!

946
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:50,886
Harry Osborn!

947
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:54,014
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

948
01:29:56,975 --> 01:30:00,312
<i>Spider-Man is all but invincible.</i>

949
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:03,648
<i>But Parker, we can destroy him.</i>

950
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:05,150
I can't.

951
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:08,320
<i>Betrayal
must not be countenanced.</i>

952
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:10,822
<i>Parker must be educated.</i>

953
01:30:12,991 --> 01:30:14,284
What do I do?

954
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:18,580
<i>Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.</i>

955
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:21,791
<i>Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.</i>

956
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:23,335
Yes?

957
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:25,420
<i>And then grant his wish.</i>

958
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:27,631
But how?

959
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:32,135
<i>The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.</i>

960
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:33,544
Tell me how!

961
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,847
<i>The heart, Osborn.</i>

962
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:39,142
<i>First, we attack his heart.</i>

963
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:44,522
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...

964
01:30:44,731 --> 01:30:47,692
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

965
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:50,946
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us...

966
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:02,082
Deliver us!

967
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:03,667
Finish it!

968
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:07,879
- Finish it!
- From evil!

969
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:15,762
Two milligrams IV.

970
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:18,807
Get the BP.

971
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:22,811
Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?
What happened?

972
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:24,354
You have to leave.

973
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:26,231
- What happened?
- Those eyes!

974
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:30,485
Those horrible yellow eyes!

975
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:37,867
He knows who I am.

976
01:32:21,828 --> 01:32:23,413
I'm sorry.

977
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:29,586
- Will she be okay?
- She's gonna be fine.

978
01:32:29,753 --> 01:32:32,422
She's been sleeping all day.

979
01:32:33,423 --> 01:32:36,176
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

980
01:32:40,346 --> 01:32:43,266
How are you?
You okay about the other night?

981
01:32:43,433 --> 01:32:47,103
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.

982
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:50,315
- Have you talked to Harry?
- He called me.

983
01:32:50,774 --> 01:32:52,942
I haven't called him back.

984
01:32:55,028 --> 01:32:56,738
The fact is...

985
01:32:57,906 --> 01:33:00,742
- ...I'm in love with somebody else.
- You are?

986
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:02,118
At least I think I am.

987
01:33:04,788 --> 01:33:07,832
- It's not the right time to talk about it.
- No. Go on.

988
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:11,252
Would I know his name, this guy?

989
01:33:11,461 --> 01:33:14,339
You'll think I'm a stupid little girl
with a crush.

990
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:15,882
Trust me.

991
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:17,383
It's funny.

992
01:33:19,385 --> 01:33:22,764
He's saved my life twice,
and I've never even seen his face.

993
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:26,893
- Oh. Him.
- You're laughing at me.

994
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:30,063
No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.

995
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:33,566
But do you think it's true, all the
terrible things they say about him?

996
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:37,654
No, no. Not Spider-Man,
not a chance in the world.

997
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:39,489
I know him a little bit.

998
01:33:39,697 --> 01:33:42,575
I'm sort of his unofficial
photographer.

999
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:45,912
- Has he mentioned me?
- Yeah.

1000
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:47,705
What'd he say?

1001
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:49,624
I said...

1002
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:55,004
He asked me
what I thought about you.

1003
01:33:55,922 --> 01:33:57,966
And what did you say?

1004
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:02,762
I said, "Spider-Man."

1005
01:34:03,096 --> 01:34:07,976
I said, "The great thing about M.J...

1006
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:09,727
...is...

1007
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:13,898
...when you look in her eyes...

1008
01:34:16,442 --> 01:34:19,654
...and she's looking back in yours...

1009
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:23,658
...everything feels...

1010
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:26,703
...not quite normal.

1011
01:34:27,954 --> 01:34:29,747
Because you feel...

1012
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:31,916
...stronger...

1013
01:34:33,459 --> 01:34:37,088
...and weaker at the same time.

1014
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:40,258
You feel excited...

1015
01:34:41,134 --> 01:34:43,178
...and at the same time...

1016
01:34:43,803 --> 01:34:45,430
...terrified.

1017
01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:52,061
The truth is, you don't know
what you feel...

1018
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:57,108
...except you know what kind of man
you want to be.

1019
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:01,696
It's as if you've...

1020
01:35:02,322 --> 01:35:05,491
...reached the unreachable...

1021
01:35:07,076 --> 01:35:09,787
...and you weren't ready for it."

1022
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:15,001
You said that?

1023
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:18,129
Well, something like that.

1024
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:03,925
Dad?

1025
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:11,349
Dad, is that you?

1026
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:19,440
What is it?

1027
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:26,698
Well, you were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.

1028
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:30,410
She's in love with Peter.

1029
01:36:30,702 --> 01:36:32,495
- Parker?
- Yeah.

1030
01:36:32,662 --> 01:36:34,622
And how does he feel about her?

1031
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:39,752
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

1032
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:45,967
He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.

1033
01:36:48,886 --> 01:36:50,638
I'm so sorry.

1034
01:36:53,099 --> 01:36:56,561
I haven't always been there for you,
have I?

1035
01:36:58,313 --> 01:37:01,524
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.

1036
01:37:01,733 --> 01:37:03,526
That's no excuse.

1037
01:37:04,527 --> 01:37:06,321
I'm proud of you.

1038
01:37:06,863 --> 01:37:11,743
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'll make it up to you.

1039
01:37:11,909 --> 01:37:15,246
I'm going to rectify
certain inequities.

1040
01:37:29,302 --> 01:37:31,095
<i>Wake up, little spider.</i>

1041
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:32,764
Wake up.

1042
01:37:34,098 --> 01:37:35,683
Go home, dear.

1043
01:37:35,892 --> 01:37:37,226
You look awful.

1044
01:37:37,435 --> 01:37:39,729
- And you look beautiful.
- Well, thank you.

1045
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:43,232
- I don't like to leave you here.
- But I'm safe here.

1046
01:37:43,399 --> 01:37:46,110
- Can I do anything for you?
- You do too much.

1047
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:51,824
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.

1048
01:37:52,575 --> 01:37:54,327
A smile. Finally.

1049
01:37:54,494 --> 01:37:57,747
Haven't seen one of those on
your face since Mary Jane was here.

1050
01:37:57,914 --> 01:38:01,292
Hey.
You were supposed to be asleep.

1051
01:38:02,085 --> 01:38:06,881
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J.'s family moved in next door.

1052
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:11,052
And when she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...

1053
01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:17,558
...you grabbed me and said,
"Aunt May, is that an angel?"

1054
01:38:17,767 --> 01:38:21,312
- Gee, did I say that?
- You sure did.

1055
01:38:23,981 --> 01:38:26,734
Well, Harry's in love with her.

1056
01:38:26,943 --> 01:38:30,696
- She's still his girl.
- Well, isn't that up to her?

1057
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:35,493
- She doesn't really know who I am.
- Because you won't let her.

1058
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:38,830
You're so mysterious all the time.

1059
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:41,833
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...

1060
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:46,003
...to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?

1061
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:48,923
Everybody else knows.

1062
01:38:51,968 --> 01:38:53,219
I'll be right back.

1063
01:38:53,886 --> 01:38:55,179
But...

1064
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,522
Come on, pick up.

1065
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:07,984
<i>- Hey, M.J...
- Sing your song at the beep.</i>

1066
01:39:09,026 --> 01:39:11,070
M.J., it's Peter. You there?

1067
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:14,198
Hello? You there?

1068
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:19,203
I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?

1069
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:20,788
All right, well...

1070
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:22,248
Don't...

1071
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:25,251
Don't go up any dark alleys.

1072
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:26,961
Hello?

1073
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:33,092
<i>Can Spider-Man come out to play?</i>

1074
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:35,052
Where is she?

1075
01:40:21,307 --> 01:40:22,975
- What is that?
- That's cool!

1076
01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:27,813
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the water spout</i>

1077
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:32,151
<i>Down came the goblin
And took the spider out</i>

1078
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,670
Goblin, what have you done?

1079
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:37,008
Spider-Man!
This is why only fools are heroes.

1080
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:39,010
Because you never know...

1081
01:41:39,218 --> 01:41:44,015
...when some lunatic will come along
with a sadistic choice:

1082
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:47,685
Let die the woman you love...

1083
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:57,153
...or suffer the little children.

1084
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:01,991
- Spider-Man!
- Save us!

1085
01:42:02,533 --> 01:42:04,785
Save us!

1086
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:07,622
Make your choice, Spider-Man...

1087
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:11,208
...and see how a hero is rewarded.

1088
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:13,461
Don't do it, Goblin!

1089
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:16,547
We are who we choose to be.

1090
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:19,550
- Now, choose!
- No!

1091
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:49,830
Everybody stay still!

1092
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:00,675
Ahoy up there!

1093
01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:03,761
We're gonna bring the barge
right under you.

1094
01:43:11,268 --> 01:43:15,398
- He's coming back!
- Listen. I need you to climb down.

1095
01:43:15,564 --> 01:43:17,066
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

1096
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:25,199
M.J., you can do it. You have to.

1097
01:43:25,366 --> 01:43:26,951
Trust me.

1098
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:32,289
Hold on tight and go quickly.

1099
01:43:36,627 --> 01:43:38,671
- Hurry!
- I can't. I can't do it.

1100
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:40,548
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1101
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:11,620
- He's not gonna make it.
- He's gonna make it!

1102
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:24,717
It's time to die.

1103
01:44:31,724 --> 01:44:34,185
Come on up here, tough guy,
I got something for you!

1104
01:44:34,351 --> 01:44:35,561
We ought to kick your ass!

1105
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:39,148
Leave Spider-Man alone! You're
gonna pick on a guy saving kids?

1106
01:44:39,815 --> 01:44:41,275
I got something for your ass!

1107
01:44:41,442 --> 01:44:43,319
Mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!

1108
01:44:43,486 --> 01:44:45,946
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!

1109
01:44:59,543 --> 01:45:01,337
Spider-Man, watch out!

1110
01:45:33,202 --> 01:45:37,456
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.

1111
01:45:38,374 --> 01:45:41,001
I offered you friendship...

1112
01:45:41,168 --> 01:45:43,045
...and you spat in my face.

1113
01:46:34,138 --> 01:46:37,808
You've spun your last web,
Spider-Man.

1114
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:41,312
Had you not been so selfish,
your little girlfriend's death...

1115
01:46:41,478 --> 01:46:43,188
...would have been quick
and painless.

1116
01:46:43,355 --> 01:46:46,734
But now that you've really
pissed me off...

1117
01:46:46,984 --> 01:46:51,864
...I'm gonna finish her
nice and slow.

1118
01:46:56,452 --> 01:46:58,495
M.J. and I...

1119
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:02,625
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.

1120
01:47:56,428 --> 01:47:57,972
Peter, stop!

1121
01:47:58,138 --> 01:48:00,599
Stop! It's me.

1122
01:48:09,566 --> 01:48:10,985
Mr. Osborn.

1123
01:48:11,193 --> 01:48:12,778
Peter, thank God for you.

1124
01:48:12,987 --> 01:48:15,280
You killed those people
on that balcony.

1125
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:18,534
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!

1126
01:48:18,701 --> 01:48:20,452
Don't let him take me again.

1127
01:48:20,619 --> 01:48:22,663
I beg you. Protect me.

1128
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:26,375
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.

1129
01:48:26,583 --> 01:48:28,085
But not you.

1130
01:48:28,752 --> 01:48:32,715
I tried to stop it.
But I couldn't stop it.

1131
01:48:32,923 --> 01:48:35,009
I would never hurt you.

1132
01:48:35,217 --> 01:48:37,136
I knew from the beginning...

1133
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:40,264
...if anything ever happened to me...

1134
01:48:40,431 --> 01:48:42,599
...it was you I could count on.

1135
01:48:42,766 --> 01:48:46,103
You, Peter Parker, would save me,
and so you have.

1136
01:48:46,687 --> 01:48:48,522
Thank God for you.

1137
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:50,941
Give me your hand.

1138
01:48:52,109 --> 01:48:55,529
Believe in me
as I believed in you.

1139
01:48:56,947 --> 01:48:59,742
I've been like a father to you.

1140
01:49:01,285 --> 01:49:02,953
Be a son to me now.

1141
01:49:04,747 --> 01:49:06,623
I have a father.

1142
01:49:07,374 --> 01:49:09,877
His name was Ben Parker.

1143
01:49:11,754 --> 01:49:13,213
Godspeed, Spider-Man.

1144
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:33,650
Peter.

1145
01:49:35,986 --> 01:49:37,279
Don't tell Harry.

1146
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,230
What have you done?

1147
01:50:11,396 --> 01:50:12,981
What have you done?!

1148
01:50:36,255 --> 01:50:37,756
Hey.

1149
01:50:41,135 --> 01:50:43,178
I'm so sorry, Harry.

1150
01:50:44,096 --> 01:50:47,224
I know what it's like
to lose a father.

1151
01:50:49,393 --> 01:50:52,688
I didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.

1152
01:50:54,273 --> 01:50:56,567
One day Spider-Man will pay.

1153
01:50:58,443 --> 01:51:01,572
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

1154
01:51:06,577 --> 01:51:08,412
Thank God for you, Peter.

1155
01:51:09,121 --> 01:51:11,582
You're the only family I have.

1156
01:51:36,106 --> 01:51:38,400
<i>No matter what I do...</i>

1157
01:51:38,567 --> 01:51:41,695
<i>...no matter how hard I try...</i>

1158
01:51:42,279 --> 01:51:46,116
<i>...the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.</i>

1159
01:51:56,835 --> 01:51:59,171
You must miss him so much.

1160
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:03,175
It's been so hard without him.

1161
01:52:06,094 --> 01:52:08,972
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

1162
01:52:10,766 --> 01:52:12,601
When I was up there...

1163
01:52:13,310 --> 01:52:16,104
...and I thought I was gonna die...

1164
01:52:17,731 --> 01:52:20,484
...there was only one person
who I was thinking of.

1165
01:52:22,861 --> 01:52:26,073
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.

1166
01:52:27,532 --> 01:52:29,493
It was you, Pete.

1167
01:52:30,827 --> 01:52:32,704
I kept thinking:

1168
01:52:33,121 --> 01:52:35,916
"I hope I make it through this...

1169
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:41,755
...so I can see Peter Parker's face
one more time."

1170
01:52:43,131 --> 01:52:44,633
Really?

1171
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:50,806
There's only one man
who's always been there for me...

1172
01:52:52,057 --> 01:52:54,017
...who makes me feel...

1173
01:52:54,476 --> 01:52:58,188
...like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.

1174
01:53:00,315 --> 01:53:01,984
That I'm just...

1175
01:53:02,651 --> 01:53:04,152
...me.

1176
01:53:05,237 --> 01:53:07,155
And that's okay.

1177
01:53:09,324 --> 01:53:10,826
The truth is...

1178
01:53:12,953 --> 01:53:14,746
...I love you.

1179
01:53:16,832 --> 01:53:18,792
I love you so much, Peter.

1180
01:53:39,479 --> 01:53:44,276
<i>All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.</i>

1181
01:53:44,443 --> 01:53:46,361
I can't.

1182
01:53:48,488 --> 01:53:50,032
You can't what?

1183
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:52,617
Tell you...

1184
01:53:54,328 --> 01:53:58,582
...everything.
I mean, there's so much to tell.

1185
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:03,670
Yeah. There's so much to tell.

1186
01:54:04,588 --> 01:54:06,590
I want you to know...

1187
01:54:06,965 --> 01:54:09,634
...that I will always be there
for you.

1188
01:54:09,843 --> 01:54:13,805
I will always be there
to take care of you.

1189
01:54:14,806 --> 01:54:16,808
I promise you that.

1190
01:54:20,103 --> 01:54:22,397
I will always be your friend.

1191
01:54:25,317 --> 01:54:27,194
Only a friend...

1192
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:29,613
...Peter Parker?

1193
01:54:31,782 --> 01:54:34,618
That's all I have to give.

1194
01:55:00,977 --> 01:55:03,647
<i>Whatever life holds in store
for me...</i>

1195
01:55:03,814 --> 01:55:06,691
<i>...I will never forget these words:</i>

1196
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:11,947
<i>"With great power
comes great responsibility."</i>

1197
01:55:12,114 --> 01:55:14,366
<i>This is my gift.</i>

1198
01:55:14,533 --> 01:55:16,660
<i>My curse.</i>

1199
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:19,079
<i>Who am I?</i>

1200
01:55:19,454 --> 01:55:20,831
<i>I'm Spider-Man.</i>
