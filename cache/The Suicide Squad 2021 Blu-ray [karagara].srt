00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:40,299
Not today, you don't.
You're up.

15
00:01:44,436 --> 00:01:45,671
You know the deal.

16
00:01:45,703 --> 00:01:46,905
Successfully complete
the mission,

17
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:48,607
you get ten years
off your sentence.

18
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:53,745
<i>You fail to follow my orders
in any way</i>

19
00:01:53,778 --> 00:01:57,649
<i>and I detonate
the explosive device

20
00:01:57,683 --> 00:01:59,218
Good dog.

21
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:00,720
<i>We are
a black ops unit.</i>

22
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:03,256
<i>Meaning, nothing you see here
ever happened.</i>

23
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,258
Savant.

24
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,858
<i>Your commanding officer
will be Colonel Rick Flag.</i>

25
00:02:06,891 --> 00:02:08,827
Or would you
rather be called Durlin?

26
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,695
I'd rather not
be called at all.

27
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,666
But I'll do anything
to get out of this hellhole.

28
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,872
Well,
welcome to "anything."

29
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,845
So this is
the famous Suicide Squad.

30
00:02:25,877 --> 00:02:28,513
Well, we consider
that term degrading.

31
00:02:28,546 --> 00:02:30,815
The official term
is "Task Force X."

32
00:02:30,848 --> 00:02:32,684
And love 'em or hate 'em,

33
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:34,586
these are your brothers and
sisters for the next few days.

34
00:02:37,723 --> 00:02:39,792
Oh!

35
00:02:40,758 --> 00:02:41,793
Whoa.

36
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:57,410
Captain Boomerang.

37
00:02:58,644 --> 00:02:59,913
Blackguard.

38
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:01,813
Mongal.

39
00:03:03,014 --> 00:03:04,249
Javelin.

40
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:07,187
T.D.K.

41
00:03:08,653 --> 00:03:09,655
Weasel.

42
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:13,558
And, of course...

43
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:15,928
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
Had to go number two.

44
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:17,397
Hmm, good to know.

45
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:19,532
Flag.

46
00:03:19,564 --> 00:03:21,399
Oh, sorry. Comin' through.

47
00:03:21,432 --> 00:03:22,734
Hey, Boomer.

48
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:24,437
What are you doing back
in prison, Harls?

49
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:26,571
I got road rage. In a bank.

50
00:03:26,604 --> 00:03:28,673
Oh. So sorry. Comin' through.

51
00:03:28,706 --> 00:03:31,276
Turn it around. There. No.
- There? Here?

52
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,012
Put it in there.
Now you're safe.

53
00:03:33,044 --> 00:03:34,579
All right.

54
00:03:34,612 --> 00:03:36,248
Thanks, man.

55
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:39,319
Prepare for liftoff.
And away we go.

56
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:48,260
Harley and T.D.K...
- Digger.

57
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,562
...have they worked
together before?

58
00:03:49,594 --> 00:03:50,729
Not yet. I'm excited.

59
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:51,764
What does
Savant do again?

60
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:53,398
It's Brian Durlin.

61
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:55,734
He's an expert in weapons
and hand-to-hand combat.

62
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,004
Yeah, well, I'm putting 20
on him that he's gonna bite it.

63
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,572
Me too. And Weasel,

64
00:03:59,604 --> 00:04:01,273
Boomer and Mongal.
- Yeah, I think...

65
00:04:01,306 --> 00:04:03,508
Is Mongal an alien
or some type of god?

66
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:04,877
What are you doing?
- Oh. Hey.

67
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:06,311
Just making sure
everything was ready to go.

68
00:04:06,344 --> 00:04:07,612
Good meeting, everybody.

69
00:04:07,645 --> 00:04:09,381
Just our normal,
casual morning meeting.

70
00:04:09,414 --> 00:04:10,649
Yeah, I just gotta, uh,
do this thing.

71
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:11,916
Nothing weird about it.

72
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:12,984
Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

73
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:17,956
Flag.

74
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,292
<i>Yeah, we're Tminus five
from the drop.</i>

75
00:04:19,324 --> 00:04:20,325
Get the whole team safely

76
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:21,860
<i>to that beach, Colonel.</i>

77
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,997
<i>You will receive
further orders once there.</i>

78
00:04:39,077 --> 00:04:41,546
We're in
a butcher's freezer, Harls,

79
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:44,983
surrounded by dead hogs
hangin' on hooks.

80
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:46,618
Only they don't know it yet.

81
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:49,421
Leave him alone, Boomer.

82
00:04:49,454 --> 00:04:51,423
What does T.D.K. stand for?

83
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:52,490
What?

84
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:54,927
Your name is T.D.K., correct?

85
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,494
Yeah.

86
00:04:56,528 --> 00:04:58,064
And it stands for what?

87
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:00,566
It stands for me.

88
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:01,933
It's what a name is.

89
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:03,935
Your name is letters?

90
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:05,971
All names are letters,
dickhead.

91
00:05:10,908 --> 00:05:12,510
I love your accent.

92
00:05:12,543 --> 00:05:14,512
American women
all love accents.

93
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:17,349
We do.
'Cause we don't got none.

94
00:05:19,584 --> 00:05:21,986
Yo, is this a dog?
- What?

95
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:24,556
Is this thing a dog?

96
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:26,558
A... A dog?
- Yes.

97
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:28,727
What kind of dog
do you think it is, mate?

98
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:30,730
I don't know, I'm not familiar
with all the breeds.

99
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:32,597
I'm gonna go with Afghan Hound.

100
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,766
Since when does an Afghan
Hound have bloody thumbs?

101
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,802
Oh, my God, is it a werewolf?

102
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:38,670
I've wanted to meet
a werewolf forever.

103
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:40,106
Yo, they sat me
next to a werewolf?

104
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,774
That's not right.

105
00:05:41,807 --> 00:05:43,142
Yo, let me out.
I do not fuck with werewolves.

106
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:45,411
Hey, hey,
he's not a werewolf, okay!

107
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:46,879
He's a weasel. He's harmless.

108
00:05:46,911 --> 00:05:49,147
I mean, he's not harmless,
he's killed 27 children,

109
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,849
but, you know, we got him to...

110
00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:52,484
I think he's agreed to do this.

111
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:53,852
Whatever the case,

112
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,721
just everyone
get into position to drop.

113
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,983
Did anyone check
on whether Weasel could swim?

114
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:40,024
The Weasel is dead! I repeat,

115
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:42,260
<i>the Weasel is dead.</i>

116
00:07:42,293 --> 00:07:44,896
Northeast, all clear.
Approach the shore.

117
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,931
<i>Over.</i>

118
00:07:45,963 --> 00:07:47,732
Savant, hold your position.

119
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,635
Roger that.

120
00:07:54,872 --> 00:07:55,941
Amateurs.

121
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,089
Waller, we're
on the beach and dry.

122
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:36,115
Blackguard. Get down, you...
- Hey, guys! Hey.

123
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,616
...there's fucking soldiers
everywhere!

124
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:39,051
You can come out now,
it's just me.

125
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,019
What the fuck
is Blackguard doin'?

126
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:42,720
I'm the one who contacted you.

127
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:44,323
Is this what's supposed
to happen? What the fuck?

128
00:08:44,355 --> 00:08:46,558
Blackguard, get back
into your position.

129
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,092
Look, look.
I brought everybody, look.

130
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,628
They're right behind me.

131
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:51,963
Whoa. Hey.

132
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:53,898
Hey, guys. Whoa.

133
00:08:53,932 --> 00:08:56,669
We got a deal, right?
Uh... Uh...

134
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:58,169
Waller, we're made.

135
00:08:58,202 --> 00:09:00,705
I'm the one who called you.

136
00:09:05,943 --> 00:09:07,912
Blackguard sold us out.

137
00:09:07,946 --> 00:09:11,617
<i>He contacted the fucking
Corto Maltese Army!</i>

138
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:12,984
<i>Waller, we need to retreat.</i>

139
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:15,053
Negative, Flag.

140
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:16,354
The mission is too important.

141
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:17,890
<i>This is a tough group.</i>

142
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:19,625
<i>You can make it.</i>
- Okey-doke.

143
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:20,826
Waller, with all due respect,
we're in the middle

144
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:21,994
of a goddamn... Harley, wait!

145
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:23,262
Whoo-hoo!

146
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:06,004
Zero-two-two-seven
is wide open.

147
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,673
Colonel, dispatch

148
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:09,909
<i>The Detachable Kid.</i>
- T.D.K., two o'clock!

149
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:15,046
T.D.K. is "The Detachable Kid"?

150
00:10:34,298 --> 00:10:36,434
What the fuck?

151
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:38,703
I didn't pick the damn team!

152
00:10:38,736 --> 00:10:42,006
Don't worry, Flag,
I got the bird.

153
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:44,676
Mongal! Don't.

154
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:48,413
Huh?

155
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,027
Strewth!

156
00:11:05,263 --> 00:11:06,132
Boomer!

157
00:11:36,293 --> 00:11:38,329
Savant is off the rails.

158
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:40,266
Savant, turn back.

159
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:45,738
<i>Savant.</i>

160
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:51,476
Savant, I'm warning you,
this is desertion.

161
00:11:53,144 --> 00:11:54,412
Savant!

162
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:57,282
This is your last chance.
Turn back around.

163
00:11:57,315 --> 00:11:59,285
<i>You are in violation
of your agreement!</i>

164
00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:03,888
<i>Oh, please! No.</i>

165
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,061
Damn it.

166
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:26,111
How's Team Two holding up?

167
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,083
Team Two, check.
Set point bravo.

168
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:35,187
All troops on the south beach
are engaged.

169
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,256
Team Two is clear to go
on the north beach.

170
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,160
Congratulations, Bloodsport.

171
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:57,141
How'd you do it, Waller?

172
00:12:57,174 --> 00:12:59,577
<i>There's no soldiers out here
on patrol at all.</i>

173
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,247

Here you go, champ.

213
00:15:26,658 --> 00:15:27,960
Excuse me.

214
00:15:30,128 --> 00:15:32,031
Who the fuck is Bloodsport?

215
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,300
Robert DuBois.

216
00:15:35,332 --> 00:15:37,535
A world-class marksman.

217
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:40,404
In his hands,
anything is a deadly weapon.

218
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:42,239
His father was a mercenary

219
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:45,210
who trained his son to kill
from the moment he was born.

220
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:47,746
He's in prison for putting
Superman in the ICU

221
00:15:47,778 --> 00:15:50,181
with a kryptonite bullet.

222
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,251
DuBois?
- Same answer as the last time.

223
00:15:53,283 --> 00:15:54,285
Piss off.

224
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,324
I'm not joining your goddamn
Suicide Squad.

225
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,092
We'll see.

226
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,627
You have a visitor.

227
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,145
They said you got in trouble.

228
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:22,513
<i>I stole.</i>

229
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:23,615
You stole what?

230
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,253
<i>A style watch.</i>
- A star latch?

231
00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:31,756
A style watch.
You can watch TV on it.

232
00:16:31,789 --> 00:16:33,724
<i>Why would you want to
watch TV on your watch?</i>

233
00:16:33,758 --> 00:16:35,427
I don't know.

234
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,095
<i>Next time you want
to nick something,</i>

235
00:16:37,128 --> 00:16:38,230
<i>you take a partner,</i>

236
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:39,431
<i>and they can be your lookout.</i>

237
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:41,466
<i>That's your advice?</i>

238
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:42,534
<i>Yeah.</i>

239
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:44,569
<i>You're a terrible father.</i>

240
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:46,037
<i>Hey, I didn't ask
to be a father
in the first place.</i>

241
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,339
<i>You make that perfectly clear.</i>

242
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:49,373
Your mother sprung
that one on me.

243
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,742
<i>Well, she's not around anymore,</i>

244
00:16:50,774 --> 00:16:52,043
<i>so you can lay off
of her, okay?</i>

245
00:16:52,076 --> 00:16:53,411
<i>Oh, I tried to lay off her,</i>

246
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,047
but then she dragged out
the paternity test.

247
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,548
<i>Fuck you!
- No, fuck you!</i>

248
00:16:56,581 --> 00:16:58,083
<i>Fuck you!
- Fuck you!</i>

249
00:16:58,115 --> 00:16:59,450
Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

250
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:01,119
<i>Fuck you!</i>
- Fuck you!

251
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:02,554
<i>Fuck you!</i>

252
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:04,722
I can't believe
you don't care that I stole,

253
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:06,458
only that I got caught!

254
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,792
I don't only care
that you got caught,

255
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,394
I care that you got caught
for stealing

256
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:12,296
something as stupid
as a fucking TV watch!

257
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:14,231
It does other things too!

258
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:15,734
<i>But nothing that your phone
can't fucking do!</i>

259
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:16,768
<i>It's embarrassing!</i>

260
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,402
<i>No, what's fucking embarrassing</i>

261
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:20,671
<i>is having you as my father.</i>

262
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,849
<i>Yeah, well, I told you, Tyla,</i>

263
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,617
<i>when I came here
that any goodness</i>

264
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,421
I ever had in me had been
wrung out bare by my old man.

265
00:17:36,453 --> 00:17:38,622
And I also told you to go out
there and do your own thing

266
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:40,257
and stay far away

267
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,561
<i>from me or anyone like me,
didn't I?</i>

268
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,630
So, why are you here
when you and I both know

269
00:17:45,663 --> 00:17:47,666
I have nothing good
to offer you?

270
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:53,270
<i>Because my court date
is coming up,</i>

271
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:56,508
<i>and Miss Waller said
maybe you could help me out.</i>

272
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,876
To get me to lead
your shite fucking mission,

273
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,879
you're gonna send
my 14year-old daughter
to prison?

274
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:02,114
No.

275
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,784
Your daughter is 16, DuBois.

276
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:07,486
You're a real
father of the year.

277
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,187
Fine. You know what,
Tyla needs to grow up anyway

278
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,589
'cause she's a little ditzy
like her fucking mother.

279
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:13,125
So, a year in juvie,
no fucking problem.

280
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:16,227
Not juvie. Being 16
in the state of Louisiana

281
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,729
means that
under the right circumstances,

282
00:18:18,762 --> 00:18:20,431
she could be tried as an adult.

283
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:21,832
And, if convicted,

284
00:18:21,865 --> 00:18:25,903
could be sent right here
to old Belle Reve.

285
00:18:25,936 --> 00:18:28,339
And in here, well, you never
know what might happen

286
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,408
to a frail young thing
like that.

287
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:32,844
Shames me to say

288
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:34,845
that we have
the highest mortality rate

289
00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:37,315
in the entire
U.S. prison system.

290
00:18:40,384 --> 00:18:41,685
Whoa, hey, hey, hey!

291
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:43,288
You're threatening
my fucking daughter!

292
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,156
I'm protecting this country.

293
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,925
Everyone stand down.
- Miss Waller, I...

294
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,927
Stand down!

295
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,734
I wouldn't take
such extreme measures...

296
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,636
Oh, extreme?
Oh, yeah, a little extreme.

297
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,538
...if this mission
weren't more important

298
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,172
than you could
possibly imagine.

299
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:02,606
Fuck your mission.

300
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,376
You have the military
experience necessary,

301
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,811
and everything in your
psychological profile tells me

302
00:19:06,844 --> 00:19:08,413
you have what it takes
to be a leader.

303
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:10,281
No, I'm no fucking leader!

304
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,284
Then I'll make you one.

305
00:19:15,586 --> 00:19:18,589
Are you in or out?

306
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:25,531
Good. Let's meet your team.

307
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:28,867
Come on.
- Fuck me, man.

308
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:31,835
Let's go.

309
00:19:31,868 --> 00:19:33,237
She was gonna kill his kid?

310
00:19:36,473 --> 00:19:38,709
Each member
of the team is chosen

311
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:42,446
for his or her own completely
unique set of abilities.

312
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,484
This is Christopher Smith,
known as Peacemaker.

313
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:49,221
In his hands,
anything is a deadly weapon.

314
00:19:49,253 --> 00:19:51,322
His father was a soldier
who trained his son

315
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:53,324
how to kill from the moment
he was born.

316
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:55,326
Are you having a laugh?
- What?

317
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,994
You just said each member
of the team is chosen

318
00:19:57,028 --> 00:19:59,664
for their unique abilities.
He does exactly what I do.

319
00:19:59,696 --> 00:20:00,965
But better.

320
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,300
I always hit
my targets dead center.

321
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,735
I hit them more in the center.

322
00:20:03,768 --> 00:20:04,936
Well, you can't hit something
more in a center.

323
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:06,438
I use smaller bullets.
- What?

324
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,672
They go inside
your bullet holes

325
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:08,839
without even touching the side.

326
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:11,509
Next up is King Shark.

327
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,509
Holy shit.

328
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:14,778
What the fuck?

329
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:16,480
Some people claim

330
00:20:16,513 --> 00:20:19,350
that Nanaue is a descendant
of an ancient shark god.

331
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,553
Whatever the case,
he's strong and deadly.

332
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:23,288
Does it talk?

333
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,389
Book read.
- Wow.

334
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:26,725
Book's upside-down.

335
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,026
See that? It's pretending
to read a book.

336
00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:32,663
So smart, me.
Enjoy book so much.

337
00:20:32,696 --> 00:20:33,998
Be a mite careful,

338
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:35,799
as he's developed a taste
for human meat.

339
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:36,768
Huh?

340
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,370
Next, we have Cleo Cazo,

341
00:20:39,403 --> 00:20:41,739
Ratcatcher 2.

342
00:20:41,772 --> 00:20:43,407
Settle down!

343
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:44,676
Ooh.

344
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:46,378
What, we couldn't
afford Ratcatcher 1?

345
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,712
He's dead.
This is his daughter.

346
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:50,482
Cazo, will you be joining us?

347
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,550
I just woke up.

348
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:54,786
I don't function well
early in the morning.

349
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:57,454
My deepest apologies
for disturbing you.

350
00:20:57,488 --> 00:20:58,623
Hmm, it's all right.

351
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:00,524
Get your ass out here!

352
00:21:07,865 --> 00:21:08,967
Millennials.

353
00:21:12,636 --> 00:21:14,805
Oh, no way.

354
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:17,408
That's not coming with us.
- She controls rats.

355
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,511
I know, I caught that.
It's a disgusting superpower.

356
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,481
This is Sebastian.
Say hello, Sebastian.

357
00:21:24,515 --> 00:21:26,851
I'm not shakin' the rat's hand.

358
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:30,788
And finally,
we have Abner Krill.

359
00:21:31,788 --> 00:21:33,023
What's that 'round his neck?

360
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:34,492
A power dampener.

361
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:36,094
They call him
the Polka Dot Man.

362
00:21:36,126 --> 00:21:38,429
Polka Dot Man.

363
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:40,398
What's he do,
throw polka dots at people?

364
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,669
He does.

365
00:21:44,701 --> 00:21:46,437
He throws polka dots at people.

366
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,939
Hey, Polka Dot Man,

367
00:21:47,971 --> 00:21:50,341
I was hoping you'd entertain
my kid's birthday party.

368
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,978
You fucking pussy!

369
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,979
These are soldiers?

370
00:21:56,012 --> 00:21:57,648
We need to debrief.

371
00:22:05,722 --> 00:22:07,825
Fuck.

372
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:10,127
Corto Maltese

373
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:13,665
is a small island nation off
the coast of South America.

374
00:22:13,698 --> 00:22:15,433
Over the past 100 years,

375
00:22:15,465 --> 00:22:18,035
the country has been ruled
with an iron fist

376
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:20,471
by the Herrera family.

377
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:24,075
But, a week ago, this guy,

378
00:22:24,107 --> 00:22:27,745
General Silvio Luna,
along with his right-hand man,

379
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:30,681
Mayor General Mateo Suarez,

380
00:22:30,714 --> 00:22:33,117
took control of
the Corto Maltese government

381
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,754
in a violent military coup.

382
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:40,725
The entire Herrera family were
hanged in a public execution.

383
00:22:40,758 --> 00:22:42,827
Although the United States
did not condone

384
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:45,396
the excesses
of the Herrera regime,

385
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,466
they were non-antagonistic
toward the U.S.

386
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:52,604
Luna, however,
is virulently anti-American.

387
00:22:52,636 --> 00:22:54,004
So, you want us to kill Luna?

388
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:55,140
No.

389
00:22:55,972 --> 00:22:57,941
This is Jotunheim.

390
00:22:57,974 --> 00:23:00,477
A scientific
experimentation facility

391
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:04,848
containing something known only
as Project Starfish.

392
00:23:04,882 --> 00:23:06,885
Our intelligence sources
tell us

393
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:10,187
that Starfish
is extraterrestrial in origin.

394
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:12,791
In the hands
of the Luna regime,

395
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:17,128
it is potentially cataclysmic
for Americans and the world.

396
00:23:17,161 --> 00:23:21,633
Your mission
is to infiltrate Jotunheim

397
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:25,202
and destroy every trace
of Project Starfish.

398
00:23:25,236 --> 00:23:26,704
How are we supposed to get in?

399
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:28,840
Gaius Grieves, the Thinker,

400
00:23:28,873 --> 00:23:31,910
is a geneticist in charge
of Project Starfish.

401
00:23:31,942 --> 00:23:34,945
After hours, he hangs out
at a gentlemen's club

402
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:37,916
known as La Gatita Amable.

403
00:23:37,949 --> 00:23:40,819
Get Grieves to help you
by whatever means necessary

404
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,954
and he can get you
into Jotunheim.

405
00:23:44,154 --> 00:23:45,156
Any questions?

406
00:23:47,491 --> 00:23:49,526
What is that?

407
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,762
That is
an overhead projector.

408
00:23:51,796 --> 00:23:53,198
Do you ever use it anymore?

409
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,798
No, not really.

410
00:23:54,832 --> 00:23:56,768
So, why don't you
just throw it away?

411
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,702
Peacemaker?

412
00:23:58,736 --> 00:24:01,573
Starfish is a slang term
for a butthole.

413
00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:02,573
Think there's any connection?

414
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:06,044
No.

415
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:08,612
No...

416
00:24:08,645 --> 00:24:09,646
Nanaue.

417
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,949
...connection.

418
00:24:10,981 --> 00:24:12,549
Hand.

419
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,720
Yes, that is your hand,
Nanaue, very good.

420
00:24:18,923 --> 00:24:20,125
We're all gonna die.

421
00:24:21,157 --> 00:24:22,059
I hope so.

422
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,629
Oh, for fuck's sake.

423
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:51,655
Control, we have a disturbance
south of here.

424
00:24:51,689 --> 00:24:53,558
<i>It's just
a diversion, Bloodsport.</i>

425
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,627
All right,
we cut through the jungle
to get to Valle Del Mar.

426
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,630
Don't they have blockades
at the city limits?

427
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,298
That's the word.

428
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,633
How we getting in? Especially
with Charlie the Tuna here.

429
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:03,967
How the hell am I
supposed to know?

430
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,068
You're the leader.

431
00:25:05,102 --> 00:25:06,704
You're supposed to be decisive.

432
00:25:06,737 --> 00:25:07,839
And I've decided
that you should eat

433
00:25:07,872 --> 00:25:09,641
a big bag of dicks, how's that?

434
00:25:09,673 --> 00:25:11,608
You're being facetious,
but if this whole beach

435
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:12,744
was completely covered in dicks

436
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:14,245
and somebody said I had to eat

437
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:15,680
every dick until the beach
was clean for liberty,

438
00:25:15,712 --> 00:25:17,214
I would say no problemo.

439
00:25:17,248 --> 00:25:19,984
Why would someone put penises
all over the beach?

440
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:21,219
Who knows why madmen
do what they do?

441
00:25:21,251 --> 00:25:22,719
Well, you know what I think?

442
00:25:22,752 --> 00:25:24,021
I think liberty
is just your excuse

443
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:25,924
to do whatever you want.

444
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:28,593
Whether that's to eat a beach
full of dicks or killin' folk.

445
00:25:31,996 --> 00:25:34,065
Oh, yeah?

446
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:36,934
At least I don't kill men
for money like you.

447
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,703
Oh, here we go.

448
00:25:38,736 --> 00:25:40,205
There's something wrong
with your skin.

449
00:25:41,271 --> 00:25:42,606
It's just a rash.

450
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,942
That's a rash?

451
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:58,557
Oh, no.

452
00:26:02,993 --> 00:26:04,094
You...

453
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:07,031
are the only one...

454
00:26:08,265 --> 00:26:12,037
fit to carry my javelin.

455
00:26:21,412 --> 00:26:23,081
Carry it for...

456
00:26:45,435 --> 00:26:47,137
Carry it for who?

457
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:48,840
For what? What the heck?

458
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,642
Who am I supposed
to carry it for?

459
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,746
This is so frustratin'.

460
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:56,647
He just told me I have
to carry this javelin

461
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,950
for a reason,
but he didn't say why!

462
00:27:00,817 --> 00:27:04,788
Waller? Waller. Waller!

463
00:27:14,298 --> 00:27:16,167
All right, we'll camp here,

464
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,136
and tomorrow we'll go
straight through to the city

465
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,405
to get to La Gatita Amable
by nightfall.

466
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:33,110
What?

467
00:28:51,494 --> 00:28:53,363
How deep of a sleeper are you?

468
00:28:53,396 --> 00:28:56,433
I was having
the most wonderful dream.

469
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:58,469
If it was you about to be
eaten by King Shark,

470
00:28:58,501 --> 00:29:00,103
then you're psychic.

471
00:29:00,136 --> 00:29:01,204
I don't believe
he would do that.

472
00:29:01,238 --> 00:29:03,341
He has very kind eyes.

473
00:29:06,844 --> 00:29:09,280
Hungry.

474
00:29:09,313 --> 00:29:10,515
You bastard!

475
00:29:12,115 --> 00:29:14,217
Uh...

476
00:29:25,895 --> 00:29:27,931
All right,
calm down with the rats!

477
00:29:27,964 --> 00:29:30,200
What?
- I have a thing with rats.

478
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:32,135
You have a thing with rats?
- Yes.

479
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:34,872
And you're on a team with me?
- Not something I asked for!

480
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,441
What are you
laughing at me for, man?

481
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:38,909
Why the fuck are you
in your underwear?

482
00:29:38,942 --> 00:29:40,277
Tighty-whities? Really?

483
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,812
Now, that's just racist.
- No.

484
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,514
<i>It's not racist.</i>

485
00:29:43,547 --> 00:29:45,249
<i>They're tighty-whities.</i>
- Oh, come the fuck on.

486
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:48,051
Bloodsport's got a rat phobia.

487
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:50,087
What?

488
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,221
You didn't tell me

489
00:29:51,255 --> 00:29:53,357
<i>you had a fear of rats, DuBois?</i>

490
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:56,127
I'm an assassin! Why would I
share my liabilities?

491
00:29:57,394 --> 00:29:58,863
For fuck's sake.

492
00:29:58,895 --> 00:30:00,463
Aw. He's offering you
a pretty leaf

493
00:30:00,497 --> 00:30:02,600
to show you he means no harm.

494
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:03,902
Why the fuck
would I want a leaf?

495
00:30:06,036 --> 00:30:07,238
Just get the rats out of here!

496
00:30:13,076 --> 00:30:16,179
Oh, fuck's sake.
- Huh. Cool.

497
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,919
Hey, we gonna kill
Megalodouche now, or what?

498
00:30:21,951 --> 00:30:23,587
<i>Nanaue's the strongest
member of your team.</i>

499
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,957
You need him
to get into Jotunheim.

500
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,425
Yeah, well,
we can't function as a team

501
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,993
if we gotta watch our back

502
00:30:29,026 --> 00:30:30,161
from one of our own
eatin' our bollocks.

503
00:30:32,061 --> 00:30:36,200
Nanaue,
would you eat your friends?

504
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:39,503
I no friends.

505
00:30:40,537 --> 00:30:42,240
You have no friends?

506
00:30:46,242 --> 00:30:48,511
If you did, would you eat them?

507
00:30:48,545 --> 00:30:49,614
Yes.

508
00:30:55,219 --> 00:30:57,455
No?

509
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:59,891
Then, can we be your friends?

510
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,192
Come on.

511
00:31:02,226 --> 00:31:03,261
He's obviously lying.

512
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,067
If I die
'cause I gambled on love,

513
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:12,370
it will be a worthy death.

514
00:31:14,203 --> 00:31:15,172
Friends.

515
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,016
You are a little idiot.

516
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:37,961
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
I'm good at my job.

517
00:31:37,994 --> 00:31:39,062
I found him.

518
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:40,031
Check it out.

519
00:31:41,097 --> 00:31:43,000
Look, right here, a mile north.

520
00:31:44,268 --> 00:31:45,603
Task Force X,

521
00:31:45,635 --> 00:31:47,170
you have an additional
mission directive.

522
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:49,105
<i>We've located
Colonel Rick Flag.</i>

523
00:31:49,138 --> 00:31:50,407
<i>He's been taken by the enemy.</i>

524
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,442
Rick Flag?

525
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:53,243
<i>I know, you both served</i>

526
00:31:53,277 --> 00:31:55,546
on special forces in Qurac
that took down Avral Kaddam.

527
00:31:55,578 --> 00:31:58,949
<i>Flag was the one
who initially recommended you.</i>

528
00:31:58,982 --> 00:32:00,684
You had
other operatives
in Corto Maltese

529
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,987
and didn't tell us?

530
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:06,323
<i>There was no tactical
advantage, now there is.</i>

531
00:32:06,356 --> 00:32:09,192
<i>I've uploaded the location
on your MTS.</i>

532
00:32:09,226 --> 00:32:13,564
<i>Terminate his captors
with extreme prejudice.</i>

533
00:32:13,596 --> 00:32:18,068
<i>Kill anyone you see.
These are dangerous people.</i>

534
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,505
<i>Recover Flag before moving on
to the city.</i>

535
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:27,744
That's where
they're holding Flag.

536
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:30,614
Nothing like a bloodbath
to start the day.

537
00:32:30,646 --> 00:32:32,248
They call you Peacemaker?

538
00:32:32,281 --> 00:32:34,417
I cherish peace
with all my heart.

539
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:35,686
I don't care
how many men, women,

540
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:37,188
and children
I need to kill to get it.

541
00:32:38,588 --> 00:32:40,424
I thought
you were the crazy one.

542
00:32:41,357 --> 00:32:42,592
I am.

543
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:44,260
All right.

544
00:32:44,294 --> 00:32:45,430
Let's get it.

545
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:49,300
Boss.

546
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:50,969
<i>Gracias.</i>

547
00:33:04,347 --> 00:33:06,683
No, no, no!

548
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:39,442
No, no, no!

549
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:04,836
Hmm?

550
00:35:09,438 --> 00:35:10,473
Non-lethal.

551
00:35:10,507 --> 00:35:12,143
You lose.

552
00:35:12,175 --> 00:35:13,877
Exploding compression bullets.

553
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:19,350
No one likes a show-off.

554
00:35:19,382 --> 00:35:21,618
Unless what they're
showing off is dope as fuck.

555
00:35:24,588 --> 00:35:26,690
Fuck. That's true.

556
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:43,741
He does throw
polka dots at people.

557
00:35:44,974 --> 00:35:47,477
I'm sorry it's so...
flamboyant.

558
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:50,280
It looks cool. I think.

559
00:35:50,313 --> 00:35:51,614
I don't like to kill people,

560
00:35:51,648 --> 00:35:53,717
but if I pretend
they're my mom, it's easy.

561
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,552
T.M.I., mate.

562
00:36:04,393 --> 00:36:05,328
DuBois?

563
00:36:05,862 --> 00:36:06,864
Hey, Flag.

564
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:10,668
What the hell
are you doing here?

565
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,670
Waller told us that you were...

566
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:14,605
Uh...

567
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:16,707
Are you drinkin' tea?

568
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:18,308
This is Sol Soria,

569
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,977
she's the leader
of the freedom fighters,

570
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,346
the resistance trying to take
down the current government.

571
00:36:22,378 --> 00:36:23,713
They saved my life.

572
00:36:24,748 --> 00:36:26,951
Oh, wow.

573
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:31,621
Why did my people not alert me
of your arrival?

574
00:36:33,956 --> 00:36:35,491
We didn't see any people.

575
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:36,427
Yeah, I didn't see
anybody on the way...

576
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,595
There's no one out there.

577
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,430
They were gone
when we got here.

578
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:40,765
I turned them into my mother
in my head and killed them.

579
00:36:57,414 --> 00:37:02,319
Typical Americans.
Just run in, guns blazing.

580
00:37:02,351 --> 00:37:04,587
I know, this is messed up.

581
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:06,624
These guys, they're...
- What's this one do?

582
00:37:07,657 --> 00:37:09,726
They're fucking idiots,

583
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,997
but right now our objectives
align with yours.

584
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,832
If Jotunheim
contains the technology

585
00:37:15,865 --> 00:37:17,600
our intelligence says it does,

586
00:37:17,634 --> 00:37:19,436
then it could be used
on the people of Corto Maltese

587
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:20,671
as well as Americans.

588
00:37:22,438 --> 00:37:23,773
That's why we need your help

589
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:25,642
to get into the city
so we can stop 'em.

590
00:37:27,376 --> 00:37:29,446
Is that rat waving at me?

591
00:37:35,385 --> 00:37:36,420
It appears it is.

592
00:37:37,653 --> 00:37:39,322
Why?

593
00:37:39,356 --> 00:37:40,858
I'm gonna guess
because it's friendly.

594
00:37:44,027 --> 00:37:46,497
Luna and Suarez
murdered my entire family.

595
00:37:48,597 --> 00:37:51,001
I'd make a deal
with the Devil to stop them.

596
00:37:53,936 --> 00:37:57,573
Your people will have our help
getting to Valle Del Mar

597
00:37:57,606 --> 00:38:01,978
to apprehend
this Gaius Grieves.

598
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:18,896
Hey.

599
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,098
What is this?
- You slaughtered my staff!

600
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,933
They were loyal
to the Herreras.

601
00:38:23,967 --> 00:38:26,503
Who are you loyal to, Thinker?

602
00:38:26,536 --> 00:38:29,406
They call you "Thinker," yes?

603
00:38:29,438 --> 00:38:32,508
All that shit in your face
is to make your brain good?

604
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:35,411
Yes, makes my brain good.

605
00:38:35,445 --> 00:38:37,648
Are you being sarcastic
with me?

606
00:38:38,815 --> 00:38:40,384
Hey! Hey.

607
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:41,617
I shall do to you
as we did to your employees.

608
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,552
Hey. Mateo!

609
00:38:49,492 --> 00:38:50,627
What is this?

610
00:38:53,028 --> 00:38:54,997
Project Starfish.

611
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,667
It's been the primary focus
of my experiments here

612
00:38:57,701 --> 00:39:00,404
for the past 30 years.

613
00:39:06,675 --> 00:39:09,112
Here.
What... What is it doing here?

614
00:39:09,846 --> 00:39:11,782
Oh!

615
00:39:11,815 --> 00:39:14,151
It is having little babies.

616
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:15,586
Not progeny,

617
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:17,987
extensions of itself.

618
00:39:19,422 --> 00:39:21,124
They take hosts,

619
00:39:21,157 --> 00:39:24,027
and those hosts in turn become
part of the central being.

620
00:39:26,563 --> 00:39:28,999
It feeds
on their consciousnesses.

621
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,871
Grows larger, more powerful.

622
00:39:40,143 --> 00:39:41,512
So...

623
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:47,118
where is
this Project Starfish now?

624
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,783
Marvelous idea, Presidente.

625
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,486
But as I've noted,

626
00:40:22,518 --> 00:40:25,988
I've been working
with the beast for 30 years.

627
00:40:26,021 --> 00:40:29,659
And there's no one but me
capable of controlling it.

628
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:31,562
Well, then...

629
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,899
welcome to the team.

630
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:42,906
<i>Si,</i> Camila.

631
00:40:42,938 --> 00:40:44,640
Presidente.

632
00:40:49,746 --> 00:40:51,582
You are making
a big mistake

633
00:40:51,614 --> 00:40:52,815
throwing me down here!

634
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:54,151
I will be outta here
soon enough

635
00:40:54,184 --> 00:40:57,087
and I will kill
every last one of you,

636
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,957
Colto Maltese-tezios.
Maltese-els.

637
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,693
Malte-multoids. Colt-a-mults?

638
00:41:03,726 --> 00:41:06,162
Whatever you<i>Mario Kart-racing</i>
d-bags are called!

639
00:41:07,297 --> 00:41:08,666
Please.

640
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,600
Put this on.

641
00:41:23,246 --> 00:41:24,682
Oh, wow.

642
00:41:28,985 --> 00:41:30,221
I'm a princess.

643
00:41:53,643 --> 00:41:55,145
<i>Senorita</i> Quinn,

644
00:41:55,177 --> 00:41:57,914
on behalf of the entire staff
of Our Honorable General

645
00:41:57,947 --> 00:42:00,082
Presidente Silvio
Eleuterio Luna,

646
00:42:00,115 --> 00:42:01,784
it's a pleasure to serve you.

647
00:42:02,885 --> 00:42:03,887
<i>Gracias.</i>

648
00:42:05,221 --> 00:42:09,727
My mother said
to count back again.

649
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,862
Ten, nine,

650
00:42:11,894 --> 00:42:14,130
eight, seven, six,

651
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:16,667

Coronel, beat that...

653
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,745
Oh.

654
00:42:28,777 --> 00:42:31,114
Forgive my appearance,<i>Senorita</i> Quinn.

655
00:42:32,882 --> 00:42:35,953
I have admired you from afar

656
00:42:35,985 --> 00:42:37,720
for many years now.

657
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:39,990
<i>Senorita.</i>

658
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:42,826
Me?

659
00:42:42,858 --> 00:42:46,028
You're a hero to me,
as well as to my people.

660
00:42:46,061 --> 00:42:48,764
I think you might
got me confused.

661
00:42:48,797 --> 00:42:50,366
Harley Quinn's fire
and rebellion

662
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,069
in the face
of American oppression

663
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:53,869
is something to which
my entire country aspires.

664
00:42:53,902 --> 00:42:55,237
Oh.

665
00:42:55,271 --> 00:42:56,774
I have prepared lunch.

666
00:42:58,675 --> 00:43:00,077
Would you be so kind
as to join me?

667
00:43:02,211 --> 00:43:03,946

You're joshing.

682
00:44:10,313 --> 00:44:12,149
Might I be frank, Harley?

683
00:44:12,981 --> 00:44:13,950
You might be.

684
00:44:16,085 --> 00:44:17,753
Good, listen.

685
00:44:17,786 --> 00:44:20,389
Since I took control,
the majority love me.

686
00:44:20,422 --> 00:44:24,694
But some find me to be

687
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,396
an unacceptable leader.

would find that?

Don't they know
how awesome you are?

690
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,235
Have you shown them
the birdies?

691
00:44:33,268 --> 00:44:35,071
It may sound archaic

692
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:37,174
to someone
from your part of the world,

693
00:44:37,206 --> 00:44:38,941
but my people,
the Corto Malteseans,

694
00:44:38,974 --> 00:44:40,443
they're very old-fashioned.

695
00:44:40,476 --> 00:44:42,344
Corto Malteseans, of course.

696
00:44:42,378 --> 00:44:44,915
And I am a bachelor.

697
00:44:44,947 --> 00:44:46,782
So they want
you to get hitched?

698
00:44:46,815 --> 00:44:49,152
My people say you would
make the perfect wife.

699
00:44:50,052 --> 00:44:51,320
Because, you know,

700
00:44:51,353 --> 00:44:53,156
you symbolize
anti-American fervor.

701
00:44:54,757 --> 00:44:55,692
Oh.

702
00:44:56,492 --> 00:44:58,127
But I am a romantic, Harley.

703
00:45:00,028 --> 00:45:02,165
I agreed to meet with you
just to appease them.

704
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:08,271
However, upon spending
the day with you,

705
00:45:08,304 --> 00:45:12,409
I find myself hardly able
to think straight.

706

Harley Luna.

713
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:46,110
I like the ring of that.

714
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,536
That's Jotunheim?

715
00:46:15,237 --> 00:46:19,542
Nazis came here seeking asylum
after World War II.

716
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:24,247
They built Jotunheim
to continue

717
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,918
their unorthodox experiments.

718
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:31,255
Until the Herrera family
accepted the bounty
on the Nazis' heads

719
00:46:32,255 --> 00:46:33,256
and killed them all.

720
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:34,891
Wowza.

721
00:46:34,923 --> 00:46:38,294
Many years ago,
the rumors began of a beast.

722
00:46:38,327 --> 00:46:42,231
These dark rumors helped
the Herrera family
maintain power.

723
00:46:42,264 --> 00:46:43,532
They would send
their political enemies

724
00:46:43,565 --> 00:46:45,901
and their families
to the fortress,

725
00:46:45,934 --> 00:46:47,170
never to return.

726
00:46:48,137 --> 00:46:52,175
I have recently learned

727
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:54,244
these were not rumors.

728
00:46:54,277 --> 00:46:56,546
They were murdering thousands

729
00:46:56,579 --> 00:47:00,017
in bizarre experiments
with this creature.

730
00:47:01,483 --> 00:47:02,852
Well, it must be a big relief

731
00:47:02,885 --> 00:47:05,154
to got it
in your hands now, huh?

732
00:47:05,188 --> 00:47:07,390
Absolutely.

733
00:47:07,422 --> 00:47:10,827
Now, it is our enemies
who shall be fearful.

734
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:15,465
If anyone dares
to say a negative word

735
00:47:15,498 --> 00:47:17,868
about their
new president today,

736
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:22,571
their parents, their children,
and anyone they ever loved

737
00:47:22,605 --> 00:47:25,609
will be sent to Jotunheim
to feed the beast.

738
00:47:27,476 --> 00:47:28,945
I'm sorry.

739
00:47:32,148 --> 00:47:34,150
Recently, I made
a promise to myself

740
00:47:34,182 --> 00:47:35,551
that the next time
I got a boyfriend,

741
00:47:35,585 --> 00:47:37,220
I'd be on the lookout
for red flags.

742
00:47:37,253 --> 00:47:38,488
And if I saw any,

743
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:39,857
I would do the healthy thing

744
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:42,259
and I would murder him.

745
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,162
And killing kids?

746
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:49,232
Kind of a red flag.

747
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:52,134
I know, I know.

748
00:47:52,168 --> 00:47:53,203
I know what
you're tryin' to say.

749
00:47:53,235 --> 00:47:55,004
"Harley, why not just leave?"

750
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,073
And I'd say,
"Why are you screaming at me?

751
00:47:57,106 --> 00:47:59,009
"I'm not deaf.
I'm standing right here."

752
00:47:59,041 --> 00:48:01,443
And then I'd say,

753
00:48:01,476 --> 00:48:04,914
"When your taste in men
is as bad as mine,

754
00:48:06,282 --> 00:48:08,585
they don't just
go away quietly.

755
00:48:10,353 --> 00:48:13,056
"They slash your tires
and they kill your dogs and

756
00:48:13,088 --> 00:48:14,657
tell you
that the music you like

757
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:16,625
ain't real music at all."

758
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:17,961
And all the cruelty...

759
00:48:24,967 --> 00:48:26,569
...tears you apart
after a while.

760
00:48:39,715 --> 00:48:42,551
You were real pretty and all,

761
00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:46,022
and R.I.P. to that absolutely
beautiful monster

762
00:48:46,054 --> 00:48:47,290
between your legs, but...

763
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:49,526
all in all...

764
00:48:51,994 --> 00:48:54,697
I think you're
more pretty like this,

765
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:57,668
with all those rotten thoughts
emptied from your head.

766
00:49:01,269 --> 00:49:03,138
I can't believe
this thing had a bullet.

767
00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:10,513
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

768
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:29,159
What the hell
are you doin'?

769
00:50:30,626 --> 00:50:33,496
We're tired,
Colonel. We need a rest.

770
00:50:33,528 --> 00:50:35,664
Goddamn hobbyists.

771
00:50:35,697 --> 00:50:37,332
We cannot stop.

772
00:50:37,365 --> 00:50:38,700
We need to hurry if you're
going to help my people.

773
00:50:38,733 --> 00:50:40,769
Hey. We're not here
to help your people.

774
00:50:40,802 --> 00:50:43,138
But she's right,
we gotta keep moving.

775
00:50:43,172 --> 00:50:45,308
I carry friend?

776
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,510
It's okay, Nanaue.

777
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,549
It's happening
to his face again.

778
00:50:52,581 --> 00:50:54,383
It's nothing, I slipped.
- Hey...

779
00:50:54,416 --> 00:50:57,519
Norman Bates, if that shit's
contagious, we need to know.

780
00:50:57,552 --> 00:50:59,755
It's not.

781
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:01,258
What is it?
- It's a...

782
00:51:04,226 --> 00:51:05,828
It's an interdimensional virus.

783
00:51:08,431 --> 00:51:09,566
Fuck is that?

784
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:13,303
My mother was a scientist
at S.T.A.R. Labs,

785
00:51:13,335 --> 00:51:14,803
and she was obsessed
with turning me

786
00:51:14,836 --> 00:51:17,206
and my brothers and sisters
into superheroes.

787
00:51:19,442 --> 00:51:21,644
She infected me.

788
00:51:21,677 --> 00:51:24,481
Now, if I don't, you know,
expel the dots twice a day...

789
00:51:25,313 --> 00:51:26,449
Then what?

790
00:51:28,684 --> 00:51:31,788
They'll eat me alive.

791
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,656
What happened
to your brothers and sisters?

792
00:51:36,391 --> 00:51:37,493
Some lived.

793
00:51:38,226 --> 00:51:39,128
Some...

794
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:42,498
died.

795
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,269
And your mom, where is she now?

796
00:51:51,507 --> 00:51:52,609
Everywhere.

797
00:52:00,215 --> 00:52:03,318
Okay. Let's move out.

798
00:52:03,351 --> 00:52:04,686
Come on,
we must hurry,

799
00:52:04,719 --> 00:52:06,722
or we'll be late
to meet my contact.

<i>Si.</i>

806
00:53:28,336 --> 00:53:30,439
Milton will drive you
through town

807
00:53:30,472 --> 00:53:31,873
and to La Gatita Amable.

808
00:53:31,907 --> 00:53:33,643
There are clothes in the boxes
for all of you

809
00:53:33,675 --> 00:53:35,244
so you can blend in.

810
00:53:35,277 --> 00:53:37,946
That said, the walking<i>tiburon</i>

811
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,649
is gonna have
to stay out of sight.

812
00:53:39,681 --> 00:53:41,817
I wear disguise.

813
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,988
Oh, you're going
to wear a disguise.

814
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:46,022
<i>Si.</i>

815
00:53:46,054 --> 00:53:47,489
Hey, he's learnin' Spanish.

816
00:53:47,523 --> 00:53:49,859
And what kind of disguise?

817
00:53:49,891 --> 00:53:52,294
Fake mustache.
- Oh.

818
00:53:52,327 --> 00:53:54,930
Yeah, fake mustache
isn't gonna cut it, mate.

819
00:53:59,467 --> 00:54:01,570
There's gonna be a lot of
soldiers watching Jotunheim.

820
00:54:02,838 --> 00:54:04,440
If they discover us there...

821
00:54:04,472 --> 00:54:06,608
Let's pray they do not,
or you will all be dead.

822
00:54:06,641 --> 00:54:08,377
If they do,

823
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,879
that'll leave
the palace vulnerable.

824
00:54:11,947 --> 00:54:13,683
Luna and the other generals

825
00:54:13,715 --> 00:54:14,917
will be left
without protection.

826
00:54:23,025 --> 00:54:25,028
You're a good man,
Colonel Flag.

827
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:31,567
You still look
exactly like yourself.

828
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:33,335
That's the worst fake
mustache I've ever seen.

829
00:54:33,369 --> 00:54:35,838
And if you had fooled us,
we'd have to kill you,

830
00:54:35,871 --> 00:54:37,774
shark-shaped bloke
with a moustache

831
00:54:37,806 --> 00:54:39,007
creeping up on us like that.

832
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:40,443
Fuck!

833
00:54:41,677 --> 00:54:43,313
You, you.

834
00:54:47,416 --> 00:54:48,484
Aw.

835
00:54:48,516 --> 00:54:51,520
He always wants to be near you.

836
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:53,022
I think he senses good in you.

837
00:54:53,054 --> 00:54:54,957
Yeah, there's no good in me.

838
00:55:00,429 --> 00:55:01,964
Damn.

839
00:55:01,996 --> 00:55:03,899
Supposed to play golf with
Senator Cray this weekend.

840
00:55:03,932 --> 00:55:05,667
I'm gonna look a fool.

841
00:55:05,701 --> 00:55:07,370
<i>Waller, come in.</i>

842
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:09,838
Ugh.

843
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:11,840
You missed.

844
00:55:11,873 --> 00:55:13,108
<i>Waller, do you copy?</i>

845
00:55:13,141 --> 00:55:14,743
We're losing connection.

846
00:55:16,478 --> 00:55:17,446
Waller.

847
00:55:19,815 --> 00:55:21,017
Fuck's sake.

848
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:22,685
<i>Task Force X.</i>
- Waller.

849
00:55:22,717 --> 00:55:24,553
<i>You there?</i>

850
00:55:24,586 --> 00:55:25,854
<i>The military must have put</i>

851
00:55:25,887 --> 00:55:27,989
signal jammers around the city.

852
00:55:28,023 --> 00:55:29,425
Your comms are down,

853
00:55:29,458 --> 00:55:30,793
but we can still activate
the bombs,

854
00:55:30,826 --> 00:55:32,862
not to mention what will
happen to your daughter.

855
00:55:32,894 --> 00:55:35,030
So, no funny business.

856
00:55:35,063 --> 00:55:36,665
<i>Do you copy, DuBois?</i>

857
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:38,434
Copy.

858
00:55:38,467 --> 00:55:40,737
Fuck you!

859
00:55:40,769 --> 00:55:43,572
Hey, uh, all that stuff
about his daughter,

860
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:46,409
you wouldn't
really do that, right?

861
00:55:46,442 --> 00:55:49,078
You don't know half
of what I would do, John.

862
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:11,567
What?

863
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:14,136
Why are you so afraid of rats?

864
00:56:16,905 --> 00:56:18,741
Why are you so in love
with them, Ratcatcher 2?

865
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:22,177
You know what I think?

866
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:24,679
I think you have a serious
case of daddy issues.

867
00:56:24,713 --> 00:56:27,951
I have no issues with
how much I loved my father.

868
00:56:36,925 --> 00:56:38,694
Although he was a genius...

869
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:44,934
we lived homeless
in the streets of Portugal
'cause of his...

870
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:49,539
burdens.

871
00:56:52,507 --> 00:56:55,043
He built the machines
I employ today...

872
00:56:56,778 --> 00:56:59,014
...and taught me the secrets
of calling the rats.

873
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,622
They brought us
trinkets to live on.

874
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,858
And they kept us warm at night,

875
00:57:08,891 --> 00:57:10,427
when we would have frozen.

876
00:57:13,795 --> 00:57:15,898
But eventually...
- <i>Papa.</i>

877
00:57:16,831 --> 00:57:18,133
<i>Papa, wake up.</i>

878
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:20,769
...my father's burdens

879
00:57:20,802 --> 00:57:23,038
became too heavy to carry.

880
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:24,640
<i>No.</i>

881
00:57:24,672 --> 00:57:25,841
<i>No, Papa.</i>

882
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,876
And he was gone.<i>Papa, wake up.</i>

883
00:57:33,748 --> 00:57:36,985
I took his machinery
and came to America.

884
00:57:37,018 --> 00:57:38,687
That is the dream, right?

885
00:57:40,155 --> 00:57:42,725
But I was arrested

886
00:57:42,757 --> 00:57:45,527
for armed bank robbery,
do you believe it?

887
00:57:45,561 --> 00:57:47,630
The state considered
the rats a weapon.

888
00:57:51,065 --> 00:57:52,100
What?

889
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:56,906
You remind me of my daughter,

890
00:57:58,273 --> 00:57:59,675
the reason I'm here.

891
00:58:01,543 --> 00:58:04,012
Why are you so afraid of rats?

892
00:58:04,947 --> 00:58:05,949
My old man.

893
00:58:08,016 --> 00:58:09,251
When I was a lad,

894
00:58:09,284 --> 00:58:11,653
if I didn't finish
a task right,

895
00:58:11,686 --> 00:58:14,823
he would dole out
the punishment.

896
00:58:14,856 --> 00:58:19,495
And one day, he just locked me
in a crate for 24 hours.

897
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:23,932
And it was
full of starvin' rats.

898
00:58:25,967 --> 00:58:28,136
As imperfect my father was...

899
00:58:32,173 --> 00:58:33,509
he loved me.

900
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:39,549
I wish I could
give that to you.

901
00:58:43,085 --> 00:58:45,154
Don't you worry, yeah?

902
00:58:45,186 --> 00:58:47,923
I'm gonna get you
out of here alive.

903
00:58:47,956 --> 00:58:50,626

Yup.

950
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:35,417
Even with my help, you think
you can get into Jotunheim?

951
01:02:35,449 --> 01:02:37,252
Well, if we can't,
I've got a Great White

952
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:39,121

953
01:02:39,153 --> 01:02:40,155
Now, come on.

954
01:02:43,057 --> 01:02:46,094

01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:53,802
Oh, fuck.

958
01:03:23,998 --> 01:03:25,834
Take him out through the back,
all right.

959
01:03:25,867 --> 01:03:28,236
Find my coordinates in the pad
and meet me in half an hour.

- Hey, did you hear what I said?

Yes, but...
- Go.

01:03:36,577 --> 01:03:40,148
Hey, calm down.

964
01:03:40,181 --> 01:03:42,250
There's no need
to disturb everyone's night.

965
01:03:42,284 --> 01:03:44,086
I'm right here, I'm the one
you're looking for.

966
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:47,223
Yep, us too.
We're his American companions.

976
01:04:25,159 --> 01:04:27,328

Be quiet, please.

978
01:04:29,097 --> 01:04:30,966
You are perceivably panicked.

979
01:04:30,998 --> 01:04:33,134
I'm guessing that you are not
the alphas of this battalion.

980

01:05:04,365 --> 01:05:05,700
Is Harley alive?

989
01:05:05,733 --> 01:05:07,535
Not for long.

990
01:05:07,568 --> 01:05:10,204

In Japan, it's<i>kyoshu jitsu.</i>

995
01:05:37,431 --> 01:05:41,569
In English,
it's simply the Death Touch,

996
01:05:41,603 --> 01:05:43,472
how to kill a man
with a single blow.

997
01:05:44,472 --> 01:05:46,441
Of course it's possible

998
01:05:46,474 --> 01:05:48,176
to kill a man
with a single blow.

999
01:05:49,744 --> 01:05:51,646
But it's a matter of chance,

1000
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:53,615
and cannot be wielded
with certainty.

1001
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:58,020

- They?

1002

- On one?

01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:00,155

01:14:42,143 --> 01:14:43,712
Ratatouille, what do you got?

1067
01:14:45,012 --> 01:14:46,914
Third floor hallway's clear.

1068
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:49,551
Abner?

1069
01:14:49,583 --> 01:14:51,185
There doesn't seem
to be any incoming traffic.

1070
01:14:52,686 --> 01:14:53,754
Bird.

1071
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:57,526
Nanaue, stay off the comm.

1072
01:15:00,561 --> 01:15:02,963
Colonel, I got a clean shot
on the only one in the office.

1073
01:15:02,997 --> 01:15:04,132
Just give the word.

1074
01:15:13,006 --> 01:15:15,743
Fire on three, two...

1075
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:17,045
What are you guys doing?

1076
01:15:18,212 --> 01:15:21,250
I... You.
We're here to save you.

1077
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:26,020
You were gonna... save me?

1078
01:15:26,054 --> 01:15:29,124
It was a really good plan, too.

1079
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:31,760
Well, I can go back inside,
and you can still do it.

1080
01:15:31,792 --> 01:15:33,060
That's patronizing.

1081
01:15:34,061 --> 01:15:35,530
Yeah, no, it's not...

1082
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:39,668
Uh,
what's with the javelin?

1083
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:41,102
I'm waitin' for God to tell me.

1084
01:15:41,135 --> 01:15:42,804
Jesus Christ.
- Yeah.

1085
01:15:42,837 --> 01:15:45,874
Or Him. Or any of them, really.

1086
01:15:45,907 --> 01:15:46,909
Okay.

1087
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:48,844
Okay.

1088
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:51,712
Are you two
all right, yeah?

1089
01:15:51,746 --> 01:15:52,847
I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

1090
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:53,815
Harley Quinn.

1091
01:15:53,847 --> 01:15:55,016
Bloodsport.

1092
01:16:00,087 --> 01:16:03,190
All right, who ate
all the fucking empanadas?

1093
01:16:03,224 --> 01:16:04,292
Mine were very good.

1094
01:16:04,324 --> 01:16:05,560
I had the chicken.

1095
01:16:06,661 --> 01:16:08,229
All right,

1096
01:16:08,261 --> 01:16:11,198
here's the deal.
We fail the mission, you die.

1097
01:16:11,231 --> 01:16:14,301
We find out any information
you give us is false, you die.

1098
01:16:14,335 --> 01:16:18,039
If we find out you have
personalized license plates,
you die.

1099
01:16:18,072 --> 01:16:19,240
What? No.

1100
01:16:19,273 --> 01:16:21,643
If you mismatch blacks,
you die.

1101
01:16:21,676 --> 01:16:23,044
No.

1102
01:16:23,077 --> 01:16:24,312
If you cough without
covering your mouth...

1103
01:16:24,345 --> 01:16:26,314
Harley. Those last three
aren't things.

1104
01:16:26,346 --> 01:16:28,349
Although, probably
don't need to say this,

1105
01:16:28,382 --> 01:16:29,917
but that isn't
an open invitation

1106
01:16:29,951 --> 01:16:31,653
for you to cough
without covering your mouth.

1107
01:16:31,685 --> 01:16:33,320
All right, we're gonna need
you to drive the minibus,

1108
01:16:33,354 --> 01:16:35,924
with all of us inside, past
the guards at the front gate.

1109
01:16:35,957 --> 01:16:38,727
Once through the gate,
we'll use you to get through
the retinal scanner.

1110
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,829
There are security cameras
everywhere.

1111
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:42,164
They're being dealt with.

1112
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:55,776
We'll neutralize the soldiers
there and enter.

1113
01:16:55,810 --> 01:16:58,246
Once we're inside,
we separate into teams.

1114
01:16:58,279 --> 01:17:00,415
I am walking back and forth.

1115
01:17:00,448 --> 01:17:03,918
Okay. You're gonna lead me
and Ratcatcher 2
to Project Starfish.

1116
01:17:03,951 --> 01:17:05,854
I'm going with you
'cause I don't trust this guy.

1117
01:17:05,886 --> 01:17:07,788
No, no, no,
you're coming with me.

1118
01:17:07,822 --> 01:17:10,125
Our munitions expertise
are needed
to place the explosives,

1119
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:13,094
starting at the first floor,
going all the way to the top.

1120
01:17:13,127 --> 01:17:15,997
Once we're clear, we blow
the tits off that thing,

1121
01:17:16,029 --> 01:17:17,131
and go home.

1122
01:17:18,432 --> 01:17:19,833
This is suicide.

1123
01:17:19,867 --> 01:17:21,136
Well, that's kind of our thing.

1124
01:17:22,302 --> 01:17:23,437
Yeah.

1125
01:17:30,011 --> 01:17:32,047
This is insane.

I love the rain.

1154
01:20:42,536 --> 01:20:44,472
Harley and I
will meet you up

1155
01:20:44,505 --> 01:20:46,174

01:21:36,023 --> 01:21:37,425
Peacemaker.

1160
01:21:38,725 --> 01:21:40,327
It's actually very nice.

1161
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:41,962
Just put it against the wall.

1162
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:45,465
It looks nothin' like me.

1163
01:21:45,498 --> 01:21:46,667

If God existed,

1169
01:23:07,047 --> 01:23:09,550
wouldn't this be proof
that he wasn't good at all?

1170
01:23:10,583 --> 01:23:12,419
What the hell is this?

1171
01:23:12,453 --> 01:23:14,622
I thought you were looking
for Project Starfish.

1172
01:23:16,756 --> 01:23:19,493
You've brought us visitors,
have you, Grieves?

1173
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:21,763
Have you come to save me

1174
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:24,032
Thirty years he's kept me here.

1175
01:23:24,064 --> 01:23:25,532
Tortured me.

1176
01:23:25,565 --> 01:23:28,235
Had his way with me.

1177
01:24:08,109 --> 01:24:10,812
I call it Starro the Conqueror.

1178
01:24:10,845 --> 01:24:12,580
That's meant to be derisive.

1179
01:24:13,613 --> 01:24:15,082
Sorry, old chum.

1180
01:24:15,115 --> 01:24:16,516

1181
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:17,718
It's out of my hands.

1182
01:24:17,751 --> 01:24:19,687
We need to help these people.

1183
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:23,324
Impossible, dear. They're
corpses below those stars.

1184
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:25,492
Who are they?

1185
01:24:27,161 --> 01:24:29,564
The fodder of powerful men
through every age.

1186
01:24:29,596 --> 01:24:30,564

01:24:31,564 --> 01:24:32,566

1188
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:35,536
political rivals,

1189
01:24:35,569 --> 01:24:37,739
and their loved ones.

1190
01:24:39,907 --> 01:24:41,676
Oh, please,

1191
01:24:41,708 --> 01:24:45,278
unclutch your fucking pearls,

1192
01:24:45,311 --> 01:24:47,747
We serve the same master.

1193
01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:49,450
We were sent here to stop you.

1194
01:24:50,384 --> 01:24:51,652
Child,

1195
01:24:51,685 --> 01:24:53,554
your government
didn't send you here

1196
01:24:53,587 --> 01:24:56,624
to protect the world
from alien technology.

1197
01:24:56,657 --> 01:25:00,461
Your government sent you here
to cover up their part in it.

1198
01:25:00,493 --> 01:25:02,796
You're a goddamn liar.

1199
01:25:02,829 --> 01:25:07,167
American goddamn astronauts
found Starro.

1200
01:25:07,201 --> 01:25:09,837
<i>Yankee-fucking-doodle dandies.</i>

1201
01:25:09,869 --> 01:25:11,538
Although the Cold War
was ended,

1202
01:25:11,572 --> 01:25:13,708
your government
saw the potential

1203
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:16,176
in weaponizing
such a powerful beast,

1204
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:17,745
but banish the thought

1205
01:25:17,778 --> 01:25:21,616
of any such experiments
being held on American soil.

1206
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:24,252
Your people
have always been squeamish

1207
01:25:24,284 --> 01:25:26,520
about the sacrifices necessary

1208
01:25:27,654 --> 01:25:29,222
for scientific advancement.

1209
01:25:29,256 --> 01:25:30,024
So,

1210
01:25:31,457 --> 01:25:33,326
the United States
made a secret deal

1211
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:34,928
with the Corto Maltese
government

1212
01:25:34,962 --> 01:25:37,565
to conduct
their illegal experiments here

1213
01:25:37,597 --> 01:25:39,166
<i>in Jotunheim.</i>

1214
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:41,301
<i>And they hired me
to oversee them.</i>

1215
01:25:41,335 --> 01:25:42,837
And now, because of

1216
01:25:42,869 --> 01:25:45,305
a run-of-the-mill
fucking military coup,

1217
01:25:45,338 --> 01:25:47,541
they're gonna destroy
30 years' worth of efforts.

1218
01:25:47,574 --> 01:25:48,775
Yeah!

1219
01:25:48,809 --> 01:25:51,179
You're the real victim here.

1220
01:25:51,212 --> 01:25:53,814
The hell you doing here?
You're supposed to be upstairs
plantin' explosives.

1221
01:25:53,846 --> 01:25:56,416
I told you I didn't trust him.

1222
01:25:56,449 --> 01:25:58,318
Your records are located
in those computers?

1223
01:26:01,354 --> 01:26:04,424
Colonel, what are you doing?

1224
01:26:04,457 --> 01:26:06,860
I joined the military
to serve my country,

1225
01:26:06,894 --> 01:26:08,229
not to be its puppet.

1226
01:26:09,462 --> 01:26:11,165
What are you doing?

1227
01:26:14,467 --> 01:26:15,769
Who are you going
to show that to?

1228
01:26:15,802 --> 01:26:18,972
The press. Goddamn people
deserve to know.

1229
01:26:19,006 --> 01:26:20,975
I'm tired of coverin' up
their dirty little secrets.

1230
01:26:21,007 --> 01:26:22,876
This time
these sons of bitches
are gonna be held account...

1231
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:25,446
I can't let you do that,
Colonel.

1232
01:26:25,479 --> 01:26:27,281
Excuse me?
- I'm truly sorry.

1233
01:26:27,314 --> 01:26:28,783
Miss Waller charged me
with makin' sure

1234
01:26:28,815 --> 01:26:30,417
those records
don't leave this building.

1235
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:31,919
Of course, I shoulda known.

1236
01:26:31,952 --> 01:26:34,555
Waller's always got a backup.

1237
01:26:34,587 --> 01:26:36,456
Come on, man,
this isn't personal.

1238
01:26:36,489 --> 01:26:38,992
Holdin' a gun on me
is pretty fucking personal.

1239
01:26:40,426 --> 01:26:42,362
What is that?

1240
01:26:42,395 --> 01:26:43,697
I'm gonna need that drive,
Colonel.

1241
01:26:45,332 --> 01:26:47,468
Those morons set off
the explosives too early.

1242
01:26:47,501 --> 01:26:49,003
Hand over the drive!

1243
01:26:49,036 --> 01:26:51,539
Let's go, come on!

1244
01:26:51,572 --> 01:26:52,807
They experimented on children.

1245
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,775
No one is sayin'
what they did was right.

1246
01:26:54,807 --> 01:26:57,010
They experimented on children!

1247
01:26:57,043 --> 01:26:58,445
That information gets out,

1248
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:00,381
it causes
an international incident!

1249
01:27:00,413 --> 01:27:02,649
Keepin' the peace
is worth any price,

1250
01:27:02,682 --> 01:27:04,818
including the life
of a hero like yours, sir,

1251
01:27:04,851 --> 01:27:05,919
so please...

1252
01:27:07,755 --> 01:27:08,990
don't make me do this.

1253
01:27:48,362 --> 01:27:49,697
What have you people done?

1254
01:28:05,979 --> 01:28:07,315
Sebastian, come!

1255
01:28:41,047 --> 01:28:43,116
Okay, we gotta calm down.

1256
01:28:43,149 --> 01:28:45,585
Let's all just...
Let's talk about this.

1257
01:28:45,618 --> 01:28:47,387
I understand
where you're coming from.

1258
01:28:47,421 --> 01:28:48,589
I crossed a line.

1259
01:28:48,622 --> 01:28:50,057
Okay, I crossed a line!

1260
01:28:50,090 --> 01:28:52,560
I realize that,
but I'm ready to change.

1261
01:28:52,592 --> 01:28:54,461
I am ready to change.

1262
01:28:54,494 --> 01:28:56,529
And I didn't
mean to hurt you...

1263
01:30:46,672 --> 01:30:48,608
You motherfucker.

1264
01:31:28,015 --> 01:31:29,183
Peacemaker.

1265
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:32,487
What a joke.

1266
01:32:05,851 --> 01:32:06,853
Cleo.

1267
01:32:08,354 --> 01:32:10,223
Give me back the drive.

1268
01:32:31,377 --> 01:32:34,314
I told you that information
can't get out. Fuck!

1269
01:32:34,347 --> 01:32:37,116
So, okay, okay,
destroy the hard drive.

1270
01:32:37,149 --> 01:32:39,786
Why kill me?

1271
01:32:45,759 --> 01:32:46,994
Because I'm thorough.

1272
01:32:49,729 --> 01:32:51,264
Oh, my...

1273
01:32:51,297 --> 01:32:52,865
Sorry, kid.

1274
01:32:52,899 --> 01:32:54,335
No, no...

1275
01:33:04,110 --> 01:33:05,778
All right, troops are coming.

1276
01:33:05,811 --> 01:33:07,780
This floor, and then
nine floors left. Let's go!

1277
01:33:07,814 --> 01:33:09,250
Come on!

1278
01:34:30,096 --> 01:34:32,131
New dumb friends.

1279
01:34:45,244 --> 01:34:46,746
Aw, fizzle sticks. Hold on.

1280
01:35:14,373 --> 01:35:16,409
Has anyone got eyes
or ears on any more?

1281
01:35:16,443 --> 01:35:17,878
They killed Milton!

1282
01:35:20,046 --> 01:35:21,815
Milton was still with us?

1283
01:35:21,847 --> 01:35:23,783
Where'd you think he was?
- I don't know.

1284
01:35:23,817 --> 01:35:25,185
I thought he stayed back
with the bus.

1285
01:35:25,217 --> 01:35:26,352
What was Milton gonna do?

1286
01:35:26,386 --> 01:35:27,755
He was helping us!

1287
01:35:29,555 --> 01:35:30,990
Who's Milton?
- What?

1288
01:35:31,024 --> 01:35:32,793
I don't remember any Milton.

1289
01:35:32,826 --> 01:35:36,263
Fuck! He has been with us
the whole time.

1290
01:35:36,296 --> 01:35:39,500
Somebody named Milton
has been with us
the whole time?

1291
01:35:39,533 --> 01:35:41,068
Yes!

1292
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:42,401
I don't think so.
I think I would've noticed

1293
01:35:42,435 --> 01:35:44,972
if a guy named Milton's
been with us.

1294
01:35:45,005 --> 01:35:46,473
It's not a very common name.

1295
01:35:46,506 --> 01:35:49,109
I don't think
I've ever even met Milton.

1296
01:35:49,141 --> 01:35:51,110
Are you messing around
right now?

1297
01:35:51,144 --> 01:35:52,913
He was a really nice guy,

1298
01:35:52,945 --> 01:35:55,548
and he sacrificed himself
to help us.

1299
01:35:55,582 --> 01:35:57,484
And now look at him.

1300
01:35:57,516 --> 01:35:58,384
He's dead.

1301
01:36:00,886 --> 01:36:05,325
Oh, that guy!
Milton, Milton.

1302
01:36:08,994 --> 01:36:11,531
So, when did this great
love affair with Milton start?

1303
01:36:11,564 --> 01:36:13,199
I liked him
from the beginning, okay?

1304
01:36:13,233 --> 01:36:14,502
I just didn't say
anything until...

1305
01:36:17,037 --> 01:36:18,372
No!

1306
01:38:13,485 --> 01:38:17,023
Harley!
Give us a hand!

1307
01:38:24,730 --> 01:38:25,965
Hey!

1308
01:38:37,444 --> 01:38:38,712
<i>Vamos. Vamos.</i>

1309
01:39:22,488 --> 01:39:23,622
Oh!

1310
01:40:13,238 --> 01:40:15,475
Oh, fuck, fuck.

1311
01:40:18,211 --> 01:40:20,447
Oh, fuck off!

1312
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:22,348
Oh.

1313
01:40:42,202 --> 01:40:43,437
Sorry, kid.

1314
01:40:43,470 --> 01:40:45,072
No, no, no.

1315
01:41:40,193 --> 01:41:41,728
How?

1316
01:41:41,761 --> 01:41:43,430
Smaller bullets.

1317
01:41:48,434 --> 01:41:50,337
He killed Colonel Flag.

1318
01:41:51,904 --> 01:41:54,406
He wanted to share this
with the press.

1319
01:41:54,439 --> 01:41:55,875
It's proof
the American government

1320
01:41:55,908 --> 01:41:58,711
was behind Project Starfish
the whole time.

1321
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:35,449
Whoa. Whoa.

1322
01:42:50,229 --> 01:42:51,730
I think it's trying to get out.

1323
01:42:51,764 --> 01:42:53,533
What?
- Starro the...

1324
01:43:16,655 --> 01:43:17,657
Whoa.

1325
01:44:26,759 --> 01:44:28,729
Cover your faces!

1326
01:45:16,943 --> 01:45:18,378
<i>Si.</i>

1327
01:45:18,411 --> 01:45:19,646
<i>Si.</i>

1328
01:45:52,145 --> 01:45:54,647
Whoa.
- What the fuck is that?

1329
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:56,149
Uh... Hey, guys?

1330
01:45:58,751 --> 01:46:00,620
Oh, shit, there's...

1331
01:46:19,037 --> 01:46:21,507
This city is mine.

1332
01:46:51,804 --> 01:46:54,441
Uh, Miss Waller,
I think the feed is back up.

1333
01:46:57,143 --> 01:46:58,978
Oh, my God, Miss Waller!

1334
01:46:59,011 --> 01:47:02,048
We've got a freaking<i>kaiju</i>
up in this shit!

1335
01:47:11,490 --> 01:47:12,758
<i>Task force X, come in.</i>

1336
01:47:12,792 --> 01:47:13,827
<i>Are you there?</i>

1337
01:47:16,863 --> 01:47:18,498
Uh-huh.

1338
01:47:18,530 --> 01:47:19,765
<i>Whatever signal jammers</i>

1339
01:47:19,798 --> 01:47:21,500
were blocking
our communications

1340
01:47:21,533 --> 01:47:23,569
must have been in the building
you just demolished.

1341
01:47:23,603 --> 01:47:26,206
Yeah, well, we've got a mite
issue over here, Waller.

1342
01:47:26,238 --> 01:47:28,640
It's Project Starfish,
Miss Waller.

1343
01:47:28,673 --> 01:47:30,709
It's headed towards the city,
and I think it wants

1344
01:47:30,743 --> 01:47:32,812
to feed on as many people
as it can.

1345
01:47:37,082 --> 01:47:38,917
<i>Not our problem.</i>

1346
01:47:38,951 --> 01:47:40,820
<i>If you've destroyed Jotunheim
and the records within,</i>

1347
01:47:40,853 --> 01:47:42,522
<i>you've achieved the objective.</i>

1348
01:47:42,555 --> 01:47:45,024
<i>Corto Maltese
is no longer a U.S. ally.</i>

1349
01:47:45,056 --> 01:47:46,792
If anything,
the White House will consider

1350
01:47:46,826 --> 01:47:48,928
fomenting disruption
in a hostile nation

1351
01:47:48,961 --> 01:47:49,996
a positive development.

1352
01:48:23,662 --> 01:48:24,964
You heard what she said.

1353
01:48:46,152 --> 01:48:47,954
Fuck.

1354
01:48:52,958 --> 01:48:54,860
Bloodsport is off mission.

1355
01:48:54,894 --> 01:48:56,029
What the...

1356
01:48:57,029 --> 01:48:58,865
She'll kill you, you know.

1357
01:48:58,898 --> 01:49:00,867
That's her business.

1358
01:49:00,899 --> 01:49:03,702
I knew Sebastian sensed good
in you for a reason.

1359
01:49:03,735 --> 01:49:06,138
Just keep that fucking rat
away from me.

1360
01:49:06,171 --> 01:49:08,740
Ratcatcher is also off mission.

1361
01:49:08,774 --> 01:49:09,976
Bloodsport, Ratcatcher,

1362
01:49:10,009 --> 01:49:10,910
<i>turn around.</i>

1363
01:49:10,943 --> 01:49:12,579
Where go, friends?

1364
01:49:13,311 --> 01:49:14,547
<i>Nanaue!</i>

1365
01:49:16,114 --> 01:49:18,551
I know what I'm carrying
the javelin for.

1366
01:49:28,793 --> 01:49:30,128
Krill, turn around now!

1367
01:49:30,162 --> 01:49:31,998
<i>Turn back now, God damn it!</i>

1368
01:49:35,201 --> 01:49:36,669
Open it.
- Miss Waller...

1369
01:49:36,702 --> 01:49:37,637
Open it!

1370
01:49:38,938 --> 01:49:41,007
What are you doing,
Task Force X?

1371
01:49:46,244 --> 01:49:47,913
Fuck!

1372
01:49:50,315 --> 01:49:51,883
Turn around now, God damn it!

1373
01:49:51,917 --> 01:49:53,853
<i>You dumb pieces of shit!</i>

1374
01:49:54,819 --> 01:49:56,655
<i>Motherfuckers!</i>

1375
01:49:58,256 --> 01:50:00,158
<i>God damn it, Task Force X,
this is your last</i>

1376
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:02,228
motherfucking warning!

1377
01:50:06,297 --> 01:50:09,201
Oh, my God!
What the fuck did you do?

1378
01:50:11,270 --> 01:50:12,806
All those people, John.

1379
01:50:13,905 --> 01:50:15,073
Little kids.

1380
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:24,083
Task Force X, the creature
is headed to Calle Principal.

1381
01:50:24,115 --> 01:50:25,717
Avoid Avenida Medrano.

1382
01:50:25,751 --> 01:50:27,420
There is a swarm of infected.
- Jesus.

1383
01:50:27,453 --> 01:50:31,357
So, your clearest path
is Calle Aguero.

1384
01:50:31,390 --> 01:50:34,260
Get on the satellite, Dale,
you fucking dickhead!

1385
01:50:34,292 --> 01:50:35,861
Yes, ma'am.

1386
01:51:57,475 --> 01:51:58,477
Huh?

1387
01:52:04,783 --> 01:52:06,518
Harley, take the high ground!

1388
01:52:12,524 --> 01:52:15,728
Nanaue! Monster is nom nom!

1389
01:52:16,862 --> 01:52:19,098
Monster nom nom?

1390
01:52:19,131 --> 01:52:20,333
Yes!

1391
01:52:29,341 --> 01:52:31,477
Abner, do you see who that is?

1392
01:52:31,510 --> 01:52:33,312
Huh?

1393
01:52:33,345 --> 01:52:35,048
It's your mom!

1394
01:53:08,046 --> 01:53:10,149
I'm a superhero!

1395
01:53:11,350 --> 01:53:13,353
I'm a motherfucking super...

1396
01:54:02,434 --> 01:54:03,436
God!

1397
01:54:10,341 --> 01:54:14,346
<i>No! No!</i>

1398
01:54:32,230 --> 01:54:33,232
Oh, no...

1399
01:54:41,206 --> 01:54:43,609
This city

1400
01:54:43,641 --> 01:54:47,679
is mine!

1401
01:54:47,712 --> 01:54:50,649
This city isn't yours.

1402
01:54:50,682 --> 01:54:53,085
This city isn't ours.

1403
01:54:54,052 --> 01:54:56,021
This city is theirs.

1404
01:55:00,391 --> 01:55:01,593
Oh, hell.

1405
01:56:21,273 --> 01:56:22,742
Why rats, Papa?

1406
01:56:24,309 --> 01:56:26,512
Rats are the lowliest
and most despised

1407
01:56:26,545 --> 01:56:28,147
of all creatures, my love.

1408
01:56:29,547 --> 01:56:31,083
If they have purpose,

1409
01:56:32,784 --> 01:56:34,319
so do we all.

1410
01:58:20,492 --> 01:58:22,728
I was happy,

1411
01:58:22,761 --> 01:58:27,333
floating, staring at the stars.

1412
01:59:00,532 --> 01:59:02,368
<i>A group of escaped convicts</i>

1413
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:04,169
<i>saved a city of millions</i>

1414
01:59:04,203 --> 01:59:06,572
<i>on the small island nation
of Corto Maltese today.</i>

1415
01:59:07,706 --> 01:59:08,708
That's my dad.

1416
01:59:10,341 --> 01:59:11,910
<i>Because of these people,</i>

1417
01:59:11,944 --> 01:59:14,947
<i>Corto Maltese will have
free democratic elections</i>

1418
01:59:14,979 --> 01:59:17,782
<i>for the first time in 90 years.</i>

1419
01:59:17,815 --> 01:59:19,517
<i>Viva Corto Maltese!</i>

1420
01:59:19,551 --> 01:59:22,188
<i>Viva Corto Maltese!</i>

1421
01:59:22,220 --> 01:59:25,723
<i>Viva Corto Maltese! Viva...</i>

1422
01:59:25,756 --> 01:59:28,393
That's my dad.<i>...Corto Maltese! Viva...</i>

1423
01:59:36,534 --> 01:59:37,636
Yeah.

1424
01:59:40,404 --> 01:59:42,674
Yeah.

1425
01:59:42,707 --> 01:59:44,909
<i>Oh, that's just a taste
of what's on that drive.</i>

1426
01:59:44,943 --> 01:59:47,213
<i>I've uploaded it all
to a secure server.</i>

1427
01:59:48,279 --> 01:59:50,215
<i>Now, if you kill any one of us,</i>

1428
01:59:50,248 --> 01:59:52,250
or my daughter ever sees
the inside of a prison,

1429
01:59:52,283 --> 01:59:53,585
it goes public.

1430
01:59:53,618 --> 01:59:55,386
If we all go free,

1431
01:59:55,420 --> 01:59:57,323
it never has to see
the light of day.

1432
01:59:58,923 --> 02:00:01,459
I told you I'd make you
a leader, DuBois.

1433
02:00:02,761 --> 02:00:03,930
<i>You got a deal.</i>

1434
02:00:24,349 --> 02:00:25,418
Nanaue.

1435
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:43,769
Look, I know Flag wanted to
give the drive to the press,

1436
02:00:43,801 --> 02:00:45,770
but we just saved
a whole bloody city.

1437
02:00:45,804 --> 02:00:47,440
We can't have it all.

1438
02:00:50,475 --> 02:00:51,644
Flag was my friend.

1439
02:00:51,676 --> 02:00:52,744
Mine too.

1440
02:00:54,945 --> 02:00:56,715
And I haven't got
many of those.

1441
02:00:59,350 --> 02:01:01,753
I could be your friend, Milton.

1442
02:01:01,787 --> 02:01:02,755
Not my name.

1443
02:01:02,787 --> 02:01:04,555
What?

1444
02:01:04,588 --> 02:01:06,891
What are you talkin' about?
We just had a conversation

1445
02:01:06,925 --> 02:01:09,395
for, like, three hours
about how your name is Milton.

1446
02:01:09,427 --> 02:01:10,461
Didn't.

1447
02:01:10,494 --> 02:01:12,063
Yes, we did.

1448
02:01:12,096 --> 02:01:14,365
No. Our ride's here.

1449
02:01:14,399 --> 02:01:16,035
Hmm.

1450
02:01:17,969 --> 02:01:19,438
Nom nom?

1451
02:01:19,470 --> 02:01:20,838
Really?

1452
02:01:20,872 --> 02:01:22,641
That is what you're
thinkin' about right now?

1453
02:01:22,673 --> 02:01:25,410
No. That nom nom though.

1454
02:01:25,444 --> 02:01:26,646
No, it's not nom nom.

1455
02:01:28,546 --> 02:01:29,580

Said they found him
in the rubble.

1523
02:10:55,512 --> 02:10:57,481
They were shocked
his heart was still beating.

1524
02:10:57,515 --> 02:10:59,017
I wasn't certain
how safe it was,

1525
02:10:59,050 --> 02:11:00,385
shipping him back here.

1526
02:11:00,417 --> 02:11:03,454
But, if anything,
he's shown he's resilient.

1527
02:11:03,488 --> 02:11:05,056
It'll take some surgery,

1528
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:06,357
but eventually we'll get him
back up to speed.

1529
02:11:09,060 --> 02:11:11,029
You realize
this is revenge, right?

1530
02:11:11,061 --> 02:11:12,663
Waller knows
we double-crossed her,

1531
02:11:12,697 --> 02:11:14,132
and she's getting back at us

1532
02:11:14,164 --> 02:11:16,066
by saddling us
with this douchebag.

1533
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:17,636
Yep.

1534
02:11:17,668 --> 02:11:20,004
I heard he was sort of a hero
down in Corto Maltese.

1535
02:11:20,037 --> 02:11:22,139
Oh, is that what you heard?
Because not quite.

1536
02:11:24,242 --> 02:11:26,912
What do you guys
want him for?
