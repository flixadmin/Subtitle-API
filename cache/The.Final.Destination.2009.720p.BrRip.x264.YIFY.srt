<font color="#787878">~ No, you can't.
~ Let me go! I gotta find her!</font>

132
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:25,749
<font color="#787878">Have you all lost your fucking mind?</font>

133
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:30,921
<font color="#787878">Ew!</font>

134

<font color="#787878">~ Here you go.
~ Thanks.</font>

135
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:15,492
<font color="#787878">~ Just a second.
~ That's okay.</font>

136
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:32,342
<font color="#787878">Nick, was it like a dream
or like a voice in your head?</font>

137
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,179
<font color="#787878">I just.... I just saw it.</font>

138
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:39,883
<font color="#787878">~ Can we just try to forget about it?
~ Are you kidding?</font>

139
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,121
<font color="#787878">I am never gonna get that image
out of my head.</font>

140
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:46,122
<font color="#787878">~ I mean, that girl's face just~~
~ Janet. Look, I know it's difficult.</font>

141
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,859
<font color="#787878">~ We're all a little freaked out, okay?
~ But why are we still alive?</font>

142
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:52,998
<font color="#787878">Who cares why? Okay?</font>

143
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,999
<font color="#787878">If we made it, we deserved it.</font>

144
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,404
<font color="#787878">Hunt, will you give the lucky-coin shit a rest, please?</font>

145
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,309
<font color="#787878">Guys, look.</font>

146
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:18,722

~ I can't.</font>

147
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,026
<font color="#787878">~ l can't go back.
~ Yeah, screw that.</font>

148
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,428
<font color="#787878">We can pay our respects to those people.</font>

149
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,996
<font color="#787878">What people?</font>

150
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,997
<font color="#787878">People who didn't have a Dr. Xavier with them to tell them to get out of the way?</font>

151
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:31,901
<font color="#787878">People who didn't have one of these?</font>

152
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,374
<font color="#787878">Go ahead, Janet. Kiss it.</font>

153
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,375
<font color="#787878">It's your choice, heads or tails,
but you know I like head.</font>

154
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:41,745
<font color="#787878">~ Can't believe I ever went out with you.
~ Can't believe you were so lucky.</font>

155
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:46,516
<font color="#787878">Guys, look. We're here.</font>

156
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,453
<font color="#787878">All right?
Something gave us a second chance....</font>

157
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,790
<font color="#787878">so let's be thankful
and just try to make the most of it.</font>

158
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,727
<font color="#787878">Okay?</font>

159
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,666
<font color="#787878">Come on, let's go.</font>

163
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,121
<font color="#787878">Hi, I was hoping you'd come.</font>

164
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,122
<font color="#787878">I wanted to thank you. You're a hero.</font>

165
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,692
<font color="#787878">Because of your warning,
we're alive and our two sons are safe.</font>

166
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,995
<font color="#787878">Look, I'm not a hero, okay? I~~ I didn't~~</font>

167
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,534
<font color="#787878">You knew.</font>

168
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,535
<font color="#787878">How did you know it was gonna happen?</font>

169
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,372
<font color="#787878">~ I'm not sure.
~ Look, we're just glad you all are okay.</font>

170
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,711
<font color="#787878">Take care.</font>

171
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,380
<font color="#787878">Thank you.</font>

172
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,616
<font color="#787878">I'm glad you're safe.</font>

173
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:27,617
<font color="#787878">Thank you.</font>

174
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,122
<font color="#787878">Excuse me.</font>

175

179
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,666
<font color="#787878">I was pretty freaked out about that back there.</font>

180
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,667
<font color="#787878">~ l just wanted to ask you how you~~
~ You killed my wife.</font>

181
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:51,241
<font color="#787878">I wanted to go in there after her, but....</font>

182
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,579
<font color="#787878">you, uh....</font>

189
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:19,936
<font color="#787878">Your time's coming, chocolate.</font>

190
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:58,076
<font color="#787878">What's wrong?</font>

191
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,811
<font color="#787878">I just had a really bad nightmare.</font>

192
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:03,281
<font color="#787878">It's okay, it's just a dream.</font>

193
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,282
<font color="#787878">It seemed real.</font>

194
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,119
<font color="#787878">Just try to relax and go back to sleep.</font>

195

<font color="#787878">I~~ I don't think it was a dream.
It was like....</font>

233
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:53,769

<font color="#787878">What is happening to me?</font>

<font color="#787878">I want you to go play video games. Come back in an hour.</font>

256
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,634
<font color="#787878">~ All right!
~ You're welcome.</font>

257
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,169
<font color="#787878">~ Thanks.
~ Thanks, Mom.</font>

258
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,538
<font color="#787878">~ I'm first on "Atomic Destroyer."
~ No, I am.</font>

259
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:37,642
<font color="#787878">Hi, Cheyenne, I'm sorry I'm late.
I had a 5:00 with Richard.</font>

260
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:39,811
<font color="#787878">Oh, you didn't get our message?</font>

261
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,879
<font color="#787878">~ Richard's out today.
~ What?</font>

262
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,880
<font color="#787878">Someone got killed on his block.
Dragged down the street on fire.</font>

263
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,851
<font color="#787878">~ Isn't that terrible?
~ That's awful.</font>

264
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:53,389
<font color="#787878">So my appointment?
Is there someone else that can see me?</font>

265
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,560
<font color="#787878">Um, it's 10 to 6, and we close at 6, so....</font>

266
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,498
<font color="#787878">I understand, but the soccer game ran late, and it's girls' night out tonight....</font>

267
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:06,304
<font color="#787878">first time in months,
and I'm so looking forward to this.</font>

268
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:08,873
<font color="#787878">~ Please. Please.
~ Um~~</font>

269
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,209
<font color="#787878">~ Look at this.
~ You're killing me.</font>

270
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,210
<font color="#787878">Thank you. Ah, thank you so much.</font>

271
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:21,753
<font color="#787878">Excuse me, that's~~</font>

272
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,423
<font color="#787878">That is a little~~ That's a little tight.</font>

273
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:26,591
<font color="#787878">~ Ahem.
~ Uh.</font>

274
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:29,592
<font color="#787878">~ Sorry.
~ That's okay.</font>

275
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,729
<font color="#787878">So, Dee Dee, thank you for staying late. How long have you been cutting hair?</font>

276
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:38,236
<font color="#787878">Long enough.</font>

277
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:42,407
<font color="#787878">Goddamn chair.</font>

278
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:44,842
<font color="#787878">I've only told them to fix it
like a million times.</font>

279
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,118
<font color="#787878">~ Oh, Dee Dee?
~ Yeah?</font>

280
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,987
<font color="#787878">Could I please get some water?</font>

281
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,988
<font color="#787878">~ No problem.
~ Thank you.</font>

282
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,310
<font color="#787878">~ How's it going?
~ Almost done.</font>

283
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,619
<font color="#787878">I love the color. It's exactly honey.</font>

284
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:07,256
<font color="#787878">Do you think?</font>

285
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,578
<font color="#787878">I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.</font>

286
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:03,514
<font color="#787878">It won't happen again.</font>

287
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,551
<font color="#787878">It's okay.</font>

288
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:09,552
<font color="#787878">Wow.</font>

289
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:11,689
<font color="#787878">~ Hi, Mom.
~ Hey.</font>

290
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,990
<font color="#787878">Whoa.</font>

291
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,991
<font color="#787878">~ Oh, my God, are you okay?
~ Cut it out.</font>

292
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,741
<font color="#787878">~ Thanks, Dee Dee.
~ You're welcome.</font>

293
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,743
<font color="#787878">Hope you have fun.</font>

294
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:37,248
<font color="#787878">~ Stop.
~ Okay, guys, knock it off.</font>

295
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,951
<font color="#787878">I am so sorry about this.</font>

296
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:42,952
<font color="#787878">These guys aren't gonna leave my sight until I ship them to college.</font>

297
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:46,255
<font color="#787878">~ Maybe military school?
~ Ha, yeah, maybe.</font>

298
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:49,625
<font color="#787878">All right, boys, come on.</font>

299
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:52,230
<font color="#787878">Let's go. Get in the car.</font>

300
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:55,231
<font color="#787878">I've got my eye on you two.</font>

301
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,310
<font color="#787878">Oh, my God!</font>

302
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:15,551
<font color="#787878">It's that lady with the kids,
from the racetrack.</font>

303
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,458
<font color="#787878">We just lost a really hot MILF.</font>

304
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:22,593
<font color="#787878">~ Dude, this is serious.
~ Yeah.</font>

305
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,594
<font color="#787878">Don't you think it's weird
that two of the people Nick saved are dead?</font>

306
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:28,998
<font color="#787878">Weird is putting tampons in your kids' ears. That's weird.</font>

307
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,002
<font color="#787878">She was bound to die sooner or later.</font>

308
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:34,003
<font color="#787878">That's actually why we asked you guys to come over.</font>

309
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:37,172
<font color="#787878">The night before it happened,
Nick had a really strange dream.</font>

310
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:40,411
<font color="#787878">Great. I'm glad I cancelled my golf game for this. Good.</font>

311
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:41,912
<font color="#787878">But it wasn't a dream.</font>

312
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:44,913
<font color="#787878">It was like these random sounds
and images.</font>

313
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:48,317
<font color="#787878">They really didn't make any sense. And then I read what killed them....</font>

314
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,920
<font color="#787878">and I realized that I'd seen
how the next person was gonna die.</font>

315
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,692
<font color="#787878">Wait, what do you mean,
"the next person"?</font>

316
00:29:54,693 --> 00:29:57,693
<font color="#787878">Okay, don't laugh,
but we stayed up 'googling' premonitions....</font>

317
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,964
<font color="#787878">visions, signs, things like that, just to see how much information we could get.</font>

318
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,270
<font color="#787878">There are tons of articles about people....</font>

319
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,372
<font color="#787878">who had a premonition
about a disaster....</font>

320
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:11,042
<font color="#787878">they saved themselves....</font>

321
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:12,376
<font color="#787878">and then they died.</font>

322
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:15,046
<font color="#787878">Okay, so people died. So what?</font>

323
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:17,315
<font color="#787878">Every survivor died.</font>

324
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:20,217
<font color="#787878">In the precise order they were meant to die in the accident.</font>

325
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,219
<font color="#787878">Well, we survived.</font>

326
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,220
<font color="#787878">So now does that mean we all die?</font>

327
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:30,059
<font color="#787878">~ Well, who's next?
~ I don't remember.</font>

328
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,964
<font color="#787878">But there might be an out.</font>

329
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,334
<font color="#787878">Some say the chain can be broken.</font>

330
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:39,335
<font color="#787878">Like if you were to intervene
into someone else's death....</font>

331
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,571
<font color="#787878">that would end it.</font>

332
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:43,307
<font color="#787878">But others say
unless the chain is broken completely....</font>

333
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:46,308
<font color="#787878">then you're just changing the batting order, and sooner or later, you're up.</font>

334
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,748
<font color="#787878">That is some spooky psychobabble shit.</font>

335
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:53,184
<font color="#787878">shut up, please. This is not funny.</font>

336
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:56,185
<font color="#787878">~ He could be watching a ton of TV.
~ You know what this does to me.</font>

337
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,421
<font color="#787878">It's okay. All we're trying to do
is figure out what's going on.</font>

338
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,992
<font color="#787878">You are gonna have to
figure that out without me.</font>

339
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:04,993
<font color="#787878">You can call me later, but I gotta go. Hope you have fun.</font>

340
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:07,031
<font color="#787878">Janet, come back. Don't leave.</font>

341
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:09,166
<font color="#787878">No, Lori. No.
You guys are freaking me out.</font>

342
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,769
<font color="#787878">What's with that?
She went from uptight but normal....</font>

343
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,437
<font color="#787878">to uptight and totally insane.</font>

344
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:16,207
<font color="#787878">Why do you gotta be a prick?
She saw somebody die.</font>

345
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,943
<font color="#787878">~ So did we.
~ Yeah, and we're all freaked out.</font>

346
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:21,944
<font color="#787878">Would it kill you to be sensitive?</font>

347
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,348
<font color="#787878">I don't know.</font>

348
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,617
<font color="#787878">I've never tried it.</font>

349
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,052
<font color="#787878">Where are you going?</font>

350
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:31,053
<font color="#787878">If you're right
about this whole crash thing....</font>

351
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,390
<font color="#787878">then I'm going to make the most
of every moment I have left.</font>

352
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:37,459
<font color="#787878">I'm gonna go get laid.</font>

353
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,865
<font color="#787878">If I'm dying, I'm trying.</font>

354
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:43,866
<font color="#787878">Keep up the good fight, guys.</font>

355
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,640
<font color="#787878">And if I happen to bump into Janet, I will check on her.</font>

356
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:56,445
<font color="#787878">Thanks.</font>

357
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,229
<font color="#787878">Well, that went well.</font>

358
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,230
<font color="#787878">Yeah, our friends think we're crazy. It's great.</font>

359
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,468
<font color="#787878">Well, maybe we are.</font>

360
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:20,469
<font color="#787878">Look, they're probably
just some weird coincidences.</font>

361
00:32:22,574 --> 00:32:25,574
<font color="#787878">You think?</font>

362
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,945
<font color="#787878">I hope so.</font>

363
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:42,658
<font color="#787878">Nick? What did you see?</font>

364
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,795
<font color="#787878">~ l think we can stop it.
~ How?</font>

365
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:50,199
<font color="#787878">We gotta go to the racetrack.</font>

366
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:58,876
<font color="#787878">Oh, my God.</font>

367
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:00,845
<font color="#787878">Look at this place.</font>

368
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:03,214
<font color="#787878">All those people just....</font>

369
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:05,816
<font color="#787878">~ l don't wanna be here.
~ I know, I know.</font>

370
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,817
<font color="#787878">But this is the only thing that I can think of to help me remember the order.</font>

371
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:13,722
<font color="#787878">It's over here. This is where we were.</font>

372
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,466
<font color="#787878">Let's see if this works.</font>

373
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:29,371
<font color="#787878">The mechanic's girlfriend dies first.</font>

374
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:38,981
<font color="#787878">Then that racist and his wife.</font>

375
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:54,663
<font color="#787878">That woman with the kids, she was next.</font>

376
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,872
<font color="#787878">Let's go. We shouldn't be here. Let's go.</font>

377
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:14,385
<font color="#787878">I can't remember who dies when.</font>

378
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,954
<font color="#787878">~ It's okay.
~ I don't know what to do. I can't~~</font>

379
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:19,623
<font color="#787878">Maybe this was a really bad idea.</font>

380
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:22,593
<font color="#787878">No.</font>

381
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:25,594
<font color="#787878">I gotta try.</font>

382
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:29,133
<font color="#787878">You better have a damn good reason for trespassing.</font>

383
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:31,435
<font color="#787878">I just need to remember the order.</font>

384
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:34,436
<font color="#787878">Young man, that sounds crazy.
But maybe this will help you.</font>

385
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,746
<font color="#787878">Now, this will bring up
all our video cameras right here.</font>

386
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,161
<font color="#787878">There.</font>

387
00:34:57,162 --> 00:35:00,162
<font color="#787878">That's where that guy
in the mechanic jacket dies.</font>

388
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,499
<font color="#787878">~ so he's next, then.
~ I think so.</font>

389
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:10,806
<font color="#787878">That collapse kills Hunt and Janet.</font>

390
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,311
<font color="#787878">And that's when you die.</font>

391
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,682
<font color="#787878">And then Lori.</font>

392
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:24,186
<font color="#787878">Then me.</font>

393
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,860
<font color="#787878">Maybe if we can stop this mechanic from getting killed, we can break the chain....</font>

394
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,665
<font color="#787878">and the rest of us will be safe.</font>

395
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,934
<font color="#787878">But how?
I mean, we don't even know his name.</font>

396
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:39,935
<font color="#787878">~ We know nothing about him.
~ But we do know where he works.</font>

397
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,808
<font color="#787878">Grandstate Customs.</font>

398
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,344
<font color="#787878">Gotta finish up that differential.</font>

399
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:50,114
<font color="#787878">Bond that to the fibreglass on it.</font>

400
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,316
<font color="#787878">~ Done with that impact?
~ Yeah, hold on a second.</font>

401
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,163
<font color="#787878">You just want that spot-welded, right?</font>

402
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:14,803
<font color="#787878">Hey, can you give me a hand
with this test probe?</font>

403
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:19,541
<font color="#787878">Good stuff, man.</font>

404
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,591
<font color="#787878">~ Hey!
~ Are you okay?</font>

405
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:37,592
<font color="#787878">Who's the fucking moron?</font>

406
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,764
<font color="#787878">You. What are you doing here?</font>

407
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,266
<font color="#787878">Trying to find you.</font>

408
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:45,267
<font color="#787878">Look, man, I'm sorry for being blunt, but your life's in danger. You're gonna die.</font>

409
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:49,404
<font color="#787878">Three of the people who left that stadium before that accident....</font>

410
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,775
<font color="#787878">they're now dead.</font>

411
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,776
<font color="#787878">I'm sorry,
but we think that you're gonna be next.</font>

412
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,247
<font color="#787878">You're serious?</font>

413
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:58,582
<font color="#787878">Andy.</font>

414
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,583
<font color="#787878">You know you can't have these people here. Take them outside. No visitors in here.</font>

415
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,954
<font color="#787878">Let's go.</font>

416
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,640
<font color="#787878">Look, man, I'm trying to put my life back together, okay?</font>

417
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:30,479
<font color="#787878">I mean, watching Nadia die like that in front of me....</font>

418
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,985
<font color="#787878">Hey, I know exactly how you feel.</font>

419
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,921
<font color="#787878">I lost my wife and my daughter
in a car accident.</font>

420
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,922
<font color="#787878">I was driving and I was drunk.</font>

421
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:44,426
<font color="#787878">Every day, I ask myself how come
it couldn't be me instead of them.</font>

422
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:53,168
<font color="#787878">For a long time,
I carried so much pain and anger....</font>

423
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:56,671
<font color="#787878">it was actually destroying their memory. So now I try to live each day in their name.</font>

424
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:07,983
<font color="#787878">Hey, guys, I hate to break it to you, but I'm getting a really bad feeling.</font>

425
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,753
<font color="#787878">Look, kid,
I'm around dangerous equipment every day.</font>

426
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,856
<font color="#787878">If I was meant to die,
it would've happened by now.</font>

427
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,165
<font color="#787878">Look out!</font>

428
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:26,136
<font color="#787878">~ Holy shit.
~ You okay, Andy?</font>

429
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,137
<font color="#787878">Yeah, I'm okay.</font>

430
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:32,009
<font color="#787878">Well, I guess it's not my turn to die.</font>

431
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,010
<font color="#787878">Y'all take care.</font>

432
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,188
<font color="#787878">Holy~~! You all right?</font>

433
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:45,656
<font color="#787878">Show us 20 at the body shop.</font>

434
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,958
<font color="#787878">Honey, I mean,
if you can stop the next death~~</font>

435
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,327
<font color="#787878">I'm seeing clues,
but I can't piece them together.</font>

436
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,629
<font color="#787878">~ You gotta think. Who's next?
~ I don't know.</font>

437
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,331
<font color="#787878">We have to warn your friends.</font>

438
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,233
<font color="#787878">~ How?
~ Well, which one is next?</font>

439
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:59,234
<font color="#787878">~ They both die in the collapse. I don't know.
~ Nick, think. Focus.</font>

440
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:03,572
<font color="#787878">One of them had to be first, even if it was one second before the other one.</font>

441
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,210
<font color="#787878">Was it Hunt, or was it Janet?</font>

442
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:12,349
<font color="#787878">You gotta find Janet.</font>

443
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,350
<font color="#787878">I'm gonna find Hunt. Okay?</font>

444
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:38,542
<font color="#787878">Oh, God. Faster, go faster.</font>

445
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,212
<font color="#787878">Go faster, go faster. Pick it up, pick it up. Don't be lazy. Faster, faster.</font>

446
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:47,883
<font color="#787878">Stop moving, stop moving, stop moving. Move. Oh!</font>

447
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:51,419
<font color="#787878">No, come on. Wake up.
No, we're not done. I'm not done.</font>

448
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,057
<font color="#787878">Come on.</font>

449
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,627
<font color="#787878">No, no.</font>

450
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:58,562
<font color="#787878">Are you fucking kidding me?</font>

451
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,466
<font color="#787878">I finished, like, four minutes ago.</font>

452
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:05,467
<font color="#787878">~ Ever play "Donkey Punch"?
~ Dick.</font>

453
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:36,831
<font color="#787878">Excuse me, miss,
but could you help a struggling artist?</font>

454
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:42,604
<font color="#787878">Sure.</font>

455
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:49,344
<font color="#787878">~ Thanks.
~ Have a nice day.</font>

456
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:52,347
<font color="#787878">Let's see what we got here, Browning.</font>

457
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:56,518
<font color="#787878">A penny? That's some bullshit.</font>

458
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:03,525
<font color="#787878">Oh, damn it.</font>

459
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:11,366
<font color="#787878">Great.</font>

460
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:27,382
<font color="#787878">Come on, you custom piece of shit.</font>

461
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:34,057
<font color="#787878">Come on, pick up the phone. Come on.</font>

462
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:37,058
<font color="#787878">Aah. Where are you at? Come on.</font>

463
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,920
<font color="#787878">This is Hunt. You know what to do.</font>

464
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,921
<font color="#787878">Hunt, listen to me, buddy, listen. No water, okay? Stay away from water.</font>

465
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,366
<font color="#787878">You have three messages marked urgent.</font>

466
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:29,444
<font color="#787878">That's funny, huh?</font>

467
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,450
<font color="#787878">~ Give me the gun.
~ No....</font>

468
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:36,119
<font color="#787878">Give me the fucking gun.</font>

469
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,120
<font color="#787878">No.</font>

470
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:53,802
<font color="#787878">Fucked up my phone.</font>

471
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:04,305
<font color="#787878">Shit.</font>

472
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:09,711
<font color="#787878">Perfect.</font>

473
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,558
<font color="#787878">Hey, Lori, I'm at the car wash.
I'll call you back.</font>

474
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:24,060
<font color="#787878">Janet, wait. Wait. Shit.</font>

475
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:26,363
<font color="#787878">Do you know if there's a car wash
around here?</font>

476
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:29,364
<font color="#787878">~ Yeah, there's one on 18th.
~ We gotta go there.</font>

477
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:36,738
<font color="#787878">Yes. I own you, machine.</font>

478
00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:10,507
<font color="#787878">Lori?</font>

479
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:13,443
<font color="#787878">~ What's so important?
~ Don't go near water.</font>

480
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:14,611
<font color="#787878">What? Water?</font>

481
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:17,080
<font color="#787878">~ Don't go near water!
~ Water? Lori?</font>

482
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:20,081
<font color="#787878">Wait. Lori?</font>

483
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:37,966
<font color="#787878">Shit.</font>

484
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,648
<font color="#787878">No service.</font>

485
00:45:51,649 --> 00:45:54,649
<font color="#787878">Shit.</font>

486
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:04,225
<font color="#787878">Come on, come on, come on.</font>

487
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:09,499
<font color="#787878">Come on.</font>

488
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,002
<font color="#787878">Lord, no.</font>

489
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:14,437
<font color="#787878">Close!</font>

490
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:19,507
<font color="#787878">Oh, stop it! Oh, my God, no!</font>

491
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:25,179
<font color="#787878">Oh, God! Help me!</font>

492
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,293
<font color="#787878">Please! Somebody, please!</font>

493
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:45,135
<font color="#787878">Pick up the phone, Janet.</font>

494

496
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,550
<font color="#787878">We're almost there.</font>

497
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:10,124

~ Hurry.</font>

500
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,905

506
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:06,641
<font color="#787878">Come here, I got you. I got you.</font>

507
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:31,599
<font color="#787878">Hunt.</font>

508
00:50:12,243 --> 00:50:14,143
<font color="#787878">~ So do you have insurance?
~ Yeah.</font>

509
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:17,144
<font color="#787878">What are we supposed to do now?</font>

510
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,848
<font color="#787878">I mean, what's gonna happen to us?</font>

511
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:24,719
<font color="#787878">You know,
saving Janet either destroyed death's list....</font>

512
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,755
<font color="#787878">and all of us are home free,
or it skips her for now and then....</font>

513
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:33,663
<font color="#787878">And I'm next.</font>

514
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:35,932
<font color="#787878">George, you can't give up.</font>

515
00:50:35,933 --> 00:50:38,933
<font color="#787878">~ No, it's okay.
~ What do you mean, "it's okay"?</font>

516
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:42,837
<font color="#787878">~ I mean, maybe if we all stick together~~
~ No, I'm at peace with it.</font>

517
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:46,207
<font color="#787878">And, um, my family's waiting for me.</font>

518
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:51,512
<font color="#787878">I'm ready to go.</font>

519
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,772
<font color="#787878">When we're done in here, we need to make sure to safe-proof the bedroom next.</font>

520
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:58,012
<font color="#787878">I don't understand
how George can be so calm about things.</font>

521
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:02,516
<font color="#787878">~ Maybe he was in shock.
~ No, that's not it.</font>

522
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:06,287
<font color="#787878">It was very clear. It's....
It's like he just accepted it.</font>

523
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:10,925
<font color="#787878">I think he's given up.</font>

524
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:14,464
<font color="#787878">If he dies, I'm next.</font>

525
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:17,465
<font color="#787878">And when that happens,
maybe you should just keep your distance.</font>

526
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:20,534
<font color="#787878">Babe, what are you talking about?
Come on.</font>

527
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:24,774
<font color="#787878">I don't want anything to happen to you.</font>

528
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:27,775
<font color="#787878">And if we're together, it makes it easier for death to take both of us.</font>

529
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:31,479
<font color="#787878">I don't care what happens.
We are in this together.</font>

530
00:52:39,123 --> 00:52:42,123
<font color="#787878">Look.</font>

531
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:47,296
<font color="#787878">Maybe no one else has to die.</font>

532
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:50,233
<font color="#787878">We should go tell George.</font>

533
00:52:52,403 --> 00:52:55,403
<font color="#787878">Hello?</font>

534
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,841
<font color="#787878">George.</font>

535
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:04,879
<font color="#787878">We think saving Janet broke the chain.</font>

536
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,920
<font color="#787878">George?</font>

537
00:53:31,108 --> 00:53:34,108
<font color="#787878">~ George?
~ George?</font>

538
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:41,582
<font color="#787878">Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No. George~~</font>

539
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:45,419
<font color="#787878">Oh, my God. Are you crazy?
After everything that we've been through.</font>

540
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:48,424
<font color="#787878">Why are you trying to kill yourself?</font>

541
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:50,727
<font color="#787878">Trying to give God
what I thought he wanted.</font>

542
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:53,728
<font color="#787878">I've been trying to kill myself all day.</font>

543
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:57,266
<font color="#787878">Took a bottle of painkillers.
I just threw them up.</font>

544
00:53:57,267 --> 00:54:00,267
<font color="#787878">Then I went to the garage,
hooked a hose from the tailpipe....</font>

545
00:54:00,304 --> 00:54:02,438
<font color="#787878">stuck it inside the car,
the car kept stalling.</font>

546
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,640
<font color="#787878">Then....</font>

547
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:11,814
<font color="#787878">So wait.</font>

548
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:14,815
<font color="#787878">Saving Janet
must have destroyed the list, then.</font>

549
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,258
<font color="#787878">I think congratulations are in order.</font>

550
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,826
<font color="#787878">To breaking the chain.</font>

551
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:26,827
<font color="#787878">~ Apple cider?
~ Thank you.</font>

552
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:29,165
<font color="#787878">~ Thank God.
~ And a toast.</font>

553
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:30,433
<font color="#787878">Mm-hm.</font>

554
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:31,901
<font color="#787878">~ To life.
~ To life.</font>

555
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:34,902
<font color="#787878">~ To life.
~ Yes.</font>

556
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,340
<font color="#787878">Mm....</font>

557
00:54:37,341 --> 00:54:40,341
<font color="#787878">We've been given a second chance.
So, what are you guys gonna do with it?</font>

558
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:43,513
<font color="#787878">~ I have a few plans for us....
~ Uh, oh-oh.</font>

559
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:46,514
<font color="#787878">Lots of travelling, like Paris,
maybe some beaches, St.-Tropez.</font>

560
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,685
<font color="#787878">I'm just thankful we have our whole lives ahead of us, you know?</font>

561
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:53,156
<font color="#787878">Yeah.</font>

562
00:54:53,157 --> 00:54:56,157
<font color="#787878">Now this is over,
I'm not gonna take another day for granted.</font>

563
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,962
<font color="#787878">Ever.</font>

564
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,963
<font color="#787878">You know, maybe it's time to stop talking about doing stuff and actually start doing it.</font>

565
00:55:04,201 --> 00:55:07,201
<font color="#787878">~ You only live once, right?
~ That's what I'm talking about.</font>

566
00:55:09,206 --> 00:55:10,706
<font color="#787878">Let me get the cookies.</font>

567
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:17,180
<font color="#787878">We made it.</font>

568
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:20,181
<font color="#787878">We did.</font>

569
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,634
<font color="#787878">~ Hey.
~ Hey, babe.</font>

570
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:41,237
<font color="#787878">~ Did you get the traveller's checks?
~ Yes, I did.</font>

571
00:55:41,238 --> 00:55:43,039
<font color="#787878">Need anything from the mall?</font>

572
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,907
<font color="#787878">No, I think we're good.</font>

573
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:47,076
<font color="#787878">You sure you don't wanna come
to the movie?</font>

574
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:49,645
<font color="#787878">~ It's in 3-D.
~ Love Lays Dying?</font>

575
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:52,515
<font color="#787878">Yeah, I think I'll be all right.
Sounds like a chick-flick.</font>

576
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:55,484
<font color="#787878">But, uh, I'll have everything packed by the time you get home.</font>

577
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:58,087
<font color="#787878">Amsterdam, here we come.</font>

578
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:01,088
<font color="#787878">I can't believe we're actually going. Um, heh~~</font>

579
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:04,191
<font color="#787878">You know, Janet is so incredibly jealous.</font>

580
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:07,063
<font color="#787878">speaking of, she's walking up right now. I'm gonna run, okay?</font>

581
00:56:07,064 --> 00:56:08,698
<font color="#787878">~ Tell her I said hi.
~ I will.</font>

582
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:10,433
<font color="#787878">~ Love you.
~ Love you too. Be home soon.</font>

583
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:11,934
<font color="#787878">~ Bye.
~ Bye.</font>

584
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:14,935
<font color="#787878">~ Hi.
~ Hi....</font>

585
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:50,571
<font color="#787878">John Doe, the unknown survivor
of the speedway crash....</font>

586
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:53,607
<font color="#787878">has finally been named
now that his family's been notified.</font>

587
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:56,977
<font color="#787878">Jonathan Groves was rescued
in the rubble.</font>

588
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:03,386
<font color="#787878">George, how fast can you meet me
at the hospital?</font>

589
00:57:03,387 --> 00:57:05,154
<font color="#787878">Look, man, we got the order wrong.</font>

590
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:07,590
<font color="#787878">Remember that guy who sat in front of me? The cowboy?</font>

591
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:10,591
<font color="#787878">He didn't die, which means he's next. Look, just be there in five. I'm on my way.</font>

592
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:25,174
<font color="#787878">You feeling okay, Mr. Suby?</font>

593
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,677
<font color="#787878">Ha. Why do you care?</font>

594
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:30,678
<font color="#787878">You know how many of your kind
I killed in Korea?</font>

595
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:34,016
<font color="#787878">~ I'm Chinese, sir.
~ Ha, same difference.</font>

596
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,185
<font color="#787878">I need you in PT 3 right now.</font>

597
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:37,853
<font color="#787878">~ Okay.
~ And I do mean now.</font>

598
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,522
<font color="#787878">~ Okay.
~ Thank you.</font>

599
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:42,024
<font color="#787878">Be back in a few minutes
to get you into that tub.</font>

602
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:53,367
<font color="#787878">Forgot to turn the water off.</font>

603
00:57:53,537 --> 00:57:56,537
<font color="#787878">Help.</font>

604
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:02,142
<font color="#787878">Help. Somebody help.</font>

605
00:58:02,346 --> 00:58:05,147
<font color="#787878">~ Dr. Finn, extension 2861.
~ Somebody help.</font>

606
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,683
<font color="#787878">Dr. Finn, extension 2861.</font>

607

608
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,250
<font color="#787878">Where's Lori?</font>

609
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:44,251
<font color="#787878">I've been calling and 'texting' all afternoon. She's not picking up.</font>

610
00:58:44,488 --> 00:58:47,488
<font color="#787878">Maybe it won't matter. Come on.</font>

611
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:07,107
<font color="#787878">How can there be someone else on the list? He didn't leave the racetrack with us.</font>

612
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,211
<font color="#787878">If I would've asked him to move
like in the premonition, he would've died.</font>

613
00:59:11,782 --> 00:59:14,283
<font color="#787878">He survived.
That's why you couldn't kill yourself.</font>

614
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:17,253
<font color="#787878">You weren't next, he was.
It wasn't destined at all.</font>

615
00:59:17,254 --> 00:59:20,254
<font color="#787878">So if he dies, I'm next again.</font>

616
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:24,360
<font color="#787878">Great, man.</font>

617
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:26,862
<font color="#787878">~ Excuse me.
~ Dr. Taylor to Pathology.</font>

618

619
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:54,221
<font color="#787878">Yeah.</font>

620
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:22,416
<font color="#787878">~ Those are really hot.
~ Yes. I love these. I like how they~~</font>

621
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,489
<font color="#787878">~ Oh!
~ Aah! What the hell?</font>

622
01:00:30,527 --> 01:00:32,695
<font color="#787878">Ow!</font>

623
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:35,696
<font color="#787878">Ugh, hey. Stop~~</font>

624
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:48,041
<font color="#787878">That's genius. Someone could get killed.</font>

625
01:00:52,516 --> 01:00:55,017
<font color="#787878">~ Man, I'm feeling something.
~ Don't lose hope, man.</font>

626
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:58,018
<font color="#787878">If we keep an eye out for signs of danger, I think we got a shot.</font>

627
01:00:58,188 --> 01:01:01,188
<font color="#787878">~ Let's just go find Lori and Janet.
~ No, no, not that. I mean, it's like dejà vu.</font>

628
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,827
<font color="#787878">My wife said that dejà vu
is like God's way of~~</font>

629
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:09,830
<font color="#787878">~ Oh, my goodness. Hurry, let's go.
~ Okay.</font>

630
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,347
<font color="#787878">~ Oh, thank you very much.
~ Okay, thanks.</font>

631
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,050
<font color="#787878">Hi. Do you have these in a six?</font>

632
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:30,519
<font color="#787878">Yes, we bring them in fresh every day.</font>

633
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,555
<font color="#787878">~ Hello.
~ Oh!</font>

634
01:01:32,556 --> 01:01:34,190
<font color="#787878">~ Cool, let's go.
~ What do you think?</font>

635
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,524
<font color="#787878">Ah....</font>

636
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:38,525
<font color="#787878">Well, they're cute yet functional.</font>

637
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:40,996
<font color="#787878">I like them.</font>

638
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:43,899
<font color="#787878">They say, "I'm getting older,
but I still like to party."</font>

639
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,735
<font color="#787878">I didn't buy them for you,
I bought them for Nick.</font>

640
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:49,736
<font color="#787878">He likes me in sneaks.</font>

641
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:57,246
<font color="#787878">Yeah, just get a 2-by-48.</font>

642
01:01:57,247 --> 01:01:58,747
<font color="#787878">Right off the corner brace?</font>

643
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:00,549
<font color="#787878">Check the measurement. It's not fitting.</font>

644
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,550
<font color="#787878">Those windows won't pass.</font>

645
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:11,460
<font color="#787878">Yeah, 90 on that.</font>

646
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:14,129
<font color="#787878">Yeah, that looks fine.</font>

647
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:15,798
<font color="#787878">Go ahead and nail it off, it's level.</font>

648
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:19,568
<font color="#787878">Yeah, around the corner.</font>

649
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,470
<font color="#787878">~ Lunch, boys.
~ Okay.</font>

650
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:24,471
<font color="#787878">Back in an hour.</font>

651
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:33,115
<font color="#787878">Is that yoghurt place still open?</font>

652
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:36,116
<font color="#787878">~ Yeah, I think they're still here.
~ Wait. My shoelace is caught.</font>

653
01:02:36,653 --> 01:02:38,587
<font color="#787878">~ What?
~ My shoelace is stuck.</font>

654
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,823
<font color="#787878">~ Oh, okay, here.
~ Just help me get it out.</font>

655
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:43,824
<font color="#787878">~ Look, I'm gonna grab your~~
~ It's not coming out, though, Janet.</font>

656
01:02:43,827 --> 01:02:45,728
<font color="#787878">~ Don't freak out.
~ Pull my leg harder.</font>

657
01:02:45,729 --> 01:02:48,230
<font color="#787878">Help me try to get it out.
It's not coming loose.</font>

658
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:51,231
<font color="#787878">~ I am trying. I'm pulling.
~ It's twisting my ankle. Ow! Ow!</font>

659
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,573
<font color="#787878">Fuck.</font>

660
01:02:57,574 --> 01:03:00,175
<font color="#787878">I should've seen that one coming.</font>

661
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:03,176
<font color="#787878">~ Are you okay?
~ Yeah, I'm okay.</font>

662
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,660
<font color="#787878">Here's two for Love Lays Dying.
Enjoy the show.</font>

663
01:03:17,661 --> 01:03:20,661
<font color="#787878">~ Thank you.
~ Thanks.</font>

664
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:22,765
<font color="#787878">~ Hi, ladies.
~ Hello.</font>

665
01:03:22,766 --> 01:03:25,766
<font color="#787878">~ Theatre 13, second door on your left.
~ Thanks.</font>

666
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:28,370
<font color="#787878">~ So, what do you want?
~ I don't know.</font>

667
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:59,166
<font color="#787878">Where the hell you going?</font>

668
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:46,780
<font color="#787878">Go. Go now. Cut him off.</font>

669
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:55,021
<font color="#787878">~ Are you fucking nuts?
~ It's just up ahead.</font>

670
01:04:55,592 --> 01:04:58,592
<font color="#787878">Hold on, pumpkin. We'll be there in no time.</font>

671
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:03,029
<font color="#787878">That's really cool.</font>

672
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:09,469
<font color="#787878">~ Down in front, asshole.
~ That's so ridiculous.</font>

673
01:05:13,977 --> 01:05:16,912
<font color="#787878">sir, move your feet.</font>

674
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,913
<font color="#787878">Put these in your ears. It's gonna get loud.</font>

675
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,651
<font color="#787878">What do you mean?</font>

676
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:24,486
<font color="#787878">Look, don't get mad at me....</font>

677
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:27,487
<font color="#787878">but do you remember
when Nick said that he could see signs....</font>

678
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,892
<font color="#787878">before something bad
was gonna happen?</font>

679
01:05:29,893 --> 01:05:32,628
<font color="#787878">Well, now I think I'm seeing them.</font>

680
01:05:33,997 --> 01:05:36,997
<font color="#787878">Lori, it's over. Nothing is gonna happen.</font>

681
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,600
<font color="#787878">~ Now can we please watch the movie?
~ I'm going.</font>

682
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:15,168
<font color="#787878">Are you kidding me?</font>

683
01:06:23,613 --> 01:06:26,613
<font color="#787878">~ Everybody off
~ We'll never make it.</font>

684
01:06:26,616 --> 01:06:28,283
<font color="#787878">It's gonna blow.</font>

685
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:31,284
<font color="#787878">Lori. Lori.</font>

~ No kidding.</font>

690
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:57,177
<font color="#787878">~ The person next to me won't shut up.

<font color="#787878">Things are happening
just like at the track.</font>

<font color="#787878">Janet, come on.
We have to leave right now.</font>

696
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:28,742
<font color="#787878">No. No, I can't keep doing this, okay? You're both nuts.</font>

697
01:07:28,912 --> 01:07:31,912
<font color="#787878">~ Janet, we gotta go. Come on.
~ No. Don't you see?</font>

698
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:35,582
<font color="#787878">This is where I was supposed to be in the first place, not that race.</font>

726
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,087
<font color="#787878">Fuck! Oh!</font>

727
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:40,426
<font color="#787878">We were wrong about the order.
What if we're wrong about the chain?</font>

728
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:42,297
<font color="#787878">Then we wouldn't be here at all.</font>

729
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:44,633
<font color="#787878">And yet here I am,
trying to watch a movie....</font>

730
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:47,536
<font color="#787878">despite my best friend going crazy next to me.</font>

731
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:57,343
<font color="#787878">Oh, fuck.</font>

732
01:11:58,181 --> 01:12:01,181
<font color="#787878">Oh, shit. Shit.</font>

733
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:49,529
<font color="#787878">It's gonna blow. Move it!</font>

734
01:12:56,939 --> 01:12:59,207
<font color="#787878">Come on. Come on.</font>

736
01:13:18,261 --> 01:13:21,196
<font color="#787878">I guess this is
how I'm gonna be remembered.</font>

737
01:13:21,197 --> 01:13:24,132
<font color="#787878">Thanks.</font>

738
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:45,720
<font color="#787878">Try to tie it off right there.</font>

739
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:48,156
<font color="#787878">That's good.</font>

740
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:49,925
<font color="#787878">Just this side of the Union City.</font>

741
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:52,926
<font color="#787878">Hey, man, excuse me.
Is this thing supposed to be this way?</font>

742
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:56,996
<font color="#787878">~ Isn't it supposed to be screwed tighter?
~ You're right.</font>

743
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,668
<font color="#787878">Tell you what,
we'll get somebody on that.</font>

744
01:13:59,669 --> 01:14:02,669
<font color="#787878">~ Pays to be safe, man. Trust me.
~ Yeah.</font>

745
01:14:03,506 --> 01:14:06,506
<font color="#787878">That's one down.</font>

746
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:11,511
<font color="#787878">You wanna meet up with them now?</font>

747
01:14:21,157 --> 01:14:23,692
<font color="#787878">~ Small mint tea.
~ Thanks.</font>

748
01:14:23,693 --> 01:14:26,294
<font color="#787878">~ Small latte for you.
~ Thank you.</font>

749
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:29,295
<font color="#787878">And for me....</font>

750
01:14:29,365 --> 01:14:31,666
<font color="#787878">Um, what the hell is that?</font>

751
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:34,667
<font color="#787878">A giant chococcino with whipped cream, chocolate syrup, caramel and sprinkles.</font>

752
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:37,105
<font color="#787878">That looks disgusting.</font>

753
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:39,874
<font color="#787878">Yeah. I'm going into a diabetic coma just looking at it.</font>

754
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:42,875
<font color="#787878">Well, what can I say, ladies?
