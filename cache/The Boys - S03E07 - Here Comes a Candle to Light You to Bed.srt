1
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:04,671
Do it!

2
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,760
I never got a chance
to say goodbye to Lenny.

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,237
You're the fucking reason he's dead.

4
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,596
You're the one who abandoned him.

5
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,349
You're a fucking monster.

6
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:16,725
It takes one to know one.

7
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:20,437
Hughie, you shot up
an untested drug from vought.

8
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,272
That was stupid and dangerous.

9
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,607
Annie.

10
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,985
I thought the drugs had fucked you up,
but this is all you.

11
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,281
Kimiko! No!

12
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,619
Nate!

13
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,862
You hurt my brother.
You're not gonna get away with it.

14
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,752
You think that soldier boy
is going after the rest of payback?

15
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:44,896
Why would he kill crimson countess?

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,922
He was your team leader.
Do you have any idea?

17
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,757
Anything?

18
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,096
You help me find the rest of my team,
and I'll help you with this homelander.

19
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:56,264
This is a bad idea.

20
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,725
Homelander helped make me
america's sweetheart.

21
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,727
Homelander is the worst of them.

22
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,396
He's gonna regret that.

23
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:06,108
A vnn special report.

24
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,986
A nation betrayed.

25
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:13,699
It's been five days, and still
nothing but lies from vought.

26
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,368
Soldier boy is still out there
and Maeve is still missing.

27
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,869
Miss Barrett, your reaction?

28
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,788
Once again, Maeve is in rehab.

29
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,558
And the soldier boy thing
really takes the cake.

30
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:25,002
He died in '84.
She is trying to incite a panic.

31
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,021
I wonder if starlight's actions
could be considered treason.

32
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,798
- Me, too.
- So, is starlight just hysterical?

33
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,259
Another woman scorned,
after homelanderjilted her?

34
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,511
Or is she trying to change the subject?

35
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,972
- From what?
- Her ties with this woman,

36
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,766
a known terrorist with the
shining light liberation army,

37
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,560
a notorious human trafficking ring.

38
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,728
Connect the dots, Cameron.

39
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,688
J" if you want to be happy j“

40
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,231
j” living a king's life j”

41
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:49,192
j" never make a pretty woman your wife j”

42
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,654
j" now, all you have to do
is just what I say j"

43
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:56,241
j" and then you may be jolly,
merry and gay j"

44
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,493
j” therefore, from a logical
point of view... j“

45
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:00,787
- what are you watching?
- Old mistakes.

46
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,205
J" uglier than you j”

47
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,249
j” from a logical... j”

48
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,126
I actually produced this piece of shit.

49
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,755
Between you and me,

50
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:13,425
soldier boy did to singing
what pantyhose did to finger-fucking.

51
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:15,927
Yeah.

52
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,222
- What'd he want?
- Um, well,

53
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,809
he wanted me to tell you
that you're out of astroglide.

54
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,811
Jesus Christ. You know,
I would say you fucks

55
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,439
are overstaying your welcome,
but what welcome?

56
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,274
I thought you
and soldier boy were friends.

57
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,193
Why, 'cause he forced
his way into my home?

58
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:35,030
Let me tell you something, kid.
I don't make friends with talent.

59
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,323
They're all the same.

60
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,825
- I mean, they're not all the same.
- Eh.

61
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,911
Come on, soldier boy was a hero, right?

62
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,206
I mean, he stormed normandy.

63
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,293
Yeah, he did. Two weeks after d-day.
For the photo op.

64
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,629
- So he didn't see any action?
- Not in Germany.

65
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,547
Sprayed a fire hose in Birmingham.

66
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,300
Some target practice at Kent state.

67
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,387
- There were rumors about dealey Plaza.
- Wait, what?

68
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,514
Yeah, and they call 'em
the "good old days."

69
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,974
The thing is, to be American

70
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:06,061
means knowing you're the hero.

71
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:11,566
So what do we do? We sweep
all our filthy shit under the rug

72
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,570
and we tell ourselves
a myth like soldier boy.

73
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:18,699
And I get stinking rich selling it.

74
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:26,915
There you are.

75
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,460
Oh, fuck me. Is he still at it?

76
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,438
J' and I can't fight j“

77
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,089
j” this feeling anymore... j“

78
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,176
You got a minute?

79
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,595
Oh, good. Lube? Huh?
Come on, I can't go in raw.

80
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,347
Please don't make eye contact.

81
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,158
Hughie, listen, these women,
they're like fine wine.

82
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,685
Okay, the older they get,
the more delicious, but the drier.

83
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,562
Mary, Lucille, come on, chop-chop.

84
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,356
Break time's over.
That shag's not gonna vacuum itself.

85
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,733
Come on.

86
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:53,900
What's the problem?

87
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,944
What's the problem? First of all,

88
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,904
I can never fire
those girls now, thank you.

89
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:01,116
And second of all,
this bed has seen two jaclyns.

90
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,827
You know that? Smith and bisset.

91
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,663
Y-You're treating it like a Reno cathouse.

92
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,123
- Jesus.
- The problem

93
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,834
is you gave me 11
of mindstorm's last-knowns.

94
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,004
So far, I've had a look at three
and found fuck all.

95
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,381
I-I'm chasing me fucking tail here, mate.

96
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,109
Sounds like that's three down
and eight to go.

97
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,986
Yeah, and that's gonna take weeks,
and weeks I don't got.

98
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,637
Egyptian cotton sheets and now,
I got to fucking burn 'em.

99
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,348
The deal was, we get the rest of my team,

100
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,350
- then we get homelander.
- And what I'm saying,

101
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,060
is I could use an hand figuring it out.

102
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:32,481
I told you. Mindstorm's a paranoid fuck.

103
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:35,293
But, hell, if you could hear everybody's
shitty thoughts, you'd be, too.

104
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:38,069
Look, he bought up all these
run-down cabins all over the place.

105
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,364
He's Howard Hughes without the piss jars.

106
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,408
He's batshit crazy.

107
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:46,119
Mindstorm's not crazy. He's bipolar.

108
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,871
- He's bipolar?
- Yeah.

109
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,873
Does he take meds for it?

110
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,625
I believe so. At least he did.

111
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,211
Girls, it smells like sex
and bengay in here.

112
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,379
Lithium prescriptions aren't that common.

113
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,089
I mean, I doubt he's making it. Maybe...

114
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,717
I-If we look at the cabins and we...

115
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,195
And then check the local pharmacies.

116
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,345
Yeah.

117
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,263
See who's handing out lithium.

118
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,518
Nice one, hughie.

119
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,978
We're gonna need more reefer.

120
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:15,899
J” thought I might j“

121
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:22,447
j” and I can't fight
this feeling anymore j”

122
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,080
hey. How you doing?

123
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,669
Look, i-I'm sorry about all this.

124
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,547
I wish I could say you get used to it,
but you never do.

125
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,133
So, where are they hiding?

126
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,306
Butcher and soldier boy.

127
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,558
Where are they?

128
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,604
Wait, is...

129
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,232
Is that concealer?

130
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,818
Do you have a bruise?

131
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,154
Yeah...

132
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,991
Do you have any idea
what you've set loose?

133
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:09,578
Butcher has powers.
I assume thanks to you.

134
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,538
They've killed crimson countess

135
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,500
and seven other heroes, Maeve, seven.

136
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:20,088
The ones that-that survived are done,
they're powerless.

137
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,592
Soldier boy fried the v
right out of their blood somehow.

138
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:28,430
Maeve, do you understand,
that could happen to any one of us.

139
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,724
Yeah.

140
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,518
That's the difference between you and me.

141
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,564
You need to be a supe.

142
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,276
I can't wait till it's over.

143
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,071
Maeve...

144
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,746
Why are you letting me live?

145
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:56,917
Maeve.

146
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,630
You know, back when things were, uh,

147
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,257
better between us...

148
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,855
I used to dream of having kids with you.

149
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,597
- Oh.
- No, I did.

150
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,475
A family. Nesting, you know.

151
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:17,354
I-I mean, can you imagine
how perfect our kids would be?

152
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,647
Sublime.

153
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,024
Twice as strong as Ryan.

154
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,611
No kid of mine would ever know
a room like this, I'll tell you that.

155
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,738
Just so you know,

156
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,659
I'll fucking shatter whatever
you try to stick up there.

157
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,370
Maeve! Don't be so crass.
We're not savages.

158
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,373
I respect what you are, even if you don't.

159
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,958
I would never force myself on you.

160
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,421
But I am gonna harvest your eggs.

161
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:51,721
That way,
if, god forbid, you do die,

162
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,057
whether by accident or choice,

163
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,559
you'll die knowing
that the very best of you carries on.

164
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,687
With me.

165
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:03,358
See, Maeve, I'm not letting you live.

166
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,694
I'm keeping you alive.

167
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:12,617
This is still a top-three day in my life.

168
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:18,123
Because today is the day I saw you scared.

169
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,433
The hell happened to you two?

170
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,477
- It is but trivial.
- Trivial, my ass.

171
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,229
Y'all look like y'all got hit by a truck.

172
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,749
Oh, my god,
you shouldn't even be on your feet.

173
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,983
Come here, come here. Come on.

174
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,694
Yeah, um, we're just gonna
go lie down for a minute.

175
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,320
Okay? Come on.

176
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,531
She insisted when you called, right?

177
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,618
Butcher is everyone's problem now.

178
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,204
We're here to help.

179
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,294
Frenchie, are you high?

180
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,087
Well, that goes without saying.

181
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:15,180
Okay, satellite view has mindstorm's place
about two miles in, due west.

182
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,431
Two miles?

183
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,017
Fuck me.

184
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,478
We could've parked closer.

185
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:26,691
So, do you mind telling us
what we're walking into here?

186
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,693
All you got to know is,

187
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,322
if he tries to make eye contact
with you, close your eyes.

188
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,240
Or what?

189
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,244
Just don't make eye contact with him,
then you got nothing to worry about.

190
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:46,294
Hey, why do you keep buying him,
like, hefty bags full of weed?

191
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,713
Better high than mental.

192
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,257
Takes the edge off his PTSD.

193
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,967
Wait, he has PTSD?

194
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,928
Yeah, I saw it at herogasm.

195
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,347
It's why he keeps blowing
the fuck out of everything.

196
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,060
We got to keep that cunt dozy as a lamb.

197
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:07,232
So, just to recap, uh, he's radioactive,

198
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,360
highly traumatized
and heavily self-medicated.

199
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,196
Feels good, feels right.

200
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,739
Tell me about it.

201
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,742
I mean, what sad bastard
self-medicates like that, eh?

202
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:15,425
Earving, sooner or later,
you're gonna have to t-t-talk about it.

203
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,803
Remember when you were nine,

204
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,806
a-and you hid in that ball pit
right over there,

205
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,019
after you p-p-p-paralyzed Lewis frankel?

206
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,771
This is just like that.

207
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:32,066
You can't hide from soldier boy.

208
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,320
We're your best pals, aren't we?

209
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,073
We got you through that erection
in the seventh grade,

210
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:42,535
that hard rock cafe m-m-massacre in Lagos.

211
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,622
And by golly,
we'll get you through this, too.

212
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,957
- That's right.
- You're our friend.

213
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,643
What'd you say?

214
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,561
- W hat?
- W hat?

215
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,690
Nothing, mate. No one said nothing.

216
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,243
Hey, hey. Uh, your... your brain's leaking.

217
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,834
Oh, fuck.

218
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,224
Oh, shit.

219
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,901
What the fuck is this shite?

220
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,322
Mum.

221
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,783
Oi, mum.

222
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,079
Fucking mindstorm.

223
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,252
Knock it off, you little fucking freak.
Come on.

224
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,004
Butcher, wake up. Wake up!

225
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,672
Fucking freak slipped away.

226
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,566
- He's gonna pick us off one by one.
- Butcher, wake up.

227
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,009
Wake up, butcher. Butcher! Wake up!

228
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,011
No, you're wasting your time, he's gone.

229
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,221
- What did mindstorm do?
- Well, if it's his usual mo,

230
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,056
trapped him in an endless nightmare

231
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,267
till he dies of terminal dehydration.

232
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,786
No, there's got to be a way
we can wake him up.

233
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,354
Mindstorm put him into this.
He can snap him out.

234
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,457
- Okay, great, great. Uh...
- But he's about to be dead.

235
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,067
Wait, wait, just hang on.
If we, if we, if we grab mindstorm,

236
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,586
- we make him help butcher...
- No way.

237
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,653
And then you can kill him.

238
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,589
Then you can go to town on him, man.
I don't give a fuck.

239
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,616
Hey. If you're gonna act hysterical,
I'm gonna slap you like I'm Connery.

240
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,703
Now, unless you want to end up
like your friend there,

241
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,038
it ain't worth the risk.

242
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,834
Look, chin up, okay? Deal's a deal.

243
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,170
You help me finish this,
I'll kill homelander.

244
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,653
Butcher would have given up his life
for that in a heartbeat.

245
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,134
So, we doing this or not?

246
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:08,765
Leave it. We got to move fast.

247
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,354
Do you hear that?

248
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,899
Uh... You might
want to lay off the weed, huh?

249
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,817
And you might want to gargle my ball sack.

250
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:42,715
Where is she?

251
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,889
Lenny! Where the fuck's Lenny?

252
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:50,973
Shit. Come on.

253
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,143
Left his bloody bike
in the garden again.

254
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,395
Lenny!

255
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:57,980
Lenny?

256
00:14:58,523 --> 00:14:59,816
Billy?

257
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,109
Leave off 'em, you cunt.

258
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,575
Gotcha.

259
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,119
Come here. Come here.

260
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,370
Come here.

261
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,705
Where is he?

262
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,416
Who?

263
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,962
Don't fuck me about. Where is he?

264
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,395
Fucking snotty little cunt.

265
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,072
Lenny, i-it's okay.

266
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,101
Jesus. I thought you quit.

267
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,895
The lord hates quitters.

268
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,774
Is that halothane?

269
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:27,069
I chucked some at him at herogasm.
The motherfucker didn't even flinch.

270
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:30,698
It will be the greatest sorrow of my life
that I missed herogasm.

271
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,617
But no, this is not halothane.

272
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,368
- You see the texture?
- Mmm.

273
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,454
- It's all wrong.
- What is it, then?

274
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,664
Well, let's find out.

275
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,921
Okay.

276
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,631
Okay.

277
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,303
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

278
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,307
It's just, uh, UN peu kétamine.

279
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,018
It's okay. You know, the...

280
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,439
Frenchie, you're a fucking mess.

281
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,490
Well, that makes two of us.

282
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,454
-J' will and what will be j“
-okay, sorry.

283
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,456
J" she's a maniac j“

284
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,875
j" maniac on the floor... j“

285
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,753
okay. Should be good.

286
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,965
Is there anything else that you need?
Are you hungry?

287
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,843
J“ she's a maniac, maniac j“

288
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,892
Oh. Kirkland.

289
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,644
A fine choice. Yeah.

290
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:56,242
Oh. When you grow up in Iowa,
there is not much else to do.

291
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,410
Here.

292
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,500
Mmm.

293
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,712
Ooh.

294
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,297
When did you have your first drink?

295
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,881
Right now?

296
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,968
Oh, my god, wow.

297
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,178
Okay, um...

298
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,390
Okay, well, cheers to that.

299
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,773
I tried.

300
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,278
He doesn't want to be saved.

301
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,825
With what?

302
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,542
What about it?

303
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,757
You want me to...

304
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,552
Kimiko, uh, hang on, hang on,
hang on, hang on. Hang on.

305
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:57,637
The...

306
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,767
You know that I can't go to the tower.

307
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,603
Even if I could,
this would be such a bad idea.

308
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,875
No, but you don't know
if it'll do that again.

309
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,068
I mean, you could get yourself killed.

310
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,779
I won't do it. I'm sorry, I can't.
I can't.

311
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,384
Still can't believe this shit is legal.

312
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,136
I locked up so many assholes
for it back in the day.

313
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:44,850
What the fuck did you say?

314
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,602
Uh, uh, literally nothing.

315
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,898
- Jesus. How hard?
- What?

316
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,651
How hard did butcher suck your dick
that you miss him that much?

317
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,070
Hmm? His mouth must feel
like a hoover deluxe.

318
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,948
God, every single thing
you say is so gross.

319
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,449
He saved me, okay?

320
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,785
More than once.

321
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,495
- So I owe him.
- Oh, bullshit.

322
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,581
You're on a mission. You get the job done.

323
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,792
Okay? I stormed normandy.

324
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,044
I fought the Nazis.

325
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,255
You want to know what I do when I'm sad
or scared?

326
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,465
Fucking nothing.

327
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,592
'Cause I'm not a fucking pussy.

328
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:25,641
You didn't storm shit.

329
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,852
Your whole Marlboro man act?

330
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,812
It's fucking crap.

331
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,398
And I... oh...

332
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,528
I warned you.

333
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,120
J“ saying I love you... j“

334
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,955
Oh, hi.

335
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,250
Babe.

336
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,094
Why don't you put that work shit down,
get that little butt over here.

337
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,672
What is the occasion?

338
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,674
Well, not a big deal.

339
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:02,261
Just, uh, found out I'm gonna be
on hannity tonight.

340
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:03,971
- Hannity, babe.
- You are?

341
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,932
- Yeah.
- Uh, when-when do you tape?

342
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,410
- We need to prep.
- No, no, no, no, babe. Don't worry.

343
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,769
I got it. I got it. Trust me.

344
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,771
- This is a big deal, Kevin.
- I know.

345
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,273
- Okay? So we need to go over everything.
- Okay, hey.

346
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,983
I got us this far, didn't I?

347
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,069
Y-you got us this far?

348
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,738
Just relax a little bit.

349
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,656
Turn around.

350
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,034
Come here. Just...

351
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,163
- Get into the moment.
- Okay.

352
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,665
But listen, I've been wanting
to talk to you about something.

353
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,710
You know that I love you.

354
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,130
- Mm-hmm.
- And I know that you love me, too.

355
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,051
But we both know that our marriage...

356
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,138
Sex life has gotten a little vanilla.

357
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,891
So maybe...

358
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,435
It's time we branch out.

359
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:56,190
- Branch out?
- Yeah. Like, um,

360
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:58,984
you know, uh, introduce a new partner.

361
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,986
Just to spice things up a little bit.

362
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,826
Well, is there anyone you had in mind?

363
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,869
Well, I'd like to introduce you
to someone.

364
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,121
Oh. Okay.

365
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:16,418
J“ then you couldn't make things new... j“

366
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,921
babe, this is ambrosius.

367
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,382
She's very pretty,
and she thinks you're superhot.

368
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,385
I, um...

369
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,721
I don't want to, uh, do that.

370
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,807
Cassandra, I need this.

371
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,978
J“ more than words j“

372
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,564
oh, fuck.

373
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,482
Ooh.

374
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:40,234
Hey there.

375
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,699
Oh, Jesus Christ.

376
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,284
Okay.

377
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,661
Ambrosius says she wants to taste you.

378
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,873
No. No. Okay, I can't.
I'm out. I'm out. No.

379
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,332
I'm-I'm done. I'm done.

380
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,459
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Honey, are you okay? What's wrong?

381
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,312
- You want me to fuck a-a fucking fish!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

382
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,046
One, she's a mollusk.

383
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,340
Two, she has feelings.

384
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,343
It's okay.

385
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,596
How long have you been fucking it
behind my back?

386
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,119
Okay, it's not an "it." It's a "her."
Get your pronouns right.

387
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:16,103
I have given up a year of my life for you.

388
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,980
I gave up my tenure at vassar.

389
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,607
I-I propped you up.

390
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,109
I've steered your comeback. And this?

391
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,945
This is how you repay me?

392
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,448
You propped me up, huh?
Right, you wrote a few lines.

393
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,451
- I'm the one who had to fucking sell it.
- Okay.

394
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:31,911
Okay, let's, um...

395
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,913
Let's see how well you do without me.

396
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:35,789
I'll be great without you.

397
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,601
Without you over-noting me
all the fucking time.

398
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,667
You're an idiot, Kevin.

399
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,712
Then why did Dave eggers say
I have a formidable intellect, huh?

400
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,381
Formidable intellect!

401
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,218
God. No, she's...

402
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,804
She just needs time to cool off, babe.

403
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,143
Come on, earving.

404
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:59,480
Me and the others have
something to sh-sh-sh-show you.

405
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,565
C-c-c-come on!

406
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,987
Something you pushed
d-d-d-deep, deep down.

407
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,675
Lighten up, gunpowder.
I'm just playing ar...

408
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,096
You fucking pussy.

409
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,308
You're late. We started at 3:00.

410
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:38,519
I really wanted that movie.

411
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,642
- The hell are you talking about?
- I just got off the phone with my manager.

412
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:44,024
It's a no-go on Beverly Hills cop.

413
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:46,378
- Oh. That.
- I was...

414
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:49,279
I was born to play Axel Foley.

415
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:52,491
Why would you say
all those horrible things about me

416
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,243
to Don Simpson?

417
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,370
- Jesus, Ben, really?
- Zip it, cooze.

418
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,788
The guy's supposed to be funny.

419
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,581
You're not funny.

420
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,959
- Well, I could've been.
- You're not good enough.

421
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,836
Now shut your cockhole and get to work.

422
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,671
But-but wait.

423
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,506
- Stop it!
- Take it easy.

424
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,664
- Stop it. You're hurting him.
- Take it easy. Calm down.

425
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,487
- For god's sake, dude.
- Take it easy. Take it easy.

426
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,347
- Guys. Guys, leave him, leave him alone.
- Don'...Get off.

427
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,783
- Get him off him.
- That's enough.

428
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,350
- Get off of him.
- That's enough!

429
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,477
- Hey, now.
- Come on. That's enough!

430
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:23,081
Which one of you wants next? Huh?

431
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:24,481
Thought so.

432
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:25,941
You think you can be me?

433
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,735
You're not a movie star.

434
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,070
You're not shit.

435
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:33,824
I see you getting out of line again,
trying to move on up,

436
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,618
I will put you in the fucking ground.
Understood?

437
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,562
Please don't tell my old man.

438
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:48,672
You were
selling marijuana, William.

439
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:50,090
You know I have to tell him.

440
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,633
And we both know your dad.

441
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,845
You're a smart boy.

442
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,765
I'd just hate for you to...
Turn out like him.

443
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,437
- Fucking snotty little cunt!
- Please stop! Please!

444
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,656
Butch, what are you doing? Stop!

445
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,369
Fuck, Lenny. I-I didn't mean to. I...

446
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,916
I-I'm-I'm sorry. I-I'm sorry.

447
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,251
I'm sorry.

448
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,007
The world's an ocean of shite, lads.

449
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,301
- You either sink...
- Or you swim.

450
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:39,473
Today, Billy, my boy, you swam.

451
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,309
Some cunts need a slap.

452
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,353
Don't they?

453
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:46,980
Here.

454
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:53,737
Oi. You ought to take a page
out of his book.

455
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,949
You don't want to be
a fucking little poof all your life.

456
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,544
Don't you listen to him.

457
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,257
Don't you listen
to that worthless lump of shite.

458
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,843
Not a bleeding word.

459
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,473
Maybe we should walk back
to that town we saw.

460
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,576
It was five miles away.
It'll take forever to get there.

461
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,120
We're never gonna get to the retreat now.

462
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,770
Oh! Oh, you startled me.

463
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,689
Son, are-are you a superhero?

464
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,292
Yes, father. You folks need some help?

465
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,818
- Yes. Yes, please.
- Okay, well, it's not safe.

466
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,153
There's a fugitive in the area.

467
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,839
You should get out of here
before you get hurt.

468
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,573
Uh, well, we can't.

469
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,575
I don't suppose
either of you know engines?

470
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:43,287
I'll have a look.

471
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,455
Oh, I'd appreciate that very much.

472
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,667
Uh, so, where you guys headed?

473
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,770
We're just on our way
to a samaritan's embrace retreat

474
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,171
over there in danville.

475
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:53,964
Oh! Oh, my god!

476
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,257
Oh, my god! What the fuck?

477
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,509
This is mindstorm's mo.
He brainwashed them.

478
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,012
That priest was gonna shank us.
And she will, too.

479
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,073
- Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Father Wallace, no!

480
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,857
Hey, hey, she doesn't
look brainwashed to me.

481
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,101
Take my word for it.
Everyone's coming for us.

482
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,061
- Everyone, every day.
- Whoa, no! No, no!

483
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:09,789
You have PTSD!

484
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,857
You have PTSD,
and you are super fucking stoned.

485
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,860
All right? Maybe this isn't
what you think it is.

486
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,820
- Move. Move!
- She's a human being. A nun.

487
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,280
And if there's one thing I know...

488
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,116
Die, you fucking cocksuckers!

489
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,951
Oh, my god! Do something!

490
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,787
- If you stay still, I...
- Fuck you! Get her off me!

491
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,540
Oh! Fuck me!

492
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,251
No! Hard pass on this exorcist shit!

493
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,735
What's black and white and red all over?

494
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:38,300
Okay, first off, I don't have shell shock.
Fuck you.

495
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,177
Second, this is what I'm talking about.

496
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,888
This is being a soldier.

497
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,186
Come on.

498
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:00,572
It's been five days,
and still nothing but lies from vought.

499
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,366
Soldier boy is still out there,

500
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,249
and Maeve is still missing.
And you know what?

501
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,871
More people are just going to die
until they admit to what's going on.

502
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,891
So, I guess
you've all heard about starlight's

503
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:13,210
"alleged" involvement
with a human trafficking ring?

504
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,419
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

505
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:16,463
And I suppose it's "pure coincidence"

506
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,216
that, uh, she opened starlight house
for runaway teens.

507
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:23,136
Huh? Come on, we can put
two and two together, can't we?

508
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,973
What the holy fuck
does he think he's doing?

509
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:27,224
Those poor kids.

510
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,851
They pass through her doors,
they disappear.

511
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,562
They are never seen again. It's horrific.

512
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,691
But we got to face the truth, people,
no matter how ugly it is.

513
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,819
Starlight is a wolf in sheep's clothing.

514
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,737
Plain and simple. She fooled me.

515
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,173
She fooled you. She fooled all of us.

516
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,033
Right? Now she wants to take me down. Why?

517
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:48,495
Because with me out of the way,
there is no one who can stop her.

518
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,205
No one, and she knows it.

519
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,707
- No chance.
- Exactly.

520
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,167
Do you think the media,
our buddies over here...

521
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,211
Do you think the media
is gonna report on that?

522
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:58,755
No, no, no, no, no. Of course not.

523
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:15,647
Ah. Tell you what. You guys, love you!

524
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,233
All right!

525
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:21,778
And vote for Bob singer.
He's, uh, he's... great.

526
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,240
Let's hear it for homelander.

527
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,558
J“ ah j“

528
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:57,481
j“ now I don't hardly know her j“

529
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:03,612
j“ crimson and clover j“

530
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:08,784
j'ahj'

531
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:15,290
j“ I wish she 'd come walking over j“

532
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,586
j“ now I've been waiting to show j“

533
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,797
skip breakfast, did we?

534
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,967
Nope.

535
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:28,178
Nope. Uh...

536
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,305
She's in pain, so I tried to help.

537
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,784
Look, I'm gonna tell you the truth here
because no one else will.

538
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,519
Pull your shit together,
admit it's soldier boy

539
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,312
and take control of the situation.

540
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,274
You think, uh, I'm not in control?

541
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:45,195
No. I think you just spent the last
20 minutes ranting about starlight

542
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,906
instead of talking up
the next president of the United States.

543
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:52,327
You're homelander.
Button your shit up. You're flailing.

544
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,971
This whole fucking scene
right here. Jesus Christ...

545
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,540
Oh, I'm sorry.

546
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,666
Go on, please.

547
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,335
You need someone you can trust.

548
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,462
- Someone like you?
- I got rid of Edgar for you.

549
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,423
That cost me a lot.

550
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:08,135
I'm proposing a strictly
transactional relationship.

551
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:12,055
You help me out with one small favor,

552
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,349
and I help you.

553
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:33,785
Where did you get this?

554
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:46,590
You're awake. Fantastic.

555
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,341
What happened?

556
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,052
Pretty fucking nuts, man.

557
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:55,599
I mean, how soldier boy attacked you
and blue hawk at herogasm.

558
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,311
Yeah.

559
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:02,564
Soldier boy murdered blue hawk
right in front of you.

560
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:07,152
You tried to save blue hawk,
of course, but...

561
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,572
Must've been awful for you.

562
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,452
Yeah.

563
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:18,121
It seemed like you two were on your way
to a healing place,

564
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,040
which is why you're gonna love this.

565
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:24,044
Blue hawk will live on
because we gave you his heart.

566
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,301
A super-abled heart.

567
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,303
No more heart disease.

568
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,888
You're gonna get to run again.

569
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,431
Can I get a "what-what"?

570
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:40,060
Look, you'll need insane amounts of rehab,
but luckily, you heal fast, bro.

571
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,478
That's...

572
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,688
We're gonna get you back in your old suit.

573
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,649
We're gonna get you out there asap.

574
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,734
You're okay talking shit about starlight?

575
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,028
- Yeah, sure. Why?
- Oh, amazing.

576
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,404
Oh, my god, I almost forgot.

577
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,740
We are already
working on your new movie.

578
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,991
Training a-train.

579
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,868
Gritty biopic.

580
00:33:56,952 --> 00:34:00,747
You're a roughneck gangbanger
from the south side slanging that yayo

581
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,333
when a track coach...
We're thinking Tom Hanks...

582
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,960
Teaches you a more civilized way.

583
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:09,089
That's not at all how that happened.

584
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,549
My brother's my coach.

585
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,360
We're out to sir Julian
fellowes to write, so...

586
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,111
- No. I'm not doing that.
- You're gonna love it.

587
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:17,472
Anyway, I got to bounce.
But the a-train's back, baby!

588
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:18,848
- Right?
- Uh...

589
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,225
That's your...

590
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,018
Okay.

591
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:28,918
Senator bishop, will you confirm
you're about to join the ticket

592
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,169
as the vice presidential candidate?

593
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,446
Well, if! Was lucky enough to be
so honored, you'll be the first to know.

594
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,740
And now,
if you will all excuse us,

595
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:39,411
I want to get a deep-fried twinkie
before my wife finds out.

596
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,427
It's not a gas.

597
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,304
- W hat?
- It's vapor.

598
00:34:57,387 --> 00:34:59,931
Vapor. Vapor. Just a delivery system.

599
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,314
- This.
- You think I can read this shit?

600
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:08,732
Novichok.

601
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,108
Russian nerve agent.

602
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,944
Expose you or moi to novichok,
our nervous system shuts down.

603
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,113
Multiple organs fail. Painful death.

604
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,324
But for soldier boy, it's a nap.

605
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:19,075
All right. So where can we get some?

606
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,077
Another vacation to Russia?

607
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:32,964
Motherfucker.

608
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,925
Huh? Qu'est-ce que c'est?

609
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,515
No clue.

610
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,771
You're still hurt.

611
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:49,606
I'm still high.

612
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:59,658
J“ stars shining bright above you j“

613
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,786
j“ night breezes j“

614
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:06,373
j“ seem to whisper "I love you" j“

615
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:11,836
j“ birds singing in a sycamore tree j“

616
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:17,300
j“ dream a little dream of me j“

617
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:24,391
j“ say nighty night and kiss me j“

618
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:30,897
j“ just hold me tight
and tell me you'll miss me j“

619
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:35,568
j“ while I'm alone and blue as can be j“

620
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,153
none taken.

621
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:42,117
J“ dream a little dream of me j“

622
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,287
j“ stars fading j“

623
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:49,582
j“ but I linger on, dear j“

624
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:55,380
j“ still craving your kiss j“

625
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,841
j“ I'm longing j“

626
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,092
what do you mean?

627
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,845
J“ to linger till dawn, dearj“

628
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,640
j“ just saying this... j“

629
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,978
why? This is everything
you said you did not want.

630
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,731
No. Listen to me. Listen to me.

631
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,358
You can walk away. You and me.

632
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,277
We go together to Marseille.

633
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,654
Your freedom, your humanité.

634
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,740
You have it. Mon coeur, please.

635
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,700
Si! Te plait, don't do this.

636
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,298
"Annie.

637
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,885
I know I'm asking a lot.

638
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,140
At first I hated the v
because I didn't choose it.

639
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,185
But now it's my choice.

640
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:53,104
I think that matters.

641
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:04,491
I blamed my powers for my problems.

642
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,118
But it's not true.

643
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,162
The v isn't good or bad.

644
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,623
It just depends on the person using it.

645
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,709
I wanted to use my powers to do good.

646
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,005
To fight for the ones I love.

647
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,679
I almost lost frenchie
because I couldn't fight.

648
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,475
I can't risk that again."

649
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,951
Oui.

650
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,143
Oh, my god.

651
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:03,610
Jesus Christ.

652
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:08,489
By 1984, things had gotten so bad.

653
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:10,575
There was only so much m-m-more

654
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,553
of soldier boy's abuse you could take.

655
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:17,206
So when st-st-Stan Edgar
made you an offer in Nicaragua,

656
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,583
you jumped at it.

657
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,335
Vought's really okay with this?

658
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,463
Sometimes, old soldiers just fade away.

659
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,131
I don't want the details.

660
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,133
- Just do what you need to do.
- Why now?

661
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,636
Vogelbaum has a replacement.

662
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,845
Just a child,

663
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,431
but they're convinced
he'll be stronger than soldier boy.

664
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,516
And he can fly.

665
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:39,020
- Will the others go along?
- Everyone but gunpowder.

666
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,480
Good luck, earving.

667
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:44,192
Can you please stop eating those
in front of me? I'm allergic.

668
00:40:58,331 --> 00:40:59,415
What the fuck is this?

669
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:02,919
Something we should've done
a long time ago, you piece of shit.

670
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:05,088
Tnt detonate!

671
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,886
Hold him down.

672
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,351
Fucking piece of shit.

673
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,700
Get him, mindstorm.

674
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:36,285
- Scramble his fucking brains.
- No!

675
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,128
Fuck you, motherfucker.

676
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,678
This is some tough stuff, I know.

677
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,722
But when you gave him to the Russians,

678
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,558
you knew soldier boy
would come back one day.

679
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,019
You need to f-f-f-face him.

680
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:04,397
No one really knows you.

681
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,026
But we know how s-sensitive

682
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,528
- and s-s-scared you are.
- Yes.

683
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,822
- Hey, we got your back.
- We're here for you.

684
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,032
It's okay.

685
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,659
Bravery isn't having no fear.

686
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:19,287
Bravery is having fear,

687
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,998
but you d-d-d-do it anyway.

688
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:26,335
Time to finish what you started.

689
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,911
- Get the fuck out the car.
- What's wrong?

690
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:49,984
You heard me.

691
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,503
- Daddy?
- Hey, baby.

692
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,088
I need you to go
inside the house with your mama.

693
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,490
Daddy needs to talk to Todd alone.

694
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,866
- Okay.
- All right.

695
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:00,929
- Marvin, what are you doing here?
- You're okay with this?

696
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,163
- What?
- He took her

697
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,540
- to a homelander rally.
- Yeah, so?

698
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:07,418
Excuse me. You took her where?

699
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,254
- It's fine.
- No, it is not fine. You didn't ask me.

700
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,884
Janine. Come on. Inside, honey.

701
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,595
Everything's fine. Just relax.

702
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,846
Don't tell me to relax, Todd.

703
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,015
Soldier boy is out there
gunning for homelander.

704
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,975
Do you have any idea

705
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:25,061
what kind of danger
you put my baby girl in?

706
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,896
There's no danger.

707
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,940
Starlight is making all that up.

708
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,818
Read any news
outside the establishment media.

709
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:34,278
Todd, Todd, they're lying.

710
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:36,239
- Really? All of them?
- All of them.

711
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,991
Homelander is lying to you.

712
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:41,786
- He's a fucking psychopath.
- Worse than starlight?

713
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,873
She's trafficking kids
the same age as Janine,

714
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,708
as the... as the kids in my classroom.

715
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,211
Homelander is the only one
protecting them.

716
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,046
Okay, you guys. That's enough.

717
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,816
Homelander ain't protecting shit,
all right?

718
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,800
He's feeding you this insane fairy tale,

719
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,761
and you're too fucking stupid
and-and brainwashed to fucking see it!

720
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:01,430
- Hey, fuck you.
- Both of you, stop.

721
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:05,893
You know what?

722
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:10,523
If you want to risk your life, fine.
Have at it.

723
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,567
But not with my baby girl.

724
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,985
You're not her father.

725
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,319
Someone's got to be.

726
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,365
.Marvin!

727
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:20,634
Oh, my god, Todd.

728
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,702
Todd. Oh, my god, Todd.

729
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,705
Todd. Todd. Open your eyes. Wake up.

730
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:46,350
Here she is.

731
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:50,104
Did you think I wouldn't know
the second you walked through the door?

732
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,732
Well, we broke up.

733
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,819
It was time to pack my shit and go.

734
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,616
Okay.

735
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,784
So, here's what happens now.

736
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,828
You're gonna march into vnn studios,

737
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:08,122
and you're gonna recant
everything you said.

738
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:12,293
It was a tragic cocktail
of heartbreak, Zoloft and despair.

739
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:16,964
You regret any harm that your lies
have caused vought or me,

740
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:19,383
but me in particular.

741
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,093
- Mmm. Okay.
- Good.

742
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:24,388
Okay. But, um,
you want to hear my counter?

743
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:27,433
I stop soldier boy
before he murders more people,

744
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,477
and I find Maeve.

745
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,146
If she's still alive.

746
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,649
Maeve's just learning her manners.

747
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,360
And you should do the same.

748
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,572
Seriously, before you throw away
everything you've worked so hard for.

749
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,376
- Hmm?
- You know what? I could give a shit.

750
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,368
Really? You sure about that?

751
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:49,038
Your fame is the only thing
protecting you.

752
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,208
Here's the thing.

753
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,669
I'm not scared of you anymore.

754
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,338
I'm not. I see who you are.

755
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,257
I see how small you are.

756
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,135
I saw it.

757
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:09,016
I saw it the night
that you killed supersonic.

758
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,310
You know what I remember from that night?

759
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,023
I remember what I told you
would happen to hughie.

760
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,902
You walk, that's next.

761
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,865
Good luck with that.

762
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:30,079
Now that you've told
my 190 million followers.

763
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,331
I'm still pretty famous.

764
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:34,017
Hey, everybody!

765
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,710
Oh, that's me.

766
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:36,961
I got to go.

767
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,212
Starlight, uh, wait.

768
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:41,716
You're not supposed to record us
when we're running lines.

769
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:56,998
Shit!

770
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,312
- What the hell?
- Okay, wait! Wait.

771
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:02,838
- Why the fuck am I naked?
- I can explain, okay?

772
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:04,256
You're with soldier boy.

773
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,940
- You're trying to fucking kill me.
- No!

774
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,219
- No. No, I just saved your life.
- Leave me alone!

775
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,238
Please, calm down.
I only want to talk, okay? Just talk.

776
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,597
I'm not bothering anyone.

777
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,283
I'm just trying to get away
from all the fucking voices.

778
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,910
I'm just trying to get away
from the voices.

779
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:16,244
I'm just trying to get away
from the voices!

780
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,604
Hey, hey. I'm gonna
open my eyes, all right?

781
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,690
Please don't coma me.

782
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,320
Okay. Hey. We're cool.

783
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:27,947
Very chill. Very cool.

784
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,868
Also, we-we don't have to do this naked.

785
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:34,161
All right?

786
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:35,996
Just-just clothes. They're clothes.

787
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,290
I'm gonna reach in.
I'm gonna grab you some, okay?

788
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,049
Look. Look, hey, I don't want to be here.

789
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:49,009
H was pretending to be someone I'm not.

790
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,929
I'm not like soldier boy.
That guy's full of shit.

791
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,722
I mean, no one is that tough, and then...

792
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:56,642
And the people who say they are?
They're lying.

793
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,602
And I'm... I'm done.

794
00:48:58,686 --> 00:48:59,895
I want to go home.

795
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:03,149
So, I'm just... I'm begging you...

796
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,152
To please wake up my friend.

797
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,297
I've been inside his head.

798
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:11,174
- That guy's a piece of shit.
- It doesn't matter.

799
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,659
I-I don't want to be someone
who leaves people behind.

800
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,387
I want to be someone who saves his family.

801
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:16,871
And for better or worse...

802
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,457
He's family.

803
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,083
- Please wake him up.
- No.

804
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,647
- No way.
- I can get you out of here.

805
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,963
If you just please, please wake him up,

806
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,923
I'll teleport you away.

807
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:32,219
You'll be safe away from everyone,
including soldier boy.

808
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,929
I'll take you wherever you want to go.

809
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,726
And I will never tell a soul
where that is.

810
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,894
Hand to god.

811
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:50,321
No. Not here.

812
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,822
So, that's it then, Billy?

813
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:54,658
Jesus, Lenny.

814
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:58,704
Just gonna piss off,
no goodbye or nothing like that?

815
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:01,582
I'll be back Christmas, once I got
everything sorted at the barracks,

816
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,709
you can maybe come out and see me.

817
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:07,171
Billy. Please don't leave me
alone with him.

818
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,256
I can't hack it.

819
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,218
You'll be all right.

820
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,014
No, he won't. Fucking listen to him.

821
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,766
If I stay, I'm gonna end up killing him,

822
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,643
get sent off to borstal, or prison,

823
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,603
and what's that gonna do to mum, hmm?

824
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,481
Break her bloody heart, is what it'd do.

825
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:30,486
Besides, the old cunt hates me the most,

826
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,489
so maybe if I'm gone, he'll leave you be.

827
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,407
You stupid fucking twat.
Don't you leave him.

828
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:38,702
I got to go, len.

829
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,789
- Billy, please.
- Leave off.

830
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:45,000
For fuck's sake, Lenny,
it ain't my job to look after you.

831
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:48,337
Don't be such a fucking poof
all your life.

832
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:00,683
Right.

833
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:07,439
Please, don't go.

834
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,845
You served me up to him on a plate.

835
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:41,849
No, I... I didn't.

836
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,142
I-I wouldn't.

837
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,979
It's been six months,
and you come home to check on me

838
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,355
not once.

839
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:49,857
Len, i-I'm sorry, but they...

840
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,693
They just wouldn't let me out
of the barracks.

841
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:03,037
Oh, Jesus, please. Please, fuck, no.

842
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,920
He's beating the living shit
out of me, Billy.

843
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:06,665
Day in and day out.

844
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,251
- I can't take no more.
- Please, len, don't.

845
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:12,379
You fucking knew what he'd do.
It's your fault.

846
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,715
No, don't say that.
That's... that's not true.

847
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,133
I... I'm not that bastard.

848
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:19,553
Come off it, Billy. You always have been.

849
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:24,391
'Cause anyone who's ever loved you,
you end up getting them killed, don't you?

850
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:29,146
Me. Becca.

851
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,314
Now, hughie,

852
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,358
the last person on god's green earth

853
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:34,801
trying to stop you from being a monster,
and what do you do?

854
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:36,737
Drag him down to your level.

855
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:40,616
When he dies, and he will,

856
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:43,243
then no one can stop you.

857
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:46,830
Can they?

858
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:48,499
No!

859
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:49,708
-Lenny, no! {Gunshofl

860
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,841
I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry!

861
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:59,510
Sorry for what?

862
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,181
- Hughie.
- It's okay, butcher.

863
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,183
It's okay. You're all right.

864
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,310
Here. You're okay.

865
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:09,561
Hey, kid.

866
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,690
Right, right, yeah.

867
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:15,442
Okay. Deal's a deal.

868
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:17,528
Where we headed?

869
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:31,333
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

870
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,187
Hiya, Dan.

871
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,189
It's-it's not what you think.
It wasn't my idea.

872
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:57,109
Oh, I know. It was noir's,
but how does that work, huh?

873
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,820
'Cause no way he makes a fucking move
without vought.

874
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:02,184
- They gave him the green light.
- Why would they do that?

875
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,247
What? That's impossible.

876
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,490
What'd he say?

877
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:22,486
Hello?

878
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:25,155
- I need to talk to hughie. Where is he?
- Oh, starlight.

879
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:26,448
How delightful.

880
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:28,575
He's just popped out for a bit.

881
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:29,928
Okay, well, he's not answering his phone.

882
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:32,871
Bit hard to keep a phone when
you're teleporting all day, innit, love?

883
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:36,375
- How can I help?
- Temp v is gonna kill you both.

884
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,252
Well, it's gonna have to join the queue.

885
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,504
I was just in the lab. It causes lesions.

886
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:43,674
Okay? It turns your brain
into fucking Swiss cheese,

887
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,384
so, please, be honest with me,

888
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,678
and tell me how many doses have you taken?

889
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:51,890
- Just a couple.
- Jesus Christ.

890
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:55,143
Butcher, three to five doses kills you.

891
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,688
You need to tell hughie.

892
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:02,359
Yeah, yeah. I will, I will. I promise.

893
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,153
Okay, but I'm calling back
every five minutes until...

894
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:06,738
Butcher?

895
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:09,825
Goddamn it.

896
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,509
Okay.

897
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,832
Hi. Only thing open
was long John silver's,

898
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:20,085
so, I guess that's kind of
fish and chips, right?

899
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,170
Yeah.

900
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:24,965
- Nice one.
- Everything all right?

901
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,846
It's, uh...

902
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,436
- It's the temp v.
- What about it?

903
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:51,408
We got to swing by the office
and get some more.

904
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,626
And then you, me,

905
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:04,421
and granny fucker are gonna
finish this fucking job.

906
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,551
Yeah, fuck yeah.

907
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:23,833
- Your call has been fon/varded...
- Fuck.

908
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,984
Do you think monsieur charcutier
will tell hughie?

909
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:27,527
Do you?

910
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:39,915
I'm gonna save hughie,

911
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,168
even if he doesn't want me to.

912
00:58:07,693 --> 00:58:09,027
Ready, mon coeur?

913
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,576
Enjoy them

914
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,746
before they feel like bendy straws again.

915
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,515
Mon coeur?

916
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:20,515
Obviously, I didn't realize
the little bitch was recording me, did I?

917
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,142
No, no. A...

918
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,352
Ashley, I don't fucking care.

919
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,605
You're the spin doctor,
go fucking spin it.

920
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:28,190
What?

921
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:30,484
Sir, I apologize for disturbing you...

922
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:31,777
But you have a call.

923
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,614
He says he's...
Well, he's claiming to be soldier boy.

924
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:40,994
Put him through.

925
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,416
This really you?

926
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,977
The situation's changed.

927
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,562
I thought we should have a conversation.

928
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,980
I don't know who the fuck
you think you are,

929
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:54,382
but you got lucky once
because you fucking ambushed me.

930
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:55,467
Fall 1980,

931
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,386
I get called into vogelbaum's lab
for an experiment,

932
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,472
some shit about genetics.

933
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:02,933
I still remember the penthouse I used.

934
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,392
June.

935
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:07,104
Danielle deneux, bush like a pomeranian.

936
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:09,064
- What?
- I beat my meat into a cup.

937
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,608
Turns out...

938
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,277
Vogelbaum made a kid.

939
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:17,614
Born spring 1981.

940
01:00:18,824 --> 01:00:20,200
A boy.

941
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:22,869
You know what the bitch of it is?

942
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:27,207
If they'd have just kept me around,
I 'd have let you take the spotlight.

943
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:30,836
What father wouldn't want that
for his son?
