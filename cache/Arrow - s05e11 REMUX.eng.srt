1
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:03,754
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:05,506
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:08,968
I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.

4
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:11,262
Today, I fight that war on two fronts.

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,764
By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.

6
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,850
But by night, I'm someone else.

7
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,935
I am something else.

8
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:20,438
I am the Green Arrow.

9
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:22,607
Previously, on Arrow...

10
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:23,774
Follow me or die.

11
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:27,904
Hello, Mr. Queen. My name is Talia.

12
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:29,236
I've been looking for you.

13
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:30,527
As soon as I'm out of here,

14
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,926
Walker will concoct some reason
to put a bullet in my head.

15
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,803
I think I'm gonna have
to prosecute this one myself.

16
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:36,245
It could take a while.

17
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,977
I haven't kept my promise to Laurel.

18
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:39,642
You're gonna train a new Black Canary?

19
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,747
I think that somewhere out there, there is
a woman worthy of Laurel's legacy.

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,547
Now all we've gotta do
is find her.

21
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:52,678
Protests continue into the final
countdown for tonight's ignition

22
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,223
of S.T.A.R. Labs'
controversial particle accelerator.

23
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,267
S.T.A.R. Labs founder
and CEO, Harrison Wells,

24
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:02,104
promises a new era of
scientific advancement is at hand.

25
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:06,192
Would you look at that?
Future's getting brighter every day.

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,986
What do you think, babe?
You a fan of progress?

27
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,864
Why don't you just put a bullet
in my head and be done with it?

28
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,327
Or maybe you don't
have the sack to pull the trigger.

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,538
I was gonna play another hand,
let you rest some.

30
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:22,333
But lay down a challenge like that,
what's a guy gonna do?

31
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:24,961
I'm gonna get what I need from you,

32
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,171
or maybe one of those molars back there.

33
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:28,339
Forget her.

34
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:31,133
Hey, Tina. Not looking too good.

35
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:34,512
But I got something here
that might put a smile on your face.

36
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,555
Look what we got here.

37
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,852
- Oh, my God. Vinny...
- I'm sorry, Tina.

38
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,771
Aw, so sweet.

39
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,940
I thought you two
were just cop buddies, but...

40
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:51,237
You can tell me, Vin.
You're tapping that sweet ass, aren't you?

41
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:58,661
I wasn't sure which one of you to Kill.

42
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:01,956
Thanks for making up my mind for me.
Get the tarp.

43
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:03,874
No, please, please, please!
Don't hurt him.

44
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,042
Shut up.

45
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:15,177
Wait, we are now being
told to evacuate the facility.

46
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,929
The storm may have
caused a malfunction

47
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:18,389
to the primary cooling system.

48
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:19,890
Officials are down...

49
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:25,396
Sean, I am begging you.

50
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:27,273
Please.

51
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,888
- No.
- What do you mean, "No?"

52
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:00,855
- Did you even read her resume?
- Yeah, I did.

53
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,309
So, you know she flew
600 sorties over Iraq,

54
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:04,996
launched a program for inner-city kids

55
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,955
to get into flight school
as a way out of poverty,

56
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,607
plus, she's got skills in krav maga
and a third-degree black belt.

57
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:11,859
If Top Gun here is a maybe,

58
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,626
how the hell did I even get on the team?

59
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,112
Don't answer that.

60
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:18,282
Look, finding a new Black Canary
isn't just about reviewing resumes,

61
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:19,700
it's a feel thing.

62
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:23,120
Well, I feel like we're busting
our asses to find you candidates,

63
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,527
and you keep shooting 'em down.

64
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,580
I promised Laurel that
I would carry on her legacy,

65
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,935
I just don't won't Black Siren
to be all that's left of her.

66
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,003
Well, what about this woman?
Allison Slater.

67
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:33,214
Okay, she's a decorated CIA officer

68
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:35,633
who also happens to be
a world-champion in judo.

69
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,635
Nope. Okay.

70
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:40,429
What about Tara Michele?

71
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,808
Army special ops, but then
she decided to open a clinic downtown

72
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,810
to offer free healthcare to the homeless.

73
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,479
Okay, well, I will keep digging.

74
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,981
Okay, hold up, what about this one?

75
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,735
This woman got
her engineering PhD at age 20,

76
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,427
won gold in karate at the Olympics,

77
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,239
turned down offers
from the NSA and ARGUS

78
00:03:58,406 --> 00:03:59,907
to join NASA as an astronaut by day,

79
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:03,327
while at night she secretly protects
the citizens of Houston as, get this,

80
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,579
a ninja vigilante.

81
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,040
Oh, and she works
soup kitchens on Saturdays

82
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:09,834
and rescues puppies on Sundays.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,503
Astronaut-ninja? You're making that up.

84
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,671
He did.

85
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:16,006
Karate won't be an
Olympic sport until 2020.

86
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,259
Fine, you got me.

87
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:21,036
This is just some woman
who teaches preschool in the Glades,

88
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:23,305
- but my point still stands.
- That point being?

89
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:24,783
That no matter how amazing they are,

90
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,118
no one's gonna be good enough for you.

91
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:27,661
Because you keep
comparing them to Laurel,

92
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,479
which is an impossible standard
you might wanna consider loosening.

93
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:33,899
We just need to keep looking,
to think outside the box.

94
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,786
How far outside the box
are we talking here?

95
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,738
Are we talking way outside the box,
like, urban legends outside?

96
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,741
Because if we are,
I think I might have something.

97
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,468
Wait, what do you mean, "urban legend?"

98
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:46,370
I mean her.

99
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:47,872
By her, you mean who?

100
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,749
Well, actually,
I have no idea what her name is,

101
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,877
but according to the chat rooms I visited,

102
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,129
she's a kickass woman
who appears out of nowhere

103
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:57,047
- and saves crime victims.
- In Star City?

104
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,716
All over America, actually.

105
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,385
And get this, she even has a cry.

106
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:03,721
Like, a canary cry.

107
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,347
She's a meta,

108
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:07,224
with the same power as Earth-2 Laurel?

109
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,185
If that isn't bashert,
I don't know what is.

110
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:12,605
- What?
- Bashert means fate. Destiny.

111
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:14,666
According to the ARGUS database
I just hacked,

112
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,626
sightings started
three years ago in Central City.

113
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,330
That is right when S.T.A.R. Labs exploded.

114
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:20,646
And she even has a black
leather jacket and everything.

115
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:22,507
Only thing that's really
missing is the blonde hair,

116
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,991
and you can fix that with a wig.

117
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,161
I have to handle
something for John.

118
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,222
Let's see if this urban legend
is the real deal,

119
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,686
and call me when you have something.

120
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,340
- Hey.
- Hey.

121
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:41,747
Just got a text from Adrian,
do you know what it's about?

122
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,969
Maybe to figure out how
Prometheus faked Lyla's voice

123
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,739
to get me out of the bunker and into here.

124
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,073
I'm less concerned
with how you got in here

125
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,897
and more concerned
with getting you out again.

126
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,602
Gentlemen, sorry I'm late.

127
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,772
How you holding up?

128
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,358
Walker's gonna have custody
of me in a week, so...

129
00:05:57,525 --> 00:06:00,819
As soon as Walker gets his hands on John
he's gonna throw him into a hole.

130
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,029
Maybe not.

131
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:04,281
I've got a buddy
at the National Security Agency.

132
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:07,201
Turns out they have
General Walker under investigation

133
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:09,008
and were putting together quite the case.

134
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,789
Wire transfers and some
keyhole satellite images

135
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:13,791
of his movements with the nuclear trigger.

136
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,292
That's enough to exonerate John.

137
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,895
Except I don't like
the way you just said,

138
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,462
"were building a case" just now.

139
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,464
Walker has friends in high places.

140
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,466
Managed to get
the investigation slow-rolled.

141
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:23,676
But the file still exists.

142
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:26,387
I made a FOIA request,
but seeing as all this is classified,

143
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,389
that could take months, maybe even years.

144
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:31,451
- That's time we don't have.
- I'm sorry I don't have better news.

145
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:34,937
No, Adrian, you have gone
above and beyond already.

146
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,231
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

147
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:46,907
Well, Felicity is really going
to enjoy hacking the NSA.

148
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:50,411
You mean after she's brought you
a hundred Black Canary candidates

149
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:51,662
for you to say no to?

150
00:06:52,288 --> 00:06:53,998
You're not the only one
who visits, Oliver.

151
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,208
John, I understand what I promised Laurel.

152
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,962
Now that we're actively doing it,
trying to replace her?

153
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:01,797
It just...

154
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:04,466
It feels wrong.

155
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,675
She didn't want you to
find someone to replace her,

156
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,013
just someone to take on the mantle.

157
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:13,225
And from where I'm sitting,
that's two very different things.

158
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:19,982
Sleeping beauty awakes.

159
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,652
- Where am I?
- Some place safe.

160
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,195
I have to get back to the Bratva.

161
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,573
Why, so they can finish killing you?

162
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,743
That was Gregor, I have allies there.

163
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:33,537
I think you'll come to discover
circumstances within the Bratva

164
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:35,497
a bit more complex than you thought.

165
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:37,791
Why did you save me?

166
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,670
Well, from what I could tell,
you needed rescuing.

167
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,553
- Where'd you get that?
- Wasn't hard.

168
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,223
Sneaking past a bunch of oafish Bratva
is hardly a test of my skills.

169
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,017
Why did you do that?

170
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,064
Shipwrecked on Lian Yu, fled to Hong Kong,

171
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:03,901
the Omega Virus, Shadowspire,

172
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:06,320
and now, you're mixed up with the Bratva.

173
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:10,199
But along the way,
you went back home to Starling City,

174
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,369
though you couldn't bear to
reveal yourself to your family.

175
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:16,747
- How do you know this?
- I did my homework.

176
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:18,248
What makes me so interesting?

177
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,383
You wear the hood of one of my students.

178
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,594
Yao Fei Gulong?

179
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,265
You get my text about John?

180
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,601
If there is any trace
of the file that Digg needs,

181
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,746
it's gonna be buried
behind some serious firewalls.

182
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,581
Actually, firewalls don't
even begin to explain it,

183
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:44,775
it's gonna be more like
fire castles, or fire mountains.

184
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,211
How did you know where to start?

185
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,380
All that I told you was that
Chase might have something.

186
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:49,863
Yeah, and then I hacked his laptop.

187
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,134
Saving Digg is gonna break
at least 12 federal laws.

188
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,244
Hacking your DA is just small ball.

189
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:57,204
Plus, you are the mayor,
you can pardon me.

190
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:58,455
Actually, I can't.

191
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,332
It doesn't matter because I am having fun.

192
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,894
I haven't done a good old
grab-government-secrets kind of hack

193
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:03,919
in a really long time

194
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,171
and it's a great change of pace
and it feels awesome.

195
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,978
And it'll keep me busy while you're gone.

196
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:10,801
- I'm going somewhere?
- Maybe Hub City.

197
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:13,488
We're thinking that's where
the new Black Canary is hanging out.

198
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,764
Yeah, let's not call her that just yet,

199
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,659
I'd like to see her
in the field at least first.

200
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:18,934
Ask and you shall receive.

201
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:22,146
I was able to track down cell phone
footage of her latest act of heroism.

202
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,023
Heroine-ism? Heroism. Anyway, take a look.

203
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,317
The video isn't clear enough
for facial recog,

204
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,819
but she's real all right.

205
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,530
I've watched it, like, ten times.
The woman can fight.

206
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,367
She can focus the sound
better than Black Siren,

207
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,202
and she is more skilled at hand-to-hand.

208
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:42,332
This is almost like...
What was that word that you used?

209
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,209
- Bashert.
- Yeah, that.

210
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:47,963
It almost sounds like
you'd be willing to give her a look.

211
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,842
- Call Rene, we're going to Hub City.
- Mmm.

212
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,864
Stop!

213
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,952
Wow.

214
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,401
Costume Warehouse having
a fire sale I didn't know about?

215
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,665
What do you what?

216
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:26,335
You're a vigilante and a meta-human.

217
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,171
For the past three years,
you've been working alone.

218
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:30,631
We have a proposition for you.

219
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:34,259
Oh, I'm sorry, you were doing fine.
You take it, yeah.

220
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:38,889
We'd like you to join us.

221
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,934
I can give you a home,

222
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,393
and a team,

223
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:46,146
and a place to better train
the use of your power.

224
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,190
I can take care of myself.

225
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,528
Oh, and if you get in my way,

226
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:56,162
I'll send the three of you back
to Star City with your nuts in a sling.

227
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,333
I thought that went pretty good.

228
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,512
Hey, man, what are
we still doing around this dump?

229
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,224
Leather jacket lady made it seem
pretty clear about us screwing off.

230
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,434
When have you ever known me
to give up that easily?

231
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,281
Never. The answer to that is, "Never."
That might have been implied.

232
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,037
We're not gonna find a better candidate.

233
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,679
Any progress on the facial
recognition from the body cams?

234
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:33,944
Sorry, but the Wi-Fi
in here is incredibly slow.

235
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:35,445
You take your time,

236
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:38,407
I got three patties
and three slices of cheddar to go.

237
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:39,825
That's disgusting.

238
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:41,785
Okay, actually, got it.

239
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,162
Our screaming sonic lady has a name.

240
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,707
Tina Boland, formerly of the CCPD.

241
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,727
That tracks, she was in Central City
when the particle accelerator exploded.

242
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,378
And after that she went off the grid,

243
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,463
which means that we have
no way of finding her.

244
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,631
Yes, we do.

245
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,267
- Captain Singh.
- I need information.

246
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,645
- Who is this?
- It's the Green Arrow.

247
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,772
Or some nutjob with a voice modulator.

248
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,482
You want help, I'm gonna need proof.

249
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,075
Very clever.

250
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,702
Fine, what do you wanna know?

251
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:26,413
Tina Boland.
She was CCPD, what happened to her?

252
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,789
Nothing but tragedy there.

253
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,417
She went deep undercover
and her partner got killed in action.

254
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,711
Her partner's name was...

255
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,547
- Vincent Sobel.
- Yeah.

256
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,474
Tina quit the force
the day after his funeral

257
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:38,860
and we haven't heard from her since.

258
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,011
- Is she in some kind of trouble?
- Not sure yet.

259
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:43,013
You get anything, give me a call.

260
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,848
I've always had a soft spot for Boland.

261
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,267
- She's a good kid.
- Will do.

262
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,690
Looks like our Tina is trying
to avenge her former partner.

263
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,193
Which means we have a lead.

264
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,496
Trained Yao Fei?

265
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,582
How's that possible?
You're half his age.

266
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:13,502
Don't you know it's improper
to talk about a woman's age?

267
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:17,631
Let's just say it's a family secret.

268
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,884
So, you found me because of Yao Fei?

269
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,178
Congratulations.

270
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,015
Yao Fei's gone.

271
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:30,060
I found you because
the world needs people like you.

272
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,437
The man who survived all this

273
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:36,900
is destined for so much more
than playing gangster in Russia.

274
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:40,404
You know, if you knew me so well,
you'd know that I made a promise...

275
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,863
A promise, yes.

276
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,032
To get revenge on Konstantine Kovar.

277
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:45,909
I have something that will help.

278
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,455
That is Misha Yurievich,

279
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:55,544
a black-market smuggler with
a particular specialty, young girls.

280
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,964
You might guess his top customer.

281
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,591
Kovar.

282
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,552
We take down Yurievich
and that leaves Kovar

283
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,095
without his key revenue stream.

284
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,014
"We?"

285
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:09,266
You should be honored
I'm offering my services.

286
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,354
Let me help you dispose of Yurievich,

287
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:16,648
then you will hear me out
with what I have to say.

288
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:22,279
At the very least, you'll be dealing
a major blow to your enemy.

289
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,747
Oh, thank God. You are a lifesaver.

290
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:34,458
Yeah, well, I figure you gotta
get your share of fast food

291
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,586
before they lock you up
in Lompoc for hacking the NSA.

292
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,105
Lompoc doesn't house female inmates,

293
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,569
they'd probably send me to Hazelton,

294
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,216
or they would
if there was anything to hack.

295
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:44,676
Uh, you lost me.

296
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:48,597
The file containing all the dirt on
General Walker, it's gone. Scrubbed.

297
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:50,015
So, what does that mean?

298
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:54,061
Well, it means that John
is back to being totally screwed.

299
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,317
There's no sign of Boland.

300
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:02,284
You sure this is
the right spot, Mr. Terrific?

301
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:06,323
Am I still Mr. Terrific if I'm on comms
and not in uniform?

302
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:09,993
Anyway, yeah, I cross-referenced
the ATM withdrawals,

303
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,828
and pings from a burner cell phone.

304
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,997
Detective Boland is here, room 511,

305
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:15,749
should be straight down the hall.

306
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:22,672
Whoa.

307
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,342
Homegirl clearly never met a trash can.

308
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:29,971
Even though she's not on the force,
she's still playing detective.

309
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,140
No, she's not playing.
She's out for blood.

310
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,059
That's her dead partner.

311
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,062
Mr. Terrific, are you seeing
these names on the body cams?

312
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:38,688
Already running them.

313
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,193
- Drop the hammer.
- Get out!

314
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,694
No, don't go, help me, please!

315
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,029
Tina...

316
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,415
Sonic dampener, new and improved.

317
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,387
He's dead.

318
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,185
Hello, team?

319
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,992
Looks like we're gonna have some company.

320
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,613
- Can't let her go!
- Get her, I got this.

321
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,104
We didn't get to finish
our last conversation.

322
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:12,365
- You're persistent.
- You killed that man.

323
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,492
Before, I thought you were worried
I was the one who was gonna end up dead.

324
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:18,121
- Make up your mind.
- Detective Boland.

325
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,167
If you know I was police,

326
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:24,878
then you know that guy back in my place
helped kill my partner.

327
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,445
Your vendetta doesn't end with him.

328
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,674
No, I'm still looking for his boss.

329
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,445
His friends are the ones currently
shooting it out with your friends.

330
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:35,305
We can help you get him without
anyone else dying in the process,

331
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,182
including and especially, you.

332
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,683
You know, from what I hear,

333
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,953
there are plenty of nutcases
running around Star City

334
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,337
looking to make it a better place.

335
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,981
What makes me so special?

336
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:47,317
Maybe stay in the same spot
for more than a minute

337
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:48,818
and I'll get a chance to tell it.

338
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,772
Well, if you're gonna make
a sales pitch, make it good.

339
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,471
You went through something traumatic.

340
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,478
For the past three years
you've been trying to understand it

341
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:03,625
because you're afraid
of what happened to you,

342
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,336
and of what you've become.

343
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,004
So, you're running from it.

344
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,341
- How would you know?
- Because I've been there.

345
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,512
And I can help you find your way back.

346
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:22,727
Okay.

347
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,356
What's the range on that...

348
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,776
What did you call it, sonic dampener?

349
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:33,905
That's what I thought.

350
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,293
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

351
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,813
You know, I would tell you
to chew with your mouth closed,

352
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,197
but I don't even know how
you could do that with this thing.

353
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,050
Five-stack, baby. Nothing better.

354
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,344
Curtis.

355
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:00,807
Yeah, so I've made some sense
out of Tina's crazy murder-board.

356
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,560
Meet Sean Sonus.

357
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,488
Three years ago, he was a player in
Central City's criminal underworld

358
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,148
and the target of Tina's investigation.

359
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:11,735
Interestingly, Sonus disappeared
around the same time that Tina did.

360
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,879
That's why she's been
traveling across the country,

361
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:14,904
she's been following him.

362
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,907
The only thing I don't understand
is why Sonus is in Hub City now.

363
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,409
Tobias Church.

364
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,345
Your belly hurts?
Yeah, that's not surprising.

365
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,412
"Tobias Church."

366
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,265
He had all the gangs
in Hub City under his thumb,

367
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,707
just like he tried to do back home.

368
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,585
I'm thinking with Church's demise,
it left a power vacuum here,

369
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:29,912
especially in the drug trade.

370
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:31,129
What's Sonus pushing?

371
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:34,174
Some drug I've never
heard of before called "Sly-Dee?"

372
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,634
It's pronounced "slide,"
like in playground,

373
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,637
'cause it hooks kids young and
makes them move to the big stuff faster.

374
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,389
If Boland's after this scumbag,

375
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:43,676
I vote we get out of her way
and let her do her thing.

376
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:44,910
I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

377
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,770
but I actually agree with Rene.

378
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,056
- I can't believe it, either.
- And then there's this.

379
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,192
The After-Action Report
on her partner's death.

380
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,819
Sonus' men captured her
and tortured her for two weeks.

381
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,863
So even if she didn't drop
out of the police,

382
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,507
she would have been
put on indefinite leave

383
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,759
because of psychological trauma.

384
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:01,594
All the more reason
not to leave her out there alone.

385
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,138
Look, I didn't know this Laurel chick,

386
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,747
but you're taking on a lot
to keep this promise to her.

387
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:07,725
I'm thinking this is about
more than just Laurel.

388
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,626
If Sonus is connected to Church's men,

389
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,604
that makes him more dangerous
than we thought.

390
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,797
We need to find Boland
before she gets involved

391
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,465
in something that she can't handle.

392
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:22,639
What's the plan?

393
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,391
Follow my lead.

394
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,643
Hey, hey, hey.

395
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,730
We're walking into a fortress
and you're gonna use just a bow?

396
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:34,943
To use a bow and arrow
requires patience and discipline.

397
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:47,664
That's Yurievich.

398
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,999
I will take on his guards, Yurievich...

399
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,543
Yurievich is mine.

400
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,634
Please tell me you didn't sleep down here.

401
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,010
I didn't sleep.

402
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:05,181
I thought the NSA was a dead end.
The file was erased.

403
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,852
Yeah, but then I remembered nothing
on the internet is ever erased.

404
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,579
Everything leaves behind a digital shadow

405
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,649
and I've been scouring
the dark web trying to find it.

406
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,027
- What's that?
- A terminal message.

407
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,698
- From who?
- I have absolutely no idea.

408
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,450
And how'd they get into your system?

409
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,869
I have absolutely no idea.

410
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,581
- Who's "Ghost Fox Goddess?"
- It's me.

411
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:31,958
It was my hacker handle in college.

412
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,294
I made a lot of bad choices in college.

413
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,963
What do you mean, bad choices?

414
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:39,066
I used to be a hacktivist,
it's a hacker activist.

415
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,383
I left that life way behind,

416
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,361
what with the goth look
that was not good for me.

417
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:43,428
Goth?

418
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,680
Mmm-hmm. Dark hair, dark Felicity,

419
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:47,515
taking on corporations and governments.

420
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,524
It was a power trip though,
it wasn't healthy.

421
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,062
What's "IRL?"

422
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,065
In real life.

423
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,072
Yo, you know what you're doing there?

424
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,240
Are you kidding me?

425
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:07,243
I hacked all the traffic cams
in my hometown on a dare.

426
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:10,413
So, this is gonna help us
find Ms. Loco Bananas?

427
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:13,041
Or Sonus. Either way...

428
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,793
Either way, we're gonna
put ourselves in the middle

429
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:19,005
of a showdown between a nutbar
and a psycho drug dealer.

430
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:21,384
When Oliver explained
his thinking to us on this,

431
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,093
which he rarely ever does, by the way,

432
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:26,095
I thought you would be more on board.

433
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,765
How'd the last crazy recruit turn out?

434
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:32,185
Okay, Evelyn did have her issues,
true, but so did Rory.

435
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,938
And Oliver channeled his vendetta
into something positive.

436
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,941
And as far as nutcases are concerned...

437
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,361
As far as nutcases are concerned, what?

438
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:42,946
Nothing. I...

439
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:44,822
That was a... It was a period.

440
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,218
"As far as nutcases are concerned."
Period.

441
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:48,552
That was just, it wasn't... That's it.

442
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,286
You were thinking of me, weren't you?

443
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,288
I meant it in the nicest way.

444
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:54,958
I guess you're right.

445
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,501
- I am?
- Yeah.

446
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,964
Maybe this team is all about
finding second chances.

447
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,012
Could you hand me that adapter and tablet?

448
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,222
Yep.

449
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:11,975
Thanks.

450
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,149
- Got a location.
- Nutbar or psycho drug dealer?

451
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,987
- Psycho drug dealer.
- Great.

452
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:32,870
Check it out.

453
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,173
Hey, Sean. Been a while.

454
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:45,842
Detective Boland.

455
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,600
A little outside
your jurisdiction, aren't you?

456
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:51,014
I'm not a cop tonight.

457
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,109
Get away from her.

458
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:12,744
Son of a bitch!

459
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:23,921
What the hell was that?

460
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,007
Sonus...

461
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,760
He's a meta-human, too.

462
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:39,729
- How is she?
- Still unconscious.

463
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:42,458
I don't know about you, man,
but my head is still spinning a bit.

464
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,566
It's his meta-power.

465
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:45,234
I think he can control sonic waves.

466
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:48,404
It would explain how he disoriented
you guys and counteracted Tina and...

467
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,033
Their powers are related.

468
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,160
- What do you mean?
- I think I have an idea.

469
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,289
I didn't sign up for metas, man.

470
00:24:58,456 --> 00:24:59,707
Enhanced ability or not,

471
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:02,919
Sonus is running a drug trade
that sells to kids.

472
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,898
If that means we're moving on
from trying to recruit this crazy lady

473
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:08,591
and focus on taking
down this prig, I'm all in.

474
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:10,510
Yeah, but we have to find Sonus first.

475
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:11,761
I know where he's gonna be.

476
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:14,847
What time is it?

477
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:18,267
11:40. Where are you going?

478
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,062
Sonus is taking in
a major shipment of Slyde.

479
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:22,230
And you know where.

480
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:24,318
And something tells me
you're not gonna tell us.

481
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,072
After three years,
the man who killed my partner

482
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,592
is finally in my sights,
I'm not letting anyone get in my way.

483
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:33,157
Lady wants to commit suicide,
we should let her.

484
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:34,409
Free country.

485
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,081
He nearly killed you last time.

486
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,627
Against him, your ability is a liability.

487
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:47,714
Let us help.

488
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:53,970
Hey, thanks for the save.
Safe trip back to Star City, boys.

489
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:02,288
Yurievich is dead.

490
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,582
Good. Now we can talk.

491
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,088
Look sharp.

492
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:14,884
If this goes south on me,
I want you to take this guy down, hard.

493
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,093
Paranoid much?

494
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,888
You don't know
the dark web like I do, okay?

495
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:21,808
These guys aren't exactly
known to be friendly.

496
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:24,060
OMG! OMG.

497
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:27,188
The Ghost Fox Goddess, here in meatspace.

498
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:28,981
The real Ghost Fox Goddess!

499
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:32,610
- You're Kojo Sledgehammer?
- Yeah.

500
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:35,321
I know it's not nearly as cool
as "Ghost Fox Goddess,"

501
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:37,907
but then, I can only aspire
to your level of cool.

502
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:40,576
Which I do. Aspire to, I mean.

503
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:42,495
Take her down hard, you said, right?

504
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:46,582
Hey...

505
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:48,793
It is so great to meet you.

506
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,920
When I saw your traffic on the darknets,

507
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:52,713
I wasn't even sure it was you.

508
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,551
I mean, you've been a blank
for, well, years.

509
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:58,803
- I've been busy.
- I know, Palmer Tech.

510
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,013
I just figured
once you got fired, you'd...

511
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:05,017
- Figured I'd what?
- It's none of my business.

512
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:07,937
Okay, well,

513
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:12,316
I became a hacker, a hacktivist,

514
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,777
because of you.

515
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,612
The GFG.

516
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:20,116
I read about your hack of the
Department of Education, and I was, like,

517
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:22,368
"I know what I wanna be."

518
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:25,496
But then you just totally stopped
and became this, like,

519
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:27,915
information technology
support player and...

520
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,504
Sorry. Never meet your heroes, you know?

521
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:36,883
No, I haven't just been corporate,
you know, I've been doing work that is...

522
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:39,218
Important.

523
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,053
If it was, I would've heard about it.

524
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,223
Oh, sorry, there I go again.

525
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,811
I guess I was just excited
when I saw you on the darknets.

526
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:52,523
It was like...
Like you were returning, you know?

527
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,692
The O.G. GFG was back.

528
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:59,572
Well, I was looking for an NSA file
to exonerate an innocent man.

529
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:01,157
- John Diggle.
- Yes.

530
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,452
- My organization does its homework.
- Organization?

531
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,038
A hacktivist group,
we call ourselves Helix.

532
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:08,862
A month ago, we hacked ECHELON.

533
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,667
- The NSA's information gathering program?
- Mmm-hmm.

534
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:14,003
We hoovered up eight petabytes of data.

535
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,547
Including everything you need
to help your friend.

536
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,884
We're calling the data cache "Pandora."

537
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:22,803
With it, you can take down politicians,

538
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,932
bankrupt companies, spark revolutions.

539
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,893
So, you're not just
giving me the file for John?

540
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,813
You inspired me
to make the world a better place.

541
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,192
And now I intend to inspire you

542
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,904
to be the hacktivist you used to be,

543
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,824
the great Ghost Fox Goddess.

544
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:05,346
Let me guess.

545
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:08,683
You're trusting me with your mask off
so now I'm supposed to trust you?

546
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:12,019
No, I just thought that if you weren't
gonna listen to the Green Arrow,

547
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,813
that you might listen to Oliver Queen.

548
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:15,690
Nice to meet you.

549
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:18,734
I spent five years in hell.

550
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,088
Not unlike what happened to you

551
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:23,239
when you were undercover
in Sonus' organization.

552
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:27,307
Or what he put you through when
he discovered you were a cop.

553
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:31,247
And, what, you think you see
a little bit of yourself in me?

554
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:32,748
It's more than that.

555
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,918
There is a man in Star City

556
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:37,920
who's trying to convince me

557
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:40,089
that I destroy the lives
of everyone that I touch

558
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:41,882
because I am beyond redemption.

559
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,152
Yeah, and you think if you can save me
you'll prove him wrong?

560
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,679
- Don't put your issues on me.
- Absolutely right.

561
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:51,559
But if you think that you can take on
Sonus and his men then you are wrong.

562
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:54,937
Let us help.

563
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:59,817
Let us help, and then we're gone.

564
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:16,959
All right.

565
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:20,087
I'm reading fifteen shooters
on the roof and a helicopter inbound.

566
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,217
Copy, we're in position.

567
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:28,637
Shipment's late.

568
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:30,431
Some screw-up in Bludhaven.

569
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:31,766
Take a hundred grand off.

570
00:31:33,017 --> 00:31:34,852
- We need to move.
- Patience.

571
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:37,398
You still have Curtis'
insurance policy with you?

572
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:41,150
Yeah, but I'm still gonna
get to use my guns, right?

573
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:44,528
Chopper's about to land, guys.

574
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,322
Move.

575
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:54,997
Kill 'em all!

576
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:13,516
Not so fast, dirtbag.

577
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,143
Yes! Yes.

578
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:24,068
They got air support.

579
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,837
All right, I'll take care of it.
But, Wild Dog...

580
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:26,904
I got her six.

581
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,246
Guess I should be flattered.

582
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,292
To think you've held out a candle
for me after all these years.

583
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:26,630
- What are you waiting for?
- Tina...

584
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,969
Don't do it. You're better than this.

585
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,346
You know I'm not.

586
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,601
If we're as alike as you said,
we both know you'd kill him.

587
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:39,935
You're right.

588
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,105
Maybe it's too late for me,

589
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,901
and maybe I don't get a second chance.

590
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:51,572
You don't have to go down that road.

591
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,453
Do you know what
would Vince want you to do?

592
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:09,590
He'd want me to do that.

593
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:17,306
Hey.

594
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:21,810
Let her go.

595
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:35,991
Hey. Oh, man.

596
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,203
I was gonna ask how
it went with the new Canary,

597
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:42,081
but I can tell by that look on your face.

598
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:46,627
- Well, I have some good news, though.
- I am in the market.

599
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:50,923
I've got all we need to exonerate John.

600
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:53,821
That's incredible. How'd you do that?

601
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:57,346
Long story.

602
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:01,141
Is there something you're not telling me?

603
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:03,602
I know that we are
not used to getting good news,

604
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:06,730
but this is what it looks like.

605
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:11,277
I am gonna go leak the file on Walker.

606
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:14,043
Why don't you go tell John the good news?

607
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:49,064
- What's going on?
- You tell him.

608
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,567
Tell me what?

609
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:54,903
Earlier this evening, I received
the NSA's case against Walker

610
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,323
- from an anonymous source.
- Anonymous?

611
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,533
On the strength of it,
I went to the Judge Advocate

612
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,577
ex parte, and got you released on bail.

613
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,495
Wait, what?

614
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:04,913
I filed a motion to dismiss

615
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,017
which is as close to
a slam dunk as these things get,

616
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,250
given the cards we're holding.

617
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:09,460
What does this mean?

618
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,422
It means that you can go home,
and hug your wife and son.

619
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:28,896
You wanted this, baited me with Yurievich.

620
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:31,440
Yes.

621
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:35,027
To see for yourself what I've become?

622
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:36,528
To remind you.

623
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:39,031
Why go to all the trouble?

624
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:42,951
Huh? What do you care?
You don't even know me.

625
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,536
I thought I'd proven otherwise.

626
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:51,001
General Shrieve, Baron Reiter,
Konstantine Kovar.

627
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:53,087
You keep looking for new fights

628
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,839
when the real fight has been
in front of you all along.

629
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,134
Your father literally wrote it for you,

630
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:03,097
a list of all the Yurievichs
and Kovars in Starling City.

631
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,973
He told me. He left me a message.

632
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,767
And yet you still don't return home.

633
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:09,269
Why do you deny
your father's wish for you?

634
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,105
You saw the reason tonight.

635
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,190
I am not the man that my father raised.

636
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:16,402
Not anymore.

637
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,863
You're afraid of what's happened to you,

638
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,491
of what you've become,
and you're running from it.

639
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:31,625
- How do you know all this?
- Because I've been there.

640
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:35,170
And I can help you find your way back.

641
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:38,966
You think yourself a monster.

642
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:42,094
No.

643
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,140
I am a monster.

644
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:57,192
There is a monster inside you,
yes, but it is not you.

645
00:37:58,652 --> 00:37:59,732
I don't see the difference.

646
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:02,573
No, you need to create one.

647
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,996
You need to give the monster an identity.

648
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:12,458
It's only when the monster
becomes someone else,

649
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:18,630
something else,
that you're free to be Oliver Queen.

650
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,063
I don't know if I'm ready.

651
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,233
I will help you become ready.

652
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:53,916
Mr. Mayor, excuse me,

653
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:56,960
but there's someone here to see you.
Her name is Tina Boland.

654
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,129
Yeah, send her in, please.

655
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,931
Mayor Queen. It's impressive.

656
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:12,601
Maybe you should've led with that.

657
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:18,065
I gotta admit,
I didn't think I'd see you again.

658
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:20,150
Yeah, neither did I.

659
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:27,324
I guess I thought
I would feel different...

660
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,953
with Sonus gone.

661
00:39:31,161 --> 00:39:32,788
I thought I would feel...

662
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:36,833
- Liberated.
- I wish it worked that way.

663
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,134
How do you do it?

664
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,389
How do you keep living with so much pain?

665
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,100
I'm still working on that myself.

666
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,521
But I can tell you
it helps to not be alone.

667
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:00,899
That's why you're here, right?

668
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,113
That's why I'm here.

669
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:12,035
Back on the roof, you asked
what Vince would have wanted.

670
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,290
We were more than just partners,

671
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,127
we were lovers.

672
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,298
I hated Sonus for killing Vince.

673
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:31,138
But I hated myself more
for not being able to stop him.

674
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:34,266
Rene, the guy in the hockey mask,

675
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,353
told the other guy
that was with us, Curtis,

676
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:43,525
that this team is all about
finding second chances.

677
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:47,154
You said maybe
we don't get second chances.

678
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,614
Well, maybe I was wrong.

679
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:52,868
Maybe you're my second chance.

680
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:57,789
That's a lot to put on my shoulders.

681
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,396
Well, Tina, there's something
that tells me you can handle it.

682
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:06,381
So about that name...

683
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:10,510
"Tina Boland" was my official cover
for undercover work.

684
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,554
It was to protect my family.

685
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,224
My real name is Dinah.

686
00:41:16,725 --> 00:41:18,060
Dinah Drake.

687
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:23,440
Dinah?

688
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:25,671
Does that name mean something to you?

689
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:27,277
I had a friend named Dinah.

690
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,615
She's the reason I sought you out.

691
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,328
What do you think
she'd think about all this?

692
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:40,415
I think she'd be proud of both of us.

693
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:21,623
English - SDH
