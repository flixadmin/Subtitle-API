Good morning.

00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,860
Good morning, Mom.

00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,210
- Your cat bit me again.
- You stole my pencils.

00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,840
- Why are you fighting?
- Because he stole my pencils!

00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,380
- She's making it up.
- Stop fighting.

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,220
- Let's see.
- Let's go, sweetie. What time is it?

00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,100
- 6:40 a.m.
- God, I'm late again.

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,960
Remember to ask your brother
what we talked about.

10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,190
- Tell him school starts next week.
- Yes. I'll ask him, all right?

11
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,150
I still have to buy the books, everything.

12
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,570
I told you I'll ask him, my love,
all right?

13
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:58,410
And you still haven't tied your shoes.
So, like I taught you, right?

14
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,910
We have the rabbit ear,
we go around the tree, and...?

15
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,330
And it goes in the hole.

[Steve] You threaten a man's family,
and you find out what he's made of.

19
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,750
Pablo Escobar was made of rage,
revenge and terror.

20
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,520
Unable to lash out directly
at his enemies in Cali,

21
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,400
he went after their prized
legitimate business,

22
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,840
one they couldn't hide:
their beloved chain of drugstores.

23
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,450
And he blew them to shit along with anyone
unlucky enough to be standing nearby.

24
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,060
We're talking dozens of bombs.

25
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,500
He put the city of Bogotá on edge
and the Colombian government on notice.

26
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,670
Continue to ignore Los Pepes, refuse to
acknowledge their crimes, and you're next.

But terror brings more terror,

29
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,680
and Los Pepes responded
with their own special brand.

30
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,970
We came up with a name for their displays.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,850

- [Steve] Colombian folk art.

Look at that ugly son of a bitch.

38

We'll take it one step further.

39
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,790
The gates of hell were officially opened.

One... two... and three.

41
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,590
And everyone was scrambling

- [Tata] Me? Me, ma'am? Me?

46
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,940
[Hermilda] We shouldn't leave, Tata.
[Tata] All of this is your fault.

47
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,840
If you'd listened to Pablo,
my brother would still be alive.

48
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,780
[Hermilda] Because you do that so well?
Do you listen to him?

49
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,770
When you're always criticizing him,
doubting him, worrying.

We didn't want to make you
uncomfortable, Judy.

65
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:28,090
How considerate of you.
So that's why no one called me?

66
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,350
Because this lab belongs to the Moncadas.
Mmm?

67
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,790
So I was supposed to be notified
when it was taken back.

- That wasn't made clear to us.
- I'm making it clear now, Carlos.

00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,920
- What are we going to do with that?
- All the cocaine is going to Cali.

00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,110
That is my cocaine.

71
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,760
Look, Judy, we decided that not a single
kilo of cocaine will be moved in Medellín

72
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,640
until Pablo Escobar is dead.

73
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,100
That's our strategy. To asphyxiate him.

74
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,060
That's the Cali cartel's strategy?

75
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,690
To keep making money
while the rest of us go hungry?

- No. Not them or any of you.

We don't trust any drug trafficker.

The killing of innocent civilians,
for starters.

Including that gonorrhea of a lawyer,
Fernando Duque.

I need you to help me find him.

He's Pablo's mouthpiece

What we want is to exterminate this rat.

00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,340
Marrying me, or what?

158
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,680
Not for a second.

159
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,940
[softly]
They may separate us...

160
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,490
but they'll never be able to destroy us.

161
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,880
Go.

162
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,950
[whispers]
The little bunny. The little bunny.

163
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,140
I'll take care of him, all right?

164
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,440
Give me a kiss.

[sighs]

167
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,040
[Steve] Pablo was right. The government
couldn't stop his family from leaving.

168
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,920
But if you remember, he had
some bad history with Avianca Airlines.

169
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,150
And they made sure as shit
that everybody knew

170
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,630
the Escobars were trying to fly the coop.

171
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,820
[in English] What we know is that Escobar
bought tickets for his family

172
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,330
on eight different outgoing flights
from Bogotá.

173
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:06,000
Destinations ranging
from Barcelona to Toronto.

174
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,580
Mr. President,
we need to prevent that from happening.

175
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,290
We need to keep the family in play.
If they're allowed to leave Colombia,

176
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,300
we're gonna lose leverage
in the hunt for Escobar.

177
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,800
Legally, there's no way we can stop them
from flying out of the country.

178
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,300
By applying pressure behind the scenes,

179
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,510
we can prevent the family
from being accepted upon arrival.

180
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,140
And if they're kept in Colombia,
he's gonna be worried about their safety.

181
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:32,360
He'll be more likely to make phone
contact, more likely to... make mistakes.

182
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,680
Because they're more likely
to become victims of Los Pepes.

183
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:46,750
Mr. President... if the family gets safe
haven, there's no telling what comes next.

184
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,900
Maybe Escobar surrenders,
maybe he goes to war.

185
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,780
The family is leverage. We have to use it.

186
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,790
I agree.

187
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,980
I want one of your people with them
giving us updates, running interference,

188
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,050
and have them find out
where they're going. And stick with them.

- Hey, it's Messina.

192
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,670
I need you to grab your passport
and head to Bogotá International.

193
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,590
Where?

194
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,010
The Escobars are trying to flee the
country. Wherever they go, follow them.

195
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:44,390
- Yeah. When?
- Now. Once you spot them, check in.

196
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,330
- And Murphy, keep this under wraps.
- Yes, ma'am.

197
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,890
Who was that?

198
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,210
Messina.

199
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,340
- Where you going?
- Going out.

200
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,530
- With your passport?
- Yep.

201

- Yep.

- For... which flight, sir?

204
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,650
Let's see. Madrid, London...

205
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,520
It's Murphy. Get me Messina.

206
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,150
- Messina.
- Hey, it's me. It's the Frankfurt flight.

207
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,880
Germany. Shit.

208
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,990
Yes, Mr. Foreign Minister, but I'm not
talking about some Turkish date farmer

209
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,720
looking to drive a taxi in Berlin.
I'm talking about Pablo Escobar's family.

210

[sighs]

211
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,710
No. No, they haven't committed any crimes.

212
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,000
[Steve]
Due to events in their fairly recent past,

213
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,650
Germany had some of the softest
immigration standards in Europe.

214
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:05,130
If you had a pulse,
they tended to let you in.

215
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,100
Now maybe that was good for mankind,

216
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,350
and it was certainly good
for the Escobars.

217
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,480
It was very bad for us.

The colonel's son.

222
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,940
He said you have some
technical background.

223
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,530
I took a couple
of engineering classes, sir.

224
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,200
And I built a ham in my parents' house.

225
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,330
Great. What do you know about RDF?

226
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,290
The basic concept, sir.

227
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,130
The basic concept.

228
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,090
All right.

229
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:10,030
Get acquainted.
We go out tomorrow afternoon.

And don't worry.

Unlike Carlos Castaño,
this won't hit back.

Why are you not working?

I'm not paying you with candy.

No. Stay put. We're not done yet.

- Mmm.

- Kidnapping and car theft.

He's got his kid with him.

Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. I...

I might have an idea where he's holed up.

If he comes through for us, you think
we can get him out of the country?

312
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:11,270
Do you want to call your mom,
or do you want to behave like a man?

313
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:15,110
Are you going to be a pussy
and call your mom? That's a great idea.

314
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:18,690
Let's call her so she can tell you where
all the money for your toys came from.

315
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,430
Your room full of toys.
Where do you think it came from?

316
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,700
Hmm? You didn't complain
during the Christmases or the birthdays

317
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,040
or when I bought you a motorcycle.

318
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:32,650
But now you're complaining.
Very well. Very well. It's over.

319
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:37,490
It's over! Now that they're
going to kill me, it's over.

320
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,760
[Simon sniffles softly]

321
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:51,250
I'm sorry... Simon.

322
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,310
[whispers]
I didn't mean to say that.

323
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,550
Forgive me.

324
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,800
Everything will be all right.
Forgive me.

325
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:13,480
[air hissing]

326
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,210
Was it a heart attack or what?

327
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,690
[Ricardo]
You fainted, Pablo.

328
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,740
How many of those are you taking?

329
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,600
I've had a terrible headache.

330
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,480
- Those aren't any good, Pablo.
- [removes blood pressure cuff]

331
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,040
You shouldn't put so much shit
in your body.

332
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:44,650
You're better off... taking these drops.
They're homeopathic.

333
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,970
Three drops under your tongue
in the morning and two at night.

334
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,690
Have you ever been to Disney World?

335
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,240
I haven't.

336
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,160
It's beautiful.

337
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:11,200
It's very organized. Very clean.

338
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,330
What's wrong with me, Ricardo?

339
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,310
Stress.

340
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,940
[Pablo] Mmm.

341
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,510
Stress is dangerous.

342
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,090
How's the weed working out?

343
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,060
I haven't been smoking a lot.

344
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,710
The first man who smoked marijuana
was a Chinese emperor.

345
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,920
He burned the plant because
he was attracted to its smell.

346
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,530
But when he inhaled the smoke,
he saw a blue jay.

347
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:51,470
And the bird told him
to conquer his neighboring empires.

348
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,080
And that's what he did.

349
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,540
All right.

350
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,840
With you until death, Don Pablo.

351
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,300
Thank you.

352
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:10,600
I'd like to stay and stand guard.

353
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,980
All right. Thank you.

354
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,870
Let's see, darling.
Color inside the lines.

355
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,880
There it is.

356
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,650
[woman speaks in German over PA]

357
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,460
[woman in English]
Attention, ladies and gentlemen:

358
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,820
We will be passing around
immigration cards.

359
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,350
[low chatter]

360
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,630
[quietly in Spanish]
This is our stop.

361
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,610
Foreign ministry isn't cooperating.
We need more time.

362
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,680
Don't let them leave the airport.

363
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,720
- They do, it's over.
- Right, right, right. Talk to you soon.

364
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,960
Sir, I'm with the United States DEA.

365
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,630
There's passengers on this flight
who can't be allowed into this country.

366
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,800
Heard of Pablo Escobar? Cocaine? That's
his family. You can't allow them in.

367
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,720
Unless there is a problem with
their passports or any type of contraband,

368
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:00,930
they may enter Germany.

369
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,690
[murmuring indistinctly in Spanish]

370
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:07,520
What about if they're transporting
a large amount of foreign currency?

371
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:11,030
- [man] You would be certain of this how?
- I saw it. I saw it with my own eyes.

372
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,110
I work with the DEA, been with
this family, I've been tracking Escobar

373
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,120
for a long goddamn fucking time.
It is in that bag.

374
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,530
- [man] In which item of luggage?
- [Steve] The maroon bag.

375
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,620
- [man speaks in German]
- Perdón?

376
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,160
- [man in English] Do you speak English?
- No.

377
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,230
I'm a hundred percent certain.
That burgundy bag.

378
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,150
Fucking hell.

379
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,960
[speaks German]

380
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,760
- Hello. Pablo Escobar? Familia Escobar?
- Sí.

381
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,800
[speaks in German]

382
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,560
- [in English] You speak English? German?
- No.

383
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,890
[speaking German]

384
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,520
- [in Spanish] What's going on?
- What's happening?

385
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,890
[man in English]
Come with us.

386
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,270
- [in Spanish] What's going on?
- [Tata] Can you give me back my passport?

387
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:51,470
[Steve] To be honest, I'd never actually
seen any cash in the bag.

388
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,450
[in Spanish]
That money is ours.

389
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:58,410
[Steve] But I knew Pablo
would never let his wife go anywhere

390
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,910
without some serious walking around money.

391
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:04,580
- [Tata] Pablo, they're not letting us in.
- No, no! They can't do that.

392
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,330
- That's what they're doing.
- They can't...

393
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,590
Listen, Tata, that's illegal.
That's illegal. Don't worry.

394
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,920
Don't worry, because...

395
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,010
Do what you need to do to get us
into Germany. I have to hang up.

396
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,760
- [man speaks German]
- [in Spanish] Don't touch me!

397
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,110
- [in English] Please come now.
- [Tata in Spanish] Let go!

398
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,120
[grunts, hangs up]

399
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,730
[car alarm blaring]

400
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:06,750
[grunts, exhales]

401
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,170
- [door opens]
- No, no, no! No!

402
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,050
- Shh.
- [sharp breaths]

403
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,840
Fernando Duque.

404
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,390
Javier Peña.

405
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,330
[in Spanish]
It took me one day to find you.

406
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:28,100
If you don't want them to kill you,
you need to start doing things better.

407
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,820
[softly]
Please... get me out of here.

408
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,820
Please get me out of Colombia. Do you know
who I work for? Who I worked for?

409
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,580
Well, our help isn't free.

410
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:46,330
We need full cooperation.

411
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,870
[Simon] Dad!

412
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,310
Hey, Simon, it's all right.

413
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,170
It's all right. Uh, go back inside.
I'll come up soon.

414
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:03,930
It's my son. He's... He's scared.

415
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,910
First, we'll get you to Holguín.
You'll be safe...

416
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,660
No, no, no! No. No, no.
No, we're staying here.

417
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:15,860
There are cops working
for Los Pepes everywhere.

418
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,450
It would be better if you get us
to the United States at once.

419
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,390
I'll cooperate with you.
[stammers] Anything you want.

420
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:29,040
I'll cooperate with you.
Please get us out of Colombia.

421
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,420
Is that a deal?

422
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,750
[silent]

423
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,670
Do as I say.

424
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:43,220
Start by hiding your fucking wife's car.

425
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,460
[Steve] While the authorities were using
all the political pressure they could

426
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,920
to keep Escobar's family in play,

427
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,800
Pablo was practicing
his own special form of diplomacy.

428
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,880
[dialing phone]

429
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,420
- [ringing]
- First, he called the German embassy

430
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,580
in Bogotá.

431
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,350
[in Spanish]
Hello, German embassy.

432
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:13,850
First of all, I'll kill every last German
son of a bitch that lives in Colombia.

433
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,060
Then I will bomb Frankfurt, Munich...

434
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:21,150
[Steve] Then he threatened to bomb
a couple of Lufthansa planes.

435
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:26,070
[Pablo] I'm going to shove bombs
up your asses, you bastard motherfuckers.

436
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,950
Nazi, racist gonorrheas.
I'm going to kill all of you. You hear?

437
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,910
I'm going to kill all of you!

438
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,830
[dialing]

439
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:36,500
[Steve]
Then he dialed up President Gaviria.

440
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,540
Who couldn't take the call.

441
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:41,990
Because he was already on the phone
with the German ambassador.

442
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:50,830
And then, Pablo did something
he'd never done before in his life.

443
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,730
He called a cop and he asked for help.

444
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:58,860
Not just any cop,
but the top cop in the country:

445
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,980
Attorney General De Greiff.

446
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:07,050
I once heard you say that I had the same
rights as any other Colombian citizen.

447
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,770
I imagine that also applies to my family,
correct?

448
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,290
The government hasn't done anything
to stop Los Pepes,

449
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:21,040
those terrorists who have attacked
my family and murdered my associates.

450
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:26,340
Is that how the Colombian government
ensures the rights of all its citizens?

451
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:30,930
The president is trying to prevent
my family from entering Germany

452
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,560
and yet you do nothing about it.

453
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:38,020
That man wants to dangle my family before
Los Pepes and use my children as bait,

454
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,760
and you, who call yourself a man
of principle, do nothing about it.

455
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
[hangs up]

456
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,850
[chatter in Spanish]

457
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,650
- [static]
- There's a lot of interference.

458
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:05,420
Yes. Medellín has too many electrical
wires, phone wires, antennae.

459
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,450
- That must be why.
- What's your success rate?

460
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,930
[sighs] To be honest,
we haven't located a signal yet.

461
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,700
Not one?

462
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,790
Not one.

463
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,380
[sighs]

464
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,070
Here's what we're going to do, Morales.

465
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:30,760
Let's both start here: L9.329.

466
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,520
There it is.

467
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:47,570
I was talking to my police contact and
you won't guess who's hiding the lawyer.

468
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,580
None other than that son of a bitch, Peña.
What do you think about that?

469
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,890
Who's your contact?

470
00:38:55,910 --> 00:39:00,670
Who he is isn't important.
The important thing is that I trust him.

471
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,940
And you know what
the worst part of this is?

472
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,050
We can no longer trust Peña.

473
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,010
Then we'll have to put a bullet in him.

474
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,260
No.

475
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,080
We can't kill DEA agents.

476
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,060
Oh, no? Why not?

477
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,730
If it were up to me,
I'd feed him to the crocodiles.

478
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,690
[Fidel]
Berna, look...

479
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:39,540
Schedule a meeting with Peña,
just as you have been.

480
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,380
We'll take care of the rest.

481
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:52,800

[engine revving]

484
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,540
[in English]
Agent Peña.

485
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,610
[soft Latin music plays on radio]

486
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,950
I don't think Don Berna's
gonna make it tonight.

487
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,060
What is this?

488
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,710
Just a friendly chat.

489
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,180
You're making some very scary people
pretty nervous, Javier.

490
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,450
Which puts me in a spot because...

491
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:21,430
I'm the one who suggested
they approach you in the first place.

492
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:27,370
Now, I don't know what you know
about what it is I do,

493
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,380
but understand this:

494
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,920
I have our nation's
long-term interests in mind.

495
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,010
That's the beat I walk.

496
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:38,510
And sitting here tonight,
that means making sure the right folks

497
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,870
are left standing when Escobar
gets his bullet.

498
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,630
So do Uncle Sam a solid.

499
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,380
Don't complicate that.

500
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,020
These folks are prone
to emotional decision-making.

501
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:09,150
Which can lead to bush league nonsense
like... killing a federal agent.

502
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,820
By the way, they found the lawyer.

503
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,450
Even without your help, so...

we'll have a goalie in place.

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,810

You follow me to the fucking hotel?

509
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:52,880
Huh?

510
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,380
[whispers in Spanish] Did you follow me
to the hotel? You told Berna?

511
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,940
Let go.

512
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,760
Tell me, asshole.

513
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,410
- Let go! It's all right.
- [man] What's the problem?

514
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:07,140
[Trujillo]
I'll catch up. Everything's fine.

515
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,230
What's going on, Peña?

516
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,310
Playing the fucking American?

517
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,190
[softly]
Did you see what they did to his son?

518
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,910
How many families has Pablo Escobar
destroyed, Peña? Do you know?

519
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:29,140
You don't decide who lives and who dies.

520
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:33,290
Don't be fucking stupid.
This is how we do it.

521
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,970
[De Greiff] I understand that you're
trying to prevent Escobar's family

522
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,180
from entering Germany.

523
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,010
Let's make something clear:

524
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,680
If you've come to plead for them
as part of some deal, the only...

525
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,460
No, Mr. President.

526
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:23,340
I haven't come to plead for them.
I've come to plead for you.

527
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:27,700
For me? How so?

528
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,950
I know that you want Escobar dead.

529
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:36,350
And while I don't agree with that,
I understand it.

530
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,610
But this... this I can't understand.

531
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,760
This isn't just wrong.

532
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:52,580
It puts you, the president of Colombia,
in league with a death squad.

533
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,210
Call the German chancellor.
Tell him to let the family in.

534
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,190
[speaking in German]

535
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,530
[man in Spanish] I'm sorry to inform you,
your entry into Germany has been denied.

536
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,510
I know my rights, sir.
But you don't understand.

537
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:31,840
My children are in danger.
Send me any place other than Colombia.

[speaking in German]

539

[in Spanish] Tell him the children are
under age. We just want to live in peace.

We just want to live in...

541
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:46,360
No, no, no.
Tell him that's all we want to do.

542
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,550
To live in peace.

543
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:53,070
Get the children and your belongings.

Please.

- [Hermilda in Spanish] I know. I'm going.

Why are we being treated this way?

You can't treat us like criminals.

you can get your hands on
