1
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,770
My sun and stars.

2
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,010
Do you remember
our first ride, my sun and stars?

3
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:45,730
If you are in there, if you haven't gone away,
show me.

4
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,160
You're a fighter.
You've always been a fighter.

5
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,620
I need you to fight now.

6
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,670
I know you're very far away,

7
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,590
but come back to me, my sun and stars.

8
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:38,940
Is this your command, Khaleesi?
