1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,691
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,127
After five years in hell...

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,328
...I have come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,766
To save my city.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,528
Now others have joined my crusade.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,081
To them, I'm Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,124
To the rest of Starling City,
lam someone else...

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,682
...I am something else.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,205
Previously on Arrow:

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,091
My name is Amanda Waller, Mr. Queen.
Welcome to Hong Kong.

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,964
Amanda Waller wants you working for her.
She will have her way.

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,806
I know a guy who'd be interested
in hiring someone with your expertise.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,201
- There's another bidder for the company.
- Who?

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,646
Ray Palmer.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,041
What are you doing here?

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,043
No. No. Sara!

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,725
Sara!

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,565
No. No.

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,170
No.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,970
Felicity, all I'm trying to do
is make things easier on you.

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,489
By having me completely reconfigure
our phone system?

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,682
Do you even know how difficult it is to ping
a clone off a hacked transband multiplex?

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,322
No, but only because
you weren't speaking English just now.

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,929
Sara.

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,841
I didn't know where else to take her.

26
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,289
Oh, my God.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,526
- What happened?
- I couldn't...

28
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,486
I couldn't leave her.

29
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,086
We have to call...
We could take her to the hospital.

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,086
Ollie, it's not fair.

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,009
We just got her back. It's not fair.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,161
No.

33
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,840
No.

34
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,841
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,485
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,722
I'm so sorry.

37
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,171
We'll take our position here.

38
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,049
Who's your target?

39
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,726
I don't have a target.

40
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,607
- You do.
- What?

41
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,207
It might have escaped your notice,
but Waller doesn't have a sense of humor.

42
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,880
Oh, really?
Then why did she drag me off of Lian Yu...

43
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,281
...and bring me to Hong Kong
to become her hit man?

44
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,251
To become her operative.

45
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,883
She needs you or she wouldn't be threatening
my family to assure your compliance.

46
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,691
The target will be entering our line
any moment.

47
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,010
The target will walk 10 paces through the
roof garden, then arrive at his hotel suite.

48
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,970
- That's your window.
- I see it.

49
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,131
Now.

50
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,165
Tommy?

51
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,727
You know,
Sara used to have a stuffed animal.

52
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,250
It was this old worn-out shark
that she got from the Starling Aquarium.

53
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,644
Every time something awful would happen
to her, I would always find her...

54
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,282
...holding that stupid little shark
close to her chest.

55
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,371
And now that my sister's dead...

56
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,731
...again, the only thing
that I can think about...

57
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,125
...is finding that dumb stuffed animal
and putting it in her arms.

58
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,408
- I'm sorry.
- You have nothing to apologize for.

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,288
Hey, whoever did this, I'm gonna find them.

60
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,204
We're going to.

61
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,649
When I thought
that Sara died on the Gambit...

62
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,531
...the only thing I could do
was scream at the ocean.

63
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,049
I had so much anger and rage I didn't
know what to do with it. But I do now.

64
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,044
And I'm going to help you catch
whoever it is that did this.

65
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,282
You're already helping.

66
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,410
Laurel, you told us where to look.

67
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,520
- I'm just supposed to sit here and wait?
- No.

68
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,082
Now you take care of yourself
and your family.

69
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,644
Your father is gonna need you.

70
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,451
Telling him now, it would kill him.

71
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,291
If we wait until we catch whoever did this,
it'll be easier on him.

72
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,644
Okay.

73
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,765
Where are you going?

74
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,400
I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.

75
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,961
But I know that a bar is the last place
I should be.

76
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,323
Come on, pick up.

77
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,801
You've reached Thea. Leave a message.

78
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,167
Thea, it's Oliver. Uh...

79
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,851
I know you're still traveling,
but I just... I could really...

80
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,524
I'd really like to hear your voice.
So please call me back.

81
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,487
- What did we get off the cameras?
- The place is a drug haven.

82
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,803
They've all either been disabled
or paint-balled by local dealers.

83
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,041
- Where are you going?
- Where it happened.

84
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,041
Felicity told me.

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,001
You Okay?

86
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,926
The killer stood there.

87
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,562
- Loose gravel on the rooftop.
- Oliver.

88
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,929
Sara was here.
Scuff marks back to the edge.

89
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,844
You don't have to do this right now.

90
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,128
- It's the only thing that I can do.
- I get it.

91
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,402
Military training, stay on task.

92
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,002
Your friend gets shot, you keep fighting.
But, Oliver...

93
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,249
- I'm fine.
- Well, I'm here for you just the same.

94
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,529
Sara was my friend too. If you think
you're going after the person...

95
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,321
...who did this solo,
you couldn't possibly be more wrong.

96
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,850
- Yeah.
- Detective Lance called.

97
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,047
He says it's important.

98
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,565
Think he knows about Sara?

99
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,087
- What is it, detective?
- You okay?

100
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,284
You look like someone
peed in your Corn Flakes.

101
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,445
That kind of day, huh?

102
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,651
- What's going on?
- Another archer in town.

103
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,040
Dropping bodies.

104
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,722
- Seen this guy's work before?
- I might have.

105
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,241
You know where S.C.P.D.'s finest
might find him?

106
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,129
- Who's the victim?
- John Burke.

107
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,408
Some corporate financier from Qurac.

108
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,690
Seems like he wandered into the wrong part
of town looking for local entertainment...

109
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,808
...ended up with an arrow in his chest.

110
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,170
H9)'-

111
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,761
Watch your back, all right?
Whoever this guy is...

112
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,570
He's a killer.

113
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,811
Her hands are so small.

114
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,282
I never noticed before.

115
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,528
She was always so strong and brave.

116
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,202
I always envisioned her
as this sort of Amazonian warrior.

117
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,131
Invincible.

118
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,088
Something I could never be.

119
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,486
I was so jealous.

120
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,400
Hi. I know, I was supposed to come in
to work today. I... The... I'm sorry.

121
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,841
There's been a death in the family.

122
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,650
Thank you.

123
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,770
Do you have any idea
what other archer could have done this?

124
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,410
There aren't that many of us.

125
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,928
Maybe 1 O that I know of and most of them
are in the League of Assassins.

126
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,128
- Oliver, you don't think...?
- No.

127
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,165
No.

128
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,243
They don't target their own.

129
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,050
- What'd you find out?
- He hit again.

130
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,443
An abandoned warehouse on the corner
of Third and Lemire. Ninth floor.

131
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,525
The victim was a foreman, Tim Kaufmann.
Security cameras can't get an angle.

132
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,682
- Then who's that?
- Just some low-level dealers.

133
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,168
They set up shop in warehouses.
Doesn't look like an archer.

134
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,448
- He might be a witness.
- Where do you want me?

135
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,962
Will Lyla give you access
to A.R.G.U.S.'s database?

136
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,282
Lyla will give us access to A.R.G.U.S.

137
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,649
I need a list of everyone on their radar.
Assassins who use a bow.

138
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,006
I'm on it.

139
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,410
What?

140
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,725
Thea hasn't called back yet.

141
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,965
- You didn't eliminate the target.
- That's not a target. That's my best friend.

142
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,487
Why am I pointing a gun at my best friend?

143
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,642
- Is this some sort of test?
- Yes.

144
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,491
- One you failed.
- Good. Flunk me.

145
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,849
You think it's a coincidence your friend
showed up in Hong Kong?

146
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,049
- He's here looking for you.
- What?

147
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,680
When you logged into your e-mail,
it set off an alert.

148
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,763
Dead men don't check their e-mail, Oliver.

149
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,764
- So this is my fault?
- Waller needs you.

150
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,005
She can't let you be compromised by a rich kid
flashing your picture all over Hong Kong.

151
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,449
Whether you're the one who pulls the trigger
or not, she wants Tommy Merlyn off the board.

152
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,525
That is a Cobalt encrypted workstation.
You better not be using it to tweet.

153
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,367
I was... I was, um, actuallyjust...

154
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,124
Accessing an FBI database? What...?

155
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,847
Roy, why are you looking for Thea?

156
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,971
- I don't think she is where she says she is.
- Why would she lie?

157
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,641
Oliver needs to see this.

158
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,963
- No. This is my fault. He's gonna kill me.
- What if she's in trouble?

159
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,288
What if she's not?
What if she just needs space?

160
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,250
She's had five months
and thousands of miles of space.

161
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,040
Oliver needs to see this.

162
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,804
You need to show it to him.

163
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,525
You have got to be kidding me.

164
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,326
- Wait. Where are you going?
- There's someone I need to kill.

165
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,922
Did you do it to make a point?
Because I get it. Loud and clear.

166
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,730
You are rich. You are impulsive.

167
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,724
You are the creepiest stalker
that I have ever had to deal with.

168
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,531
Believe me, that is saying a lot.

169
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,001
What are you doing to our old offices?

170
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,441
Hi. I'll be right back.

171
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,887
Like it?
I'm trying to liven up the place a bit.

172
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,129
I'm hosting an event tonight.
A pledge drive of sorts.

173
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,930
Gotta make an impression, right?

174
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,126
- Now, what can I do for you?
- You can stop.

175
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,044
You can stop sending me flowers.

176
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,727
You can stop texting me and calling me
and e-mailing me, because I spam them.

177
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,120
Is spam a verb now?

178
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,124
Because I am never, ever,
ever going to work for you.

179
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,647
Actually, you already do.

180
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,451
Only because you bought the store
that I work at.

181
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,443
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

182
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,887
My boss just called
and told me that you did.

183
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,644
Well, he's wrong.

184
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,371
Kind of.

185
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,247
I bought the holding company
which owns all 20,000 Tech Village stores.

186
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,483
But I guess, either way,
yes, I am your boss now.

187
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,449
So you can either work for me here...

188
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,685
...in a big office with a big salary...

189
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,083
...or you can work for me there
in that awful uniform.

190
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,244
Or I can quit.

191
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,281
Which is What I just did.

192
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,327
You know, most girls would be flattered
that I spent $1.2 billion to hire them.

193
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,006
Even if I do have a plan
for rebranding the stores.

194
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,401
In case you hadn't noticed,
I am not most girls.

195
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,921
And I don't need this. Or you.

196
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,651
- Or any of this.
- Felicity, l...

197
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,610
I piss people off on a daily basis.
It's part of business...

198
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,048
...and well, being the smartest guy
in any given room, I own that.

199
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,242
I have enough experience with people...

200
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,607
...to know when they're angry
at something else.

201
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,764
You, right now, are not angry at me.

202
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,766
What's your something else?

203
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,445
- Money won't fix this problem.
- Money won't solve most problems.

204
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,125
Not the ones that matter.

205
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,123
But talking helps.

206
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,249
I know we barely know each other.

207
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,289
I'm gonna leave now.

208
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,966
Listen, whatever happened, I'm sorry.

209
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,126
It helps to remember that it gets better.

210
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,010
Someone was murdered here.
Tell me what you saw.

211
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,241
I saw nothing.

212
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,447
It was a black face mask. Like a...

213
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,682
Like a hockey mask. Please, man.

214
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,928
Diggle, are you at A.R.G.U.S.?
I've got something.

215
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,726
Yeah, I'm here.

216
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,121
I've got a list of archers 20 long, man.

217
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,931
- How many of them wear masks?
- Only one.

218
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,804
Simon Lacroix. Mercenary.

219
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,766
Goes by Komodo.

220
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,611
- Send Felicity everything.
- Yep.

221
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,967
Oliver, I'm opening up the file now.

222
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,641
- Is that him?
- Born in Sainte-Sophie, Quebec.

223
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,887
Raised by a single mom.

224
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,249
Terrible credit score.
And wanted for murder in seven countries.

225
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,209
- I need his location.
- One minute.

226
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,849
Put him on speaker.

227
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,210
Indexing all active burner cell phones
within the city limits.

228
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,243
That's gotta be 10,000 phones.

229
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,809
Yes, but how many are making calls
to dear old morn in Saints-Sophie, Quebec?

230
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,803
I got him. He's on the move.

231
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,850
I found Lacroix.

232
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,368
- I need to see what's happening.
- Okay. Pulling up street camera feed.

233
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,203
Oliver, what's happening?

234
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,801
Come on, Ollie.

235
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,291
- Get up.
- Oliver?

236
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,406
Are you okay? Oliver?

237
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,601
Oliver, you okay?

238
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,400
He got away.

239
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,769
- I had him, Diggle.
- From the way you look, he almost had you.

240
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,890
- Where's Roy?
- He's out canvassing.

241
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,441
- Tell me about the driver.
- His name is Erlich Kelso.

242
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,723
- He just got out of Starling General.
- Where are we with Lacroix?

243
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,724
- Ditched his burner.
- I'm searching for any calls to Quebec.

244
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,531
We used that to track him once.
He's not gonna let it happen again.

245
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,206
We stop searching for Lacroix
and start searching for his target.

246
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,290
- There must be a connection with his victims.
- Already on it.

247
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,645
Well, I mean, what if we just...?
We go to a local morgue...

248
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,521
...and we find a body
that looks like Tommy's?

249
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,205
At the Hong Kong morgue?

250
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,728
You've got a better chance of winning
the lottery and paying Waller off.

251
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,730
I'm not gonna assassinate my best friend.
Do you understand?

252
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,003
There has to be another way.

253
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,004
There is.

254
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,165
But it involves Amanda Waller finding
someone else to execute your friend.

255
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,082
No, not you, Dad.
Look, I'm already in Hong Kong.

256
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,201
No, I didn't tell you I was taking the jet,
because I knew you would freak out like this.

257
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,449
No, I don't know how long, okay?
It doesn't matter.

258
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,401
Listen, if Oliver is still alive,
if he is still here...

259
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,560
Look, why don't you just go back
to banging your Pilates instructor, okay?

260
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,362
I'll just be here searching
for my best friend.

261
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,409
I'm sorry, miss. You can't go in there.

262
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,126
Laurel Lance.
I'm with the District Attorney's Office.

263
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,124
Erlich Kelso is a witness
of my ongoing investigation.

264
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,886
- Mr. Kelso is under protective custody.
- Not from me.

265
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,521
If you have a problem with that,
call your captain.

266
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,003
Tell him his daughter says hello.

267
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,804
- Who are you?
- I work in the DA's office.

268
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,201
I already told the police
I don't know anything.

269
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,048
I still have to ask you a few questions.

270
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,607
- Why isn't this working?
- It is.

271
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,441
It's running an NSA algorithm, aggregating
the victims' personal information...

272
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,166
...using every government database
known and unknown.

273
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,606
It's taking too long.

274
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,764
Sara's killer is out there,
which means every minute we waste...

275
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,209
I know. You don't need to tell me
as if I don't already know.

276
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,845
You're right.

277
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,689
And I apologize. I just need
your A game right now, Felicity.

278
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,683
I don't have it.

279
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,366
My friend, our friend, was shot with arrows
and fell off of a rooftop.

280
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,603
Her body is upstairs,
right above us, in a freezer...

281
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,560
...because we don't know what
to do with it, with her.

282
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,045
So I am so sorry, Oliver, if I have
feelings, but maybe if you did too, we...

283
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,448
I'm sorry. That was mean.

284
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,881
But this is Sara we're talking about.

285
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,644
Your Sara.

286
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,249
How can you stand there
being so cold and rational?

287
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,410
Because I don't have the luxury
of falling to pieces.

288
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,247
Everyone's looking to
me to handle things...

289
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,641
...to make the right decisions.

290
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,761
Everyone is looking to me to lead.

291
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,524
If I grieve...

292
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,808
...nobody else gets to.

293
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,524
You're still a human being, Oliver.

294
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,569
You're allowed to have feelings.

295
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,401
I know sometimes that it's easier
to live under that hood.

296
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,164
I'm not.

297
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,486
Earlier today, I was looking at Sara.

298
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,043
I realized something.

299
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,884
One of these days, it's gonna be me.

300
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,644
And this...

301
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,562
This life that I've chosen...

302
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,124
...it only ends one way.

303
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,369
So that's it?

304
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,562
You're just gonna spend your life hiding
down here in this cave, waiting to die?

305
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,127
I'm sorry, I'm not gonna wait with you.

306
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:55,002
Because if there's one thing that today
has taught me, it is that life is precious.

307
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,080
And I want so much more to mine than this.

308
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,281
Let's start with the obvious.
Why would someone wanna kill you?

309
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,321
I have no idea. This whole thing,
it's insane.

310
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,601
Mr. Kelso, despite what you may have heard,
homicides at the hands of a stranger are rare.

311
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,121
Imagine how rare homicides
by bow and arrow are.

312
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,931
- Yeah, the guy was a sicko.
- And you're a liar.

313
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,447
- I'm the victim here.
- You're also a witness, my witness.

314
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,122
You better give me something useful,
or you'll face an obstruction charge.

315
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,648
I wanna talk to your boss,
because you can't treat people like this.

316
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,245
You wanna talk to my boss?

317
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,044
- Oh!
- How's your arm feeling?

318
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,531
What are you doing?

319
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,082
John Burke and Tim Kaufmann,
they were also shot dead with arrows.

320
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,965
- And they're too dead to tell me why.
- I can't.

321
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,931
- Aah!
- Burke and Kaufmann...

322
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,168
...what do the two of them
have to do with you?

323
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,291
We're all working on a deal,
but nobody was supposed to know about it.

324
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,169
- What kind of deal?
- To build an oil pipeline...

325
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,330
...for AmerTek. it's...

326
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,007
You've reached Thea. Leave a message.

327
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,808
Hey, Thea, it's me again. And...

328
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:49,411
I don't know if you're getting these messages,
but I'd really like to talk to you, so please...

329
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,126
...just call me back.

330
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,246
Bye.

331
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,249
Lyla has multiple teams
trying to get an angle on Lacroix.

332
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,761
Where's Felicity?

333
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,765
Hmm?

334
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,525
She needed some air.

335
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,927
What do you need, Oliver?

336
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,085
I just need Thea to call me back.

337
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,961
That's not gonna happen.

338
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,806
Why? What do you mean?

339
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,290
It was during the siege.

340
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,648
We were gonna run away, but I couldn't
leave without helping you fight.

341
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,290
When I came back, she was gone.

342
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,447
I didn't say anything, because this is my fault.
She knew I was lying to her the entire time.

343
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,202
I'm sorry I didn't say anything about
the letter. I know that I should have.

344
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,810
Okay.

345
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,083
Felicity, I really need to talk to you, so please,
can you call me back as soon as you get this?

346
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,890
Laurel.

347
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,044
- Baby, are you all right? Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

348
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,647
A guy just got skewered right in front
of you, I hope you're not fine.

349
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,802
What were you doing here
in the first place?

350
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,691
- The district attorney...
- Did not send you.

351
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,769
You lied to my officers,
and now you're gonna stand there...

352
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,649
...and you're gonna lie to me?

353
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,926
- I needed to talk to him. It was important.
- Look.

354
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,009
I know you wanna help, but you don't need to
take these kind of risks, do you understand?

355
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,845
Pretty sure your sister's got that covered
for both of you.

356
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,766
Yeah.

357
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,890
Go home. We got this.

358
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,090
Okay?

359
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,122
I've got something. Meet me at Verdant.

360
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,645
AmerTek Industries,
it's an oil company based in Starling City.

361
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,600
Okay, now that I've consolidated
all of Lacroix's victims' records...

362
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,889
...I can run an algorithm
and see who received money from AmerTek.

363
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,042
- How long does that take?
- Not long.

364
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,931
A million to Kelso, one more to Burke.
Two more to Kaufmann.

365
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,881
All from a subsidiary from AmerTek in Qurac,
the largest untapped oil field on the planet.

366
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,641
- AmerTek was trying to strike an oil deal.
- Someone paid Lacroix to stop it.

367
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,724
- None of this explains Sara.
- Sara told me she worked in Qurac.

368
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,161
And by worked,
I mean she killed people for the league.

369
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,006
- She might've brought her work home?
- Who authorized the payments?

370
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,082
Board member of AmerTek
called Tom Weston.

371
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,402
Lacroix's next target. What's his location?

372
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,771
You will not believe where he's headed.

373
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,961
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm coming with you.

374
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,090
- Absolutely not.
- The only reason you know where to find him...

375
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,841
You were reckless.
And Lacroix almost put an arrow in you.

376
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,766
Let me handle this.

377
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,802
Don't tell me to stay put and think I'll
listen. You know me better than that.

378
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,608
Sara was trained by some of the greatest
killers in history. Lacroix put her down.

379
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,843
- What is he gonna do to you?
- I don't care about anything except getting him.

380
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,287
- And I will.
- You couldn't before.

381
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,761
I won't let him escape again.

382
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,967
I promise.

383
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,289
- Hi.
- Mr. Palmer.

384
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,442
Good evening. Hey.

385
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,886
Good to see you.

386
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,644
Thanks for coming. Thanks.

387
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,043
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Ray Palmer.

388
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,962
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you all for coming out tonight.

389
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,401
Given all that has befallen this city,
it's easy for us to lose hope.

390
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,450
To hide in our castles, be thankful
that our ledgers are in the black.

391
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:08,960
But we, the city's most affluent businessmen
and women, hold its future in our hands.

392
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,805
Tonight, I'm making a pledge.

393
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,324
I will give away half my net worth
to the benefit of our home.

394
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,925
And this will be my salary for the year.

395
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,288
So tonight, I invite you all to join me
in this investment.

396
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,329
Not just with your money.

397
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,007
But with your ingenuity
and most importantly, your time.

398
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,443
This city is my home, but it's yours too.

399
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,570
So help make Star City our future.

400
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,171
So you're the Arrow.

401
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,451
- I thought you'd be taller.
- It's over.

402
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,604
Lower your bow and live.

403
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,963
We both know that's not gonna happen.

404
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,527
- Who hired you?
- Who is she?

405
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,242
- You don't wanna do this.
- Yes, I do.

406
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,681
Killing him won't bring her back.

407
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,491
I know it won't bring her back. She's dead.

408
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,601
I've stood where you are, where you're so
consumed with rage you can hardly breathe...

409
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,240
...and you think taking revenge
will make it better.

410
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,450
But, Laurel, it won't.
It only makes it worse.

411
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,402
- No, he murdered Sara.
- Who's Sara?

412
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,688
My sister, you son of a bitch.

413
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,646
Two nights ago
you put an arrow in her chest.

414
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,290
Two nights ago I was drunk in Bludhaven.

415
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,968
- You're lying.
- I'm proud of my work.

416
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,491
- I wouldn't deny it.
- Even with a gun in your face?

417
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,961
- Laurel, you need to stop and listen to him.
- No.

418
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,324
- No, he killed my sister.
- Laurel, Sara wouldn't...

419
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,280
Don't you dare tell me
that this isn't what Sara would've wanted!

420
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,489
Don't you tell me to think of her,
because I am thinking of her.

421
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,926
Laurel, if you pull that trig...

422
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,010
You took the bullets out of the gun.

423
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,806
We have to go.

424
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,131
Lacroix's alibi checks out.

425
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,450
Two murders in Bludhaven. Same M.O.

426
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,210
Same night Sara was killed.

427
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,600
I almost killed Lacroix.

428
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,161
The only thing that matters is you didn't.

429
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,803
Laurel, the trail's run cold.

430
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,444
I'm going to find whoever did this.

431
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,523
I Will.

432
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,410
But I don't know when.

433
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,087
Your father deserves to know.

434
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,808
Hey. I got some info here
on the Lacroix fellow.

435
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,885
Yeah, some stuff's come through.
I don't know, yeah, it looks pretty good.

436
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,762
Lacroix. With an X, yeah. I don't know,
the guy's French or something. Why...?

437
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,369
Oh. Hold on, hold on, I
gotta call you back.

438
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,047
Laurel, baby, what's wrong?

439
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,406
Hold on.

440
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,806
What is it?

441
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,604
Just tell me. Tell me. What is it?

442
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,122
It's about last night.

443
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,081
At the hospital...

444
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,531
...I lied to you.

445
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,205
You deserve to know the truth and...

446
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,889
Sorry, sweetheart.

447
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,362
Damn thing goes off every hour
if I don't take my pills.

448
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,968
Laurel, what do you know? You were
in the middle of telling me something.

449
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,201
I just wanted to say that...

450
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,004
That I'm really sorry.

451
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,726
I know that I should've told you the truth.
I just...

452
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,485
I just couldn't.

453
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:26,328
Hey, I'm your dad. I forgive you.

454
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,322
I always forgive you.

455
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,651
It's all right.

456
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,408
She can rest now. She's home.

457
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,965
It's a Jewish custom.

458
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,207
I know she wasn't, but it feels right.

459
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,570
Laurel.

460
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,885
No, this isn't right.

461
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,920
This isn't...
She doesn't even get a fresh grave?

462
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,761
It's so perverse.

463
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,487
She deserves a proper burial.

464
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,167
- She's earned it.
- No, it's not fair.

465
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,641
No one will ever really know who she was.

466
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,924
Oliver, it's not fair. It's not fair.

467
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,600
Laurel, we'll know.

468
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,925
I know this doesn't count for much...

469
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,686
...but me and Lyla,
we're naming the baby Sara.

470
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,003
We will never forget.

471
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,245
Thank you.

472
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,564
How did I...?

473
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,448
What the hell is going on here?

474
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,681
Where am I?

475
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,801
Please, please don't hurt me.

476
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,122
Look, just let me go, please.

477
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,250
I promise, I won't tell anybody about this.

478
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,166
Would a fisherman
throw his prized catch back in the sea?

479
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,841
What are you talking about?

480
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,289
Look, whoever you are,
you really don't wanna do this.

481
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,444
Do you have any idea who I am?
Who my father is?

482
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,409
You're Thomas Merlyn.

483
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,726
You've been looking for Oliver Queen.

484
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,530
How do you...? How do you know that?

485
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,650
A simple hack
of a missing billionaire's e-mail account.

486
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:02,285
I knew somebody would come looking for him, but
I thought it would be his mother, his sister.

487
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:08,402
But you, the son of the CEO
of Merlyn Global, jackpot.

488
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,408
My friend,
you are gonna make me a very rich man.

489
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,409
So Oliver didn't...?

490
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,809
He isn't...?

491
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,049
Oliver Queen is dead.

492
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,407
He's rotting at the bottom of the ocean.

493
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,924
And you will too...

494
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,488
- ...if your father doesn't pay that ransom.
- Hong Kong police.

495
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,564
- I'm in here! Please help! Help!
- Hands up.

496
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,722
- Hong Kong police.
- Please, please, please.

497
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,809
Please, please, please.

498
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,007
Thank you.

499
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,323
- You're going home. You're safe.
- Thank you, thank you.

500
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,080
I'm gonna catch whoever killed her.

501
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,324
I know you are.

502
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,647
And until you do, I'm back on the team.

503
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,082
What about your family?

504
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,449
Sara is family, Oliver. Just like you, man.

505
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,611
So now what?

506
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,601
Now I gotta go get Thea.

507
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,646
It's long past time she came home.

508
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,485
John.

509
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,881
I don't wanna die down here.

510
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,369
So don't, Oliver.

511
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,321
- Hey.
- Hi.

512
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,291
Changed your mind.

513
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,768
I just decided I want more out of life.

514
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,886
Well done.

515
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,443
Thanks, Dad.
