1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,482
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,290
After five years in hell...

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,369
...I have come home with only one goal:

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,443
To save my city.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,568
Now others have joined my crusade.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,802
To them, I'm Oliver Queen.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,282
To the rest of Starling City,
lam someone else.

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,683
I am something else.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,763
Previously on Arrow:

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,691
I killed him. The police officer.
Why didn't you tell me?

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,406
You were overdosed on Mirakuru.
You didn't remember.

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,210
I was hoping that you never would.

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,763
This city still needs saving,
and that is my vision for this company.

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,445
Yes, I am your boss now.

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,722
I can quit, which is what I just did.

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,123
I thought that I could be me and the Arrow,
but I can't.

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,009
Say it'll never work out between us.

18
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,288
- Say you never loved me, say...
- Felicity.

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,802
I told you as soon as we talked,
it would be over.

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,362
- What changed your mind?
- I just decided I want more out of life.

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,847
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Cupid, stupid.

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,050
In the last five minutes,
S.C.P.D. has had over 200 reports...

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,009
...of masked men attacking the city.

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,242
- There's 3.8 miles to the bridge.
- And a dozen Mirakuru soldiers.

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,607
- Stop.
- Stop? Here? We're already late.

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,205
Stop.

27
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,603
Everybody, get back inside.

28
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,209
Isaac Stanzler.

29
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,922
The two of you got the
same taste in outfits.

30
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,163
- Thought he was in custody.
- Yeah.

31
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,922
Corrections was transporting him
to Iron Heights when he got pincushioned.

32
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,851
- By who?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,250
But whoever it was went to a lot of trouble,
dressing him up and dumping him like this.

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,846
Our doer is definitely trying
to get your attention.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,207
Well, he's got it. Any leads yet?

36
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,251
No, only physical evidence
other than the body is this.

37
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,767
It's shaped like a spade.
What's that all about?

38
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,126
I don't know.

39
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,125
I'll look into it.

40
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,163
I'm not your mother, or your wife.

41
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,885
- Or your maid.
- Okay. All right.

42
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,929
You don't like me. I get it.

43
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,687
- At least you're perceptive.
- I thought that in the last week...

44
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,970
...we did the whole candle meditation
thing, and maybe we had a moment.

45
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,169
Moment's over. You can celebrate
by doing your own laundry.

46
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,450
- Yeah.
- What?

47
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,444
L... I don't know how.

48
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,927
Where you going?

49
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,809
Waller just called.

50
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,931
New intel on this Li Kuan Hui
the Triad's interested in.

51
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,481
- What?
- My contact is down at the docks.

52
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,847
A gaijin would stick out
like neon down there.

53
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,250
- Gaijin?
- It'll be fine.

54
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,644
I'll only be gone an hour.

55
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,290
What am I supposed to do?

56
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,160
Your laundry, apparently.

57
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,766
What are you doing? We were supposed to be
at the press conference 20 minutes ago.

58
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,561
Oh, God, I have a type.

59
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,129
Richard Branson works out twice a day. Gives him
20 additional hours of productivity a week.

60
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,329
I'm sorry, I can't hear a word
you're saying when you're doing...

61
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,851
...that.

62
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,845
- Sorry. What's up?
- The announcement?

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,482
There's a gajillion reporters
and city notables waiting for you.

64
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,366
Oh, ha. Well, this'll be interesting. Ha.

65
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,128
BTW, are you free
for dinner tomorrow night?

66
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,649
- What?
- I have a dinner with the CEO...

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,325
...of a Nevada mining concern.

68
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,686
They own mineral rights...

69
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,162
...imperative to the cogeneration project.
And I fit into this how?

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,368
The CEO is boring.
His wife, even more boring.

71
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,967
If I go solo, I'll end up slicing
my wrist open with a butter knife.

72
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,363
Well, I don't think a butter knife
is gonna do the job.

73
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,927
Oh. There will be steak knives there too.
Dangerous.

74
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,130
I'm sure you have a dozen other employees
better suited as your anti-boring wing-woman.

75
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,968
Hundreds, actually.

76
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,202
But you are the one I
bought this dress for.

77
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,330
This dress...

78
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,730
...costs more than my apartment.

79
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,803
Yeah, it's couture.

80
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,486
Which I'm pretty sure is French
for "expensive."

81
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,243
- Oh.
- So dinner?

82
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,290
Purely platonic.

83
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,487
There is nothing platonic about couture.

84
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,761
Fine, I'll have my assistant return it.

85
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,082
No... All right, I'll go, I'll go.

86
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,847
- But only so I can wear this dress.
- Of course.

87
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,281
You and I are gonna be best friends.

88
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,887
- Hey.
- Last time I saw a spade that lethal...

89
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,441
...it cut up a pretty good royal flush
I was holding.

90
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,241
- Hand-soldered out of high-carbon steel.
- Where'd you find it?

91
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,004
Isaac Stanzler's chest.

92
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,929
Ted Grant's psycho sidekick?

93
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,646
Was murdered while being transferred
by the S.C.P.D.

94
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,245
By an arrow.

95
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,767
- Think this is the same archer that killed Sara?
- No.

96
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,405
MO is different.

97
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,530
These bodies were staged.
Dressed up to look like...

98
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,765
Copycat archer. Guess all that positive
publicity you've been getting has a downside.

99
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,968
Whatever the reason, we need to find him.

100
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,723
I would like Felicity
to do a workup on all of this ASAP.

101
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,564
COPY-

102
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,927
- I think Felicity's a little busy right now.
- Doing what?

103
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,641
A few months ago, I made a promise
to help revitalize Starling City.

104
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,640
But I knew I couldn't do it alone.
I needed help.

105
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,566
A lot of help.

106
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,248
From people who are even more intelligent
and dedicated than I am.

107
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,210
All of us are working very hard
with one goal in mind:

108
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,442
To save our city.

109
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,322
But to do so, Queen Consolidated
needs to be something else.

110
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,845
You Okay?

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,764
I'm fine.

112
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,250
You don't seem fine.

113
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,011
What is this?

114
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,682
- What's that? A note?
- It's an address.

115
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,968
15 Baron Street.

116
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,246
Apartment 7.

117
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,723
Nobody's home.

118
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,168
These are all articles about the Arrow.

119
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,607
This isn't just a copycat. This is a fan.

120
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,730
And from the looks of it,
a pretty dedicated one.

121
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,924
And this isn't a spade.

122
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,571
It's a heart.

123
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,324
It's you. I can't believe it's really you.

124
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,686
Did you like your present?

125
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,322
Do you mean Isaac Stanzler,
the man you killed?

126
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,682
I see the way you take care of your city.

127
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,888
Makes me wonder...

128
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,689
...who takes care of you?

129
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,809
I wanna help you.

130
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,371
To fight with you.

131
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,887
To kill for you.

132
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,850
Mr. Stanzler was just the first.

133
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,046
He might be the second.

134
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,925
I thought we could punish
this one together.

135
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,404
- I'm gonna find you.
- Well, that's the idea.

136
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,329
But you'd better hurry.
I don't think he's got very long.

137
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,926
Roy.

138
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,810
I was just researching cheap booze
for Thea's club.

139
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,481
You know, it wasn't you
who killed that officer.

140
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,291
I keep telling myself that,
but it's not working.

141
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,090
Every single time I put on that mask,
I feel like a fraud.

142
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,810
You...

143
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,530
You have to give this time.

144
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,123
- If you wanna talk about it...
- I don't.

145
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,089
I appreciate the offer, though.

146
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,164
But I'm fine, really.

147
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,051
- Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?
- I was just leaving.

148
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,044
I gotta help Thea get the club ready
for the opening.

149
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,360
What's up?

150
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,128
I got an ID on your "not so secret
but very crazy" admirer's hostage.

151
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,209
- Who is it?
- Joe Gravano, local mob boss.

152
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,727
Wanted for 39 murders,
racketeering, drug smuggling.

153
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,487
- One of the most protected men in the city.
- Not anymore.

154
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,689
- What's NPP?
- I don't know.

155
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,089
But I can definitely find out.

156
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,288
And the cell phone from her apartment?

157
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,523
Crazypants encrypted the SIM.
I can crack it, but it'll take time.

158
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,486
Which we don't have. Neither does he.
I need all your focus on finding Gravano.

159
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,729
And I will work around the clock on it,
except for tonight.

160
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,360
- Why?
- Ray Palmer invited me to dinner.

161
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,607
Oh.

162
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,967
Not "dinner" dinner, like a date.
A work dinner.

163
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,047
But since dinner is a meal you can technically
only eat at night, I need the night off.

164
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,085
That okay?

165
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,089
Do what you want.

166
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,731
Nothing?

167
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,969
- He's not answering his cell.
- Just relax.

168
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,363
- I'm sure he's fine.
- He said it would only be an hour.

169
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,722
That was nine hours ago.

170
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,930
If he's going to be late, he always calls.

171
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,845
He said his contact
was down at the docks, right?

172
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,002
I will go down and check it out.

173
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,525
No, I'll go.

174
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,565
No offense, but you're just Mase0's wife.

175
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,482
And you're just a billionaire...

176
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,211
...who doesn't know how to use
a laundry machine.

177
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,211
Do you have someone who
could watch Akio for a few hours?

178
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,683
Great. Uh, thank you. You were terrific.

179
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,650
Auditions are over.
Thanks for coming, guys.

180
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,926
Hey, peace out.

181
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,163
Wait, what are you doing?
Auditions are not over.

182
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,761
Trust me, I'm saving you
from wasting your day here.

183
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,763
I don't need saving from anyone.

184
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,241
And if you're really as good
as you say you are...

185
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,131
...you can wait in line and prove it,
like everyone else.

186
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,408
- I don't audition.
- Then you don't work.

187
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,849
For me or for my club.
So the exit's that way.

188
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,049
Later, princess.

189
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,971
I got her. The user registered
to the encrypted SIM card.

190
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,284
Carrie Cutter. She's former S.C.P.D.
She was the first woman SWAT team member.

191
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,605
I've seen her before.

192
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,287
She's not unpretty for a wacko,
if you're into the red-headed vixen type.

193
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,764
- She was police. That's why she looks familiar.
- No, she left the force before you got back.

194
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,810
But there's another very good reason
she looks familiar.

195
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,611
Why was she at the crime scene
at Ted Grant's gym?

196
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,569
I don't know, but it's not just there.

197
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,043
Apparently stalking isn't her only hobby either.
She's a member of a gardening group too.

198
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,204
- Which explains the whole NPP thing.
- What NPP thing?

199
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,091
The bag in the Gravano hostage photo.
NPP is an acronym.

200
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,370
Stands for "nitrogen, phosphate, potash."
It's the chemical formula for fertilizer.

201
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,601
So, what if she's keeping Gravano
in a greenhouse?

202
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,966
Yeah.

203
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,569
The closest one to her apartment
is Sherwood Florist, 7884 Hauser.

204
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,371
- Have Roy gear up and meet me there.
- Okay.

205
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,645
Roy.

206
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,569
- Find Gravano. I'll take care of Cutter.
- Got it.

207
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,768
Arsenal, there's no sign of Cutter.

208
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,530
Arsenal?

209
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,041
Arsenal.

210
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,565
Hello, lover.

211
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,130
- If you hurt him...
- I didn't touch him, boyfriend.

212
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,886
I'm a one-guy woman.

213
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,170
But I am a little disappointed
you brought your wingman.

214
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,608
Tonight's not about him. It's about us.

215
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,330
Together against the world.

216
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,729
Just like we were meant to be.

217
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,803
There is no "we."

218
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,088
We're more like one soul. You're right.

219
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,447
You and I are more alike than you think.

220
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,962
Carrie, listen to me. You're not well.

221
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,481
If I'm out of my mind,
it's because that's what love is.

222
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,927
Our own little slice of insanity.

223
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,050
Make a wish.

224
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,768
Mine's already come true.

225
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,925
For the two of us to be together forever.

226
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,003
Help me. Don't leave me with this psycho.

227
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,810
- Quiet!
- You don't wanna do this.

228
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,086
Sure I do.

229
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,891
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

230
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,611
That rope's laced with a trip wire hooked
up to a thing on his chest that goes boom.

231
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,445
- So, what do you want, then?
- Not much.

232
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,684
Just you.

233
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,365
Never gonna happen.

234
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,761
Such a party POOPQT-

235
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,120
Never thought I'd be happy to see you.

236
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,366
Roy, hey!

237
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,882
You should go home, man.
It's been a long night.

238
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,202
She took me out.
That shouldn't have happened.

239
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,762
You... You're not at your best.

240
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,160
I'm fine.

241
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,402
You weren't the only person Carrie stalked.

242
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,803
She was put on limited duty
after becoming obsessed with her partner.

243
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,645
The department sent her
to St. Walker's for a psych eval.

244
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,723
She quit the force a little bit after.

245
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,201
- Where's Felicity?
- She's working tonight.

246
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,284
- She said she told you.
- Yes, she did.

247
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,363
Oliver, you okay?

248
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,047
I know this can't be easy with Felicity
spending so much time with Palmer.

249
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,690
I'm fine.

250
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,923
- Where you going?
- The psychiatrist that S.C.P.D. sent Cutter to.

251
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,526
- You need backup?
- No, I've got it.

252
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,766
Hey. Like what you've done to the place.

253
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,049
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, I was just in the neighborhood.

254
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,966
- Thought I'd stop by, check out your new sign.
- Oh, yeah.

255
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,083
Well, that's a nice dress.

256
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,689
Yeah, it's really, really, really nice.

257
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,966
Ray lent it to me for a work dinner.

258
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:27,126
- Yeah, this work dinner with you and Ray...
- Mm-hm.

259
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,328
...doesn't seem that platonic.

260
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,126
Actually, it has Oliver
twisted up in knots.

261
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,483
- Well, Oliver made his choice.
- And we both know that was the wrong choice.

262
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,404
Did Oliver say that?

263
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,450
Yeah, because Oliver's just great
at expressing his emotions.

264
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,366
He would rather go 1 O rounds with
the League of Assassins than ever say that.

265
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,966
But this thing with you and Palmer, it's...

266
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,523
It's messing with his head,
Felicity, and that's really dangerous.

267
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,002
I told you, there is no me and Palmer.

268
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,403
But if there were,
and if Oliver had a problem with it...

269
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,609
...then Oliver should be the one
to say something.

270
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,725
Okay.

271
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,126
Good night.

272
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,404
- Dr. Pressnall...
- Oh, my God.

273
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,891
I'm not here to hurt you.

274
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,242
- What do you want?
- To talk about Carrie Cutter.

275
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,165
I can't. Doctor-patient privilege.
Just, please, get out.

276
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,644
Your patient killed a man, kidnapped
another, and I'm trying to stop her...

277
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,410
...before she hurts anyone else.

278
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,245
But to do that, I need to understand her.

279
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,571
Please.

280
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,282
I can only diagnose her.

281
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:57,603
Attachment disorder. The inability
to form real, lasting relationships.

282
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,005
They push everyone away
and fixate on a single person.

283
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,362
Someone they feel mirrors
their emotional state.

284
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,646
How do I stop her?

285
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,366
Give her the connection that she craves.

286
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,887
Honesty, sincerity...

287
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,362
If you lie to her, she'll know.

288
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,284
Thank you.

289
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,527
If you'll permit a
professional observation...

290
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,521
...you could use a little therapy yourself.
What gives you that impression?

291
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,321
You mean apart from the mask
and the Robin Hood costume?

292
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,765
Shouldn't we get out and look around or...?

293
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,524
I don't... Something?

294
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,206
In this place? At this hour?

295
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,806
That's a very efficient way
to get yourself killed.

296
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,441
- Feel free.
- Heh.

297
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,451
Thank you, that's... We'll wait, then.

298
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,885
Gaijin.

299
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,285
What?

300
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,647
Maseo called me that before he left...

301
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,690
...and I looked it up,
but it wasn't in my Chinese dictionary.

302
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,002
Because it's Japanese.

303
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,091
It means foreigner.

304
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,365
Outsider.

305
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,128
- You.
- It means you too.

306
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,688
You're Japanese living in Hong Kong.

307
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,966
Sorry.

308
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,008
Why did you leave Japan?

309
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,362
- It wasn't safe for us there.
- Why?

310
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,688
We upset some very powerful,
very dangerous men.

311
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,205
Who?

312
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,685
- You ask a lot of questions.
- That's what your husband says.

313
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,129
Who's that?

314
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,850
Shu Gang, rivals of the Triad.
They control this port.

315
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,761
So they know what happened to Maseo?

316
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,407
I don't know.

317
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,845
Only one way to find out.

318
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,965
Hey, I don't want any trouble.

319
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,844
What happened to the thing?

320
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,331
Wow.

321
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,801
You are ridiculous.

322
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,691
_Um__
Which I mean in a good way.

323
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,289
That's not creepy.

324
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,525
- You look beautiful.
- Oh. I think it's the dress. Heh.

325
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,524
- Dress is actually missing something.
- Oh, no.

326
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,923
I forgot to do up the zipper again.
I always do that.

327
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,849
Oh, no, I can't wear that.

328
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,367
I'm not even sure
I'm supposed to be looking at it.

329
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,930
Well, I had to put down a $10,000 security
deposit just to borrow it for the evening...

330
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,926
...so one of us should wear it,
and diamonds aren't really my thing, so...

331
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,246
I appreciate it, but I think I would feel
strange wearing a million-dollar necklace.

332
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,771
Oh, don't worry.

333
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,968
It's not worth a million dollars.

334
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,204
Ah...

335
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,524
Think it was actually appraised
for 10 million dollars, so...

336
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,531
There you go. That's better.

337
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,680
Where you been?
You don't call, you don't write.

338
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,042
I've been busy, busy, busy.

339
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,965
You look good.

340
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,086
Business before pleasure.

341
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,685
First I located every crime scene the Arrow's
been spotted at in the past six months.

342
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,165
Now the magic part. I created an algorithm
calculating the average amount of time...

343
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,924
...it takes the Arrow to reach a crime scene,
triangulated that by the distance to said scene.

344
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,367
Genius, right? I know,
no one had thought to do it before.

345
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,127
Now, obviously I can't pinpoint
the exact block...

346
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,161
...but there's no doubt your guy hangs his
hat, or his hoodie, somewhere in this area.

347
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,245
- And you're sure about this?
- Statistical correlations do not lie.

348
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,165
Now...

349
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,170
...what was this about pleasure?

350
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,921
I'm sorry.

351
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,686
I'm spoken for.

352
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,090
- How'd it go with Cutter's shrink?
- Whew.

353
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,004
There's a reason I'm not in therapy.

354
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,091
Yo.

355
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,648
- Detective.
- Your new girlfriend...

356
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,691
...just put another heart-shaped arrow
in the neck of one of her old Cl's.

357
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,491
- Who was he?
- Kirby Bates.

358
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,565
Some kind of computer expert.
Holed up in a flophouse north of Amsterdam.

359
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,611
Did a five-year bit in Iron Heights. Stole
a couple million credit-card PIN numbers.

360
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,240
- What did Bates do for her?
- I don't know.

361
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,967
Everything here is smashed to pieces.

362
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,085
But smart money says whatever Cutter's
planning next, you're not gonna like it.

363
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,049
Thanks, detective.

364
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,084
- We need Felicity here.
- Oliver, she's still at dinner with...

365
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,402
I don't care where she is.
We need her here.

366
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,769
- You need her to be any place Ray Palmer isn't.
- It's not the time.

367
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,287
You're in the field
without your head on straight.

368
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,841
- This is exactly the time.
- I've got it handled.

369
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,809
Doesn't look that way to me.

370
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,088
What do you want me to say?

371
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,771
Yes, it bothers me that she is
out to dinner with Palmer.

372
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,561
Yes, it bothers me that apparently
she is just moving on with her life.

373
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,964
But I made a decision.
She did too. And all...

374
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,682
I just... I want her to be happy.

375
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,128
If that were true, you'd be with her, man.

376
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,768
- Where you going?
- Flophouse on Amsterdam.

377
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,009
- They're long gone by now.
- Maybe she didn't get that far.

378
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,888
I'm here looking for my husband.

379
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,249
Thin beard. Long hair. Japanese.

380
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,289
Don't know any Japanese. Uhn.

381
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,965
TW again.

382
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,606
- I don't know anything.
- A.R.G.U.S.

383
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,649
Does that mean something to you?

384
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,326
I don't know anything.

385
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,371
Except...

386
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,411
Three men. This A.R.G.U.S.
They work for them.

387
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,925
Worked.

388
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,480
What do you mean?

389
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,364
They're all dead.

390
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,205
Killed by Triad a few hours ago.

391
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,840
- Ah. Mr. Gardner, Ray Palmer.
- Good.

392
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,527
Mrs. Gardner. This is Felicity Smoak,
vice president of Palmer Technologies.

393
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,727
- Hell0.
- Pleasure.

394
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,680
- Thank you for sitting down with us.
- Well, I'm always happy to enjoy a good meal.

395
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,525
And I'm very impressed
with your background.

396
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,287
But I have no plans
of selling my Nevada holding.

397
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,010
The night is still young.

398
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,481
Shall we sit down? We have a lotto discuss.

399
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,891
- Thank you.
- As you said, the night is young.

400
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,284
But I don't like to talk business
until at least the entree.

401
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,408
Maybe the DJ got confused
and thinks he's at a rave.

402
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,166
I think my ears are bleeding.

403
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,368
Excuse me? I'm sorry.

404
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,887
You're fired.

405
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,089
- What about the rest of the night?
- I think my Spotify playlist...

406
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,766
...is a better option than you right now.
Whatever.

407
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,765
You need some help?

408
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,048
I thought the night couldn't get any worse.

409
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,568
Thought I'd swing by,
see what kind of train wreck this would be.

410
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,087
Did I say train wreck? Because this is...

411
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,768
You know, I'm glad you're
enjoying yourself.

412
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,321
Yeah, think I'm the only one.

413
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,644
Yeah, I just remembered. I own a bar.

414
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,284
Half the gate and guaranteed gigs
four times a week.

415
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,966
- Two times a week.
- Three.

416
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,443
Fine, just get these people dancing.

417
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,647
Obviously the progeneration of certain
minerals can't be accounted for...

418
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,404
...by simple elemental cohesion.

419
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,485
I am so sorry.
I had to help a coworker with a thing.

420
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,406
- I had to have them take the steak knives away.
- I'm sorry.

421
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:54,168
Mr. Gardner, did Ray get to tell you about his
plans for your mineral deposits in Nevada?

422
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,722
No, Ms. Smoak. As I mentioned,
I'm not interested in selling.

423
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,526
Please, call me Felicity.

424
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,604
And I don't blame you
for not wanting to sell Ray your mine.

425
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,527
Because you don't know what his plans are.

426
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,241
I mean, the thing about Ray is
he's not a businessman.

427
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,770
Businessmen make deals.

428
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,524
They make money.

429
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,409
What Ray is...

430
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,005
...is something else entirely.

431
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,368
Perhaps you can enlighten us.

432
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,567
He inspires.

433
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,091
Ray isn't interested in making money.

434
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,131
He's interested in
making the world a better place.

435
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,442
So if Ray wants your mine...

436
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,281
...believe me, it's because he's going to
put it to the kind of use...

437
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,124
...that's gonna make you proud.

438
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,083
- Yeah.
- I spoke with Felicity-

439
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,527
I got her to remote-access that laptop.

440
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,967
The last thing Cutter was looking at
was a map.

441
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,044
And, Oliver, Verdant was marked on it.

442
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,483
Felicity also retrieved
Cutter's phone signal from the laptop.

443
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,087
Patch me through, then get upstairs
and do not take your eyes off of Thea.

444
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,561
- Do you understand?
- Copy that.

445
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,922
Turn down for what

446
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,801
One Cupid's kiss.

447
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,408
Turn down for what

448
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,521
Delicious.

449
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,931
- Hello?
- It's me.

450
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,041
I have to admit, I didn't think a club
would be your kind of scene.

451
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,130
You're always surprising me.

452
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,760
- I'm not there.
- Why don't I believe you?

453
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,369
You wanna meet me? Fine.
I will meet you anywhere but that club.

454
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,204
So you're asking me out?

455
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,169
Where do you wanna meet, Carrie?

456
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,810
I know a place.

457
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,042
Our special spot.

458
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,202
But you listen to me, lover.

459
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,089
I've been burned before.

460
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,890
And if you're playing me...

461
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,249
...I promise you I'll come back here
and kill everyone in this place.

462
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,441
Digg, you there?

463
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,928
And me. "Me" being Felicity.

464
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,168
- What's your 20?
- Subway stop downtown.

465
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,402
Why did Cutter have you meet her there?

466
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,202
Because this is where I saved her.

467
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,926
- Hello, lover.
- I'm not your lover.

468
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,721
Well, maybe not yet.

469
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,805
But after one night with me,
that'll all change, I promise.

470
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,043
Carrie, I'm here to help you
because you're not well.

471
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,489
Don't ever say that again.

472
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,371
You sound like that shrink
that they sent me to.

473
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,567
I spoke to her.

474
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,845
You talked to that psycho.

475
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,607
She just wanted me to
take pills, pills, pills.

476
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,321
She thinks that love is a disease.

477
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,050
But it's not.

478
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,483
Love is the cure.

479
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,041
I am not the man you think I am.

480
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,529
You're a hero.

481
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,881
You saved me.

482
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,650
I understand that you're hurting...

483
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,603
...and I know what it's like
to want someone...

484
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,881
...but not be able to be with them.

485
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,487
How you wish things could be different,
but they can't.

486
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,802
I can't be with you.

487
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,325
I can't be with anyone.

488
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,849
I have to be alone.

489
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,405
No, you don't.

490
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,524
You're a liar.

491
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,009
I don't wanna hurt you.

492
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,685
You already have.

493
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,204
It's over, Carrie.

494
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,962
I guess it's true what they say.

495
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,327
You only hurt the ones you love.

496
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,209
Oliver. Get him back. Oliver.

497
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,325
Sorry.

498
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,881
- But if I can't have you...
- Carrie, think about this.

499
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,522
I didn't want it to end this way.

500
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,771
I guess I don't handle rejection very well.

501
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,160
You don't have to do this.

502
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,286
I do.

503
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,604
But at least this way...

504
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,004
...we can be together for eternity.

505
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,324
Aah!

506
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,610
I knew you loved me.

507
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,724
It's done.

508
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:08,681
Lyla said Cutter's even nuttier than the
last woman they had in the Suicide Squad.

509
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,481
Sure it was a good idea
handing her over to Waller?

510
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,927
Iron Heights isn't right for her.

511
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,411
Least on the Squad
she can make a difference.

512
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,850
Lyla is preparing a late dinner,
if you wanna join.

513
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,322
No, I'm good. Thank you.

514
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,364
Listen, Oliver.

515
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,562
Felicity heard what you said to Cutter.

516
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,881
About being alone.

517
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,001
If her reaction was any indication,
she does not wanna be.

518
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,649
You gotta tell her how you feel
before it's too late.

519
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,884
It's just food for thought.

520
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,887
What do I tell him?

521
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,521
How do I tell my son his father is dead?

522
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,964
Where have you two been?

523
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,886
What's going on?

524
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,764
You're home.

525
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,766
- I was so worried.
- I know. I'm sorry. I should have called.

526
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,287
Waller changed my orders
and brought me in.

527
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,569
We were on lockdown tonight
because three agents got killed.

528
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,530
Gross.

529
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,965
Akio, get over here.

530
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,845
Pretty good gate tonight.

531
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:16,487
- You're never gonna let me forget this, are you?
- You have to admit, I did save your ass.

532
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,486
God, your modesty, it's so refreshing.

533
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,484
You know, you're really cute
when you're sarcastic.

534
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,930
Half the gate, as agreed.

535
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,170
Keep the money.
My grand re-opening gift to you.

536
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,882
I'll see you next week.

537
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,568
Aha. Thought I might find you here.

538
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,451
I'm getting a jump on that
server encryption you asked for.

539
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,207
Trying to, you know,
make up for ruining the deal tonight.

540
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,931
Your definition of ruin
is vastly different from mine.

541
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,205
Gardners are gonna sell.

542
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,011
- That's amazing.
- It's all thanks to you.

543
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,486
L-leh-

544
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,443
But really, I should be thanking you.

545
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,765
I mean, not just for the new job,
but for this amazing, expensive necklace.

546
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,404
You have to take it back, don't you?

547
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,130
- Yeah, I kind of do.
- Yeah.

548
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,046
Here, let me help you.

549
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,689
Mm. Thank you.

550
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,489
You know, Felicity Smoak...

551
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,041
...you're different from
anyone I've ever met.

552
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,721
- Hm.
- You deserve all those things.

553
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,450
And more.

554
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,728
I'm... I'm sorry.

555
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,890
I meant to keep tonight platonic. Uh...

556
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,202
- I should go.
- Ray...?

557
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,770
I'll see you tomorrow.

558
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,564
Okay.

559
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,965
Are you okay?

560
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,245
Not really.

561
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,205
What about you?

562
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,846
Not really.

563
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,645
Come on.

564
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,725
Where are we going?

565
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,848
For something we both need.

566
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,125
Hi.

567
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,088
- I know it's late, but...
- That was the invitation.

568
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,765
Something smells good.

569
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,844
- Thank you. Hi.
- Hi.

570
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,126
- Come on in.
- Hi.

571
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,011
Yup, I sent the notarized transfer
of ownership to Gardner's attorney.

572
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,403
And listen, I wanna get a jump
on the mining operations immediately.

573
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,525
Let me know as soon as the first
of the dwarf star alloy is extracted.

574
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,091
Excellent.

575
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,089
Whoever you are, back off.

576
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:30,366
Sorry to do this to you,
but you have something I need.

577
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,687
See, that's the thing about our work.

578
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:51,208
It always comes back to haunt you.
