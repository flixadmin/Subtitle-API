What happened to the Bureau Creed?

163
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,078
Oh, I could ask the same about you.

164
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,072
Article 27. Hmm?

165
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,516
"A supervisor must never
show favoritism."

166
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,592
You started a book club
with another employee.

167
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,750
Gary.

168
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,116
Mona is being tortured right now.

169
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,638
Neron said he's trying
to protect humans from monsters.

170
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,593
You saw Mona gnaw off my nip!

171
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,796
She did you a favor.

172
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,880
Okay. Um...

173
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:20,236
Maybe we should just reschedule
until after we've read the book.

174
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,796
Oh, Fairy Godmother...

175
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,956
Oh, no.

176
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,236
Wait.

177
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
[chuckles]

178
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,750
[both groaning]

179
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
That book was terrible.

180
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,760
Oh, my head.

181
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,589
That's the spirit.

182
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,992
[Nate] <i>Sara, Ava. Come in.
Where are you guys?</i>

183
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,479
Hey, Nate, can't talk right now.

184
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,434
Are you talking to Nate on comms?

185
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,836
Tell him I say hi.

186
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,794
Gary says hi.

187
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,712
And we're at book club.

188
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,314
[muffled] Move on to Plan B.

189
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,880
What's Plan B?

190
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,600
I only listen for my name.

191
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,639
I assume it's like Plan A
but, you know, with less people.

192
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,197
Well, without the captain and the clone,
the Bureau's a suicide mission.

193
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,556
Mick's right.

194
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,400
We need to sneak into PalmerX.

195
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,517
Do some recon,
find out what Neron's up to.

196
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,919
Now that sounds like a Plan Z.

197
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,639
[people screaming]

198
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
Hey, baby.

199
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,636
Hey.

200
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,473
You looking for a good time, handsome?

201
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,136
I'm always looking
for a good time, love.

202
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,358
But, uh, regrettably,
my time here is limited.

203
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,840
Maybe you can help me.

204
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,038
I'm looking for a broker
in the soul trade,

205
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,554
he goes by the name of Masher.

206
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,400
I might know something.

207
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,793
Well, this here is holy water.

208
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,958
Now, you can use this
to burn the skin off

209
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,554
any demon tosser who messes with you.

210
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,950
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

211
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,710
Masher likes to hang out at
the strip club after trading's done...

212
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
John.

213
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,240
- How do you know my name?
- [car approaching]

214
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Oh, I know who you are.

215
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,469
Half of demonkind
is searching for John Constantine.

216
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,272
- The holy water?
- Oh, this?

217
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,597
No, this is just whiskey, love.

218
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,554
[Gary] Sure, our protagonist
was keeping people hostage,

219
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,271
but that's only because
he never received love as a child.

220
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,316
[yelps]

221
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,390
They don't want you
in their book club, Gary.

222
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,233
Doesn't that make you angry?

223
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,313
Make a wish and they will pay.

224
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,840
You're right.

225
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,000
They don't want
to spend time with Gary Green,

226
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,554
the lowly Time Bureau agent.

227
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,118
But they would love
to spend time with Gary Green,

228
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,110
Captain of the <i>Waverider!</i>

229
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
[tinkling]

230
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,476
[Gideon] Welcome aboard, Captain Green.

231
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,876
[chuckles]

232
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,196
Thanks.

233
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,840
I have no quarrel with you, dear.

234
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,199
You didn't send me to Hell
like John Constantine and the Legends.

235
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,879
Yes, I was in Hell for 327 years.

236
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,640
And what was my crime?

237
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,918
I sprinkled a little magic over Salem,

238
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,357
trying to help a girl
whose mother was accused of witchcraft.

239
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,510
Okay.

240
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,156
Well, you're out now, why help Neron?

241
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,753
Neron rescued me in Hell,

242
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,830
and what can I say,

243
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,319
true love bloomed.

244
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,793
I know what you're thinking,

245
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,678
he's so much older than me.

246
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
[clicks tongue]

247
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,675
Sometimes you have to look past age.

248
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,074
You know, in another life,

249
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,153
I think you and I
could have been friends.

250
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,519
- Toodles.
- Wait, what...

251
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,556
Ray.

252
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,631
Without all of the idiotic tendencies.

253
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
[Nora grunts]

254
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,477
Make a move on me and Mona dies.

255
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,153
Ray is good and strong.
He can fight his way back from Hell.

256
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,039
[chuckles] Who do you think
is having a worse time in Hell?

257
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,600
Ray or your father?

258
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,552
Turns out Daddy Dearest isn't so tough.

259
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,878
I hear Damien Darhk is going
stark raving mad in the pits.

260
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,316
Why am I here?

261
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,757
Well, you and John tried to kill me.
Nearly did.

262
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,034
If the doofus in the skin-suit
I'm wearing hadn't have interrupted,

263
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,600
I'd have been obliterated.

264
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,278
I spent many nights just dreaming
about how I was going to get my revenge.

265
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,396
And then it came to me.

266
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,110
What better punishment
than making you sit front row

267
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,999
to all of the fear and rage
I'm about to unleash on the earth.

268
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,198
All while in the body
of the man you love.

269
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,556
Now...

270
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,720
[reporters clamoring]

271
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,116
Smile for the cameras.

272
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,656
[male reporter] Are monsters real?

273
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,360
[female reporter]
What's tonight all about?

274
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,400
[Ne-Ray] All of your questions
will be answered soon.

275
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,350
[indistinct chatter]

276
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,437
- Oh. Excuse me.
- What's wrong with you?

277
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,136
Well, you know, a room full of people
fearful of magical creatures,

278
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,072
just makes me a little fearful,
all right?

279
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,840
The worst part is,
Ray loves tech events.

280
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,634
Good evening, DC,
and welcome to PalmerX 2019.

281
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,155
[cheering]

282
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,711
Now, you're all probably wondering,

283
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,474
what in the heck is Ray Palmer
doing back in the public eye?

284
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,910
Well, folks,

285
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,596
for the past two years,
I have been hunting magical creatures.

286
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,394
[indistinct chatter]

287
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
Hang with me here.

288
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,752
I've created an exosuit
capable of combating

289
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,230
the most ferocious of their kind.

290
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,549
What a douche.

291
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,869
But I can't do it alone.

292
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,230
I need your help.

293
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,752
I need you to help me
find these creatures.

294
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,072
Creatures that may be hiding
right here, amongst us.

295
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,790
Now, everyone,
take out your smartphones.

296
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,600
Better be Palmer Tech. [chuckles]

297
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,792
I've created a small, simple app
that will change the world.

298
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,077
And I want you all
to download it right now.

299
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,113
The app is called EYES.

300
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,556
Now, on EYES,

301
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,554
you will be able to share real-time,
lifesaving monster sightings.

302
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
Share them.

303
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,473
And I will be there to save you.

304
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Remember,

305
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,437
the power is in
the palm-er of your hands.

306
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,355
You really expect us
to believe monsters exist?

307
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,837
I thought you were
going to offer us proof.

308
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,952
Thank you, Cindy.
You're absolutely right.

309
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,954
Here is your proof.

310
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,436
Now,

311
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,672
this may look like a helpless hipster
who should be working at a bookstore.

312
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,910
But believe me,

313
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,200
she's something
altogether more dangerous.

314
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,475

[indistinct chatter]

317
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,874
- [Constantine] Masher.
- John.

318
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,038
Yeah, all right. Keep your hair on.
No need to tell the whole bloody club.

319
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,016
Oh, buddy, now I know
you're out of your mind.

320
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,120
What are you doing in Hell?

321
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,873
I'm here to save a friend,

322
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,633
his soul belongs to Neron.

323
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,674
Cheers, love. He's paying.

324
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,680
Nobody gets into Neron's soul vault
without his say-so.

325
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,035
Except the triumvirate.

326
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,576
And I have a plan to deal with them.

327
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,360
But first, there's a hunch
I need to confirm.

328
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,639
What's Neron trading at?

329
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,150
He's steady.

330
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,800
But I'll let you in on a little secret,

331
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,474
his stock is about to rise.

332
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,520
I'm talking a massive
soul collection on Earth.

333
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
You know what that means?

334
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,400
Neron is finally making his play
for the throne of Hell.

335
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,873
Oh, cheers, Masher, I can use that.

336
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,236
Be careful, John,

337
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,154
not every demon you sent to Hell
is as forgiving as I am.

338
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,038
Yeah. Don't I know it.

339
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,589
[heavy metal music playing]

340
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,955
You're dead, demon hunter.

341
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,917
I was gonna be a demon proctologist
but the pay wasn't as good.

342
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,320
[grunting]

343
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
Hold him.

344
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,640
Oh!

345
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,669
Oh, Calibraxis.

346
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,080
You're looking good, mate.

347
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
You grow your beard?

348
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,475
John Constantine.

349
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,880
I'm really going to enjoy
watching you breathe your last.

350
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,639
I invoke a parley.

351
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,997
I demand to speak to the triumvirate.

352
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,959
I'm a demon, not a pirate, John.

353
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,993
I thought you understood the rules.

354
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,072
Well, you little maggot...

355
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,556
As long as I'm alive,

356
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,680
then the triumvirate can pass me around
like a little sparrow amongst the cats.

357
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,759
But as soon I die, you dim-witted dick,

358
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,151
then my soul belongs to Neron.

359
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,755
And then the triumvirate lose out
on all the tasty little bits

360
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,600
of torture that they have
got planned for me.

361
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,835
So you have got two choices.

362
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,320
You can either kill me

363
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,120
and royally piss off
the old bags that run this place.

364
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,352
Or take me to speak
with the triumvirate.

365
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,160
[grunts]

366
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,440
I'm detecting a fugitive alert...
[chuckles] Stop it.

367
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,199
At the Inquisition, Captain Green.

368
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,192
Oh. I don't do torture.

369
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,716
He could have fooled me.

370
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,280
- Hey. Play nice.
- [Gideon laughing]

371
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,837
We have to distract Gary
while the B team is plan B-ing.

372
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,359
Would a fairy at the
<i>Great British Bake Off</i> suit your fancy?

373
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,950
Shall we, uh...

374
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,512
Keep calm and pastry on?

375
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,712
[laughs] I'll plot a course, Captain.

376
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
Get it?

377
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,390
Keep calm and pastry on?

378
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,835
[fake laughter]

379
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,355
- Good one, Cap. Good one.
- Hilarious.

380
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,272
Thanks, guys. Thanks. Yeah.

381
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,996
Take a good long look at her.

382
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,880
Mona Wu.

383
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,634
You saw her on the street,
you wouldn't think twice.

384
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,576
Come on, Mona.
Don't give him what he wants.

385
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,832
But she has a strange
and violent condition,

386
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,197
brought about when she fell in love
with a repulsive creature.

387
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,957
I feel like a bridge scene
should have more people.

388
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,670
Oh. No, we love
three-people bridge scenes.

389
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,896
Yeah, otherwise we'd just end up
standing around all day.

390
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,360
Oh, that's why Mick's always grumpy.

391
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,080
Come on, Mona,

392
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,398
I promised these fine people a show.

393
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,040
Let's not keep them waiting.

394
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
Shift now.

395
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,516
Or end up dead like Konane.

396

[Gary] That's what we're missing.

The boys!

- No.
- Yeah.

- Nate.

[man] She made him disappear!

[Ne-Ray] Well, well, well.

411
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,390
What do we have here?

412
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,310
More magic in the audience?

413
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,150
She's one of them.

414
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
[Zari] He's right.

415
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
I am.

[man screams]

417
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,996
She's a witch.

418
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,640
Witch. Witch.

419
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,200
[all chanting] Witch. Witch. Witch.

Witch. Witch. Witch. Witch. Witch.

00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,520
Don't worry, folks.

422
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:07,071
The witch won't get far, not as long as
everyone downloads the EYES app.

423
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,840
Share your sightings.

424
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,110
We'll find the witch.

425
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,795
It's only a matter of time.

Sara? You guys okay?

428
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,029
Yeah, we're fine.

429
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,077
As long as we keep placating Gary.

430
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,119
I guess Charlie and Z are our last hope.

431
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,759
Great, we're toast!

432
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,236
Welcome to Hell.

00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,920
Good evening, this is
your captain speaking.

[musical flourish]

435
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,437
- Just...
- What?

436
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,113
We'll be cruising at a high altitude

437
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,715
on our way to save
a bake-off in Britain.

438
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,800
Whoo!

439
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:48,801
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

440
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,394
Gary, is that the Kid Steel costume?

441
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
[Gary] Uh-huh.

442
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,516
You likey?

443
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,559
Why would anyone wish to be a sidekick?

444
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,636
[Mick] Close your legs.

445
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,790
Oh, he's such an idiot.

446
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,200
What?

447
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:01,475
[Agent Sharpe and Sara laugh]

448
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,438
Nothing.
They're just teasing you.

449
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,400
- Oh.
- [Agent Sharpe] You're my Gare-Bear.

450
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,360
We're gonna have so much fun.

451
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,080
Okay.

452
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,913
Hashtag-Eyes-app is trending on Twitter

453
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,471
below Kanye's surprise album
and a cat getting a bath.

454
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,433
Mmm. How many downloads?

455
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,314
Only 2,000, Mr. Palmer.

456
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,591
The news cycle is so fast these days,
it's hard to cut through all the noise.

457
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,674
But a monster attack on the capital
will dominate the headlines for weeks.

458
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
And then what?

459
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,397
More people will download some app?

460
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,509
That's your big plan?

461
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,796
Why, yes it is.

462
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,920
Ah.

463
00:20:40,921 --> 00:20:41,957
My love.

464
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,075
Would you please
escort our guest to a cell?

465
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,834
Let's go, dearie.

466
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,831
Neron didn't say which
containment cell to put you in.

467
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,160
Why are you helping me?

468
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,913
Because you're a fellow witch.

469
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,757
And I think we can help each other.

470
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,750
Mona.

471
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,676
How do you feel?

472
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,435
I've been better.

473
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,238
Remember, I'm just
a "Fairy Godmother" away.

474
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,237
[Zari] Trust me, we'll be safe here.

475
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,629
Where are we?

476
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,554
My childhood home.

477
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,918
I thought you grew up
in a dystopian city, Z.

478
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,320
You had a pool?

479
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,880
In a couple years, A.R.G.U.S. will use
people's growing fear of meta-humans

480
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,280
to seize control.

481
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,160
Of course, it didn't help
that we were Muslim.

482
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,159
We were forced to move
to a ghetto district in 2021.

483
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,239
Humans are so easy to manipulate.

484
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,997
I mean, you just show them
a scary ogre or a dangerous meta,

485
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,434
and they just go barmy.

486
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,435
I haven't even been able
to get into this EYES app yet

487
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,120
because the terms of service
are so long.

488
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,720
No one bothers reading those.

489
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,696
It's a demon app.
I'm gonna read the fine print.

490
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,154
Can't believe it's just us left.

491
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,240
I mean, you and I both knew
from the start

492
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,880
that it was madness to storm the Bureau.

493
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,320
Oh, my God.

494
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,680
What?

495
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
Z?

496
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,839
In New Orleans,

497
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,560
John said Neron needed
more souls to take over Hell.

498
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,840
Here it says

499
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,960
What, you're saying that anyone who
downloads the app is going to Hell?

500
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
Yeah.

501
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,720
Oh, that is mental.

502
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,072
This little fairy was causing quite
the fray around the souffle. [chuckles]

503
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,320
[fake laugh]

504
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,960
I think I know just
the place for you, madam.

505
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,040
I can't take it anymore.

506
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,590
[Mick] I'm gonna kill him.

507
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,354
Hey, Z, Charlie.
Please tell me you have something.

508
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,194
Well, we figured out Neron's app
is a way to collect souls.

509
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,194
- That's crazy.
- [Zari] <i>Yeah.</i>

510
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,159
It gets crazier. To drum up fear
and increase downloads of his app,

511
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,149
we think he may be planning
a monster attack.

512
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,833
Okay. We'll, we'll stall Gary.

513
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,960
But you gotta get every single one of
those monsters out of the Time Bureau.

514
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,160
I was afraid you were going to say that.

515
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,115
Who you talking to, Sara?

516
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,320
What?

517
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,559
[clears throat]
Gary. Baby, Bobby, bubelah...

518
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,715
There's a whole big world of problems.

519
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,231
You know, Neron
and your Fairy Godmother,

520
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,496
they're not really your friends.

521
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,194
But do you know who your friends are?

522
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,510
These guys.

523
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
Huh?

524
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,755
Are you trying to schmooze me?

525
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,990
Feels good, right?

526
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,157
Uh, actually, it feels a little false.

527
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
[Sara] Gary.

528
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,439
You are our friend.

529
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,631
I mean, would we lie
to an Interim Legend?

530
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,199
Ah, you see, that's just it,
because I'm not an Interim Legend.

531
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,432
You just promised me that
to use me as bait.

532
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,816
You know what, Gary.
It's a little hard to feel sorry for you

533
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,240
when you're holding us all hostage.

534
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,640
[Gary] You're not getting it.

535
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,232
This whole time Tabitha's been
trying to use me to hurt you.

536
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,671
All I wished was for us to hang out.

537
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,834
I was trying to protect you.

538
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,113
I get it. I'm not cool.

539
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,594
But I don't deserve
to be treated like a joke.

540
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,070
So now...

541
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,514
Now, the joke's on you.

542
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,240
[whispers] What's he doing?

543
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,799
Oh, Fairy Godmother!

544
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,154
Yes, my pet?

545
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,354
Mick thinks he's a tough guy.

546
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,270
But I think he's a big baby.

547
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,315
[lullaby music playing]

548
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
And Nate,

549
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,952
who's never been bullied
a day in his life.

550
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,240
Welcome to my high school years.

551
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
[gasps]

552
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,076
And Sara and Ava,

553
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,677
the cool girl and the class president.

554
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,793
You know what I want you to do for me?

555
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,440
Dance.

556
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,793
Five, six, seven, eight.

557
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,993
[peppy music playing]

558
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
Faster.

559

[music plays faster]

560
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,554
Gary, stop it.

561
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,556
Faster.

562
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,800
Charlie, I get that you're scared,
but the team is counting on us.

563
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,840
I'm not scared.

564
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:20,537
It's just breaking the monsters out
of the prison is a multiple person job.

565
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,074
You can be multiple people.

566
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,594
Look, Z. Yeah, I can for a second.

567
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,319
And you what? It takes its toll.

568
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,280
I could end up back in prison
or even worse, dead.

569
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,477
When A.R.G.U.S. came for my family,
my brother, Behrad, told me to run.

570
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
And I did.

571
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,673
I've never forgiven myself.

572
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,430
You won't either.

573
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,196
We can't change my family's future,
but we can save their present.

574
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,960
[door opens]

575
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,817
[Nasreen] Zari <i>jaan,</i> make sure you take
your shoes off before you go in.

576
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,840
[young Zari] I know.

577
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:48,841
Charlie?

578
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,196
If I die, I'm gonna
come back and haunt you.

579
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,799
I would love a ghost friend.

580
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
Come on.

581
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,360
Cool.

582
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
[bell tolling]

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,714
Greetings, Satan.

First of the fallen.

585
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,551
It's been a long time, John.

586
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
Belial.

587
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,432
We've been looking forward
to hearing the bunk you're peddling.

588
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,479
And Beelzebub.

589
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,680
Not as popular, but you were
always my personal favorite.

590
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,593
This is a waste of our time.

591
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,656
[Constantine] I take it you've noticed

592
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,798
a certain demon's stock
has been on the rise?

593
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,754
Neron's been doing very well
for himself.

594
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,111
Neron is trying to take control of Hell.

595
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,795
And let me assure you,

596
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,917
his method for collecting souls,

597
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,913
it won't be
to sign on the dotted line in blood.

598
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,235
He's, uh, young,
by your standards at least.

599
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,479
And let's just say,
he means to disrupt the system.

600
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,120
If we interfere with Neron,
we'll look weak.

601
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,760
Well, that's precisely
where I come in, Bubby.

602
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,069
And what do you want in exchange?

603
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,157
Not your own soul, I hope.

604
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,634
I'm here for the soul of Raymond Palmer.

605
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,154
You let us two leave Hell,

606
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,118
and I pledge to you
that I will dedicate

607
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,477
all of my crafty and wicked ways
to thwarting Neron

608
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,199
and securing your reign.

609
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,429
Are you really here for Raymond Palmer?

610
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,680
We thought there was another.

611
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,637
A young girl whose life you destroyed.

612
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,196
[Satan] Astra.

613
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,272
Yeah, well, you know,
I didn't want to be too greedy.

614
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,153
But yeah, I'll take them both.

615
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,716
[Beelzebub] Both of them?

616
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,880
That is greedy.

617
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,351
But if you were to choose...

618
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,796
Well, then that's a different matter.

619
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,840
John!

00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,156

00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,234
John. You're here.

622
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,120
You gotta get me back to Earth.

[breathes heavily]

Please, John, they're hurting me.

Make up your mind, John.

626
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,398
This offer won't last.

Astra.

00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:45,877
It's following me. Make it go away.

Come here. I've got you.

632
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,676
You can't have her!

633

[Minotaur] You can't save her.

I'm sorry.

I choose...

Astra Logue.

641
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,635
Stick to the plan, Charlie.

642
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,435
You mean the plan where I need to
rely on my shoddy shapeshifting

643
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,440
to portal creatures
one by one out of their cells

644
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
and onto the <i>Waverider,</i>

645
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,439
where Gary may or may not
wish them to kingdom come.

646
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,074

I'm so sorry, Gary.

00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,875
I took you for granted.

673
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,358
I never, ever should have
let you do my dry cleaning

674

Gary, when Rip
first recruited the Legends,

679
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,759
he picked the people
that were insignificant to history.

680
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,951
The original losers.

681
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,040
You don't have to be cool
to be a Legend.

682
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,835
And maybe we forgot that
somewhere along the way.

683
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,116
But you're one of us.

684

[Nate] Now, come on, Gary.

685
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,752
Ray and Constantine are both
stuck in Hell and you can help them.

686
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,715
Just use your Fairy Godmother
powers for good.

687
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Save her.

688
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,840
Sadly, my hands are tied.

689
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,237
But if you become
Mona's Fairy Godmother,

690
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,359
she could wish to be healed.

691
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,676
How do I do that?

692
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,515
If another witch takes the wand...

693
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,112
You'll take my curse,

694
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,517
but with it, all of my power.

695

Quick, Mona, make a wish.

Uh, Fairy God Nora.

How I've missed me.

707
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,476
Sadly for you,

708
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,231
when you took on
the wand's power and responsibility,

709
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,551
you also took on its charge.

00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,469
God?

816
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,117
You know better than to thank him.

817
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
Astra?

818
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,550
John is here to take you back to Earth.

819
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,309
You're welcome to go.

820
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,909
Yeah. It's all right, love. It's me.

821
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,070
No.

822
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
Wait.

823
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,790
Hold on.

824
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,069
What do you mean "no"?

825
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,720
Looks like the deal is null and void.

826
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,392
Neron is a thorn in our side, John.

827
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,395
But torturing you

828
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,720
is too much fun.

829
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,230
[young Astra] John?

830
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,076
It's following me.

831
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,920
Make it go away.

832
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,436
Please.

833
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,195
John. Get me out of here.

834
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,274
[breathes heavily]

835
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,229
Astra, love.

836
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,075
This isn't you.

837
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,913
No. Of course it is.

838
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,471
Or would you rather
I stayed that terrified little girl,

839
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,519
crying and waiting
for you to come and rescue me?

840
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,270
I would have been waiting a long time.

841
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,912
I'm so, so sorry, love.

842
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,837
But this place, it's twisted you.

843
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,555
If anything,

844
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,119
it's made me more like you.

845
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,235
Right, John?

846
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,549
You're not like me.

847
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,080
You're not.

848
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,035
You chose wrong.

849
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,799
You should have saved your friend.

850
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,750
[door clanks open]

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,480
[blade clinks]

853
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,630
[chuckles]

- [Calibraxis screaming]
- [blade slices]

855
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,916
Hey! Watch it.

856
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,154
Back off, freak.

857
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,192
It's like a demented Noah's Ark.

858
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,480
[Zari] What about Charlie?

859
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,875
It's my fault. I'm the one that
convinced her to risk everything.

860
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,679
Hey. Don't go down that road.

861
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,757
- We'll do what we always do.
- Yeah?

862
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,913
Forming stupid Beebos?

863
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,280
[snarls]

864
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,399
Hey. Where you going?

865
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,436
Well, after everything,

866
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,800
I just figured you wouldn't
wanna have me around anymore.

867
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,673
It's all hands on deck, Gary.

868
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,999
Yeah. We're gonna need
all our friends to defeat Neron.

869
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,915
Aye, aye.

870
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,476
You all right?

871
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,560
Not really.

872
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,159
I'm glad you and Wicksty are okay.

873
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,030
What happened?

874
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,390
Oh, my God.

875
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,790
[cracking]

876
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,520
Hi.

877
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,394
My name is Zari.

878
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
