1
00:02:48,723 --> 00:02:51,702
- Oh, man.
- Did you see that?

2
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:54,667
Whoo! That was fun.

3
00:02:55,563 --> 00:02:57,265
Oh, my God.

4
00:02:57,273 --> 00:02:59,251
- Yes. Yes.
- Nice, nice, nice.

5
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:00,752
- Aw, sick.
- Worth the wait.

6
00:03:00,777 --> 00:03:02,942
- Oh, babe, you missed out.
- Yes.

7
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:05,652
I wanna get off.

8
00:03:07,116 --> 00:03:09,557
Okay. He doesn't like it.

9
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:18,620
Whoo! Ow!

10
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:23,442
That was intense, man. To feel how that
would be to just crash and burn like that.

11
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:26,362
Maybe for you, but our lives
are actually going somewhere.

12
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:30,032
Where we gotta go is to the roller
coaster, because our pass is for 9:15.

13
00:03:30,056 --> 00:03:32,368
If we miss that
and stand in line for a day...

14
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:34,995
then that's gonna kill me.
All right? Let's go.

15
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:36,956
They're totally gonna dig this, man!

16
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,042
It won't kill us to get
a deep-fried Snickers and a Coke.

17
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:42,545
Before riding Devil's Flight?
That might kill me.

18
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:45,648
No. What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger, man.

19
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:06,443
- I'll take that.
- No. Come on, give me...

20
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:09,697
It's not even mine, Kevin,
it's the yearbook's. Just-Kevin.

21
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:10,960
- Oh!
- Oh, got it.

22
00:04:11,014 --> 00:04:13,534
- Oh, my God. You're such an idiot.
- Hey. Hey!

23
00:04:13,558 --> 00:04:16,120
- Give me the...

24
00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:17,296
Ow!

25
00:04:17,353 --> 00:04:20,244
Um, could you, like, please
delete that one of Stacy?

26
00:04:21,524 --> 00:04:25,629
These are for the yearbook, and I have to
turn them in tomorrow to make a deadline.

27
00:04:25,653 --> 00:04:28,924
And, like, I doubt it if a shot of
Stacy Kobayashi's camel toe...

28
00:04:28,948 --> 00:04:31,457
- is gonna make it in there.
- Whew. Shit, I'd buy two.

29
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:34,013
- Number 38, your order's ready.

30
00:04:34,037 --> 00:04:35,601
That's us.

31
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:38,809
I am so sorry.
Kevin can get so out of control.

32
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:41,729
Let me just say,
he would make me crazy.

33
00:04:41,753 --> 00:04:46,021
I mean, you know, I'm such a control
freak. Like, I couldn't handle that.

34
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:55,034
I'm breaking up with him.
Couple of weeks. After graduation.

35
00:04:55,058 --> 00:04:59,038
I've been wanting to for a while.
But don't tell anybody, okay?

36
00:04:59,062 --> 00:05:00,351
Whoa!

37
00:05:00,396 --> 00:05:03,250
Now, that shot there,
that'll sell some yearbooks.

38
00:05:03,274 --> 00:05:05,802
I love it. I love it.

39
00:05:06,277 --> 00:05:10,090
Oh! Oh, all right,
so I'm a total whore.

40
00:05:10,114 --> 00:05:12,468
- Come on. Go, go, go!
- Ashley, you're winning.

41
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:14,845
- You're totally winning.
- Am I winning?

42
00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:17,222
- Yeah, hurry!
- Okay. Come on, come on, come on!

43
00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:19,036
Check out those booties.

44
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,852
- Am I winning? I don't wanna look away.
- You're winning.

45
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:24,396
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Don't look.

46
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,273
- Oh, my God! Come on!
- Oh, my God!

47
00:05:26,297 --> 00:05:28,462
I'm winning, I'm winning.

48
00:05:30,593 --> 00:05:32,738
- I won!
- I knew you would.

49
00:05:32,762 --> 00:05:35,240
- Oh, my God! Give me my prize.
- Here you go.

50
00:05:35,264 --> 00:05:37,159
- That was awesome, Ashley.
- Good job.

51
00:05:37,183 --> 00:05:39,210
Ashley.

52
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:44,249
Whoo!
How you doing, my brother?

53
00:05:44,273 --> 00:05:47,627
You having a good time?
Huh? All right.

54
00:05:48,277 --> 00:05:51,340
- You like that?
- Yeah.

55
00:05:51,364 --> 00:05:53,300
You know you like it.
Give it up. Give it up.

56
00:05:53,324 --> 00:05:54,839
Whoo-ooh!

57
00:05:54,993 --> 00:05:56,370
Damn!

58
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,753
Excuse me.

59
00:06:05,503 --> 00:06:06,980
You're not a senior.

60
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:10,998
And what are you gonna do about it,
Miss Cutest-Couple, rah, rah?

61
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,183
Mom know you're here?

62
00:06:14,804 --> 00:06:17,199
You are a complete bitch
if you tell her.

63
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:18,946
Proof where you were.

64
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,865
Take a shot of this.

65
00:06:29,152 --> 00:06:31,308
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
That's three.

66
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:39,096
Give me some right here, man.
What you doing? Get the fuck back. Hoo!

67
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,973
My God, I am good. Here we go.

68
00:06:40,997 --> 00:06:43,684
Boy, I'll tell you. Goddamn. Whoo!

69
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,823
Kind sir, step right up!

70
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:50,028
Here we go, baby, 3 for 3.
It's all mine.

71
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:53,356
Here we go. Here we go. Big prize.
Watch out. Come on.

72
00:07:00,391 --> 00:07:04,897
We gonna get that, but do we want that
blue one? That's the one we gonna get.

73
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:21,138
You can run, but you cannot hide.

74
00:07:21,162 --> 00:07:23,057
Yes. Here we are, baby.

75
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:25,225
- Yes!
- Whoo! There it is.

76
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:28,187
- Awesome.
- Here, get a pic of this. Ahh!

77
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:30,789
This is the beginning of the end.

78
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:37,161
Hey, guys, get in line.

79
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:43,077
Let's go on again!

80
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:45,216
What's wrong?

81
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:47,351
Um...

82
00:07:47,355 --> 00:07:49,833
I was having that feeling
like déja vu, you know?

83
00:07:49,857 --> 00:07:53,212
Except for something
that hasn't happened yet.

84
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:55,339
Hey, J. Come on, man, let's go.

85
00:07:55,363 --> 00:07:57,216
- Yeah, yeah, hold on.
- Come on.

86
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,130
Are you weirded out by the ride?

87
00:08:00,618 --> 00:08:02,045
Because, look, I know you.

88
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,850
I think that maybe you're nervous about
this roller coaster because they say...

89
00:08:06,874 --> 00:08:11,605
the real fear with these rides comes
from the feeling of having no control.

90
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:14,775
Everyone imagines weird stuff
when they get scared.

91
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:19,717
But it never turns out to be
what they imagine. Never.

92
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:25,077
- Okay.
- You can run, but you cannot hide.

93
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:26,891
Oh! Where you guys are right now...

94
00:08:26,894 --> 00:08:29,706
if you raise your hands
and just, heh, cup them slightly...

95
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,376
it'll look like you're holding
the devil's balls.

96
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,253
And we'd wanna do that, why?

97
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:36,630
When else you ever gonna
see a dick that big?

98
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:37,943
I'm looking at one right now.

99
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:43,303
- Man, you guys are smoking hot.
- Get out, Frankie.

100
00:08:43,327 --> 00:08:46,765
- Yeah, why are you even here?
- Yeah, you graduated two years ago.

101
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:48,934
I stuck around to monitor
your development.

102
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,811
- Yeah. Good to go?
- Good to go, baby.

103
00:08:50,835 --> 00:08:52,124
- Let's do it.
- Come on.

104
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,322
Well, go.

105
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:57,422
You may never return
from Devil's Flight.

106
00:09:02,346 --> 00:09:06,526
Try not to scream.

107
00:09:08,853 --> 00:09:10,280
It's so fun!

108
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:44,239
You all right? There's nothing
to worry about.

109
00:09:44,263 --> 00:09:46,575
A roller coaster is just
elemental physics.

110
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:49,453
A conversion of potential energy
to kinetic energy.

111
00:09:49,477 --> 00:09:53,165
Yep. Odds are like 1 in 250 million
of dying in a roller coaster.

112
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:55,167
Yeah, yeah. Thanks for that, McKinley.

113
00:09:55,191 --> 00:10:01,249
You're more likely to die driving to an
amusement park than dying at one.

114
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:02,644
Whoo!

115
00:10:10,122 --> 00:10:11,599
<i>Here we go.</i>

116
00:10:18,422 --> 00:10:22,653
You like this?
Won it on The Wacky Ladder.

117
00:10:22,677 --> 00:10:26,114
You know that ladder deal
that wobbles? Took it.

118
00:10:26,138 --> 00:10:29,159
I like this. It's old school.

119
00:10:29,183 --> 00:10:32,037
Frankie Cheeks is old school, ladies.

120
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:36,041
What's that?
Oh, well, it'd be my honor.

121
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:39,002
Ew. Ugh. Let's go.

122
00:10:39,026 --> 00:10:40,590
Hey, baby.

123
00:10:40,611 --> 00:10:42,506
<i>- How many?</i>
- Uh, four.

124
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,050
- Four. Uh, gate one.
- Yeah.

125
00:10:45,074 --> 00:10:46,776
- Yeah. Front car.
- Wait, no.

126
00:10:46,784 --> 00:10:48,887
No, please. I don't wanna be a hassle.

127
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:52,474
I just can't sit in front.
I cannot see the tracks. I'll freak.

128
00:10:52,498 --> 00:10:58,468
Okay, take it easy. Uh, well, Carrie will
sit in the back with you. Right, babe?

129
00:10:59,255 --> 00:11:00,907
Why me? What, because we're girls?

130
00:11:00,923 --> 00:11:04,528
Fuck that. I'm going to Berkeley
and I won't get to do this for a while.

131
00:11:04,552 --> 00:11:07,197
- I'm sitting in the front.
- J... Just go. Okay?

132
00:11:07,221 --> 00:11:09,449
- I'll live.
- You're not sitting by yourself.

133
00:11:09,473 --> 00:11:12,452
You know what? We'll settle this
like real men. How about that? Hm?

134
00:11:12,476 --> 00:11:14,954
- Call it.
- Heads.

135
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:17,703
Shit. Dammit.

136
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:21,169
Fine, what the fuck?
It's the same ride, right?

137
00:11:21,193 --> 00:11:23,033
Go. Go ahead. Bye, babe.

138
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:27,426
Hey, uh, just do me a favor. Keep an eye
on her, okay? She's freaked out.

139
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,630
- Oh. Cool. Yeah. Go on, buddy. No problem.
- All right? Sweet.

140
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:09,468
Here we go. Hey, J! Keep your hands
to yourself, man. I'm serious.

141
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:11,303
You know, payback's a bitch, okay?

142
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:14,681
She might need some comforting
and I'm gonna be there for her.

143
00:12:14,705 --> 00:12:18,352
- Hey, no, no. Get out. Get out.
- Hey, find another cockpit, top gun.

144
00:12:18,376 --> 00:12:22,369
- No. Get...
- Let's just get in the back, okay?

145
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:31,615
Guess who's back.

146
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,203
Ugh.

147
00:12:33,224 --> 00:12:35,114
Hey!

148
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,650
I'll meet you at the end.

149
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:42,362
- Come on, back here.
- All right. Cool.

150
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:47,464
- Hey, how'd you guys get in here?
- What? I'm 55 inches.

151
00:12:47,488 --> 00:12:50,550
- Sure. Come on. You two. Out.
- Oh, man.

152
00:12:50,574 --> 00:12:51,775
Ready?

153
00:12:51,826 --> 00:12:54,028
I told you we wouldn't
get away with it.

154
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,598
- You okay?
- Let's go on the bumper cars.

155
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:59,238
Come on. Here we go.

156
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:03,388
Aw, yeah!

157
00:13:05,297 --> 00:13:06,812
Yeah.

158
00:13:08,092 --> 00:13:10,070
What's up, man? I'm good. Uh.

159
00:13:12,972 --> 00:13:16,965
Dare you to, uh, flash me them sweet
titties when we go through the loop.

160
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:24,096
- All right.

161
00:13:28,696 --> 00:13:31,637
Yo! What, you can't read?

162
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:37,305
Oh, well, can I just put it
in my pocket, man? Is that cool?

163
00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:39,945
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Cool. Thanks, buddy. Sorry.

164
00:13:48,757 --> 00:13:50,096
Oh!

165
00:13:50,134 --> 00:13:52,061
AW, Shit!

166
00:13:55,514 --> 00:13:57,541
Here you go!

167
00:14:07,568 --> 00:14:10,839
Whoo! Win, baby! Yes, baby! Win!

168
00:14:10,863 --> 00:14:12,591
Come on!

169
00:14:12,615 --> 00:14:14,317
Come on. Get hyped.

170
00:14:14,325 --> 00:14:17,137
- The first hill's so high.
- Yeah.

171
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:19,739
Let's go, baby!

172
00:14:20,164 --> 00:14:22,934
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

173
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,197
Whoo!

174
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:26,967
Whoo-hoo!

175
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:28,735
- Let's do this.
- Just win!

176
00:14:28,756 --> 00:14:29,908
Ow!

177
00:14:31,842 --> 00:14:33,957
Whoo!

178
00:14:35,095 --> 00:14:37,073
Aw, yeah!

179
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:01,439
Whoo!

180
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:09,380
Whoo! Shit!

181
00:15:20,849 --> 00:15:24,663
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Here we go.

182
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:27,999
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
- Aah!

183
00:15:28,023 --> 00:15:29,950
Yeah!

184
00:15:51,547 --> 00:15:52,699
Whoo!

185
00:15:57,701 --> 00:15:58,701
Whoo!

186
00:16:11,692 --> 00:16:14,859
Whoo!

187
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:22,554
- Yeah! Show me your titties!
- Fuck off, Frankie!

188
00:16:22,578 --> 00:16:24,368
Oh!

189
00:16:46,685 --> 00:16:48,663
Oh, Shit!

190
00:16:51,982 --> 00:16:55,561
Oh, my God! We're gonna fall off!

191
00:17:30,354 --> 00:17:32,519
Shit!

192
00:17:38,696 --> 00:17:40,260
- Uh!
- Kevin!

193
00:17:41,156 --> 00:17:42,533
No.

194
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,108
No! Ian!

195
00:18:03,971 --> 00:18:05,673
Help!

196
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:12,680
- Aah!
- Erin, hang on!

197
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,504
- Hang on!
- Don't let go!

198
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:17,677
I can't.

199
00:18:24,783 --> 00:18:27,261
- Oh, God!
- Hang on, Wen.

200
00:18:28,412 --> 00:18:31,440
Hang on! Help me rock it!

201
00:18:42,676 --> 00:18:46,030
Almost got it. Gently.

202
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,587
No!

203
00:19:09,787 --> 00:19:13,266
<i>- Yo. What, you can't read?</i>
- I'll just put it in my pocket, okay?

204
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,181
- Yeah.
- Thanks, bro.

205
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:18,229
All right. Let's do this.

206
00:19:18,253 --> 00:19:20,368
- What are you...?
<i>- Here you go!</i>

207
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:24,519
- Yeah! Let's do it, baby! Whoo!
- We have to get off of here.

208
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:27,797
No, don't push the button!
Don't push the button!

209
00:19:27,971 --> 00:19:31,785
- Uh! Let me off! Let me off!
- Wen, Wen! It's all right.

210
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:34,245
- Jesus, it's gonna be...
- No! It's gonna crash!

211
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:38,208
The hydraulics will rupture!
The tracks will collapse! Please!

212
00:19:38,232 --> 00:19:39,747
- What's going on?
- Let me off!

213
00:19:39,775 --> 00:19:41,014
Chick's on something.

214
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:44,698
- Okay, let them out. Just the back.
- Wen. Hey, Wendy!

215
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,642
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

216
00:19:47,699 --> 00:19:52,430
- Relax. Now, what's the matter?
- I saw it. I saw it in my head.

217
00:19:52,454 --> 00:19:54,849
The tracks collapsed.
The roller coaster crashed.

218
00:19:54,873 --> 00:19:58,686
- No, she was just a little upset before.
- Man, can you control that bitch?

219
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,065
<i>"Damn. It's gonna crash.
The hydraulics, the coaster."</i>

220
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:05,860
- She's just trying to get attention.
- You're a real piece of shit, Lewis.

221
00:20:05,884 --> 00:20:07,361
- Fuck you.
- Fuck moi?

222
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:08,822
- No, man, fuck you!
- Don't touch me.

223
00:20:08,846 --> 00:20:10,773
Ow!

224
00:20:12,224 --> 00:20:14,151
You relax! Hey!

225
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:17,246
- Hey, let me out.
- Nobody else gets off this ride!

226
00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:19,073
Dude, let me off!

227
00:20:19,106 --> 00:20:21,584
- So high school.
- Let's out.

228
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:23,711
- Get off of him. Ian.
- Relax!

229
00:20:23,735 --> 00:20:26,589
Where you ladies going?
There's a fight.

230
00:20:26,613 --> 00:20:30,176
Get him out of here!
Hey! Calm down! Relax!

231
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,679
Dude, let me off.
I gotta make sure she's okay.

232
00:20:32,703 --> 00:20:34,630
- Hey, ho, let's go!
- Get out of here!

233
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:46,062
- Let me off!
- Hey, ho, let's go!

234
00:20:48,969 --> 00:20:51,497
- Dude, that's my girlfriend!
- Oh, my God.

235
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,868
Stop it! No! Stop it!

236
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:59,914
Stop it! Please! Please,
the tracks are broken. Stop!

237
00:20:59,938 --> 00:21:01,916
- Stop! Please!
- Hey.

238
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,455
Jason!

239
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:05,185
Hey, just relax, okay?

240
00:21:05,235 --> 00:21:07,755
- Please!
- Ease up, man. She's all right. Okay?

241
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:09,894
- Let her settle down.
- She's going home.

242
00:21:09,907 --> 00:21:12,260
Now listen, what is your
home phone number?

243
00:21:12,284 --> 00:21:15,056
Okay, we can call your mother.
Everything will be taken care of.

244
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:22,883
Jason!

245
00:22:57,764 --> 00:22:59,604
Hey, Wendy.

246
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:01,281
Hey.

247
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:04,768
Wait, Wendy. Hey!

248
00:23:04,855 --> 00:23:07,458
Hey, wait. I need to talk
to you about something.

249
00:23:07,482 --> 00:23:09,234
Just here to pick up my diploma.

250
00:23:09,276 --> 00:23:11,671
- You're not going to graduation?
- No.

251
00:23:11,695 --> 00:23:16,013
Look, you're not the only one
in a fucked-up place, okay?

252
00:23:16,158 --> 00:23:20,263
I just thought it'd be good for you
to be where other people feel the same...

253
00:23:20,287 --> 00:23:21,439
In graduation?

254
00:23:21,496 --> 00:23:23,423
No, thanks, I've had enough funerals.

255
00:23:23,457 --> 00:23:25,268
- Do it for J and Carrie.
- Do what?

256
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:29,022
If you die and there's nothing, then
they're just dead and they don't know.

257
00:23:29,046 --> 00:23:32,775
If they're in heaven with Lincoln and
Gandhi, do they care about graduation?

258
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,153
No. I am alive and I don't care.

259
00:23:35,177 --> 00:23:38,906
As soon as I pull out of that parking
lot I am so out of McKinley.

260
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:42,577
- Without J, what's here for me?
- I'm here. Okay?

261
00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:45,705
I made a promise to J
that I would take care of you.

262
00:23:45,729 --> 00:23:48,791
On the ride for 3 minutes.

263
00:23:48,815 --> 00:23:51,068
You weren't making
the promise for a lifetime.

264
00:23:52,277 --> 00:23:54,756
Kevin, if it wasn't for
you and J being friends...

265
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,098
and me and Carrie being friends,
we wouldn't have even hung out.

266
00:24:01,912 --> 00:24:03,752
We don't even like each other.

267
00:24:12,464 --> 00:24:15,317
Ian McKinley.

268
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:19,030
How pathetic is it that my last name
is the same as my high school?

269
00:24:19,054 --> 00:24:21,949
Julie, look who I got
to sign my yearbook.

270
00:24:21,973 --> 00:24:25,827
- No way. Nice.
- Yeah. Heh.

271
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:34,611
I think we should invite her.

272
00:24:34,653 --> 00:24:36,956
- You think?
- Yeah.

273
00:24:40,283 --> 00:24:42,073
Wen? Um...

274
00:24:42,577 --> 00:24:46,933
So we're ready for graduation tonight,
we're going to the tanning salon.

275
00:24:46,957 --> 00:24:49,602
And we are so totally cool
if you wanna come with.

276
00:24:49,626 --> 00:24:52,980
- Totally.
- And just, like, talk if you want.

277
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,316
Here's my cell.

278
00:24:56,466 --> 00:24:58,994
I already have your number.

279
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:02,306
That was so nice of us.

280
00:25:13,108 --> 00:25:16,087
- You're not alone.
- I appreciate everyone trying to help.

281
00:25:16,111 --> 00:25:19,173
- Okay? I really do.
- No, it's happened before.

282
00:25:19,197 --> 00:25:22,343
Okay? I went online looking
for an explanation about...

283
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:24,637
Wendy, just listen to me, all right.

284
00:25:24,661 --> 00:25:28,474
Okay, look, I went online looking for
an explanation about what happened.

285
00:25:28,498 --> 00:25:31,394
I found out about this high school class
from New York.

286
00:25:31,418 --> 00:25:34,397
Six years ago they went
on a trip to Paris.

287
00:25:34,421 --> 00:25:38,776
When they were boarding, a kid had a vision
that the plane was gonna explode.

288
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,053
Just like you did.

289
00:25:42,053 --> 00:25:46,146
He freaked out and seven
people got off the plane.

290
00:25:48,018 --> 00:25:49,533
Just like us.

291
00:25:51,813 --> 00:25:55,530
On take-off Flight 180 blew up.

292
00:25:56,026 --> 00:25:59,338
Over the next several months,
everyone who got off that plane...

293
00:25:59,362 --> 00:26:01,752
started dying in weird accidents.

294
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,544
They died in the order
they would've on the plane.

295
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:08,931
Unless someone intervened,
then it skipped them.

296
00:26:08,955 --> 00:26:11,533
Fuck you, Kevin.

297
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:14,954
Wait... Wendy. Wendy! Hey!

298
00:26:38,401 --> 00:26:41,255
Uhh... Every time we come here...

299
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,091
I was thinking of going
for 20 minutes in the Muller.

300
00:26:44,115 --> 00:26:47,011
It turned out amazing for the funerals.

301
00:26:47,035 --> 00:26:50,306
That was just two weeks ago,
we're still pretty bronzed.

302
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:53,142
I was just thinking we'd go
for, like, a tune-up.

303
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:56,020
- I wanna make sure we look our best.
- Well, yeah.

304
00:26:56,044 --> 00:27:00,224
For all those kids that died that night
who will never get a graduation.

305
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:04,391
You know what, you're totally right.
I'm sorry.

306
00:27:28,952 --> 00:27:35,142
This is my good-guy-luck bracelet
that Grandma left me in her will.

307
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:36,593
Oh!

308
00:27:36,626 --> 00:27:38,278
Julie?

309
00:27:40,088 --> 00:27:42,066
I need...

310
00:27:44,968 --> 00:27:47,083
I could use some help.

311
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:52,994
I have such guilt over Jason.

312
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:56,046
I should never have let that ride go.

313
00:27:56,146 --> 00:28:00,584
God, I'm usually such a control freak
but I didn't do enough to stop it.

314
00:28:00,608 --> 00:28:04,739
I should've done everything
I could to stop it.

315
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:10,698
And I would give anything
to have a second chance.

316
00:28:13,121 --> 00:28:15,099
But I never can.

317
00:28:19,502 --> 00:28:22,393
I don't want to someday feel
that way about you, Julie.

318
00:28:23,214 --> 00:28:26,205
I mean, I can't talk to Mom and Dad.

319
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:29,559
You're all I have left.

320
00:28:31,681 --> 00:28:35,498
You think when I find a place, maybe
you could come stay for a while?

321
00:28:37,312 --> 00:28:39,702
You know I will.

322
00:28:41,983 --> 00:28:44,098
You...

323
00:28:45,403 --> 00:28:49,634
keep this now and I'll get it
when I come see you.

324
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:54,347
Oh, and, hey,
how about on your end...

325
00:28:54,371 --> 00:28:57,362
can I use the school camera
for graduation tonight?

326
00:28:57,582 --> 00:29:00,610
Yeah. As long as you bring it
back to school on Monday.

327
00:29:01,002 --> 00:29:02,704
Done.

328
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:06,067
Oh, um, actually, the battery
is pretty low so...

329
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:09,028
why don't you go get ready
and I'll recharge it a bit?

330
00:29:09,052 --> 00:29:10,754
Cool.

331
00:29:25,902 --> 00:29:29,173
- In a hurry, Yuri.
- Sorry, cell phone signal is shit in here.

332
00:29:29,197 --> 00:29:32,688
I think tanning beds mess with signal.
I must go outside.

333
00:29:33,493 --> 00:29:35,304
Why don't you just use that phone?

334
00:29:35,328 --> 00:29:38,456
I would, but she talks forever
then my boss gives me shit.

335
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:41,493
Shit. That's her.

336
00:29:43,294 --> 00:29:44,721
You know what, just go outside.

337
00:29:44,754 --> 00:29:47,607
- We can deal with this ourselves.
- Okay.

338
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,618
Hey, no drinks in the room
this time, okay?

339
00:29:53,638 --> 00:29:55,390
Good.

340
00:30:06,734 --> 00:30:07,886
What are you doing?

341
00:30:07,944 --> 00:30:10,422
Nobody's walking in here,
and seeing me naked.

342
00:31:47,961 --> 00:31:50,126
Oh, my God.

343
00:31:59,931 --> 00:32:01,408
Dude, he said no drinks.

344
00:32:01,432 --> 00:32:04,328
If you spill that shit we're gonna
have to clean it up like last time.

345
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,330
Mmm!

346
00:32:06,479 --> 00:32:09,646
Happy, beyotch? Nothing to spill.

347
00:32:10,984 --> 00:32:13,629
Why does Yuri keep it so cold in here?

348
00:32:13,653 --> 00:32:16,215
Maybe it's supposed to be
colder for the machines.

349
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:18,441
Oh, a few degrees won't hurt.

350
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:46,036
Shit. I forgot my iPod.

351
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,624
Sucks, bitch.

352
00:32:47,687 --> 00:32:49,889
They got CDs.

353
00:32:53,192 --> 00:32:56,463
Ew. "Celine"? "Britney"?

354
00:32:56,487 --> 00:32:58,924
Are we the only cool people
that come here or what?

355
00:32:58,948 --> 00:33:01,013
Uh, yeah.

356
00:33:01,993 --> 00:33:04,797
Ugh. Whatever.

357
00:33:20,261 --> 00:33:21,963
Why are you wearing underwear?

358
00:33:21,971 --> 00:33:24,283
Steinmetz says he gets
off on tan lines.

359
00:33:24,307 --> 00:33:26,885
Ugh. All right.

360
00:35:25,483 --> 00:35:27,348
Whoo.

361
00:35:46,699 --> 00:35:48,451
Camera charged?

362
00:35:48,701 --> 00:35:51,680
Oh, um, sorry,
the battery's totally dead.

363
00:35:51,704 --> 00:35:53,544
Camera's not working. Sorry.

364
00:35:57,126 --> 00:35:59,980
Look, Julie, I need e minute. Okay?

365
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:02,257
Like private.

366
00:36:26,364 --> 00:36:28,429
Ugh.

367
00:36:28,699 --> 00:36:31,002
It's way too warm in here now, huh?

368
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:39,223
I fucked up.
I set it too hot in here.

369
00:36:40,419 --> 00:36:42,071
Huh?

370
00:36:54,475 --> 00:36:55,576
Ow! Ah!

371
00:36:58,312 --> 00:37:00,457
- Hello?
- Hey, Ashley, it's Wendy...

372
00:37:00,481 --> 00:37:02,546
Psych. Leave a message.

373
00:37:03,776 --> 00:37:05,253
Hi, Ashley, this is Wendy.

374
00:37:05,444 --> 00:37:08,632
Give me a call when you guys are
done and thanks for the invite.

375
00:37:08,656 --> 00:37:09,757
Someone help!

376
00:37:13,035 --> 00:37:15,237
Sorry I was too late.

377
00:37:45,902 --> 00:37:47,279
Hey, open the door!

378
00:37:56,037 --> 00:37:57,689
Help me!

379
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:18,619
We may feel that our lives
are not our own.

380
00:38:18,643 --> 00:38:22,623
That death controls,
frames our lives.

381
00:38:22,647 --> 00:38:26,376
Our births nothing but death begun.

382
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,994
Yet, whether it is with this
tragic loss of young lives...

383
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:34,092
which we have
suffered much of late...

384
00:38:34,116 --> 00:38:39,034
or with the soft passing
of the elderly in the night...

385
00:38:39,121 --> 00:38:43,894
we are all equal in death's eyes.

386
00:38:43,918 --> 00:38:46,722
"Equal in death's eyes" '?

387
00:38:46,921 --> 00:38:49,691
- All of us? How can you say that?
- Shut up, McKinley.

388
00:38:49,715 --> 00:38:52,486
Dude, think it through.
Charlie Manson made it to 70.

389
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,712
- Osama? Still kicking.
- Let's go.

390
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,324
Pimps, vice presidents walking around.

391
00:38:57,348 --> 00:39:01,620
All the atrocities they've committed,
they're alive and well.

392
00:39:01,644 --> 00:39:05,457
These two girls, who've never
done shit to anybody...

393
00:39:05,481 --> 00:39:07,834
- they don't get to make it to 18?
- Shh!

394
00:39:07,858 --> 00:39:10,436
Where's the fucking equality in that?

395
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,298
- Come on, man.
- What? I can... Fine.

396
00:39:13,322 --> 00:39:17,176
Fine. All right. All right.
I'm fine. All right.

397
00:39:20,037 --> 00:39:23,684
Those of you who would like
to pay a final remembrance...

398
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:27,287
please step forward at this time.

399
00:39:33,384 --> 00:39:36,321
I so feel this is so my fault.

400
00:39:36,345 --> 00:39:38,907
How could it possibly be your fault?

401
00:39:38,931 --> 00:39:41,785
Seeing women as nothing but fun bags.

402
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:49,126
I mean, if I had seen their,
whatever, humanity...

403
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:53,744
they wouldn't have felt the pressure to
look so good. Impress Franklin Cheeks.

404
00:39:54,196 --> 00:39:58,376
Go on diets. Deodorize. Stretch.

405
00:39:58,576 --> 00:40:00,679
Tan.

406
00:40:00,703 --> 00:40:04,182
Don't be down, Frankie. Be proud
of your ability to make everything...

407
00:40:04,206 --> 00:40:06,684
that happens somehow
a story about you.

408
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:13,062
God.

409
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:25,603
Yo, man. These things
really suck, man.

410
00:40:25,811 --> 00:40:27,748
Fucking boring.

411
00:40:27,772 --> 00:40:30,667
Hey, if you ever have
to come to my funeral...

412
00:40:30,691 --> 00:40:35,009
men, bring me a PSP or something.
At least I have something to do then.

413
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,511
- Hello?
- I'm with J.

414
00:41:12,108 --> 00:41:14,861
What are you doing
up here in the nosebleeds?

415
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,006
You know, I could've
gotten you second row.

416
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:21,158
I didn't want to upset
anyone by being there.

417
00:41:22,618 --> 00:41:26,197
And I wondered if maybe
here I could feel J's...

418
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:31,357
spirit or presence or whatever.

419
00:41:32,837 --> 00:41:34,564
But now that I'm here...

420
00:41:34,588 --> 00:41:39,486
If there's anyplace that makes me feel
like there's no life after death...

421
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,575
it's a cemetery.

422
00:41:43,472 --> 00:41:46,363
Yeah, I haven't felt
Carrie's spirit either.

423
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,450
And I've tried.

424
00:41:50,229 --> 00:41:52,294
Real hard. Heh.

425
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,204
I thought maybe
he's been with me since...

426
00:41:59,905 --> 00:42:06,096
That night, before I got on the ride,
Jason said...

427
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,558
God, and it was just to get me
on the ride, he said:

428
00:42:09,582 --> 00:42:14,125
<i>"Your fear is from a sense
of having no control."</i>

429
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,837
And I've felt that fear
since the moment he said it.

430
00:42:18,007 --> 00:42:21,912
Even thought it maybe somehow
caused the hallucination, but...

431
00:42:22,386 --> 00:42:25,448
this fear is more
than just being scared.

432
00:42:25,472 --> 00:42:28,034
It's like a presence.

433
00:42:28,058 --> 00:42:32,326
Like a living thing always with me.

434
00:42:33,606 --> 00:42:37,011
- You think it's J?
- No, I know it's not.

435
00:42:37,818 --> 00:42:41,798
This presence is the opposite
of how J made me feel.

436
00:42:41,822 --> 00:42:46,691
It's cold and terrifying.

437
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:24,461
That's the last photograph
Lincoln posed for.

438
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:28,345
The photographic plate broke,
causing a line that can't be removed...

439
00:43:28,369 --> 00:43:30,209
exactly where he was shot.

440
00:43:32,248 --> 00:43:34,226
Look. See the shadow?

441
00:43:36,001 --> 00:43:38,730
Well, what do these pictures
have to do with us?

442
00:43:38,754 --> 00:43:39,993
Look.

443
00:43:40,464 --> 00:43:44,110
This is one year before the Flight 180
disaster. Look at the road sign!

444
00:43:44,134 --> 00:43:49,157
You came to me because I'm responsible
for putting Flight 180 in your head.

445
00:43:49,181 --> 00:43:51,618
And it did happen,
and it may be occurring here.

446
00:43:51,642 --> 00:43:53,703
But you can't believe every weird thing.

447
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:56,831
- You're desperate for an answer.
- I took these.

448
00:43:56,855 --> 00:43:58,607
That night.

449
00:44:05,864 --> 00:44:07,341
These?

450
00:44:11,245 --> 00:44:12,947
Are these it?

451
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:20,334
Oh, shit.

452
00:44:21,088 --> 00:44:24,079
Oh, shit.

453
00:44:28,345 --> 00:44:30,490
Whoa, whoa, hey. You all right?

454
00:44:30,514 --> 00:44:32,129
I'm feeling a little woozy.

455
00:44:33,642 --> 00:44:36,032
When was the last time you ate?

456
00:44:37,021 --> 00:44:38,536
I don't remember.

457
00:44:39,523 --> 00:44:41,450
All right, come on. I'll drive.

458
00:44:46,113 --> 00:44:50,677
The kids on Flight 180 died in accidents
in the order they would have died...

459
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:55,482
if they'd have stayed on the plane.
Okay? So if this is that, then...

460
00:44:55,622 --> 00:44:57,925
Then Frankie was behind
Ashlyn and Ashley.

461
00:44:59,084 --> 00:45:02,314
When I saw Ashley and Ashlyn's
picture, I felt this instinct.

462
00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:04,316
Like there was a hint in the picture.

463
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:06,818
I called to see if I could
keep them from going.

464
00:45:06,842 --> 00:45:09,154
- What's Frankie's look like?
- Right here.

465
00:45:09,178 --> 00:45:11,894
- You got it?
- Yeah.

466
00:45:14,808 --> 00:45:16,735
- Watch out!
- Hey!

467
00:45:16,769 --> 00:45:19,022
- Hey! Are you crazy?
- Sorry!

468
00:45:22,649 --> 00:45:24,489
All right, let's just eat there.

469
00:45:24,526 --> 00:45:27,005
And drive through.
I don't want anyone hearing.

470
00:45:27,029 --> 00:45:31,072
Well, it's nice to see things haven't
made you less of a control freak.

471
00:45:38,457 --> 00:45:40,268
- You got it?
- Yeah, all right.

472
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:42,937
- Here's Frank's picture.
- All right.

473
00:45:42,961 --> 00:45:45,106
This is obvious,
he's falling off a ladder.

474
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:48,484
A rope ladder, though.
Maybe he might hang.

475
00:45:49,051 --> 00:45:50,753
Or maybe it's not that literal.

476
00:45:50,761 --> 00:45:53,031
Could there be anything
in these prizes?

477
00:45:53,055 --> 00:45:56,046
What? Like he's gonna get crushed
by a giant SpongeBob?

478
00:45:56,934 --> 00:45:59,324
Hey, SpongeBob lives underwater.

479
00:46:00,646 --> 00:46:02,298
It's so sad that you know that.

480
00:46:03,273 --> 00:46:06,378
He won that tacky mudflap girl chain
on this game, though.

481
00:46:06,402 --> 00:46:09,089
Aren't those usually on
those big 18-Wheelers?

482
00:46:09,113 --> 00:46:11,966
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I don't see it in this picture anywhere.

483
00:46:14,201 --> 00:46:16,403
All right. God.

484
00:46:19,706 --> 00:46:21,546
All right.

485
00:46:24,461 --> 00:46:27,866
- Uh, can I take your order?
- Yeah. What do you want?

486
00:46:32,594 --> 00:46:34,109
Wen, you okay?

487
00:46:42,312 --> 00:46:44,977
Please tell me there's a short
in your wiring.

488
00:46:47,276 --> 00:46:50,213
Whoa. Hey, that guy's way too close
to my truck.

489
00:46:50,237 --> 00:46:52,465
You're too fucking close, man!
Pull up!

490
00:46:52,489 --> 00:46:54,004
Hey!

491
00:46:59,663 --> 00:47:01,415
Stop! Aah!

492
00:47:08,505 --> 00:47:10,567
- Get out! Get out!
- What? What?

493
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,243
Behind us!

494
00:47:12,301 --> 00:47:13,700
There's no one in that truck!

495
00:47:15,471 --> 00:47:18,224
Shit! Hey, pull up, man!
Come on! Pull up!

496
00:47:21,894 --> 00:47:25,574
- Uh! Shit!
- Back up! Back up!

497
00:47:32,112 --> 00:47:34,893
Watch your eyes! Watch your eyes!
Come here!

498
00:47:37,784 --> 00:47:38,936
Come on.

499
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,815
Come on, let's go!
Come on, come on, come on!

500
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:39,702
We're all done here. You need a ride?

501
00:48:39,805 --> 00:48:45,412
Um, we can walk to my house and then
I'll give you a ride to yours.

502
00:48:46,061 --> 00:48:47,951
No, thanks, we'll be okay.

503
00:48:52,276 --> 00:48:54,066
Will We?

504
00:48:55,696 --> 00:48:57,173
Yeah, we'll be all right.

505
00:48:57,698 --> 00:49:01,678
I mean, how Frank...

506
00:49:01,702 --> 00:49:05,098
God, it's not only horrible,
but can you feel...?

507
00:49:05,122 --> 00:49:07,012
Can you feel how vicious it was?

508
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,894
Easy. Okay? Easy.

509
00:49:11,962 --> 00:49:13,664
Let's just...

510
00:49:13,672 --> 00:49:15,925
Let's just take a step back.

511
00:49:16,758 --> 00:49:20,280
He was behind Ashley and Ashlyn,
but there was no ladder here.

512
00:49:20,304 --> 00:49:23,825
You know? There was no rope.
Nothing in that picture pointed to this.

513
00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:25,952
We were wrong about the photos.

514
00:49:25,976 --> 00:49:28,788
I should have left town.
It's better not knowing.

515
00:49:28,812 --> 00:49:31,499
No, it's never better staying ignorant.

516
00:49:31,523 --> 00:49:33,776
Willful ignorance
is surrendering control.

517
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:38,778
What, did you read that somewhere
in Mrs. Brooks' English class?

518
00:49:40,032 --> 00:49:42,135
No. I... You know, I'm not...

519
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:45,150
I'm not the total idiot
you think I am.

520
00:49:46,246 --> 00:49:48,448
Okay, that's Lewis after Frank...

521
00:49:48,457 --> 00:49:50,435
then Ian and Erin.

522
00:49:50,459 --> 00:49:53,688
There's a couple of kids behind them,
but I can't make them out.

523
00:49:53,712 --> 00:49:55,414
- Can you?
- No.

524
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:01,696
You know what? We'll ask Lewis,
Ian, and Erin if they remember, okay?

525
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,262
Are there any more pictures
from the roller coaster?

526
00:50:17,944 --> 00:50:23,217
I guess that kind of thing is gonna
happen to us the rest of our lives.

527
00:50:23,241 --> 00:50:25,031
Yeah.

528
00:50:26,411 --> 00:50:28,476
You know, I was gonna...

529
00:50:28,914 --> 00:50:30,804
I was gonna ask her to marry me.

530
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:34,691
Right after graduation.

531
00:50:48,809 --> 00:50:50,424
Oh.

532
00:50:56,274 --> 00:50:59,353
No, wait. Look, behind Stacy.

533
00:51:00,153 --> 00:51:02,218
That's Frank.

534
00:51:02,447 --> 00:51:04,199
This picture shows how he died.

535
00:51:09,204 --> 00:51:11,645
All right, go back to Lewis.

536
00:51:13,542 --> 00:51:15,019
Okay, he's got that hammer.

537
00:51:15,085 --> 00:51:19,732
And the weight looks like
it's coming down on his head.

538
00:51:19,756 --> 00:51:23,945
Check this out. Lewis is down at State
for football training camp.

539
00:51:23,969 --> 00:51:26,197
State's team is called the Sultans.

540
00:51:26,221 --> 00:51:28,061
That's it. That's the clue.

541
00:51:28,098 --> 00:51:31,314
We have to tell him.
Show him these pictures.

542
00:51:35,188 --> 00:51:37,115
Wouldn't you want to know?

543
00:51:37,941 --> 00:51:42,584
- What, there's pictures of us in there?
- Yeah. Yeah, of course.

544
00:51:43,905 --> 00:51:47,051
No. No, I don't want to see mine. No.

545
00:51:47,075 --> 00:51:51,168
- What about willful ignorance?
- Well, I'm full of shit, all right?

546
00:51:51,204 --> 00:51:55,159
I mean, I never thought I could
see my own death before it happened.

547
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:57,520
No, you know what?
We can tell Lewis, but...

548
00:51:57,544 --> 00:52:00,773
Seriously, if there's any way
to beat this thing...

549
00:52:00,797 --> 00:52:03,860
I gotta stay focused.
If I look, all I'm gonna do is obsess.

550
00:52:03,884 --> 00:52:06,825
So you know what?
No, I don't want to see it.

551
00:52:08,764 --> 00:52:10,691
I mean, unless we have to.

552
00:52:11,516 --> 00:52:14,544
You mean until we have to.

553
00:52:20,442 --> 00:52:22,006
One more thing.

554
00:52:22,444 --> 00:52:24,008
IS it bad?

555
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:27,475
I mean, is it, like,
painful or embarrassing?

556
00:52:27,699 --> 00:52:31,692
- There's nothing up my ass or anything?
- I'll see you tomorrow.

557
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:38,644
- You on crack. Both of you.
- Just listen.

558
00:52:38,668 --> 00:52:41,481
Ashley and Ashlyn were first,
then Frankie, then you.

559
00:52:41,505 --> 00:52:42,982
- This is...
- Aw, come on, Kevin.

560
00:52:43,006 --> 00:52:46,527
McKinley and Erin were next and
there were two people in front of us.

561
00:52:46,551 --> 00:52:48,404
- Remember who?
- No, and I don't care.

562
00:52:48,428 --> 00:52:51,908
You shouldn't care either.
What you're telling me is bullshit.

563
00:52:51,932 --> 00:52:55,453
- Listen, Lewis.
- Kevin, it's like those stories.

564
00:52:55,477 --> 00:52:59,056
Like, this guy was killed
by a car he stole 10 years ago.

565
00:52:59,397 --> 00:53:02,835
Two sisters were killed when
driving to go visit each other.

566
00:53:02,859 --> 00:53:04,886
You know, shit like that, man.

567
00:53:04,903 --> 00:53:06,930
<i>- Fuck the Bruins!
- Oh, yeah!</i>

568
00:53:06,947 --> 00:53:08,424
<i>- Yeah!
- Fuck the Bruins!</i>

569
00:53:08,448 --> 00:53:11,715
<i>- Faggots!
- Fuck the Bruins!</i>

570
00:53:15,705 --> 00:53:18,226
You're reading into this shit
like urban legends.

571
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,311
Three people have died, Lewis.

572
00:53:20,335 --> 00:53:24,023
If you think this can be written off
as a coincidence and it ends there...

573
00:53:24,047 --> 00:53:25,858
you're in serious denial.

574
00:53:25,882 --> 00:53:28,361
- Uh. What about you two, huh?
- What?

575
00:53:28,385 --> 00:53:31,572
You both lost people real close to you
in a fucked-up way.

576
00:53:31,596 --> 00:53:35,589
In order to feel less guilty or whatever,
seeing signs and patterns, man.

577
00:53:36,226 --> 00:53:41,595
I don't blame you, but it's wrong, dog.
Uh! It's wrong.

578
00:53:43,066 --> 00:53:44,993
That's denial.

579
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:46,666
Uh!

580
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:50,023
<i>- Uh!
- You got it!</i>

581
00:53:50,115 --> 00:53:52,552
What about what happened
at the roller coaster? Huh?

582
00:53:52,576 --> 00:53:54,366
- Wendy saw it.
- She got a hunch.

583
00:53:54,411 --> 00:53:56,430
Fucking intense, but she got a hunch.

584
00:53:56,454 --> 00:53:58,933
I'm here because I get hunches
before every down.

585
00:53:58,957 --> 00:54:00,984
No, you know they're
gonna run or pass.

586
00:54:01,001 --> 00:54:02,565
Hers came to her from nowhere.

587
00:54:02,627 --> 00:54:06,065
- You're here and alive because of her.
- No, I'm alive because of me.

588
00:54:06,089 --> 00:54:07,900
No, listen. You don't get it, man.

589
00:54:07,924 --> 00:54:10,126
- Does that make sense?
- Nothing to get.

590
00:54:10,135 --> 00:54:12,388
- It's bullshit.
- No, just hear me out, all right?

591
00:54:19,978 --> 00:54:21,493
Talk about a vision.

592
00:54:21,521 --> 00:54:25,376
Man, I seen my whole life played out and
it sure as hell ain't gonna end now. Uh!

593
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,877
It's going just as I saw it.

594
00:54:27,277 --> 00:54:29,964
Thirty-five high school games
without an injury.

595
00:54:29,988 --> 00:54:32,174
- USA Today All-American.
- Second team.

596
00:54:32,198 --> 00:54:34,886
- My free ride to the Sultans!
- Bruins passed on you.

597
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:36,637
- Man, fuck the Bruins!
<i>- Fuck them!</i>

598
00:54:36,661 --> 00:54:39,828
- You goddamn right!
<i>- What the fuck is a Bruin anyway?</i>

599
00:54:44,085 --> 00:54:48,178
Four years from now, Lewis Romero
going in the second round to Oakland.

600
00:54:49,716 --> 00:54:51,861
He's gonna romp and stomp.

601
00:54:51,885 --> 00:54:55,823
Fifteen seasons with four
Super Bowl rings on his fingers.

602
00:54:55,847 --> 00:54:58,075
Lewis ain't afraid of no death.
Fuck death!

603
00:54:58,099 --> 00:55:00,036
Death is a fucking Denver fan.

604
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,262
Death wear blue and orange.

605
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:04,385
Real men wear black.

606
00:55:04,481 --> 00:55:06,133
Lewis ain't afraid of no death.

607
00:55:06,399 --> 00:55:08,151
Death is afraid of me!

608
00:55:08,193 --> 00:55:10,120
Death fears me!

609
00:55:10,153 --> 00:55:11,964
- Kevin.
- Because, baby, I just win.

610
00:55:11,988 --> 00:55:13,465
I just win, Kevin.

611
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:17,428
That's all I know how to do.
I just win. Uh!

612
00:55:17,452 --> 00:55:19,597
- Fuck death!
<i>- Fuck the Bruins!</i>

613
00:55:19,621 --> 00:55:20,722
Yeah!

614
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:22,679
Aah!

615
00:55:22,707 --> 00:55:24,409
- Look out!
- Lewis!

616
00:55:26,336 --> 00:55:27,675
<i>Man, that was close.</i>

617
00:55:28,129 --> 00:55:29,781
<i>Did you see that?</i>

618
00:55:30,548 --> 00:55:34,028
Whoo! What did I tell you, Kevin, huh?
Fuck death!

619
00:55:34,052 --> 00:55:36,697
I just win. That's all I know
how to do, Kevin.

620
00:55:36,721 --> 00:55:38,699
Baby, I just win!

621
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,441
- Aah!
- God!

622
00:55:52,028 --> 00:55:54,693
Did I do something...

623
00:55:56,658 --> 00:55:58,498
to bring this on everybody?

624
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:00,612
Don't, Wendy.

625
00:56:01,162 --> 00:56:03,002
But why me?

626
00:56:03,415 --> 00:56:07,019
All those people out there wanting
to have a premonition or see a ghost.

627
00:56:07,043 --> 00:56:08,607
I don't.

628
00:56:11,673 --> 00:56:16,354
I just want it to stop. Just stop.

629
00:56:16,803 --> 00:56:22,223
I don't know why, Wendy,
but you didn't do anything.

630
00:56:22,726 --> 00:56:25,246
All right? This is just...

631
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:27,540
I don't know. I mean,
I wish I knew why.

632
00:56:27,564 --> 00:56:32,845
I wish I could come up with a guess,
even, to make you feel okay, but...

633
00:56:35,613 --> 00:56:37,365
Yeah, I can't.

634
00:56:41,786 --> 00:56:43,764
There's nothing I can do.

635
00:56:48,293 --> 00:56:49,532
Can you drive?

636
00:56:52,005 --> 00:56:53,795
Yeah.

637
00:56:57,969 --> 00:56:59,864
You know, by the way,
that picture of me...

638
00:56:59,888 --> 00:57:01,127
My, uh...

639
00:57:01,181 --> 00:57:04,243
My head's not, like,
through the windshield or anything?

640
00:57:04,267 --> 00:57:08,722
You know, crushed by a steering wheel,
impaled by a gearshift?

641
00:57:11,483 --> 00:57:13,373
Right?

642
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:29,894
<i>Zip, it's Pip.
Have you out those plywood orders yet?</i>

643
00:57:29,918 --> 00:57:31,395
Uh, that's a big no, Pip.

644
00:57:31,419 --> 00:57:34,857
Osama Bin Supervisor wants me to
get rid of these pigeons first.

645
00:57:34,881 --> 00:57:37,685
They keep setting off the alarms.

646
00:57:50,605 --> 00:57:52,908
Hello, babies.

647
00:58:09,999 --> 00:58:13,145
Hey. After I restock this stuff...

648
00:58:13,169 --> 00:58:17,108
these pinhead customers can't manage
to return to the shelves themselves...

649
00:58:17,132 --> 00:58:18,859
we can blow out of here, okay?

650
00:58:18,883 --> 00:58:20,723
Rightio, babe.

651
00:58:25,557 --> 00:58:26,658
Aah!

652
00:58:26,724 --> 00:58:29,453
- Sorry. It's Wendy and Kevin.
- Shit!

653
00:58:29,477 --> 00:58:31,267
You scared the shit out of me!

654
00:58:31,312 --> 00:58:34,116
Yeah, wait until you hear
what we have to tell you.

655
00:58:42,073 --> 00:58:44,927
Zip, it's Pip. Come over here.

656
00:58:44,951 --> 00:58:47,638
You are gonna trip
when you hear this.

657
00:58:47,662 --> 00:58:51,016
Well, paint me intrigued,
Pip, I'm on my way.

658
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,520
So, let me get this.
I OD on nail polish...

659
00:58:54,544 --> 00:58:57,231
and Ian is gonna be
embarrassed to death?

660
00:58:57,255 --> 00:58:59,191
You saw what happened
to Wendy, right?

661
00:58:59,215 --> 00:59:02,757
What's happened to the others?
I mean, you just saw their pictures.

662
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,957
Oh, my God, guys, what's going on?

663
00:59:14,981 --> 00:59:18,560
What's going on?
That's crazy. That's crazy.

664
00:59:21,196 --> 00:59:24,091
We need to know who was
behind you on the roller coaster.

665
00:59:24,115 --> 00:59:27,553
Okay, who was sitting behind
us on the roller coaster?

666
00:59:27,577 --> 00:59:33,350
Oh. Wait. Wasn't it that one guy voted most
likely to become manager at Red Lobster?

667
00:59:33,374 --> 00:59:34,751
You know what? I remember.

668
00:59:34,792 --> 00:59:37,897
There was this guy. Uh, black cloak.
I didn't see his face, but, um...

669
00:59:37,921 --> 00:59:40,191
the ride attendant did
take his sickle...

670
00:59:40,215 --> 00:59:43,611
before the ride started,
if that's helpful in any way.

671
00:59:43,635 --> 00:59:45,863
Do you think we care
if you laugh at us?

672
00:59:45,887 --> 00:59:49,366
This is our lives, okay? What choice
do we have? Just give into it?

673
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:51,243
God. You know what? There is no "it."

674
00:59:51,267 --> 00:59:53,871
Are you guys saying
that death is, like, a person?

675
00:59:53,895 --> 00:59:56,624
No. It's like a force.

676
00:59:56,648 --> 01:00:00,336
Yeah. Well, you know what?
A force is just a force.

677
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,047
It's nothing else.
Just transferred energy.

678
01:00:03,071 --> 01:00:06,258
I mean, it has no goals,
no awareness that it is a force.

679
01:00:06,282 --> 01:00:08,135
But there is awareness, McKinley.

680
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:10,554
In past cases,
if the next in line is saved...

681
01:00:10,578 --> 01:00:12,932
it'd skip that person.
That's why we're here.

682
01:00:12,956 --> 01:00:15,847
Oh, man, what have you been smoking?

683
01:00:21,381 --> 01:00:24,735
- Top shelf.
- Okay.

684
01:00:32,058 --> 01:00:34,636
Kevin. Those banners.
They're in the picture.

685
01:00:36,229 --> 01:00:37,706
Ian, watch those boxes!

686
01:00:42,652 --> 01:00:45,756
What the fuck, man?
You said those boxes were falling.

687
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:49,359
- No, I said watch the boxes.
- What for? They're not doing anything.

688
01:00:49,534 --> 01:00:52,179
We're not gonna apologize
for trying to save you.

689
01:00:52,203 --> 01:00:56,296
You haven't seen or been
through what we have yet.

690
01:00:56,499 --> 01:00:57,700
Yet.

691
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:00,688
Okay, so who's next
in this theory you have, me or Ian?

692
01:01:00,712 --> 01:01:03,274
Well, we know the order
of how we were sitting...

693
01:01:03,298 --> 01:01:06,026
but not how it works with
people who sat together.

694
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:08,779
We don't know if Ashley
or Ashlyn died first.

695
01:01:08,803 --> 01:01:11,419
Hmm. Death is fucking complicated.

696
01:01:12,932 --> 01:01:15,960
No, you know what?
It's not complicated. It's simple.

697
01:01:16,311 --> 01:01:18,872
People die. That's just part of life.

698
01:01:18,896 --> 01:01:21,625
A hundred and fifty thousand people
a day, actually.

699
01:01:21,649 --> 01:01:25,963
You know? I mean, we're biological
entities and death is just...

700
01:01:25,987 --> 01:01:28,424
- Top shelf.
- the end of biological function.

701
01:01:28,448 --> 01:01:30,426
It's as simple as that.

702
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,559
How can you explain
what happened as simple?

703
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:41,603
If Wendy never had the premonition
and none of us got off...

704
01:01:41,627 --> 01:01:44,189
we'd all be dead now.
Does that not make sense?

705
01:01:44,213 --> 01:01:45,865
Oh, yeah.

706
01:01:45,882 --> 01:01:49,069
Kevin, how come when a guy
dies of a plain heart attack...

707
01:01:49,093 --> 01:01:53,824
no one goes, like, "Oh, wow,
he was eating french toast..."

708
01:01:53,848 --> 01:01:55,993
"when Princess Diana died in Paris..."

709
01:01:56,017 --> 01:01:59,121
"and then he saw her funeral
on TV, and now he's dead"?

710
01:01:59,145 --> 01:02:02,916
Know why? Because they'd sound crazy.
So guess how you two sound right now.

711
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:04,141
Crazy.

712
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,504
I'm done. Finish cutting the
orders so we can get out of here.

713
01:02:07,528 --> 01:02:08,955
Okay.

714
01:03:13,428 --> 01:03:14,629
Ugh.

715
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:16,569
Sick.

716
01:03:51,799 --> 01:03:53,694
Okay.

717
01:03:53,718 --> 01:03:55,696
Let's go with what
you guys are saying.

718
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:59,324
Let's just say, you know, that death
does have a conscious plan...

719
01:03:59,348 --> 01:04:01,869
and that it's been set
into motion. Great.

720
01:04:01,893 --> 01:04:03,871
So Newton's third law of motion...

721
01:04:03,895 --> 01:04:06,790
And, look, I'm just guessing
that it goes for death too...

722
01:04:06,814 --> 01:04:08,834
when he's working in our world.

723
01:04:08,858 --> 01:04:12,963
Newton says that every action
has an equal and opposite reaction.

724
01:04:12,987 --> 01:04:20,012
So that means that if death
has taken action, so can we.

725
01:04:20,036 --> 01:04:22,931
And that action we take
might have an opposite reaction...

726
01:04:22,955 --> 01:04:24,683
that thwarts death's intent.

727
01:04:24,707 --> 01:04:27,598
- You're being a fucker, but go on.
- Okay.

728
01:04:27,919 --> 01:04:34,665
Okay. What if, for example,
the last in line...

729
01:04:34,717 --> 01:04:37,521
were to make the utilitarian choice...

730
01:04:38,471 --> 01:04:39,948
Kill themselves.

731
01:04:42,099 --> 01:04:45,953
Wow! Wow! That's pretty much gonna
ruin any plan death's put in motion.

732
01:04:46,062 --> 01:04:51,531
And even better, hey,
it's gonna save five skipped lives.

733
01:04:57,281 --> 01:04:58,845
Any takers?

734
01:05:01,536 --> 01:05:03,977
No, I didn't think so.

735
01:05:13,464 --> 01:05:14,941
There! Those!

736
01:06:13,816 --> 01:06:17,629
I didn't say anything. They were trying
to scare us into saying something...

737
01:06:17,653 --> 01:06:19,464
but they had nothing to keep me.

738
01:06:19,488 --> 01:06:21,925
- What did you tell them?
- Everything.

739
01:06:21,949 --> 01:06:25,554
I didn't do anything. I told them
about the pictures, and Flight 180...

740
01:06:25,578 --> 01:06:28,932
and Frankie and Lewis and why
we went to see Ian and Erin...

741
01:06:28,956 --> 01:06:31,226
- Did they believe you?
- Yeah, right.

742
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:34,479
Would you believe me?
No, they looked at me like I was crazy.

743
01:06:34,503 --> 01:06:37,024
Ten hours they had us in there.

744
01:06:37,048 --> 01:06:40,360
For all we know, whoever
was sitting behind Erin is already dead.

745
01:06:40,384 --> 01:06:42,086
And we're next.

746
01:06:42,094 --> 01:06:43,934
Now.

747
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:50,454
Ian almost died first,
but we intervened.

748
01:06:50,478 --> 01:06:53,832
So it skipped Ian.
That's... That's how we regain control.

749
01:06:53,856 --> 01:06:57,461
If someone intercedes, the life
that was supposed to be next is skipped.

750
01:06:57,485 --> 01:07:01,891
All right, wait, wait, wait. So going by
the way we sat on the roller coaster...

751
01:07:02,365 --> 01:07:05,856
well, I'm next, and then you.

752
01:07:06,661 --> 01:07:08,972
We can beat this.

753
01:07:08,996 --> 01:07:11,800
We're so close. We can't give up.

754
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:15,795
All right, my dad's here.
He's gonna give me a ride back.

755
01:07:16,379 --> 01:07:21,109
- You sure we shouldn't stick together?
- It's just for a couple of hours.

756
01:07:21,133 --> 01:07:24,613
All right? Go back, look at the pictures,
see if there are more clues.

757
01:07:24,637 --> 01:07:31,383
And I'll ask everybody I see if they know
if anyone else got off the ride. Okay?

758
01:07:33,229 --> 01:07:35,670
Was there something
I should know about going?

759
01:07:37,441 --> 01:07:39,461
No, it's just...

760
01:07:39,485 --> 01:07:44,403
I'll just be freaking out every second
hoping you're okay.

761
01:07:44,615 --> 01:07:46,317
Why?

762
01:07:47,368 --> 01:07:49,395
I mean, we don't even like each other.

763
01:07:52,873 --> 01:07:54,988
Come here.

764
01:08:00,047 --> 01:08:03,452
Okay? All right, I got my cell.

765
01:08:22,486 --> 01:08:25,549
Hey, Wen? We're meeting
some guys at that centennial thing...

766
01:08:25,573 --> 01:08:29,566
and I could really use
my good luck bracelet.

767
01:09:30,805 --> 01:09:32,970
<i>Hey, this is Julie. Leave a message.</i>

768
01:09:34,141 --> 01:09:36,031
Call me on my cell right away.

769
01:09:41,398 --> 01:09:42,550
<i>Hello?</i>

770
01:09:42,608 --> 01:09:44,795
Do you remember Julie
being on the coaster?

771
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:48,048
What, your sister? No. No, she would
have said something by now.

772
01:09:48,072 --> 01:09:51,384
The person sitting behind Ian and Erin
was wearing the bracelet...

773
01:09:51,408 --> 01:09:52,972
our grandmother gave her.

774
01:09:52,993 --> 01:09:56,848
Amber or Perry were probably with her,
so they're next.

775
01:09:56,872 --> 01:09:59,392
I gotta find Julie.
She went to the tricentennial.

776
01:09:59,416 --> 01:10:01,478
Well, I'm here now, working security.

777
01:10:01,502 --> 01:10:03,066
I'll start looking for her.

778
01:10:03,087 --> 01:10:05,106
- I'm on my way.
- Wen, wait.

779
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:06,782
Look, after them, we're next.

780
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:10,695
So in case something happens to them
before we meet up...

781
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:14,573
Remember that time we talked about
when to look at our pictures?

782
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,117
It's now.

783
01:10:25,568 --> 01:10:28,380
Great. Mine has no clue.
It's just me...

784
01:10:28,404 --> 01:10:32,859
standing in front of a blank background
with Jason at the amusement park.

785
01:10:33,117 --> 01:10:35,695
Wait. McKinley.

786
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:38,898
Ian? Wait, is he in the picture?

787
01:10:39,415 --> 01:10:42,494
No, but it feels like a clue.

788
01:10:43,919 --> 01:10:47,732
And yours is the picture that I took
when I flashed the camera in your face.

789
01:10:47,756 --> 01:10:51,987
It's all out of focus
and overexposed, like...

790
01:10:57,224 --> 01:10:59,114
Like a firework went off in my face?

791
01:11:55,115 --> 01:11:57,368
The British are coming!
The British are coming!

792
01:11:58,535 --> 01:11:59,774
The British are coming!

793
01:12:00,204 --> 01:12:02,319
<i>Get them while they're hot!</i>

794
01:12:06,293 --> 01:12:08,355
<i>Take it to those redcoats!</i>

795
01:12:08,379 --> 01:12:10,720
<i>Column, advance!</i>

796
01:12:22,726 --> 01:12:24,653
The kite is aloft.

797
01:12:25,896 --> 01:12:29,024
Now, let us hope for some lightning.

798
01:12:29,441 --> 01:12:31,506
Fuck you, Ben Franklin.

799
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:43,678
<i>- But he kept insisting.
- Well, he will be here, right?</i>

800
01:12:45,165 --> 01:12:47,227
<i>This is awesome, dude!</i>

801
01:12:47,251 --> 01:12:50,055
- Heh, heh.
- Whoa, hey!

802
01:12:50,129 --> 01:12:52,315
- Come on!
- Hey, get out of here!

803
01:12:52,339 --> 01:12:54,609
- You're gonna set these off!
<i>- Security, dude.</i>

804
01:12:54,633 --> 01:12:57,437
<i>Come on, come on, man,
let's go! Hurry up!</i>

805
01:12:57,803 --> 01:12:59,418
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

806
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:01,658
<i>to celebrate McKinley's
tricentennial...</i>

807
01:13:01,682 --> 01:13:04,160
<i>the fireworks extravaganza
will begin shortly.</i>

808
01:13:09,523 --> 01:13:11,000
Oh, my God, Julie.

809
01:13:11,025 --> 01:13:14,045
- What?
- Look. There's Kahill.

810
01:13:14,069 --> 01:13:17,048
- Should we?
- I'm sorry, but you can't be here, okay?

811
01:13:17,072 --> 01:13:19,551
The viewing site is over there.
You too. Come on.

812
01:13:19,575 --> 01:13:22,516
<i>They're not gonna make us move.</i>

813
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,873
- Hey, we gotta clear out.
- Mm-hm.

814
01:13:32,296 --> 01:13:33,773
Excuse me.

815
01:13:58,947 --> 01:14:00,424
- Ladies.
<i>- Boys.</i>

816
01:14:00,449 --> 01:14:02,376
What's going on?

817
01:14:02,701 --> 01:14:06,181
Hey, Julie.
You three need to come with me.

818
01:14:06,205 --> 01:14:08,892
- What did we do?
- It's for your own safety, all right?

819
01:14:08,916 --> 01:14:11,532
- I'll tell you as soon as we get away.
- Let go!

820
01:14:12,711 --> 01:14:15,014
- Julie.
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

821
01:14:15,464 --> 01:14:17,166
Julie!

822
01:14:39,071 --> 01:14:40,773
<i>Oh!</i>

823
01:14:46,370 --> 01:14:48,572
<i>- Sweet.</i>

824
01:14:51,125 --> 01:14:53,327
Yeah.

825
01:14:53,877 --> 01:14:55,354
Yeah, that's cool.

826
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:57,898
<i>Light! Light! Go, go, go, man!</i>

827
01:15:02,427 --> 01:15:04,217
Julie!

828
01:15:07,933 --> 01:15:09,548
Uh! Oh!

829
01:15:13,897 --> 01:15:15,461
<i>- Shit!
- Dude, we gotta bail!</i>

830
01:15:34,042 --> 01:15:35,331
<i>Ahh...</i>

831
01:15:35,377 --> 01:15:38,273
Julie! No, wait, wait!

832
01:15:38,297 --> 01:15:40,817
You're in danger.
I'm trying to explain something.

833
01:15:40,841 --> 01:15:43,645
Let me explain this to you.

834
01:15:47,472 --> 01:15:49,312
Julie, look out!

835
01:15:50,184 --> 01:15:52,162
- Aah!
- Uh!

836
01:15:55,439 --> 01:15:57,604
Julie!

837
01:16:02,654 --> 01:16:04,581
Cut him off!

838
01:16:09,286 --> 01:16:11,176
Oh, the horse!

839
01:16:28,805 --> 01:16:30,783
Okay, okay.

840
01:16:32,226 --> 01:16:33,878
Stay back. He's dangerous.

841
01:16:37,314 --> 01:16:39,584
- I got him.
- Just let me go!

842
01:16:39,608 --> 01:16:41,836
No, you have to tell me!
You have to listen!

843
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:44,380
Tell me who was next to you
on the roller coaster!

844
01:16:44,404 --> 01:16:46,106
Julie, are you all right?

845
01:16:47,824 --> 01:16:52,605
Tell me who was next to you
on the roller coaster! Who? She's next!

846
01:17:12,224 --> 01:17:14,251
Kevin.

847
01:17:25,028 --> 01:17:29,071
<i>- Fire!
- Let's get out of here.</i>

848
01:17:31,576 --> 01:17:33,278
<i>You saved my life.</i>

849
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:40,228
- Thanks for that, McKinley.
- Shut up, McKinley!

850
01:17:40,252 --> 01:17:43,147
- No!
- We have to get out of here now!

851
01:17:43,171 --> 01:17:46,985
- What's the deal?
- Ian McKinley, he causes my death.

852
01:17:47,009 --> 01:17:49,570
In my picture I was wearing
the McKinley shirt.

853
01:17:49,594 --> 01:17:50,833
- He's the clue.
- What?

854
01:17:50,887 --> 01:17:54,054
There's a first-aid tent.
There should be security.

855
01:17:55,142 --> 01:17:57,120
Get the fuck out of here, McKinley!

856
01:17:57,144 --> 01:18:01,412
Hey, I'm just celebrating
our town's tricentennial.

857
01:18:04,318 --> 01:18:07,338
- You followed me!
- Oh, you are paranoid.

858
01:18:07,362 --> 01:18:09,424
But, hey, I saw what happened.

859
01:18:09,448 --> 01:18:12,093
You're next, right?
You're the end of it, aren't you?

860
01:18:12,117 --> 01:18:15,513
- Man, I would be paranoid too.
- You didn't even believe me!

861
01:18:15,537 --> 01:18:17,927
Yeah, well, seeing is believing.

862
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:23,904
- Then you have to stay away from me!
- "Have to"? Wow, that's extreme.

863
01:18:28,383 --> 01:18:30,686
Oh, no way.

864
01:18:32,054 --> 01:18:33,806
Do I cause your death?

865
01:18:35,474 --> 01:18:37,401
Just like you caused Erin's?

866
01:18:38,435 --> 01:18:39,636
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

867
01:18:39,686 --> 01:18:43,458
What? Did you have a vision?
Was I in it?

868
01:18:43,482 --> 01:18:45,923
Was I... Was I in a picture?

869
01:18:47,569 --> 01:18:52,675
Just tell me how to start it off!
Let's get this over with!

870
01:18:52,699 --> 01:18:56,804
You'll save me if you just stay away!
Then it'll all be over!

871
01:18:56,828 --> 01:19:02,810
What do I care? It skipped me.
For me, it is over. I'm not dying.

872
01:19:02,834 --> 01:19:04,486
I'm not dying!

873
01:19:17,057 --> 01:19:18,484
You see?

874
01:19:18,517 --> 01:19:21,329
I'm not gonna die! It's you, Wendy!

875
01:19:21,353 --> 01:19:22,780
You're dead!

876
01:20:03,617 --> 01:20:04,743
Thank you.

877
01:20:04,771 --> 01:20:07,959
- I don't know, let's go for anything.
- Thank you very much.

878
01:20:07,983 --> 01:20:10,837
What about that curry place?
Don't we get off at Booth?

879
01:20:10,861 --> 01:20:15,258
- You mean Gupta's. Get off at Oswald.
- Oh, that's right.

880
01:20:15,282 --> 01:20:18,052
You know, if I can't be home
for Thanksgiving...

881
01:20:18,076 --> 01:20:20,847
I need some semblance
of a traditional dinner.

882
01:20:20,871 --> 01:20:23,182
Turkey, stuffing, pie.

883
01:20:23,206 --> 01:20:27,111
If you don't have turkey for one
Thanksgiving is that gonna kill you?

884
01:20:35,427 --> 01:20:38,143
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>
- It's okay.

885
01:21:21,765 --> 01:21:23,517
What's with you and Gupta's'?

886
01:21:41,952 --> 01:21:47,475
This is Booth Street.
Next stop is Oswald. End of the line.

887
01:21:47,499 --> 01:21:52,280
The next stop is the end of the line.

888
01:21:52,921 --> 01:21:55,733
Wendy, next stop after this.

889
01:21:55,757 --> 01:21:58,152
- Let's just walk.
- It's freezing out.

890
01:21:58,176 --> 01:22:00,613
Yeah, but the air will feel good.

891
01:22:00,637 --> 01:22:02,802
I could use some air.

892
01:22:05,058 --> 01:22:06,263
<i>- Yeah!</i>

893
01:22:08,311 --> 01:22:09,788
<i>- Yeah, man!
- All right, man.</i>

894
01:22:09,813 --> 01:22:11,290
- See you.
<i>- Let's go, Bruins!</i>

895
01:22:11,314 --> 01:22:13,617
<i>Bruins, yeah!</i>

896
01:22:28,331 --> 01:22:29,846
<i>Hey, man, peace out.</i>

897
01:22:29,916 --> 01:22:31,393
- Come on.
<i>- Excuse me.</i>

898
01:22:31,459 --> 01:22:33,896
<i>- Watch out.
- Hey, Bruins!</i>

899
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:36,232
<i>You miss the beginning? Did you see?</i>

900
01:22:36,256 --> 01:22:39,277
- This is it!
<i>- Yo, coming through.</i>

901
01:22:39,301 --> 01:22:40,728
Excuse me.

902
01:22:42,804 --> 01:22:45,145
Oh, my God.

903
01:22:45,432 --> 01:22:46,947
I can't believe this.

904
01:22:46,975 --> 01:22:48,765
Here.

905
01:22:51,062 --> 01:22:52,539
Come on, let's go.

906
01:22:52,564 --> 01:22:54,454
Let's go.

907
01:22:55,275 --> 01:22:56,970
I thought you weren't
coming till tonight.

908
01:22:56,994 --> 01:22:59,130
Well, Dad's car just like
dies out of nowhere.

909
01:22:59,154 --> 01:23:01,215
And he couldn't get it fixed any where
on a holiday.

910
01:23:01,239 --> 01:23:04,510
So instead of sitting around for hours,
I looked then caught another train.

911
01:23:04,534 --> 01:23:08,302
- I hope I'm not messing you up or...
- No, it's just, um...

912
01:23:08,538 --> 01:23:12,306
I think I had a sense
that you were coming now.

913
01:23:16,296 --> 01:23:18,411
I was just...

914
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,194
I was feeling like I did that night.

915
01:23:22,802 --> 01:23:25,031
No. No, it's over.

916
01:23:25,055 --> 01:23:27,825
You, me, Kevin went over
a thousand scenarios.

917
01:23:27,849 --> 01:23:31,291
Ian was gonna cause your death,
you intervened and it skipped us.

918
01:23:37,817 --> 01:23:40,338
Look, I'm not worried.

919
01:23:40,362 --> 01:23:43,299
I ran into Kevin at home.
He's not worried.

920
01:23:43,323 --> 01:23:46,886
And if I were you, until something
happens to me and then Kevin...

921
01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:48,888
you've got nothing to worry about.

922
01:23:50,163 --> 01:23:51,915
You're right.

923
01:23:53,792 --> 01:23:55,936
I want you to meet
my roommate and friend.

924
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,800
Yeah.

925
01:23:59,214 --> 01:24:01,879
Hey, guys. This is Julie, my...

926
01:24:12,352 --> 01:24:14,455
What are you doing here?

927
01:24:14,479 --> 01:24:18,751
Wendy! Julie! What are the chances?

928
01:24:18,775 --> 01:24:21,796
- How long have you been on this train?
- Uh, since home.

929
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:26,638
I was heading up to check out the game.
I was gonna look you up afterwards.

930
01:24:27,826 --> 01:24:30,993
You okay? Is something wrong?

931
01:25:08,283 --> 01:25:10,845
Julie, stay down!

932
01:25:10,869 --> 01:25:12,521
Julie!

933
01:25:19,294 --> 01:25:21,459
- Kevin!
- Uh!

934
01:25:23,923 --> 01:25:25,075
Oh, God!

935
01:26:38,206 --> 01:26:40,184
No!

936
01:26:42,627 --> 01:26:45,292
I was gonna look you up
afterwards, but...

937
01:26:46,422 --> 01:26:50,276
You okay? Is something wrong?

938
01:26:51,219 --> 01:26:53,572
The train...

939
01:26:53,596 --> 01:26:55,899
Oh, shit. Not again.

940
01:26:56,516 --> 01:26:58,080
We gotta get out! Come on.

941
01:26:58,101 --> 01:27:01,680
It's not working.
Somebody stop the train!
