1
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,661
Daenerys: When I was a child,

2
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,788
my brother would tell me
a bedtime story...

3
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:06,043
About the man
who murdered our father.

4
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:11,048
Who stabbed him in the back
and cut his throat.

5
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,051
Who sat down on the iron throne
and watched

6
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,678
as his blood poured onto the floor.

7
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,931
He told me other stories as well.

8
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:24,227
About all the things
we would do to that man...

9
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,732
Once we took back the seven kingdoms
and had him in our grasp.

10
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:34,196
Your sister pledged
to send her army north.

11
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,322
She did.

12
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,699
I don't see an army.

13
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:41,328
I see one man, with one hand.

14
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,080
It appears your sister lied to me.

15
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,918
She lied to me as well.

16
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,589
She never had any intention
of sending her army north.

17
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:57,469
She has euron greyjoy's fleet
and 20,000 fresh troops.

18
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,973
The golden company from essos,
bought and paid for.

19
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,975
Even if we defeat the dead,

20
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,179
she'll have more than enough
to destroy the survivors.

21
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:12,025
I promised to fight for the living.
I intend to keep that promise.

22
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,800
- Your grace, I know my brother...
- Like you knew your sister?

23
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,954
He came here alone, knowing full well
how he'd be received.

24
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,249
Why would he do that
if he weren't telling the truth?

25
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,377
Perhaps he trusts his little brother
to defend him,

26
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,754
right up to the moment
he slits my throat.

27
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,841
Sansa: You're right.
We can't trust him.

28
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,885
He attacked my father in the streets.

29
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:42,472
He tried to destroy my house and
my family, the same as he did yours.

30
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,558
Jaime: Do you want me to apologize?

31
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,684
I won't.

32
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,061
We were at war.

33
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,564
Everything I did,
I did for my house and my family.

34
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,732
I'd do it all again.

35
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,110
The things we do for love.

36
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,557
Daenerys: So why have you abandoned
your house and family now?

37
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,124
Jaime: Because this goes
beyond onalty.

38
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,212
This is about survival.

39
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,231
Brienne: You don't know me well,
your grace.

40
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,726
But I know ser Jaime.

41
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,436
He is a man of honor.

42
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,564
I was his captor once.

43
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,150
But when we were both taken prisoner
and the men holding us

44
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,653
tried to force themselves on me,
ser Jaime defended me.

45
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,365
And lost his hand because of it.

46
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:49,623
Without him, my lady,
you would not be alive.

47
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,417
He armed me, armored me,

48
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,378
and sent me to find you
and bring you home

49
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,381
because he'd sworn an oath
to your mother.

50
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,889
You vouch for him?

51
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:09,935
Brienne: I do.

52
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,817
You would fight beside him?

53
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,822
I would.

54
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,119
I trust you with my life.

55
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:33,416
If you trust him with yours,
we should let him stay.

56
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,883
What does the warden of the north
say about it?

57
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,095
(Jon sighs)

58
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,474
We need every man we can get.

59
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,069
- Very well.
- (Inhales sharply)

60
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,258
Thank you, your grace.

61
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,716
Either you knew Cersei was lying
and let me believe othennise,

62
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,134
or you didn't know at all.

63
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,219
Which makes you
either a traitor or a fool.

64
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,555
- I was a fool.
- Not for the first time.

65
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,642
Cersei still sits on the throne.

66
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:17,354
If you can't help me take it back,
I'll find another hand who can.

67
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:26,905
I suspect one of you will be
wearing this before it's all over.

68
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,493
(Men chattering indistinctly)

69
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,162
Man: Coal's coming through.

70
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,748
(Metal clanging)

71
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,965
(Man yells in distance)

72
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,143
(Men grunting)

73
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,275
(Metal hisses)

74
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,028
(Hammer clanging)

75
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,575
(Hissing)

76
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,252
Don't you have something better to do?

77
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,170
You make my weapon yet?

78
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,758
Just as soon as I'm done
making a few thousand of these.

79
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,468
You should make mine first.

80
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,387
And make sure it's stronger than this.

81
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:33,847
(Blade thumps)

82
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,432
It's strong enough.

83
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,647
It's going to be safer
down in the crypt, you know.

84
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,942
Are you going to be
down in the crypt?

85
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,986
- No, but...
- But you're a fighter.

86
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,321
I've done my share.

87
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,908
You've fought them?

88
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,161
I did. Some of them.

89
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,496
How many?

90
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,622
A few.

91
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,333
That was enough.

92
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,713
What are they like?

93
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,757
Bad.

94
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,384
Really bad.

95
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,136
"Really bad"?

96
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,975
Even a Smith's apprentice
can do better than "really bad."

97
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,853
What do they look like?
What do they smell like?

98
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,105
How do they move?
How hard are they to kill?

99
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,774
Look, I know you want to fight.

100
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:29,152
And I know you're not scared
of rapers or murderers or...

101
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,945
This is different. This is...

102
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,406
This is death.

103
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,410
You want to know what they're like?
Death. That's what they're like.

104
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,586
I know death.

105
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,005
(Gendry exhales softly)

106
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,465
He's got many faces.

107
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,887
I look foward to seeing this one.

108
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,057
(Chuckles)

109
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,106
- My weapon?
- I'll get right on it.

110
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,058
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

111
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,897
You weren't sorry then.

112
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,192
You were protecting your family.

113
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,113
I'm not that person anymore.

114
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,491
You still would be, if you hadn't
pushed me out of that window.

115
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,162
And I would still be Brandon stark.

116
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,915
- You're not?
- No.

117
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,792
I'm something else now.

118
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,212
You're not angry at me.

119
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,840
I'm not angry at anyone.

120
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,009
Why didn't you tell them?

121
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,595
You won't be able to help us
in this fight

122
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,221
if I let them murder you first.

123
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,020
What about aftennards?

124
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,106
How do you know
there is an aftennards?

125
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,529
(Men chattering indistinctly)

126
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:41,910
Soldier 1: Next up.

127
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,293
Soldier 2: Put a marker in the ground!

128
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,130
Bring it up to the wall!

129
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,466
Soldier 3:
Up onto the wall. All right.

130
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,229
Soldier 4: All right.
Soldier 3: All right.

131
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,305
Tyrion: Well, here we are.

132
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,848
Yes, here we are.

133
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,391
- Together again.
- (Man hawks)

134
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,478
(Spits)

135
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,855
And the masses rejoice.

136
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,859
How do they feel
about their new queen?

137
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,402
She's your new queen too.

138
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,114
They remember what happened

139
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,533
the last time targaryens
brought dragons north.

140
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,246
They'll come around
once they see Daenerys is different.

141
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,790
And she is? Different?

142
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,250
Tyrion: She is.

143
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,502
- You're sure about her?
- I am.

144
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,254
She didn't seem sure about you.

145
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,339
It's hard to blame her.

146
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,050
I made a mistake
common to clever people.

147
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,970
- I underestimated my opponents.
- Hmm.

148
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,806
Cersei told me the pregnancy
had changed her.

149
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,392
A chance for you both to start again.

150
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,018
And I believed her.

151
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,231
Was she lying about the baby too?

152
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,901
No, that part is real.

153
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,241
She's always been good
at using the truth to tell lies.

154
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,035
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

155
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,662
She's fooled me more than anybody.

156
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,582
What?

157
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,210
She never fooled you.

158
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,879
You always knew
exactly what she was,

159
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,298
and you loved her anyway.

160
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,010
(People chattering indistinctly)

161
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:35,481
We're going to die at winterfell.

162
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,235
Not the death I would've chosen.

163
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:44,282
I always pictured myself
dying in my own bed,

164
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,075
the age of 80,

165
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,410
with a belly full of wine and

166
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,163
- a girl's mouth around my cock.
- A girl's mouth around your cock.

167
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,170
At least Cersei
won't get to murder me.

168
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,341
I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction
denying her that pleasure

169
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,385
while I'm being ripped apart
by dead men.

170
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,429
(People chattering indistinctly)

171
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,349
Maybe after I'm dead...

172
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,728
I'll march down to king's landing
and rip her apart.

173
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,813
Man: You will see
the army of the dead.

174
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,732
(Chattering continues)

175
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,736
- (Men grunting)
- (Swords clanging)

176
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:27,992
Podrick: Good.

177
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,956
(Man grunting)

178
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,255
Podrick: Good.

179
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,594
- (Both grunt)
- Podrick: Good.

180
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,762
Yes, aim.

181
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:51,974
Don't rush.

182
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,101
Come fon/vard.

183
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,813
- Come on.
- Ser Jaime.

184
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,939
Lady brienne.

185
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,196
(Swords clanging)

186
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,865
He's come a long way.

187
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,160
- He's all right.
- Podrick: One more time. Come on.

188
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,372
- Still has a lot to learn.
- I'm sure you'll teach him.

189
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,998
Podrick: Better, better.

190
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,084
I've been told you're commanding
the left flank.

191
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,669
I am.

192
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,422
It's, uh... it's good ground.

193
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,548
It is.

194
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,218
The rise, it should give us
some advantage.

195
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,021
If we can keep a tight formation,
we might be able to beat them back.

196
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,557
(Sighing) Yes, I think you're right.

197
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,976
- What are you doing?
- What?

198
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,770
- I think you know.
- I truly don't.

199
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,856
We have never had a conversation
last this long

200
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,774
without you insulting me. Not once.

201
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:42,942
You want me to insult you?

202
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,193
- No!
- Good.

203
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,119
I came to winterfell because...

204
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,376
I'm not the fighter I used to be.

205
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:06,215
But I'd be honored to serve under
your command, if you'll have me.

206
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,976
I better get back.

207
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,410
(Door opens)

208
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,166
- Jorah: Forgive me, khaleesi.
- (Door closes)

209
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,337
Have you done something to offend me?

210
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,546
Many things.

211
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,882
Long ago and long forgiven.

212
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,509
But you did forgive,

213
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,094
despite my failures.

214
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,975
When I heard you'd named Tyrion
your hand,

215
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,645
it broke my heart.

216
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:05,107
When I named him hand, I didn't
know if I'd ever see you again.

217
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,236
You made the right choice.

218
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,613
I wasn't under the impression
you liked him very much.

219
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,073
I didn't.

220
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,992
His mouth hardly stopped moving
between volantis and meereen.

221
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,036
It was all I could do
not to throw him in the sea.

222
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,621
(Jorah chuckles softly)

223
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,502
But the mind behind all those words...

224
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,673
He's made mistakes.

225
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,216
Serious mistakes.

226
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,261
As have we all.

227
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,347
He owns his

228
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,975
and learns from them.

229
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,104
You're advising me to forgive
the man who stole your position?

230
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:45,815
I am.

231
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,444
And one other suggestion,
if you'll allow me.

232
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,074
Royce: The moment we can get the last
infantryman out onto the field,

233
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,617
we should shut the gates.

234
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,703
Sansa: Keep them open
for as long as you can.

235
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,664
There are still people coming in
from the countryside.

236
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,880
Lady sansa, I was hoping
we could speak alone.

237
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,943
I thought you and iwere
on the verge of agreement before.

238
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,236
About ser Jaime.

239
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:37,825
Brienne has been onal to me, always.

240
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,493
I trust her more than anyone.

241
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,122
I wish I could have
that kind of faith in my advisors.

242
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,667
Tyrion is a good man.

243
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,378
He was never anything but decent
towards me.

244
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:53,341
I didn't ask him to be my hand
simply because he was good.

245
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:58,304
I asked him to be my hand
because he was good, and intelligent

246
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,723
and ruthless when he had to be.

247
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,060
He never should have trusted Cersei.

248
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,146
You never should have either.

249
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,401
I thought he knew his sister.

250
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,030
Families are complicated.

251
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,325
Ours certainly have been.

252
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,621
Sansa: A sad thing to have in common.

253
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,833
We have other things in common.

254
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,960
We've both known what it means
to lead people

255
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,381
who aren't inclined
to accept a woman's rule.

256
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,676
And we've both done a damn good job
of it, from what I can tell.

257
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:43,933
And yet, I can't help but feel
we're at odds with one another.

258
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:46,811
Why is that?

259
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,733
Your brother.

260
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,363
He loves you, you know that.

261
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,241
That bothers you?

262
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,869
Men do stupid things for women.

263
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,996
They're easily manipulated.

264
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,002
All my life, I've known one goal:

265
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,379
The iron throne.

266
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,466
Taking it back from the people
who destroyed my family,

267
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,968
and almost destroyed yours.

268
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,637
My war was against them.

269
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,224
Until I met Jon.

270
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,062
Now I'm here, half a world away,

271
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,606
fighting Jon's war alongside him.

272
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,776
Tell me, who manipulated whom?

273
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,865
(Chuckles softly)

274
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,580
I should have thanked you
the moment you arrived.

275
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,332
That was a mistake.

276
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,254
I'm here because
I love your brother...

277
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,257
And I trust him...

278
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,761
And I know he's true to his word.

279
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,723
He's only the second man in my life
I can say that about.

280
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:08,726
Who was the first?

281
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,519
Someone taller.

282
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,021
(Both chuckle)

283
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,651
And what happens aftennards?

284
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:23,073
We defeat the dead,
we destroy Cersei.

285
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,701
What happens then?

286
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,829
I take the iron throne.

287
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,042
What about the north?

288
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:38,214
It was taken from us,
and we took it back.

289
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,717
And we said we'd never bow
to anyone else again.

290
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,427
What about the north?

291
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,562
Wolkan: Apologies, my lady.
Your grace...

292
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,397
What is it?

293
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,838
Theon: My queen.

294
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,297
Your sister?

295
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,968
She only has a few ships,
and she couldn't sail them here.

296
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:27,012
So she's sailing
to the iron islands instead,

297
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,014
to take them back in your name.

298
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,349
But why aren't you with her?

299
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,525
I want to fight for winterfell,
lady sansa...

300
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,903
If you'll have me.

301
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,757
(People chattering indistinctly)

302
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,060
My lord, we're not soldiers.

303
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,437
You are now.

304
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,485
Look, I made it through
most of my years

305
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,529
without ever getting near a fight,

306
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,698
but then I survived
the battle of the bastards.

307
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,491
Right outside these walls.

308
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:32,786
If I can live through that,
you can live through this.

309
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:37,124
They'll outfit you with weapons
at the forge.

310
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,250
Right that way.

311
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,337
Thank you.

312
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,734
Gilly: When the time comes,
you'll be down in the crypts.

313
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,343
They're the safest place to be.

314
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,053
Through that archway
right over there.

315
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,138
Thank you.

316
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,390
(Indistinct chatter continues)

317
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,310
Woman 1: Hey, hey, who's next, lads?

318
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,895
Woman 2: Thank you, sir.

319
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,273
Teela: Which way should I go?

320
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,988
Which way do you want to go?

321
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:12,576
All the children will be going below
when the time comes.

322
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,663
But both me brothers were soldiers.

323
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,291
I want to fight too.

324
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,923
That's good to hear.

325
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,384
I'm going to be in the crypt
with my son,

326
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,470
and I'd feel a lot better
with you down there to protect us.

327
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,889
I'm sure a lot of people would.

328
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:42,022
All right.
I'll defend the crypt, then.

329
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,368
- (Horn blares)
- Man: Riders coming in!

330
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:16,557
(Grunts)

331
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,395
- (Chuckles) My little crow.
- I thought we'd lost you.

332
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,856
Tormund: Almost.

333
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,104
Man: Put them in the stables.

334
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,534
How did you find each other?

335
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,578
We met up at the last hearth.

336
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,455
The dead got there first.

337
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,918
The umbers?

338
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,920
Fighting for the night king now.

339
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,674
Tormund: We had to travel around them
to get here.

340
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,469
Whoever's not here now

341
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,636
is with them.

342
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,764
How long do we have?

343
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,309
Before the sun comes up tomorrow.

344
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,484
The big woman still here?

345
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,863
Jon: They're coming.

346
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:14,823
Man: Next.

347
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:18,744
Jon: We have dragonglass
and valyrian steel.

348
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,261
- (Man shouts indistinctly)
- (Men grunt)

349
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:25,167
Jon: But there are too many of them.

350
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,586
Far too many.

351
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,546
(Horse neighs)

352
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,507
Our enemy doesn't tire.

353
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,843
Doesn't stop.

354
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:37,554
Doesn't feel.

355
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,059
We can't beat them
in a straight fight.

356
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,560
Jaime: So, what can we do?

357
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,565
The night king made them all.
They follow his command.

358
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:50,734
If he falls...

359
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,238
Getting to him
may be our best chance.

360
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,949
If that's true,
he'll never expose himself.

361
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:58,867
Bran: Yes, he will.

362
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,745
He'll come for me.

363
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,167
He's tried before, many times,
with many three-eyed ravens.

364
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,505
What does he want?

365
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,173
An endless night.

366
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:19,096
He wants to erase this world,
and I am its memory.

367
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,979
Samwell:
Well, that's what death is, isn't it?

368
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,226
Forgetting.

369
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,105
Being forgotten.

370
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,859
If we forget where we've been
and what we've done,

371
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,610
we're not men anymore.

372
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,779
Just animals.

373
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,532
Your memories don't come from books.

374
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,577
Your stories aren't just stories.

375
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,289
If I wanted to erase the world of men,
I'd start with you.

376
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,376
- How will he find you?
- His Mark is on me.

377
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,212
He always knows where I am.

378
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,424
We'll put you in the crypt,
where it's safest.

379
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,967
Bran: No.

380
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,429
We need to lure him into the open
before his army destroys us all.

381
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,598
I'll wait for him in the godswood.

382
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:04,391
Sansa: You want us to use you as bait?

383
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,185
We're not leaving you alone
out there.

384
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,978
He won't be. I'll stay with him.

385
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,564
With the ironborn.

386
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,861
I took this castle from you.

387
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,529
Let me defend you now.

388
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:29,750
We'll hold off the rest of them
for as long as we can.

389
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,461
Tyrion: When the time comes,
ser davos and I will be on the walls,

390
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,504
to give you the signal
to light the trench.

391
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:38,175
Ser davos is perfectly capable
of waving a torch on his own.

392
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,551
You'll be in the crypt.

393
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,263
Your grace, I have fought before,
I can do it again.

394
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:46,016
Alongside the men and women
risking their lives.

395
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,061
There are thousands of them
and only one of you.

396
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,230
You can't fight as well as they can,

397
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:54,024
but you can think
better than any of them.

398
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,235
You're here because of your mind.

399
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:57,945
If we survive, I'll need it.

400
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,034
The dragons should give us
an edge in the field.

401
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,828
If they're in the field,
they're not protecting bran.

402
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:08,997
We need to be near him.

403
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:12,042
Not too near,
or the night king won't come.

404
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,770
But close enough to pursue him
when he does.

405
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,212
Dragonfire will stop him?

406
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,506
I don't know.

407
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,216
No one's ever tried.

408
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,432
We're all going to die.

409
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:32,229
But at least we die together.

410
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,693
Let's get some rest.

411
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,784
(Door opens)

412
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,452
Your grace.

413
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,465
(Door closes)

414
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,594
Tyrion: Do you need help?

415
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,473
You've had a strange journey.

416
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,600
Stranger than most.

417
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:14,396
I'd like to hear about it.

418
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,568
It's a long story.

419
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,653
If only we were trapped
in a castle...

420
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,157
In the middle of winter,
with nowhere to go.

421
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,744
- (People chattering indistinctly)
- (Metal clanging)

422
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,419
(Horses whinnying)

423
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,348
Missandei: Hello.

424
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,296
Grey worm:
When Daenerys takes her throne...

425
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,039
There will be no place for us here.

426
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,793
I am onal to my queen.

427
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,879
I will fight for her
until her enemies are defeated,

428
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:24,633
but when the war is over
and she has won...

429
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:30,514
(Whispers) Do you want to grow old
in this place?

430
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,602
(In normal voice)
Is there nothing else you want to do,

431
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,729
nothing else you want to see?

432
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:40,941
Naath.

433
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,152
I'd like to see the beaches again.

434
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,324
Then I will take you there.

435
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,034
My people are peaceful.

436
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,079
We cannot protect ourselves.

437
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,832
My people are not peaceful.

438
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,292
We will protect you.

439
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,258
(Men grunting rhythmically)

440
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,176
(Men shouting indistinctly)

441
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,769
Have you told her yet?

442
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,526
Samwell: Mmm-hmm.

443
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:26,903
Being careful.

444
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,450
Biding your time.

445
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,495
Waiting for the perfect...

446
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,509
And now our watch begins.

447
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,891
Gilly? Little Sam?

448
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,562
They'll be safe down in the crypt.

449
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,648
If you want to join them...

450
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,155
To protect them.

451
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,050
Everyone seems to forget that I was
the first man to kill a white Walker.

452
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,410
- I've killed thenns.
- Thenn.

453
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,786
I've saved gilly more than once.

454
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,915
I stole a considerable number
of books from the citadel library,

455
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,791
survived the fist of the first men.

456
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,794
You need me out there.

457
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:27,380
Well, if that's what it's come to,
we really are fucked.

458
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:30,175
Well, calling you "fucked"
wouldn't be strictly accurate.

459
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,093
(Samwell and Jon chuckle)

460
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:36,014
Samwell tarly.

461
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,850
Slayer of white walkers.

462
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,435
Lover of ladies.

463
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,606
As if we needed any more signs
the world was ending.

464
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,816
(Sighs)

465
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,610
Think back to where we started.

466
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,491
Us, grenn, pyp.

467
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,827
Now it's just us three.

468
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,540
Last man left, burn the rest of us.

469
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,419
Tyrion: I wish father were here.

470
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,853
I would love to see
the look on his face

471
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:27,899
when he realizes his two sons are
about to die defending winterfell.

472
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,443
(Snorts)

473
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,281
That would be something to see.

474
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:44,040
Tyrion: I remember the first time
we were here,

475
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:45,834
the first time I saw this hall.

476
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,545
- Mmm.
- You were a golden lion.

477
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,631
I was a drunken whoremonger.

478
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,758
It was all so simple.

479
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:57,178
It wasn't so simple.

480
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:01,641
I was sleeping with my sister
and you had one friend in the world

481
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,602
who was sleeping with his sister.

482
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,312
I was speaking in relative terms.

483
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:09,733
- Do you miss it?
- Of course I miss it.

484
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,570
Well, my golden-lion days are done,

485
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,197
but whoremongering
is still an option for you.

486
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,325
(Sighs) It's not.

487
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,203
Things would be easier if it were.

488
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,459
The perils of self-betterment.

489
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:32,797
(Door opens)

490
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,342
- Oh!
- (Door closes)

491
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:36,760
My lady.

492
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,595
Brienne:
Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt.

493
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,438
We were just looking for
somewhere warm to...

494
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:44,517
To contemplate your imminent death.
You've come to the right place.

495
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:47,020
You want some of this piss?
It's not bad.

496
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,447
- It's not good either.
- Thank you, my lord.

497
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,358
I don't think that's wise.

498
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:52,984
The battle might start at any moment.

499
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,739
Half cup.

500
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,077
- And you?
- Brienne: No, thank you.

501
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,495
I should try and get some sleep.

502
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,331
Jaime: You really think any of us
are going to sleep tonight?

503
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:08,958
Join us.

504
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,128
All right.

505
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:13,546
Just a bit.

506
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,739
Davos: Well, what do we have here?

507
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:22,972
Ser davos, join us.

508
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:24,182
No, none for me, thanks.

509
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,767
Came here for this.

510
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:31,189
(Sighs) I figured I could wait to die
freezing my balls off out there

511
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,983
or wait to die nice and warm in here.

512
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,156
It could be our last night
in this world, you know.

513
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,576
Yes, well, I'm glad you're here.

514
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,371
Here fighting with us.

515
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,415
Glad you survived eastwatch.

516
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:49,999
Would you like a drink?

517
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,127
Brought my own.

518
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,302
They call you "king killer."

519
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,180
I'm sure someone does.

520
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,308
They call me "giantsbane."

521
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:09,686
Want to know why?

522
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:23,074
I killed a giant when I was 10.

523
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:28,747
Then I climbed right into bed
with his wife.

524
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,543
When she woke up,
you know what she did?

525
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:41,634
Suckled me at her teat
for three months.

526
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,344
Thought I was her baby.

527
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,473
That's how I got so strong.

528
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,601
Giant's milk.

529
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,646
(Gulping noisily)

530
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,033
Mmm.

531
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,914
- Maybe I will have that drink.
- (Tormund grunts)

532
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,999
(Men yelling in distance)

533
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:38,775
(Arya sighs)

534
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:52,288
You never used to shut up. Now you're
just sitting there like a mute.

535
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:56,960
Guess I've changed.

536
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,720
What are you doing up here?

537
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,764
What's it look like?

538
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,600
No, I mean,
what are you doing up here?

539
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:16,896
You joined the brotherhood.

540
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,774
You went beyond the wall with Jon.
You're here now. Why?

541
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:24,779
When was the last time
you fought for anyone but yourself?

542
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,076
I fought for you, didn't I?

543
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,463
Oh, for fuck's sake.

544
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,215
May as well be at a bloody wedding.

545
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,678
My lady.

546
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,054
It's good to see you again.

547
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,224
I'm sorry we parted the way we did.

548
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,019
Was he on your list?

549
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,271
For a little while.

550
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,648
That's all right.

551
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:05,111
The lord of light
has brought us together all the same.

552
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,574
This is his moment.

553
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,701
- When light...
- Thoros isn't here anymore,

554
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,703
so I hope you're not
about to give a sermon.

555
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,456
Because if you are,

556
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,208
the lord of light's gonna wonder
why he brought you back 19 times

557
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:22,045
just to watch you die when
I Chuck you over this fucking wall.

558
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,338
(Chuckles)

559
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:37,810
Where are you going?

560
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,982
I'm not spending my final hours
with you two miserable old shits.

561
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,366
Hound: Hmm.

562
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,508
Arya: That for me?

563
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,107
This'll work.

564
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,989
Last time you saw me,
you wanted me to come to winterfell.

565
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,658
Mmm. Took the long road, but...

566
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,495
What did the red woman want with you?

567
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,544
She wanted my blood
for some kind of spell.

568
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:47,046
Why your blood?

569
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,299
I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard.

570
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,845
I didn't know until she told me.

571
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,765
She tied me up, stripped me down,
put leeches all over me.

572
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,520
Was that your first time?

573
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,940
No, yeah, I've never had leeches
put all over my cock.

574
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,942
Your first time with a woman.

575
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,068
What?

576
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:12,572
I... I didn't... iwasn't with her.

577
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,532
Were you with other girls before that

578
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,075
- in king's landing?
- (Scoffs)

579
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,201
Or after?

580
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,288
(Stammers indistinctly)

581
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,374
- You don't remember?
- (Scoffs)

582
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,170
- Yes, I was.
- One?

583
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,797
Two?

584
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:32,008
- Twenty?
- Well, I didn't keep count.

585
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,261
Yes, you did.

586
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,512
(Gendry sighs)

587
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,599
Three.

588
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,940
We're probably going to die soon.

589
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:53,613
I want to know what it's like
before that happens.

590
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,329
Arya, I...

591
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,138
(Both moan)

592
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:22,809
(Both breathing heavily)

593
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,105
(Grunts)

594
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,659
I'm not the red woman.

595
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,410
Take your own bloody pants off.

596
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,386
(Wind whistling outside)

597
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,396
It's strange, isn't it?

598
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:14,026
Almost everyone here's fought
the starks

599
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:16,445
at one time or another.

600
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:20,867
And here we are in their castle,
ready to defend it.

601
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,201
Together.

602
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,039
At least we'll die with honor.

603
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,589
I think we might live.

604
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,549
- (Chuckles)
- (Snorts)

605
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,009
(Davos laughs)

606
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,719
I do.

607
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,012
(Davos snorts)

608
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,056
How many battles
have we survived between us?

609
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,684
Ser davos seaworth.

610
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:51,898
Survivor of both the Blackwater
and the battle of the bastards.

611
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:54,275
All without a shred
of combat ability.

612
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,359
Tormund1mmm.

613
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:59,238
Ser Jaime Lannister,
fabled hero of the siege of pyke.

614
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:01,782
Fabled loser
of the battle of whispering wood.

615
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:02,909
Hear, hear!

616
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,912
Ser brienne of tarth.

617
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:07,997
Defeated the hound in...

618
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,375
Pardon me, lady brienne.

619
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,461
Tormund: She's not a ser?

620
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,629
You're not a knight?

621
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,506
Women can't be knights.

622
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,550
- Why not?
- Tradition.

623
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:20,718
Fuck tradition.

624
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:23,930
I don't even want to be a knight.

625
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:29,852
Tormund: I'm no king.

626
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,729
But if I were,

627
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,482
I'd knight you 10 times over.

628
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,152
Jaime: You don't need a king.

629
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,198
Any knight can make another knight.

630
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:48,246
I'll prove it.

631
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,001
Kneel, lady brienne.

632
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:57,588
(Scoffs)

633
00:45:58,339 --> 00:45:59,939
Jaime: Do you want to be
a knight or not?

634
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,305
Kneel.

635
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,027
In the name of the warrior,

636
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,821
I charge you to be brave.

637
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,992
In the name of the father,

638
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,287
I charge you to be just.

639
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:15,875
In the name of the mother,

640
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:19,545
I charge you to defend the innocent.

641
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,806
Arise, brienne of tarth...

642
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,643
A knight of the seven kingdoms.

643
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:47,782
(All clapping)

644
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,704
Tyrion: Ser brienne of tarth!

645
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,957
Knight of the seven kingdoms!

646
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,719
Jorah: We have all we need
to win this war.

647
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,555
Lady mormont: I have trained my men,
women and children.

648
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,474
I have fought before.
I can fight again.

649
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,769
Jorah: Please, listen to me.
You're the future of our house.

650
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,230
Lady mormont: I don't need you
to remind me of that.

651
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,792
Jorah: You'll be safer in the crypt.
These things we're fighting...

652
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,401
I will not hide underground.

653
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:26,821
I pledged to fight for the north,
and I will fight.

654
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,590
Man 1: I'm meant to relieve you.
You got it?

655
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,449
Man 2: Yeah, I got it.

656
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,912
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

657
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:36,080
It's all right.

658
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:38,707
We're done here.

659
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,590
I wish you good fortune, cousin.

660
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:49,885
Thank you, my lady.

661
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:52,972
- My lady.
- Soldier: My lady.

662
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,477
What have you got there?

663
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,522
It's called heartsbane.

664
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,900
It's my family sword.

665
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:06,652
You still have a family.

666
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,573
Yes. And I'd love
to defend them with it.

667
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,452
But I can't really hold it upright.

668
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:20,458
Your father,
he taught me how to be a man.

669
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,210
How to do what's right.

670
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,922
This is right.

671
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,345
It's valyrian steel.

672
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,640
I'd be honored if you'd take it.

673
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:51,822
I'll wield it in his memory...

674
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,037
To guard the realms of men.

675
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:02,917
I'll see you when it's through.

676
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,597
I hope we win.

677
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,692
- We'd better get some rest.
- No, let's stay a bit longer.

678
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:30,069
We're out of wine.

679
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,785
How about a song?

680
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:40,996
One of you must know one.

681
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,833
- Ser davos?
- You'll pray for a quick death.

682
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:46,335
(Chuckles)

683
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,089
Tyrion: Ser brienne?

684
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:58,597
- Mmm-hmm.
- Hmm.

685
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:05,938
(Singing) High in the halls
of the kings who are gone

686
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:11,318
Jenny would dance with her ghosts

687
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:16,991
the ones she had lost
and the ones she had found

688
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:21,120
and the ones
who had loved her the most

689
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:27,835
the ones who'd been gone
for so very long

690
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,214
she couldn't remember their names

691
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:38,762
they spun her around
on the damp old stones

692
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:43,809
spun away all her sorrow and pain

693
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:49,231
and she never wanted to leave

694
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:55,487
never wanted to leave

695
00:51:55,571 --> 00:52:00,534
never wanted to leave

696
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:05,080
never wanted to leave

697
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:11,462
never wanted to leave

698
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:17,468
never wanted to leave

699
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:02,096
Daenerys: Who's that?

700
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,267
Lyanna stark.

701
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:17,111
My brother rhaegar...

702
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:24,243
Everyone told me
he was decent and kind.

703
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,577
He liked to sing.

704
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:28,872
Gave money to poor children.

705
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:33,043
And he raped her.

706
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:36,171
Jon: He didn't.

707
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,218
He loved her.

708
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:50,060
They were married in secret.

709
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:54,356
After rhaegar fell on the trident,
she had a son.

710
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:59,069
Robert would have murdered the baby
if he ever found out,

711
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:00,237
and lyanna knew it.

712
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:03,615
So the last thing she did...

713
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,286
As she bled to death
on her birthing bed

714
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,246
was give the boy to her brother...

715
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:11,915
Ned stark...

716
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,836
To raise as his bastard.

717
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:17,838
(Inhales sharply)

718
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:20,507
My name...

719
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,511
My real name...

720
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,433
Is aegon Targaryen.

721
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,226
(Exhales sharply)

722
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:34,396
- That's impossible.
- I wish it were.

723
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,232
Who told you this?

724
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,318
Bran.

725
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:42,529
- He saw it.
- He saw it?

726
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,364
And samwell confirmed it.

727
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,409
He read about their marriage
at the citadel

728
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,077
without even knowing what it meant.

729
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:52,414
A secret no one in the world knew...

730
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,418
Except your brother
and your best friend.

731
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,087
Doesn't seem strange to you?

732
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,175
It's true, dany.

733
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,136
I know it is.

734
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,143
If it were true,

735
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:17,064
it would make you the last male heir
of house Targaryen.

736
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,112
You'd have a claim to the iron throne.

737
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,909
(Horn blowing)

738
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,875
- Man: Form up!
- (Horses neighing)

739
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,963
Man: Get yourselves back!

740
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:43,465
- (Marching in distance)
- (Horn continues blowing)

741
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:46,528
Woman: (Singing) High in the halls
of the kings who are gone

742
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:51,867
Jenny would dance with her ghosts

743
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,745
the ones she had lost

744
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:59,082
and the ones she had found

745
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:05,172
and the ones
who had loved her the most

746
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:12,888
the ones who'd been gone
for so very long

747
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:18,185
she couldn't remember their names

748
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:24,608
they spun her around
on the damp old stones

749
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:29,780
spun away all her sorrow and pain

750
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:35,786
and she never wanted to leave

751
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:41,541
never wanted to leave

752
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:47,422
never wanted to leave

753
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:52,219
never wanted to leave
