other fugitives.

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,077
- Is that a problem?
- Not for me, love.

102
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,193
Good. Because we are headed
back to the '90s

103
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,192
to infiltrate a place called
Camp Ogawa.

Whoa, sneaking into a military facility,
are we?

Actually,
it's a summer camp for kids.

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,558
Oh, I love summer camp. Everyone used
to call me Kid Counselor.

107
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,776
Bet you took that as a compliment,
too, didn't you, mate?

So, uh, any idea what kind of foul beast
we're up against, then?

112
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,876
- Well, based on... Research.

Sara and I have been doing,

114
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,954
we could be looking for
a swampy monster thing.

115
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,600
[Sara] According to the timeline,

116
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,195
before the end of summer,
several kids went missing,

117
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,670
never to be seen again.

118
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,513
Well, I happen to know a Swamp Thing.

119
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,389
But then again, Maine is
way too far north for that muppet.

120
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,439
Well, we used to use the buddy system
to make sure everyone was safe.

121
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,755
And this is where Nate would say,
"I'm your buddy,"

122
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,480
and we'd do a fist bump
or a silly jig or...

123
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,311
Well, we are shorthanded, so...

124
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,159
I need you to partner up with John.

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,198
Oh, don't worry, dreamboat. I've had
stranger bedfellows than you.

126
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,536
But just so you know, I'm not one

127
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,677
to get all gussied up
for a gig, all right?

128

[indistinct chatter]

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,720
Huh, you may take my coat,
but you will never take...

130
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,234
Nope. And lose the tie.

131
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,113
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

132
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,436
Fine. One time.

133
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,560
But it's only for the kids.

134
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,832
Yeah. That's the camp spirit.

135
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,677
[Agent Sharpe]
Are these outfits really necessary?

136
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,796
[Sara] Girl!

137
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,112
Come on. Gideon made us official
Camp Ogawa counselor uniforms

138
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,477
using archival photos
so that we could fit in.

139
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,518
What are you guys doing
just standing around?

140

Sorry to show up unannounced.

Well, freckles,

I'm the director here.

Welcome to Camp Ogawa.

145
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,954
My right-hand man, Chad Stevens,
will show you around. Chad.

146
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,150
Get over here.

- Chad, you marbled cut of prime beef,

149
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,032
give these new counselors the tour.

150
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
Cool. All right.

151
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,776
Hey, let's bounce over this way.

152
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,598
I'll give you the 411
on this place, huh?

153
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Yeah.

154
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,080
What we need are snipers
on that ridge line,

155
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,753
spotters on the ground
and an exfil site

156
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,115
for when we bag the creature.

157
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,680
Not a bad plan, Sharpie.

158
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,080
I'll put a protection spell

159
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,072
around the perimeter
to keep out the nasties.

160
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,119
Best offense is a strong defense.

161
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,836
- [Constantine] Mmm.
- Hmm.

162
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,513
So, as you can see,

163
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,398
Camp Ogawa is a miserable place,

164
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,399
and Paula runs it like a POW camp.

165
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,400
Not! [chuckles]

166
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,110
- [laughs]
- Oh, God, another '90's "not" joke.

167
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,635
Oh, it's like comic comfort food.

168
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,031
I'm sorry. I couldn't help
but admire your lanyard.

169
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,440
Did you make that yourself?

170
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,869
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

171
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,596
Yeah, along with
the 21 required merit badges,

172
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,832
I also went on to get certification
in Nuclear Science and Dentistry.

173
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,396
Oh, snap!
I've got some serious competition

174
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,296
for "Coolest Counselor"
this summer, huh? [chuckles]

175
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
Ah.

176
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,112
What about you?
You got any special skills?

177
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Martial arts.

178
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
[yells]

179
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,117
[chuckles] Sorry. That's so fresh.

180
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,400
Jackie Chan, you know.

181
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
[Chad sighs]

182
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,273
I prefer knives and swords.

183
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,153
Right, yeah. Point taken.

184
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,991
- Point taken.
- [laughing] Good one, bro.

185
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,275
Anyway, let's head over here.

186
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,113
All right,
I'm gonna assign you your cabins.

187
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,554
It's gonna be a heck of a summer.

188
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,316
He'll grow on you.

189
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,433
Greetings, members of Newton Cabin.

190
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,079
I am Counselor Ray

191
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,755
and the mysterious gentlemen
behind you is Counselor John.

192
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,880
Cheers, lads.

193
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,159
Well, today's subject
is wilderness survival,

194
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,835
which includes
Tracking and Orienteering.

195
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
Who's excited?

196
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,274
Well, you will be, okay?

197
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,352
Two words to remember when tracking.

198
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,272
Displacement and direction.

199
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,439
Now, Counselor John will demonstrate
the kind of inadvertent markers

200
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,354
people leave behind
while walking in the woods.

201
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,836
And Counselor John
is missing already.

202
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,200
See how easy it is
to get lost in the woods, gentlemen?

203
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,911
- What's up, Franklin Cabin?
- [girls cheer]

204
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,759
We are in the house,
I am Sara and this is Ava.

205
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,952
We are your camp counselors.

206
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,956
Now, I was thinking
we need a secret handshake.

207
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
[girls] Yeah.

208
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,434
Something really cool
that only we know.

209
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
- Yeah.
- So cool.

210
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,633
- What are you doing?
- Bonding.

211
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,576
How's that supposed to keep them safe
from what's in the woods?

212
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,160
It allows us to form
a meaningful connection

213
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,072
and them to feel like
they're part of a team.

214
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,936
They're not gonna be a part
of anything if they're dead.

215
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,760
- Ava...
- We can go back to the fun and games

216
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,393
once we catch the creature. Yes?

217
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,673
[clearing throat]
All right, ladies. Change in plan.

218
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,936
Today, we're gonna celebrate
your first day of camp

219
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,713
by using safety and discipline.

220
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,315
Got it? Now,

221
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,000
when I blow this whistle,
you are to run, not walk,

222
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,958
to your respective beds. [blowing]

223
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,790
But it's still daytime.

224
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,475
It will feel like nighttime
when your eyes are closed. Now, move.

225
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
Very nice.

226
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,520
[exhales]

227
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
What are you doing?

228
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,995
I'm creating a protective barrier
to catch monsters.

229
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,714
- Monsters?
- Yeah.

230
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,840
You know, the kind that slice
your stomach open

231
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,798
and then eat your intestines
for supper.

232
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,516
Getting those kids to bed was
a lot easier than I expected.

233
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,800
You know, I'm really glad I came.

234
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,910
I just feel bad.
We're ruining camp for these kids.

235
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,600
It's such an important time.

236
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,918
Well, didn't realize you were so
gung ho about this whole camp thing.

237
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,311
I was even Color Captain one year.

238
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
Mmm?

239
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,319
Summer after eighth grade.

240
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,756
I really stuck it to Suzy Smith
and the Green Team that year.

241
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,356
That sounds magical.

242
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,760
It was.

243
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,189
Unfortunately, we're here
to stop magic, my love.

244
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,470
Well, with us guarding their cabin
and Constantine's perimeter,

245
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,270
at least no swampy monster
is getting into this camp tonight.

246
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
[twig snaps]

247
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,389
Who's there?

248
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
[chuckles]

249
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,878
Relax, Lenise. It's just me.

250
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,155
Zack.

251
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,520
So, what do you want to do?

252
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,512
Have you ever kissed anyone before?

253
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,636
Zack?

254
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,434
- [roaring]
- [screaming]

255
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,720
[sighs] Beautiful morning.

256
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,798
Yeah, sorry to burst your
summer-loving bubble, mate,

257
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,599
but we're missing one
of our young charges.

258
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,592
His name is Zack or something.

259
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,599
Well, are you sure you counted right?

260
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,976
Because based on
your whiskey cologne,

261
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,080
I think you're still drunk.

262
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
No, he's right.

263
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,959
Yeah. A girl's missing
from our cabin, too.

264
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,679
Even after I put
the fear of God in them.

265
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,040
Obviously, there's something wrong
with Constantine's booby trap.

266
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,640
Yeah, are you off your trolley, mate?

267
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,196
My spell was designed to keep
the monsters from getting in,

268
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,078
not children getting out.

269
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,056
They must have snuck out
in the middle of the night.

270
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,912
Snuck out? Why would they sneak out?

271
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,480
To make out, duh.

272
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,155
Well, I suppose we should notify
the camp director.

273
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
Okay, guys, so...

274
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,797
Oh, don't worry about those kids,
they're gonna be just fine.

275
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,517
- Uh, shouldn't we mount a search party...
- They couldn't have gotten too far.

276
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,360
Look, freckles,
this happens every year.

277
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,951
Kids under the influence
of their hormones

278
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,713
go off into the woods at night.

279
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
Just watch.

280
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,517
They'll eventually get hungry
and tired, and they'll come back.

281
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,753
Now, go out there
and do some counseling.

282
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,871
Well, someone gives
precisely zero craps

283
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,553
about the safety of her campers.

284
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,830
I guarantee you one of these kids
knows where the other two went.

285
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,190
How can you be so sure?

286
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,640
Because when I was in camp,

287
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,951
we used to hide stuff from
the counselors all the time.

288
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
We just need to figure out
how to get them to talk.

289
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,069
[exhaling]

290
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,154
The Circle of Trust creates
a safe space

291
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,709
for us to share our secrets
without judgement.

292
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,759
- [sighs]
- Now, take each other's hands.

293
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,635
- Now, I want you to...
- Uh...

294
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,360
Sorry to butt in, lads,

295
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,995
but can I have
a word with you for a second?

296
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
[sighs]

297
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,559
I want you to meditate on the word
"openness" and I'll be right back.

298
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,754
You're interrupt... [clears throat]
You're interrupting the flow.

299
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,880
Yeah, well, apologies
to you and your flow

300
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,480
but all of your psychobabble,

301
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,656
it ain't gonna cut the mustard
with the young ones, mate.

302
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,909
Let me show you how it's done.

303
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,839
Right then,
which one of you whippersnappers

304
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,560
wants to be hypnotized?

305
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,040
- [boys] Me, me, me.
- Pick me!

306
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,679
- Me first.
- [all talking at once]

307
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,672
Alexis, you and Lenise
are besties, right?

308
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,797
We were partners
in last year's talent show.

309
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,376
She didn't show up at roll call
this morning. I'm worried.

310
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,914
Do you know
where she might have gone?

311
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,033
All right, ladies! On your feet.

312
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,430
Report to the front of your beds,
arms by your sides, now!

313
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,795
What is with the police lineup?

314
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,837
This is summer camp,
not boot camp, remember?

315
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,314
You are too soft on these kids.

316
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,632
Children crave authority.
Besides, my way will be quicker.

317
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
[watch ticking]

318
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,276
[Constantine] That's it.

319
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,029
Look at my watch.

320
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,120
Now, where did your mate Zack
run off to last night?

321
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,995
He didn't say.

322
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,517
But I hope he didn't go
near the outdoor showers.

323
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
Why?

324
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,520
What's by the outdoor showers?

325
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,711
That's where I hid
my Victoria's Secret catalog.

326
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
Huh.

327
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,479
Your friend Lenise snuck out
of the cabin last night.

328
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,756
And no one's going anywhere
until I find out where she went.

329
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,318
But the ice cream social
is in, like, five minutes.

330
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,476
Well, then you better, like,
start talking, Kiana,

331
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,256
or you're gonna have to scrape
the bottom of the carton

332
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
for what's left.

333
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,956
[watch ticking]

334
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,593
Last night, Zack said something about
meeting someone in the woods.

335
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,994
Where in the woods exactly?

336
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,233
A baseball field, only there's
no baseball field out there.

337
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,399
Oh, that's all right. Keep digging.

338
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,032
He kept talking about
making it to first base with a girl.

339
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,473
But who plays baseball in the dark?

340
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,711
She probably went to the same place
your style went.

341
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,840
You could use a makeover.
Like, head to toe.

342
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,760
[screaming]

343
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,435
[Gideon] <i>Ms. Tomaz,
the prisoner is growing quite unruly.</i>

344
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,680
Tell her to knock herself out.

345
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
[groans]

346
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,955
I take that back.

347
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
[sighs]

348
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,792
Damn it. Not on my watch.

349
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,350
[beeping]

350
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
[grunting]

351
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
[laughs]

352
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
[whooping]

353
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,119
Okay. I feel like we got off
on the wrong foot.

354
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,791
It's just that you're wearing
my friend's face

355
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,999
and that's a little unsettling,
given your general demeanor.

356
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,116
Look, I didn't love it at first
when I got here,

357
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,830
but I found my place.

358
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
You can, too.

359
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,760
Take a look
in the mirror, sweetheart.

360
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,912
It's not my face
that should be unsettling.

361
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,040
You're the one putting things
in cages. [clicks tongue]

362
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,760
[sighs]

363
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,078
So, how many girls has
the missus made cry so far

364
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,376
- or have you lost count?
- [sighs]

365
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,234
Ava's interrogation techniques
aren't gonna work on them.

366
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,394
They'd rather take their secrets
to the grave than squeal.

367
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,836
Anything with the boys?

368
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,718
Oh, those boys aren't hiding a thing.

369
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,776
They're open books,
if those books were written

370
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,632
by hapless fools, that is.

371
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,876
If I could just become one of them,

372
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,079
another 12-year-old camper, I could
get these girls to talk like that.

373
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,233
I do believe that you've just sparked
an idea there, Ms. Lance.

374
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,760
[Mick] End of the road, kid.

375
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,349
[gun powering up]

376
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,030
In your cage.

377
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,870
[gun powers down]

378
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,631
Bloke like you doesn't strike me
as a jailer.

379
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,233
I believe we're more alike
than you think.

380
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,616
You look like
you've been on the inside.

381
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
That's right.

382
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,994
Then how do you sleep at night

383
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,318
hanging out with
these jailer mates of yours?

384
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,110
Alcohol.

385
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,234
Oh, I've made an additional list
of suspects I want questioned.

386
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,320
- Ava...
- Look,

387
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,296
I know that you just want them
to have fun, all right?

388
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,630
But the fact of the matter is
there is a monster out there

389
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,110
hunting down these kids
and these girls are stonewalling us.

390
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Okay?

391
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
[girl] Counselor Ava?

392
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,830
Yes?

393
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,196
I'm ready to tell you
what's really going on.

394
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,394
Go on, honey. Spill the beans.

395
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,478
It won't stop
unless you do something.

396
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,630
What won't stop?

397
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,518
The monster
that lives under the dock.

398
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,040
The Lake Beast.

399
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,236
Who's the Lake Beast?

400
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,516
Years ago, at this very camp,

401
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,598
some mean kids played a prank
on a boy

402
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,114
and he drowned in the lake.

403
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,194
And now, every year he returns
to get his revenge.

404
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,560
And so you think
the Lake Beast took your friends?

405
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,480
[shudders]

406
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,117
They say the only way
to make him appear

407
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,320
is to go to the dock alone
and call his name three times.

408
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,275
Sweetie, you are so brave.

409
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,816
And I promise you,
the Lake Beast won't be

410
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,115
getting anyone tonight, okay?

411
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,470
[Ray] Guys!

412
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,157
Guys, I think I see
a Northern Saw-whet owl.

413
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,913
Ray! Focus.

414
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,799
[sighs] Fine. I'll save it
for my bird-watching journal.

415
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,276
Okay, you're in the clear, Ava.

416
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,880
- [bird screeches]
- [gasps]

417
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,830
Stupid bird.

418
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,360
Okay, let's get this over with.

419
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,958
Lake Beast. Lake Beast. Lake Beast.

420
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,836
[scoffs]

421
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,639
Guys, this feels like a bust to me.

422
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,440
[water splashing]

423
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,040
[gasps]

424
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
[laughing]

425
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,435
Oh, it was just a bloody prank.

426
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,080
- Let's go!
- Go, go, go!

427
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,390
You okay?

428
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,472
Nice night for a swim though,
eh, Sharpie.

429
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
[panting]

430
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,113
Those girls are monsters!

431
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,760
After we left the lake last night,

432
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,400
another one of our campers
went missing.

433
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,960
Another one of ours is missing, too.

434
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,270
That makes four in total.

435
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,536
They must have snuck out
to meet up with each other

436
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,755
and never made it back.

437
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,616
Yeah, well, I don't know
about you lot,

438
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,154
but I'm not just sitting around here

439
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,516
and waiting for the monster
to go and get another kid.

440
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,816
[Agent Sharpe] We better split up.

441
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,040
All right. You two check the woods
for the missing kids.

442
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,673
Ava and I will stay and watch here.

443
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,320
Hey, wait. Buddy system.

444
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,356
I heard about last night.

445
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,475
It's majorly uncool.

446
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,075
Who knew kids could be so mean?

447
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,520
They've been calling me "Lake Beast"
behind my back all day.

448
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,677
Excuse me, Lake Beast. [giggling]

449
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,760
And to my face.

450
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
[Chad] Okay. Hey.

451
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,829
That is enough, ladies.
The joke is over.

452
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,376
It's time for you to behave
or else your cabin will be banned

453
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,834
from the July Jamboree.

454
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,360
The only way we are gonna get
any information from these girls

455
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,715
is to infiltrate their clique.

456
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,640
How are we supposed to do that?
We're not kids.

457
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,275
Funny you should say that.

458
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,113
Constantine gave me a potion

459
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,393
that would turn us into kids
only temporarily.

460
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
You're kidding, right?

461
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
Wh...

462
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,200
Even if it worked, Sara, I wouldn't
have any idea how to act like a kid

463
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,296
because I've never been one.

464
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,471
All my childhood memories
are fake, remember?

465
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,576
How are we gonna find the kids
with that dangly thing?

466
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,512
You know,
this ritual usually works best

467
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,069
when someone isn't yammering
in my earlobe.

468
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,656
Well, if you want to find the kids,

469
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,239
we got to do it
the old-fashioned way.

470
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,795
Study their tracks.

471
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,096
It's a good thing I came prepared,

472
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,077
because one step
in the wrong direction here

473
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,416
and you'll be traveling for miles
in the wrong direction.

474
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,673
Damn it, you namby-pamby,
I said I need silence.

475
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,281
Oh, you meant right now.
I'm sorry, I thought you meant...

476
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,118
- [stutters]
- [grunts]

477
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,516
Why are you being such a jerk?

478
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,976
Because you shouldn't even be
out here chasing a magical creature.

479
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
All right?

480
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,680
It's too dangerous.

481
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,434
Too dangerous? [scoffs]

482
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,000
You're lucky you're out here with me,

483
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,231
because I can keep us alive
on bugs and berries alone.

484
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,399
You know, this has nothing to do
with survival in the wild,

485
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,631
and everything to do with surviving
magical creatures

486
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,552
and those who dabble
in the dark arts.

487
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,950
I'll have you know I am no stranger
to the world of magic.

488
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,271
Yeah. Oh, don't think I haven't heard

489
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,070
how Nora Darhk had you eating out of
the palm of her wicked little hand.

490
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,393
Oh, I bet she didn't even have to ask
for the time stone, did she?

491
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,237
No, you just gave it away
like biscuits at tea time.

492
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,517
Nora and I have
a mutual respect for each other.

493
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,480
It's not like I was tripping
over myself...

494
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,560
What is that?

495
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Huh.

496
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,070
No doubt left behind
by the magical beast.

497
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,677
Who sheds its skin
after it eats the kids?

498
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,514
What are we looking for?
Some sort of snake monster?

499
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,114
No, the answer is in this book.

500
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,680
Is that a magical Audubon guide?

501
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,430
Neato.

502
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Mmm.

503
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,199
It's good. What is it?

504
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,071
Hooch. I spent a little time
in a Siberian gulag.

505
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
Got a taste for it.

506
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,840
[chuckles] Where I was,
it felt like 500 years.

507
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,239
Time worked differently
in that realm.

508
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,914
Oh, I've been in a lot of cages,

509
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,909
but not a magical one.

510
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
What was it like?

511
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,470
The inside of my cage
was a constant battle

512
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,313
between creatures
from your worst nightmare.

513
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,074
I got to know some of them better
than I wanted to.

514
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,552
It was a dismal and a dark dimension

515
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,074
like nothing here on Earth.

516
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,911
And I'll be damned
if I'm ever going back.

517
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,960
Well, cheers to that.

518
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,840
[sighs]

519
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Friendship bracelet?

520
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,391
No, it's an "I'm sorry" bracelet.

521
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,800
I shouldn't have run off like that.

522
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,759
It's just that,
you know I'm not normal

523
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,376
and I think you hit a nerve
or something.

524
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,153
No, I'm sorry.

525
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,760
I never even thought about the fact
that you've never been a kid.

526
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,678
- Yeah.
- But this is really good.

527
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,512
I confiscated it from Alexis.

528
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,436
See? I'm weird.

529
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,276
Do you know that those two actors
who are my parents,

530
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,591
I keep a picture of them
on my desk in my office

531
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,558
just so I can try to feel
a little bit normal.

532
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,712
Yeah. That is anything but normal.

533
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,155
- Yeah.
- [Ray] <i>Guys.</i>

534
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,754
<i>I think we've ID'd our monster.</i>

535
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,954
Constantine and I found a skin suit
shed by something called a shtriga.

536
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,913
- Come again?
- [Constantine] <i>A shtriga.</i>

537
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,760
It's a vampiric witch that feeds off
the life force of children.

538
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,271
Bloody brilliant setting up shop
at summer camp.

539
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,914
There's some good news, sort of.

540
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,635
It says here the shtriga feeds slowly
off its prey,

541
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,956
draining its life energy
over a course of days.

542
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,631
Which means the missing kids
could still be alive.

543
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,274
Then it's on you guys to find them.

544
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
Aye.

545
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,872
Look, and it's on us
to protect these girls.

546
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,560
Now, I know you think I'm crazy,

547
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,552
but what if the best way
to protect them

548
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,199
is by becoming one of them?

549
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,951
We'll lure the creature out.
We'll be the bait.

550
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,040
What if Constantine's potion
doesn't work on me?

551
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,720
There is only one way to find out.

552
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,470
And if does, I'll be with you
every step of the way.

553
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,956
I'll show you the ropes,
teach you how to be a kid.

554
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,070
Pinky swear?

555
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,750
Pinky swear.

556
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,640
[sighs]

557
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,400
[Chad] All right, lights out, everyone.

558
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,873
[children laughing]

559
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,776
[Chad] And that means you, too,
Hopper Cabin.

560
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,120
Don't make me come in there.

561
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,791
[Sara] You feel anything yet?

562
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,680
- Um...
- [sighs]

563
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,640
No. Maybe it doesn't work.

564
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,516
The pretty lights tell me otherwise.

565
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
[door opens]

566
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,952
Hey, what are you two doing in here?

567
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,155
[gasps] Oh, snap!

568
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,798
Where'd you guys come from
out of the blue?

569
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,400
Got kicked out of Clarke Cabin

570
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,630
for putting a frog

571
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,916
- under Christi Donovan's pillow.
- [laughter]

572
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,240
You should've heard her scream.

573
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,320
[laughter]

574
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,876
Cool. And you?

575
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,755
I was kicked out because I was
caught reading after lights out.

576
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,999
Reading? Lame.

577
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,436
Uh, her counselors only thought
she was reading,

578
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,194
but really she was writing a letter
to her boyfriend.

579
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,720
He lives in France.

580
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,233
This year's counselors are the worst.

581
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,999
Especially Lake Beast.

582
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,954
- Yeah, I heard she smells bad.
- [laughter]

583
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,080
Hey!

584
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,070
Um, yeah, I heard she looked really
funny when she fell into the water.

585
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,040
[chuckles] But you're lucky
she didn't catch pneumonia.

586
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,232
That's a very serious illness.

587
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,758
Uh, sure.

588
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,275
You must have had balls
to survive that hellhole.

589
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,836
Did what I had to.

590
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,154
Shapeshifted into whatever monster
would keep the others off my back.

591
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,113
But you know exactly what it's like.

592
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,196
Pretending to be something
worse than you are to survive.

593
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,156
Well, there's that.

594
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,357
And there's finding
someone you trust.

595
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,836
I did time in supermax
with my old partner.

596
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,997
It's hard to plot against a team.

597
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,112
I spent all my time
shapeshifting and running.

598
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,560
I never stuck around
in one place long enough

599
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,438
to find anyone that I could trust.

600
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,320
Well, you gotta start somewhere.

601
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,390
[Mick groans]

602
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,118
[into comms] Hey, it's me, Sara.

603
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,560
- You guys still out there?
- [Constantine] <i>Sara.</i>

604
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,400
The potion actually worked.

605
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,279
You didn't know if it was gonna work
before you gave us the potion?

606
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,680
Of course I didn't. I've never
tested it on humans, have I?

607
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,830
Damn it, John.

608
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,673
<i>Well, just see it like this.</i>

609
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,594
You two have now turned yourselves
into irresistible shtriga bait.

610
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,319
So, any suggestions on

611
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,677
how a couple of kids can take on
a magical, child-eating hag?

612
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,990
Mmm...

613
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,390
Well, if you're in a pinch,
you can always try

614
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,359
<i>capsicum annuum,</i> more commonly
known as cayenne pepper.

615
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
Witches hate the stuff,

616
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,176
- but you'll be fine. Cheers, love.
- [comms beeps]

617
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
[sighs]

618
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,397
Great. But where are we
gonna get cayenne pepper?

619
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,910
Follow my lead.

620
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,191
[Constantine] The shtriga's lair
can't be far now.

621
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,678
[Ray] Look. A camper must have tried
to hide from the shtriga here.

622
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,656
- What are you doing?
- [grunts]

623
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,592
- Oh, a spell?
- Yup.

624
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,956
[inhales deeply]

625
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,554
[chanting in other language]

626
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,635
A will-of-the-wisp.

627
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,430
Little bugger will lead us
to whoever owns that shirt.

628
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,999
Oh, go on, then. Light the way.

629
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,430
[chuckles] Look at us,
a pair of magical detectives.

630
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,056
Oh, and I was beginning to think
you were all right,

631
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,160
and you went and said that.

632
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,275
You know, there are other dabblers
of the dark arts out there

633
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,520
who think that I'm all right.

634
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,313
Referring to Nora Darhk, are we?

635
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,376
You best stay away
from that witch, mate.

636
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,039
Not even your big heart
can keep you safe

637
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,112
from someone who's wrestled
with literal demons.

638
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,955
[scoffs] What about you?
You're one of us now.

639
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,952
You even dressed up
for a little while.

640
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,072
You've wrestled with demons
and you're good...

641
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,276
Listen to me, all right.

642
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,149
You know, I had a friend like you.

643
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,595
Someone good, someone who trusted me.

644
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,639
Be smarter than him, all right?

645
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,915
Save yourself, Ray Palmer.

646
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,912
Because people like
me and Nora Darhk,

647
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,032
we're bloody hell
for people like you.

648
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,560
[sighs]

649
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,080
Truth or dare?

650
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
Truth.

651
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,351
I think you meant dare?

652
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,236
Dare?

653
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,000
[chuckles] Dare, I mean dare.

654
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,274
I dare you to sneak out of the cabin
and break into the mess hall.

655
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,718
But to prove
that you didn't chicken out,

656
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,277
you have to bring us something
back from the kitchen.

657
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,520
[girls] Ooh...

658
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,273
This must be the place.

659
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,752
Alexis, who would you rather
have babies with?

660
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,432
Jonathan Taylor Thomas
or Mario Lopez?

661
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,520
[door opens]

662
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,275
I ran into some trouble.

663
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,113
I knew it, she chickened out.

664
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,720
I tried to carry more, but I could
only sneak out with two of these.

665
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,280
I know you missed
the ice cream social, so...

666
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,000
Ice cream social is coming to you.

667
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,034
Rocky road and mint chocolate chip,

668
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,270
you are the best ever.

669
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,834
[girls chattering indistinctly]

670
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,031
And I have something just for us.

671
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,990
That's my girl.

672
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,150
[door creaking]

673
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,509
[Ray] Oh, I've seen enough
horror movie trailers

674
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,795
to know this won't end well.

675
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,096
Oh, those films are nothing compared
to the horrors you might see

676
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,395
in real life.

677
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
[Constantine grunts]

678
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,960
[gasps]

679
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,630
Are... Are we too late?

680
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,997
I'll need an incantation,
a crystal and a conduit

681
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,037
to draw the pilfered life force
from the shtriga

682
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,236
and back into their bodies.

683
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,439
Now just follow my lead
and do everything I say.

684
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,389
We really needed this.

685
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,080
Camp's been kind of rough this year.

686
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,436
What do you mean?

687
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,754
It's okay, you can talk to us.

688
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,672
We're super worried about
Lenise and Meredith.

689
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,471
We didn't want to say anything
for the longest time.

690
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,031
We thought we'd get in trouble
and ruin everything.

691
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,516
Ruin what?

692
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,790
The midnight meetup.

693
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,240
It's a tradition.

694
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,440
Every summer, girls take turns
choosing guys they like

695
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,680
to meet up with in the woods.

696
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,231
<i>There's a string
that starts near the flag pole</i>

697
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,879
and it leads out
into the meeting spot.

698
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,435
It changes every year.

699
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,516
So, they meet up
and what's supposed to happen next?

700
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,912
Well, you're supposed to have
your first kiss and come back.

701
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,875
<i>But Lenise and Meredith
never came back.</i>

702
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,358
We got to be getting close, right?

703
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,640
[rustling]

704
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,916
What was that?

705
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800
[swishing]

706
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,751
It's way past lights out.

707
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,149
What punishment should I cook up
for you?

708
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,039
Come here, you two.

709
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,433
Get off me, you crusty old witch!

710
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,559
[screams] My eyes!

711
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,160
[grunts]

712
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,629
Is she dead?

713
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,400
All right, our team's dealing with
something called a shtriga.

714
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,736
Do you know anything
that could help them fight it?

715
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,993
Oh, a shtriga?
Very intelligent and very deadly.

716
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,829
If you want my help,
it's gonna cost you.

717
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,800
Great. Will that come
in the form of another haiku,

718
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,917
or can we expect something
a little more detailed?

719
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,913
What's that? What's that eye thing?

720
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,953
According to legend,
shtrigas are nasty old women.

721
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,758
But the one that I met in prison,
the one that you're looking for,

722
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,678
is beautiful. And he's a bloke.

723
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,759
- Hmm.
- [beeping]

724
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,515
What the hell are you doing?

725
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,392
Hey, you don't have
another bathroom break for...

726
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,761
Oh, that's right, never,
since you tried to break my face.

727
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,078
It is now or never.

728
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,916
Fine. Whatever.

729
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,430
[sighing] Guys, this shtriga thing
is not an old woman.

730
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,920
What's going on out here?

731
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,034
[Zari over comms] <i>You are looking for
a young, handsome dude.</i>

[Constantine] All right,
you ready, big man?

733
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,470

What did you guys do to her?

736
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,280
We didn't do anything.

737
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,033
Look, it's not safe
for you guys out here.

738
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,273
Okay? You're coming with me.

739
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,160
We can take care of ourselves.

740

Any of you got a light?

What happened?

You saved him. You saved Randall.

Well, that's good.

the rest of you out.

Found you guys! We got worried
when you didn't show up for dinner.

Those kids look famished. Get them
water and electrolytes, stat.

And that gurney we just made out of
rope and wood, bring it in.

[laughs] Good job, Tobey.

794
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,320
[chuckles]

795
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,636
John's potion will
be wearing off soon.

796
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,511
And it's back to our normal lives

797
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,071
where we are only responsible
for babysitting Rory and Gary.

798
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,200
I'd like to thank you for giving me
real childhood memories.

799
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,989
To be honest, these memories
have been kind of awful,

800
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,398
mostly awkward, but totally awesome.

801
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,117
I mean, it wouldn't be childhood
without all the above. [chuckles]

802
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,556
I'm happy it was with you.

803
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,160
And considering all the trouble
those kids went through for a kiss,

804
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,794
I'm guessing no childhood
would be complete without one.

805
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,076
Couldn't help but notice
our magical friend

806
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,157
is not where she's supposed to be.

807
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,800
[Zari] Oh, she's not?

808
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,318
Rory, do you know
anything about that?

809
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,038
[clears throat] You don't pay me enough
to be a stinking prison guard.

810
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,554
I don't pay you anything.

811
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,591
Well, I let the fake Amaya go.

812
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,399
- Why would you do that?
- [Sara sighs]

813
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,550
Oh, in order to...

814
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,197
Have an extreme makeover.

815
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,760
Thanks for the shtriga tip.

816
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,390
Well, if you had
your hands full with a shtriga,

817
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,235
I figured you'd need my help
with whatever you plebs face next.

818
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,631
Sounds like
a mutually-beneficial partnership.

819
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,516
One condition, though.

820
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,350
I never set foot in that cage
ever again.

821
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,630
Got it?

822
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,554
[Gideon] Mr. Constantine's body
is rejecting my treatments.

823
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,154
His odds of survival are bleak.

824
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,357
John, what you did out there
was pretty selfless.

825
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,750
I told you you were good.

826
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,669
That's not good for you.

827
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,590
Get some rest, John.

828
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,680
Gideon, give him the good stuff.

829
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,600
- [injection hissing]
- [groaning] Oh, Gideon.

830
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,838
That was nice, love,
we should party more...

831
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,155
[Ray] He's getting worse.

832
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,074
The magic he used to save
that camper was pretty powerful.

833
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,038
Well, if magic has him
on death's door,

834
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,998
then maybe magic can save him.

835
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,960
I think I know someone who can help.

836
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,393
But I have no idea how to find her.

837
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,630
[bubbling]

838
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,799
Just one final ingredient.

839
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,429
I trust you'll find
that my potion is magical.

840
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,995
Ugh! [spits]

841
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,509
You call that soup?

842
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,200
[gags and coughs]

843
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,397
Oh, I... I can start over.

844
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,472
The Ren fair opens in an hour.

845
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,116
You know what? Forget it.

846
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,520
It's not like folks come to this tent
for the food anyways.

847
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,680
I'm sorry?

848
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,272
They come for the lusty wenches.

849
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,594
[chuckles] I'm...

850
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,720
I'm a witch.

851
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,750
Okay. Well, as long as
it's a lusty witch, okay?

852
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,992
