1
00:00:19,938 --> 00:00:22,690
This is one of the largest
and most mysterious plane crashes

2
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:24,233
in Colombian history.

3
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:06,734
You know where Jaime is?

4
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:09,737
No, sir.
I don’t know where he is.

5
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:12,615
He left home and hasn’t returned.

6
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:16,035
—Have Pablo and his men come by here?
—No.

7
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,412
—Your name is Natalie?
—Yes, sir.

8
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:22,500
Natalie, your boyfriend, Jaime,
was he with Pablo’s sicarios?

9
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:25,252
—No.
—Are you sure?

10
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:27,087
Yes, sir.

11
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:30,549
Well, then, why do you
have this picture of Pablo in your house?

12
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:35,429
Nothing wrong with that.
Everyone in the comuna has one.

13
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:38,724
You think those thugs
are going to protect you?

14
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:43,354
You don’t understand …
that you represent a big problem for them.

15
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:46,065
We can help you.

16
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:50,402
We can protect you.
But you have to tell us the truth.

17
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:18,597
I don’t want to leave, my love.
I don’t want to leave.

18
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,517
But I must, for all our safety.

19
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,477
Did you do something wrong?

20
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:29,400
Your dad did nothing wrong.

21
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:38,283
These are people who are jealous of us,
who are trying to take what we have.

22
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:40,870
You have to be strong.

23
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:45,124
I want you to be strong.

24
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,794
You have to be strong
and never show weakness.

25
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:50,755
I promise I’ll never be weak.

26
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:55,342
And watch out for your sister.

27
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:04,060
I love you very much.

28
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,439
I love you all very much.

29
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:15,195
—Do not spoil this boy.
—But … what do you mean?

30
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:20,409
—Watch her.
—Just a few sweets and some pork rinds.

31
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:31,336
Be careful, son. Be careful.

32
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:46,518
—I love you.
—Me, too.

33
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,605
Take care.

34
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:53,192
And what about you?

35
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,320
Come on.
I’m going to take you with me.

36
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:59,782
I’m going to take you with me …

37
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,465
Take care.

38
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,431
You think he did it?

39
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:27,143
Surely not.

40
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:31,563
Blow up that plane?

41
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,568
Of course he did it, Hermilda.

42
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,612
But he had his reasons.

43
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:46,745
We’ve got everyone looking
for Jaime’s wife throughout the comunas.

44
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,083
I want you to find her and kill her.

45
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:55,796
And kill any motherfucker that
can connect me with that fucking plane.

46
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,423
Yes, sir.

47
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:40,525
… the functions of President of Colombia?

48
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:42,027
I swear.

49
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,048
Well, César, congratulations.

50
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:05,509
Not César … I mean, Mr President.

51
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,263
Excuse us.

52
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:17,980
As a former president to a new one …
what advice would you give?

53
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:23,735
Well … you’ll be asked
to make many difficult decisions.

54
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,031
I would say one thing …
do what your wife says.

55
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,866
I always do.

56
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:38,125
Trust your instincts,
and be confident in your decisions.

57
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,502
Yes …

58
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:44,340
but that’s easier said than done.

59
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,675
You’ll never be able to please everyone,

60
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,261
so find the solution
that rings true in your heart.

61
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:50,512
Thank you.

62
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,265
Another thing I did want to tell you,
about the Americans--

63
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:55,309
What about the Americans?

64
00:07:56,394 --> 00:08:00,272
This will have to be off the record,
my dear.

65
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:04,235
I can’t have my opinions
broadcast on your television show.

66
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,320
No, no, no.
You have my word.

67
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:09,865
—The Americans …
—Yes?

68
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,534
Be careful.

69
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,784
—Pablo.
—What’s up, Pacho?

70
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,166
Thank you.

71
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:20,680
We have Miami …
and have left you alone in New York.

72
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:24,268
—Yes, for a price.
—Certainly.

73
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:29,773
Look, Pacho, we agreed that we would
share the Los Angeles territory …

74
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,443
and that hasn’t been happening.

75
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:36,238
It seems you are not
holding up our agreement.

76
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:39,950
—How’s that?
—Exactly what I’m saying, Pacho.

77
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:46,998
Look, Pablo …

78
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:52,087
you know that our partners
sometimes operate independently.

79
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,340
If Mr Galeano
and Mr Moncada are correct,

80
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:58,510
then you have my assurance
that it will be rectified.

81
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:00,011
Thanks a lot, Pacho.

82
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,224
Disputes between us
cause needless bloodshed.

83
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:10,021
Then fix it. A war between our groups
is the last thing we need right now.

84
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,234
It would seem you already have a war.

85
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,862
Maybe bombing that plane
was a step too far.

86
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,492
Careful, Pacho.

87
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,368
Careful.
The only difference between us

88
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,954
is our little misunderstanding
with the government.

89
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,831
And that will be resolved soon.

90
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,000
Besides, that’s the business,
for all of us.

91
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,960
Yes, it’s true for all of us.

92
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:35,255
The only war we are really fighting
is the war against extradition.

93
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,799
And the outcome of that
is something we’re all interested in.

94
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,219
It’s true, Gustavo.
Gustavo is right.

95
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:44,723
We have a common goal,
and that is to get rid of extradition.

96
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:49,311
The United States is big enough
for all of us to operate in.

97
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:54,399
Let’s figure out Los Angeles
once you take care of your business here.

98
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,405
You know what bothers me?

99
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,284
Your arrogance.

100
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,579
Your attitude, your air of superiority.

101
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:15,337
Careful, Pacho … that you don’t
get yourself killed for that.

102
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,806
Thank you for coming.

103
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,410
—I’m gonna kill that homo bastard.
—Come on, Pablo, let me kill him.

104
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,745
Stop talking shit, Moncada.

105
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,873
We’ll kill that fag later.
Right now, we can’t be out in the open.

106
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,669
If that son of a bitch
starts selling shit in Los Angeles,

107
00:13:55,753 --> 00:14:01,883
I’m personally gonna put a gun up his ass
and pull the trigger. I swear.

108
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,511
That will make him fall in love with you.

109
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,794
I think it’s up this way.

110
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,172
I don’t want to shoot her.

111
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,759
Kill that cute girl?
And the baby, too?

112
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:11,555
I don’t know why the boss
wants us to kill that girl.

113
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:17,227
—What does she know about Avianca anyway?
—Just shut up and follow orders!

114
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,148
Does he think putting a bomb
on every street corner

115
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,901
is going to get the police
to quit chasing him?

116
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,904
Gustavo, we need to get away,
out of this country.

117
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,117
And go where?

118
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:36,371
We’ll be treated like criminals
wherever we go.

119
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,627
They’ll kill him, and you know it.

120
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,004
I just hope he doesn’t
take you down with him.

121
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,967
This isn’t our war.

122
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:54,431
This isn’t war.
It’s negotiation.

123
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,647
Don’t you understand
what an opportunity this is?

124
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:05,859
He’s willing to consider
terms of surrender--

125
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:10,572
Under what conditions?
My God, he just blew up a plane!

126
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,658
Eduardo, calm down.
Let the man speak.

127
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:18,705
We can end this violence with dignity.
It’s good for both sides--

128
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,917
Do you realize
how stupid you sound right now?

129
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,209
César, this is absurd.

130
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,128
—Eduardo, please--
—This is a farce.

131
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,546
Please.

132
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,259
Let me deal with this. Please.

133
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,595
Fine. Whatever you want.

134
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:41,060
We can at least begin a discussion, right?

135
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,105
Even though you never stated it,

136
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:48,359
surely you’d like
to see the bombings stop.

137
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,739
—Yes. Yes, I would.
—Exactly.

138
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:56,159
So if we begin a dialogue,
they will cease.

139
00:17:56,242 --> 00:18:01,289
That affords us all some time,
including the Search Bloc.

140
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,750
Fernando …

141
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:09,422
you saw his money,
and it blinded you to his soul.

142
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,675
That son of a bitch has no soul.

143
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:22,310
If telling him we’re negotiating allows
the bombs to stop while we find him …

144
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,271
then be my guest.

145
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:34,238
Thank you.
Really, thank you.

146
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,707
Look, man,
Pablo’s turned into a saint.

147
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,711
Of course.
He sends people straight to heaven.

148
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:59,657
She’s not here.
She might have just left.

149
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,702
Let’s search the comuna.

150
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,414
Look, Poison, I’m telling you
Pablo is being paranoid.

151
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,541
Careful what you say, son.

152
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,211
One day,
he is going to ask me to kill you.

153
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,174
Would you do it?

154
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,969
If he asks me … of course.

155
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,512
There is no way around it.

156
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:24,891
Wouldn’t you?

157
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,358
All right, all right,
let’s just go find this girl.

158
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,694
We’ll look around
and see where she’s hiding.

159
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:40,657
What’s wrong?

160
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,159
Here you go.

161
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,702
It’s OK, Natalie. Don’t worry.

162
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:49,624
Before you know it, we’ll get you
some food. Right? Isn’t that right?

163
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:50,875
Thank you.

164
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,058
What then, Fernando?

165
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,978
Has the Colombian government
offered a truce?

166
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,524
The government
hasn’t been willing to offer anything

167
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,275
I would consider acceptable.

168
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,069
What did they offer?

169
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:20,989
They want you to admit …

170
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,326
that you’re responsible for Avianca.

171
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,538
And of course, I told them that--
That we can’t even--

172
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,373
Is it that you’re not negotiating a thing?

173
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,667
No, no, of course I’m negotiating--

174
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,880
Then why is Carrillo
stopping every car in the comunas

175
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,632
and killing my boys
with the help of the gringos‽

176
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:45,638
Why are the Americans helping them if we
are supposed to be negotiating, Fernando?

177
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:52,729
Gaviria doesn’t want the gringos to know
he’s willing to negotiate with you.

178
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,524
That’s it.

179
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,365
Be very careful, Fernando.

180
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,954
Yes, Pablo.

181
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,959
Yes.

182
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,233
You’ve got to stop the bombing, Pablo.

183
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:44,781
I don’t know what you’re thinking anymore.

184
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,452
I think we should …

185
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,331
reorganize a bit …

186
00:22:54,540 --> 00:23:00,964
and start sending our boys out to burn
some houses down and do some damage …

187
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,967
to politicians and senators
all over the country.

188
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:08,638
And to the soldiers and cops in our way,
the judges who annoy us

189
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,140
and the reporters that watch us,

190
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:14,269
basically, we have to create a presence so
disruptive they’ll want nothing but peace.

191
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:17,647
That’s the only way
we’re going to get there.

192
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:22,526
Is that it? Is that what you want?
A civil war?

193
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:28,158
—You’ve gone crazy, asshole.
—We have to fight, brother.

194
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:31,494
Let’s put our hearts into this.

195
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,915
And if we all must die, so be it.

196
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,170
Well, yes …

197
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,176
The thing is,
I don’t want to die yet, Pablo.

198
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:56,978
Nor do I.

199
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,650
But the bombs make the public want peace.

200
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:05,403
And that will influence the politicians.

201
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:20,793
You’re the one who says the politicians
don’t give a shit about the public.

202
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:26,341
If you want to influence politicians,
you’ll have to narrow your focus.

203
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:28,426
You know what I mean?

204
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,063
What about her?

205
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,399
No, she is way too much of a princess.

206
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,983
Surely we would have problems with her.

207
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:46,069
My God, look at that face.

208
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:50,073
The media is going to love that fox,
right?

209
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:53,117
Sure they will, but so will our boys.

210
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:54,827
Just think what
they’re gonna do to her.

211
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:56,829
Well …

212
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:01,042
I say let’s start with her …

213
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:05,755
Move it!

214
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,884
… and this fag.

215
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,229
And this cute couple.

216
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:38,162
Family members of the most
influential people in the country

217
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:42,041
have been kidnapped
on the very streets they call home.

218
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,669
What does Pablo Escobar want?

219
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:49,799
I’ll see you tomorrow on the same channel
for a special report.

220
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,890
Is everything all right?

221
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,979
All the victims are my friends.

222
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:20,955
Excuse me.

223
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:27,586
The kidnapping of Francisco Santos,

224
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,423
the editor in chief of the most important
newspaper in the nation,

225
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:33,301
is the latest and most shocking
in a string of kidnappings

226
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,636
orchestrated by the Medellín cartel.

227
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,097
Reporting to you, I’m Valeria Velez.

228
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:42,935
—All right.
—First on the scene, right? As always.

229
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:48,232
Maybe if you actually
had to work for a living,

230
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:50,901
you’d be hungry enough to get here first.

231
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,946
I found out from Santos’ wife …

232
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,949
a half hour after
he didn’t show up for dinner.

233
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:58,868
You?

234
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:00,953
Who tipped you off?

235
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,290
It’s a pleasure to see you,
as always.

236
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:29,815
These are Pablo’s conditions
for the release of the hostages.

237
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:32,818
You’ve read them,
you can see they’re very reasonable.

238
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:34,571
“Very reasonable,” he says.

239
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:38,366
You are definitely an imbecile, Fernando.

240
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:40,451
And I’m going to tell you something.

241
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:44,747
You will get what you deserve very soon,
I assure you.

242
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,798
I’m also one of those hostages.

243
00:27:55,716 --> 00:28:02,223
I myself could be walking around calmly …
but like them, I am not free.

244
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:11,065
Escobar is asking us to surrender,
but that will never happen.

245
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:15,945
If he releases the hostages
and turns himself in,

246
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,489
we will take this into account.

247
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:23,369
Gaviria isn’t going to bend.

248
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:28,541
Then I’m going to break him.

249
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,801
You, get up from there.

250
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:53,149
The body of Ofelia Hernandez was found
dumped next to the Presidential Palace.

251
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:57,570
One must admire President Gaviria.
I’m sure it can’t be easy for him

252
00:28:57,654 --> 00:29:00,657
to stand by his decision
to not negotiate with Escobar.

253
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,033
What’s the plan?

254
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:08,539
A few more hostages and they will give in.

255
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,377
Their time is running out.

256
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:15,254
I’m talking about us.

257
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:19,467
What about us, Valeria?

258
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:27,808
I don’t have time
for that pussy shit right now.

259
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,816
Colombia’s sweetheart.

260
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:39,236
You know the only reason
this hag has any fame

261
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,447
is because her father was president.

262
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:44,908
I despise her.

263
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,538
And why do you care so much?

264
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:54,001
Your ratings are through the roof, right?

265
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,253
Hers are higher.

266
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:27,868
Open the door, quick!

267
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:31,038
Move!

268
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,082
Let’s go!

269
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:35,543
Hurry up!

270
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:19,962
Where am I?

271
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,049
Hello!

272
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:27,303
Tell me where I am.

273
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,223
Does my family know I’m alive?

274
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,809
How would I know?

275
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:37,938
Who are you?

276
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:41,984
You work for Escobar?

277
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:45,154
You can call me Gorilla.

278
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:48,699
Gorilla.

279
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:53,329
Very well … Gorilla.

280
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:56,123
Where’s my crew?

281
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,502
Did you bring them here as well?

282
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:05,466
I’m here to guard you. That’s it.

283
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,285
Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me.

284
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:37,331
We understand the frustration and pain
you must be feeling for your children,

285
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:41,210
but believe me,
we are doing everything we can

286
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,504
to make sure your children get home soon.

287
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:46,382
Our daughter was kidnapped
on her way to an interview.

288
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,760
They killed the bodyguard.
No one is safe.

289
00:32:49,844 --> 00:32:55,057
As a former president, I understand
the terrible position you’re in.

290
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,936
But we’re here to find a solution.

291
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,939
I understand your frustration,
Dr Turbay.

292
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:08,779
But if we give in now, any criminal
can hold our government hostage.

293
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:13,116
This isn’t “any criminal.”
This is the worst criminal in the world.

294
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,536
—And he is laughing at all of us.
—Mr President,

295
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:20,999
you’re proceeding as you must, but we must
act as the parents of our children.

296
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,961
Let’s pray you find a solution.

297
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:54,617
Hands up!

298
00:33:55,952 --> 00:33:58,579
—Why are you driving this car?
—I don’t know.

299
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,582
Someone paid me 50,000 pesos
to drive it around the city.

300
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,927
Pablo came to see me.

301
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,094
Why?

302
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,388
He wants to settle the dispute
we have in the United States.

303
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,140
The Los Angeles problems.

304
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:21,101
He has bigger issues
than that right now.

305
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,646
He’ll make a deal with the government.

306
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:27,900
He’s managed to secure
some very effective bargaining chips.

307
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:30,861
Of course,
he’ll look after you guys, right?

308
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:34,406
We haven’t talked to Pablo in weeks.
He’s in hiding.

309
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:38,494
Look at that.
What a beautiful animal, Jorge.

310
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:39,620
You like it?

311
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,747
Yes, of course.

312
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:45,626
I’m sure he’ll look after you.
After all, you’re partners.

313
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:47,544
Yes, of course. Partners.

314
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:56,846
You could always have your sister
put in a good word with Gustavo.

315
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,806
What do you mean?

316
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:02,059
Oh, I’m sorry,
I thought you knew.

317
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:06,022
It could be gossip.
You know how people like to talk.

318
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,615
You should eat,
because you’re going to be here a while.

319
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,575
You’re going to get very hungry.

320
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:21,787
I don’t feel well.

321
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:25,541
What’s wrong? Are you sick?

322
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,626
I can get you some medicine.

323
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,714
It’s not that kind of illness.

324
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:39,137
I want to congratulate you.
I know you’re a very good reporter.

325
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:41,765
Thank you.

326
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:46,729
Gorilla, how long have you been
working for Escobar?

327
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:50,524
Oh, it’s been a while.

328
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:53,986
So you know what’s going on out there,
don’t you?

329
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:58,741
The truth is, I don’t go out.
So I have no idea what’s happening.

330
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,453
What the fuck are you doing, Gorilla?
Why isn’t she wearing the blindfold?

331
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:04,872
I didn’t know you were coming.

332
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:08,166
Put it on, man!
We have to take her.

333
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,418
Put that on.

334
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:14,631
—Says who?
—Didn’t I tell you to stay quiet?

335
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:16,466
Just put it on.

336
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,150
Pleasure to finally meet you,
Ms. Turbay.

337
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,278
Sit down, please.

338
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:10,854
I suppose you want me to interview you?

339
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:14,399
Even better.

340
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:17,111
I’m going to interview you.

341
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:21,698
So you can tell the world about
the humane treatment you’ve received here.

342
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:29,372
Don’t you want your parents
to know you’re well?

343
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:32,417
That you’re alive?

344
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:40,968
I don’t want to become
a piece of propaganda for you.

345
00:37:42,845 --> 00:37:44,304
Who do you think you are?

346
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:54,481
So what’s necessary, miss,
to have your cooperation?

347
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,533
Let one of the hostages go.

348
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:11,623
You and I know
that I’m the one you really want.

349
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,056
You see?

350
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:31,393
Two reasonable people
coming to an agreement.

351
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:38,316
Maybe we can convince President Gaviria
to do the same. Right?

352
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:45,532
Mr Escobar has shown
a willingness to negotiate.

353
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:50,204
This afternoon,
he let one of the hostages go.

354
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:52,372
President Gaviria …

355
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:58,087
I ask you to at least
consider discussions with Mr Escobar.

356
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:07,846
I don’t understand. I thought you said
he wouldn’t bend, but now he’s let one go.

357
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:10,182
Because he has your daughter.

358
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:13,102
And she’s worth more to him
than the rest of them combined.

359
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:18,982
If you knew all I know, you’d understand
it’s nothing more than a stunt.

360
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,692
Give him what he wants.

361
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:23,237
What he wants is an insult to us
and to this country.

362
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:25,155
I don’t care. I want my child!

363
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,741
I believe what my wife
is trying to say is,

364
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:31,661
we’d like you to make a deal with Escobar.

365
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:36,041
If you refuse,
we’ll have to take certain measures.

366
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:42,589
Financially, by robbing you of donors …
and politically,

367
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:47,510
by robbing you of whatever support
your legislative agenda needs.

368
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,682
Are you threatening me?

369
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,978
We all use the tools at our disposal.

370
00:39:56,061 --> 00:40:00,274
You as a politician, me as a father.
I’m sorry.

371
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,026
Doctor …

372
00:40:04,278 --> 00:40:07,114
you told me to follow my instincts …

373
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,618
and they tell me not to give in
to this criminal.

374
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:14,163
That was before they took my daughter.

375
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:03,253
I came over as quickly as I could.
I was told you needed me urgently.

376
00:41:03,337 --> 00:41:04,713
What’s up?

377
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:07,966
You OK?

378
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:16,808
Tell Fernando …
I’m willing to open negotiations.

379
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:21,646
We’ll make a counter to Escobar’s demands.

380
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:24,400
I thought you weren’t going to negotiate.

381
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,032
I have to stop this madness.

382
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:37,787
But God willing,
we can catch him first.

383
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:45,754
Tell the Americans
they can put their planes in the air.

384
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:09,778
What?

385
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,322
Yes, we’re here in Campo Valdés.

386
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,756
We’re gonna score a quick goal
and then come back out.

387
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,967
All right, all right. All right.

388
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,973
Don’t kill me, please!

389
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:41,935
I swear I didn’t hear anything.
I’m not going to say anything.

390
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,313
Please, don’t kill me.

391
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:46,148
—I’m not--
—Hey! Hey!

392
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:49,734
—Please, don’t kill me.
—What?

393
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:52,821
I’m begging you, please …

394
00:42:57,033 --> 00:43:01,455
You could have at least waited
till I got her off me. Look at me now!

395
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:04,333
You got blood all over my new shoes.

396
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:07,627
I don’t give a shit about your shoes.
Stop bitching.

397
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:10,130
I’m not.

398
00:43:11,465 --> 00:43:12,424
What about her?

399
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:20,390
Put a bullet in her.

400
00:43:26,188 --> 00:43:28,565
What? The baby’s not a witness, man.

401
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,817
I don’t give a shit.

402
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,653
—Pablo told us to kill everyone.
—Yeah, but it’s a baby.

403
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,989
She won’t say shit in court.

404
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:39,535
If she grows up and talks?

405
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,996
Really? Do you remember
what your mom told you when you were two?

406
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:48,335
Why is it so fucking difficult
for you to follow Pablo’s orders?

407
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,372
Drop the gun.

408
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:51,791
Now!

409
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:01,593
You’re under arrest,
you son of a bitch.

410
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,303
Let him go!

411
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:14,606
Let him go!

412
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:17,066
—Put the gun down.
—You put yours down.

413
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:20,236
I don’t want to have to kill you.

414
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:22,405
I will.

415
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:11,389
So those fags
want to sit and negotiate.

416
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:14,392
Well …

417
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,480
we have to spend some time in jail, right?

418
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:20,356
So what the fuck.

419
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:24,360
You won, Pablo. They gave in.

420
00:48:24,444 --> 00:48:29,741
But that faggot president has yet
to accept our most important demand

421
00:48:29,825 --> 00:48:31,493
before we turn ourselves in.

422
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,911
Which demand is that?

423
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,252
It’s been a while
since we’ve been up here, right?

424
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:42,378
Yeah.

425
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:48,092
We used to come up here
with our girlfriends and smoke a joint.

426
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:52,555
What does that have to do with anything?

427
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:01,981
I know every centimetre
of these mountains.

428
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:07,320
From here,
we can see anything coming.

429
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:11,032
And we have enough space
to build whatever we want.

430
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:15,578
We’re going to design it …

431
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:19,708
we’re going to build it …

432
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:24,962
and we will be protected
from all our enemies.

433
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:31,177
—You want to build a jail?
—Not a jail, cousin.

434
00:49:32,846 --> 00:49:34,472
A castle.
