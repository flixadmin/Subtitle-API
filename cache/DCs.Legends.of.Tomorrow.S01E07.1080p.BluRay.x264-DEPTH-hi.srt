I'm sorry to interrupt, Captain.

00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:06,628
Uh, not at all.
Just catching up on work.

53
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,298
- What is all this?
- Trying to connect the dots.

54
00:02:09,464 --> 00:02:12,467
Find the optimal time
to strike at Savage.

55
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,010
And?

56
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:15,762
And the trail's gone cold.

57
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:17,689
In order to preserve
the element of surprise,

58
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,127
I wager
the best course of action

59
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:21,059
is to travel
further back in time.

60
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:23,561
But nothing here indicates
where to find him.

61
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:25,647
Perhaps I can help you look?

62
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:27,065
I've been looking!

63
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:29,901
I apologize.

<i>It's just,
the stakes are so high.</i>

65
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:35,782
I vowed to save my family,
but I am failing them.

66
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:40,203
(SCOFFS) Perhaps I'm not
the Time Master they need.

67
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:45,124
You must be.
You're the only one they have.

68
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,336
Can't Gideon help us?

69
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,004
No. When a Timeship returns

70
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,690
to the Vanishing Point
after a mission,

71
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:53,883
its CPU is updated
from the Temporal Database,

72
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:59,180
which, given my rogue status,
we are unable to do.

73
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:00,515
So, what you're saying is,

74
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:03,434
Gideon requires
a software update?

75
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:05,061
Which explains why you've been

76
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:07,063
holed up in here
for the past week.

77
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,940
Has it really been a week?

78
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:10,149
Mmm-hmm.

79
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:14,612
And some of our teammates
are getting just a tad antsy.

80
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:15,822
(GRUNTS)

81
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:18,950
I'm done.

82
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:23,496
Don't mind him. He's still sore
about having to leave 2046.

83
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:25,874
I'm sore because I was recruited

84
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,459
for my unique ability
to light things on fire.

85
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:31,087
And now,
I'm locked in the one place

86
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:33,631
where I can't
light things on fire,

87
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:34,799
a spaceship.

88
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:36,384
Where do you think you're going?

89
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:40,221
Why? You gonna clock me
in the head

90
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:41,806
if I don't listen again?

91
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,563
Everything okay with you two?

92
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,274
Yeah. Peachy.

93
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:54,527
GIDEON: <i>Captain, I've just intercepted
a deep-space transmission.</i>

94
00:03:54,694 --> 00:03:56,279
<i>It's a distress signal
from the</i> Acheron.

95
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:57,882
She's the flagship

96
00:03:57,906 --> 00:04:00,116
Yes, I know that.
Thank you, Gideon.

97

99
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:08,207

101
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,173
And we care
about this chick, why?

102
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,342
We don't.
But the <i>Acheron's</i> computer

103
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:18,801
will contain the current intel

104
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,261
on Savage's whereabouts.

105
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:22,138
Gideon, set a course

106
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:23,657
for the <i>Acheron's</i> position
in deep space.

107
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:24,807
GIDEON: <i>Yes, Captain.</i>

108
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:27,477
Deep space?
I had no idea we had the ability

109
00:04:27,644 --> 00:04:31,272
to explore the unknown realms
of the galaxy. Astonishing!

110
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,690
No, what's astonishing is that

111
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:34,217
we're acting
as roadside assistance

112
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:35,722
<i>for the people who's chasing us.</i>

113
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,780
Doesn't it seem suspicious
this distress call

114
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:40,531
<i>just happened to reach us?</i>

115
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:42,458
- How do we know it's not a trap?
- We don't.

116
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,678
But what we do know is that
Savage's trail has run cold,

117
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:46,371
and unless Gideon
can upload the data

118
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:48,873
- from the <i>Acheron's</i> computer--
- I'm in.

119
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,708
You are?

120
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,043
The sooner we end Savage,

121
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,878
the sooner I get back
to where I belong.

122
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:55,213
Prison?

123
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,840
Any prison on Earth's

would you care
to join the boarding party?

129
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,669
A chance for an extra-vehicular
docking maneuver.

130
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:37,231
- What could be more exciting?
- I can think of a few things.

131
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:38,840
Let's get this thing started.

132
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:44,095
Hey, you think there's something
worth stealing on that ship?

133
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:46,597
I'm just looking
for a change of scenery.

134
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,266
If that's okay with you, boss.

135
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:53,479
Dr. Palmer, I leave the ship
in your hands while we're gone.

136
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:55,148
And I leave him in yours.

137
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:09,704
I'm having
the strangest sensation,

138
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:11,247
it's like I'm 10 years old
again.

139
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:13,458
You do a lot of space travel
as a kid, professor?

140
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:15,024
PROFESSOR STEIN: <i>Only in my dreams.</i>

141
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:18,796
After I read my first issue
of <i>Rick Starr: Space Ranger.</i>

142
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:21,716
Space Ranger Stein?
Yeah, I don't see it.

143
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:24,218
I wanted to travel
through space,

144
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:27,096
surviving only by my wits
and laser guns.

(CHUCKLING SOFTLY) I even built a rocket
out of cardboard boxes.

What stopped you?

147
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,936
NASA has
rather strict guidelines

149
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,522

316
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:10,100
- Gilbert!
- GILBERT: <i>Yes, sir.</i>

317
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,686
Set a pursuit course
and prepare to return fire.

318
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:21,062
If you destroy the <i>Waverider,</i>

319
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:22,446
none of us
are getting back home.

320
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:23,864
Don't worry.

321
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,200
I'm only targeting your
ship's life-support systems.

322
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:36,877
Now, if I were the weapons
targeting system on the <i>Acheron,</i>

323
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:40,714
where would I be?

324
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:44,969
(FIRING)

325
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:48,657
GIDEON: <i>There's a hull breach
in the aft portion of the ship,</i>

326
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:50,891
<i>and the pirates have taken out
the telemetry controls.</i>

327
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,685
Gideon, switch to manual.

328
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,270
What are you doing?

329
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:56,981
If this is anything
like a videogame,

330
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,274
I'm flying a spaceship.

331
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:01,318
Where are you guys going?

332
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:02,820
To deal
with the hole in the ship.

333
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:06,115
Make sure Picard here
doesn't get us all killed.

334
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:08,075
Actually, I'm more like
Sulu right now.

335
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,702
Or Han Solo!

336
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,922
Target their thrusters and fire.

337
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,404
- I said fire!
- (WEAPONS SYSTEM POWERING DOWN)

338
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:30,264
Sir, the weapon systems
have been taken offline.

339
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:31,682
<i>Manually.</i>

340
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,017
Who else is on my ship?

341
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,768
A good captain
keeps his best weapons

342
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,295
hidden from his enemies,
Mr. Valor.

343
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,148
Find the saboteur,
bring him to me, dead or alive.

344
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:40,355
I guess we'll just have to

345
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:41,876
follow your friends
till they're out of air.

346
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,193
Shouldn't take too long

347
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,070
given the size
of the hole in the hull.

348
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:49,533
Here.

349
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,788
Hail the crew of the <i>Waverider.</i>

350
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,499
Rip, tell your crew
to let us board,

351
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,126
and I will happily save them.

352
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,920
But either way,
we are taking the <i>Waverider.</i>

353
00:16:03,756 --> 00:16:04,882
Take the damn deal, Rip.

354
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:07,343
A captain
never surrenders his ship.

355
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,970
Besides, you'll never catch
Captain Palmer.

356
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,264
<i>He once outran
Kanjar Ro himself!</i>

357
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:13,891
Who's Kanjar Ro?

358
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:16,348
- GIDEON: <i>Engaging protocol now, Captain.</i>
- Awesome.

359
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:18,187
<i>I wasn't talking to you.</i>

360
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,778
What the hell happened to them?

361
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,988
We were following
a holographic projection,

362
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,324
which allowed
the <i>Waverider</i> to slip away.

363
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:31,891
Giving secret commands
to your crew.

364
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,285
- Very clever, Captain.
- Um...

365
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:34,787
Throw them in the brig.

366
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:38,999
We'll find your friends'
bodies, eventually.

367
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,543
How long can you
keep that up for?

368
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,713
Not long.
I'm gonna run out of charge.

369
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:49,343
GIDEON: <i>Be advised. The breach
is only partially contained.</i>

370
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,972
Guess we know
the bulkhead doors are working.

371
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:57,309
Too bad we're
on the wrong side of them.

372
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,402
(ALARM BLARING)

373
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,321
Uh-oh.

374
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:11,782
Thanks for stopping by.

375
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:13,760
We're gonna get you out of here.
Just hang tight.

376
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:15,119
Is there another option?

377
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:17,555
Don't mean to rush you, Raymond,
but it's getting cold in here.

378
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,289
Normally,
I wouldn't complain, but...

379
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:20,809
Can't you just
open the doors, Gideon?

380
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,060
GIDEON: <i>The bulkhead is designed</i>

381
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,724
<i>to remain shut
until the breach is sealed.</i>

382
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,312
Well, that's not happening
from in here.

383
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:26,714
How much time do we have until--

384
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,923
We're dead?

385
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:31,552
(GRUNTS)

386
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:40,102
Captain Baxter, I'm Rip Hunter.
I'm here to rescue you.

387
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,771
I doubt it.
You walked straight into a trap.

388
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,298
I will admit
that we've encountered

389
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,860
some unforeseen obstacles.

390
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,027
Right.

391
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:50,755
RIP: <i>But we're gonna get you
out of here in a second.</i>

392
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:52,059
Mr. Jackson, will you please see

393
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:53,800
what we can do about
disabling this force field.

394
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:55,104
You don't think I've tried that?

395
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,860
But by all means, if you think

396
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,955
this kid
will have better luck...

397
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:01,540
Whoa! Who you calling kid?

398
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:03,292
I'm sorry. I meant criminal.

399
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:05,586
- Actually, that's me.
- All of you.

400
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:07,355
If we ever do get out of here,
the first thing I'll do

401
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:08,881
is take you
to the Vanishing Point

402
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,883
to await trial
before the Time Council.

403
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:15,637
The great Rip Hunter.
But look at you now.

404
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,139
Yes, look at me now.

405
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:18,825
Helping you break out
of a pirates' brig

406
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,058
aboard your own Timeship.

407
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,728
I don't want help from a man
who broke his oath,

408
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:23,979
stole a Timeship,

409
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:27,316
and decided to change history
for his own selfish reasons.

410
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:30,694
<i>Doesn't make any sense to me.</i>

411
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:33,697
No, I don't expect it would.

412
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,534
Rip Hunter.

413
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:40,204
Miranda Coburn.

414
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,332
Those aren't your real names,
are they?

415
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:44,958
No, sir.

416
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,752
And why is that?

417
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,881
Because if our enemies
knew our true identities,

418
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:53,091
our ancestors and descendants
across the timeline

419
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,426
could be potential targets.

420
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:56,887
As well as anyone else
you might love.

421
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:58,388
<i>Which is why...</i>

422
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,275
Personal attachments
are expressly forbidden

423
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,683
by the Council of Time Masters.

424
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,561
And grounds for immediate
discharge from service.

425
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,563
Do either of you deny

426
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,370
that you were conducting
an illicit affair

427
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:10,400
in violation
of this Council's rules?

428
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:14,738
In that case,

429
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:16,198
I motion that we adjourn

430
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:18,575
this disciplinary hearing
for one hour

431
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:21,954
<i>to afford you the opportunity
to consider your response.</i>

432
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:26,083
Though I sincerely doubt there
is any answer you can provide

433
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:29,586
that will prevent this tribunal
from discharging you both

434
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,088
from the Time Masters.

435
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:43,267
SARA: <i>I suppose this feels like
a day at the beach for you.</i>

436
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:46,770
If I had to pick a way to die,
freezing wouldn't be the worst.

437
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:51,441
What's it like, dying?

438
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:55,612
I imagine you've got
a unique perspective.

439
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:56,989
It's funny.

440
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:01,201
You'd expect it
to be terrifying,

441
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:04,288
just panic and fear.

442
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:07,040
What did you feel?

443
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,461
I guess, lonely.

444
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:14,381
Yeah.

445
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:18,176
Like everybody I loved
was a million miles away.

446
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:22,681
I mean, I don't like you,

447
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:24,474
but at least
I'm not dying alone.

448
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:26,435
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

449
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:32,357
Closest I ever came to dying
was the day I met Mick.

450
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:36,320
- Why does that not surprise me?
- It wasn't like that.

451
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,322
It was my first day in juvie.

452
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,617
I was 14, and the smallest kid
in there by far.

453
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,870
Some of the older kids
wanted to make sure I knew it.

454
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:48,206
So, they jumped me.

455
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:52,210
I fought back,
but one of them had a shiv.

456
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,505
I figured that was it.

457
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:58,008
Until Mick stepped in.

458
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:01,386
And they didn't mess
with me after that.

459
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,850
He's been standing up
for me ever since.

460
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:12,064
Let's just hope he's standing up
for Rip and Jax now.

461
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,566
Who else is gonna
take on those pirates?

462
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:22,324
GUARD: Hey!

463
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:27,704
(GRUNTING)

464
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,215
That'll teach you to mess
with a nuclear physicist.

465
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:41,510
Are you ready?

466
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:43,757
Given I never designed
the Atom suit for outer space,

467
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,807
I'm not exactly sure
how to answer that question.

468
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:47,349
While I'm gone, you're captain.

469
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:48,725
Thank you.

470
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:51,269
But I think we both know
I'm in charge either way.

471
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,397
- (CHUCKLES)
- Good luck.

472
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:56,608

474
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,707
Sorry, Captain.
I can't jerry-rig the door open.

475
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:14,918
Don't worry, kid,
it's not your fault. It's his.

476
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,445
In case you've forgotten,
Mr. Rory,

477
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,523
you volunteered to be part
of this boarding party.

478
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:20,924
I volunteered to get away
from my partner.

479
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:23,051
Who hasn't been
acting like my partner

480
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:24,302
ever since you fed his head

481
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:26,263
with fairy tales
about saving the world.

482
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,265
Your partner has
a mind of his own, Mr. Rory.

483
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:29,933
Which is more than
I can say of you.

484
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,536
Are you saying
that I'm dumb, Captain?

485
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,840
Let's pretend, just for a moment

486
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:35,439
that you're the captain,
stuck in the brig,

487
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:36,685
<i>while the rest of your crew</i>

488
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:38,233
<i>slowly perish
on their damaged ship.</i>

489
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,735
Now, what would you do

490
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:41,461
to get yourself
out of that predicament?

491
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:44,781
Oh, no brilliant ideas? Really?

492
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,508
Why am I not
in the least bit surprised?

493
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:47,951
Shut your mouth. Now!

494
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:50,162
Okay. Let's all
just take a deep breath.

495
00:22:50,328 --> 00:22:52,488
Or what? You'll punch me
in the face, or burn me alive,

496
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,624
or employ some other
barbaric form of violence?

497
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,127
That's why you recruited me,
isn't it?

498
00:22:57,294 --> 00:22:58,503
To hit, hurt, and burn?

499
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,148
No. I recruited you
because you and your partner

500
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:01,423
were a package deal.

501
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:02,841
What?

502
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:04,801
I'm sorry, Mr. Rory,
but a serial arsonist

503
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,568
was never part of my plan
to stop Savage.

504
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:08,930
Much less
one with the IQ of meat.

505
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:12,267
I didn't mean to be so blunt.

506
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,145
If I can just have
a moment of quiet,

507
00:23:15,312 --> 00:23:16,688
then perhaps
I can think of a way

508
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:18,815
of getting us
off this pirate ship.

509
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:22,861
I think I just beat you to it.

510
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,323
Can anyone hear me?

511
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,675
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

512
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,826
Me and the pirates
are gonna have a little parley.

513
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:32,370
- Do not do this, Rory.
- Too late.

514
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:34,164
What do you want?

515
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:36,124
I wanna speak to Captain Valor.

516
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,835
- About what?
- About a Timeship.

517
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:41,046
I am warning you.

518
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:42,464
Shut up!

519
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:48,053
I may have the IQ of meat,
but I know how to cut a deal.

You want the <i>Waverider,</i>
I want to go home.

524
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:20,983
And where is home
for a man like you?

525
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:23,547
2016 Central City.

526
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:26,716
Of all the places and time,
you want to go there?

527
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:28,218
That's right.

528
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,720
To the exact moment Hunter
recruited me and my partner

529
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:33,640
on this suicidal mission of his.

530
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:38,061
But this time, I'm gonna
tell him where to shove it.

VALOR: <i>Let me get this straight.</i>

I let you go,
you'll deliver the <i>Waverider?</i>

00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:47,445
Yes. Do we have an accord?

You think your friends will believe
you were able to escape?

Why didn't you?

553

Without me to keep him in check,

Mick can be a scary guy.

Agreed.

556
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,218
Hate to break it to you,

557
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:53,428
but even if we make it
out of here alive,

558
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:56,431
you're still gonna have
a problem on your hands.

559
00:25:56,932 --> 00:26:00,352
I've seen enough to know that
Mick's in a dark place.

560
00:26:00,936 --> 00:26:02,437
He's not coming back.

Man, I can't believe
Rory sold us out.

No, actually, I can.

But still, man.

564
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:17,994
What choice did he have?

565
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:21,498
The crew left on the <i>Waverider</i>
are most probably dead by now,

566
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:24,125
and God knows what happened
to Professor Stein.

567
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:27,087
It's no wonder that Mr. Rory
tried to save his own skin.

568
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,506
And what can I do about it?

569
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:31,049
I'm stuck in a pirates' brig

570
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:33,760
and I've lost both my ship
and the loyalty of my crew.

571
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:36,012
You're one to talk
about loyalty.

572
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,639
But I am, Captain Baxter,

573
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:39,224
and not because
I pledged an oath

574
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:40,642
to serve as a Time Master.

575
00:26:42,143 --> 00:26:46,064
But a long time ago, I made
a far more important oath.

(SCOFFS)

577
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:52,654
When you call me a failure,
Captain Baxter, you're right.

578
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:56,825
Because I've failed
both my wife and my son.

579
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:03,415
For betraying the Time Council,
I have absolutely no regrets.

580
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:08,295
But failing to save my family...

581
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:16,219
That is something for which
I will never forgive myself.

582
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:24,269
Time Master Declan?

583
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,981
I thought the tribunal
was reconvening.

584
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:30,859
It's been canceled.

585
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:32,986
Lieutenant Coburn assumed

586
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:35,405
full responsibility
for the affair,

587
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:38,450
and the other Time Masters
were moved by her argument.

588
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:40,618
They've dismissed the charges?

589
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,537
Once Lieutenant Coburn resigned.

590
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:45,874
Why would she do that?

591
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,876
It seems she believes in you.

592
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:50,837
Now you must prove to yourself,
and all of us,

593
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:53,757
that you are indeed
the man she believes you to be.

Told you.

Those pirates picked
the wrong guy to mess with.

663

Since when does Rory even know
how to fly the Jumpship?

- Yes.
- Go to it, get off the <i>Acheron.</i>

I have some unfinished business

So, what's the plan, Captain?

Valor and his men
substantially outnumber us.

00:39:02,258 --> 00:39:04,885
I hope you think of me
when that day comes.

789
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:06,554
I will.

790
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:10,016
Because I'll be with you.

791
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:24,113
Hey. I was just looking
for you right now.

792
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,698
How are you feeling?

793
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:27,199
Good. Yeah.

794
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:30,077
Turns out I bounce back
pretty quickly from hypothermia.

795
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:32,079
In fact, I managed to remember

796
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:33,873
some of the things
you said to me

797
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,624
when I was almost dead.

798
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:38,836
You were wrong, BTW.

799
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:42,131
You don't need me.
You don't need anybody.

800
00:39:42,298 --> 00:39:45,593
You're pretty amazing,
and I'm lucky to be your friend,

801
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,080
be on this mission
together with--

802
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:58,064
That's surprising.

803
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,489
Okay, I'll say it.

804
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:09,992
Why don't we just drop him off
back in 2016?

805
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:13,329
Because my sister lives in 2016,

806
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:16,457
and your sister and your wife.

807
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:18,542
So, what exactly
are we talking about here?

808
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:21,003
Leaving Rory in the brig
until we take down Savage?

809
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,338
Oh, no, no, no.

810
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:25,007
The brig is unsuitable
for long-term incarcerations.

811
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:27,635
Giving him a free run
of the ship is not an option.

812
00:40:27,802 --> 00:40:28,803
I'll handle it.

813
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:30,805
By "handling it,"
you mean murder.

814
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:33,516
I said I'll handle it.

815

(SIGHS)

818
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:57,206
I told you that'll be
the last time you hit me.

819
00:40:57,373 --> 00:40:58,374
(GUN POWERS UP)

820
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,334
You were right.

821
00:41:01,752 --> 00:41:03,587
That's the plan?

822
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:06,382
Take me out
in the middle of nowhere,

823
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:08,676
where no one can find the body?

824
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:13,806
I wish there was
some other way, Mick,

825
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:15,516
but you're dangerous.

826
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:18,227
A liability to the team.

827
00:41:18,394 --> 00:41:19,395
Team?

828
00:41:19,854 --> 00:41:21,438
You and I were a team.

829
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:24,900
What happened to you?

830
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:29,572
People change.

831
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:32,074
You think
you're some kind of hero,

832
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:36,912
but deep down, you're still the
same punk kid I saved in juvie.

833
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,582
You haven't got the guts.

834
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:42,084
You wanna kill me?

835
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:44,170
<i>Kill me.</i>

836
00:41:45,796 --> 00:41:49,049
Only one of us
is walking outta here alive.

837
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:55,806
You're right.

838
