1
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,328
Yes.

2
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,753
You failed.

3
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:32,837
I didn't.

4
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,008
The gun is in my hand.

5
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,260
I thought I had it.

6
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,973
Sorry, Father. I'll make it next time.

7
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,184
Never take anything for granted.

8
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,937
God will take it from you.

9
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,190
Is God bad?

10
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,820
God is fair.

11
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,118
You almost got me, didn't you, boy?

12
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,974
Did I get my white hair from you

13
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,225
or from Mom?

14
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,396
From your mother.

15
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,940
I can't believe
we don't have any pictures of her.

16
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,734
Everything was destroyed in the fire.

17
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:37,819
You know that.

18
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,946
I could only save you.

19
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,161
Was she beautiful?

20
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,750
She was smart.

21
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,504
Like you.

22
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,174
How many did I get?

23
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,341
All of them.

24
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,805
So I get to go to town today, right?

25
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,477
You failed survival.

26
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,314
It's been three months.

27
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,526
Plus, I just gave you a killer haircut.

28
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,612
Trust me.

29
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,366
You need to pass all your tests first.

30
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,548
All right, apart from the usual,

31
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:43,259
I have an order of five ferns,

32
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,552
two ficuses,

33
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:47,096
and the Columnea grandiosa.

34
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:48,890
Gloriosa.

35
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,350
Gloriosa.

36
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,394
Am I taking Phoenix today?

37
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,562
Not today.

38
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,813
It's been a while.

39
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,524
I said, no.

40
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,947
You either loosen up that leash,

41
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,366
or sooner or later, she'll bite it off.

42
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,006
Go with Hernandez.

43
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,221
Back by sunset!

44
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,222
I will.

45
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,353
Hey, Hernandez.

46
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,521
Hey, gorgeous.

47
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,990
Fly, bird

48
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,158
Fly, bird

49
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,370
All across the mighty sea

50
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,955
Sing, girl

51
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:58,126
Sing your little heart out for me

52
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,210
That's beautiful.

53
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,296
You made that up?

54
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,174
I think my mom sang it to me
when I was little.

55
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,844
That first part's all I remember.

56
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,470
You wanna pay her a visit?

57
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,226
-But my father doesn't want--
-I won't tell if you don't.

58
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,474
Fly, bird

59
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,351
Fly, bird

60
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:18,039
Police have issued a statewide alert
for this man, Dr. Thomas Hanniman.

61
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,290
He's believed to be running

62
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,751
an organ trafficking ring
in the Detroit area.

63
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:22,669
Thank you.

64
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,130
The alarming number of abductions
has recently risen in the city.

65
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,382
This is a developing story.

66
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,093
We'll update you
as more information comes to light.

67
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,845
Now let's take a look
at the weekend forecast.

68
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,890
Good morning, everyone.
I'm meteorologist Jerry...

69
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,483
Everyone, pull.

70
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,567
Help me.

71
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,028
It's stuck.

72
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,616
Hey, wanna try something?

73
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,410
Okay.

74
00:08:58,746 --> 00:08:59,580
Do it.

75
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:10,675
Faster, faster.

76
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,051
I'm getting dizzy.

77
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,895
Hey, guys. Come on in. Dinner.

78
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,023
I don't wanna go inside.

79
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,275
Come on, guys!

80
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,778
"Covenant Shelter."

81
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:32,864
Race you.

82
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,240
Hey, wait up!

83
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,414
You having fun?

84
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,916
All right, let's go.

85
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,251
I need to pee.

86
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,463
Okay, well, be quick.
I don't wanna anger your father.

87
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,720
Fly, bird

88
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,638
Fly, bird

89
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,725
All across the mighty sea

90
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,351
Sing, girl

91
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,689
Sing your little heart out for me

92
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,743
Wow, you're pretty.

93
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,498
What's your name, gorgeous?

94
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,582
Mine's Raylan.

95
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,585
I don't care.

96
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,089
I need to go. My father's waiting for me.

97
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,811
I snap my fingers
and he'll bite your testicles off.

98
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:48,981
Okay.

99
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,152
Well, I'm sorry if I scared you.

100
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:54,946
Who said you did?

101
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,334
I'll see you around.

102
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,336
Come on, Shadow.

103
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,637
You okay?

104
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,721
Yes.

105
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,390
Just a weirdo.

106
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,474
Yeah.

107
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,602
No shortage of those around here.

108
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:41,868
Follow them.

109
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,880
Thanks, Hernandez.

110
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,258
We had a lot of fun today.

111
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,552
I'll take her again next week
if you're okay with it.

112
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,469
No.

113
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,096
Today was enough.

114
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,813
-It's none of my business, but--
-You're right.

115
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,232
It's not.

116
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,653
You're a bad man.

117
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,075
A man who's done terrible things.

118
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,041
At least, I know you think that.

119
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,002
Just like sometimes I do about myself.

120
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,797
War changes us all.

121
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,426
No soul returns holy from it.

122
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,430
Don't make her pay for that.

123
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,268
Thanks.

124
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:05,177
You mind moving your vehicle
off the road, please?

125
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,637
This is...

126
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,809
This is the only road back to town.

127
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,729
You served?

128
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,813
Yeah.

129
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,565
We all did too.

130
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,068
-Iraq?
-Yeah.

131
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:24,780
Dishonorably discharged
from a dishonorable war.

132
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,911
I'd say that makes us honorable somehow.
Wouldn't you?

133
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:32,621
No.

134
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,585
Can you move your truck off the road now?

135
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,631
Sure, baby.

136
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,800
Whatever you want.

137
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,584
Lessons next month.

138
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,628
Okay.

139
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,464
I wanna go to school next year.

140
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,511
-This is school--
-A real school, with other kids like me.

141
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,179
Home school is safer.

142
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,140
I don't wanna be safe.

143
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,017
I wanna be normal. I wanna have friends.

144
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,769
-I wanna live a--
-Enough!

145
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:20,396
Enough.

146
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,317
I already lost a daughter once.

147
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,069
I'm not losing you.

148
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,863
But I'm lonely.

149
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,284
You have no idea what it is to be alone.

150
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,120
You have me.

151
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,792
You're not enough.

152
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,898
"Covenant Shelter.

153
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,734
Your new home awaits you."

154
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,353
Shadow?

155
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,190
Shadow?

156
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,230
Shadow.

157
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:49,655
Oh, God.

158
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,071
The box! Now!

159
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:57,949
Go!

160
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,468
Go get the girl.

161
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:32,859
Open the door.

162
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,654
Open up!

163
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,885
What the fuck?

164
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,891
Hang on, brother.

165
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:24,906
Open your jaw.

166
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,409
Stay still.

167
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:33,540
Breathe, brother.

168
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,476
The guy's a Navy SEAL.

169
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,660
Fucking dead SEAL, bro.

170
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,556
Better get out of there, kid.

171
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,278
He's down there with you!

172
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,156
Blind fuck is down there!

173
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,342
Call Raylan.

174
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,589
Metal box is almost full of water.

175
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,969
You prefer to see the kid alive...

176
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,056
you come in here.

177
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,394
You think I'm fucking with you?

178
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:46,983
No.

179
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,988
There's a live wire
about to reach the water.

180
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,573
Come out, or she's fried!

181
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,007
Clever fuck.

182
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,218
No guns, huh?

183
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:15,637
No problem.

184
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,335
You're tough.

185
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,671
But you're done.

186
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,143
What the fuck?

187
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,187
Yo, bro.

188
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,017
Breathe.

189
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,102
Come on, breathe.

190
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:35,563
Breathe.

191
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:36,981
Breathe.

192
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,781
The old blind man did this?

193
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,412
Let's go.

194
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,180
I can walk.

195
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,224
I said, I can walk.

196
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,436
What's happening?

197
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:28,699
Cover the exits.

198
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,547
What the fuck?

199
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,285
They're still down here.

200
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,691
What's happening?

201
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,153
-Who are they?
-I don't know.

202
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,450
You don't need to be afraid, little girl.

203
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,747
This has all just been
one big misunderstanding.

204
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,552
It's not me you need to be scared of...

205
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,061
but the man standing next to you.

206
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,982
Now, I don't know who he is.

207
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,196
But I know who he's not.

208
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,665
Should I tell her or you?

209
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,173
Finish him, bro.

210
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,050
No!

211
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,303
-Dad! Dad, wake up.
-Aren't you something?

212
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,640
Let me go!

213
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,810
Come on.

214
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,812
No, it's okay.

215
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,192
Yeah, there you go.

216
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:51,652
There you go.

217
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,072
You don't remember me, do you?

218
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,617
Maybe this will help.

219
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,087
See?

220
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,135
What...?

221
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,599
Years ago, there was a fire in our house.

222
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,768
Cops blamed me.

223
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,521
I spent eight years in prison,
wondering if I'd ever see you again.

224
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,737
I didn't even know
if you were dead or alive.

225
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,993
This creep here must have...

226
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,038
found you and kept you for himself.

227
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,208
Up next in local news,

228
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:50,753
a meth lab caught fire
in west Detroit this morning.

229
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,547
Police were able
to arrest the primary suspect.

230
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,550
The man was taken into custody
and could face charges

231
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,720
for a large number of crimes committed
over the past several years.

232
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:03,015
You have no idea how much
I've been waiting for this moment.

233
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,366
Did he hurt you?

234
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:25,996
But he did steal you away from me,
and now he must die, you understand?

235
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:29,708
Kill him.

236
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,669
-No.
-Fuck are you doing?

237
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,130
Not in front of my kid. Do it outside.

238
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:44,056
Wake up, you blind fuck.

239
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:47,726
Fuck!

240
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,375
Fucking coward.

241
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:21,844
Take her to the truck
while I hunt this motherfucker. Let's go.

242
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,977
-Let me go!
-What's wrong with you?

243
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,438
Fucking wanna go home?

244
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,299
I don't care who you are.

245
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:02,468
I'm gonna teach you some fucking manners.

246
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,970
You ungrateful, little bitch.

247
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:24,990
No.

248
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:34,249
Stop.

249
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,126
Please!

250
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,462
Stop!

251
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,646
Move. Go, go.

252
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,439
Move. Now.

253
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:26,844
Move!

254
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:40,649
I'm sorry, man.

255
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,823
-He's back in the house.
- I know. He wants us to follow him.

256
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,077
Enough of these silly games.

257
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,096
It's his jacket.

258
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,183
Attaboy.

259
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:15,642
Attaboy.

260
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,645
Wait.

261
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,730
Stop.

262
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,567
Is it true?

263
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,777
Move.

264
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,361
What's my real name?

265
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,696
Get over here now!

266
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,156
When's my birthday?

267
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,158
-My real one?
-Stop it!

268
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,576
No, you stop it!

269
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,295
Go!

270
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:53,115
Hey.

271
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,613
Phoenix!

272
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,574
Calm down, girl.

273
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:21,286
Calm down.

274
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:42,766
Stay.

275
00:51:58,573 --> 00:51:59,825
Put her in the truck.

276
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:28,437
What are you doing?

277
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:31,898
-Your dog's in there.
-Dog's dead.

278
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,567
You don't know that.

279
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,193
You wanna go and find out?

280
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,668
No!

281
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:30,345
Good morning, princess.

282
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:40,146
How you feeling?

283
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:46,361
You all right?

284
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:49,781
Wanna sit with me?

285
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,451
Come, sit with me. Come on.

286
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,079
Yeah.

287
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:57,998
There you go.

288
00:56:58,707 --> 00:56:59,541
There you go.

289
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:01,751
Yeah.

290
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:09,593
Door's open.

291
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:12,929
Not a prisoner anymore.

292
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:17,309
You mean, I can go?

293
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,020
If you want.

294
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:25,692
Or you can stay here
and find out who you really are.

295
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:36,536
Do I have any brothers or sisters?

296
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,624
Unfortunately, no.

297
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,878
When's my birthday?

298
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,588
February 20th.

299
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,842
What was my mother's name?

300
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,220
Josephine.

301
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,057
Do I look like her?

302
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:01,978
Yeah.

303
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:05,523
You do.

304
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,152
Tara.

305
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:11,863
That's your real name.

306
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:14,783
Tara.

307
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,953
Everything that man told you is a lie.

308
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,498
What happened to him?

309
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,584
He got what he deserved.

310
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:29,172
Hey. I'm not sorry.

311
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,299
You shouldn't be either.

312
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:32,884
I wanna go.

313
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,304
Where? Where you gonna go?

314
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:38,098
There's a shelter I know.

315
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:43,520
Like I said,
you're not a prisoner anymore.

316
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:04,726
Fly, bird

317
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:13,777
Fly, bird

318
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:20,241
Out across the

319
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:26,539
Great wide sea

320
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:32,170
Sing, girl

321
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:36,841
Sing, girl

322
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:42,847
Sing your little heart out for me

323
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,976
Fly, bird

324
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:50,647
Fly, bird

325
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:57,237
Fly across the mighty cliffs

326
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:02,492
Sleep, girl

327
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:06,454
Sleep, girl

328
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:13,253
Mama's gonna give you a good-night kiss

329
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:18,508
Mom?

330
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:22,136
Like I said...

331
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:25,306
everything he told you was a lie.

332
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:39,404
My Tara?

333
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:48,079
You... got so big.

334
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:53,793
Can I hug you?

335
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,426
Come here.

336
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:04,596
Oh, God.

337
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:08,308
Oh, God.

338
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,646
Oh, God.

339
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,692
Oh, baby, we missed you so much.

340
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,576
There you are.

341
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:31,623
You were such a beautiful baby.

342
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:43,051
Get it out.

343
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:44,969
Get it out. Come on.

344
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:48,056
There you go. There you go.

345
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,390
-There you go.
-Sorry.

346
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:51,684
Nothing to apologize for.

347
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:54,562
Are you okay?

348
01:02:58,066 --> 01:03:01,235
The same fire that destroyed our family,

349
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:06,032
it burned up my insides.

350
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:13,498
Mom and Dad used to have a...

351
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:17,919
kitchen...

352
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,756
in the basement of our house,

353
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:24,550
where we used to cook.

354
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,765
It was for our business.

355
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,312
Are you thirsty?

356
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,161
Tara?

357
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:55,832
I'm dying.

358
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:56,749
What?

359
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:00,670
The smoke from the chemicals...

360
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:05,591
poisoned my blood
and badly damaged my heart.

361
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,553
I don't think I have much time left.

362
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,513
Is there anything you can do?

363
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:23,359
I heard you left flowers for me
at our old house.

364
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,364
Is that true?

365
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:40,209
Weren't you wishing
your mama was healthy and alive?

366
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:41,711
Yes.

367
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:57,435
I need a new heart, baby.

368
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:00,313
But not just any heart.

369
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,566
Doctor said, it has to be a...

370
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:06,569
It must be a...

371
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:09,781
compatible donor.

372
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:15,995
Like a direct relative.

373
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:21,626
You hold the gift
that can save your mama's life.

374
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,216
And, baby, I need that gift.

375
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:50,530
We'll finally be together as one.

376
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:57,411
You'll live on in me.

377
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:27,525
Go home.

378
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:21,806
Go away.

379
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:25,101
I said, go.

380
01:08:33,401 --> 01:08:34,235
Stay.

381
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:38,572
Stay.

382
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:11,772
Go home.

383
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,158
Go home.

384
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:06,952
I hope you understand
the high risks of this procedure.

385
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:10,247
I think I pay you enough.

386
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:11,916
Shut up and do your job.

387
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,211
Why is she still alive?

388
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,964
If she's dead so is her heart.

389
01:10:20,674 --> 01:10:24,345
I can't keep it fresh long enough
without the proper equipment.

390
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,599
I have to cut it out of her
while she's still breathing.

391
01:10:30,976 --> 01:10:31,811
Hey.

392
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:34,313
Hey, hey, hey.

393
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:36,023
Hey, hey.

394
01:10:39,443 --> 01:10:40,444
Thank you.

395
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,675
What's wrong with you?

396
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,846
What they're doing in there is wrong.

397
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:09,807
She's our cook.

398
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:13,853
If she dies, there's no product.

399
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:17,022
If there's no product, there's no us.

400
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,613
Still fucking wrong.

401
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:33,664
Hey.

402
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:36,208
You ready?

403
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:41,213
Let's go.

404
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:06,864
What the fuck?

405
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:13,913
Go check it out.

406
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:33,617
You killed my brother!

407
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:37,037
You blind freak!

408
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:02,938
I'm gonna carve your fucking head open
like a pumpkin, man.

409
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:01,163
This is for Shadow.

410
01:15:03,248 --> 01:15:04,083
Oh, fuck.

411
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:06,085
No!

412
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:13,884
It's him.

413
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:22,226
How the hell did he find...?

414
01:15:40,577 --> 01:15:42,496
Disloyal fucking animal.

415
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:44,039
Is everything okay?

416
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,043
Yeah, everything's okay.

417
01:15:48,585 --> 01:15:51,588
-Everything's okay, I promise.
-Baby, should I be worried?

418
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:53,340
No, no. Not at all.

419
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:54,842
I got you. I got you.

420
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:56,719
I can't work without power.

421
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:00,973
Change of plans, then.

422
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:04,226
Pack your things. Bring the girl.

423
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:05,185
Raul.

424
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:09,648
-Bring the men. Kill the blind man.
-How many of us?

425
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:11,525
All of you!

426
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:16,321
Let's go.

427
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:50,791
They're gonna kill her.

428
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:57,714
And that's not cool with me.

429
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:02,761
They're leaving now.

430
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:06,890
The ladder behind you leads
directly to them. You'd better hurry.

431
01:18:21,405 --> 01:18:22,239
Go left.

432
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:24,950
That way.

433
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:29,997
He'll kill you all.

434
01:18:39,923 --> 01:18:40,966
Fuck it. I'm out.

435
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:42,092
Hey, hey!

436
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:43,010
Hey!

437
01:19:08,493 --> 01:19:10,203
Good morning, motherfucker.

438
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:15,667
Baby.

439
01:19:16,668 --> 01:19:17,628
It's okay.

440
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:18,754
Stop it.

441
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:53,497
Baby?

442
01:19:55,415 --> 01:19:56,500
Hello?

443
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:57,834
I can't see you.

444
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:08,512
Baby?

445
01:20:41,586 --> 01:20:43,171
Someone's here! Hurry!

446
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:45,924
Baby?

447
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:11,533
I got you, motherfucker.

448
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:24,254
No.

449
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:25,964
No!

450
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:27,466
No!

451
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:37,184
No.

452
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:40,687
No!

453
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:34,116
Phoenix!

454
01:23:07,482 --> 01:23:08,441
Now...

455
01:23:09,442 --> 01:23:11,319
you're gonna see

456
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:12,821
what I see.

457
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:04,414
Phoenix?

458
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:16,426
Stop.

459
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:18,470
Stop!

460
01:24:21,973 --> 01:24:22,807
You...

461
01:24:25,685 --> 01:24:27,520
You mustn't come near me.

462
01:24:33,985 --> 01:24:37,656
Everything he said...

463
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:41,952
is true.

464
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:51,086
I am no father.

465
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:57,968
I have killed.

466
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:04,808
I...

467
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:07,519
have raped.

468
01:25:08,812 --> 01:25:09,646
I...

469
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:14,609
am nothing.

470
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:21,449
Nothing...

471
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:25,203
but a monster.

472
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:32,585
And you...

473
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:35,338
cannot be around me.

474
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:38,300
Ever.

475
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:41,720
So go.

476
01:25:45,265 --> 01:25:46,725
Now. Go.

477
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:49,269
Go!

478
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:23,094
Oh, God.

479
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:13,895
Tara?

480
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,254
No.

481
01:27:41,714 --> 01:27:42,549
No.

482
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:44,092
No.

483
01:27:48,888 --> 01:27:49,722
Please.

484
01:27:55,019 --> 01:27:56,855
No, no, no.

485
01:27:58,481 --> 01:27:59,524
Let me help you.

486
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:02,902
I can save you.

487
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:10,743
You already have.

488
01:29:56,099 --> 01:29:56,933
Hey.

489
01:29:59,227 --> 01:30:00,061
Hey.

490
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:03,565
Think there's room for one more?

491
01:30:05,108 --> 01:30:06,192
I'm sure there is.

492
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:09,237
What's your name?

493
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:15,493
My name is Phoenix.
