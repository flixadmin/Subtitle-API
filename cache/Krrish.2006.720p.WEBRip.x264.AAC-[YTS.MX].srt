3
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:50,625
What a mess!

4
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:58,667
Krishna. Krishna.

5
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,792
What am I going to do with this boy?

6
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:28,500
Krishna.

7
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, grandma?

8
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,042
Whose sketch book is this?

9
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:33,542
Mine, grandma.

10
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,750
And who made these sketches?

11
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:40,000
Grandma, why do grown ups
sometimes ask childish questions?

12
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,875
If it's my sketch book, obviously,
I've made the sketches.

13
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,667
Grown ups talk like children
when children act like grown ups.

14
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,417
Tell me something, how did
you make such beautiful sketches?

15
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:54,792
With this.

16
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:58,167
Like I've made your
sketch right now. See?

17
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:02,625
Wow! Let me see!

18
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:08,917
Rohit loved drawing too.

19
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:10,792
Papa made sketches too?

20
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,292
Yes.

21
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:18,292
When Rohit was your age and
he used to get tired studying,

22
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:20,292
he used to sketch.

23
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,792
I want to be like my Papa too.

24
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:26,542
You are like your Papa!

25
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,625
Mrs. Mehra, I've called
you here to tell you that...

26
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,917
we want to take Krishna's I.Q. test.

27
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:36,792
I.Q. test?

28
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,292
But why, Father?

29
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:42,042
Krishna's absolutely normal.

30
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:44,292
No, Mrs. Mehra.

31
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:45,792
He's not normal.

32
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,417
What are you saying, Father?

33
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:50,750
Are you telling me...

34
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:54,167
that Krishna is the same
as Rohit was in his childhood?

35
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:56,917
No, Father.

36
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:59,042
Krishna's a very bright child.

37
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:03,875
He scores very good marks,
he always gets A-plus grades.

38
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:07,417
He even does his homework
without any help.

39
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,292
And that of other children too.

40
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:11,667
What?

41
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:14,792
This is the notebook
of a Class Three student.

42
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,292
This is...

43
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:23,750
Krishna's handwriting.

44
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,750
Yes, Krishna has done
this child's math homework.

45
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:36,417
But, how's that possible, Father?
Krishna's still in Class One.

46
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,500
That's exactly why we wish
to take Krishna's I.Q. test,

47
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:47,500
so that we can ascertain just
how bright, sharp and ahead he is

48
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:49,375
of other children his age.

49
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:52,750
Krishna, how do you define amount?

50
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:57,542
Principle plus interest
is equal to amount, sir.

51
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:03,542
After what age does the
brain of a person stop growing?

52
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,250
After the age of 15, Father.

53
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:27,875
What happened, Mrs. Mehra?

54
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:30,500
The I.Q. test was going so well.

55
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,542
Krishna was answering
all of the questions right.

56
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:37,417
That's exactly why I brought him away.

57
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:39,042
But why?

58
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:43,042
You ought to be proud that
your grandson is so brilliant.

59
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,750
He's a genius, a miracle child.

60
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:52,917
Earlier it was a hunch, but now I'm sure.

61
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:56,542
The powers that Jadoo
had bestowed on Rohit,

62
00:04:57,042 --> 00:05:02,167
have been inherited by Krishna.

63
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,292
You will see, Mrs. Mehra. Like his father,

64
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:10,875
Krishna will also achieve great success.

65
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:13,542
His name will appear in the Guinness Book,

66
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:17,292
and the whole world
will speak highly of him.

67
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:21,292
That's exactly what I don't want, Father.

68
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,667
What did Rohit gain, after all?

69
00:05:28,042 --> 00:05:30,167
They gave him medals, applauded him,

70
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:34,667
but everybody only used him,

71
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,417
took advantage of him, Father.

72
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:40,625
And then...

73
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,750
I lost my son and my daughter-in-law.

74
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,625
I don't want to lose Krishna now.

75
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:56,667
I don't want to lose him.

76
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,167
I can understand your concern and fears.

77
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,167
But destiny cannot be changed.

78
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:11,292
And talent is a gift
which cannot be hidden.

79
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:13,792
I will hide it, Father.

80
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:20,042
I'll take Krishna far away...

81
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,042
very far.

82
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:18,250
Krishna. Krishna.

83
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,917
Coming, Grandma!

84
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:29,042
Toofan, let's see who gets home first.

85
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,917
Hey, what did you see?

86
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,917
As usual, I've seen nothing
and I won't say a word to anyone.

87
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,042
But as usual,
I'll take something from you.

88
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,417
Take this!

89
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:43,667
I hide all your secrets
and you always give me jaggery?

90
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,792
It won't work today.

91
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:49,000
Okay, okay, come home.
I'll give you Bournvita.

92
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:50,167
Bournvita?

93
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:53,542
-Yes. Don't you want to be like me?
-Yes!

94
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,667
So go, wear something below and come.

95
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,417
Krishna.

96
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:11,542
You've come?

97
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,542
Grandma, how do you know I've come?

98
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,292
I made no sound at all!

99
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:20,625
I can hear your heartbeats.

100
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,625
But how, Grandma?

101
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:28,125
Your eyes say that you've
been up to mischief again.

102
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:33,042
Mischief? Not at all, Grandma!

103
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:38,042
No mischief? Then why are
you hiding your face like a thief?

104
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:40,542
Not hiding,
just washing my face, Grandma.

105
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay, lay the breakfast.

106
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,625
I've come!

107
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:10,542
I'm back.

108
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:16,042
What happened? What did you drop?

109
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,625
Chintu dropped a glass, Grandma.

110
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:23,000
Me?

111
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,375
Chintu! Up to mischief again?

112
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,417
Tell her the truth Krishna,
or else I shall.

113
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:32,167
Sure, go ahead.

114
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:34,667
I'll tell her since you've asked me to.

115
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:38,375
Grandma, Krishna was running
faster than Toofan today.

116
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,000
What? Faster than Toofan?

117
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:43,542
So? What's the big deal?

118
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:45,167
And how about that?

119
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:46,667
What?

120
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,542
You climbed the mountain
faster than the monkeys.

121
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:54,542
Grandma, you know that
tall mountain by the temple?

122
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:58,167
Krishna jumped from it into the river.

123
00:12:58,292 --> 00:13:00,917
I thought it was all over.
But he came back!

124
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:05,000
Krishna, why do you do such things?

125
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:09,792
I've forbidden you time and again!
Why do you still do such things?

126
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:12,042
What do I do Grandma? You tell me!

127
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,875
How do I rid myself of loneliness?

128
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,417
Who do I make friends with?

129
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:21,917
Boys my age have gone away to the city,

130
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:23,667
to either study or earn a living.

131
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,792
And those that are here don't
want to be friends with me.

132
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,792
They say I'm not like them.

133
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:37,417
So, I've made friends
with animals and birds.

134
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:42,417
Keep myself busy with nature.

135
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,875
But even out here in the open,
I sometimes feel stifled.

136
00:13:49,417 --> 00:13:53,292
I feel like running far away from here.

137
00:13:56,542 --> 00:13:58,667
Will you leave me and go away?

138
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:06,375
It's because of you that I don't go!
Otherwise, I'd have left long ago.

139
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:23,542
Krishna has grown up, Rohit.

140
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:29,875
I'm not sure how long
I will be able to hide him.

141
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:36,042
Where is Sonia Mehra and
her grandson Krishna, Father?

142
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:41,292
It's the third time in so
many years that I've come to ask you.

143
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:44,167
And my answer is still the same.

144
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:49,542
I have no idea where Mrs. Mehra is.
I really don't know!

145
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,542
Why do you keep coming to
me again and again and waste my time?

146
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,667
Because you are the last
link to Rohit Mehra's family,

147
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:01,667
and you're the last person Sonia
Mehra met before she went missing.

148
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,792
You know where they are,
but you're lying.

149
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,667
-What?
-Yes.

150
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,417
You are lying, Father.

151
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:17,000
When I asked you whether Krishna
possessed the powers Rohit had,

152
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,042
you said he didn't.

153
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:23,750
But I was told that the
son was better than his father.

154
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,875
That he possesses all of
Rohit's powers. So tell me, Father,

155
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,417
I'll pay any price you ask.

156
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:34,750
How dare you!
Mr. Sinha, this is a school!

157
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,250
We don't indulge in business here!

158
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:39,292
Please, leave now!

159
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:45,667
You're making a mistake, Father.
A big mistake.

160
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,417
Krishna! Look!

161
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:02,792
What a huge kite!

162
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,792
But where's the string?

163
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:07,667
Must've snapped. Let's get it!

164
00:16:09,917 --> 00:16:11,042
Catch!

165
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:13,500
Krishna, catch!

166
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:19,542
Krishna!

167
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:14,000
Don't scream! You needn't be afraid.

168
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,500
Close your eyes and hold me tightly? Okay?

169
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:40,250
Stop screaming!

170
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:42,792
Else, I'll drop you.

171
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,417
Close your eyes.

172
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,917
Close your eyes, not widen them.

173
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:52,667
Close them! Close!

174
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:12,250
-Priya!
-Priya!

175
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:14,250
The glider came this way!

176
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,750
There it is!

177
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,625
-Where?
-Where?

178
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,542
Sir. Up there!

179
00:19:21,042 --> 00:19:23,417
Oh my God! Where's Priya?

180
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,542
There!

181
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:33,042
-What happened?
-What happened?

182
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,042
She's breathing.
She must've passed out.

183
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,167
-Thank God.
-Let's take her back to the camp.

184
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:41,167
Pick her up.

185
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:51,167
The glider was at such a height,
Priya Ma'am was down here...

186
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,375
and she's still breathing?

187
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,292
Where am I?

188
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:28,417
You're alive and you're with us.

189
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:30,417
Thank God you're alive.

190
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,542
Not God,
it's that boy we ought to thank.

191
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:38,042
That boy? Which boy?

192
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:41,667
The one who saved my life.

193
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,667
A boy saved you?

194
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,625
-Yes, sir.
-But there was no one there!

195
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:51,292
No sir! He must've been there!
We fell from the tree together.

196
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,875
Together?
But you went in the glider alone.

197
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,875
How did he come up the tree to rescue you?

198
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:00,542
Did he fall from the skies?

199
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,417
Yes sir. That's where he came from!

200
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:07,792
-But--
-She's right!

201
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,125
-Ghost!
-What happened?

202
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:15,667
Ghost!

203
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:19,417
Komal sir, ghost!

204
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:21,542
Ghost?

205
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:28,625
Run. Run. Run. Run. Run. Run!

206
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,042
What are you blabbering, Bahadur?

207
00:21:32,667 --> 00:21:36,042
No blabber, sir.
It's a chant. To drive the ghost away.

208
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,875
What rubbish, Bahadur?
Ghost in broad daylight?

209
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:45,417
This is a jungle, sir!
Night and day are all the same here.

210
00:21:45,542 --> 00:21:47,542
Priya ma'am, was he tall?

211
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:48,750
Yes.

212
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:50,792
Well built?

213
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,042
Yes!

214
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:54,292
-Fair-skinned?
-Yes!

215
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:56,375
-Kalicharan!
-Kalicharan?

216
00:21:57,542 --> 00:22:01,500
-Kalicharan?
-Yes, sir! Kalicharan's ghost!

217
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:07,042
He has been wandering in the mountains for
ages and hanging upside down on the trees.

218
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:10,292
A ghost in our times?

219
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,167
What happened?

220
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:26,417
Sir, it's either a sprain or a fracture.

221
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh no!

222
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,250
We're here on a ten day adventure camp,

223
00:22:30,542 --> 00:22:33,042
and you've already broken your foot!

224
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,875
Honey, take her into the
tent and give her first-aid.

225
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:48,625
Bahadur, go to your phone
booth and call for a car.

226
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:51,667
We need to send Priya
to the city for treatment.

227
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:54,042
I'll go at night, sir.
I feel scared by day.

228
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:58,500
-What?
-Yes! Kalicharan's ghost.

229
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:00,542
Scares people by day and sleeps at night.

230
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:04,042
Easy, easy Just relax.

231
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,042
You're always screaming!
Doesn't your throat hurt?

232
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:34,917
Your eyes are widening again!

233
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,667
You must never get scared--
Hey!

234
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:45,667
What happened, Priya?
Why were you screaming?

235
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:48,875
Honey, he was here!
In this room! He was here, Honey!

236
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,500
Who? Who was here?

237
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:53,917
The boy who saved me on the tree,

238
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,792
the one I told you about, sir!

239
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:57,292
God! What's happened to this girl?

240
00:23:59,917 --> 00:24:03,375
Priya, it's just two seconds since I left.

241
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:07,000
Are you saying that in the meantime,
someone came and then went away?

242
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:09,542
You must've dozed off and had a dream.

243
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:13,250
I didn't dream, Honey.
Why doesn't someone believe me?

244
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:16,250
The moment I closed my eyes,
he entered the tent,

245
00:24:16,417 --> 00:24:19,750
he twisted my ankle and the pain...

246
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:24,792
Hey! The pain in my ankle is gone! See!

247
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:26,417
The pain has disappeared!

248
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,875
Oh my God sir! My foot is all right!

249
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,167
Amazing.

250
00:24:31,292 --> 00:24:33,750
Look at this, I can jump!

251
00:24:33,917 --> 00:24:35,542
Oh my God. Look, I can jump!

252
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:37,292
My foot has healed!

253
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:40,875
Either this girl has really gone mad,
or she's conning us!

254
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:46,250
No, sir! I'm not conning you!
See, I can jump! Believe me!

255
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:50,375
I believe you!
Kalicharan has cured your foot.

256
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:54,542
Kalicharan?
So this ghost is also a doctor?

257
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:55,917
He isn't, but he was.

258
00:24:56,167 --> 00:25:00,042
Kalicharan's father, Lalcharan.
Doctor Lalcharan.

259
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:05,292
There's no Kalicharan, there's no
Lalcharan. It's all a pack of lies!

260
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:08,042
It's some stupid local
boy playing a prank on me.

261
00:25:08,292 --> 00:25:10,917
I'm going to find him today and
bring him before everybody,

262
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,292
and prove to them that
he's just another boy!

263
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:15,167
-Are you looking for someone?
-What?

264
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:19,250
You! I'm looking for you!

265
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,500
Where do you keep disappearing?

266
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:25,417
Why don't you appear before the
others as you appear before me?

267
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:29,125
And that stupid Bahadur keeps
telling them that you're Kalicharan!

268
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,542
You're not Kalicharan, are you?

269
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:34,875
You're human, aren't you?

270
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:40,792
Why are you kids giggling?

271
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,292
Who are you talking to, aunty?

272
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:47,792
Aunty? Firstly you call me aunty
and then you ask who I am speaking to?

273
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:49,667
I'm talking to this boy!

274
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,417
Which boy?

275
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:55,292
Can't you see this boy here?

276
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:58,417
That's a lamppost there, not a boy,

277
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:00,917
That's a boy.

278
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,250
-Lamppost.
-Boy!

279
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:04,917
-Lamppost!
-Shut up!

280
00:26:07,917 --> 00:26:09,167
One moment. Please Listen.

281
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:15,750
What do you see there?
A boy? Or a lamppost?

282
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:20,250
Well, there's neither
a boy there nor a lamppost.

283
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:21,417
Look carefully..

284
00:26:28,417 --> 00:26:29,792
What happened?

285
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:33,917
I'm feeling giddy.

286
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,042
You seem unwell.

287
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:40,667
My house is nearby,
come rest there for a while.

288
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:42,667
I'll get you a glass of water

289
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,125
Okay!

290
00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:54,792
Why is his picture garlanded?

291
00:26:56,792 --> 00:27:01,250
My son. He died 20 years ago.

292
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:07,292
But how's that possible? Moments ago, I...

293
00:27:32,042 --> 00:27:34,375
It's a tragic tale...

294
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:38,000
Champa and Kalicharan.

295
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:42,792
Kalicharan and Champa.
Madly in love with each other

296
00:27:43,375 --> 00:27:45,292
They were like one soul two bodies.

297
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:47,417
And then one day...

298
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:48,667
What happened?

299
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:52,750
Kalicharan was putting
some flowers in Champa's hair,

300
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:55,167
Lalcharan happened to see them.

301
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:58,667
He went red with rage!

302
00:27:59,042 --> 00:28:00,500
And one day,

303
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:06,792
he deceived Champa into drinking
poison, in the name of medicine.

304
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:13,000
And poor Champa!
She screamed, "Kali, Kali!"

305
00:28:13,417 --> 00:28:17,292
And then died. Just imagine!

306
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:22,917
Kalicharan just could not
bear the pain of Champa's death.

307
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:26,667
Over there! Look at that peak!

308
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:33,667
From that very peak, Kalicharan
screamed, "Champa, Champa!"

309
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:38,042
And jumped to his death!

310
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:44,167
Ever since, Kalicharan's spirit
has been looking for his Champa!

311
00:28:46,042 --> 00:28:49,292
Why are you pointing towards me?

312
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,750
Because you are his Champa.

313
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:54,667
Me? Champa!

314
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:56,667
I mean, you look like Champa.

315
00:28:57,292 --> 00:29:01,542
I'm feeling terribly scared.
We can't stay here anymore, please

316
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:02,917
Nobody goes anywhere!

317
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:04,125
Sir!

318
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:09,500
This silly Bahadur
talks a lot of nonsense,

319
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,375
and you start imagining?

320
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:17,750
Bahadur, you're not telling these
kids anymore stories. Understand?

321
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:22,292
And now get ready.
We're going mountain-climbing.

322
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,417
You will use ascenders to climb,

323
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:36,167
and then put descenders....

324
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,292
and you will come rappelling down.

325
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,375
Ghost!

326
00:29:57,167 --> 00:29:58,250
Priya!

327
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:06,417
Ghost!

328
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,667
What on earth is that?

329
00:30:22,917 --> 00:30:24,417
Kalicharan!

330
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:34,542
One hundred and four degrees.

331
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,250
I had told you, sir.

332
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:39,875
But you didn't listen.

333
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:45,417
We're not staying here any more.

334
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:48,667
Bahadur, go fast,

335
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:50,792
and make a call from your phone booth.

336
00:30:51,042 --> 00:30:53,667
And arrange for our transportation. Go!

337
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:56,667
You've snatched my bread and butter.

338
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:59,250
I'm broke even before
I could make some money.

339
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:05,792
Why did you climb the mountain like that,
in front of them?

340
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:09,792
What could I do? She screamed so loudly.

341
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:13,875
I got scared.

342
00:31:13,958 --> 00:31:19,292
And now they are so scared,
that they're all going back.

343
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,292
Now keep searching for
your Champa all your life!

344
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:27,292
What do we do, Bahadur?

345
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:31,667
How do I know? I did as you said.

346
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,292
You think of a way now.

347
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:38,292
-Idea!
-What?

348
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,292
Champa..

349
00:31:43,917 --> 00:31:45,292
My name is Priya.

350
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:47,500
In this lifetime,

351
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:51,750
In your earlier six births
you were Kalicharan's Champa.

352
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:53,292
This is your seventh birth.

353
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:57,292
If you leave without meeting him,
he'll be very angry,

354
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,667
and he'll follow you wherever you go.

355
00:32:02,292 --> 00:32:06,292
How will he follow her?
We're going back to Singapore.

356
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:11,042
He can reach Singapore too!
He doesn't need air tickets.

357
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:15,292
Bahadur, she's not meeting any ghost!
What if something happens to her?

358
00:32:15,417 --> 00:32:20,292
This ghost is a gentleman, ma'am.
He hasn't harmed a soul.

359
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:21,792
Am I right?

360
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:23,167
Yes.

361
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:26,167
I leave the rest to you.

362
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:29,375
Wait, Bahadur!

363
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:34,042
-Honey.
-Yes?

364
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:38,750
You're going to meet him?

365
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,917
Yes. Only then will he find peace.

366
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:44,750
And you better not stop her.

367
00:32:44,917 --> 00:32:47,667
If Kalicharan gets to know...

368
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,417
No! I wasn't stopping her!

369
00:32:51,542 --> 00:32:55,000
I was only advising you, right?

370
00:32:55,042 --> 00:33:00,042
Listen, you must meet the ghost.
He's such a gentleman!

371
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:01,500
I'm off to sleep. Bye, good night!

372
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:02,542
Honey!

373
00:33:06,042 --> 00:33:13,042
Champa. Champa.

374
00:33:40,292 --> 00:33:44,500
Hello! Kalicharan.

375
00:33:45,042 --> 00:33:46,250
I am here...

376
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:49,125
to help you get peace.

377
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:52,292
Please, could you appear before me?

378
00:33:58,292 --> 00:33:59,917
I am scared.

379
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:03,292
Do ghosts also feel scared nowadays?

380
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:10,792
I'm not a ghost.

381
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,042
You aren't a ghost?

382
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:17,417
Oh yes, I get it!

383
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:21,667
It offends you when someone
calls you a ghost, doesn't it?

384
00:34:22,417 --> 00:34:27,042
And you're right!
You've ended your life for love.

385
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:32,167
And those who end their
lives for love aren't ghosts.

386
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:35,667
They are... they are...

387
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:39,667
They're lovers!
You're a lover, aren't you?

388
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:41,667
I'm Krishna.

389
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,250
Look, stay right there!

390
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:57,417
Don't come closer, okay?

391
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,417
You sent for me and here I am.

392
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:02,542
You'll get peace now.

393
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:06,792
-May I go now?
-All I want is friendship.

394
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,000
What? Friendship?

395
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:14,792
Hey, don't be afraid.
I'm as human as you are.

396
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:17,792
Touch me, if you can't believe that.

397
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:20,167
Touch you?

398
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:29,917
See? The color of my blood is red, too.

399
00:35:30,292 --> 00:35:32,417
Are you convinced
now that I'm not a ghost?

400
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:37,375
If you're not a ghost, then that picture?

401
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:41,917
That's my father's photograph.
He's no more.

402
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:43,542
I look exactly like him.

403
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,417
I see.

404
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,667
But the other day,

405
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,167
how did you suddenly
get on that tree to save my life?

406
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,542
And yesterday! How did
you climb that mountain so fast?

407
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:59,750
Maybe because I've got used to it.

408
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:02,792
Right from my childhood,
I've grown up playing among

409
00:36:02,917 --> 00:36:04,167
the trees and mountains

410
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:05,917
with the birds and the animals.

411
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:08,417
I spend most of my time here.

412
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,792
I guess that's why they're my friends.

413
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:14,750
-Would you like to meet my friends?
-What?

414
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,375
I still can't believe it!

415
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:39,000
I won't let you poke that pin again!

416
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:41,792
It hurts because I'm not Kalicharan.

417
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:50,417
See? He's not Kalicharan!
I've always been saying that!

418
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,917
That's what you're still saying.

419
00:36:57,792 --> 00:36:59,500
Correct!

420
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:05,792
Kalicharan, you're so cute!

421
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:11,250
Krishna, you really got us scared.
But that was a nice prank.

422
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:15,000
Boys and girls, camping continues!

423
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:18,167
Krishna, you also join the group.

424
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,667
Catch!

425
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:09,750
Yes!

426
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,917
From where are you getting a flower
of a new color every time, Krishna?

427
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,542
From the rainbow.

428
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,917
The rainbow?

429
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,917
Yes.

430
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:48,167
Look.

431
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:04,500
Wow Krishna! It's such a beautiful sight.

432
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:09,917
Had I not come here,
I'd really have regretted it.

433
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,375
So would I.

434
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:19,667
I've never seen such a lovely place.

435
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:47,167
Krishna, you speak English?

436
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,792
And with such fluency?

437
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:55,667
Grandma taught me. She's my school,
my college and my university.

438
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:59,917
But you need talent
to learn anything, Krishna.

439
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,167
And you possess amazing talent.

440
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:07,667
You shouldn't be wasting
your talent in this remote village.

441
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:09,917
You ought to get out of here.

442
00:41:10,417 --> 00:41:12,042
People in the world out there,

443
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:15,750
not just need talented people
like you, they appreciate them too.

444
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:20,500
But my grandma is my world.

445
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:24,417
I will never leave her.

446
00:41:26,167 --> 00:41:27,917
You love your grandma very much?

447
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:30,417
More than very much.

448
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:33,250
Krishna, I want to meet your grandma.

-Hello, Grandma.
-Bless you.

472
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:17,500
We've met before.

473
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:20,500
I remember. Tell me something..

474
00:46:20,792 --> 00:46:22,917
Why did you go away, the other day?

475
00:46:23,542 --> 00:46:25,292
I fled, grandma! Out of fright.

476
00:46:25,792 --> 00:46:28,542
Krishna was playing a ghost to scare us.

477
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,500
Ghost?

478
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:40,542
And that well-built Komal
Sir was trembling in his boots!

479
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:43,292
He was down with 104 degrees fever!

480
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:45,292
-Yes.
-What? 104 degrees?

481
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:47,375
Is that true, Krishna?

482
00:46:47,542 --> 00:46:49,917
You shouldn't play such
pranks on anyone, my son.

483
00:46:50,167 --> 00:46:53,667
Why scare someone so much?

484
00:46:54,417 --> 00:46:55,417
Did you apologize?

485
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:58,042
Yes, Grandma. To everybody.

486
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:11,292
Priya, tell me something about yourself.

487
00:47:12,167 --> 00:47:14,667
I live in Singapore with my Mother.

488
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,542
My father is no more.

489
00:47:17,792 --> 00:47:20,125
I'm here in India on
a vacation with my friend.

490
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,917
Her family lives in Chandigarh.

491
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:23,500
I see.

492
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:25,917
I'll go and wash my hands.

493
00:47:56,167 --> 00:48:00,167
Priya, for how many
more days are you here?

494
00:48:00,542 --> 00:48:03,167
Days? We're leaving today.

495
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:04,417
In fact, right now.

496
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,625
Oh my God! I must leave now.

497
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,625
Everyone must be waiting for me.

498
00:48:10,167 --> 00:48:13,000
Honey, here's my phone number.

499
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:15,250
Whenever you want to come here again

500
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:17,292
please give me the opportunity
to serve you again.

501
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:18,292
Okay Bahadur.

502
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:20,750
-Where's Priya?
-There she is!

503
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:22,250
Hurry, we've got to leave.

504
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:23,792
Come on, everybody! Get in!

505
00:48:23,917 --> 00:48:26,667
-Krishna, nice meeting you.
-Thank you.

506
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,750
We really enjoyed your company, Krishna.

507
00:48:28,875 --> 00:48:30,125
We'd love to come back.

508
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,167
It was great fun, Krishna.

509
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:40,542
I had a wonderful time with you.

510
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:43,917
I didn't even realize
how ten days have passed by.

511
00:48:46,375 --> 00:48:48,167
I'm going to miss this place.

512
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:50,542
And you, too.

513
00:48:52,542 --> 00:48:53,917
Look after yourself, Kalicharan.

514
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,542
I have to go now.

515
00:48:59,542 --> 00:49:01,000
May I?

516
00:49:04,167 --> 00:49:05,792
May I go?

517
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,792
Krishna, how will she go,
if you don't let go of her hand?

518
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:33,167
Bye. Visit again.

519
00:49:39,417 --> 00:49:41,875
Priya, see.

520
00:49:58,125 --> 00:49:59,417
Crazy.

521
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:19,417
Priya, it looks like you're no
longer Priya. You've become Radha.

522
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:22,000
Krishna's Radha.

523
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,792
I seriously think Krishna
has fallen in love with you.

524
00:51:06,042 --> 00:51:10,292
Honey, pray that the boss' mood is okay,
we're five days late.

525
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:23,917
We are saying hi to them,

526
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:25,542
why are they waving five fingers at us?

527
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:28,542
Stupid!
The five fingers stand for five days.

528
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:30,875
Oh my God! You mean boss too?

529
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:37,375
You took a leave of 15 days

530
00:51:37,542 --> 00:51:39,500
and have come after 20 days.

531
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:43,042
So you girls are now fired!

532
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:47,167
Why just India? Go on a world tour! Go!

533
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:52,542
Stop, Priya.

534
00:51:53,417 --> 00:51:55,875
Sorry boss, but you can't insult us.

535
00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:05,000
Boss, you can't question our integrity.

536
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:07,417
Agreed that we were on
a leave of 15 days.

537
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,167
But on the 16th day we got to work.

538
00:52:12,417 --> 00:52:14,292
What amazing work have you done?

539
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:17,292
We have found an Indian super-boy.

540
00:52:17,417 --> 00:52:19,500
Honey! What are you saying?

541
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:21,417
Let me speak, please.

542
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:25,000
Boss, this boy scales high mountains

543
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:26,917
as if they were mere steps for him!

544
00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:28,792
He runs faster than a horse!

545
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:30,250
And guess what?

546
00:52:30,375 --> 00:52:32,875
He puts his hand in the
river and pulls out fish!

547
00:52:35,542 --> 00:52:41,042
Just think about it, if a boy
as talented as him were to come here,

548
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:44,375
your rating's are going to soar!

549
00:52:53,042 --> 00:52:57,417
No way, boss! You will believe it too,

550
00:52:57,667 --> 00:53:02,542
when you see him doing
all those incredible things here!

551
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:06,417
See him here!
How? How's he going to come here?

552
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,375
I tried to stop you,
but you just wouldn't listen!

553
00:53:10,917 --> 00:53:16,417
Please, Priya! There was
no other way of saving our job.

554
00:53:16,667 --> 00:53:20,625
Besides, what's wrong
if Krishna comes here?

555
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,125
There you go again!

556
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:24,125
Relax! Sit down.

557
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:29,000
If Krishna's talents are
showcased on our channel

558
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:32,167
he'd be the one who'd gain.
Name, fame, money.

559
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:36,000
He'll have everything!
He'll be a big man!

560
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:42,167
I know you're right, Honey,

561
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:45,875
but Krishna will never leave
his grandma and come.

562
00:53:47,292 --> 00:53:48,917
She is his world.

563
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:52,667
But now you are a part of his world too.

564
00:53:54,417 --> 00:53:59,375
I know. Now do as I say.

565
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:02,125
Call for Krishna!

566
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:05,167
Phone.

567
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:07,875
Phone.

568
00:54:09,417 --> 00:54:12,042
Krishna, phone.

569
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:15,792
He's coming!

570
00:54:15,917 --> 00:54:17,250
Who's coming?

571
00:54:17,375 --> 00:54:21,792
A boy? Is he an Indian?
Does he live here in Singapore?

572
00:54:21,917 --> 00:54:23,917
Have you finally chosen someone, Priya?

573
00:54:24,042 --> 00:54:26,792
There you go again, Mom!
I haven't chosen anyone.

574
00:54:26,917 --> 00:54:28,167
So choose one!

575
00:54:28,292 --> 00:54:31,375
I will, please leave now,
we got to save our jobs.

576
00:54:31,458 --> 00:54:33,042
-And when will you settle down?
-Tomorrow.

577
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:34,792
Call from Priya!

578
00:54:34,917 --> 00:54:36,042
Priya?

579
00:54:37,042 --> 00:54:39,000
-Hello, Krishna.
-Priya.

580
00:54:39,792 --> 00:54:40,917
How are you?

581
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:44,542
I'm fine, but I don't like anything.

582
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:46,625
Me too.

583
00:54:48,292 --> 00:54:49,917
I can't sleep.

584
00:54:51,042 --> 00:54:52,042
Me too.

585
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:55,375
I want to meet you.

586
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:58,375
Me too.

587
00:54:59,417 --> 00:55:02,417
He's not saying anything
more than "Me too", so what do I do?

588
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,667
You continue reading, read from here!

589
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,125
Priya, why are you quiet?

590
00:55:07,792 --> 00:55:11,125
Krishna, can't you come here
and meet my mother?

591
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:12,375
Your mother?

592
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:15,667
Yes, if you don't meet my mother,

593
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:19,000
she'll get me married to someone else.

594
00:55:20,042 --> 00:55:21,417
Someone else?

595
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:23,750
No, I won't let that happen!

596
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:26,417
I'm coming there to meet
your mother, Priya!

597
00:55:27,875 --> 00:55:32,250
But, how will I get there?

598
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,375
Yes, how will you get here?

599
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:39,792
Hello, Krishna! Don't worry.
Just give the phone to Bahadur?

600
00:55:54,375 --> 00:56:00,125
Krishna! Aircraft! Singapore!
Priya ma'am!

601
00:56:00,417 --> 00:56:02,667

01:01:03,417 --> 01:01:05,542
Grandma!

634
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:09,417
-Grandma!
-Put me down.

635
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:11,292
Oh God.

636
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:13,625
What's the matter, Krishna?

637
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:15,792
-Grandma.
-You look very happy today.

638
01:01:15,917 --> 01:01:18,542
Grandma, I got a call from Priya!

639
01:01:18,667 --> 01:01:20,917
You told me that she'd forgotten me?

640
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,792
But it's not true, Grandma!
She misses me every moment.

641
01:01:23,917 --> 01:01:27,292
She's always thinking of me!
And she keeps seeing me everywhere!

642
01:01:29,542 --> 01:01:33,000
And I never told you

643
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,375
I've been in a similar state.

644
01:01:38,417 --> 01:01:41,917
Ever since Priya has left,
I never liked anything.

645
01:01:43,417 --> 01:01:47,042
But today after her call, I feel better.

646
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:50,167
Grandma, Priya has called me to Singapore.

647
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:52,000
She wants me to meet her mother.

648
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,792
-Her mother?
-Yes.

649
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,167
If I don't go and ask for her hand

650
01:01:55,292 --> 01:01:58,042
her mother's going to get her
married to someone else.

651
01:01:59,042 --> 01:02:01,292
I said, I wouldn't let that happen,
I'm coming.

652
01:02:03,292 --> 01:02:06,167
I did the right thing, didn't I Grandma?
May I go, Grandma?

653
01:02:13,417 --> 01:02:15,417
It's only a matter of a few days, Grandma.

654
01:02:15,542 --> 01:02:18,750
I'll ask for Priya's hand in
marriage and bring her back with me.

655
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,375
May I go, Grandma?

656
01:02:26,917 --> 01:02:28,417
You're not answering, Grandma.

657
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,667
When you've already decided to go...

658
01:02:34,875 --> 01:02:37,042
then, why are you asking me?

659
01:02:38,042 --> 01:02:40,875
Go on. Go.

660
01:02:41,792 --> 01:02:43,167
You aren't happy, Grandma?

661
01:02:44,292 --> 01:02:46,417
Don't you like Priya?

662
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:49,792
I like Priya...

663
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:53,667
but, I don't like the
idea of you going so far.

664
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,125
If Priya really loves you...

665
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,667
she can also come here with her mother.

666
01:03:01,792 --> 01:03:03,417
But you're not going there!

667
01:03:03,667 --> 01:03:05,042
Why not?

668
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:10,417
I said you're not going,
it means you're not going.

669
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:12,875
That's it!

670
01:03:13,417 --> 01:03:16,292
But why can't I go?
What's going to happen?

671
01:03:16,875 --> 01:03:18,375
I've been hearing
this since I was a child!

672
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:21,417
Don't go here, don't go there,
don't do this, don't do that.

673
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,417
Don't go to the city with your friends!

674
01:03:23,542 --> 01:03:26,667
Forget the city, you don't even allow
me to go beyond the river. Why?

675
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,500
Now you've become so big that
I have to give an explanations?

676
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,917
You'll have to tell me today, Grandma!

677
01:03:42,875 --> 01:03:44,375
Why do you keep stopping me?

678
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:46,125
Why can't I go anywhere?

679
01:03:48,042 --> 01:03:51,292
Because I don't want to lose you

680
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,917
So, what do you want then?

681
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:57,667
Cut me off from the world and
keep looking at your face forever?

682
01:03:58,042 --> 01:04:00,417
Bang my head on trees
and mountains all my life?

683
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,250
You want me to be alone all my life?
Is that what you want?

684
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:13,667
But I can't do I that, Grandma!
I have my own life too,

685
01:04:13,792 --> 01:04:17,125
my own dreams. I too want
to achieve something!

686
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:19,000
I want an identity for myself!

687
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:27,292
You don't want to lose me,
even if I have to lose Priya.

688
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:30,500
You can't see me happy.

689
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:36,375
I have always obeyed you.
And you can't agree to my one request?

690
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:40,042
Today I realize, how selfish you are!

691
01:04:41,667 --> 01:04:44,750
You only think of yourself! Only yourself!

692
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:47,792
You don't care for me!

693
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:51,667
Had my parents been alive,
they'd have understood my feelings!

694
01:04:51,792 --> 01:04:54,417
They'd have let me go,
they wouldn't have stopped me!

695
01:05:04,417 --> 01:05:07,125
I wish your parents were alive.

696
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:11,042
I wish!

697
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:41,250
I'm sorry, Grandma.

698
01:05:52,542 --> 01:05:54,667
See these stars, Krishna.

699
01:05:57,542 --> 01:06:02,292
With these infinite
twinkling stars in the sky...

700
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:09,417
you, your father, your grandfather

701
01:06:09,542 --> 01:06:11,500
and I share a very deep relationship.

702
01:06:14,417 --> 01:06:16,875
Your grandfather was a space scientist.

703
01:06:17,917 --> 01:06:21,375
One night, he started receiving a reply

704
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,917
to a signal he had sent to outer space.

705
01:06:25,042 --> 01:06:27,042
Suddenly, we saw a UFO in the sky.

706
01:06:27,167 --> 01:06:29,542
The car swerved out of control.

707
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:32,542
And there was an accident.
I survived the accident.

708
01:06:32,792 --> 01:06:34,250
But your grandfather...

709
01:06:36,417 --> 01:06:38,542
No!

710
01:06:40,292 --> 01:06:42,292
I was pregnant with Rohit at that time.

711
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,667
He had sustained a
head injury in the accident.

712
01:06:47,667 --> 01:06:49,542
Because of which he was born abnormal.

713
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:56,417
Even when he grew up,
he had the I.Q. of a child.

714
01:06:57,417 --> 01:07:02,292
One night, in our small town,
a huge spaceship descended.

715
01:07:05,042 --> 01:07:07,000
Some aliens emerged from it,

716
01:07:07,417 --> 01:07:09,917
but one could not go back.

717
01:07:10,917 --> 01:07:14,750
And that is how Rohit met Jadoo.

718
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:19,667
Jadoo had supernatural powers,

719
01:07:20,542 --> 01:07:23,667
which he passed on to Rohit.

720
01:07:24,542 --> 01:07:26,667
Rohit changed completely.

721
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,750
Jadoo eventually went away...

722
01:07:31,292 --> 01:07:36,250
but he did not take back
the powers he had given to Rohit.

723
01:07:37,417 --> 01:07:42,250
And thereafter,
everything changed forever.

724
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:45,917
My son could do things that...

725
01:07:46,417 --> 01:07:50,542
were impossible for
an ordinary human being.

726
01:07:53,667 --> 01:07:56,542
It was around then that
Rohit married your mother.

727
01:07:57,667 --> 01:08:03,417
And very soon,
his fame spread across the world.

728
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:09,125
The chairman of the world's largest
Information Technology Company,

729
01:08:10,042 --> 01:08:11,667
invited Rohit abroad.

730
01:09:00,417 --> 01:09:02,000
Mr. Rohit Mehra?

731
01:09:07,792 --> 01:09:09,167
I was, this book--

732
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:15,042
Oh yes, that's the first
copy of my latest book.

733
01:09:15,292 --> 01:09:17,417
Please read it and give your opinion.

734
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:20,875
It's a wonderful book, Sir.
You've done a lot of research.

735
01:09:21,292 --> 01:09:23,917
How can you say that without reading it?

736
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,292
I've already read it, Sir.

737
01:09:27,042 --> 01:09:28,167
Read it?

738
01:09:30,042 --> 01:09:34,292
There are printing errors
on page 126, 244 and 354.

739
01:09:34,542 --> 01:09:35,667
I've marked them.

740
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:40,792
You've read this 400
page book in just ten minutes?

741
01:09:44,792 --> 01:09:47,667
I forgot who I was talking to.

742
01:09:47,792 --> 01:09:51,917
Asking you such questions
is an insult to your talent.

743
01:09:58,042 --> 01:09:59,625
I still can't believe,

744
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:01,042
that I'm standing face to face

745
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:02,792
with a great scientist
and innovator like you.

746
01:10:03,542 --> 01:10:05,542
Your achievements in the
field of wireless communication,

747
01:10:05,667 --> 01:10:07,625
is no less than a revolution, Sir.

748
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:10,917
You've invented the palmtop.

749
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:15,500
People can watch cricket matches
on their phones, thanks to you.

750
01:10:19,167 --> 01:10:23,667
I have a new dream, Rohit. A new vision.

751
01:10:24,167 --> 01:10:31,167
If this dream comes true,
it could change the destiny of the world.

752
01:10:33,292 --> 01:10:37,417
And I need your help
to realize this dream.

753
01:10:38,792 --> 01:10:44,292
I want to build a computer
that can see the future.

754
01:10:52,292 --> 01:10:54,167
What would you like, tea or coffee?

755
01:11:02,417 --> 01:11:06,042
I understand your dream, your vision, Sir.

756
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:12,167
You want to combine astrology,
astronomy and technology,

757
01:11:12,417 --> 01:11:16,000
to build a computer
that can see the future.

758
01:11:16,042 --> 01:11:20,042
Exactly! That's precisely
why I've called you here.

759
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:24,667
Because the people
I have here are trained...

760
01:11:25,417 --> 01:11:27,667
not gifted like you.

761
01:11:41,792 --> 01:11:43,542
What are you thinking, Rohit?

762
01:11:45,292 --> 01:11:52,292
Sir, if we can really build a computer
that can see the future then--

763
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:58,417
Then, think of the good we
can do for this planet and mankind!

764
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:04,417
Earthquakes,
famines, floods, can be prevented.

765
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:07,417
Even if we can't prevent them,
we can at least be prepared for them.

766
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,542
You've already started
seeing the future, Rohit.

767
01:12:13,292 --> 01:12:15,417
In the hope that this union of brilliance

768
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:19,542
and vision will become history.

769
01:12:20,042 --> 01:12:22,042
Create history!

770
01:12:25,417 --> 01:12:27,542
It took him two whole years...

771
01:12:28,917 --> 01:12:33,042
but Rohit achieved the impossible.

772
01:12:34,542 --> 01:12:39,542
He built a computer
that could see the future.

773
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:45,792
It was around the time
when you were going to be born.

774
01:12:46,042 --> 01:12:48,792
-Hello, Rohit!
-Mom!

775
01:12:48,917 --> 01:12:50,417
Rohit, I've brought
Nisha to the hospital.

776
01:12:50,542 --> 01:12:52,042
That's where I'm calling from.

777
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:55,917
Congratulations! You're
going to become a father anytime.

778
01:12:56,792 --> 01:12:58,667
Come back soon.

779
01:12:58,792 --> 01:13:01,292
I'm coming, mom. I'm coming!

780
01:13:02,917 --> 01:13:07,917
Rohit, what's the matter?
You sound tense.

781
01:13:08,167 --> 01:13:12,542
I've been exploited.
The world is very selfish,

782
01:13:12,667 --> 01:13:16,292
but don't worry! I'll be back soon!

783
01:13:17,042 --> 01:13:19,500
But my son did not come back.

784
01:13:22,125 --> 01:13:27,000
Moments after you were born,
we received word...

785
01:13:28,917 --> 01:13:31,667
that a fire broke out in the lab...

786
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:38,292
and they couldn't save Rohit.

787
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,750
Your mother couldn't bear the shock...

788
01:13:45,750 --> 01:13:48,917
and passed away in a few days.

789
01:13:52,792 --> 01:13:55,042
When you were five years old...

790
01:13:56,625 --> 01:14:01,500
I got to know that you too
were born with extraordinary powers.

791
01:14:01,542 --> 01:14:06,417
that Rohit had. I got scared.

792
01:14:07,417 --> 01:14:14,417
I didn't want the world to know about you.

793
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:19,542
And that's why I brought you here.

794
01:14:20,292 --> 01:14:22,167
A place where nobody knew us.

795
01:14:24,167 --> 01:14:28,792
I didn't want to lose
you at any cost, Krishna.

796
01:14:32,542 --> 01:14:34,917
You no longer want to see my face...

797
01:14:37,417 --> 01:14:41,125
but I'm living only for you, Krishna.

798
01:14:44,917 --> 01:14:50,542
Yes, I'm selfish, very selfish.

799
01:15:27,542 --> 01:15:29,250
Grandma? What are you doing?

800
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:33,042
I've taken out some
of your father's clothes.

801
01:15:34,042 --> 01:15:37,292
You can't go to Singapore like this!

802
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:43,042
But Grandma?

803
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:48,792
I could shield you from the world..

804
01:15:49,917 --> 01:15:51,625
But not your heart.

805
01:15:52,417 --> 01:15:55,875
Go, bring Priya here.

806
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,875
Go.

807
01:16:00,792 --> 01:16:02,417
Krishna...

808
01:16:05,042 --> 01:16:07,000
stay carefully there.

809
01:16:07,417 --> 01:16:12,625
Eat and sleep on time,
don't talk too much with anybody.

810
01:16:13,417 --> 01:16:15,375
And don't get into any trouble.

811
01:16:15,917 --> 01:16:20,500
Whatever you do, make sure
you behave like any other man.

812
01:16:21,667 --> 01:16:27,417
Don't get carried away to
do things that make people realize...

813
01:16:29,292 --> 01:16:32,542
Who I am? Right, grandma?

814
01:16:33,917 --> 01:16:35,292
Yes, my son.

815
01:16:36,042 --> 01:16:38,292
Don't worry, grandma.

816
01:16:39,125 --> 01:16:41,667
I won't let anybody know about me.

817
01:16:42,417 --> 01:16:48,000
I'll keep my strength,
my abilities and my talent hidden.

818
01:16:52,042 --> 01:16:53,417
That's a promise, grandma.

819
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,167
Your welcome sounds
different and nicer today.

820
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:29,042
I've come a few days in advance.
But I couldn't help it.

821
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:33,417
I've waited so many years but
now that we're so close to success...

822
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:37,542
being patient is very difficult.

823
01:18:38,167 --> 01:18:41,167
I must say, you and your
team deserve credit

824
01:18:41,292 --> 01:18:44,417
for making my dream come true again.

825
01:18:44,792 --> 01:18:48,125
Sir, the credit goes to Rohit Mehra.

826
01:18:48,417 --> 01:18:51,542
If it wasn't for his notes and research,

827
01:18:51,792 --> 01:18:54,625
it would have been impossible
to build that computer again.

828
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:02,542
The computer that Rohit made in two years,

829
01:19:02,667 --> 01:19:04,917
Has taken us many years to make.

830
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,167
That's why I still miss him.

831
01:19:31,667 --> 01:19:38,042
Till now people say,
"Who has seen the future?"

832
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:45,250
But in a few days, you and I...

833
01:19:45,792 --> 01:19:50,917
will change many truths
and idioms forever.

834
01:19:52,417 --> 01:19:55,167
Breaking news!

835
01:19:55,292 --> 01:19:58,500
After years of struggle,
hard work, research and patience,

836
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:04,750
Dr. Siddhant Arya's most ambitious
project is about to be completed.

837
01:20:05,292 --> 01:20:09,417
According to our correspondent,
in just a few days,

838
01:20:09,542 --> 01:20:11,667
Dr. Arya will be able to predict

839
01:20:11,792 --> 01:20:13,750
the future of individuals,
countries and the world!

840
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:16,667
He'll also be able to change
the course of their destinies.

841
01:20:16,792 --> 01:20:19,667
And the truth is, one who
can see and change the future,

842
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:22,417
Is considered like God!

843
01:20:24,417 --> 01:20:26,042
Wrong!

844
01:20:27,417 --> 01:20:30,042
Not Like God...

845
01:20:30,917 --> 01:20:34,000
he is God!

846
01:20:40,417 --> 01:20:44,125
Now, no one can stop me.

847
01:21:05,417 --> 01:21:07,375
Hurry up.

848
01:21:10,542 --> 01:21:11,917
-Oh!
-What have you done?

849
01:21:12,125 --> 01:21:14,125
We're already late and then
this is how you park the car?

850
01:21:14,292 --> 01:21:16,875
I can't even open the door!
How am I going to get out?

851
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,417
But neither can I!

852
01:21:18,542 --> 01:21:23,667
Great! Let's just sit in
the car and stare at each other!

853
01:21:23,792 --> 01:21:26,792
You always mess things up!
Krishna's flight must have landed.

854
01:21:26,917 --> 01:21:28,417
He must be looking for us.

855
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:58,875
Are you okay? I hope you're not hurt.

856
01:22:19,417 --> 01:22:20,667
Krishna?

857
01:22:28,292 --> 01:22:31,917
Krishna, you look so
good in these clothes.

858
01:22:34,375 --> 01:22:35,375
They are my fathers.

859
01:22:40,792 --> 01:22:44,667
O my God! You look so handsome!

860
01:22:45,042 --> 01:22:46,750
You two have come alone?

861
01:22:46,875 --> 01:22:49,417
How can two people come alone?

862
01:22:49,542 --> 01:22:53,667
No! I mean,
hasn't your mother come with you?

863
01:22:53,792 --> 01:22:54,917
Mother?

864
01:22:55,042 --> 01:22:56,375
Is she also coming here?

865
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:58,375
It would've been nice if she were here.

866
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:02,750
I'd have asked for your hand
and gone back to India immediately.

867
01:23:03,042 --> 01:23:04,167
Grandma's all alone, you see.

868
01:23:05,375 --> 01:23:06,875
He's in a tearing hurry!

869
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,125
Has he brought a priest along
to solemnize the wedding?

870
01:23:11,292 --> 01:23:15,667
-What happened?
-Well actually, mom, you know--

871
01:23:15,792 --> 01:23:18,875
-Her mom's gone.
-Yeah she's gone.

872
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,375
Gone?

873
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:23,250
-To Hong Kong.
-Yes, Hong Kong!

874
01:23:23,375 --> 01:23:24,750
Hong Kong?

875
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:26,917
She'll be back in 10-15 days, right?

876
01:23:27,042 --> 01:23:28,292
Yes, she'll come.

877
01:23:28,417 --> 01:23:32,417
Ten to fifteen days? But what will
I do here for so many days?

878
01:23:32,667 --> 01:23:36,667
Why Krishna? Didn't you take us around
your village when we came there?

879
01:23:36,792 --> 01:23:39,042
Now we'll show you our city.

880
01:23:42,292 --> 01:23:43,542
This is your apartment.

881
01:23:44,042 --> 01:23:45,792
This is your living room.

882
01:23:46,042 --> 01:23:47,500
This is your bedroom.

883
01:23:48,042 --> 01:23:50,125
And these clothes are for you

884
01:23:50,417 --> 01:23:52,167
This is your cell phone.

885
01:23:52,417 --> 01:23:54,375
It has all our numbers.

886
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:56,875
You can call us anytime.

887
01:23:58,917 --> 01:24:02,667
But why can't I live
with you in your house, Priya?

888
01:24:03,542 --> 01:24:04,542
Well...

889
01:24:05,167 --> 01:24:07,542
-Because mom--
-Is not around!

890
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:10,167
Yes! Mom's not around. Very silly.

891
01:24:10,292 --> 01:24:12,542
-It doesn't look good.
-Yes.

892
01:24:13,667 --> 01:24:15,542
Hey! My phone is ringing!

893
01:24:15,875 --> 01:24:18,000
It says 'Mama' how do I take the call?

894
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:21,292
Looks like I gave you my
cell phone by mistake. Excuse me.

895
01:24:21,417 --> 01:24:24,000
-Hello!
-Priya, there's good news.

896
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,542
I've got a very good
marriage proposal for you.

897
01:24:25,667 --> 01:24:28,167
I'm busy right now.
I'll call you later, mom.

898
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:29,917
It was your mom's call?
Let me say hello to her.

899
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,750
No, it wasn't mom.

900
01:24:31,875 --> 01:24:34,042
It was my uncle.

901
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:36,417
I could've said hello to him.

902
01:24:36,542 --> 01:24:38,625
-Does he live here too?
-Yes.

903
01:24:39,292 --> 01:24:41,917
No! He lives in India.

904
01:24:42,042 --> 01:24:44,000
I see, where in India?

905
01:24:44,125 --> 01:24:46,625
Krishna, we've got to go to the office.

906
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:49,500
We'll give you her uncle's address later,

907
01:24:49,667 --> 01:24:52,750
with pin code.
But we've got to leave now. Bye!

908
01:24:57,042 --> 01:24:59,667
How many lies do we have
to speak to cover up one lie?

909
01:24:59,875 --> 01:25:02,292
-The excuse of an uncle saved us today!
-Tomorrow it'll be an aunt!

910
01:25:02,375 --> 01:25:05,000
There is no dearth of relatives. Relax!

911
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,667
Did you see his eyes?

912
01:25:07,792 --> 01:25:10,167
They were full of love and trust.

913
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,042
Honey, I can't do this!

914
01:25:12,167 --> 01:25:13,917
I can't hurt Krishna anymore.

915
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:17,542
Hurt? He's going to become
a celebrity thanks to you.

916
01:25:17,667 --> 01:25:19,542
And we'll get a promotion.

917
01:25:19,667 --> 01:25:22,792
And even if he gets to know,
a small lie is not going to hurt him.

918
01:25:25,375 --> 01:25:26,292
What happened?

919
01:25:27,167 --> 01:25:31,625
You? How did you get here from
the 20th floor so quickly?

920
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:34,042
-I took the stairs.
-Stairs?

921
01:25:34,167 --> 01:25:40,417
Actually, Priya...
I've got something for you.

922
01:25:42,792 --> 01:25:43,667
What?

923
01:25:47,792 --> 01:25:50,042
-I'll go get the car, okay?
-Honey!

924
01:25:54,542 --> 01:25:55,667
Close your eyes.

925
01:25:58,167 --> 01:26:01,542
Priya, why do you widen your
eyes whenever I ask you to close them?

926
01:26:06,292 --> 01:26:07,542
Open them now.

927
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:14,250
May I put it on your finger?

928
01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:21,542
Give me your hand.

929
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,375
Looks nice?

930
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:36,167
Yes, now it looks nice.

931
01:26:42,042 --> 01:26:43,417
What happened?

932
01:26:43,542 --> 01:26:45,542
I'll tell you later, lets go!

933
01:28:00,083 --> 01:28:01,208
Brother!

934
01:30:05,417 --> 01:30:07,667
Ten days will go by in no time.

935
01:30:08,208 --> 01:30:10,583
Tell me how are you finding it there?

936
01:30:10,833 --> 01:30:11,958
Its very nice, grandma.

937
01:30:12,083 --> 01:30:13,583
There are a lot of
high-rise buildings here.

938
01:30:13,667 --> 01:30:16,333
And my apartment is on the 20th floor.

939
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:18,833
And I'm talking to you
from the balcony right now.

940
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:21,958
Okay, okay, take care of yourself.

941
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:25,458
And give my love
and blessings to Priya.

942
01:30:27,292 --> 01:30:28,958
That's the name of our new show.

943
01:30:29,083 --> 01:30:36,083
Can you imagine a human being
climbing a tree faster than a monkey? No?

944
01:30:36,292 --> 01:30:39,708
Well, after watching our show today.

945
01:30:39,833 --> 01:30:43,333
You won't just imagine,
but also believe that is possible.

946
01:30:43,583 --> 01:30:47,708
Get set then! On one end is the
world famous orangutan Mao!

947
01:30:48,417 --> 01:30:50,708
Who in a blink, will climb this pole.

948
01:30:51,292 --> 01:30:54,333
And on the other side
is Indian super-boy Krishna!

949
01:30:55,458 --> 01:30:57,292
-What's happening here, Priya?
-What happened?

950
01:30:57,417 --> 01:30:59,417
You brought me here to watch a shoot!

951
01:30:59,542 --> 01:31:01,833
Yes. But then I thought that if
you can watch the shooting

952
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:03,542
you can perform in it!

953
01:31:03,667 --> 01:31:06,083
But how can I climb
the pole faster than Mao?

954
01:31:06,292 --> 01:31:09,458
Like you climbed the mountain!
The zigzag manner. Remember?

955
01:31:09,583 --> 01:31:11,917
But what if I lose to Mao?

956
01:31:12,042 --> 01:31:13,958
I'm sure you won't.

957
01:31:14,083 --> 01:31:15,458
But what if I do?

958
01:31:15,583 --> 01:31:17,042
Well...

959
01:31:17,167 --> 01:31:18,583
I'll marry Mao then.

960
01:31:21,083 --> 01:31:22,208
No! I'll never let that happen.

961
01:31:23,542 --> 01:31:25,083
So, do it please! It'll be great fun.

962
01:31:31,833 --> 01:31:32,833
Fun it will be.

963
01:31:43,833 --> 01:31:47,708
Priya, there's just a pole's
distance between us and our success!

964
01:31:47,833 --> 01:31:49,458
Not a pole, it's just a moment, stupid!

965
01:32:50,583 --> 01:32:52,458
I've straightened a
lot of these smart alecs.

966
01:33:20,417 --> 01:33:21,833
Honey!

967
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:48,583
I'm not going to the circus with you.

968
01:33:48,667 --> 01:33:51,208
Strange! Why vent your
anger against Mao, on me?

969
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:53,958
How can I help it if
he refused to climb the pole?

970
01:33:54,083 --> 01:33:56,833
And the fish?
Instead of coming into my hand

971
01:33:56,958 --> 01:33:59,583
they palmed off a can, a shoe and that...

972
01:34:00,458 --> 01:34:02,417
Wow! Priya smile!

973
01:34:09,708 --> 01:34:12,208
In India you caught the fish so easily!

974
01:34:12,333 --> 01:34:15,083
Actually those fish knew me,
they stood by me.

975
01:34:15,208 --> 01:34:17,208
But you're not standing by me!

976
01:34:19,208 --> 01:34:21,333
I've come to stand by you for life, Priya.

977
01:34:22,333 --> 01:34:24,708
If my mother asks you what you do,

978
01:34:24,833 --> 01:34:26,292
what will you say?

979
01:34:26,667 --> 01:34:28,083
I'll tell her what I do.

980
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:29,583
Love you.

981
01:34:31,542 --> 01:34:32,958
What else will you say?

982
01:34:33,208 --> 01:34:36,292
I'll fulfil all your wishes,
look after you.

983
01:34:37,083 --> 01:34:38,458
And?

984
01:34:39,458 --> 01:34:41,583
I'll never let a smile leave your face.

985
01:34:48,083 --> 01:34:49,458
And?

986
01:34:49,708 --> 01:34:52,208
Whether times good or
bad we'll always be together.

987
01:34:52,708 --> 01:34:54,583
Just like eyelashes are with the eyes.

988
01:34:56,083 --> 01:34:57,458
And?

989
01:34:57,583 --> 01:35:00,667
You will dream and I'll fulfil them.

990
01:35:03,417 --> 01:35:04,458
And?

991
01:35:04,917 --> 01:35:07,458
In the scorching heat of the sun,
I'll be your shade.

992
01:35:07,792 --> 01:35:09,708
And in the cold, I'll give you warmth.

993
01:35:10,417 --> 01:35:12,458
When the rains bother you,
I'll change the course of the clouds.

994
01:35:13,667 --> 01:35:16,083
And when a storm blows,
I'll turn the winds away.

995
01:35:25,583 --> 01:35:27,833
That's how I shall
protect you all my life...

996
01:35:29,042 --> 01:35:30,417
from every danger..

997
01:35:30,708 --> 01:35:31,833
from every trouble.

998
01:35:37,958 --> 01:35:40,708
Now, I hope your mother will agree?

Priya!

I'll keep my strength,
my Abilities and my talent.. hidden.

1053
01:42:34,708 --> 01:42:38,708
That's a promise, Grandma.

1054
01:45:31,958 --> 01:45:33,333
Krrish.

1055
01:46:52,417 --> 01:46:54,333
Priya!

1056
01:46:55,208 --> 01:46:56,708
Are you all right?

1057
01:46:57,292 --> 01:46:58,333
But how did you get here?

1058
01:46:58,458 --> 01:47:00,292
You had fainted.

1059
01:47:00,417 --> 01:47:02,417
I had gone to get some water for you.

1060
01:47:02,542 --> 01:47:05,458
Take it. What a blaze!

1061
01:47:32,333 --> 01:47:34,583
Till yesterday, we only had a description,

1062
01:47:34,708 --> 01:47:36,458
and a picture of the masked man.

1063
01:47:36,708 --> 01:47:38,583
Today, we've got to know his name,

1064
01:47:38,708 --> 01:47:42,833
And also got a piece of his mask.
Let's find out how.

1065
01:47:48,417 --> 01:47:50,542
-So his name is Krrish!
-Krrish!

1066
01:47:50,833 --> 01:47:53,833
But his identity is
still shrouded in mystery.

1067
01:47:53,958 --> 01:48:00,958
Whoever Krrish is, a bravery award
and cash reward of 25000 dollars,

1068
01:48:01,208 --> 01:48:03,292
has been announced in
appreciation of his courage.

1069
01:48:03,417 --> 01:48:05,583
So how are we going to identify Krrish?

1070
01:48:05,667 --> 01:48:08,167
The one, whose mask
this piece matches with,

1071
01:48:08,292 --> 01:48:09,958
will be considered to be Krrish.

1072
01:48:10,083 --> 01:48:12,542
And he'll be the one to be rewarded.

1073
01:48:12,792 --> 01:48:16,917
Krrish! Krrish!
After all who is this Krrish?

1074
01:48:17,708 --> 01:48:21,417
Listen carefully,
our priority at the moment is Krrish.

1075
01:48:21,542 --> 01:48:24,583
Only Krrish! Get that?

1076
01:48:24,958 --> 01:48:26,958
Krrish's identity.

1077
01:48:27,333 --> 01:48:30,708
Our channel should
be the first to reveal him!

1078
01:48:41,667 --> 01:48:46,208
Our channel must be the first
one to unmask this masked Krrish!

1079
01:48:53,958 --> 01:48:55,708
Where are the two of you going?

1080
01:48:55,958 --> 01:48:57,167
To look for Krrish.

1081
01:48:57,292 --> 01:49:00,208
Ah, forget Krrish.
And look for a new job.

1082
01:49:00,833 --> 01:49:02,458
New job?

1083
01:49:06,042 --> 01:49:07,458
You better go back to India,

1084
01:49:07,583 --> 01:49:09,708
and enjoy your Krishna's flute playing.

1085
01:49:15,542 --> 01:49:18,708
Thanks to Krishna we're jobless.

1086
01:49:18,958 --> 01:49:20,708
Now what do we do?

1087
01:49:21,333 --> 01:49:27,083
Honey, I think Krrish is
none other than our own Krishna.

1088
01:49:27,708 --> 01:49:29,583
-What?
-Yes, Honey!

1089
01:49:30,917 --> 01:49:34,083
At the circus, I saw Krrish
from such a close distance.

1090
01:49:35,042 --> 01:49:38,542
I have a strong feeling
that Krishna is Krrish.

1091
01:49:39,583 --> 01:49:42,708
So, why didn't you tell
this to boss at the meeting?

1092
01:49:42,833 --> 01:49:47,083
Because I wasn't sure,
I need to confirm it first.

1093
01:49:47,333 --> 01:49:49,208
Confirm? How?

1094
01:49:50,708 --> 01:49:53,042
Listen, I have an idea.

1095
01:51:00,208 --> 01:51:01,958
-Hello, Priya.
-Honey, these guys?

1096
01:51:02,083 --> 01:51:04,542
Priya! I've hired some actors.
But I'm a bit late.

1097
01:51:04,667 --> 01:51:06,083
-I'll be there soon.
-What?

1098
01:51:09,208 --> 01:51:11,292
-So who are these guys?
-Which guys?

1099
01:51:16,458 --> 01:51:17,708
Let go!

1100
01:51:29,917 --> 01:51:31,417
Krishna!

1101
01:51:50,333 --> 01:51:55,417
I thought you were Krrish
and planned my own kidnapping.

1102
01:51:57,417 --> 01:52:01,333
But then, real goons turned
up instead of the hired ones.

1103
01:52:03,208 --> 01:52:04,583
Real goons?

1104
01:52:08,833 --> 01:52:10,542
But why didn't you hit back?

1105
01:52:13,792 --> 01:52:16,042
Why did you quietly take their beating?

1106
01:52:18,708 --> 01:52:20,542
I wanted to see...

1107
01:52:21,708 --> 01:52:27,083
whether it hurts you to see me in pain.

1108
01:52:31,333 --> 01:52:32,333
It does.

1109
01:52:45,333 --> 01:52:46,708
Where's your ring?

1110
01:52:47,833 --> 01:52:49,208
Maybe they've...

1111
01:57:48,042 --> 01:57:51,208
Krrish! Krrish!

1112
01:58:03,833 --> 01:58:07,583
Not once did it occur to me
that Christian could also be Krrish!

1113
01:58:07,917 --> 01:58:09,958
He was also there
at the circus that night!

1114
01:58:10,792 --> 01:58:13,458
Had it struck me that night--

1115
01:58:13,583 --> 01:58:15,333
I wouldn't have got a thrashing!

1116
01:58:17,583 --> 01:58:19,583
I've said sorry, haven't I?

1117
01:58:19,958 --> 01:58:21,458
What else do you want me to do?

1118
01:58:23,583 --> 01:58:25,083
Close your eyes.

1119
01:58:25,833 --> 01:58:27,083
Again you...

1120
01:58:32,667 --> 01:58:34,333
Now open them.

1121
01:58:35,833 --> 01:58:37,208
How did you get it back?

1122
01:58:37,333 --> 01:58:39,708
Krrish, he's my friend.

1123
01:58:40,208 --> 01:58:41,792
Wouldn't he do this much for me?

1124
01:58:55,667 --> 01:58:56,708
Take it.

1125
01:58:57,458 --> 01:59:00,292

Priya! Priya!

1177
02:04:39,292 --> 02:04:40,542
Move from there.

1178
02:04:40,667 --> 02:04:42,292
Priya, you're watching TV here,

1179
02:04:42,417 --> 02:04:45,667
and the boss has ordered us
to vacate Krishna's apartment.

1180
02:04:46,917 --> 02:04:49,833
Hello! Are you listening?

1181
02:04:49,958 --> 02:04:52,208
I am and am not.

1182
02:04:59,583 --> 02:05:01,417
What's this?

1183
02:05:02,083 --> 02:05:04,542
-Remember the explosion at the circus?
-Yes.

1184
02:05:04,708 --> 02:05:07,958
I had passed out,
but I think the camera was still on.

1185
02:05:08,958 --> 02:05:12,417
Now switch off the TV and
think about Krishna! Please!

1186
02:05:19,833 --> 02:05:21,083
What happened?

1187
02:05:21,333 --> 02:05:23,583
I'll rewind and show you.

1188
02:05:40,583 --> 02:05:41,958
Krishna is Krrish!

1189
02:05:48,167 --> 02:05:49,458
What happened?

1190
02:05:50,333 --> 02:05:52,333
-Let's go, Honey.
-Why are you girls screaming?

1191
02:05:52,417 --> 02:05:53,667
-Hurry up.
-Aunt.

1192
02:05:53,792 --> 02:05:55,583
-Where are you both going?
-Mom, office!

1193
02:05:55,667 --> 02:05:57,083
-Office?
-Come on Honey!

1194
02:05:57,208 --> 02:05:59,292
To get our jobs back! Okay bye!

1195
02:06:00,958 --> 02:06:02,583
Priya, your mobile.

1196
02:06:03,542 --> 02:06:04,458
Hello Priya?

1197
02:06:05,083 --> 02:06:06,792
No, I'm Priya's mother.

1198
02:06:08,292 --> 02:06:11,167
Mother? Hello.

1199
02:06:11,458 --> 02:06:13,083
When did you return from Hong Kong?

1200
02:06:13,708 --> 02:06:17,458
Hong Kong? I didn't go anywhere.
I've been right here.

1201
02:06:17,833 --> 02:06:19,583
Who are you?

1202
02:06:20,333 --> 02:06:23,292
It's me, Krishna.

1203
02:06:23,417 --> 02:06:24,583
Krishna who?

1204
02:06:26,958 --> 02:06:29,958
Priya has told you everything
about me, hasn't she?

1205
02:06:30,792 --> 02:06:33,667
No, Priya has said nothing about you.

1206
02:06:38,292 --> 02:06:40,458
You are Priya's mother, aren't you?

1207
02:06:40,583 --> 02:06:43,083
Yes, I'm Priya's mother.

1208
02:06:44,333 --> 02:06:45,708
Where's Priya?

1209
02:06:45,833 --> 02:06:47,958
Priya left for office just now.

1210
02:06:48,833 --> 02:06:50,292
Office?

1211
02:06:51,333 --> 02:06:53,333
Okay. Thank you.

1212
02:06:57,208 --> 02:07:03,458
Priya, do you realize?
Once this footage is telecast...

1213
02:07:05,167 --> 02:07:09,042
our Krishna will become
a world famous celebrity!

1214
02:07:10,083 --> 02:07:12,833
There's something about our Krishna!

1215
02:07:12,958 --> 02:07:15,458
He fooled us so convincingly.

1216
02:07:15,583 --> 02:07:18,958
In India, as Kalicharan,
and here, as Krrish!

1217
02:07:19,083 --> 02:07:21,708
Didn't I tell you Honey,
the truth always comes out?

1218
02:07:24,708 --> 02:07:28,083
Look Priya, the truth about Krishna
the world is about to discover,

1219
02:07:28,208 --> 02:07:29,417
is because you lied!

1220
02:07:29,542 --> 02:07:33,708
The lie that you love him brought
him here all the way from India.

1221
02:07:40,167 --> 02:07:41,708
A lie sometimes leads to very big gains.

1222
02:08:03,542 --> 02:08:05,583
You didn't even tell me!

1223
02:08:07,333 --> 02:08:08,917
What could I say?

1224
02:08:10,292 --> 02:08:14,958
When his honesty turned my
feigned love into a genuine one...

1225
02:08:16,917 --> 02:08:18,458
I didn't even realize.

1226
02:08:33,167 --> 02:08:35,458
Krishna, Krishna.

1227
02:08:37,667 --> 02:08:39,458
The culprit has been caught at last!

1228
02:08:41,083 --> 02:08:43,958
He did his best to hide his identity,
you know.

1229
02:08:44,667 --> 02:08:47,958
But I finally discovered
who the real Krrish is!

1230
02:08:49,458 --> 02:08:51,208
Why did you lie to me?

1231
02:08:52,083 --> 02:08:54,042
Why did you keep me in the dark?

1232
02:08:55,208 --> 02:08:58,417
Where was the need to hide
behind a mask, even with me?

1233
02:09:02,833 --> 02:09:04,208
You're asking this Priya?

1234
02:09:06,208 --> 02:09:08,208
Someone who has never
been honest with me.

1235
02:09:10,333 --> 02:09:12,708
Someone who kept me
in the dark till today.

1236
02:09:15,833 --> 02:09:17,708
I have been unmasked Priya.

1237
02:09:23,542 --> 02:09:24,833
What about you?

1238
02:09:27,083 --> 02:09:27,958
What do you mean?

1239
02:09:29,833 --> 02:09:31,958
Why did you lie to
me that you loved me?

1240
02:09:34,083 --> 02:09:36,583
I took your lies for
the truth and came here...

1241
02:09:37,708 --> 02:09:40,042
to ask your mother
for your hand in marriage.

1242
02:09:42,667 --> 02:09:44,708
But you lied about her too!

1243
02:09:46,917 --> 02:09:48,333
Yes, Priya.

1244
02:09:49,833 --> 02:09:51,583
I've spoken to your mother.

1245
02:09:56,542 --> 02:09:57,958
Krishna..

1246
02:10:02,958 --> 02:10:05,292
I admit, I lied to you in the beginning.

1247
02:10:06,083 --> 02:10:07,458
But now...

1248
02:10:10,042 --> 02:10:11,833
I really love you Krishna.

1249
02:10:11,958 --> 02:10:14,917
Stop it, Priya! Stop it!

1250
02:10:16,208 --> 02:10:18,333
You may have more lies to tell me.

1251
02:10:20,292 --> 02:10:23,458
But I don't have the strength
to take them for the truth anymore!

1252
02:10:23,583 --> 02:10:26,458
Listen to me, Krishna!
I've done all this only for you.

1253
02:10:26,833 --> 02:10:29,042
I wanted to see you
become a very big man,

1254
02:10:29,167 --> 02:10:31,167
and that's about to
happen in just a few hours.

1255
02:10:31,208 --> 02:10:32,333
The whole world will get to know

1256
02:10:32,417 --> 02:10:33,708
about your extraordinary
powers and talent.

1257
02:10:33,792 --> 02:10:35,458
That's exactly what I didn't want!

1258
02:10:36,083 --> 02:10:38,833
Why do you think I wore the mask?

1259
02:10:39,958 --> 02:10:43,708
Because I had promised grandma
that I'd keep my identity hidden.

1260
02:10:44,583 --> 02:10:47,208
That I would not let
anyone know about my powers.

1261
02:10:49,292 --> 02:10:50,667
And you...

1262
02:10:55,458 --> 02:10:57,042
Grandma was right.

1263
02:10:58,083 --> 02:11:00,083
People in the world only use each other

1264
02:11:00,208 --> 02:11:01,833
for their own selfish reasons.

1265
02:11:03,958 --> 02:11:05,333
She tried to stop me, but I--

1266
02:11:05,458 --> 02:11:07,833
But why does your
grandmother want to stop you?

1267
02:11:09,208 --> 02:11:12,167
Why does she always want
you in front of her eyes?

1268
02:11:13,708 --> 02:11:16,708
Why doesn't she want the
whole world to know of your talent?

1269
02:11:17,542 --> 02:11:19,083
-Is she not being selfish?
-Priya!

1270
02:11:23,583 --> 02:11:25,042
You really want to know?

1271
02:11:25,958 --> 02:11:27,292
Then listen!

1272
02:11:46,333 --> 02:11:50,708
Having lost her son,
grandma did not want to lose me

1273
02:11:50,833 --> 02:11:52,708
because I posses the same powers.

1274
02:12:00,083 --> 02:12:01,917
But she still let me come here...

1275
02:12:03,833 --> 02:12:05,292
for you...

1276
02:12:06,833 --> 02:12:08,958
For my feelings, she gave in.

1277
02:12:13,458 --> 02:12:15,083
But what do I tell her now?

1278
02:12:21,542 --> 02:12:24,292
Krishna, listen to me.

1279
02:12:38,208 --> 02:12:40,083
We've got to stop the
telecast of Krishna's tape.

1280
02:12:40,208 --> 02:12:41,083
Why?

1281
02:12:41,292 --> 02:12:44,333
Don't ask questions now,
just stop the telecast.

1282
02:12:44,458 --> 02:12:46,833
But the tape is with the boss.

1283
02:12:48,417 --> 02:12:50,167
Oh my God! Where's boss at the moment?

1284
02:13:48,292 --> 02:13:51,958
Twenty years ago,
you tried to make a computer

1285
02:13:52,042 --> 02:13:53,333
that could see the future.

1286
02:13:55,833 --> 02:13:58,333
What happened to that dream of yours?

1287
02:14:01,833 --> 02:14:05,417
Twenty years ago, you must
have had a lot of dreams too.

1288
02:14:05,833 --> 02:14:06,833
Did they all come true?

1289
02:14:07,958 --> 02:14:08,917
Pardon me?

1290
02:14:10,042 --> 02:14:13,333
Some questions hurt.

1291
02:14:14,208 --> 02:14:16,333
The media ought to understand.

1292
02:14:18,333 --> 02:14:24,833
That dream died with the death
of my genius friend, Rohit Mehra.

1293
02:14:26,333 --> 02:14:29,833
But from what I've read
and heard of you, Dr. Arya,

1294
02:14:30,292 --> 02:14:31,833
you don't ever accept defeat.

1295
02:14:32,333 --> 02:14:34,833
I'd have tried to win.

1296
02:14:35,917 --> 02:14:40,167
Had my genius friend been alive.

1297
02:15:02,333 --> 02:15:03,708
Krishna!

1298
02:15:06,083 --> 02:15:07,458
Krishna.

1299
02:15:11,083 --> 02:15:12,833
Anything left to say?

1300
02:15:15,292 --> 02:15:19,708
Yes, this gentleman
has something to say.

1301
02:15:25,667 --> 02:15:26,958
Who are you?

1302
02:15:27,708 --> 02:15:29,208
My name is Vikram Sinha.

1303
02:15:30,708 --> 02:15:32,167
What do you want?

1304
02:15:32,333 --> 02:15:37,333
Don't go back the way you came.

1305
02:15:38,708 --> 02:15:42,333
-What does that mean?
-I mean, you came alone...

1306
02:15:42,583 --> 02:15:43,833
don't go back alone.

1307
02:15:50,167 --> 02:15:53,083
Krishna, your father,
Rohit Mehra, is still alive.

1308
02:16:03,792 --> 02:16:04,958
What did you say?

1309
02:16:12,583 --> 02:16:17,292
This picture was taken when
your father worked for Dr. Arya.

1310
02:16:17,917 --> 02:16:20,708
And I was the Senior Security
Officer at Technotronics.

1311
02:16:21,833 --> 02:16:23,542
He was younger to me in age,

1312
02:16:24,083 --> 02:16:25,958
and I was a junior in status.

1313
02:16:26,833 --> 02:16:28,667
And yet, we were very close friends..

1314
02:16:29,458 --> 02:16:31,583
Not only because we were Indians.

1315
02:16:32,583 --> 02:16:35,042
It was because of
the sincerity in his smile.

1316
02:16:36,958 --> 02:16:38,917
And the honesty in his eyes.

1317
02:16:40,542 --> 02:16:42,167
He was always smiling.

1318
02:16:46,083 --> 02:16:49,208
But someone cast an evil eye on him.

1319
02:16:50,833 --> 02:16:52,292
It's been so many years...

1320
02:16:53,833 --> 02:16:55,583
but that time...

1321
02:16:56,542 --> 02:16:58,333
seems to have frozen.

1322
02:16:59,167 --> 02:17:01,833
That day, he was working till morning,

1323
02:17:02,083 --> 02:17:05,208
because he had to complete
his project and go back to India.

1324
02:17:07,708 --> 02:17:10,458
Mr. Vikram? Welcome!

1325
02:17:11,833 --> 02:17:13,542
I'm doing fine, chief,

1326
02:17:13,833 --> 02:17:16,542
but if you keep working
round the clock like this,

1327
02:17:16,667 --> 02:17:19,292
you're going to get insomnia.

1328
02:17:20,333 --> 02:17:22,833
I won't have to do it after today.

1329
02:17:23,583 --> 02:17:25,708
Once the computer is inaugurated today,

1330
02:17:25,833 --> 02:17:30,708
I'll hand it over to Dr. Arya
and return to my family in India.

1331
02:17:32,208 --> 02:17:33,833
I don't mind, chief..

1332
02:17:34,083 --> 02:17:37,417
but I still can't believe
that we can see the future.

1333
02:17:37,667 --> 02:17:40,417
Not believing does not
change the truth, Mr. Vikram.

1334
02:17:40,958 --> 02:17:43,292
You will believe it, when you see it?

1335
02:17:43,417 --> 02:17:45,708
What? You mean you're going to..

1336
02:17:46,042 --> 02:17:47,583
Of course!

1337
02:17:48,292 --> 02:17:52,042
Come see tomorrow, today...

1338
02:17:52,292 --> 02:17:55,458
and tell me how it
feels to see the future.

1339
02:17:55,583 --> 02:17:57,167
Please, hold this.

1340
02:18:18,958 --> 02:18:21,833
Retina scan, an identification of my eyes.

1341
02:18:58,333 --> 02:19:00,917
These two identifications of mine
are the password for this computer,

1342
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:02,708
without which it won't start up.

1343
02:19:03,417 --> 02:19:07,708
But when you're not around,
when you've gone back to India?

1344
02:19:07,833 --> 02:19:10,833
I'll change the password before I leave.

1345
02:19:10,958 --> 02:19:14,167
After that, only Dr. Arya
will be able to start the computer.

1346
02:19:17,083 --> 02:19:18,458
Tell me...

1347
02:19:19,208 --> 02:19:20,708
what would you like to see?

1348
02:19:20,792 --> 02:19:22,792
I don't want to see anything, chief!

1349
02:19:23,333 --> 02:19:25,833
But you said your wife is pregnant.

1350
02:19:27,208 --> 02:19:31,292
Let's see whether I'm going
to be an uncle to a nephew or a niece?

1351
02:19:33,292 --> 02:19:36,667
Okay then. Let's find out.

1352
02:20:04,333 --> 02:20:06,042
Nisha!

1353
02:20:09,292 --> 02:20:10,583
Nisha!

1354
02:20:11,333 --> 02:20:15,583
My darling baby.

1355
02:20:15,917 --> 02:20:19,333
Look, Nisha,
your son looks just like Rohit.

1356
02:20:19,708 --> 02:20:26,583
Now go to your Mom.
My son's coming back to me.

1357
02:20:27,833 --> 02:20:30,083
Congratulations, chief!

1358
02:20:30,208 --> 02:20:32,583
Your wife's going to
deliver a baby boy tomorrow!

1359
02:20:32,708 --> 02:20:35,708
But I'm going to distribute
sweets today! In fact, right now?

1360
02:20:35,792 --> 02:20:37,208
What did you say?

1361
02:20:37,333 --> 02:20:38,708
What happened to my Rohit?

1362
02:20:39,208 --> 02:20:40,208
What happened, mom?

1363
02:20:40,667 --> 02:20:43,833
No! That's impossible!

1364
02:20:44,292 --> 02:20:45,833
My Rohit can't be dead!

1365
02:20:47,208 --> 02:20:48,708
My Rohit is alive!

1366
02:20:48,833 --> 02:20:49,833
No!

1367
02:20:50,292 --> 02:20:51,708
No!

1368
02:20:51,833 --> 02:20:53,167
Which means, I...

1369
02:20:53,292 --> 02:20:58,083
Chief, the computer's malfunctioning!
Something's wrong with it!

1370
02:21:25,458 --> 02:21:27,292
Dr. Arya!

1371
02:21:28,208 --> 02:21:33,417
It's 6:40 there, it's 6:30 now!
This means, in just ten minutes!

1372
02:21:33,542 --> 02:21:35,083
In this very room!

1373
02:21:40,167 --> 02:21:41,708
Look! Dr. Arya!

1374
02:21:42,958 --> 02:21:45,458
Have you heard of Shahjahan,
Doctor Mathur?

1375
02:21:45,583 --> 02:21:47,458
Of course! He built the Taj Mahal.

1376
02:21:47,708 --> 02:21:49,833
Incomplete knowledge is always dangerous.

1377
02:21:49,958 --> 02:21:51,583
Shahjahan had the hands of workers

1378
02:21:51,667 --> 02:21:52,958
who built the Taj Mahal, chopped off,

1379
02:21:53,042 --> 02:21:55,458
so that there would
never be another Taj Mahal.

1380
02:21:55,542 --> 02:21:59,208
Rohit Mehra is a worker
for me and I'm his Shahjehan.

1381
02:21:59,833 --> 02:22:02,542
You mean, you're also
going to cut off Rohit's hands?

1382
02:22:02,667 --> 02:22:05,583
No, his brain!

1383
02:22:06,333 --> 02:22:09,833
Because Rohit's brain will create problems

1384
02:22:09,958 --> 02:22:11,958
for himself as well as for me.

1385
02:22:13,083 --> 02:22:14,792
Actually, I'm going to
feel very sorry about it,

1386
02:22:14,958 --> 02:22:16,667
because Rohit is a very good boy.

1387
02:22:16,833 --> 02:22:20,042
Sincere, honest, intelligent.

1388
02:22:20,292 --> 02:22:22,917
They're coming here, chief.
Please leave!

1389
02:22:23,042 --> 02:22:25,958
No, no! I'm won't let this
computer go into the wrong hands.

1390
02:22:26,042 --> 02:22:27,292
I'll destroy everything!

1391
02:22:27,417 --> 02:22:30,333
All right! I'll try and stop them!

1392
02:22:34,542 --> 02:22:36,208
-Hello!
-Mom?

1393
02:22:36,333 --> 02:22:39,208
Rohit? I've brought Nisha to the hospital.

1394
02:22:39,292 --> 02:22:42,542
Congratulations!
You're going to become a father soon.

1395
02:22:42,667 --> 02:22:44,417
Come home soon, son

1396
02:22:44,542 --> 02:22:46,833
I'm coming, mom! I'm coming!

1397
02:22:46,958 --> 02:22:52,542
Rohit, what's the matter?
You sound tense?

1398
02:22:52,667 --> 02:22:56,958
I've been exploited,
the world is very selfish!

1399
02:22:57,083 --> 02:23:01,042
Don't worry,
I'll be back, I'll be back soon.

1400
02:24:04,208 --> 02:24:06,042
Rohit!

1401
02:24:07,042 --> 02:24:09,083
What have you done?

1402
02:24:11,833 --> 02:24:17,083
I've destroyed your dream.
I've destroyed everything!

1403
02:24:18,958 --> 02:24:21,167
Because I've got
to know of your intentions.

1404
02:24:21,333 --> 02:24:28,333
But those who know me also
know that I never accept defeat.

1405
02:24:31,958 --> 02:24:34,583
I'll rebuild this compute,.

1406
02:24:34,958 --> 02:24:37,667
using your research.

1407
02:24:38,542 --> 02:24:41,542
But I don't need you anymore.

1408
02:24:49,583 --> 02:24:50,833
Hold it, sir!

1409
02:24:54,833 --> 02:24:57,083
Don't kill him, sir.

1410
02:25:01,042 --> 02:25:06,333
If you kill Rohit, then even
If you build the computer again...

1411
02:25:06,708 --> 02:25:09,333
you'll never be able to start it.

1412
02:25:11,458 --> 02:25:14,583
You need a password
to start the computer,

1413
02:25:14,958 --> 02:25:17,458
and the password is Rohit himself.

1414
02:25:20,833 --> 02:25:22,417
I've seen it with my own eyes.

1415
02:25:23,208 --> 02:25:29,208
If scans of his retina and
heartbeat aren't fed into the computer,

1416
02:25:29,583 --> 02:25:31,458
the computer will not start.

1417
02:25:39,333 --> 02:25:42,083
This means I'll have to keep you alive,

1418
02:25:42,208 --> 02:25:46,292
until I build a new computer.

1419
02:25:49,708 --> 02:25:52,833
But die, you will.

1420
02:25:54,042 --> 02:25:55,458
For the world.

1421
02:25:59,958 --> 02:26:01,583
Breaking news.

1422
02:26:01,708 --> 02:26:03,458
Tragedy strikes!

1423
02:26:03,958 --> 02:26:07,042
Following a fire that broke
out in the lab of Technotronics,.

1424
02:26:07,167 --> 02:26:11,958
the famous Indian genius Rohit
Mehra has met with a tragic death.

1425
02:26:12,833 --> 02:26:15,083
Let's observe a minute minute silence,

1426
02:26:15,208 --> 02:26:18,583
so that Rohit Mehra's soul rests in peace.

1427
02:26:30,083 --> 02:26:34,458
Ever since, I had no choice
but to work for Dr. Arya.

1428
02:26:36,167 --> 02:26:38,042
I couldn't even go to the police...

1429
02:26:40,458 --> 02:26:45,667
because if Dr. Arya doubted me,
he would've killed me.

1430
02:26:47,208 --> 02:26:50,292
And I was the only man who
could get in touch with your family.

1431
02:26:51,458 --> 02:26:53,417
That's exactly why I've been looking

1432
02:26:53,583 --> 02:26:55,708
for you and your grandma
for so many years.

1433
02:26:56,917 --> 02:26:59,583
And finally,
I met you today through Priya.

1434
02:27:34,958 --> 02:27:36,167
Dr. Arya.

1435
02:27:40,958 --> 02:27:43,167
Twenty years.

1436
02:27:45,333 --> 02:27:47,958
For 20 years,
he's kept a mother away from her son...

1437
02:27:49,208 --> 02:27:51,667
and a son away from his father.

1438
02:27:54,208 --> 02:27:56,708
It's because of his
lies that I lost my mother.

1439
02:28:05,583 --> 02:28:06,958
Where is my father?

1440
02:28:07,458 --> 02:28:09,083
Here in Singapore.

1441
02:28:09,583 --> 02:28:13,708
For 20 years Dr. Arya has used
machines to keep him in a state

1442
02:28:13,833 --> 02:28:17,333
that only his brain is alive,
his body almost dead.

1443
02:28:30,542 --> 02:28:32,708
How are you feeling today?

1444
02:28:35,042 --> 02:28:38,542
Are these machines
taking good care of you?

1445
02:28:44,917 --> 02:28:50,542
Tomorrow's the glorious and historic day,

1446
02:28:50,667 --> 02:28:56,958
when my, sorry,
our computer will be inaugurated.

1447
02:28:57,792 --> 02:29:04,583
Yes! Ours, because nothing
was possible without you.

1448
02:29:04,708 --> 02:29:09,833
For so many years, you have shown
such patience and understanding.

1449
02:29:09,958 --> 02:29:12,083
And cooperated with me.

1450
02:29:12,833 --> 02:29:17,542
When the computer starts tomorrow...

1451
02:29:19,958 --> 02:29:26,458
Your utility will come to an end,
and so will your pain.

1452
02:29:45,667 --> 02:29:48,583
Dr. Arya has suddenly been
reminded of the poet Kabir.

1453
02:29:48,958 --> 02:29:50,792
Do today, what you must do tomorrow,

1454
02:29:50,917 --> 02:29:53,083
and do right now, what you must do today.

1455
02:29:53,167 --> 02:29:59,333
That's why, Dr. Arya has decided
to start the computer today himself.

1456
02:29:59,583 --> 02:30:03,292
And also end Rohit's life.

1457
02:30:04,083 --> 02:30:07,167
Is this where my father is kept?

1458
02:30:08,333 --> 02:30:13,583
Yes! But it's almost impossible
for a stranger to get there.

1459
02:30:14,208 --> 02:30:18,083
Dr. Arya has kept very tight
security everywhere on the island.

1460
02:30:18,292 --> 02:30:21,583
So that now no one comes
between him and the computer.

1461
02:30:22,042 --> 02:30:25,458
Krishna, if Dr. Arya starts the computer,

1462
02:30:25,958 --> 02:30:30,167
how much havoc he can wreak,

1463
02:30:31,333 --> 02:30:37,833
and the destruction he
can cause is unimaginable.

1464
02:30:38,667 --> 02:30:42,167
Mine... yours... ours...

1465
02:30:43,292 --> 02:30:47,833
The worlds destiny
will come in his clutches.

1466
02:30:49,083 --> 02:30:52,083
That's why, Dr. Arya has
to be stopped at any cost.

1467
02:30:53,083 --> 02:30:55,167
Now you have to save
not only your father,

1468
02:30:55,292 --> 02:30:58,208
but the whole mankind, Krishna.

1469
02:31:04,458 --> 02:31:06,458
-Hello.
-Krishna!

1470
02:31:07,708 --> 02:31:08,583
Grandma!

1471
02:31:09,208 --> 02:31:12,167
Krishna, are you okay?

1472
02:31:14,458 --> 02:31:15,583
Yes, Grandma.

1473
02:31:16,292 --> 02:31:20,458
I don't know why I'm feeling worried.

1474
02:31:20,958 --> 02:31:22,167
When are you coming back?

1475
02:31:22,958 --> 02:31:24,708
Come back soon.

1476
02:31:25,958 --> 02:31:28,083
Your father's death
anniversary is nearing.

1477
02:31:28,542 --> 02:31:32,458
You need to be here and
fulfil the duties of a son.

1478
02:31:34,208 --> 02:31:39,083
I remember, grandma. Don't worry...

1479
02:31:41,292 --> 02:31:43,208
I'll fulfil all the duties of a son.

1480
02:32:24,667 --> 02:32:29,083
See, Rohit I've won!

1481
02:32:31,208 --> 02:32:36,583
Now if you want you can end your life.

1482
02:32:40,208 --> 02:32:43,083
Or do you want me to help?

1483
02:32:47,292 --> 02:32:49,083
But what's the hurry?

1484
02:32:50,208 --> 02:32:52,958
At least see...

1485
02:32:53,083 --> 02:32:58,208
how your invention
is going to make me God!

1486
02:33:50,917 --> 02:33:56,708
Rohit, we built this computer...

1487
02:33:58,208 --> 02:34:02,583
so that we can see
our future and change it!

1488
02:34:04,667 --> 02:34:10,792
I will also change my future
and show you today itself!

1489
02:34:19,583 --> 02:34:21,708
Dr. Arya's gone to
look for the masked man.

1490
02:34:46,667 --> 02:34:49,667
Christian! Christian! Christian!

1491
02:34:53,667 --> 02:34:54,708
Krishna!

1492
02:34:56,833 --> 02:34:57,833
Look Dr. Arya!

1493
02:35:13,292 --> 02:35:15,083
Christian!

1494
02:35:15,708 --> 02:35:19,333
What had Christian done? Why kill him?

1495
02:35:20,458 --> 02:35:25,208
Dr. Arya has probably started
the computer and, he must've seen--

1496
02:35:25,333 --> 02:35:26,917
His future!

1497
02:35:28,208 --> 02:35:33,917
It will be just as Dr. Arya has seen.

1498
02:36:11,917 --> 02:36:13,792
Krrish!

1499
02:36:17,667 --> 02:36:18,958
Krrish!

1500
02:36:19,792 --> 02:36:21,167
Krrish!

1501
02:36:56,958 --> 02:36:57,833
Justin!

1502
02:37:06,667 --> 02:37:07,583
Justin!

1503
02:37:51,208 --> 02:37:53,083
Krrish!

1504
02:41:52,208 --> 02:41:55,583
I've changed my future!
I've changed my tomorrow!

1505
02:41:55,708 --> 02:41:57,583
There is no mask any longer.

1506
02:41:57,667 --> 02:42:04,333
Henceforth the new face of God is...
Dr. Siddhant Arya!

1507
02:42:21,958 --> 02:42:24,333
I've killed him with my own hands.

1508
02:42:28,458 --> 02:42:33,917
Its 9:15 there and it's 9 here.

1509
02:42:34,708 --> 02:42:37,333
This means, he'll be here
in the next 15 minutes.

1510
02:43:02,417 --> 02:43:09,167
To capture him we
need planning not power.

1511
02:44:02,042 --> 02:44:05,833
Dr. Arya has kept very tight
security everywhere on the island.

1512
02:44:52,958 --> 02:44:55,333
I have seen the future.

1513
02:45:01,583 --> 02:45:07,208
But due to lack of time, what I
couldn't see is what I want to know.

1514
02:45:09,167 --> 02:45:11,292
Why do you want to kill me?

1515
02:45:13,292 --> 02:45:16,917
And why do you want
to rescue Rohit Mehra?

1516
02:45:22,917 --> 02:45:24,583
Who are you?

1517
02:45:25,708 --> 02:45:30,167
Come to me and give me the answer.

1518
02:45:43,917 --> 02:45:47,458
I've told you, I have seen the future,

1519
02:45:47,583 --> 02:45:52,333
and I know who is with me.

1520
02:45:52,792 --> 02:45:54,208
Hello!

1521
02:45:54,583 --> 02:45:56,583
And who is against me.

1522
02:45:57,708 --> 02:46:00,042
So, please co-operate.

1523
02:47:02,833 --> 02:47:03,958
Who are you?

1524
02:47:06,583 --> 02:47:08,792
We'll get to know right now!

1525
02:49:13,583 --> 02:49:16,667
Who are you?

1526
02:49:38,458 --> 02:49:41,208
Your son Krishna!

1527
02:50:50,042 --> 02:50:51,292
Mom.

1528
02:51:02,125 --> 02:51:03,750
Rohit!

1529
