1
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,621
<i>Hey, Nat!</i>

2
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:38,694
We're both upside down.

3
00:01:38,861 --> 00:01:40,946
And I bet you're gonna fall down first.

4
00:01:41,113 --> 00:01:42,656
No, you will.

5
00:01:43,157 --> 00:01:45,451
You can't hold it much longer.

6
00:01:48,245 --> 00:01:49,872
Told you you'd fall down first.

7
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:53,334
I told you! I told you!

8
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,962
Told you so!

9
00:01:58,839 --> 00:02:00,424
Mommy!

10
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,518
What happened?

11
00:02:11,436 --> 00:02:12,437
She fell on her knee.

12
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:14,564
You bump your knee?

13
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:19,920
Kiss it better. There we go.

14
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,949
<i>Come on, little one.</i>

15
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:25,742
<i>Get up. You're okay.</i>

16
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:28,912
Come on. You're a brave girl.

17
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:31,623
Your pain only makes you stronger.

18
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,209
- Right, you?
- Yeah.

19
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:35,377
- Yeah?
- Look!

20
00:02:35,544 --> 00:02:37,504
Forest stars.

21
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:38,672
Yeah. You know what?

22
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:42,592
Those are actually
part of the Lampyridae family.

23
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:46,304
And the glow, the glow that you see,

24
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:49,933
that comes from
a chemical reaction called...

25
00:02:50,976 --> 00:02:52,644
bioluminescence.

26
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:54,729
Come on, time for dinner.

27
00:02:55,397 --> 00:02:57,107
<i>Bio-goomin-feasants?</i>

28
00:02:57,274 --> 00:02:59,651
<i>"Bio-goomin-feasants."
That's right.</i>

29
00:03:00,777 --> 00:03:02,529
<i>Dinner!</i>

30
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:04,865
<i>Come on, dinner, big girl!</i>

31
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:08,910
I want mac and cheese.

32
00:03:08,994 --> 00:03:12,706
You want mac and cheese?
Okay. Well, I want...

33
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,791
caviar and champagne.

34
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:16,793
<i>Grab the napkins.</i>

35
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,337
You take this. Thank you.

36
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:22,257
Would you grab
the ranch dressing for Dad?

37
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:27,721
Okay.

38
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:29,639
<i>Green beans are my
favorite vegetable.</i>

39
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:32,684
Dad's home!

40
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:36,980
Hey, Dad.

41
00:03:37,522 --> 00:03:38,565
Hey, baby.

42
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:50,660
Everything okay?

43
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:55,916
How was everybody's day?

44
00:03:56,082 --> 00:03:58,084
Mommy taught me about lamp bugs.

45
00:03:58,251 --> 00:04:01,087
- Lamp bugs.
- And I fell and hurt my knee,

46
00:04:01,254 --> 00:04:03,798
but it doesn't hurt anymore.

47
00:04:03,882 --> 00:04:05,967
<i>And we also saw
fireflies in the backyard.</i>

48
00:04:06,134 --> 00:04:07,135
<i>That was my favorite part</i>

49
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:08,261
- <i>of the whole day.</i>
- No.

50
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:10,722
<i>Yelena,
we see fireflies every year.</i>

51
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:11,806
How long do we have?

52
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,476
I don't know.
Like, an hour, maybe.

53
00:04:17,187 --> 00:04:18,722
I don't wanna go.

54
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,193
Don't say that.

55
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:28,406
Girls...

56
00:04:29,783 --> 00:04:33,036
you remember when I told you that
one day we would have that big adventure?

57
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:36,716
Today's the day.

58
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,879
All right, let's go.

59
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:51,638
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:58,186 --> 00:04:59,416
<i>Come on, we gotta hurry.</i>

61
00:04:59,855 --> 00:05:01,022
- I don't have my shoes.
- Thank you, baby.

62
00:05:01,106 --> 00:05:02,816
That's okay. You don't need your shoes.

63
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:05,235
- But I'm still hungry.
- Yeah? Guess what?

64
00:05:05,402 --> 00:05:06,778
I got Fruit Roll-Ups in the car.

65
00:05:16,246 --> 00:05:18,790
No, leave it, leave it, leave it.
Go wait in the car.

66
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:27,632
- You have it?
- Yeah.

67
00:05:27,716 --> 00:05:29,843
- It's the only copy?
- It's the only one not on fire.

68
00:05:41,104 --> 00:05:42,314
Where are we going?

69
00:05:43,273 --> 00:05:44,274
Home.

70
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:46,735
Mommy, you're silly.

71
00:05:46,902 --> 00:05:48,486
We just left home.

72
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:01,666
I want my song.

73
00:06:04,336 --> 00:06:07,130
<i>Bye, bye, Miss American Pie</i>

74
00:06:07,297 --> 00:06:12,302
<i>Drove my Chevy to the levee
but the levee was dry</i>

75
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:16,849
<i>Them good old boys
were drinking whiskey and rye</i>

76
00:06:17,016 --> 00:06:21,270
<i>Singing, "This'll be the day that I die"</i>

77
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:25,608
<i>"This'll be the day that I die"</i>

78
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:56,973
<i>Come on, Yelena.
Hurry up, baby.</i>

79
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:59,267
Let's go. Come on, Nat.
Hurry up. We gotta go.

80
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:00,893
We gotta go.
Come on, you gotta run.

81
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:13,155
Come on. Honey, honey.

82
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:14,282
- Go with your mom. Go with your mom.
- Okay.

83
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:15,825
- <i>Nat, hurry up!</i>
- I'm coming!

84
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:19,078
Okay. Seat belts.

85
00:07:21,998 --> 00:07:22,999
Okay.

86
00:07:23,082 --> 00:07:24,083
Why isn't Dad in the plane?

87
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,543
He's coming. He's coming, baby.
He's coming.

88
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:08,544
Mom?

89
00:08:18,838 --> 00:08:19,805
Mom!

90
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,809
I need you up here.

91
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:27,271
- Okay.
- Okay.

92
00:08:27,438 --> 00:08:29,315
I need you to pull right.

93
00:08:33,402 --> 00:08:35,071
Mom, you've got blood on you.

94
00:08:35,238 --> 00:08:36,239
It's okay, baby.

95
00:08:55,675 --> 00:08:56,968
Hit the accelerator there.

96
00:09:06,686 --> 00:09:08,187
Hold it steady, hold it steady.

97
00:09:08,771 --> 00:09:11,816
You're gonna pull back at 55 knots.

98
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:13,317
Let's count together.

99
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:15,945
45, 50...

100
00:09:29,542 --> 00:09:30,751
Pull back.
You can do it!

101
00:09:31,586 --> 00:09:32,962
Pull back.
All your strength.

102
00:10:18,883 --> 00:10:19,884
Okay.

103
00:10:27,976 --> 00:10:29,144
Get up, Mommy.

104
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:32,523
Pain only makes you stronger, remember?

105
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,742
The Red Guardian returns.

106
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,370
The Red Guardian returns triumphant.

107
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:50,582
Please, please, I beg you.
No more undercover work.

108
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,793
I wanna get back in the action.
I want my suit back.

109
00:10:52,876 --> 00:10:53,961
I wanna get back in it.

110
00:10:54,127 --> 00:10:56,505
General Dreykov,
it's been over three years.

111
00:11:01,343 --> 00:11:02,928
Never let them take your heart.

112
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,640
Did you get it?

113
00:11:12,396 --> 00:11:14,606
And the North Institute?

114
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:16,233
Ashes.

115
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,776
It's gonna be okay.

116
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,987
<i>How is Melina?</i>

117
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:22,447
<i>She'll live. She's strong.</i>

118
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,786
- Mommy?
- Mom?

119
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,913
- Daddy!
- I'll handle this.

120
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,707
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Yelena!

121
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:33,417
- Daddy!
- Get away from her!

122
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:36,253
Don't touch her!

123
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,299
Don't touch her!

124
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,968
I will kill you all!

125
00:11:46,513 --> 00:11:47,639
Honey.

126
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:51,727
You're gonna need to hand me that gun.

127
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,066
I don't wanna go back there.

128
00:11:58,525 --> 00:12:00,319
I wanna stay in Ohio.

129
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:03,071
You can't take her.

130
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,600
You can't.

131
00:12:06,366 --> 00:12:07,993
She's only six.

132
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,203
You were even younger.

133
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,039
It's okay.

134
00:12:13,707 --> 00:12:14,958
Come here.

135
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,631
You're gonna be all right.

136
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:24,384
Do you know why
it's gonna be all right?

137
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:30,057
'Cause my girls are
the toughest girls in the world.

138
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:33,268
You're gonna take care
of each other, okay?

139
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:37,105
And everything,
everything's gonna be fine.

140
00:12:52,955 --> 00:12:55,374
That one, she has fire in her.

141
00:12:57,626 --> 00:12:59,044
What was her name?

142
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,463
<i>Natasha.</i>

143
00:13:06,017 --> 00:13:07,427
<i>Natasha.</i>

144
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:34,162
No!

145
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,092
Remove all the defects.

146
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,266
That one

147
00:13:54,725 --> 00:13:56,018
and her.

148
00:13:56,393 --> 00:13:57,603
<i>No!</i>

149
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:58,770
Yelena!

150
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,111
Take it! Take it! No!

151
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:15,162
<i>No!</i>

152
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,212
The Red Room is your home now.

153
00:14:23,962 --> 00:14:25,631
Get off me! No!

154
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:48,905
<i>Undercover spies in our communities.</i>

155
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,741
<i>They took on false identities,
even raised families...</i>

156
00:16:50,735 --> 00:16:53,488
<i>- They're topside, sir!
- Tier 1 has LOS!</i>

157
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:56,324
We've got all exits covered.

158
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:58,493
All right. Stay alert.

159
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,328
I'm sending in Alpha squad.

160
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:11,631
Natasha Romanoff is in violation
of the Sokovia Accords.

161
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,716
<i>She assaulted the king of Wakanda.</i>

162
00:17:13,883 --> 00:17:15,176
<i>Make an example out of her.</i>

163
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:22,170
Yeah?

164
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:23,208
Don't do this.

165
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,561
Do what?

166
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:26,263
Come after me.

167
00:17:26,729 --> 00:17:28,773
I mean, you're embarrassing yourself.
It looks desperate.

168
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,734
<i>Thought maybe you'd be
calling me to cut a deal.</i>

169
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:34,571
<i>'Cause from my vantage point,</i>

170
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,030
<i>it's the federal fugitive</i>

171
00:17:36,197 --> 00:17:37,282
who's desperate.

172
00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:40,410
<i>From my vantage point,
you look like you could use some bed rest.</i>

173
00:17:40,577 --> 00:17:42,370
<i>What is this, your second triple bypass?</i>

174
00:17:42,537 --> 00:17:44,747
I wouldn't worry about me.

175
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:47,166
We got Barton, we got Wilson
and that other guy,

176
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,127
the incredible shrinking convict.

177
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:52,005
<i>Rogers is on the run.
You got no friends.</i>

178
00:17:52,463 --> 00:17:53,631
Where you gonna go?

179
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:56,134
I've lived a lot of lives
before I met you, Ross.

180
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:58,887
You shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble. I'm done.

181
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:01,556
Romanoff?

182
00:18:27,457 --> 00:18:29,542
Got an empty nest,
Secretary Ross.

183
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,169
Her tracker, sir.

184
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:53,700
Eyes on target.
Waiting for the package.

185
00:18:55,361 --> 00:18:57,405
I have sights on collateral one.

186
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:03,669
Firing in place of three.

187
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:04,904
<i>Five,</i>

188
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:06,086
<i>four...</i>

189
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:09,250
<i>She made us.
Target deployed smoke.</i>

190
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,961
She's on foot with the package.
Stay high. I'm going to ground.

191
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:28,287
Oksana.

192
00:20:30,748 --> 00:20:31,749
No.

193
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,709
What did I do?

194
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:35,669
Free the others.

195
00:20:45,095 --> 00:20:47,264
Yelena, we need a status report.

196
00:20:51,143 --> 00:20:53,646
<i>Yelena, we need a status report.</i>

197
00:21:00,778 --> 00:21:02,821
Converge on team leader.

198
00:21:07,368 --> 00:21:10,079
<i>General Dreykov,
we have a deserter.</i>

199
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:13,666
<i>Permission to activate
Taskmaster Protocol?</i>

200
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:38,983
Smile.

201
00:22:53,273 --> 00:22:54,683
You're in my bed.

202
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:56,811
I'm... I'm not even under the covers.

203
00:22:56,978 --> 00:22:58,104
Did you get everything on my list?

204
00:22:58,271 --> 00:23:03,485
Got passports, entry visas,
a couple of local driver's licenses.

205
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,072
Mix and match, you should be able to
stretch it to 20 or so identities.

206
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:08,865
Fanny Longbottom?

207
00:23:09,032 --> 00:23:10,825
- What?
- What, are you 12?

208
00:23:10,992 --> 00:23:13,079
That is a legitimate name.

209
00:23:14,663 --> 00:23:17,040
We've got a... generator outside.

210
00:23:17,207 --> 00:23:20,168
It's petrol-powered. And the septic tank
will need a flush in a couple of weeks,

211
00:23:20,335 --> 00:23:22,003
but, you know,
I've got a guy coming for that.

212
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,090
You have to haul your rubbish into town.
It's just a 20-minute drive.

213
00:23:25,257 --> 00:23:28,301
I've got your basic hardware kit
stashed under the stairs.

214
00:23:28,843 --> 00:23:29,770
Nice.

215
00:23:30,595 --> 00:23:31,888
Are you okay?

216
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,181
Why wouldn't I be?

217
00:23:33,348 --> 00:23:36,268
I hear things. You know, something
about the Avengers getting divorced...

218
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:38,262
It's fine.

219
00:23:39,145 --> 00:23:40,272
I'm actually better on my own.

220
00:23:40,438 --> 00:23:41,439
Are you sure?

221
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,191
Yeah.

222
00:23:43,608 --> 00:23:44,901
Because you can tell me, you know.

223
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:46,736
That's the way
the whole friends thing works.

224
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:49,739
I know. I have friends.

225
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:52,784
People who have friends don't call me.

226
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:00,917
And I don't pay you to worry.

227
00:24:16,224 --> 00:24:17,350
Hey.

228
00:24:18,602 --> 00:24:19,644
What's all this junk?

229
00:24:20,228 --> 00:24:22,898
Just some mail and personals
from the Budapest safe house.

230
00:24:23,815 --> 00:24:24,816
Budapest?

231
00:24:24,983 --> 00:24:26,985
Yeah. Budapest.

232
00:24:27,152 --> 00:24:29,321
- No, it's "Budapest."
- Budapest.

233
00:24:29,487 --> 00:24:30,572
Budapest.

234
00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:32,824
- It's "Budapest."
- Whatever.

235
00:24:32,991 --> 00:24:36,203
I knew you weren't going back there,
so I've got someone else in the flat now.

236
00:24:36,369 --> 00:24:38,663
Sorry you went through the trouble.
I would've told you to chuck it.

237
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,957
Well, if you don't want it,
throw it in the rubbish.

238
00:25:07,067 --> 00:25:08,485
<i>You're not a sportsman,
Mr. Bond.</i>

239
00:25:08,652 --> 00:25:10,362
Why did you break up the encounter

240
00:25:10,445 --> 00:25:11,530
with my pet python?

241
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:14,157
Because I discovered
he had a crush on me.

242
00:25:17,536 --> 00:25:18,620
<i>Moonraker 1
on preset launch program...</i>

243
00:25:18,703 --> 00:25:19,788
Great.

244
00:25:19,955 --> 00:25:21,414
<i>...minus two minutes.</i>

245
00:25:21,998 --> 00:25:22,999
<i>Retract crew access...</i>

246
00:27:02,682 --> 00:27:05,411
I'm pretty sure Ross
has no jurisdiction here.

247
00:27:08,397 --> 00:27:10,967
And you should know I'm a better shot
when I'm pissed off.

248
00:28:14,297 --> 00:28:15,882
You're not here for me.

249
00:30:05,065 --> 00:30:06,125
Shit.

250
00:31:02,882 --> 00:31:04,508
<i>I know you're out there.</i>

251
00:31:06,552 --> 00:31:08,304
I know you know I'm out here.

252
00:31:14,518 --> 00:31:17,606
<i>Then why are you skulking about
like it's a minefield?</i>

253
00:31:17,773 --> 00:31:19,733
'Cause I don't know
if I can trust you.

254
00:31:20,616 --> 00:31:22,819
<i>Funny, I was going to
say the same thing.</i>

255
00:31:26,073 --> 00:31:28,033
So, we gonna talk
like grown-ups?

256
00:31:30,494 --> 00:31:31,745
Is that what we are?

257
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,799
Put it down before I make you.

258
00:31:43,966 --> 00:31:45,050
You put yours down.

259
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:47,487
Watch your step.

260
00:32:09,032 --> 00:32:10,742
Stay down. Stay down.

261
00:32:11,118 --> 00:32:12,228
Stay down.

262
00:33:08,592 --> 00:33:09,528
Stop.

263
00:33:38,497 --> 00:33:40,207
You had to come
to Budapest, didn't you?

264
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:43,502
I came here because I
thought you wouldn't.

265
00:33:44,336 --> 00:33:47,381
But since you're here,
what bullet does that?

266
00:33:50,175 --> 00:33:51,802
Not bullets. Arrows.

267
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:53,053
Right.

268
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:56,390
If you didn't think I'd come here,
why'd you send me this?

269
00:33:57,015 --> 00:33:58,433
You brought it back here?

270
00:34:00,894 --> 00:34:03,480
I'm not here trying to be your friend,
but you need to tell me what that is.

271
00:34:03,647 --> 00:34:05,065
It's a synthetic gas.

272
00:34:05,232 --> 00:34:07,609
The counteragent to chemical subjugation.

273
00:34:07,776 --> 00:34:09,486
The gas immunizes
the brain's neuropathways

274
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,571
from external manipulation.

275
00:34:10,737 --> 00:34:12,030
Maybe in English next time?

276
00:34:16,201 --> 00:34:18,662
Why don't you take it
to one of your super-scientist friends?

277
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:19,955
They can explain it to you.

278
00:34:20,122 --> 00:34:21,623
Tony Stark, maybe?

279
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:24,293
Yeah. We're not really
talking right now, so...

280
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:26,420
Great. Perfect timing.

281
00:34:26,587 --> 00:34:28,672
Where's an Avenger when you need one?

282
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:29,840
I don't wanna be here.

283
00:34:30,007 --> 00:34:32,259
I'm on the run.
You could've gotten me killed.

284
00:34:32,426 --> 00:34:34,011
Well, what was I supposed to do?

285
00:34:34,094 --> 00:34:37,097
You're the only superhero person
that I know.

286
00:34:39,224 --> 00:34:41,059
That was the whole reason
I sent it to you.

287
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:45,606
I kept checking the news,

288
00:34:45,772 --> 00:34:50,194
expecting to see Captain America
bringing down the Red Room.

289
00:34:54,764 --> 00:34:55,465
What?

290
00:34:56,783 --> 00:34:58,911
Taking down the Red Room?
What are you talking about?

291
00:34:59,077 --> 00:35:00,662
It's been gone for years.

292
00:35:01,622 --> 00:35:02,664
Dreykov's dead.

293
00:35:03,207 --> 00:35:04,208
I killed him.

294
00:35:04,374 --> 00:35:06,160
You don't actually believe that, do you?

295
00:35:11,715 --> 00:35:13,075
You really do believe that.

296
00:35:13,342 --> 00:35:14,660
Dreykov's dead.

297
00:35:14,927 --> 00:35:17,179
It took almost destroying the entire city
just to get to him.

298
00:35:17,346 --> 00:35:18,931
If you're so sure,
then tell me what happened.

299
00:35:19,097 --> 00:35:20,724
Tell me exactly.

300
00:35:21,683 --> 00:35:22,684
We rigged bombs.

301
00:35:22,851 --> 00:35:24,353
- Who's "we"?
- Clint Barton.

302
00:35:24,937 --> 00:35:27,565
Killing Dreykov was the final step
in my defection to S.H.I.E.L.D.

303
00:35:29,734 --> 00:35:31,110
Simple as that?

304
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,198
Yeah, sure, "simple."

305
00:35:35,782 --> 00:35:37,700
That's what I'd call imploding
a five-story building

306
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:40,654
and then shooting it out
with the Hungarian Special Forces.

307
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,165
Took 10 days in hiding before we
could even get out of Budapest.

308
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:45,917
And you checked the body?

309
00:35:46,084 --> 00:35:47,669
Confirmed the kill?

310
00:35:51,172 --> 00:35:53,007
There was no body left to check.

311
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:56,803
You're forgetting Dreykov's daughter.

312
00:36:56,446 --> 00:36:57,739
Where are we trying to get?

313
00:36:57,906 --> 00:36:59,908
Motorbike! East side
of the building.

314
00:37:31,271 --> 00:37:32,315
I got you!

315
00:37:34,901 --> 00:37:35,828
No!

316
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:56,798
Hey.

317
00:37:57,173 --> 00:37:59,008
Don't move. You're hurt.

318
00:37:59,175 --> 00:38:00,385
Let me help you.

319
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:16,685
I don't wanna do this.

320
00:38:19,737 --> 00:38:21,781
- What are you doing?
- He's making me.

321
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:53,346
Do you believe me now?

322
00:38:55,148 --> 00:38:56,566
How many others?

323
00:38:56,733 --> 00:38:57,909
Enough.

324
00:39:11,214 --> 00:39:12,015
Which one's yours?

325
00:39:12,081 --> 00:39:13,499
Black. Brown seat.

326
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:15,543
Where are my keys?

327
00:39:20,006 --> 00:39:21,007
Any day now.

328
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:03,759
You can't just steal a guy's car.

329
00:40:03,926 --> 00:40:05,761
So you want me to chase him down
and un-steal it?

330
00:40:09,848 --> 00:40:11,892
- Okay. Any time now, please.
- Shut up.

331
00:40:46,468 --> 00:40:47,595
Okay, you got a plan,

332
00:40:47,761 --> 00:40:49,221
or shall I just stay duck-and-cover?

333
00:40:49,388 --> 00:40:50,681
Yeah, my plan was to drive us away.

334
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:52,224
That's a shit plan.

335
00:41:05,112 --> 00:41:06,113
You're welcome.

336
00:41:19,418 --> 00:41:20,669
Shit. He's back.

337
00:41:33,307 --> 00:41:34,308
Put your seat belt on.

338
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:35,684
You're such a mom.

339
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,134
Natasha, no.

340
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,345
I think I'm bleeding. I'm...

341
00:42:13,472 --> 00:42:15,307
No. Not now, trust me.

342
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,861
You okay?

343
00:43:09,612 --> 00:43:11,239
Yeah. Great plan.

344
00:43:12,448 --> 00:43:15,192
I love the part where
I almost bled to death.

345
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,454
This is cozy.

346
00:43:18,621 --> 00:43:21,207
Barton and I spent two days
hiding out up here.

347
00:43:21,582 --> 00:43:22,958
That must have been fun.

348
00:43:24,418 --> 00:43:26,086
Who the hell is that guy?

349
00:43:26,253 --> 00:43:27,630
Dreykov's special project.

350
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,174
He can mimic anyone he's ever seen.

351
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:31,467
It's like fighting a mirror.

352
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:34,303
Dreykov only deploys him
for top-priority missions.

353
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:36,138
This doesn't make any sense.

354
00:43:36,305 --> 00:43:39,767
Well, the truth rarely makes sense
when you omit key details.

355
00:43:41,602 --> 00:43:42,895
What is that supposed to mean?

356
00:43:43,062 --> 00:43:45,023
You didn't say one word
about Dreykov's daughter.

357
00:43:46,441 --> 00:43:47,734
You killed her.

358
00:43:48,401 --> 00:43:49,778
I had to.

359
00:43:51,071 --> 00:43:52,739
I needed her to lead me to Dreykov.

360
00:43:54,074 --> 00:43:56,576
<i>We need confirmation
Dreykov's in the building.</i>

361
00:43:58,328 --> 00:43:59,621
His car is pulling up now.

362
00:44:17,222 --> 00:44:19,599
Dreykov's daughter was collateral damage.

363
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,436
I needed her to be sure.

364
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:25,146
<i>Natasha, we clear?</i>

365
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,441
All clear.

366
00:44:32,946 --> 00:44:35,073
And here you are, not so sure.

367
00:44:35,848 --> 00:44:37,642
I needed out.

368
00:44:53,341 --> 00:44:55,051
The Red Room's still active. Where is it?

369
00:44:55,218 --> 00:44:56,219
I have no idea.

370
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:59,139
He moves location constantly.

371
00:44:59,306 --> 00:45:03,768
And every widow is sedated
on entry and exit for maximum security.

372
00:45:05,228 --> 00:45:08,481
I'm just finding it hard to believe
that he could stay off my radar.

373
00:45:08,648 --> 00:45:12,194
Well, it's not smart to attack an Avenger
if you want to stay hidden.

374
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,529
I mean, the clue is in the name.

375
00:45:14,696 --> 00:45:15,989
Dreykov kills you,

376
00:45:16,156 --> 00:45:18,909
one of the big ones comes to avenge you.

377
00:45:19,075 --> 00:45:20,410
Wait, what are the big ones?

378
00:45:20,577 --> 00:45:24,956
Well, I doubt the god from space
has to take an ibuprofen after a fight.

379
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:29,628
Where did you think I was all this time?

380
00:45:33,006 --> 00:45:36,718
I thought that you got out
and were living a normal life.

381
00:45:38,511 --> 00:45:40,138
And you just never made contact again?

382
00:45:40,305 --> 00:45:42,182
Honestly, I thought
you didn't wanna see me.

383
00:45:43,665 --> 00:45:44,693
Bullshit.

384
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,729
You just didn't want
your baby sister to tag along,

385
00:45:47,896 --> 00:45:49,606
<i>whilst you saved the world
with the cool kids.</i>

386
00:45:49,773 --> 00:45:51,333
You weren't really my sister.

387
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:57,614
And the Avengers
aren't really your family.

388
00:45:58,323 --> 00:46:00,158
- Why do you always do that thing?
- Do what?

389
00:46:00,325 --> 00:46:02,286
The thing you do when you're fighting.

390
00:46:02,953 --> 00:46:05,288
The... Like, the...

391
00:46:06,414 --> 00:46:08,208
This thing that you do

392
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:10,418
when you whip your hair
when you're fighting

393
00:46:10,585 --> 00:46:12,045
with the arm and the hair.

394
00:46:12,128 --> 00:46:14,548
And you do, like,
a fighting pose.

395
00:46:14,631 --> 00:46:15,674
It's a...

396
00:46:16,258 --> 00:46:18,051
It's a fighting pose.
You're a total poser.

397
00:46:18,218 --> 00:46:19,436
I'm not a poser.

398
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,138
Come on.
I mean, they're great poses,

399
00:46:22,305 --> 00:46:24,975
but it does look like you think
everyone's looking at you, like,

400
00:46:25,141 --> 00:46:26,142
all the time.

401
00:46:26,226 --> 00:46:29,646
All that time that I spent posing,
I was trying to actually do something good

402
00:46:29,813 --> 00:46:33,233
to make up for all the...
pain and suffering that we caused.

403
00:46:33,608 --> 00:46:35,777
Trying to be more
than just a trained killer.

404
00:46:38,321 --> 00:46:41,074
Well, then you were fooling yourself

405
00:46:41,783 --> 00:46:45,579
because pain and suffering is every day
and we are both still a trained killer.

406
00:46:45,996 --> 00:46:48,957
Except I'm not the one
that's on the cover of a magazine.

407
00:46:49,124 --> 00:46:51,334
I'm not the killer
that little girls call their hero.

408
00:47:09,853 --> 00:47:10,854
That gas,

409
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,273
the counteragent,

410
00:47:13,607 --> 00:47:15,192
it was synthesized in secret

411
00:47:15,275 --> 00:47:18,028
by an older widow
from Melina's generation.

412
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,573
I was on the mission to retrieve it,
and she exposed me

413
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:25,577
and I killed the widow that freed me.

414
00:47:25,994 --> 00:47:27,329
Did you have a choice?

415
00:47:27,495 --> 00:47:30,290
What you experienced
was psychological conditioning.

416
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:34,836
I'm talking about chemically
altering brain functions.

417
00:47:35,003 --> 00:47:37,214
They're two completely different things.

418
00:47:37,881 --> 00:47:41,635
You're fully conscious,
but you don't know which part is you.

419
00:47:41,801 --> 00:47:43,428
I'm still not sure.

420
00:47:53,063 --> 00:47:54,898
Is that all there is left?

421
00:47:55,858 --> 00:48:00,071
It's the only thing that can stop Dreykov
and his network of widows.

422
00:48:02,532 --> 00:48:04,158
He takes more every day.

423
00:48:04,534 --> 00:48:07,119
Children who don't have anyone
to protect them.

424
00:48:07,286 --> 00:48:08,538
Just like us when we were small.

425
00:48:09,163 --> 00:48:11,666
Maybe one in 20 survives the training,
becomes a widow.

426
00:48:11,832 --> 00:48:13,209
The rest, he kills.

427
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:16,170
To him, we are just things.

428
00:48:17,547 --> 00:48:20,591
Weapons with no face
that he can just throw away.

429
00:48:21,551 --> 00:48:24,512
Because there is always more.

430
00:48:25,054 --> 00:48:28,349
And no one's even looking for him,
thanks to you and Alexei.

431
00:48:28,516 --> 00:48:30,142
Alexei?

432
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:33,354
"Dad."

433
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,951
Did you ever look for your parents?
Your real ones?

434
00:48:49,161 --> 00:48:52,790
Well, my mom abandoned me
in the street like garbage.

435
00:48:56,043 --> 00:48:57,095
What about you?

436
00:48:58,296 --> 00:49:01,966
They destroyed my birth certificate,
so I reinvented it.

437
00:49:02,884 --> 00:49:05,094
My parents still live in Ohio.

438
00:49:06,178 --> 00:49:08,097
My sister moved out west.

439
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:09,181
Is that right?

440
00:49:09,265 --> 00:49:10,892
You're a science teacher.

441
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,897
You're working part-time, though,
especially after you had your son.

442
00:49:16,063 --> 00:49:18,733
Your husband, he renovates houses.

443
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,794
That is not my story.

444
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,670
What is your story?

445
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,036
I never let myself be alone
long enough to think about it.

446
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:36,959
Did you ever wish for kids?

447
00:49:40,171 --> 00:49:41,698
I want a dog.

448
00:49:48,846 --> 00:49:49,972
Where you gonna go?

449
00:49:50,139 --> 00:49:51,724
I don't know.

450
00:49:53,267 --> 00:49:56,479
I don't really have
anywhere to go back to,

451
00:49:56,562 --> 00:49:58,147
so I guess anywhere.

452
00:50:04,904 --> 00:50:06,489
- Don't.
- Don't what?

453
00:50:06,972 --> 00:50:09,516
You're going to
give me some big hero speech,

454
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,401
I can feel it.

455
00:50:11,452 --> 00:50:13,120
Speeches aren't really my thing.

456
00:50:14,914 --> 00:50:16,582
It was more like an invitation.

457
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,211
To go to the Red Room and kill Dreykov?

458
00:50:20,836 --> 00:50:21,837
Yeah.

459
00:50:22,004 --> 00:50:24,257
Even though the Red Room
is impossible to find

460
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,384
and Dreykov is too slippery to kill?

461
00:50:26,592 --> 00:50:27,593
Yeah.

462
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,096
That sounds like a shitload of work.

463
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:31,873
Yup.

464
00:50:35,393 --> 00:50:36,978
Could be fun, though.

465
00:50:38,187 --> 00:50:39,197
Yup.

466
00:50:46,153 --> 00:50:47,746
I saw where he put the keys.

467
00:50:48,072 --> 00:50:50,133
Top drawer, green cabinet.

468
00:51:01,168 --> 00:51:03,045
You know, this is
the first piece of clothing

469
00:51:03,129 --> 00:51:04,630
I've ever bought for myself.

470
00:51:06,632 --> 00:51:07,709
That?

471
00:51:08,593 --> 00:51:09,594
Yeah. You don't like it?

472
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,004
Is that like a...

473
00:51:12,346 --> 00:51:13,389
Is it army surplus, or...

474
00:51:13,556 --> 00:51:15,216
Okay, it has a lot of pockets.

475
00:51:15,733 --> 00:51:17,627
But I use them all the time,

476
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:20,104
and I made some of my own
modifications.

477
00:51:20,271 --> 00:51:21,398
- Yeah?
- Whatever.

478
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:24,375
Shut up. The point is, I've never...

479
00:51:24,442 --> 00:51:27,737
I've never had control
over my own life before, and now I do.

480
00:51:27,904 --> 00:51:29,372
I want to do things.

481
00:51:31,949 --> 00:51:32,992
I like your vest.

482
00:51:33,326 --> 00:51:35,870
I knew it. I knew you did.
It's so cool, right?

483
00:51:36,037 --> 00:51:37,163
It's good. Yes. I like it.

484
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:40,708
And you can put so much stuff in there.
You wouldn't even know.

485
00:51:44,962 --> 00:51:46,839
I really don't know where
the Red Room is, though.

486
00:51:46,923 --> 00:51:48,708
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

487
00:51:49,175 --> 00:51:51,611
But I think I know somebody who does.

488
00:51:52,178 --> 00:51:53,179
Yeah? Who?

489
00:51:53,888 --> 00:51:55,514
We're gonna need a jet.

490
00:51:57,183 --> 00:51:58,643
I said we needed a jet.

491
00:51:59,518 --> 00:52:01,051
Yeah, you know what
you didn't give me?

492
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:01,686
Time.

493
00:52:01,729 --> 00:52:03,314
Or money. I'm not made of jets.

494
00:52:03,481 --> 00:52:04,982
I thought you were
supposed to be the best.

495
00:52:05,067 --> 00:52:06,068
Like a real pro.

496
00:52:06,235 --> 00:52:07,444
I beg your pardon, tsarina.

497
00:52:07,611 --> 00:52:09,404
Was the free flat
and lifetime supply of kissel

498
00:52:09,488 --> 00:52:10,856
not to your liking?

499
00:52:11,323 --> 00:52:12,908
Don't let her wind you up.

500
00:52:13,075 --> 00:52:15,494
No, I take exception
to impugning my professionalism.

501
00:52:15,661 --> 00:52:18,998
Well, you did set me up with a generator
that crapped out after six hours.

502
00:52:19,665 --> 00:52:21,917
You, too? Tag team.

503
00:52:22,084 --> 00:52:25,170
He's sensitive.
See why you keep him around.

504
00:52:25,337 --> 00:52:26,597
<i>Where's the rest?</i>

505
00:52:33,387 --> 00:52:34,538
<i>Voilà.</i>

506
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,184
I stashed that, like, five years ago.

507
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:42,321
How is it?

508
00:52:43,146 --> 00:52:44,264
It's dry.

509
00:52:44,589 --> 00:52:46,023
It's really dry.

510
00:52:50,904 --> 00:52:53,031
You know, you're getting dangerously close
to running out your tab.

511
00:52:54,366 --> 00:52:57,160
Supplies I can tally, but you bring me
attention from the authorities,

512
00:52:57,244 --> 00:52:58,871
all my prices go up.

513
00:53:00,914 --> 00:53:01,999
What's that supposed to mean?

514
00:53:02,165 --> 00:53:05,210
Your mate, Secretary Ross,
has been sniffing around my affairs

515
00:53:05,377 --> 00:53:08,338
to the point at which I've got
contacts declining my calls.

516
00:53:08,505 --> 00:53:10,424
I'm a private contractor.

517
00:53:11,842 --> 00:53:13,427
You are sensitive.

518
00:53:13,594 --> 00:53:15,137
You're a very annoying individual.

519
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:18,966
I'll make it up to you.

520
00:53:20,392 --> 00:53:21,785
That's what you say every time.

521
00:53:27,858 --> 00:53:30,652
So, I have the nuclear code.

522
00:53:30,819 --> 00:53:34,281
But there he is.

523
00:53:35,032 --> 00:53:38,994
- Captain America!
- America.

524
00:53:40,245 --> 00:53:45,292
Finally, the Red Guardian's time has come!

525
00:53:46,627 --> 00:53:48,670
I grab hold of his shield

526
00:53:49,546 --> 00:53:54,551
and face to face, it's a test of strength.

527
00:54:00,764 --> 00:54:01,850
No.

528
00:54:06,813 --> 00:54:08,232
That guy think he going to beat me.

529
00:54:08,398 --> 00:54:10,901
Anyway, this shield, you know,
that he carries with him

530
00:54:11,068 --> 00:54:13,862
like a precious baby blanket, you know?

531
00:54:14,029 --> 00:54:16,198
I use it to my advantage.
I take it...

532
00:54:16,365 --> 00:54:17,449
and I push him out the window.

533
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:19,677
And I make my escape.

534
00:54:20,702 --> 00:54:22,287
What year was this?

535
00:54:23,413 --> 00:54:25,916
I don't know.
Like, '83, '84.

536
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:27,084
I know.

537
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:30,462
Captain America was
still frozen in ice then.

538
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,302
Are you calling me a liar, Ursa?

539
00:54:50,731 --> 00:54:51,817
No.

540
00:54:55,946 --> 00:54:57,489
Look at the big bear.

541
00:54:57,656 --> 00:54:59,324
Gonna cry, little girl?

542
00:56:12,189 --> 00:56:14,191
Today is your lucky day, Alexei.

543
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:18,279
Move to the door on the south wall.

544
00:56:40,343 --> 00:56:41,344
Go left.

545
00:56:42,804 --> 00:56:43,846
Just don't make a scene.

546
00:56:59,362 --> 00:57:01,281
You made a scene, didn't you?

547
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:15,319
What now?

548
00:57:15,386 --> 00:57:16,721
<i>We're gettin' you outta here.</i>

549
00:57:38,026 --> 00:57:39,152
Go to the upper level.

550
00:57:43,106 --> 00:57:44,457
<i>Move your ass, super soldier.</i>

551
00:57:56,419 --> 00:57:57,712
He's never going to make it.

552
00:57:58,087 --> 00:57:59,297
Get me closer.

553
00:58:00,548 --> 00:58:01,841
You got a better idea?

554
00:58:05,929 --> 00:58:07,055
Natasha.

555
00:58:18,816 --> 00:58:20,235
Such a poser.

556
00:58:45,301 --> 00:58:46,302
Seriously?

557
00:58:49,389 --> 00:58:50,765
Sorry!

558
00:58:53,393 --> 00:58:55,444
What are you doing?
Are you kidding me?

559
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:56,980
Back up!

560
00:58:57,564 --> 00:58:59,816
We're both doing
a really good job.

561
00:59:09,659 --> 00:59:10,952
No.

562
00:59:13,037 --> 00:59:14,747
Okay. Enough of this.

563
00:59:47,405 --> 00:59:49,449
This would be a cool way to die.

564
00:59:53,203 --> 00:59:55,596
Tell me that's a good sign for us!

565
00:59:55,663 --> 00:59:56,789
Move your ass!

566
01:00:21,231 --> 01:00:22,857
Get us outta here!

567
01:01:08,404 --> 01:01:10,447
Wait!

568
01:01:37,465 --> 01:01:38,242
Yes!

569
01:01:40,227 --> 01:01:42,279
I need some help up here!

570
01:01:55,701 --> 01:01:57,369
That was exciting.

571
01:02:00,005 --> 01:02:01,983
I'm so proud of you girls.

572
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:06,070
You can't hear me?

573
01:02:07,453 --> 01:02:08,339
Okay.

574
01:02:17,496 --> 01:02:18,424
Okay.

575
01:02:19,433 --> 01:02:21,010
Why the aggression?

576
01:02:22,102 --> 01:02:23,562
Is it your time of the month?

577
01:02:23,729 --> 01:02:27,149
I don't get my period, dipshit.
I don't have a uterus.

578
01:02:27,441 --> 01:02:28,525
Or ovaries.

579
01:02:29,401 --> 01:02:30,986
Yeah. That's what happens
when the Red Room

580
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:32,488
gives you an involuntary hysterectomy.

581
01:02:32,655 --> 01:02:37,401
They kind of just go in and they rip out
all of your reproductive organs.

582
01:02:37,468 --> 01:02:40,829
They just get right in there
and they chop them all away.

583
01:02:40,996 --> 01:02:43,832
- Everything out, so you can't have babies.
- Okay, okay. Okay! Okay!

584
01:02:43,999 --> 01:02:46,502
You don't have to get
so clinical and nasty.

585
01:02:46,669 --> 01:02:48,170
Well, I was about to talk about

586
01:02:48,254 --> 01:02:50,506
- fallopian tubes, but okay.
- No.

587
01:02:51,131 --> 01:02:56,887
It means so much to me
that you came back for me.

588
01:02:57,054 --> 01:03:00,341
No. No. You're gonna tell us
how to get to the Red Room.

589
01:03:02,393 --> 01:03:04,186
Look at you! All business.

590
01:03:04,353 --> 01:03:05,771
Trust me, this isn't pleasure.

591
01:03:05,938 --> 01:03:09,984
Little Natasha,
all indoctrinated into the Western agenda.

592
01:03:10,484 --> 01:03:13,279
I chose to go west to become an Avenger.

593
01:03:13,779 --> 01:03:15,406
'Cause they treated me like family.

594
01:03:15,573 --> 01:03:17,408
Really? Family?

595
01:03:17,575 --> 01:03:19,869
Well, where are they now?

596
01:03:20,035 --> 01:03:22,705
Where is that family now?

597
01:03:22,872 --> 01:03:24,674
Tell me where the Red Room is.

598
01:03:27,209 --> 01:03:29,404
I have no idea.

599
01:03:30,087 --> 01:03:31,255
Okay?

600
01:03:36,302 --> 01:03:37,887
Come on. You and Dreykov were like...

601
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:39,054
- Dreykov?
- Yeah.

602
01:03:39,138 --> 01:03:41,557
General Dreykov, my friend?

603
01:03:42,141 --> 01:03:44,059
Gives me glory...

604
01:03:44,226 --> 01:03:47,229
Soviet Union's first
and only super soldier.

605
01:03:47,396 --> 01:03:50,566
I could have been more famous
than Captain America.

606
01:03:50,733 --> 01:03:54,153
Then he buries me in Ohio
on that stupid mission.

607
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,738
Three years!

608
01:03:55,905 --> 01:03:58,866
So tedious, boring me to tears.

609
01:04:01,827 --> 01:04:03,287
No offense?

610
01:04:04,288 --> 01:04:06,790
Then puts me in prison
for the rest of my life. Why?

611
01:04:06,957 --> 01:04:08,334
Why? Why would he put me in...
You know why?

612
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,170
'Cause maybe I want to talk
about the withering of the state.

613
01:04:11,337 --> 01:04:12,922
Or maybe I don't like
his hair or something

614
01:04:13,005 --> 01:04:14,256
and I say something casually about that.

615
01:04:14,423 --> 01:04:15,424
Maybe, you know,

616
01:04:15,507 --> 01:04:17,551
I want the Party
to feel actually like a party

617
01:04:17,718 --> 01:04:20,095
instead of this sourpuss organization.

618
01:04:20,888 --> 01:04:22,431
But instead, no.

619
01:04:22,806 --> 01:04:25,601
He puts me in prison
for the rest of my life.

620
01:04:25,768 --> 01:04:27,895
He just runs off and hides.

621
01:04:28,437 --> 01:04:31,815
I'm not even the one who, you know...

622
01:04:33,984 --> 01:04:35,820
I'm not the one who killed his daughter.

623
01:04:37,197 --> 01:04:38,949
Can we throw him
out the window now?

624
01:04:39,115 --> 01:04:41,034
I think we should wait
till we get to a higher altitude.

625
01:04:41,117 --> 01:04:42,118
All right.

626
01:04:44,955 --> 01:04:45,997
Wait, Mom Melina?

627
01:04:46,164 --> 01:04:47,766
We thought she was dead.

628
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:51,044
You cannot kill a fox that swift.

629
01:04:51,211 --> 01:04:52,379
What?

630
01:04:52,921 --> 01:04:57,133
She was the scientist, the strategist.
I was the muscle.

631
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,803
She worked directly for Dreykov
far more than I ever did.

632
01:04:59,886 --> 01:05:03,431
Wait. Are you telling me that Melina
is working for the Red Room present day?

633
01:05:03,598 --> 01:05:05,850
She works remotely outside St. Petersburg.

634
01:05:08,103 --> 01:05:10,689
I don't think we have enough
fuel for St. Petersburg.

635
01:05:10,855 --> 01:05:12,440
No, we're good. We'll make it.

636
01:05:13,066 --> 01:05:14,067
Okay.

637
01:05:34,087 --> 01:05:36,631
You should've brought
the Avengers' superjet.

638
01:05:40,802 --> 01:05:42,762
I swear, if I hear
one more word from him,

639
01:05:42,929 --> 01:05:44,764
- I will kick him in the face.
- He's the worst.

640
01:05:45,265 --> 01:05:46,350
Natasha.

641
01:05:47,017 --> 01:05:48,393
Natasha. Natasha.

642
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:51,479
Come here, I want to ask you something.

643
01:05:51,646 --> 01:05:53,565
- Come, it's important.
- What?

644
01:05:58,028 --> 01:05:59,654
Did he talk to you about me?

645
01:06:00,906 --> 01:06:02,032
What?

646
01:06:02,782 --> 01:06:06,203
Did he talk to you about me?
You know, trading war stories?

647
01:06:06,369 --> 01:06:07,370
Who? What are you talking about?

648
01:06:07,537 --> 01:06:09,389
Captain America.

649
01:06:09,956 --> 01:06:14,920
My great adversary
in this theater of geopolitical conflict.

650
01:06:15,086 --> 01:06:16,922
Not so much a nemesis.

651
01:06:17,005 --> 01:06:19,007
More like a contemporary, you know?
Coequal.

652
01:06:19,174 --> 01:06:21,384
I always thought there was
a great deal of mutual respect...

653
01:06:21,551 --> 01:06:23,595
Wait. You haven't seen
either one of us in 20 years

654
01:06:23,762 --> 01:06:25,305
and you're gonna ask me about you?

655
01:06:26,556 --> 01:06:28,600
What is with this tension?

656
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,153
Did I do something wrong?

657
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,023
Is that a serious question?

658
01:06:36,274 --> 01:06:38,276
I only ever loved you girls.

659
01:06:38,902 --> 01:06:40,946
I did my best to make sure
you would succeed

660
01:06:41,112 --> 01:06:42,948
to achieve your fullest potential,

661
01:06:43,031 --> 01:06:44,783
- and everything worked out.
- Everything worked out?

662
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:47,327
Yes. For you, yes.

663
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:51,456
We accomplished our mission in Ohio.

664
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:55,001
Yelena, you went on to become
the greatest child assassin

665
01:06:55,085 --> 01:06:56,378
the world has ever known.

666
01:06:56,545 --> 01:07:00,507
No one can match your efficiency,
your ruthlessness.

667
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:02,634
And Natasha,

668
01:07:02,968 --> 01:07:07,681
not just a spy,
not just toppling regimes,

669
01:07:07,847 --> 01:07:09,975
destroying empires from within,

670
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,310
but an Avenger.

671
01:07:13,228 --> 01:07:16,189
You both have killed

672
01:07:16,898 --> 01:07:18,733
so many people.

673
01:07:19,484 --> 01:07:22,988
Your ledgers must be dripping,
just gushing red.

674
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:25,740
I couldn't be more proud of you.

675
01:07:30,203 --> 01:07:31,496
Okay. You can... No.

676
01:07:31,663 --> 01:07:33,415
Let go of me now.

677
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:35,375
You smell really bad.

678
01:07:39,921 --> 01:07:42,257
So, are we there yet?

679
01:07:42,424 --> 01:07:44,467
You'll know when we're there.

680
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:48,179
Slight right.

681
01:07:49,514 --> 01:07:50,724
Straight on.

682
01:07:51,558 --> 01:07:52,559
Right.

683
01:07:55,145 --> 01:07:56,187
Slight right.

684
01:07:57,105 --> 01:07:59,524
Very good, my darling.

685
01:08:00,692 --> 01:08:02,861
Yes, very good.

686
01:08:03,028 --> 01:08:05,614
Yes, very good, my darling.

687
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:21,755
Back home where it's safe.
Come on. Go on.

688
01:09:10,263 --> 01:09:13,599
Honey, we're home.

689
01:09:24,777 --> 01:09:26,529
Come on, girls.

690
01:09:36,622 --> 01:09:39,333
Welcome to my humble abode.

691
01:09:39,959 --> 01:09:41,752
Make yourself at home.

692
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:45,965
Let's have a drink.

693
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:02,481
Hey, no funny business.

694
01:10:03,649 --> 01:10:05,902
I am putting away my weapon.

695
01:10:29,634 --> 01:10:30,968
Are there
any booby traps around here?

696
01:10:31,052 --> 01:10:32,136
Anything we need to know about?

697
01:10:32,303 --> 01:10:33,930
I didn't raise my girls to fall in traps.

698
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:35,548
You didn't raise us at all.

699
01:10:38,034 --> 01:10:39,377
Maybe so.

700
01:10:39,852 --> 01:10:43,147
But if you got soft,
it wasn't on my watch.

701
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:06,980
Let's drink.

702
01:11:09,257 --> 01:11:10,466
Okay.

703
01:11:21,686 --> 01:11:23,020
Still fits.

704
01:11:24,564 --> 01:11:26,232
My God.

705
01:11:29,402 --> 01:11:30,653
I never washed it once.

706
01:11:31,112 --> 01:11:32,405
Come and drink.

707
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:38,369
<i>Rise, you workers of salvation</i>

708
01:11:41,455 --> 01:11:42,849
Family...

709
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:45,877
back together again.

710
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:48,371
Seeing as our...

711
01:11:48,754 --> 01:11:49,922
family construct...

712
01:11:50,089 --> 01:11:52,884
was just a calculated ruse
that only lasted three years,

713
01:11:53,092 --> 01:11:57,388
I don't think that we can use this...
this term anymore, can we?

714
01:11:57,555 --> 01:11:58,170
Agreed.

715
01:11:58,595 --> 01:12:00,140
So, here's what's
gonna happen...

716
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:03,311
Okay. A reunion then.

717
01:12:03,477 --> 01:12:04,562
And...

718
01:12:05,313 --> 01:12:07,448
I want to say something
right off the bat.

719
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:09,442
You haven't aged a day.

720
01:12:09,609 --> 01:12:14,739
You're just as beautiful and as supple
as the day they staged our marriage.

721
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:17,700
You got fat.

722
01:12:18,467 --> 01:12:20,095
But still good.

723
01:12:21,579 --> 01:12:23,915
I just got out of prison. I...

724
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:27,376
I have a lot of energy.

725
01:12:27,752 --> 01:12:29,378
Please don't do that.

726
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:33,466
So, here's what's gonna happen.

727
01:12:33,633 --> 01:12:35,051
Natasha, don't slouch.

728
01:12:35,968 --> 01:12:37,929
- I'm not slouching.
- Yes, yes, you are.

729
01:12:38,012 --> 01:12:39,013
I don't slouch.

730
01:12:39,096 --> 01:12:40,223
You're going to get a back hunch.

731
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:41,641
- Listen to your mother.
- My God, this...

732
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:42,725
Up, up.

733
01:12:42,808 --> 01:12:44,227
All right, enough. All of you.

734
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:46,145
I didn't say anything.
That's not fair.

735
01:12:46,312 --> 01:12:47,813
- Here's what's gonna happen...
- I don't want any food.

736
01:12:47,897 --> 01:12:49,982
Eat a little something,
Yelena, for God's sake.

737
01:12:50,066 --> 01:12:51,817
You're gonna tell us
the location of the Red Room.

738
01:12:55,697 --> 01:12:58,534
You know, it's like when you told them

739
01:12:58,617 --> 01:13:00,744
that they could stay up late
to catch Santa Claus.

740
01:13:00,911 --> 01:13:02,996
What? That was fun. You know,
"He come down the chimney, girls."

741
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,414
"Look out. Where is he?"

742
01:13:04,498 --> 01:13:07,376
You wait for him,
and then when the cookies are gone,

743
01:13:07,543 --> 01:13:09,419
then you see he's there.

744
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:11,463
No, no. What? I want them

745
01:13:11,547 --> 01:13:13,273
- to follow their dreams.
- No good.

746
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:15,384
Reach for the stars, girls.

747
01:13:15,551 --> 01:13:18,053
Finding Dreykov is not a fantasy.
It's unfinished business.

748
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:21,899
You can't defeat a man who
commands the very will of others.

749
01:13:22,266 --> 01:13:26,144
You never saw the culmination
of what we started in America.

750
01:13:26,311 --> 01:13:27,646
Nor did you.

751
01:13:30,274 --> 01:13:34,528
Natasha, always focus, focus.
Get what you want.

752
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:42,661
Come in.

753
01:13:50,002 --> 01:13:51,545
Did that pig just open the door?

754
01:13:51,712 --> 01:13:53,797
Yes. It did.

755
01:13:53,964 --> 01:13:56,717
Good boy, Alexei.
Good boy.

756
01:13:57,718 --> 01:13:59,511
You named a pig after me?

757
01:14:00,137 --> 01:14:01,889
You don't see the resemblance?

758
01:14:05,851 --> 01:14:07,311
See, he sits just like dog.

759
01:14:08,312 --> 01:14:09,730
Amazing. Now, watch.

760
01:14:09,897 --> 01:14:11,189
It's a little weird, to me.

761
01:14:11,356 --> 01:14:12,858
Stop breathing.

762
01:14:18,238 --> 01:14:21,575
We infiltrated
the North Institute in Ohio.

763
01:14:21,742 --> 01:14:23,285
It was a front
for S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists.

764
01:14:23,368 --> 01:14:26,622
Actually, it was Hydra scientists
at that time.

765
01:14:26,788 --> 01:14:28,332
In conjunction with
the Winter Soldier project,

766
01:14:28,498 --> 01:14:31,376
they had dissected
and deconstructed the human brain

767
01:14:31,543 --> 01:14:36,215
to create the first and only
cellular blueprint of the basal ganglia.

768
01:14:36,381 --> 01:14:37,799
Was the hub for cognition.

769
01:14:37,966 --> 01:14:41,061
Voluntary motor movement,
procedural learning.

770
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:46,558
We didn't steal weaponry or technology.

771
01:14:46,725 --> 01:14:49,561
We stole the key to unlocking free will.

772
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:56,401
What are you doing?

773
01:14:56,526 --> 01:15:00,197
I am explaining
that the science is now so exact,

774
01:15:00,364 --> 01:15:02,574
the subject can be instructed
to stop breathing

775
01:15:02,741 --> 01:15:04,618
and has no choice but to obey.

776
01:15:04,785 --> 01:15:06,286
Okay, you made your point.
That's enough.

777
01:15:06,453 --> 01:15:09,331
Yes, all right. Well, don't worry,
Alexei could've survived

778
01:15:09,498 --> 01:15:12,084
11 more seconds without oxygen.

779
01:15:12,251 --> 01:15:15,045
Good boy. Now, you go back,
back home where it's safe.

780
01:15:16,588 --> 01:15:18,674
You go. You go back home,
back home where it's safe.

781
01:15:19,424 --> 01:15:21,093
Good boy, Alexei.

782
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:24,888
The world functions on a higher level
when it is controlled.

783
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:29,434
Dreykov has chemically subjugated agents
planted around the globe.

784
01:15:29,768 --> 01:15:31,728
And do you know who they test it on?

785
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:35,282
No. That's... that's
not my department.

786
01:15:35,565 --> 01:15:36,942
Come on, come on.

787
01:15:37,109 --> 01:15:38,986
- Don't lie to them.
- I'm not lying.

788
01:15:39,152 --> 01:15:40,612
You're Dreykov's architect?

789
01:15:40,779 --> 01:15:41,780
What were you?

790
01:15:41,864 --> 01:15:43,532
If I was his architect,
you were... you were his partner.

791
01:15:43,615 --> 01:15:44,658
You were his business partner.

792
01:15:44,741 --> 01:15:46,034
No, no, no. I was patsy!

793
01:15:46,118 --> 01:15:48,412
- Don't give me that...
- He sell me ideology.

794
01:15:48,579 --> 01:15:49,746
- Stop with the politics.
- All the while, bigger...

795
01:15:49,913 --> 01:15:52,708
Shut up! You are an idiot.

796
01:15:57,296 --> 01:15:58,797
And you're a coward.

797
01:16:01,216 --> 01:16:02,759
You're a coward.

798
01:16:02,926 --> 01:16:07,055
And our family was never real, so...
there's nothing to hold on to.

799
01:16:08,348 --> 01:16:09,850
We're moving on.

800
01:16:10,017 --> 01:16:12,352
Never family?

801
01:16:12,519 --> 01:16:15,188
In my heart, I am simple man.

802
01:16:16,106 --> 01:16:19,359
And I think that for a couple
deep undercover Russian agents

803
01:16:19,526 --> 01:16:21,570
I think we did pretty great
as parents?

804
01:16:21,862 --> 01:16:25,199
Yes, we had our orders,
and we played our roles to perfection.

805
01:16:25,741 --> 01:16:28,035
Who cares? That wasn't real.

806
01:16:28,327 --> 01:16:30,746
- What?
- That wasn't real. Who cares?

807
01:16:30,913 --> 01:16:32,364
Don't say that.

808
01:16:33,207 --> 01:16:35,751
Please don't say that.
It was real.

809
01:16:36,501 --> 01:16:39,463
It was real to me.
You are my mother.

810
01:16:40,672 --> 01:16:42,382
You were my real mother.

811
01:16:42,549 --> 01:16:45,177
The closest thing I ever had to one.

812
01:16:46,303 --> 01:16:49,139
The best part of my life was fake.

813
01:16:50,641 --> 01:16:52,976
And none of you told me.

814
01:16:55,938 --> 01:16:58,065
And those agents

815
01:16:58,148 --> 01:17:00,859
you chemically subjugated
around the globe?

816
01:17:02,444 --> 01:17:04,088
That was me.

817
01:17:10,745 --> 01:17:12,664
And you, you got out.

818
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:15,208
Dreykov made sure no one could escape.

819
01:17:16,042 --> 01:17:18,086
Are you gonna say anything?

820
01:17:21,631 --> 01:17:22,632
No.

821
01:17:24,092 --> 01:17:25,093
Don't touch me.

822
01:17:28,429 --> 01:17:29,430
Yelena.

823
01:17:29,806 --> 01:17:30,815
No.

824
01:17:34,852 --> 01:17:37,355
- I had no idea.
- It's okay, it's okay.

825
01:17:37,522 --> 01:17:39,399
I'll go talk to her.

826
01:17:55,456 --> 01:17:57,959
I came in here
because I didn't want to talk.

827
01:17:59,669 --> 01:18:00,795
Okay.

828
01:18:01,838 --> 01:18:03,965
We... we just sit.

829
01:18:08,803 --> 01:18:10,305
We just sit.

830
01:18:19,856 --> 01:18:21,024
Where are you going?

831
01:18:21,190 --> 01:18:23,626
- To do this myself.
- Don't. You won't survive.

832
01:18:23,693 --> 01:18:26,029
I wish I could believe that you cared.

833
01:18:26,863 --> 01:18:29,032
But you're not even the first mother
that abandoned me.

834
01:18:29,199 --> 01:18:31,326
No, you weren't abandoned.

835
01:18:31,492 --> 01:18:33,453
You were selected by a program

836
01:18:33,536 --> 01:18:35,538
that assessed
the genetic potential in infants.

837
01:18:45,673 --> 01:18:47,175
I was taken?

838
01:18:47,634 --> 01:18:51,095
I believe a bargain was struck,
your family paid off.

839
01:18:51,721 --> 01:18:54,140
But your mother,
she never stopped looking for you.

840
01:18:54,307 --> 01:18:57,227
She was like you in that way.
She was...

841
01:18:57,393 --> 01:18:58,937
relentless.

842
01:18:59,687 --> 01:19:01,314
What happened to her?

843
01:19:03,024 --> 01:19:04,776
Dreykov had her killed.

844
01:19:06,069 --> 01:19:08,905
Her existence threatened
to uncover the Red Room.

845
01:19:09,948 --> 01:19:12,367
Normally, the actions
of one curious civilian

846
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:13,535
wouldn't warrant an execution,

847
01:19:13,701 --> 01:19:16,412
but, as I said, she was relentless.

848
01:19:19,165 --> 01:19:22,001
I thought about her every day of my life.

849
01:19:26,589 --> 01:19:29,425
Whether or not I admitted
it to myself, I did.

850
01:19:31,886 --> 01:19:34,264
I've always found it best
not to look into the past.

851
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:46,901
Then why did you save this?

852
01:20:04,836 --> 01:20:06,754
I remember this day.

853
01:20:06,921 --> 01:20:10,884
We shot Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter
and summer vacation all in one day.

854
01:20:11,509 --> 01:20:13,511
Different backdrops.

855
01:20:14,971 --> 01:20:19,517
I knew all the presents under the tree
were just empty boxes, but I didn't care.

856
01:20:19,684 --> 01:20:21,352
I wanted to open every single one...

857
01:20:24,772 --> 01:20:27,567
so just for a second it would feel real.

858
01:20:28,151 --> 01:20:29,527
Let's stop this.

859
01:20:37,076 --> 01:20:38,578
Why you doing this?

860
01:20:39,787 --> 01:20:43,366
Why does a mouse born in a cage
run on that little wheel?

861
01:20:43,833 --> 01:20:46,461
Do you know I was cycled
through the Red Room

862
01:20:46,544 --> 01:20:49,130
four times before you were even born?

863
01:20:49,297 --> 01:20:50,715
Those walls are all I know.

864
01:20:51,466 --> 01:20:53,718
I was never given a choice.

865
01:20:54,135 --> 01:20:56,429
But you're not a mouse, Melina.

866
01:20:58,932 --> 01:21:02,060
You were just born in a cage,
but that's not your fault.

867
01:21:06,105 --> 01:21:08,983
Tell me, how did you keep your heart?

868
01:21:14,948 --> 01:21:17,117
Pain only makes us stronger.

869
01:21:18,118 --> 01:21:20,037
Didn't you tell us that?

870
01:21:22,039 --> 01:21:24,458
What you taught me kept me alive.

871
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:30,172
I'm sorry, I already alerted the Red Room.

872
01:21:30,339 --> 01:21:32,299
They'll be here any minute.

873
01:21:35,427 --> 01:21:39,765
So, there I am
ice fishing with my father.

874
01:21:40,766 --> 01:21:42,977
It's very cold day
in this little ice shed.

875
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:44,436
Cold even for Russia, you know?

876
01:21:44,603 --> 01:21:47,356
"Keep the vodka by the fire,"
my father would say to me.

877
01:21:47,523 --> 01:21:48,649
Please stop talking.

878
01:21:48,732 --> 01:21:49,775
- Please wait. Please wait.
- Please, no.

879
01:21:49,858 --> 01:21:50,859
Please, I don't want to talk.

880
01:21:50,943 --> 01:21:52,486
Please. Please.

881
01:21:53,112 --> 01:21:55,823
There is a reason why
I'm telling you this, okay? Trust me.

882
01:21:56,198 --> 01:21:58,492
I am reaching for fish.

883
01:22:00,394 --> 01:22:02,255
I lose balance!

884
01:22:03,038 --> 01:22:04,039
Splash!

885
01:22:04,123 --> 01:22:06,041
My hands go in the river.

886
01:22:06,125 --> 01:22:10,212
In this weather,
frostbite sets in quick.

887
01:22:10,671 --> 01:22:14,383
My father, he go toilet on my hands.

888
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:15,676
My God.

889
01:22:15,843 --> 01:22:20,639
Urine is 35 degrees Celsius,
staves off the frostbite.

890
01:22:20,806 --> 01:22:22,308
How is this relevant?

891
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,393
You know,

892
01:22:24,894 --> 01:22:26,186
fathers.

893
01:22:28,731 --> 01:22:31,317
No. No.

894
01:22:31,984 --> 01:22:35,487
You have done nothing
but tell me how bored you were.

895
01:22:35,863 --> 01:22:39,867
I was the chore,
the job you didn't want to do.

896
01:22:40,242 --> 01:22:41,535
To me?

897
01:22:42,578 --> 01:22:44,788
To me, you were everything.

898
01:22:47,458 --> 01:22:50,836
Exactly. You don't care.
You don't care.

899
01:22:51,337 --> 01:22:53,756
The only thing you care about
are your stupid glory days

900
01:22:53,923 --> 01:22:57,176
as the Crimson Dynamo,
and no one wants to hear about it.

901
01:23:03,807 --> 01:23:05,684
It's the Red Guardian.

902
01:23:05,851 --> 01:23:06,936
Get out.

903
01:23:07,311 --> 01:23:08,896
Get out!

904
01:23:18,405 --> 01:23:20,508
I can't remember...

905
01:23:23,994 --> 01:23:25,913
<i>If I cried</i>

906
01:23:28,123 --> 01:23:31,710
<i>When I read about his widowed bride</i>

907
01:23:32,711 --> 01:23:36,966
<i>Something touched me deep inside</i>

908
01:23:37,132 --> 01:23:38,300
<i>The day</i>

909
01:23:39,718 --> 01:23:42,263
<i>The music</i>

910
01:23:42,972 --> 01:23:44,515
<i>Died</i>

911
01:23:45,182 --> 01:23:47,726
<i>And they were singing</i>

912
01:23:48,811 --> 01:23:50,938
<i>- Bye
- Bye</i>

913
01:23:51,105 --> 01:23:53,691
<i>- Miss American Pie
- American Pie</i>

914
01:23:53,857 --> 01:23:56,777
<i>Drove my Chevy to the levee</i>

915
01:23:56,944 --> 01:23:59,572
<i>- But the levee was dry
- Was dry</i>

916
01:24:00,489 --> 01:24:02,491
<i>Them good old boys</i>

917
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:04,994
<i>Drinking whiskey</i>

918
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:07,913
<i>Singing</i>

919
01:24:08,372 --> 01:24:12,293
<i>"This will be the day that I die"</i>

920
01:24:13,752 --> 01:24:15,504
<i>"This'll be the day..."</i>

921
01:24:35,399 --> 01:24:36,400
Get down.

922
01:24:44,282 --> 01:24:45,242
They think...

923
01:25:45,011 --> 01:25:46,471
I'm sorry.

924
01:26:02,529 --> 01:26:04,573
Let's not keep him waiting.

925
01:26:30,932 --> 01:26:33,101
<i>Request clearance for landing.</i>

926
01:26:35,645 --> 01:26:36,688
Melina?

927
01:26:41,568 --> 01:26:43,361
We're touching down in one minute.

928
01:26:43,528 --> 01:26:46,156
Then why are we still going up?

929
01:26:48,408 --> 01:26:51,828
Now you'll know how Dreykov stayed
above the radar all these years.

930
01:28:11,491 --> 01:28:12,742
My God.

931
01:28:12,909 --> 01:28:14,452
Look at you.

932
01:28:17,414 --> 01:28:18,415
So,

933
01:28:18,999 --> 01:28:20,625
how was the family reunion?

934
01:28:20,792 --> 01:28:22,669
It was... awful.

935
01:28:22,836 --> 01:28:23,920
They were clingy,

936
01:28:24,004 --> 01:28:26,131
and too emotional, and needy.

937
01:28:26,298 --> 01:28:28,675
Just like old times?

938
01:28:28,758 --> 01:28:30,260
Yelena Belova.

939
01:28:30,427 --> 01:28:32,137
What's the deal with her?

940
01:28:32,304 --> 01:28:34,556
She was the only one affected, right?

941
01:28:34,723 --> 01:28:36,266
As far as I know, yes.

942
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:39,394
These gasses and antidotes,

943
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:42,647
it's a pain in my ass.

944
01:28:43,857 --> 01:28:46,192
It's a problem. You need to sort it.

945
01:28:46,276 --> 01:28:47,611
I have nine pigs,

946
01:28:47,694 --> 01:28:49,095
that will require attending

947
01:28:49,162 --> 01:28:51,873
- ...to in my absence.
- Don't give a shit about your pigs.

948
01:28:58,288 --> 01:28:59,539
Cut her brain out...

949
01:29:00,457 --> 01:29:03,043
Identify the weakness.

950
01:29:12,594 --> 01:29:15,138
This is a much less cool way to die.

951
01:29:24,105 --> 01:29:25,523
Alexei.

952
01:29:34,491 --> 01:29:36,035
What about Romanoff?

953
01:29:36,202 --> 01:29:37,495
She's a traitor.

954
01:29:38,371 --> 01:29:42,358
She turned her back on her people.
On her blood.

955
01:29:43,459 --> 01:29:45,078
She had nothing.

956
01:29:45,545 --> 01:29:49,340
I gave her home.
I gave her love.

957
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:52,134
Put that thing in her you do.

958
01:29:52,301 --> 01:29:54,387
You know, chemicals.

959
01:29:55,429 --> 01:29:58,358
Turn her into one of your pigs.

960
01:29:59,141 --> 01:30:03,688
Can you imagine what I could do
with an Avenger under my control?

961
01:30:03,854 --> 01:30:06,315
Wouldn't you like to speak to her first?

962
01:30:06,482 --> 01:30:09,902
When you look into the eyes
of a child you have raised,

963
01:30:10,403 --> 01:30:13,447
no mask in the world can hide that.

964
01:30:27,336 --> 01:30:28,504
Welcome home.

965
01:30:30,506 --> 01:30:32,174
Now, now.

966
01:30:33,467 --> 01:30:35,636
Don't go breaking my new toy.

967
01:30:37,513 --> 01:30:38,806
Natasha.

968
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:42,677
I can't save us.

969
01:30:43,895 --> 01:30:45,771
<i>I need you to know that I'm sorry.</i>

970
01:30:45,938 --> 01:30:47,815
<i>I pledged my life to a cause.</i>

971
01:30:47,982 --> 01:30:50,318
You know, I thought
I was being very brave.

972
01:30:50,484 --> 01:30:51,611
Possibly the bravest.

973
01:30:51,777 --> 01:30:53,880
But I wasn't being brave.

974
01:30:54,447 --> 01:30:55,990
I was coward.

975
01:31:01,871 --> 01:31:03,247
In Cuba,

976
01:31:04,790 --> 01:31:07,084
when they came
and took you away from me...

977
01:31:08,419 --> 01:31:10,963
No cause is worth that.

978
01:31:13,424 --> 01:31:15,885
You should only sacrifice yourself

979
01:31:16,761 --> 01:31:18,304
for something...

980
01:31:26,145 --> 01:31:27,622
How did you do that?

981
01:31:28,814 --> 01:31:30,667
I designed these cells myself.

982
01:31:34,437 --> 01:31:35,546
What?

983
01:31:37,281 --> 01:31:38,282
What?

984
01:31:38,783 --> 01:31:42,161
I bared my soul to you
and it was just you the whole time?

985
01:31:42,328 --> 01:31:45,915
Yes, I'm afraid so.
But wait, I'm on comms with Yelena.

986
01:31:46,499 --> 01:31:49,085
Yelena, it's me. It's Mama.

987
01:31:49,252 --> 01:31:52,413
<i>You have a two-inch blade
concealed in your beltline.</i>

988
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:53,381
What?

989
01:31:56,551 --> 01:31:58,553
What are you going to do to me?

990
01:31:59,887 --> 01:32:01,088
<i>Outside right hip.</i>

991
01:32:28,583 --> 01:32:30,251
You couldn't have told me sooner?

992
01:32:30,334 --> 01:32:31,519
<i>Don't throw a fit.</i>

993
01:32:31,586 --> 01:32:32,879
- There wasn't time.
- Okay, girls,

994
01:32:32,962 --> 01:32:34,213
I'm having trouble hearing you,

995
01:32:34,297 --> 01:32:37,174
but, Natasha,
there's something I need you to know.

996
01:32:37,592 --> 01:32:42,013
I need you to know that I'm sorry.
No more excuses, okay?

997
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:45,600
I gave my life for a cause.
I thought I was being brave.

998
01:32:45,766 --> 01:32:47,810
You don't have earpiece.

999
01:32:48,519 --> 01:32:49,520
What?

1000
01:32:49,687 --> 01:32:50,813
No, she can't hear you.

1001
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:52,398
- You don't have earpiece.
- Why not?

1002
01:32:52,565 --> 01:32:53,858
Because it wasn't part of the plan.

1003
01:32:54,025 --> 01:32:55,568
Yeah?
Well, what was the plan?

1004
01:32:56,277 --> 01:32:57,361
So, once we're inside,

1005
01:32:57,445 --> 01:32:59,030
I'll activate my tracker
and Ross will come running.

1006
01:32:59,530 --> 01:33:02,700
You are aware that
you are still a global fugitive, yes?

1007
01:33:03,284 --> 01:33:05,661
You know the facility.
There must be some way to land it.

1008
01:33:06,829 --> 01:33:10,124
Instruct them to confine us on level zero.

1009
01:33:10,291 --> 01:33:12,960
Once I'm out,
I can activate the landing protocol,

1010
01:33:13,127 --> 01:33:14,545
we can descend within the hour.

1011
01:33:14,629 --> 01:33:16,297
Problem.

1012
01:33:16,464 --> 01:33:19,050
I only have one earpiece set.

1013
01:33:19,842 --> 01:33:20,968
I'll give it to Yelena.

1014
01:33:21,636 --> 01:33:22,720
Where did he take the vials?

1015
01:33:22,887 --> 01:33:24,805
<i>Probably down to cold storage.</i>

1016
01:33:24,972 --> 01:33:27,308
Dreykov still has the widows
under his control, so

1017
01:33:27,475 --> 01:33:30,061
<i>you have to expose them
to this antidote.</i>

1018
01:33:30,478 --> 01:33:33,239
Yeah. Sure. Easy.

1019
01:33:34,857 --> 01:33:35,942
Is this your plan?

1020
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:37,735
My plan is to kill you.

1021
01:33:37,902 --> 01:33:39,320
I'm alive.

1022
01:33:40,404 --> 01:33:42,156
So, what do we do now?

1023
01:33:43,449 --> 01:33:45,536
What was my mother's name?

1024
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:53,377
Where we buried her,

1025
01:33:54,002 --> 01:33:55,879
there was a tree...

1026
01:33:58,340 --> 01:33:59,883
A pink blossom.

1027
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:01,760
Beautiful.

1028
01:34:01,927 --> 01:34:03,679
And there was a tombstone

1029
01:34:03,845 --> 01:34:06,473
with her name engraved on it.

1030
01:34:07,266 --> 01:34:08,767
What was her name?

1031
01:34:12,688 --> 01:34:15,866
"Unknown."

1032
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:20,004
You don't feel anything?

1033
01:34:21,655 --> 01:34:23,949
You feel anything
when I killed your daughter?

1034
01:34:24,116 --> 01:34:27,369
Is this your... haunted past?

1035
01:34:29,454 --> 01:34:30,956
Really?

1036
01:34:41,008 --> 01:34:43,077
Thank you, Natasha.

1037
01:34:47,931 --> 01:34:50,517
You gave me my greatest weapon.

1038
01:34:54,271 --> 01:34:55,355
Say hello.

1039
01:35:10,579 --> 01:35:13,040
When your bomb exploded,

1040
01:35:13,207 --> 01:35:15,751
it nearly killed my Antonia.

1041
01:35:19,504 --> 01:35:23,342
I had to put a chip
in the back of her neck.

1042
01:35:23,508 --> 01:35:25,844
In the back of her neck.

1043
01:35:26,261 --> 01:35:27,622
Look at her.

1044
01:35:28,722 --> 01:35:30,933
You find it difficult to look at her?

1045
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:33,185
I do.

1046
01:35:34,061 --> 01:35:36,688
She... She watches everything

1047
01:35:37,564 --> 01:35:38,774
and she can do it.

1048
01:35:39,316 --> 01:35:41,360
She's a perfect mimic.

1049
01:35:43,445 --> 01:35:46,281
And she fights
just like all of your friends.

1050
01:35:50,953 --> 01:35:52,538
Can she hear me?

1051
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:57,025
What?

1052
01:35:59,211 --> 01:36:01,338
You want to make her feel better?

1053
01:36:03,298 --> 01:36:05,968
You want to tell her you're sorry?

1054
01:36:07,302 --> 01:36:11,181
Well, you should have thought of that
before you blew her face off.

1055
01:36:13,183 --> 01:36:15,727
But enough of all this bullshit.

1056
01:36:17,062 --> 01:36:18,188
Go to work.

1057
01:36:18,355 --> 01:36:20,399
I have rats in the basement. Go.

1058
01:36:22,943 --> 01:36:24,194
Go.

1059
01:36:35,789 --> 01:36:37,374
Well, that was a mistake.

1060
01:36:38,041 --> 01:36:39,126
Was it?

1061
01:36:39,626 --> 01:36:42,671
You just sent away the one thing
that would stop me from killing you.

1062
01:36:44,423 --> 01:36:45,424
Try, then.

1063
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:46,800
Do it.

1064
01:36:51,597 --> 01:36:53,098
Is the safety on?

1065
01:36:58,186 --> 01:36:59,187
No.

1066
01:37:03,025 --> 01:37:04,860
Try your knife.

1067
01:37:13,827 --> 01:37:14,912
You're in trouble.

1068
01:37:15,078 --> 01:37:16,413
How are you controlling me?

1069
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:18,624
I'm not controlling you, Natasha.

1070
01:37:19,291 --> 01:37:20,667
Well, not yet.

1071
01:37:21,293 --> 01:37:23,462
But there is a pheromonal lock.

1072
01:37:23,795 --> 01:37:28,217
Smelling my pheromones prevents you
from committing violence against me.

1073
01:37:32,763 --> 01:37:35,432
I'm very upset with Melina.

1074
01:37:35,599 --> 01:37:37,476
It's a shame I have to kill her.

1075
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:39,811
Come on, now.
If we're just going to

1076
01:37:39,895 --> 01:37:41,730
press buttons and hack computers...

1077
01:37:41,897 --> 01:37:42,898
- Yes.
- I mean, I don't know.

1078
01:37:42,981 --> 01:37:43,982
There's nothing for me to do.

1079
01:37:44,107 --> 01:37:46,902
I want to...
I want to break something.

1080
01:37:46,985 --> 01:37:47,986
You do?

1081
01:37:49,738 --> 01:37:52,366
There is something you can break.

1082
01:38:06,256 --> 01:38:09,968
Melina, if this is
the last time that we...

1083
01:38:12,053 --> 01:38:13,805
Damn it.

1084
01:38:27,051 --> 01:38:28,611
That was disgusting.

1085
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,167
Okay.

1086
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:07,692
So, this was the big plan?

1087
01:39:08,026 --> 01:39:12,906
Melina was going to land the Red Room
and hand me over to the authorities.

1088
01:39:16,284 --> 01:39:17,744
No, no, no.

1089
01:39:22,498 --> 01:39:26,286
So, what now, you're gonna fold me into
your pathetic little puppeteer act?

1090
01:39:26,753 --> 01:39:27,754
Pathetic?

1091
01:39:27,921 --> 01:39:29,589
Yeah, what would you call it?

1092
01:39:29,756 --> 01:39:30,924
- I would call it...
- When was the last time

1093
01:39:31,007 --> 01:39:32,383
that you had a conversation with somebody

1094
01:39:32,467 --> 01:39:34,302
that wasn't forced to talk to you?

1095
01:39:34,469 --> 01:39:37,430
You ran away to fight in the wrong war.

1096
01:39:37,847 --> 01:39:41,351
The real war was fought here,
in the shadows.

1097
01:39:41,517 --> 01:39:43,102
You didn't fight in the shadows.

1098
01:39:43,269 --> 01:39:44,479
You hid in the dark.

1099
01:39:44,646 --> 01:39:48,441
Real power comes
from undetectable influence.

1100
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:51,027
If no one's noticed,
then why even do it?

1101
01:39:51,361 --> 01:39:52,528
You're nothing.

1102
01:39:52,612 --> 01:39:54,522
You have nothing.

1103
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:56,908
There are 50 people on this planet...

1104
01:39:57,375 --> 01:39:58,326
Stop it.

1105
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:01,120
Don't tell me to stop!

1106
01:40:01,287 --> 01:40:04,207
If I don't tell you when to stop,
then how will you know when to shut up?

1107
01:40:08,169 --> 01:40:09,295
Come on.

1108
01:40:09,462 --> 01:40:11,297
Think I can't take a punch?

1109
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:17,470
- God damn it, you're weak.
- Weak?

1110
01:40:17,637 --> 01:40:19,806
I bet it's easier to be tough
in front of defenseless little girls?

1111
01:40:19,973 --> 01:40:21,599
That's enough.

1112
01:40:31,693 --> 01:40:33,319
You wouldn't be so glib

1113
01:40:33,486 --> 01:40:37,156
if you had any notion
of the scope of what I've built.

1114
01:40:38,783 --> 01:40:41,369
I own this world. Me.

1115
01:40:41,536 --> 01:40:43,288
You seem desperate to impress me.

1116
01:40:43,454 --> 01:40:44,789
I don't need to impress you.

1117
01:40:44,956 --> 01:40:47,458
I don't need to impress anyone.

1118
01:40:48,668 --> 01:40:51,838
These world leaders, these great men,

1119
01:40:52,672 --> 01:40:55,508
they answer to me and my widows.

1120
01:40:59,262 --> 01:41:00,346
Look at them.

1121
01:41:03,141 --> 01:41:04,851
These girls were trash.

1122
01:41:05,977 --> 01:41:08,062
They are thrown out into the street.

1123
01:41:08,521 --> 01:41:10,616
I recycle the trash.

1124
01:41:11,983 --> 01:41:13,860
And I give them purpose.

1125
01:41:15,695 --> 01:41:17,488
I give them a life.

1126
01:41:24,704 --> 01:41:26,956
Melina, I found the location of the vials.

1127
01:41:28,333 --> 01:41:30,335
I've had a slight setback.

1128
01:41:32,420 --> 01:41:34,130
You'll need to get to the widows.

1129
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:55,235
<i>It's my network of widows</i>

1130
01:41:55,318 --> 01:41:58,046
<i>that help me control the scales of power.</i>

1131
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:02,567
One command,
the oil and stock markets crumble.

1132
01:42:03,034 --> 01:42:06,822
One command,
and a quarter of the planet will starve.

1133
01:42:07,289 --> 01:42:10,417
My widows can start and end wars.

1134
01:42:10,668 --> 01:42:13,379
They can make and break kings.

1135
01:42:17,383 --> 01:42:19,927
You control all of that from here?

1136
01:42:20,678 --> 01:42:22,555
And with you,

1137
01:42:23,222 --> 01:42:25,367
an Avenger under my control,

1138
01:42:27,643 --> 01:42:30,104
I can finally come out of the shadows

1139
01:42:31,230 --> 01:42:35,985
using the only natural resource
that the world has too much of.

1140
01:42:37,570 --> 01:42:38,946
Girls.

1141
01:42:49,248 --> 01:42:51,625
All from that little console?

1142
01:42:52,476 --> 01:42:53,486
Yeah.

1143
01:42:57,923 --> 01:42:59,675
You find this amusing?

1144
01:42:59,967 --> 01:43:01,510
Why are you smiling?

1145
01:43:02,177 --> 01:43:04,221
Don't take it personal, but...

1146
01:43:06,515 --> 01:43:08,601
Thank you for your cooperation.

1147
01:43:09,059 --> 01:43:13,272
Even if you locate the database
and get him to show you the key,

1148
01:43:13,522 --> 01:43:15,983
you won't be able to take it from him.

1149
01:43:16,150 --> 01:43:19,528
For years, Dreykov has implemented
a pheromonal lock

1150
01:43:19,695 --> 01:43:21,530
in all widows, even me.

1151
01:43:22,197 --> 01:43:26,285
So, as long as we can smell him,
then we won't be able to hurt him.

1152
01:43:26,368 --> 01:43:28,078
Well, I'll just hold my breath.

1153
01:43:28,245 --> 01:43:29,705
Not enough.

1154
01:43:29,872 --> 01:43:31,582
This is basic science.

1155
01:43:31,749 --> 01:43:35,002
Natasha, to block receptors
in olfactory center,

1156
01:43:35,169 --> 01:43:37,213
you have to sever the nerve.

1157
01:43:39,048 --> 01:43:40,382
I can handle that.

1158
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:43,677
You weren't quite strong enough, so...

1159
01:43:44,553 --> 01:43:46,305
I'll have to finish it myself.

1160
01:43:46,388 --> 01:43:48,432
What are you going to do?

1161
01:43:50,392 --> 01:43:51,685
Sever the nerve.

1162
01:44:15,084 --> 01:44:16,502
Melina!

1163
01:44:27,846 --> 01:44:29,431
Precisely what I was thinking.

1164
01:44:42,111 --> 01:44:43,904
Yelena, slight change of plan.

1165
01:44:44,071 --> 01:44:47,366
I completely demolished one of the engines
and we are going into a controlled crash.

1166
01:44:50,411 --> 01:44:51,412
Fantastic.

1167
01:44:51,579 --> 01:44:52,880
I'm heading to the widows now.

1168
01:44:54,490 --> 01:44:55,583
No.

1169
01:45:33,203 --> 01:45:34,488
We have to go.

1170
01:45:40,127 --> 01:45:41,955
Not so talkative now, are you?

1171
01:45:44,423 --> 01:45:45,507
You took my childhood.

1172
01:45:47,134 --> 01:45:49,678
You took my choices and tried to break me.

1173
01:45:49,845 --> 01:45:51,889
But you're never gonna do that
to anybody ever again.

1174
01:46:03,317 --> 01:46:06,904
Nobody leaves
this room until she's dead.

1175
01:46:07,071 --> 01:46:09,240
Make her suffer.

1176
01:46:11,450 --> 01:46:12,868
I don't wanna hurt you.

1177
01:46:13,452 --> 01:46:14,870
You don't wanna hurt me.

1178
01:48:08,902 --> 01:48:09,911
Hey.

1179
01:48:10,487 --> 01:48:11,488
Are you okay?

1180
01:48:12,781 --> 01:48:13,907
That looks like it hurts.

1181
01:48:14,074 --> 01:48:16,284
Okay. I take out on three, ready?

1182
01:48:16,493 --> 01:48:18,453
- Stop!
- I'm sorry.

1183
01:48:24,042 --> 01:48:26,211
Get as far away
from here as possible.

1184
01:48:27,170 --> 01:48:28,755
You get to make your own choices now.

1185
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:41,017
We gotta get outta here.

1186
01:48:41,184 --> 01:48:42,569
We need to find Dreykov.
Are you coming?

1187
01:48:42,652 --> 01:48:43,662
I'm right behind you.

1188
01:48:50,277 --> 01:48:53,272
Wait, wait! I have to go back!

1189
01:49:33,862 --> 01:49:34,663
Yes!

1190
01:50:32,129 --> 01:50:33,548
Do you see the girls?

1191
01:50:36,425 --> 01:50:37,426
No!

1192
01:51:10,293 --> 01:51:11,878
We need to go back.

1193
01:51:39,196 --> 01:51:40,823
We've lost control.

1194
01:52:04,931 --> 01:52:06,349
Antonia.

1195
01:52:09,227 --> 01:52:10,354
No!

1196
01:52:12,647 --> 01:52:14,357
I'm gonna open the door.

1197
01:52:15,149 --> 01:52:16,984
You're gonna come after me.

1198
01:52:17,151 --> 01:52:19,362
It's okay. It's okay.

1199
01:52:21,489 --> 01:52:23,658
I know you're still in there.

1200
01:52:25,576 --> 01:52:28,496
And I'm not gonna leave you.
Okay.

1201
01:53:42,904 --> 01:53:43,905
Yelena!

1202
01:53:45,448 --> 01:53:46,949
She's on the wing!

1203
01:53:47,116 --> 01:53:49,493
Move! What are you waiting for?

1204
01:53:51,037 --> 01:53:52,038
Don't do it!

1205
01:53:52,997 --> 01:53:54,665
This was fun!

1206
01:53:54,832 --> 01:53:55,875
No!

1207
01:55:44,026 --> 01:55:45,360
Okay.

1208
01:55:46,570 --> 01:55:48,071
Let's go.

1209
01:56:02,878 --> 01:56:04,129
Enough.

1210
01:56:55,514 --> 01:56:56,932
I'm sorry.

1211
01:56:57,099 --> 01:56:58,517
I'm sorry.

1212
01:57:01,728 --> 01:57:03,313
Is he gone?

1213
01:57:07,734 --> 01:57:09,111
He's gone.

1214
01:57:26,753 --> 01:57:28,130
Yelena!

1215
01:57:38,974 --> 01:57:40,267
Yelena?

1216
01:57:46,982 --> 01:57:49,192
We're both upside down.

1217
01:58:04,208 --> 01:58:05,500
I should've come back for you.

1218
01:58:05,667 --> 01:58:06,835
You don't have to say that.

1219
01:58:06,919 --> 01:58:08,212
- It's okay.
- Hey. Hey.

1220
01:58:08,754 --> 01:58:10,339
It was real to me, too.

1221
01:58:24,603 --> 01:58:25,604
Thank you.

1222
01:58:40,702 --> 01:58:41,828
Everybody good?

1223
01:58:41,995 --> 01:58:44,414
I am clearly injured.

1224
01:58:45,833 --> 01:58:47,752
You got something to say?

1225
01:58:48,711 --> 01:58:50,129
I'd just mess it up.

1226
01:59:04,477 --> 01:59:06,396
Here comes the cavalry.

1227
01:59:09,399 --> 01:59:11,318
<i>We're closing in on the target, sir.</i>

1228
01:59:14,529 --> 01:59:16,189
So, what's our plan?

1229
01:59:17,407 --> 01:59:19,993
You guys go. I'll stay.

1230
01:59:20,159 --> 01:59:22,120
That's insanity. We fight.
We fight with you.

1231
01:59:22,203 --> 01:59:24,080
- I'll hold them off.
- Natasha, we fight.

1232
01:59:24,163 --> 01:59:25,707
We can't split up.
You're so pigheaded.

1233
01:59:25,873 --> 01:59:28,042
- You guys, go.
- My God.

1234
01:59:28,209 --> 01:59:30,962
Besides, if it can work out
with the four of us, you know,

1235
01:59:31,129 --> 01:59:33,548
there may be some hope for the Avengers.

1236
01:59:33,715 --> 01:59:35,008
Little bit.

1237
01:59:35,174 --> 01:59:39,095
Okay, well, if you're leaving,
then I guess you should take this.

1238
01:59:39,262 --> 01:59:41,806
I know how much you like it.

1239
01:59:41,973 --> 01:59:43,766
Shucks.

1240
01:59:43,850 --> 01:59:45,101
It does have a lot of pockets.

1241
01:59:45,268 --> 01:59:47,270
Very handy pockets, yeah.

1242
01:59:48,396 --> 01:59:50,565
He had widows implanted
all over the world.

1243
01:59:50,732 --> 01:59:52,609
Melina will need to copy the formula,

1244
01:59:53,151 --> 01:59:54,944
but you should be the one
to tell 'em it's over.

1245
02:00:14,797 --> 02:00:16,316
You came back for us.

1246
02:00:25,391 --> 02:00:26,651
Thank you.

1247
02:00:31,898 --> 02:00:33,149
Hey.

1248
02:00:33,816 --> 02:00:36,611
Hey. You take care of yourself, okay?

1249
02:00:36,778 --> 02:00:37,904
Don't worry. I got this.

1250
02:00:38,071 --> 02:00:39,330
I know.

1251
02:00:49,916 --> 02:00:52,835
Don't worry.
We're bringing her with us.

1252
02:00:53,545 --> 02:00:55,838
Come. Come with us.

1253
02:02:30,516 --> 02:02:31,643
You ever not sleep?

1254
02:02:32,810 --> 02:02:36,189
I've been in six different time zones
in three days because of you.

1255
02:02:36,356 --> 02:02:37,649
- Really?
- Yeah.

1256
02:02:37,815 --> 02:02:40,276
What, are you scrapping
together some parts?

1257
02:02:40,443 --> 02:02:43,988
What'd you get me this time,
like, an upside-down lawnmower?

1258
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:51,454
You see what I can get you
with a bit of time and money?

1259
02:02:57,461 --> 02:02:59,088
Go on, say it.
I wanna hear it.

1260
02:02:59,255 --> 02:03:01,882
It would really be good for me
to hear it. Really.

1261
02:03:03,133 --> 02:03:04,301
I'm impressed.

1262
02:03:04,468 --> 02:03:06,136
Well, yeah.

1263
02:03:06,762 --> 02:03:09,190
You've always been
a really good friend to me.

1264
02:03:09,557 --> 02:03:12,059
That's what every man wants to hear.

1265
02:03:12,851 --> 02:03:14,019
Where you gonna go?

1266
02:03:15,354 --> 02:03:18,023
It's funny. My whole life,
I didn't think I had any family.

1267
02:03:18,190 --> 02:03:20,359
Turns out I got two, so...

1268
02:03:20,859 --> 02:03:22,152
One of them's a bit of a mess right now.

1269
02:03:22,319 --> 02:03:25,114
I'm gonna go break
a few of them out of prison

1270
02:03:25,614 --> 02:03:28,117
see if I can't help patch things up.

1271
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:16,496
Come on, Fanny.

1272
02:12:36,942 --> 02:12:37,944
Sorry.

1273
02:12:39,629 --> 02:12:41,464
I'm allergic to the Midwest.

1274
02:12:44,467 --> 02:12:47,303
What this woman did,

1275
02:12:47,470 --> 02:12:50,306
honestly, I can't even imagine.

1276
02:12:50,806 --> 02:12:54,560
You're not supposed to be bothering me
on my holiday time, Valentina.

1277
02:12:54,727 --> 02:12:56,229
Bothering you? No, no.

1278
02:12:56,312 --> 02:12:58,856
I'm just here paying my respects.

1279
02:13:00,441 --> 02:13:02,735
You know, coming here
makes you look desperate.

1280
02:13:06,072 --> 02:13:07,114
Okay.

1281
02:13:07,281 --> 02:13:08,366
I want a raise.

1282
02:13:08,532 --> 02:13:09,867
Yeah. You and me both.

1283
02:13:10,034 --> 02:13:12,495
Believe me, you're gonna earn it.

1284
02:13:13,663 --> 02:13:15,957
I've got your next target.

1285
02:13:16,123 --> 02:13:17,875
Thought I'd hand-deliver it.

1286
02:13:20,127 --> 02:13:24,924
Maybe you'd like a shot at the man
responsible for your sister's death.

1287
02:13:27,677 --> 02:13:29,637
Kind of a cutie, don't you think?
