1
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,775
This is not how I wanted this evening
to go.

2
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,652
I know how you wanted this evening
to go.

3
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,862
Believe me

4
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:19,988
this is better.

5
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,866
Who are you working for?

6
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,826
Lermentov, yes?

7
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,455
Does he think

8
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,331
we have to go through him

9
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,333
to move our cargo?

10
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:38,381
I thought General Solohob
is in charge of the export business.

11
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,759
Solohob

12
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,011
a bagman, a front.

13
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:49,642
Your outdated information betrays you.

14
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,813
The famous Black Widow

15
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,819
and she turns out to be
simply another pretty face.

16
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,865
You really think I'm pretty?

17
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,828
Tell Lermentov we don't need him

18
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,707
to move the tanks.

19
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,294
Tell him he is out.

20
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,338
Well...

21
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,394
It's for her.

22
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,191
You listen carefully

23
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,687
Who are you?

24
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,314
Get out!

25
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,983
There is sickness here!

26
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,071
My father's not waking up!

27
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,781
He has a fever and he's moaning

28
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,032
but his eyes won't open.

29
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,116
Slow down.

30
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,661
My father...

31
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,331
Like them?
