1
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,959
Come on, Drax. Dance.

2
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:40,586
Only idiots dance.

3
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,805
<i>I'm a weirdo</i>

4
00:03:12,117 --> 00:03:14,495
<i>I want to have control</i>

5
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:22,169
<i>I want a perfect body</i>

6
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:55,411
Hey!

7
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,916
I told you a million times...

8
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:04,128
you keep your grimy raccoon hands
off my Zune.

9
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:10,217
I told you a million times,
I'm not a damn raccoon.

10
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:31,655
Again?

11
00:05:04,813 --> 00:05:06,940
I love you, Gamora.

12
00:05:51,026 --> 00:05:52,611
So, what are you gonna do about Quill?

13
00:05:52,778 --> 00:05:54,571
Me? Why not you?

14
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:57,825
I got emotionalistical issues.
What am I gonna do?

15
00:05:57,992 --> 00:05:59,159
Why are you on the ceiling?

16
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:02,204
I wanted to see if these new gravity
boots worked on a slope.

17
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,420
Here we go.

18
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,561
Sorry.

19
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,486
Bozhe moi, Kraglin.

20
00:06:34,653 --> 00:06:36,280
You must know you will never learn.

21
00:06:36,655 --> 00:06:37,990
You think you could do better?

22
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,680
Telekinesis is cheating!

23
00:07:01,847 --> 00:07:03,807
That's a stupid little pebble!

24
00:07:03,974 --> 00:07:05,893
I could do that with my dang finger!

25
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:07,728
You're a bad dog.

26
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,481
Do not say that to me.

27
00:07:10,648 --> 00:07:12,191
You are. You're a bad dog.

28
00:07:12,358 --> 00:07:13,734
Take that back.

29
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,152
Come on, that's not cool.

30
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,404
Nebula, did you hear?

31
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:20,532
He called me a bad dog,
and he refused to take it back.

32
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,242
I don't care, Cosmo.

33
00:07:22,618 --> 00:07:24,328
- Is Peter okay?
- I don't know.

34
00:07:24,495 --> 00:07:25,329
What are you going to do?

35
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:27,665
Me? He's your brother.

36
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:29,958
It doesn't matter,
he still doesn't listen to me.

37
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,836
Yeah, he has been pretty mopey
ever since Gamora died.

38
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:34,213
She's not dead.

39
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,965
She just doesn't remember anything
from the past few years.

40
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:38,342
Nobody tells me nothing.

41
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:41,720
Mantis, why don't you just touch him
and, you know, make him happy?

42
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:42,721
I am Groot?

43
00:07:42,805 --> 00:07:43,681
- Dude!
- Gross!

44
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:46,684
No, not like that.
Touch him with her powers.

45
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,269
It is wrong to manipulate
the feelings of friends.

46
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:51,563
'Bout that time you made me
fall in love with my sock?

47
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,107
Well, that was funny.

48
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,651
I guess it's back to one of us
touching him the other way.

49
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:56,944
Maybe we should draw straws.

50
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:58,946
No one ever meant that, Drax.

51
00:08:57,546 --> 00:08:58,464
- What was that?
- What was that?

52
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,631
What the hell?

53
00:08:59,798 --> 00:09:00,799
Oh, my God!

54
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:02,009
Is he okay?

55
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:12,102
Hey!

56
00:09:13,604 --> 00:09:14,938
Where did you go, squirrel?

57
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:23,947
On the ground!

58
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:46,345
No, stop! Don't!

59
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:49,932
Stop, please! No! Stop, please!

60
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:51,100
Please!

61
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:25,843
Who is that maniac?

62
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,847
Some super douche with ray gun hands,
I don't frickin' know.

63
00:11:07,593 --> 00:11:08,636
Who threw this thing at me?

64
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:10,346
Shut up.

65
00:11:12,014 --> 00:11:13,015
Baby.

66
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:30,658
Pick on someone your own size.

67
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:58,185
Peter!

68
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:00,479
Peter!

69
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:01,897
We need Med-Paks!

70
00:12:16,578 --> 00:12:17,579
Nebula!

71
00:12:17,746 --> 00:12:18,747
Piss off.

72
00:12:43,731 --> 00:12:44,815
Rocket.

73
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:06,211
That hurts.

74
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,297
What a pity.

75
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:26,273
No!

76
00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:31,695
All I did was activate the Med-Paks!

77
00:13:31,862 --> 00:13:33,447
Get them off! Now!

78
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:18,242
Oh, hell.

79
00:14:19,034 --> 00:14:20,077
We need to get him to the Med-Bay!

80
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:22,079
It was destroyed.
There's one on the ship.

81
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,087
Lill ol od for today.

82
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:35,009
Stitch him up and transfer him in
with the rest of Batch 89.

83
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,375
It's okay.

84
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,377
You're here with us now.

85
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,756
Hey! It's a new guy.

86
00:15:13,922 --> 00:15:15,591
What kind of thing are you?

87
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,427
You've got, like, a mask on your face.

88
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:24,308
Mask, eyes, face, mouth...

89
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:26,101
Does it words?

90
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:30,856
It's okay, friend.
Don't let them scare you.

91
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:37,905
Hurts.

92
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,514
It's okay.

93
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,060
You're gonna be okay.

94
00:16:11,313 --> 00:16:12,356
A kill switch?

95
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:16,485
A device set to destruct
if anyone goes poking around inside him...

96
00:16:16,652 --> 00:16:17,861
or even if we use the Med-Paks.

97
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:19,738
And why would Rocket have a kill switch?

98
00:16:19,905 --> 00:16:22,116
Apparently, someone considers him
proprietary technology...

99
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,576
and sent that golden lunatic to get him.

100
00:16:24,743 --> 00:16:26,245
So, he'll die if we operate on him?

101
00:16:26,412 --> 00:16:27,246
And he'll die if we don't.

102
00:16:27,413 --> 00:16:28,664
There has to be some way to bypass it.

103
00:16:28,831 --> 00:16:31,375
It looks like there's a passkey
that could override the kill switch.

104
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,794
What do we know
about where Rocket came from?

105
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:34,878
He won't talk about it.

106
00:16:35,045 --> 00:16:37,548
Much of the tech was developed
by a company called OrgoCorp.

107
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,758
And there's a code on all of it...

108
00:16:39,925 --> 00:16:42,511
89P13.

109
00:16:42,678 --> 00:16:44,555
He's got maybe 48 hours.

110
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:48,267
Where are you going?

111
00:16:48,434 --> 00:16:49,768
OrgoCorp have to have records, right?

112
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,980
Maybe they'll have a way for us to
override the kill switch and save Rocket.

113
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:54,523
They won't just give us that information.

114
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,025
Well, that's why we're gonna break in.

115
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:58,110
We kill anyone who gets in our way!

116
00:16:58,193 --> 00:16:59,862
- Not kill anyone.
- Kill a few people.

117
00:16:59,945 --> 00:17:00,904
Kill no people.

118
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:03,615
Kill one guy,
one stupid guy who no one loves.

119
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:05,492
Now you're just making it sad.

120
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:12,832
Kraglin, Cosmo,
I need you to keep watch...

121
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,667
over Knowhere till we're back.
Couple of days, tops.

122
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:16,253
- Aye, Cap'n.
- Aye, comrade.

123
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:20,049
Take back what you said,
that I'm a bad dog.

124
00:17:20,215 --> 00:17:21,090
Nope.

125
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:23,344
I know you don't really think
I am a bad dog.

126
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,511
Can you please take it back?

127
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:25,678
I will not.

128
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:29,642
I located the coordinates for OrgoCorp.

129
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:32,436
I think I have a contact near there.
Maybe they can help us get in.

130
00:17:32,603 --> 00:17:33,437
Contact him.

131
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,273
Let's go save our friend.

132
00:18:17,523 --> 00:18:18,691
No, no, no.

133
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:41,296
It's good to have friends.

134
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:51,223
Oh, my poor baby.

135
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,726
It hurts.

136
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:56,562
Do you have it?

137
00:18:56,729 --> 00:18:57,730
He does not, sire.

138
00:18:57,896 --> 00:19:00,691
I tried to warn you, High Evolutionary.

139
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:03,152
These Guardians are more powerful
than you think.

140
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:07,990
Or perhaps you simply overestimate
your own value, High Priestess.

141
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:11,702
No doubt a flaw of some type
in my own design.

142
00:19:11,869 --> 00:19:14,663
I created you lot as merely
an aesthetic experiment.

143
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,707
Beautiful numbskulls.

144
00:19:17,374 --> 00:19:19,918
But your egos have run wild.
Say, "ah"...

145
00:19:21,295 --> 00:19:23,964
And this one
was meant to be the Warlock...

146
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:25,632
the apogee of their people.

147
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,093
You removed Adam from his cocoon early...

148
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,345
My liege.

149
00:19:29,511 --> 00:19:30,929
He's still a child.

150
00:19:31,096 --> 00:19:33,766
No, there's something wrong with him
even outside all that.

151
00:19:33,932 --> 00:19:35,476
Yes, there's something wrong with me!

152
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:37,853
I was stabbed, you extraordinary phallus!

153
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,441
He doesn't know any better.
We shall do whatever you require, my liege.

154
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:46,028
You knew of 89P13's existence for years
without alerting me.

155
00:19:46,195 --> 00:19:48,113
That's not what I require!

156
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:53,118
I'm sorry, my liege.

157
00:19:53,285 --> 00:19:56,288
Find 89P13 and return it to me...

158
00:19:56,455 --> 00:20:01,460
or I will destroy your entire civilization,
as is my right as your maker.

159
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:03,420
Do you understand?

160
00:20:08,467 --> 00:20:10,594
Do you understand?

161
00:20:11,136 --> 00:20:13,055
Yes, sire.

162
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,641
Toodle-do.

163
00:20:18,227 --> 00:20:20,980
How did 89P13 survive
after all these years, Theel?

164
00:20:21,397 --> 00:20:22,898
It was always clever, sire.

165
00:20:23,065 --> 00:20:25,275
- Yes, that's exactly why I want it now.
- Of course.

166
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:28,112
- Its brain.
- That is the only reason, sire.

167
00:20:29,697 --> 00:20:32,449
But are you really trusting the Sovereign
to retrieve it?

168
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:36,161
They're merely a backup.
I believe I know where they're going.

169
00:21:10,112 --> 00:21:11,739
It's bio-formed.

170
00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:14,450
Instead of being built,
it's grown from living matter.

171
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:18,954
The structure is surrounded by three
impenetrable plasmic security shields.

172
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:21,457
It's not going to be easy
to break into this place, Star-Lord.

173
00:21:21,623 --> 00:21:24,501
Doesn't have to be easy.
I was a professional thief, remember?

174
00:21:24,668 --> 00:21:26,086
I'll jam the signals one at a time.

175
00:21:27,713 --> 00:21:30,007
She calls me Star-Lord
when she's mad at me.

176
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:31,342
She's always mad...

177
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:32,760
at everyone.

178
00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:36,055
It's because I was drunk.

179
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:39,350
She's right.

180
00:21:39,516 --> 00:21:40,601
If I hadn't been drinking...

181
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:43,687
maybe Rocket... I'm sorry.

182
00:21:43,854 --> 00:21:46,106
It's okay. He's your best friend.

183
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:47,608
Second best friend.

184
00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:52,488
Everyone around me dies.
My mother, Yondu, Gamora.

185
00:21:52,655 --> 00:21:53,656
Gamora isn't dead.

186
00:21:53,822 --> 00:21:55,866
She is to us.
You want a Zarg-Nut?

187
00:21:57,076 --> 00:21:58,077
Thank you.

188
00:22:02,581 --> 00:22:03,749
First shield set.

189
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,086
Three, two...

190
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:09,922
one.

191
00:22:15,636 --> 00:22:16,637
- Peter.
- What?

192
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:18,806
You had family on Earth...

193
00:22:18,973 --> 00:22:20,891
and you never wanted
to go back to see them?

194
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:24,645
No, you're my sister.
That's all the family I want or need.

195
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:28,315
Besides, it was really just my grandpa, okay?
He was a pretty hard guy.

196
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:30,317
Still. Don't you think he...

197
00:22:31,068 --> 00:22:32,069
What?

198
00:22:32,236 --> 00:22:35,781
You were abducted by Ravagers
the same day he lost his daughter.

199
00:22:35,948 --> 00:22:37,324
Oh, yeah, he was upset.

200
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:39,868
My mom died, he screamed in my face,
he pushed me out of the room!

201
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:42,287
He was probably
just trying to protect you.

202
00:22:42,454 --> 00:22:44,081
- What are you talking about?
- What?

203
00:22:44,248 --> 00:22:46,500
I'm talking about the people in my life
who died, and you're talking about this?

204
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:47,501
Second shield set.

205
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:49,211
Three, two...

206
00:22:49,378 --> 00:22:50,421
one.

207
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:56,468
I'm only saying...

208
00:22:56,635 --> 00:22:58,929
you've never even gone
to see if he's okay.

209
00:22:59,096 --> 00:23:00,472
He could still be alive.

210
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:04,310
My grandpa, he'd be like
90-something years old.

211
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:05,894
So he could still be alive.

212
00:23:06,061 --> 00:23:07,855
People on Earth die
when they're like 50.

213
00:23:08,022 --> 00:23:09,606
They die when they're 50?

214
00:23:09,773 --> 00:23:11,358
I don't know. Something like that.

215
00:23:11,525 --> 00:23:13,152
What's even the point of being born?

216
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,278
Exactly!

217
00:23:14,445 --> 00:23:16,071
Are you about to die?

218
00:23:17,906 --> 00:23:19,033
I'm not 50!

219
00:23:21,243 --> 00:23:22,244
The point is...

220
00:23:22,411 --> 00:23:24,580
I wasn't talking about any of this.

221
00:23:26,332 --> 00:23:27,541
Third shield set.

222
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:30,544
Three, two, one.

223
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,214
Well, not everything
is about what you are talking about.

224
00:23:34,381 --> 00:23:35,716
And I'm only saying...

225
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:39,470
you are upset because so many of the people
you cared about have left you...

226
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,597
but you also left someone.

227
00:23:42,473 --> 00:23:43,932
And maybe I wanted a Zarg-Nut!

228
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:46,018
It's too late. They're all gone.

229
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:00,199
Why didn't we go through?

230
00:24:03,661 --> 00:24:06,288
We did. It's not the shield.

231
00:24:10,334 --> 00:24:11,877
Oh, hell.

232
00:24:15,255 --> 00:24:16,340
Ravagers.

233
00:24:17,216 --> 00:24:18,217
Hey, guys...

234
00:24:18,384 --> 00:24:20,761
you're about to be boarded
by the United Ravagers.

235
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:23,722
You can surrender and turn over
any stuff worth anything and live...

236
00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:25,432
or you can die.

237
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:26,850
Totes up to you.

238
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,535
Drax, no, no, no, Drax!

239
00:24:44,702 --> 00:24:46,829
Guys, it's me, Peter Quill,
I'm one of you, remember?

240
00:24:46,996 --> 00:24:47,871
Hold on!

241
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:48,956
We have an appointment!

242
00:24:49,123 --> 00:24:49,957
We have an appointment.

243
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,874
With who?

244
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,002
- With Gamora.
- With Gamora.

245
00:24:53,168 --> 00:24:54,003
What?

246
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:55,504
You're early.

247
00:25:11,979 --> 00:25:12,980
What are these?

248
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,482
OrgoCorp uniforms.

249
00:25:16,442 --> 00:25:18,777
You're gonna have to wear these
to move through the Orgo...

250
00:25:18,944 --> 00:25:21,071
without attracting attention.

251
00:25:21,238 --> 00:25:22,489
This isn't my color.

252
00:25:25,326 --> 00:25:27,161
What did you say?

253
00:25:27,328 --> 00:25:29,038
It clashes with my eyes.

254
00:25:33,709 --> 00:25:34,793
Put it on!

255
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,090
Nebula, why would you not tell me
that you've been in contact with Gamora?

256
00:25:40,257 --> 00:25:41,675
Because I didn't want you
to get freaked out.

257
00:25:41,842 --> 00:25:42,843
Freaked out how?

258
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,136
Like that.

259
00:25:44,637 --> 00:25:45,638
Let me in there.

260
00:25:45,804 --> 00:25:47,431
I don't wanna be trapped out here,
I can't...

261
00:25:47,973 --> 00:25:49,892
Gamora, we are grateful for your help.

262
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:52,519
I'm not doing this
out of the kindness of my heart.

263
00:25:53,145 --> 00:25:56,398
I'm doing this for the hundred thousand
units my sister promised.

264
00:25:57,316 --> 00:25:59,026
So, you're a Ravager now?

265
00:25:59,526 --> 00:26:00,527
Put on the uniform.

266
00:26:00,694 --> 00:26:02,363
Never pictured you as the Ravager type.

267
00:26:03,781 --> 00:26:04,907
Who are you again?

268
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:06,533
Oh, man.

269
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,828
OrgoCorp is in possession
of some of the most advanced...

270
00:26:09,995 --> 00:26:12,790
cybergenetic IP in the galaxy...

271
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:17,920
so they're heavily guarded
by the deadly Orgosentries.

272
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:21,465
Now, I know you don't have
documentation to dock...

273
00:26:21,632 --> 00:26:23,926
so you're gonna have to
get in there on your own.

274
00:26:24,635 --> 00:26:28,681
Once in, Gamora is gonna
lead you to the records...

275
00:26:28,847 --> 00:26:31,058
where maybe you can find the passkey...

276
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:33,519
to override the kill switch...

277
00:26:33,686 --> 00:26:35,688
and help you save the hedgehog.

278
00:26:36,355 --> 00:26:38,023
But if you get into trouble...

279
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,568
we will not be able to bail you out.

280
00:26:58,794 --> 00:26:59,795
Yes.

281
00:27:00,754 --> 00:27:02,965
Yes, of course. Brilliant.

282
00:27:05,634 --> 00:27:07,594
His functioning has skyrocketed.

283
00:27:11,307 --> 00:27:12,850
That's correct, P13.

284
00:27:13,017 --> 00:27:14,351
Very good.

285
00:27:20,232 --> 00:27:21,984
That's the new world.

286
00:27:22,151 --> 00:27:23,527
Counter-Earth.

287
00:27:24,194 --> 00:27:26,530
Where the experiments will go
once they're ready.

288
00:27:26,697 --> 00:27:27,990
It blue.

289
00:27:28,157 --> 00:27:29,158
That's the sky.

290
00:27:29,325 --> 00:27:30,659
Sky.

291
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:34,872
Rocket.

292
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:36,540
Yes, it is.

293
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,043
What sounds?

294
00:27:40,669 --> 00:27:42,129
That's music.

295
00:27:42,421 --> 00:27:43,422
We like it?

296
00:27:43,922 --> 00:27:44,923
We do.

297
00:27:45,424 --> 00:27:49,053
This recording is over 5,000 years old.

298
00:27:50,262 --> 00:27:53,807
Mo Ergastee Förn,
Mo Ergalone Förn Nort.

299
00:27:54,516 --> 00:27:56,018
Which, translated, is...

300
00:27:56,727 --> 00:27:59,647
Be not as you are,
but as you should be.

301
00:28:00,105 --> 00:28:01,815
It's our sacred mission...

302
00:28:01,982 --> 00:28:04,818
to take the cacophony of sounds
around us...

303
00:28:05,653 --> 00:28:08,072
and turn it into a song.

304
00:28:10,115 --> 00:28:12,368
To take an imperfect clump...

305
00:28:12,534 --> 00:28:15,329
of biological matter such as you...

306
00:28:16,038 --> 00:28:18,415
and transform it into something...

307
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:20,084
perfect.

308
00:28:23,128 --> 00:28:25,547
And we're halfway there, aren't we?

309
00:28:29,301 --> 00:28:31,387
Come with me, P13.

310
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,514
I'd like to show you something.

311
00:28:37,935 --> 00:28:39,812
We have but a single quest...

312
00:28:40,229 --> 00:28:42,648
to create the perfect species...

313
00:28:42,815 --> 00:28:44,817
and the perfect society.

314
00:28:44,984 --> 00:28:47,486
You, P13...

315
00:28:47,778 --> 00:28:49,905
are part of Batch 89.

316
00:28:50,072 --> 00:28:52,449
But here with Batch 90...

317
00:28:53,033 --> 00:28:55,953
I've developed a process
by which I can guide...

318
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,580
any organism through millions of years...

319
00:28:58,747 --> 00:29:01,333
of programmed evolutionary changes...

320
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:03,377
in a moment.

321
00:29:34,325 --> 00:29:38,078
See, now, there's the rub.

322
00:29:39,288 --> 00:29:40,539
For some reason...

323
00:29:40,706 --> 00:29:43,876
these specimens are also over-producing...

324
00:29:44,043 --> 00:29:47,755
loligo beta-microseminoprotein
in their systems...

325
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:49,506
causing them to be, well...

326
00:29:49,673 --> 00:29:51,842
Violent. We don't like it.

327
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:55,763
A utopia can't have its denizens
murdering one another, can it?

328
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:57,056
It can'ts.

329
00:29:57,973 --> 00:29:58,974
Can't.

330
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:00,267
Can't.

331
00:30:00,643 --> 00:30:01,644
Theel.

332
00:30:05,856 --> 00:30:08,692
They're programmed to be peaceful.
Like you.

333
00:30:09,318 --> 00:30:12,237
But for some reason, it's not catching.

334
00:30:13,072 --> 00:30:14,948
Hyptonic filters.

335
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:16,116
What?

336
00:30:16,283 --> 00:30:20,204
They's suppressaliting
the glycosylated saltses.

337
00:30:20,788 --> 00:30:24,750
And then boop-boop-boop,
halfcystine residual be formin'...

338
00:30:24,917 --> 00:30:27,419
and then, they make...

339
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,921
What do you say?

340
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:31,131
Loligo beta-microseminoproteins.

341
00:30:31,757 --> 00:30:32,758
Yeah, thems.

342
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,594
And then, angry turtleses.

343
00:31:24,476 --> 00:31:27,229
There.
That's the decompression chamber.

344
00:31:27,896 --> 00:31:28,981
Lock in.

345
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:40,242
Go.

346
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,274
Activate gravity boots and gloves.

347
00:32:20,449 --> 00:32:22,076
Nebula, go.

348
00:32:57,569 --> 00:32:59,530
So, you really don't remember anything?

349
00:32:59,697 --> 00:33:00,698
Like what?

350
00:33:01,615 --> 00:33:02,616
'Bout your time with us.

351
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:04,743
No.

352
00:33:05,035 --> 00:33:06,036
We were...

353
00:33:06,203 --> 00:33:08,080
We weren't anything.

354
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:09,248
You and me...

355
00:33:09,415 --> 00:33:13,127
That person was
some alternate future version of me.

356
00:33:14,336 --> 00:33:15,504
It wasn't me.

357
00:33:17,006 --> 00:33:18,298
We loved each other.

358
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,760
I don't think so.

359
00:33:23,804 --> 00:33:25,222
I know you don't remember any of it.

360
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:29,852
You were everything to me.

361
00:33:32,646 --> 00:33:34,106
And I miss you...

362
00:33:35,733 --> 00:33:36,942
so much.

363
00:33:38,277 --> 00:33:39,361
And, maybe...

364
00:33:40,571 --> 00:33:42,823
maybe, if you open yourself up to it...

365
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,701
there's a possibility...

366
00:33:45,868 --> 00:33:47,453
I don't think so, Quinn.

367
00:33:48,579 --> 00:33:49,580
Quill.

368
00:33:49,747 --> 00:33:50,831
Quill.

369
00:33:52,624 --> 00:33:53,959
I don't think so.

370
00:33:54,126 --> 00:33:55,169
Well, what I'm trying to say...

371
00:33:55,336 --> 00:33:57,504
Peter, you know
this is an open line, right?

372
00:33:57,671 --> 00:33:58,714
What?

373
00:33:58,881 --> 00:34:00,341
We're listening
to everything you're saying.

374
00:34:00,507 --> 00:34:02,426
And it is painful.

375
00:34:02,593 --> 00:34:03,719
And you're just telling me now?

376
00:34:03,886 --> 00:34:05,387
We were hoping it would stop on its own.

377
00:34:05,554 --> 00:34:06,430
But I switched it over to private!

378
00:34:06,597 --> 00:34:07,890
What color button did you push?

379
00:34:08,057 --> 00:34:09,099
Blue, for the blue suit!

380
00:34:09,266 --> 00:34:10,184
Oh, no!

381
00:34:10,351 --> 00:34:11,977
Blue is the open line for everyone.

382
00:34:12,144 --> 00:34:13,812
- Orange is for blue.
- What?

383
00:34:13,979 --> 00:34:15,064
Black is for orange...

384
00:34:15,229 --> 00:34:18,984
yellow is for green, green is for red,
and red is for yellow.

385
00:34:19,151 --> 00:34:20,526
No. Yellow is for yellow...

386
00:34:20,693 --> 00:34:22,321
green is for red, red is for green.

387
00:34:22,488 --> 00:34:24,073
- I don't think so.
- Try it then.

388
00:34:25,824 --> 00:34:26,825
Hello!

389
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:29,952
You were right.

390
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,914
How the hell am I supposed to
know all of that?

391
00:34:32,081 --> 00:34:32,997
Seems intuitive.

392
00:34:33,832 --> 00:34:35,834
Can we get back to saving our friend?

393
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:39,296
Get that jammer
ready to change the shield.

394
00:35:13,497 --> 00:35:14,665
Guys?

395
00:35:14,832 --> 00:35:18,794
I mean, you wanna talk about a sweet ride?
The acceleration will crush your spine.

396
00:35:18,961 --> 00:35:21,338
It's got that brand-new fusalix core.
You know what I'm talking about?

397
00:35:21,505 --> 00:35:22,548
Yeah.

398
00:35:22,715 --> 00:35:24,008
Really?
'Cause I just made that up.

399
00:35:25,301 --> 00:35:26,552
I thought you said somethin' else.

400
00:35:27,469 --> 00:35:28,637
Master Karja.

401
00:35:30,347 --> 00:35:32,266
- No, you didn't.
- I did.

402
00:35:32,808 --> 00:35:34,977
Master Karja, there appears to be
a physical breach...

403
00:35:35,144 --> 00:35:36,228
in the white wing somewhere.

404
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:37,938
- Could it be a glitch?
- Maybe.

405
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,738
I'm accessing the eye.

406
00:35:45,904 --> 00:35:47,406
I'll see if I can locate it.

407
00:36:19,688 --> 00:36:22,149
There's some sort of anomaly
in the decompression chamber.

408
00:36:22,316 --> 00:36:23,984
- Best you check it out, Master.
- On it.

409
00:36:25,527 --> 00:36:26,528
Hurry.

410
00:36:38,499 --> 00:36:39,500
Where do we put these?

411
00:36:41,335 --> 00:36:44,046
Here! Hide them in this locker
until we leave.

412
00:36:51,136 --> 00:36:52,304
Hurry!

413
00:37:08,862 --> 00:37:10,698
What the hell was that, guys?

414
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:14,368
What, are you kidding me?

415
00:37:14,785 --> 00:37:15,619
What?

416
00:37:16,495 --> 00:37:19,123
A neutro-quark just hit the satellite.

417
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:21,083
It's burning a hole through the wall.
You geniuses...

418
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:25,045
you just throw the door open without
any proper precautionary procedure?

419
00:37:25,212 --> 00:37:26,630
What procedure, bro?

420
00:37:27,214 --> 00:37:30,134
You want us to read the manual
for you too, bro?

421
00:37:30,509 --> 00:37:32,344
You could have killed everyone in the wing!

422
00:37:32,511 --> 00:37:34,722
Exactly! You idiots!

423
00:37:35,139 --> 00:37:36,265
I'm angry too!

424
00:37:36,432 --> 00:37:37,391
Oh, no.

425
00:37:37,558 --> 00:37:38,642
I mean, can't you see...

426
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:41,854
these authentic mechanic uniforms
that we're wearing on our bodies?

427
00:37:42,229 --> 00:37:44,315
That blend in with some of our skin-tones
better than others?

428
00:37:44,773 --> 00:37:46,233
Excuse my friend.

429
00:37:46,734 --> 00:37:48,485
He is the boss' nephew.
He's a little...

430
00:37:53,991 --> 00:37:56,994
Yeah. I got one of those too.

431
00:37:57,453 --> 00:37:59,830
I mean, this one? This one I love.

432
00:37:59,997 --> 00:38:01,040
I'm so proud.

433
00:38:01,206 --> 00:38:02,666
You're doing great. So proud of you.

434
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,585
But this one, I just...

435
00:38:11,508 --> 00:38:14,053
- Everything he does drives me crazy.
- Yeah.

436
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:16,472
- I thought you said something else.
- Shut up.

437
00:38:17,264 --> 00:38:18,349
I swear I'm gonna throttle him.

438
00:38:18,515 --> 00:38:20,893
I'm gonna go to jail for murder.
I am.

439
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,436
How'd you guys get here so fast?

440
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:24,188
I'll be honest with you,
we just happened in...

441
00:38:24,355 --> 00:38:26,690
before it burned
all the way through, thankfully.

442
00:38:26,857 --> 00:38:28,233
Good thing you were here.

443
00:38:28,609 --> 00:38:30,277
All right, guys, wrap it up.

444
00:38:30,736 --> 00:38:32,488
Looks like we're all clear here.

445
00:38:37,242 --> 00:38:38,494
Our spacesuits!

446
00:38:41,538 --> 00:38:44,166
You threw them in the contamination bin.

447
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:46,919
It expels stuff into space
the moment you shut the door.

448
00:38:47,086 --> 00:38:49,755
That would have been helpful information
three minutes ago.

449
00:38:49,922 --> 00:38:51,882
Damn it, Mantis,
why don't you ever think?

450
00:38:52,257 --> 00:38:54,093
Are we pretending to be angry again?

451
00:38:54,259 --> 00:38:55,386
Mantis, you asshole!

452
00:38:55,552 --> 00:38:58,013
Guys, just focus for two seconds.

453
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,390
We'll find another way out of here.

454
00:38:59,556 --> 00:39:02,601
Right now, we need to save Rocket's life.

455
00:39:04,395 --> 00:39:07,231
Nebula, Quinn, and I will get to the records
and get the passkey.

456
00:39:07,398 --> 00:39:09,900
Bug and Doofus, access the spaceport
through the elevator...

457
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:12,319
so Tree can land and get us out of here.

458
00:39:12,903 --> 00:39:13,904
Apologies.

459
00:39:14,071 --> 00:39:15,072
No problem.

460
00:39:16,281 --> 00:39:17,282
Go.

461
00:39:30,879 --> 00:39:32,881
Not my fault I don't know something...

462
00:39:33,048 --> 00:39:34,466
if no one ever tells me.

463
00:39:34,842 --> 00:39:36,093
I didn't even wanna come here.

464
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,720
I'm gonna need to see your...

465
00:39:37,886 --> 00:39:39,888
You're hopelessly in love...

466
00:39:40,556 --> 00:39:41,557
with him.

467
00:39:41,724 --> 00:39:43,100
Oh, no.

468
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:44,893
Hey.

469
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,061
Hey.

470
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:48,480
How you doin' today?

471
00:39:49,356 --> 00:39:50,816
I'm all right.

472
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:55,237
What was your name again?

473
00:39:55,863 --> 00:39:56,989
Drax the Destroyer.

474
00:39:58,824 --> 00:40:00,367
That is such a lovely name.

475
00:40:01,702 --> 00:40:02,953
I'll get the door for you.

476
00:40:05,247 --> 00:40:07,666
- I'll be here when you come back out, okay?
- Sure.

477
00:40:09,084 --> 00:40:10,336
Every single time.

478
00:40:12,338 --> 00:40:14,131
My name is Bletelsnort.

479
00:40:14,965 --> 00:40:17,760
Welcome to OrgoCorp headquarters.

480
00:40:18,177 --> 00:40:19,595
For over 300 years...

481
00:40:19,762 --> 00:40:22,348
OrgoCorp has been producing
cybernetic implants...

482
00:40:22,514 --> 00:40:24,975
and genetic upgrades
across the universe...

483
00:40:25,142 --> 00:40:28,562
under the watchful eye
of the High Evolutionary.

484
00:40:30,105 --> 00:40:32,900
That warning we got today,
don't those two match the description?

485
00:40:33,776 --> 00:40:35,444
Attention, all Orgosentries...

486
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,948
That manager should have access
to the records.

487
00:40:40,866 --> 00:40:43,661
If the passkey is here,
she can get it for us.

488
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:46,080
All right. I'll handle this one.

489
00:40:46,246 --> 00:40:47,289
How?

490
00:40:47,748 --> 00:40:49,667
Pure Star-Lord charm.

491
00:40:50,209 --> 00:40:53,003
I'm excited for you that you get to
see this again for the first time.

492
00:41:00,427 --> 00:41:01,720
Hi, Yura.

493
00:41:02,262 --> 00:41:03,263
Ura.

494
00:41:03,806 --> 00:41:04,807
- Ura.
- Hi.

495
00:41:04,974 --> 00:41:07,017
Hi, my name's Patrick Swayze.

496
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,688
I've been noticing you for quite a while...

497
00:41:10,854 --> 00:41:12,606
and the way that you smile to yourself...

498
00:41:12,773 --> 00:41:14,650
when you think nobody is looking...

499
00:41:14,817 --> 00:41:16,777
it makes my every day a bit brighter.

500
00:41:16,944 --> 00:41:18,821
We need your hand.
And it's your choice...

501
00:41:18,988 --> 00:41:20,322
whether it's on your body or not.

502
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:22,616
- What are you doing?
- She was never gonna fall for that.

503
00:41:23,534 --> 00:41:24,618
Dude, she was totally into me, man!

504
00:41:24,785 --> 00:41:26,996
- I kind of thought you were a douchebag.
- Come on.

505
00:41:27,162 --> 00:41:28,455
- We need a file.
- What file?

506
00:41:28,622 --> 00:41:30,749
89P13. Could that be something?

507
00:41:30,916 --> 00:41:33,043
- No.
- Then your use to us...

508
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,920
- is over.
- Wait, wait, wait!

509
00:41:35,087 --> 00:41:36,296
It sounds like a species tag.

510
00:41:37,548 --> 00:41:38,632
Show us!

511
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:46,432
All of our research supports the
High Evolutionary's altruistic objective...

512
00:41:46,598 --> 00:41:49,268
of creating a utopian society.

513
00:41:49,435 --> 00:41:51,020
That must be the spaceport.

514
00:41:58,819 --> 00:41:59,945
What is all this?

515
00:42:00,112 --> 00:42:03,490
Species patented over the years
using OrgoCorp tech.

516
00:42:03,657 --> 00:42:07,870
Every species OrgoCorp has created
has its own individual file.

517
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:09,538
I'm so sorry about this.

518
00:42:09,705 --> 00:42:11,665
Listen to me,
this is not the kind of thing we do.

519
00:42:11,832 --> 00:42:13,876
Please, stop it with the subtle jabs!

520
00:42:14,043 --> 00:42:16,879
Old you would have never done this.
You had a purpose higher than yourself.

521
00:42:17,046 --> 00:42:18,088
- A calling to help people.
- Give me a break.

522
00:42:18,255 --> 00:42:19,840
That's why you left Thanos
and formed the Guardians.

523
00:42:20,007 --> 00:42:22,051
Except, I didn't form the Guardians.

524
00:42:22,217 --> 00:42:23,761
And I barely left Thanos.

525
00:42:23,927 --> 00:42:26,472
Whoever it was that you were in love with...

526
00:42:27,723 --> 00:42:28,724
it wasn't me.

527
00:42:29,475 --> 00:42:30,726
It sounds more like her.

528
00:42:30,893 --> 00:42:31,894
- Her?
- What?

529
00:42:32,061 --> 00:42:34,772
- That's ridiculous! Don't even...
- Do not bring me into this.

530
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,278
- Knock it off!
- What?

531
00:42:41,445 --> 00:42:43,989
Don't look at me like a lost puppy
needing a soft place...

532
00:42:44,156 --> 00:42:45,407
- to lie down.
- I didn't say anything!

533
00:42:49,703 --> 00:42:51,580
I just never noticed
how black your eyes were.

534
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:56,669
They were replaced by my father...

535
00:42:57,419 --> 00:42:58,796
as a method of torture.

536
00:42:58,962 --> 00:43:01,465
He picked a pretty set.

537
00:43:03,968 --> 00:43:05,260
There.

538
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:08,889
That's the file for 89P13.

539
00:43:10,391 --> 00:43:11,892
Heads up, heads up!

540
00:43:14,269 --> 00:43:15,437
Okay.

541
00:43:19,525 --> 00:43:20,526
What?

542
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:36,750
Oh, no.

543
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:39,211
Walk!

544
00:43:41,505 --> 00:43:42,756
Move it, move it!

545
00:43:49,263 --> 00:43:50,723
Stand down!

546
00:43:51,181 --> 00:43:52,933
Drax, we should make a run for it.

547
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,101
Or we could fight.

548
00:43:54,268 --> 00:43:55,185
- Run.
- Fight.

549
00:43:55,352 --> 00:43:56,812
- Run!
- Fight!

550
00:43:56,979 --> 00:43:57,855
Take 'em!

551
00:44:03,235 --> 00:44:04,403
What are we gonna do?

552
00:44:06,113 --> 00:44:07,239
- I got a plan.
- What is it?

553
00:44:07,406 --> 00:44:08,407
All of you, come with me...

554
00:44:09,325 --> 00:44:11,702
Everybody, lower your weapons...

555
00:44:11,869 --> 00:44:13,370
or I blow this woman's brains out!

556
00:44:13,537 --> 00:44:14,663
That's the plan?

557
00:44:15,748 --> 00:44:17,750
You're a kitty cat.

558
00:44:20,336 --> 00:44:21,879
You feel like dancing.

559
00:44:24,131 --> 00:44:25,382
Violent rage.

560
00:44:31,263 --> 00:44:32,640
Lower your weapons!

561
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:39,730
Let's kill that one that looks like a carrot
to show we mean business.

562
00:44:40,314 --> 00:44:42,358
God! Past Gamora's just mean!

563
00:44:42,524 --> 00:44:45,486
She was always like that,
and yet, I was the bad guy.

564
00:44:45,653 --> 00:44:47,404
We are not killing anyone!

565
00:44:47,571 --> 00:44:48,572
Back off!

566
00:44:50,824 --> 00:44:52,701
Groot, bring the Bowie to us.

567
00:44:52,868 --> 00:44:53,702
Now.

568
00:45:05,005 --> 00:45:06,340
I'm so sorry about this, Ura.

569
00:45:06,507 --> 00:45:07,591
Oh, please.

570
00:45:07,758 --> 00:45:11,178
We're here to save the life of our friend,
that is all.

571
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:14,890
We paid her to help us get in and get out.

572
00:45:15,057 --> 00:45:16,642
You'd think that'd mean,
I'm gonna help you do it in a way...

573
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:17,977
that no one knows it's happening.

574
00:45:18,143 --> 00:45:20,479
But no, what she means is,
I'm gonna shoot people.

575
00:45:20,646 --> 00:45:22,272
- Threaten people's lives.
- Shut up!

576
00:45:23,315 --> 00:45:25,859
And I know you're probably asking,
why would I trust her?

577
00:45:26,026 --> 00:45:27,861
Well, that's a good question.

578
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,323
The answer is, we used to be in love.

579
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:33,409
Yeah. She was my girlfriend...

580
00:45:33,575 --> 00:45:35,577
only she doesn't remember it,
because it wasn't her.

581
00:45:35,744 --> 00:45:37,538
Because her dad threw her off a magic cliff
and she died...

582
00:45:37,705 --> 00:45:40,582
and then I lost my temper
and nearly destroyed half the universe.

583
00:45:40,749 --> 00:45:43,919
Then she came back, out of the past.
And there she is.

584
00:45:44,086 --> 00:45:45,879
Everyone else who died in the past
stayed dead, not her.

585
00:45:46,046 --> 00:45:48,215
Why? Was it the magic cliff?
I don't know.

586
00:45:48,382 --> 00:45:50,759
I'm not some
fricking Infinity Stone scientist.

587
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,264
Just some dumbass Earth dude who met a girl,
fell in love...

588
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:57,266
that girl died...

589
00:45:57,725 --> 00:45:59,935
and then came back a total dick.

590
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:05,024
He left out some important information...

591
00:46:05,816 --> 00:46:07,359
but that is the gist of it.

592
00:46:14,116 --> 00:46:15,367
Get to the security hub!

593
00:46:15,534 --> 00:46:16,535
Okay!

594
00:46:25,502 --> 00:46:28,088
Everybody, down on the floor,
or we blow your brains out!

595
00:46:28,255 --> 00:46:29,923
Hey, hey, hey, we don't want any...

596
00:46:30,799 --> 00:46:32,676
No! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No!

597
00:46:32,843 --> 00:46:35,512
Come on!
Would you please stop doing that?

598
00:47:00,996 --> 00:47:02,122
Yeah!

599
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:03,415
Hey!

600
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:19,640
Run.

601
00:47:50,963 --> 00:47:52,423
Drax!

602
00:47:54,967 --> 00:47:57,886
Get on the ground
and show me your hands now.

603
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:08,397
Ura?

604
00:48:08,897 --> 00:48:10,274
Please listen to me.

605
00:48:10,441 --> 00:48:12,651
We need to get out of here with this...

606
00:48:12,818 --> 00:48:14,111
to save my best friend's life.

607
00:48:14,862 --> 00:48:16,947
If you could get us into
the system of those sentries out there...

608
00:48:17,114 --> 00:48:18,824
they are good people, like you.

609
00:48:18,991 --> 00:48:20,159
I'm certain of it.

610
00:48:20,326 --> 00:48:22,328
And if I just had an opportunity
to speak to them...

611
00:48:22,494 --> 00:48:25,205
They're corporate shills, you idiot.
They're not gonna listen to you.

612
00:48:25,372 --> 00:48:27,124
They will listen
if I speak to them from my heart.

613
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:29,209
Ura.

614
00:48:30,252 --> 00:48:31,253
Please.

615
00:48:41,138 --> 00:48:42,056
Hey!

616
00:48:45,684 --> 00:48:47,561
Come out now!

617
00:48:47,895 --> 00:48:48,896
Damn it!

618
00:48:56,111 --> 00:48:57,321
You are in.

619
00:48:58,697 --> 00:48:59,698
Tell them your truth.

620
00:48:59,865 --> 00:49:01,283
Yeah, I'm not that big of an idiot.

621
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:02,910
I just needed to get into the system.

622
00:49:04,703 --> 00:49:05,788
Move it.

623
00:49:17,132 --> 00:49:18,676
Told you she was into me.

624
00:49:39,822 --> 00:49:41,031
I am Groot?

625
00:49:41,865 --> 00:49:44,159
Yeah, that looked cool.

626
00:49:53,377 --> 00:49:55,713
Is sky?

627
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,131
No.

628
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:00,884
That's not sky, that's a ceiling.

629
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:04,847
But sire's making a new world
for all of us...

630
00:50:05,306 --> 00:50:07,016
and when we get there...

631
00:50:07,433 --> 00:50:08,976
there will be sky...

632
00:50:09,643 --> 00:50:12,855
and it will be beautiful and forever.

633
00:50:17,735 --> 00:50:19,737
I have been thinking.

634
00:50:20,529 --> 00:50:21,530
'Bout what?

635
00:50:22,406 --> 00:50:23,991
Nothing in particular.

636
00:50:24,616 --> 00:50:28,037
But I thought,
since you guys are my closest friends...

637
00:50:28,203 --> 00:50:29,955
and my only friends...

638
00:50:30,122 --> 00:50:34,543
you might be interested in knowing
that I have been thinking.

639
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:36,170
That's cool.

640
00:50:36,962 --> 00:50:38,672
I've been thinking too...

641
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:41,383
about something more singular.

642
00:50:42,176 --> 00:50:44,637
When sire moves us to the new world...

643
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:46,639
we're gonna need names.

644
00:50:47,514 --> 00:50:48,515
I mean...

645
00:50:48,682 --> 00:50:50,559
89Q12...

646
00:50:50,726 --> 00:50:52,144
it's not really a name...

647
00:50:53,771 --> 00:50:57,650
so I would like my name to be...

648
00:50:58,901 --> 00:50:59,985
Lylla.

649
00:51:00,736 --> 00:51:01,904
Lylla.

650
00:51:02,404 --> 00:51:03,530
Lylla.

651
00:51:03,864 --> 00:51:05,240
Lylla.

652
00:51:05,407 --> 00:51:07,451
That's a pretty name, Lylla.

653
00:51:08,786 --> 00:51:09,912
Thank you.

654
00:51:11,038 --> 00:51:14,375
I think my name shall be Teefs...

655
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,670
because, although we all do have them...

656
00:51:18,045 --> 00:51:20,506
mine are definitely the most prominent.

657
00:51:22,007 --> 00:51:23,842
- Teefs.
- Teefs.

658
00:51:24,009 --> 00:51:25,803
- Lylla.
- Teefs.

659
00:51:26,512 --> 00:51:31,141
Me be called Floor,
because me is lying on floor.

660
00:51:31,475 --> 00:51:34,353
You're lying on a floor,
so your name is Floor?

661
00:51:35,854 --> 00:51:37,147
Yes!

662
00:51:38,607 --> 00:51:40,442
- Floor.
- Floor.

663
00:51:40,609 --> 00:51:42,152
What about you, friend?

664
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:48,951
Someday, I'm gonna make
great machines that fly...

665
00:51:49,785 --> 00:51:52,830
and me and my friends
are gonna go flyin' together...

666
00:51:52,997 --> 00:51:56,166
into the forever and beautiful sky.

667
00:51:56,917 --> 00:51:59,336
Lylla, and Teefs...

668
00:51:59,753 --> 00:52:02,589
and Floor, and me...

669
00:52:03,924 --> 00:52:05,259
Rocket.

670
00:52:07,678 --> 00:52:09,054
Rocket.

671
00:52:10,055 --> 00:52:12,558
It really is good to have friends.

672
00:52:13,475 --> 00:52:14,560
Yeah.

673
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,442
Start the incision here.

674
00:52:24,361 --> 00:52:25,571
Keep calm.

675
00:52:28,741 --> 00:52:30,451
- Hold it still.
- I can't!

676
00:52:30,617 --> 00:52:33,203
It won't stop moving.

677
00:52:33,912 --> 00:52:36,623
Why did he never tell us
about any of this?

678
00:52:37,082 --> 00:52:39,501
This is worse
than what Thanos did to me.

679
00:52:41,253 --> 00:52:43,505
Well, what about the passkey?
Is it there?

680
00:52:48,052 --> 00:52:50,137
No. But a file was removed today.

681
00:52:50,304 --> 00:52:52,723
Downloaded and deleted,
a million characters in length.

682
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:57,353
The biometrics say it was this man.
Recorder B2H6.

683
00:52:57,519 --> 00:52:58,937
I saw this guy outside of records today.

684
00:53:01,607 --> 00:53:03,734
Looks like one of
the High Evolutionary's recorders.

685
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,736
The High Evolutionary?

686
00:53:06,779 --> 00:53:08,030
The founder of OrgoCorp?

687
00:53:08,197 --> 00:53:09,990
OrgoCorp is just a way
to fund his experiments...

688
00:53:10,157 --> 00:53:11,992
that lie outside intergalactic laws.

689
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:14,203
He's created whole societies.

690
00:53:14,578 --> 00:53:16,747
Xeronians, the Ani-Men...

691
00:53:16,914 --> 00:53:18,207
- The Sovereign.
- The Sovereign?

692
00:53:18,374 --> 00:53:20,417
Corners of the universe consider him God.

693
00:53:22,127 --> 00:53:23,337
I am Groot.

694
00:53:23,504 --> 00:53:24,505
Yes.

695
00:53:24,672 --> 00:53:25,756
Yes, what? That he's Groot?

696
00:53:25,923 --> 00:53:29,301
He said maybe this man downloaded the passkey
into the computer on his head.

697
00:53:30,594 --> 00:53:32,930
That could store the passkey.

698
00:53:33,097 --> 00:53:34,848
We find him, we save Rocket.

699
00:53:35,557 --> 00:53:37,559
The High Evolutionary's coordinates.

700
00:53:39,228 --> 00:53:40,354
Put the coordinates in the nav.

701
00:53:40,521 --> 00:53:41,522
Wait a minute.

702
00:53:42,398 --> 00:53:43,732
Are you kidding me?

703
00:53:44,191 --> 00:53:47,111
What he wants
is that gutted badger in the Med-Bay...

704
00:53:47,277 --> 00:53:49,071
and you're gonna bring it straight to him?

705
00:53:49,738 --> 00:53:50,864
It's almost certainly a trap.

706
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:54,410
Trap isn't a trap if you know the trap
is trying to trap you. It's a face-off.

707
00:53:54,576 --> 00:53:56,912
A face-off is a trap if you're facing off...

708
00:53:57,079 --> 00:53:59,915
against a guy a thousand times
more powerful than you.

709
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:02,918
Do you know who the High Evolutionary is?

710
00:54:03,085 --> 00:54:06,255
Yeah, he's some dickhead
who dissected my best friend.

711
00:54:06,422 --> 00:54:08,298
- Second best.
- The High Evolutionary...

712
00:54:08,465 --> 00:54:10,342
isn't someone you wanna
think about messing with.

713
00:54:10,509 --> 00:54:12,344
We won't think about it when we do it.

714
00:54:12,511 --> 00:54:14,430
You know what? I don't care!

715
00:54:14,596 --> 00:54:15,639
Just drop me off with the Ravagers...

716
00:54:15,806 --> 00:54:17,766
and you go do
whatever it is that you wanna do.

717
00:54:17,933 --> 00:54:19,018
We don't have time for this.

718
00:54:19,184 --> 00:54:21,729
I'm not asking you.
Drop me off with my people now!

719
00:54:21,895 --> 00:54:24,732
Your people?
The Ravagers aren't your people.

720
00:54:24,898 --> 00:54:26,734
I'm a damn Ravager. You aren't.

721
00:54:28,277 --> 00:54:30,821
Listen, I know you were always
looking for a family. Okay?

722
00:54:30,988 --> 00:54:32,489
But my Gamora, the one I loved...

723
00:54:32,656 --> 00:54:33,949
she didn't find it
with a group of criminals...

724
00:54:34,116 --> 00:54:35,242
she found it with us.

725
00:54:35,409 --> 00:54:37,619
People who care about you.

726
00:54:37,786 --> 00:54:40,039
I know that's who you still are.

727
00:54:40,748 --> 00:54:42,541
Somewhere inside of you...

728
00:54:45,461 --> 00:54:50,215
What are you so afraid of in your self
that I need to be something for you?

729
00:54:50,758 --> 00:54:53,385
I don't give a shit about your Gamora.

730
00:54:53,552 --> 00:54:54,928
Life made me me!

731
00:54:57,598 --> 00:55:00,517
I have a few upgrades courtesy of
that gutted badger in the Med-Bay...

732
00:55:00,684 --> 00:55:03,395
and we are not risking his life
to make yours more convenient.

733
00:55:03,562 --> 00:55:04,688
I'm family.

734
00:55:04,855 --> 00:55:06,357
So is he.

735
00:55:10,819 --> 00:55:12,071
Screw you.

736
00:55:14,615 --> 00:55:16,367
Screw all of you.

737
00:55:28,462 --> 00:55:30,506
Found him on the outskirts
of the first shield...

738
00:55:30,673 --> 00:55:32,758
pirating supply ships.

739
00:55:33,592 --> 00:55:34,885
I do appreciate this, good sir.

740
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:39,056
And I appreciate your generous contribution
to the Orgosentry retirement fund.

741
00:55:39,223 --> 00:55:40,474
Your associate...

742
00:55:41,183 --> 00:55:44,687
a Zehoberei named Gamora,
where is she now?

743
00:55:44,853 --> 00:55:46,105
You ain't getting nothing from me.

744
00:55:46,271 --> 00:55:48,899
Oh, we'll see about that,
won't we?

745
00:55:49,733 --> 00:55:50,901
Adam.

746
00:55:52,236 --> 00:55:53,320
Adam.

747
00:55:53,487 --> 00:55:54,488
Yes, Mother?

748
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:55,948
Show him we mean business.

749
00:56:17,803 --> 00:56:21,015
I said show him we mean business,
not disintegrate him!

750
00:56:21,181 --> 00:56:22,599
What more business
could we have shown him?

751
00:56:22,766 --> 00:56:24,226
But now he's of no use to us!

752
00:56:24,393 --> 00:56:25,436
Well, let's just question
the man's friend.

753
00:56:25,602 --> 00:56:27,229
Friend?
You think that's a friend?

754
00:56:27,396 --> 00:56:28,564
It's an animal!

755
00:56:31,025 --> 00:56:32,318
He looks sad.

756
00:56:34,153 --> 00:56:36,071
I really don't enjoy
how that's making me feel actually.

757
00:56:38,949 --> 00:56:39,950
Your friend's a moron.

758
00:56:40,409 --> 00:56:42,161
I got one of those too. I get it.

759
00:56:42,995 --> 00:56:43,996
Outpost?

760
00:56:44,163 --> 00:56:45,372
This is Gamora, you there?

761
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:49,126
Fitz-Gibbonok.

762
00:56:49,293 --> 00:56:50,294
Come in.

763
00:56:55,507 --> 00:56:57,134
Outpost, come in.

764
00:56:58,135 --> 00:56:59,762
Yes, Gamora.

765
00:57:00,387 --> 00:57:01,722
Salutations.

766
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:03,223
May I help?

767
00:57:04,266 --> 00:57:05,809
Well, I need you guys to come pick me up.

768
00:57:05,976 --> 00:57:08,646
I'm gonna upload the location-link
to the craft I'm on.

769
00:57:09,188 --> 00:57:11,231
Oh, I think we can arrange that.

770
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:11,083
You need to say to him
exactly what I told you to say.

771
00:58:11,875 --> 00:58:12,876
Why don't you just say it?

772
00:58:13,043 --> 00:58:15,337
No one ever listens to me.

773
00:58:30,602 --> 00:58:31,603
Quill...

774
00:58:32,521 --> 00:58:33,689
Life is a pond...

775
00:58:34,606 --> 00:58:37,943
and you've spent your entire life
leaping from woman to woman...

776
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:40,321
as if they're lily pads
upon this great pond.

777
00:58:41,071 --> 00:58:43,324
Perhaps, what you need to do, Quill...

778
00:58:44,742 --> 00:58:46,327
is learn to swim.

779
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,165
That actually made sense.

780
00:58:51,332 --> 00:58:52,291
Yes, it made sense.

781
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:54,668
No, I mean, that's sort of an analogy.

782
00:58:55,419 --> 00:58:58,630
And I didn't know that you were capable
of that type of thought.

783
00:58:58,797 --> 00:59:00,341
I know lots of analogies, Quill.

784
00:59:00,883 --> 00:59:03,010
Analogies, metaphors, et cetera.

785
00:59:04,219 --> 00:59:05,262
For instance...

786
00:59:06,472 --> 00:59:10,059
Gamora's head is like a lily pad
because it is green.

787
00:59:11,477 --> 00:59:12,728
Analogy.

788
00:59:13,437 --> 00:59:14,813
And also stupid-looking...

789
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:16,231
- and flappy.
- Flappy?

790
00:59:16,398 --> 00:59:18,859
Because her skin is made of a leaf.

791
00:59:19,318 --> 00:59:20,319
Metaphor.

792
00:59:20,486 --> 00:59:21,779
Is it?

793
00:59:21,945 --> 00:59:25,115
Yesterday, I made a poop
shaped like a fish.

794
00:59:25,282 --> 00:59:29,078
Even my butt is capable of making an analogy.

795
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:40,214
What's happening?

796
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:42,633
The fluid is in his lungs.

797
00:59:43,676 --> 00:59:45,302
P13?

798
00:59:46,595 --> 00:59:48,013
P13.

799
00:59:49,765 --> 00:59:50,891
Sire.

800
00:59:51,934 --> 00:59:53,227
P13!

801
00:59:53,394 --> 00:59:55,813
- My lord, might I suggest that we...
- Where is it? I passed it.

802
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,481
Must...

803
00:59:59,233 --> 01:00:03,237
Sire was in the middle of his treatments
when we had a breakthrough with Batch 92.

804
01:00:03,404 --> 01:00:05,197
Perhaps then we should resume tomorrow, yes?

805
01:00:05,364 --> 01:00:07,282
We shall resume tomorrow, no!

806
01:00:07,449 --> 01:00:08,701
P13!

807
01:00:11,996 --> 01:00:12,997
There you are.

808
01:00:23,048 --> 01:00:24,049
Hello.

809
01:00:34,893 --> 01:00:36,145
How did you know...

810
01:00:36,729 --> 01:00:40,274
about the microseminoproteins, P13?

811
01:01:04,381 --> 01:01:06,008
What happened in there?

812
01:01:06,925 --> 01:01:07,926
Why?

813
01:01:08,636 --> 01:01:11,180
How did you know, P13?

814
01:01:11,347 --> 01:01:13,265
It was too little filtration...

815
01:01:13,432 --> 01:01:15,976
In the hypotonic, yes, we know,
we fixed that.

816
01:01:16,143 --> 01:01:17,770
But how did you know?

817
01:01:18,479 --> 01:01:20,814
I made you!

818
01:01:20,981 --> 01:01:23,150
How did you know?

819
01:01:27,196 --> 01:01:28,447
Because it worked.

820
01:01:35,537 --> 01:01:36,872
It worked.

821
01:01:39,583 --> 01:01:41,710
Their rage is gone.

822
01:01:42,711 --> 01:01:45,339
We have the peaceful creatures
we always sought...

823
01:01:45,506 --> 01:01:48,092
ready to inhabit the new world.

824
01:01:51,011 --> 01:01:52,680
We're going to the new world?

825
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,266
We?

826
01:01:58,811 --> 01:02:00,062
Look at you.

827
01:02:00,437 --> 01:02:01,522
As if you were...

828
01:02:01,689 --> 01:02:04,316
cobbled together by fat-fingered children.

829
01:02:04,483 --> 01:02:07,403
How could you be part of a perfect species?

830
01:02:07,736 --> 01:02:11,573
You're simply a medley of mistakes
we could learn from...

831
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:14,410
and apply to the creatures
that truly mattered.

832
01:02:15,828 --> 01:02:20,958
Batch 89 was never meant
for the new world, P13.

833
01:02:21,125 --> 01:02:22,626
You could figure out...

834
01:02:22,793 --> 01:02:26,505
the complex workings
of cytoplasmic filtration systems...

835
01:02:26,672 --> 01:02:28,549
but you couldn't figure out that?

836
01:02:32,636 --> 01:02:34,096
But that brain.

837
01:02:35,389 --> 01:02:37,474
That, I'd like to study further.

838
01:02:42,021 --> 01:02:45,316
Prep it for surgery and removal
in the morning.

839
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,277
What about the rest of Batch 89, sire?

840
01:02:51,989 --> 01:02:53,449
Incinerate them.

841
01:03:01,332 --> 01:03:03,917
He's dying.
We need that passkey.

842
01:03:04,877 --> 01:03:06,086
We don't have long.

843
01:03:07,421 --> 01:03:08,881
We've arrived.

844
01:03:24,146 --> 01:03:25,522
That looks just like...

845
01:03:26,774 --> 01:03:27,775
home.

846
01:03:40,412 --> 01:03:42,206
It's like a replica of Earth.

847
01:03:42,373 --> 01:03:43,582
It makes no sense.

848
01:03:43,749 --> 01:03:46,794
Atmosphere is habitable.
Gravity's Xandar minus one.

849
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:40,431
Hello.

850
01:04:40,597 --> 01:04:43,017
We mean you no harm.

851
01:04:54,278 --> 01:04:56,322
Listen to me, he was just trying
to throw her back her ball.

852
01:04:59,241 --> 01:05:00,242
Hey!

853
01:05:01,702 --> 01:05:03,329
Come on! There's no reason...

854
01:05:05,122 --> 01:05:06,123
Hey, hey.

855
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:08,042
Groot, full Kaiju!

856
01:05:08,208 --> 01:05:10,627
- Not full Kaiju!
- I am...

857
01:05:11,003 --> 01:05:12,004
- Groot!
- Back up.

858
01:05:12,171 --> 01:05:13,547
No, not Kaiju!

859
01:05:13,881 --> 01:05:14,882
Groot, down!

860
01:05:15,049 --> 01:05:16,634
There's no reason to be afraid.

861
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:20,638
Get down, Groot!

862
01:05:21,305 --> 01:05:22,681
Everybody, it's okay.
It's okay.

863
01:05:22,848 --> 01:05:23,891
Hey. Hey, hi.

864
01:05:24,058 --> 01:05:25,726
We're not here to harm you.

865
01:05:26,644 --> 01:05:27,645
Okay.

866
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:29,605
See? Here.

867
01:05:30,731 --> 01:05:31,982
For your knee.

868
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,986
We just need to save our friend.

869
01:05:40,616 --> 01:05:43,035
Filthy. It doesn't belong here.

870
01:05:44,662 --> 01:05:46,872
I will train it
in the ways of the Sovereign.

871
01:05:49,958 --> 01:05:51,126
I will train him not to do that.

872
01:05:51,293 --> 01:05:53,629
It's an act of blasphemy
even having it here.

873
01:05:54,213 --> 01:05:56,090
Kill it. Now.

874
01:05:56,799 --> 01:06:00,636
I am the Warlock, Mum,
and I am done with being ordered around.

875
01:06:01,929 --> 01:06:03,180
Gamora is here.

876
01:06:04,723 --> 01:06:07,059
Which means the squirrel is also.

877
01:06:07,226 --> 01:06:09,353
To save ourselves,
we must bring it to the High Evolutionary...

878
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,271
before his own people do.

879
01:06:35,796 --> 01:06:36,839
Yeah, yeah, sit.

880
01:06:37,006 --> 01:06:38,674
Let's sit. Okay.

881
01:06:48,392 --> 01:06:49,518
I am Groot.

882
01:06:49,685 --> 01:06:51,478
It's not rude.
It's what it's here for.

883
01:06:51,645 --> 01:06:52,980
Drax, sit up!

884
01:06:53,147 --> 01:06:54,148
Idiot.

885
01:06:56,358 --> 01:06:57,318
Thank you.

886
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:02,865
Thank you.

887
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,368
Our friend...

888
01:07:07,661 --> 01:07:08,871
He's dying.

889
01:07:15,210 --> 01:07:18,130
We love our friend.

890
01:07:19,757 --> 01:07:21,050
But he is dying.

891
01:07:24,178 --> 01:07:26,221
That's not dying, that's already dead.

892
01:07:26,388 --> 01:07:27,765
They'll think he's already dead.

893
01:07:27,931 --> 01:07:29,850
They'll think we're here
on a quest for revenge.

894
01:07:30,017 --> 01:07:31,685
Drax, sit up.

895
01:07:31,852 --> 01:07:32,853
That's what it's here for!

896
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:34,104
Drax, it isn't.

897
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,814
It's made for people
to sit shoulder to shoulder...

898
01:07:35,981 --> 01:07:37,900
right next to each other.
Get your boots off her pillows.

899
01:07:38,067 --> 01:07:40,527
I find it hard to believe
it doesn't have multiple purposes!

900
01:07:40,694 --> 01:07:41,987
I'm sorry. My friend...

901
01:07:42,404 --> 01:07:43,405
is a dumbass.

902
01:07:44,698 --> 01:07:46,116
That's the same as your dying.

903
01:07:46,283 --> 01:07:47,951
Why do you criticize everything?

904
01:07:48,118 --> 01:07:49,370
Well, why is it oblong then?

905
01:07:49,536 --> 01:07:50,788
It was a totally different sound.

906
01:07:50,954 --> 01:07:53,916
No, it wasn't. Dying. Dumbass. See?
It's the same.

907
01:07:54,083 --> 01:07:55,125
All right, guys!

908
01:07:55,501 --> 01:07:57,753
Can I proceed, please,
to try to save our friend?

909
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,296
Drax, I see you!

910
01:08:00,589 --> 01:08:05,052
I understand that none of this
makes any sense to you right now.

911
01:08:05,552 --> 01:08:07,721
We need your help...

912
01:08:08,347 --> 01:08:10,516
in finding a man.

913
01:08:11,517 --> 01:08:12,726
I'm gonna draw.

914
01:08:12,893 --> 01:08:15,062
I'm gonna draw the man
that we're looking for.

915
01:08:17,021 --> 01:08:18,482
Like this.

916
01:08:19,274 --> 01:08:20,693
You see the thing on her head?

917
01:08:21,193 --> 01:08:24,238
- He has a thing like this.
- That is delightful.

918
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:25,864
There you go.

919
01:08:26,699 --> 01:08:29,118
Have you seen this man?

920
01:08:30,869 --> 01:08:32,287
That's very good.

921
01:08:32,454 --> 01:08:34,498
Can I have that later
to hang in my apartment, please?

922
01:08:34,665 --> 01:08:36,458
Yeah.
Thank you.

923
01:08:38,043 --> 01:08:39,837
His name is Mowtio?

924
01:08:58,646 --> 01:09:00,899
Many mowtios. There?

925
01:09:01,817 --> 01:09:03,235
At the pyramid.

926
01:09:05,695 --> 01:09:08,614
Is that your car in the driveway?

927
01:09:14,163 --> 01:09:16,582
Drax, stay here with Rocket.

928
01:09:16,748 --> 01:09:17,875
Watch him.
That's who they're coming for.

929
01:09:18,042 --> 01:09:19,293
- I wanna come.
- No.

930
01:09:19,626 --> 01:09:21,337
Mantis, watch Drax.

931
01:09:21,503 --> 01:09:23,672
Groot, you know what to do with these.

932
01:09:31,387 --> 01:09:33,098
- Push down on it.
- What?

933
01:09:33,265 --> 01:09:35,309
- Push it down.
- I am pushing down on it.

934
01:09:35,476 --> 01:09:36,268
Push the button.

935
01:09:37,603 --> 01:09:39,563
- It looks like you're pushing the keyhole.
- The what?

936
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:42,815
There's a button under the handle,
press that in.

937
01:09:44,193 --> 01:09:45,735
Okay. Now what?

938
01:09:45,903 --> 01:09:47,363
Open the fucking door.

939
01:09:49,698 --> 01:09:51,492
That is a stupid design...

940
01:09:51,659 --> 01:09:54,453
and your instructions were very unclear.

941
01:09:55,079 --> 01:09:57,331
Let's get that passkey and save our friend.

942
01:10:04,004 --> 01:10:05,422
I was eight years old
when I left Earth, okay?

943
01:10:05,589 --> 01:10:07,716
Why would I know any more about
driving one of these things than you do?

944
01:10:07,883 --> 01:10:08,801
Don't see you volunteering.

945
01:10:08,968 --> 01:10:09,969
- You want me to drive?
- No.

946
01:10:10,135 --> 01:10:11,512
- I'll drive.
- I don't want you to drive.

947
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:12,596
I got this.

948
01:10:57,641 --> 01:11:00,102
You must be a really loyal pet...

949
01:11:00,686 --> 01:11:03,564
if they're willing to do all this for you.

950
01:12:12,424 --> 01:12:14,677
This is the perfect society?

951
01:12:35,322 --> 01:12:36,323
Sire.

952
01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:38,617
This one has been running for two hours...

953
01:12:38,784 --> 01:12:40,327
without breaking a sweat.

954
01:12:40,494 --> 01:12:41,996
- It's incredible...
- They can survive...

955
01:12:42,162 --> 01:12:43,372
on thirty calories a day...

956
01:12:43,539 --> 01:12:46,375
an hour's sleep a week,
they're always happy...

957
01:12:46,542 --> 01:12:48,544
and they can rewire a carbenetrix core...

958
01:12:48,711 --> 01:12:50,629
in under two minutes.

959
01:12:51,046 --> 01:12:53,716
But will she be ready for the new colony?

960
01:12:54,425 --> 01:12:56,343
Sire, they're here.

961
01:13:02,933 --> 01:13:04,059
Here we go.

962
01:13:12,109 --> 01:13:13,110
We're here to see...

963
01:13:13,277 --> 01:13:15,779
The High Evolutionary is expecting you.

964
01:13:15,946 --> 01:13:17,031
Which means it is a trap.

965
01:13:17,197 --> 01:13:18,240
It's a face-off.

966
01:13:18,407 --> 01:13:20,659
- She stays here.
- Why?

967
01:13:20,826 --> 01:13:21,910
Policy against weaponry...

968
01:13:22,077 --> 01:13:23,495
and your arm is a gun.

969
01:13:28,584 --> 01:13:30,294
- He's clean.
- Let's go.

970
01:13:30,919 --> 01:13:31,920
Hey.

971
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:34,506
It'll be okay.

972
01:13:55,527 --> 01:13:56,695
Move it!

973
01:14:15,839 --> 01:14:17,383
Are you okay, Rocket?

974
01:14:35,526 --> 01:14:36,944
Me Rocket play now?

975
01:14:37,111 --> 01:14:38,112
I can't right now, Floor.

976
01:14:45,828 --> 01:14:46,829
What are you doing?

977
01:14:46,996 --> 01:14:48,622
They ain't gonna set us free.

978
01:14:49,415 --> 01:14:50,666
Yes, they are, Rocket.

979
01:14:50,833 --> 01:14:52,751
We're going to the new world
any day now.

980
01:14:56,338 --> 01:14:57,631
No, that can't be true.

981
01:14:57,798 --> 01:14:58,799
It is.

982
01:14:59,591 --> 01:15:01,302
They wanna kill us all in the morning.

983
01:15:01,468 --> 01:15:02,303
What?

984
01:15:02,469 --> 01:15:03,679
What?

985
01:15:03,846 --> 01:15:05,180
But I'm gonna fix it.

986
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:12,146
What is that?

987
01:15:12,313 --> 01:15:13,731
It's a key.

988
01:15:14,481 --> 01:15:16,608
I'm gonna use it
to get us all out of here.

989
01:15:17,609 --> 01:15:19,695
I don't know if that's wise, Rocket.

990
01:15:20,529 --> 01:15:21,947
Me Rocket leave!

991
01:15:22,114 --> 01:15:24,491
Hooray time forever!

992
01:15:25,492 --> 01:15:28,162
Just down that hall, there are ships.

993
01:15:29,204 --> 01:15:31,540
I know.
And if we can get to one...

994
01:15:31,707 --> 01:15:32,916
I can pilot it.

995
01:15:33,667 --> 01:15:36,628
And then we'll all fly away together,
the four of us...

996
01:15:37,463 --> 01:15:39,048
just like we always said, okay?

997
01:15:41,884 --> 01:15:42,885
Okay?

998
01:15:47,139 --> 01:15:50,934
Yippee! Rocket! Sky, sky, sky!

999
01:16:13,832 --> 01:16:15,584
- You did it!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

1000
01:16:15,751 --> 01:16:16,710
You did it!

1001
01:16:16,877 --> 01:16:19,004
You did it, you did it, you did it!

1002
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:40,901
You did it!

1003
01:16:42,194 --> 01:16:43,195
You did it.

1004
01:16:44,989 --> 01:16:46,365
It really is good to have...

1005
01:17:03,465 --> 01:17:06,593
Yes, I imagined you'd do something like this.

1006
01:17:07,469 --> 01:17:09,305
Back in the cage, P13.

1007
01:17:15,269 --> 01:17:16,812
Sky.

1008
01:17:30,784 --> 01:17:34,288
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1009
01:17:34,455 --> 01:17:37,958
- Q12 and P13 escaped from their pens.
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1010
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:40,210
- Q12 is neutralized...
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1011
01:17:40,377 --> 01:17:42,338
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.
- But P13 is still out...

1012
01:17:42,504 --> 01:17:45,257
- So I'll need assistance.
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1013
01:17:45,424 --> 01:17:47,551
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1014
01:17:47,718 --> 01:17:49,803
Remember not to bruise its brain.

1015
01:17:57,102 --> 01:17:59,021
All right, P13!

1016
01:17:59,188 --> 01:18:02,149
You win the crying contest.
Now, back in the cage.

1017
01:18:05,277 --> 01:18:06,362
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1018
01:18:06,528 --> 01:18:07,946
- Rocket, let's go!
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1019
01:18:08,113 --> 01:18:09,948
- Let's go! Rocket, please!
- Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now.

1020
01:18:10,199 --> 01:18:11,158
Rocket!

1021
01:18:11,575 --> 01:18:12,826
Rocket!

1022
01:18:15,162 --> 01:18:16,538
Down here. Hurry.

1023
01:19:14,638 --> 01:19:15,639
- Hey, there it is!
- Get him!

1024
01:19:15,806 --> 01:19:17,933
- Get back here!
- Get it!

1025
01:20:03,395 --> 01:20:04,438
What are you doing?

1026
01:20:04,605 --> 01:20:05,898
I got a bad feeling about this.

1027
01:20:06,065 --> 01:20:07,900
Peter just told you to stay here.

1028
01:20:08,067 --> 01:20:09,068
Yeah, well, that's his fault.

1029
01:20:09,234 --> 01:20:12,404
He should know by now that I never
do anything that anyone ever tells me.

1030
01:20:12,571 --> 01:20:14,365
We need to protect Rocket.

1031
01:20:14,698 --> 01:20:15,949
Yeah, that's right.

1032
01:20:16,742 --> 01:20:19,244
So, hop on and we'll ride back to the ship.

1033
01:20:19,411 --> 01:20:21,080
Just right over there?

1034
01:20:21,705 --> 01:20:22,706
Yeah.

1035
01:20:33,258 --> 01:20:36,220
Drax! Hey! Stop being a jerk!

1036
01:20:45,354 --> 01:20:46,355
You!

1037
01:20:46,897 --> 01:20:48,148
Hey, yeah, you!

1038
01:20:49,858 --> 01:20:52,027
I take it the passkey,
it's in that thing on your head.

1039
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:54,655
I would advise against aggression.

1040
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,366
Got time for me now?

1041
01:20:58,117 --> 01:21:01,036
Your friend once took advantage.

1042
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:02,955
I learn my lessons.

1043
01:21:03,622 --> 01:21:07,042
I aim some small part
of my mental capacity...

1044
01:21:07,209 --> 01:21:08,919
back in my own direction...

1045
01:21:09,086 --> 01:21:12,172
and now,
gravity itself serves my whims.

1046
01:21:13,674 --> 01:21:14,675
War Pig.

1047
01:21:14,842 --> 01:21:15,968
Now.

1048
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:21,557
You must find Counter-Earth familiar.

1049
01:21:21,724 --> 01:21:22,725
Counter-Earth?

1050
01:21:22,891 --> 01:21:24,935
I visited your planet many years ago.

1051
01:21:25,102 --> 01:21:26,770
Earth hasn't been my planet
in a long time.

1052
01:21:26,937 --> 01:21:28,063
Your people had...

1053
01:21:28,939 --> 01:21:30,024
wonderful spirit.

1054
01:21:30,858 --> 01:21:35,029
The art and music and literature
were some of the finest in the universe.

1055
01:21:35,446 --> 01:21:40,409
Earth would be a fabulous place,
were it not for the ignorance and bigotry.

1056
01:21:40,576 --> 01:21:42,578
- Okay.
- It inspired me to create Counter-Earth.

1057
01:21:42,745 --> 01:21:44,246
I don't care.

1058
01:21:44,413 --> 01:21:45,914
All of the good and none of the bad.

1059
01:21:46,081 --> 01:21:49,043
I don't need another speech
by some impotent whackjob...

1060
01:21:49,209 --> 01:21:50,461
whose mother didn't love him...

1061
01:21:50,627 --> 01:21:53,088
rationalizing why he needs
to conquer the universe.

1062
01:21:53,255 --> 01:21:56,050
I'm not trying to conquer the universe...

1063
01:21:56,717 --> 01:21:57,801
I'm perfecting it.

1064
01:22:03,849 --> 01:22:05,309
What the...

1065
01:22:24,662 --> 01:22:25,663
Hey!

1066
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,623
Drop the badger.

1067
01:22:32,503 --> 01:22:35,839
- I just want the passkey.
- Then bring me 89P13.

1068
01:22:36,006 --> 01:22:37,257
I am Groot.

1069
01:22:37,883 --> 01:22:39,677
He says, suck my...

1070
01:22:39,843 --> 01:22:41,053
Why are you so angry?

1071
01:22:41,261 --> 01:22:43,013
Because I know what you did to our friend.

1072
01:22:43,681 --> 01:22:46,850
Anything I've done,
I've done for the betterment of the universe.

1073
01:22:47,017 --> 01:22:48,394
Newsflash, Einstein.

1074
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,522
Better universes generally don't include
a bunch of octopuses selling meth...

1075
01:22:51,689 --> 01:22:53,440
to guys with cockroach heads.

1076
01:22:54,817 --> 01:22:55,818
They do not.

1077
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,321
Which is why...

1078
01:22:59,488 --> 01:23:01,657
as I have done many times before...

1079
01:23:02,116 --> 01:23:03,951
I'm going to have to raze it all...

1080
01:23:04,618 --> 01:23:05,786
and start again.

1081
01:23:05,953 --> 01:23:06,996
What?

1082
01:23:15,713 --> 01:23:17,423
I got 89P13...

1083
01:23:17,589 --> 01:23:18,966
and I'm on my way.

1084
01:23:19,133 --> 01:23:20,509
We're in possession of the subject.

1085
01:23:47,161 --> 01:23:48,454
Oh, my God.

1086
01:23:59,131 --> 01:24:00,174
I am Groot?

1087
01:24:00,341 --> 01:24:01,425
Kill 'em all.

1088
01:24:04,428 --> 01:24:05,554
Stay.

1089
01:24:07,931 --> 01:24:08,974
I said stay.

1090
01:24:10,225 --> 01:24:12,853
What, did you want me to leave you back,
so that Mother could fillet you?

1091
01:24:14,104 --> 01:24:15,147
Stay.

1092
01:24:15,314 --> 01:24:16,315
What the hell?

1093
01:24:16,482 --> 01:24:19,193
- We're working for the same boss.
- Yes...

1094
01:24:19,818 --> 01:24:20,944
but I need the credit, chum...

1095
01:24:21,111 --> 01:24:22,988
to save my entire civilization.

1096
01:24:23,947 --> 01:24:27,034
So be a good creepy thing...

1097
01:24:27,201 --> 01:24:28,035
and back off.

1098
01:24:37,670 --> 01:24:38,712
No.

1099
01:25:19,294 --> 01:25:20,421
Mother.

1100
01:25:44,737 --> 01:25:46,530
Mother!

1101
01:25:51,368 --> 01:25:52,745
Mantis and Drax, come in.

1102
01:25:53,454 --> 01:25:54,913
Mantis? Drax?

1103
01:25:55,622 --> 01:25:56,623
Hey.

1104
01:25:56,790 --> 01:25:59,001
I need you to bring the ship here now!

1105
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:03,464
Well, we can't do that exactly
because we're not at the ship.

1106
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:04,715
Then where the hell are...

1107
01:26:33,535 --> 01:26:34,536
Nebula, come in.

1108
01:26:34,703 --> 01:26:38,540
Gamora! Take off now!
Get yourself and Rocket off the planet.

1109
01:26:44,171 --> 01:26:45,422
What kinda ship is this?

1110
01:26:48,884 --> 01:26:50,386
It's amusing really.

1111
01:26:50,552 --> 01:26:51,929
How stupid are you?

1112
01:26:52,096 --> 01:26:53,806
It was so obviously a trap.

1113
01:26:54,223 --> 01:26:56,850
It's not a trap. It's a face-off.

1114
01:26:57,434 --> 01:26:59,103
Now kill them all.

1115
01:27:00,521 --> 01:27:01,563
What do you have in your hand?

1116
01:27:05,734 --> 01:27:06,735
Grenade!

1117
01:27:44,857 --> 01:27:48,235
I am Groot!

1118
01:28:20,309 --> 01:28:21,352
No! Don't!

1119
01:28:21,644 --> 01:28:24,772
Don't! No, no, no! No, please!
Please, spare me!

1120
01:28:24,938 --> 01:28:26,732
Please, spare me, please.

1121
01:28:30,694 --> 01:28:33,197
Thank you. Thank you. Thank...

1122
01:28:33,447 --> 01:28:34,573
That'd be premature.

1123
01:28:35,741 --> 01:28:37,159
No, no, no...

1124
01:28:48,212 --> 01:28:52,549
Quite a novel escape plan,
jumping headfirst into an exploding planet.

1125
01:28:57,638 --> 01:28:59,306
You'll kill us both!

1126
01:28:59,473 --> 01:29:00,849
Not both.

1127
01:29:16,991 --> 01:29:17,992
Why are we doing this?

1128
01:29:18,158 --> 01:29:20,577
Quill and Groot are inside.
We have to get them out.

1129
01:29:49,481 --> 01:29:50,482
Groot.

1130
01:30:07,333 --> 01:30:09,335
Whoever's in the cockpit, activate the brake.

1131
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:11,253
The steering mechanism is stuck.

1132
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:12,921
Well, pull harder!

1133
01:30:18,969 --> 01:30:19,845
Let's go. Come on.

1134
01:30:40,532 --> 01:30:41,867
It's hard to breathe.

1135
01:30:49,667 --> 01:30:51,710
We're entering space.

1136
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:19,446
Oh, piss off.

1137
01:31:28,455 --> 01:31:31,291
What kind of monster
slaughters a civilization?

1138
01:31:31,792 --> 01:31:32,793
Where are Mantis and Drax?

1139
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:33,961
I don't know!

1140
01:31:38,257 --> 01:31:39,425
- Gimme.
- Here.

1141
01:31:41,802 --> 01:31:42,845
You're lucky I was able to...

1142
01:31:43,012 --> 01:31:45,139
- knock down that door...
- Rocket and Gamora are probably dead...

1143
01:31:45,306 --> 01:31:46,307
because of you!

1144
01:31:46,473 --> 01:31:48,309
- I didn't know.
- Oh, you didn't know?

1145
01:31:48,475 --> 01:31:50,144
When are you gonna
stop using the excuse of...

1146
01:31:50,311 --> 01:31:52,980
being some big dumb clown
for contributing nothing...

1147
01:31:53,147 --> 01:31:55,316
and the rest of us having to
carry your slack!

1148
01:31:55,482 --> 01:31:56,692
Don't push him!

1149
01:31:56,859 --> 01:31:57,985
You don't have the right to push him.

1150
01:31:58,152 --> 01:31:59,862
And you! You're no better.

1151
01:32:00,029 --> 01:32:01,739
The only thing we can count on you for...

1152
01:32:01,905 --> 01:32:04,825
is when someone shows weakness,
you'll be right there to support it.

1153
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:06,285
Fine, I don't care.

1154
01:32:06,452 --> 01:32:10,164
I know you need to find fault in
everyone else to make yourself feel okay...

1155
01:32:10,331 --> 01:32:12,791
- so find it in me.
- Oh, go to hell, Mant!

1156
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:14,752
But you don't have the right to push him!

1157
01:32:15,252 --> 01:32:17,129
It's not his fault he's stupid.

1158
01:32:17,504 --> 01:32:18,339
He's a liability.

1159
01:32:18,505 --> 01:32:22,551
He makes us laugh and he loves us.
How is that a liability?

1160
01:32:23,344 --> 01:32:26,722
All you care about is
intelligence and competence.

1161
01:32:26,889 --> 01:32:28,849
Not sure I appreciate this defense.

1162
01:32:29,016 --> 01:32:30,351
He has sadness...

1163
01:32:30,517 --> 01:32:33,270
but he's the only one of you
who doesn't hate himself.

1164
01:32:33,771 --> 01:32:35,648
So I don't care if he's stupid.

1165
01:32:36,607 --> 01:32:37,900
You think I'm stupid?

1166
01:32:39,109 --> 01:32:40,277
Yes.

1167
01:32:43,864 --> 01:32:44,865
Forget.

1168
01:32:48,077 --> 01:32:51,246
You're lucky I was able to knock down
that door with my incredible strength.

1169
01:32:52,414 --> 01:32:53,499
Quill?

1170
01:32:53,666 --> 01:32:55,542
Quill? Quill, are you there?

1171
01:32:59,672 --> 01:33:02,049
That language isn't in my translator.

1172
01:33:12,685 --> 01:33:14,853
Okay. Here we go.

1173
01:33:36,291 --> 01:33:37,710
Okay. All right, Rocket.

1174
01:33:38,544 --> 01:33:39,545
Go.

1175
01:33:56,979 --> 01:33:58,272
Lylla?

1176
01:34:00,899 --> 01:34:02,192
Friend.

1177
01:34:05,237 --> 01:34:06,780
Okay, okay.

1178
01:34:06,947 --> 01:34:07,948
Okay, here we go.

1179
01:34:11,785 --> 01:34:12,786
This isn't right.

1180
01:34:13,662 --> 01:34:16,040
Yeah, no, no, no, it's good.
It's gonna work. It's working.

1181
01:34:16,206 --> 01:34:17,416
It needs to be faster.

1182
01:34:20,044 --> 01:34:22,713
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1183
01:34:24,923 --> 01:34:25,924
Rocket.

1184
01:34:26,091 --> 01:34:27,384
I let you down.

1185
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:31,889
I got you killed.
I got everybody killed.

1186
01:34:32,389 --> 01:34:33,766
We were right.

1187
01:34:34,391 --> 01:34:38,062
The sky is beautiful, and it is forever.

1188
01:34:38,646 --> 01:34:41,482
And I've been flying with our friends.

1189
01:34:54,995 --> 01:34:56,163
Can I come?

1190
01:34:56,705 --> 01:34:57,915
Yes.

1191
01:35:07,508 --> 01:35:08,509
No, no, no!

1192
01:35:09,009 --> 01:35:10,010
No!

1193
01:35:10,177 --> 01:35:11,178
Come on.

1194
01:35:11,971 --> 01:35:13,430
- Come on!
- Quill.

1195
01:35:16,350 --> 01:35:17,768
No!

1196
01:35:17,935 --> 01:35:20,229
No!

1197
01:35:22,439 --> 01:35:23,482
- Quill.
- No!

1198
01:35:24,525 --> 01:35:25,776
- Quill.
- I'm not gonna lose him.

1199
01:35:25,943 --> 01:35:26,944
He's gone.

1200
01:35:27,111 --> 01:35:29,822
I'm not letting him go!

1201
01:35:32,241 --> 01:35:33,242
Come on.

1202
01:35:46,088 --> 01:35:47,339
But not yet.

1203
01:35:48,465 --> 01:35:50,342
You still have a purpose here.

1204
01:35:50,968 --> 01:35:52,803
A purpose for what?

1205
01:35:53,304 --> 01:35:54,763
They made us for nothing.

1206
01:35:54,930 --> 01:35:57,516
Stupid experiments to be thrown away.

1207
01:35:58,684 --> 01:36:00,644
There are the hands that made us...

1208
01:36:00,811 --> 01:36:03,814
and then there are the hands
that guide the hands.

1209
01:36:11,196 --> 01:36:13,157
My beloved raccoon.

1210
01:36:14,158 --> 01:36:17,703
This story has been yours all along,
you just didn't know it.

1211
01:36:21,582 --> 01:36:22,875
I'm not a raccoon.

1212
01:36:30,632 --> 01:36:32,009
The passkey's going through!

1213
01:36:49,610 --> 01:36:50,611
Quill?

1214
01:37:10,005 --> 01:37:11,382
Where's Nebula?

1215
01:37:17,346 --> 01:37:18,847
She's...

1216
01:37:19,765 --> 01:37:22,059
Because her code is on the comm behind you.

1217
01:37:27,523 --> 01:37:28,774
What? Nebula?

1218
01:37:28,941 --> 01:37:30,818
- Where are you?
- Thank God!

1219
01:37:30,985 --> 01:37:32,194
We're here to get you out of here.

1220
01:37:32,361 --> 01:37:33,904
- Out of where?
- The High Evolutionary's ship.

1221
01:37:34,071 --> 01:37:35,531
No, I got off the ship.

1222
01:37:35,698 --> 01:37:36,949
- You what?
- Wait, where are you?

1223
01:37:37,116 --> 01:37:38,117
On the ship!

1224
01:37:38,283 --> 01:37:39,618
- On the ship?
- I didn't lie.

1225
01:37:39,785 --> 01:37:41,036
Why are you on the ship?

1226
01:37:41,203 --> 01:37:42,413
To save you obviously.

1227
01:37:42,579 --> 01:37:43,580
No, I told you to go back.

1228
01:37:43,747 --> 01:37:47,251
You gotta know by now I always figure out
an incredibly clever way to get out of a fix.

1229
01:37:47,418 --> 01:37:48,502
Tell him I said hi.

1230
01:37:48,669 --> 01:37:50,838
- Really?
- Tell him we're coming to save him.

1231
01:37:51,005 --> 01:37:52,715
Pay attention or play with the kids.

1232
01:37:52,881 --> 01:37:53,966
One or the other.

1233
01:37:54,133 --> 01:37:55,175
Play with the kids?

1234
01:37:55,342 --> 01:37:56,510
How did you get out?

1235
01:37:56,677 --> 01:37:57,636
That's not really important.

1236
01:37:57,803 --> 01:37:59,054
I am Groot.

1237
01:37:59,221 --> 01:38:01,598
Jumping a thousand feet to your death
without a parachute...

1238
01:38:01,765 --> 01:38:02,725
is a clever way...

1239
01:38:02,891 --> 01:38:04,435
of getting out of a fix?

1240
01:38:04,810 --> 01:38:06,770
You're all just makin' up
stuff that he's saying, right?

1241
01:38:07,187 --> 01:38:08,355
The important thing is...

1242
01:38:08,522 --> 01:38:09,940
we're all okay.

1243
01:38:13,193 --> 01:38:14,194
Rocket?

1244
01:38:15,279 --> 01:38:16,697
Yeah, he's here.

1245
01:38:16,864 --> 01:38:17,990
And he's okay.

1246
01:38:24,246 --> 01:38:28,334
Rocket, we love you very much,
and we're happy you're alive.

1247
01:38:28,959 --> 01:38:30,461
Well, that makes you the idiots then.

1248
01:38:30,627 --> 01:38:31,754
He's right about that.

1249
01:38:34,048 --> 01:38:35,299
Back in your cages!

1250
01:38:39,678 --> 01:38:40,679
Nebula?

1251
01:38:41,930 --> 01:38:43,307
Nebula, come in!

1252
01:38:48,771 --> 01:38:51,732
So, you'd like to joust, would you?

1253
01:38:53,734 --> 01:38:54,735
Go to hell...

1254
01:38:54,902 --> 01:38:56,236
you sick son of a bitch.

1255
01:38:56,403 --> 01:38:57,863
You killed all of those people.

1256
01:38:58,030 --> 01:38:59,865
As I will your friends.

1257
01:39:00,449 --> 01:39:02,493
I'm sending you the coordinates.

1258
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:05,162
They will die unless you bring me...

1259
01:39:05,329 --> 01:39:06,330
what is mine!

1260
01:39:06,497 --> 01:39:10,417
Screw you,
you stretch-faced, RoboCop-looking...

1261
01:39:10,584 --> 01:39:11,960
Skeletor wannabe...

1262
01:39:12,127 --> 01:39:14,129
purple-nurple piece of...

1263
01:39:17,299 --> 01:39:18,384
He hung up.

1264
01:39:21,220 --> 01:39:22,304
You think?

1265
01:39:25,599 --> 01:39:27,142
1966.

1266
01:39:27,309 --> 01:39:29,895
The Soviet put me on a rocket...

1267
01:39:30,062 --> 01:39:33,023
knowing full well I'm never to return
and I will die...

1268
01:39:33,190 --> 01:39:34,984
in a fiery ball of death.

1269
01:39:35,484 --> 01:39:38,195
But one thing even mudak Soviets
never do...

1270
01:39:38,362 --> 01:39:40,489
is call me bad dog.

1271
01:39:40,656 --> 01:39:42,992
Oh, my God!
Could you just let it go?

1272
01:39:43,158 --> 01:39:47,162
Kraglin, please, just take it back.
This is killing us.

1273
01:39:47,329 --> 01:39:50,124
I can't take it back if she is
in fact...

1274
01:39:50,624 --> 01:39:51,625
a bad dog.

1275
01:39:52,668 --> 01:39:55,170
- Kraglin!
- It never stops hurting.

1276
01:39:55,587 --> 01:39:56,797
Kraglin.

1277
01:39:57,464 --> 01:39:58,549
Oh, hey, Pete.

1278
01:39:58,716 --> 01:40:02,344
We need to save Nebula, Mantis, and Drax,
and we need your help.

1279
01:40:02,511 --> 01:40:03,679
Me?

1280
01:40:07,099 --> 01:40:08,892
You're the one who lost it, you twit.

1281
01:40:09,059 --> 01:40:11,103
The Hellspawn had it, sire, but...

1282
01:40:11,270 --> 01:40:12,229
But, but, but!

1283
01:40:12,396 --> 01:40:13,647
But!

1284
01:40:15,566 --> 01:40:17,318
That rancid word.

1285
01:40:20,446 --> 01:40:22,990
I'm merely wondering
whether it might be wiser...

1286
01:40:23,157 --> 01:40:26,160
to go directly to the new colony
and not engage in unnecessary conflict.

1287
01:40:26,327 --> 01:40:30,080
They can rewire a carbenetrix core
in under two minutes...

1288
01:40:30,247 --> 01:40:31,498
but what is that, Vim?

1289
01:40:32,333 --> 01:40:33,334
Rote memorization.

1290
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:35,252
Rote memorization!

1291
01:40:36,211 --> 01:40:38,047
In hundreds of years of our creations...

1292
01:40:38,213 --> 01:40:41,300
only one has known true invention.

1293
01:40:41,467 --> 01:40:42,468
One.

1294
01:40:44,261 --> 01:40:49,183
Putrid in every other way,
but 89P13 had that.

1295
01:40:52,061 --> 01:40:53,103
Yes, sire.

1296
01:40:54,104 --> 01:40:58,317
A populace unable to think
what hasn't yet been thought...

1297
01:40:58,484 --> 01:41:00,027
will die on the vine.

1298
01:41:00,194 --> 01:41:03,489
We need 89P13's brain...

1299
01:41:03,656 --> 01:41:07,034
so we can transfer that trait
into these creatures...

1300
01:41:07,201 --> 01:41:09,119
before we go to the new colony.

1301
01:41:09,286 --> 01:41:11,330
Nothing else matters.

1302
01:41:31,433 --> 01:41:32,893
How did they get down here?

1303
01:41:35,813 --> 01:41:38,065
Peter will be trying to get to the spaceport.

1304
01:41:38,691 --> 01:41:40,192
He doesn't know about the children.

1305
01:41:40,734 --> 01:41:41,735
You!

1306
01:41:42,945 --> 01:41:45,447
We need you to let all the other children
on board know...

1307
01:41:45,614 --> 01:41:47,241
to stay away from the starboard walls.

1308
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:51,161
They know three frickin' words...

1309
01:41:51,328 --> 01:41:52,746
and two of them are "joob".

1310
01:41:53,998 --> 01:41:55,958
No! Listen to me!

1311
01:41:56,667 --> 01:41:58,961
You need to talk to the other children...

1312
01:41:59,128 --> 01:42:01,755
all of them here, and tell them...

1313
01:42:01,922 --> 01:42:03,882
to stay away from the freaking...

1314
01:42:04,049 --> 01:42:05,551
What the hell are you doing, Mantis?

1315
01:42:05,718 --> 01:42:08,304
Explaining it, dickhead!

1316
01:42:19,273 --> 01:42:20,691
You're scaring them.

1317
01:42:26,739 --> 01:42:28,115
Hello, dumb idiots.

1318
01:42:32,661 --> 01:42:33,996
I had a little girl like you.

1319
01:42:34,705 --> 01:42:36,415
You know what she used to like?

1320
01:42:36,832 --> 01:42:38,834
She liked when I made monkey noises.

1321
01:42:49,511 --> 01:42:50,846
How is that a monkey?

1322
01:42:51,930 --> 01:42:53,057
Beats me.

1323
01:43:28,676 --> 01:43:29,677
Yeah.

1324
01:43:30,928 --> 01:43:32,012
Yeah.

1325
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:36,850
They're gonna tell the other kids
to stay away from the starboard wall.

1326
01:43:37,017 --> 01:43:39,895
Why didn't you tell us
you knew their language this whole time?

1327
01:43:40,270 --> 01:43:41,730
Why didn't you ask?

1328
01:43:44,191 --> 01:43:47,736
This could be futile, Quill.
He's too powerful.

1329
01:43:47,903 --> 01:43:49,613
Well, then I guess we'll die trying.

1330
01:43:49,780 --> 01:43:52,282
What is dying trying gonna accomplish?

1331
01:43:52,449 --> 01:43:53,909
Or we can just give him the badger?

1332
01:43:54,076 --> 01:43:56,620
Our thing is dying trying.

1333
01:43:56,787 --> 01:43:57,788
I am Groot.

1334
01:43:57,955 --> 01:43:59,540
I know who you are already!

1335
01:44:00,124 --> 01:44:02,334
Feel free to stay behind in the cargo area.

1336
01:44:02,501 --> 01:44:05,379
I'm not leaving my sister with that jackass.

1337
01:44:05,546 --> 01:44:06,755
This you?

1338
01:44:06,922 --> 01:44:08,465
Fell out of your bag.

1339
01:44:10,592 --> 01:44:11,802
Let's do this.

1340
01:44:48,756 --> 01:44:50,090
Wait.

1341
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:52,801
Wait.

1342
01:44:52,968 --> 01:44:56,347
<i>Reading some old letters,
you smile...</i>

1343
01:44:59,016 --> 01:45:01,226
You almost have to admire their pluck.

1344
01:45:02,353 --> 01:45:03,354
Sire.

1345
01:45:14,323 --> 01:45:16,408
Howdy there, you freakin' creep.

1346
01:45:20,954 --> 01:45:22,706
- Back up!
- Yes, sire.

1347
01:45:25,167 --> 01:45:26,502
You're on, Steemie.

1348
01:45:27,378 --> 01:45:28,462
First barrel.

1349
01:45:30,422 --> 01:45:31,632
Second barrel.

1350
01:45:32,758 --> 01:45:34,051
Third barrel.

1351
01:45:34,218 --> 01:45:35,386
Fourth barrel.

1352
01:45:43,894 --> 01:45:45,479
Hard starboard.

1353
01:45:45,646 --> 01:45:46,647
Hard starboard.

1354
01:45:52,820 --> 01:45:54,446
And fire!

1355
01:46:02,871 --> 01:46:04,081
They've breached the spaceport.

1356
01:46:04,248 --> 01:46:06,709
One of them holds subject 89P13.

1357
01:46:06,875 --> 01:46:08,419
Release the Hellspawn.
All of them.

1358
01:46:08,585 --> 01:46:11,380
Sire, the Hellspawn were created
solely to defend the new colony...

1359
01:46:11,547 --> 01:46:12,965
Do it now!

1360
01:46:13,132 --> 01:46:14,633
Get me 89P13...

1361
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:18,053
and kill everyone
in the head of that dead god.

1362
01:46:56,300 --> 01:46:57,926
Spaceport wide open, Cap'n...

1363
01:46:58,093 --> 01:46:59,678
but that old missile's all we had.

1364
01:46:59,845 --> 01:47:03,265
Rocket, Groot, go, go!
Get inside that spaceport.

1365
01:47:17,071 --> 01:47:18,280
What the hell?

1366
01:47:32,878 --> 01:47:34,755
Aw, come on!

1367
01:48:04,368 --> 01:48:06,662
Kraglin, we have been infiltrated.

1368
01:48:09,039 --> 01:48:10,290
Open the pit.

1369
01:48:10,457 --> 01:48:13,085
Sire, our bargaining power will be gone.

1370
01:48:38,277 --> 01:48:39,278
Abilisks!

1371
01:48:47,036 --> 01:48:48,245
Good God!

1372
01:48:54,793 --> 01:48:55,878
This way!

1373
01:50:01,819 --> 01:50:03,779
One more step and this weird thing gets it!

1374
01:50:03,946 --> 01:50:04,780
Don't be rash.

1375
01:50:23,757 --> 01:50:25,217
What were you programming?

1376
01:50:25,384 --> 01:50:26,635
A self-destruction code.

1377
01:50:44,653 --> 01:50:45,863
What are you doing?

1378
01:50:49,158 --> 01:50:50,159
It's okay.

1379
01:50:50,326 --> 01:50:51,493
Mantis, stop!

1380
01:50:53,871 --> 01:50:54,997
They eat batteries...

1381
01:50:55,164 --> 01:50:56,415
not people.

1382
01:50:57,916 --> 01:51:01,378
Maybe they're just scared
of what we are gonna do to them.

1383
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:09,928
We're not gonna hurt you.

1384
01:51:13,015 --> 01:51:15,017
Everything is going to be okay.

1385
01:52:10,656 --> 01:52:11,991
Use your heart, boy.

1386
01:53:03,375 --> 01:53:04,418
A dog!

1387
01:53:04,585 --> 01:53:05,794
Yeah.

1388
01:53:14,178 --> 01:53:16,180
She's a good dog.

1389
01:53:20,559 --> 01:53:22,686
I knew you believe I am good dog.

1390
01:53:22,853 --> 01:53:24,688
All right, all right, get off me, you idiot!

1391
01:53:28,609 --> 01:53:31,320
Sire, we must retreat.
The ship is going down.

1392
01:53:31,487 --> 01:53:33,072
The spaceport has intruders.

1393
01:53:33,364 --> 01:53:36,033
Go! See if one of them is 89P13.

1394
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:38,285
Sire, you have an irrational obsession
with this animal.

1395
01:53:38,452 --> 01:53:39,745
You must stop, for God's sake!

1396
01:53:39,912 --> 01:53:41,622
There is no God!

1397
01:53:41,789 --> 01:53:43,957
That's why I stepped in!

1398
01:54:12,528 --> 01:54:16,865
Controller, I am taking command of the Arête.

1399
01:54:17,032 --> 01:54:21,453
Disengage all damaged sectors of the ship...

1400
01:54:21,829 --> 01:54:23,706
and retreat.

1401
01:54:48,939 --> 01:54:49,940
Attention...

1402
01:54:50,107 --> 01:54:51,442
all personnel.

1403
01:54:52,735 --> 01:54:55,779
Intruders have boarded the ship.

1404
01:54:56,405 --> 01:54:58,907
Head to the starboard spaceport.

1405
01:55:01,368 --> 01:55:03,787
Get me 89P13...

1406
01:55:04,997 --> 01:55:06,457
and kill the rest.

1407
01:55:15,924 --> 01:55:17,426
We go in there, we get Mantis...

1408
01:55:17,593 --> 01:55:18,969
Nebula, and Drax.

1409
01:55:19,136 --> 01:55:22,014
We move in, we get 'em, and we get out.

1410
01:55:41,533 --> 01:55:42,910
Did that look cool?

1411
01:55:43,619 --> 01:55:47,331
Okay, new game plan.
We get the hell out of here now.

1412
01:55:47,498 --> 01:55:48,916
There are thousands of creatures on the ship.

1413
01:55:49,083 --> 01:55:50,459
Many of them are children.

1414
01:55:50,626 --> 01:55:51,919
And we need to be good joob joob.

1415
01:55:53,587 --> 01:55:54,797
It means friends.

1416
01:55:55,714 --> 01:55:58,133
If we wanna live, we have to leave now.

1417
01:55:58,676 --> 01:56:01,011
This whole rig is gonna go down any second.

1418
01:56:01,178 --> 01:56:03,514
They will all die if we don't help them.

1419
01:56:10,813 --> 01:56:12,606
I'm done runnin'.

1420
01:59:15,748 --> 01:59:17,207
There's a big hole up in the deck.

1421
01:59:17,374 --> 01:59:20,377
If we can connect that to Knowhere,
we can lead the survivors to safety.

1422
01:59:20,544 --> 01:59:24,506
Nebs and me will pilot the ship.
You guys save all the higher life forms.

1423
01:59:35,017 --> 01:59:36,018
Hello, moron.

1424
01:59:39,146 --> 01:59:40,147
Come on!

1425
01:59:42,066 --> 01:59:43,525
Follow me, come on! Come on!

1426
01:59:45,027 --> 01:59:45,903
Come on!

1427
01:59:46,987 --> 01:59:48,530
Go, go, go!

1428
01:59:50,282 --> 01:59:51,408
I am Groot!

1429
02:00:09,385 --> 02:00:10,844
This way to...

1430
02:00:11,637 --> 02:00:13,013
Thank you.

1431
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:15,307
Yes, you're welcome.
I was screaming at...

1432
02:00:15,474 --> 02:00:16,934
something scary behind you, not you.

1433
02:00:17,101 --> 02:00:19,436
You look really cool.

1434
02:00:24,358 --> 02:00:26,485
Kill me if you want,
but then good luck gettin' out of here.

1435
02:00:30,864 --> 02:00:31,865
- Wait!
- Let him go, Flecktick...

1436
02:00:32,032 --> 02:00:32,950
it's our only chance.

1437
02:00:33,117 --> 02:00:34,284
I got a space big enough to get through.

1438
02:00:34,451 --> 02:00:37,287
I gotta find out if I can change it
to a permeable shield.

1439
02:00:43,669 --> 02:00:45,045
I can't fly this frickin' thing...

1440
02:00:45,212 --> 02:00:46,964
the flight controls are all screwed.

1441
02:00:47,131 --> 02:00:48,257
I'll do it.

1442
02:00:48,424 --> 02:00:50,509
Go help the others.
Wait, give me your comm.

1443
02:00:58,851 --> 02:01:01,520
Kraglin, I'll pilot from this side.

1444
02:01:02,438 --> 02:01:03,439
Kragula...

1445
02:01:03,605 --> 02:01:05,566
back in action!

1446
02:01:31,717 --> 02:01:33,135
Come on, come on, come on!

1447
02:01:33,302 --> 02:01:34,303
Go, go!

1448
02:01:34,470 --> 02:01:35,846
Go, go, go!

1449
02:01:37,264 --> 02:01:38,265
Wait, wait, wait!

1450
02:01:38,432 --> 02:01:39,558
Stop, stop!

1451
02:01:39,725 --> 02:01:41,352
Are those kids?

1452
02:01:58,118 --> 02:01:59,578
Okay, Cosmo, stitch it up!

1453
02:01:59,745 --> 02:02:02,039
It needs to be airtight
for the kids to make it across.

1454
02:02:02,206 --> 02:02:03,916
Locking up, Kapitan.

1455
02:02:12,883 --> 02:02:14,510
Go, now, go!

1456
02:02:19,056 --> 02:02:20,933
One by one, one by one!

1457
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:22,393
Okay.

1458
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:30,776
Locking in and headed down.

1459
02:02:37,074 --> 02:02:38,826
This way. This way.

1460
02:02:42,538 --> 02:02:43,539
Why?

1461
02:02:45,624 --> 02:02:47,918
Why are you doing this?
I tried to kill you.

1462
02:02:48,794 --> 02:02:50,963
I am Groot.

1463
02:02:51,797 --> 02:02:52,881
He says...

1464
02:02:53,048 --> 02:02:55,092
everyone deserves a second chance.

1465
02:03:06,186 --> 02:03:08,439
You are so strong.

1466
02:03:13,152 --> 02:03:15,279
Why are you so slow? Hurry!

1467
02:03:16,447 --> 02:03:17,698
Where's Rocket?

1468
02:05:47,264 --> 02:05:48,265
You!

1469
02:05:49,850 --> 02:05:51,810
You thought you could escape me!

1470
02:05:52,645 --> 02:05:53,646
No!

1471
02:05:55,939 --> 02:05:59,693
You think you have some worth
in and of yourself, without me?

1472
02:05:59,860 --> 02:06:00,861
No!

1473
02:06:02,696 --> 02:06:04,239
You are an abomination!

1474
02:06:04,406 --> 02:06:07,576
Nothing more than a step on my path...

1475
02:06:07,743 --> 02:06:10,037
you freakish little monster!

1476
02:06:10,204 --> 02:06:12,289
How dare you think you are more...

1477
02:06:13,332 --> 02:06:16,919
89P13?

1478
02:06:20,381 --> 02:06:21,590
The name's Rocket.

1479
02:06:22,508 --> 02:06:24,885
Rocket Raccoon.

1480
02:07:05,050 --> 02:07:06,176
His face came off!

1481
02:07:06,677 --> 02:07:07,678
It's a mask.

1482
02:07:08,470 --> 02:07:09,471
Look...

1483
02:07:09,638 --> 02:07:11,932
what you did to me.

1484
02:07:12,766 --> 02:07:14,184
For what?

1485
02:07:14,351 --> 02:07:16,437
All I wanted to do...

1486
02:07:16,895 --> 02:07:18,564
was to make things...

1487
02:07:19,231 --> 02:07:20,316
perfect.

1488
02:07:21,191 --> 02:07:23,319
You didn't wanna make things perfect.

1489
02:07:23,485 --> 02:07:25,863
You just hated things the way they are.

1490
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:27,364
Kill him.

1491
02:07:34,038 --> 02:07:35,039
Why?

1492
02:07:35,831 --> 02:07:38,792
Because I'm a freaking
Guardian of the Galaxy.

1493
02:07:40,002 --> 02:07:42,338
We have to get outta here now.

1494
02:07:42,504 --> 02:07:43,464
We have to save them.

1495
02:07:43,630 --> 02:07:44,757
We've got all the kids on board.

1496
02:07:44,923 --> 02:07:45,799
No, Pete.

1497
02:07:46,592 --> 02:07:48,218
The rest of them.

1498
02:07:54,016 --> 02:07:56,143
Come on! Come on.

1499
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:57,645
Move!

1500
02:07:57,811 --> 02:07:59,271
Move it, bird!

1501
02:07:59,688 --> 02:08:01,065
Come on!

1502
02:08:04,652 --> 02:08:05,653
Come on!

1503
02:08:06,278 --> 02:08:07,279
Come on, come on, come on!

1504
02:08:10,741 --> 02:08:12,951
Thought we were limiting ourselves
to the higher life forms?

1505
02:08:13,118 --> 02:08:15,037
Yeah, well, me too.

1506
02:08:15,204 --> 02:08:17,331
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1507
02:08:23,337 --> 02:08:24,421
Go, babies.

1508
02:08:24,588 --> 02:08:25,714
Go, babies.

1509
02:08:25,881 --> 02:08:27,341
Go!

1510
02:08:27,508 --> 02:08:29,677
I cannot hold much...

1511
02:08:36,433 --> 02:08:37,434
Run!

1512
02:08:37,601 --> 02:08:38,727
Go! Go!

1513
02:08:50,239 --> 02:08:51,198
Quill!

1514
02:08:51,365 --> 02:08:52,408
Hurry!

1515
02:09:35,492 --> 02:09:37,953
Peter!

1516
02:10:45,562 --> 02:10:46,563
Peter!

1517
02:10:51,735 --> 02:10:53,654
Did that...

1518
02:10:53,821 --> 02:10:55,280
look...

1519
02:10:55,990 --> 02:10:57,282
cool?

1520
02:11:00,577 --> 02:11:01,453
Come on.

1521
02:11:14,008 --> 02:11:16,635
Cosmo! I'm okay.

1522
02:11:54,506 --> 02:11:55,966
I am Groot.

1523
02:11:56,634 --> 02:11:59,011
Thanks.
Just tell them I'm gonna be right...

1524
02:12:04,642 --> 02:12:06,018
I am Groot.

1525
02:12:07,895 --> 02:12:10,606
Yeah.
It was good working with you too.

1526
02:12:18,447 --> 02:12:19,448
Hey, Gamora.

1527
02:12:19,907 --> 02:12:20,908
Are you ready?

1528
02:12:21,575 --> 02:12:22,701
Yeah.

1529
02:12:28,916 --> 02:12:30,542
You know, I'm still not
who you want me to be.

1530
02:12:32,544 --> 02:12:33,545
I know.

1531
02:12:34,922 --> 02:12:37,049
But who you are ain't so bad.

1532
02:12:56,986 --> 02:12:58,696
I bet we were fun.

1533
02:13:03,951 --> 02:13:05,703
Like you wouldn't believe.

1534
02:13:12,251 --> 02:13:13,293
Okay.

1535
02:13:27,224 --> 02:13:28,642
You okay?

1536
02:13:30,561 --> 02:13:32,730
I think I need to talk to everybody.

1537
02:13:34,815 --> 02:13:37,026
So, you're gonna leave?

1538
02:13:38,694 --> 02:13:40,654
My mother died in front of me
when I was eight years old...

1539
02:13:40,821 --> 02:13:42,948
and I have been running ever since.

1540
02:13:44,158 --> 02:13:46,160
I'm gonna need to take some time...

1541
02:13:48,245 --> 02:13:49,747
and learn how to swim.

1542
02:13:52,583 --> 02:13:53,584
I as well.

1543
02:13:58,172 --> 02:14:01,050
I love you all. I do.

1544
02:14:05,220 --> 02:14:08,349
But my whole life
I did whatever Ego wanted...

1545
02:14:08,891 --> 02:14:11,685
and then, I did
whatever the Guardians wanted.

1546
02:14:12,436 --> 02:14:15,689
I need to go out and discover what I want.

1547
02:14:15,856 --> 02:14:16,815
I'll come with you.

1548
02:14:16,982 --> 02:14:19,360
No, Drax. That's the whole point.

1549
02:14:19,526 --> 02:14:20,861
But you need someone to protect you.

1550
02:14:21,028 --> 02:14:23,030
- I don't.
- Not in a bad way.

1551
02:14:23,197 --> 02:14:24,573
Just because of your incredible weakness.

1552
02:14:24,740 --> 02:14:26,283
Oh, my gosh, you're so frustrating!

1553
02:14:26,450 --> 02:14:27,451
Drax.

1554
02:14:28,118 --> 02:14:29,286
I need you here.

1555
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:31,580
We're building a new society.

1556
02:14:32,247 --> 02:14:34,875
I need all the support I can get
for those children out there.

1557
02:14:36,085 --> 02:14:38,671
Today, I saw who you are.

1558
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:41,674
You weren't born to be a destroyer.

1559
02:14:43,634 --> 02:14:45,010
You were born to be a dad.

1560
02:14:49,556 --> 02:14:51,517
So, you'll lead the Guardians then?

1561
02:14:52,142 --> 02:14:53,143
No.

1562
02:14:53,727 --> 02:14:55,229
I'm gonna lead the city...

1563
02:14:55,980 --> 02:14:57,731
make it the type of home I never had.

1564
02:15:00,484 --> 02:15:01,777
So, that's it?

1565
02:15:03,278 --> 02:15:04,738
The group's over?

1566
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:06,448
No.

1567
02:15:06,740 --> 02:15:08,909
Well, the Galaxy still needs its Guardians.

1568
02:15:10,119 --> 02:15:12,871
And you will make a better leader
than I ever was...

1569
02:15:13,706 --> 02:15:14,707
Cap'n.

1570
02:15:35,144 --> 02:15:36,895
I love you, guys.

1571
02:15:44,945 --> 02:15:46,030
For you.

1572
02:17:42,229 --> 02:17:43,480
Yeah!

1573
02:17:43,647 --> 02:17:44,898
Oh, yeah!

1574
02:17:50,070 --> 02:17:51,488
Welcome home.

1575
02:18:39,745 --> 02:18:41,287
I think I might be at the wrong...

1576
02:18:43,123 --> 02:18:44,625
I'm looking for Jason Quill.

1577
02:18:44,792 --> 02:18:45,959
Yes.

1578
02:18:46,418 --> 02:18:47,670
Come in.

1579
02:19:05,854 --> 02:19:06,855
Pete?

1580
02:19:13,277 --> 02:19:14,278
Pete.

1581
02:19:18,866 --> 02:19:20,118
Hi, Grandpa.

1582
02:19:49,023 --> 02:19:52,026
Yes! Yes! Yeah! Yeah!

1583
02:19:56,071 --> 02:19:57,281
Yeah!

1584
02:19:57,448 --> 02:19:59,033
Yeah!

1585
02:21:23,492 --> 02:21:25,327
Okay, how about your favorite musical act?

1586
02:21:25,953 --> 02:21:27,037
Phyla, you first.

1587
02:21:28,747 --> 02:21:31,583
Britney Spears and Korn.

1588
02:21:32,001 --> 02:21:33,002
Good choices.

1589
02:21:33,168 --> 02:21:35,796
I gotta go with the man.
Garth Brooks.

1590
02:21:35,963 --> 02:21:39,091
The Carpenters do not have a single bad song.

1591
02:21:39,258 --> 02:21:40,467
Adrian Belew.

1592
02:21:40,759 --> 02:21:44,013
Both solo and his work with King Crimson.

1593
02:21:44,763 --> 02:21:46,348
What about you, Captain?

1594
02:21:46,515 --> 02:21:48,058
This one's kind of special.

1595
02:22:06,035 --> 02:22:07,494
Guess they're here.

1596
02:22:07,661 --> 02:22:11,415
Well, I can handle this by my lonesome...

1597
02:22:11,582 --> 02:22:13,167
if y'all wanna chill.

1598
02:22:13,334 --> 02:22:14,335
Nah, nah.

1599
02:22:14,501 --> 02:22:17,921
It'll go faster if we all do it together.
Groot, wake up.

1600
02:22:29,224 --> 02:22:31,018
Do you ever feel a little sad for them?

1601
02:22:31,185 --> 02:22:34,313
Yeah, sure.
But these townsfolk can't protect themselves.

1602
02:22:35,064 --> 02:22:36,732
On your word, Kapitan.

1603
02:22:46,617 --> 02:22:47,618
Word.

1604
02:29:14,338 --> 02:29:16,340
I mean, if she needs help mowing her lawn,
I'll do it...

1605
02:29:16,507 --> 02:29:18,175
but I kinda feel like her son should help.

1606
02:29:18,759 --> 02:29:20,970
He's gonna sit on the porch
and watch me do it.

1607
02:29:21,261 --> 02:29:23,055
Like, he's a 45-year-old man...

1608
02:29:23,222 --> 02:29:25,057
able-bodied, and I'm mowing his lawn.

1609
02:29:25,224 --> 02:29:26,392
It just feels weird.

1610
02:29:26,558 --> 02:29:27,977
Don't get me started.

1611
02:29:29,728 --> 02:29:30,729
Oh, really?

1612
02:29:32,439 --> 02:29:33,732
Now I kind of want to know.
