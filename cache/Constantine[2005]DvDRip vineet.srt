1
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,399
Manuel.

2
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,439
Manuel!

3
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,718
Manuel.

4
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,951
I think...

5
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,154
I think I found you one.

6
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,470
Look, I called you, right?

7
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,593
Soon as I couldn't pull it out myself,
I called you, John.

8
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,868
It's okay, it's okay.
We had to tie her down, okay?

9
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,838
It's okay.

10
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,434
This is Constantine.

11
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,515
John Constantine, asshole.

12
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,631
Sure.

13
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,832
What the hell?

14
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,034
I need a mirror.

15
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,192
Now. At least 3 feet high.

16
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,920
Move! Go, now!

17
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,157
This is Kramer.

18
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,553
Chas Kramer, asshole.

19
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,358
Asshole.

20
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,514
What? Oh, this is Kramer.
Chas Kramer, asshole.

21
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,716
- Chas!
- What?

22
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,519
- Move the car.
- Why?

23
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,356
Move the damn car!

24
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,599
"Chas, move the car. "

25
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,994
There, car's moved.

26
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,591
Lift it up over the bed.

27
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,433
Tie that end off.
Hennessy, over the top.

28
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,840
Close your eyes.
And whatever happens, don't look.

29
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,311
No!

30
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,355
Show yourself.

31
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,236
Smile pretty, you vain prick.

32
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,670
For your boss.

33
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,679
Pull it!

34
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,911
Ma? Ma?

35
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,633
Like I said, I found you something,
didn't I, John? Didn't I?

36
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,398
What happened in there?

37
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,676
Going to a lot of meetings, I see.

38
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,876
Keeps the voices out so I can sleep.

39
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,356
I have to sleep, John.

40
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,434
I need some help, Father.

41
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,639
You do?

42
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,479
From me?

43
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,278
What kind of...?

44
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,433
- Hey, listen, I...
- That exorcism wasn't right.

45
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,072
Listen to the ether.

46
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,476
Anything unusual, you let me know.

47
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,790
Come on, you don't need its protection.
It'll be like back in the day.

48
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,951
A few days.

49
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,394
Okay.

50
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,836
Okay. For you, John.

51
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,510
John, why would you do that
if you know it's not my car?

52
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,154
- I told you to move it.
- You did tell me to move it...

53
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,676
...but if you'd said you were dropping
a 300-pound mirror with a demon...

54
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,592
...I would've moved it further, John.

55
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,270
- Take Alvarado.
- Yeah, thank you. I know what to take.

56
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,109
You ever think if you told me more now
that maybe I could help out?

57
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,554
- No?
- Nope.

58
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,994
Nope?

59
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,151
Of course it's a nope.

60
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,238
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

61
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,278
<i>It's been...</i>

62
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,318
<i>...two weeks since my last confession.</i>

63
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,635
I killed a man today.

64
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,312
Another one.

65
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,350
I didn't even see his face, I just...

66
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,629
...pulled the trigger, and he went away.

67
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:47,716
<i>Most cops go 20 years
without firing their guns.</i>

68
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,754
<i>Why do I always know
where these guys are?</i>

69
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,117
<i>Where to aim, when to fire.</i>

70
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,513
<i>I'm wondering, is there
something wrong with me, Father?</i>

71
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,232
<i>Something damned?</i>

72
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,520
<i>God has a plan for you.
He has a plan for us all.</i>

73
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,913
<i>You mustn't let your faith
be overshadowed by guilt.</i>

74
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,036
<i>Yeah, I'm trying.</i>

75
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,149
<i>I'm trying real hard.</i>

76
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,954
<i>Isabel.</i>

77
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,996
<i>Isabel.</i>

78
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,510
Things I've beaten.

79
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,236
Things most people never even heard of.

80
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,671
And now I'm gonna be done in by this.

81
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,990
Wouldn't be the first, John.

82
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,756
Come on, Les.

83
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,150
You saved me before,
you can do it again, right?

84
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,073
This is aggressive.

85
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,153
Twenty years ago,
you didn't wanna be here.

86
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,195
Now you don't wanna leave.

87
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,910
Yeah, that's a good idea.

88
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,671
John, you really need to prepare.

89
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,915
- Make arrangements.
- No need.

90
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,112
I already know exactly where I'm going.

91
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,837
- Morning.
- Good morning.

92
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,835
- Good morning.
- Detective.

93
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,752
- No, no, no.
- Angela, wait.

94
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,480
You don't need to see this, okay? No.

95
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,039
Give us the room, please.

96
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,951
Isabel.

97
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,595
She fell from the roof?

98
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,512
She jumped.

99
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,119
- No.
- Look...

100
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,273
...I know it's hard to accept.
She was sick.

101
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,830
- Isabel wouldn't kill herself.
- Angie.

102
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,431
- She wouldn't kill herself.
- Detective.

103
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,874
- Period.
- Detective.

104
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,598
Period!

105
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,148
Angie, there were security cameras.

106
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,437
- Hold the door. You going down?
- Not if I can help it.

107
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,593
A new case?

108
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:29,279
The big score? The mother lode?
The one you've been waiting for?

109
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,353
- Humor me.
- Don't I always?

110
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,590
Oh, yeah, that's...
Much obliged. Thank you.

111
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,152
How you feeling, John?

112
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,913
So, what's new?

113
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,635
Bullet shavings from
the assassination attempt on the pope...

114
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,270
...holy-water ampoules
from the River Jordan...

115
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,150
...and... Oh, you'll love this.
- Screech beetle from Amityville.

116
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,154
Yeah, it's funny to you, but to the
fallen, that's like nails on a chalkboard.

117
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,312
What is it, exactly, with you and bugs?

118
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,270
I just like them.

119
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,237
Yeah. Who doesn't?

120
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,276
Yeah, easy there, hero.

121
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,876
- That's dragon's breath.
- I thought you couldn't get it anymore.

122
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,636
Yeah, well, I know a guy
who knows a guy.

123
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,996
So, what's the action?

124
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,069
I just pulled a soldier demon
out of a little girl.

125
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,199
Looked like it was trying
to come through.

126
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,114
Yeah, I know how it sounds.

127
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,475
No, we're finger puppets
to them, John...

128
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,959
...not doorways.

129
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,033
They can work us, but they can't
come through onto our plane.

130
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,714
Check the scrolls anyway.
See if there's any precedent.

131
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,711
Sure thing, John.

132
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,352
Anything else?

133
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,432
Wouldn't happen to have
anything for a...?

134
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,314
On the house.

135
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,669
All right, question. How much longer
do I have to be your slave, John?

136
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,596
You're not my slave, Chas.

137
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,312
You're my very appreciated apprentice.

138
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,550
Like Tonto or Robin.

139
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,309
Or that skinny fellow
with the fat friend.

140
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,189
Right. So then why don't I apprentice
something besides driving, then, John?

141
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,598
John? John.

142
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,360
I love our little talks, John.

143
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,152
May I take your coat, Mr. Constantine?

144
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,993
No, thanks,
I'm not gonna be staying long.

145
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,551
- How about you, ma'am?
- Oh, no, I'm not staying long either.

146
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,115
I really need to speak with him.
It's important.

147
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,874
First come, first served.

148
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,872
So you're rude no matter where you are.

149
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,037
- Father.
- Hi.

150
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,157
- You have news. Yes.
- Yes, I spoke with the bishop.

151
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,474
I know what you want, son.

152
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,030
Still keeping your all-seeing eye
on me, Gabriel?

153
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,471
I'm flattered.

154
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,756
Well, I could offer something...

155
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,993
...about how a shepherd leads
even the most wayward of his flock...

156
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,151
...but it might sound disingenuous.

157
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,959
She has to have a Catholic funeral,
Father. She has to.

158
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,159
- Angela, it's still considered a mortal sin.
- She didn't commit suicide.

159
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,834
The bishop believes otherwise.
You know the rules.

160
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,991
Oh, rules.

161
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,912
Father.

162
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,594
David.

163
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,031
This is Isabel.

164
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,795
God was the only one
she ever believed loved her.

165
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,312
Please.

166
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,792
I'm sorry.

167
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,870
I've been seeing some unusual
soul traffic lately.

168
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,679
You might consider
giving me an extension.

169
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,308
I could do your side some good
these days.

170
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,630
You still trying to buy your way
into heaven?

171
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,392
What about the minions I've sent back?

172
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,553
- That alone should guarantee my entry.
- How many times have I told you?

173
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,631
That's not the way this works.

174
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,394
Why, haven't I served him enough?

175
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,158
- What does he want from me?
- Only the usual.

176
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,278
Self-sacrifice, belief.

177
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,512
- Oh, I believe, for chrissake.
- No, no, you know.

178
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,830
And there's a difference. You've seen.

179
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,471
I never asked to see.
I was born with this curse.

180
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,631
A gift, John.

181
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,189
One that you've squandered
on selfish endeavors.

182
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,750
I'm pulling demons out of little girls.

183
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,672
Who's that for?

184
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,189
Everything you've ever done,
you've only ever done for yourself.

185
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,510
To earn your way
back into his good graces.

186
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,194
Impossible rules, endless regulations...

187
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,319
...who goes up, who goes down
and why.

188
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,119
You don't even understand us.

189
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,274
You're the one who should go
to hell, half-breed.

190
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,397
Why me, Gabriel?

191
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,069
It's personal, isn't it?

192
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,720
I didn't go to church enough,
I didn't pray enough...

193
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,158
...I was 5 bucks short
in the collection plate. Why?

194
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,719
You are going to die young...

195
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,634
...because you smoked 30 cigarettes
a day since you were 15.

196
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,549
And you're going to go to hell...

197
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,639
...because of the life you took.

198
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,232
You're fucked.

199
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,715
At least it's nice out.

200
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,351
He always had a rotten sense of humor.

201
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,197
And his punch lines are killers.

202
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,553
John!

203
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,709
Constantine, it's raining! John! Hey!

204
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,235
<i>Twenty-two women were found buried
in the assailant's back yard.</i>

205
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,949
<i>So much damage had been done
to the bodies, police had to match...</i>

206
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,475
<i>Police report she had been
physically penetrated...</i>

207
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,279
<i>...over 100 times and buried alive.</i>

208
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,035
<i>- Found locked in a storage freezer,
his head severed and his organs...</i>

209
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,918
<i>He stuffed Holly's body into...</i>

210
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,914
<i>- The bodies ravished by the unknown...
- He used a small handsaw...</i>

211
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,390
<i>Had nearly decapitated...
Even his eyes were gouged out.</i>

212
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,152
<i>Isabel.</i>

213
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,156
I'm so sorry, Izzy.

214
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,312
<i>Constantine.</i>

215
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,837
Dodson.

216
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,712
Hello?

217
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,072
Hello.

218
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,032
Hello?

219
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,798
Hey. Hey, buddy, got a light?

220
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,514
Should've minded
your own business, exorcist.

221
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,633
I know where you're going, John.
You're going to Midnite's.

222
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,392
You're supposed to wait in the cab.

223
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,189
It's a haven for those who rise and fall.
I remember reading about this, John.

224
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,999
- You read too much, kid. It's a bar.
- It's a bar?

225
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:11,358
It's a bar. Papa Midnite is a crusader for
good. He swore the oath of neutrality.

226
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,034
- John, the man's a legend.
- Yeah.

227
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,589
Can you please get me
into this bar, John, please?

228
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,239
I'm begging you, John, please?

229
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,435
- Sure, you can get in.
- I can get in?

230
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,716
If you can get in.

231
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,994
If I can get...? It's a bear, though, right?
Or two ducks in a cloud?

232
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,512
Two frogs on a bench.

233
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,558
Two frogs on a bench.

234
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,631
No, no, I'm with the guy you just...

235
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,597
John! John!

236
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,671
I'm with him, though.

237
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,637
Rat in a dress.

238
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,034
Of course it is. Rat in a dress.

239
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,077
I'm just testing. I'm just testing.

240
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,912
Don't get up.

241
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,434
You've been absent some time.

242
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,473
Have you come here with relics to sell?

243
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,912
No, I'm out of that now.
I've been too busy.

244
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,797
Perhaps peddling forgeries has ended up
being bad for your health.

245
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,837
Midnite, Jesus...

246
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,276
...I thought the thing was authentic.

247
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,712
I see now.

248
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,077
Your health is bad for other reasons.
How long?

249
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,958
A few months, maybe a year.

250
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,680
I thought I heard thunder last night.

251
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,832
Must have been
Satan's stomach growling.

252
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,959
You're the one soul he'd come
up here himself to collect.

253
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,350
So I've heard.

254
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,680
Well, I am most certain
you did not come here...

255
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,877
...for a sympathetic shoulder
to cry on.

256
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,710
A demon just attacked me,
right out in the open on Figueroa.

257
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,036
They don't like you, John.

258
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,997
How many have you
deported back to hell?

259
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,517
Not some angry half-breed, Midnite.
A full-fledged demon, here, on our plane.

260
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,319
Clearly I do not have to remind you
that is impossible.

261
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,710
And yesterday I saw a soldier demon...

262
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,269
...trying to chew its way out
through a little girl.

263
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,991
Listen, John, demons stay in hell,
angels in heaven...

264
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,594
...the great détente
of the original superpowers.

265
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:10,476
Thanks for the history lesson, Midnite.
You've been a tremendous help.

266
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,153
Now...

267
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,639
...I need to use the chair.

268
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,111
John, forgetting the fact that it would
almost certainly kill you...

269
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,918
...you know I am neutral.

270
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,153
And as long as the balance
is maintained, I take no sides.

271
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,791
Before you were a bartender...

272
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,148
...you were one witch doctor
against, what, 30 Ashgar?

273
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,878
- And I...
- You were Constantine.

274
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,273
The John Constantine.

275
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,632
Once.

276
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,196
This isn't the usual game, I can feel it.

277
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,669
Something's coming.

278
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,357
Spooky.

279
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,278
Balthazar.

280
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,353
That expression alone
has made my entire night.

281
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,393
I'll make your night.

282
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,109
I'll deport your sorry ass right where
you stand, you half-breed shit!

283
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,350
You know the rules of my house.
While here, you will abide by them.

284
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,397
Johnny boy.

285
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,799
Word is you're on your way down.

286
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,076
Fresh meat.

287
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,470
Finger-licking good.

288
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,552
We have a meeting now, John.

289
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,430
What? I didn't catch that.

290
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,355
Welcome to my life.

291
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,794
Mr. Constantine.

292
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,150
- I saw you...
- I remember.

293
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,638
- And then I saw you at the...
- Regular kismet.

294
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,156
I'd like to ask you a few questions,
if that would be okay.

295
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,278
I'm not really in the talking mood
right now.

296
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,989
Well, maybe you could just listen then.

297
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,192
Please?

298
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,758
Always a catch.

299
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,594
My sister was murdered yesterday.

300
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,593
- Sorry to hear.
- Thanks.

301
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,636
She was a patient at Ravenscar.
She jumped off the roof.

302
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,157
Thought you said she was murdered.

303
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,198
Yeah, well, Isabel wouldn't
have taken her own life.

304
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,875
Yeah, what kind of mental patient
kills herself?

305
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,830
That's just crazy.

306
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,388
Look, I've heard your name
around the precinct.

307
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,554
I know the circles you travel in.
The occult, demonology, exorcisms.

308
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,190
Just before my sister was committed,
she became deeply paranoid.

309
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,876
She started talking about demons,
angels.

310
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,679
Now, I think someone got to her,
Mr. Constantine.

311
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,469
I think they brainwashed her
into stepping off that roof.

312
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,918
Some kind of legion or cult.

313
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,919
Sounds like a theory, detective.

314
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,433
Good luck.

315
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,114
I thought with your background,
you could at least...

316
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,872
...point me in the right direction.

317
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,270
Yeah, okay, sure.

318
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,391
It wasn't a suicide.

319
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,630
My sister was a devout Catholic.

320
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,189
Do you understand that?
If she took her own life...

321
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,033
Her soul would go straight to hell...

322
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:43,115
...where she'd be ripped apart over
and over in screaming, brutal agony...

323
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,397
...for all eternity. That it?

324
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,516
That about right?

325
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,236
Goddamn you.

326
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,753
Detective.

327
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,639
What if I told you that God
and the devil made a wager...

328
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,156
...a kind of standing bet
for the souls of all mankind?

329
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,709
I'd tell you to stay on your meds.

330
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,998
Humor me. No direct contact with
humans. That would be the rule.

331
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,359
- Just influence. See who would win.
- Okay, I'm humoring you.

332
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,511
- Why?
- Who knows.

333
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,638
- Maybe just for the fun of it. No telling.
- Oh, so it's fun.

334
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,590
It's fun when a man beats his wife to
death, when a mother drowns her baby.

335
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,355
And you think the devil is responsible?

336
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,159
People are evil, Mr. Constantine. People.

337
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,630
You're right. We're born
capable of terrible things.

338
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,395
Then sometimes something else comes
along and gives us just the right nudge.

339
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,870
Well, this has been real educational...

340
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,678
...but I don't believe in the devil.

341
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,150
You should. He believes in you.

342
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,596
It's a power outage.

343
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,637
Not likely.

344
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,436
- What?
- We should go. Now.

345
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,271
What is that?

346
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,992
Wings.

347
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,795
Maybe talons.

348
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,714
You're kidding. Of what?

349
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,558
Something that's not
supposed to be here.

350
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,834
That's really not going to help.

351
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,800
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

352
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,234
Suit yourself.

353
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,837
Demons stay in hell, huh?

354
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,111
Tell them that.

355
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,836
Don't worry. Happens to everyone
the first time.

356
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,036
It's the sulfur.

357
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,511
Sulfur.

358
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,949
What were those things?

359
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,878
Demons.

360
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,832
- Scavengers of the damned.
- No, no. It's impossible.

361
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,629
Yeah. And I don't think
they were after me.

362
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,592
You really believe
she wouldn't commit suicide.

363
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,113
Isabel?

364
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,871
Never in a million years.

365
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,231
Well, let's be sure.

366
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,829
Let's see if she's in hell.

367
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,390
Oh, was it supposed to be hot or cold?

368
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,910
In front of the chair.

369
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,432
I can't believe I'm doing this.

370
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,114
- These are all Isabel's things?
- Yeah.

371
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,032
- How about the cat?
- Duck?

372
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,711
Yeah, why?

373
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,994
Duck.

374
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,390
Oh, you think that's strange.

375
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,959
Cats are good.

376
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,678
Half in, half out anyway.

377
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,312
If this is some kind of spell
or something...

378
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,517
...don't you need candles
and a pentagram for it to work?

379
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,910
Why, do you have any?

380
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,033
- This is crazy.
- Yes.

381
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,675
I need you to leave.

382
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,199
- I'm sorry?
- Angela, please.

383
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,231
The apartment.

384
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,912
Okay.

385
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,434
Be careful with that cat.

386
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,994
God, I hate this part.

387
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,473
- Isabel.
- Constantine.

388
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,513
Angela.

389
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,319
Jesus.

390
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,032
- Constantine, what...?
- Twins.

391
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,031
Jesus. What?

392
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,309
- You were twins.
- What did you say?

393
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,040
- She killed herself.
- What?

394
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,634
And she's damned for it.

395
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,752
How is this possible?

396
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,952
I need to eat.

397
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,669
Hey! Hey, what are you doing in here?

398
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,392
Relax, man.

399
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,712
Slow down!

400
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,798
What the hell kind of place is this?

401
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,038
John.

402
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,949
When I was a kid, I could see things.

403
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,396
Things humans aren't supposed to see.

404
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,673
<i>Things you shouldn't have to see.</i>

405
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:58,678
My parents were normal.
They did what most parents would do.

406
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,235
<i>They made it worse.</i>

407
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,273
You think you're crazy long enough...

408
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,994
...you find a way out.

409
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,075
<i>- You tried to kill yourself.
- I didn't try anything.</i>

410
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,678
<i>Officially, I was dead for two minutes.</i>

411
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,829
But when you cross over...

412
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,190
...time stops.

413
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,313
Take it from me,
two minutes in hell is a lifetime.

414
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,355
When I came back...

415
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,918
...I knew...

416
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,879
...all the things I could see were real.

417
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:46,075
Heaven and hell are right here.
Behind every wall, every window.

418
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:51,030
The world behind the world,
and we're smack in the middle.

419
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,590
Angels and demons can't
cross over onto our plane.

420
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,558
So instead we get
what I call half-breeds.

421
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,790
<i>The influence peddlers.</i>

422
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,193
<i>They can only whisper in our ears, but
a single word can give you courage...</i>

423
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:10,239
<i>...or turn your favorite pleasure
into your worst nightmare.</i>

424
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,312
<i>Those with the demon's touch...</i>

425
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:18,315
<i>...like those part angel,
living alongside us.</i>

426
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,869
They call it the balance.

427
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,272
I call it hypocritical bullshit.

428
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,228
So when a half-breed breaks the rules...

429
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,508
...I deport their sorry ass
straight back to hell.

430
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,634
I don't get them all...

431
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,911
...but I've been hoping to get enough
to ensure my...

432
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,758
...retirement.
- I don't understand.

433
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,756
I'm a suicide, Angela.

434
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,310
When I die, the rules say
I've got just one place to go.

435
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,436
You're trying to buy your way
into heaven.

436
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,034
What would you do
if you were sentenced to a prison...

437
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,430
...where half the inmates
were put there by you?

438
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,154
I guess God has a plan for all of us.

439
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,552
God's a kid with an ant farm, lady.

440
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,676
He's not planning anything.

441
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,951
When we were little...

442
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,388
...Isabel saw things too.

443
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,953
Dodson.

444
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,796
Guard spotted him groping the body,
then he ran across the street.

445
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,918
Came in here, and he had a go
at the entire stock.

446
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,197
He drowned himself in alcohol
in under a minute.

447
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,274
Could've been a member
of my fraternity.

448
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,517
Hey, what the hell is he doing here?

449
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,233
He's okay.

450
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,790
Why didn't you call me,
you son of a bitch?

451
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,678
Yes?

452
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,352
What do you mean?

453
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,673
What?

454
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,319
How?

455
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,352
Got it. Bye.

456
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,478
I need to see where Isabel died.

457
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,677
<i>Séances, Ouija boards, channeling.</i>

458
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,716
Our father thought she was
just trying to get attention.

459
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,315
She certainly did that.

460
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,876
She'd tell everyone about the things
she said she saw.

461
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,589
She'd scare my mother half to death.

462
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,880
And then she stopped talking
for almost a year.

463
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,190
So you had her committed.

464
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,634
Yeah.

465
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,392
How long?

466
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,398
Two weeks.

467
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,552
This time.

468
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,111
She'd get better, and then she'd
get worse. Recently, a lot worse.

469
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,510
That symbol that was cut
in the dead guy's hand...

470
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,875
...does it have something to do
with this?

471
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,350
I'm a cop, John, remember?

472
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,275
You don't walk off the roof of a building
without leaving something behind.

473
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:55,116
And I showed you everything
she left behind in that box, but feel free.

474
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,400
Maybe she left something else.
Not something a cop would find.

475
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,592
Something just for you.

476
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,079
You were her twin, Angela.
Twins tend to think alike.

477
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,437
- I'm not like my sister.
- But you were once.

478
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,716
When you were kids.

479
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:17,679
When you'd spend every second
with each other.

480
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,435
You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it.
You'd get hurt, she'd cry.

481
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,999
That was a long time ago.

482
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,037
That kind of bond doesn't
just disappear.

483
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,191
There is nothing here.

484
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,797
- Hey. Come on.
- She planned her death in this room.

485
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,236
She thought it up right here.
Right where you're standing.

486
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,517
She knew you'd come. She counted
on you to see what she saw...

487
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,592
...feel what she felt,
know what she knew.

488
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,474
- What did she do, Angela?
- How should I know?

489
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,949
- What did she do, Angela?
- I don't know.

490
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,272
- What would you do?
- I don't know.

491
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,991
What did she do, Angela? You know
what she did. What did she do, Angela?

492
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,311
You know what she did. What are
you afraid of? What did she do?

493
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,710
- What did she do?
- I don't know!

494
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,796
When we were girls...

495
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,359
...we would leave each other messages.

496
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,717
In light.

497
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,958
In breath.

498
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,598
On the windows.

499
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,868
John, there is no 17th act
in Corinthians.

500
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,555
Corinthians goes to 21 acts
in the Bible in hell.

501
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,757
They have Bibles in hell.

502
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,669
<i>Paints a different view of Revelations.</i>

503
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,876
<i>Says the world will not end
by God's hand...</i>

504
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,918
<i>...but be reborn in the embrace
of the damned.</i>

505
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,513
<i>Though if you ask me...</i>

506
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,997
...fire's fire.

507
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,233
<i>16:29, 16:30.</i>

508
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,268
Oh, my, this is certainly not good.

509
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,149
"The sins of the father would only
be exceeded by the sins of the son. "

510
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,110
- Whose son?
- But he can't cross over, B.

511
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,794
- Impossible to cross over.
- Whose son? God's son?

512
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,270
No, the other one. Devil had a son too.

513
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,073
Here it is.

514
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,196
This is the sign of Mammon...

515
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,638
...the son of the devil.
Well, hold on, it says here...

516
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:41,469
<i>- Beeman?
- Yeah.</i>

517
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:44,517
Sorry, I'm...
I'm sorry, no, I'm right here.

518
00:56:45,479 --> 00:56:50,997
It says Mammon has no patience
for his father's rule...

519
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:56,836
...and yearns to forge his own kingdom
of fire and blood.

520
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:03,868
Yeah. Mammon would be
the last demon...

521
00:57:04,039 --> 00:57:06,792
...we'd ever want crossing over
to our plane.

522
00:57:06,959 --> 00:57:10,429
No, wait, wait, wait. I'm reading.
Seems to be a loophole.

523
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:12,829
Always a catch.

524
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:19,269
It says first Mammon would have to
possess a very, very powerful psychic.

525
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:21,953
<i>- Isabel.
- But that wouldn't be enough.</i>

526
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:26,957
To cross over, Mammon would need
divine assistance.

527
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:32,312
To cross over, Mammon would need
the help of God.

528
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:36,117
<i>- The help of God?
- It says...</i>

529
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:45,955
<i>- Beeman?
- John, look...</i>

530
00:57:46,119 --> 00:57:50,431
...I know you've never had much faith,
you've never had much reason to...

531
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:54,194
<i>...but that doesn't mean
that we don't have faith...</i>

532
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:56,711
...in you.

533
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:02,279
Beeman? Beeman?

534
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:05,188
Drive. Fast.

535
00:58:20,679 --> 00:58:22,556
Beeman!

536
00:58:22,959 --> 00:58:24,597
Sulfur.

537
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:27,550
Beeman!

538
00:58:31,639 --> 00:58:33,197
Beeman!

539
00:59:40,359 --> 00:59:42,509
Wasn't just Isabel.

540
00:59:43,759 --> 00:59:45,238
I used to see things too.

541
00:59:47,239 --> 00:59:48,831
But...

542
00:59:48,999 --> 00:59:52,708
...you already knew that, didn't you?
- Go home, Angela.

543
00:59:52,879 --> 00:59:54,278
I need to understand.

544
00:59:54,439 --> 00:59:56,828
You don't wanna know
what's out there, trust me.

545
00:59:56,999 --> 00:59:58,990
I'm stronger than Isabel.

546
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:02,947
Your sister embraced her gift,
you denied yours. Denial is a better idea.

547
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:07,715
It's why you're still alive.
Stick with me, that will change.

548
01:00:07,879 --> 01:00:09,756
I don't need another ghost
following me.

549
01:00:09,919 --> 01:00:12,353
John, they killed my sister.

550
01:00:16,359 --> 01:00:18,748
I'd trade places with her if I could.

551
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:24,353
I used to pretend that I didn't.

552
01:00:24,999 --> 01:00:27,308
That I didn't see things.

553
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:29,192
And...

554
01:00:30,279 --> 01:00:34,431
...by the time we were 10,
they started forcing her to take...

555
01:00:34,759 --> 01:00:37,148
...antipsychotics...

556
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:40,394
...and have treatments.
They would come for her...

557
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:44,154
...and she'd look at me,
and she'd say to me, "Tell them.

558
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:47,994
Why don't you tell them, Angie,
that you can see them too?"

559
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:50,393
But I lied.

560
01:00:51,239 --> 01:00:53,150
I said:

561
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:56,829
"I don't see anything. "

562
01:00:57,759 --> 01:00:59,875
Until one day...

563
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,357
...I finally stopped seeing.

564
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:07,074
I abandoned her, John.

565
01:01:07,879 --> 01:01:10,234
I left her all alone.

566
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:19,389
I need to see what she saw.

567
01:01:21,159 --> 01:01:22,797
Please.

568
01:01:26,999 --> 01:01:30,548
You do this, there's no turning back.

569
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,270
You see them...

570
01:01:35,239 --> 01:01:36,991
...they see you.

571
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:39,750
Understand?

572
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,117
Yeah.

573
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,797
Sure.

574
01:02:26,759 --> 01:02:31,071
So do I have to take the rest of
my clothes off, or can I leave them on?

575
01:02:37,239 --> 01:02:38,831
John?

576
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:40,990
I'm thinking.

577
01:02:44,839 --> 01:02:46,397
John?

578
01:02:46,959 --> 01:02:48,950
On is fine.

579
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,475
- So why water?
- It's a universal conduit.

580
01:03:04,879 --> 01:03:08,508
Lubricates the transition
from one plane to another.

581
01:03:08,679 --> 01:03:12,797
- Now ask me if there's water in hell.
- Is there water in hell?

582
01:03:14,519 --> 01:03:15,918
Sit.

583
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:21,312
Normally, only a portion of the body
has to be suspended...

584
01:03:23,879 --> 01:03:25,756
...but you wanted the crash course.

585
01:03:25,919 --> 01:03:28,513
Yeah, I wanted the crash course.

586
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:30,675
So...

587
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:33,035
So, what's gonna happen?

588
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:34,791
Lie down.

589
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,748
- What do you mean lie down?
- You have to be fully submerged.

590
01:03:40,759 --> 01:03:42,112
For how long?

591
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:44,471
As long as it takes.

592
01:03:54,199 --> 01:03:56,190
Take a deep one.

593
01:05:34,439 --> 01:05:36,475
Oh, God.

594
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:40,111
Oh, God, all those people.

595
01:05:40,999 --> 01:05:43,035
Oh, Isabel.

596
01:05:43,479 --> 01:05:44,753
I've always known.

597
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:49,278
I've always known where they are.
I've always known where to find them...

598
01:05:49,439 --> 01:05:52,431
...where to aim and where to duck...

599
01:05:52,599 --> 01:05:54,430
...and I've always known
where they were.

600
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:56,555
I've always known that it wasn't luck.

601
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:59,233
Always known that it wasn't luck.
I've always known...

602
01:05:59,399 --> 01:06:02,436
I've always known that I could see.

603
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:07,719
I've always known that I could see.

604
01:06:12,399 --> 01:06:14,071
Angela.

605
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:20,029
Someone was here.

606
01:06:45,319 --> 01:06:46,798
It was his.

607
01:06:48,039 --> 01:06:49,836
Rolling.

608
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:53,670
Not a ball.

609
01:06:55,399 --> 01:06:57,151
Something smaller.

610
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:01,397
Shiny.

611
01:07:32,839 --> 01:07:35,034
Balthazar.

612
01:08:05,959 --> 01:08:07,517
Sorry.

613
01:08:14,439 --> 01:08:16,509
Can you just kill him?

614
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:18,713
What about the balance?

615
01:08:18,879 --> 01:08:22,394
Half-breed tipped the scales
when he started killing my friends.

616
01:08:22,559 --> 01:08:24,914
I'm just adding some counterweight.

617
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:59,395
John, I really want...

618
01:09:05,239 --> 01:09:08,197
Think of it as a bulletproof vest.

619
01:09:15,559 --> 01:09:17,515
I'm coming with you.

620
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:21,154
You're staying in the car.

621
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:47,312
Fire? I was born of this.

622
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:51,831
How's Mammon crossing over,
you half-breed piece of shit?

623
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:58,989
That's better. Au naturel.

624
01:10:05,839 --> 01:10:07,955
"Stay in the car. "

625
01:10:08,119 --> 01:10:10,394
"Wait here. "

626
01:10:11,079 --> 01:10:12,353
Men.

627
01:10:25,519 --> 01:10:26,872
Don't fight it, Johnny boy.

628
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:30,310
Enjoy it.

629
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:06,028
We'll see you very soon.

630
01:11:06,439 --> 01:11:08,191
Not really, no.

631
01:11:08,359 --> 01:11:13,308
You can't cheat it this time.
You're going back to hell.

632
01:11:13,479 --> 01:11:14,912
True.

633
01:11:15,079 --> 01:11:16,353
But you're not.

634
01:11:17,959 --> 01:11:20,632
- What are you doing?
- I'm reading you your last rites.

635
01:11:20,799 --> 01:11:24,314
Spare me your remedial incantations.

636
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:26,709
You do know what it is
to truly be forgiven?

637
01:11:26,879 --> 01:11:29,313
To be welcomed
into the Kingdom of God.

638
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,791
Demon in heaven.

639
01:11:32,439 --> 01:11:35,272
I'd love to be a fly on that wall.

640
01:11:35,439 --> 01:11:39,512
You're not a priest. You have no power.

641
01:11:40,839 --> 01:11:42,750
Just tell me how Mammon
is crossing over...

642
01:11:42,919 --> 01:11:45,877
...and you can go back
to your shithole.

643
01:11:48,519 --> 01:11:51,829
Okay, Bally, enjoy it.

644
01:12:01,639 --> 01:12:06,315
"May God have mercy on you
and grant you the pardon of all your sins.

645
01:12:06,879 --> 01:12:11,111
Whose soever sins you remit on Earth,
they are remitted unto them in heaven. "

646
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:15,667
- How? How's he doing it?
- No.

647
01:12:15,839 --> 01:12:17,113
No, I can't.

648
01:12:18,919 --> 01:12:22,116
Grant your child entry
into thy kingdom...

649
01:12:22,759 --> 01:12:27,514
...in the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

650
01:12:27,999 --> 01:12:29,637
Amen!

651
01:12:32,439 --> 01:12:35,511
The blood of God.

652
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:36,953
He found it.

653
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:41,198
Whatever killed the son of God...

654
01:12:41,359 --> 01:12:46,672
...will give birth to the son of the devil.

655
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:50,471
By the way...

656
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:56,153
...you have to ask for absolution
to be forgiven...

657
01:12:56,999 --> 01:12:58,227
...asshole.

658
01:13:01,999 --> 01:13:05,309
My work here is done.

659
01:13:06,639 --> 01:13:11,269
- What are you laughing at?
- She was my only mission...

660
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:15,478
...and you brought her right to us.

661
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:21,516
So does this walking fast
mean you've found something?

662
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:25,797
Jesus didn't die from being nailed to a
cross. He was killed by a soldier's spear.

663
01:13:25,959 --> 01:13:28,029
The Spear of Destiny.

664
01:13:28,439 --> 01:13:31,033
I'm a Catholic, John.
I know the Crucifixion story.

665
01:13:39,559 --> 01:13:44,189
I drew out the sister as you asked.

666
01:13:44,519 --> 01:13:49,752
She's been made flush and ready.

667
01:13:49,919 --> 01:13:53,514
So much power.

668
01:13:53,799 --> 01:13:58,793
Now, if you grant me my resurrection,
I shall serve.

669
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:04,669
Wait. But I did as we agreed.

670
01:14:04,839 --> 01:14:08,309
No. Please. No!

671
01:14:10,999 --> 01:14:15,834
Beeman said Mammon needed
divine assistance to cross over.

672
01:14:16,799 --> 01:14:20,189
How's the blood of God's only son?

673
01:14:20,479 --> 01:14:22,754
The stains on the spear.

674
01:14:23,999 --> 01:14:26,752
- Yeah.
- So he gets the spear.

675
01:14:26,919 --> 01:14:28,989
He still has to locate
a powerful psychic.

676
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:31,552
Not really.

677
01:14:34,519 --> 01:14:35,793
Twins.

678
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:39,231
Where's the amulet?

679
01:14:40,439 --> 01:14:43,397
I don't know,
I must have left it in the...

680
01:14:44,999 --> 01:14:46,273
What's wrong?

681
01:14:46,799 --> 01:14:48,437
I don't know, I just feel...

682
01:15:19,079 --> 01:15:20,637
- Bird on a ladder.
- Sorry.

683
01:15:25,999 --> 01:15:28,069
- Wait here.
- Yeah.

684
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:33,957
Who's a rat in a dress now, huh, bitch?

685
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:49,748
Have you lost what little mind you have?

686
01:15:49,999 --> 01:15:51,512
Don't.

687
01:15:52,359 --> 01:15:54,998
I need to use the chair.

688
01:15:55,159 --> 01:15:59,038
I offer no aid to one side or the other.

689
01:15:59,999 --> 01:16:02,638
- The balance.
- Screw the balance.

690
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:10,868
You dare? In my house?

691
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:16,796
Is this neutral? Bullshit.

692
01:16:16,999 --> 01:16:19,797
You're the only one still playing
by the rules, Midnite.

693
01:16:19,959 --> 01:16:23,554
And while you've been imitating
Switzerland, people are dying.

694
01:16:24,039 --> 01:16:27,952
Hennessy, Beeman, they were
your friends once too, remember?

695
01:16:28,999 --> 01:16:31,593
I need your help!

696
01:16:33,639 --> 01:16:36,073
Consider it a last request.

697
01:16:39,719 --> 01:16:42,438
You play a dangerous game.

698
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:51,230
Two-hundred-dollar shirt, by the way.

699
01:16:53,159 --> 01:16:57,630
That little shit has been trying to climb
out of his father's shadow for eons.

700
01:16:57,799 --> 01:17:02,509
I'd hate to think what he would do
to this world if he ever broke through.

701
01:17:05,479 --> 01:17:07,754
Forgot how big it was.

702
01:17:08,119 --> 01:17:12,351
Two hundred souls passed through
this wood and steel at Sing Sing.

703
01:17:12,519 --> 01:17:14,111
Yeah.

704
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,269
Which way's east?

705
01:17:36,359 --> 01:17:38,919
How many years since you've surfed?

706
01:17:40,119 --> 01:17:41,996
Like riding a bike.

707
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:44,070
No, not really.

708
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:49,352
Tell me this isn't about the girl.

709
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:54,672
Definitely mostly not about the girl.

710
01:18:00,799 --> 01:18:02,152
Cold.

711
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:04,355
Little flavor?

712
01:18:26,799 --> 01:18:28,710
- Sure about this?
- No.

713
01:19:16,839 --> 01:19:18,431
Midnite!

714
01:19:23,919 --> 01:19:26,911
- Any luck?
- That's a word for it.

715
01:19:27,239 --> 01:19:30,515
Holy shit. You're Papa Midnite,
aren't you?

716
01:19:37,959 --> 01:19:42,157
And how exactly do you intend
on getting close enough to use these?

717
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:47,196
Well, they did not leave her unguarded.

718
01:19:47,359 --> 01:19:48,951
Half-breeds are most vulnerable...

719
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:52,907
...when their outer skin is breached
by holy water.

720
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:56,556
Certain objects, most notably
either of the two crosses of Isteria...

721
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:59,108
...have been used by even
the unordained to bless...

722
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:01,076
...commonly occurring waters...

723
01:20:01,239 --> 01:20:02,911
...even rain.

724
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:04,758
Maybe if...

725
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:12,509
There's no use sitting on the bench
if you're not ready to play, right?

726
01:20:12,679 --> 01:20:16,388
You wouldn't have one of those
enchanted crosses here in a cabinet...

727
01:20:16,559 --> 01:20:18,550
...maybe we could take with us?

728
01:20:18,759 --> 01:20:23,071
Look, John, no offense, I just don't think
that it's a great idea, you know...

729
01:20:23,239 --> 01:20:26,436
...you going on a solo mission
to save the world. That's my vote.

730
01:20:26,599 --> 01:20:29,159
I don't know what pops thinks,
but that's...

731
01:20:30,439 --> 01:20:33,351
Take him, John. Kill him after.

732
01:20:38,279 --> 01:20:42,397
If you get back, see me
about membership. Maybe.

733
01:20:42,559 --> 01:20:45,357
Okay. I will.

734
01:20:49,919 --> 01:20:52,114
- What are you doing?
- Praying.

735
01:20:52,279 --> 01:20:55,112
Praying. Okay.

736
01:20:55,999 --> 01:20:57,591
Come on.

737
01:21:52,279 --> 01:21:53,758
Half-breeds, right?

738
01:21:56,519 --> 01:22:00,831
A birth like this, they're definitely
gonna be guarding her, right? Definitely.

739
01:22:01,239 --> 01:22:02,672
Yeah.

740
01:22:05,559 --> 01:22:09,871
We can get through them. I mean,
that cross has gotta work, right?

741
01:22:10,279 --> 01:22:11,632
Right?

742
01:22:11,959 --> 01:22:15,190
It's not always like it is in the books.

743
01:23:01,599 --> 01:23:03,271
What is that?

744
01:23:03,759 --> 01:23:05,670
Hellspeak.

745
01:23:08,199 --> 01:23:10,190
You know what to do.

746
01:23:13,319 --> 01:23:14,911
I'm okay.

747
01:23:16,679 --> 01:23:18,351
Sure.

748
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:32,193
One last show.

749
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:06,277
Hi.

750
01:24:06,839 --> 01:24:08,113
My name's John.

751
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:13,635
You are in violation of the balance.

752
01:24:14,439 --> 01:24:16,714
Leave immediately...

753
01:24:16,999 --> 01:24:19,559
...or I will deport you.

754
01:24:21,439 --> 01:24:23,191
All of you.

755
01:24:30,279 --> 01:24:32,110
Go to hell.

756
01:24:37,519 --> 01:24:38,918
Holy water?

757
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:55,555
Angela.

758
01:26:26,559 --> 01:26:28,117
John?

759
01:26:30,319 --> 01:26:31,593
John.

760
01:26:37,119 --> 01:26:38,598
Shit.

761
01:27:02,919 --> 01:27:04,238
Pull!

762
01:27:43,479 --> 01:27:44,753
Angela.

763
01:28:07,319 --> 01:28:09,355
Angela, what is it?

764
01:28:15,799 --> 01:28:17,994
Get it out.

765
01:28:30,919 --> 01:28:32,398
Get it out.

766
01:28:32,959 --> 01:28:34,915
Get it...

767
01:29:17,079 --> 01:29:18,353
Oh, my God.

768
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:26,832
Not bad, kid.

769
01:29:29,719 --> 01:29:31,630
"Not bad. " You hear that?

770
01:29:31,799 --> 01:29:36,031
You know why that is? It's because
this is Kramer. Chas Kramer, ass...

771
01:29:43,599 --> 01:29:45,430
Chas.

772
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:55,587
You're right, John.

773
01:29:56,799 --> 01:29:58,437
It's not like the books.

774
01:29:59,559 --> 01:30:01,151
No...

775
01:30:02,039 --> 01:30:03,791
...it isn't.

776
01:30:23,879 --> 01:30:26,552
Into the light, I command thee.

777
01:30:27,559 --> 01:30:30,869
Into the light, I command thee.

778
01:30:31,959 --> 01:30:35,918
Into the light, I command thee.

779
01:30:40,279 --> 01:30:43,749
Into the light, I command thee.

780
01:30:46,839 --> 01:30:49,592
Your ego is astounding.

781
01:30:49,759 --> 01:30:51,477
Gabriel.

782
01:30:51,639 --> 01:30:52,913
Figures.

783
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:57,355
And the wicked shall inherit the Earth.

784
01:30:57,519 --> 01:30:59,828
You judging me now, John?

785
01:31:01,039 --> 01:31:04,873
Betrayal, murder, genocide,
call me provincial.

786
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:08,827
I am simply seeking to inspire mankind
to all that was intended.

787
01:31:09,239 --> 01:31:12,754
By handing Earth over
to the son of the devil?

788
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:14,713
Help me here.

789
01:31:18,599 --> 01:31:22,717
You're handed this precious gift, right?

790
01:31:23,879 --> 01:31:27,758
Each one of you granted redemption
from the Creator.

791
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:31,153
Murderers, rapists and molesters...

792
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:33,549
...all of you, you just have to repent...

793
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:36,438
...and God takes you into his bosom.

794
01:31:38,679 --> 01:31:40,829
In all the worlds in all the universe...

795
01:31:40,999 --> 01:31:43,797
...no other creature can make
such a boast, save man.

796
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:47,433
It's not fair.

797
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:55,227
If sweet, sweet God loves you so...

798
01:31:55,399 --> 01:31:58,277
...then I'll make you worthy of his love.

799
01:31:59,879 --> 01:32:02,871
I've been watching you for a long time.

800
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:07,510
It's only in the face of horror
that you truly find your nobler selves.

801
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:11,354
And you can be so noble.

802
01:32:13,959 --> 01:32:15,472
So...

803
01:32:16,119 --> 01:32:18,349
...I'll bring you pain.

804
01:32:18,999 --> 01:32:21,274
I'll bring you horror.

805
01:32:22,919 --> 01:32:25,877
So that you may rise above it.

806
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:32,953
So that those of you who survive
this reign of hell on Earth...

807
01:32:33,119 --> 01:32:35,952
...will be worthy of God's love.

808
01:32:36,119 --> 01:32:37,837
Gabriel...

809
01:32:38,279 --> 01:32:40,429
...you're insane.

810
01:32:42,279 --> 01:32:45,351
The road to salvation begins tonight.

811
01:32:46,119 --> 01:32:47,757
Right now.

812
01:33:27,719 --> 01:33:30,597
I know I'm not one of your favorites.

813
01:33:32,079 --> 01:33:34,718
I'm not even welcome in your house.

814
01:33:36,239 --> 01:33:38,958
But I could use a little attention.

815
01:33:42,119 --> 01:33:43,757
Please.

816
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:30,514
Come forth.

817
01:34:49,479 --> 01:34:51,276
Hurry.

818
01:35:07,799 --> 01:35:09,596
Mammon...

819
01:35:09,759 --> 01:35:12,114
...son of Satan...

820
01:35:12,279 --> 01:35:16,557
...I unleash you unto this world.

821
01:36:08,119 --> 01:36:09,393
Lu.

822
01:36:09,559 --> 01:36:11,550
What took you so long?

823
01:36:11,719 --> 01:36:13,914
Hello, John.

824
01:36:14,599 --> 01:36:17,796
John, hello.

825
01:36:22,439 --> 01:36:25,272
You're the one soul...

826
01:36:25,639 --> 01:36:29,109
...I would come up here
to collect myself.

827
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:34,594
So I've heard.

828
01:36:35,319 --> 01:36:36,593
You mind?

829
01:36:37,599 --> 01:36:39,874
Oh, go... Go right ahead. I've got stock.

830
01:36:40,839 --> 01:36:42,192
Coffin nail.

831
01:36:42,679 --> 01:36:44,476
Very fitting, John.

832
01:36:47,239 --> 01:36:50,629
You know, when you cut too deep,
you cut the tendons...

833
01:36:50,799 --> 01:36:53,472
...finger movement goes
out the window.

834
01:36:53,639 --> 01:36:55,630
Let me help you.

835
01:37:06,559 --> 01:37:08,072
See?

836
01:37:09,839 --> 01:37:11,192
Sonny...

837
01:37:11,359 --> 01:37:16,274
...I've got a whole theme park
full of red delights for you.

838
01:37:16,999 --> 01:37:18,478
Well, aren't you a peach.

839
01:37:20,199 --> 01:37:23,874
I didn't think you would
make the same mistake twice.

840
01:37:28,519 --> 01:37:30,396
And you didn't...

841
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:32,791
...did you?

842
01:37:33,079 --> 01:37:34,637
So how's the family?

843
01:37:34,799 --> 01:37:40,510
Family's doing just fine.
Busy, busy, busy. Need a vacation.

844
01:37:40,839 --> 01:37:44,195
Word is that kid of yours
is a chip off the old block.

845
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:47,271
Well, one does what one can.

846
01:37:47,439 --> 01:37:48,997
He's in the other room.

847
01:37:49,159 --> 01:37:51,832
Boys will be boys.

848
01:37:52,999 --> 01:37:54,273
With Gabriel.

849
01:37:56,999 --> 01:37:59,672
No accounting for taste, really.

850
01:38:00,039 --> 01:38:02,348
They have the Spear of Destiny.

851
01:38:04,999 --> 01:38:08,548
"They have the Spear of Destiny. "

852
01:38:16,519 --> 01:38:19,591
Or is it another one of your cons?

853
01:38:21,599 --> 01:38:23,794
Go look for yourself.

854
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:30,189
You've waited 20 years for me, Lu...

855
01:38:30,559 --> 01:38:33,471
...what's another 20 seconds?

856
01:39:35,559 --> 01:39:40,553
- Lucifer.
- This world is mine. In time.

857
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:43,187
You, best of all of us, Gabriel...

858
01:39:43,359 --> 01:39:48,353
...should understand ambition.

859
01:39:48,519 --> 01:39:50,908
Son of perdition.

860
01:39:51,759 --> 01:39:53,033
Little horn.

861
01:39:55,079 --> 01:39:57,195
Most unclean.

862
01:39:57,359 --> 01:39:59,873
I do miss the old names.

863
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:02,835
Time to go home, son.

864
01:40:02,999 --> 01:40:05,354
I will smite thee...

865
01:40:05,519 --> 01:40:08,317
...in his honor.

866
01:40:13,239 --> 01:40:18,154
Looks like somebody doesn't
have your back anymore.

867
01:40:35,239 --> 01:40:36,991
Father?

868
01:40:59,439 --> 01:41:00,792
So.

869
01:41:07,519 --> 01:41:08,793
So.

870
01:41:09,159 --> 01:41:12,754
Yeah, what do you want? An extension?

871
01:41:17,319 --> 01:41:19,230
The sister...

872
01:41:20,119 --> 01:41:21,393
...Isabel.

873
01:41:23,239 --> 01:41:25,070
What about her?

874
01:41:26,999 --> 01:41:29,308
Let her go home.

875
01:41:31,919 --> 01:41:36,310
You're willing to give up your life
so she can go to heaven?

876
01:41:45,719 --> 01:41:48,631
Fine. It's done.

877
01:41:51,159 --> 01:41:54,469
Time to go, John.

878
01:41:54,799 --> 01:41:56,357
Yeah.

879
01:42:51,839 --> 01:42:53,750
The sacrifice.

880
01:43:04,879 --> 01:43:10,636
No. This one belongs to me.

881
01:43:20,199 --> 01:43:25,796
No. You will live, John Constantine.

882
01:43:28,759 --> 01:43:30,112
You will live.

883
01:43:32,599 --> 01:43:34,954
So you will have...

884
01:43:36,599 --> 01:43:39,113
...the chance to prove...

885
01:43:41,639 --> 01:43:46,793
...that your soul truly belongs in hell.

886
01:43:49,719 --> 01:43:52,677
Oh, you will live.

887
01:43:56,839 --> 01:44:00,548
You will live.

888
01:45:11,319 --> 01:45:13,230
Thank you.

889
01:45:15,559 --> 01:45:17,436
No problem.

890
01:45:32,839 --> 01:45:34,511
Human.

891
01:45:36,359 --> 01:45:38,793
You don't deserve to be human.

892
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:44,755
Do you want revenge?
Is that what you're thinking right now?

893
01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:48,632
Do it.

894
01:45:49,879 --> 01:45:51,358
Do it.

895
01:45:52,839 --> 01:45:54,909
Seek revenge.

896
01:45:55,079 --> 01:45:57,274
End my life.

897
01:45:57,959 --> 01:45:59,438
Go on.

898
01:46:01,479 --> 01:46:02,912
Be the hand of God.

899
01:46:03,079 --> 01:46:05,354
It's your choice.

900
01:46:05,519 --> 01:46:07,669
It's always been your choice.

901
01:46:12,759 --> 01:46:14,112
Yeah.

902
01:46:19,559 --> 01:46:21,834
That's called pain.

903
01:46:21,999 --> 01:46:23,318
Get used to it.

904
01:46:29,479 --> 01:46:31,549
You could've shot me, John!

905
01:46:33,599 --> 01:46:36,352
You chose a higher path!

906
01:46:37,719 --> 01:46:40,392
Look how well you're doing!

907
01:47:04,879 --> 01:47:06,835
Nice spot.

908
01:47:10,919 --> 01:47:12,352
I have something for you.

909
01:47:15,279 --> 01:47:17,918
Something tells me
you're not a flowers kind of guy.

910
01:47:20,839 --> 01:47:23,273
Oh, how thoughtful.

911
01:47:28,359 --> 01:47:30,111
John...

912
01:47:31,519 --> 01:47:33,714
...why are you giving me this?

913
01:47:33,879 --> 01:47:35,278
Rules.

914
01:47:35,559 --> 01:47:36,992
Hide it.

915
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:40,071
Somewhere no one
will ever be able to find it.

916
01:47:41,079 --> 01:47:42,671
Not even me.

917
01:47:46,679 --> 01:47:48,397
Always a catch.

918
01:47:49,799 --> 01:47:51,312
Yeah.

919
01:48:03,879 --> 01:48:05,631
So.

920
01:48:07,199 --> 01:48:10,111
I've got some cleaning up to do.

921
01:48:13,799 --> 01:48:15,710
I'll...

922
01:48:15,879 --> 01:48:18,074
...see you around.

923
01:48:20,479 --> 01:48:22,310
I'd like that.

924
01:48:51,079 --> 01:48:53,832
<i>I guess there's a plan for all of us.</i>

925
01:48:53,999 --> 01:48:55,512
<i>I had to die...</i>

926
01:48:55,679 --> 01:48:56,953
<i>...twice...</i>

927
01:48:57,119 --> 01:48:59,235
<i>...just to figure that out.</i>

928
01:48:59,399 --> 01:49:04,189
<i>Like the book says, he works his work
in mysterious ways.</i>

929
01:49:04,359 --> 01:49:06,429
<i>Some people like it...</i>

930
01:49:06,599 --> 01:49:09,033
<i>...some people don't.</i>

931
01:54:47,959 --> 01:54:49,995
You did good, kid.
