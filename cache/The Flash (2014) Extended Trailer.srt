1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,470
Barry got into a fight

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,690
Guess I wasn't fast enough

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,410
It's better to have a good heart
than fast legs

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,490
When I was eleven my mom was murdered

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,010
I saw what looked like a ball of lightning

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,440
Inside the lighting there was a man

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,960
He killed my mom

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,610
Mom? Dad?

9
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:38,440
- Sorry...sorry
- You can't keep docking work so you can go off 
chasing down these urban legends Barry

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,830
- Everyone you work with thinks you're a wierdo
- You gotta get yourself a girlfriend

11
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:54,860
I spent my whole life searching for the impossible,
never imagining that I would...become The Impossible

12
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,500
- He's hit by lightning
- How is he still alive?

13
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,360
- he's codeing
- Charge it 200, Clear!

14
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,040
- Oh my God
- Where am I?

15
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,590
- We're at S.T.A.R. Labs
- I need you to urinate in this

16
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,490
Why? What is happening?
What is going on?

17
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,490
you're struck by lightning, dude

18
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,480
Lightning gave me abbs?

19
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,070
- You were in a coma
- for how long?

20
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,560
Nine months
Welcome back Mr. Alan

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,100
We have a lot to discuss

22
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,810
I watched you die Barry
You kept dying, your heart kept stoping

23
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:49,609
- It's still beating
- It feels really fast

24
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:57,330
So you thought the world was slowing down. You were going so fast, 
it only looked like everyone else was standing still

25
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,990
- There is so much that we don't understand
- What's happening to me?

26
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,730
You had a distilled radiaous fracture.
It's healed in three hours

27
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,820
- How is that even possible
- We don't know

28
00:02:14,045 --> 00:02:15,045
How does it fit?

29
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,390
It's a little snug

30
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,110
You don't really beleave you can run that fast, do you?

31
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,170
We've been searching for other meta-humans like yourself

32
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,410
The sky went black and then, boom!
Outside was inside

33
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,930
Clint Mardon, he's a Bank robber
I think he can control the weather

34
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:57,770
- What really happened that night?
- Dimentional barrier raptured unleashing unknown energies into our world

35
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,030
- Anti-matter dark energy, X elements...
- Those are all theoretical

36
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,670
And how theoretical are you?

37
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,080
I've been thinking too small

38
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,110
they're still out there
We have to stop them

39
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,940
You're not a hero

40
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,980
You're just a young man who was struck by lightning

41
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,960
Mardon!

42
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,670
This just keeps getting cooler

43
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,100
The Meta-humans have been busy, but I need your help 
to catch Mardon and anyone else out there like him

44
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,960
- But I can't do it without you
- I have something that might help

45
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,950
It's made of a reinforced tri-polimer
It's heat and abrasive resistant

46
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,760
What if I'm not a hero?
What if I'm just some guy who was struck by lightning?

47
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,590
I don't think that bolt of lightning struck you Barry
I think It chose you

48
00:04:01,615 --> 00:04:05,989
Because you can inspire people
watching over your city like a guardian angel

49
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,010
Making a difference

50
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,270
Saving people in a flash

51
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,460
It's time to think big

52
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,150
- I'll run around him in the opposite direction
- You'll die

53
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,330
- You're not faster than a bullet
- Run Barry, Run

54
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,820
What happened here?

55
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,010
Just like everyday kinda badguy shootout

56
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,710
My name is Barry Alan

57
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,600
And I'm the fastest man alive

58
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,910
A friend recently gave me the idea for a new name

59
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,180
And something tells me it's gonna catch on

60
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,520
Take your own advice
Wear a mask

61
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,810
Cool

62
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,810
