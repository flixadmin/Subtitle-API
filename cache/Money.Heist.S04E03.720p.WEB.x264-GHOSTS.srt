13
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,166
What is going on down there?

14
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,291
- Pretend we're drunk.
- I'm not pretending anything.

15
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,625
Play drunk, or I'll snap your neck.

16
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,625
What are you doing? What the fuck?

17
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,958
I'll call the police!

18
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:31,125
The police... are already here!

19
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:34,083
- Is that Benito?
- Do you want to call them?

20
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,833
- Ring, ding, ding!
- What are you doing?

21
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:39,166
- You're a cop!
- Keep it up. Come on.

22
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,708
You should be ashamed of yourself!

23
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,228
The house is full of them.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,250
And your car.

25
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:56,750
And your wife's car.

26
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,166
It looks like C-4, but it's fake,
made out of plastic.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,916
That's your alibi. If they find you out,
you won't be a criminal, just a father

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,041
who is scared to death,
and they'll understand that.

29
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,500
When I get out, I'll tell them what
you did, and I'll be back with 3,000 cops!

30
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,333
Well, we could also use real C-4.

31
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:17,458
- We can place it anywhere you'd imagine.
- Boom!

32
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:27,916
Don't get the wrong idea.
We don't want you to do this for... money,

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,166
but, well, we understand the trouble
this could cause you.

34
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,416
One million euros.

35
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:37,750
With this money and the alibi, you're free
to choose whose side you want to be on.

36
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,500
On that woman's side,
the one who makes illegal arrests,

37
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:42,208
tortures,

38
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,708
and abuses the power that was given to her
by the Constitution.

39
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:53,333
Or with us.

40
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,958
Good. I need you to answer some questions.

41
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:01,125
I'll decide if I answer them.

42
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,125
Inspector Murillo... is she alive?

43
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,250
Well, she could be.

44
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:12,416
Is she in the tent?

45
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:14,833
She could be.

46
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:20,041
I need you to communicate to her
that the Professor knows... she's alive.

47
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,541
She won't believe me.

48
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,291
She'll assume you were arrested
if I told her I saw you.

49
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,125
If you were wearing this watch...

50
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
she'll believe you.

51
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,541
<i>When it comes to love,
there's always a ticking clock.</i>

52
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,958
<i>Always a countdown.</i>

53
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:44,000
<i>- Loving someone isn't enough.</i>
- Is there anything else?

54
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,791
<i>It all comes down to timing.</i>

55
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,416
What's that?

56
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,875
Something for when she wakes up.

57
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,666
That's really very nice of you.

58
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,500
She said she wouldn't touch me
with a ten-foot pole.

59
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,041
<i>Here's a little advice...</i>

60
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,791
<i>don't fall in love in a heist.</i>

61
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:43,458

DAY 1 OF THE HEIST

74
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,333
The phone!

75
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,791
SOUTHERN SPAIN
DAY 1 OF THE HEIST

76
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:04,708
<i>Mama?</i>

77
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:07,041
Paula, my love!

78
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,500
<i>How are you? What are you doing today?</i>

79
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,250
The same as yesterday, Mama.

80
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,875
I'm sure it was something super great.

81
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,833
- <i>Come on. Tell me about it.</i>
- I can't think of anything.

82
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,500
- Do you miss me, sweetheart?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

83
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:22,291
<i>What's wrong? Are you watching TV?</i>

84
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:24,458
No, I'm playing with Grandma.

85
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:25,875
Pass me to Grandma.

86
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,041
<i>Okay. Grandma!</i>

87
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
Darling?

88
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,291
Is something wrong with my baby?
She sounds kind of strange.

89
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,750
I don't know.

90
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:36,750
I think she's fine.

91
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,625
<i>Well, when you get home for dinner,
you can talk to her, right?</i>

92
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,208
- Sure, Mom.
- And don't forget to buy some bread.

93
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:31,791
It's six in the morning.

94
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,250
The ambulance is in the lab,
ready to be searched.

95
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,333
In about an hour, Alberto will be there.

96
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,625
And like a hound...

97
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:44,500
...he will track down the scent
of his new prey. Your sweet daughter.

98
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:48,875
Do you think I left her address...
hanging on the fridge with a magnet?

99
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,916
I think you're a guilty mother.

100
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,750
Come on. You wouldn't just leave,

101
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,750
do your little heist for a week
and not make one phone call.

102
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:57,041
Right?

103
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:00,791
And what about your bad daughter complex?
Because your mother... Oof!

104
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,500
You can't leave her alone,
not even to eat a Popsicle.

105
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,458
How'd you do it?

106
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,434
In the ambulance with the Professor...
How did you call them?

107
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:12,333
We've already thought about all this.
Surprising, I know.

108
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,791
So you can send Alberto
like a dog looking for a bone,

109
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,916
- but you know you'll find nothing.
- Hmm.

110
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,750
What happened to your head?

111
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:40,291
I'm just obsessed
with the heist Colonel, you know.

112
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,958
I wake up super early.
I can't stay in bed.

113
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,750
I was tying my shoes, agonizing
about the Professor,

114
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,309
and as I was getting up,
I almost broke the window off the wall

115
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,916
because of how hard I hit it
with my forehead.

116
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,333
You're just like me, Antoñanzas.

117
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,083
Even with the truce,
I still can't sleep.

118
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,286
At three in the morning,
I was wide awake like an owl,

119
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,916
thinking about how the Professor
was gonna fuck with us today.

120
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,416
I'm gonna go in there a moment
to see if Sierra needs some...

121
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,375
Murillo is in total isolation.

122
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:14,250
Just so I can go
and give a coffee to the inspector.

123
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:20,125
Murillo can only have contact with Sierra.

124
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:23,625
She didn't let her sleep all night.
She's... trying to break her.

125
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,166
Let's grab a coffee, you and me.

126
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:32,250
The biggest enemy of this crime
isn't the police.

127
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,416
It's the rush.

128
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,416
The motor home was as clean as a morgue.

129
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,708
You guys left it...

130
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:41,583
sparkling.

131
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,666
But the ambulance...

132
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,208
...you got out of there
like you were on fire.

133
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,625
There's always something left. Always.

134
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,416
A small hair on a pillow,

135
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:52,833
a sock...

136
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:56,125
Then comes the CSI with luminol
and ultraviolet light and then...

137
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,208
bang!

138
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,166
Gotcha.

139
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,291
I'll repeat my offer.

140
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,458
I go in there right now

141
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,541
and disappear with the hair that would
take us to your mother and daughter,

142
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,875
or we wait for your ex...

143
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,000
and you're fucked.

144
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,375
You have nothing.

145
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,708
You're threatening me with
"maybe we're gonna find something."

146
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,500
You know what’s happening?

147
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,166
Your pregnancy has you so high on estrogen

148
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,416
that you've become the most
optimistic woman in Spain.

149
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,041
Try not to waste all those hormones.
You'll need them for delivery

150
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,791
'cause it fuckin' hurts.

151
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,666
What are you gonna do when it comes out?

152
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,750
Is it a boy or girl?

153
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:53,375
You don't know?

154
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,333
Poor little child.

155
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,083
What the fuck happened?

156
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,541
They were barefoot, man.

157
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:14,166
Barefoot? Who was?

158
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,541
Rio and Stockholm.

159
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,958
- And?
- What do you mean, "And"?

160
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,541
Who goes barefoot
in the middle of a heist?

161
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,625
There’s something fucked up

162
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:25,250
about taking your shoes off on a couch
in the middle of a heist.

163
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,458
What? Are you stupid?

164
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,341
If they were thinking of fucking,
they'd fuck.

165
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:41,833
They'd keep their shoes on.

166
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,375
Well...

167
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,333
What were you making here last night?

168
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:52,875
This thing.

169
00:11:57,541 --> 00:11:59,541
- You were making this?
- Yep.

170
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,708
You beat the shit out of a guy,

171
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:10,500
completely shattering her image of you,

172
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:14,625
and you try to fix it
by giving her a little golden heart?

173
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,333
What should I have done?

174
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:19,916
Change.

175
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,791
In her eyes,

176
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,125
you're the bad guy now.

177
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:27,791
A violent guy.

178
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,958
Tell me how you fell in love.

179
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:32,833
I shot her in the leg.

180
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,083
No, I shot her in the leg

181
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,833
so I could save her life.
To save her life.

182
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,291
I don't know.

183
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,416
I showed her some dance moves.

184
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,916
- You danced for her?
- Yeah.

185
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,708
I danced for her.

186
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,958
I don’t know. I told her stories.

187
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,875
We laughed a lot.

188
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,541
And...

189
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:02,333
when was the last time
you told her stories?

190
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,833
When was the last time you made her laugh?

191
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,625
When was the last time you danced for her?

192
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,250
Hey, Rio. Could you bring me
a little coffee, please?

193
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:29,708
I came up with this plan. If you're safe
here today, it’s because of me.

194
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:31,041
Have some gratitude.

195
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,291
You're stuck there,
so why don't you get some rest?

196
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,875
At least a little water.
That's all I want, please.

197
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,666
Just a little water?

198
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,041
I'm sorry, friend, but...

199
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,083
Thank you.

200
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,708
You look tired.

201
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,083
Can't you sleep?

202
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,250
You're waking up three, four times
a night at least, huh?

203
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:12,416
Hey, Rio...

204
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:17,041
if you need anything... to talk
or anything, I'm here. Okay?

205
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,375
Thank you.

206
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,583
That's the weakest link.

207
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:35,875
Palpitations,
excessive sweating, insomnia.

208
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,250
You have to break free during his watch.

209
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,541
He won't be able to pull the trigger.

210
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,083
What makes you think I won't kill you
as soon as I'm free?

211
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:48,166
Well...

212
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,500
I bashed your head in.

213
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,250
You fucked up my eyes.

214
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,750
Even.

215
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,666
A pact between gentlemen.

216
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,625
Are you asking me to trust you,
you piece of shit?

217
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,958
I'm telling you
they've declared a truce out there.

218
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,375
Armored vans aren't breaking in.

219
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:09,583
We're in a fucking Cold War,
and you and I are all alone.

220
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,666
And?

221
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:15,166
And I'm gonna turn you into the chaos
that this heist needs.

222
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,166
Into <i>Alien: The Eighth Passenger.</i>

223
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,500
Into John McClane... from <i>Die Hard.</i>

224
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,708
STORM RESERVOIR
KEEP OUT

225
00:15:58,875 --> 00:15:59,958
<i>Let's go.</i>

226
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,541
<i>The Professor arrived
at the storm reservoir</i>

227
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,833
<i>thinking about Raquel.</i>

228
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:39,166
<i>Just like Alberto did
when he stepped into the ambulance.</i>

229
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:46,333
<i>It's fascinating how two people
can think about someone...</i>

230
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:47,958
<i>at the same time...</i>

231
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,541
<i>in very different ways.</i>

232
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,166
<i>They say that love can move worlds...</i>

233
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,333
<i>but the truth is,
hate can be just as strong.</i>

234
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,250
<i>You were right.</i>

235
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,333
<i>Lisbon's alive.</i>

236
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:07,958
Where is she?

237
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,841
For the moment, she's in the tent.
I imagine they're interrogating her.

238
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,333
<i>How long can they keep her there?</i>

239
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,750
<i>I don't know, but I bet
they'll overlook the 72-hour custody rule.</i>

240
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,875
<i>They'll transfer her
at some point.</i>

241
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,666
- Can you rescue her?
- <i>We can't do it during a transfer.</i>

242
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,666
It wouldn't be smart.

243
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,476
We did it with you. They would see
it coming, and it would be suicide.

244
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,666
<i>So what are you going to do?</i>

245
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:31,548
They have Lisbon with them, and she has
the entire plan inside her head,

246
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,708
<i>including the place
you're calling me from, Professor.</i>

247
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Professor?

248
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:46,875
I don't know.

249
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:50,708
<i>I'm so tired. I can't...</i>

250
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,541
I can't even think.

251
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,583
<i>But I'll find a solution.
Don't worry about it.</i>

252
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:02,666
I'm making ravioli.
You need all the energy.

253
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:08,958
Is Palermo still tied up?

254
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,750
- Yes.
<i>- I want you to go to him</i>

255
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,083
and tell him this...

256
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,250
No, no, no. I'm not telling him anything.

257
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,583
<i>He'll bite my face like a rabid dog.</i>

258
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,875
<i>Well you’ll have to. I want you
to say it to him exactly like this...</i>

259
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,166
"You have a message from the Professor.

260
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,875
<i>Lisbon is alive.</i>

261
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,250
She's being held in the tent,

262
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:30,000
and I need you
to think of a way to rescue her."

263
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:33,583
- He won't do it.
- <i>Listen to me, Tokyo.</i>

264
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,875
The only thing I'm trying to do
is to get Palermo

265
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,375
<i>to fall back in love with this plan.
I need him to be on our side.</i>

266
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:42,916
Go and tell him,
while I think of something else.

267
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,250
Understood?

268
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,375
Understood.

269
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm gonna head to the bathroom.
Would you like to accompany me, Sergio?

270
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:19,333
Have you ever had the privilege
of experiencing

271
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,958
masterful fellatio
from a man with great skill?

272
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,500
Hmm?

273
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:34,166
He's completely unpredictable.

274
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,500
Sergio, he was simply proposing
some fellatio quite gallantly.

275
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,642
- He doesn't know...
- You know what I’m talking about.

276
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,041
He's uncontrollable
because he's abnormally egocentric.

277
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,245
He'll respect the hierarchy.

278
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:46,791
He would respect it if the heist
was two hours, or three, or one night.

279
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,916
We're talking about multiple days,

280
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,750
and he'll be under
higher pressure than usual.

281
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,375
- I can keep Martín under control...
- You can't!

282
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:58,416
- Because I've been doing it for years.
- You can't control him. He's an egomaniac.

283
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,333
He's obsessed with being in charge.

284
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,833
And that can only mean one thing.

285
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,916
If it's not him in charge, he'll do
anything he has to do to take control.

286
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,750
And he won't care if he has to execute,
betray or create chaos.

287
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:17,791
He's obsessive, egocentric,
trusts his instincts and is a true genius.

288
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:18,750
Like you.

289
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,375
If you prefer mediocre people,

290
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,791
you'll find plenty here.
They'll follow you like sheep.

291
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,715
Don't you understand
that being a genius complicates things?

292
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,958
He's dangerous
because we won't know what he'll do.

293
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,500
Listen to me. You're my brother.

294
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:33,500
I would put you in charge of any heist
without a shadow of a doubt.

295
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,291
But him...

296
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,500
You're wrong about trusting me
and not him. I'm much less reliable.

297
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,416
Two beers.

298
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,833
Don't order any more peanuts.

299
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,875
You're already fatter than an elephant.

300
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,541
If you laugh at my bow tie,

301
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,583
you're laughing at me.

302
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:03,791
And if you laugh at me, I assure you,

303
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,625
for the rest of your life,
you'll remember March 17th,

304
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,625
but you don't know why that is yet.

305
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,708
Isn't the anticipation just thrilling?

306
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:25,958
Is there a problem?

307
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:27,958
Not at all.

308
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,000
There's fingerprints
all over this place.

309
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The walls are covered with plans,

310
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,375
maps, diagrams.

311
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:44,625
They have an oven.

312
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:47,791
They likely used it
to get rid of evidence.

313
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,750
I'll take it for analysis.

314
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:03,666
I see traces of plastic,

315
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,791
possibly from an electronic device.

316
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:09,166
I'm gonna separate the melted parts.

317
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,750
I think I found something.

318
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,625
What's wrong?

319
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:19,916
Nothing.

320
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,041
So a Maserati, huh?

321
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:31,458
You've gotta be fucking kidding.
Is it out in the newspaper already?

322
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:32,666
It's totally fine.

323
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:39,309
- I can give you a ride, if you want.
- What the fuck are you saying, Tokyo?

324
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,166
No big deal.
Just a little ride. That's all.

325
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,250
That's all?

326
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:45,791
Then we push a button, erase the tape,

327
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:49,958
destroy the evidence,
and there's no record of anything.

328
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,291
Mónica dumped me.

329
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,083
I'm a free man.

330
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,166
So I don't need to erase
any fucking black box.

331
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,666
I'll take the Maserati,
stick my foot on the pedal,

332
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,458
and I'll start doing 360s
till the tires burn off...

333
00:23:14,541 --> 00:23:16,101
without a care in the world, beautiful.

334
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,041
Oh...

335
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:18,875
- a reckless driver?
- So reckless.

336
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,458
So reckless you better be careful,

337
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:23,916
or you'll have to take the car to the
mechanics and change the suspension.

338
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:26,708
And wait until you see what I do
to the chassis.

339
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:29,541
So scary.

340
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:48,458
This bastard
even leaves false clues in his shitter.

341
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,916
I bet it was put there on purpose.

342
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,351
By the way it was hidden
and melted at the back of the oven,

343
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:56,208
it's impossible
it was put there on purpose.

344
00:23:56,291 --> 00:23:57,291
So then?

345
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:00,708
The plastic from the chip
has a recorded number of up to 19 digits,

346
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,125
unique to each SIM card.

347
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,500
- Hm-mmm.
- This disappeared during the combustion,

348
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:08,416
but it seems that during the process,
it bent and touched the metallic chip,

349
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,583
and it imprinted seven numbers on it.

350
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:13,041
We crosschecked it
with data from several phone carriers,

351
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:17,666
and we came up with 354 cards
matching those end numbers.

352
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:22,583
One of them was bought three months ago
and has only made one call,

353
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:24,458
and it was made during the heist.

354
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:25,416
Bingo!

355
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
- Where was the call made?
- Wait, wait!

356
00:24:28,833 --> 00:24:30,083
A little bit of suspense.

357
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,750
Mindanao, the Philippines.

358
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,083
Oh, fuck! I knew it!

359
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,291
We'll talk with Interpol.

360
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:55,726
- Yes?
<i>- Mindanao, the Philippines.</i>

361
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,750
<i>They know.</i>

362
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,833
- How?
- A half-burnt SIM card in the ambulance.

363
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:14,666
This doesn't change anything for you.

364
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,666
I need you to get to that office now.

365
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,083
Show her the watch,
and tell her. "I'm with you."

366
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:22,541
That <i>I</i> am?
Should I say it like that?

367
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:23,833
Pardon?

368
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,916
<i>Like that: "I'm with you."
It might be confusing.</i>

369
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,458
She could think I'm just some weirdo,
or that I'm a communist.

370
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:30,583
<i>If I say, "The Professor is with you,"
it's clearer.</i>

371
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:32,458
"Is". In third person.

372
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:34,666
Benito, just show her the watch
and nothing more.

373
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,750
Understood.

374
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,458
Hostages out.

375
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,958
Everybody up and to the stairs!

376
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:49,541
How's being in charge, darling?
How are we feeling?

377
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:50,833
Magnificent.

378
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,833
Well, I'm all ears. Go ahead.

379
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:59,166
You have the following message
from the Professor:

380
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,375
"Lisbon is alive.

381
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,541
She's being held in the tent, and I need
you to think of a way to rescue her."

382
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:05,166
It's an order.

383
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:08,791
First, you stage a <i>coup d'état.</i>
Now you give me an order.

384
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:10,541
That's curious. I'd say that's...

385
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:15,708
very dangerous, but then again,
it's understandable, of course.

386
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:18,958
Look at them all.
The women are empowered.

387
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:22,541
That shit floats to the top

388
00:26:22,625 --> 00:26:24,583
- then back down the drain.
- All done?

389
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:28,500
What happened?

390
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:29,583
To me?

391
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:33,041
Are you angry with your mama?

392
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:37,000
She didn't breastfeed you enough? Hmm?

393
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:41,833
So you hate women
because... you need milk desperately?

394
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,750
Well...

395
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,500
this order came from the Professor.

396
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,875
And he has a dick, just like you.

397
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:10,375
They're in Mindanao.

398
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:14,208
In 24 hours, we'll have them.

399
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,416
You know how this goes.

400
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,750
Paula comes here,

401
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:21,000
you're declared guilty
of abducting your own child,

402
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:22,416
you lose your custody,

403
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,083
and she goes to live with her father.

404
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,666
So you're here to tell me I'm fucked?

405
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,958
I already know that.

406
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,416
It depends.

407
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:44,458
I'll let you call them.
Right here. Right now.

408
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,791
And you can lead them to safety.

409
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,708
When we get to your hideout in Mindanao,
they'll be gone.

410
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:51,083
We fucked up.

411
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:54,166
The thought of Paula
being with that bastard Alberto

412
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,375
doesn't thrill me either.

413
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:02,625
What's Paula doing right now?

414
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,375
Go on. Close your eyes. Picture her.

415
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:10,583
Tucked in bed.

416
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:13,750
Her hair across the blanket.
You can almost smell her.

417
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,625
Close your eyes.

418
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,375
Picture her.

419
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Go on.

420
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,500
What are you doing, Alicia?

421
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:29,625
It's only a five-year wait,
and then you'll be reunited again.

422
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,750
She comes running to you. "Mommy!"

423
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:34,666
She hugs you like this,
curled up around you,

424
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,041
with her arms and legs
like a little monkey.

425
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,458
And you press her against your chest...

426
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:43,583
and grab her little face...

427
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,416
to look at her.

428
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,875
But she won't let you go.

429
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:52,166
She repeats over and over,

430
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,125
like a prayer
that will save her from evil,

431
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:56,500
"Mama, don't leave me.

432
00:28:57,041 --> 00:28:58,625
Mama, don't leave me.

433
00:28:58,708 --> 00:28:59,958
Mama, don't leave me.

434
00:29:00,458 --> 00:29:01,916
Mama, don't leave.

435
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,833
Mama, don't leave me."

436
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,833
Raquel,

437
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:08,708
I know you love him, and he loves you too,

438
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:09,958
and because of that...

439
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,291
what do you think he would tell you to do?

440
00:29:18,583 --> 00:29:19,833
Did I offer you...

441
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:22,416
five years in prison?

442
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,083
I’ll trade it for five minutes.

443
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:30,208
I'm offering you freedom.

444
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:34,291
Sergio goes to jail, but you go free.

445
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:37,375
Your arrest was never official.

446
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:40,791
You call them, get them to safety.

447
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:43,333
In 24 hours, you'll all be together.

448
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:46,208
We'll never come after you.

449
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,000
Everything will be over.

450
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:40,125
Better?

451
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:41,708
Hm-mmm.

452
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,083
So?

453
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:55,333
Were you able to get any sleep?

454
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:58,916
I tried to, but I just can't do it.

455
00:31:01,666 --> 00:31:02,916
Are you having nightmares?

456
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,208
Every time I close my eyes,
I relive it all again.

457
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:22,458
So, what happened to the alpha male?

458
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:25,416
I thought you were a free man.

459
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:29,666
- What are they talking about?
- Oh!

460
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:32,083
Hello, beautiful.

461
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:34,583
I'd like to bring you to my island.

462
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,416
But only if you don't party all the time.

463
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:40,333
I'm not really into chunda-chunda
or dancing, you know?

464
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:46,875
If you invite me over,
I'll show you my tiny bikini.

465
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,916
Why didn't you tell us?

466
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,750
I couldn't.

467
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:59,500
You need to talk about it, Rio.
It’s important.

468
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:04,000
They took me out of my cell at night,

469
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,875
and forced me
to dig my own grave out in the desert.

470
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:14,166
I'm really really sweet, and...

471
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:17,083
that's why I'm smiling
the whole fucking day.

472
00:32:18,666 --> 00:32:21,125
Then they made me drag a coffin
in the hole I dug.

473
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,791
Then they forced me to get inside.

474
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:31,541
Then they threw sand into the hole.

475
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:35,416
Until I was buried.

476
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:40,125
And then they left me there.

477
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,041
In the darkness.

478
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:47,208
In the silence.

479
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:50,416
- I could barely breathe.
- Ssh.

480
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,416
Ssh.

481
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,541
Calm down.

482
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:55,958
Breathe.

483
00:32:58,541 --> 00:32:59,791
I'm here with you.

484
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,166
Do you know what I just kept thinking?

485
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,416
What?

486
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:08,500
That the Professor...

487
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:11,916
should be the one inside that coffin,
not me.

488
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,541
I'm sorry.

489
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:19,458
Look. Oh!

490
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:35,750
Okay, let's go.

491
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:56,291
Pardon me for a moment.
I'm going to the restroom.

492
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,750
You don't trust me.

493
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:14,333
I'm an egomaniac.

494
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:19,125
I'm only willing to follow my plan.

495
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:22,708
I'm so obsessed with being in charge

496
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:25,333
if something doesn’t go
according to my plan...

497
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:28,916
I could become dangerous, no?

498
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:35,833
That's right.

499
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:37,958
That's what I believe.

500
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:40,833
I'd agree.

501
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,833
But there's one thing
you're not considering.

502
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,333
Not only do I love your brother,

503
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:50,291
but I also love the plan,

504
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,166
and that love is equal.

505
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:54,791
I would betray you.
That's perfectly clear.

506
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,083
And the rest of the gang, too.

507
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:59,166
But the plan? Never.

508
00:35:00,416 --> 00:35:02,125
And that's where my loyalty lies.

509
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:07,291
This is so much more than a heist,
and you know it.

510
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:11,166
Right now, the plan isn't perfect.
I can recognize that.

511
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,958
It's an unfinished poem.

512
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:16,333
We need you, brother.

513
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:29,458
Please.

514
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,750
You were very brave out there.

515
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:52,250
And that's admirable.

516
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:56,791
Very commendable.

517
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,833
Just let me leave, please.

518
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,375
You seemed brave earlier,

519
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:19,750
but now you have to demonstrate
that bravery.

520
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:30,041
Let's have a look at those balls.

521
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:33,208
Ssh!

522
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,291
Hang in there.

523
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:39,750
Hang in there.
And tell me, what do you prefer?

524
00:36:41,291 --> 00:36:42,291
Death?

525
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:44,875
Look at me. Or impotence?

526
00:36:45,416 --> 00:36:47,517
Sometimes your forced
to make tough decisions in life.

527
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:50,750
Mine: what do I do with the asshole
who's making fun of my bow tie?

528
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,000
Yours:

529
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:54,291
is it even worth living without a penis?

530
00:37:01,875 --> 00:37:03,291
He's taking a long time.

531
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:06,208
He’s beating the shit out of the fat guy
in the bathroom.

532
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:09,083
I haven't heard any punches
or any other noise.

533
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:13,083
Real chaos, my dear Sergio,

534
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:15,791
makes no noise.

535
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:21,666
<i>Palermo was loyal to the plan,</i>

536
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:24,125
<i>but in his mind,
that only meant one thing.</i>

537
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:27,000
<i>For the heist to continue,</i>

538
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,125
<i>he had to be back in charge,</i>

539
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:33,208
<i>and to do that, he would quietly
create chaos we never saw coming.</i>

540
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:36,208
You know what you have to do.
Don't be a coward.

541
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:39,250
You have to dislocate the joint

542
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:42,958
between the trapezium
and the thumb's first metacarpal

543
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:45,291
with strength and determination

544
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:47,583
Grab your thumb and twist it.

545
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,208
- No handcuff can stop that.
- Ssh.

546
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,041
Do I have to sit you kids apart,
like in school?

547
00:38:00,458 --> 00:38:02,125
It'll hurt a tiny bit,

548
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:04,708
but your freedom will be worth it.
Don't you think?

549
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,416
Now do it.

550
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,500
Don't move!

551
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:51,125
- Don't move.
- Easy.

552
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:54,000
I'm just a fucking bodyguard.

553
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:55,958
On the ground.

554
00:38:57,666 --> 00:38:59,916
- I can't do that.
- I said on the ground.

555
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,125
What are you going to do?
Are you going to shoot an unarmed man?

556
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:07,500
I swear to God,
if I have to, I will shoot you.

557
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:11,250
You're gonna kill an unarmed father
with a family who is trying to escape?

558
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:15,375
Go on.

559
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:22,708
I'm right here.

560
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:23,958
Don't move.

561
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,041
Don't move!

562
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,625
On the ground, Gandía!
On the ground!

563
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,916
You're not gonna shoot.

564
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,458
On the ground!

565
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,291
Go on.

566
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,166
For fuck's sake, stop moving!

567
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:39,250
Stop moving!

568
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:47,208
See you soon.
