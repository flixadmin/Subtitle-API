1
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,839
Is it ready?

2
00:04:18,146 --> 00:04:20,898
<i>Hey! That's a great punch.</i>

3
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:09,197
Fear no good.
So emotion and control.

4
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:34,966
Breathe. Breathe.

5
00:05:43,317 --> 00:05:44,396
Wait.

6
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,297
Okay.

7
00:07:01,313 --> 00:07:04,434
I can make it work for a while,
but you need...

8
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:13,691
Okay. Okay.

9
00:07:30,343 --> 00:07:32,502
Shut that off! Turn it off!

10
00:07:36,183 --> 00:07:37,511
Watch out!

11
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:09,748
Okay!

12
00:09:35,514 --> 00:09:37,174
That's not right.

13
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,285
Oh, you.

14
00:10:12,969 --> 00:10:16,634
You see that? See that?
My ticket out of here.

15
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:52,816
Damn it!

16
00:12:56,887 --> 00:12:58,547
Here's something
a bit more interesting.

17
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:01,928
It's a possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee.

18
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,021
<i>A man drank one of those guarana sodas.</i>

19
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,559
<i>Guess it had a little more kick
than he was looking for.</i>

20
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:13,894
Wow.

21
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:20,243
- Where was it bottled?
- Porto Verde, Brazil.

22
00:13:20,537 --> 00:13:24,155
Have our people look for a white man
at the bottling plant.

23
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:27,617
Tell them no contact!
If he even sees them, he's gone!

24
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:51,812
I got you who I could.
Short notice, but they're all quality.

25
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,945
And I pulled you one ace.

26
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:03,370
Emil Blonsky.
Born in Russia, raised in England.

27
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:06,245
And on loan to SOCOM
from the Royal Marines.

28
00:14:12,048 --> 00:14:14,539
I know you
cashed in some chips for this, Joe.

29
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:17,588
Glad I could help. Just make it good.

30
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:30,812
This is the target and the location.
Snatch and grab, live capture.

31
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,810
You'll have your dart clips
and suppression ordnance,

32
00:14:32,902 --> 00:14:35,227
but live fire is for backup only.

33
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:37,943
We got local out there,
but we want it tight and quiet.

34
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:39,658
Is he a fighter?

35
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:43,987
Your target is a fugitive
from the US government

36
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:46,323
who stole military secrets.

37
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:50,995
He is also implicated
in the deaths of two scientists,

38
00:14:51,088 --> 00:14:54,920
a military officer, an Idaho state trooper
and possibly two Canadian hunters.

39
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:58,093
So don't wait to see if he's a fighter!

40
00:14:58,178 --> 00:15:01,013
Tranq him and bring him back.

41
00:15:42,682 --> 00:15:44,093
Oh, come on.

42
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:48,364
Camera.

43
00:16:51,045 --> 00:16:52,123
Here we go.

44
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,309
Get rid of the damn dog.

45
00:17:18,114 --> 00:17:19,193
Take him!

46
00:17:31,002 --> 00:17:32,829
Target's on the move.

47
00:17:41,555 --> 00:17:42,586
Where is he?

48
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:50,183
He's on the ground.

49
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:52,016
- Let's go!
- Go!

50
00:17:53,901 --> 00:17:54,932
Move, move!

51
00:18:16,507 --> 00:18:18,132
Go, go, go!

52
00:18:19,552 --> 00:18:21,046
Go! Go!

53
00:18:23,932 --> 00:18:25,724
Clear everyone out!

54
00:18:26,977 --> 00:18:28,139
Do not lose him!

55
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:15,226
Oh! No!

56
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,138
Get around behind him!

57
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:32,306
Target moving past mobile unit 0-9-0.

58
00:20:46,953 --> 00:20:48,198
Oh, no.

59
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,407
You got to be kidding me.

60
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,273
<i>- Where is he?
- Target acquired.</i>

61
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,293
Gringo!

62
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,805
Let's go.

63
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:10,611
No!

64
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:12,958
Please! No!

65
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,788
Not the computer!

66
00:22:16,962 --> 00:22:18,421
Gimme that! No!

67
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:40,145
You bad angry, G?
I very bad angry.

68
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,021
Oh, no.

69
00:22:46,326 --> 00:22:48,947
You don't understand! Something really bad
is about to happen here!

70
00:23:08,014 --> 00:23:10,007
Anybody else seeing this?

71
00:23:43,134 --> 00:23:45,043
We've got a bogey
of some kind. Please advice.

72
00:23:45,136 --> 00:23:48,091
That is the target!
Use every tranq you've got!

73
00:23:48,348 --> 00:23:49,723
<i>Do it now!</i>

74
00:23:57,358 --> 00:23:59,848
Go live! Go live! Go live!

75
00:23:59,943 --> 00:24:01,735
Move!
- Get out of the way!

76
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:03,394
No!

77
00:24:36,063 --> 00:24:38,519
It's behind us! Move! Move!

78
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:48,397
Get him!

79
00:24:50,037 --> 00:24:51,234
Shoot!

80
00:25:05,969 --> 00:25:08,210
Leave me alone.

81
00:26:19,503 --> 00:26:20,701
No! No!

82
00:26:33,101 --> 00:26:35,674
I knew something was different
before I got the shot off.

83
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,095
He had it on him when he bolted.

84
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:47,564
Is that a girlfriend? She helps him, maybe?

85
00:26:50,577 --> 00:26:53,447
She is no longer a factor.

86
00:26:53,538 --> 00:26:56,990
We closed that door to him a long time ago.
He's alone.

87
00:26:57,084 --> 00:27:01,128
He wants to be alone.
But see if he's been talking to anybody.

88
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:10,553
Forgive me, sir?

89
00:27:11,806 --> 00:27:15,057
Doesn't anybody want to talk
about what went down in there? 'Cause...

90
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,896
He didn't lose us.

91
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,764
And he was not alone, sir. We had him.

92
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:24,184
And then something hit us, something...

93
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:27,113
Something big hit us!

94
00:27:29,116 --> 00:27:32,402
It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball!

95
00:27:34,456 --> 00:27:38,073
It was the most powerful thing
I've ever seen.

96
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,584
Well, it's gone.

97
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,588
Well, if Banner knows what it is,

98
00:27:44,673 --> 00:27:47,794
I'm gonna track him down,
I'm gonna put my foot on his throat

99
00:27:47,885 --> 00:27:49,713
- and I'm gonna...
- That was Banner.

100
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,674
It

101
00:27:57,354 --> 00:27:58,729
was Banner.

102
00:27:59,022 --> 00:28:03,020
- You have to explain that statement, sir.
- No, I don't.

103
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:07,273
You've done a good job.

104
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,951
Pack up and get our men on a plane.
We're going home.

105
00:29:17,352 --> 00:29:18,515
Wait.

106
00:29:21,189 --> 00:29:22,435
Please.

107
00:29:29,698 --> 00:29:31,074
Where am I?

108
00:30:06,612 --> 00:30:09,697
I've run into bad situations
on crap missions before.

109
00:30:09,782 --> 00:30:10,896
I've seen good men go down

110
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:14,241
purely because someone didn't let us know
what we were walking into.

111
00:30:14,452 --> 00:30:16,694
I've moved on to the next one,
because that's what we do, right?

112
00:30:16,788 --> 00:30:18,164
I mean, that's the job.

113
00:30:18,248 --> 00:30:19,447
But this?

114
00:30:21,376 --> 00:30:24,128
This is a whole new level of weird.

115
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:27,084
And I don't feel inclined
to step away from it.

116
00:30:27,175 --> 00:30:30,210
So if you're taking another crack at him,
I want in.

117
00:30:30,302 --> 00:30:34,135
And, with respect, you should be looking
for a team that's prepped and ready to fight,

118
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:36,300
because if that thing shows up again,

119
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:41,099
you're gonna have a lot of professional
tough guys pissing in their pants.

120
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:42,846
Sir.

121
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:35,194
<i>Tienes más stretchy?</i>

122
00:31:36,913 --> 00:31:39,238
<i>Yeah. Perfecto.</i>

123
00:32:10,447 --> 00:32:12,736
Let me emphasise
that what I'm about to share with you

124
00:32:12,824 --> 00:32:16,157
is tremendously sensitive,
both to me personally and the Army.

125
00:32:18,997 --> 00:32:22,201
You're aware that we've got an
Infantry Weapons Development programme.

126
00:32:22,293 --> 00:32:26,919
Well, in WWII, they initiated a subprogram

127
00:32:27,006 --> 00:32:29,579
for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement.

128
00:32:29,675 --> 00:32:31,466
Yeah, Super Soldier.

129
00:32:33,929 --> 00:32:35,009
Yes.

130
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,097
An oversimplification, but yes.

131
00:32:38,935 --> 00:32:42,848
And I dusted it off, got 'em doing
serious work again, bold work.

132
00:32:42,938 --> 00:32:45,643
Across the hall,
they were trying to arm you better.

133
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:47,940
We were tryin' to make you better.

134
00:32:51,405 --> 00:32:56,697
Banner's work was very early phase.
It wasn't even weapons application.

135
00:32:56,787 --> 00:32:59,359
He thought he was working
on radiation resistance.

136
00:32:59,455 --> 00:33:02,659
I would never have told him
what the project really was.

137
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:07,377
But he was so sure of what he was onto,
that he tested it on himself.

138
00:33:07,464 --> 00:33:10,251
And something went very wrong.

139
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:14,593
Or it went very right.

140
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:19,510
As far as I'm concerned, that man's
whole body is the property of the US Army.

141
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:22,556
You said he wasn't working
on weapons, right?

142
00:33:22,646 --> 00:33:24,769
- No.
- But you were. You were, weren't you?

143
00:33:24,856 --> 00:33:26,849
You were trying other things.

144
00:33:26,942 --> 00:33:29,813
One serum we developed

145
00:33:31,072 --> 00:33:32,400
was very promising.

146
00:33:32,489 --> 00:33:35,111
- So why did he run?
- He's a scientist.

147
00:33:36,536 --> 00:33:38,327
He is not one of us.

148
00:33:41,624 --> 00:33:45,752
- Blonsky, how old are you? 45?
- 39.

149
00:33:46,504 --> 00:33:50,122
- It takes a toll, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.

150
00:33:50,215 --> 00:33:51,461
So get out of the trenches.

151
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:54,006
You should be a Colonel by now,
with your record.

152
00:33:54,095 --> 00:33:58,342
No, I'm a fighter.
I'll be one for as long as I can.

153
00:33:58,432 --> 00:34:01,636
You know, if I could take what I know now,
put it in the body I had ten years ago,

154
00:34:01,728 --> 00:34:04,480
that would be someone
I wouldn't want to fight.

155
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,354
I could probably arrange
something like that.

156
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:32,249
Take care, kids.

157
00:36:43,644 --> 00:36:45,020
Stan, I give you my word,

158
00:36:45,104 --> 00:36:46,811
whatever you've heard about me,
it's not true.

159
00:36:46,897 --> 00:36:50,064
Oh, I know it. I always knew it.

160
00:36:50,151 --> 00:36:52,902
I mean, you know how I felt about you two.

161
00:36:55,865 --> 00:36:58,736
- Have you talked to her?
- No.

162
00:36:58,827 --> 00:37:01,068
She doesn't know that I'm here.

163
00:37:02,872 --> 00:37:07,250
- She's with somebody?
- Yeah, he's a head shrink.

164
00:37:07,336 --> 00:37:10,751
They say he's one of the best.
But a really nice guy.

165
00:37:13,884 --> 00:37:15,676
Good. That's good.

166
00:37:15,761 --> 00:37:20,588
- Bruce, what can I do to help you?
- I could use a bed for a few nights.

167
00:37:20,682 --> 00:37:24,550
- You can have the spare room upstairs.
- That'd be so great.

168
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:28,601
There is one other thing.

169
00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:34,438
Excuse me. Pardon me.

170
00:37:36,031 --> 00:37:37,525
Coming through.

171
00:37:42,163 --> 00:37:44,073
Hey, pal. I got a delivery on five.

172
00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:46,492
I don't think there's anybody up there.

173
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:51,045
Oh, man. I'm gonna catch hell
if I don't collect. You got to let me try.

174
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:56,583
I'll tell you what. I got an extra medium.
Take it on the house.

175
00:38:03,476 --> 00:38:06,596
- You are the man.
- God bless you, brother.

176
00:38:09,149 --> 00:38:10,264
All right.

177
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:09,116
Okay.

178
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,033
We're pretty well closed here, folks.
I'm sorry.

179
00:40:25,121 --> 00:40:27,529
Oh, come on, Stan. It's Friday night.

180
00:40:28,709 --> 00:40:30,416
Oh, kids.

181
00:40:30,835 --> 00:40:33,078
I got nothing but marinara now.

182
00:40:33,171 --> 00:40:35,211
Oh, I got to have a Mister Pink, please.

183
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,506
She worked through dinner again,
of course.

184
00:40:45,226 --> 00:40:46,341
Stan?

185
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:52,099
And he... I go, "So, yeah,
I mean, where were you?

186
00:40:52,191 --> 00:40:54,231
"I can't... I don't know
where you were, Cecil."

187
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:56,809
And he goes, "Not where you been at."

188
00:40:56,904 --> 00:41:00,605
I thought, "Oh, my God." I just felt so awful.

189
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:29,597
Bruce?

190
00:41:36,195 --> 00:41:39,231
Betty? What's going on?

191
00:41:54,588 --> 00:41:55,703
Betty...

192
00:41:55,798 --> 00:41:58,882
Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw.

193
00:42:00,177 --> 00:42:03,879
- I don't know what to say.
- Please, just tell me the truth.

194
00:42:45,266 --> 00:42:47,888
Don't go. Don't go.

195
00:42:57,736 --> 00:42:59,693
I want you to come with me now.

196
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,987
Please. Come with me.

197
00:43:03,409 --> 00:43:04,654
Please.

198
00:43:34,774 --> 00:43:36,317
It's our data.

199
00:43:37,277 --> 00:43:40,279
I got in there before they carted it all away.

200
00:43:42,533 --> 00:43:46,198
I hoped somewhere that it might tell us
something someday.

201
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:53,200
- Does the General know that you have this?
- No, I don't think so.

202
00:43:53,293 --> 00:43:55,619
I haven't spoken to him in a couple of years.

203
00:43:55,713 --> 00:43:57,207
You have to be sure.

204
00:43:57,298 --> 00:44:02,339
Bruce, I don't understand why we can't
just go in there together and talk to him.

205
00:44:02,428 --> 00:44:07,386
He told me what he wanted to do.
He wants it out of me.

206
00:44:07,475 --> 00:44:10,725
He wants to dissect it
so that he can replicate it.

207
00:44:10,812 --> 00:44:12,971
He wants to make it a weapon.

208
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:06,231
- Hi.
- Hi.

209
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:11,284
- I thought you might want to...
- Thanks.

210
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:16,750
Listen, I should leave early,
as early as I can.

211
00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:20,254
Really? You can't stay at all?

212
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,675
I want to,
but it's just not safe for me to be here.

213
00:45:26,222 --> 00:45:28,974
- If I could borrow some cash...
- Of course.

214
00:45:29,058 --> 00:45:30,683
I need to take a bus.

215
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:33,474
Well, at least let me walk you to the station.

216
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,555
Okay.

217
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,895
- You have everything you need?
- Yeah.

218
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,156
I...

219
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,659
What?

220
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:54,116
- Good night.
- Good night.

221
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,202
I hope you get some rest.

222
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:40,960
We're giving you a very low dose only.

223
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,969
I need you sharp out there and disciplined.

224
00:46:44,052 --> 00:46:46,045
First sign of any side effect,

225
00:46:46,138 --> 00:46:49,804
we stop and you're off team
until you straighten out.

226
00:46:50,602 --> 00:46:52,344
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

227
00:46:56,273 --> 00:46:59,025
You'll get two separate infusions.

228
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:03,321
One into the deep muscle,
one into the bone marrow centres.

229
00:47:03,405 --> 00:47:05,694
The bone ones are going to hurt.

230
00:47:52,332 --> 00:47:54,074
Is everything okay?

231
00:47:56,042 --> 00:47:57,418
I think so.

232
00:48:05,803 --> 00:48:07,132
Come here.

233
00:48:08,806 --> 00:48:10,845
- I just wanna do this.
- Oh.

234
00:48:12,059 --> 00:48:14,099
- It's better like that.
- Yeah?

235
00:48:18,901 --> 00:48:20,394
It feels too tight, huh?

236
00:48:20,485 --> 00:48:22,276
- Yeah, a little.
- Okay.

237
00:48:29,744 --> 00:48:32,745
- What?
- They're here.

238
00:48:33,081 --> 00:48:34,492
- Betty, look at me, look at me!
- Bruce!

239
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:35,828
You have to go far away
from me as you can!

240
00:48:35,918 --> 00:48:37,411
- Don't argue with me, just go. Go!
- Bruce!

241
00:48:48,597 --> 00:48:50,720
Damn it! We'd have had snipers on target
in three more minutes.

242
00:48:50,808 --> 00:48:52,351
I wanna know who jumped the gun.

243
00:48:54,603 --> 00:48:55,801
He's heading 2-7-0.

244
00:49:12,955 --> 00:49:14,615
Blonsky! Not yet!

245
00:49:16,084 --> 00:49:17,247
Sir.

246
00:49:18,879 --> 00:49:20,503
Look alive. This could get interesting.

247
00:50:08,512 --> 00:50:09,592
I got him!

248
00:50:09,889 --> 00:50:12,973
Stop! Stop!

249
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:16,186
I know you're in there!

250
00:50:18,023 --> 00:50:19,647
General, please!

251
00:50:22,151 --> 00:50:23,183
Sir?

252
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:24,899
Dad!

253
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:36,499
- Dad, please don't do this.
- You can't see this clearly. Now, get inside.

254
00:50:36,583 --> 00:50:38,409
There he is!

255
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:40,708
<i>Target is in the overpass. We have a visual.</i>

256
00:50:40,795 --> 00:50:42,954
Do not engage! Repeat, do not engage!

257
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:50,221
He's locked in.

258
00:50:56,228 --> 00:50:57,771
Put two canisters in there with him.

259
00:50:58,396 --> 00:50:59,511
Fire!

260
00:51:18,626 --> 00:51:19,789
Get her back here!

261
00:51:54,288 --> 00:51:55,320
Now she'll see.

262
00:52:18,187 --> 00:52:19,302
Alpha team?

263
00:52:21,316 --> 00:52:22,395
Let him have all of it.

264
00:52:28,657 --> 00:52:30,150
Come on, light him up!

265
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:36,745
Where are the fifty cals? Move your asses!

266
00:53:24,922 --> 00:53:26,121
Oh, my God!

267
00:53:29,761 --> 00:53:30,792
Blonsky, now you're up!

268
00:53:31,513 --> 00:53:32,626
Sir?

269
00:53:33,806 --> 00:53:35,087
Cover me.

270
00:53:53,202 --> 00:53:54,696
Remember me?

271
00:54:14,682 --> 00:54:16,057
My God, he's doing it.

272
00:54:21,105 --> 00:54:22,434
Move him toward the cannons!

273
00:54:28,572 --> 00:54:29,651
Move!

274
00:54:43,169 --> 00:54:44,414
Hold your position!

275
00:54:44,504 --> 00:54:45,833
Do it now!

276
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:13,241
Please, please, please, no!

277
00:55:13,325 --> 00:55:14,736
- Please, please, please!
- Get her back!

278
00:55:14,827 --> 00:55:15,859
You're killing him!

279
00:55:15,954 --> 00:55:18,278
Stop! Get off of me!

280
00:55:18,372 --> 00:55:19,783
Bruce!

281
00:55:22,878 --> 00:55:26,792
Bruce! Bruce!

282
00:55:56,162 --> 00:55:57,194
Where's the gunship?

283
00:56:17,393 --> 00:56:18,471
Is that it?

284
00:56:18,685 --> 00:56:20,477
Blonsky, pull back now.

285
00:56:20,562 --> 00:56:21,843
<i>Pull back!</i>

286
00:56:24,984 --> 00:56:26,775
Is that all you got?

287
00:56:34,326 --> 00:56:36,899
- Fall back!
- Fall back! Let's go, let's go!

288
00:56:36,995 --> 00:56:38,371
Find cover!

289
00:56:42,376 --> 00:56:43,574
Betty!

290
00:56:57,058 --> 00:56:58,553
Fire, goddamn it!

291
00:57:00,354 --> 00:57:01,551
Bruce?

292
00:57:14,743 --> 00:57:15,941
Stop firing!

293
00:57:29,508 --> 00:57:30,919
No!

294
00:58:21,061 --> 00:58:23,599
You did the right thing, calling us.

295
00:58:25,733 --> 00:58:28,650
I need to know where they're going.

296
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,894
She'll be in incredible danger
as long as she's with him.

297
00:58:30,988 --> 00:58:32,269
From who?

298
00:58:33,157 --> 00:58:35,778
He protected her. You almost killed her.

299
00:58:35,868 --> 00:58:39,616
I give you my word, her safety
is my main concern at this point.

300
00:58:39,705 --> 00:58:42,410
You know, it's a point
of professional pride with me

301
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,417
that I can always tell
when somebody's lying.

302
00:58:45,752 --> 00:58:46,832
And you are.

303
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:50,372
I don't know where he's going.

304
00:58:51,342 --> 00:58:55,506
- I know she'll help him, if she can.
- Then she's aiding a fugitive.

305
00:58:56,806 --> 00:58:59,344
And I can't help either one of them.

306
00:59:04,397 --> 00:59:07,481
I used to wonder
why she never talked about you.

307
00:59:07,859 --> 00:59:09,234
Now I know!

308
00:59:14,157 --> 00:59:16,482
Where does she meet these guys?

309
01:00:06,001 --> 01:00:07,164
Bruce?

310
01:00:17,389 --> 01:00:18,552
Bruce.

311
01:00:38,743 --> 01:00:40,902
It's okay. It's okay.

312
01:00:54,052 --> 01:00:56,803
Come here. Come this way.

313
01:01:00,016 --> 01:01:01,641
Watch your head.

314
01:01:16,741 --> 01:01:17,856
Okay.

315
01:01:28,671 --> 01:01:29,834
We're okay.

316
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,136
It's okay.

317
01:01:37,971 --> 01:01:39,679
It's just the rain.

318
01:01:48,941 --> 01:01:51,147
Will he ever walk again?

319
01:01:51,235 --> 01:01:54,818
Most of the bones in his body
look like crushed gravel right now.

320
01:01:54,906 --> 01:01:58,690
I will say this for him.
He's got a heart like a machine.

321
01:01:58,784 --> 01:02:01,988
Never seen anything like it,
outside of a racehorse.

322
01:03:04,561 --> 01:03:05,676
Here.

323
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:08,392
Okay.

324
01:03:49,065 --> 01:03:50,262
Bruce?

325
01:03:51,775 --> 01:03:53,020
Oh, hi.

326
01:03:53,611 --> 01:03:54,726
Are you okay?

327
01:03:55,363 --> 01:03:56,478
Yeah.

328
01:03:56,698 --> 01:03:58,939
Yeah, actually, I feel a lot better.

329
01:03:59,033 --> 01:04:01,607
- Good.
- I just had to get my data back.

330
01:04:03,163 --> 01:04:04,277
You ate it?

331
01:04:04,372 --> 01:04:08,619
Well, you know, the circumstances
called for a little improvisation.

332
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:09,788
Wow.

333
01:04:11,295 --> 01:04:15,625
Okay, so they didn't have a great selection,
but I got you some options.

334
01:04:15,717 --> 01:04:18,290
First thing's first.

335
01:04:18,386 --> 01:04:20,011
Oh, you're kidding me.

336
01:04:30,274 --> 01:04:31,389
What?

337
01:04:31,984 --> 01:04:34,819
- No.
- They were the stretchiest pair they had.

338
01:04:34,903 --> 01:04:36,232
I'll take my chances.

339
01:04:36,447 --> 01:04:38,938
<i>Rumours continue
to swirl about a violent clash</i>

340
01:04:39,033 --> 01:04:42,816
<i>between forces of the US military
and an unknown adversary</i>

341
01:04:42,911 --> 01:04:45,865
<i>on the campus of Culver University
earlier today.</i>

342
01:04:45,956 --> 01:04:49,207
<i>Sophomores Jack McGhee and Jim Wilson
witnessed some of the battle.</i>

343
01:04:49,293 --> 01:04:50,751
<i>It was so big.</i>

344
01:04:50,836 --> 01:04:53,707
<i>- It was like this huge, like, hulk!
- Yeah.</i>

345
01:04:53,797 --> 01:04:56,834
<i>McGhee, who happens
to be a reporter for the campus paper,</i>

346
01:04:56,926 --> 01:04:58,634
<i>captured this on his cell phone.</i>

347
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,427
<i>Further search for the mysterious "hulk"</i>

348
01:05:00,513 --> 01:05:05,010
<i>was postponed by powerful thunderstorms
in the Smoky Mountain National Forest.</i>

349
01:05:12,525 --> 01:05:15,479
Not too short back there.

350
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:18,025
I have done this before, you know.

351
01:05:33,923 --> 01:05:36,496
I don't know how you've done this
on your own for all this time.

352
01:05:36,592 --> 01:05:38,501
With clippers, usually.

353
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:36,063
- Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
- What? What?

354
01:06:36,153 --> 01:06:37,528
We can't do this.

355
01:06:37,613 --> 01:06:39,689
- It's okay. I want to.
- No.

356
01:06:40,741 --> 01:06:41,820
No.

357
01:06:42,993 --> 01:06:44,237
I can't.

358
01:06:47,789 --> 01:06:49,782
I can't get too excited.

359
01:06:52,502 --> 01:06:54,579
Not even a little excited?

360
01:06:57,258 --> 01:06:58,633
It's okay.

361
01:07:03,306 --> 01:07:05,180
Sir, it's Blonsky.

362
01:07:07,686 --> 01:07:10,603
Has anyone found out
if he has next of kin or family?

363
01:07:11,397 --> 01:07:13,057
Ask him yourself.

364
01:07:16,861 --> 01:07:17,941
Sir?

365
01:07:38,133 --> 01:07:42,132
- Good to see you back on your feet, soldier.
- Thank you, sir.

366
01:07:49,102 --> 01:07:50,348
How do you feel?

367
01:07:52,314 --> 01:07:54,722
Pissed off and ready for round three.

368
01:08:01,157 --> 01:08:05,155
Basically, we can't use any of this,
because they can track all of it.

369
01:08:05,244 --> 01:08:08,032
Well, my lip gloss? Can they track that?

370
01:08:08,999 --> 01:08:12,118
- No. You can take your lip gloss.
- Thank you.

371
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:15,127
- Well, I need my glasses.
- Well, you can take

372
01:08:15,212 --> 01:08:16,375
- your glasses and your watch, okay?
- Okay.

373
01:08:16,464 --> 01:08:20,082
We can use most of it. We just can't use
the credit cards, the ID or the phone.

374
01:08:20,176 --> 01:08:22,465
- Don't even turn that on.
- Okay.

375
01:08:22,595 --> 01:08:24,718
And we'll take the cash, obviously.

376
01:08:24,806 --> 01:08:28,720
How will we get where we need to go
on $40 and no credit cards?

377
01:08:31,772 --> 01:08:34,643
Well, we could sell this.

378
01:08:34,733 --> 01:08:38,268
No. No, that's the only thing
you have left from her. No.

379
01:08:40,489 --> 01:08:43,193
Well, we'll have to try and get it back.

380
01:08:43,867 --> 01:08:45,776
Federal is
already monitoring phones,

381
01:08:45,868 --> 01:08:48,111
plastic and Dr Ross's web accounts,

382
01:08:48,204 --> 01:08:50,447
and local PD have been placed on alert.

383
01:08:50,541 --> 01:08:53,210
They'll pop up somewhere
and when they do, it comes straight to us.

384
01:08:53,294 --> 01:08:55,250
They're not gonna just pop up.

385
01:08:55,337 --> 01:08:58,374
He made it five years and got across borders
without making any mistakes.

386
01:08:58,466 --> 01:09:00,293
He's not gonna use a damn credit card now.

387
01:09:00,718 --> 01:09:02,462
<i>If he was trying to escape,
he'd be long gone.</i>

388
01:09:02,554 --> 01:09:03,716
<i>He's not trying to escape this time.</i>

389
01:09:03,804 --> 01:09:06,296
<i>He's looking for help
and that's how we're gonna get him.</i>

390
01:09:06,391 --> 01:09:08,799
<i>We know what they're after and we know
he's been talking to somebody.</i>

391
01:09:08,893 --> 01:09:10,721
<i>You all have copies of the correspondence.</i>

392
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,268
<i>The aliases Mr Green and Mr Blue</i>

393
01:09:13,356 --> 01:09:15,478
<i>have been added to the
SHIELD Operations Database.</i>

394
01:09:16,484 --> 01:09:18,192
<i>If he comes up for air, we'll be waiting.</i>

395
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:21,651
<i>If he makes a peep, we'll hear him.</i>

396
01:09:21,739 --> 01:09:24,147
<i>And when he slips up, we'll be ready.</i>

397
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,151
Hey.

398
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:11,196
Smile.

399
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,294
What is it like?

400
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,973
When it happens, what do you experience?

401
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:31,298
Remember those experiments
we volunteered for at Harvard?

402
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,470
Those induced hallucinations?

403
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:37,647
It's a lot like that,
just a thousand times amplified.

404
01:10:39,486 --> 01:10:43,401
It's like someone's poured
a litre of acid into my brain.

405
01:10:43,491 --> 01:10:48,317
- Do you remember anything?
- Just fragments. Images.

406
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:51,995
There's too much noise.
I can never derive anything out of it.

407
01:10:52,082 --> 01:10:55,665
- But then it's still you inside it.
- No. No, it's not.

408
01:10:58,088 --> 01:11:02,252
I don't know.
In the cave, I really felt like it knew me.

409
01:11:03,011 --> 01:11:04,422
Maybe your mind is in there,

410
01:11:04,511 --> 01:11:07,133
it's just overcharged
and can't process what's happening.

411
01:11:07,223 --> 01:11:10,509
I don't want to control it.
I want to get rid of it.

412
01:11:23,739 --> 01:11:25,198
Are you ready?

413
01:11:25,283 --> 01:11:27,026
Let's even the playing field a little.

414
01:11:30,455 --> 01:11:31,735
Gentlemen.

415
01:11:35,711 --> 01:11:39,375
Bruce, wake up.
There's something going on.

416
01:11:50,475 --> 01:11:53,512
We got to go. Walk toward the back.
Just don't move too fast.

417
01:12:08,995 --> 01:12:10,620
All right. Come.

418
01:12:24,427 --> 01:12:28,757
It is a long way uptown.
I think the subway's probably quickest.

419
01:12:29,641 --> 01:12:31,550
Me in a metal tube, deep underground,

420
01:12:31,642 --> 01:12:34,098
with hundreds of people
in the most aggressive city in the world?

421
01:12:34,187 --> 01:12:36,857
Right. Let's get a cab.

422
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:41,151
Come on, now! Let's go!
You're too slow! You drive like a woman!

423
01:12:46,075 --> 01:12:47,652
- Very nice. You see her?
- Oh, my.

424
01:12:47,743 --> 01:12:50,862
Very pretty. Watch out, you goat!

425
01:12:50,954 --> 01:12:52,994
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

426
01:12:56,293 --> 01:12:58,962
Are you out of your mind?

427
01:12:59,046 --> 01:13:00,374
- What is wrong with you?
- What's the matter, baby?

428
01:13:00,464 --> 01:13:02,172
You don't like a good ride?

429
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:05,255
Asshole!

430
01:13:08,389 --> 01:13:10,880
You know, I know a few
techniques could help you

431
01:13:10,975 --> 01:13:15,186
- manage that anger very effectively.
- You zip it. We're walking.

432
01:13:15,605 --> 01:13:16,636
Okay.

433
01:13:24,196 --> 01:13:26,154
Excuse me. Dr Sterns?

434
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,779
- Yes.
- I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Elizabeth Ross.

435
01:13:29,703 --> 01:13:31,695
Oh! Dr Ross!

436
01:13:31,788 --> 01:13:34,705
- I have someone who'd like to meet you.
- Okay.

437
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:38,669
It's Mr Blue, isn't it?

438
01:13:40,506 --> 01:13:41,880
Mr Green?

439
01:13:44,134 --> 01:13:47,799
I got to tell you,
I've been wondering if you were even real.

440
01:13:47,888 --> 01:13:49,631
And if you were, what would it look like?

441
01:13:49,722 --> 01:13:54,385
A person with that much
power lurking in him.

442
01:13:54,478 --> 01:13:56,102
Nothing could have surprised me more

443
01:13:56,188 --> 01:13:59,058
than this unassuming man
shaking my hand.

444
01:13:59,149 --> 01:14:01,819
But, look. We're not strolling
into the park for a picnic, here.

445
01:14:01,902 --> 01:14:03,562
Even if everything goes perfectly,

446
01:14:03,654 --> 01:14:07,486
if we induce an episode,
if we get the dosage exactly right,

447
01:14:08,492 --> 01:14:10,402
is that going to be a lasting cure

448
01:14:10,494 --> 01:14:13,829
or just some antidote to suppress
that specific flare-up?

449
01:14:16,125 --> 01:14:17,584
I don't know.

450
01:14:18,335 --> 01:14:23,045
What I'm saying is that if we overshoot this
by even the smallest integer

451
01:14:24,008 --> 01:14:28,884
we're dealing with concentrations
with extraordinary levels of toxicity.

452
01:14:28,971 --> 01:14:33,514
- You mean it could kill him.
- Kill him? Yeah. I should say so.

453
01:14:35,228 --> 01:14:37,351
You should know that there's
a flip side to this, too.

454
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,974
If we miss on the low side,
if we induce me and it fails,

455
01:14:41,068 --> 01:14:43,523
this will be very dangerous for you.

456
01:14:45,322 --> 01:14:49,366
Look. I've always been
more curious than cautious,

457
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:53,698
and that's served me pretty well.
So, are we going to do this?

458
01:15:48,763 --> 01:15:50,386
How you feeling, man?

459
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,717
Like a monster.

460
01:16:13,621 --> 01:16:15,365
Okay. On the table.

461
01:16:16,124 --> 01:16:21,497
These will protect you from yourself
if you have a strong reaction.

462
01:16:22,755 --> 01:16:25,709
You can tell me later
if you thought it was strong.

463
01:16:29,929 --> 01:16:34,342
Oh, come on! Stupid graduate students.

464
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:40,095
Okay...

465
01:16:40,691 --> 01:16:42,150
You, you, you.

466
01:16:43,777 --> 01:16:47,229
This will be a somewhat novel sensation.

467
01:16:49,909 --> 01:16:51,402
We have begun.

468
01:16:53,244 --> 01:16:56,281
The dialysis machine will mix the antidote
with your blood.

469
01:16:56,373 --> 01:17:00,834
Except the antidote will only take hold
once we've achieved a full reaction.

470
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,081
Just relax.

471
01:17:02,838 --> 01:17:06,172
Okay. We are comprehensive.

472
01:17:09,387 --> 01:17:10,845
Here you go.

473
01:17:20,856 --> 01:17:22,849
All right. We set to pop?

474
01:17:25,361 --> 01:17:27,519
I'd take your hands off him.

475
01:17:47,342 --> 01:17:49,382
Oh, my God!

476
01:18:03,483 --> 01:18:05,523
Wait, wait! There's more! Wait!

477
01:18:16,331 --> 01:18:18,904
- Now. Okay, now!
- Wait.

478
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,572
Now, do it! Do it!

479
01:18:29,093 --> 01:18:31,584
Bruce! Bruce, look at me.

480
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:36,176
Stay with me. The antidote, now!
Sterns, do it now!

481
01:18:37,643 --> 01:18:41,642
Bruce, look at me. Look in my eyes.
Please, look in my eyes.

482
01:18:42,858 --> 01:18:45,266
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

483
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,078
Bruce.

484
01:19:06,173 --> 01:19:07,548
Oh, my God.

485
01:19:18,937 --> 01:19:21,937
Bruce? Bruce, can you hear me?

486
01:19:25,985 --> 01:19:27,148
Bruce?

487
01:19:35,996 --> 01:19:39,364
It's okay. You're okay. You're okay.

488
01:19:42,794 --> 01:19:44,170
You did it.

489
01:19:44,338 --> 01:19:47,006
He's fine. This is fantastic.

490
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:48,419
It's over.

491
01:19:49,343 --> 01:19:50,422
Hi.

492
01:19:50,761 --> 01:19:51,876
Hi.

493
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:06,183
That was the most extraordinary thing
I have seen in my entire life!

494
01:20:06,276 --> 01:20:07,854
Okay, you know what? Stop, please.

495
01:20:07,945 --> 01:20:10,317
We need to go back and talk
about what just happened in there.

496
01:20:10,406 --> 01:20:14,190
Absolutely. Okay. The gamma pulse
came from the amygdala.

497
01:20:14,285 --> 01:20:16,028
- I think Dr Ross's primer...
- Are you okay?

498
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:19,371
...lets the cells absorb the energy
temporarily, and then it abates.

499
01:20:19,457 --> 01:20:22,244
That's why you didn't die
of radiation sickness years ago!

500
01:20:22,335 --> 01:20:25,039
Now, maybe we've neutralised
those cells permanently,

501
01:20:25,129 --> 01:20:27,038
or maybe we just suppressed that event.

502
01:20:27,131 --> 01:20:29,457
I'm inclined to think the latter,
but it's hard to know

503
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:31,341
because none of our
test subjects ever survived.

504
01:20:31,427 --> 01:20:33,051
- Of course, they weren't getting the primer!
- Wait, wait.

505
01:20:33,137 --> 01:20:34,548
- Wait, what did you just say?
- They weren't getting

506
01:20:34,639 --> 01:20:37,177
- the myostatin primer...
- No, no, no. Test subjects?

507
01:20:38,226 --> 01:20:39,969
What test subjects?

508
01:20:40,687 --> 01:20:41,718
Come with me.

509
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:02,745
- What's the activity level?
- Snipers are covering Alpha sector.

510
01:21:03,585 --> 01:21:04,995
<i>We started on rats and mice,</i>

511
01:21:05,086 --> 01:21:07,660
<i>but it just completely fried them,
so we had to go bigger.</i>

512
01:21:07,923 --> 01:21:11,043
And we still don't know which is more toxic,
the gamma or your blood.

513
01:21:11,135 --> 01:21:14,883
- What do you mean, my blood?
- Bruce, this is all you.

514
01:21:15,723 --> 01:21:19,721
You didn't send me much to work with,
so I had to concentrate it and make more.

515
01:21:19,811 --> 01:21:23,061
With a little more trial and error,
there's no end to what we can do!

516
01:21:23,147 --> 01:21:26,847
This is potentially Olympian!

517
01:21:26,942 --> 01:21:30,442
This gamma technology
has limitless applications.

518
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:32,569
We'll unlock hundreds of cures.

519
01:21:32,656 --> 01:21:35,777
We will make humans
impervious to disease!

520
01:21:49,966 --> 01:21:51,627
No, no, we've got to destroy it.

521
01:21:52,094 --> 01:21:53,968
- Wait, what?
- All of it.

522
01:21:54,096 --> 01:21:55,471
Tonight. We're gonna incinerate it.

523
01:21:55,555 --> 01:21:57,796
- Is this the whole supply?
- What...

524
01:21:57,890 --> 01:21:59,433
We could get the Nobel for this!

525
01:21:59,517 --> 01:22:01,724
You don't understand
the power of this thing.

526
01:22:01,811 --> 01:22:04,433
It is too dangerous. It cannot be controlled.

527
01:22:05,107 --> 01:22:06,600
At your discretion, shooter.

528
01:22:06,691 --> 01:22:08,150
<i>three of us!
This is Promethean fire!</i>

529
01:22:08,235 --> 01:22:09,266
<i>It's just...</i>

530
01:22:09,361 --> 01:22:10,606
<i>No shot.</i>

531
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:15,740
Blonsky's going in.

532
01:22:17,953 --> 01:22:20,825
<i>Blonsky, stand down.
My daughter's in there!</i>

533
01:22:23,417 --> 01:22:24,497
We have the antidote now.

534
01:22:24,585 --> 01:22:27,420
They don't want the antidote!
They want to make it a weapon!

535
01:22:34,303 --> 01:22:36,296
And if we let it go, we will never get it back.

536
01:22:36,514 --> 01:22:38,554
<i>You don't know how powerful this thing is.</i>

537
01:22:38,641 --> 01:22:40,633
I hate the government
just as much as anyone,

538
01:22:40,726 --> 01:22:42,518
but you're being a little paranoid,
don't you think?

539
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,814
Bruce! Bruce!

540
01:22:53,532 --> 01:22:54,777
Get out.

541
01:22:58,035 --> 01:23:00,787
Where is it? Come on, where is it?

542
01:23:05,002 --> 01:23:06,661
Show him to me.

543
01:23:08,171 --> 01:23:09,452
Blonsky!

544
01:23:17,932 --> 01:23:19,011
Miss!

545
01:23:20,518 --> 01:23:21,894
Take this.

546
01:23:25,523 --> 01:23:30,101
If you took it from me, I'm gonna
put you in a hole for the rest of your life.

547
01:23:35,866 --> 01:23:37,029
Betty.

548
01:23:38,995 --> 01:23:41,995
I will never forgive what you've done to him.

549
01:23:42,081 --> 01:23:43,410
He's a fugitive.

550
01:23:43,499 --> 01:23:45,457
You made him a fugitive

551
01:23:45,543 --> 01:23:49,043
to cover your failures
and to protect your career.

552
01:23:49,839 --> 01:23:52,675
Don't ever speak to me
as your daughter again.

553
01:23:54,928 --> 01:23:58,427
It's only because you're my daughter
that you're not in handcuffs, too.

554
01:24:03,353 --> 01:24:04,551
Are you telling me
you can make more like him?

555
01:24:04,646 --> 01:24:09,391
No! Not yet. I sorted out a few pieces,
but it's not like I can put together

556
01:24:09,484 --> 01:24:12,818
the same Humpty Dumpty,
if that's what you're asking.

557
01:24:12,905 --> 01:24:16,772
He was a freak accident!
The goal is to do it better!

558
01:24:16,867 --> 01:24:18,776
So Banner's the only...

559
01:24:22,582 --> 01:24:26,993
- She's an annoying bitch.
- Why are you always hitting people?

560
01:24:29,421 --> 01:24:34,498
Now what possibly could I have done
to deserve such aggression?

561
01:24:34,593 --> 01:24:37,298
It's not what you've done.
It's what you're gonna do.

562
01:24:38,264 --> 01:24:40,720
I want what you got out of Banner.
I want that.

563
01:24:44,228 --> 01:24:48,274
You look like you've got a little
something in you already, don't you?

564
01:24:49,610 --> 01:24:53,227
I want more.
You've seen what he becomes, right?

565
01:24:53,947 --> 01:24:55,145
I have.

566
01:24:56,116 --> 01:24:57,658
And it's beautiful.

567
01:24:58,493 --> 01:24:59,737
Godlike.

568
01:24:59,952 --> 01:25:01,660
Well, I want that.

569
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:05,908
I need that. Make me that.

570
01:25:06,793 --> 01:25:09,794
I don't know what you've got
inside you already.

571
01:25:09,879 --> 01:25:11,457
The mix could be

572
01:25:12,090 --> 01:25:13,633
an abomination.

573
01:25:17,304 --> 01:25:20,139
I didn't say I was unwilling.

574
01:25:20,683 --> 01:25:24,432
I just need informed consent.

575
01:25:26,939 --> 01:25:28,730
And you've given it.

576
01:26:09,858 --> 01:26:14,105
This is what I was trying to explain.

577
01:26:14,196 --> 01:26:19,107
I don't know what you've been
ladling into yourself.

578
01:26:19,201 --> 01:26:21,277
But clearly it worked.

579
01:26:21,370 --> 01:26:24,989
Let's assume you don't understand
a word I'm saying,

580
01:26:25,083 --> 01:26:29,909
but if you'll just get back on the table,

581
01:26:30,003 --> 01:26:32,495
I can fix this.

582
01:26:47,397 --> 01:26:49,105
Shoot it!
- Hey!

583
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:50,979
No!

584
01:27:00,577 --> 01:27:02,616
Delta 4 to Leader.

585
01:27:02,703 --> 01:27:04,447
They took out two of our guys,
two of our guys!

586
01:27:04,539 --> 01:27:07,244
Blonsky and the Major are still inside!

587
01:27:10,128 --> 01:27:12,417
Come on! Move, move, move, move!

588
01:27:20,389 --> 01:27:21,967
It's over there!

589
01:27:23,768 --> 01:27:24,931
Drop them!

590
01:27:25,019 --> 01:27:27,260
What is that thing?
- Shoot it!

591
01:27:36,738 --> 01:27:40,523
Okay. All right! You... You, drive!
Let's go! Move, move!

592
01:27:40,618 --> 01:27:41,947
Delta 4 to Leader!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

593
01:27:42,036 --> 01:27:43,946
Something big
just went off down here!

594
01:27:44,497 --> 01:27:46,620
General, you should hear this!

595
01:27:46,707 --> 01:27:49,625
The Hulk is in the street!
I repeat, the Hulk is in the street!

596
01:27:52,214 --> 01:27:54,289
That's impossible.
You get a hold of yourself, young man.

597
01:27:54,382 --> 01:27:56,292
You get it together. What is your position?

598
01:27:56,551 --> 01:27:59,672
121st Street, heading north on Broadway!

599
01:27:59,762 --> 01:28:01,305
Turn us around.

600
01:28:08,271 --> 01:28:11,474
We're going back. Why are we going back?

601
01:28:11,566 --> 01:28:13,191
Damn it! Give me eyes down there!

602
01:28:13,610 --> 01:28:14,891
Yes, sir!

603
01:28:16,905 --> 01:28:18,815
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

604
01:28:19,158 --> 01:28:20,782
Go, go, go!

605
01:28:44,350 --> 01:28:45,595
No!

606
01:29:01,868 --> 01:29:03,196
One of yours?

607
01:29:03,452 --> 01:29:06,537
Oh, my God. What have you done?

608
01:29:08,875 --> 01:29:10,702
Fire at him, fire at him!

609
01:29:15,048 --> 01:29:17,125
Do you think a rifle's gonna hurt that?

610
01:29:17,551 --> 01:29:18,796
Come on!

611
01:29:22,306 --> 01:29:23,468
Sweet.

612
01:29:26,394 --> 01:29:27,592
Booyah!

613
01:29:45,622 --> 01:29:46,949
Get out of there, soldier!

614
01:29:50,293 --> 01:29:51,918
Stacy!

615
01:30:22,576 --> 01:30:24,485
Give me a real fight!

616
01:30:32,586 --> 01:30:33,748
Sir?

617
01:30:36,423 --> 01:30:37,538
Sir?

618
01:30:39,092 --> 01:30:42,094
Tell them to bring everything they've got
and head for Harlem.

619
01:30:45,475 --> 01:30:48,926
It has to be me.
You have to take me back there.

620
01:30:49,270 --> 01:30:50,812
What are you saying?

621
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:52,261
You think you can control it?

622
01:30:52,357 --> 01:30:55,477
No, no, not control it,
but, I don't know, maybe aim it.

623
01:30:55,569 --> 01:30:57,027
And what if you can't?

624
01:30:58,571 --> 01:31:00,315
We made this thing.

625
01:31:00,824 --> 01:31:02,153
All of us.

626
01:31:03,159 --> 01:31:04,357
Please.

627
01:31:09,332 --> 01:31:11,824
- Land us near it.
- No, no. No, keep us high.

628
01:31:13,419 --> 01:31:14,748
Open the back door.

629
01:31:20,511 --> 01:31:25,386
Bruce! Bruce, stop!
Stop! What are you doing?

630
01:31:25,474 --> 01:31:29,175
Think about this!
You don't even know if you'll change!

631
01:31:31,188 --> 01:31:34,391
You don't have to do this!
Please, this is insane!

632
01:31:34,483 --> 01:31:36,226
Betty, I've got to try.

633
01:31:38,404 --> 01:31:39,732
I'm sorry.

634
01:32:02,387 --> 01:32:04,047
Oh, shit!

635
01:32:08,059 --> 01:32:10,894
- Get her in here!
- Come on, miss.

636
01:32:28,331 --> 01:32:30,370
There. Betty!

637
01:32:49,435 --> 01:32:50,977
Hulk!

638
01:32:55,775 --> 01:32:57,484
Yeah!

639
01:33:41,738 --> 01:33:42,983
Come on!

640
01:34:15,232 --> 01:34:17,188
Is that all you've got?

641
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:33,702
Use that thing, soldier! Give him some help!

642
01:34:33,792 --> 01:34:35,037
Which one?

643
01:34:35,127 --> 01:34:37,452
Help the green one, damn it!
Which one do you think?

644
01:34:37,546 --> 01:34:39,373
Cut the other one in half!

645
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:43,213
Ross!

646
01:35:07,994 --> 01:35:09,737
Keep it on him!

647
01:35:37,941 --> 01:35:40,942
Look, I got to put it down!
- Hang on!

648
01:36:48,180 --> 01:36:49,295
Dad?

649
01:36:51,935 --> 01:36:54,425
Are you hurt? Let me help you.

650
01:37:02,195 --> 01:37:04,069
I'm all right. Just find a way out.

651
01:37:51,913 --> 01:37:58,580
You don't deserve this power!
Now watch her die!

652
01:38:49,304 --> 01:38:50,965
Look out!

653
01:39:21,796 --> 01:39:23,041
General?

654
01:39:29,304 --> 01:39:31,878
Any last words?

655
01:39:34,685 --> 01:39:38,101
Hulk smash!

656
01:40:25,654 --> 01:40:27,232
Stop!

657
01:41:47,988 --> 01:41:49,316
It's okay.

658
01:41:59,458 --> 01:42:01,118
Betty.

659
01:44:29,154 --> 01:44:30,482
Reload.

660
01:44:38,038 --> 01:44:39,236
Reload.

661
01:44:55,264 --> 01:44:58,431
The smell of stale beer and defeat.

662
01:44:58,518 --> 01:45:00,260
You know, I hate to say,
"I told you so," General,

663
01:45:00,352 --> 01:45:04,766
but that Super Soldier programme
was put on ice for a reason.

664
01:45:04,857 --> 01:45:07,728
I've always felt hardware was more reliable.

665
01:45:07,944 --> 01:45:10,232
- Stark.
- General.

666
01:45:12,574 --> 01:45:15,064
You always wear such nice suits.

667
01:45:16,035 --> 01:45:17,363
Touché.

668
01:45:18,287 --> 01:45:21,988
- I hear you have an unusual problem.
- You should talk.

669
01:45:22,083 --> 01:45:23,577
You should listen.

670
01:45:26,253 --> 01:45:29,076
What if I told you we were
putting a team together?

671
01:45:29,841 --> 01:45:31,419
Who's "we"?

672
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:35,920
