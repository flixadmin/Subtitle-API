1
00:00:01,105 --> 00:00:03,207
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,437 --> 00:00:07,139
For 5 years I was stranded on
an island with only one goal--

3
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:09,742
to survive.

4
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,526
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:13,662
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:15,864
to use the list of names
he left me

7
00:00:15,866 --> 00:00:19,817
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:23,288
To do this,
I must become someone else.

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:27,926
I must become
something else.

10
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:29,828
Previously on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,880
Stop looking into this.
It's not safe.

12
00:00:31,882 --> 00:00:35,050
Accidents tend to befall people
who are too curious.

13
00:00:35,052 --> 00:00:37,462
Felicity, I want you

14
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:39,021
to find out all you can
about that book.

15
00:00:39,022 --> 00:00:41,856
I got these from applied sciences.
Look at the book again.

16
00:00:43,976 --> 00:00:47,145
Where can I find the man
in this picture?

17
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,114
Aah!

18
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:52,367
Island dangerous, but you
not tell them where to find me.

19
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:54,018
I'm coming with you.

20
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:10,201
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

21
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:14,022
Look, all I'm doing is looking
to get something going again.

22
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:15,740
Yeah, I know.

23
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,575
I know, but this time--

24
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:25,283
I have to call you back.

25
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:28,620
What?

26
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:31,706
Did you come back for
another pound of flesh?

27
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,425
You're gonna be
disappointed, pal.

28
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,592
Thanks to you, I'm--

29
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,343
Nice. Picking up the pace.

30
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,646
I could say the same thing
about you.

31
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,398
You crossed 3 names off
your father's list this week alone.

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,066
Yeah, well, some of these guys
are just giving it up now.

33
00:01:58,068 --> 00:01:59,734
All I gotta do
is pay 'em a visit.

34
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:02,487
It seems the vigilante's reputation
is beginning to precede him.

35
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:04,489
Ah!
Whoo.

36
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:06,991
Another round?

37
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,794
No.

38
00:02:13,031 --> 00:02:14,532
Gonna take my nephew
over to the mall

39
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,718
so he can let Santa know
what he wants for Christmas.

40
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,404
Oh. Christmas.

41
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,139
I didn't even realize.

42
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,091
That was because you've been
logging in so many hood hours

43
00:02:23,093 --> 00:02:25,510
ever since that thing
with Helena.

44
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,255
I meant...

45
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,754
There were no holidays
on the island.

46
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,217
Every day was...

47
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,052
How do I stay alive?

48
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:38,923
To do that,
you had to forget things,

49
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:42,160
like Christmas.

50
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:47,198
My dad threw a party
every year,

51
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,570
and he would put
a Christmas tree in every room.

52
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:57,425
The whole mansion
smelled like...

53
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,762
It smelled like Christmas.

54
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,130
Maybe you can
give the list a rest

55
00:03:02,132 --> 00:03:04,482
and just enjoy
the holidays with the family.

56
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,101
Besides, I hear St. Nick
has a list of his own.

57
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,888
I wager you're in
the "nice" column.

58
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,639
Go home, Oliver.

59
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:33,795
You not, uh, hurt?

60
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,382
Where the hell you been?

61
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:41,619
I ran out of food and water
days ago.

62
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,288
Hey--hey,
where are you going?

63
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,900
You--

64
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,101
Uhh! Oh!

65
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,486
Stop!

66
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,071
Stop.

67
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,640
He's the one who tied me up
and had me tortured.

68
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,475
All 'cause he was looking
for you.

69
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,477
He would've killed me
if you didn't show up!

70
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,613
Then you kill him.

71
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,084
Or he can take you home.

72
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,670
What?

73
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:21,626
He has a plane.

74
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,463
A way for you
off this island.

75
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:40,331
Hey. You look very pretty.

76
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,999
What's the occasion?

77
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:43,667
Mom and Walter are having
a dinner party

78
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:46,036
with some big
muckety-mucks.

79
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:47,588
Best night of my life.

80
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:52,960
Thea, why aren't there
any decorations up in the house?

81
00:04:52,962 --> 00:04:54,661
What do you mean?

82
00:04:54,663 --> 00:04:56,046
No wreaths, no trees.

83
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:59,683
Everyone has just been
really busy lately.

84
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:01,969
I'm sure they haven't
got around to it yet.

85
00:05:01,971 --> 00:05:04,638
Does mom at least have some
of those boxes of candy canes?

86
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,640
Remember we used to race
to see who'd finish first?

87
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:08,508
Yeah. I always won.

88
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,611
No. You cheated.

89
00:05:10,613 --> 00:05:13,513
Well, she went
sugar-free last year,

90
00:05:13,515 --> 00:05:17,351
so I doubt you'll be seeing
any of those around.

91
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:22,716
The thing that people forget

92
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:24,810
is that Robin Hood
was a criminal.

93
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:26,627
And stealing from the rich
to give to the poor

94
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:28,528
is really the job
of the Democrats.

95
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:31,131
All joking aside,
Commissioner,

96
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:33,584
crime is down
for the first time in 5 years.

97
00:05:33,586 --> 00:05:37,922
That's because of the changes
my department has implemented.

98
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:39,506
Or perhaps it's because
the vigilante's activities

99
00:05:39,508 --> 00:05:43,260
have had a chilling effect
on the city's criminals.

100
00:05:43,262 --> 00:05:45,512
What are your thoughts,
Oliver?

101
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:48,372
I think the vigilante

102
00:05:48,397 --> 00:05:50,397
needs a better code name
than "The Hood"

103
00:05:50,686 --> 00:05:51,986
or "The Hood Guy."

104
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:55,222
I agree.

105
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:57,574
How about Green Arrow?

106
00:05:57,576 --> 00:05:59,243
Lame.

107
00:06:03,165 --> 00:06:05,232
Forgive me.

108
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:06,500
It's the office.

109
00:06:06,502 --> 00:06:08,252
Excuse me.

110
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:11,956
I'm in the middle of a dinner party,
Ms. Smoak,

111
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,573
so I hope this is
of some importance.

112
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:15,843
I guess that depends
on how you define important.

113
00:06:15,845 --> 00:06:19,179
See, most people would consider
finding a list of names

114
00:06:19,181 --> 00:06:22,366
written in subsonic ultraviolet
invisible ink important.

115
00:06:22,368 --> 00:06:25,152
But then I already
know that, now, don't I?

116
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:27,137
Did you know 7 of the names
on the list

117
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:29,657
are guys the vigilante's
had in his crosshairs?

118
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:32,660
That is, if bows
had crosshairs.

119
00:06:32,662 --> 00:06:34,094
Which they don't.

120
00:06:34,096 --> 00:06:37,114
Well, it is a rather
long list, Felicity,

121
00:06:37,116 --> 00:06:39,400
so I would expect there
to be some overlap.

122
00:06:39,402 --> 00:06:40,451
Like Doug Miller.

123
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:41,768
Head of Applied Sciences

124
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,454
at Queen Consolidated.
What of him?

125
00:06:43,456 --> 00:06:46,023
Mr. Miller may end up
getting an arrow in his stocking,

126
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:48,942
because he's on the list.

127
00:06:48,944 --> 00:06:53,047
So, important or not?

128
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:06,727
I'm sorry.
Something's come up.

129
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:08,128
Is everything okay?

130
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,515
The vigilante has struck again.

131
00:07:11,517 --> 00:07:14,801
He just put an arrow
in Adam Hunt.

132
00:07:20,943 --> 00:07:23,410
Oops.

133
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:25,696
I really do need to take this call.
It's my contractor.

134
00:07:25,698 --> 00:07:27,281
Of course.
Excuse me.

135
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,123
Well, the daughter came over,
used her key, found dad.

136
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:39,343
Hat trick to the chest.

137
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:40,594
The hood guy.

138
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:42,546
That's what I thought
at first.

139
00:07:42,548 --> 00:07:44,331
But these black arrows
aren't consistent with his M.O.

140
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,300
And neither is the fact
that the Hood

141
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:49,019
took Hunt for $40 million
a few months ago.

142
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:51,021
It doesn't make sense
to kill him now.

143
00:07:51,023 --> 00:07:52,973
Something
doesn't add up.

144
00:07:52,975 --> 00:07:55,192
We're dealing with
a copycat.

145
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:03,781

147
00:08:11,237 --> 00:08:14,439
Who would kill Adam Hunt
with an arrow?

148
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:17,325
I mean, other than you?

149
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:20,578
A setup, maybe.

150
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,747
You mean someone looking
to cover up killing Hunt

151
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:24,916
by making it look like
the work of the Hood?

152
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:26,251
Whoever he was, he's good.

153
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:28,753
The grouping on Hunt's
chest was tight.

154
00:08:28,755 --> 00:08:30,872
It's a compound bow,
most likely.

155
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:32,924
The guy is a...

156
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:34,676
The guy's
a legitimate archer.

157
00:08:34,678 --> 00:08:37,064
So someone who would be
particular

158
00:08:37,065 --> 00:08:38,263
about his choice of arrows.

159
00:08:38,647 --> 00:08:40,156
We get an arrow,

160
00:08:41,065 --> 00:08:42,974
we get a bead on where
he purchased them.

161
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,602
So what are you gonna do?

162
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,560
What anyone does
when they need help.

163
00:08:55,731 --> 00:08:57,565
Call a cop.

164
00:08:58,484 --> 00:09:00,151
Quentin Lance?

165
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:02,487
Yeah.

166
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:04,872
Sign here, please.

167
00:09:06,742 --> 00:09:09,043
Thanks.
Thanks.

168
00:09:28,147 --> 00:09:29,430
Lance.

169
00:09:29,432 --> 00:09:30,881
I didn't kill Adam Hunt.

170
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:32,066
You...

171
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:35,186
You call me the Hood.
It's not a great nickname.

172
00:09:35,188 --> 00:09:38,189
You told commissioner Nudocerdo
that you might be dealing with a copycat,

173
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:40,090
Another archer,
which makes me your best bet

174
00:09:40,115 --> 00:09:42,115
to take him down.

175
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:44,245
But I need your help.

176
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:46,614
I need one of the arrows
from his murder.

177
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:48,916
Yeah, we're pretty good at pulling
down leads off evidence. Thanks.

178
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:52,954
Not like I am. I can do things
the police can't,

179
00:09:52,956 --> 00:09:54,572
go places they won't.

180
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:57,225
Like I said,
I don't even know who--

181
00:09:57,227 --> 00:09:58,566
If this archer doesn't stop
with Adam Hunt,

182
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:00,245
we both have a problem.

183
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:02,513
Think about it.

184
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:04,215
Then call me.

185
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:06,267
Number's programmed in.

186
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,760
Doug. Thanks for coming.

187
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:17,195
Of course.

188
00:10:17,197 --> 00:10:18,696
How is the construction
coming along

189
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:20,097
on the Applied Sciences
Center?

190
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:21,265
Over budget
and behind schedule.

191
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:23,201
Exactly as expected.

192
00:10:23,203 --> 00:10:24,952
Is that what you wanted
to see me about?

193
00:10:24,954 --> 00:10:27,705
No.

194
00:10:30,075 --> 00:10:34,412
Adam Hunt. He was murdered
last night by the vigilante.

195
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:35,913
I read about that.

196
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:37,632
I've been concerned
by the idea

197
00:10:37,634 --> 00:10:39,500
that the vigilante
might target an employee

198
00:10:39,502 --> 00:10:42,136
or officer of this company.

199
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:44,138
Security red-flagged you.

200
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,792
Me? Why would this guy
go after me?

201
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:50,344
Well, that's a point I was
hoping you could shed some light on.

202
00:10:50,346 --> 00:10:51,796
You got me.
From what I've read,

203
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:54,399
this vigilante only goes after
white-collar criminals.

204
00:10:54,401 --> 00:10:57,685
Well, let's just hope
he doesn't decide to branch out.

205
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,108
I think there should be
a national holiday

206
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,911
for the guy that
invented French fries.

207
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:09,614
Or at least a statue
or something.

208
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:13,751
There is no Christmas party,
is there?

209
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:17,588
Thea, dad threw one of these
every year.

210
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,825
Do people think I just
wasn't gonna notice?

211
00:11:20,827 --> 00:11:21,992
Hi, Thea.

212
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:24,612
Hi. Shane.

213
00:11:24,614 --> 00:11:26,714
This is my brother
Oliver.

214
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:28,966
Nice to meet you, Thea's brother.
I bet the food on that island is better

215
00:11:28,968 --> 00:11:30,268
than this stuff
they're serving here, huh?

216
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,270
You'd lose that bet.

217
00:11:32,272 --> 00:11:35,673
We're heading down to the bay
to hang out if you want to come.

218
00:11:35,675 --> 00:11:39,977
Thanks, but I'm spending
the afternoon with my brother.

219
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:41,679
Another time.

220
00:11:41,681 --> 00:11:43,698
See ya.

221
00:11:48,787 --> 00:11:50,187
How do you know
that Shane guy?

222
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:52,206
We rob banks and smoke
crack together.

223
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:55,193
That's funny, yeah. I have a feeling
I'm not gonna be a fan.

224
00:11:55,195 --> 00:11:57,995
You don't even know him.

225
00:11:57,997 --> 00:11:59,864
Let's change the subject.

226
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:01,833
Fine. You were gonna tell me

227
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:04,836
why we're not having
the annual Christmas party.

228
00:12:08,758 --> 00:12:12,810
When you and dad
disappeared,

229
00:12:12,812 --> 00:12:15,847
by the time Christmas
rolled around,

230
00:12:15,849 --> 00:12:18,099
none of us felt
much like celebrating,

231
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:23,604
so we kind of skipped
Christmas that year.

232
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:26,524
Every year.

233
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:29,193
And it's really fine,
so...

234
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:34,415
No. No, it's really not.

235
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:41,038
We're celebrating Christmas.

236
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,790
I went 5 years without it,
and then Thea tells me

237
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:45,242
that you guys didn't have it either
and I'm the reason.

238
00:12:45,244 --> 00:12:47,678
So maybe now
I can be the reason

239
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,431
we have Christmas again.

240
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:54,585
I thought I would throw
the Queen Christmas party.

241
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:56,120
You?

242
00:12:56,122 --> 00:13:00,474
I know that I haven't
been the son

243
00:13:00,476 --> 00:13:03,144
or the stepson
or the brother

244
00:13:03,146 --> 00:13:04,729
that all of you deserve.

245
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:06,764
Especially lately.

246
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:09,099
But this feels like
the right moment

247
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:13,321
to start making up
for lost time.

248
00:13:13,323 --> 00:13:14,622
What do you say?

249
00:13:14,624 --> 00:13:17,375
I say yes.

250
00:13:17,377 --> 00:13:19,327
Yes! Okay. I will take
care of everything.

251
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:20,611
You don't have
to do anything.

252
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:22,613
Just show up,
look fantastic,

253
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:24,582
and bring some
Christmas cheer, okay?

254
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:26,884
Okay.

255
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:31,055
Fine.

256
00:13:31,057 --> 00:13:33,891
You're a good man, Oliver.

257
00:13:37,262 --> 00:13:39,897
You're a good man.

258
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,099
I can see it.

259
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:46,971
Well, beneath the privileged
upbringing and the wealthy veneer.

260
00:13:46,973 --> 00:13:49,974
I saw it when my man
tortured you

261
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:51,993
and you wouldn't give up
your friend.

262
00:13:51,995 --> 00:13:54,812
Not even a friend, really.

263
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:56,330
Someone you just met.

264
00:13:56,332 --> 00:13:57,632
Shut up.

265
00:13:57,634 --> 00:14:00,001
What do you know about him?

266
00:14:00,003 --> 00:14:01,953
Nothing, I suspect.

267
00:14:01,955 --> 00:14:07,324
Do you even know
what this island really is?

268
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:11,262
It's a prison.
I mean this literally.

269
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:14,632
Until 8 years ago,
the Chinese military

270
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:18,803
operated this island
as a penitentiary

271
00:14:18,805 --> 00:14:21,856
for criminals
deemed so dangerous,

272
00:14:21,858 --> 00:14:24,809
they couldn't be safely
incarcerated on the mainland.

273
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:27,445
When the military
shut the program down,

274
00:14:27,447 --> 00:14:31,198
my unit came in and disposed
of all the inmates.

275
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,485
With the exception of two.

276
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:37,187
Your friend was one of them.

277
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:41,692
Who was the other?

278
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:42,960
You met him.

279
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:45,046
He presided over
your interrogation.

280
00:14:45,048 --> 00:14:46,847
He tortured me.

281
00:14:46,849 --> 00:14:48,633
You had information
I needed.

282
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:50,918
What would you do
in my position?

283
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,837
What would you do
to capture the man

284
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:56,390
who slaughtered
dozens of people?

285
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:06,233
Douglas Miller came to see me today,
quite concerned.

286
00:15:06,235 --> 00:15:08,519
He said your husband
interrogated him,

287
00:15:08,521 --> 00:15:11,522
and his questions suggested
a knowledge he shouldn't have

288
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:13,891
of the list.

289
00:15:15,243 --> 00:15:16,911
Let me talk to him.

290
00:15:16,913 --> 00:15:19,613
I think we're past the point
of conversation, Moira.

291
00:15:19,615 --> 00:15:22,283
A month ago you came to me
and you told me

292
00:15:22,285 --> 00:15:25,736
to stay away from
your family, and I did.

293
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:28,739
But your family isn't
staying away from me.

294
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:32,793
Which means something
must be done about it.

295
00:15:32,795 --> 00:15:34,411
Don't you agree?

296
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:35,930
Yes, I do.

297
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:37,598
And I'll handle it.

298
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,266
I guess what I'm wondering is,

299
00:15:39,268 --> 00:15:41,969
whether it's time for
our associate to handle it.

300
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,526
Hell, yeah,
I returned the money.

301
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:51,862
$70 million isn't worth getting
an arrow through the chest.

302
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:53,584
And you can tell him,

303
00:15:53,609 --> 00:15:55,150
if he's got a problem
with that, he can--

304
00:16:05,043 --> 00:16:08,579
Commissioner,
this is Nelson Ravich.

305
00:16:08,581 --> 00:16:10,548
The Hood hit him
earlier this week.

306
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,085
Ravich wired back the money he
embezzled less than 5 minutes later.

307
00:16:16,121 --> 00:16:18,422
All right.

308
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,627
We tell the press
the Hood did this.

309
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:28,432
Hunt's murder
is a page 10 story, at best.

310
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:31,952
But Ravich makes this
a serial murder case.

311
00:16:31,954 --> 00:16:34,905
We can't let the public
get wind of the idea

312
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:37,608
that there are two
of these nut jobs running around.

313
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,643
You want me to ignore
a serial killer.

314
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:41,829
Just catch one of these psychos.
I don't care which one.

315
00:16:41,831 --> 00:16:45,499
That is a direct order
from your commanding officer.

316
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:50,755
Well, you can forget it, then.

317
00:16:52,457 --> 00:16:53,674
Fine.

318
00:16:53,676 --> 00:16:55,543
It's forgotten.

319
00:16:55,545 --> 00:16:58,328
And you're off
this case, Sergeant,

320
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,848
effective immediately.

321
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:31,295
Don't bother trying
to trace this back to me.

322
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:33,147
You'll never make it
through the encryption.

323
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:36,550
There's a heating vent
on the corner of O'Neil and Adams.

324
00:17:36,552 --> 00:17:38,719
You'll find what
you're after there.

325
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:41,705
It'd be a mistake
to set a trap for me, Detective.

326
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:44,074
I'm trading away just about
everything I believe in here

327
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:46,177
'cause it's the only
way I've got to get this bastard.

328
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:48,378
You got till Christmas.

329
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,315
And then, copycat or not...

330
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:54,034
I'm coming after you.

331
00:18:05,165 --> 00:18:08,400
So your friend Lance gave you
a Christmas present after all.

332
00:18:08,402 --> 00:18:11,036
Hmm.

333
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:14,590
Teflon-coated titanium blade
serrated to split the bone.

334
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:17,776
Shaft is some type
of specialized polymer,

335
00:18:17,778 --> 00:18:19,662
which is stronger than
a typical carbon fiber.

336
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:23,549
This...this is
a custom job.

337
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:25,918
So Lance gave in after after the
other archer dropped another body.

338
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,086
Nelson Ravich.

339
00:18:27,088 --> 00:18:28,387
Which is another name

340
00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:31,574
you crossed off
your dad's list.

341
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:36,061
So is this guy trying to frame you
or call you out?

342
00:18:36,063 --> 00:18:40,649
Either way,
I need to find him.

343
00:18:46,106 --> 00:18:48,274
Oh.

344
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:56,148
Hey.

345
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,951
Don't you knock?

346
00:18:58,953 --> 00:19:01,120
Felicity, this is
the I.T. department.

347
00:19:01,122 --> 00:19:02,821
It's not the ladies room.

348
00:19:02,823 --> 00:19:05,791
Right.

349
00:19:05,793 --> 00:19:07,593
What can I do for you?

350
00:19:07,595 --> 00:19:09,895
My buddy Steve
is really into archery.

351
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:12,715
Apparently
it's all the rage now.

352
00:19:12,717 --> 00:19:15,801
I don't know why. It's looks
utterly ridiculous to me.

353
00:19:15,803 --> 00:19:17,269
Mm-hmm.

354
00:19:17,271 --> 00:19:19,805
Anyway, it's Steve's
birthday next weekend,

355
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:21,724
and I wanted
to buy him some arrows.

356
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:26,767
The thing is, he gets these special
custom-made arrows,

357
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:30,562
and I have no idea
where he gets them.

358
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:35,487
I was hoping you could find out
where this came from.

359
00:19:37,374 --> 00:19:39,325
- Careful.
- Yeah.

360
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:49,335
The shaft's composite
is patented.

361
00:19:55,091 --> 00:19:59,178
And that patent is registered
to a company called Sagittarius.

362
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,480
That's Latin for the archer.

363
00:20:01,482 --> 00:20:02,932
Really?

364
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:04,683
Could you find out
where and when

365
00:20:04,685 --> 00:20:06,352
this was purchased?

366
00:20:09,823 --> 00:20:12,491
According to Sagittarius
company records,

367
00:20:12,493 --> 00:20:17,696
that particular arrow
was part of a bundle shipment.

368
00:20:17,698 --> 00:20:20,399
200 units.

369
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:22,084
Sent...

370
00:20:22,086 --> 00:20:24,753
to this address.

371
00:20:24,755 --> 00:20:26,372
Felicity...

372
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,259
You're remarkable.

373
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:33,245
Thank you for remarking
on it.

374
00:20:34,965 --> 00:20:36,915
And Merry Christmas.

375
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:38,634
I'm Jewish.

376
00:20:40,887 --> 00:20:43,305
Happy Hanukkah.

377
00:20:47,177 --> 00:20:50,863
The significant resources
of the Starling City police department

378
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:55,600
is clear that this vigilante's
cycle of violence has escalated.

379
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:58,704
I'm asking our citizens
to keep a close eye out

380
00:20:58,706 --> 00:21:01,206
and to report
anything suspicious.

381
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,791
A tip line has been set up,

382
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:04,910
and a reward
will be offered

383
00:21:04,912 --> 00:21:07,129
to anyone who aids
the authorities

384
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:10,499
in the capture
of this madman.

385
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:12,134
It isn't him,
is it?

386
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:14,720
We are all frustrated with the
crime plaguing our city.

387
00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:17,256
The man in the hood
didn't kill those people.

388
00:21:17,258 --> 00:21:20,009
You're the one who said
he was a monster.

389
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:22,928
He was
protecting me.

390
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,730
It's different.

391
00:21:24,732 --> 00:21:27,232
...the apprehension
of this so-called "Hood"

392
00:21:27,234 --> 00:21:30,286
that has been
terrorizing our city.

393
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:32,521
As police commissioner...

394
00:21:32,523 --> 00:21:34,106
It's probably Joanna.

395
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:37,493
She said she was going
to come by with some files.

396
00:21:45,151 --> 00:21:46,535
Merry Christmas, sir.

397
00:21:46,537 --> 00:21:48,337
How are you?

398
00:21:48,339 --> 00:21:50,155
Proficient with firearms.

399
00:21:50,157 --> 00:21:52,341
- Dad.
- Yeah.

400
00:21:55,044 --> 00:21:58,005
I told you I wanted to spend
the holidays with my dad.

401
00:21:58,006 --> 00:21:59,337
Right. Because of Sara.

402
00:21:59,362 --> 00:22:01,362
Because it makes
the holidays a tough time.

403
00:22:01,385 --> 00:22:04,470
But when you are
with someone,

404
00:22:04,472 --> 00:22:05,804
as I want
to be with you,

405
00:22:05,806 --> 00:22:07,306
then there aren't
tough times.

406
00:22:07,308 --> 00:22:09,058
There's just times.

407
00:22:10,643 --> 00:22:13,128
Something
is holding you back.

408
00:22:15,348 --> 00:22:18,634
The Queens are having
a last-minute Christmas party,

409
00:22:18,636 --> 00:22:21,403
and I would like for you
to be my plus one.

410
00:22:24,457 --> 00:22:28,860
I, um, was looking through
some old photographs

411
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:32,081
and...I found this.

412
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,833
Merry Christmas.

413
00:22:40,507 --> 00:22:42,707
Bad enough you're
friends with this guy,

414
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:45,010
and now he's your...what?

415
00:22:45,012 --> 00:22:46,845
I don't know
what he is.

416
00:22:46,847 --> 00:22:48,931
But he's not wrong.

417
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:51,650
Something
is holding me back.

418
00:22:51,652 --> 00:22:54,486
Right. Keep listening
to that something.

419
00:22:54,488 --> 00:22:57,356
I try to stay out of your
personal life, Laurel, I really do,

420
00:22:57,358 --> 00:22:59,158
but these guys--
Merlyn, Queen--

421
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,059
I mean, they're selfish.
They think they can treat people

422
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:02,327
any way they damn please.

423
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:04,163
It's you, me, and Sara.

424
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:06,448
What?

425
00:24:52,287 --> 00:24:53,727
I see the halls
are decked.

426
00:24:53,728 --> 00:24:55,294
You okay?

427
00:24:55,482 --> 00:24:56,615
I'll manage.

428
00:24:56,617 --> 00:24:58,250
Is everyone having
a good time?

429
00:24:58,252 --> 00:24:59,868
You sure you want
to do this, man?

430
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,871
Maybe now is not the best time
for you to be Martha Stewart's elf.

431
00:25:02,873 --> 00:25:04,656
My family needs
this party, Diggle.

432
00:25:04,658 --> 00:25:06,692
Which means
that I need it.

433
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:12,931
Hey, dude.
Thea invited me.

434
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:15,601
I hope that's cool.

435
00:25:15,603 --> 00:25:18,770
These are for your mom.

436
00:25:18,772 --> 00:25:20,806
Smooth.

437
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:23,341
Good luck, kid.

438
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,447
Thank you for coming.

439
00:25:28,449 --> 00:25:29,865
Oliver.

440
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:31,200
You guys look great.

441
00:25:31,202 --> 00:25:33,018
Merry Christmas.

442
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,686
Merry Christmas.

443
00:25:34,688 --> 00:25:35,988
Let's get
a holiday photo.

444
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,907
I already sent out
our Christmas cards, Oliver.

445
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:40,792
Mom, let's get a picture
just for the 4 of us.

446
00:25:40,794 --> 00:25:42,861
Of course.

447
00:25:45,364 --> 00:25:48,533
Excuse me. Mrs. Queen?
These are for you.

448
00:25:48,535 --> 00:25:50,085
Well, thank you.

449
00:25:50,087 --> 00:25:53,371
I'll--I'll go put this
in water.

450
00:25:54,674 --> 00:25:56,425
Is everything all right?

451
00:25:56,427 --> 00:25:59,711
You and I
should talk alone.

452
00:26:03,016 --> 00:26:05,684
Everything okay between
the two of you?

453
00:26:05,686 --> 00:26:08,487
Yeah. I'm sure
it'll work itself out.

454
00:26:25,538 --> 00:26:29,341
So glad that both of you
could make it.

455
00:26:29,343 --> 00:26:30,342
Merry Christmas, man.

456
00:26:30,344 --> 00:26:31,593
Merry Christmas.

457
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:34,596
Merry Christmas.

458
00:26:34,598 --> 00:26:35,764
Hi.

459
00:26:37,517 --> 00:26:40,052
So how long do you guys
think it'll be

460
00:26:40,054 --> 00:26:41,603
till this isn't so weird?

461
00:26:41,605 --> 00:26:43,188
You know, the 3 of us.

462
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,723
It's not weird at all.

463
00:27:00,907 --> 00:27:02,207
You lied to me.

464
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:05,544
An odd accusation
coming from you.

465
00:27:05,546 --> 00:27:08,580
When you came home,
you said you were through

466
00:27:08,582 --> 00:27:10,782
investigating Robert's death.

467
00:27:10,784 --> 00:27:13,618
Robert was my oldest friend.

468
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,453
Do you take me for a man

469
00:27:15,455 --> 00:27:18,423
who wouldn't avenge
his best friend's murder?

470
00:27:26,298 --> 00:27:28,016
I thought I could
forget about it,

471
00:27:28,018 --> 00:27:30,686
go back to the way
things were.

472
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:33,689
But you told me
too many lies, Moira.

473
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:36,692
You embezzled money
from the company.

474
00:27:36,694 --> 00:27:40,112
Salvaged the Queen's Gambit.
Why, Moira?

475
00:27:40,114 --> 00:27:43,448
What was it all for?

476
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,200
For leverage.

477
00:27:45,202 --> 00:27:46,418
Against whom?

478
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,870
Against whom?

479
00:27:48,872 --> 00:27:50,422
People who you made
very angry.

480
00:27:50,424 --> 00:27:52,157
Well, then let me
help you fight them.

481
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,625
I can't fight them.

482
00:27:53,627 --> 00:27:56,094
I am them.

483
00:27:56,096 --> 00:28:00,132
I have tried so hard
to convince myself that I'm not.

484
00:28:00,134 --> 00:28:04,886
And loving you...

485
00:28:04,888 --> 00:28:07,055
You were my salvation.

486
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:11,643
Moira.

487
00:28:11,645 --> 00:28:12,978
Moira.

488
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,397
Whatever you've done,

489
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:18,417
and whoever these people are,

490
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:20,702
the time for lies is over.

491
00:28:22,755 --> 00:28:25,157
You need to tell me
exactly what's going on.

492
00:28:27,577 --> 00:28:31,380
Let's just get through
the party...

493
00:28:31,382 --> 00:28:34,699
And I promise I will
tell you everything.

494
00:28:34,701 --> 00:28:36,551
Hmm.

495
00:28:42,341 --> 00:28:44,893
Tommy, do you mind
if I talk to Oliver for a minute?

496
00:28:44,895 --> 00:28:47,396
Yeah, I'll go grab
us a couple drinks.

497
00:28:47,398 --> 00:28:51,566
And drink them both.

498
00:28:51,568 --> 00:28:54,436
I know it's probably not easy
for you to see Tommy and I together.

499
00:28:54,438 --> 00:28:56,822
Ah, the invitation
said "plus one",

500
00:28:56,824 --> 00:28:58,740
not minus Laurel.

501
00:29:00,411 --> 00:29:02,527
I've been wanting
to move forward with him,

502
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:04,579
but something's
been holding me back.

503
00:29:04,581 --> 00:29:06,198
I keep making these excuses;

504
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,566
that it's my dad,

505
00:29:08,568 --> 00:29:11,903
it's my work,
when really...

506
00:29:11,905 --> 00:29:14,506
it's you.

507
00:29:14,508 --> 00:29:16,908
But for five years,

508
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:20,128
I was emotionally...

509
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:24,132
off, because you had died.

510
00:29:24,134 --> 00:29:27,452
And the truth is,

511
00:29:27,454 --> 00:29:30,455
the last person
that I expected

512
00:29:30,457 --> 00:29:32,808
to make me feel again...

513
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,377
has.

514
00:29:43,453 --> 00:29:45,770
I'm happy.

515
00:29:45,979 --> 00:29:48,747
For both of you.

516
00:29:48,749 --> 00:29:51,283
Thank you.

517
00:29:51,285 --> 00:29:56,538
♪ A merry little Christmas

518
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:00,842
♪ now

519
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,436
Thea, it's Ollie.

520
00:30:07,123 --> 00:30:09,073
Oliver!

521
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,577
Hit the road.

522
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:15,663
What are you doing?

523
00:30:15,665 --> 00:30:18,216
Funny, I was going
to ask you the same thing,

524
00:30:18,218 --> 00:30:19,801
because there's a party
going on downstairs

525
00:30:19,803 --> 00:30:21,553
that I threw for you.

526
00:30:21,555 --> 00:30:23,922
I told you,
I didn't want a party.

527
00:30:23,924 --> 00:30:26,007
But you didn't care.

528
00:30:26,009 --> 00:30:28,927
Because you came down
with the holiday blues.

529
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:32,514
I've been trying to get you
to open up for months.

530
00:30:32,516 --> 00:30:34,933
All this party is doing
is bringing back memories

531
00:30:34,935 --> 00:30:36,901
I've been trying
to forget.

532
00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:38,636
Thea!

533
00:30:38,638 --> 00:30:41,656
Why would you want to forget?

534
00:30:41,658 --> 00:30:44,325
No matter how fancy
the party is you throw,

535
00:30:44,327 --> 00:30:47,879
things will never be the way
they used to be in our family.

536
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:50,648
Ever again.

537
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:54,035
Oliver?

538
00:30:55,838 --> 00:30:57,822
What is it now?

539
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:02,260
The other archer's
moved to the next level.

540
00:31:02,262 --> 00:31:05,513
This just hit the news.
He's taken hostages.

541
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:08,883
Happy holidays,
Starling City.

542
00:31:08,885 --> 00:31:11,102
For the past three months,

543
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,938
this city has been laid
siege by a vigilante.

544
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,608
But the police have been
unable to bring him to justice

545
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:20,278
because they lack the will to do
what justice demands.

546
00:31:22,449 --> 00:31:25,533
I will kill one hostage...

547
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:28,119
every hour in the name
of this vigilante

548
00:31:28,121 --> 00:31:31,623
until he surrenders himself
to my authority.

549
00:31:35,628 --> 00:31:37,829
Police are on the scene, Oliver.
I think you should let them handle this.

550
00:31:37,831 --> 00:31:40,381
Those people are there because of me.
I have to end this.

551
00:31:40,383 --> 00:31:41,749
Oliver, this guy...

552
00:31:41,751 --> 00:31:43,668
this guy,
he's very dangerous.

553
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,553
Diggle, there wasn't
anything on the island

554
00:31:45,555 --> 00:31:47,222
that wasn't twice as dangerous
as this pretender,

555
00:31:47,224 --> 00:31:50,875
and I survived there
for five years.

556
00:31:58,435 --> 00:32:00,184
Call your people.

557
00:32:00,186 --> 00:32:02,403
Tell them to bring the plane.

558
00:32:02,405 --> 00:32:04,606
There's no need,
Yao Fei.

559
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,158
My people
will be here shortly.

560
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:12,063
Do you not think it convenient
you captured me so easily?

561
00:32:12,065 --> 00:32:13,331
Go!

562
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:15,066
What?
Run!

563
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,173
Starling City
holds its breath

564
00:33:02,176 --> 00:33:04,176
as the hostage crisis unfolds.

565
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:07,314
Police have attempted to enter
the abandoned structure in the Glades,

566
00:33:07,414 --> 00:33:10,582
but found rigged explosives
preventing them from doing so.

567
00:33:10,802 --> 00:33:12,535
At the moment,
there's been no sign

568
00:33:12,537 --> 00:33:16,172
of the vigilante as his
one hour deadline nears.

569
00:33:21,711 --> 00:33:23,930
I count three thresholds,

570
00:33:23,932 --> 00:33:27,850
each wired by Mercury
switches to Semtex charges.

571
00:33:27,852 --> 00:33:31,153
Can you defuse one
for HRC to use as a breach point?

572
00:33:31,155 --> 00:33:32,605
Well, that's going
to take a while

573
00:33:32,607 --> 00:33:33,889
and then he's going to know
which way we're coming in.

574
00:33:33,891 --> 00:33:35,274
You got a better
idea, Sergeant,

575
00:33:35,276 --> 00:33:38,160
now would be
a lovely time.

576
00:33:52,092 --> 00:33:54,010
Where is he?

577
00:33:54,012 --> 00:33:55,411
I don't know.

578
00:33:55,413 --> 00:33:56,546
It's going to be okay.

579
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:58,381
Follow me.

580
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,026
Get up on the roof.

581
00:34:10,028 --> 00:34:11,277
What about...

582
00:34:11,279 --> 00:34:13,779
I'll handle him.
Move!

583
00:34:13,781 --> 00:34:15,197
Hostages.

584
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,983
We've got five hostages
on the roof.

585
00:34:16,985 --> 00:34:19,235
Repeat, five hostages
on the roof.

586
00:34:25,876 --> 00:34:27,994
Thank you for coming.

587
00:34:27,996 --> 00:34:30,763
After the warehouse,
I knew I'd have to do

588
00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:32,632
something dramatic
to get your attention.

589
00:34:32,634 --> 00:34:34,450
What do you want with me?

590
00:34:34,452 --> 00:34:38,120
What any archer wants--
to see who's better.

591
00:35:25,686 --> 00:35:28,688
First Hunt, then Ravich,

592
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:31,390
and now you.

593
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:36,112
I know about the list,

594
00:35:36,114 --> 00:35:39,815
and the man who authored it
wants you dead.

595
00:35:39,817 --> 00:35:41,183
They call you the Hood.

596
00:35:41,185 --> 00:35:44,186
Let's see what
you look like without it.

597
00:36:14,651 --> 00:36:17,386
Dig.

598
00:36:17,388 --> 00:36:20,823
Help--help.

599
00:36:32,136 --> 00:36:34,357
Hey, relax.
Relax. Just relax.

600
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,676
You're safe.
You're in the hospital.

601
00:36:36,678 --> 00:36:39,679
What happened?

602
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:41,448
I back traced your signal.
I cleaned you up

603
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:44,234
and got you out of there.
You've got a pneumothorax,

604
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:45,485
three broken ribs
and a concussion,

605
00:36:45,487 --> 00:36:46,903
but the doctor said
you're going to be fine.

606
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:49,906
Some people are here to see you.
What?

607
00:36:53,095 --> 00:36:55,078
Are you
all right?

608
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,746
Oh, God,
you look terrible.

609
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:59,266
Well, thank God you were
wearing your helmet.

610
00:36:59,268 --> 00:37:00,929
I told them how you were
on a bike and a semi

611
00:37:00,954 --> 00:37:02,753
pulled right in front of you.

612
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:05,672
What were you
even doing out?

613
00:37:05,674 --> 00:37:07,140
You bailed on your party.

614
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,975
It seemed like
the right move.

615
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,760
I mean,
like you said,

616
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:13,496
it...wasn't
the best timing.

617
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,601
Okay, but when
I was saying that,

618
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:20,270
that was me being a bitch.

619
00:37:20,272 --> 00:37:23,857
Oh, the truth is, I don't think any
of us were at our best.

620
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:25,742
The real truth is,
you wanted to have

621
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,194
a party to bring us
closer together.

622
00:37:28,196 --> 00:37:30,113
Well...

623
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:32,415
here we are.

624
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:36,703
Ahh!

625
00:37:36,705 --> 00:37:39,956
We're going to let you
get some rest, hmm?

626
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,249
So...

627
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:53,586
We never got
to the exchanging presents part.

628
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,057
I don't think
I deserve a present.

629
00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:01,260
Look, I know
that I've been hard on you,

630
00:38:01,262 --> 00:38:03,697
about being different

631
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:06,466
from the way you were.

632
00:38:06,468 --> 00:38:08,434
But the truth is,

633
00:38:08,436 --> 00:38:11,321
Ollie, I'm not
the same person

634
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:13,540
I was five years ago, either.

635
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:18,511
So maybe we can just
accept each other.

636
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:20,664
Not for who we were,

637
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,232
but for the--

638
00:38:22,234 --> 00:38:25,135
for the people
we are now.

639
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,754
Yeah.

640
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,408
Ohh!

641
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,843
No cheating.

642
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:36,012
You're on.
Come here.

643
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:37,881
Aww.

644
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:03,104
Thank you, Felicity.
It was good of you to call,

645
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:04,856
but Oliver's
going to be fine.

646
00:39:04,858 --> 00:39:07,142
He's already on the mend.

647
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:09,694
I'm stepping into
an elevator,

648
00:39:09,696 --> 00:39:11,762
so I'll probably lose you.

649
00:39:11,764 --> 00:39:15,099
I'll call you
straight back. Bye.

650
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:22,440
It's done.
And he won't be harmed?

651
00:39:22,442 --> 00:39:24,442
Nor will he ever discover
your involvement.

652
00:39:24,444 --> 00:39:25,710
You have my word.

653
00:39:25,712 --> 00:39:27,212
Forgive me if I don't
find that comforting.

654
00:39:27,214 --> 00:39:29,881
You were warned,
Moira.

655
00:39:29,883 --> 00:39:32,450
I told you to get
Walter under control,

656
00:39:32,452 --> 00:39:33,784
and you couldn't.

657
00:39:33,786 --> 00:39:35,503
Steps had
to be taken.

658
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:38,289
That's what you said
to justify Robert's murder.

659
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:41,009
And you wonder why
I don't trust you.

660
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:42,927
Quite a bid of judgment
coming from the woman

661
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:45,396
who had her son
kidnapped and tortured.

662
00:39:45,398 --> 00:39:47,732
To prove to you that Oliver
didn't know anything.

663
00:39:47,734 --> 00:39:50,101
And what does it matter now?

664
00:39:50,103 --> 00:39:53,238
What's done is done.
No, Moira.

665
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,040
It's just beginning.
In six months,

666
00:39:56,042 --> 00:39:58,610
the organization's vision of what
this city should be

667
00:39:58,612 --> 00:40:00,578
will be complete.

668
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:04,582
And you won't feel
a thing then, will you?

669
00:40:04,584 --> 00:40:07,285
Thousands of innocent people
will be dead,

670
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:09,087
and you'll feel nothing.

671
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:10,922
That's not true.

672
00:40:10,924 --> 00:40:15,426
I'll feel a sense
of accomplishment.

673
00:40:15,428 --> 00:40:18,046
And you'll have
Walter back.

674
00:40:39,034 --> 00:40:41,035
You know, Dig,

675
00:40:41,037 --> 00:40:44,722
when I confront
somebody on the list,

676
00:40:44,724 --> 00:40:47,075
I tell them

677
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:50,528
that they failed
the city.

678
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:54,031
But tonight,
it was me who failed.

679
00:40:54,033 --> 00:40:56,718
Oliver, five hostages
are home tonight with their families

680
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,088
enjoying the holidays.

681
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,423
Because of you.

682
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,811
This guy,
the other archer...

683
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:09,714
He'll get his.

684
00:41:09,716 --> 00:41:11,549
And you'll give it to him.

685
00:41:11,551 --> 00:41:15,052
We might have
a bigger problem.

686
00:41:16,488 --> 00:41:21,776
The other archer told me
that somebody compiled the list.

687
00:41:21,778 --> 00:41:24,412
I always assumed

688
00:41:24,414 --> 00:41:27,115
it was my father.

689
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,403
But what if it wasn't?

690
00:41:32,405 --> 00:41:33,805
What do you mean?

691
00:41:33,807 --> 00:41:38,343
I think there's
someone else out there.

692
00:41:38,345 --> 00:41:41,546
Someone who's
more of a danger

693
00:41:41,548 --> 00:41:43,798
than the archer.

694
00:41:46,468 --> 00:41:50,993
And I am going
to take him down.

695
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:58,050
