Clotho.

Who the bloody hell is a Clotho?

26

The lead singer of your band.

You mean Charlie? She left days ago.

Don't hurt me.

Are we screaming because this is weird,
or because it's awesome?

41
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,938
I tried to wake you,

00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,941
but you assaulted my mainframe,
repeating, "snooze."

43
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,194
All right, let's just be cool
about this, okay?

44
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,945
I still have my pajamas on,

-which means we didn't--
- Oh, my God.

Like, take it easy.

47

You slept-walked into my room,

48
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,285
which means something
must have brought you in here,

49
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,913
and let's not forget,
in another timeline, you and I--

50
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,456
Wait, don't start with
the "dream girl" crap.

51

I'm still trying to process
how I spent the last five hours on...

What is this, 200-thread count?

53
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,213
Yeah.

54
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,506
I gotta go.

55

-[gasps]
- You're up early.

56

Um, what are you doing?

57
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,851
Looks like somebody was playing
Operation with Gideon's mainframe.

58
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,895
Or maybe it was something.

59

You think they have raccoons
in the temporal zone?

60
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,399
[Gideon] Actually, Mr. Tarazi, it was--

61
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,316
Snooze, Gidget!

62
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:54,859
Hey.

63
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,528
You left this in my bedroom.

64
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,655
- Oh, wow!
- Well, looky, looky.

65
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,865
- We didn't hook up.
- We did not hook up.

66
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,951
It doesn't have to be a walk of shame
if you enjoyed it.

67
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,578
But if you're walking at all,
you didn't enjoy it enough.

68
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,080
Gross, Charlie.
[sighs]

69
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,416
Hey, B, me and Z did not do, you know...

70
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,875
- No.
-...the nasty.

71
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,377
This is a judgment-free zone.

72
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,088
I'm not one to shame the sexual activity
of two consenting adults.

73
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,423
Shame's a good thing.

74
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,466
Keeps you from hooking up
with someone and...

75
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,302
ending up the parent
of a 16-year-old daughter.

76
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,889
Oh, ooh! Well...

77
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,600
what naughty business
have I stumbled across, then?

78
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,768
Uh, nothing, we...

79
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,856
We like, um,
hanging out in the hallways now...

80
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,898
Goodbye.

[chuckles]

82
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,153
Well, then, Charlie,

83
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,530
we, uh, have some business
to attend to, love.

84
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,824
We do, but first.., whiskey.

85
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,242
All right, then.

86
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,703
[Gideon] A stiff drink
may indeed be in order.

87
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,581
I have some rather
unfortunate news for you, Charlie.

88
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,003
[rock song plays through headphones]

89

[Agent Sharpe] Charlie...

90
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,057
We came as soon as we heard.

91
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,019
Look, the Prognosticator's scanning
the timeline for Encore activity.

92
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,313
Trust me, we're going to figure out
who's responsible for this.

93
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,857
This wasn't the work of an Encore.

94
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,068
This was my sister. Atropos.

95
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,403
How can you tell?

96
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,949
"The victim was burned from the inside."

97
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,077
She's a god. That's her signature move.

98
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,955
Well, I'm, uh, sorry about your friends,
Charlie, but, uh,

99
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,500
your sister just fired
one hell of a warning shot.

100
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,501
Now we need to get back out there

101
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,336
and find that Loom piece
before she does.

102
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,004
Will you just piss off, John?

103
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,133
Hey, Charlie...

104
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,761
Look, I'm sorry, I've...
I've lost friends, too.

105
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,887
I know what you're going through.

106
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,764
Look, I respect your condolences,

107
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,183
but you don't have a bloody clue
what I'm going through.

108
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,105
[sighs] Well, she's right.

109
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,733
We're putting the hunt
for the Loom on hold.

110
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,276
And it's probably for the best.

111

With Ray gone,
we're still trying to find our feet.

112
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,863
It gives us time to make a game plan.

113
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,406
But we do have a game plan.

114
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,908
We need to get the next piece.

115
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,493
Look, John, if you want to help,

116
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,454
then look into what we're up against.
She's a god.

117
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,749
I don't want to take the team
into a situation we can't get out of.

00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,543
Yeah, yeah, all right. All right.

119
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,836
I overstepped the mark, didn't I?
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,966
I am sorry, Charlie, but...

Clotho has taken on

My protégé, Astra,

happens to know of a time-traveler
who's looking for our Loom.

134
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:41,002
One of his companions is a woman
who goes by "Charlie."

135
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,378
A time-traveler.

136
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,631
That's how Clotho has eluded me.

137
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:48,301
Fortunately, I can track
John Constantine.

make it a hell of a family reunion.

[Sara] Gideon, the next time
John steals the Jumpship,

145
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,595
a little heads-up would be nice.

[Gideon] Thanks to Ms. Tarazi,
I'm still stuck on snooze mode.

147
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,892
Is your sister just looking for you,
or is she looking for the Loom?

148
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:38,935
Both, I reckon.

149
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,395

He's going after the ring.

You're the only one
who knows where he's headed.

Look, we'll be in and out.

Okay, fine.

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,711
- Hmm.
- Maybe I should stay, huh?

161
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,630
Are you volunteering for Rory duty?

162
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,133
Ava Sharpe,
you are a better woman than I.

163

- Okay, babe, catch you on the flip side.

164

Stay safe.

[portal closes]

166
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,146
The ring's that way.

167
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,982
He couldn't have gotten too far.
Let's gear up in the Jumpship.

168
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,697
Kid's not into bears, huh?

169
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,367
She ripped its head off.

170
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,744
Yeah, I see that.

171
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,162
Well, like father, like daughter.

172
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,039
I mean, hey, you should be proud.
At least she's tough like you.

173
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,916
She said I ruined her life.

174
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,296
Now I gotta portal back
to that stupid reunion party

175
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,340
and stop myself from sleeping with Ali.

176
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,341
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

177
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,177
There are so many reasons
why that's a bad idea.

178
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,261
- Don't care.
- Stop!

179
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,764
You can't just erase
your daughter's existence, Mick.

180
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,057
There... There has to be another option.

181
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,350
What?

182
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,145
What if we go back through
the last 15 years

183
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,481
and we... And we place you
into all of her key memories?

184
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,357
Like a highlight reel?

185
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,568
Yeah, I mean, it's kind of
what Rip did with me,

186
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:14,071
programmed me with a bunch of memories
that added up to be a childhood.

187
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,907
It wasn't perfect,
but I turned out okay.

188
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,824
She's not a clone.

189
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,076
Ouch. Yeah, she's not a...
[grunts]

190
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,496
But she is programmable, in a sense.

191
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,705
Won't work.

<i>Why'?</i>

00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,083
I spent the first ten years
of her life in prison.

194
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,085
Right.

195
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,965
I have an idea.

196
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,385
[Sara sighs]

197
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,430
You sure hid this one well.

198
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,891
Didn't think I'd ever
be coming back here, did I?

199
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:45,978
Huh.

200
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,815
That's cool! It looks like
Supernatural's filming here.

201
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,941
Super-what?

202
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,443
You've never seen it?

203
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:56,364
It's this show about these
two hot brothers who fight demons.

204
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,367
I wonder if
the Winchester brothers are here.

205
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,786
- Seriously?
- Dean is my hall pass.

206
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,917
I bet you used to wild out
back in the day.

207
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,503
There was no drinking on the job.

208
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,129
It's kind of the occupational hazard

209
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,257
of having the fate of humanity
in your hands.

210
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,386
So you guys literally
used to weave fate?

211
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,890
I mean, it's not like it is
in the storybooks, but.., yeah.

212
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,851
I spun up the threads of each life.

213
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,771
Old Lachesis, she measured out
how long each life got to be.

214
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,565
And then Atropos, she...

215
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,360
- So she killed--
- Everyone.

216
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,155
[sighs] And she bloody loved it.

Greetings, sibling o' mine.

You okay, Z?

223
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,896
Is this about the Nate thing?

224
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,772
I hope not, because then
I'm going to be wondering why

225
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,191
you just said "meow,"
and I definitely don't want to know.

226
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,693
I think I may be losing it.

227
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:20,406
And not like when I saw Tupac's hologram
at the 2044 Grammys...

228
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:24,243
but, like, mentally losing it.
Something is wrong with me.

Whoa. Did you just beat me?

Behrad, I don't know how
to play video games.

236
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,323
But it's like I'm being haunted
by someone who does.

237
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,950
Someone who dresses like a teenage boy

238
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:08,079
and makes me do awful things
like eat donuts and cuddle with Nate.

Well, what have we got here?

Oh, what the bloody hell is that?

It's a prop.

00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,730
Now, what did I tell you
about Loom patrol?

Yeah, well, we're out here, aren't we?
So let's just find the damn thing.

Oh, yeah, have you scanned
the woods for activity?

247
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,904
Huh? You have a plan
if Atropos shows up?

248
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:45,700
Well, I, uh, clipped Charlie's
shapeshifter wings, so no offense, love,

What, so we're stuck here?

The team will come
looking for us eventually.

And we need these
more than Sam and Dean.

You've walked us
right into a bloody death trap.

And that was my only option, all right?

If she gets a hand
on one piece of the Loom,

274
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,177
then she can get the next,
and then she's that much closer

to controlling us all.

The stupid thing's that way.

By building Heyworld,
we changed the future,

281
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,152
which caused a bifurcation
in the timeline

radiating from that one moment.

Think of it
as a historical traffic accident,

Yeah, I'm not thinking of myself
as a dent.

286

Okay, so what you think of as a haunting

00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,498
is a temporal echo.

From what you said about the hacking,
you were probably our computer expert.

a really super cute couple name,

probably something like "SteelHacker."

00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,999
because a taxi cab
just pulled up outside.

318
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,334
- Wait, this was supposed to be a...
- Yeah.

319
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,295
...surprise.

320
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,713
Is that what they're gonna say
at Iron Heights

321
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,423
when they find your empty cell?

322
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,091
What the hell are you doing here, Mick?

323
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,802
Oh, uh, hi, I'm Ava Sharpe.

324
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,596
I'm Mr. Rory's CO.

325
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,391
Yeah, I arranged for some visitation
in exchange for some information.

326
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,809
- Really?
- Yeah.

327
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,812
Mr. Rory's helped us bring in some
of history's most dangerous criminals.

328
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:02,730
What? I--

329
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,649
Okay, well, visiting hours are over.
Me and my baby are tired.

330
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,859
Right.

331
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,861
Wow.

332
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:10,988
Ah.

333
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,073
From the Victorian England time--

334
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,700
"Collection." Collection...

335
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,910
at... At Pottery Barn.

336
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,247
I don't know much about Victorian
England, but it's really beautiful.

337
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,334
I bet she is, too.

338
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,549
Mick, meet your daughter.

339
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,513
[grunts softly]

340
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:38,849
Lita.

341
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,726
Hey, how about we all get together

342
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,145
so that Lita can remember this moment
with her dad forever.

343
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:44,438
Yeah? Let's take a picture.

344
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,026
[Agent Sharpe] Aw, Mickey!

345
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,323
[grunts softly]

346
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,658
Smiles.

347
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,410
Wait a minute.
Did you break into my house?

348
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,875
[Mick] "Garima lifted the king's..."

349
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:08,963
"...decapitated head." [laughs]

350
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,674
Dumb bastard. [laughs]

351
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,591
You like that?

352
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,344
Daddy?

353
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:17,596
Ah.

354
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,139
Do you believe in the Tooth Fairy?

355
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,225
Yes!

356
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,146
Whoa!

357
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,987
Say, "cheese."

358
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,793
[grunts]

359
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,754
-[smoke alarm beeps]
-[grunts]

360
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,341
Say, "cheese."

361
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,016
Kirk, we can get you new pants.

362
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,435
- How's that for a highlight reel?
-[chuckles]

363
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,853
Pretty good.

364
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,654
Hello, Clotho.

365
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,450
Look at you.

366
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,202
Alone, after destroying our family.

367
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,788
Look, I didn't do it to hurt you,
all right?

368
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,750
We took care of you,
and you took everything we had.

369
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,960
People deserve to be free.

370
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,004
And what have they done
with this freedom you gave them?

371
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,255
They got women the vote.

372
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,631
They invented punk rock.

373
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,467
Introduced mass genocide,

374
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,094
nuclear bombs, pollution,

375
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,888
systematic incarceration.

376
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,474
- No. I didn't--
- And after all you did to help them,

377
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,975
how did they thank you?

378
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,101
[groans]

379
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,270
By locking you in prison.

380
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,609
We would never let anyone
hurt you like that, little sister.

381
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,906
Now, lead me to our Loom.

382
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,118
And perhaps, in time,
we can forgive you.

383
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,044
[Sara yells] Hey!

384
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,255
Why don't you pick on someone
your own size?

385
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,551
[Sara grunting]

386
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,682
John, I could use a little help!

387
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,351
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm on it. I'm on it.

388
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,603
Let's try, uh...

389
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,521
Hemlock!

390
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,231
All right, all right. Yes.

391
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,316
Toadstool.

392
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,859
Got it.

393
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,321
Now all I need is a little bit of--

394
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,033
Blood.

395
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:46,703
[groans]

396
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:52,626
[reciting invocation]

397
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,637
Go. Grab Charlie,
get the hell out of here. I'll find you.

398
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,724
[Sara] You're gonna be okay. Come on.

399
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,284
- Hey, let's wait for John here.
- John's dead, Sara.

400
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,244
Atropos doesn't let people live.

401
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,246
Come on. We've got to keep going.

402
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,039
- It's okay.
- It's not.

403
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,041
I mean, you saw what happened
back there. I'm one of them.

404
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,544
No matter what I do,
I'm never gonna be able to escape them.

405
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,963
And now I've gone and got John killed.

406
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,631
Hey, look, John always finds a way.

407
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,217
Always finds a way to do what?

408
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,595
[sighs] Oh, thank God.

409
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:45,888
Yeah. I'd rather not, love.

410
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,100
Hey, your sister,
she's a nasty piece of work,

411
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,394
but it takes more than
amateur knife tricks to do me in.

412
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,521
Now, let's get the hell out of here,
shall we,

413
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,899
before she realizes I'm not
bleeding out on the forest floor.

414
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,712
Who.., are you?

415
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:20,631
[Behrad] Talking to donuts now?

416
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,049
LOL.

417
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,844
This, uh, alternate-timeline stuff's
got you really shaken up, huh?

418
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,139
Ever since Mithra came into my life,

419
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,350
I've been the center of attention.

420
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,228
It's weird to have to share
the spotlight.

421
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,189
Says the older sister
to the younger brother.

422
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,858
Right. Sorry.

423
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,862
Back to me, it's a lot to take in.

424
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,241
I mean, this other Zari sounds so...

425
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,285
smart and substantive,

426
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,373
like a cool third-wave
feminist superhero that you and...

427
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,417
Nate seemed to like better than me.

428
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,712
First off, Nate is just a sucker
for doomed romances.

429
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,673
Secondly, of course
I don't like her better than you.

430
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,591
You're my favorite Zari of all time.

431
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,552
But...

432
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:08,929
But?

433
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,473
You said you wanted to leave
your whole Z-Nation life behind,

434
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,350
find out what else you're capable of.

435
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,227
This whole situation seems like

436
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,980
a gift-wrapped opportunity
for self-exploration.

437
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,648
"Self-exploration"?

438
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,441
[gasps] I propose...

439
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,902
a totem quest.

440
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:26,863
Go into the totem,
speak to our ancestors.

441
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:30,617
Mmm-hmm.
Uh, how do I "go into the totem"?

442
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,327
With a little psychotropic assistance.

443
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,496
Mmm. I knew this would lead to drugs.

444
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,872
It's totally safe.

445
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,291
I've done it in the past

446
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,167
when I've been wrestling
with a big problem.

447
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,172
It's no crazier than talking to a donut.

448
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,135
I know that face.

449
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,761
That's the one
where you don't want to admit I'm right.

450
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,221
No, it isn't.

451
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,224
Totem-town, here we come.

452
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,397
[scoffs] She played me like a fiddle.

453
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,191
I almost gave her the Loom.

454
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,735
Our family knows all of our weaknesses.

455
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,529
[Charlie] I don't know.
Maybe she's right.

456
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,532
- I belong with them.
- Come on, Charlie.

457
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,452
Look, I'm a coward, Sara.
I can't even stand up to my own sister.

458
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,911
Hey, listen to me.

459
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,789
No one is responsible
for the family they're born into.

460
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,834
All that matters
is who they decide to be,

461
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,754
and you've decided to be brave
and big-hearted.

462
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,757
Thanks, boss.

463
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:29,926
But I am what I am.

464
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,104
[sighs] She's gonna love it.

465
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,614
- Surprise.
- What's this?

466
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,452
Nice. It's a keepsake album,

467
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:59,289
so I can never forget
all the times that you bailed on me.

468
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,083
Well, I was in prison.

469
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,459
Not since 2015.

470
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:07,464
You know, I never actually
went to homecoming.

471
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:12,010
I went back inside to get my purse,
and when I came back out, you were gone.

472
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,305
And I kept telling Kirk to wait because
I wanted to say goodbye to you.

473
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,015
But you had bailed...

474
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,684
like always.

475
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,396
So, keep it.

476
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:25,899
Fine.

477
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,194
Oh, and there's that patented
Mick Rory fade.

478
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,155
You know, good old Dad.
Just run away like you always do, yeah?

479
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,621
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I... [sighs]

480
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,331
I'm sorry.

481
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,916
Rory, it was a terrible idea,

482
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,710
and I never should have
suggested it, okay?

483
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,089
Rory... Listen to me, we can fix this.

484
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,507
- No, we can't.
- Yes, we can.

485
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,676
Look, I made a mistake
and I feel really bad,

486
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,094
but that doesn't give us the right
to keep hurting Lita

487
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,929
any more than we already have. Right?

488
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,473
Maybe it's not about the gifts

489
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,102
and the money
and the big birthday parties, you know?

490
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,729
I think it's time
that you go back in there

491
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,731
and do what we should have done
from the beginning.

492
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,232
Go back and kick myself in the--

493
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,067
No! No.

494
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,653
Just go tell her you're sorry.

495
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:14,823
Mmm.

496
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,366
I guess you're right.

497
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,243
No shortcuts.

498
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,671
What happened to this place?

499
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,631
Whoa.

500
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:36,887
[exclaims]

501
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,765
It's the crew.

502
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,518
Wait. If they're dead,
who's shooting Season 15?

503
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,062
You leave a piece of the Loom of Fate
somewhere long enough,

504
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,106
there's gonna be consequences.

505
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,399
Don't worry about it. I'll nab it.

506
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:50,859
No, John.

507
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,904
Look, this is my mess, all right?
I'll do it.

508
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,198
Look, all I got to do is run over there,

509
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,618
put my hand in that hole,
grab the ring, Bob's your uncle.

510
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,329
All right, well, then let's go
before your sister shows up.

511
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,133
[portal opens]

512
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,097
- Uh, what's going on?
- Shh!

513
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,432
Hey, girl.

514
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,184
Zari just took some Lyoga root.

515
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,520
She needs a little totem trip
to figure out her stuff.

516
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,855
Uh, Gideon, what's the status
with the away team?

517
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:31,107
[Gideon] The Jumpship is not responding.

518
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,818
Gideon, we talked about this.

519
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:37,030
Unsnooze, you need to tell me about
things before they happen, not after.

520
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,907
Okay, we should help them.

521
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,867
Ooh. Oh.

522
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,786
I feel high already.

523
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,579
Is it too late to detox?

524
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,747
That's the fun of drugs.

525
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:46,998
You can't untake them.

526
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,209
- Hmm.
- Besides, this is important.

527
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,461
Everything is going to be fine, sis.

528
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:52,462
Okay.

529
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,549
I surrender. [sighs]

530
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,729
Hello?

531
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,274
Ancestors?

532
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,028
Where are all the old people at?

533
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,655
Who you calling old?

534
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:33,920
So, if you're here, does that mean...
Maman and Baba... Behrad?

535
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:37,257
No, B's back on the Waverider.
Who do you think gave me the drugs?

536
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,383
He's alive?

537
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,510
Yeah, of course. Maman and Baba, too.

538
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,432
Are you okay?

539
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,393
Yeah.

540
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,437
Yeah.

541
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,898
So, why are you even asking me
about Behrad?

542
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,525
I thought this was about me and
the strange visions I've been having.

543
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,736
Wow.

544
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,488
New me came out
shockingly self-absorbed.

545
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,157
Who are you calling the new you?

546
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,992
Who even are you?

547
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,870
Well.., you...

548
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,919
if the Legends hadn't saved the world,
and you grew up in dystopian Seattle.

549
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,004
Once the timeline crystallized,

550
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,006
you were out in the real world,

551
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,301
and I was thrown in here
with the rest of the totem bearers.

552
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,512
Wait, does that mean Nate was right?

553
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:28,141
[sighs] Are you a cooler me? Ugh.

554
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,102
We have a lot to talk about.

555
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,111
Hey, do carbs count
if you eat them in a totem?

556
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,238
- Nope.
- Oh.

557
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,423
[sighs] Whoa, whoa.

558
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,221
Whoa.

00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,997
Okay.

Yes.

Ow! [groans]

Apologize...

577
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,352
and we can heal you.

578
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,230
We can restore order to this madness.

579
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,067
I like the madness.

580
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,360
Sara was right.

581
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,030
I'm no Fate...

I'm a Legend.

583
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,952
And now she's dead.
Which makes you nothing.

how are, uh, things with Nate?

Mmm.

Yeah, super. Super cool.

00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,596
Weird to feel jealous of myself.

Well, don't be too jealous.

598
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,434
Sorry. Are you not together?

He's my brother's best friend,
it would...

600

It would be weird.

601
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,691
Sorry, he and Behrad are friends?

602
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,818
They have this ridiculous handshake.

It's sweet.

You must be disappointed?

Yeah, I was hoping Totem-town
would have a few video games.

No, I mean disappointed in me.

I mean, you were a superhero who wielded
a totem and saved the world. Twice.

I'm just a failed Cat-Chat celebrity.

00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:23,871
[Atropos] Where's the ring?

643
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,750
Hey...

644
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:31,087
Look, since you're Charlie's sister,
can't we just be cool about all this?

645
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,229
You two share blood.

646
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,274
She's your sister.

647
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,026
Yeah.

648
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,694
Pretty.

649
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,530
I'm taking the ring.
Whether she dies is up to you.

650
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:37,862
[sword unsheathes]

651
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,745
You don't belong here.

652
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,005
No more defying fate.

653
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,090
No!

654
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:14,107
Behrad!

655
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,276
- Is he...
- Get the ship in the air.

656
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,028
- She's still on the ship.
- Just do it!

657
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,544
You're not getting off this ship alive.

658
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:40,716
You saw my true form and survived.
What are you?

659
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,969
Your worst nightmare.

660
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,684
[both grunting]

661
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,877
You can't kill me.

662
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,170
I'm a god.

663
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,338
Yeah? I've faced worse.

664
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:23,092
Gideon, you'd better be awake, 'cause
I need you to open the doors, now.

665
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,280
Fate's a bitch, ain't it?

666
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,366
[screams]

667
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,963
-[Charlie] Not bad.
-[gasps]

668
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,264
Nice.

669
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,525
Come back soon.
Maybe next time bring Behrad.

670
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,735
I'd like that.

671
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:56,686
Oh, my God, guys.
I just had the most amazing experience.

672
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:57,979
Where's Behrad?

673
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,773
Z, um...

674
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:03,192
What's going on?

675
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:04,860
Where is...

676
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:08,698
Oh, my God.

677
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,202
Behrad...

678
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,454
Behrad...

679
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:19,875
[gasps] Why?

680
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:23,462
[sobs] Why? How did this happen?

681
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,172
He's dead.

682
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:07,840
Wait, who's dead?

683
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:08,883
Behrad.

684
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,720
You got us into this mess,
and now he's dead because of you.

685
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,598
Can that Loom bring him back?

686
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,058
If we get the last piece, yeah.

687
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:18,517
Great. Get up, let's go.

688
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,603
Hold on a second.
It's not that simple, all right?

689
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,898
We're being hunted
by a pair of bloody gods.

690
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,900
This situation just got
a hell of a lot more dicey.

691
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,401
I can handle dicey!

692
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,698
I can handle whatever it takes
to save my brother.

693
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,702
And until you bring him back,

694
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:41,791
I am with you every minute
of every damn day.
