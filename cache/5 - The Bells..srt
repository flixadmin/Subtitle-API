1
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:27,899
Come in.

2
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:31,944
And?

3
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:35,615
Nothing?

4
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:37,075
She won't eat.

5
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:44,415
We'll try again at supper.

6
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:48,252
I think they're watching me.

7
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:52,548
- Who?
- Her soldiers.

8
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:56,844
Of course they are. That's their job.

9
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,273
What have I told you, Martha?

10
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,653
The greater the risk,
the greater the reward.

11
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:18,074
Go on. They'll be missing you
in the kitchen.

12
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:43,391
The Northern armies?

13
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,059
Just crossed the Trident.

14
00:03:45,143 --> 00:03:47,854
They'll be at the walls
of King's Landing in two days.

15
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,523
How is she?

16
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:53,443
She hasn't seen anyone
since we returned.

17
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:56,446
Hasn't left her chambers,
hasn't accepted any food.

18
00:03:57,822 --> 00:03:59,657
She shouldn't be alone.

19
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:02,744
You're worried for her.
I admire your empathy.

20
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:04,662
Aren't you worried for her?

21
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:06,998
I'm worried for all of us.

22
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:09,292
They say every time
a Targaryen is born,

23
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,545
the gods toss a coin
and the world holds its breath.

24
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:15,339
We're not much for riddles
where I'm from.

25
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:17,717
We both know what she's about to do.

26
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:26,267
That's her decision to make.
She is our queen.

27
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,979
Men decide where power resides,
whether or not they know it.

28
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,734
What do you want?

29
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,652
All I've ever wanted.

30
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:38,946
The right ruler on the Iron Throne.

31
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,951
I still don't know
how her coin has landed.

32
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:47,288
But I'm quite certain about yours.

33
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,298
I don't want it.

34
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:58,674
I never have.

35
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:04,972
I have known more kings and queens
than any man living.

36
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:08,142
I've heard what they say to crowds,
and seen what they do in the shadows.

37
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,063
I have furthered their designs,
however horrible.

38
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:14,899
But what I tell you now is true:

39
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:18,069
You will rule wisely and well,
while she...

40
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,195
She...

41
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,239
is my queen.

42
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:44,053
Your Grace?

43
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:11,622
There's something you need to know.

44
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:15,209
Someone has betrayed me.

45
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:22,925
Yes.

46
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,431
Jon Snow.

47
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:35,730
Varys.

48
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:40,026
He knows the truth about Jon.

49
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:42,653
He does.

50
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:49,452
Because you told him.

51
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:53,831
You learned from Sansa.

52
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,751
And she learned from Jon,

53
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,920
though I begged him not to tell her.

54
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:02,006
As I said...

55
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:04,425
he betrayed me.

56
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,260
I'm glad Sansa told me.

57
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:07,720
I am your Hand.

58
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:10,473
I need to be aware
of any threats you're facing.

59
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:13,476
And Varys?

60
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:16,020
Your Master of Whisperers
needs to be aware too.

61
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:19,106
You spoke to him first.

62
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:21,192
Without coming to me.

63
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:22,610
Without asking my permission.

64
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,073
It was a mistake.

65
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:31,827
Why do you think Sansa told you?

66
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,456
- What do you think she hoped to gain?
- She trusts me.

67
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,292
Yes, she trusts you.

68
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:43,589
She trusted you to spread secrets

69
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:46,217
that could destroy your own queen.

70
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,888
And you did not let her down.

71
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:57,645
If I have failed you, my queen,
forgive me.

72
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:01,857
Our intentions were good.

73
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:07,279
We wanted what you want.
A better world, all of us.

74
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,616
Varys as much as anyone.

75
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,128
But it doesn't matter now.

76
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:25,297
No.

77
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:28,217
It doesn't matter now.

78
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Episode 5 - The Bells.

79
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,089
It was me.

80
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:37,680
I hope I deserve this.

81
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,431
Truly, I do.

82
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:41,016
I hope I'm wrong.

83
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:50,192
Goodbye, old friend.

84
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:32,818
Lord Varys.

85
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:38,699
I, Daenerys of House Targaryen,
First of My Name,

86
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,410
Breaker of Chains
and Mother of Dragons...

87
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,372
...sentence you to die.

88
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:57,509
<i>Dracarys.</i>

89
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:52,189
This was all she brought with her
when we crossed the Narrow Sea.

90
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,942
Her only possession.

91
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:42,239
It's all right, Torgo Nudho.

92
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:44,325
Let me speak with him.

93
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,872
What did I say
would happen if you told your sister?

94
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:16,607
I don't want it,
and that's what I told him.

95
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,943
She betrayed your trust.

96
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,321
She killed Varys as much as I did.

97
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:26,200
This was a victory for her.

98
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:31,121
Now she knows what happens
when people hear the truth about you.

99
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:37,419
Far more people in Westeros
love you than love me.

100
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,299
I don't have love here.

101
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,636
I only have fear.

102
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:50,307
I love you.

103
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:56,063
And you will always be my queen.

104
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,072
Is that all I am to you?

105
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,242
Your queen?

106
00:15:45,946 --> 00:15:47,448
All right, then.

107
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,582
Let it be fear.

108
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:04,465
The people who live there,
they're not your enemies.

109
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:07,176
They're innocents, like the ones
you liberated in Meereen.

110
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:09,195
In Meereen,
the slaves turned on the masters

111
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,097
and liberated the city themselves
the moment I arrived.

112
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:13,557
They're afraid.

113
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,143
Anyone who resists Cersei
will see his family butchered.

114
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:19,354
You can't expect them to be heroes.

115
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,648
- They're hostages.
- They are.

116
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:24,985
In a tyrant's grip.
Whose fault is that? Mine?

117
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,738
What does it matter whose fault it is?

118
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,657
Thousands of children will die
if the city burns.

119
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:34,077
Your sister knows how to use
her enemies' weaknesses against them.

120
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,705
That's what she thinks our mercy is:

121
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:37,831
weakness.

122
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:39,708
- I beg you, my queen...
- But she's wrong.

123
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,628
Mercy is our strength.

124
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:46,340
Our mercy towards future generations

125
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,800
who will never again
be held hostage by a tyrant.

126
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,892
Ready the Unsullied.

127
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,370
Tonight you sail for King's Landing
to join the Northern armies.

128
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:02,064
Cersei's followers will abandon her
if they know the war is lost.

129
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:03,315
Give them that chance.

130
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,653
If the city surrenders, they will
ring the bells and raise the gates.

131
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:11,114
Please, if you hear them ringing
the bells, call off the attack.

132
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:21,769
Wait for me
outside the city.

133
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:24,378
You'll know when it's time.

134
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:57,494
Your brother was stopped
trying to get past our lines.

135
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:05,586
It seems he hasn't abandoned
your sister after all.

136
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,051
The next time you fail me...

137
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,847
will be the last time you fail me.

138
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,115
Let them pass.

139
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:48,378
Through the gate.

140
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:49,963
Get going.

141
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,633
The rearguard
should be here by daybreak.

142
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,593
She wants to attack now.

143
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,347
Daybreak at the earliest.

144
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:43,725
- Careful with that.
- My lord.

145
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,021
Davos.

146
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,818
I need to ask you a favor.

147
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:57,614
You're the greatest smuggler alive,
aren't you?

148
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:01,410
I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?

149
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:05,247
He's always better
when he's got some food in him.

150
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,250
Problem is
when he's got drink in him.

151
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:11,262
- See what he did the other week?
- Aye. Fighting as well.

152
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,924
Ay up. Where you going?

153
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,344
I'm Arya Stark.

154
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:21,596
I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.

155
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,313
Think about it.
She kills Cersei, the war's over.

156
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:33,608
There won't be a siege.
You might not even die tomorrow.

157
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:38,142
I need to go talk to my captain.

158
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:40,782
Go ahead, talk to him.

159
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,911
Where's he going?

160
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,678
I drink to eat the skull keeper.

161
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:07,100
I want to eat the skull keeper.

162
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,358
I want to see the...

163
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,242
We speak the common tongue.

164
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:20,155
Ah. Good.

165
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:21,865
I want to be alone with the prisoner.

166
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:24,493
Get some rest.
Tomorrow will be a long day.

167
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,596
We have orders to guard the prisoner.

168
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,288
Ordered by whom? The queen herself?

169
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:30,499
No.

170
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:32,459
Well, in that case,
as Hand of the Queen,

171
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,419
I outrank whomever gave your order.

172
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:36,129
Probably by quite a lot.

173
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,696
How did they find you?

174
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,457
Did you consider taking it off?

175
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:17,379
Cersei once called me
"the stupidest Lannister."

176
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,175
You're going back to her,
to die with her.

177
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,803
You've underestimated her before.

178
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,388
She's going to die.

179
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:30,725
Unless you can convince her
to change her course of action.

180
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:32,769
Difficult to do from here.

181
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,403
When have I ever been able
to convince Cersei of anything?

182
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:42,571
Try.

183
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,574
If not for yourself, if not for her,

184
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:48,034
then for every one
of the million people in that city,

185
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:49,536
innocent or otherwise.

186
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:52,539
To be honest,
I never really cared much for them.

187
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,332
Innocent or otherwise.

188
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:57,669
You do care for one innocent.

189
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,171
I know you do.

190
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,756
And so does Cersei.

191
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:05,010
She has a reason now.

192
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:10,098
The child is the reason
she'll never give an inch.

193
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,935
All the worst things she's ever done,
she's done for her children.

194
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:16,771
It's not impossible that she'll win.

195
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:18,189
She won't.

196
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:21,610
Her enemy's forces have been depleted,
as she said they would be.

197
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:24,321
Two of the three dragons are dead.

198
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:26,573
- She's evened the odds.
- The city will fall tomorrow.

199
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:28,617
She has the Lannister army,
the Golden Company...

200
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,535
I defended the city
last time it was attacked.

201
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:32,996
I know it better than anyone.
It will fall tomorrow.

202
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,206
Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow,
if not before.

203
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,416
Why?

204
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,758
Escape.

205
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,843
The two of you, together.

206
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:48,637
Remember where we met,

207
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,014
where they keep the dragon skulls,
beneath the Red Keep?

208
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,059
Take her down there.

209
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:57,187
Keep following the stairways down,
down as far as they'll go.

210
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,606
You'll come out onto a beach
at the foot of the keep.

211
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:01,107
A dinghy will be waiting for you.

212
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,319
Sail out of the bay.

213
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:07,072
If the winds are kind,
you'll make it to Pentos.

214
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,033
Start a new life.

215
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:17,791
Sail right past the Iron Fleet
and into a new life?

216
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:20,085
Sounds a lot less likely
than Cersei winning this war.

217
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:22,629
There won't be an Iron Fleet
for much longer.

218
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,423
Do it.

219
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:28,301
If you don't,
you'll never see Cersei again.

220
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:35,600
Swear to me.

221
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,897
You have my word.

222
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:47,529
If it works,

223
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:51,408
give the order to ring all the bells
in King's Landing and open the gates.

224
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,427
That will be our signal
that the city has surrendered.

225
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:54,452
I'll try.

226
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:59,416
I never thought
I'd get to repay the favor.

227
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,960
Remember, ring the bells
and open the gates.

228
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:04,587
Your queen will execute you for this.

229
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:06,151
If Daenerys can make it to the throne

230
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:08,299
without wading through
a river of blood,

231
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:11,261
maybe she'll show mercy
to the person who made that possible.

232
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:20,603
Tens of thousands of innocent lives...

233
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,691
one not particularly innocent dwarf...

234
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:28,653
it seems like a fair trade.

235
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,579
If it weren't for you,

236
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,664
I never would've survived
my childhood.

237
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,168
You would have.

238
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,011
You were the only one

239
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:56,931
who didn't treat me like a monster.

240
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,311
You were all I had.

241
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:14,342
Eyes on the horizon!

242
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:17,804
Load the scorpion!

243
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,027
Archers, close up!

244
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:36,656
Up to the espringal!

245
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,449
To the back of it!

246
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:52,547
Archers, line up!

247
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,307
This way! Come on!

248
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,808
Clear the streets now!

249
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:06,186
- No!
- In, now.

250
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:08,438
- And you, come on.
- Inside, now!

251
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,315
Quickly.

252
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:13,234
Yes. Follow down there.
They're here. Get to the Red Keep.

253
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:16,863
- My son!
- Get inside!

254
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,244
Just ahead of you,
I can see it!

255
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:24,829
All right, move it!

256
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:26,664
- Come on!
- Keep moving!

257
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:28,267
- Keep going!
- Keep moving!

258
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,376
- Quickly!
- All the way!

259
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,711
- Come on!
- Come on!

260
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:47,644
Keep moving!

261
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:51,022
Make way
for the Golden Company!

262
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:01,366
Close the gate!

263
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:08,099
If you hear the bells ring,
they've surrendered.

264
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,518
Call off your men.

265
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,116
Move along now, lads.

266
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,439
- That's it.
- Go on, move it.

267
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:03,363
Come on, move, move. Faster, faster.
Come on, move it.

268
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:05,365
- Keep going.
- Keep moving.

269
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:11,371
- Move.
- Stay with him.

270
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,332
- Hold on.
- Hold my hand.

271
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:15,500
Get behind her.

272
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,210
Close the gate!

273
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,926
- No.
- No, Mommy.

274
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:27,887
- Let me in! Please!
- No, please, sir!

275
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,098
- Open the gate!
- Close the gate!

276
00:31:30,181 --> 00:31:32,225
- Open it!
- Open the gate!

277
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:36,062
- Get back.
- Look, go over there. Go. Go.

278
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:43,861
The gates are locked now!

279
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:47,532
Open! Open the gate!

280
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:50,993
Soldier! Soldier!

281
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:53,371
- Please open the gate!
- Go back to your homes!

282
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:54,956
Stay back! It's closed!

283
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,499
Soldier!

284
00:31:58,251 --> 00:31:59,919
Move away! Stop!

285
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:01,504
Let us in!

286
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:06,092
We're not leaving!

287
00:33:15,036 --> 00:33:16,370
Turn!

288
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:40,353
- Turn it around!
- Turn it around!

289
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:43,731
Get back! Back!

290
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,238
Fire!

291
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:13,970
Ready!

292
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:15,346
Move!

293
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:18,683
Fire!

294
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,897
- Reload!
- Reload!

295
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:26,649
Faster!

296
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:27,900
Hurry!

297
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,244
Fire!

298
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:00,821
Go!

299
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,910
Run!

300
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,049
Your Grace.

301
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,511
All we need is one good shot.

302
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:27,181
The scorpions have
all been destroyed, Your Grace.

303
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:31,852
The Iron Fleet hold Blackwater Bay.

304
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:35,689
Euron killed one of her dragons.

305
00:38:35,773 --> 00:38:36,899
He can kill another.

306
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:39,443
Your Grace,
the Iron Fleet is burning.

307
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:42,321
The gates have been breached.

308
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:43,572
The Golden Company...

309
00:38:43,656 --> 00:38:46,784
Our men will fight harder
than sellswords ever could.

310
00:38:48,953 --> 00:38:51,080
They will defend their queen
to the last man.

311
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:52,498
Yes, Your Grace.

312
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:54,208
The Red Keep has never fallen.

313
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:55,876
It won't fall today.

314
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:26,949
No, no!

315
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,412
Move, move!

316
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:33,474
Run.

317
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:36,769
Run!

318
00:40:36,852 --> 00:40:37,853
Come on!

319
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:32,241
- Ring the bells!
- Ring the bells!

320
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:35,160
The bells!

321
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:37,496
- Ring the bells!
- Ring the bells!

322
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:40,666
Ring the bloody bells!

323
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:43,502
- Ring the bells!
- Ring the bells!

324
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:47,482
- Tell the queen to ring the bells.
- Ring the bells!

325
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:48,674
Ring the bell!

326
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:58,642
This way.

327
00:42:03,897 --> 00:42:05,607
Ring the bell!

328
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,068
Ring the bell!

329
00:42:08,152 --> 00:42:09,570
Ring them!

330
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:14,783
Ring the bells!

331
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:19,872
Ring the bells!

332
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:24,251
- Ring the bells!
- Help us!

333
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:25,878
In the name of the...

334
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,766
- Ring the bells!
- Now! Come on!

335
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:46,940
Hurry up!

336
00:42:56,784 --> 00:42:58,077
Ring the bells!

337
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:24,097
No!

338
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:25,265
Get back!

339
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:26,433
Get back!

340
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:30,020
Stay! Stay!

341
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:05,449
Quickly. Quickly.

342
00:47:07,701 --> 00:47:09,202
Stop!

343
00:47:30,557 --> 00:47:32,726
- Come here!
- Get off him!

344
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:35,771
- Get off me! Get off!
- No, get off! Help! Help!

345
00:47:36,563 --> 00:47:37,647
No!

346
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:08,762
Go!

347
00:48:09,638 --> 00:48:10,639
Go!

348
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:50,720
Find somewhere to hide.

349
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:36,850
The Kingslayer.

350
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:42,814
We need to get the queen
out of King's Landing.

351
00:49:42,898 --> 00:49:43,940
Listen.

352
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:47,694
That's the sound of a city dying.

353
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:51,448
It's over.

354
00:49:51,531 --> 00:49:53,325
Well, maybe for you.

355
00:49:54,493 --> 00:49:57,454
If you kill another king
before you die...

356
00:49:58,622 --> 00:50:00,332
they'll sing about you forever.

357
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:03,043
You're no king.

358
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:04,586
Oh, but I am.

359
00:50:06,379 --> 00:50:08,131
And I the queen.

360
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,761
If I win...

361
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:18,600
I'll bring your head to Cersei
so you can kiss her one last time.

362
00:52:02,454 --> 00:52:04,623
Your Grace, it isn't safe here
any longer.

363
00:52:04,706 --> 00:52:06,791
The Red Keep is the safest place
in the city.

364
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:10,086
The Unsullied have breached
the gates of the Red Keep.

365
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:23,183
Maegor's Holdfast would be
a better place to wait out the storm.

366
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:02,097
You fought well...

367
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:04,933
for a cripple.

368
00:53:49,269 --> 00:53:50,603
Another king for you.

369
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:06,828
But I got you!

370
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:11,124
I got you!

371
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:20,508
I'm the man
who killed Jaime Lannister.

372
00:54:44,866 --> 00:54:45,992
Go home, girl.

373
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,538
The fire will get her,
or one of the Dothraki.

374
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,666
Or maybe that dragon will eat her.

375
00:54:54,626 --> 00:54:56,252
It doesn't matter. She's dead.

376
00:54:56,878 --> 00:54:59,422
And you'll be dead too
if you don't get out of here.

377
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:01,883
I'm going to kill her.

378
00:55:03,593 --> 00:55:06,346
You think you wanted revenge
a long time?

379
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:08,056
I've been after it all my life.

380
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:10,308
It's all I care about.

381
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:12,435
And look at me. Look at me!

382
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:16,481
You wanna be like me?

383
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:27,325
You come with me, you die here.

384
00:55:41,506 --> 00:55:42,799
Sandor.

385
00:55:49,806 --> 00:55:50,974
Thank you.

386
00:56:53,912 --> 00:56:55,038
Your Grace.

387
00:57:12,722 --> 00:57:14,057
Hello, big brother.

388
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:22,649
Ser Gregor, stay by my side.

389
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,327
Ser Gregor, I command you.

390
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,954
Obey your queen, Ser Gregor.

391
00:58:33,302 --> 00:58:35,972
Yeah, that's you.

392
00:58:38,266 --> 00:58:40,059
That's what you've always been.

393
01:00:14,987 --> 01:00:16,114
You're hurt.

394
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:19,367
It doesn't matter.

395
01:00:27,083 --> 01:00:28,376
You're bleeding.

396
01:02:11,437 --> 01:02:12,605
Alanna!

397
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:15,858
Alanna! Have you seen my wife?

398
01:02:15,942 --> 01:02:17,777
Have you seen my wife?

399
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:19,528
- Let go.
- Have you seen my wife?

400
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:36,587
Out of the way!

401
01:03:04,699 --> 01:03:05,825
No!

402
01:03:36,522 --> 01:03:37,523
Oh.

403
01:04:07,386 --> 01:04:08,763
Take my hand.

404
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:10,014
Take my hand.

405
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:12,933
Get up. Get up.

406
01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:24,153
- No. No.
- Wait! Wait!

407
01:04:24,236 --> 01:04:25,279
No!

408
01:05:09,698 --> 01:05:11,033
Die!

409
01:06:44,919 --> 01:06:47,254
We need to fall back!

410
01:06:47,338 --> 01:06:49,798
Fall back behind the wall!

411
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:52,927
- Fall back!
- Fall back!

412
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:54,637
Get out of the city!

413
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:57,389
Fall back!

414
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,895
Fall back!

415
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:04,298
- Fall back!
- Fall back!

416
01:09:00,387 --> 01:09:02,014
You can't stay here.

417
01:09:02,848 --> 01:09:04,516
You have to keep moving.

418
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,268
We can't go out there.

419
01:09:06,352 --> 01:09:07,436
You have to.

420
01:09:08,437 --> 01:09:10,147
Everyone out there is dead.

421
01:09:11,565 --> 01:09:13,776
If you stay here, you'll die.

422
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:16,362
Follow me.

423
01:09:18,197 --> 01:09:19,365
Follow me!

424
01:09:23,202 --> 01:09:26,497
- Come on, quickly. Come to me.
- It's safer up there.

425
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:28,457
Come on, quickly. All of you.

426
01:09:32,378 --> 01:09:33,379
Run!

427
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:40,636
Run!

428
01:09:45,099 --> 01:09:46,141
Mama!

429
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:48,435
Mama!

430
01:09:48,519 --> 01:09:50,479
Mama! No.

431
01:09:50,562 --> 01:09:52,523
Mama! Mama!

432
01:09:53,774 --> 01:09:54,858
Mama!

433
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:01,323
Get up.

434
01:10:01,407 --> 01:10:02,449
Get up!

435
01:10:06,787 --> 01:10:08,038
We have to keep moving.

436
01:10:09,498 --> 01:10:10,999
Take her.

437
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:12,418
Take her!

438
01:10:13,168 --> 01:10:15,003
- Take her.
- Come on!

439
01:10:15,629 --> 01:10:16,672
Come on!

440
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:38,819
This way.

441
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:30,537
I want our baby to live.

442
01:11:33,999 --> 01:11:35,834
I want our baby to live.

443
01:11:38,921 --> 01:11:40,756
I want our baby to live.

444
01:11:42,508 --> 01:11:43,943
Don't let me die, Jaime.

445
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:45,969
- Please don't let me die.
- It's all right.

446
01:11:46,053 --> 01:11:47,846
- Please don't let me die.
- It's all right.

447
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:49,097
I don't want to die.

448
01:11:51,934 --> 01:11:53,685
Just look... Look at me.

449
01:11:53,769 --> 01:11:55,813
- Look at me.
- Not like this.

450
01:11:55,896 --> 01:11:59,233
- Not like this. Not like this.
- Look... Look... Look me in the eye.

451
01:11:59,316 --> 01:12:00,734
Don't look away. Don't look...

452
01:12:00,818 --> 01:12:03,028
Look at me! Just look at me.

453
01:12:07,533 --> 01:12:09,743
Nothing else matters.

454
01:12:12,329 --> 01:12:14,289
Nothing else matters.

455
01:12:14,373 --> 01:12:15,749
Only us.
