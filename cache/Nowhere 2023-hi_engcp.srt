Ireland has ruled in opposition to it.

Doesn't matter.
Governments are falling everywhere.

It's impossible to overthrow them.

I mean it.

Well, I think she's a girl, a warrior.

140

Just like her mother.

141

I don't feel her.

What?

143
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,667

Dunno.

Haven't you noticed?

I know that the austerity measures
have been cruel.

They're especially hard
on women and children.

I understand
if you don't think you can trust me.

308
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:10,417
It's hard to know
who to trust, right? Hmm?

309
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,917
Not those who forced you
into this container.

310
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,281
They stuffed you in here
with barely enough air to breathe

311
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,708
and robbed you
of all the money you had left.

00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:19,083
And they promised you…

[chuckles]

314
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:23,042

They lied.

316

A better place doesn't exist.

317
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,292
So you should come out.

318
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,208
Because if you don't, I'll have to shoot.

319
