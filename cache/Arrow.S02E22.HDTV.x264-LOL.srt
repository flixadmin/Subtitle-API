1
00:00:01,087 --> 00:00:02,221
Previously, on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:02,467 --> 00:00:04,483
Tonight
we rise up as one

3
00:00:04,585 --> 00:00:06,085
and take back
this city.

4
00:00:06,087 --> 00:00:08,320
Slade's got 20 guys
just like him,

5
00:00:08,322 --> 00:00:09,822
and we have
no way to stop him.

6
00:00:09,824 --> 00:00:12,691
Mirakuru. We're going
to use it to make a cure.

7
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:15,995
Slade promised me city
hall, and he delivered.

8
00:00:15,997 --> 00:00:18,264
I understand he made you
a promise, too.

9
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:22,301
There is still
one person who has to die.

10
00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:25,771
What's happening
is bigger than you and the city.

11
00:00:25,773 --> 00:00:28,340
There's so many of them!
We can't fight!

12
00:00:28,342 --> 00:00:30,776
We're not going to.

13
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:03,409
Laurel.

14
00:01:08,014 --> 00:01:11,183
Laurel?

15
00:01:11,185 --> 00:01:13,018
Laurel!

16
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,058
You killed me...

17
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,594
Let me return
the favor.

18
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:29,468
You can't kill me.

19
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,670
You're not invincible.

20
00:01:31,672 --> 00:01:33,472
Close enough.

21
00:01:33,474 --> 00:01:35,140
Laurel!

22
00:01:35,642 --> 00:01:38,143
Oliver!

23
00:01:38,145 --> 00:01:40,879
Are you ok?

24
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:43,048
The tunnel collapsed.

25
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,117
I'm trapped.

26
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,885
I just...

27
00:01:46,887 --> 00:01:50,155
It's getting really...

28
00:01:50,157 --> 00:01:51,356
Hard to breathe!

29
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:53,024
You are going
to be ok.

30
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:55,761
I need you to tell me
everything that you see.

31
00:01:55,763 --> 00:02:00,098
Rocks, and water, and--

32
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:02,801
and your bow.

33
00:02:02,803 --> 00:02:05,103
You see my quiver?!

34
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:11,643
Wait! Yeah, yes,
I have it! I have it.

35
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:12,911
How many arrows
are in it?

36
00:02:12,913 --> 00:02:14,746
There's a bunch of them.

37
00:02:14,748 --> 00:02:17,249
There should be one
with a metallic head

38
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:18,984
that's bigger than
the rest of them.

39
00:02:18,986 --> 00:02:20,452
Do you see it?

40
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:22,287
Why do I need this?

41
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:26,491
Because it's
an explosive arrow.

42
00:02:26,493 --> 00:02:30,095
And you're going
to fire it.

43
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,439
Do you want to save me
some time and energy?

44
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:44,776
Then tell me where I can
find Felicity Smoak.

45
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:47,813
I have been aching
to put a bullet in her

46
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:51,116
smug little face
ever since the day--

47
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,622
Oh, I really thought
the airbags were going to go off.

48
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:03,028
Thanks for the help.

49
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,130
Any word from Oliver?

50
00:03:06,499 --> 00:03:09,301
Dig...

51
00:03:09,303 --> 00:03:11,670
What do you think,
hit her again?

52
00:03:11,672 --> 00:03:13,972
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

53
00:04:00,786 --> 00:04:04,122
Get out! Get out!

54
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:07,292
Get out!

55
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,334
Reports are coming in
from all over the city.

56
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:18,370
Starling General
is preparing for possible casualties.

57
00:04:18,372 --> 00:04:20,238
Power is out south
of Harbor Boulevard.

58
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,707
Governor. Governor.

59
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:24,843
Sending in the National
Guard at this point

60
00:04:24,845 --> 00:04:26,845
will only cause
mass hysteria.

61
00:04:26,847 --> 00:04:28,113
Trust me
and my police force.

62
00:04:28,115 --> 00:04:30,582
We have this situation
under control.

63
00:04:31,131 --> 00:04:33,580
Mr. Mayor.
D.A. Spencer.

64
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,000
What is going on?

65
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,542
There are men in masks
tearing through the city.

66
00:04:37,658 --> 00:04:39,257
Yes, I know. And we're doing
everything we can.

67
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:41,092
The SCPD have
already mobilized.

68
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:42,394
No, the police
force, they're not

69
00:04:42,396 --> 00:04:43,929
equipped
to handle this.

70
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:45,530
You don't
understand.

71
00:04:45,532 --> 00:04:47,732
I have never seen anything
like this before.

72
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:49,034
These--the men
in masks,

73
00:04:49,036 --> 00:04:51,269
it--it's like
they're not human.

74
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:52,570
Not human?

75
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:54,139
Kate, do you even hear yourself?

76
00:04:54,141 --> 00:04:55,540
Look, I know you're scared,

77
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:57,776
but you need to pull
yourself together.

78
00:04:57,778 --> 00:05:01,079
Starling City needs both of us
thinking clearly right now.

79
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:03,982
How are you so calm?

80
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:10,021
Because I know we're going
to get through this.

81
00:05:10,023 --> 00:05:13,491
And when we do, Starling City will be
stronger and better for it.

82
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:15,760
Can I count on you?

83
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:17,829
I need you with me on this.

84
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:19,864
Mm-hmm.

85
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:21,633
Good.

86
00:05:21,635 --> 00:05:23,501
Then let's save
the city together.

87
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:31,476
Are you far enough away from the debris
to avoid the blast?

88
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:33,178
I don't know!

89
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,247
What if I can't shoot that far?

90
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:37,816
The bow's a hybrid
compound, Laurel.

91
00:05:37,818 --> 00:05:39,384
It's going to do
all the work for you.

92
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:41,152
All I need you to do...

93
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:44,155
Just aim at the middle
of the debris.

94
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:46,391
Take a deep breath.

95
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:48,393
Center your feet.

96
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:50,762
Left hand on the bow.

97
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:53,398
Place the arrow
on the drawstring.

98
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,001
Ok, ok, ok, ok, ok.

99
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:59,971
All right,
I want you to pull back

100
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:02,107
on the drawstring.

101
00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:06,011
And keep
your left arm straight.

102
00:06:06,013 --> 00:06:08,046
Ok?

103
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:09,614
You count to three

104
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:12,050
and then you just
let go.

105
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:14,319
You can do this.

106
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:20,325
1, 2...

107
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:24,729
3!

108
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:48,353
Nice shot.

109
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:55,960
Diggle, you there?

110
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:57,395
Yeah, Oliver, we hear you.

111
00:06:57,397 --> 00:06:59,764
We're coming up.

112
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:08,039
Sara's gone.

113
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,741
Slade must have taken her.

114
00:07:09,743 --> 00:07:11,376
Chert.

115
00:07:11,378 --> 00:07:13,211
What's that?

116
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:17,582
It's sonar.
I was monitoring the "Amazo."

117
00:07:17,584 --> 00:07:19,784
She's moving.

118
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,456
We have one torpedo
left, right?

119
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:26,257
Da.

120
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:28,626
Could you rig it to fire
in a straight line?

121
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:31,029
I'm discovering capacity
to do many things

122
00:07:31,031 --> 00:07:33,198
I never thought
I would do.

123
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:36,367
I need you

124
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:38,303
to get the sub close enough
to the freighter

125
00:07:38,305 --> 00:07:40,238
so that I can swim over.

126
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:46,377
Well, then, what do you need
torpedo for?

127
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:49,280
If Sara and I
aren't back in an hour...

128
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:52,784
You're going to sink
the "Amazo."

129
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,428
Freeze!

130
00:08:28,353 --> 00:08:31,255
Who are you?

131
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:38,128
I'm her father.

132
00:08:38,153 --> 00:08:42,153

134

Dad!

135
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,306
Laurel, thank God.

136
00:08:49,308 --> 00:08:51,108
Are you safe?

137
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,643
I am now.

138
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:54,311
I'm with the Arrow.

139
00:08:54,313 --> 00:08:56,446
Well, that's--
that's good.

140
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:59,783
Now listen, something tells me
he's got work to do.

141
00:08:59,785 --> 00:09:02,085
I want you off the streets.
Yeah.

142
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:04,621
Laurel, please, keep low, keep out
of sight, all right?

143
00:09:04,623 --> 00:09:07,658
Dad, I know, you don't have
to worry...about me.

144
00:09:18,303 --> 00:09:20,971
- You ok?
- Yeah.

145
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,569
You?

146
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,521
Isabel attacked Dig so I hit her
with the van.

147
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:26,400
Slade's army.

148
00:09:26,402 --> 00:09:28,302
He has at least
50 men out there,

149
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:30,204
all like him.
They're everywhere.

150
00:09:30,206 --> 00:09:31,639
We need
to stop them.

151
00:09:31,641 --> 00:09:33,741
We might have a way.
S.T.A.R. Labs called.

152
00:09:33,743 --> 00:09:36,444
They have a cure.
There's a courier en route.

153
00:09:36,446 --> 00:09:37,912
Where is it?

154
00:09:50,392 --> 00:09:52,326
Hello?

155
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:54,128
Hey, it's Felicity Smoak.
Where are you?

156
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,732
Fourth street, I think. I don't
know what happened.

157
00:09:57,734 --> 00:10:00,735
A guy in a hockey mask came out
of nowhere and attacked my truck.

158
00:10:00,737 --> 00:10:02,737
Please help me.
Stay where you are.

159
00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:04,171
I can't move
even if I wanted to.

160
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:07,375
I think my leg's broken.
You should go.

161
00:10:07,377 --> 00:10:09,076
Laurel, I'm not leaving you out here
in the middle of this.

162
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:10,811
The precinct,
it's in the other direction.

163
00:10:10,813 --> 00:10:13,047
I'll be fine.

164
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:14,115
No.

165
00:10:14,117 --> 00:10:15,416
I don't need you right now.

166
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:17,551
Everyone else does.

167
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:22,256
So go.

168
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:24,659
Go save the city.

169
00:10:27,229 --> 00:10:29,630
Hey!
You still there?

170
00:10:29,632 --> 00:10:31,932
Yeah, I'm here.
I pinged your phone.

171
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:33,301
On our way.

172
00:10:33,303 --> 00:10:36,504
Please hurry.

173
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:38,906
Find him.

174
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:58,389
In the last five minutes,
SCPD has had over 200 reports

175
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,524
of masked men
attacking the city.

176
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:06,063
Should have gone with Laurel
and made sure she got to the precinct.

177
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,432
She'll be with her father,
she'll be fine.

178
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,200
She will, Oliver.

179
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:19,743
All right.

180
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:23,280
We are 10 meters away
from the freighter.

181
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,282
But still,
this is sumassed shitty crazy.

182
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:28,619
Crazy. You cannot
even be certain that Wilson has her.

183
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,320
You're a good man, Anatoly.

184
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,990
If this is good-bye, be safe.

185
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,025
I will see you soon.
You and Sara.

186
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,260
I meant what I said.

187
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,328
If we're not back
in an hour,

188
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,197
you sink the freighter
and get yourself home.

189
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,267
I think maybe
I prefer Bahamas.

190
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:48,405
Oliver.

191
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,941
I don't know if we will see
each other again.

192
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,177
But know that you have made
friend for life.

193
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:57,481
If there is anything you need,
it does not matter what...

194
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,683
You have only to ask.

195
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:06,490
Prochnost,
my friend.

196
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,158
Proch--prochnost.

197
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,161
Prochnost--proch--
I also teach you to speak Russian.

198
00:12:18,436 --> 00:12:20,270
Listen up. We're going
to establish a perimeter

199
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,072
with check-points
at 5th and Adams,

200
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,841
2nd and Kingsley. We got to create
a safe zone, you hear me?

201
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,075
Who the hell
are these guys?

202
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,810
These guys are the enemy.

203
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,846
They're attacking
innocents at random,

204
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,614
creating mayhem
and chaos.

205
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:31,782
We need
to put them down.

206
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,317
Lieutenant--
now!

207
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,685
Listen to me, these guys,
have you seen them?

208
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,087
Huh? You seen these guys?
They do not go down!

209
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,622
We got to call in
the National Guard.

210
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,290
That's a call
for the mayor.

211
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,491
And he hasn't
made that yet.

212
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:42,860
And he won't.

213
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,295
Mayor Blood
let this happen.

214
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,865
What?
Trust me.

215
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,000
Blood's behind this.

216
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,436
Look, even
if I believe you...

217
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,504
I don't have
that kind of authority.

218
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:56,173
Well, in an emergency,
the chief of police does,

219
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,374
so get him on the line.

220
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,476
Chief's dead.

221
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:03,981
Well, then...

222
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:07,217
There's only
one more guy we can call.

223
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,886
You're not going
to like it.

224
00:13:10,521 --> 00:13:12,256
The Vigilante.

225
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,790
The Arrow.

226
00:13:16,694 --> 00:13:17,995
Lieutenant,

227
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,241
I know he's
breaking the law.

228
00:13:19,242 --> 00:13:20,894
But what we're up against,
it's not about the law.

229
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,400
It's about survival.

230
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,534
We got masks tearing
our city to pieces,

231
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:27,404
and we're going to need
a mask to stop 'em.

232
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:35,379
Make the call.

233
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:37,514
Ok, let's do it.

234
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,850
One more thing--

235
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:43,453
you know more about what's going
on over everyone else I got.

236
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,590
I need you making decisions
and leading these men...

237
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,292
Detective.

238
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:10,180
Follow me. I can
get you to safety.

239
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:22,326
Sara...

240
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:34,037
We lost contact
with our reporter on the streets,

241
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,874
but we have over two dozen confirmed
sightings of masked men

242
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:39,710
attacking numerous
municipal locations.

243
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,846
Officials are asking
that you stay indoors...

244
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,095
Stop!
No, no, no!

245
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,396
Enough!

246
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,797
This isn't part of the plan!

247
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,999
Sebastian?!

248
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,934
I am mayor of Starling City,

249
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:06,436
and I order you to let her go.

250
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:13,076
I don't take
orders from you.

251
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:23,220
No...

252
00:15:30,928 --> 00:15:34,731
Any word
from Thea? Is she safe?

253
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:37,000
She decided
to leave Starling

254
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,568
before the attacks started.

255
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,204
Just under two miles
to the bridge. And the courier.

256
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,473
It's for you.

257
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:47,310
What is it, Detective?

258
00:15:47,312 --> 00:15:49,146
How can we help you?
We?

259
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,580
The Starling City
police force

260
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:51,815
is standing with you
on this one.

261
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,950
We need help
containing the soldiers.

262
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:55,787
We're working something
and it may stop them

263
00:15:55,812 --> 00:15:57,588
but we need more time.

264
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,957
We can do that. Whatever you're
doing, good luck.

265
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,493
For all our sakes.

266
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:10,100
This is the only street
that feeds into the bridge.

267
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:15,672
Floor it!

268
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,485
Hold on!

269
00:16:52,964 --> 00:16:55,932
Dig?

270
00:16:57,468 --> 00:16:58,702
Diggle!

271
00:16:58,704 --> 00:17:00,570
Yeah, yeah.

272
00:17:00,572 --> 00:17:02,239
Is she breathing?

273
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,876
Felicity!
Yeah, yeah.

274
00:17:05,878 --> 00:17:07,210
Then we have
to get out of here.

275
00:17:07,212 --> 00:17:09,780
Yeah, I'm on it.

276
00:18:03,394 --> 00:18:05,662
Thea!

277
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:08,265
I'm not here to hurt you.

278
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:12,135
Why should I
believe you?

279
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:14,525
You're
a murderer!

280
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:17,894
Terrorist,
and psychopath!

281
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,397
I don't expect you
to understand what I've done.

282
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,199
Not now.

283
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,001
Not without more time
to explain.

284
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:29,206
How are you
even alive?

285
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,842
Why are here?

286
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,343
I heard what happened
to your mother.

287
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,846
I needed to make sure
you were all right.

288
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,547
I needed to see my daughter.

289
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:41,918
I am not
your daughter!

290
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,020
You're nothing to me!

291
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:46,089
And I want nothing
from you.

292
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,657
Do you understand?

293
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,360
Yes. But right now,

294
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,429
you need my help.

295
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,531
My protection.

296
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,933
You have no idea, Thea,
how dangerous it is out there.

297
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:01,471
The city is falling. At least let me
take you to safety.

298
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:19,956
They say Nero sang

299
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,425
as he watched
Rome burn.

300
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,195
Now I understand why.

301
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:29,733
If only Shado were here
to witness this.

302
00:19:32,203 --> 00:19:34,404
Who's Shado?

303
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,473
What the hell is going on?

304
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,509
Once of your juiced-up jack boots
just killed my entire office staff,

305
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,478
and snapped
the district attorney's neck!

306
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,548
And?
And.

307
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,550
And I never agreed to this!

308
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,718
You were supposed
to call off your dogs.

309
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,622
That was your plan,
Mr. Blood, not mine.

310
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,358
We had a deal.

311
00:19:58,162 --> 00:20:02,632
And do you feel that
I've not lived up to my end of it?

312
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:07,204
Those are innocent people.

313
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,073
Dying out there.

314
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,908
You do not need to kill them.

315
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,777
Yes, I do!

316
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,713
I made a promise
to someone once,

317
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,217
and I will uphold it.

318
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,687
So this really is
all about you

319
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,890
just trying to hurt
Oliver Queen.

320
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,592
I vowed to him

321
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,428
that I would
take away everything

322
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,498
and everyone he loves.

323
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,301
And he loves this city.

324
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,270
But this city...

325
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,939
It's mine, too.

326
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,442
Not anymore.

327
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,210
As of tomorrow night,

328
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:51,448
it'll be nothing but
rubble, ash, and death.

329
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,484
A land only good
for one thing.

330
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:58,989
Graves.

331
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:07,998
Oh, my God.

332
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:22,112
Sara...

333
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,980
Where have you been?

334
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:27,050
Doesn't matter.

335
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:29,819
Why did you come back?

336
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:31,855
I don't know.

337
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:34,357
There isn't anything
here for me.

338
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,962
Your family's here.

339
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:51,141
You don't know,
Laurel, about me.

340
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,377
About who I am
and who I've become.

341
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,881
I know you're a hero.

342
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,683
I'm not a hero...

343
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,118
Laurel.

344
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,522
I am the furthest
thing from it.

345
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,757
I am "Ta-er Sah-fer."

346
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,026
That was my new name.

347
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:11,895
Because the woman
that I was...

348
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:16,099
The girl that I was,

349
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:19,669
was gone.

350
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,838
I'm not going to pretend
that I've been through

351
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,074
anything that you have.

352
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:27,510
One thing that I've learned
in the past year

353
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,879
is that these things...

354
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,882
They don't break us.

355
00:22:34,585 --> 00:22:37,087
They make us who we are.

356
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:41,257
And what I am...

357
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:44,227
is irredeemable.

358
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,463
What was that word
you said before?

359
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:49,299
Ta-er Sah-fer.

360
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,202
What does that mean?

361
00:22:55,573 --> 00:22:58,241
It means
"The Canary."

362
00:23:00,211 --> 00:23:02,645
If you're so far gone

363
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:05,715
and so irredeemable...

364
00:23:10,187 --> 00:23:12,622
Then why would they know you
by such a beautiful name?

365
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:47,123
Ollie! Ollie!

366
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,125
Ollie, Ollie, Ollie!
Thank God!

367
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,527
Ollie, Ollie...

368
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,395
Come with me.

369
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:54,564
All right,
come with me.

370
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:56,232
The sub is right
alongside the freighter.

371
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:57,600
You just need
to swim, ok?

372
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,568
Ok.

373
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,702
Ok, what
are you doing?

374
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,272
I can't leave yet.

375
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,807
Ollie, come on.

376
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,575
The cure.
No!

377
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,144
I can't--I can't
leave Slade behind.

378
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,780
I'm not just going to--
I'm not just going to write him off.

379
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,649
We injected him
with the Mirakuru.

380
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,484
But it was me--
Ollie.

381
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,653
I chose you over Shado.

382
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:19,255
I--I just--I just
want to go home.

383
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,825
I just want to see
my family, Ollie.

384
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,529
Come on, please!

385
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:29,165
I need to do this.

386
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,067
I need to save my friend.

387
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,436
I need to at least try.

388
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:38,975
Get to the sub.

389
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:42,312
Get safe.

390
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,581
Not without you.

391
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,850
Sara...

392
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:49,018
Come on.

393
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,390
It's Dad.

394
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,692
Hello?

395
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,126
Laurel, baby,
where are you?

396
00:24:57,128 --> 00:24:59,529
55th and Alfred--
there were a few roadblocks.

397
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:02,699
But you're ok?
Yeah. Sara's with me.

398
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,869
Right. Ok. Listen,
stay there, both of you.

399
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,737
I'm on my way.

400
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,507
I can walk.
Where is he?

401
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,877
The cell phone GPS says he should
be within a 500-foot radius.

402
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,512
I'll call him.

403
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,516
Hey, where are you?

404
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,751
We're here, where are you?
Honk your horn.

405
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,186
Cool. Hold on.

406
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,657
Wait! I can see your feet.

407
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,459
You're standing
right outside my car.

408
00:25:30,761 --> 00:25:32,362
That's not us.

409
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:47,744
Oh, no!

410
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:51,948
It's gone.

411
00:25:59,323 --> 00:26:01,291
The situation has intensified

412
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,427
as officials struggle
to contain this historic assault

413
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:05,995
gripping our city.

414
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:09,365
Mr. Wilson. Is this
what you're looking for?

415
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,974
Yes, it is.

416
00:26:31,951 --> 00:26:34,152
I just got off the phone
with Cisco at S.T.A.R. Labs...

417
00:26:34,154 --> 00:26:36,521
The cure they sent us
was all they had.

418
00:26:36,523 --> 00:26:39,024
And they used all the Mirakuru
that we gave them,

419
00:26:39,026 --> 00:26:40,692
so they can't make more.

420
00:26:40,694 --> 00:26:44,563
We can't stop Slade's
men without the cure.

421
00:26:44,565 --> 00:26:45,764
We'll find
another way.

422
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:47,199
There is no other way!

423
00:26:47,201 --> 00:26:49,735
Diggle, the foundry's
been compromised

424
00:26:49,737 --> 00:26:51,403
and we need to get
Roy out of there.

425
00:26:51,405 --> 00:26:54,506
I'm on it.

426
00:26:59,846 --> 00:27:01,980
I didn't
know, Felicity.

427
00:27:01,982 --> 00:27:04,816
Five years ago, I was
a completely different person.

428
00:27:04,818 --> 00:27:06,518
And I had...

429
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:11,523
No idea that something like
this was even...

430
00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:15,260
Possible. I couldn't
have imagined.

431
00:27:15,262 --> 00:27:19,197
When you and Diggle
brought me back to Starling City,

432
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:22,100
I made a vow to myself
that I would never let anything

433
00:27:22,102 --> 00:27:24,903
like the Undertaking
happen again.

434
00:27:24,905 --> 00:27:26,638
What's happening now
is not your fault.

435
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,641
Yes, it is.

436
00:27:29,643 --> 00:27:33,945
I have failed
this city.

437
00:27:33,947 --> 00:27:36,114
Yao Fei.

438
00:27:36,116 --> 00:27:38,717
Shado.
Tommy.

439
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:41,319
My father,
my mother.

440
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:45,190
All that I have
ever wanted to do

441
00:27:45,192 --> 00:27:47,359
is honor those people.

442
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:49,928
You honor the dead by fighting.

443
00:27:51,831 --> 00:27:54,833
And you are not done fighting!

444
00:27:55,835 --> 00:27:58,336
Malcolm Merlyn,

445
00:27:58,338 --> 00:28:00,472
the Count,
the Clock King,

446
00:28:00,474 --> 00:28:03,542
the Triad--everyone who is
trying to hurt this city,

447
00:28:03,544 --> 00:28:05,343
you stopped them.

448
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,681
And you will stop Slade.

449
00:28:09,683 --> 00:28:12,083
I don't know how.
Neither do I.

450
00:28:12,085 --> 00:28:15,654
But I do know
two things.

451
00:28:15,656 --> 00:28:18,824
You are not alone.

452
00:28:22,094 --> 00:28:23,929
And I believe in you.

453
00:28:36,142 --> 00:28:38,977
Where's Dad?
He should be here by now.

454
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:41,246
You should get
to a better vantage point.

455
00:28:41,248 --> 00:28:44,316
Somebody help!
Please, help!

456
00:28:44,318 --> 00:28:47,185
Please!
Stay here.

457
00:28:49,488 --> 00:28:52,858
Someone help!
Please help!

458
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,960
Someone help!

459
00:28:54,962 --> 00:28:57,462
Please!

460
00:28:57,464 --> 00:29:01,166
My daughter is still inside,
I couldn't get to her!

461
00:29:01,168 --> 00:29:03,668
Don't, it's too dangerous!

462
00:29:06,105 --> 00:29:07,739
Laurel!
Dad!

463
00:29:07,741 --> 00:29:08,773
Are you hurt?

464
00:29:08,775 --> 00:29:10,775
No, I'm fine.
I'm ok.

465
00:29:10,777 --> 00:29:13,044
My daughter's still inside,
I couldn't get to her!

466
00:29:13,046 --> 00:29:15,480
Dad!

467
00:29:16,782 --> 00:29:20,385
Delta Charlie 52
to Central, copy!

468
00:29:20,387 --> 00:29:23,188
Delta Charlie 52
to Central, copy!

469
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:27,192
Delta Charlie 52 to Central,
please copy me, now!

470
00:29:28,427 --> 00:29:31,897
Delta Charlie 52 to Central--
Dad.

471
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:40,205
My baby, my baby!

472
00:29:50,918 --> 00:29:54,119
Oh, my baby.

473
00:29:54,121 --> 00:29:57,155
Who was that?

474
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:01,526
That's the Canary.

475
00:30:01,528 --> 00:30:03,328
Thea, please,
come with me.

476
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,864
I don't want
anything to do with you.

477
00:30:05,866 --> 00:30:08,533
I don't want
to even see you!

478
00:30:11,237 --> 00:30:13,371
Stay behind me.

479
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,592
You're out of arrows.

480
00:30:34,594 --> 00:30:37,062
You're not!

481
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:50,942
Oliver...

482
00:30:50,944 --> 00:30:52,877
This is your phone.

483
00:31:02,655 --> 00:31:04,456
What do you want?

484
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:05,790
Same thing you do, Oliver.

485
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:07,792
To save this city
before it's too late.

486
00:31:07,794 --> 00:31:08,960
It's already too late.

487
00:31:08,962 --> 00:31:11,563
You were right
about Slade Wilson.

488
00:31:11,565 --> 00:31:13,431
I should have
listened to you.

489
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:15,600
But I'm here now
and I can help you.

490
00:31:15,602 --> 00:31:17,335
Why should I trust you?

491
00:31:17,337 --> 00:31:19,270
Because, Oliver...

492
00:31:19,272 --> 00:31:22,107
I have
the Mirakuru cure.

493
00:31:33,568 --> 00:31:35,669
How much venom
do we have to keep him under?

494
00:31:35,671 --> 00:31:37,170
Two hours, maybe.

495
00:31:37,172 --> 00:31:39,673
Let's go.

496
00:31:39,675 --> 00:31:41,107
Hey.

497
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:43,176
I need you
to stay with Roy.

498
00:31:43,178 --> 00:31:45,512
Ok.

499
00:31:47,215 --> 00:31:50,250
Oliver, John--

500
00:31:50,252 --> 00:31:51,585
um, maybe
this is obvious,

501
00:31:51,587 --> 00:31:53,019
but are we sure
this isn't a trap?

502
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:58,625
No.

503
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:00,360
I'm just saying, if you guys don't
come back alive,

504
00:32:00,362 --> 00:32:02,262
I'm going to be
really pissed.

505
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:33,860
As a young boy, I was
plagued by nightmares.

506
00:32:33,862 --> 00:32:36,323
Every night, I would
wake up in a cold sweat,

507
00:32:36,348 --> 00:32:38,333
frightened and alone.

508
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,002
It was my father's face
that haunted me.

509
00:32:43,904 --> 00:32:46,172
And this is how
I saw him.

510
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:50,477
The embodiment
of desperation and despair.

511
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:53,680
I made this mask
to conquer my fears.

512
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:56,716
And remind myself
why I fight,

513
00:32:56,718 --> 00:32:58,785
every day,

514
00:32:58,787 --> 00:33:03,623
to give this city's
most desperate a chance.

515
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:07,994
All I ever wanted
to do was help people, Oliver.

516
00:33:07,996 --> 00:33:10,263
Then help me
believe.

517
00:33:10,265 --> 00:33:12,365
Where is the cure?

518
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:14,834
Slade Wilson will not rest

519
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:18,738
until he honors the promise
that he made you.

520
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:22,676
I won't be so easy to kill once
we level the playing field.

521
00:33:22,678 --> 00:33:24,311
He's not interested
in killing you.

522
00:33:24,313 --> 00:33:25,679
Not until he's taken away

523
00:33:25,681 --> 00:33:27,480
everything
and everyone you love.

524
00:33:27,482 --> 00:33:30,150
After he murdered
my mother,

525
00:33:30,152 --> 00:33:33,720
he said one more
person had to die.

526
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:36,856
Whoever you love the most.

527
00:33:45,966 --> 00:33:48,368
I hope you can
beat him with this.

528
00:33:49,837 --> 00:33:51,671
For all our sakes.

529
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:55,775
And when this is over,
I promise you...

530
00:33:55,777 --> 00:33:57,210
I will do everything

531
00:33:57,212 --> 00:33:59,145
in my power to rebuild
Starling City.

532
00:33:59,147 --> 00:34:00,914
And I won't just
make it what it was.

533
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,349
I will make it better.

534
00:34:02,351 --> 00:34:04,351
Like I always planned.

535
00:34:04,353 --> 00:34:05,919
You really think...

536
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:08,555
After everything
that's happened,

537
00:34:08,557 --> 00:34:11,991
after what you've done,

538
00:34:11,993 --> 00:34:15,595
that they'll still
let you be mayor?

539
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:18,331
Why not?

540
00:34:18,333 --> 00:34:19,566
No one knows that
I've done anything

541
00:34:19,568 --> 00:34:21,201
except try
to save this city.

542
00:34:21,203 --> 00:34:23,803
And if you tell anyone
about my mask,

543
00:34:23,805 --> 00:34:26,373
I will tell them about yours.

544
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:29,342
Do what you have to,
Sebastian.

545
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:39,619
I got to get back to it.

546
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:42,689
Hey.
Are you guys ok?

547
00:34:42,691 --> 00:34:44,724
Yeah.
Are you ok?

548
00:34:44,726 --> 00:34:46,726
You wouldn't believe it--
a blonde in a mask

549
00:34:46,728 --> 00:34:49,662
ran out of a burning
building with a kid in her arms.

550
00:34:49,664 --> 00:34:51,133
It was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

551
00:34:51,158 --> 00:34:52,791
That woman's a hero.

552
00:35:08,215 --> 00:35:10,450
You gave it to him,
didn't you?

553
00:35:11,585 --> 00:35:15,255
I did what I thought
was necessary.

554
00:35:16,757 --> 00:35:19,426
Don't worry,
I'll tell Slade.

555
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:24,964
Does he still have the cure?

556
00:35:24,966 --> 00:35:27,267
No.

557
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:29,302
Slade, you betrayed--

558
00:35:29,304 --> 00:35:31,004
Good-bye,
Mr. Blood.

559
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,877
I loved this city.

560
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,717
Why does every secret formula
have to be a color?

561
00:36:05,718 --> 00:36:07,751
Whatever happened to good,
old-fashioned clear?

562
00:36:07,753 --> 00:36:10,321
All right, so if we inject one
of Slade's soldiers with this...

563
00:36:10,323 --> 00:36:11,588
According
to S.T.A.R. Labs,

564
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,957
it will counteract
the effects.

565
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:14,892
Assuming they got
the recipe right.

566
00:36:23,268 --> 00:36:24,768
We need to test it.

567
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:25,936
We can't.

568
00:36:25,938 --> 00:36:27,504
Treat Roy like
some kind of lab rat?

569
00:36:27,506 --> 00:36:28,539
Felicity...

570
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:29,640
What if it doesn't work?

571
00:36:29,642 --> 00:36:30,774
What if it kills him?

572
00:36:30,776 --> 00:36:32,009
What if he wakes up
and kills us?

573
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:35,512
We need to know.
One way or the other.

574
00:36:46,925 --> 00:36:49,193
Go lock
the other door.

575
00:36:49,195 --> 00:36:50,961
Ok.

576
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,471
Sara, where does Ivo
keep his safe?

577
00:37:00,473 --> 00:37:02,373
It's, uh,
by his books.

578
00:37:10,348 --> 00:37:13,050
Oliver...

579
00:37:24,462 --> 00:37:26,409
What are you
looking for, kid?

580
00:37:27,783 --> 00:37:29,221
This?

581
00:37:34,734 --> 00:37:36,295
A whole area
of the country...

582
00:37:36,466 --> 00:37:39,034
Detective Lance.

583
00:37:39,036 --> 00:37:41,670
Yeah?

584
00:37:41,672 --> 00:37:44,072
What's going on?

585
00:37:46,008 --> 00:37:47,475
What is it?

586
00:37:47,477 --> 00:37:49,744
You're watching live footage
of an army convoy

587
00:37:49,746 --> 00:37:52,873
arriving on the outskirts
of the city to restore order.

588
00:37:52,874 --> 00:37:55,008
Looks like the cavalry's
here, finally.

589
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:58,044
Maybe.
What do you mean?

590
00:37:58,046 --> 00:38:01,347
Well, they're taking up positions in
the bridges and tunnels.

591
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:03,283
Well, those are
the only ways into the city.

592
00:38:03,285 --> 00:38:04,784
Yeah,
and the only ways out.

593
00:38:04,786 --> 00:38:07,854
A buddy of mine
in military intelligence

594
00:38:07,856 --> 00:38:09,689
once told me the army
isn't always the army.

595
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:11,357
But it's clearly
the military.

596
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,393
The trucks,
the uniforms.

597
00:38:13,395 --> 00:38:14,661
Except the nearest army base
is at Monument Point,

598
00:38:14,663 --> 00:38:16,195
which is 300 miles from here.

599
00:38:16,197 --> 00:38:18,932
So how could they mobilize
to Starling City so fast?

600
00:38:18,934 --> 00:38:21,601
Ok. So if that
isn't the army,

601
00:38:21,603 --> 00:38:23,970
who the hell are they?

602
00:38:44,154 --> 00:38:47,523
I'm sorry.

603
00:38:59,288 --> 00:39:03,357
I can't.

604
00:39:06,781 --> 00:39:09,215
It's Lance. Detective.

605
00:39:09,217 --> 00:39:11,184
Are you near him?
Yes.

606
00:39:11,186 --> 00:39:13,153
Are you near a TV?
Yes.

607
00:39:13,155 --> 00:39:15,221
Turn it on.

608
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:22,929
You're watching
live footage of an army convoy

609
00:39:22,931 --> 00:39:26,900
arriving on the outskirts
of the city to restore order.

610
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:34,441
How did you
get this number?

611
00:39:34,443 --> 00:39:36,209
Amanda.
What are you doing?

612
00:39:36,211 --> 00:39:37,978
I'm not sure what you mean.

613
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,114
Amanda, the troops taking up position
at the city's exits--

614
00:39:41,116 --> 00:39:42,882
they're not army,
they're A.R.G.U.S.

615
00:39:42,884 --> 00:39:45,518
Those are your men.
So you tell me what you're up to.

616
00:39:47,321 --> 00:39:48,688
Amanda!

617
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,390
Slade's followers
are a clear

618
00:39:50,392 --> 00:39:53,026
and present danger.
I cannot allow them

619
00:39:53,028 --> 00:39:55,261
to escape the city.
They need to be contained...

620
00:39:55,263 --> 00:39:57,764
By any means necessary.

621
00:39:58,833 --> 00:39:59,799
You can't.

622
00:39:59,801 --> 00:40:01,067
They're a drone
en route

623
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:04,037
carrying six
GBU/43-B bombs,

624
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:06,039
enough fire power
to level the city.

625
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:09,609
There are over half
a million people in this city.

626
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:11,745
576,000.

627
00:40:11,747 --> 00:40:13,880
None of whom
deserve to die.

628
00:40:13,882 --> 00:40:16,216
But I have to think
about the people in every city.

629
00:40:16,218 --> 00:40:20,613
You once told me that Mirakuru
made a man virtually unstoppable.

630
00:40:20,656 --> 00:40:22,789
What could happen
to this country,

631
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:24,791
this world,

632
00:40:24,793 --> 00:40:27,494
if I don't end this
here and now?

633
00:40:27,496 --> 00:40:29,262
Listen to me.

634
00:40:29,264 --> 00:40:31,498
I have the cure.

635
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,567
I can stop Slade
and his men.

636
00:40:34,569 --> 00:40:38,905
I can't take the chance
you'll fail, Oliver.

637
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:42,442
Amanda, I just
need more time.

638
00:40:42,444 --> 00:40:44,711
I'm sorry.

639
00:40:44,713 --> 00:40:46,946
You have until dawn.

640
00:40:46,948 --> 00:40:48,882
And then Starling City
is a crater.

641
00:41:12,707 --> 00:41:14,808
If you're going
to use that,

642
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:17,310
you'll want to click
the safety off.

643
00:41:19,814 --> 00:41:22,649
I'll shoot you.

644
00:41:22,651 --> 00:41:24,017
I will!

645
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:26,519
I can see it
in your eyes.

646
00:41:26,521 --> 00:41:28,788
My eyes.

647
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:32,158
They're just
like mine.

648
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,528
Both of them filled
with pain and anger,

649
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:38,798
because those we loved were
ripped from us.

650
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,168
I lost my name,
my wife...

651
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,604
Tommy.
