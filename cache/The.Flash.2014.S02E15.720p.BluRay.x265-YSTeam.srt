and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,223
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:13,183
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,442
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,777
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:22,280
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,492

fast enough to stop them.

that we used to seal the breaches,

Yes.

Look, we can'tjust let
Zoom get away with this.

46

He just murdered Jay right in front of us.

(SCOFFS) Yeah.

59
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,775
I'm afraid of what this double dose
of grief is gonna do to her.

60
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,480
I mean, she's pretty shell-shocked.

61

In the meantime,

65
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:18,282
I would not say anything to her
about her counterpart from my Earth.

66
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,450
That goes for Joe and Iris, too.

67
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:21,742
Why?

68
00:03:22,284 --> 00:03:24,002
Because you don't wanna
influence their reality

69
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,788
in ways it should not be influenced.

70

Like in the same way
as when Barry time-travels?

71
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,549
Exactly. But also, what's the point?

72
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,557
Those people are not your people.

73

We didn't talk about Earth-2.

82
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:11,004
We kept what happened there
between the three of us

83
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,510
and got on with our lives

84
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,467
knowing there was nothing
we could do now to stop Zoom.

85

Instead, we tried to just adjust
to our new circumstances

to rear its ugly head

94

and distract me
from the frustration I was feeling.

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,412
I'm fine.

165
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,959
Look, I get it.

166
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,586
You're having a hard time
with what happened.

167
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:59,588
- It's a lot to take so soon after...
- I said I'm fine.

168
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,298
Hey.

169
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,808
- Did you hear that?
- No. What?

170
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:12,309
Caitlin just bit my head off.

171
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:16,975
She's been all-business-no-emotion lately.
She's been cold.

172
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,567
Cold? Come on, Cisco.

173
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,859
This could be the beginning
of her becoming evil.

174
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,023
You're not worried about that?

175
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,820
I'm not worried about that.
Caitlin's not gonna become Killer Frost.

176
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:32,243
You haven't mentioned anything
about Earth-2, have you?

177
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:34,327
No. 'Cause I know how to keep a secret.

178
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,834
All right, well, look, I mean... (SIGHS)

179
00:09:35,991 --> 00:09:37,914
It's going to take some time
for her to heal.

180
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,540
We just got to be there for her.

181
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:40,913
Keep her busy.

182
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:42,874
- That shouldn't be a problem.
- Oh...

183
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,586
Hey, Dig, Lyla.
What are you guys doing here?

184
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:48,004
We came hereto give you
the heads-up, Barry.

185
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,504
About what?

186
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,595
A meta-human who escaped
from A.R.G.U.S. custody.

187
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,259
Goes by the name King Shark.

188
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,684
King Shark?

189
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,847
You mean, the half-man, half-shark
that tried to kill you months ago?

190
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,061
I thought he was dead.

191
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,773
That's what A.R.G.U.S. wanted you
to believe when they snatched him up.

192
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,187
But believe me,
this half-shark is very much alive.

193
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,028
And his biological imperative
is telling him to do one thing,

194
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,859
that's kill you, Barry.

195
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,110
(SCOFFS)

196
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,702
We're gonna need a bigger Flash.

197
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,322
(SIGHS)

198
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,798
So how do you know about King Shark?

199
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,708
As the new director ofA.R.G.U.S.,

200
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,378
Lyla's job is to clean up
Amanda Waller's messes.

201
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,547
King Shark was one of the
bigger and weirder ones.

202
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:32,056
And it appears under her directives,

203
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,219
A.R.G.U.S. had been monitoring meta-human
activity for the past two years.

204
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,932
- Why?
- Well, to see if any of those powers

205
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,812
could be exploited.

206
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:40,306
Weaponized.

207
00:10:41,765 --> 00:10:43,518
How do you know that he's coming after me?

208
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:46,524
While in our custody,
he kept saying the same thing.

209
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,652
"Zoom wants The Flash dead."

210
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,529
And although he removed
the tracker we had in him,

211
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,537
the readings we did receive show
that he was headed towards Central City.

212
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,697
Let him come.

213
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,831
Barry, this thing is a killing machine.

214
00:10:58,448 --> 00:11:00,417
We just came here to warn you, man.
Let A.R.G.U.S. handle it.

215
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,953
No, I can't do that, Dig.

216
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:03,453
I'm sorry, but all year,

217
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,500
we've been sitting ducks for Zoom
and all his Earth-2 henchmen.

218
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,009
This is the last one.

219
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,804
I'm not gonna just wait for him to attack.
I'm going after him first.

220
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,089
I owe that to Jay.

221
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,681
Wells, he's from your Earth.
What do you know about him?

222
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:20,096
Real name is Shay Lamden.
He was a, get this, marine biologist

223
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,765
before my particle accelerator
changed him into King Shark

224
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,933
and Zoom put him under his control.

225
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,274
So how did you track him
when he attacked Barry?

226
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,360
Zoom sent him to this Earth to kill Barry.

227
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:30,905
I just followed.

228
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,740
Yeah, but you did track Grodd down.
Can you find King Shark, too?

229
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,076
- I can try.
- All right.

230
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,836
(SIGHS) Okay, well, all these locations
are next to a body of water.

231
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:43,995
There must only be a few hours

232
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:47,381
before he needs to get back into the water
to re-oxygenate his blood.

233
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,634
I can take the waterfront.
Can you have your team handle the rest?

234
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,886
- I'll get them on it.
- All right.

235
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,758
What about Dr. Lamden's doppelganger?

236
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,392
Maybe he could help us somehow.

237
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,884
Or not.

238
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,895
Um, looks like he died when the
particle accelerator exploded.

239
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,351
What about next of kin?

240
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,687
Uh, he's got a widow, Dr. Tanya Lamden.

241
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,851
She's a research scientist
at Nautilus Labs,

242
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,023
and she studies, wait for it, sharks.

243
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,818
Okay, well, maybe the two of you can go

244
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:15,655
and see if she's discovered anything
in her research that could help us?

245
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:17,115
- Yeah.
- Sure.

246
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,370
Great.

247
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:21,990
- Hey, Dig.
- Yeah.

248
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,626
- How's that helmet treating you?
- It could use some improvements.

249
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,412
I'll get to work on it.

250
00:12:26,703 --> 00:12:27,830
Hey, Joe, what's up?

251
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:29,418
Hey, Barr, ltalked to Wally.

252
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:31,208
- He wants to meet up with you.
- All right.

253
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,720
He's working on his engineering project
at our place tonight.

254
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,427
He would love some help
from that big brain of yours.

255
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,225
Okay, Joe, look, I'm sorry.
Right now is kind of a crazy time.

256
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,556
Why? What's going on?

257
00:12:40,717 --> 00:12:44,597
Remember that meta-human shark
that Patty was after and attacked me?

258
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,687
- He's back? I thought Wells, you know.
- Yeah, me too.

259
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,977
But apparently, A.R.G.U.S. had him
and he escaped.

260
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,611
And now he's heading for Central City.

261
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,816
I get it. Uh, I'll tell Wally
some other time.

262
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,573
Hey, you know what? Um, it's all good.

263
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:01,489
I'll make it work.
Tell him tonight should be fine.

264
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,832
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

265
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,994
- Thanks, Barr.
- Yeah, bye.

266
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,413
(SIGHS)

267
00:13:10,163 --> 00:13:11,211
Why?

268
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,554
It's been two years
since your particle accelerator exploded.

269
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:21,183
Seems a little late to be asking questions
about my husband, doesn't it?

270
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,765
Your husband passed away
from cancer, correct?

271
00:13:24,886 --> 00:13:26,433
I suppose you could say that.

272
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,355
It only took three days for every cell
in his body to grow uncontrollably.

273
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:35,945
Whatever cancer he had,
it turned him into something not human.

274
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:37,859
Well, that's why we're here, actually.

275
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,572
There's a meta-human in Central City

276
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:43,411
whose body seems to be mutating
in the same way as your late husband.

277
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,584
But he didn't die,
he became a dangerous monster.

278
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,790
My husband was no monster.

279
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,746
That's not what she was implying.

280
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,586
What does this have to do with me?

281
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,967
We've read about the research
you're doing here on sharks.

282
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,254
Mmm-hmm. Yeah,
I've had some encouraging results.

283
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,966
Although, still preliminary.

284
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:00,590
We need to see it.

285
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,134
I beg your pardon?

286
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:03,975
Your research. All of it.

287
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,854
What my colleague means to say is that

288
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,515
if you could please let us
take a look at your findings,

289
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,902
it could help us stop this meta-human
from hurting anyone.

290
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:15,486
You're with S.T.A.R. Labs.

291
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,274
I'm just supposed to trust you?

292
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:22,283
Please, Mrs. Lamden.
This could help save lives.

293
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,744
I'll e-mail you what I have.

294
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,417
Thank you.

295
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:34,248
A little harsh.

296
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:35,586
I was being direct.

297
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,969
Yeah, well, that's one way to describe it.

298
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,681
You've been acting differently toward me
ever since you got back from Earth-2.

299
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,725
What's your problem, Cisco?

300
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,639
Nothing.

301
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,386
Let's just go.

302
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,316
AGENT 1: Grid one, negative.

303
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:03,945
AGENT 2: Grid four, negative.

304
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,836
Status check, grid two.

305
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,245
AGENT 3: Grid two, negative.

306
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,506
- Anything?
- No, man. Nothing yet.

307
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:17,508
So far, nothing on our end, either.

308
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,840
I just hope Wells is doing
better than we are.

309
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,924
Hey, how's Felicity doing?

310
00:15:23,004 --> 00:15:24,802
I'm not gonna lie, Barr.
It was pretty rough there at first,

311
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,684
but you know Felicity, she's tough.

312
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,897
Yeah. She's just not
returning any of my calls.

313
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,269
She has a lot going on right now.

314
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,360
But hey, I'll ask her if she can give you
a call when this is all over.

315
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,025
I just want to catch this thing, man.

316
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:42,442
If everything to do with Zoom and Earth-2
are put behind us,

317
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:45,076

Oliver does, Barry.

on your shoulders.

or it's going to slow you down.

after Waller's messes.

326

327
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,403
someone's going to be
cleaning up after mine.

328
00:16:21,062 --> 00:16:22,315
We'll find him, Lyla.

329
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,619
All right.
I searched the whole area, he's gone.

330
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,153
He couldn't have gotten far.

331
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,995
Still, he knows we're here now.
We lost the element of surprise.

332
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,748
Not if Wells can figure out a way
to track him.

333
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,418
- In the meantime, we'll keep looking.
- All right.

I gotta go see Joe's son.

Never.

for my project essay to get into
CCU's engineering program.

343
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,453
Turbines. Like jet engines?

344
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,506
Yeah. Yeah, it'd use
an engine like the ones

345
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,634
they have in some helicopters,
only it'd run on biodiesel.

346
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,253
- Cool.
- Lt's very cool.

347
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,132
Yeah, you're gonna wanna address
the fuel economy issue here.

348
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,971
I mean, it is ajet, so it's gonna
burn through a lot of fuel.

349
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,636
Yeah. That's why I wanna use biodiesel.

350
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,771
It'll run off of anything
that burns with oxygen.

351
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:41,566
Okay, we also got a sound issue.
Gonna wake the neighbors for sure.

Oh, yeah, 'cause you're the doctor
with a specialty in biochem.

I'm just saying maybe you could use
another set of eyes, considering...

Considering what?

Considering the way
you've been acting lately.

You are not yourself, Caitlin.

She's a coldhearted ice queen
named Killer Frost.

Great. Now Harry's gonna kill me
and throw my stuff across the room.

391
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:44,142
Cisco, I'm not a meta-human.

392
00:19:44,432 --> 00:19:47,936
Okay, I hear you, but you're acting
just like she did over there.

393
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:51,232
You're being shut off,
you're being detached,

394
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,990
you're being cold.

00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,948
Because I have to be right now.

396
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,199
I just watched Jay get killed
right in front of my eyes.

397
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:03,118
Just when I was starting to
feel normal again.

398
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,628
Just when I was beginning to love him.

399
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,167
So if I let myself feel,

400
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:14,050
if I let all of that pain and anger out,

401

it's never gonna stop.

402

And that's not going to help me, either.

403
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:20,477
So let's just get back to this research

404
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:22,683
and figure out how to find King Shark.

405
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:24,730
Okay.

I'm trying to relocate this King Shark.

409
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,036
He's here? On this Earth?

410
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,338
Yes. It turns out, ourfriend
Zoom brought him here

411
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:50,290
to kill The Flash.

412
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,542
Looks like he's stuck here
just like we are.

413
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,884
Yeah, it looks like he is,
and so I have to figure this out

414
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,013
before more people get hurt, Jesse, so...

- Probability distribution algorithm?
- Partial matching strategies, yes.

416
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,188
- Based on what?
- Semantic trajectories.

418
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,685
What about mobility behaviors?

419
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,237
Jesse.

420
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,111
Look, you wanted me out of that room,
but now that I am,

421
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:16,616
you don't want me here.

422
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,570
Just let me help. Please.

423
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,498
Grab a marker.

424
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,124
Yeah, okay.

425
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,169
WALLY: Hardest pan' was amping the torque
without increasing drag.

426
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,758
A heavier engine would only
slow things down.

427
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,638
But this streamlined version
should optimize

428
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,596
both the torque and the horsepower.

429
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,557
Yeah. I'm just worried
it won't be enough still.

430
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:45,979
Here, let's do this.

431
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:49,563
Use a one-to-one transfer gearbox
to drop the output shaft of the engine.

432
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:53,153
Reverse rotation and send more power
to the torque converter.

to just do it for me.

and you all just act like
it's no big deal.

weird things happen

You know, Joe and Iris told me
a lot about you.

or something,

you being a coward.

all this great stuff about me.

I shouldn't tell you guys this, but, um,

506
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,164
I met your doppelgangers.

507
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,338
You were the cop in the family.
A good one, too.

508

(LAUGHS)
I told you I would've made a good cop.

510
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,638
- What about me, then?
- You were a lounge singer.

511
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,101
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, you had this
amazing voice, actually.

512
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,188
Um, but you didn't like me at all.

513
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,098
You actually blamed me
for Iris becoming a cop.

514
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:45,362
Said that she only became one
to help her selfish husband's career.

515
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:49,817
Wait, we were married?

516
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,193
Mmm-hmm.

517
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,913
We went to go see Joe perform.

518
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,667
And that's when everything went wrong.

519
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:06,462
Um, some metas that
worked for Zoom showed up.

520
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,628
They were looking for me. They knew
that I wasn't supposed to be there.

521
00:27:10,336 --> 00:27:13,260
And they attacked, and

522
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,727
you got caught in the crossfire and

523
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,103
you died.

524
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:26,232
I knew that it wasn't you,
that none of that was this life,

525
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,854
but

526
00:27:30,773 --> 00:27:34,118
watching it happen in front of me,
living that?

527
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:38,832
It didn't feel any different
because it was all still real.

528
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:44,748
And Jay warned me not to get
emotionally sucked in when I went there.

529
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,587
And then that's exactly what happened.

530
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,637
And now Joe West on Earth-2 is dead,

531
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,551
because I showed up.

532
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,188
Barr, that's not your fault.

533
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,894
Yeah, it is my fault.

534
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:06,442
It's all my fault.

535
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,193
Zoom,

536
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,652
this King Shark,

537
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,616
Jay's death.

538
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,826
It's all because of me.

539
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:22,163
And then I Just left an entire world
at Zoom's mercy.

540
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:41,478
Just when you thought it was safe
to go back in the suburbs,

541
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,559
King Shark shows up at your house.

542
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:45,019
I mean, I don't even know how he found me.

543
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,058
It's not like I was The Flash
while I was at home.

544
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,148
- Must be a reason.
- Yeah.

545
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,237
Have you figured out a way
to track King Shark yet?

546
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:54,945
No. I don't have enough information
to create an accurate location algorithm.

547
00:28:55,107 --> 00:28:57,201
What about Dr. Lamden's research?
Anything that can help us?

548
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,452
I didn't think so at first,

549
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,614
but then I found something
that I think might help us.

550
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,457
Sharks are predators.

551
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:03,663
In order to track their prey,

552
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,044
they use what's known as
passive electro location.

553
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:08,330
- Passive electro location?
- Yes, it's how they sense

554
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:11,250
the bioelectric potential
around a fish's body.

555
00:29:11,415 --> 00:29:13,669
King Shark senses electricity
in Barry's system.

556
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:16,505
Okay. That explains how
King Shark can track Barry.

557
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,298
But how is that going to
help us track him?

558
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,432
We flip it.
Instead of King Shark being the predator,

559
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,892
we make him the prey, and we track him
using active electro location.

560
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:27,354
We reprogram our satellite to
generate a specific electric field

561
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,358
and then measure any
electrical distortions

562
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,862
that correlate with a one-ton,
walking shark.

563
00:29:32,144 --> 00:29:33,817
(CHUCKLES) That'll help us get him.

564
00:29:34,772 --> 00:29:37,195
- You'll help me out?
- Sure.

565
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:43,118
Great. Let us know when you locate him,
and we'll take it from there.

566
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:44,578
Okay.

567
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,084
Let's get the team ready.

571
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,934
That, my friend, is bait.

572
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,891
You made a Flash lure?

573
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,477
It's the best I could come up
with given the time frame.

574
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,814
It's rigged to mimic and enhance
the electric field Barry's body generates.

575
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,605
King Shark takes one whiff of that,
cue the Jaws soundtrack.

576
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,115
And I also stuffed it with enough tranqs
to knock him out for a month.

577
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,321
Which should make him
a lot easier to reel in.

578
00:30:19,483 --> 00:30:22,784
And that container, strong enough
to hold him once he's sedated?

579
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,911
It's made of promethium metal.
It's impenetrable.

580
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,201
Meanwhile, we'll be able to keep track
of King Shark with this

581
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:30,496
and the cameras that are on the lure.

582

(GRUNTS, PANTING)

635
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,050
Now we can reel him in.

(CHUCKLING)

637
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,190
Hell of a catch, Barry.

638
00:35:06,353 --> 00:35:07,480
(CHUCKLING) Yeah.

639
00:35:07,646 --> 00:35:10,525
Let's just make sure he doesn't become
the "one that got away."

640
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,114
Won't let that happen again.

641
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,277
So what are you gonna do with him?

642
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,742
I don't know yet.

643
00:35:14,903 --> 00:35:16,371
But one thing's for sure.

644
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:20,206
A.R.G.U.S.'s plans to turn King Shark
into a weapon died with Amanda Waller.

645
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:24,255
I think our time would be better served
learning how he came to be

646
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,880
and how to cure him.

647
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:28,217
You know,
you should really talk to Dr. Lamden.

648
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,630
She's done a lot of research,
and I think it could be helpful to you.

649
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:32,922
I'll do that.

650

- Nice to see you again.
- Mmm-hmm.

Well, thanks a lot, Dig.

653
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,396
Hey, I gotta thank you, Barry.

654
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,445
Got Lyla her first win.
I got to watch you run on water.

655
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,606

I lost a lot of friends.

658
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:58,956
Brothers.

659
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,250
So losing Jay, I know what it feels like.

660
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,041
Question yourself,

661
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,047
blame yourself for his death.

662
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:10,085
And that guilt, it can tear you apart.

663
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,259
Trust me, man,
you gotta get control of it,

664

or it'll rip you up inside.

665

Use this, man. Let it guide you,

666
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:22,438
so it never happens again.

667
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,815
- All right, thanks, man.
- You got it.

668

00:36:38,737 --> 00:36:40,456
Yeah, yeah. See? I told you.

672
00:36:40,614 --> 00:36:41,786
Hey, Oliver, what's up?

673
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,378
You're a really slow reader.

674

- I want one of these supercars.

676

I mean, especially if I can run it off
the bacon grease I collect.

00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:06,228
- (LAUGHS)
- Man, Wally, I'm so impressed.

678
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:10,737
Thanks. But Barry gave me
a lot of help, so...

679
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:14,398
Yeah, he did, but this was all your idea.
This is all your hard work.

680
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,818
It's all you.
Barry would say the same thing.

681
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,157
Would he?

682
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,659
Look, Wally.

683
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,250
Iris and I took Barry in

684
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,168
when he was 11.

685
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,842
And the reason he came to live with us
is because

686
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:34,885
his mother was murdered,

687
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:38,264
and his father was
wrongfully imprisoned for it.

688
00:37:40,048 --> 00:37:42,677
And I have been overprotective
of that kid since that day.

689
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,724
We gave him all the love

690
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,809
and support he needed
to get through that tragedy

691
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:53,195
and become the man he is now.

692
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,487
So that pride

693
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,989
you see when Iris and I
are talking about him

694
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:04,077
is because things could have gone
very differently.

695
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,253
But he's not perfect.

696
00:38:08,952 --> 00:38:12,628
And he's not favored
over you, or Iris, or anybody else.

697
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,967
So you have nothing to worry about.

698
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,050
He's my son.

699
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,175
Just like you are.

700
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,938
What are you doing with those?

701
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,893
I'm adjusting the wavelength trigger to
see if I can get these to work over here.

702
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:33,936
So you can catch some breachers?

Oh, no!

00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,666
No, no, no. It's starting.
You're starting to become...

That ain't right. That's just rude.
Who put you up to this?

711
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,594
Barry put you up to this, didn't he?
Oh, I should've known.

- Cold?

Yeah.

714
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:06,302
You deserve it for thinking that
I could ever become like her.

715
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,518
Cisco, you need to stop worrying about me.

I may be sad, I may want to be alone
for a little while,

00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,106
but I promise you

718
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:17,773
Killer Frost will never exist
on this Earth, okay?

719
00:39:18,063 --> 00:39:21,409
Besides, you tested me.
I don't even have the meta-human gene.

720
00:39:22,025 --> 00:39:23,619
So please stop worrying about me, okay?

00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,289
Okay. (SOFT CHUCKLE)

Come on, Barry wants us upstairs.

For real though,
you gotta work on that circulation.

(SIGHS) Uh...

I need to apologize to you all.

Um...

731
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:58,646
Last year, I made a choice
to go back in time

732
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,315
and save my mother.

733
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,193
And that choice had

734
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:08,114
a lot of consequences that will haunt me
for the rest of my life,

735

it haunts all of you, too.

Jay's death.

738
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,387
It's all because of me.

739
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,474
But I own those choices.

740
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,976
We're the ones
who opened the door to Earth-2.

But we are also the ones
who are gonna stop him.

743
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,235
How?

744
00:40:39,686 --> 00:40:41,405
How are we going to stop Zoom, Allen?

745
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,317
I don't know yet.

746

But those breaches aren't closed forever,
and we're not done with Earth-2.

And the next time,

751
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,518
I will beat him.
