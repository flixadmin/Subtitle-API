1
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,950
There's a group of men called "the firm".

2
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:10,205
They've been running things
for a long, long time.

3
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:17,328
And when they need someone to clean up
their mess, they send me.

4
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,572
- Sam.
- Nathan.

5
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:22,114
- Where are you?
- At home. Sewing.

6
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,615
Meet me at the diner.

7
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:28,282
Why?

8
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,957
How much trouble am lin?

9
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,790
An extra scoop for my favourite client.

10
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:41,990
Thanks, Rose.

11
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,415
15 years earlier

12
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,116
I put in an extra scoop
for my favourite client.

13
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,826
- Thanks, Rose.
- I'm sure she won't be long.

14
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:02,700
You clearly don't know
my mother very well.

15
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:18,658
Hey, stranger. Can I lighten your load?

16
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,115
I'm not carrying today, Rose.

17
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,914
Guess there's a first time for everything.

18
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,447
- She's over there.
- Thanks for keeping an eye on her.

19
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,824
You said you'd be here in 30 minutes.

20
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:53,373
I'm a few minutes late.

21
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:55,577
Three hours.

22
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,618
You're bleeding.

23
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,040
Just another day at the office.
Did you bring it?

24
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:20,081
- Anna may sure can pick them.
- It's loaded.

25
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:21,407
Good girl.

26
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:29,125
Listen, I have to disappear for a while.

27
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,072
- Then I'm coming with you.
- You can't. Not this time.

28
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:37,114
Nathan will be here soon.
He'll take care of you while I'm gone.

29
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:40,041
- I don't want to go with Nathan.
- I'm doing this for your own good.

30
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:42,867
I'll stay in the library with Anna may
and the others.

31
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,789
It's too dangerous.

32
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,831
What's going on?

33
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:57,242
- It's complicated.
- Tell me. I'm not a kid any more.

34
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,831
No, you're not.

35
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,290
You haven't touched your milkshake.

36
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,290
I didn't wanna drink it without you.

37
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:56,033
How long will you be gone?

38
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,665
I have to make a quick phone call.

39
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,081
Stay here.

40
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:20,748
Evening, gentlemen.
Can I lighten your load?

41
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,619
- Get lost.
- Hey.

42
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,164
Hello, little girl.

43
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:59,750
Mommy says I'm not allowed to talk
to strangers.

44
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:04,656
This mommy. Looks a lot like you?

45
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:12,576
Only bigger and more stabby?
Got my father's blood all over her?

46
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,914
I don't like you.

47
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:31,160
Enough games. Where is she?

48
00:07:32,667 --> 00:07:34,623
Go kiss a pig.

49
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:43,161
Tell me where she is.

50
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:50,998
Close your eyes, baby girl.

51
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:12,875
Mom!

52
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:07,998
Evening, darling. Can I lighten your load?

53
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,950
- I'm clean.
- Regular clean or diner clean?

54
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,825
- Forgot about this one.
- Course you did, sugar.

55
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:34,790
Boy. These girls are worse than the stasi.

56
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,163
You hurt?

57
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:43,035
- Just another day at the office.
- Wow. You sound just like your mother.

58
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:48,698
- I don't have a mother.
- Well, you sure have her temper.

59
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:53,200
- What the hell happened tonight?
- Bad intel.

60
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,250
You said four or five idiots
with peashooters.

61
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:57,664
Yes. And?

62
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,286
For Christ's sake, child.

63
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:10,659
This was supposed to be a low-profile gig,
not a bloody massacre.

64
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:15,289
- Next time I'll just let them shoot me.
- Next time just do what you're told.

65
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,325
Remember who you're working for.
As long as they're happy...

66
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:23,909
And you called me here, oh, so urgently,
just to remind me of that.

67
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,331
No.

68
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:30,578
Your talents are needed pronto.

69
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,120
Somebody stole from us.

70
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:38,370
Who's crazy enough to steal from the firm?

71
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,700
Somebody who doesn't know
who we really are. An accountant.

72
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:43,999
From the clean side of the business.

73
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:47,951
- How much did he take?
- Enough to earn a visit from you.

74
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:49,327
We need that money back.

75
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:54,242
Good girl. I'll text the address later.

76
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:58,409
And get rid of those stone age
firearms you carry.

77
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,956
But I've had them for years.

78
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:03,409
Find an open vendor and get yourself
some clean boomsticks.

79
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:07,785
We can't have you linked to that war zone
you left behind, now, can we?

80
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,413
Did you know about this little endeavour
my son had on the side?

81
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:30,117
Sorry, uncle. I had no idea.

82
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:56,623
Where's the shoe?

83
00:11:57,792 --> 00:11:58,907
What shoe?

84
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,697
The shoe that is not currently covering
my son's left foot.

85
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:06,330
The one that looks exactly like its twin,
the right one. That fucking shoe.

86
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:09,033
- I don't know.
- Well, find it.

87
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,491
Found it, mr mcalester.

88
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,287
Nobody tells his mother about this.

89
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,870
We'll tell her he ran off with some girl.

90
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:48,244
I get it.

91
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,575
Now bring me the heads of the men
who killed my boy.

92
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,870
Hello, dear. What can I do for you?

93
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:41,116
I need to exchange some books.

94
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:46,536
Well, that's nice. Not a lot of people
your age read nowadays.

95
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:51,405
- Do you have a card with us?
- No, but I'd like to open one.

96
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,119
Wonderful. What kind of books
are you interested in?

97
00:13:57,042 --> 00:14:00,205
Mostly smaller ones. A few heavies.

98
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,411
Well, you won't find them there.

99
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,491
Those are our children sections.

100
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:09,202
The enchanted forest.
And the never ending ocean.

101
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:12,452
They sound like fun.

102
00:14:15,417 --> 00:14:21,083
Have we met before? You seem so familiar.

103
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:26,030
I'm embarrassed to say it's been
a while since I visited a library.

104
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:29,784
Well, that's no way to live, dear.

105
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,745
Let's get you into a good book.

106
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,698
Come.

107
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:11,491
Anna may, this lovely young lady wants
to open an account with us.

108
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,164
Well.

109
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,081
Madeleine should have told you

110
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:21,489
that we don't accept
new readers without a reference.

111
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:25,030
- Madeleine had a hunch.
- Fudge your hunches.

112
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:28,037
- If you pardon my French.
- Technically not French.

113
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,083
- Always literal.
- Of course I'm literary. I'm a librarian.

114
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:36,207
Yeah, be that as it may.
Florence, dear, would you join us?

115
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:41,624
I'm afraid we need a tie breaker.

116
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:44,905
Madeleine thinks this girl needs
to do some reading.

117
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,322
I told you I had a hunch.
There's something very familiar about her.

118
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:53,457
Hunch shmunch. I, on the other hand,
think we should dispose of the body

119
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:57,114
and then have a long talk about
our onboarding protocols.

120
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,494
You know I can hear you, right?

121
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:04,706
Hush, girl. Don't be rude.

122
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:07,158
Turn around, hon.

123
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,290
And take off your hat.

124
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:30,364
- What did she say her name was?
- She didn't.

125
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,039
That's odd.

126
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:37,370
Well, girl. Cat got your tongue? Speak up.

127
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,744
It's Sam.

128
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:45,496
- Scarlet's kid?
- Yeah.

129
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,120
I knew it. Never forget those eyes.

130
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:53,077
We haven't seen you since
you were yea high. How is your mother?

131
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:55,158
I haven't seen her in 15 years.

132
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:01,868
Well, that's something
we both have in common.

133
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:07,908
My, my, my. Little Sam.
We hear about you all the time.

134
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,707
You've made quite a reputation
for yourself.

135
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:14,284
Come here. Give auntie Madeleine a hug.

136
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,448
Why come back now?

137
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:26,324
I needed clean guns, and...
I guess I needed an excuse.

138
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,283
Nice collection.

139
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:36,822
And you take good care of them.
Let me guess.

140
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:41,206
You're the sentimental type. Romantic.

141
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:45,285
Sentimental types
don't last long doing this. So, no,

142
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,787
I don't think I'm the sentimental type.

143
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:51,697
Tommy tomahawk.
I looked everywhere for him.

144
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:53,999
Yeah. Sorry about that.

145
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,997
So, you're an idealist.

146
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:01,665
Nope. Maybe I don't have a type.

147
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,197
- Everybody has a type.
- Everybody.

148
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,489
Maybe I'm the professional type?

149
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:12,656
Old school. No women, no children type.

150
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:19,245
- Women are fair game.
- Gender equality. Very progressive.

151
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:24,748
- She's a feminist.
- Fine. You get to live.

152
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:30,157
We'll make these disappear and get you
into some new, clean books.

153
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,911
You'll need a Jane Austen.

154
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:36,577
A Charlotte bronte.

155
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,074
And a Virginia woolf.

156
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,116
And an Agatha christie.

157
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:51,873
For reading.

158
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,373
Please.

159
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,707
I need to answer this.

160
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:20,832
You need to walk away and thank god
I'm not in a killing mood.

161
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,490
I got no choice.

162
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,074
- No!
- Enough!

163
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:06,248
Playing hard to get?
Not very smart, moron.

164
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:10,872
Not unless you want me to send
your little Princess back in pieces.

165
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:15,452
You have exactly 60 minutes to bring the
money to the gutterball bowling alley.

166
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:20,161
A minute late and she'll be celebrating
her ninth birthday with the worms.

167
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,366
Sixty minutes.

168
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:29,080
Please. It's my daughter.

169
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,243
Fuck me.

170
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:40,782
I'll get the doctor.
Guns go in the cookie jar.

171
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,447
Hey. Haven't seen you in a while.

172
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:54,784
And you've brought a new friend.
What the hell happened?

173
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:59,039
I happened. Just fix him.
I need him on his feet in ten minutes.

174
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,663
He's not going anywhere.
Not in ten minutes.

175
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:12,530
- Maybe not ever.
- So what can we do?

176
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,369
We? Well, you could start
by not shooting people.

177
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:19,622
Please. My Emily. There's no time.

178
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,869
That's it, just relax. Take it in deep.

179
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,950
- Is that laughing gas?
- Well, duh.

180
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:31,162
Just patch him up. I'll be back soon.
He'd better be functional.

181
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:38,783
She's really quite annoying, isn't she?

182
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:45,911
Who am I talking to?
The guy that she shot in the stomach?

183
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:54,324
- Is it done?
- There's a change of plan.

184
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:57,324
What are you talking about?
What does that mean?

185
00:23:57,417 --> 00:24:00,329
They kidnapped his little girl.
That's why he stole the money.

186
00:24:00,417 --> 00:24:03,534
If I don't get to the gutterball
in 15 minutes, they'll kill her.

187
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:07,072
Sam, you're not thinking straight.
Just bring the money back. Now!

188
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:11,035
I just need half an hour. I'll release
the girl and bring you back your money.

189
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,575
Okay, listen to me, Sam.

190
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:17,864
If you screw this one up,
they will give the kill order.

191
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:21,246
And I won't be able to stop them.

192
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:26,953
She's just a little girl.
I can't leave her to die. I'm sorry.

193
00:24:27,042 --> 00:24:30,205
- Don't you dare hang up on me, young lady.
- I'm sorry.

194
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:31,998
Fuck!

195
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:50,497
Go to the gutterball.
Try to reason with her.

196
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:52,198
Bring back the money.

197
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:54,448
Wait.

198
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:02,156
Now, when I say reason with her,
I mean no guns, no knives.

199
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,083
She comes back alive. Understood?

200
00:25:05,167 --> 00:25:06,748
Yeah.

201
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:12,076
And for god's sake, be careful.

202
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:14,407
And remember who you're dealing with.

203
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:20,366
What the hell are you waiting for? Go.

204
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:39,364
One of the men Sam killed was
Jim mcalester's son.

205
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:45,660
Are you sure it was mcalester's kid?
Yes.

206
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:49,908
The board is on its way.

207
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,162
God damn it, Sam.

208
00:26:35,958 --> 00:26:39,155
Who the fuck are you?

209
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:44,074
Just someone who has your money.
I want the girl.

210
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,249
Where's daddy?

211
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:49,325
He had an accident.

212
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,244
He sent me.

213
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,789
You want your money or not?

214
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:21,289
The girl got to this point alive,
but if you as much as sneeze

215
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:25,493
without my permission,
that could be easily rectified.

216
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:28,074
- Got it.
- Good.

217
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:31,284
Now, see the locker behind you?

218
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:37,165
Weapon and phone go in the locker.

219
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,115
Along with the clothes you're wearing now.

220
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:41,449
Slam the door shut and it will lock.

221
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:44,454
Go to the westfield mall
across the street.

222
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:48,785
You, the suitcase, the new clothes
and the little girl's phone.

223
00:27:50,917 --> 00:27:52,657
Seriously?

224
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,957
Ten minutes.

225
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,365
Hello, Sam.

226
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:21,285
- Bonehead.
- Hey, Sam.

227
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:25,448
Boneheads.

228
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:29,999
I really don't have time for this.

229
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:35,032
Nathan's worried about you.
Doesn't want you to do anything stupid.

230
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:39,539
So why don't you hand over the suitcase
and nobody gets hurt.

231
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:40,740
Counter offer.

232
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:44,451
Go back to Nathan.
Tell him you tried but I roughed you up.

233
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:49,162
You can beat each other up
for added realism.

234
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:54,038
- That's funny.
- What, no guns today?

235
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:58,915
Nathan doesn't want you hurt.
Not too badly, anyway.

236
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:01,664
That is so sweet.

237
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:04,874
I'll try not to kill you too.

238
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:59,578
Who the fuck is she?

239
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,616
Ground floor. Video beast.

240
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:47,326
- Cutting it close.
- I had a few hiccups.

241
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:50,659
We saw what you did with those hiccups.
How do we know you're not a cop?

242
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,617
Can a cop do what I just did?

243
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:58,997
- I just want the girl.
- Then we'll get along just fine.

244
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:04,077
There's a shopping cart behind you.
Put the suitcase inside.

245
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,787
Push the shopping cart towards us,

246
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:16,457
and we'll push the girl cart towards you.

247
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,285
One.

248
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,039
Two.

249
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,494
Three.

250
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:39,909
It's okay. You're safe.
I'll be right back.

251
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:49,996
We're all stinking rich,
you magnificent bastards.

252
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:52,074
Stop the fucking car.

253
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,749
Fuck!

254
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:18,824
You greedy traitor!

255
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:40,500
No!

256
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:53,869
Fuck.

257
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:36,496
- Anything broken? Are you bleeding?
- No.

258
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:41,953
- Bleeding on the inside?
- How can you tell? It's inside.

259
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:47,031
You're probably fine. Let's go.
Try to keep up.

260
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:02,655
I see you morons have found my stash.

261
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:07,244
This some good shit, doc.
You should be very proud of yourself.

262
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,369
This is not a toy.

263
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:14,120
It's for medicinal use only.

264
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:25,865
So, who fucked you up like this?

265
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:31,823
A girl.

266
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:36,370
So a girl made the three of you look like
you're from the walking dead?

267
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:39,291
I've never felt pain
like this before, doc.

268
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:41,741
She got us good, doc.

269
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,579
I don't think I'll ever walk again.

270
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:48,617
Well, there must be an epidemic,
because I got a guy in the next room

271
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:50,539
who's got similar symptoms.

272
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:54,291
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

273
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:57,333
A girl fucked him up too.

274
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,036
Keep talking, doc.

275
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:09,655
- You're bleeding.
- It's just a scratch.

276
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,289
It can get infected.
Worms will get in there and lay eggs.

277
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:16,411
Then they'll have to cut your arm off.

278
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:20,786
That's what they teach you
in school these days?

279
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:22,911
Discovery channel.

280
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,412
Well, thank god
we're going straight to the hospital.

281
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,823
- Is my daddy there?
- Yeah.

282
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:34,951
Is that why he didn't come? Is he sick?

283
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:36,747
He...

284
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:41,947
It's okay. You don't have to lie for him.

285
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:45,079
He never comes when he says he will.

286
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:54,700
Here. Just let me help you.

287
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:00,623
Thank you.

288
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:03,782
Sure.

289
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:09,871
- Are you sure it's her?
- Yeah. She dropped off some guy she shot.

290
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:12,620
Said she's gonna come back
and pick him up later.

291
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:17,623
- And the money?
- Well, she had it last time we saw her.

292
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:19,619
Then get it back.

293
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:23,155
She still getting the vip treatment?

294
00:38:31,667 --> 00:38:34,704
- Do whatever it takes.
- Alright, alright, alright.

295
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:37,499
Now that's what I call a work benefit.

296
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:53,949
Just stay behind me, okay?

297
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:16,532
Come on.

298
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:11,828
I'll get the doctor.

299
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,865
She's here.

300
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:29,164
Shot in the shoulder.

301
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:36,915
Maybe you should take your break now.

302
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:46,374
So, my payment?

303
00:40:49,542 --> 00:40:51,783
Transferred to your account.

304
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:56,114
Now, what's the plan, doc?

305
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:04,665
Once I stick her with this,
she'll start losing control of her arms.

306
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:09,323
After 60 seconds or so,
she's a sitting duck.

307
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,332
What's wrong with you?
Let me do this right.

308
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:33,282
It's just a scratch.

309
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:36,538
Well, scratches get infected.
That's how you lose an arm.

310
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:40,290
Yeah, I heard.

311
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:48,364
What happened to him?
Someone shot him.

312
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,574
I hear that's pretty lethal.

313
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:56,118
- Let's fix this.
- Don't. I'm good.

314
00:41:56,208 --> 00:42:01,783
- Trust me, you'll need this.
- I said I'm good.

315
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:07,204
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

316
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:12,165
You motherfu...

317
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:15,616
Sixty seconds!

318
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:18,074
Sixty seconds!

319
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:27,249
Sixty seconds.

320
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:31,117
Come on.

321
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:39,498
Listen, I need your help.
Some bad men are coming to hurt us.

322
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:41,244
The ones who killed my dad?

323
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:44,621
I promise I'll explain later,
but right now I need your help, okay?

324
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:48,121
- Okay.
- Good. Grab the biggest knife.

325
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:50,039
Careful of the sharp end.

326
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:56,248
Okay. Now grab the tape.

327
00:42:59,167 --> 00:43:02,409
Excellent. Tape it to my hand.

328
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:07,157
Thirty-six.

329
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:11,790
Thirty-two.

330
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:21,957
Now tape the gun to my other hand.

331
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:25,081
Careful. It's loaded.

332
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:27,783
Fifteen, fourteen...

333
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:33,658
Round two, bitch!

334
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:39,156
- Boneheads?
- Better get ready!

335
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:41,786
Thank god it's just you three.

336
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:44,992
You know, for a second there I thought it
was someone dangerous.

337
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:50,281
The only reason you're still alive
is because Nathan wanted it that way.

338
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:53,117
Now, just take my finger
and put it on the trigger.

339
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:58,783
Well, it's over now.
I'm gonna tear you into little pieces.

340
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:02,322
- And I'm gonna love every second of it.
- Yeah, that's great.

341
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:05,580
Can you hold that thought?
I'll be right out.

342
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:18,199
You're being very brave, Emily.

343
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:22,706
I need you to do one last thing for me,
and then go and hide. Okay?

344
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,160
Okay.

345
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:51,365
Hey, bonehead.

346
00:47:27,708 --> 00:47:28,708
Emily.

347
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:33,953
I need you to come grab the phone.

348
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:49,698
Come on.

349
00:47:53,792 --> 00:47:55,953
It's okay. Just pick it up.

350
00:48:02,792 --> 00:48:07,991
You are a goddamn rock star.
Put it on speaker.

351
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:11,748
Someone better start talking.

352
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:18,159
That was a... jerk move,
sending the three stooges after me.

353
00:48:19,042 --> 00:48:22,739
- You left us no choice, Sam.
- There's always a choice.

354
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:27,076
Well, then, we can still figure this out.
Just bring the money back.

355
00:48:27,167 --> 00:48:30,830
It's gone. The suitcase was blown
into a thousand pieces.

356
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:41,199
That's really unfortunate.

357
00:48:41,292 --> 00:48:43,658
So now what?

358
00:48:46,208 --> 00:48:48,449
You're no longer under our protection.

359
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:54,744
In your little massacre earlier tonight,
you killed the wrong people.

360
00:48:54,833 --> 00:48:57,245
Including Jim mcalester's son.

361
00:48:58,708 --> 00:49:02,030
But I was sent by you, by the firm.

362
00:49:02,125 --> 00:49:04,081
It doesn't matter.

363
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:09,161
This is business, Sam,

364
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:12,992
and you landed on the wrong side
of the balance sheet.

365
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:14,869
So...

366
00:49:15,875 --> 00:49:17,991
It needs to be rectified.

367
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,412
How's this for business?

368
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:29,165
If I get out of this alive,
I'm coming for you.

369
00:49:30,417 --> 00:49:31,782
All of you.

370
00:49:33,417 --> 00:49:36,375
I would expect no less.

371
00:49:37,333 --> 00:49:39,619
Goodbye, Sam.

372
00:50:04,583 --> 00:50:07,780
- Yes?
- Mr mcalester, this is Nathan.

373
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:10,537
I'm the head of the hr department
here at the firm.

374
00:50:10,625 --> 00:50:11,705
What do you want?

375
00:50:11,792 --> 00:50:15,159
To prevent an all-out war between
our two fine organisations,

376
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:19,118
we would like to offer you the woman
responsible for your loss.

377
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:21,494
So you had nothing to do with this?

378
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:25,246
I can assure you this is not how the firm
conducts its business, sir.

379
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:29,576
It was an unsolicited action
by a very troubled individual.

380
00:50:29,667 --> 00:50:35,742
I'm sending you her last location.
I hope this is satisfactory, sir.

381
00:50:36,417 --> 00:50:37,907
For now.

382
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:43,871
Take everybody.
Don't come back until it's done.

383
00:51:10,458 --> 00:51:13,450
- It's a text message from Nathan.
- What's it say?

384
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:17,996
"I'm sorry, child.
I can no longer protect you.

385
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:22,405
I left you a package to help you
survive the next few days.

386
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,207
Take it and disappear.”

387
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:27,619
Then there's an address.

388
00:51:28,958 --> 00:51:30,539
That's close by.

389
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,240
What if it's a trap?

390
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:51,825
Can you press the button?
We're parked on minus two.

391
00:52:18,458 --> 00:52:22,872
Just remember, you were spared thanks
to an eight-year-old girl.

392
00:52:22,958 --> 00:52:25,415
Eight and three quarters.

393
00:52:27,292 --> 00:52:30,864
Sorry. Eight and three quarters.

394
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:43,664
Are you a serial killer?

395
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:46,323
What?

396
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:48,410
No.

397
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:51,958
- Where did you learn that expression?
- History channel.

398
00:52:52,042 --> 00:52:55,864
Well, I am not a serial killer.

399
00:52:55,958 --> 00:52:59,701
But you kill people. Yes.

400
00:52:59,792 --> 00:53:03,740
- So that makes you a killer.
- And you've killed more than one.

401
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:05,573
That is serial.

402
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:10,079
It's more complicated than that.

403
00:53:10,917 --> 00:53:14,284
Serial killers are, you know,
mentally unstable.

404
00:53:14,375 --> 00:53:17,037
They kill people out of a compulsive urge.

405
00:53:19,458 --> 00:53:21,289
So, then, why do you kill them?

406
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,323
For money?

407
00:53:26,542 --> 00:53:30,330
Again, it's complicated.

408
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:36,450
Look, I'm gonna need your help
for a little longer.

409
00:53:36,542 --> 00:53:38,062
Because your arms are still paralysed?

410
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:40,366
Yes. After that, I'll get you
to your mother.

411
00:53:40,458 --> 00:53:43,291
- She left a long time ago.
- To your grandparents, then.

412
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:46,492
- They're dead.
- Uncles? Anything?

413
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:58,833
We'll figure it out, okay?

414
00:53:59,792 --> 00:54:04,456
- Okay.
- So, here's an unrelated question.

415
00:54:05,417 --> 00:54:06,953
Do you know how to drive?

416
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:12,448
Let's go over it one more time.
Left. Right.

417
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:16,205
I've got it already. D is for drive.
R is for reverse.

418
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:19,955
And you get to do the easy part,
stepping on the gas and brakes.

419
00:54:20,042 --> 00:54:22,704
Don't be a smartass. Turn the key.

420
00:54:24,667 --> 00:54:26,578
Put it in drive.

421
00:54:27,417 --> 00:54:28,623
Let's go.

422
00:54:48,292 --> 00:54:50,328
That's it. Straighten up.

423
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:54,955
- I'm driving.
- Yes, you are.

424
00:55:02,917 --> 00:55:05,954
Emily. Don't worry about the bullets.

425
00:55:06,667 --> 00:55:08,328
Reverse. Now!

426
00:55:11,042 --> 00:55:12,953
Hard left!

427
00:55:14,917 --> 00:55:16,532
- Put it in drive.
- Yeah.

428
00:55:19,042 --> 00:55:20,782
That's it.

429
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:23,699
Hard left. Go!

430
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:32,708
Get ready. Hard left.

431
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:35,124
And another hard left.

432
00:55:49,208 --> 00:55:52,245
Okay. Put it in reverse.

433
00:55:56,458 --> 00:55:57,868
Hard right.

434
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:02,540
Put it in drive.

435
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:08,535
Hard left.

436
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:11,206
Put it in reverse.

437
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,331
Quick, kill the lights.

438
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:43,868
Okay, be quiet. Duck down.
That's it. Get down.

439
00:56:55,042 --> 00:56:58,239
Okay, put it in drive.

440
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,824
Then close your eyes.

441
00:57:14,667 --> 00:57:16,532
Keep her straight.

442
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,740
Keep it straight.

443
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:31,869
Are your eyes still closed? Yes.

444
00:57:31,958 --> 00:57:35,530
Good girl. Put it in reverse.

445
00:58:02,333 --> 00:58:06,497
- Can I turn on the radio?
- Go nuts.

446
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:06,874
Emily. Doorbell.

447
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:31,037
Didn't I teach you to always
guard your back?

448
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:42,789
Hi, mom.

449
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:45,164
Hi.

450
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:56,914
Is this...

451
00:59:58,917 --> 01:00:02,535
- Am I a grandmother?
- God, no.

452
01:00:05,833 --> 01:00:09,997
Hi. I'm Emily. I'm her apprentice.

453
01:00:10,083 --> 01:00:13,871
- What?
- Emily. Come.

454
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:41,870
- That is a hell of a story.
- Hell of a night.

455
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:46,825
Try wiggling your fingers.

456
01:00:46,917 --> 01:00:50,080
- The feeling should come back in no time.
- Yeah. Already started working.

457
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:51,282
Excellent.

458
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,786
You look really good. Are you eating well?

459
01:00:57,875 --> 01:00:59,115
Cut the crap, mom.

460
01:01:00,542 --> 01:01:02,954
Where have you been for the last 15 years?

461
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:05,206
Around.

462
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,990
Watching you.

463
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:13,907
Making sure you're safe.

464
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,036
Great parenting.

465
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:18,707
Glad to see you taking an interest
in my career.

466
01:01:18,792 --> 01:01:22,034
- I never wanted this life for you.
- And how's that working out for you?

467
01:01:26,792 --> 01:01:30,159
I wanted to stay with you and your aunts,
but I couldn't.

468
01:01:30,792 --> 01:01:32,157
Why not?

469
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:36,411
Because I fucked up.

470
01:01:42,292 --> 01:01:44,123
I fucked up.

471
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:47,494
I was young when I had you.

472
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,912
I left London and followed your father
here, and when he died...

473
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,786
When he was murdered.

474
01:01:55,833 --> 01:01:59,530
When he was murdered. You were a baby.
I had nothing.

475
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:01,661
No money. Nowhere to go.

476
01:02:02,458 --> 01:02:04,665
I knew Anna may from your dad's work.

477
01:02:06,042 --> 01:02:07,998
She and the other aunts took us in.

478
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:13,114
- The best years of my life.
- Me too.

479
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:20,117
Fast forward 12 years and I find out
who shot your dad.

480
01:02:21,458 --> 01:02:26,122
The Russians? The Russians from the diner?

481
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:29,621
Once I knew, I couldn't let him
walk around enjoying life,

482
01:02:31,292 --> 01:02:33,032
knowing what he did to us.

483
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:40,040
But he was in bed with the firm.
So there was a price to pay.

484
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:42,912
Once I killed him,
there was a Mark on my back.

485
01:02:49,542 --> 01:02:51,328
I couldn't take you with me.

486
01:02:54,208 --> 01:02:55,618
I couldn't risk your life.

487
01:02:59,292 --> 01:03:01,999
So I made Nathan promise to keep you safe.

488
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:07,456
I guess that's over.

489
01:03:10,708 --> 01:03:14,075
There isn't a day that goes
by I don't regret pulling that trigger.

490
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:16,749
But back then I couldn't help myself.

491
01:03:21,083 --> 01:03:22,948
I'm sorry.

492
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:38,655
- Does the kid know about you and her dad?
- No.

493
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:42,657
But she's smart.

494
01:03:43,667 --> 01:03:47,364
- She'll figure it out.
- What happens when she does?

495
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:06,787
I think there's a bad man outside.

496
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:13,956
We have to get out of here.

497
01:04:18,583 --> 01:04:21,325
- So, what's the plan?
- Can you press the lobby button?

498
01:04:21,417 --> 01:04:23,999
- What plan?
- Come on. You always have a plan.

499
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:26,699
What is it? A secret escape route?
A warehouse filled with guns?

500
01:04:26,792 --> 01:04:29,158
- I called us an uber.
- Are you kidding me?

501
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:30,410
- Nope.
- An uber?

502
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,643
What the hell are you talking about?

503
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:36,036
I know you. You make plans, and then
you make plans to make other plans.

504
01:04:36,125 --> 01:04:40,698
You're frothing at the mouth.
It's unbecoming.

505
01:05:01,583 --> 01:05:03,539
Get them!

506
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,322
Don't feel bad. Could happen to anyone.

507
01:05:11,417 --> 01:05:14,705
- My hand is still paralysed.
- Yeah, course it is.

508
01:05:14,792 --> 01:05:17,625
- It is.
- I know.

509
01:05:28,292 --> 01:05:31,864
Right. After you, ladies. Come on.

510
01:05:31,958 --> 01:05:33,869
Hurry up.

511
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:37,530
- Where does that go?
- Fucking narnia. Go. In. In!

512
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:39,206
Fine.

513
01:05:51,708 --> 01:05:55,656
- No plan?
- Now is not the time.

514
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:57,286
Out of my way.

515
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,741
- Need help, ma?
- No, thank you.

516
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:11,409
I think I'm quite capable of disposing
of one idiotic grate.

517
01:06:47,375 --> 01:06:51,618
That freezer is a mess.
It's completely unacceptable.

518
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,662
- Come on.
- Are you kidding me?

519
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:05,581
- We have to go.
- Go where?

520
01:07:05,667 --> 01:07:07,407
Obviously your plan was to end up here.

521
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:10,207
- That was a long time ago.
- Mom.

522
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:12,999
- I am not going in there.
- Mom, listen to me. We need weapons.

523
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:14,869
We need a car. We need a safe house.

524
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:19,452
- I'm not sure they'd even let me in.
- Only one way to find out.

525
01:07:28,667 --> 01:07:30,578
Hey.

526
01:07:45,125 --> 01:07:47,787
For the record,
I still think this is a shit idea.

527
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,036
Madeleine?

528
01:08:08,833 --> 01:08:12,325
Girls, I think I see a ghost.

529
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:18,703
- Hi, Madeleine.
- Hi, Scarlet.

530
01:08:18,792 --> 01:08:20,532
Florence.

531
01:08:22,792 --> 01:08:27,240
- Hi, Anna may.
- No. No, you don't get to talk.

532
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:31,208
Because you're a ghost
and ghosts can't talk.

533
01:08:31,292 --> 01:08:34,910
- You know how I know that?
- Can we do this later?

534
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,744
Because if ghosts could talk, they would
say something before disappearing.

535
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:42,825
Or at least leave a note. But they can't.

536
01:08:42,917 --> 01:08:46,080
So, ipso facto, you're a ghost.

537
01:08:46,792 --> 01:08:48,498
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck you!

538
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:50,915
Language, Anna may.
There's a child present.

539
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,743
- Fine.
- Fudge you.

540
01:08:54,833 --> 01:08:57,870
- Fudge you.
- Fudge you.

541
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,662
And why is there a toddler in our place
of business?

542
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:09,992
- The short version?
- Please.

543
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:12,745
Well, her father was killed
and she has nowhere else to go.

544
01:09:12,833 --> 01:09:18,032
I was downsized by the firm and they fed
me to mcalester's endless supply of thugs.

545
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:19,740
And you decided to come here?

546
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:22,018
I'm sorry. Shall we come back
at a more convenient time?

547
01:09:22,042 --> 01:09:23,782
Maybe you should.

548
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:27,948
It seems like whenever you come here,
you bring a war with you.

549
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:34,368
Bringing your problems...
We need to table this for now.

550
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:41,037
Seconded. Let's go down.

551
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,447
Go and take Emily. I'll buy you some time.

552
01:10:04,542 --> 01:10:06,624
I think I should stay.

553
01:10:09,417 --> 01:10:14,741
No. I screwed this up.
I'll clean up my own mess.

554
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:20,497
We'll meet at the diner once
I've finished them off. Go.

555
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:24,161
Please.

556
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:27,369
Come.

557
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:32,041
Sure you don't need help?
I could use the target practice.

558
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:37,781
Anna may was right.
Shouldn't have dragged you into this.

559
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:52,290
- I'm staying with you.
- No. No, you're not.

560
01:10:52,375 --> 01:10:55,117
You're going with them to the basement
where it's safe.

561
01:10:55,208 --> 01:10:57,699
But you need me. I'm your apprentice.

562
01:10:57,792 --> 01:11:00,750
Okay, listen, Emily.
The bad men are coming.

563
01:11:00,833 --> 01:11:02,994
I really need you to go with my mom.

564
01:11:03,083 --> 01:11:06,450
- No. I wanna stay with you.
- You can't.

565
01:11:06,542 --> 01:11:09,454
- But why?
- Because...

566
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:18,078
- Because I killed your father.
- You're lying.

567
01:11:18,167 --> 01:11:20,283
You just wanna get rid of me.

568
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:26,907
Your dad, he stole
from some very bad people.

569
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,324
And they hired me.

570
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:33,657
And I shot him.

571
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:48,083
Come on. Let's go.

572
01:11:56,333 --> 01:12:00,451
- I need weapons.
- Try the self-help section.

573
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:35,620
- I have to go help her.
- And you needed my permission?

574
01:12:38,667 --> 01:12:42,580
Look, I'm sorry I couldn't give it up back
then and just stay here with you.

575
01:12:52,125 --> 01:12:55,538
You're human. You screwed up.

576
01:12:55,625 --> 01:12:59,288
I can only imagine how painful
it was leaving her behind.

577
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:14,824
Leaving us all behind.

578
01:13:15,208 --> 01:13:17,540
But she grew up to be a fine woman.

579
01:13:25,583 --> 01:13:27,494
I never wanted this life for her.

580
01:13:34,792 --> 01:13:36,202
Maybe it was meant to be.

581
01:13:36,292 --> 01:13:39,204
Or maybe she wanted to be
just like her mother.

582
01:13:49,708 --> 01:13:51,824
I missed you.

583
01:14:01,375 --> 01:14:03,661
We kept these ladies for you.

584
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:14,449
Just meet us at the diner.
Come back in one piece, okay?

585
01:14:14,542 --> 01:14:16,954
Both of you.

586
01:15:30,792 --> 01:15:32,453
Fuck!

587
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:20,575
- Is anything broken? Are you bleeding?
- I'm fine.

588
01:16:20,667 --> 01:16:22,874
Bleeding on the inside?

589
01:16:23,583 --> 01:16:27,451
- I think the rest of them are coming.
- Would it kill you to say thank you?

590
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:32,994
- You can still go, ma. I'll cover you.
- And miss all the fun?

591
01:16:39,667 --> 01:16:41,623
Women who run with wolves.

592
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,786
Awakening the giant within.
Ammo?

593
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:47,831
How to win friends and influence people.

594
01:17:06,208 --> 01:17:08,870
You really should have stayed away
from this line of work.

595
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:12,906
Are you kidding, ma? You left.

596
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,492
Killing people was the only thing
I knew how to do.

597
01:17:16,583 --> 01:17:20,075
Okay, maybe in retrospect it wasn't
the best environment to raise a child in.

598
01:17:20,167 --> 01:17:21,623
You think?

599
01:17:22,833 --> 01:17:26,496
- But it made you who you are.
- At least we can agree on that.

600
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,947
And you are a strong, smart,
incredibly impressive young woman.

601
01:17:45,167 --> 01:17:48,534
There's not a single person on earth
I'd rather kill people with.

602
01:17:49,917 --> 01:17:51,327
Thanks, ma.

603
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:55,868
And so strong. You can't be eight
and three quarters.

604
01:17:55,958 --> 01:17:56,958
I am.

605
01:17:57,042 --> 01:17:58,998
You sure you're not 28 and three quarters?

606
01:18:07,792 --> 01:18:10,989
Anna may. Madeleine. Come and see this.

607
01:18:21,625 --> 01:18:25,197
We're not leaving.
Scarlet's still a librarian

608
01:18:25,292 --> 01:18:28,659
- no matter how much of an asshole she is.
- Language.

609
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:31,537
So these... jerks.

610
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:36,949
Jerks up there just made the biggest
mistake of their lives

611
01:18:37,042 --> 01:18:41,035
when they stepped into our library
and threatened our own flesh and blood.

612
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:44,617
They're not gonna push us around anymore
and they're not gonna scare us off.

613
01:18:44,708 --> 01:18:46,744
This ends now.

614
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:49,540
Madeleine, finish getting the Van ready.

615
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:54,369
Florence, you and I are going up there
to defend the herd.

616
01:18:54,458 --> 01:18:59,077
We're gonna bring the sky down on their
mother-fudging heads.

617
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:01,283
- All in favour?
- Aye.

618
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:04,697
- Aye.
- Aye.

619
01:19:07,292 --> 01:19:08,907
Motion carried.

620
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:17,205
You think you have a chance here?
I have an army.

621
01:20:17,292 --> 01:20:20,989
Oh, yeah? Well, I've got my mom.

622
01:20:28,125 --> 01:20:32,539
- I wish we had some more time, ma.
- It's quality, not quantity.

623
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:37,286
Chin up.

624
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:38,831
Why don't you just come out?

625
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:42,034
And I will put a bullet through your head.
Nice and quick.

626
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:45,206
Why don't you go fudge yourself?

627
01:20:48,042 --> 01:20:51,409
If you make me work for it, I'm gonna
shoot you in the stomach.

628
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,786
Then we'll have some real fun together.

629
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,956
Hey, dumb-dumbs.

630
01:21:15,167 --> 01:21:17,704
Hey, idiots, catch these!

631
01:22:11,958 --> 01:22:15,701
Idiots to the left. Morons to the right.

632
01:22:15,792 --> 01:22:18,989
The rest of you knuckleheads
stay here and kill those two.

633
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:20,081
Put these on.

634
01:23:29,167 --> 01:23:33,365
I'm gonna make a little noise,
so play it loud.

635
01:23:33,458 --> 01:23:35,414
Can you do that for me?

636
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:33,083
Sam! Reload.

637
01:30:18,042 --> 01:30:20,454
You got something in your hair.

638
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:26,494
It's a tooth.

639
01:30:44,833 --> 01:30:46,824
Hey.

640
01:30:50,833 --> 01:30:53,540
He took Emily.

641
01:30:55,917 --> 01:30:58,499
I couldn't save her.

642
01:30:58,583 --> 01:31:02,246
It's okay. We'll get her back.

643
01:31:15,833 --> 01:31:21,123
It was nice having a kid
in the library again.

644
01:32:09,917 --> 01:32:13,739
There's little joy in life for me.

645
01:32:13,833 --> 01:32:17,121
And little terror in the grave.

646
01:32:17,208 --> 01:32:20,746
I've lived the parting hour to see

647
01:32:20,833 --> 01:32:24,451
of one I would have died to save.

648
01:32:48,833 --> 01:32:53,156
Well, that was exciting.
Been a long time since I killed someone.

649
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:55,662
Let me talk to Emily.

650
01:32:55,750 --> 01:33:01,199
You know, it's a real tragedy what happens
to poor orphans in our line of work.

651
01:33:01,292 --> 01:33:03,408
You know? It's really quite sad.

652
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:07,866
What do you want?

653
01:33:07,958 --> 01:33:09,994
My uncle insists on meeting you.

654
01:33:10,083 --> 01:33:16,124
He says skinning you alive will
let him work through his grief.

655
01:33:16,208 --> 01:33:18,199
That's not too much to ask, is it?

656
01:33:18,292 --> 01:33:24,697
If I come to you, Emily goes free
and everyone else is off the table.

657
01:33:29,125 --> 01:33:31,241
Okay, we have a deal.

658
01:33:31,333 --> 01:33:34,405
The diner. Can't wait.

659
01:33:36,125 --> 01:33:37,331
We gotta go.

660
01:33:37,875 --> 01:33:41,413
Hey, you can't just hand yourself
over to those animals.

661
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:45,118
They can't bring their guns into
the diner. It's Emily's best chance.

662
01:33:45,208 --> 01:33:49,076
- It's a suicide mission.
- Well, someone else got a plan?

663
01:33:52,083 --> 01:33:55,246
I don't right now, no.

664
01:33:56,583 --> 01:33:58,915
But it's you, mom.

665
01:34:00,875 --> 01:34:02,740
You always have a plan.

666
01:34:03,542 --> 01:34:04,873
Sorry.

667
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:12,286
Then I guess this is goodbye.

668
01:34:48,292 --> 01:34:51,955
- They're waiting for you, honey.
- Thanks, Rose.

669
01:35:12,583 --> 01:35:14,574
Did they hurt you?

670
01:35:19,792 --> 01:35:21,874
It's been a long day.

671
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,957
But it's gonna be over soon, okay?

672
01:35:26,458 --> 01:35:27,743
Okay.

673
01:35:38,875 --> 01:35:40,911
You're a special kid, Emily.

674
01:35:42,625 --> 01:35:45,287
I wish I had more time to get to know you.

675
01:36:01,458 --> 01:36:04,905
I'm Jim. Samantha.

676
01:36:07,958 --> 01:36:13,908
You know, Samantha,
I've always considered myself a feminist.

677
01:36:15,458 --> 01:36:19,280
When my first daughter was born,
I was over the moon.

678
01:36:20,417 --> 01:36:22,908
Painted half the house pink.

679
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,868
It was all unicorns and lollipops.

680
01:36:28,583 --> 01:36:30,995
And my second daughter was born.

681
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,412
And the third. And the fourth.

682
01:36:36,250 --> 01:36:38,115
Girls.

683
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:42,492
Always whispering at the dining table.

684
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,912
Always giggling in dark corners.

685
01:36:49,125 --> 01:36:51,286
I love my girls,

686
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,286
but I don't understand them.

687
01:36:57,333 --> 01:36:59,289
Then my son was born.

688
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:03,457
It was different. Simple.

689
01:37:06,625 --> 01:37:08,661
We understood each other.

690
01:37:10,083 --> 01:37:12,324
I wasn't alone any more.

691
01:37:19,583 --> 01:37:21,414
I khow

692
01:37:23,292 --> 01:37:26,455
it was just a job to you

693
01:37:26,542 --> 01:37:29,375
and he was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

694
01:37:31,292 --> 01:37:33,408
None of that matters

695
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:36,947
because you took him away from me.

696
01:37:40,958 --> 01:37:44,371
I'm gonna do terrible things to you,
Samantha.

697
01:37:45,542 --> 01:37:49,455
You are gonna suffer more
than you thought even possible.

698
01:37:50,458 --> 01:37:55,532
Because you have made me a stranger
in my own home again.

699
01:37:56,708 --> 01:38:03,580
For what it's worth,
I am very sorry about your son.

700
01:38:04,625 --> 01:38:06,957
Thank you, Samantha.

701
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,707
Just let the girl go.

702
01:38:12,667 --> 01:38:14,032
Not yet.

703
01:38:17,542 --> 01:38:21,990
- We had a deal.
- And I am a man of my word.

704
01:38:22,083 --> 01:38:25,325
I will set the girl free, unharmed.

705
01:38:27,625 --> 01:38:30,492
But only after she's watched
what I do to you.

706
01:38:35,125 --> 01:38:37,116
Please.

707
01:38:38,708 --> 01:38:43,532
Please, I will do anything.

708
01:38:43,625 --> 01:38:48,073
Don't start begging yet.
There's plenty of time for that.

709
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:51,706
How y'all doing? Can I get you something?

710
01:38:51,792 --> 01:38:53,032
No, we're just fine.

711
01:38:53,125 --> 01:38:55,332
Maybe some more coffee or apple pie?

712
01:38:55,417 --> 01:38:59,706
If I have to tell you no again,
there will be consequences.

713
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:10,203
Hi, sweetheart.

714
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:15,539
- Hi, mom.
- Guess there was a plan after all.

715
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:33,072
- Guess so.
- Why don't you take Emily out of here?

716
01:39:33,167 --> 01:39:35,078
It's no place for a kid.

717
01:39:35,167 --> 01:39:38,364
Stay out of this, ladies.
It's not your fight.

718
01:39:39,083 --> 01:39:43,406
There's no more standing on the sidelines.
We all need to pick a side.

719
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:45,707
Right, ladies?

720
01:43:26,958 --> 01:43:29,415
Emily.

721
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:05,492
I'm so sorry I killed your father, Emily.

722
01:44:06,208 --> 01:44:09,371
- If I could take it back...
- I know.

723
01:44:10,333 --> 01:44:12,824
But you tried to save him.

724
01:44:13,708 --> 01:44:15,573
Still.

725
01:44:16,292 --> 01:44:18,374
And you saved me.

726
01:44:22,958 --> 01:44:24,698
Thank you.

727
01:44:25,458 --> 01:44:29,246
Besides, I know you just pulled
the trigger.

728
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,117
I know there was someone else
who told you what to do.

729
01:44:33,667 --> 01:44:36,409
Who sent you to my father?

730
01:44:46,583 --> 01:44:49,700
There's a group of men called the firm.

731
01:44:53,292 --> 01:44:57,581
- It's a girl scout.
- Get rid of her.

732
01:44:58,750 --> 01:45:00,706
No, wait.

733
01:45:01,208 --> 01:45:05,030
They've been running things for a long,
long time.

734
01:45:06,375 --> 01:45:08,582
They make all the rules

735
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:12,036
and change them when it fits their needs.

736
01:45:17,458 --> 01:45:19,449
They think they're untouchable.

737
01:45:21,917 --> 01:45:25,114
They think they can get away
with anything.

738
01:45:26,333 --> 01:45:29,405
But they won't, right?

739
01:45:31,750 --> 01:45:34,867
No, they won't.

740
01:45:36,250 --> 01:45:37,990
Not any more.

741
01:45:43,292 --> 01:45:46,864
Well, well, well. What do we have here?

742
01:45:46,958 --> 01:45:51,907
- I'm selling cookies.
- Really? Where are they?

743
01:45:53,833 --> 01:45:58,953
You're the little girl that I've heard
so much about, aren't you?

744
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:07,868
They think so little of me, they sent
a child to do their dirty work?

745
01:46:07,958 --> 01:46:09,664
I'm insulted, frankly.

746
01:46:18,167 --> 01:46:20,328
"Look into your heart?"

747
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:29,740
Fuck me.

748
01:46:32,833 --> 01:46:35,700
- Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.

749
01:46:35,792 --> 01:46:39,284
We're both alive and well.
And that's the way it's gonna stay.

750
01:46:39,375 --> 01:46:42,742
Come on, Sam.
You know that's not up to me.

751
01:46:42,833 --> 01:46:46,030
You get one chance to end this now.

752
01:46:46,125 --> 01:46:49,913
Years ago my mom screwed up
and pulled the wrong trigger.

753
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,787
I'm not making the same mistake.

754
01:46:52,875 --> 01:46:57,118
That little girl in front of you
will have a future.

755
01:46:57,208 --> 01:47:01,907
Go back to the partners and tell them we
know where they work, where they live.

756
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:06,494
We can kill them a hundred times over
without them ever seeing us coming.

757
01:47:07,667 --> 01:47:12,616
Tell them they were only spared
because of an eight-year-old girl.

758
01:47:12,708 --> 01:47:14,619
Eight and three quarters.

759
01:47:14,708 --> 01:47:19,702
Sorry. Eight and three quarters. Got it?

760
01:47:19,792 --> 01:47:21,077
Got it.

761
01:47:21,167 --> 01:47:26,912
Now, close your eyes and count to ten.
Slow.

762
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:34,575
One, two, three,

763
01:47:34,667 --> 01:47:40,367
four, five, six, seven,

764
01:47:40,458 --> 01:47:44,121
eight, nine...

765
01:47:46,792 --> 01:47:48,748
Ten.

766
01:48:11,875 --> 01:48:14,582
- Can I drive?
- No.

767
01:48:16,167 --> 01:48:18,909
Can I turn on the radio, then?

768
01:48:20,667 --> 01:48:22,623
Go nuts, baby girl.

769
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:29,073
Right, folks, time to hit the road.

770
01:48:29,167 --> 01:48:32,739
Take care, and see you on the other side.
