1
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:10,010
Now, children,
are you sitting comfortably?

2
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:13,055
Then I'll begin.

3
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,350
This story started
many thousands of years ago...

4
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,728
but it was all over
in just seven days.

5
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,730
All that long, long time ago...

6
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:23,899
none of the things
we can see now...

7
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:27,027
the sun, the moon,
the stars, the earth...

8
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:30,823
the animals and plants,
not a single one existed.

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,825
Only God existed...

10
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,494
and so only he
could have created them.

11
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:37,288
And he did.

12
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:50,045
Simpson.
What a character he was.

13
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:52,172
I wonder whatever became of him?

14
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,758
Oh, I imagine
he's dead like all the rest.

15
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,469
Ah, those were the days.

16
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,856
Mr. Tuttle, your hair.

17
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,032
Yes?

18
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,035
Good morning, ma'am.
We've come about the...

19
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,747
Oh, yes, of course.

20
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,123
Come in.

21
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,877
I wasn't expecting you so soon.

22
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,178
You are...?

23
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,804
I'm Bertha Mills, ma'am.

24
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,098
And this is Edmund Tuttle.

25
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:44,808
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

26
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,602
You must be the gardener.

27
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,812
That's right. The gardener.

28
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:52,858
And this young lady
is called Lydia.

29
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,486
Have you had
much experience in service?

30
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,739
Oh, don't let that angel face
fool you, ma'am.

31
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,741
She's older than she looks.

32
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,659
Can you iron?

33
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,081
What's the matter?
Has the cat got your tongue?

34
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,502
She can't talk, ma'am.

35
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,087
The poor little mite's a mute.

36
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,381
Oh, but she's
a good little worker.

37
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,466
I can promise you that.

38
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:20,219
All right.

39
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,805
All right. The other girl
I had spoke too much anyway.

40
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,557
Follow me.
Mrs. Mills, you and the girl...

41
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:28,393
will sleep in the attic room
at the top of the stairs.

42
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,772
- And you, Mr...
- Tuttle, ma'am.

43
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:36,360
You could sleep in the shed
around the back.

44
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,738
As you can see, the housework
has been rather neglected...

45
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:42,116
since the servants disappeared
almost a week ago.

46
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,409
You mean they just vanished?

47
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,121
Into thin air.

48
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,498
No notice, nothing. They didn't
even collect their wages.

49
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,459
They... They just left us.

50
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:54,753
What a strange thing to do.

51
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:56,797
You'll soon find out
there are times...

52
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,342
when this house is not
exactly an ideal home.

53
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,094
Hence my advertisement
in the newspaper...

54
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:05,597
requesting honest,
hard-working people.

55
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,433
There's nobody more honest
or hard-working than us.

56
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,768
Isn't that right, Mr. Tuttle?

57
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,937
Oh, aye, we're very honest.

58
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,149
And very hard-working.

59
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,404
The kitchen.

60
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,322
I have breakfast at 8:00.

61
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,408
The children at 9:00.

62
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,619
Lunch will be served at 1:00
and dinner at 7:30.

63
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:30,080
And the master, ma'am?

64
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,127
The master went off to war...

65
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,920
a year and a half ago.

66
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:41,049
I've had no news
since the war ended.

67
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,551
Which of you does the cooking?

68
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,970
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

69
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,972
Which of you does the cooking?

70
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,016
You'll notice what I'm doing.

71
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,561
In this house,
no door must be opened...

72
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,730
without the previous one
being closed first.

73
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,482
It is vital
that you remember this.

74
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,568
It's not as easy
as it may seem.

75
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,654
There are 15 different keys
for all of the 50 doors...

76
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:06,158
depending on which area of
the house you're in at the time.

77
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,744
Mrs. Mills,
from tomorrow onwards...

78
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,288
I will be leaving
a set of keys in your charge.

79
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,748
Yes, ma'am.

80
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:14,791
The music room.

81
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,169
That old piano was already here
when we moved in.

82
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:21,215
Please do not let
the children thump away on it.

83
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,091
It sets off my migraine.

84
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:27,804
Silence is something that we prize
very highly in this house.

85
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,557
That is why you will not find
a telephone, a radio...

86
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:32,726
or anything else
that makes a racket.

87
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,937
Oh, we don't have
electricity either.

88
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,439
During the war, the Germans
kept cutting it off.

89
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,025
So we learned to live without it.
Let's continue.

90
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,694
Ma'am, there's no need
to show us the whole house.

91
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:43,862
Yes!

92
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,115
Yes, there is.

93
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,743
Most of the time,
you can hardly see your way.

94
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,578
It's often difficult
to make out...

95
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,831
if there is a table, a chair,
a door, a sideboard...

96
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:59,044
or one of my children
playing hide and seek.

97
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,172
What do you mean, ma'am?

98
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:05,133
Perhaps I should introduce you
to the children.

99
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,141
Mr. Tuttle,
you can see to the garden now.

100
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,476
You'll find tools in the shed.

101
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,144
Yes, ma'am.

102
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,730
You two can start closing
the curtains.

103
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,524
All of them.

104
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,389
Come.

105
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:06,361
I'll wake them.
You wait here.

106
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,655
Whatever you do,
don't open the curtains.

107
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,453
Wakey, wakey.

108
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,790
Now, come on.

109
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:21,710
Eyes closed, hands together.

110
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,796
Let it be, at light of day...

111
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,049
Jesus, to whom now I pray.

112
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,468
Blessed be the Virgin pure...

113
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,595
whom I greet with faith
too short.

114
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,764
Jesus, Mary, spotless rose...

115
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:37,100
keep us till this day
doth close.

116
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,649
They're still half asleep.

117
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:48,111
What sweet little children.

118
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,490
Well, what do you say?

119
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,742
How do you do?

120
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:55,535
How do you do?

121
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:59,206
How do you do, children?

122
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,999
My name is Mrs. Mills...

123
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,211
but you can call me
Bertha if you like.

124
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,088
What are your names?

125
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,673
- Anne.
- Nicholas.

126
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,220
Anne and Nicholas.
What pretty names.

127
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,014
Are you going to be
our new nanny?

128
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,521
Yes, my dears.
I'm your new nanny.

129
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,523
It's time for their breakfast.

130
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,650
Lydia, go to the kitchen
and close every shutter.

131
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:36,410
The doctors were never able
to find a cure.

132
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,412
For what?

133
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,789
Their condition.

134
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:45,335
The children have
a very serious allergy to light.

135
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,754
They are photosensitive
and must never be exposed...

136
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,132
to any light
much stronger than this.

137
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,384
Otherwise,
in a matter of minutes...

138
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,261
they will break out
in sores and blisters...

139
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,597
and begin to suffocate.

140
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,141
It would eventually be fatal.

141
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,435
Good heavens.

142
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:04,312
I don't like this toast.

143
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:05,939
Why not?

144
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,191
It tastes funny.

145
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,193
I liked it better before.

146
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:14,573
That's because before,
somebody else made it.

147
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,867
When are they coming back?

148
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,328
They're not coming back, child.

149
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,331
Just like Daddy.

150
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,876
Daddy is coming back though.

151
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:30,088
Mrs. Mills, our father's
fighting in a war in France.

152
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,423
It's the World War.

153
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,425
I know, but he's in France.

154
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:37,804
That's enough, chatterboxes.
Finish up your breakfasts.

155
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:41,391
Are you going to leave us too?

156
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:44,728
Of course not!

157
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,563
Why should I leave you?

158
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,773
The others said
they wouldn't...

159
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,692
but they did,
and then it happened.

160
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,694
Be quiet!

161
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:59,159
What do you mean, Anne?
What happened?

162
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:03,538
Mummy went... mad.

163
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:06,249
- Nothing happened.
- Yes, it did.

164
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,251
- No, it didn't!
- Yes, it did!

165
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,462
Be quiet.

166
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,342
What's going on?
I want those plates empty...

167
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,844
in less than a minute.
Is that clear?

168
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,266
Mrs. Mills, would you come
outside a moment?

169
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,477
I'd like a word with you.

170
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,730
Yes, ma'am.

171
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:36,530
The postman usually
comes every Wednesday.

172
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,031
But I just checked
the letter-box...

173
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,367
and this week he hasn't.

174
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,285
I'm afraid
I don't follow, ma'am.

175
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,371
This letter
should have been collected...

176
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,957
and delivered to
the newspaper five days ago.

177
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,583
It's an advertisement
for servants.

178
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:49,918
Since it was never published...

179
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,629
would you explain
what you're doing here?

180
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,590
Oh, I understand.

181
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:58,593
Ma'am, that's what
I was going to say to you...

182
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,220
when you opened the door to us.

183
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,806
The truth is
that we just come by...

184
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,100
on the off chance.

185
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,768
A big house like this...

186
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,396
is always in need of someone
who knows the ropes.

187
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,357
You've served in a house
like this one before?

188
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,901
This may come as a surprise
to you, ma'am, but...

189
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,738
we, in fact,
used to work here.

190
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,283
Here?

191
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:25,787
Oh, now,
it was a few years ago.

192
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,832
If you don't mind
my saying so, ma'am...

193
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:32,586
they were the best years
of my life.

194
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,964
That's why we come by,
because this house...

195
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,841
means a lot to us.

196
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,969
Perhaps I'd best show you
our references, ma'am.

197
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,805
No, no, no. Don't bother.
There's no need.

198
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,974
So you say
you know the house well?

199
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,393
Like the back of my hand.

200
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,688
That is assuming the walls
haven't sprouted legs...

201
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,732
and moved in the meantime.

202
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,818
The only thing
that moves here is the light.

203
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,448
But it changes everything.

204
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,747
It's rather difficult,
to say the least.

205
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:14,336
One might almost say...
unbearable.

206
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,966
The only way of enduring it
is by keeping a cool head.

207
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,385
Oh, yes, ma'am.

208
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,096
I don't like fantasies.

209
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,432
Strange ideas.
Do you know what I mean?

210
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,560
I think so, ma'am.

211
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:34,689
My children sometimes
have strange ideas.

212
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:37,400
But you mustn't pay
any attention to them.

213
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,570
Children will be children.

214
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,822
Yes, of course, ma'am.

215
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:48,119
All right. You can stay.

216
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,207
Thank you very much, ma'am.

217
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,887
It did happen.

218
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,732
The Roman governor
tried to make them...

219
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,609
change their minds
afterwards...

220
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,946
To make them change
their minds. Full stop.

221
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,031
Afterwards...

222
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,574
He ordered them
to be beaten.

223
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:30,662
But Justus and Pastor,
far from being afraid...

224
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,331
rejoiced and showed themselves
willing to die for Christ.

225
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:35,083
When he saw this...

226
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,043
the Roman governor
was filled with rage...

227
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:38,586
and ordered their heads
to be cut off.

228
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:47,762
What do you find so amusing?

229
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,139
Well...

230
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,224
Well, what?

231
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,685
Those children
were really stupid.

232
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,770
Why?

233
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,731
Because they said
they only believed in Jesus...

234
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,442
and then
they got killed for it.

235
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,736
And what would you have done,
deny Christ?

236
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,112
Well, yes.

237
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,197
Inside I would have
believed in him...

238
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,992
but I wouldn't have told
the Romans that.

239
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,788
Is that what you think too,
Nicholas?

240
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,961
I see.

241
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,548
So you would have lied
to the point of denying Christ.

242
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,886
You'd have saved your heads
from the Romans, that's true.

243
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,763
But what would have
happened afterwards?

244
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:30,889
When?

245
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,308
In the next life.

246
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,435
The one waiting for us
after we die.

247
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,353
Where would you have gone?

248
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,231
Where, Nicholas?

249
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,941
To the children's limbo.

250
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,943
What is
the children's limbo, Anne?

251
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,154
One of the four Hells.

252
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,614
Which are?

253
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,660
Me, me, me! Me!

254
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,163
No. Let him answer.
Which are?

255
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,957
There's the Hell
where the damned go...

256
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,959
then there's Purgatory...

257
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,377
Yes.

258
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,129
And the bosom of Abraham
where the just go...

259
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,839
and limbo where children go.

260
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,299
At the centre of the earth.

261
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,385
Where it's very, very hot.

262
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,012
That's where children
go who tell lies...

263
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,139
but they don't just go
there for a few days.

264
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,599
Oh, no.

265
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:18,269
No, they're damned. Forever.

266
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,773
Think about it.

267
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,569
Try to imagine
the end of eternity.

268
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,030
Close your eyes.

269
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,492
Close your eyes
and try to imagine it.

270
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,118
Forever.

271
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:39,290
Pain... forever.

272
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,795
I'm getting dizzy.

273
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,964
Now do you understand...

274
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:49,133
why Justus and Pastor
told the truth?

275
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,763
All right.

276
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:57,392
Open your readers
at lesson six.

277
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:58,726
Can't we play?

278
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,520
You most certainly cannot.

279
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:01,980
First you're going
to read the lesson...

280
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,232
then you're going
to learn it by heart.

281
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,358
All of it?

282
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,734
Any more protests...

283
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,362
and there'll be
no playing at all today.

284
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,949
In fact, I think you can
study in separate rooms.

285
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,702
- No, no, no!
- Yes, yes, yes!

286
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,537
But we get scared
if we're separated!

287
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,623
Scared? As if you weren't
used to this house by now.

288
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,584
What if we see a ghost?

289
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,753
Has your sister been telling you
one of her stories?

290
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,505
I haven't told him anything!

291
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,048
If you see a ghost
you say hello...

292
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,550
and continue on studying.

293
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,760
- Come to the music room.
- Why me?

294
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,679
Because I say so!
Now come on.

295
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,723
Take your book.

296
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,391
Nicholas, I want to see
that lesson learned...

297
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,726
in less than an hour.

298
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,395
- Mummy...
- What?

299
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,689
Give me a kiss.

300
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:47,650
Give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss.

301
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,736
Anne, wait for me outside.

302
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:53,489
You know I can't.

303
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,074
Over there.

304
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:00,455
Mrs. Mills,
close all the curtains.

305
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:04,000
My daughter is going
to cross the living room.

306
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,127
Yes, ma'am.

307
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,218
All right, Anne.

308
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,681
Darling...

309
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:24,395
Mummy can't be with you
all the time, hmm?

310
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,275
You must learn to be
on your own.

311
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,695
Where's your rosary?

312
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,576
Whenever you feel afraid...

313
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,454
I want you to squeeze it
with all your might...

314
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:45,124
say an Our Father,
and your fear will go away.

315
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:49,545
- It won't.
- Yes, it will. Honestly.

316
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,339
Don't you see that
when you do that...

317
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,383
the Lord is with you?

318
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,011
There's no reason to be afraid.

319
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,302
The house and the family.

320
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:41,639
We all live in a house
with our family.

321
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:45,101
The family is usually
made up of parents...

322
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,729
children,
and their grandparents.

323
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,564
We must be obedient...

324
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,900
and kind towards
other members of our family...

325
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,695
and we must
never argue or fight...

326
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,322
with our brothers and sisters.

327
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,324
Do you have any children?

328
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,784
No.

329
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:06,122
Mr. Tuttle and the girl Lydia
are all I've got...

330
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,540
and I'm all they've got.

331
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,542
Was she born like that?

332
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,170
Beg your pardon, ma'am?

333
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:15,423
The girl.
Was she born a mute?

334
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:19,302
No.

335
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,471
I think
I've finished here, ma'am.

336
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,598
If you'll excuse me,
I think I'll go...

337
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:26,225
and see if Mr. Tuttle
needs a hand.

338
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:57,548
Nicholas!

339
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:04,430
Nicholas, I'm coming!

340
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,481
- Nicholas?
- What's the matter?

341
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:14,732
Why were you crying?

342
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,443
I wasn't crying.
I was reading.

343
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:20,571
But I just heard you...
Anne!

344
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:30,039
Anne!

345
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,709
Anne?

346
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,753
I haven't learned it yet, Mummy.

347
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:39,465
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

348
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,593
- Why were you crying?
- I wasn't.

349
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:46,347
I just heard you a moment ago.

350
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,432
There's no need
to feel ashamed, darling.

351
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,725
I don't.

352
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,103
If I'd been crying,
I'd tell you.

353
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,313
Oh, really.
So I imagined it, did I?

354
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,691
No. It was that boy.

355
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,651
What boy?

356
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,153
Victor.

357
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,530
Who's Victor?

358
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:06,033
The boy that was here
a moment ago.

359
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:07,952
I told him to let me study...

360
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,163
but he wouldn't stop crying.

361
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,039
I think he's a spoiled brat.

362
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,375
He said we'd have
to leave the house.

363
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:18,045
Oh, did he, now?
And why was he crying?

364
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,755
Because he doesn't
like this house...

365
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,967
but he has to live here.
His father's a pianist...

366
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,469
- His father's a pianist?
- Yes.

367
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:28,931
I already told him he's not
allowed to touch the piano.

368
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,183
He isn't, is he, Mummy?

369
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,061
So, you've spoken
to his father as well?

370
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,980
No, only with Victor.

371
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,523
His father's with the others
in the hall.

372
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,859
I've just come from the hall.
There's no one there.

373
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,614
They must've gone upstairs.
They're viewing the house.

374
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,492
That'll do, Anne!
That's enough!

375
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,744
Now why were you crying?

376
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:51,245
It was Victor!

377
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,748
- So where is he now?
- He went out through there!

378
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,458
Would you mind
telling me how a boy...

379
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,461
can get in and out
of this room if it's locked?

380
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:05,760
I thought
I made myself quite clear.

381
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:07,261
No door is to be opened...

382
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:09,096
without the previous one
being closed first.

383
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,390
Is that so hard to understand?

384
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,476
This house is like a ship.

385
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,561
The light must be contained
as if it were water...

386
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:18,689
by opening and closing
the doors.

387
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,650
My children's lives
are at stake!

388
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:21,901
But, ma'am...

389
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,612
Do not argue with me!
Be quiet!

390
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:27,657
Which was the last of you
to enter that room?

391
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,950
Lydia?

392
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:33,788
She hasn't got a key.
I already told you that.

393
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:35,957
That leaves you then.

394
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,541
But I was in the hall
the whole time.

395
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,085
And then I went out
into the garden.

396
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,294
You saw me with your own eyes.

397
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:43,756
I hope you are not suggesting
that it was me!

398
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,133
Do you think that
I would overlook such a thing...

399
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:49,387
and endanger
the life of my own daughter?

400
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:59,230
You're not supposed
to read at the table.

401
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,523
Oh, really?

402
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,442
Who's going to tell Mummy?
You?

403
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:09,782
Or perhaps you?

404
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:17,039
Did you really see a boy?

405
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,833
Yes. He's called Victor.

406
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:22,962
Is he a ghost?

407
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,339
Don't be stupid.
Ghosts aren't like that.

408
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,258
What are they like?

409
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:29,760
I've told you
a thousand times.

410
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:32,888
They go about in white sheets
and carry chains.

411
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,349
- How do you know?
- Because I've seen them.

412
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,935
They come out at night.

413
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,104
Fibber. Where?

414
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,530
- You're stupid.
- Not half as much as you.

415
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:51,741
I don't believe
you saw that boy.

416
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,367
Believe what you like.

417
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:56,120
You'll soon be begging us
to play with you.

418
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,925
Nicholas!

419
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:14,013
What?

420
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,724
Look.

421
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,684
Why have you opened
the curtains?

422
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,644
- It wasn't me.
- Who was it then?

423
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,980
It was Victor.

424
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:25,483
He's been doing it all night.

425
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,693
You're lying.
I'm going to tell Mummy.

426
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:30,363
- So I'm a liar, am I?
- Yes.

427
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:33,115
Victor, come out from
behind that curtain...

428
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,910
so my stupid brother
can see you.

429
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:46,670
Leave me alone.

430
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,589
So you don't want
to see him now, eh?

431
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:50,341
You're a cowardly custard.

432
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:54,261
Cowardly cowardly custard.

433
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,808
I'll just have
to do it myself then.

434
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,576
That's enough, Victor.

435
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,706
Nicholas. Nicholas.

436
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,083
Tell him to leave
the curtains alone.

437
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,376
He won't listen to me.

438
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,795
Stop it.
Get off my bed, both of you.

439
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,505
This is our bed.

440
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,090
No, it's mine.

441
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:34,260
Anne, please stop
putting on that voice.

442
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,887
You be quiet, cowardly custard.

443
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:40,182
Listen, if you don't stop,
I'll call my mother...

444
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,725
and she'll kick you out.

445
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:44,019
You don't know my mother.

446
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,729
And you don't know my parents.

447
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:48,732
Anne, I'm going to tell
Mummy about you.

448
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:52,153
Don't be stupid.
Can't you see it's not me?

449
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:55,573
Victor, touch his cheek
so he knows you're real.

450
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,794
Mummy! Help!

451
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:11,005
Help! Help, Mummy!

452
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:13,757
What is it? What is it?

453
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,635
What is it?

454
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:20,181
She was fighting with me,
and I told her to be quiet.

455
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,725
I'm fed up.
Do you hear me?

456
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,477
I am fed up with you!

457
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,061
I didn't do anything!

458
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:32,526
Therefore the Lord God
sent him forth...

459
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,737
from the Garden of Eden...

460
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,198
to till the ground
from whence he was taken.

461
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,741
So he drove out the man...

462
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,535
and placed to the east
of the Garden of Eden...

463
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:44,038
cherubims
and a flaming sword...

464
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,123
which turned every way
to keep the way...

465
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:47,791
of the Tree of Life.

466
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,461
There. I finished.

467
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,547
Very good.

468
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,927
Now you can ask the Virgin
for forgiveness.

469
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,305
What?
That's not what we agreed!

470
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,349
We didn't agree anything,
young lady.

471
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,310
Today you're being punished,
and you'll do as I say.

472
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,395
You can't make me
ask the Virgin for forgiveness.

473
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:09,855
How dare you!

474
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:13,108
Mummy, I won't ask forgiveness
for something I didn't do!

475
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,277
You told your brother
someone else was in the room!

476
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:16,737
- There was!
- You're lying!

477
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,405
I am not!

478
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,575
Anne...

479
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:25,621
Do you remember the story
about Justus and Pastor?

480
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,791
Children who don't tell
the truth end up in limbo.

481
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:31,669
That's what you say,
but I read the other day...

482
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,547
that limbo's only for children
who haven't been baptized.

483
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,008
And I have!

484
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,553
And Abraham took the wood...

485
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:44,723
of the burnt offering
and laid it upon Isaac his son.

486
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:48,727
And he took the fire
in his hand and a knife...

487
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,938
and they went,
both of them together.

488
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,941
And Isaac spake
unto Abraham his father...

489
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,151
and said, my father...

490
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,822
and he said,
here I am, my son.

491
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,630
Did you look in on Nicholas?

492
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:20,509
Yes, ma'am.
The little angel is fast asleep.

493
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,970
What about Anne?

494
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:24,722
Is she still on the stairs?

495
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:27,600
Oh, yes, ma'am.

496
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,560
I'd prefer to have her
where I can see her...

497
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:32,813
but I can't embroider
in such poor light.

498
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:37,735
How long is this punishment
going to go on?

499
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,737
It's been three days now.

500
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,405
It's up to her.

501
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,075
She's got to learn
to swallow her pride...

502
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:47,536
and ask for forgiveness.

503
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,372
Anyway, it's time
she started to read the Bible.

504
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:55,002
The priest will be very pleased
to hear that, ma'am.

505
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,962
If he ever deigns
to pay us another visit.

506
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:59,089
He knows perfectly well
that the children can't go out.

507
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:00,549
He told me yesterday...

508
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:03,469
he'd be by
as soon as possible.

509
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:07,306
I'm beginning to feel
totally cut off from the world.

510
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,225
This fog doesn't exactly help.

511
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:11,935
It's never lasted
this long before.

512
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:14,104
Oh, that's true, ma'am.

513
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:16,523
Even the seagulls
have gone quiet.

514
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:21,320
Anne!

515
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:24,031
Anne, I can't hear you.

516
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:31,038
Incidentally, Mrs. Mills,
I've had to put up with the noise...

517
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,040
of Lydia running around
above my head.

518
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:34,750
She's been hurtling
backwards and forwards...

519
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,794
as if there were three of her.

520
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,629
Would you kindly tell her
it's not necessary...

521
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:41,382
to kick up quite such a rumpus
just to do a little cleaning?

522
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:44,301
I couldn't bear to get
another migraine attack.

523
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:46,136
I'll tell her, ma'am.

524
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:48,305
Thank you.

525
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,104
Now she's really gone too far.

526
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:40,274
Lydia! Lydia!

527
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:03,046
In the mount of the Lord
it shall be seen.

528
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,757
And the angel of the Lord...

529
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,300
What's going on up there?

530
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,927
Nothing, Mummy.
I'm just reading.

531
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:13,265
- Did you hear it as well?
- Hear what?

532
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,479
And the angel of the Lord...

533
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,731
called unto Abraham
out of Heaven...

534
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:22,733
the second time and said...

535
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:25,194
By myself, I have sworn,
saith the Lord...

536
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,831
What was that?

537
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,333
I don't know.

538
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,753
Anne, tell me
who's making that noise.

539
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,588
I can't tell you, Mummy.

540
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:46,882
You tell me.

541
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,759
I told you
there was someone in the room...

542
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:50,677
and you punished me.

543
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:51,929
Now I don't know what to say.

544
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,474
Anne, I want the truth.

545
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,810
Tell me if there is
someone upstairs.

546
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,397
There. In that junk room.

547
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:54,116
Mummy,
you're letting the light in.

548
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:57,346
- She's a woman.
- She's what?

549
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,037
Where did they go?

550
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:24,247
They just came past here.
Didn't you see them?

551
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,958
Which way did they go?

552
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:29,419
Over there, over there,
and down there as well.

553
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,054
They're everywhere.
They say this house is theirs.

554
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,808
And they're going
to take the curtains down.

555
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:46,144
Ma'am, stay calm, please.

556
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:47,312
I will not stay calm!

557
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,356
For five whole years
during the occupation...

558
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,900
I managed to avoid a single Nazi
stepping foot in this house...

559
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:55,696
and now there is someone here,
opening and closing the doors.

560
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,698
Ma'am, this is a very old house.

561
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:00,701
The floorboards squeak
and the plumbing clanks...

562
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,661
There were voices.
I'm telling you.

563
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:04,162
Mummy, look.

564
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:05,747
A boy and two women,
talking together.

565
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,416
Mummy, look!

566
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:11,211
I did it yesterday.

567
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:12,963
This is the father,
this is the mother...

568
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:16,383
this is Victor,
and this is the old woman.

569
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:18,343
What do these numbers stand for?

570
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:20,554
That's the number
of times I've seen them.

571
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:23,056
I've seen the old woman
the most.

572
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,438
Oh, God in Heaven.

573
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,731
Mrs. Mills,
go and call Mr. Tuttle.

574
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:33,275
We have to search
the whole house immediately...

575
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,484
before it gets dark.

576
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:36,445
- Yes, ma'am. There, now.
- Mummy!

577
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:37,738
Yes, darling. It's all right.

578
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:41,283
Nothing will happen to you
while Mummy's here.

579
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:44,453
Look, Mummy.
She really scares me.

580
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,662
It's as if she's not
looking at you...

581
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:47,330
but she can see you.

582
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:50,208
And she's always around
saying come with me...

583
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,085
No, Anne, don't lie to me.

584
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:54,713
Honestly, Mummy.
And she asks me things.

585
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,757
Victor told me she's a witch.

586
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,216
What does she ask you?

587
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,093
Things.

588
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:05,015
Her breath smells.

589
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,020
We have to open
all the curtains.

590
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,980
I don't want any dark corners
where someone could hide.

591
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:13,648
Yes, ma'am.

592
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:16,234
You both search the right side,
and I'll take the left.

593
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,195
Then we'll search upstairs.

594
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,934
Perhaps they're ghosts...

595
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,103
who lived
in this house before.

596
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,689
Don't be stupid.
I've already told you.

597
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,357
Ghosts go about
in white sheets...

598
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,110
and carry chains
and go...

599
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,361
Now, Anne.

600
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:44,030
Why do you make up
such stories?

601
00:38:44,114 --> 00:38:46,158
I don't.
I read them in books.

602
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,118
Well, you shouldn't
believe everything...

603
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:49,286
that you read in books.

604
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,954
That's what our mother says.

605
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:54,541
She says all this stuff
about ghosts is rubbish...

606
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,543
and then she expects us...

607
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,753
to believe everything
written in the Bible.

608
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,297
And don't you believe it?

609
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,464
I believe some things.

610
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,925
But, for example,
I don't believe...

611
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:06,595
that God made the world
in seven days.

612
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,305
And I don't believe
that Noah...

613
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:10,557
got all those animals
into one boat...

614
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,143
or the Holy Spirit is a dove.

615
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,520
No, I don't
believe that either.

616
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:17,314
Doves are anything but holy.

617
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:18,857
They poo on our windows.

618
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:28,283
Have you mentioned
any of this to your mother?

619
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:35,892
Ma'am.

620
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:37,644
Yes?

621
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,938
They've searched
everywhere, ma'am.

622
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:41,523
There's no one.

623
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,441
I see.

624
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:48,238
Mrs. Mills.

625
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:49,781
Yes, ma'am?

626
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,784
Do you have any idea
what this might be?

627
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,663
'Tis a photograph album, ma'am.

628
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,206
No, but look.
They're all asleep.

629
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,333
Look.

630
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:03,086
They're not asleep, ma'am.
They're dead.

631
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,589
'Tis a book of the dead.

632
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:08,550
In the last century,
I believe...

633
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,510
they used to take
photographs of the dead...

634
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,345
in the hopes
that their souls...

635
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:15,265
would go on living
through the portraits.

636
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,353
There are even
group portraits.

637
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:23,356
And children!

638
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:26,276
Oh, it's macabre!

639
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:30,572
How could these people
be so superstitious?

640
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:32,991
Grief over the death
of a loved one...

641
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:37,162
can lead people to do
the strangest things.

642
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,585
Get rid of it.
I don't want it in the house.

643
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:45,545
Yes, ma'am.

644
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,725
Mrs. Mills, it's cold.

645
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,977
Why don't you come
and sit by the fire?

646
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:15,533
Thank you very much, ma'am.

647
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,579
So, tell me about
when you worked here before.

648
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,706
Did you have
to look after children then?

649
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:26,294
No, I was in charge of
organizing the housework.

650
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:28,880
Were there many servants?

651
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:32,926
Oh, about fifteen.

652
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:34,135
Though in the end...

653
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:36,554
there were just
the three of us left.

654
00:42:36,638 --> 00:42:37,889
Why?

655
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,183
My employers moved to London.

656
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:44,229
They came here
less and less...

657
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,356
It being
so out of the way like.

658
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:50,777
So gradually the house
just became empty.

659
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:55,740
Everybody ends up leaving
this damned island.

660
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:59,077
My family left
in the summer of 1940...

661
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,539
just before the invasion.

662
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:04,749
That was the last
I've heard of them.

663
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:12,132
I don't blame them.

664
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:15,760
Actually, we left too.

665
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:17,554
Although, you know...

666
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,681
sometimes when
you leave a place...

667
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:24,269
it's like it's there
with you all the time.

668
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:27,981
I always felt like
I never left this house.

669
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,316
Why did you leave?

670
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,652
Oh, 'twas on account of
the tuberculosis.

671
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,947
The whole area was evacuated.

672
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:40,618
Was that when Lydia went dumb?

673
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:43,705
Yes, I think so...

674
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:47,625
though my memory's
a bit rusty these days, ma'am.

675
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:49,210
What happened to her?

676
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:57,677
It was suddenly one day.

677
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,598
She just... stopped talking.

678
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,726
There must've been a reason.

679
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:07,145
People don't just stop talking.

680
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:08,730
These things
are always the result...

681
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:11,900
of some sort of trauma.

682
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,152
Something
must've happened to her.

683
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:20,074
Did your employers
treat you well?

684
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:22,076
Oh, they were always
very kind to us.

685
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,205
They treated us
just like family.

686
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:30,752
You know, ma'am,
I think I will go to bed.

687
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:33,588
I'll never be able
to get up in the morning.

688
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,173
Off you go.

689
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,050
I'm going to stay here
a while longer.

690
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:38,843
Yes, ma'am.

691
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:16,714
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

692
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:25,390
Can you forgive me?

693
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,605
Anne.

694
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:52,750
Mummy.

695
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:53,918
What?

696
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,379
When's Daddy coming home?

697
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:59,924
When the war's over.

698
00:46:00,008 --> 00:46:02,051
Why did he go to war?

699
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:07,015
I mean, nobody's done
anything bad to us.

700
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,058
Daddy went...

701
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:15,732
Daddy went
because he's very brave...

702
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:17,817
and because
he wasn't prepared...

703
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,404
to let the Germans tell him
what he had to do.

704
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,156
Why?

705
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:34,334
Charles...

706
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,502
Where are you?

707
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,839
Mrs. Mills!

708
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:28,841
Mrs. Mills!

709
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:31,636
What's the matter, ma'am?

710
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:35,223
The key to the music room,
give it to me! Quickly!

711
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:37,809
- What's happening, ma'am?
- Come on!

712
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:49,237
Oh, my God.

713
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:54,116
I checked that room myself.

714
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,037
It was empty.

715
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,832
Take these tablets, ma'am.

716
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:02,792
They'll do you good.

717
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:06,003
And yet I felt as if
there was someone else there.

718
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:09,841
And it wasn't human.

719
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:13,177
There is something
in this house.

720
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:15,096
Something diabolic.

721
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,639
Ma'am...

722
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,725
Something which is not...

723
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:24,230
not at rest.

724
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:30,152
I know you don't believe it.

725
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:32,738
You don't believe it, do you?

726
00:50:32,822 --> 00:50:34,115
I don't blame you.

727
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:38,244
I used to not believe
these things.

728
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:43,082
I do believe it, ma'am.

729
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,837
I've always believed
in those things.

730
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,131
They're not easy to explain...

731
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:51,841
but they do happen.

732
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:56,721
We've all heard stories
of the beyond...

733
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:59,849
now and then...

734
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:07,064
and I think sometimes
the world of the dead...

735
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:10,860
gets mixed up
with the world of the living.

736
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:13,821
But it's impossible.

737
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:16,240
The Lord would never allow
such an aberration.

738
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:17,450
The living and the dead...

739
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:21,579
will only meet
at the end of eternity.

740
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:24,332
It says so in the Bible.

741
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:26,834
Ma'am...

742
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:31,672
There isn't always
an answer for everything.

743
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,852
Where are you off to, ma'am?

744
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:47,730
I'm going to the village
to pay Father McGraw a visit.

745
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,857
If he won't come here,
then I shall go to him.

746
00:51:49,941 --> 00:51:51,275
I shall bring him back.

747
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,361
Ma'am, you should wait
till the weather improves.

748
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,154
I've waited long enough.

749
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:57,448
Ma'am,
the priest told me that...

750
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,659
I don't care
what he told you!

751
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:01,869
I want him to tell me
personally!

752
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:03,454
He must come today!

753
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,331
But what are you
going to tell him?

754
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:08,125
That we have searched
every room inch by inch...

755
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:10,878
and now I need them
to be blessed.

756
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:14,340
Ma'am, please, wait.

757
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:15,841
Still, it's very early.

758
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:18,135
- Mr. Tuttle.
- Morning, ma'am.

759
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:21,138
I need you to search
the garden for gravestones.

760
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:22,431
Gravestones?

761
00:52:22,515 --> 00:52:23,849
Yes. When my husband
bought this house...

762
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:25,768
we were told
there was a little cemetery.

763
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:28,229
I think it was over there,
amongst the trees.

764
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:29,438
I've not seen anything.

765
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:32,525
Check carefully.
It could be overgrown.

766
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:33,859
Yes, ma'am.

767
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:36,278
I need to know if there was
a family buried here...

768
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:38,906
and if they had
a little boy, Victor.

769
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:57,466
Now she thinks
the house is haunted.

770
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,177
Do you think
it's safe to let her go?

771
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:03,639
Oh, don't worry. The fog
won't let her get very far.

772
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:05,266
Oh, yes, the fog.

773
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,810
The fog, of course.

774
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,437
And when do you think...

775
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,815
we should bring
all this out into the open?

776
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,734
All in good time, Mr. Tuttle.

777
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:17,236
All in good time.

778
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,822
Speaking of which.

779
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:16,230
Charles?

780
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,481
Grace?

781
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:35,040
You're here. You're here.

782
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:37,126
They said there was no hope.

783
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:40,379
They said I should
give you up for dead.

784
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:43,132
They say a lot of things.

785
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:50,264
Oh, thank you.

786
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,849
Thank you, God.

787
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:53,350
Thank you, God.

788
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:56,562
Every night I prayed for this...

789
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:59,190
begging God to bring you back.

790
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:03,402
Bring the children
their father back.

791
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:04,904
Bring him...

792
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:10,701
But where have you been
all this time?

793
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:15,456
Out there...
looking for my home.

794
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:25,424
You're so different.

795
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,593
So different.

796
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:30,387
Sometimes I bleed.

797
00:57:07,383 --> 00:57:08,926
Ma'am...

798
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:12,513
Mrs. Mills...

799
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:16,642
This is my husband.

800
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:22,564
I'm very pleased
to meet you, sir.

801
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:24,608
He's very weak.

802
00:57:24,692 --> 00:57:25,943
Here.

803
00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:31,448
I want you to prepare a hot bath
and some clean clothes.

804
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,784
And something to eat.

805
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,537
Right away, ma'am.

806
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:56,557
How are my little ones?

807
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,102
Daddy!

808
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:05,649
Why did you take so long?

809
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,116
Hello, Nicholas.

810
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,367
I told you, you see.

811
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:17,244
I told you he'd come back.

812
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:26,253
Have you both been well-behaved?

813
00:58:26,337 --> 00:58:27,880
We've been very good.

814
00:58:28,047 --> 00:58:29,548
Have you been good
to your mother?

815
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:30,716
Very good.

816
00:58:30,883 --> 00:58:34,053
We study every day
for our First Communion.

817
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:37,639
Daddy, did you kill anyone?

818
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:45,439
Here he comes!

819
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:52,237
Darling,
we've prepared lunch for you.

820
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:54,490
Are you coming down
or would you prefer...

821
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:08,754
When's Daddy coming down?

822
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:12,674
Be patient, Anne.
Daddy is... not well.

823
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:14,760
He said he'd seen
a lot of dead men.

824
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:22,434
Mummy, when people die
in the war...

825
00:59:22,518 --> 00:59:23,685
where do they go?

826
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,646
Oh, what a question.

827
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:29,525
- It depends.
- On what?

828
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:33,195
Whether they fought on the side
of the goodies or the baddies.

829
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,781
Your father, for example,
fought for England...

830
00:59:35,864 --> 00:59:37,866
on the side of the goodies.

831
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:42,329
How do you know who the goodies
and the baddies are?

832
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:45,332
That's enough questions.
Eat your food.

833
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:46,917
You'll never go to war.

834
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:48,919
We'll never go anywhere.

835
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:54,258
You're not missing out
on anything.

836
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:56,802
You're much better off at home
with your Mummy and Daddy...

837
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:58,804
who love you very, very much.

838
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:02,141
And the intruders?

839
01:00:03,892 --> 01:00:06,395
There are no intruders here.

840
01:00:06,562 --> 01:00:08,564
But you said that there were.

841
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,149
No, I said that
there are no intruders here.

842
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:12,109
I don't want to hear
another word on the subject.

843
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:14,653
- But you said...
- That is enough!

844
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,989
Can I say something?

845
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:18,198
- No!
- Why not?

846
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:20,868
Because you can't!

847
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:29,251
Anne, stop breathing like that.

848
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:33,172
You heard me. Stop it.

849
01:00:36,175 --> 01:00:38,510
Stop breathing.

850
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:42,598
Right, you go to your room.

851
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:46,768
Go to your room.
No dessert for you today.

852
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:54,818
Oh, no crying now, no crying.

853
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:56,820
Oh, stop that here.

854
01:00:56,904 --> 01:01:00,324
Look what an awful face
you've got when you cry.

855
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:03,869
- I don't care!
- There, there.

856
01:01:04,036 --> 01:01:07,331
You listen to me.

857
01:01:07,414 --> 01:01:09,625
I've seen them too.

858
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,919
You have?

859
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,463
Yes.

860
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:17,299
Why don't you tell my mother?
Then maybe she'll believe me.

861
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:20,511
There are things your mother
doesn't want to hear.

862
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:23,597
She only believes
in what she was taught.

863
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:28,393
But don't worry,
sooner or later...

864
01:01:28,477 --> 01:01:30,479
she'll see them.

865
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:32,731
Then everything
will be different.

866
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:35,526
How?

867
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,028
Oh, you'll see.

868
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:41,782
There are going to be
some big surprises.

869
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:46,411
There are going to be
changes.

870
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:48,580
Changes?

871
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:04,429
Now she's behaving
as if nothing had happened.

872
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:06,807
What about her daughter?

873
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,976
Oh, she's not so stubborn.

874
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:12,271
The children will be
easier to convince.

875
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:17,401
No, it's the mother who's going
to cause us problems.

876
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:21,363
Do you think her husband
suspects anything?

877
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:26,201
No. I don't think
he even knows where he is.

878
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:45,095
Oh, look what
a pretty daughter I've got.

879
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:51,059
Mummy made this veil
especially for you.

880
01:02:51,143 --> 01:02:53,937
I look like a bride.

881
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:58,317
Yes. You do.

882
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:05,616
I need to shorten
the sleeves a little.

883
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:08,035
- You can take it off now.
- No.

884
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:10,245
This dress has to be spotless
for your First Communion.

885
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:11,788
I promise I won't dirty it.

886
01:03:11,872 --> 01:03:14,833
Just let me wear it
for a little longer.

887
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,336
Oh, just a little?

888
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:22,007
All right.
I'll be back shortly.

889
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:24,509
No sitting on the floor
or leaning against the walls.

890
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:25,927
No.

891
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:44,905
Monsieur,
would you like to dance?

892
01:03:47,616 --> 01:03:49,701
I'd love to.

893
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,851
Charles,
you can't go on like this.

894
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:17,729
You must eat something.

895
01:05:33,722 --> 01:05:36,099
Anne, you need to take
the dress off now.

896
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,898
Anne, are you listening to me?

897
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:45,901
Anne?

898
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,783
What did I tell you
about sitting on the floor?

899
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:54,201
But it's clean.

900
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:55,577
It makes no difference.

901
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,497
Why can't you ever do
as you're told...

902
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:23,355
What's the matter?

903
01:06:23,522 --> 01:06:25,565
Where is my daughter?

904
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:31,154
What have you done
with my daughter?

905
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:34,533
Are you mad?
I am your daughter.

906
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:37,369
No! You're not my daughter!

907
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:42,499
No! No!

908
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:46,211
You're not my daughter!
No!

909
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:50,465
No!

910
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:01,852
Ma'am, I heard shouts.

911
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:03,228
She wants to kill me!

912
01:07:03,395 --> 01:07:05,897
She won't stop
until she kills us!

913
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:08,066
She won't stop!

914
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,651
Hush, child. Come with me.

915
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:11,987
You're wicked!
You're wicked! Wicked!

916
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:14,531
Wicked!

917
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:26,543
How is she?

918
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:29,212
There's no calming her...

919
01:07:29,296 --> 01:07:30,839
so I've left her
with her father.

920
01:07:32,299 --> 01:07:34,509
She insisted
on speaking with him.

921
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,849
What happened?
Why did you fight?

922
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:42,559
It wasn't her.

923
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:47,272
It was the old woman
with the strange eyes.

924
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:49,482
She was imitating
my daughter's voice.

925
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:54,029
I'd swear to God
that it wasn't my daughter.

926
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:58,825
Oh, God. God help me.

927
01:07:58,909 --> 01:08:02,245
God help me.
What's the matter with me?

928
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:04,831
I don't know
what's the matter with me.

929
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:07,459
You must get more rest.

930
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:14,299
You can't take on the whole
responsibility of this house.

931
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:15,842
Leave it to us.

932
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:18,261
We know what has to be done.

933
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,308
What do you mean by that?

934
01:08:24,935 --> 01:08:27,270
What do you mean
you know what has to be done?

935
01:08:27,354 --> 01:08:28,980
Nothing, ma'am.
I was just suggesting...

936
01:08:29,147 --> 01:08:32,067
There's nothing to suggest.

937
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:33,485
Who do you think you are?

938
01:08:33,568 --> 01:08:35,362
You have no idea
what has to be done.

939
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:41,868
Or do you?

940
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,582
What are these?

941
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:53,630
The tablets
for your migraine, ma'am.

942
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:55,340
The ones you always take.

943
01:08:55,507 --> 01:08:58,969
Please,
I need to be on my own.

944
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,721
Yes, ma'am.

945
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:27,205
Come, child.

946
01:09:49,728 --> 01:09:52,313
Anne told me everything.

947
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:01,573
I wish I had an explanation,
but I haven't.

948
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:04,034
At first, I thought there
was someone else in the house.

949
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:05,535
Even thought there were ghosts.

950
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:08,455
I'm not talking about
the ghosts.

951
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:11,499
I'm talking about
what happened that day.

952
01:10:18,757 --> 01:10:20,508
I don't know what
you're talking about.

953
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:22,510
Tell me it's not true.

954
01:10:22,594 --> 01:10:25,430
Tell me what happened.

955
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:29,434
Happened?

956
01:10:32,771 --> 01:10:36,232
I don't know
what came over me that day.

957
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:39,944
The servants had left
during the night.

958
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:43,740
Hadn't the courage
to tell me to my face.

959
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:51,790
They knew that I couldn't
leave the house.

960
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:56,211
They knew.

961
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:59,130
Anne.

962
01:10:59,214 --> 01:11:02,300
Anne, what happened?

963
01:11:04,094 --> 01:11:06,387
She hit me.

964
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:09,766
She went mad
like she did that day.

965
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:13,311
Do you remember?

966
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,480
No.

967
01:11:15,647 --> 01:11:20,777
You must forgive me, Charles.

968
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:24,489
Not me. The children.

969
01:11:24,656 --> 01:11:28,159
They know that I love them.

970
01:11:28,243 --> 01:11:30,578
They know I'd never hurt them.

971
01:11:30,662 --> 01:11:32,914
I'd die first.

972
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:39,003
What are you going to do?

973
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:42,090
Are you angry with me?

974
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:47,137
I just came back
to say good-bye...

975
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,847
to my wife and children.

976
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:51,224
Now I must go.

977
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,976
Go where?

978
01:11:53,143 --> 01:11:55,812
To the front.

979
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:57,313
No. The war's over.

980
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,191
The war is not over.

981
01:12:00,358 --> 01:12:03,653
What are you talking about?

982
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,780
You're not going,
do you hear me?

983
01:12:05,864 --> 01:12:08,074
You left us once already.
You can't go!

984
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,202
Why?

985
01:12:11,286 --> 01:12:14,080
Why did you have
to go to that stupid war...

986
01:12:14,164 --> 01:12:16,624
that had nothing to do with us?

987
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:19,627
Why couldn't you have
stayed here like the others?

988
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,795
The others surrendered.

989
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:22,839
We all surrendered!

990
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:26,259
The whole island was occupied!

991
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,928
What did you expect?

992
01:12:33,308 --> 01:12:36,603
What were you trying to prove
by going to war?

993
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:39,439
Your place was here with us.

994
01:12:40,732 --> 01:12:42,984
With your family.

995
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:50,450
I loved you.

996
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:54,662
That was enough for me.

997
01:12:54,746 --> 01:12:57,832
Living in this darkness...

998
01:12:59,334 --> 01:13:01,753
In this prison.

999
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:07,300
But not for you.

1000
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:10,845
I wasn't enough for you.

1001
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:13,598
That's why you left.

1002
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,685
It wasn't just the war.

1003
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:24,108
You want to leave me, don't you?

1004
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,070
Anne!

1005
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:34,655
Nicholas!

1006
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:46,793
What is it? What...

1007
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:54,342
Oh, my God!

1008
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:57,845
Here! Oh, my God!

1009
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:05,603
Here!

1010
01:16:16,656 --> 01:16:18,449
Where are the curtains?

1011
01:16:23,246 --> 01:16:25,832
Mrs. Mills!

1012
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:43,266
Let me see. Let me see.

1013
01:16:43,433 --> 01:16:46,561
Oh, you're all right!
You're all right!

1014
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:50,273
I want my daddy!

1015
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:55,528
Daddy's gone.

1016
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:57,738
It's not true!

1017
01:16:57,822 --> 01:17:00,783
Yes, it is.

1018
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:03,244
It is true.

1019
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:07,039
I love you, Mummy.

1020
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:17,008
Find the curtains.

1021
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,679
Who was it?

1022
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:22,930
Who did this?

1023
01:17:23,014 --> 01:17:24,599
Tell me!

1024
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:26,392
Tell me!

1025
01:17:28,519 --> 01:17:29,687
You know what's happening here!

1026
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,981
You know because
it happened to you too!

1027
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:34,192
You'll tell me.

1028
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:35,776
You write it down.

1029
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:38,779
Write it down! Please!

1030
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:41,532
That attitude
won't solve anything, ma'am.

1031
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:44,368
Anyway, she can't write.

1032
01:17:44,452 --> 01:17:46,621
- Where are they?
- What?

1033
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:48,080
The curtains!

1034
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:51,000
The curtains
my children's lives depend on!

1035
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:52,502
Someone has taken the curtains!

1036
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:53,878
I have noticed, ma'am.

1037
01:17:53,961 --> 01:17:56,923
There's no need for you
to raise your voice.

1038
01:17:57,006 --> 01:18:00,343
Oh, Mr. Tuttle. I was just
on the point of calling you.

1039
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:04,388
Did you know that someone
has taken all the curtains?

1040
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:07,725
The curtains?

1041
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:10,311
Oh, dear.

1042
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:13,856
Why should anyone want
to take all the curtains?

1043
01:18:15,233 --> 01:18:17,818
To let some daylight
into this house, I imagine.

1044
01:18:18,569 --> 01:18:21,072
Daylight. Of course.

1045
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:23,449
Someone wants to kill
my children.

1046
01:18:23,533 --> 01:18:26,369
Why do you think that
the daylight would kill them?

1047
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:29,997
Are you mad?

1048
01:18:30,081 --> 01:18:32,458
I told you.

1049
01:18:32,542 --> 01:18:34,126
I already told you!

1050
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:37,588
The children are photosensitive!
The light will kill them!

1051
01:18:37,672 --> 01:18:40,091
Yes, but that was before.

1052
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:43,052
The condition could have
cleared up by itself.

1053
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:45,763
If you never
expose them to daylight...

1054
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:47,515
how do you know
they're not cured?

1055
01:18:47,682 --> 01:18:52,395
My sister-in-law had terrible
attacks of rheumatism...

1056
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:54,647
in her legs and back.

1057
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:57,567
Then one fine day...

1058
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:00,778
they disappeared.

1059
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:04,115
I am going
to find those curtains...

1060
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:06,367
and when you have finished
helping me hang them...

1061
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:08,411
you will leave this house!

1062
01:19:21,799 --> 01:19:23,759
And what about the master,
ma'am?

1063
01:19:23,843 --> 01:19:26,762
What has he got to say
about all of this?

1064
01:19:26,846 --> 01:19:29,015
Give me your keys.

1065
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:31,058
I want your keys now!

1066
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:37,690
I know what you want.

1067
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,358
You want to frighten us.

1068
01:19:39,442 --> 01:19:41,527
You want to get us out,
me and my children.

1069
01:19:41,611 --> 01:19:42,778
You've wanted
to take over this house...

1070
01:19:42,862 --> 01:19:44,780
ever since the first day
you arrived.

1071
01:19:44,864 --> 01:19:48,743
Now, you give me those keys.
I will not ask again.

1072
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:50,494
You should
try and calm down, ma'am.

1073
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:53,623
Give me the keys.

1074
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:56,292
Give them to me.

1075
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:04,717
And now get out of here.

1076
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:25,363
You know something, Mr. Tuttle?

1077
01:20:25,446 --> 01:20:28,532
I think I've reached
the end of my tether.

1078
01:20:28,616 --> 01:20:30,743
What about you?

1079
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:34,080
Oh, yes. Definitely.

1080
01:20:36,082 --> 01:20:39,126
We'd better go and uncover
the gravestones.

1081
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,458
What's Mummy doing?

1082
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:21,794
I've already told you.
She's gone mad.

1083
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,170
Liar.

1084
01:21:23,254 --> 01:21:28,509
- She's gone mad!
- Liar, liar!

1085
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:35,683
Night-time.

1086
01:21:36,434 --> 01:21:38,269
Where are you going?

1087
01:21:38,436 --> 01:21:40,229
I've had enough.

1088
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,649
I'm going into the woods
to look for Daddy.

1089
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:46,444
Are you going to run away?

1090
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:51,532
If I hang onto the pipe,
I can climb down to the ground.

1091
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:53,451
It's very easy.

1092
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:10,134
If Mummy finds out,
you're in for it.

1093
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:12,511
Yes, yes, yes.

1094
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:23,731
Anne, wait!

1095
01:22:23,898 --> 01:22:26,025
I want to come and look
for Daddy too.

1096
01:22:26,192 --> 01:22:29,445
Liar. You just don't want
to be left on your own.

1097
01:22:29,528 --> 01:22:30,988
Scaredy-pants, scaredy-pants!

1098
01:22:31,155 --> 01:22:32,281
Be quiet!

1099
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:28,420
Anne, I think we got lost.

1100
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:31,590
We still haven't left
the garden yet, silly.

1101
01:23:31,674 --> 01:23:35,636
- I'm scared.
- Shouldn't have come then.

1102
01:23:38,722 --> 01:23:41,767
- Say something.
- What shall I say?

1103
01:23:41,851 --> 01:23:44,228
I don't know. Anything.

1104
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:47,565
Let's see.
My name is Anne and I'm walking.

1105
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,608
I'm walking
and my name is Anne.

1106
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:19,054
What's that over there?

1107
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:22,641
I think they're graves.

1108
01:24:23,642 --> 01:24:25,269
Don't go near!

1109
01:24:25,352 --> 01:24:26,854
Why not?

1110
01:24:27,021 --> 01:24:29,315
What if a ghost jumps out?

1111
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:32,484
Graves don't have ghosts.
Only skeletons.

1112
01:24:49,752 --> 01:24:51,045
There's something written here.

1113
01:24:51,128 --> 01:24:52,546
Let's go!

1114
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:54,924
Wait!

1115
01:25:17,071 --> 01:25:19,990
Anne! What does it say?

1116
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:30,125
You must be
strong now, children.

1117
01:25:30,209 --> 01:25:32,544
Nicholas, come here!

1118
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:35,965
Mrs. Mills, please don't tell
Mummy we've run away.

1119
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,257
Don't speak to them!

1120
01:25:38,092 --> 01:25:39,385
Why?

1121
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:41,762
- They're dead!
- What?

1122
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:43,722
They're ghosts!
Please come here!

1123
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:46,141
Children!

1124
01:25:46,225 --> 01:25:47,977
Nicholas!

1125
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:49,770
They're ghosts?

1126
01:25:49,853 --> 01:25:51,981
Why aren't they wearing sheets
and clanking chains?

1127
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:53,649
You said that...

1128
01:25:53,816 --> 01:25:56,110
I don't care what I said!
Get away from them!

1129
01:25:56,193 --> 01:25:59,154
You're always teasing me
and telling lies...

1130
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:00,572
and I'm sick of it!

1131
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:02,741
I'm not teasing you!
I'm telling the truth!

1132
01:26:02,825 --> 01:26:05,160
Come here!

1133
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:08,789
Quick!

1134
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:12,292
Mum! Mum!

1135
01:26:13,127 --> 01:26:15,045
Children!

1136
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:22,136
Run!

1137
01:26:22,302 --> 01:26:23,721
Run!

1138
01:26:23,804 --> 01:26:27,099
Go! Into the house!

1139
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,228
Don't come any closer!

1140
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:34,189
Don't move!

1141
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:39,737
Don't trouble yourself, ma'am.

1142
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:42,698
Tuberculosis finished us off...

1143
01:26:42,781 --> 01:26:45,409
more than half a century ago.

1144
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:07,056
Go away!

1145
01:27:13,645 --> 01:27:15,105
Open the door, ma'am. Please.

1146
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:16,440
What do you want?

1147
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:19,151
Mummy, don't open the door.
Don't.

1148
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:21,361
We've seen their graves.

1149
01:27:21,445 --> 01:27:23,280
Go upstairs and hide.

1150
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:25,240
- Go on.
- I'm scared.

1151
01:27:31,955 --> 01:27:34,708
Don't separate!

1152
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:44,093
Whatever you do, don't separate.

1153
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:48,388
Go hide. Go. Go.

1154
01:27:48,472 --> 01:27:51,183
We've been trying
to make you understand.

1155
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:55,395
Understand what?

1156
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:56,939
About the house.

1157
01:27:57,022 --> 01:27:59,691
About the new situation.

1158
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:01,902
What situation?

1159
01:28:02,069 --> 01:28:06,323
We must all learn
to live together...

1160
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:07,449
the living and the dead.

1161
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:13,163
If you're dead,
leave us in peace!

1162
01:28:13,247 --> 01:28:15,707
Leave us in peace!

1163
01:28:15,874 --> 01:28:19,086
Leave us in peace!

1164
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:26,760
In here. Get inside.

1165
01:28:31,849 --> 01:28:34,017
And suppose we do leave you.

1166
01:28:34,101 --> 01:28:36,311
Do you think they will?

1167
01:28:36,395 --> 01:28:37,771
Who?

1168
01:28:37,938 --> 01:28:39,898
The intruders.

1169
01:28:40,065 --> 01:28:41,817
There are no intruders.

1170
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,527
They took the curtains down.

1171
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:44,987
There are no intruders.

1172
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:47,656
Oh, yes,
I assure you it was them.

1173
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:51,785
And now they're in there
with you and the children.

1174
01:28:51,869 --> 01:28:54,204
- Waiting for you.
- No!

1175
01:28:54,288 --> 01:28:58,625
Yes. And believe me,
sooner or later...

1176
01:28:58,792 --> 01:29:01,128
they'll find you.

1177
01:29:01,295 --> 01:29:03,130
Listen, wait here,
and I'll be back in a minute.

1178
01:29:03,213 --> 01:29:06,091
No, no, no. Mummy said
we shouldn't separate.

1179
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:08,093
We can't leave her on her own.

1180
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:15,225
Stop breathing like that.

1181
01:29:22,274 --> 01:29:25,110
Nicholas,
stop breathing like that.

1182
01:29:28,113 --> 01:29:29,740
Stop breathing!

1183
01:29:31,742 --> 01:29:35,454
Can't you hear it?
There's someone there.

1184
01:29:39,041 --> 01:29:41,752
Come with us, children.

1185
01:29:41,835 --> 01:29:44,379
Come with us.

1186
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:52,804
Nicholas?

1187
01:29:54,973 --> 01:29:56,308
Anne?

1188
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,812
Where are you?

1189
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:05,651
Answer me!

1190
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:07,152
The intruders have found them.

1191
01:30:07,236 --> 01:30:09,738
There's nothing we can do now.

1192
01:30:09,821 --> 01:30:15,035
You'll have to go
upstairs and talk to them.

1193
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:35,097
Our Father,
who art in Heaven...

1194
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:37,349
hallowed be Thy name.

1195
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:39,268
Thy kingdom come...

1196
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:41,478
Thy will be done on earth...

1197
01:30:41,561 --> 01:30:44,189
as it is in Heaven.

1198
01:30:44,273 --> 01:30:46,650
Give us this day
our daily bread...

1199
01:30:46,733 --> 01:30:48,360
and forgive us
our trespasses...

1200
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:54,533
Why are you afraid, children?

1201
01:30:54,616 --> 01:30:57,619
Why don't you want us
to be your friends?

1202
01:30:59,663 --> 01:31:03,375
Come on. Speak to us.

1203
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:05,836
Speak to us.

1204
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:13,468
Tell me what happened.

1205
01:31:14,803 --> 01:31:17,889
Don't tell her!
Don't tell her!

1206
01:31:18,056 --> 01:31:21,727
Don't tell her.

1207
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:26,440
If I tell her,
they'll leave us in peace.

1208
01:31:27,441 --> 01:31:28,817
Mummy!

1209
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:32,321
Mummy.

1210
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:35,741
Why are you crying, children?

1211
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:39,202
What happened in this room?

1212
01:31:39,286 --> 01:31:43,832
What did your mother do to you?

1213
01:31:54,593 --> 01:31:56,762
Something about a pillow.

1214
01:31:56,928 --> 01:32:00,390
Is that how she killed you?

1215
01:32:01,808 --> 01:32:03,268
With a pillow?

1216
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:04,728
She didn't kill us!

1217
01:32:04,811 --> 01:32:06,229
Children, if you're dead...

1218
01:32:06,396 --> 01:32:08,940
why do you remain in this house?

1219
01:32:09,024 --> 01:32:10,901
We're not dead!

1220
01:32:12,361 --> 01:32:14,071
Why do you remain in this house?

1221
01:32:14,154 --> 01:32:15,364
We're not dead!

1222
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:16,698
We're not dead!

1223
01:32:16,782 --> 01:32:19,576
We're not dead!

1224
01:32:19,743 --> 01:32:22,704
Why do you remain in this house?

1225
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:26,500
We're not dead.
We're not dead.

1226
01:32:26,666 --> 01:32:31,046
- We're not dead!
- We're not dead!

1227
01:32:32,214 --> 01:32:33,965
We're not dead!

1228
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:51,775
Are you all right?

1229
01:32:51,858 --> 01:32:57,697
Yes. Just a bit dizzy,
that's all.

1230
01:32:57,781 --> 01:32:59,574
What happened?

1231
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:02,786
They made contact.

1232
01:33:02,869 --> 01:33:04,371
All three?

1233
01:33:04,454 --> 01:33:07,416
Apparently, yes.

1234
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:11,211
The mother
and the two children.

1235
01:33:11,294 --> 01:33:12,921
Quite interesting,
don't you think?

1236
01:33:13,004 --> 01:33:14,923
Interesting?

1237
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,758
I was scared out of my wits!

1238
01:33:16,842 --> 01:33:18,260
Darling, calm down.

1239
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:21,304
No. So far, we have handled
this matter your way...

1240
01:33:21,388 --> 01:33:22,973
but now you listen to me.

1241
01:33:23,056 --> 01:33:25,475
We can't possibly stay
in this house any longer.

1242
01:33:25,559 --> 01:33:28,937
It is quite clear these beings
do not want us to live here.

1243
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,564
We don't know anything
about them yet.

1244
01:33:30,647 --> 01:33:32,482
Yes, we do!

1245
01:33:32,566 --> 01:33:34,234
We know the woman went mad...

1246
01:33:34,317 --> 01:33:37,112
smothered her two children,
and then shot herself.

1247
01:33:37,195 --> 01:33:40,365
That's quite enough.
Think of our son.

1248
01:33:40,449 --> 01:33:42,159
There's nothing wrong
with Victor.

1249
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:45,036
Yes, there is!
He has nightmares.

1250
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,955
He says he has seen that girl...

1251
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:49,374
and even this lady
has been possessed by her.

1252
01:33:49,458 --> 01:33:52,377
Please,
let us leave this house.

1253
01:33:52,461 --> 01:33:53,753
All right.

1254
01:33:53,837 --> 01:33:57,048
We will leave tomorrow morning.

1255
01:33:57,215 --> 01:33:59,634
Oh, thank God for that.

1256
01:34:01,011 --> 01:34:03,305
I'll just go
and check on Victor.

1257
01:34:06,433 --> 01:34:08,477
Once again,
thank you so much for coming.

1258
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,769
A pleasure.

1259
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:11,688
I hope we've been of some help.

1260
01:34:11,771 --> 01:34:14,774
Oh, yes, of course.
Though I must admit...

1261
01:34:18,361 --> 01:34:21,740
At first,
I couldn't understand...

1262
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:25,869
what the pillow
was doing in my hands...

1263
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:31,458
or why you didn't move.

1264
01:34:35,212 --> 01:34:37,464
But then I knew.

1265
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:42,302
It had happened.

1266
01:34:46,056 --> 01:34:48,683
I had killed my children.

1267
01:34:54,731 --> 01:34:57,275
I got the rifle.

1268
01:34:58,985 --> 01:35:01,279
I put it to my forehead.

1269
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:07,702
Then I pulled the trigger.

1270
01:35:11,456 --> 01:35:13,708
Nothing.

1271
01:35:20,382 --> 01:35:25,220
Then I heard your laughter
in the bedroom.

1272
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:29,766
You were playing
with the pillows...

1273
01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:32,269
as if nothing had happened.

1274
01:35:33,853 --> 01:35:40,986
And I thought
the Lord in His great mercy...

1275
01:35:41,069 --> 01:35:46,950
was giving me another chance...

1276
01:35:47,033 --> 01:35:51,538
telling me, don't give up.

1277
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:56,293
Be strong.

1278
01:35:58,086 --> 01:35:59,838
Be a good mother.

1279
01:36:02,215 --> 01:36:03,633
For them.

1280
01:36:07,721 --> 01:36:09,889
But now...

1281
01:36:12,851 --> 01:36:14,436
now...

1282
01:36:17,856 --> 01:36:19,858
what does all this mean?

1283
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:25,822
Where are we?

1284
01:36:27,741 --> 01:36:30,285
Young Lydia
said the very same thing...

1285
01:36:30,368 --> 01:36:33,872
when she realized
the three of us were dead.

1286
01:36:35,248 --> 01:36:38,376
And that was the last time
she ever spoke.

1287
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:43,298
But I couldn't tell you
that before now.

1288
01:36:47,844 --> 01:36:51,348
Shall I make us
a nice cup of tea, ma'am?

1289
01:36:55,268 --> 01:36:57,312
The intruders are leaving...

1290
01:36:57,395 --> 01:36:59,689
but others will come.

1291
01:36:59,773 --> 01:37:01,775
Now, sometimes we'll sense them.

1292
01:37:01,858 --> 01:37:05,403
Other times, we won't.

1293
01:37:05,487 --> 01:37:08,823
But that's the way
it's always been.

1294
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:12,118
Ma'am.

1295
01:37:16,373 --> 01:37:18,958
Mummy...

1296
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:21,378
Daddy died in the war,
didn't he?

1297
01:37:21,461 --> 01:37:22,962
Yes.

1298
01:37:23,046 --> 01:37:24,756
Will we ever see him again?

1299
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:27,759
I don't know.

1300
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:32,639
If we're dead, where's limbo?

1301
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:39,604
I don't know
if there even is a limbo.

1302
01:37:41,773 --> 01:37:44,651
I'm no wiser than you are.

1303
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:49,864
But I do know that I love you.

1304
01:37:51,074 --> 01:37:53,785
I've always loved you.

1305
01:37:56,579 --> 01:37:59,582
And this house is ours.

1306
01:38:01,209 --> 01:38:04,337
You say it with me.

1307
01:38:04,421 --> 01:38:05,672
This house is ours.

1308
01:38:05,755 --> 01:38:07,215
This house is ours.

1309
01:38:07,298 --> 01:38:09,467
This house is ours.

1310
01:38:30,113 --> 01:38:33,616
Mummy, look.
It doesn't hurt any more.

1311
01:38:44,502 --> 01:38:47,464
No one can make us
leave this house.

1312
01:39:13,448 --> 01:39:15,241
Come along, Victor.
