1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,131
My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,409
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,404
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,370
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,810
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,006
...but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,728
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,844
That day is today.

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,931
What?

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,321
No Big Belly Burger?

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,841
It's one of the few perks
of living in this time.

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,931
We're out of cows where I come from. You
don't care about that. You have questions.

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,084
I'm not sure where to start.

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,407
Thawne.

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,204
That is your real name?

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,368
- Eobard Thawne?
- Since the day I was born.

17
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,291
- When was that?
- One hundred and thirty-six years from now.

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,727
This is not what you wanna know.

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,568
Go ahead, Barry.

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,127
Ask it.

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,450
Why did you kill my mother?

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,406
Because I hate you.

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,087
Not you now.

24
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,520
You years from now.

25
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,286
- In the future.
- In a future, yes.

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,762
We're enemies, rivals, opposites.
Reverses of one another.

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,564
Why? Why were enemies?

28
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,285
It doesn't matter.

29
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,964
It doesn't matter anymore.

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,091
What matters is neither of us
was strong enough to defeat the other.

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,120
Until I learned your secret.

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,721
I learned your name.

33
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,400
Barry Allen.

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,491
And finally, I knew how to defeat you
once and for all.

35
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,325
Travel back in time, kill you as a child...

36
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,360
...wipe you from the face of the earth.

37
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,329
But then you, future you, that is,
followed me back and we fought.

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,291
We both landed some pretty solid shots.

39
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,166
And then you, future you,
got your younger self out of there.

40
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,766
I was so mad.

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,602
But then I thought...

42
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,882
...what if you were to suffer a tragedy?

43
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,201
What if you were to suffer something
so horrible, so traumatic...

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,126
...that your child self could never recover?
Then you would not become the Flash.

45
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,044
So I stabbed your mother in the heart.

46
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,367
And I was free.

47
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,284
Finally able to return to a future
without the Flash.

48
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,486
Only to realize that in traveling back,
I lost my way home.

49
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,929
Lost my ability to harness the Speed Force.

50
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,048
And without it,
I was stuck here, stranded in this time...

51
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,889
...unable to return to my home,
and the only one way back was the Flash.

52
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,927
But the Flash was gone,
and so I created him.

53
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,931
Why train me?

54
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,004
Why help me save so many people?

55
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,090
Because I needed you to get fast.

56
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,011
Fast enough to rupture the space-time
barrier and create a stable Wormhole...

57
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,089
...through which I could return home.

58
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,605
Why would I ever do that?

59
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,889
Because, Barry Allen...

60
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,765
...if you give me what I want...

61
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,689
...I'm gonna give you what you want.

62
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,481
You can go back and save your mother.

63
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,129
You can prevent your father
from going to prison.

64
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,603
You can reunite the Allen family.

65
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,405
No.

66
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,085
No, I don't believe you.

67
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,761
I wanna kill you right now.

68
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,121
I know that rage.

69
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,091
I used to feel that rage
every time I looked upon you.

70
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,481
And now somehow...

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,771
...I know what Joe and Henry feel...

72
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,888
...when they look on you with pride.

73
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,446
With love.

74
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,486
No. No, don't you ever say that to me.

75
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,122
I know you're upset,
but I'm giving you a chance.

76
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,963
I'm giving you a chance
to undo all the evil I've done.

77
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,001
Don't you want that chance?

78
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,687
A rare opportunity to go back in time
and right a wrong...

79
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,241
...and save your mother's life.

80
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,323
Quite the paradox
Harrison has presented you with, Mr. Allen.

81
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,000
The chance to be with someone you love?

82
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,844
Seems pretty cut-and-dry to me.

83
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:13,844
At first blush, Dr. Snow, it would appear
so, but this gift has unparalleled risk.

84
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,208
Barry, the night your mother died...

85
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,330
...the night you saved yourself
from being killed...

86
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,731
...that event altered the timeline you were
already on, and changed the course of history.

87
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,646
So, what you're saying is
we're living in a parallel universe?

88
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,323
- Just like when I time-traveled before.
- But he only changed one day that time.

89
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,726
Exactly. Now imagine 15 years
of compounded experiences.

90
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,522
One different decision, no matter how big
or small, impacts everything that follows.

91
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,850
Moments upon moments,
choices upon choices, new relationships.

92
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,602
Nothing would be as it is today,
and you'd never know the difference...

93
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,724
...because you'd never remember any of it.

94
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:05,121
So if I go back and save my mom,
my dad doesn't go to prison.

95
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,408
I never live with Joe and Iris.

96
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,851
You might never meet me
or Caitlin or Ronnie.

97
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,087
Truth is...

98
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,721
...there's no real way of knowing
what your life will be.

99
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,366
There's no choice here, Barry.
You have to do this.

100
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,767
You gotta change the past.

101
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,450
Joe.

102
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,286
So, what, that's it?

103
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,603
You think I should just do it?

104
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,724
Yeah, I do.

105
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,010
Which means
I will never come to live with you...

106
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,685
...and you're okay with that?

107
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,402
Barry, you get the chance to grow up
with both parents.

108
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,571
- You don't have to grow up without a mother.
- What about growing up without a father?

109
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,445
You will have a father. Your real father.

110
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,964
Wells has messed with our lives
long enough.

111
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,283
This is why you became the Flash, Barry.

112
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,404
To put things right.

113
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,483
You saved a lot of people's lives
this past year.

114
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,328
Now it's time to save yours.

115
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,331
Dad, look, I know this sounds crazy.

116
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,847
I think we're way past crazy, slugger.

117
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,289
Look, you're fast, I get it,
but turning back time...

118
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,771
I wouldn't be turning time back.
I would be going back.

119
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,765
To that night, to save her.

120
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,044
What does Joe think about all this?

121
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,885
He thinks I should do it.

122
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,247
No.

123
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,046
You can't.

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,490
Dad...

125
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,167
I can make it so
that night will never have happened.

126
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,051
- We'll be a family again.
- We are a family.

127
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,485
Not like this, not without Mom.

128
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,765
Barry, there's a natural order to things.

129
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,281
Okay, things happen the way they do.

130
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,166
We may not know why at the time,
but there must always be a reason.

131
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,887
Now, I believe that.
I've had to believe it.

132
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,483
L... I can save Mom.

133
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,846
At what cost?

134
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,491
You said time would change.
What if it changes you?

135
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,722
- Well, I don't care.
- I do.

136
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,250
I am in awe...

137
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,764
...of the remarkable man
that you are becoming.

138
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,363
All the things you've achieved,
and not just as the Flash...

139
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,891
...but you, Barry...

140
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,890
...your honesty, your heart.

141
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,210
You were always a hero.

142
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,602
And your mom would be just as proud.

143
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,730
And if she had a say in this,
if she thought for one second...

144
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,766
...you going back to save her would mean
you losing what makes you so special...

145
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,962
...she would never want that.

146
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,362
Barry, what I hope for you...

147
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,603
...maybe the greatest thing
that a father can hope for his son...

148
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,249
...is that one day
you will become a father yourself.

149
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,049
And then you will know...

150
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,408
...how much I truly love you.

151
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,126
Ninety-eight-point-six.

152
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,367
Normal.

153
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,131
- Don't know what that word means anymore.
- Me neither.

154
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,168
I know Barry really appreciates you
coming back to help him stop Wells.

155
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,801
That's not the only reason I'm back, Cait.

156
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,570
I'm here now, for good.

157
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,922
- But I thought...
- I thought too.

158
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,011
Okay, I thought too much about what might
happen if the government tracked us down.

159
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,810
If we couldn't control our powers
and we hurt someone, if we hurt you.

160
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,445
But I realized that, although
sometimes, I'm more than one man...

161
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,646
...I'm not whole unless I'm with you.

162
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,921
I love you, Cait.

163
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,528
- Are you sure?
- I am.

164
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,205
Once upon a time...

165
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,370
...and a particle accelerator or so ago...

166
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,806
...you agreed to marry me.

167
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,971
- Yes, I did.
- What do you say we do that?

168
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,565
Thought I might find you here.

169
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,841
I needed to get out of the lab.

170
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,402
I thought this would be
a good place to think.

171
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,244
Oh, it is, trust me.

172
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,690
I've done a lot of thinking up here.

173
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,965
When I wasn't having clandestine meetings
with the mysterious Streak.

174
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,046
Yeah, not mad we lost that name.

175
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,244
Hey, I thought that had pizzazz.

176
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,245
No.

177
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,171
So are you gonna do it?

178
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,843
It's just so huge.

179
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,401
It's the biggest decision of my life,
and if I'm wrong, I can't undo it.

180
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,841
Why would you want to? I mean...

181
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,846
...you'd get to see your mom again...

182
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,127
...your dad.

183
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,203
Have a great career.

184
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,605
Even get married.

185
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,802
Iris West-Allen, huh?

186
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,964
I never really thought of myself
as a hyphenator.

187
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,647
Must be a 2024 thing.

188
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,284
We don't know that
that's gonna happen. I mean...

189
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,521
Do you think that
because you didn't live with us...

190
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,246
...that's why things are different there?

191
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,045
Growing up together
and knowing so much about each other...

192
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,530
...it made it hard for me
to admit how I felt about you.

193
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,645
And I waited too long,
and you fell in love with Eddie.

194
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,926
But...

195
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,440
But living with you and Joe...

196
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,323
I've had a great life, Iris.

197
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,687
Come here, Barry.

198
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,524
What do you think I should do?

199
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,042
I need someone to tell me.

200
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,967
I think...

201
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,289
...that for once in your
life, Barry Allen...

202
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,841
...you should stop thinking
about other people.

203
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,204
I think you should do what's in your heart.

204
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,371
Do what you need to do for yourself.

205
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,007
Ah.

206
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,883
Well, if it makes you feel any better...

207
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,289
...it took you a whole hour longer
to decide than I thought it would.

208
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,324
So how does this work?

209
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,686
- Your grand plan.
- Well, it's really not that grand at all, Barry.

210
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,330
In fact, it's rather simple.

211
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,410
- We use the particle accelerator.
- The particle acce...

212
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,889
The last time that happened, you caused
an explosion that hurt a lot of people.

213
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,001
This time, the accelerator will operate
exactly the way it was designed to.

214
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,171
Except instead of two particles
moving in opposite directions...

215
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,891
...colliding at the speed of light
in the inner ring...

216
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,362
...we're only gonna inject one particle
into the accelerator.

217
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,649
And I'm what it collides with.

218
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,922
And if you can go fast enough, Barry...

219
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,930
...if you can hit that particle
with enough speed...

220
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,010
...you will punch a hole
right through the fabric of reality.

221
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,845
And you will create a portal...

222
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,011
...connecting this time...
to infinite times.

223
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,886
A Wormhole.

224
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,726
Through which one might travel
back to the past...

225
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,723
...say, to the night your mother died,
or forward to the future to, say, my time.

226
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,761
You said if I run fast enough.
What happens if I don't?

227
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,123
If you don't achieve
the desired velocity, Barry...

228
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,244
...you'll die.

229
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,043
According to Wells' calculations...

230
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,965
...Barry super-speeds
inside the accelerator ring.

231
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,487
Once Barry reaches optimum speed...

232
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,122
...we then launch a hydrogen proton
into the accelerator.

233
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,569
Once the collision happens,
a Wormhole forms...

234
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,521
...opening a gateway into time itself.

235
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,050
At that moment, I plan on shouting
something along the lines of:

236
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,168
"Eureka," or possibly, "Excelsior."

237
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,442
I'm uncommitted.

238
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,047
What do you think?

239
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,564
I mean, on the one hand,
it does make a kind of sense.

240
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,087
On the other hand...

241
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,527
...why?

242
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,087
Why?

243
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,688
- Why would you ever consider doing this?
- You know why.

244
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,326
So for this to work,
how fast would Barry have to go?

245
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,166
By my estimates, Mach 2 at a minimum.

246
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,688
You've never gone that fast.

247
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,844
So, what happens
if Barry doesn't reach that speed?

248
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,288
I mean, I'm imagining a bug
hitting a windshield. How far off am I?

249
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,724
Not very far, I'm afraid.

250
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,526
Let me worry about how fast I have to go.

251
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,921
- We're gonna need something else too.
- Really?

252
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,646
And what's that?
Because I don't know about you guys...

253
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,202
...but I'm not at all interested in
helping you get yourself killed.

254
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,209
I need you to build a time machine.

255
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,880
Go on.

256
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,205
So if Wells is as fast as you,
what's he need a time machine for?

257
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,880
Apparently, he lost his speed
when he killed my morn.

258
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,562
He gets it back sometimes, but only
in spurts. He can't fully control it.

259
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,405
I was right. He was using
the wheelchair to charge himself.

260
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,009
So after I open the wormhole, he's gonna
need the ship to travel back to the future.

261
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,881
- He's been squirreling away the parts.
- Now we just need to put it together.

262
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,090
Ronnie, I love you,
but this is a time machine...

263
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,765
...not a bookcase from lkea.

264
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,089
We got a problem.
These tiles, they're made of tungsten.

265
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,130
Tungsten has the highest
melting point of any other element.

266
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,760
Yeah, uh, but the dust it generates
is flammable.

267
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,400
- The pressure exerted from the wormhole...
- Yeah, yeah.

268
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,643
It could cause a hole
to be melted into the exterior.

269
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,086
It could explode.

270
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,601
Any ideas?

271
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,607
Let me ask Dr. Evil.

272
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,128
Heh. Which used to be a name
that made me smile.

273
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,442
- Something on your mind, Cisco?
- No.

274
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,447
Yes. How did you fit your Reverse-Flash
suit into that little ring?

275
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,847
Is it some sort of compressed microtech?

276
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,124
Or... Actually, forget it. I don't care.

277
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,450
Maybe a little.

278
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,167
Ronnie's right. I should've accounted
for temporal shearing.

279
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,482
Glad we're still good for something.

280
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,963
I've never underestimated
your contribution, Cisco.

281
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,321
Or Ronnie. As a matter of fact,
do you know how many times...

282
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,171
...I wished you were with me
as I rebuilt the accelerator?

283
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,169
- Would've been a lot more fun.
- Yeah?

284
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,486
Well, it doesn't change the fact
that your nifty little Time Sphere...

285
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,684
- Oh, is that what you're calling it?
- Whatever. It's gonna blow.

286
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,121
Not if you cement the tiles
with a cobalt resin.

287
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,369
That'll prevent degradation
in conditions of extreme heat.

288
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,685
Okay. Fine, we'll try that.

289
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,331
That's it? That's all?

290
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,124
Well, what do you want me to say?

291
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,166
I don't know. I thought of anyone, you'd be
more understanding of my predicament.

292
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,163
I don't belong here.

293
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,244
These barbaric times.

294
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,689
- It's like living among the dead.
- Is that what you told yourself...

295
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,251
...when you killed me?

296
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,444
What?

297
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,841
What did you say?

298
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,004
It was an alternate timeline,
one that Barry reset.

299
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,446
But I never forgot it.

300
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,851
It just kept coming back to me.

301
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,928
And I can still picture
the way you looked at me...

302
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,571
...when you called me a son.

303
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,770
And you crushed my heart...

304
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,166
...with your fist.

305
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,723
Cisco...

306
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,211
...I'm sorry.

307
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,928
- Yeah, it sucked.
- Not for killing you. I'm sure I had a reason.

308
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,687
I'm sorry for the fact that you're able
to retain traces of another timeline.

309
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,686
You're able to see through
the vibrations of the universe. It means...

310
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,200
- I wasn't sure until just now.
- Sure of what?

311
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,725
The night the particle
accelerator exploded...

312
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,806
...you were affected too.

313
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,286
What are you talking about?

314
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,924
No.

315
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,081
I wasn't.

316
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,726
Don't be afraid, Cisco.

317
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,809
A great and honorable destiny
awaits you now.

318
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,449
I only hope that
as you're living your great adventure...

319
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,529
...that you remember who
gave you that life.

320
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,481
And that it was given out of love.

321
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,283
I'm sorry, but I'm told this is the only station
with enough power to run these calculations.

322
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,727
If we make a slight error
creating the wormhole...

323
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,804
Say no more. Joe told me
to stick around in case I was needed...

324
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,965
...but it seems I'm only in the way.
- Well, everyone has a contribution to make.

325
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,801
Perhaps you just haven't
discovered yours yet.

326
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,130
No, Dr. Wells made it pretty clear when he
told me about the future, I don't matter.

327
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,806
As far as history's concerned,
I don't save the day, or get the girl.

328
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,570
And you believed him?

329
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,771
He had a newspaper from the year 2024.

330
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,482
And I have a mug that says
"World's Best Boss."

331
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,801
I doubt my teaching assistant
would testify to its authenticity.

332
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:31,042
We're dealing with a lot
of big scientific ideas today.

333
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,408
But you, Mr. Thawne, might be...

334
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,843
...the most interesting thing here
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

335
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,010
Me?

336
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,090
What are the odds that
Dr. Wells would travel back in time...

337
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,844
...and get stuck in the exact same city
as his great-great-great-great-grandfather?

338
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,924
Working in the same profession,
the same building.

339
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,204
And that part of his plan to get home
would mean...

340
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,365
...that he'd have to preserve
and protect your life.

341
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:04,522
That makes you this rare thing
that no scientist can plan for.

342
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,411
- Which is?
- Coincidence.

343
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,647
There is no science to coincidence.

344
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,248
You, sir, are an anomaly.

345
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,563
A wildcard, as it were.

346
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,967
You are the only person in this whole story
who gets to choose his own future.

347
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,202
At least that's my opinion.

348
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,927
Wait, that can't be right. Oh, dear.

349
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,246
We have a problem.

350
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,120
- What?
- The calculations.

351
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,771
There is a danger.

352
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,891
- I know. I'm ready to take the risk.
- No, not just to you, but to everyone.

353
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,410
Wells didn't tell us everything.

354
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,769
Barry, even if you do
reach the right speed...

355
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,922
...colliding with the hydrogen particle...

356
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,085
...there is a chance that explosion
could create a singularity.

357
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,250
- What's a singularity?
- It's a black hole.

358
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,603
- We could destroy Central City.
- For starters.

359
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,691
If we create a singularity here
and then cannot control it...

360
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,606
...we could be looking at
a global catastrophe.

361
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,971
So long, and thanks for all the fish.

362
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,045
Sure, there's a bit of a risk.

363
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,524
I would hardly refer to possibly causing an
extinction-level event as "a bit of a risk."

364
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,725
And your accelerator's been about as reliable
as the beater I drove in high school.

365
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,882
Ha, ha. Let me ask you a question.

366
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,608
How many metahumans,
how many dangers...

367
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,043
...have we faced this year together?

368
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,529
Or did you forget that was me fighting
alongside each and every one of you?

369
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,770
I have been planning this
for almost two decades. It will work.

370
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,567
How do we make sure we don't open
a black hole in the middle of Central City?

371
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,802
So once the wormhole stabilizes...

372
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,480
...Barry will have
one minute and 52 seconds...

373
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,843
...to alter the past and
return to this time.

374
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,004
If and when he does that,
you can close the Wormhole...

375
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,202
...and we can all live happily ever after.

376
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,640
Almost two minutes.

377
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,803
More than enough time to save Nora.

378
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,606
But not time enough to stop you
from going home?

379
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,001
Everything 's a choice-

380
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,489
- And what if I'm late?
- You won't be.

381
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,923
I believe in you, Barry. Always have.

382
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,842
So I guess the question is, do your friends
and family believe in you as much as I do?

383
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:52,530
So if I don't run fast enough to collide
with the particle, then I'm dust.

384
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,126
If I run fast enough
but I'm not back here in time...

385
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,648
...a black hole will form, swallow
up the city, and possibly the world.

386
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,806
Sure you still wanna look me in the eyes
and tell me that this is for the best?

387
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,129
I'd be lying if I told you I did.

388
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,123
Truth is I don't... I don't
know what to think.

389
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,601
I thought you were the sure one. I...

390
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,081
I was kind of banking on that
when I made my decision the first time.

391
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,721
I was faking it.

392
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,684
- Yeah.
- Sometimes parents do that.

393
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,566
Most of the time, parents do that.

394
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,680
Look, of course I'm scared.

395
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,891
But I didn't want you to not help your
mother because you were worried about me.

396
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,130
Well, I'll always worry about you, Joe,
just like you'll always worry about me.

397
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,367
Sorry, but you can't stop that.

398
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,010
Do you think I can do this?

399
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,881
Do you think I can save my mom?
I mean, do you think I'm fast enough?

400
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,366
Yes.

401
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,447
I know you are.

402
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,809
You know, I've dreamed my whole life...

403
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,047
...about saving her, freeing my dad, and...

404
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,891
I never thought I'd have to lose
another parent to do that.

405
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,042
- Barry...
- Joe, it's true. it's...

406
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,685
It's true.

407
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,843
I've always been so focused
on everything that I lost that night.

408
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,487
But I gained so much too. I...

409
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,040
I was born with one father,
and that tragedy gave me...

410
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,725
...another.

411
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,488
And I don't think I can lose you.

412
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,561
You will never lose me.

413
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,406
Ever. You hear me?

414
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,650
Even

415
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,004
Wow, slow news day?

416
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,807
If they only knew, right?

417
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,250
I thought you would be at S.T.A.R. Labs.

418
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,051
I was.

419
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,925
But I got hungry, so I went to Mama Chow's.

420
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,049
For dim sum? Your favorite?

421
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,690
- And to remind myself of something.
- What?

422
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,127
A coincidence.
A pretty big coincidence, actually.

423
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,242
About a year and a half ago,
I had a date with this girl.

424
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,210
Katie Rogers.

425
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,243
She was a dancer.

426
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,000
We had plans to meet at Mama Chow's...

427
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,283
...but she texted me,
she pulled a hamstring and had to cancel.

428
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,448
Oh, those fragile dancers.

429
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,406
I was bummed
because I was looking forward to it.

430
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,723
So I had dinner by myself,
and I was walking home...

431
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,202
...when I saw a mugger
running with a stolen backpack.

432
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,405
Your backpack.

433
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,409
And I arrested him.

434
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,050
That's how you and I met.

435
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,481
I remember.

436
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,730
Someone just told me
how powerful a coincidence could be.

437
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,570
And it made me realize...

438
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,321
...how many coincidences had to happen
for you and I to get together.

439
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,169
In this time.

440
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:25,805
We've all been so focused on Barry's
destiny, I forgot that I have one too.

441
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,608
And it's you...

442
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,285
...lris West.

443
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,686
Every moment of my life led to meeting you.

444
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,525
Screw the future.

445
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,921
Screw the future.

446
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,603
Is this actually binding?

447
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,885
My father made me become a rabbi
before he would send me to MIT.

448
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,923
This will be legit, as the kids say.

449
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,809
No kids say that.

450
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,964
- Let's not fight on our wedding day.
- Okay.

451
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,044
If it's all right with everyone,
I'd like to skip all the Hebrew.

452
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:24,003
I've learned a lot about merging one's life
with another this past year.

453
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,326
And yet for all the incredible advancements
in science we've all been party to...

454
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,609
...the mystery that brings two people
together through love...

455
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,963
...is still the province of magic.

456
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,367
Mr. Ramon, the rings, please.

457
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,370
- I owe you a real ring.
- I don't need one.

458
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,882
I have everything and everyone
that I could ever need right here.

459
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,003
And if all the events of the past year
have led us to this moment...

460
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,526
...it was worth it.

461
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,291
I love you, Ronnie.

462
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,481
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

463
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,367
Stop telling me what to do.

464
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,603
Okay, there are gonna be
three yous back there.

465
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,889
You from the future, who saved
younger you from the Reverse-Flash...

466
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,087
...and now "you" you.

467
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,921
Remember, wait until future you
gets younger you out of there...

468
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,323
...and then you can go and save your mom.
Piece of cake.

469
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,447
May the Speed Force be with you.

470
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,921
Goodbye, Dad.

471
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,761
Goodbye, son.

472
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,926
- Iris...
- You don't have to say anything.

473
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,481
I already know.

474
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,446
I hope whatever life you get,
it's enough for you...

475
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,282
...that it makes you happy.

476
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,771
You too.

477
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,440
Remember, Mr. Allen...

478
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,803
...assuming you achieve the proper velocity
and open the Wormhole...

479
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,164
...you will only have one minute and 52
seconds to save your mother and return.

480
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,688
Or else...
I know.

481
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,127
Well...

482
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,324
...you hold both our futures
in your hands now, Mr. Allen.

483
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,970
And I know you can do it.

484
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,165
Now...

485
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,681
...run, Barry.

486
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,804
Run.

487
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,845
The accelerator's structural integrity
is holding.

488
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,685
What was that?

489
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,848
- Is Barry okay?
- Yeah.

490
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,883
He just passed Mach 2.

491
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,522
I was waiting for you to bring Barry home.

492
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,365
Well, it looks like he's gonna
be staying with us a while.

493
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,286
Barry, what you're seeing
is the Speed Force.

494
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,730
Your past, your present, your future,
all at once.

495
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,521
So you need to focus
on where you want to go.

496
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,042
So think about that night.

497
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,202
Think about your mother.

498
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,370
It's time for bed. Good night, slugger.

499
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,369
Mom.

500
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,971
- Mom!
- Barry, no!

501
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,571
Mom!
It's working.

502
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,891
It's working.

503
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,565
Inject the hydrogen particle now.

504
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,441
- What's that? What happened?
- Barry, he's gone.

505
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,045
- Look.
- The Wormhole.

506
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,328
And it's stable. Start the clock.

507
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,769
Mom!

508
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,921
_MOrn!
'Barw! Barry!

509
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,525
MQfn!

510
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,283
Barry, get back! No!

511
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,090
Nora, hold on!

512
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,285
Run!

513
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,007
Run!

514
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,611
Barry!

515
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,444
No!

516
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,807
No! No!

517
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,803
No!

518
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,241
No!

519
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,561
H9)'-

520
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,280
- it's okay, it's okay. You're okay.
- Please.

521
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,084
My husband, my son, are they...?

522
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,321
They're okay.

523
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,807
They're both safe. I promise.

524
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,481
Who are you?

525
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,484
I'm...

526
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,284
I'm the Flash.

527
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,730
I don't understand.

528
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,409
You look just like my father.

529
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,526
This won't make any sense...

530
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,409
...but it's me, Mom.

531
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,726
What?

532
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,566
It's Barry.

533
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,609
- Barry?
- Your Barry.

534
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,966
My beautiful boy.

535
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,126
I got a second chance...

536
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,761
...to come back here and...

537
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,891
To tell you that I'm okay.

538
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,723
Dad and I are both okay.

539
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,928
And we love you, Mom.

540
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,408
I love you.

541
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,923
I love you.

542
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,882
Oh, my sweet boy.

543
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,969
Good bye.

544
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,290
Goodbye, Barry.

545
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,284
Mom.

546
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,809
Mom.

547
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,405
Mom.

548
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,803
I believe it's time to say goodbye
to Harrison Wells.

549
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,969
It's beautiful.

550
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,565
Rip Hunter would be impressed.

551
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,962
He built the first one of these.

552
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,122
Interesting man.

553
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,486
Now what the hell is that?

554
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,281
That's my cue to leave.

555
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,081
Thank you, Cisco.

556
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,285
Don't ever come back.

557
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,365
Thirty seconds.

558
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,924
Home.

559
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,206
- Oh, my God.
- Barry.

560
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,886
We have to shut down the Wormhole.
Quickly!

561
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,204
Caitlin.

562
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,401
You didn't save her?

563
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,571
Why?

564
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,884
Why? You could have had
the life you wanted.

565
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,406
You could have had everything
you ever wanted!

566
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,884
I already do.

567
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,202
Not for long.

568
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,771
Cut the internal generators.

569
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,403
Ten seconds. Hurry.

570
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,568
Three, two, one.

571
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,805
Ronnie, are you okay?

572
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,287
- Did you do it?
- Yes, I turned them all off.

573
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,290
They did it. They cut the generator.

574
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,841
Just so we're clear...

575
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,004
...after I kill you, I'm
going to kill them.

576
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,607
And then I'm going to kill your father.

577
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,922
I always win, Flash.

578
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,324
Aah! Eddie! on, my...!

579
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,441
Eddie!

580
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,647
What did you do?

581
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,606
What did you do? What did you do?

582
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,322
No such thing as a coincidence.

583
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,367
- What's happening?
- Cisco, help me.

584
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,121
Eddie's his ancestor.

585
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,766
If Eddie dies, he'll never be born, and...

586
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,810
He's being erased from existence.

587
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,801
No!

588
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,968
No! Eddie.

589
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,326
Eddie? No, don't.

590
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,324
Ed, stay with me, okay? Stay...

591
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:46,050
He was wrong. Turns out
I'm a hero after all.

592
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,851
You are, Eddie. You are my hero.

593
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,162
That's all I ever wanted to be.

594
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,328
Your hero.

595
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,365
I've controlled your
life for so long, Barry.

596
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,450
How will you get along without me?

597
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,249
Guys, that's not good.

598
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,240
Professor, I shut down the Wormhole.
What's happening?

599
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,450
I don't know. You did close it,
but it seems to be reopening.

600
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,206
- We gotta go.
- You okay?

601
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,926
- Iris, we have to go.
- I'm not leaving him.

602
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,043
- We have to go now, honey, I'm sorry.
- Come on.

603
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,242
So that's what we didn't want to happen.

604
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,169
- What's it doing?
- Feeding.

605
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,086
The singularity won't stop,
not even after the Earth is gone.

606
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,686
I'm afraid the accretion disc
has already assembled.

607
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,763
- What?
- Diffused material...

608
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,281
...that's in orbital motion
around the singularity.

609
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,960
- What does that mean?
- We have to disrupt the motion.

610
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:58,603
Basically, it's just like the tornado,
only upside down and bigger.

611
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,802
- And scarier.
- Barry...

612
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,010
...that event has an energy level
of at least 6.7 teraelectron-volts.

613
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,281
It cannot be stopped.

614
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,846
I have to try.

615
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,241
Oh, God. Barry.
