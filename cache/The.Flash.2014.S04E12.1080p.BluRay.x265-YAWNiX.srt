1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:06,246
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,208
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:12,169
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,754
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,090
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

6
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,930
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

7
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,058
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

8
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:25,932
<i>And I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,143
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

10
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,062
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

11
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,738
<i>The court
orders that Mr. Allen</i>

12
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,737
<i>should be remanded
to Iron Heights Penitentiary.</i>

13
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,910
- Get comfortable.
<i>- I didn't kill anybody.</i>

14
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:41,330
Yeah, sure. Everyone's innocent here.
Especially that guy. Big Sir.

15
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,373
Twelve markers, twelve metas.

16
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,543
Now that we know how many there are,
we can go right to them.

17
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,461
- I don't want any trouble.
- Too late.

18
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,426
Thanks. I was just wondering
why you helped me.

19
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,969
<i>Because your dad helped me.</i>

20
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,008
He operated and saved my life.

21
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,226
Cecile, are you sure
we even need a crib?

22
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,519
I used to plop Iris on some cushions
and call it a night.

23
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,725
Well, I'm glad to hear
you got all your parenting mistakes

24
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:09,900
out of the way with your first kid.

25
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,070
I think she turned out pretty good.

26
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:16,069
Oh, babe. I cannot believe
I'm so big already.

27
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,572
You know, I was barely
showing at this point with Joanie.

28
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,654
All right, best I got.
What do you think?

29
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,659
Mmm-hmm.

30
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,416
- Are they?
- Are they what?

31
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,243
- Too tight?
- Um...

32
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,579
Hey, you just said that
you thought my clothes are too tight.

33
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:30,754
Do I look bad?

34
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:31,957
What? I didn't say that.

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,002
What do you mean,
"When is it gonna go back to normal?"

36
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,798
I didn't say that either.

37
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,343
Look at me.

38
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,476
- My lips aren't moving.
- What are you talking about?

39
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:48,807
I heard you. I...

40
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,649
- I can still hear you.
- What the hell is going on?

41
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,783
Why can I hear what you're thinking?

42
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,198
Oh, my God. Joe.

43
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,077
I think I can read minds.

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,456
Heart rate's 170 bpm,

45
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,792
and there's no sign of
dark matter in the amniotic fluid.

46
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,589
So the baby's not a meta?

47
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,420
Nope, it's a perfectly normal baby...

48
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,175
"Girl." You were gonna say
"baby girl."

49
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,311
- I'm having another daughter?
- I'm gonna have a sister.

50
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,307
Well, I guess we can
cancel the announcement party.

51
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,318
Boy, girl, that's 50/50.

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,896
Let's test your skills for real.

53
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,402
What number am I thinking of?

54
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,657
Three. Eleven. Twenty-five.

55
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,825
Three again. Bulbasaur.

56
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,957
What the hell is a Bulbasaur?

57
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,408
So weird.

58
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,415
Why would I be thinking about
PokÃ©mon at a time like this?

59
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,043
- Yep. Definitely a telepath.
- But how?

60
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:57,918
If the baby is not a meta, then
where did these powers come from?

61
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,510
Nope, I wasn't on the bus.

62
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,550
No, I was not abducted by aliens.

63
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:05,391
No, I didn't inherit
a mystic totem from my grandma.

64
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,764
Really, guys? Why are you
still thinking about Bulbasaur?

65
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,766
- 'Cause he's the cutest one of all.
- Okay.

66
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,347
My best hypothesis is

67
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,603
this is actually triggered by
your latest phase of pregnancy

68
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:17,278
and it's actually latent dark matter
that's been in your brain since

69
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,401
maybe the first
particle accelerator explosion.

70
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,153
Think of it like
gestational diabetes.

71
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,109
But it's not.
You can fix that with insulin.

72
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,569
Right, but it's temporary.

73
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,448
I mean, the symptoms
should recede after childbirth.

74
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,449
Hmm.

75
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,002
Okay, we'll give you guys a minute.

76
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:38,041
Joe, you're literally thinking,
"I'm worried about Cecile."

77
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,882
I just want you
and the baby to be okay.

78
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,216
I know.

79
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:46,007
But, hey, maybe this will
turn out to be a good thing.

80
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,143
I've always wondered
what goes on in that head of yours.

81
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,309
<i>Cecile's a telepath.</i>

82
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:55,107
Well, that's way more important
than getting Allen out of prison.

83
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,067
- Not!
- Sick burn, Har.

84
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,144
Please don't encourage him.

85
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,854
Yeah, as a former prisoner,

86
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,486
- I can tell you...
- No, that was gorilla prison.

87
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,817
Gorilla prison is worse.

88
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,117
They throw their scat at you.

89
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,492
I can tell you that Allen is sitting
in his cell suffering while...

90
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,912
this guy, DeVoe,
continues his plan unabated.

91
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,039
Harry, Cecile
filed an appeal last week.

92
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,041
We have no new evidence,
so that doesn't matter.

93
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,167
We have satellites on the DeVoes.

94
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,249
And they haven't made a move
in weeks, so that doesn't matter.

95
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,708
Well, Barry is in gen pop,

96
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,294
so worst case, he can always
phase out or I can breach him out.

97
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,378
Then he'd be a fugitive.

98
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,965
And by the way, Ramon, why do we not
have eyes on him in there?

99
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,801
Hey, it's a pain trying to get
into an analog camera from here,

100
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:33,104
- no matter how hard I hack.
- Hack harder.

101
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,432
We're nowhere.

102
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,976
This team is nowhere
and this is the team

103
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,186
that got Barry out of
a pan-temporal speed prison

104
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,317
and we can't
spring him from a county jail?

105
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,865
Harry, we are working
just as hard as you. Okay?

106
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,236
And, yes, it kills me to admit it,
but we are at a roadblock.

107
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,158
So Barry is just gonna have to...

108
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,365
Hold on.

109
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,166
I mean, I can't even imagine
what he's going through.

110
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,966
Read 'em and weep, boys.

111
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,418
That's it.

112
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,381
I'm dealing next round.

113
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,136
You know, there's
something fishy about you, Allen.

114
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,344
I'm fishy?
You tried to murder me and Joe.

115
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,895
Well, if you can't play cards with
somebody who tried to murder you,

116
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,438
you'll never play cards in here.

117
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,266
Knew I'd regret
inviting you to this game.

118
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,275
You may be big,
but you got no poker face.

119
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:22,299
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

120
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,231
- Deuces again.
- Okay, I'm out.

121
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,950
- Hey, you can't take that.
- It's my last pudding.

122
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,153
Then you shouldn't have
thrown it in the pot, dumbass.

123
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,664
Dumbass?

124
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,333
A politician who gets caught
with his pants down.

125
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,999
Yeah, I'd say you're a dumbass.

126
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,547
Well, maybe
I'll just take the whole pot then.

127
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,590
- Guys, come on.
- Don't screw with me, Bellows.

128
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,799
Or what? You gonna shoot me?

129
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,387
That's right.
You only shoot unarmed men.

130
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,953
What the hell are you looking at?

131
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,698
Is that really why you're in here?

132
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,331
You shot an unarmed man?

133
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,957
Yeah, I'm just another bad guy.
Now get the hell out.

134
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,832
If my dad really risked his life
to save yours, then...

135
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,838
I doubt you're just another bad guy.

136
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,635
Hey, why don't you just tell me
what really happened?

137
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,953
<i>"A suspect was arrested last night
after a botched robbery.</i>

138
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,115
<i>"While attempting to steal
from a Mercury Labs shipping crate,</i>

139
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,747
<i>"David P. Ratchet, alias Big Sir,</i>

140
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,169
<i>"allegedly shot
and killed a security guard.</i>

141
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,459
<i>"An eyewitness
called in the shooting."</i>

142
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,387
"Ratchet was
previously arrested for fighting."

143
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,058
The only forensic evidence
were bullet casings from the scene

144
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,975
that matched the cartridge of a gun
you owned.

145
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,803
Okay, time to go.

146
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,810
Hey, firearm identification like that
can have errors.

147
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,436
It's practically junk science.

148
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,519
I said, time to go.

149
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,355
You didn't kill that guy, did you?

150
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,819
There was another guy.

151
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,410
<i>He was my size, my frame.</i>

152
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,705
<i>I heard the shots,
I tried to save the guard.</i>

153
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,789
<i>Wrong place, wrong time.</i>

154
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,677
- Why didn't you just tell me that?
- 'Cause it doesn't matter, Allen.

155
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,173
It didn't matter to the cops.

156
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,347
Not to my lawyer or the jury.

157
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,676
They took one look at me
and decided I was the guy.

158
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,220
That guy could still be out there.

159
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,430
If I was that guy,

160
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,642
I would have ditched this crap town
a long time ago.

161
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,236
Central City loves her heroes.

162
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,362
And I should know,
I'm your new mayor.

163
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,115
But we all agree,
doing business in a city

164
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,821
with meta-humans
can be a little risky.

165
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,575
Technology companies in Central City
are robbed at nearly 30 times

166
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,910
the national average.

167
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,916
That's second
only to Star City, folks.

168
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,499
Which is why I'm proud to unveil

169
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:15,837
Kord Industries' newest
advanced research facility.

170
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,969
Designed to be the most
secure building of its kind.

171
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,350
Complete with
super-speed motion detectors,

172
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:26,272
sonic vibration defenses
and laser beams that don't freeze.

173
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,143
Believe me, no one is breaking into
this building anytime soon.

174
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,654
I hate this city.

175
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,810
Cecile. Hey, babe,
what are you doing here?

176
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,558
I needed a helper

177
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,018
- and, well, she wanted to help.
- Yeah.

178
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,276
Cisco said you were working a case
about an R&D lab that vanished.

179
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,699
I figured maybe I could help
dig up some clues,

180
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:19,946
now that I'm a meta.

181
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,493
Babe, you're not a meta.

182
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,455
I can hear every one of these people.

183
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,829
Dark matter
definitely left its mark here.

184
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:28,955
I figured as much.

185
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,245
That patrolman, right there.

186
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,039
He is cheating on his wife.

187
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,751
Ah...
Never trust a mustache, I always say.

188
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:37,881
I have a mustache.

189
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,088
No, you have a sexy goatee.

190
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,422
He has a creeper mustache.

191
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,677
Red tie.

192
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:47,182
Oh, baby, red tie does not like his boss
very much.

193
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,229
She's been doing this
all the way over here.

194
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,807
- Mmm.
- And that lady right there. Joe...

195
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,434
Joe, she is a thief.

196
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,360
Thief!

197
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:56,858
Staplers.

198
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,484
She's been stealing them
out of her office for months now.

199
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,032
She damn near
cleaned out the supply closet.

200
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,325
Baby, I love you

201
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,575
and I think it's great that
you have these new powers, but I...

202
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,621
Oh. You want me to go.

203
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,199
I don't want you to go.

204
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,909
No, no, no. It's just 'cause
you wanna do your job.

205
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,710
I totally get it. Go. Stop crime.

206
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,252
- Love you.
- Love you.

207
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,668
I can hear everyone. It's so fun.

208
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:23,964
Hey.

209
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,597
The closest security cam I can find
is from an ATM across the street.

210
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,223
The footage is choppy, but...

211
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,439
Look at that.

212
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,563
- Did he just...
- Pull a Chevelle out of nowhere.

213
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,895
I'm gonna run those plates.
See if I can get an ID on the dude.

214
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,855
Copy that.

215
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,281
Yes, I'll accept the charges.

216
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,283
Hey, Barry.

217
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,489
So Barry asked you to ask us
to get this guy out of prison?

218
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,700
Barry has gotten close to this guy
who says he's innocent.

219
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,409
It was a case of mistaken identity.

220
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,542
Well, from what I could
find out on CCPN's archives,

221
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,999
Big Sir's case
does sound a bit suspect.

222
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:01,302
Fifteen years ago, he was
found guilty of shooting a guard,

223
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,549
but there was no apparent motive.

224
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,847
- Only one eyewitness?
- Mmm.

225
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,765
Studies have shown that

226
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,808
line-up composition,
verbal and non-verbal cues

227
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,262
can all lead to
unintended false identifications.

228
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:16,021
Look, this is all just fantastic,
but we're not really gonna do this.

229
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,193
Yeah, I mean,
we've already got a lot on our plate

230
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,770
just trying to free one innocent man.

231
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,025
We all want Barry to be free,

232
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,858
but I don't know that there's
much else we can do right now.

233
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,074
We kinda hit a wall.

234
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,948
We're not gonna get through that wall
while we are working on this.

235
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,324
It's just one case.

236
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,406
Yeah, and it's a case
that we have to take.

237
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,952
Allen has made one request of us
since he's been incarcerated.

238
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,877
A request
that doesn't even involve himself.

239
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,629
We have to take this case.

240
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,708
It's unsettling
how convincing you can be sometimes.

241
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,634
I got a plate match on the Chevelle.

242
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,302
It's registered to a perp who has

243
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,631
multiple
breaking and entering priors.

244
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,391
"Sylbert Rundine."

245
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,352
Why does every villain in this city

246
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,179
have a name that sounds like
it came out of a comic book?

247
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,685
He must go by something for short.

248
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,357
Syl. Sylbie.

249
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,311
- Bertie.
- What do we wanna do about this case?

250
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,447
Well, my dad, Cisco and Ralph
are gonna question Rundine

251
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,195
and I'm gonna call Cecile and see

252
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,072
if she can pull up
the case file on Big Sir.

253
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,070
You won't even have to say it.

254
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,329
"Bertie"? Are you for real with that?

255
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,373
Yeah.
I bet you five bucks it's Bertie.

256
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:14,825
You're on.

257
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,585
Hey.

258
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,465
Allen, you're stirring up my dust.

259
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,838
Oh, sorry.

260
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,469
Um, I've got some news.

261
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,799
So I have some friends that I thought
could help with your case

262
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,348
- and they've agreed to do it.
- CCPD cop friends?

263
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,683
Not exactly.

264
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,766
But, um, if there's anybody
that can prove you innocent,

265
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,896
it's these guys.

266
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,727
'Cause they did
a bang-up job of clearing you.

267
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,729
That's not really...

268
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,234
- I mean, my case...
- Look,

269
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,946
just call them and tell them to stop.

270
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,699
I don't understand
why you're not excited about this.

271
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,290
What you're peddling, it's dangerous.

272
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,959
- What's dangerous?
- Hope.

273
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,332
I've been in here long enough
to understand that in prison,

274
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,463
hope is the most dangerous thing.

275
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,212
Wait. Did you get that
from <i>Shawshank?</i>

276
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,632
No, I got that from being in prison.

277
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,561
Tell your friends
to stop wasting their time.

278
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,947
Sylbert Rundine?

279
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,949
It's the CCPD.

280
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,954
- You Sylbert Rundine?
- Bert.

281
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,575
"Rundine." The "E" is silent.

282
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,164
So close.

283
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,504
I'm Detective Joe West.
These are my associates.

284
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,377
We're looking into a robbery
that took place.

285
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,799
Wanted to ask you some questions.

286
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,088
Okay.

287
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,338
- Do you own a 1970 Chevelle?
- Well, I used to.

288
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,638
Oh, my glob.

289
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,885
Is that a replica of DARPA's HTV-3X?

290
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,344
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

291
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,684
Don't you know not to
mess with another man's toys?

292
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,015
You mean "figurines."

293
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,104
Yes.

294
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,061
Yes, he does.

295
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:06,686
Wow.

296
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,905
This is a perfect replica.

297
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:12,075
It even has a tiny automatic
navigation control system.

298
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,324
This is the reason
I don't have any money in my savings.

299
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,997
- Oh, I get it.
- Is this you?

300
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,208
Yeah, hard to believe.

301
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,995
Fifteen years ago,
I was a bit of a gym rat.

302
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,208
Hey, Joe.

303
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,332
It's a pretty nice figurine.

304
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,510
Well, gentlemen,
I was just about to head out.

305
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,713
So, if you guys are good here...

306
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,933
Fifteen years ago, did you spend
any time around Mercury Labs?

307
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,955
Cisco, get us to the alley.

308
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,243
Damn.

309
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,044
He wasn't that quick, was he?

310
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,963
You guys check down there.
I'll check the streets.

311
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,039
Okay.

312
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,843
Guys, he's here!

313
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:14,717
Hey, hold it right there.

314
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,059
Oh, that feels weird.

315
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,687
Joe, he's getting away!

316
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,102
I think we got bigger problems.

317
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:39,113
- This is...
- Ridiculous.

318
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,826
You okay, guys?

319
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,126
Are we doing okay? Are we doing okay?

320
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,920
Does it look like we're doing okay?
We're two inches tall, Caitlin!

321
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,715
Yeah, I'm like Cisco-size now.
Is this always how you see the world?

322
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,917
Oh, that's really funny, man.

323
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,627
I guess your body
just finally shrunk down

324
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,054
to a size that's proportional
to your brain!

325
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,013
Ralph, have you tried just
stretching back to normal size?

326
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:01,927
Uh...

327
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,765
Oh, my back! Geez Louise.

328
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,021
Okay, you know what?
Maybe I can breach us out of here.

329
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,576
Really thought
I was gonna go further than that.

330
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,782
How many fingers am I holding up?

331
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,371
What fingers?

332
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,537
You're no less annoying at that size.

333
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,623
Hey, guys. I think I got something.

334
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,083
So, I wasn't able to pin
Ray Palmer or the <i>Waverider,</i>

335
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,089
but I was able to reach Felicity.

336
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,926
So, Ray uses dwarf star alloy

337
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:41,099
to power the shrinking capabilities
in the A.T.O.M. suit.

338
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,346
But on October 10th,

339
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,519
Palmer Tech's
last depository of alloy

340
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,141
was stolen from
Central City's facility.

341
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,645
October 10th, that's the day
Barry came out of the Speed Force.

342
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,771
So he hits the facility,
then he hops on the bus.

343
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,399
So, a dwarf star alloy
plus dark matter

344
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,152
equals Rundine's shrinking powers?

345
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,780
Not exactly.
Nature doesn't work to scale.

346
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,031
If the human body were to shrink,
we can't lift our skeleton.

347
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,159
So Rundine's power
must be able to shrink

348
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,785
the space between atomic bonds.

349
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,958
Miniaturize tech, so you can steal it

350
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,161
and then make it big
so you can sell it.

351
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,878
- Hey.
- Hey.

352
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,172
Ratchet's trial records.

353
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,248
Oh.

354
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,003
You really think the guy
who shrunk that building

355
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,006
is the same guy
we need to free Barry's friend?

356
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,467
Well... I mean, look.

357
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:21,632
Be easy to mistake them, right?

358
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,183
I mean, they certainly
had a resemblance.

359
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:27,058
Rundine hit up the warehouse a month
after they picked up Big Sir.

360
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,140
Still, that's a big coincidence.

361
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,691
I keep saying it. There is no
coincidences when it comes to DeVoe

362
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,018
and that includes Barry's cellmate.

363
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,774
Well, I can't sell that to a judge.

364
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,488
So, if we wanna get Big Sir out,

365
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:39,487
we're gonna need
a confession from Dr. Shrinker.

366
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,738
Dwarfstar!

367
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,285
What the hell is that?

368
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,408
Well, that's what I'm naming him.
See, "Dwarfstar."

369
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,534
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

370
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,037
Oh, it takes a lot of time
to breach here.

371
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,161
Who spit gum on the floor?

372
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,463
I'm a gumshoe!

373
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,040
Not gum on a shoe!

374
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,625
Oh, my God. Get him off, get him off!

375
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,512
Ugh.

376
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,972
You guys are
going in the hamster cage.

377
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,301
Ugh. Hamster cage?

378
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,760
Don't drop me! Don't drop me!

379
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,477
Harry, this is not your fault.

380
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,981
Yeah, well, it kinda...

381
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:21,025
Don't read my mind, okay?
What am I thinking now?

382
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,610
- Oh, God.
- Great.

383
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,490
Now, if you'll excuse me,

384
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,039
I'm gonna go build a
reverse polarity dwarf star matrix.

385
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,115
Great name, Ray Palmer.

386
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,544
Was "electron-degenerate
sub-atomizer" taken?

387
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:34,746
Electron...

388
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,218
Oh, you have no idea
what Harry was talking about.

389
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,263
Or what anyone
around here is ever talking about.

390
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,633
- I gotta call Barry.
- Okay.

391
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:53,770
I can hear you, Iris, and there is
nothing wrong with me and Joe.

392
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,816
Right. Yes. Totally.

393
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,487
It's just that if you ever,
you know, think

394
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,689
there is something wrong,

395
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,116
I know someone who could help.
That's all.

396
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,908
I'm Dr. Sharon Finkel.

397
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,955
Thank you for
seeing us on short notice.

398
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,829
- Lucky us.
- Of course.

399
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,961
The reason that we're here today is

400
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:19,007
I've been experiencing some
unusual pregnancy symptoms.

401
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,504
You know,
the first time I was pregnant,

402
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,835
it was a really long time ago,

403
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,716
and things were very different
at that point.

404
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:27,550
Eggs, bread, olive oil.
I'm sorry, are you...

405
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,726
Are you making a grocery list?

406
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,768
Of course not. I would not...

407
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:39,357
So, tell me more about
the symptoms you're experiencing.

408
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:43,824
It's almost as if I have become

409
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,277
aware of Joe's thoughts.

410
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,950
- Like I read his diary.
- My diary?

411
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,407
Your pregnancy
made you read Joe's diary?

412
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,912
What do you mean,
you're taking his side?

413
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,209
I don't take sides.

414
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,253
You just think that I'm in the wrong.

415
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,293
- I would never think...
- Maybe this was a bad idea.

416
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,712
No, no. No, babe,
we're not done here.

417
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,627
Therapy scares you
and you don't like this woman

418
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,921
- hearing all your business.
- Cecile... That's not true.

419
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,223
And now you just wanna go, you think
this whole thing is a waste of time.

420
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,382
Cecile, stop.

421
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,265
You're thinking about
a pink elephant over and over?

422
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,180
You're trying to block me out.

423
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,189
Can I just ask one question?

424
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,772
Really, a pink elephant?

425
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,112
Why are you hiding
your thoughts from me?

426
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:23,905
Because you're making me do it.

427
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,118
Cecile, when we got back together,
I promised you

428
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,328
that I would never keep any secrets
from you again.

429
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:34,791
Except now, it feels like I have to.

430
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,332
Hey, they found him.

431
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,630
His name is Sylbert Rundine,
he's been arrested

432
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,344
for a whole bunch of crimes
like yours.

433
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:48,722
And he used to look
just like you, too.

434
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,382
You're getting out of here.

435
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,467
Wow, you have a hard shoulder.

436
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,637
So yesterday
I tell you what happened,

437
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,684
and today you find the guy.

438
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,349
- That happened in a...
- "Flash"?

439
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,896
- Snap.
- Snap.

440
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,481
You cops and your blinders.

441
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,229
Probably got the wrong guy again.

442
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:08,363
Well, technically they haven't
gotten him yet.

443
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:11,115
You see? Something always goes wrong.

444
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,329
Why do you have to make this so hard?

445
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,666
It's okay to believe.

446
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:17,951
Yeah?

447
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,666
Why it is so easy for you to believe?

448
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,709
You know my dad was in here
for a crime he didn't commit, right?

449
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,171
Do you know what happened?

450
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,382
After 17 years,

451
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,764
the man that killed my mom confessed.

452
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,179
My dad got to go home.

453
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,265
Why shouldn't you get
to go home, too?

454
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:39,814
Seventeen years, huh?

455
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,897
You think they'll catch Rundine?

456
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:45,691
You really think it's gonna happen?

457
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,028
I promise. You're getting out.

458
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,947
So, in hindsight, I can see

459
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,413
how putting you guys in
a hamster cage could be humiliating.

460
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,918
- You think?
- Sorry for that.

461
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,792
For the record, this is awesome,

462
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,798
but why do you guys
have a giant LEGO set anyway?

463
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,255
It is a three-dimensional model
of the place

464
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,011
where I was predestined
to be brutally murdered

465
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,963
by a twisted future version of Barry.

466
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,840
That guy.

467
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,844
But what a difference a year makes.

468
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,225
What did you do to my bazooka?

469
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,854
Well, I turned your bazooka
into an embiggening bazooka,

470
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,354
with the help of the dwarf star alloy

471
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:25,981
we stole from Rundine's apartment

472
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,776
and improving upon
Ray Palmer's amateurish schematics.

473
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,402
Presto chango.

474
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:31,825
Embiggening bazooka.

475
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:34,153
Now, if you'll just hold on...

476
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,112
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
We're gonna do this now?

477
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,702
Well, yeah. Rundine's in the wind.

478
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,367
These two are small,
we need to embiggen them,

479
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,248
- and we need to free an innocent man.
- Okay, first of all,

480
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,416
"embiggen" is not a word,
and second of all,

481
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,081
shouldn't we test this first?

482
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,708
Hey!

483
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,667
I'll be a test subject. Come on.

484
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,961
- Take me.
- Sure, why not.

485
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,298
That's the spirit. Here we go.

486
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,802
And...

487
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,261
- West. You should probably...
- Mmm?

488
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,891
Oh, God, yeah, sorry.

489
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,103
And three, two, one.

490
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,444
Nope. Still tiny.

491
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,327
Hey, are we supposed to be
doing that?

492
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,536
- Oh, no.
- Their cells are exploding.

493
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:26,747
Whatever that embiggening gun did
to Ralph and Cisco

494
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,003
seems to have destabilized them
on an atomic level.

495
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,792
- How long do they have?
- At this rate,

496
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,879
I would guess, complete
cellular explosion within 10 hours.

497
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,609
You know, man, prison pudding is
so much better than outside pudding.

498
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,398
Obviously.

499
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:51,772
Any news from your friends?

500
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,909
Um, no, not yet, but they're probably
just busy tracking Rundine.

501
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,237
A seasoned criminal like that
knows how to not be found, you know.

502
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,866
Yeah, I get it, man.

503
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,324
Hey, um...

504
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,080
Do you have any plans
for when you get out?

505
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,162
No, I really haven't thought about it
very much.

506
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:10,381
Oh, come on, you've gotta
have something that you've dreamed of.

507
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:14,006
Like opening a business or climbing
to the top of Mount Everest.

508
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,179
- Bungee-jumping.
- This ain't the movies, Allen.

509
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,473
This is real life, man.

510
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:21,643
Reality is, I ain't got nobody
or nothing

511
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,265
waiting for me on the outside.

512
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,805
Even if I do get out,

513
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,647
I'll probably end up
at the docks anyway.

514
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,017
Okay, look. I spent most of my life
in love with a girl

515
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,694
who was way out of my league.
Now she's my wife.

516
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,693
Sometimes things do end up
like in the movies.

517
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,488
Jiaju.

518
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,783
- Come again?
- Jiaju.

519
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,956
Tiny village in China.
Beautiful place.

520
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,994
Very secluded.
Monks all take a vow of silence.

521
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,587
Inmate Allen.

522
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,169
- A word?
- Yeah.

523
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,091
I see you've made a new friend.

524
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,507
Yeah, I guess I have.

525
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,263
I find that interesting.

526
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,681
Especially since I was just asked

527
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,938
to turn over inmate Ratchet's
case file to the DA

528
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,643
who represented you for your trial.

529
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,354
Coincidence?

530
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:13,149
Not everyone that's in here
deserves to be in here.

531
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,777
Have you ever heard
the name Aaron Miller?

532
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,524
No.

533
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,987
Miller was a prisoner here who took
to studying at the law library.

534
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:25,577
One day, Mr. Miller decided
to take on the appeal

535
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,159
of a fellow inmate's case.

536
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:31,170
When he was
invariably unsuccessful

537
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,084
that fellow inmate

538
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,166
stabbed Mr. Miller to death.

539
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,296
Your friend may look like a man,

540
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,592
but he is unquestionably a monster.

541
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,393
Everyone here is a monster.

542
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,771
And if you insist on continuing
to bait them,

543
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,356
I guarantee you,

544
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,858
you will get mauled.

545
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:59,615
- All right, coming in hot.
- Oh, hey, you don't have to do all that.

546
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,406
Listen, I did not inherit
my dad's skills in the kitchen,

547
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,037
but a decaf herbal tea,
that I can do.

548
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:08,287
So, if it's okay with you,
I just was wondering

549
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,619
if I could talk to you about Joe.

550
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,255
Um, yeah, of course it's okay.

551
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,298
Oh, no, honey, it's not about that.

552
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:19,628
We have zero problems
in that department, as you can tell.

553
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,838
Okay.

554
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:23,798
TMI. But okay.

555
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,225
I really thought
being able to read his mind

556
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,145
would make our relationship stronger,
not push us apart.

557
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:32,975
Well, how does my dad feel
about your new powers?

558
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,435
He thinks it's gonna take
a little getting used to.

559
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,486
Yeah, but how does he feel?

560
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,731
Look, we all know that my dad thinks

561
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,613
that he's this cool, grounded
man of mystery.

562
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,319
But we all know
that he's actually just...

563
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,746
A big softy.

564
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:49,290
But if you really want to get closer
to my dad,

565
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,369
you need to stop focusing
on what he's thinking

566
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,249
and find out what he's feeling.

567
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,300
Maybe we could use
a biochemical treatment

568
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,593
and target the pituitary glands,

569
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,715
flood them
with human growth hormones?

570
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,421
No, that would
just accelerate their...

571
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,757
It'll make things worse.

572
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,225
- Guys?
- What?

573
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:09,477
- Guys?
- Yeah.

574
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,433
- Guys?
- What?

575
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,776
Little Ralphy needs to use
the little boy's room.

576
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,523
Didn't you just go?

577
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,990
My bladder is literally the size
of a hummingbird's right now.

578
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,650
Come on, Caitlin.

579
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,401
Help a wee fellow take a wee-wee.

580
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,736
- Can you...
- Me?

581
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,246
I'm not touching it.

582
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,413
Fine. I'll take you there, but you
have to find your own way out.

583
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:36,833
- Thank you.
- Could've just gone in the bushes.

584
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,460
Gross.

585
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,675
The embiggening bazooka
made us unstable, didn't it?

586
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,849
Yeah. No! What? No!

587
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,679
Why would you say that?

588
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,511
I can see it all over your face.

589
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,479
- What?
- Your face is huge.

590
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,773
I'm watching your emotions on IMAX.

591
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,562
Yeah. Yeah.

592
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,527
This was supposed to be an easy W,
all right?

593
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:02,230
An easy victory. All we had to do
was capture Rundine.

594
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,610
Couldn't even do that for Allen.

595
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:07,364
- Okay, so you tried.
- Yeah, I failed. Because I'm stupid.

596
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,037
All right?
Too stupid to help Allen's friend,

597
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,410
too stupid to fix you,
or too stupid to stop DeVoe.

598
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,834
Ow! What was that for?

599
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,628
Believe me,
I'd punch you in the arm if I could.

600
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,167
Look, I know you're not used
to going up against

601
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,048
someone you can't outsmart
like DeVoe,

602
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:27,847
but you really are stupid
if you think you're too stupid.

603
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,637
You wanna help Barry?
You wanna free him?

604
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,220
Get out of your own way
and un-shrink us.

605
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,555
You weren't shrunk, all right?
That's not how his powers work.

606
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:36,810
His powers...

607
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:42,486
work by not just
removing the space between the atoms,

608
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,279
but also taking out
the gravity particles

609
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:47,404
and the dark energy so that
when he embiggens an object...

610
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,737
He's refilling it with
the same combination of energy

611
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:52,163
- he extracted.
- Yes.

612
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,992
- Harry, if you wanna fix us...
- We need to put you back

613
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,826
in Rundine's line of fire.

614
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:02,215
Central City's Weather
Services Agency

615
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,543
is always on the cutting edge
of radar technology.

616
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,678
Which is why I'm so excited
to show you the newest addition

617
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,096
to our stationary airship fleet.

618
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,511
Now, let's go take a closer look.

619
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,942
What do you mean we only have
20 minutes until we explode?

620
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,065
Actually, it's only 18 minutes

621
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,317
before your equilibrium
totally destabilizes.

622
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,862
You're gonna blow up
in under 20 minutes

623
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,534
unless we re-expose you
to Rundine's energy blast, okay?

624
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,361
Okay, so facial recognition
just picked him up

625
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,448
at Weather Services Airfield.
I think he's trying to skip town.

626
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,620
Okay, I'm gonna stay here
and try to figure out a cure.

627
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,872
Hey, sir, you need to leave.
The museum is closing for the day.

628
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,422
I know.

629
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:46,255
I just thought this would look great
on my shelf.

630
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,755
Red alert! Red alert!
Everyone, evacuate!

631
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,510
- Gotta go faster, gotta go faster.
- Do you wanna drive this thing?

632
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:59,431
Kinda do. Ramon! Remember, when
Rundine tries to shrink the van,

633
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,266
you've got to get in the path
of his blast. You understand?

634
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,603
Copy that!
We're heading into the hangar now.

635
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:12,319
- Uh, guys, I think he sees us.
- You're not getting big again.

636
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,337
I'll go left, you go right.

637
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,843
Harry, try and flank him.
We're gonna come around the other side.

638
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:38,178
Copy that.

639
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,390
Evasive maneuvers!
Evasive maneuvers!

640
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:42,473
I know. I'm doin' it.

641
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,732
Oh, boy.

642
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,106
We've got to figure out
how to get him to fire at us.

643
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:55,737
Abort!

644
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,616
We're falling too fast.

645
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,700
Think light thoughts.

646
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,002
I'm thinking
how you nearly got us killed.

647
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,204
Think lighter.

648
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,081
Snow!

649
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,337
<i>- Tell me you got something.</i>
- The cure's not done yet.

650
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:10,877
Only one minute
until the boys go nuclear.

651
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,254
- I don't wanna explode.
- What do we do?

652
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,181
We go to Plan B.

653
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:32,316
I'm gonna shrink you down
to the subatomic level, boy.

654
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:33,775
Oh, is that right?

655
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,203
I'd like to see you try.

656
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,181
I'm big again. I'm big again!

657
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:05,770
Remind me to never again breach into
any of Harry's stank-ass pockets.

658
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,852
Hey. Sorry again about stepping on you.

659
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,524
Hey, you saved me a trip
to the chiropractor.

660
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:12,776
I guess so.

661
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:14,656
You did it.

662
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,617
Yeah, I guess I did.

663
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,783
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say

664
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,956
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

665
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,241
You have the right to an attorney.

666
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,496
If you cannot afford one,

667
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,873
one will be provided for you.
Hands behind your back.

668
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:29,588
Rundine.

669
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,591
Fifteen years ago,

670
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,920
did you rob a Mercury Labs warehouse?

671
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,845
Give us a confession now,

672
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,470
I guarantee the DA
will cut you a deal.

673
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:41,684
Mercury Labs.

674
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,559
That's the one
that Ratchet got fingered for.

675
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,561
I laughed so hard
when that guy got arrested.

676
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,439
You want a confession?

677
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,358
Find a priest.

678
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,484
I'd rather rot.

679
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,294
Yeah, all right, thanks.

680
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,462
Hey, Joe, just hold on a second,
all right?

681
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,100
Ain't good news, is it?

682
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,555
Rundine won't confess.

683
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,398
My friends tried everything.

684
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,314
I mean, the DA offered
every deal she could, but...

685
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,111
I'm so sorry, man...

686
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,275
Look, you were right about everything
in here.

687
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:42,328
You know, I made you a promise and...

688
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:44,993
I let you down.

689
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,583
You damn idiot.

690
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,753
You did not let me down.

691
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,877
I forgot what hope felt like.

692
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:57,593
It's not a bad thing.

693
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,341
I'll see you around, kid.

694
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:14,022
Hey. Sorry.

695
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,353
It's okay, Barr.

696
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,822
<i>I just wanted to say thanks
for trying, you know.</i>

697
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,615
And I'm sorry
to send you on this goose chase.

698
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:23,069
Barry, that place you're in
is full of walls.

699
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:26,788
When you hit one of those walls,
you find a way to get through it.

700
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:28,874
<i>Don't lose your faith.</i>

701
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,122
<i>There's too many people
counting on you.</i>

702
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,874
<i>Out here and in there.</i>

703
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,001
Yeah.

704
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,101
Nope.

705
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,312
Nobody leaves
until we're both good again.

706
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:38,982
Okay.

707
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,282
What do you want from me, Cecile?

708
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:46,702
I want to know why me having
these powers is so upsetting to you.

709
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:47,869
You have the powers. Read my mind.

710
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,072
Uh-uh. No. No, no.

711
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,499
Me reading your thoughts
is what got us into all of this.

712
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:54,626
I want to know how you feel.

713
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:07,723
Cecile, you being able
to read my thoughts...

714
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,562
It makes me feel vulnerable
in a way that I don't like.

715
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:20,153
You being able to hear
every scared, dumb thought of mine,

716
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:23,690
I just don't want you
seeing me like that.

717
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,490
But I would never think less of you

718
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:26,734
for the thoughts
that cross your mind.

719
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,114
How could you not?

720
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,081
Okay.

721
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:37,253
Joe, your Grandma Esther's noodles,
they taste terrible.

722
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:38,708
Okay, they are terrible.

723
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,165
That woman had no business
ever messing with a wok.

724
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,420
Wow. Okay. Wow.

725
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,878
And I think that I've been using
semicolons wrong my entire life

726
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,304
which leads me to believe

727
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,803
that I don't even know
what a semicolon actually is.

728
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:53,261
Also, I would like to buy
a new pair of pants, 'cause...

729
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,437
But I haven't yet 'cause I'm afraid
to go into the store

730
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,934
'cause I think the salesperson
is gonna judge me

731
00:37:57,025 --> 00:38:00,439
because, truthfully, even I think
that I am just a little bit crazy

732
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,645
for having another baby at this age.

733
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:03,900
Oh, baby.

734
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:07,699
You are not crazy.

735
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:13,240
That speech you just gave
was a little, but you're not.

736
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:17,243
Those are my scared,
dumb, vulnerable thoughts.

737
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:19,624
You think any less of me?

738
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,755
- Of course not.
- Mmm-mmm.

739
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:27,378
Look, I can't promise you that
I'm gonna stop reading your mind.

740
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,927
I don't even really know
how this all works yet.

741
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,467
But I can promise you

742
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,554
that nothing you ever think
will change my opinion of you.

743
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,603
And even when you're not thinking it,

744
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:45,233
I know that you are
the brave, brilliant,

745
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,861
devastatingly handsome man
that I love.

746
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:51,319
And the one thought
I hear you have the most

747
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,950
is that you love me, too.

748
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,078
- And I do.
- Yeah.

749
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,088
Based on my scans,

750
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,512
Ralph and Cisco's cells
have re-formed and re-stabilized.

751
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,090
I can attest my bladder
is completely back to normal.

752
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:14,808
- Fourth Big Gulp today.
- Hmm.

753
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,519
I miss when we could just pick him up
and carry him out of the room.

754
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,721
Right?

755
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:22,104
Hey, you just passed up a dig
at Dibny. Sure you're all right?

756
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,152
You know, we reopen a case
against an innocent man

757
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,525
and, oh, somehow stumble upon
the actual culprit.

758
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,607
A culprit who, by the way,
has meta-human powers

759
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,863
that we are
partially responsible for...

760
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,161
It's like you said.
There are no coincidences

761
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,489
when it comes to DeVoe
and these bus metas.

762
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:39,041
What's DeVoe doing?
What's his motive?

763
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,452
Does he want
Sylbert Rundine incarcerated?

764
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,162
Or to have Big Sir set free?

765
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:45,418
Or for Cisco and I
to become itty-bitty meta-humans?

766
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,336
Well, whatever his plan is,
we'll figure it out.

767
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:52,672
And we're gonna stop him.

768
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:53,968
And bring Barry home.

769
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:56,350
And bring Barry home.

770
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:04,149
On your feet, inmate.

771
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,812
Is there a problem, Warden?

772
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:11,111
As you know, inmate Ratchet
mysteriously disappeared last night.

773
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,361
Where do you think he went?

774
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:14,368
Well, I couldn't say.

775
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:16,453
In an effort
to locate inmate Ratchet,

776
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,701
I reviewed
the security camera footage.

777
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:22,167
Did you know the oscillating cameras
aren't the only ones in this wing? Hmm?

778
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:26,080
Once you started stroking
inmate Ratchet's hopes of freedom,

779
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,086
I had a camera installed
right by your cell.

780
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:34,179
And when I checked that camera,

781
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,389
I learned who you truly are.

782
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:40,303
I don't know
what you're talking about.

783
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,183
Then let me be specific.

784
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,058
You're the Flash.

785
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,938
It's no use denying it
or trying to run.

786
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,693
You're clearly already showing
the effects of the drug cocktail

787
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,491
I put in that snack
you so seemed to enjoy.

788
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,079
Why?

789
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,455
Why would you do this?

790
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,081
I did warn you.

791
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:13,252
Everyone in here is a monster.

792
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,149
That'll be all.

793
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,456
You said to call you
when I was ready to do business.

794
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:50,256
Oh, hello, Warden.
Do you have another fish to sell me?

795
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,090
I do.

796
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:54,342
And it's a big one.

797
00:41:54,366 --> 00:42:02,366
