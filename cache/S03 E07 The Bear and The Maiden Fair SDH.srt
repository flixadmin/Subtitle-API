1
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:56,992
(Cawing)

2
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,172
Ygritte: How far are we?

3
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,132
About a week, I think.

4
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,550
You think?

5
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,135
You don't know?

6
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,847
Jon: When we went to castle black, we took
the king's road.

7
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,558
(Scoffs) You and your roads.

8
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,977
Is that how you lot do your fighting?

9
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,397
You march down the road
banging drums and waving banners?

10
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,191
Most of the time, yes.

11
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,444
How do the men holding the banners fight?

12
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,655
They don't, really.

13
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,908
It's a great honor to
carry your house sigil.

14
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,037
And the drummers...
Is that a great honor, too?

15
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,040
Usually it's the young boys
banging the drums.

16
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,833
So, what good are they?

17
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,627
They help the men march.

18
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,170
How?

19
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,922
Well, it's...

20
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,674
It's the rhythm.

21
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,051
Oh, you mean right foot, left foot,

22
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,428
right foot, left foot, right foot?

23
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:00,764
What, you need help remembering that?

24
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,102
When mance gives the signal
and we hit castle black,

25
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,105
we won't be banging
on drums to let them know we're coming.

26
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,753
No, you're just gonna
light the biggest fire

27
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,937
the north has ever seen
to let them know you're coming.

28
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,616
You know nothing, Jon snow.

29
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,830
Orell: She's right, you don't.

30
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,127
I know you cut me loose on the wall.

31
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,964
Cut her loose, too.
Do you see her squing about it?

32
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,801
That's because
she understands the way things are.

33
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,888
And are you gonna share it with me,

34
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,809
the deep wisdom you found
inside the head of a bird?

35
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,019
People work together when it suits them.

36
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,063
They're onal when it suits them.

37
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,566
They love each other when it suits them.

38
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,152
And they kill each
other when it suits them.

39
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,612
She knows that, you don't.

40
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,824
Which is why you'll never hold on to her.

41
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,673
(Thunder rumbling)

42
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,593
That rain will cost us another day.

43
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,930
Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.

44
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,183
Lord walder is prickly by nature. If...

45
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,393
"Prickly"? That what you call it?

46
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,687
Might be the least
pleasant man I've ever met.

47
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:31,897
Yes, and that is why...

48
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,942
I've seen wet shits
I liked better than walder frey.

49
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,281
Apologies, your grace.

50
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,785
I've spent too many years
around lancers and pikemen.

51
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:48,997
I've spent two years nursing wounded
men, watching them bleed and die.

52
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,541
I'm not afraid of wet shits.

53
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,126
(Laughing)

54
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,796
Lord frey will take this delay as a slight.

55
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,464
Edmure: He can take it as he likes.

56
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,549
He's getting the wedding he wanted.

57
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,218
He's getting a wedding.

58
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,761
It was a king he wanted.

59
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:07,724
Edmure is the best match a frey
has had in the history of their house.

60
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,060
We should all get some sleep.

61
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,287
(Talisa moaning)

62
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,861
(Chuckles)

63
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:12,956
(Exhales)

64
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,597
(Sighs)

65
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,600
If you don't put some clothes on,

66
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,560
I can't promise I won't attack you again.

67
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,562
Attack. Attack.

68
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,277
(Exhales)

69
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,866
(Grunts)

70
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,628
Robb: Who are you writing?

71
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,671
My mother.

72
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,841
Is that valyrian?

73
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,509
Gaaa.

74
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,720
"Gaaa"?

75
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,472
(Chuckles)

76
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,725
(Sighs)

77
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,771
Say hello for me.

78
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,981
Rytsas.

79
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:21,816
"Ritsas."

80
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,109
(Laughs)

81
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:24,986
That was close enough.

82
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,200
Does she know her daughter's a queen?

83
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,911
Not yet.

84
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,457
That will be a surprise, I expect.

85
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,795
Many surprises for her.

86
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,385
How am I supposed to
sit here planning a war

87
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,595
when you're over there, looking like that?

88
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,477
Will you come with me one day to volantis?

89
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,981
When all this is over?

90
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,399
I will.

91
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,193
I promise.

92
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,992
I know she'd love to meet you.

93
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,912
And her grandchild.

94
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,001
What, now?

95
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,967
Are you certain?

96
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,595
Are you angry with me?

97
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,848
Angry?

98
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,270
You're my queen.

99
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,360
And I have your
little prince or Princess inside me.

100
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,738
Maybe one of each.

101
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,574
- Don't get greedy.
- (Laughs)

102
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,619
(Sighs)

103
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,253
Can you leave the war for one night?

104
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,840
I love you.

105
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,093
Do you hear me?

106
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,221
I love you.

107
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,896
(Thunder rumbling)

108
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,564
(Horses neighing)

109
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,197
Tormund: Most men fuck like dogs.

110
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,991
(Grunting)

111
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:39,662
No grace, no skill.
A few dozen thrusts, and done.

112
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,791
You need to be patient. Give her time.

113
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,752
Your cock shouldn't go near her

114
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:48,421
till she's slick as a baby seal.

115
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,634
And then you go inside, but slowly.

116
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,805
Don'tjam it in like
you're spearing a pig. (Laughs)

117
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:57,972
Come on!

118
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,349
(Tormund laughing)

119
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,518
Hey, come on.

120
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,365
Orell: You think he loves you, is that it?

121
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:18,993
What did he tell you?
He's gonna make you his lady

122
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,371
and live with you in some castle?

123
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:25,291
No, he didn't tell me
anything. He barely talks.

124
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:29,879
I've seen you two whispering in the
night, giggling like a pair of girls.

125
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,798
What, you're jealous?

126
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,468
Of course I'm jealous.
You should be with one of your own.

127
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:39,347
And you're one of my own? I've never
heard a kind word from your mouth.

128
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,808
You would if you were mine.

129
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:50,984
I'd tell you that
you're beautiful and fierce and wild.

130
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,569
I'd be good to you.

131
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,073
You love him?

132
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,041
'Cause he's pretty? Is that it?

133
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,794
You like his pretty hair
and his pretty eyes?

134
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,315
You think pretty is gonna make you happy?

135
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,465
Don't touch me.

136
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,886
You won't love him so much
when you find out what he really is.

137
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,765
Sansa: Growing up at winterfell,

138
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,392
all I ever wanted was to escape,

139
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:28,771
to come here to the capital.

140
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,858
See the southern knights
and their painted armor

141
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,444
and king's landing after dark.

142
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,657
All the candles burning
in all those windows.

143
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,037
I'm stupid.

144
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:49,459
A stupid little girl
with stupid dreams who never learns.

145
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,793
Come on.

146
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,756
Come walk with me.

147
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:00,094
I remember the first time
I saw you in the throne room.

148
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:03,181
I'd never seen anyone
who looked so unhappy.

149
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:07,602
I want very much for you to be happy,
sansa, and so does my grandmother.

150
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,358
You would have been happy at highgarden,

151
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:17,278
but women in our position
must make the best of our circumstances.

152
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,950
How do I make the best
of my circumstances? I have to marry him.

153
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,080
Has lord Tyrion mistreated you?

154
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,041
Has he been kind to you?

155
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,460
He's tried.

156
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,671
You don't want him, though.

157
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,755
He's a Lannister.

158
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,549
Far from the worst Lannister,
wouldn't you say?

159
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:44,472
I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you...

160
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,849
My son will be king.

161
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,728
Sons learn from their
mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal.

162
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,399
And your son, if I'm not mistaken,

163
00:12:55,191 --> 00:13:00,071
your son might be the lord of casterly
rock and the north someday.

164
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,700
What?

165
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:06,995
My son...

166
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,122
With him.

167
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,543
I'll have to...

168
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,920
We'll have to...

169
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,797
If it's the pain you're worried about...

170
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,218
I'm not afraid of the
pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.

171
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,720
What is it, then?

172
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:30,685
He's rather good-looking, even
with the scar. Especially with the scar.

173
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,853
He's a dwarf.

174
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,856
And loras...

175
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,066
Loras.

176
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:44,324
Some women like tall men.
Some like short men.

177
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,951
Some like hairy men. Some like bald men.

178
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:51,414
Gentle men, rough men,
ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls.

179
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,376
Most women don't know
what they like until they've tried it.

180
00:13:55,752 --> 00:14:01,007
And, sadly, so many of us get to
try so little before we're old and gray.

181
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:07,597
Tyrion may surprise you. From what
I've heard, he's quite experienced.

182
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,809
And that's a good thing?

183
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,186
It can be.

184
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,564
We're very complicated,
you know. Pleasing us takes practice.

185
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,317
How do you know all this?

186
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,986
Did your mother teach you?

187
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,992
Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me.

188
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,373
Tyrion: She's a child.

189
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,957
Bronn: She's a foot taller than you.

190
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,626
A tall child.

191
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,003
What's the youngest you've ever had?

192
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,505
Not that young.

193
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,048
How much older?

194
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,592
Older.

195
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,970
You're a lord, she's a lady.

196
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:51,224
And a beauty, at that. I
don't see the problem.

197
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,393
Shae isn't going to like it.

198
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,269
Shae is a whore.

199
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,147
Are you gonna marry her, eh?

200
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,401
How did marrying
a whore work out for you the first time?

201
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,112
I should never have told you about that.

202
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:07,615
You want shae, keep her.
Wed one and bed the other.

203
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,660
All you have to do
is get a son in the stark girl.

204
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,495
He'll be lord of winterfell one day.

205
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,455
You can rule the north in his name.

206
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,583
You'll have two women
and a whole kingdom of your own.

207
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:21,629
Two women to despise me
and a whole kingdom to join them.

208
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,801
You waste time trying
to get people to love you,

209
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,512
you'll end up
the most popular dead man in town.

210
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,139
(Bronn chuckles)

211
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,268
You want to fuck that stark girl.

212
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:37,228
You just don't want to admit it.

213
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,732
I don't pay you to put
evil notions in my head.

214
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,986
The ones already there don't need company.

215
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,905
You pay me to kill people who bother you.

216
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,201
Evil notions come free.

217
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,811
(Door closes)

218
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,110
Your grace.

219
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,279
Grandfather.

220
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,365
You wanted to speak to me?

221
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,992
Yes.

222
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,621
I'd like a report on the
meetings of my small council.

223
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,207
You're welcome to attend the meetings

224
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,125
of your small council, your grace.

225
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,668
Any or all of them.

226
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,504
I've been very busy.

227
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,173
Many important matters
require a king's attention.

228
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,591
Of course.

229
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,887
You've been holding the council meetings

230
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,599
in the tower of the hand
instead of the small council chamber.

231
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,142
I have, yes.

232
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,354
May I ask why?

233
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,148
Well, the tower of the
hand is where I work.

234
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,318
To walk from there to here would take time,

235
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,279
time I could othennise spend productively.

236
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,657
So if I wanted to attend a council meeting,

237
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,661
I would now have to climb all
the stairs in the tower of the hand?

238
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,929
We could arrange to have you carried.

239
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:43,104
Tell me about the Targaryen girl
in the east and her dragons.

240
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,855
Where did you hear about this?

241
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:46,315
Is it true?

242
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,235
Apparently so.

243
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:55,283
Don't you think we ought
to do something about it?

244
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,913
When I was hand of
the king under your father's predecessor,

245
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:05,835
the skulls of all the Targaryen
dragons were kept in this room.

246
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:11,507
The skull of the last
of them was right here.

247
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,719
It was the size of an apple.

248
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,265
And the biggest was the size of a carriage.

249
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:24,395
Yes, and the creature
to whom it belonged died 300 years ago.

250
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:29,066
Curiosities on the far side of
the world are no threat to us.

251
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,653
But how do we know
these dragons are just curiosities

252
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,781
and not the beasts
that brought the whole world to heel?

253
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,743
Because we have been told
as much by the many experts

254
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,786
who serve the realm by counseling the king

255
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,913
on matters about which he knows nothing.

256
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,333
But I haven't been counseled.

257
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,836
You are being counseled
at this very moment.

258
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,883
I should be consulted about such things.

259
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,886
From now on, I will see to it that you are

260
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,555
appropriately consulted
on important matters

261
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,141
whenever necessary.

262
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,732
Your grace.

263
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,415
Yunkai. The yellow city.

264
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:35,800
Barristan: The yunkish train bed
slaves, not soldiers. We can defeat them.

265
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:40,596
On the field, with ease.
But they won't meet us on the field.

266
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,974
They have provisions,
Patience, and strong walls.

267
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,560
If they're wise, they'll
hide behind those walls

268
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,188
and chip away at us, man by man.

269
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,815
I don't want half my army killed

270
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,525
before I've crossed the narrow sea.

271
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,945
We don't need yunkai, khaleesi.

272
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,614
Taking this city will not bring you

273
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,908
any closer to Westeros or the iron throne.

274
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,663
How many slaves are there in yunkai?

275
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,500
200,000, if not more.

276
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,629
Then we have 200,000
reasons to take the city.

277
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,716
(In valyrian)

278
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,677
Send a man to the city gates.

279
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,140
Tell the slavers I will receive them here,
and accept their surrender.

280
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:29,562
Othennise, yunkai will suffer
the same fate as astapor.

281
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,161
(Drums beating)

282
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,858
Now comes the noble razdal mo eraz

283
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,611
of that ancient and honorable house,

284
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:04,657
master of men and speaker to
savages, to offer terms of peace.

285
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,659
(Dragons screeching)

286
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,411
Noble lord, you are in the presence

287
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,956
of Daenerys stormborn of house Targaryen,

288
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,333
queen of the andals and the first men,

289
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,752
khaleesi of the great grass sea,

290
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,713
breaker of chains, and mother of dragons.

291
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,134
You may approach. Sit.

292
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,813
Missandei: Will
the noble lord take refreshment?

293
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,234
(Water pouring)

294
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,494
Ancient and glorious is yunkai.

295
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:55,624
Our empire was old
before dragons stirred in old valyria.

296
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,003
Many an army has broken against our walls.

297
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,881
You shall find
no easy conquest here, khaleesi.

298
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,468
Daenerys: Good.

299
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,222
My unsullied need
practice. I was told to blood them early.

300
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:14,018
If blood is your desire, blood shall flow.

301
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,395
But why?

302
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:20,608
'Tis true you have
committed savageries in astapor,

303
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:24,111
but the yunkai
are a forgiving and generous people.

304
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,286
The wise masters of yunkai have
sent a gift for the silver queen.

305
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:41,629
There is far more than
this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.

306
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,757
- My ship?
- Yes, khaleesi.

307
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,885
As I said, we are a generous people.

308
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,304
You shall have as many
ships as you require.

309
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,348
And what do you ask in return?

310
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,852
All we ask
is that you make use of these ships.

311
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,480
Sail them back to
Westeros where you belong,

312
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,149
and leave us to conduct
our affairs in peace.

313
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,237
I have a gift for you as well.

314
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,615
Your life.

315
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,699
My life?

316
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,868
And the lives of your wise masters.

317
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:15,120
But I also want something in return.

318
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,707
You will release every slave in yunkai.

319
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,543
Every man, woman, and child

320
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:25,255
shall be given as much food,
clothing, and property as they can carry

321
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,549
as payment for their years of servitude.

322
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:32,388
Reject this gift,
and I shall show you no mercy.

323
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,931
You are mad.

324
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:39,645
We are not astapor or qarth. We are
yunkai, and we have powerful friends.

325
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,315
Friends who would
take great pleasure in destroying you.

326
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:46,318
Those who survive,
we shall enslave once more.

327
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,654
Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well.

328
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,823
(Screeching)

329
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,534
- You swore me safe conduct.
- I did,

330
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,371
but my dragons made no promises.

331
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,248
And you threatened their mother.

332
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,001
Take the gold.

333
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,548
(Dragons screeching)

334
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,971
My gold. You gave it to me, remember?

335
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,348
And I shall put it to good use.

336
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:19,685
You'd be wise to do the same
with my gift to you.

337
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,061
Now get out.

338
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,605
(Muttering in valyrian)

339
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:29,236
The yunkish are
a proud people. They will not bend.

340
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,039
And what happens to things that don't bend?

341
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,993
He said he had
powerful friends. Who was he talking about?

342
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,495
I don't know.

343
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,664
Find out.

344
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,961
(Screeching)

345
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,514
Shae: Chains?

346
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,476
Solid gold from the
mines outside lannisport.

347
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,854
Smithed in casterly rock.

348
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,148
Golden chains.

349
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,359
You could buy a ship with these.

350
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,945
- Do I need a ship?
- What?

351
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,655
Am I going somewhere?

352
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,449
Of course you're not going anywhere.

353
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:19,161
So, am I invited to your wedding?

354
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:25,125
I didn't ask for this
marriage. I didn't want it.

355
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:28,921
No? She's a beautiful girl.
You said so yourself.

356
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,006
That doesn't mean that...

357
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,592
This is duty, not desire.

358
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,795
Is that what you
will tell yourself when you fuck her?

359
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,097
I don't have a choice. My father...

360
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,432
Does not rule the world.

361
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,438
We can still go across the narrow sea.

362
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,023
What would I do there?

363
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:49,817
Juggle?

364
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,612
I am a Lannister of casterly rock.

365
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,364
And I'm shae the funny whore.

366
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:59,284
My feelings for you have not changed.

367
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:03,163
I will marry sansa stark
and do my duty by her.

368
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:07,209
While I empty her chamber
pot and lick your cock when you're bored?

369
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,670
I swear to you, it will not be like that.

370
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,214
No? What will it be like?

371
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:17,219
I will buy you a good home
somewhere in the city.

372
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:22,599
You will have fine
clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants.

373
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:29,273
Any children we might have
will be well provided for.

374
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,275
Children? You think I want children

375
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,360
who can never see their father?

376
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,779
Who would be killed in their sleep

377
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,549
if their grandfather found out about them?

378
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:40,576
Listen. Listen to me, my lady.

379
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:42,995
I'm not your lady.

380
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,246
You are.

381
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,082
You'll always be my lady.

382
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:52,379
I'm your whore.

383
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:58,594
And when you are
tired of fucking me, I will be nothing.

384
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,037
(Thunder rumbling)

385
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,126
- What happened?
- Wildfire.

386
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,796
I should have been here.

387
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,967
After all the running and fighting,

388
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,761
here I am, back where I started.

389
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,222
Do you miss it?

390
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,974
- King's landing?
- Your father's house.

391
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,478
Never had a father. Never wanted one.

392
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,522
Haven't you ever
wondered where your strength came from?

393
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,942
Your talent for fighting?

394
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:58,612
I'm lowborn. As low as
can be. My mother was a tavern wench.

395
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:02,157
Mine was a slave. So was I.

396
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,828
Bought and sold, scourged and branded,

397
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,997
until the lord of light reached down,

398
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,999
took me in his hand, and raised me up.

399
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,586
I was born in flea bottom.

400
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,880
Your blood is noble.

401
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:22,719
Are you saying my father,
he was some lord or...

402
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:27,349
There. Your father's house.

403
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,691
I'm just a bastard.

404
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,487
The bastard of Robert
of the house Baratheon,

405
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,783
first of his name,
king of the andals and the first men.

406
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,745
Why do you think
the gold cloaks wanted you?

407
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:53,041
There is power in a king's blood.

408
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:11,226
Come sit by the fire, child.

409
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,024
Not talking, eh? That's a first.

410
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,068
I don't talk to traitors.

411
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,007
I didn't like giving up the boy.

412
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,157
But you did.

413
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,744
You took the gold and you gave him up.

414
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:35,500
The red god is
the one true god. You've seen his power.

415
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,462
When he commands, we obey.

416
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,131
He's not my one true god.

417
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,926
No? Who's yours?

418
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,639
Death.

419
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,478
(Men chattering indistinctly)

420
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,027
Spotted a Lannister raiding party.

421
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,821
- How many?
- No more than 20.

422
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:06,156
How far?

423
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,616
Less than a day's ride south.

424
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,663
What do you say, boys?
Time for a lion hunt?

425
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,248
All: Yeah!

426
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:20,629
But what about riverrun?
It's not south. It's west of here.

427
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,632
It will still be west of
here two days from now.

428
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,715
Arya: You swore.

429
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,801
Beric: To take you home, and I will.

430
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:27,928
But we need to do this first.

431
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,679
Why? So you can steal their gold?

432
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,431
I swear to you, this isn't...

433
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,058
I don't care what you swear

434
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,894
because you're a liar.
You lied to gendry, you lied to me.

435
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,980
You'll lie to anyone.
I hope the lannisters kill you all.

436
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:42,442
One day you'll understand, but now...

437
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,488
Anguy, bring her back.

438
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,823
Man: Come back, girl!

439
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,248
(Panting)

440
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,173
(Men chattering in distance)

441
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,514
(Muffled screams)

442
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,182
Kick all you like, wolf girl.

443
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,393
Won't do you no good.

444
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,860
(Door opening)

445
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,950
(Door closes)

446
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,036
I thought you were gone.

447
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,539
Tomorrow.

448
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:44,087
Have they told you what
they plan to do with me?

449
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,341
Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well.

450
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,887
He's going to the twins
for edmure Tully's wedding.

451
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,473
You're to remain here.

452
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,808
With Locke?

453
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:04,858
I owe you a debt.

454
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,575
When catelyn stark released
you, we both made a promise to her.

455
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,578
Now it's your promise.

456
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,622
You gave your word.

457
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:22,751
Keep it and consider the debt paid.

458
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,714
I will return the stark
girls to their mother.

459
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,092
I swear it.

460
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,975
Good-bye, ser Jaime.

461
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,404
(Door opens)

462
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:55,909
(Jaime grunting)

463
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,623
Here. Let me.

464
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:10,632
It will take time.

465
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,348
Beurn hopes your father will force

466
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,267
the citadel to give him back his chain.

467
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:24,145
My father will make him grand
maester if he grows me a new hand.

468
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,691
You will give my regards
to lord tywin, I trust?

469
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:33,822
Tell robb stark I'm sorry I
couldn't make his uncle's wedding.

470
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,824
The lannisters send their regards.

471
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,999
Safe journey, kingslayer.

472
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,376
Nothing to say?

473
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,131
I liked you better before. I don't
remember chopping your balls off, too.

474
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:57,679
Don't you worry about
your friend. We'll take good care of her.

475
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,020
(Theon gasps)

476
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,407
(Theon grunting)

477
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,700
(Woman shushing)

478
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,140
(Moans)

479
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,059
Gentle, my lord.

480
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,019
- (Gasping)
- Gentle.

481
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,066
(Panting)

482
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,196
(Theon coughing)

483
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,156
(Women shushing)

484
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,200
Myranda knows what she's doing.

485
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,077
Let her.

486
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,580
She trained as a septa, only...

487
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,040
(Chuckles)

488
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,417
She had other urges.

489
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:13,505
So did the septons,
only they lied about it.

490
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,675
Where is he?

491
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,176
Violet: Who, my lord?

492
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,930
There's no one here
but you, me, and Violet.

493
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,432
Please.

494
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,768
Don't you want us to see it?

495
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,687
Myranda: Oh, come on. Let us see it.

496
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,939
Everybody talks about it.

497
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,608
Who sent you?

498
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,527
Who sent us?

499
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,656
We sent ourselves,
lord greyjoy. We heard so much about it.

500
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:42,784
Please.

501
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,327
Oh!

502
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:45,829
There it is.

503
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,876
Do you think we're ugly?

504
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,296
He thinks we're ugly.

505
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,173
Well, he's been through so much.

506
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:59,134
Look at his poor face.

507
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,220
Help me.

508
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,598
If he comes back...

509
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,019
We need to make him feel better.

510
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,648
And how can we make him feel better?

511
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,067
I have an idea.

512
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,589
Violet: Aw!

513
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:43,428
She's shy. You know how
they are, these religious girls.

514
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,724
Maybe he doesn't know how we are.

515
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,945
(Moans)

516
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,573
I felt something.

517
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,412
Oh, lord greyjoy.

518
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,500
As good as they say?

519
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:14,584
Mmm.

520
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,377
(Myran da moaning)

521
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,721
And why should you get all the fun?

522
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,108
What? You like her better?

523
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,490
Plenty there for both of us.

524
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,828
I was here first.

525
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,038
(Panting)

526
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,749
(Horn blaring)

527
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:00,129
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

528
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,423
Terrible timing.

529
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,929
But I was getting jealous.

530
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,102
Well?

531
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,438
Should we see this cock
everyone's always going on about?

532
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,317
(Groans)

533
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:32,287
Everyone knows you love girls.

534
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:35,164
I bet you always thought
they loved you back.

535
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,716
(Grunting)

536
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,177
Your famous cock must be
very precious to you.

537
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:52,473
Would you say it's your most precious part?

538
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,142
(Whimpering)

539
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,395
(Whistles)

540
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:59,397
(Sobbing) Please.

541
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:06,446
No. No! Mercy, please!
Please, mercy! Mercy!

542
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,656
This is mercy.

543
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,576
I'm not killing you.

544
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,371
Just making a few alterations.

545
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:22,045
No! No! No! Please, no! No!

546
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:25,298
No! No, please! Please!

547
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,987
(Whispers) You're gonna scare it off.

548
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:32,388
(Whispers) I'm
not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.

549
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:35,725
It's too far away.

550
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,583
Ygritte: Is that a palace?

551
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,463
It's a windmill.

552
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,007
Windmill.

553
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,552
Who built it? Some king?

554
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,555
Just the men who used to live here.

555
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,725
Ygritte: They must have been
great builders, stacking stones so high.

556
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:21,229
Winterfell has towers
three times that size.

557
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,731
"Oh, I'm Jon snow and I'm from winterfell.

558
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,233
"My daddy was a fancy lord

559
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,902
"and I lived in a tower
that touched the clouds."

560
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,989
If you're impressed
by a windmill, you'd be swooning

561
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,616
if you saw the great keep at winterfell.

562
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,243
What's swooning?

563
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,036
Fainting.

564
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,330
What's fainting?

565
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,419
When a girl sees blood and collapses.

566
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,379
Why would a girl see blood and collapse?

567
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,547
Well...

568
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,259
Not all girls are like you.

569
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,844
(Chuckles)

570
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,929
Well, girls see more blood than boys.

571
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:59,058
Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon snow?

572
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,603
(Gasps) Oh, a spider! Save me, Jon snow.

573
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:08,526
My dress is made
of the purest silk from tralalalaleeday.

574
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,403
I'd like to see you in a silk dress.

575
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:14,407
Would you?

576
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,829
So I could tear it off you.

577
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:25,168
Well, you rip my pretty silk
dress, I'll blacken your eye.

578
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,677
Maybe one day I'll take you to winterfell.

579
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,015
Or maybe one day I'll take you there.

580
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,476
After we've taken our land back.

581
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,230
Ygritte.

582
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,110
You won't win.

583
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,573
I know your people are brave,
no one denies that.

584
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,116
You know nothing...

585
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,721
Six times in the last thousand years,

586
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:01,287
a king-beyond-the-wall
has attacked the kingdoms.

587
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,914
Six times they failed.

588
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,582
And how do you know that?

589
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:08,294
Every boy in
the north knows it. We grow up learning it.

590
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:11,172
Where the battles
were fought, the heroes, who died where.

591
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:16,010
Six times you've invaded
and six times you've failed.

592
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,554
The seventh will be the same.

593
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,139
Mance is different.

594
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,766
You don't have the discipline.

595
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:25,353
You don't have the training.
Your army is no army.

596
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,747
You don't know how to fight together.

597
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:27,814
You don't know that.

598
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,107
I do.

599
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,442
I know it.

600
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:35,404
If you attack the wall,
you'll die. All of you.

601
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,498
All of us.

602
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:05,309
You're mine as I'm yours.

603
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,813
And if we die, we die.

604
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,732
But first we'll live.

605
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:16,070
Yes, first we'll live.

606
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:30,710
(Indistinct chattering)

607
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:34,380
What's he going on about?

608
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:39,552
And how come he always gets to sit and
chat while we do all the work?

609
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,390
Hodor

610
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,352
- that's where we are.
- What are you telling him?

611
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,439
- It's all right, osha.
- It's not all right.

612
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:53,292
You think I can't hear you every day?

613
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:54,676
Filling his head with black magic.

614
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,029
Talking about visions
and three-eyed ravens and worse.

615
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,238
Leave him alone.

616
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:00,865
He can speak for himself.

617
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:02,909
I don't fill his head with anything.

618
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:04,744
Osha: So, what do you talk about?

619
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:08,331
What's happening to him
and what that means.

620
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,625
Go on, then. Tell us what it means.

621
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,543
It's not like that.

622
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:16,088
I wish I could tell him all the
answers. It would be much easier.

623
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,175
I don't want you talking to him anymore.

624
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,177
Until we get to your
brother at castle black.

625
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,637
We're not going to castle black.

626
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,138
What did you say?

627
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:26,891
I told you already. Jon snow isn't there.

628
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,477
Bran needs to find the
raven beyond the wall.

629
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,880
Oh, no. I'm not going back there.

630
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:33,856
Your brother is
at castle black. That's where we're going.

631
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,818
Look at me.

632
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:43,407
The raven's been coming
to me ever since I fell from that tower.

633
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:45,576
He wants me to find him.

634
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,788
I don't have my legs anymore.

635
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:51,582
This is what I have now.

636
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:55,753
You have a family.
You need to go back to castle black

637
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,422
so you can get back to
them, where you belong.

638
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,424
What if! Belong in the north?

639
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:05,763
What if I fell from that
tower for a reason?

640
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:09,850
Is that what he's
telling you? That it's all for a reason?

641
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:14,522
All these bad things happened because the
gods got big plans for you?

642
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:16,541
I wish it were true, little lord.

643
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:20,611
But the gods wouldn't spare a
raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone.

644
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,947
You don't understand. You don't know.

645
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,991
You don't know. None of you know.

646
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,076
None of you have been up there.

647
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:34,458
I had a man once. A good man.

648
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:38,838
Bruni, his name was.
I was his and he was mine.

649
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,882
But one night Bruni disappears.

650
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:46,470
People said he left me, but I knew him.

651
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:50,057
He'd never leave me. Not for long.

652
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,685
I knew he'd come back.

653
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,730
And he did.

654
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:00,568
He came in through the back of the hut.

655
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:05,364
Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really.

656
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:12,288
His skin was pale like a dead man's.

657
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:15,875
His eyes quer than clear sky.

658
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:26,594
He came at me,
grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard

659
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,096
I could feel the life slipping out of me.

660
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,517
I don't know how I got the knife.

661
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:39,357
When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart.

662
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,154
And he hardly seemed to notice.

663
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:51,118
I had to burn our hut down with him inside.

664
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,624
I didn't ask the gods what it meant.

665
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:59,460
I didn't need to. I already knew.

666
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:05,466
It meant the north was
no place for men to be. Not anymore.

667
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:11,722
I promised your maester
I'd get you to castle black and no further.

668
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:22,900
Qyburn: How is the pain, my lord?

669
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,989
What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?

670
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,830
Well, we've stymied the corruption.

671
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,832
Yes, we've stymied the corruption.

672
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,334
You're a learned man.

673
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,253
All the good it's done me.

674
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,213
You did well sewing up this mess.

675
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:49,510
You're far better at this sort of
work than grand maester pycelle.

676
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,762
Faint praise, my lord.

677
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,517
So, why did the citadel take your chain?

678
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,103
Did you fondle one boy too many?

679
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,106
No, my lord. That's not my weakness.

680
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:05,443
What is?

681
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:10,072
Curiosity.

682
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:13,492
The only way to treat disease
is to understand disease,

683
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:17,329
and the only way
to understand it is to study the afflicted.

684
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,208
You performed experiments on living men.

685
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,294
- On dying men.
- With their permission?

686
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:27,840
My studies have
given me insight that has saved many lives.

687
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:32,928
Dying paupers, I assume.
Men with no families to complain.

688
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,432
You found them moaning in the poorhouse

689
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,726
and had them carted back to your garret

690
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,809
and opened up their bellies
to see what was inside.

691
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,689
How many men have you killed, my lord?

692
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,734
- I don't know.
- 50?

693
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,069
100?

694
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,031
Countless.

695
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,825
"Countless" has a nice ring to it.

696
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:56,660
And how many lives have you saved?

697
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:59,079
Halfa million.

698
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:03,292
The population of king's landing.

699
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,425
You were in charge of
the ravens at harrenhal.

700
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:16,347
Did you... did you get a bird
off to brienne's father in tarth?

701
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,266
A bird flew off and a bird flew back.

702
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,686
Lord selwyn tarth

703
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:26,732
offered 300 gold dragons
for his daughter's safe return.

704
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,150
A fair offer.

705
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:30,027
A fair offer. Locke won't take it.

706
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:32,947
Why not?

707
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:36,909
He's convinced lord tarth
owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.

708
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:39,245
(Sighs)

709
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:41,121
He feels he's being cheated.

710
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,041
They'd be fools to kill her.

711
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,293
These men have been at war a long time.

712
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,587
Most of them will be dead by winter.

713
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:51,382
She'll be their entertainment tonight.

714
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,969
Beyond tonight,
I don't think they care very much.

715
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,268
(Horse neighing)

716
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:16,991
We have to return to harrenhal.

717
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:20,369
- Why?
- I've left something behind.

718
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:23,914
Absolutely not.
I've got orders from lord Bolton.

719
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,791
And what are those orders?

720
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,627
To deliver you
to your father at king's landing.

721
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,338
You think you'll get a reward.

722
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:36,343
I serve lord Bolton.

723
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,000
Any appreciation your father...

724
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,364
You think you're getting a reward.

725
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:42,141
Let me explain
something to you. When my father sees me,

726
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:45,144
the first thing he's going to
ask is what happened to my hand,

727
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:48,188
and I'm going to tell him
this man chopped it off.

728
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:50,065
I had nothing...

729
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,026
Or I could tell him this man saved my life.

730
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,363
We return to harrenhal. Now.

731
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:21,555
- Eyes open, lads.
- Be quiet.

732
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,100
(Men singing)

733
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:29,313
The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair

734
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,524
from there to here, from here to there

735
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:34,818
all black and brown and covered in hair

736
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,987
he smelled that girl in the summer air

737
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:39,490
the bear, the bear, and the maiden fair

738
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:40,908
(all cheering)

739
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,746
Man: Don't spare her.

740
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,665
Don't spare her!

741
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:48,749
(Grunts)

742
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:49,958
(Roaring)

743
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,462
Well, this is one shameful
fucking performance.

744
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:55,130
Stop running and fight.

745
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,924
(Bear growling)

746
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:03,555
A wooden sword?

747
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,808
I thought you'd gone.

748
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,309
You gave her a wooden sword!

749
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:08,894
We've only got one bear.

750
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,312
I'll pay her bloody ransom.

751
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:13,607
Gold, sapphires, whatever you
want. Just get her out of there.

752
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,819
All you lords and ladies still think that

753
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:19,530
the only thing that matters is gold.

754
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:23,117
This makes me happier
than all your gold ever could.

755
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,036
And that makes me happier
than all her sapphires.

756
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:31,041
So go buy yourself a golden
hand and fuck yourself with it!

757
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,627
(All cheering)

758
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:35,003
(Growling)

759
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,132
(Groans)

760
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:42,803
(Screams)

761
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,180
(Roaring)

762
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:51,603
- Get behind me.
- I will not.

763
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:52,855
(Grunting)

764
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:04,867
What the fuck are you doing to my bear?

765
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,287
Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him
back to king's landing alive,

766
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:09,913
and that's what I aim to do.

767
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,293
Pull her up!

768
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:26,930
(Grunting)

769
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:29,516
Hold my legs.

770
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:51,997
(Grunts)

771
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,833
Pull him up!

772
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:00,047
(Men jeering)

773
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,051
(Panting)

774
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:07,221
The bitch stays.

775
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:13,519
We're taking her
to king's landing. Unless you kill me.

776
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,773
She belongs to me.

777
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,651
Lord Bolton's orders.

778
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,529
Jaime: What do you
think is more important to lord Bolton?

779
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,239
Getting his pet rat a reward

780
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:28,617
or ensuring tywin Lannister
gets his son back alive?

781
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:45,759
(Bear roaring)

782
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,765
Well, we must be on our way.

783
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,437
Sorry about the sapphires.

784
00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:16,832
(Bear roaring)
