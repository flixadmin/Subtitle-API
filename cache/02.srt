1
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,203
Previously on "The Flash"...

2
00:00:03,205 --> 00:00:04,287
We just beat Zoom.

3
00:00:04,289 --> 00:00:05,705
Why does it feel like I just lost?

4
00:00:05,707 --> 00:00:07,691
I feel more broken than I've ever felt.

5
00:00:07,693 --> 00:00:08,959
Wherever you need to go,

6
00:00:08,961 --> 00:00:11,094
whatever you need to do, do it.

7
00:00:11,096 --> 00:00:12,512
I'll be here.

8
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:17,300
You're safe.

9
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:20,553
So what should we call this brave new world?

10
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:22,522
I was thinking Flashpoint.

11
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:24,224
My name is Edward Clariss.

12
00:00:24,226 --> 00:00:26,643
Rivals should know each other's names.

13
00:00:28,947 --> 00:00:31,815
It's like I'll be thinking of a
moment from my past and it vanishes.

14
00:00:31,817 --> 00:00:33,650
This isn't your home, Barry.

15
00:00:33,652 --> 00:00:36,236
It's a mirage.

16
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:38,154
Things are back to how they should be.

17
00:00:38,156 --> 00:00:41,074
Well, for me, anyway. For you?

18
00:00:41,076 --> 00:00:42,993
I guess you'll just
have to wait and find out.

19
00:00:42,995 --> 00:00:44,828
Where's Iris?

20
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,130
You know Iris isn't here.
They don't talk, Barry.

21
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:49,332
Oh, God. What did I do?

22
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:52,836
I made a big mistake. I just couldn't

23
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:54,287
take it anymore, you know?

24
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:56,423
What happened with Zoom, my dad dying,

25
00:00:56,425 --> 00:00:59,142
my mother's death, me becoming The Flash.

26
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:01,428
All of it. I wanted a new life.

27
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,597
I wanted to start over.
And that's what I did.

28
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,434
But somehow I... I made things worse.

29
00:01:13,358 --> 00:01:15,358
- No.
- So I reset everything.

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,110
I put everything back to the way
that it was before.

31
00:01:17,112 --> 00:01:18,445
Except some things weren't the same anymore.

32
00:01:18,447 --> 00:01:20,280
- Not even a little bit.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33
00:01:20,282 --> 00:01:22,115
Slow down.

34
00:01:22,117 --> 00:01:24,834
Take a breath.

35
00:01:24,836 --> 00:01:25,919
You were talking way too fast.

36
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:27,420
- Yeah.
- What happened?

37
00:01:27,422 --> 00:01:29,289
I really screwed up, Felicity.

38
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:31,858
And this time I don't know if I can fix it.

39
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,380
Okay, let me get this straight.

40
00:01:37,382 --> 00:01:40,433
- You ran back in time?
- Yeah.

41
00:01:40,435 --> 00:01:42,352
Stopped Reverse-Flash from killing your mom

42
00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:44,471
and then lived in an alternate reality

43
00:01:44,473 --> 00:01:45,638
where both your parents were alive?

44
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,973
- Yeah.
- And then you

45
00:01:46,975 --> 00:01:48,608
restored the timeline, came back

46
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,560
to the moment you left, and noticed

47
00:01:50,562 --> 00:01:52,278
- that things were different?
- Exactly.

48
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,781
Does that just happen
when you travel through time?

49
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:56,316
Do things just change like that?

50
00:01:56,318 --> 00:01:58,068
No, I mean, not like this.

51
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,320
Not on... I don't know.
I don't know Felicity.

52
00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:01,788
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

53
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,540
Okay, why don't you just run me through...

54
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:05,408
walk me through what happened?

55
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,628
And we'll, uh, we'll try and figure it out.

56
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,163
So what changed?

57
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:14,334
I knew once I got back last night

58
00:02:14,336 --> 00:02:15,835
some things had changed, but before

59
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:17,387
I could figure out exactly how much,

60
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:19,672
I had to deal with someone this morning.

61
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:33,486
You are not gonna get too far

62
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:35,905
on that thing anymore, are you?

63
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:38,324
I will be taking these back
to the jewelry store

64
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:39,859
you stole them from.

65
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:41,945
But, uh, you can keep these if you'd like.

66
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:45,365
Good luck with that.

67
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:49,786
After he was taken care of,
I went to S.T.A.R. Labs,

68
00:02:49,788 --> 00:02:51,204
and that's when I found out

69
00:02:51,206 --> 00:02:53,373
a lot more had changed than I realized.

70
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:54,707
What kind of idiot still thinks

71
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:56,009
I can't outrun bullets?

72
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:57,377
That guy should be the criminal poster boy

73
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:59,045
for what not to do against The Flash.

74
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:00,296
So what are we gonna call him?

75
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:02,182
- You mean like a nickname?
- Yeah.

76
00:03:02,184 --> 00:03:04,217
Cisco does it for all of them,
he's like the master of it.

77
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:06,352
Can't just call him Suspect on a Motorcycle,

78
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:07,887
Right? What do you think?

79
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:10,190
- I don't know.
- I'll take this one.

80
00:03:10,192 --> 00:03:13,309
Uh, The Crook. Lame?

81
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:16,279
- A Five-Finger...
- How about Thief?

82
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:19,265
He robs stuff. Let's just call him Thief.

83
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,237
Gotta get to the gym. Excuse me.

84
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:28,992
The gym? Is he... is he,
like, working out now or...

85
00:03:30,495 --> 00:03:31,795
You know, Barry, sometimes your jokes

86
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:33,663
just aren't very funny.

87
00:03:37,502 --> 00:03:39,836
I should... I should get back to the paper.

88
00:03:39,838 --> 00:03:42,672
It's okay. I was just leaving.

89
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:44,841
Hey, guys... Hey, Joe. Look, hey, I'm sorry.

90
00:03:44,843 --> 00:03:47,177
Look, I just, I know you guys
aren't speaking

91
00:03:47,179 --> 00:03:48,895
to each other right now,
but I was just thinking

92
00:03:48,897 --> 00:03:52,515
maybe we could talk about
why that is for a minute.

93
00:03:52,517 --> 00:03:53,766
I... No.

94
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:55,018
- Dude.
- No, we can't.

95
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,603
Okay, I'm sorry. I just... look.

96
00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:58,154
I'm sorry, I just thought, I don't know,

97
00:03:58,156 --> 00:04:00,490
maybe it would be good
for you guys just to...

98
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:01,941
hear it said out loud. This is because

99
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:04,244
of what he did, Barry, not me.

100
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:06,996
- Iris.
- What?

101
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:09,082
What could you possibly have to say?

102
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:15,538
I'll just see you at the station, all right?

103
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,175
Nice job with, uh, Thief.

104
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,628
- Uh, give me a lift to CCU?
- Sure.

105
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,764
So you're still taking engineering classes.

106
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:27,467
- Yeah.
- Yeah, cool.

107
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:31,187
All right, well, good...
good luck with that.

108
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:33,723
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

109
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:36,109
Are you trying to make me
as mad at you as I am at him?

110
00:04:36,111 --> 00:04:40,146
No, no, look, I'm... I'm sorry, I...

111
00:04:40,148 --> 00:04:45,151
I guess I don't fully understand
why you're so upset at him.

112
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:49,455
Then maybe you shouldn't bring it up again.

113
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:51,991
Yeah.

114
00:04:51,993 --> 00:04:54,827
How about we talk about us instead?

115
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:56,829
Us? You... you mean you and me,

116
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:57,914
like, trying this?

117
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,249
I just thought with everything

118
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:01,167
that's happened lately and everything

119
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:03,169
that you've been through,

120
00:05:03,171 --> 00:05:06,389
I wanted to make sure
that you still felt the same.

121
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:08,841
Well, Iris, I did what you said.

122
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:10,810
I went where I needed to go,

123
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:12,178
I did what I needed to do,

124
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,981
and I'm ready.

125
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:17,016
I never told you to do that.

126
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:18,768
Yeah, no, you did... on the porch,

127
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,770
right after we beat Zoom,
right before you...

128
00:05:20,772 --> 00:05:22,989
- Wow, you kissed Iris.
- Well, not anymore.

129
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:24,574
I've kissed Iris West twice,
and I have managed

130
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:26,409
to erase both times from existence.

131
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:27,994
Man, I hate it when that happens.

132
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:30,496
That's just the least of my problems today.

133
00:05:31,866 --> 00:05:35,201
Joe, hey... hey, man,
um, can we talk for a second?

134
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:37,453
Yeah, I just gotta drop this off for Singh.

135
00:05:37,455 --> 00:05:40,707
Oh, Captain Singh's back?
That's just terrific.

136
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:42,675
Yeah, why, did he go somewhere?

137
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:44,794
Uh, no... maybe. I don't know, I...

138
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:47,680
Is that cowl cutting off
all the oxygen in your brain?

139
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:49,382
What? No, I'm fine. Why? Why?

140
00:05:49,384 --> 00:05:50,967
Because you've been acting real odd lately.

141
00:05:50,969 --> 00:05:52,719
Asking why Iris wasn't
at the house last night.

142
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:54,554
And that stunt you pulled
at S.T.A.R. Labs this morning.

143
00:05:54,556 --> 00:05:56,639
You know damn well
why she's not talking to me.

144
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:59,142
Of course. Uh, because sh...

145
00:05:59,144 --> 00:06:01,477
Because I should have told her
her mother was alive

146
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:02,729
but I didn't.

147
00:06:02,731 --> 00:06:04,697
Yeah, but she forgave you for that.

148
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,566
Ah... one would think that she would have.

149
00:06:06,568 --> 00:06:08,568
I don't know if she ever will or not,

150
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,571
but you sticking your nose
into it isn't helping, Bar.

151
00:06:11,573 --> 00:06:14,340
- Good intentions and all.
- I was... okay.

152
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:16,075
We found another husk this morning.

153
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:17,377
Husk?

154
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:19,329
Singh wants this processed ASAP.

155
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:22,999
Yes, the skin husks
we've been finding around

156
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:25,752
the city are the ones we think
are attached to the meta-humans.

157
00:06:25,754 --> 00:06:27,420
This is now the fourth one.

158
00:06:27,422 --> 00:06:28,721
Well, let's figure out what's happening

159
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:29,922
before there's a fifth.

160
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:31,090
Yes, sir.

161
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:35,762
Deep breaths.

162
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,266
Um, hello?

163
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:42,485
Yes. Hello, Mr. Allen.

164
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:44,437
I can still see you're there and no,

165
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:46,105
I don't want your help, thank you.

166
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:48,941
What are you doing here, Julian Albert,

167
00:06:48,943 --> 00:06:51,194
meta-human CSI Specialist?

168
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:52,612
I did tell you the meta-human conference

169
00:06:52,614 --> 00:06:55,615
- was only for two days.
- Okay, but this is...

170
00:06:55,617 --> 00:06:58,584
Still our lab... unfortunately.

171
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,870
Yes, County forgot to mention
that significant detail

172
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:03,790
before assigning me, but here we are.

173
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,208
Looks like you and I get to be roomies

174
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,627
for a little longer than we'd hoped.

175
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:11,130
Roomies.

176
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:12,598
There's a whole new guy at work

177
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,933
- that you didn't even know about?
- Yeah.

178
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:15,385
And he's worked there for almost a year.

179
00:07:15,387 --> 00:07:17,136
And he doesn't like me
very much, apparently.

180
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:19,188
Well, that's impossible.
Everybody likes Barry Allen.

181
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,140
You're like pudding.
Everybody likes pudding.

182
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:23,476
Not everyone.

183
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:27,313
37.

184
00:07:27,315 --> 00:07:30,733
I hated that we never spoke.

185
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:32,985
I think the thing that haunts
me the most is the fact

186
00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:36,372
that I never told him I loved him.

187
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:38,491
Or that I idolized him.

188
00:07:38,493 --> 00:07:42,245
I have memories of Dante all the time.

189
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:44,664
But they don't feel like gifts.

190
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:48,167
They feel like reminders...

191
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:49,986
of what I did wrong,

192
00:07:49,988 --> 00:07:53,556
and how I'll never make
another memory with Dante again.

193
00:07:57,979 --> 00:07:59,429
Excuse me.

194
00:08:05,353 --> 00:08:07,153
What are you doing here?

195
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:10,523
Oh, wait a second.
Now you wanna be there for me?

196
00:08:10,525 --> 00:08:13,109
I'm just trying to understand.

197
00:08:13,111 --> 00:08:14,827
My brother's dead.

198
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:16,996
There's nothing to understand.

199
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:19,365
Exit's that way.

200
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:21,000
So you altered the timeline,

201
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:22,618
Joe and Iris don't talk anymore,

202
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,754
there's a guy at work... a new guy...

203
00:08:24,756 --> 00:08:27,540
who doesn't like you, you never kissed Iris,

204
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:29,876
and Cisco's brother is dead.

205
00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:31,861
Admittedly, that is an issue.

206
00:08:31,863 --> 00:08:33,129
And what if there's more?

207
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:34,714
Well, has anything here changed?

208
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:36,466
No, I don't know. I mean,

209
00:08:36,468 --> 00:08:38,634
everything seems the same, I think.

210
00:08:38,636 --> 00:08:39,969
Good.

211
00:08:39,971 --> 00:08:41,637
- Can I use... hold on.
- Uh...

212
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,055
I'll be real careful.

213
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:44,390
I got it, don't worry. I got it.

214
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,280
Yeah, I don't know...
I mean, everything looks okay.

215
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:53,449
Wait.

216
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:56,402
Who's that young boy with Dig?

217
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:58,571
No way. He didn't have kid before?

218
00:08:58,573 --> 00:09:00,123
No, he had a kid. He has... he has a kid.

219
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,291
Yeah, it was baby Sara.

220
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:04,243
Baby John.

221
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:06,546
No. Are you...

222
00:09:06,548 --> 00:09:08,798
Oh, my God. It really can affect us.

223
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,383
Okay, you know what?
I don't wanna know anymore.

224
00:09:10,385 --> 00:09:11,834
Okay, I know this is a lot of pressure,

225
00:09:11,836 --> 00:09:13,553
but everything's gonna be all right.

226
00:09:13,555 --> 00:09:15,421
- I screwed up everyone's life.
- Yeah, well, maybe

227
00:09:15,423 --> 00:09:16,923
- you should tell them.
- I'm not gonna tell them.

228
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:18,424
I mean, how is that gonna help? That's just

229
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:19,509
gonna make everything worse.
I mean... I don't know

230
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:21,310
- how to fix this.
- Okay, well,

231
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:22,261
you're gonna figure it out.
If there's one thing

232
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:23,596
I've learned from you,

233
00:09:23,598 --> 00:09:25,932
is that with you, anything is possible.

234
00:09:25,934 --> 00:09:27,900
Why? 'Cause I'm The Flash?

235
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:30,236
No. Because you are Barry Allen.

236
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:32,438
And sweet, loving, kind Barry Allen

237
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,906
that everybody likes,

238
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:36,943
the Barry Allen who's just like pudding,

239
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:38,861
can fix this.

240
00:09:38,863 --> 00:09:42,949
So go and fix this.

241
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:44,283
Yeah.

242
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:46,335
Okay, you're right. Yeah.

243
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:47,954
- Now!
- Right now?

244
00:09:47,956 --> 00:09:50,339
- Yes!
- Okay, all right.

245
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,388
Stop!

246
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,356
Find me.

247
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:09,308
Who? Who?

248
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:39,839
I am Alchemy.

249
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:42,174
I have visions...

250
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:45,061
of another life.

251
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:47,663
Please, make them stop.

252
00:10:47,665 --> 00:10:49,682
Is that what you really want?

253
00:10:49,684 --> 00:10:51,767
To make the visions stop?

254
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:54,570
Or do you want them to come true?

255
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:56,989
To be fast again?

256
00:10:56,991 --> 00:11:00,743
- To have speed?
- Yes.

257
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:05,197
Do you want that other life?

258
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:07,333
That's what I want.

259
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:10,753
Once again, you will have power.

260
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:14,373
And no man will be your rival.

261
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,564
Julian, I thought you could
use some help on this one.

262
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:35,034
You know, the two heads thing and all.

263
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:37,036
I don't need any help, Detective.

264
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:38,570
Especially from him.

265
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:45,077
- What is that?
- Another epidermal husk, Allen.

266
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,879
A fully intact human pelt,

267
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:49,415
comprised of nothing
but the stratum corneum.

268
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,385
You see what I mean?

269
00:11:53,387 --> 00:11:56,055
Do we have any theories
as to what's causing them?

270
00:11:56,057 --> 00:11:58,090
Well, I'll take a wild guess at it and say

271
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,592
it's the same thing that created
the last four husks.

272
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,815
Spalling could be caused
from toxic epidermal necrolysis,

273
00:12:06,817 --> 00:12:08,817
or maybe some kind of moist desquamation

274
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:10,569
from intense radiation exposure.

275
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:12,571
- We've had a lot of...
- Radioactive metas.

276
00:12:12,573 --> 00:12:15,107
Yes, thank you, Allen.
I've read all the case studies.

277
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,608
I'll tell you what, when I figure it out,

278
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,744
I'll enlighten you then, shall I?

279
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:20,446
Thanks.

280
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:26,352
How have I worked
with this guy for the past year?

281
00:12:26,354 --> 00:12:27,953
Yeah, you say that all the time.

282
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,621
I'm sure I do.

283
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,290
Julian?

284
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,258
Are you certain that Barry can't

285
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,095
take a sample or something
to speed things along?

286
00:12:36,097 --> 00:12:38,514
I'm sure, Detective.

287
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:40,849
Quite sure.

288
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,141
You might wanna get that to S.T.A.R. Labs.

289
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,359
Yeah.

290
00:12:56,951 --> 00:12:58,784
You know, there's really not that much here.

291
00:12:58,786 --> 00:13:01,820
Yeah, no, I know. It's basically touch DNA.

292
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:05,207
I had to steal the sample
because our meta-human expert

293
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:07,910
- wouldn't let me take one.
- Oh, you mean Julian Albert?

294
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,662
Yeah, you know him?

295
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,716
Yeah, we've known him for a while.

296
00:13:13,718 --> 00:13:15,968
He's the best.

297
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,221
- Um, you need me?
- No, I think I got this.

298
00:13:19,223 --> 00:13:20,589
- But thank you.
- Okay.

299
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,343
Cisco told me you showed up

300
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,095
to his bereavement group last night.

301
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,097
Yeah, I did.

302
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,349
He also tell you it didn't go so well?

303
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,184
It's only been a few months since Dante

304
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,685
was killed by that drunk driver.

305
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,437
I'm sure he just needs
a little bit more time.

306
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,157
Wait, why is he so mad at me?

307
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,692
Oh, no. I'm staying out of that.

308
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,578
Cait, he'll... he'll barely look at me

309
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,413
unless other people are in the room.

310
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:47,783
Maybe it's just easier
when the rest of us are around.

311
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,620
Do you think maybe you could convince him

312
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,789
to come with you to my house
for dinner tonight?

313
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,875
- Why?
- So I can try to fix things

314
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:58,844
between us, maybe between Joe and Iris, too.

315
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:01,513
Just all of us together again in one room

316
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:04,850
and try to work this out once and for all.

317
00:14:04,852 --> 00:14:08,387
Think you can do that?

318
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,272
Okay.

319
00:14:10,274 --> 00:14:13,892
But how are you gonna
get Joe and Iris there?

320
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,561
Joe? Hey, Joe.

321
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,230
Um, so I talked to Iris and she just has

322
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,698
a few things that she wants to say to you.

323
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,233
Bar, I thought I told you
to stay out of this.

324
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,118
Oh, no, no, no. This was all her, I swear.

325
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,403
So she just, out of the blue,

326
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,872
decided now she wants to talk to me?

327
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,459
Hey, um, so Joe said that he'd give you

328
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:32,544
what you need about the husks for a story.

329
00:14:32,546 --> 00:14:34,296
- Hi.
- Hi.

330
00:14:34,298 --> 00:14:36,582
Uh, what? He just decided,
out of the blue, to tell me?

331
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,083
No one at the precinct will say anything.

332
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,902
Even Julian. Oh, I hate that guy.

333
00:14:39,904 --> 00:14:41,153
Yeah, you always say that.

334
00:14:41,155 --> 00:14:43,972
Um, when does he want to do it?

335
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:45,390
Uh, tonight, at the house.

336
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:46,575
He said he's making your favorite.

337
00:14:46,577 --> 00:14:47,759
Okay, he's out of his mind.

338
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,761
He knows I will not go back there,

339
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,647
even if he does make one of
Grandma Esther's recipes, so...

340
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:53,348
When?

341
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,100
Uh, tonight. Tonight, yeah.

342
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,768
- Um, at the house.
- At the house?

343
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,403
- Yeah.
- She vowed she'd never

344
00:14:58,405 --> 00:15:00,489
- set foot in the house again.
- Unless you made dinner.

345
00:15:00,491 --> 00:15:02,107
- Dinner?
- Yeah, like old times.

346
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,408
So, one of her favorites,

347
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,494
like Grandma Esther's recipes, maybe.

348
00:15:05,496 --> 00:15:07,579
Okay. I suppose I can make something.

349
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:09,364
Which dish?

350
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,283
He said he'd make the chicken.

351
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,918
I hate the chicken. I like the noodles.

352
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,003
- Oh, noodles, okay.
- Why are you out of breath?

353
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:16,622
I'm not out of breath. Uh, Joe also thought

354
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,123
maybe just to take some pressure
off that he'd invite

355
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,543
Caitlin and Cisco.

356
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:26,014
- Okay, um, what time?
- Uh, 7:00.

357
00:15:26,016 --> 00:15:28,267
All right.

358
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:30,636
Um, 7:00 will work, by the way.

359
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,104
- Okay, but which dish?
- I mean, I was thinking

360
00:15:32,106 --> 00:15:33,555
maybe to take some pressure off,
you could invite

361
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,390
- Caitlin and Cisco.
- That's a good idea,

362
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,608
'cause if we're gonna do this,
I gotta get started.

363
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,110
Yeah, I got it. No problem, yeah.

364
00:15:38,112 --> 00:15:39,394
- Bar?
- Yeah?

365
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,780
- Which dish?
- Noodle dish.

366
00:15:41,782 --> 00:15:43,482
Yeah, noodle dish.

367
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,462
This hits the spot, huh?

368
00:15:57,464 --> 00:15:59,381
You can thank Grandma Esther.

369
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:02,718
No, I mean, it's good. I just meant, um...

370
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,672
all of us, actually, just here, together.

371
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:10,475
I was actually thinking,
um, that maybe it'd be fun

372
00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:13,178
if we all went away together for a few days.

373
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,763
Just like a little Team Flash vacay.

374
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:18,150
- And do what?
- Bond.

375
00:16:18,152 --> 00:16:21,353
- Reconnect.
- You mean like a retreat?

376
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,606
- Nah.
- With trust exercises?

377
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,742
Epic fail, party of six.

378
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:28,694
I just... I just feel like
we're not the team

379
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:32,030
that we were or can be.

380
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,418
No one?

381
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,170
I'd be down for it.

382
00:16:38,172 --> 00:16:39,371
Okay.

383
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,456
So other than Wally,

384
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,208
I'm the only one
that thinks that's a good idea?

385
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,295
I don't think The Flash
really takes vacations.

386
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:50,716
Especially with all these
husks showing up all over town.

387
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,268
Speaking of husks,
I'm glad you're finally ready

388
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,720
to open up about them.

389
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,021
Iris, I already told you, I can't tell you

390
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:58,890
anything about this case.

391
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,275
Oh, really?

392
00:17:00,277 --> 00:17:02,861
Because that's not what I was told.

393
00:17:02,863 --> 00:17:04,896
Strange. I was under the impression

394
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,899
you had some things to say to me, too.

395
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,068
Isn't that right, Bar?

396
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,704
Told you. Epic fail.

397
00:17:12,706 --> 00:17:14,573
Okay, look, yeah. I arranged this.

398
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,074
I put all this together. I'm sorry, guys.

399
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,126
Look, I just...
we're not acting like a team,

400
00:17:18,128 --> 00:17:19,995
and I just wanted things
back to how they were.

401
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,964
- Just fixed.
- If you wanted things fixed,

402
00:17:21,966 --> 00:17:23,282
maybe you should have gone back in time

403
00:17:23,284 --> 00:17:25,050
and stopped my brother from dying.

404
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,640
You want me to change
the timeline to save Dante?

405
00:17:31,642 --> 00:17:34,159
Why would you do that?
It's not like he's your brother.

406
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,518
Meta-human app. We gotta go.

407
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,167
Remember me, Flash?

408
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:01,119
Clariss?

409
00:18:05,111 --> 00:18:06,494
Clariss?

410
00:18:08,448 --> 00:18:10,114
Oh, you do remember, Flash?

411
00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:11,249
Good, yeah.

412
00:18:11,338 --> 00:18:14,172
Because I remember everything, too.

413
00:18:14,174 --> 00:18:16,374
- How are you here?
- It doesn't matter.

414
00:18:16,376 --> 00:18:18,209
You see, what does matter

415
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:20,512
is that I know your little secret.

416
00:18:20,514 --> 00:18:23,515
You changed the timeline.

417
00:18:23,517 --> 00:18:25,433
Because if I recall correctly,

418
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:27,969
the only Speedsters in my other life

419
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:30,972
were me and that smartass Kid Flash,

420
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:35,026
until you showed up
and stole everything from me!

421
00:18:35,028 --> 00:18:36,728
I didn't steal anything from you, Clariss.

422
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,731
I... I was just trying to put things back

423
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:41,149
to the way they're supposed to be.

424
00:18:41,151 --> 00:18:43,651
This is how my life is supposed to be!

425
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:47,205
For years, I felt like
something was missing.

426
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:48,573
And now I know why.

427
00:18:48,575 --> 00:18:50,158
Well, I'm sorry.

428
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,826
I didn't mean to do this to you.

429
00:18:51,828 --> 00:18:53,161
Yeah, well, you did.

430
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:56,081
And here I am.

431
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:59,000
Your Rival, back again.

432
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,224
Believe me, Flash, this time,

433
00:19:06,226 --> 00:19:09,310
you're not gonna steal my life so easily.

434
00:20:08,822 --> 00:20:10,738
We finally get rid of Zoom,

435
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,957
and there's another evil Speedster?

436
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:14,159
Who is this guy, now?

437
00:20:14,161 --> 00:20:15,326
I can help you with that.

438
00:20:15,328 --> 00:20:16,995
I finally got the results back

439
00:20:16,997 --> 00:20:18,246
from the test I ran on the husk

440
00:20:18,248 --> 00:20:19,747
that Barry gave me this morning.

441
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:21,332
And it's weird, because there's

442
00:20:21,334 --> 00:20:22,667
no traces of dark matter,

443
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:24,836
but there are traces of the Speed Force.

444
00:20:24,838 --> 00:20:26,371
And that's the husk from this Speedster?

445
00:20:26,373 --> 00:20:28,256
Appears so. His name is...

446
00:20:28,258 --> 00:20:31,025
Edward Clariss.

447
00:20:31,027 --> 00:20:35,263
And somehow Barry is exactly right.

448
00:20:35,265 --> 00:20:39,067
Can I talk to you for a second?

449
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:40,485
Yeah.

450
00:20:48,612 --> 00:20:50,111
S.T.A.R. Labs isn't the only one

451
00:20:50,113 --> 00:20:53,631
with access to the city's security cams.

452
00:20:53,633 --> 00:20:55,500
It's pretty obvious that this guy knows you.

453
00:20:55,502 --> 00:20:57,368
You want to tell me what that's about?

454
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,420
This is why you've been
acting so weird lately...

455
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:01,756
trying to get me and my dad talking again,

456
00:21:01,758 --> 00:21:04,792
tricking all of us into dinner tonight...

457
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:07,595
because you're keeping something from us.

458
00:21:07,597 --> 00:21:09,881
You need to tell me what is going on, Barry.

459
00:21:09,883 --> 00:21:12,851
Right now.

460
00:21:12,853 --> 00:21:15,136
And if you lie to me...

461
00:21:15,138 --> 00:21:19,474
this thing between us, it cannot happen.

462
00:21:19,476 --> 00:21:22,060
You're right, and, uh, I'm sorry, I...

463
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:24,646
I did this. All of this.

464
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:27,232
It's my fault and I've been
trying to fix it.

465
00:21:27,234 --> 00:21:32,654
But I think that there's only
one way to do that now.

466
00:21:32,656 --> 00:21:34,239
I'm sorry, Iris.

467
00:21:55,395 --> 00:21:56,561
Flash?

468
00:21:56,563 --> 00:21:58,680
Flash.

469
00:21:58,682 --> 00:22:02,150
Here, put these on.

470
00:22:02,152 --> 00:22:03,768
We need to talk.

471
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:13,945
Where are we?

472
00:22:13,947 --> 00:22:17,448
Motorcar Diner in Central City.

473
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,918
Yeah, I meant what year?

474
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,837
1998.

475
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,341
Care to get something to eat?

476
00:22:26,343 --> 00:22:28,042
'Cause I'm starved. The corn beef hash here

477
00:22:28,044 --> 00:22:29,928
- is the best I've ever had.
- This is why you pulled me

478
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,796
out of the Speed Force?

479
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:33,131
- Buy me a meal?
- Because you were

480
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:34,465
about to reset the timeline again

481
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:37,635
after screwing it all up.

482
00:22:37,637 --> 00:22:38,803
Oh, yeah, I know about that.

483
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:40,555
- How did you...
- After your

484
00:22:40,557 --> 00:22:44,142
not-so-subtle reaction
when you first met me...

485
00:22:44,144 --> 00:22:48,696
Harry told me all that happened
with Zoom and your mom

486
00:22:48,698 --> 00:22:51,366
and your dad, so I decided

487
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:54,035
I'd keep my eye on you for a bit.

488
00:22:54,037 --> 00:22:57,071
- He tell you anything else?
- He did.

489
00:22:57,073 --> 00:22:59,207
I'm your father's doppelganger.

490
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:00,792
Sorry about that.

491
00:23:00,794 --> 00:23:03,161
It's just... really weird.

492
00:23:03,163 --> 00:23:07,131
And really sad, too... I'm sure.

493
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:08,549
Having a loss like that in your life,

494
00:23:08,551 --> 00:23:10,051
I see why you'd wanna erase it.

495
00:23:10,053 --> 00:23:12,170
Who wouldn't try to save their parents?

496
00:23:12,172 --> 00:23:14,589
I understand that, Barry, completely.

497
00:23:14,591 --> 00:23:18,059
But the thing is, there are consequences

498
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:19,677
to time travel.

499
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,264
I have heard all of this before.

500
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:26,150
Not from me you haven't.

501
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:29,020
I'm not some Doctor with a theory, Barry.

502
00:23:29,022 --> 00:23:33,691
I'm a Speedster, like you,
who's travelled in time,

503
00:23:33,693 --> 00:23:38,696
and made these same mistakes
you are making right now.

504
00:23:38,698 --> 00:23:40,365
Here, let me show you something.

505
00:23:40,367 --> 00:23:43,084
- Okay, you know what?
- Humor me, kid.

506
00:23:43,086 --> 00:23:45,703
- This coffee cup right here.
- All right, yeah.

507
00:23:45,705 --> 00:23:49,791
Think of it as the space-time continuum.

508
00:23:49,793 --> 00:23:53,878
Whenever you go back in time it breaks.

509
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,683
- For real? I mean...
- Now...

510
00:23:58,685 --> 00:24:01,886
you can reset the timeline,
you can try to fix it,

511
00:24:01,888 --> 00:24:05,940
but no matter how hard you try...

512
00:24:05,942 --> 00:24:08,943
it's never gonna be exactly how it was.

513
00:24:08,945 --> 00:24:12,363
Look, I've learned all this stuff

514
00:24:12,365 --> 00:24:13,981
that I didn't know before, okay?

515
00:24:13,983 --> 00:24:15,483
- I'm not gonna make the same...
- Mistakes.

516
00:24:15,485 --> 00:24:17,652
Yeah, what you just said right there?

517
00:24:17,654 --> 00:24:19,120
That is the paradox of time travel,

518
00:24:19,122 --> 00:24:20,455
and also the paradox of life.

519
00:24:20,457 --> 00:24:22,573
I mean, if I only knew then what I know now.

520
00:24:22,575 --> 00:24:25,243
Why have these powers if I can't go back

521
00:24:25,245 --> 00:24:27,412
and fix what I broke?

522
00:24:27,414 --> 00:24:29,580
We're not gods, we're men,

523
00:24:29,582 --> 00:24:31,416
who, for whatever reason, have been given

524
00:24:31,418 --> 00:24:34,585
extraordinary abilities.

525
00:24:34,587 --> 00:24:38,923
The question you need to ask yourself is,

526
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:41,759
what kind of hero are you gonna be?

527
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:44,095
Are you just gonna take a do-over

528
00:24:44,097 --> 00:24:46,013
every time you make a mistake?

529
00:24:46,015 --> 00:24:50,651
Or will you live with them and move forward?

530
00:25:04,007 --> 00:25:04,956
Where's Barry?

531
00:25:07,127 --> 00:25:10,711
I need to tell you all something.

532
00:25:10,713 --> 00:25:12,263
The truth.

533
00:25:12,265 --> 00:25:14,599
The truth about what?

534
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:16,601
Okay, um...

535
00:25:16,603 --> 00:25:18,770
after Zoom killed my dad,

536
00:25:18,772 --> 00:25:23,157
after we defeated him, um...

537
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,226
I wasn't in a great space,

538
00:25:25,228 --> 00:25:28,312
and I felt like the only way
I could fix that was

539
00:25:28,314 --> 00:25:33,034
to run back in time and save my mom.

540
00:25:33,036 --> 00:25:36,070
You stopped the Reverse-Flash
from killing your mom?

541
00:25:36,072 --> 00:25:37,572
Yeah.

542
00:25:37,574 --> 00:25:40,291
Wait, so, is she alive?

543
00:25:40,293 --> 00:25:43,661
She was. For a few months.

544
00:25:43,663 --> 00:25:45,580
I lived with her and my dad.

545
00:25:45,582 --> 00:25:47,248
I had a completely different life.

546
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,250
I wasn't even The Flash for most of it.

547
00:25:49,252 --> 00:25:50,468
I don't understand.

548
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,637
You created a whole other existence.

549
00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:55,339
How is that possible?

550
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,844
Okay, um...

551
00:25:59,846 --> 00:26:04,599
I'll do the... this is the timeline.

552
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:08,519
This is the point
that we exist on it right now.

553
00:26:08,521 --> 00:26:12,106
This past point
is where my mom was murdered.

554
00:26:12,108 --> 00:26:18,029
So when I saved her,
I created a new reality.

555
00:26:18,031 --> 00:26:19,780
A new timeline.

556
00:26:19,782 --> 00:26:21,866
- I was living in...
- A mirror universe.

557
00:26:21,868 --> 00:26:24,836
It's called a Flashpoint, apparently.

558
00:26:24,838 --> 00:26:27,288
But you decided to leave it. Why?

559
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,173
That life started to spin out of control.

560
00:26:29,175 --> 00:26:31,175
This guy, Clariss,

561
00:26:31,177 --> 00:26:32,910
he was a Speedster there, too.

562
00:26:32,912 --> 00:26:34,579
He was known as the Rival.

563
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:36,247
He caused a lot of problems.

564
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:39,250
So, um...

565
00:26:39,252 --> 00:26:45,139
I decided to run back in time
again and let things happen

566
00:26:45,141 --> 00:26:48,259
as they were supposed to, in hopes of...

567
00:26:48,261 --> 00:26:51,345
resetting the timeline, but...

568
00:26:51,347 --> 00:26:53,431
- But what?
- But, um,

569
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:58,185
when I came back, things weren't the same.

570
00:26:58,187 --> 00:27:03,107
You mean people. Like us.

571
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:04,775
Yeah, yeah.

572
00:27:04,777 --> 00:27:09,697
Um, I created another timeline.

573
00:27:09,699 --> 00:27:11,616
Uh, it's the one we're living in now.

574
00:27:11,618 --> 00:27:14,118
It's not as different as the last one.

575
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,953
Not in large ways, but in some ways,

576
00:27:15,955 --> 00:27:18,506
in smaller ways, and, uh, meaningful ways

577
00:27:18,508 --> 00:27:20,625
for all of you or anybody
that's close to me.

578
00:27:20,627 --> 00:27:25,796
And I can't ever really
put it back together.

579
00:27:31,721 --> 00:27:34,939
Barry, that's a lot to take in.

580
00:27:34,941 --> 00:27:37,224
Yeah, it is.

581
00:27:37,226 --> 00:27:39,944
We got along in that other life,

582
00:27:39,946 --> 00:27:41,979
my dad and I, didn't we?

583
00:27:41,981 --> 00:27:43,781
That's why you've been working so hard

584
00:27:43,783 --> 00:27:45,616
to get us talking again.

585
00:27:45,618 --> 00:27:48,903
Okay, here's the thing. Um, I will tell you

586
00:27:48,905 --> 00:27:51,706
what's different, all of you,
if you wanna know.

587
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:54,475
But you have to live with those differences

588
00:27:54,477 --> 00:27:56,794
because I can't change it again.

589
00:27:56,796 --> 00:27:58,963
But at least you'll know.

590
00:27:58,965 --> 00:28:01,382
And you all deserve that choice.

591
00:28:01,384 --> 00:28:05,336
So you decided it was okay to change things

592
00:28:05,338 --> 00:28:09,256
when someone in your family dies,

593
00:28:09,258 --> 00:28:13,844
but when it's someone in my family...

594
00:28:18,818 --> 00:28:20,401
I'm gonna go talk to him.

595
00:28:26,075 --> 00:28:27,024
Hey.

596
00:28:30,196 --> 00:28:32,029
What are you working on?

597
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,035
These are the gauntlets for my suit.

598
00:28:38,037 --> 00:28:40,421
And you probably know nothing about that.

599
00:28:40,423 --> 00:28:43,374
- Do you?
- I'm really trying here, Cisco.

600
00:28:43,376 --> 00:28:46,544
Barry, I'm the one who's been trying.

601
00:28:46,546 --> 00:28:48,462
I've been trying this whole time

602
00:28:48,464 --> 00:28:51,182
to get you to do this one thing for me,

603
00:28:51,184 --> 00:28:53,217
but you kept saying, "No, Cisco.

604
00:28:53,219 --> 00:28:56,387
I can't, Cisco.
I would never do that, Cisco."

605
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:57,855
And now you're telling me
you went and did it

606
00:28:57,857 --> 00:29:00,024
- for yourself.
- Were you listening?

607
00:29:00,026 --> 00:29:01,942
It... it went bad. It went really bad.

608
00:29:01,944 --> 00:29:04,729
I don't care!

609
00:29:04,731 --> 00:29:07,231
At least I'd have my brother back.

610
00:29:07,233 --> 00:29:09,033
Yeah, you would have him back,

611
00:29:09,035 --> 00:29:12,403
but because of it,
somebody might have something

612
00:29:12,405 --> 00:29:13,904
happen to them that's just as awful

613
00:29:13,906 --> 00:29:15,740
as what happened to Dante, and trust me,

614
00:29:15,742 --> 00:29:19,543
you don't want that on your conscience.

615
00:29:19,545 --> 00:29:21,912
It's a heavy burden to bear.

616
00:29:25,918 --> 00:29:31,422
And I don't know how many times
I've said this, but...

617
00:29:31,424 --> 00:29:33,674
I'm really sorry about Dante, man.

618
00:29:35,595 --> 00:29:37,645
Sorry doesn't change anything.

619
00:29:37,647 --> 00:29:41,565
No, it doesn't, but I can't go back.

620
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:44,602
I can't change it.

621
00:29:44,604 --> 00:29:46,654
All I can do is move forward.

622
00:29:48,908 --> 00:29:51,158
I really hope you can, too.

623
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:09,427
Hey, um, I need your help.

624
00:30:09,429 --> 00:30:11,595
It's the four words I seem to hear you

625
00:30:11,597 --> 00:30:13,798
most often say, Barry.

626
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,434
That and, "I hate that guy."

627
00:30:16,436 --> 00:30:17,935
Which, the feeling's mutual, so...

628
00:30:17,937 --> 00:30:19,720
Mm-hmm. Okay, um,

629
00:30:19,722 --> 00:30:20,805
this is gonna be hard for you,

630
00:30:20,807 --> 00:30:22,473
but I just, for a second,

631
00:30:22,475 --> 00:30:25,643
need you to imagine
that we're actually friends.

632
00:30:25,645 --> 00:30:26,977
Can't do it.

633
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:30,281
- Friendly.
- Equally as challenging, Barry.

634
00:30:30,283 --> 00:30:32,066
- Hmm.
- But I'll give it a whirl.

635
00:30:32,068 --> 00:30:34,535
What are you after?
I need to read your report

636
00:30:34,537 --> 00:30:36,320
- on one of the husks.
- Which one?

637
00:30:36,322 --> 00:30:38,539
The one from this morning. Edward Clariss.

638
00:30:38,541 --> 00:30:41,075
- Edward Clariss?
- Yeah.

639
00:30:41,077 --> 00:30:43,661
- Why?
- May help me figure out

640
00:30:43,663 --> 00:30:45,496
a case I'm working on.

641
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:50,801
Well, the nutshell is, uh,

642
00:30:50,803 --> 00:30:53,804
the hyaluronic acids
were found to be above normal.

643
00:30:53,806 --> 00:30:55,973
Uh, androgen degradation atypically low.

644
00:30:55,975 --> 00:30:57,591
- Mm-hmm.
- Cellular regeneration

645
00:30:57,593 --> 00:30:59,593
seemed to occur at a staggering rate.

646
00:30:59,595 --> 00:31:00,845
- Mm-hmm.
- It's quite a bit different

647
00:31:00,847 --> 00:31:02,146
from the previous husks that we found.

648
00:31:02,148 --> 00:31:03,347
That's about it. Could I...

649
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:05,182
could I maybe just take a peek at it?

650
00:31:05,184 --> 00:31:06,734
I'm sorry, it's just something I need to see

651
00:31:06,736 --> 00:31:09,687
to know what I'm looking for.

652
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:11,856
- Sure.
- Great, thank you.

653
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:17,111
Wait, why does this say
the body's place of discovery

654
00:31:17,113 --> 00:31:20,948
was Williamson when it was found
on the waterfront in Leawood?

655
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,000
The body ended up in Leawood.

656
00:31:23,002 --> 00:31:24,502
There was a strong current this morning,

657
00:31:24,504 --> 00:31:27,204
so chances are that it
originated from Williamson.

658
00:31:27,206 --> 00:31:30,374
Somewhere near the old Prescott sawmill.

659
00:31:30,376 --> 00:31:31,792
- You done?
- Yeah, uh, yes.

660
00:31:31,794 --> 00:31:34,461
Thank you.

661
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:38,215
You found me again, Flash.

662
00:31:38,217 --> 00:31:40,301
I wondered how long it'd take you this time

663
00:31:40,303 --> 00:31:42,720
- to figure it out.
- Wasn't too hard.

664
00:31:42,722 --> 00:31:44,438
I see you didn't bring your little sidekick

665
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,857
- with you, though.
- Nope.

666
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:49,727
- Just me.
- That's too bad.

667
00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:51,162
I brought one.

668
00:31:57,787 --> 00:31:59,703
Oh, and Flash? A little, uh,

669
00:31:59,705 --> 00:32:01,906
quaking in your boots
wouldn't be inappropriate.

670
00:32:09,368 --> 00:32:12,336
- So?
- He changed our lives, Iris.

671
00:32:12,338 --> 00:32:13,921
And he kept that secret from us.

672
00:32:13,923 --> 00:32:15,839
You really just want us
to just be okay with that?

673
00:32:15,841 --> 00:32:18,342
All I'm saying, Wally,
is that he made a mistake.

674
00:32:18,344 --> 00:32:22,012
- Yeah, he did.
- Cisco, we all make mistakes

675
00:32:22,014 --> 00:32:24,765
to protect the people that we love.

676
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:28,035
I mean, you told Captain Cold
that Barry was The Flash

677
00:32:28,037 --> 00:32:30,003
in order to protect your brother.

678
00:32:30,005 --> 00:32:32,906
Okay. Not my finest moment.

679
00:32:32,908 --> 00:32:35,743
That's my point. It was one decision

680
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,311
made in one moment.

681
00:32:37,313 --> 00:32:40,197
One very heart-wrenching moment.

682
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:42,332
Look, guys, we're like a family here, okay?

683
00:32:42,334 --> 00:32:44,585
And sometimes families get mad at each other

684
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,503
for screwing up.

685
00:32:46,505 --> 00:32:48,038
I know that all too well.

686
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,841
But they also forgive.

687
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,293
Because after a while, it just seems silly

688
00:32:53,295 --> 00:32:55,095
when you stop and think about it.

689
00:33:02,221 --> 00:33:05,973
Guys, Iris is right.

690
00:33:05,975 --> 00:33:08,175
We all have secrets.

691
00:33:08,177 --> 00:33:11,111
We've all screwed up, but this is Barry

692
00:33:11,113 --> 00:33:13,897
we're talking about.

693
00:33:15,401 --> 00:33:16,984
Who apparently is in trouble.

694
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,746
And who are you?

695
00:33:29,748 --> 00:33:33,500
I am Alchemy.

696
00:33:33,502 --> 00:33:36,220
Okay, well, what do you want?

697
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:40,157
To help people achieve
their true potential...

698
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,426
such as he has.

699
00:33:42,428 --> 00:33:43,927
And why are you doing this?

700
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:46,980
Because I'm preparing this world.

701
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:53,854
Remember what happened here
last time, Flash?

702
00:33:53,856 --> 00:33:56,907
It's where I died.

703
00:33:59,411 --> 00:34:03,163
And I'm not gonna waste this
second chance I've been given.

704
00:34:03,165 --> 00:34:07,784
This time, I'm gonna show you
who's the fastest man alive.

705
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:14,007
Barry? Barry!

706
00:34:14,009 --> 00:34:16,260
His coms aren't working.

707
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,545
He's at the Prescott Mill.

708
00:34:18,547 --> 00:34:21,014
That's right around the corner.

709
00:34:21,016 --> 00:34:22,466
We gotta do something.

710
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,616
Having fun yet, Flash?

711
00:34:39,618 --> 00:34:40,901
'Cause I'm having a blast.

712
00:34:48,827 --> 00:34:49,860
Ah!

713
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,916
Ah!

714
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:06,764
Time to look for a new rival.

715
00:35:10,686 --> 00:35:12,403
Stay away from my friend.

716
00:35:42,852 --> 00:35:44,685
Thank you.

717
00:35:44,687 --> 00:35:47,221
Sorry it took so long.

718
00:35:47,223 --> 00:35:49,056
You were just in time.

719
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,544
Nothing. No mention of Alchemy anywhere.

720
00:35:58,546 --> 00:35:59,795
No mask-wearing monk metas.

721
00:35:59,797 --> 00:36:01,263
- Not even close.
- I didn't find

722
00:36:01,265 --> 00:36:03,966
any known aliases in any
of the records at CCPD.

723
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,735
And Clariss won't say anything either.

724
00:36:06,737 --> 00:36:08,938
All right, well, keep at him.
Alchemy is the one that gave

725
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,273
- Clariss back his speed.
- He's kinda like a doctor,

726
00:36:11,275 --> 00:36:12,808
that way, don't you think?

727
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,810
Come on, don't pretend like "Doctor Alchemy"

728
00:36:14,812 --> 00:36:16,445
doesn't have a nice ring to it.

729
00:36:16,447 --> 00:36:18,530
Okay, well, that explains why he didn't have

730
00:36:18,532 --> 00:36:20,316
any traces of dark matter in his cells.

731
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:22,484
He didn't get his powers
from the particle accelerator,

732
00:36:22,486 --> 00:36:24,987
he got them from Alchemy.

733
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:25,988
What was that?

734
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,823
Doctor Alchemy.

735
00:36:27,825 --> 00:36:30,793
How could he do that?

736
00:36:30,795 --> 00:36:32,828
I don't know, but we need to figure it out.

737
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,330
There's gonna be more.

738
00:36:34,332 --> 00:36:37,666
Alchemy... Doctor Alchemy said that he is

739
00:36:37,668 --> 00:36:39,034
preparing this world.

740
00:36:39,036 --> 00:36:40,502
- Preparing the world?
- Mm-hmm.

741
00:36:40,504 --> 00:36:42,471
For what? Like, the second
coming or something?

742
00:36:42,473 --> 00:36:45,474
I think that everyone
that had powers in Flashpoint

743
00:36:45,476 --> 00:36:47,843
is gonna get them back.

744
00:36:47,845 --> 00:36:49,979
Well, we already found four other husks,

745
00:36:49,981 --> 00:36:51,847
which means there's at least that many

746
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:53,482
running around Central City right now.

747
00:36:53,484 --> 00:36:55,017
We need to find him before he changes

748
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:56,185
more people's lives.

749
00:36:56,187 --> 00:36:58,354
Speaking of changing lives,

750
00:36:58,356 --> 00:37:01,523
we all talked about it, Barry,
and we don't want to know

751
00:37:01,525 --> 00:37:04,493
what our lives were like in Flashpoint.

752
00:37:04,495 --> 00:37:06,211
You sure?

753
00:37:06,213 --> 00:37:08,530
To quote the wise words of Harry,

754
00:37:08,532 --> 00:37:10,749
"What's the point, Allen?"

755
00:37:10,751 --> 00:37:12,034
I gotta get to the precinct.

756
00:37:12,036 --> 00:37:14,703
Uh, stop by Jitters on the way?

757
00:37:14,705 --> 00:37:16,839
Yeah, it's on me.

758
00:37:16,841 --> 00:37:19,341
Oh, good. Then I'm coming, too.

759
00:37:22,763 --> 00:37:28,350
Yo, um, I've just been
thinking that it was pretty cool

760
00:37:28,352 --> 00:37:30,052
having someone out there with me last night.

761
00:37:30,054 --> 00:37:31,303
And, I don't know, maybe we could

762
00:37:31,305 --> 00:37:33,972
make that a thing every once in a while.

763
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,304
I... I got some things to work on

764
00:37:35,693 --> 00:37:38,227
before I start doing that.

765
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,813
Yeah.

766
00:37:46,037 --> 00:37:48,404
Maybe someday.

767
00:37:48,406 --> 00:37:50,622
It'd be pretty bitchin'.

768
00:37:53,878 --> 00:37:55,411
Glad to see everything's starting to

769
00:37:55,413 --> 00:37:57,046
get back to the way it was.

770
00:37:57,048 --> 00:38:00,115
Yeah. I mean...

771
00:38:00,117 --> 00:38:01,583
mostly.

772
00:38:01,585 --> 00:38:03,335
You have nothing to worry about, Cait.

773
00:38:03,337 --> 00:38:05,671
I think out of everyone,
actually, you're the only one

774
00:38:05,673 --> 00:38:09,224
that wasn't really affected
when I messed with the timeline.

775
00:38:09,226 --> 00:38:12,561
I mean, unless you're secretly moonlighting

776
00:38:12,563 --> 00:38:13,812
as an ophthalmologist.

777
00:38:13,814 --> 00:38:16,181
- A what?
- Kidding, nothing.

778
00:38:16,183 --> 00:38:18,567
Just a Flashpoint joke. I'll see you later.

779
00:38:33,834 --> 00:38:35,117
- What's that?
- That's the finished

780
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,453
Edward Clariss report.

781
00:38:37,455 --> 00:38:39,254
Or should I say The Rival?

782
00:38:39,256 --> 00:38:40,706
At least, that's what The Flash called him

783
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:42,791
last night when he took him
into Iron Heights.

784
00:38:42,793 --> 00:38:44,093
- Huh.
- I thought you might

785
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:45,260
want to see it.

786
00:38:45,262 --> 00:38:46,712
You know, to do with your other case.

787
00:38:46,714 --> 00:38:50,766
Actually it turns out
there was no connection.

788
00:38:50,768 --> 00:38:52,301
Hm.

789
00:38:52,303 --> 00:38:53,619
You know, I have to ask you.

790
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:54,853
Hm?

791
00:38:54,855 --> 00:38:57,556
- How did you know his name?
- What?

792
00:38:57,558 --> 00:38:59,475
Yesterday, you came in and you asked

793
00:38:59,477 --> 00:39:02,394
for Edward Clariss' report,
but I didn't tell you

794
00:39:02,396 --> 00:39:05,898
who that husk belonged to, so that means

795
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:11,653
you stole a sample when you
showed up to my crime scene.

796
00:39:11,655 --> 00:39:14,206
How did you do that?

797
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:18,994
- I...
- Oh, wow.

798
00:39:18,996 --> 00:39:22,464
You've really got this good guy
routine thing down, haven't you?

799
00:39:22,466 --> 00:39:26,135
And everyone just buys it.

800
00:39:26,137 --> 00:39:31,473
There is something
not right about you, Allen.

801
00:39:31,475 --> 00:39:36,395
They don't see it... but I do.

802
00:39:36,397 --> 00:39:39,348
- Is that right?
- Yes.

803
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:43,185
You know why I don't
actually like you, don't you?

804
00:39:45,689 --> 00:39:47,856
I don't trust you.

805
00:39:47,858 --> 00:39:51,193
And I don't like things that I don't trust.

806
00:39:55,032 --> 00:39:58,917
See you tomorrow, roomie.

807
00:40:05,125 --> 00:40:06,875
- Hey.
- Hey.

808
00:40:06,877 --> 00:40:10,295
Hi.

809
00:40:10,297 --> 00:40:13,048
I was hoping you'd be here.

810
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:16,435
Yeah. Dad and I just polished off

811
00:40:16,437 --> 00:40:17,686
Grandma Esther's noodle dish.

812
00:40:17,688 --> 00:40:19,972
Oh, did you leave me some?

813
00:40:19,974 --> 00:40:21,723
- Too slow, Flash.
- Ooh.

814
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,514
So you guys are...?

815
00:40:32,536 --> 00:40:34,286
We're good.

816
00:40:37,575 --> 00:40:42,160
Are you sure you don't wanna
know about the other timeline?

817
00:40:42,162 --> 00:40:46,715
No, I guess, in my mind, wherever you go,

818
00:40:46,717 --> 00:40:49,084
you'll always be Barry,

819
00:40:49,086 --> 00:40:50,919
and I'll always be Iris.

820
00:40:53,757 --> 00:40:55,841
And we always find each other.

821
00:41:30,861 --> 00:41:33,211
You failed.

822
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:42,220
You failed, Clariss.

823
00:41:42,222 --> 00:41:44,806
I'm sorry. Please...

824
00:41:44,808 --> 00:41:48,610
let me try again.

825
00:41:48,612 --> 00:41:50,529
Alchemy!

826
00:41:50,531 --> 00:41:52,814
No, no, no, no, no.

827
00:41:53,934 --> 00:41:56,518
No!
