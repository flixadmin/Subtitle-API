1
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:12,544
Shendu: The portal of
xiao fung, the wind demon,

2
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:15,514
lies upon the seventh
land mass,

3
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:19,318
4,000,001 cubits above
the Southern hemisphere,

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,453
beyond the placid forest,

5
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:24,690
nestled between
the rolling hills.

6
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:29,294
Uh, the only thing
I see nestlin'--

7
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:32,531
is hollow lands
penitentiary.

8
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,267
Valmont:
Do you mean to tell us
that the demon portal

9
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:38,604
lies somewhere within
those prison walls, shendu?

10
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:43,108
Shendu:
Do not take that tone
with me, valmont.

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,211
I did not build
the fortress.

12
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,280
I've heard of
bustin' <i> outta</i> jail,

13
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:49,615
but breakin' in?

14
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:51,517
No problem. I did
a stretch here.

15
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:53,919
Rumor has it there
are miles of tunnels
under the joint.

16
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:57,122
The pan ku box
mentioned no tunnels.

17
00:00:57,124 --> 00:01:00,426
And I will not waste time
chasing windmills

18
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:05,464
when we can simply
allow ourselves to be
taken prisoner.

19
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,566
Oh, no.
I don't wanna go back.

20
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,491
Valmont and his pals
have been spotted
downtown.

21
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,126
You in, Jackie?
We're there.

22
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:08,727
Is your name Jackie?

23
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,095
(Scoffs)

24
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:12,898
Captain black,
I thought all
dark hand matters

25
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,167
had been reassigned
to section 12.

26
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,269
That may be so,
but I'm not gonna
sit pretty

27
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:19,171
while the dark hand
strolls into my backyard

28
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:21,907
to hand a hall pass
to a hobgoblin.

29
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,978
Captain black is
in the house!

30
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,314
(Strained groans)

31
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,351
Valmont: As the head
of an international
crime syndicate,

32
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:34,820
I refuse to
expose myself

33
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,388
by robbing
a common bank.

34
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,125
Shendu: You seem
to forget, valmont,

35
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:42,528
that in the event
of a stalemate,

36
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,164
I win.

37
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,866
Well?!

38
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:52,204
Must I remind you
that the portal
cannot be opened

39
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:57,409
without the pan ku box,
which I cannot touch?!

40
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,248
Valmont: Let's
get this over with.

41
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,453
Capt. Black:
Freeze, valmont!

42
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,959
All: We surrender.

43
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:16,295
You do?
You do?

44
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,363
Capt. Black:
Take 'em away.

45
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,867
(Chanting Chinese
incantation)

46
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,239
What do you think,
uncle--ow!

47
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:29,107
Do you see
any demons?

48
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,442
Nooo.

49
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,511
That is because this
is a bank vault,

50
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:35,981
not a demon portal!

51
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:39,117
And for your long career
of federal crimes,

52
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,453
I sentence you
to 50 years in hollow lands

53
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,356
maximum-security prison.

54
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:47,559
(Finn sobbing)

55
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:51,330
Yes, the dark hand
has been successfully
shut down, sir, but--

56
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:53,565
thank you.
We are proud, sir.

57
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,200
But I want
to recommend
that valmont

58
00:03:55,202 --> 00:03:57,536
be reassigned
to another prison
immediately.

59
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:59,671
I have reason to believe
that he orchestrated

60
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,206
their appointment
to hollow lands

61
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:05,177
in order to locate
a demon portal.

62
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:10,215
No, sir, I've never
received psychological
counseling. Why?

63
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:12,351
Breathe deeply.

64
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,156
Eww, are you
wearing Cologne?

65
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,391
Capt. Black:
Aftershave.

66
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,293
They didn't
believe you,
did they?

67
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:23,862
(Sighs)
And if we can't
stop the demon

68
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,430
by moving
valmont out,

69
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,899
we are going to
have to move in.

70
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,435
You don't really
mean <i> we,</i> do you?

71
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,238
You in?
Cool! You're
going undercover!

72
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,874
Bu-but, I don't want
to be a prison guard.

73
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:39,444
Not a guard,
Jackie, an inmate.

74
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,914
Clearly, it's
- of the utmost importance
that valmont and his men

75
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,417
not recognize you,
Jackie.

76
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,686
Uh, the--the guards
and warden

77
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,888
will know who
I really am. Right?

78
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,723
Jackie, no can do.

79
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:54,092
This is completely
under the radar.

80
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,095
Kepler: Smile.

81
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,065
Bwoah--ooh!

82
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,469
Oh!

83
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,305
Don't worry,

84
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:07,372
all you need
to do

85
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,441
is mix your way
into valmont's
gang

86
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,310
and get ahold of
that pan ku box

87
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,045
before they
open the portal
with it.

88
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:15,480
Oh, is that all?

89
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,317
Say ahhh.

90
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,153
Aah!

91
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:24,222
Jackie chan,
meet chance Jackson,

92
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,425
master criminal.

93
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:28,360
Prison is full of
hard cases, Jackie.

94
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:30,128
Your disguise
is foolproof.

95
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,230
(Scoffs, snorts)

96
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:34,966
Hey, Jackie, you off
to the big house?

97
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,668
Wha--ut--grr!

98
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,138
Uh, good luck, chance.

99
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,642
If things get dicey,
just call and say
the password,

100
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:44,876
chinchilla.

101
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,446
Uh, what's a chinchilla?

102
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:48,980
Oh, captain black,

103
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:51,083
your supervisors
have requested

104
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:53,318
that we speak
with you, <i> ja?</i>

105
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:05,430
Valmont: We can't
find the portal
until the pan ku box arrives,

106
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,632
so we will just
have to wait.

107
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:10,135
Well, we could've been
traipsing our way out
through those tunnels

108
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:11,737
with our demon
of the week by now.

109
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:14,005
<i>Alleged</i> tunnels.

110
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,808
Anything's better
than doin' time,
right, ratso?

111
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,311
Come on, let's
- toss a few before lunch.

112
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,646
(Eagerly)
They're serving
gruel again.

113
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,051
What? It's fun-food.

114
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,253
Bingo.

115
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,321
(Gruffly)
Bingo!

116
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,692
Unh. Ooh, sorry.

117
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:37,229
(American accent)
Er, sorry I didn't
rearrange your molecules!

118
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,798
Watch where you're
goin' next time.

119
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,733
So, uh, what
are you in for?

120
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,868
Go away.

121
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,036
Chance Jackson,
safecracker.

122
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,104
Big whoop!

123
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:49,141
I crack them
with my head.

124
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:55,247
Hmm. You like baseball?

125
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,416
Ho ho, do I!

126
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,575
Aww, you guys
oughta give chance
a chance.

127
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:24,943
He's one of us.

128
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,946
Probably why
he reminds me
of somebody.

129
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,552
Howdy, guys.
Chance!

130
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:35,420
You wrangled
kitchen duty.

131
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,562
Supplies!
Everyone back!

132
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,544
At ease.

133
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,746
A bit obvious, but--

134
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:07,752
what?!

135
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:10,555
Hey, that's the warden's
birthday cake!

136
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,325
You just won a free trip
to solitary.

137
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:17,963
Shendu, mentally:
Valmont, you are
an imbecile!

138
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,398
Uh-oh.

139
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,667
Well, it's
gotta be somewhere.

140
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:32,010
P.A.: All inmates report
to mess hall for lunch.

141
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:45,524
You're in safe hands now.

142
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:46,591
(Gasps)

143
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,400
No!

144
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,702
Goo--oh--aargh!

145
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,114
(Roaring, growling)

146
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,285
H-hello.

147
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:16,421
I am free!

148
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,471
Whoa. We struck demon.

149
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:38,677
Not any demon.
Xiao fung, demon
of the wind.

150
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,912
Uh, like
breakin' wind?

151
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,151
(Cries out)

152
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:47,519
Ooh-oh!

153
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:50,522
Like breaking bones.

154
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,826
You care to explain
the swipe-and-run, chance?

155
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,395
Easy on him.
He found our boy.

156
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:58,463
Yeah!

157
00:09:58,465 --> 00:09:59,898
Good instincts,
buddy.

158
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,668
So, uh, what's
with tumble dry?

159
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:08,607
Ahh, the sweet
scent of freedom.

160
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:11,676
Uh, actually,
your breeziness, sir,

161
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,878
you're not exactly free.

162
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,246
No?

163
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:18,583
You're in
the hoosegow.
Prison.

164
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:21,052
This prison is paradise

165
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:24,456
compared to the ghastly
abyss I have escaped.

166
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,191
Whatever
you say, chief,

167
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:27,892
but outside's
even better.

168
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,095
Beaches, movies...

169
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,230
Yeah, so why don't you
huff and puff

170
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,865
and blow
this big house down?

171
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,800
No! I--I mean...

172
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,837
You can't leave
without your boss,
can you?

173
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:40,805
Where is shendu?

174
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,707
Uh, shendu's
in valmont...

175
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,709
And valmont's
in solitary.

176
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:48,513
Hmm. If I do not
free this valmont,

177
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,848
I will be burdened

178
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,083
with freeing
- my brothers and sisters.

179
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,585
Very well.

180
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,626
Whoa, you guys
can do that?

181
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,662
Concealment seems prudent.

182
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,431
Demons appear to stick out
like sore thumbs

183
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,433
in this modern world.

184
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:11,670
Ooh, he's gonna blend in
undercover-like.

185
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:12,837
Get it, chance?

186
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,206
Uh, got it.

187
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:24,049
Uh, chinchilla.

188
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:27,018
What's a chinchilla?
That's the password.

189
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,921
Just get me
captain black.

190
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:33,558
What do you mean,
he can't be disturbed?

191
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,061
Demon.

192
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,629
I see a demon.

193
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:41,132
And this one?

194
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,735
Socks worn by
a really big demon.

195
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:50,642
(American accent)
Uncle, it's, uh,
me, your nephew.

196
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:53,344
What? It does not
sound like you.

197
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:56,548
What do you mean
you are in prison?

198
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,719
You are
a bad influence
on Jade.

199
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:03,688
Good thing it
is not really you.

200
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,126
Who was that, uncle?

201
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,661
Eh, crank call.

202
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:11,062
Prince Albert in a can?

203
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,332
No, crazy talk about
demons and prisons.

204
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:19,404
(Gasps)
Ai-yaah!

205
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,474
We're gonna
create a diversion

206
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:24,909
so we can sneak
into solitary.

207
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,010
What's the plan?

208
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,314
Both: Food fight!

209
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,483
(All yell)

210
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,763
Ratso: Psst. Chance.

211
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,097
Let's break for it.

212
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,772
(American accent)
So, we goin' or what?

213
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,643
I liked you.

214
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:01,246
(Normal voice)
Uh-oh.

215
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:04,582
Hey, xiao,
meet Jackie chan.

216
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,851
Nemesis
to my brethren?

217
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,853
Ooh!

218
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,622
What just
happened here?

219
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,691
Never mind. Solitary.

220
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:17,028
Aah! Unh!

221
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,930
Jade:
Hi, Jackie.

222
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:21,099
Jade? Uncle?

223
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,903
How?

224
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:29,674
Tohru: Invisibility,
levitation, speed.

225
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,242
I borrowed some talismans

226
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,077
so we could bust you
out of the slammer.

227
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,046
Oh! Well, I don't
want to be out.

228
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:37,949
I want to be in
where the wind demon is.

229
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,685
Hmm. The fan
is the symbol

230
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:41,986
belonging
to the immortal

231
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,956
who originally
banished
the wind demon.

232
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,293
I must gather
chi spell
ingredients.

233
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:49,694
But there's no time.

234
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,763
Duh.

235
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,203
Ooh! Yaah!

236
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,442
Whoa-oh!

237
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,411
Unh, oh.

238
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,847
Oh, some
set of pipes.

239
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,652
The, uh,
valmont suite.

240
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:22,427
Ah, greetings,
brother xiao.

241
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:25,897
See? I knew
there were tunnels.

242
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,933
But I just broke out!

243
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:31,669
I demand to be thrown
into solitary.

244
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,738
I don't recognize him.

245
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,008
What's your
prisoner number?

246
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,943
Ohh!

247
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,482
Jade.

248
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,084
Jade.

249
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,552
(Alarm blares)
The dragon talisman

250
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,953
is very dangerous.

251
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,722
Talk later.
Chinchilla.

252
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,959
So, that's
a chinchilla.
Cute.

253
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,839
Change him back.

254
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:09,040
Fire in the hole.

255
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,075
Jade, stay here.

256
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,778
Tch, in a prison?

257
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,180
Well--ohh.

258
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,383
The way out's
gotta be that way.

259
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,518
Nah, we just
came from there.

260
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,087
Shendu,
I have had enough

261
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,490
of your lost
expedition!

262
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:30,929
Valmont: Shendu, your brother
is speaking to you.

263
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,331
Do not follow
so closely, Jade,

264
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:37,335
and pay attention
to everything I do.

265
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,803
Waah!

266
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:41,739
So good to see you again.

267
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:43,942
In fact...

268
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,844
I'm all a-bluster.

269
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,785
(Inhales)

270
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,088
Back off, froggy!

271
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:01,559
Both: Aah!

272
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:05,196
Both: Waah!

273
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:06,631
Both: Unh!

274
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,368
(Xiao roars)
Both: Aah!

275
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,439
(Inhales)

276
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,241
(Grunts)

277
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,679
(Grunts, gasps)

278
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,781
Where is uncle?!

279
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,251
Uncle: I am sorry.

280
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,854
I will bring this back.
Thank you.

281
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,526
Put a cork in it!

282
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37,228
(Exhales)

283
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,596
Aah!
Chinchil--
aah!

284
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,500
(Gasps)
Uh-oh.

285
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,135
Uncle: Ai-yaaah!

286
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:47,005
We will never find them.

287
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,075
Both: Whoa!

288
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:54,479
Unh. Ai-yaah.

289
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,481
Uncle, quickly!

290
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:58,516
Ah, Jackie.
There you are.

291
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,584
Where is he?

292
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,653
(Gasps)

293
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:06,090
You are going
to be sorry!

294
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:17,668
Xiao fung, the chi spell
will seal your doom!

295
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,772
One cannot cast
what one cannot catch.

(Inhales)

297
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,842
Wait! Let us get
out of the way!

00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,844

The talisman!

302
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,736
Rabbit talisman
is very good,

303
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,872
but demon breath
is better.

304
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:59,010

It's working!

Nooo!

327
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,255

to the wind
in the willows

329
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,691
for Mr. toad.

330
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,726
Now, before
we head home,

331
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,495
we must retrieve
the talismans.

332
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:58,729
Ooh, right.

333
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,266
Huh?

334
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,801
What do you know?

335
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,503
His prisoner number
checks out.

336
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,271
You're gettin'
your wish, Jackson.

337
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,340
It's solitary for you.

338
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:10,675
Uh, what? No!

339
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,677
I-I'm not
chance Jackson!

340
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:15,813
Look at my face!
My face!

341
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:21,319
Chinchilla!
Chinchilla!

342
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:27,191
Hey, Jackie,

343
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:28,526
if you could
be an animal,

344
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:29,827
which animal
would you be?

345
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,163
I wanna be a eagle.

346
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:36,367
I remember, uh, I have
a--a eagle about this big.

347
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:39,670
Way up to look down.
Ok, nobody can chase you.

348
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:42,173
Very free, you know,
wherever I wanna go.

349
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:47,111
I think eagle. Yes,
that's the best animal
I would be.
