1
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:14,208
<i>She cares so deeply
about each and every one of you.</i>

2
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:18,875
<i>She would like you to know
that our marriage is deeply...</i>

3
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:23,333
{\an8}<i>...profoundly, and terminally fucked.</i>

4
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,708
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

5
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,333
<i>Absolutely right.</i>

6
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:30,083
<i>So you can all stop
comparing yourselves to us, you can.</i>

7
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,041
<i>And you know what? You can...</i>

8
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,000
<i>Stop being the giant...</i>

9
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,833
<i>I'm not available right now,
please leave a message.</i>

10
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,791
Hello, Enid. Um...

11
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:40,791
{\an8}I've been trying you,
and I'm now trying you again.

12
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:41,875
{\an8}Um...

13
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:46,208
You're probably
still recovering from yesterday,

14
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:48,416
as we all are, so...

15
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,750
<i>I mean, how many women do you know</i>

16
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,041
<i>who would to frame their husbands
for murder?</i>

17
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,291
Tag's mortified.

18
00:00:56,333 --> 00:00:59,583
He's committed to a publicity triage.

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,333
And I'd like it if we can all
have a session this afternoon

20
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:08,208
just to come up with some sort of plan.

21
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,333
So give me a call back, would you, Enid?

22
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:13,333
Thank you.

Hi.

29
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:35,208
You're up early.

30
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:36,875
How's your head?

31
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:41,875
I wasn't that drunk.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,833
Hey.

33
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:13,958
It's early. Go back to sleep.

34
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,250
I'm just going out for a run.

35
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:22,916
Have fun.

36
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:33,500
Right.

37
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:35,333
Wow.

38
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:37,583
Unexpected.

39
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,708
You two.

40
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:40,708
Um...

41
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:44,083
Can you just step out
for a second, please, Benji?

42
00:02:44,166 --> 00:02:45,166
Uh, yeah. Sure.

43
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:57,958
Listen, um, forgive my bluntness,

44
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,541
but actually, did you ever...

45
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:02,125
Um, did Merritt, did she ever use drugs?

46
00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:07,541
-No. Why?
-Hmm.

47
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:11,083
Apparently she had quite a high level
of barbiturates in her system.

48
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,291
Barbiturates?

49
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,375
She didn't use them recreationally?

50
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,416
No. No. She's not, um...

51
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,125
No. Definitely not. That is not...

52
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,583
No.

53
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:40,666
Mom?

54
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,291
Mom!

55
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,750
The cops are here.

56
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,291
Good morning, Mrs. Winbury.

57
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,541
We'd like you to come down to the station
and answer a few questions.

58
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:06,958
Yes, of course.

59
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:08,708

70
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:50,458
Go.

71
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,583
Behind you.

72
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,916
Come on. Yep.

73
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,666
-Dad?
-Yeah, I'm... I'm right here, Will.

74
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,708
They're taking all of Mom's shit.
Are you gonna do something about it?

75
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,791
-We can't, Will.
-Why can't we?

76
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,916
Well, for one thing, they're the police.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,958
But they're taking her computer.
That's got all...

78
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,916
Will, can you stop
asking questions, please?

79
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,875
-We need to call her team, the PR people.
-We need to call a defense attorney.

80
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,291
Why would we call a defense attorney
if she's not guilty?

81
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:19,541
Why don't you... Why don't you just go get
ready for your sailing thing, okay, kiddo?

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,875
- It's a race!
- Okay.

83
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:47,375
{\an8}My dad won't lend me the money.

84
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:51,666
{\an8}Um, I just bought a house
in Aix-en-Provence.

85
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,041
So you have to start reimbursing me.

86
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,125
I know. I will, I will, I promise.

87
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,458
-I'm about to get my trust fund.
-Mmm.

88
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:06,083
That's very lucky for you.

89
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,125
Isn't it?

90
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,416
Hey, babe. Yep, I'm just on the way back.

91
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,125
Wait, what?

92
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:27,791
And they took her computer and stuff? Why?

93
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,416
Friend of yours?

94
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,333
No.

95
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,875
-But you do know him.
-Barely.

96
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:39,708
Well,
his name is Broderick Graham,

97
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,583
and, uh, he has quite a résumé.

98
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,041
Petty theft, assault, possession,

99
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:49,041
and lately, he's been running with a gang
with known ties to the Turkish Mafia,

100
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:53,125
so that's heroin trade,
I don't know, hits for hire.

101
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,958
"Hits for hire"?

102
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:01,791
Mrs. Winbury, we believe that you hired
Broderick Graham to kill Merritt Monaco

103
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,208
and convinced Shooter Dival to pay for it

104
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:08,125
so he could shield you from blame
and claim diplomatic immunity.

105
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,583
Ah...

106
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,833
So you're not just
gonna tell us what happened?

107
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,250
Because we already know.

108
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,166
Yeah, we, uh,
have an APB out on Mr. Graham,

109
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,541
and, as you know, it's not a big island.

110
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:22,583
And we're working on getting around
Mr. Dival's immunity, and we will.

111
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,083
Mr. Dival has nothing to do with this,
and neither do I.

112
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,208
So you're wasting your time.

113
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,250
Huh.

114
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,708
Okay, well...

115
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,166
-Just excuse us for just...
-One minute.

116
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,000
-We'll be right back.
-Yeah.

117
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:42,041
Yeah.

118
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,375
-Is Tom back yet?
-What?

119
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,250
-Is Tom back yet?
-I don't fucking know.

120
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,041
Yeah, uh, just send me his number.

121
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,041
-There's a million reporters out there.
-Hold on a second.

122
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,916
-What are you doing?
-I... I can't leave.

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,750
There's so many reporters,
I can't even get out of the gate.

124
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,041
Sweetheart, you're gonna miss your race.

125
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,333
Can I call you back? Yeah.

126
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,041
Why don't you have
any comment for reporters?

127
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,666
Where were you
when the murder took place?

128
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,083
Mrs. Winbury,
how do you feel about all this?

129
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,583
Any comment on the body
found on your property?

130
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:27,833
Is your wife a suspect?

131
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:28,916
Hello, everyone!

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,625
Hi. I'm sorry,
but you're actually on private property.

133
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:35,083
Is it true you were having an affair
with Merritt Monaco?

134
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,625
All the way back to the road.

135
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,958
Just move back, please. Thank you!

136
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,916
Is Mrs. Winbury
being questioned by the police?

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,583
Why is your wife
being questioned by the police?

138
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:44,708
Back the fuck up!

139
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,500
Thomas, where are you coming from?

140
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,291
Get the fuck out of the way.
Move! All right?

141
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,083
Back up!
Just get away from the fucking gate!

142
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,750
Jesus fucking Christ! Fucking jackals.

143
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,291
Please, just back away
from the fucking gate.

144
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,875
Try to remember you're on camera.

145
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,750
You gotta be tough with these guys, man.

146
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,000
Sure.

147
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,625
Back the fuck off!

148
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,500
Are you protecting Greer Winbury?

149
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,875
You heard him, fuck off!

150
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:13,583
-Thank you, sweetie.
-Don't.

151
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,625
-The public is here to know!
-Is anyone else in your family involved?

152
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,541
The Winbury family
is just not cooperating...

153
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:23,708
A run?

154
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,541
Really?

155
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:28,250
Would you stop being so fucking paranoid?

156
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,041
Your mom's being questioned by the police,

157
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,708
the press are jonesing for a hit,

158
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,791
and you're off
sticking it in some French whore?

159
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,416
Abby, calm down.

160
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,125
I will not calm down! You calm down!
You calm your dick down!

161
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:40,208
Whoa! Babe!

162
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,666
I would not do that to you. Come on.

163
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,625
I'm not gonna hook up
with some crazy French lady my dad knows.

164
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,500
Babe! Come on!

165
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:52,875
I love you!

166
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,583
Abby, I'm not stupid.

167
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,500
I love you!

168
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:00,583
Abby.

169
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,333
Come here.

170
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,875
{\an8}- I just can't fucking believe this.
- I mean,

171
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,625
she's not the first person
I'd want to have a beer with,

172
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,083
but I don't think she's capable of that.

173
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,250
Well, I don't think so either,

174
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,541
but at this point, I don't know
what else could have happened.

175
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,708
I mean, how could she have barbiturates
in her system?

176
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,291
Honey, none of us knows anything
right now.

177
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:33,000
I think it's important that we just
not jump to any conclusions. All right?

178
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,458
If you don't know Mr. Graham well,

179
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:56,458
why has he called your house
nine times over the last four days?

180
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,708
Maybe he was looking for Shooter Dival?

181
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,041
I mean, Mr. Dival knows him well.

182
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,916
Well enough to wire him $300,000.

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,250
To what, though? To pay him
to kill Merritt Monaco on your behalf?

184
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,583
Um...

185
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:20,625
Broderick's, he's an old associate.

186
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,541
I've known him for a very long time.

187
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:25,250
He called me.
He was desperate. Desperate for money.

188
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,041
And I didn't have access
to it at the time,

189
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:31,875
so I asked Shooter for a loan.

190
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,000
-Very generous.
-Hmm.

191
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,208
When we questioned you the other day,

192
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:39,833
you said you went to bed at 1:30
the night Miss Monaco died.

193
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,666
But we have a landline phone call

194
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:49,458
from your office
to Mr. -08 a.m.

195
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:54,583
Now, do you often call your associates
at that time of night?

196
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:56,458
Uh...

197
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:28,041
Can't I just tell the cops that
I didn't know what the money was for?

198
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,791
I still don't.
She needed a favor. I didn't ask why.

199
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,125
Then let's see
what the cops actually know.

200
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:36,458
These people
have been like family to me. You know?

201
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,625
<i>Like</i> family.

202
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,458
$300,000 is a lot of money
for most people.

203
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,166
Right.

204
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,458
Now, why did you want
Mr. Graham to have it?

205
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,541
I've known him a very long time.

206
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,875
And Mr. Dival,
is that why he loaned you the money?

207
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,375
Because he's known you
for a long time too?

208
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,458
Ah, he...

209
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,375
He actually, um...

210
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,125
We're very close.

211
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,958
He gave me a loan
because he knows I'll pay it back.

212
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,125
How close?

213
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,125
He's like a son to me.

214
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,958
Yeah. I mean, I... I have a son.

215
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,333
But I don't think he's ever done anything
in his whole life just 'cause I asked.

216
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,416
Hmm.

217
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,208
Thank you.

218
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,625
-Hey.
<i>-Hi.</i>

219
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:01,833
Um...

220
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:09,375
I'm really sorry
about how confused I've been.

221
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,708
I haven't been fair to you or to Benji.

222
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,791
It just feels like...

223
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:20,458
everything's my fault
and everything's going wrong and just...

224
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,250
<i>I don't want to do this anymore.</i>

225
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,583
I'm sorry. I...

226
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,166
I don't even know who I am right now.

227
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,083
But I know who I used to be, you know? I...

228
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,333
<i>-I need to get back to that.</i>
-Okay.

229
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:53,708
I need to get back
to the girl on the B Train.

230
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:57,833
I remember you.

231
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,791
You were right. That was me.

232
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,208
I know.

233
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,625
Okay.

234
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,416
Bye.

235
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:22,666
<i>Bye.</i>

236
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,000
Oh, my God.

237
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:58,625
Bruce?

238
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,750
Bruce!

239
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:23,000
Mr. Tag, sorry to bother,
but Miss Collins, I tried to tell her...

240
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,333
Gosia, darling.

241
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,833
-Tag!
-Enid, how are you?

242
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,000
-I brought the cavalry.
-Hi.

243
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,541
Uh, yeah, I can see.
We've been expecting you.

244
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,541
Where's my Greer?

245
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,083
Uh, she had a few things to do in town.

246
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,958
A few things in town.
A few things in town.

247
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,375
"Author Garrison Winbury,

248
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,541
person of interest
in Merritt Monaco murder,

249
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,833
stranger than fiction."

250
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:47,083
-Jesus, who writes this copy?
-Is this true?

251
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,583
They're just talking to her.

252
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,458
They came and took her early this morning.

253
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:55,333
They got her computer, her laptop.
Total ambush.

254
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:59,125
Small-town police chief
trying to make a name for himself.

255
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:02,125
It's... All of it, it's just grotesque.

256
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:06,250
Obviously, I mean, if we'd had some
advance notice, we would've called you.

257
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,666
Of course you would have.

258
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,625
We just have to start from where we are.

259
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:11,958
- Let's dive in.
- Yes.

260
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:12,958
No wrong answers.

261
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:16,041
Where does your gut go first?

262
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:20,291
You know, actually, I think we can spin
the murder-suspect thing. It's very meta.

263
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:25,625
You know, we're actually more concerned
about your revelations from yesterday.

264
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,125
"Revelations"?

265
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:29,666
What did I say?

266
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,750
That you and Greer do threesomes, for one?

267
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:36,666
-Oh, well...
-See, we sold you as the perfect couple.

268
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,833
Which is hot
for your cishet monogamous demo.

269
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:43,500
Right, but not the perfect thruple,
which is hot for Brad's demo.

270
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,583
Thank you.

271
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:47,541
Thruple?

272
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,375
Yeah.

273
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:55,708
Oh, isn't he looking tired?
Tag, you need to rest.

274
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,083
Hmm.

275
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,875
Yeah.

276
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,208
Sorry to interrupt.

277
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:07,208
You're not. I've gotten straighter answers
from my kids after a class trip.

278
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,791
Deputies pulled this guy
off the puddle jumper.

279
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,875
Lookee here. Mr. Graham.

280
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:14,291
Welcome.

281
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,833
I don't know what she's told you,
but I didn't do nothing.

282
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,333
Carl, would you get Mr. Graham
a chair, please?

283
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,583
Sure.

284
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:26,166
And you can, uh, you can put it right here
near Mrs. Winbury.

285
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,208
Please, have a seat.

286
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
There you go.

287
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:33,666
Thank you.

288
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,458
Thank you, Carl. We're good.

289
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:45,583
I am really curious to know...

290
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,250
how you two know each other.

291
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,083
We don't.

292
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:54,291
Right?

293
00:18:55,041 --> 00:19:01,958
Then why did Mrs. Winbury
have Shooter Dival wire you $300,000?

294
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,333
Well, that was a gift.

295
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:11,916
Okay, why would anyone gift you $300,000?

296
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,125
Because I asked very nicely.

297
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:20,000
You're out of your depth, Broderick.

298
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,083
Oh, look. We do know each other.

299
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,916
I want to make something very clear.

300
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,791
I didn't blackmail anyone.

301
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,333
- Okay.
- Out it comes.

302
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,166
-I'm so glad you said that out loud.
-Thank you for clearing that up.

303
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,375
-I'm gonna write that down.
-You got that? Yeah, write it down.

304
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,333
"Didn't blackmail anyone."

305
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,125
- Got it.
- Good to know.

306
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,416
-They're taking the piss out of you.
-You think?

307
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:50,041
We've all been under
a considerable amount of stress

308
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:53,625
because of the, uh, accident

309
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,458
and postponing the wedding.

310
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,833
And because of that pressure,

311
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:05,750
I have given in to the very human weakness
of, uh, an alcohol problem.

312
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:06,666
And weed.

313
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,458
-No. That's...
-We're just going to keep it simple.

314
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,750
Alcohol.

315
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:11,958
And?

316
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,208
And I love my family.

317
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,583
I love my family.
I love my wife. I love our marriage.

318
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:19,416
Because of that,
I've made the very difficult decision

319
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,083
to spend the next few weeks
reflecting and healing

320
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,333
at Promises, Malibu.

321
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:27,541
-No. Uh-uh. It's not relatable. New Era.
-Hmm.

322
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,208
- The one in New Haven?
- Yeah.

323
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,791
No, absolutely not. It's a shithole.

324
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:33,791
-It's supposed to be nice.
-No, no, no. Thomas?

325
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,666
It's a shithole. I went there. Bad people.

326
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,750
- It's a rehab.
- Yeah.

327
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,500
Can I tell them I'm going to New Haven
and go to the one in Malibu?

328
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,166
-No.
-Okay.

329
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:49,625
So, I think you should try it
maybe without the drink in your hand.

330
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,625
-It's a good idea.
-That's a good idea.

331
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,583
I wasn't going to have the drink
in my hand when I do it...

332
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,041
- No, I know, but it's a crutch.
- Okay.

333
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,916
It's constructive criticism.

334
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,416
We've all been under
a considerable amount of emotional stress

335
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,791
because of the accident.

336
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,125
Because of that pressure,

337
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:12,208
I've given in to the very human weakness
of an alcohol addiction.

338
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:15,208
And because of that,
I've made the very difficult decision

339
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:19,166
to spend the next few weeks
reflecting and healing at...

340
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,666
New Era in New Haven.

341
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,833
-How many times is he...
-It's pretty rough.

342
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:27,375
It's great. Really good.

343
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:29,916
Yay!

344
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:36,250
Right.

345
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,291
You know what I want to know?

346
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,000
What does he have over you, Mrs. Winbury?

347
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,500
Does he know
that you murdered Merritt Monaco,

348
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,000
or did you pay him to do it?

349
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,833
- Did you kill the girl?
- Shut up!

350
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,166
No, please, don't shut up, keep talking.

351
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:00,958
Yeah.

352
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,250
That mean that I get immunity?

353
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,208
Huh?

354
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,708
Do you need immunity?

355
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,083
Do I?

356
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:16,833
Hey, Chief.

357
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:19,500
-I got Shooter Dival and his lawyer.
-Okay.

358
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:20,750
Don't drag him into this.

359
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,541
-He's got nothing to do with it.
-Thanks.

360
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:23,875
Really, just let him go.

361
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,291
Someone's got to tell us
what the money is for.

362
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,875
He doesn't know what it's for.
It was a loan.

363
00:22:28,958 --> 00:22:33,041
I had to pay off a fucking debt!
A $300,000 debt!

364
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,625
Because this fucking idiot is my brother.

365
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,125
He has a gambling addiction.

366
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:42,208
I have been paying off his debts
for years. This is the reason.

367
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:44,458
It's as simple as that. So there it is.

368
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,125
He's your brother?

369
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,708
What? Don't you see the resemblance?

370
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,833
Okay, so, um...

371
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:15,791
What is your association
with this Turkish gang?

372
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:18,041
-God knows.
-I fix things for them.

373
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,541
Are you their errand boy?
Get them coffee or some shit?

374
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,333
-I ain't no fucking errand boy.
-No?

375
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:23,416
I do other things.

376
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,041
-Oh, please, no, tell us.
-Right.

377
00:23:26,125 --> 00:23:29,958
Well, it's not a gang.
You know, it's not a gang per se.

378
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,458
For whatever reason,
he owed them $300,000.

379
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:35,916
It's paid now,
so hopefully he is grateful.

380
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:40,583
And there is no more coming
despite this little visit.

381
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:42,916
Yeah. Thanks for that.

382
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:46,083
Well, if it's not a gang,
what is it?

383
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:52,208
It's like a group, innit?
It's like an organization.

384
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:54,208
Of criminals?

385
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:57,166
Right. So, what... What do you call

386
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:01,208
a group of organized people who do crimes?

387
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:06,833
I've got nothing to say.

388
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,708
-What did you say?
-I've got nothing to say.

389
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:12,708
About time.

390
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,291
All right. Um...

391
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,750
I suppose that wraps it up.

392
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:22,958
- What about my fucking plane ticket?
- Listen...

393
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:26,166
You are lucky
not to be leaving here in cuffs.

394
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,416
Mrs. Winbury.

395
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,541
You can go now.

396
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:31,958
-Thank you.
-What about me?

397
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:34,916
- Do you want me to take him with me?
- Yes, please.

398
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:41,833
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

399
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:46,583
Fuck!

400
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:52,625
-I did not see that coming. Nope.
-Neither did I.

401
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,958
-Back to square one.
-Shit!

402
00:24:57,625 --> 00:25:02,083
-I, uh, I'm gonna talk to Shooter Dival.
-Yeah. Yeah.

403
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:07,958
Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Dival.

404
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:10,708
Hopefully, now you can go and enjoy
some of the finer things

405
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:12,541
that our island has to offer.

406
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:14,875
Thanks, but I've been here
many times before.

407
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:17,791
Oh, really? It seems like such a long way.

408
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,458
From Manhattan?

409
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,250
Not really.

410
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:25,125
-Have a good one, Carl.
-Yeah, you too.

411
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:35,166
This is the one that's getting
maybe the most traction right now,

412
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,375
which I need you all to be prepared for.

413
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:39,166
That's not that bad.

414
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,916

415

-You want to hear that singing?

Hi.

420
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:53,250
It's all good.

421
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:56,583
This is, uh, Broderick Graham.

422
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:59,291
Broderick, say hello to everyone.

423
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:00,208
Yeah?

424
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:03,625
-Hello.
-Well, that's who called on the phone.

425
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:05,083
Uh, yes.

426
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,666
This is my brother.

427
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:13,541
What's he doing here?

428
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:15,500
- Your brother?
- Jesus Christ.

429
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,333
-Sorry, this guy's your brother?
-I didn't even know you had a brother.

430
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:23,125
Well, you wouldn't because, um...

431
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,791
I never told you.

432
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,375
Of course. Why would you?

433
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:29,958
Broderick, don't even bother looking
at the Monet. It's a fake.

434
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:31,500
It is?

435
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:34,791
Would you like us to leave?

436
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:38,333
-This seems to be a bit of a family...
-No, no, please. Enid, please.

437
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:39,541
Should I go upstairs?

438
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:43,291
No, no, no. No. I want you all to stay.
Would you please just sit down?

439
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:44,750
What are you doing?

440
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:46,333
I will bring refreshments?

441
00:26:46,416 --> 00:26:48,041
Um, not right now. Maybe later.

442
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:53,583
So, are we gonna sue the cops?
'Cause they can't just...

443
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:55,083
Are they saying you did it?

444
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:57,166
They didn't think that I killed Merritt.

445
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:03,000
They thought that, um,
I hired a hitman to kill Merritt.

446
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:08,916
Which I didn't!

447
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,375
-Of course.
-Of course you didn't.

448
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:13,250
- Honey, I just...
- Of course you didn't. It's just...

449
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:15,875
Honey, I just... There's a plan.

450
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:18,500
Uh... Barry and Cynthia
have written a statement...

451
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,833
-Hyacinth and Brad.
-"Barry" is fine.

452
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:24,500
They've written a statement
that I'm going to read.

453
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:26,625
I'm gonna go to rehab
and everything will be fine...

454
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:30,166
He'll do rehab, and then we will spin
this whole cop thing of yours.

455
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,000
Small town, thirsty cop. Done.

456
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:36,958
It's gonna be fine. Everything.
It's all gonna go back to the way it was.

457
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:38,083
Hmm!

458
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:40,958
No, it's not gonna go back
to the way it was.

459
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:43,708
I'm not going back to the way I was.

460
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:47,000
Because, really,
I've been living a lie, haven't I?

461
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,208
I'm far more colorful than that, aren't I?

462
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:51,166
It was a... It was a turn of phrase.

463
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,500
No, it was a threat, Tag.
That was a threat.

464
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:55,750
So, boys, gloves are off now.

465
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:59,541
Your father and I
didn't meet in a gallery opening.

466
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:02,416
-We met in a bar.
-What are you doing?

467
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,041
What am I doing?
I'm ripping the Band-Aid off.

468
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:07,583
Well, Tom and I met in a bar.

469
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:10,083
I worked in a bar.

470
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:14,000
-I, um, sometimes worked in a hotel.
-Sure you wanna tell this story in front...

471
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,708
- Yeah. I want to tell this.
- Where your mother comes from,

472
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:18,875
there weren't a lot of opportunities,

473
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:20,625
and so she had to work.

474
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:23,708
She worked very hard to support herself.

475
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:29,083
To support my entire family,
as I've always had to do, as I still do.

476
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:32,791
But, anyway, back to the point.
I was an escort.

477
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:36,708
-A very high-end escort...
-I had sex with men for money.

478
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:41,000
My brother organized the clientele,
and your father was one of those men.

479
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:44,083
-Fucking gross.
-Oh, my God.

480
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,250
I didn't pay.

481
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:56,166
-Come on, Tag.
-Well, the first time, technically...

482
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,750
-Yes. Did he pay?
-He paid.

483
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:59,916
-Yes. You did pay. Three times.
-You paid, mate.

484
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Three times.

485
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:04,083
All right? And now I pay for everything.

486
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:06,708
-What the fuck are you doing?!
-What does that matter? 'Cause...

487
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:09,375
-This is our home!
-No, I want them to keep filming.

488
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:13,208
Please, text, write, do whatever you want,
because I'm not living like this.

489
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:16,208
I'm not living in fear
of exposure anymore. Do you hear me?

490
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:20,166
I'm not living with your goddamn mess.
I'm not cleaning everything up for you.

491
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,583
I'm done with your ego.
I'm done with your bullshit. I am done.

492
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:25,083
Do you hear me? Done.

493
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:30,958
I'm not taking care of everything
for everyone anymore!

494
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:32,916
I'm done!

495
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:38,291
I'm done with living the lie.
So, there we go.

496
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:40,416
Phew!

497
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:42,583
That feels better.

498
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:54,875
And I will answer any questions
that you boys need answered

499
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:57,208
in the kitchen over a cup of tea.

500
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:02,458
And there is a book in this, Enid.

501
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:05,625
I've been working on it,
and it's gonna be fantastic.

502
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:10,416
Of course there's a book.
There's always a fucking book.

503
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,375
- Holy shit!
- All right.

504
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:15,375
Can I have my phone back?

505
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:18,291
I need to talk to you.

506
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:21,250
What?

507
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:23,625
Excuse me.
Did you say something about snacks?

508
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,750
Need to talk to you for a second, okay?

509
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:34,833
Okay.

510
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:40,750
So, just today your mom told me that
she brought three pills out here with her.

511
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:42,958
What pills?

512
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:45,416
They're...

513
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:47,375
They're for euthanasia.

514
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:51,458
-Dad, what the fuck?
-I know. I know. I know.

515
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:53,875
No, believe me, I know.

516
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:57,250
Honey, honey, listen to me, okay?

517
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:59,333
One of the pills is missing.

518
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:03,583
Mom looked everywhere,
and she said she couldn't find it.

519
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,625
Just tell them what you told me.

520
00:31:10,958 --> 00:31:17,875
Um, I... I didn't know until today
about the barbiturates that Merritt took.

521
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:22,583
I... I brought these three pills with me
in my toiletry bag.

522
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:26,708
Um, they were kind of like
a security blanket for me in case...

523
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:29,666
things got worse quickly.

524
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,958
She was very careful
with the pills, Officer.

525
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:34,666
She kept them separate
from the other medications.

526
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,666
I had them in this little pouch,

527
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,541
- and there were three.
- Little pouch.

528
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,041
But when I checked them...

529
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,416
there were only two.

530
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:48,541
And who else would have access
to your medication?

531
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:50,500
- Nobody.
- Anybody.

532
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:52,250
Anybody at the house.

533
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:53,458
Anybody?

534
00:31:57,375 --> 00:31:58,291
What?

535
00:31:58,958 --> 00:31:59,958
Roulette.

536
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:02,916
Prescription roulette?

537
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:05,666
Roulette? What's that?

538
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,916
- His brother, Thomas...
- My brother Thomas, uh,

539
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,375
- steals pills.
- He steals pills all the time.

540
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:14,166
What are these pills, exactly, Mrs. Sacks?

541
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:18,208
They're pentobarbital.

542
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,916
But just one wouldn't have killed her.

543
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,083
It would've knocked her out, though.

544
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:25,000
Where did you get these pills?

545
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:32,250
A young man in my cancer-support group
got them for me.

546
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:34,250
You take three at once...

547
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,125
- I see.
- Okay, thank you.

548
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:44,750
-Yes, thank you so much for your time.
-Thank you very much.

549
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:52,333
It's okay, Mom. It's not your fault.

550
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:55,041
Not your fault.

551
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:57,958
You asshole.

552
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:02,958
You steal pills from my dying mother,
you give them to my best friend,

553
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:04,750
-and she fucking dies?
-What?!

554
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:07,708
Do you have any idea
what a monumental piece of shit you are?

555
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:09,375
-What did he do?
-Stop hitting me.

556
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:13,583
I'm talking about prescription roulette,
you pill-popping, boarding-school fuck!

557
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:15,250
- Enough.
- Okay, hey!

558
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:18,416
Thomas, we'd like to talk to you.
Why don't you come to the station with us?

559
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,833
Of course. Gladly. Let's go.

560
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:22,208
Just keep this fucking nutcase
away from me.

561
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:26,750
-You all right?
-I got it.

562
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:31,041
-What did he do?
-Your husband's a fucking asshole!

563
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:43,125
How are you doing?

564
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,166
I'll never get to see her again.

565
00:33:49,916 --> 00:33:51,666
I'll never get to talk to her.

566
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:58,250
I'll never get to tell her
what a piece of shit I am.

567
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:03,333
Hey, hey, don't say that about yourself.

568
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:11,208
I... I can't help thinking that
somehow I'm to blame for all of this.

569
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:17,000
You know, I knew how sick your mom was.

570
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:21,666
I knew how unsure you were,
but still I proposed to you.

571
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:28,958
And then, you know, after you and...

572
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:35,875
I really wanted to label you
"Women Who Lied to Me."

573
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,000
But the truth is,
you're so many good things too.

574
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:45,166
You know, you're "Women Who Inspired Me,

575
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,750
Women Who Made Me Laugh So Much
I Choked On My Beer."

576
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,916
"Women Who I Really...

577
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,833
Truly Fucking Loved."

578
00:35:02,291 --> 00:35:07,166
You... You probably don't want this right?
We should probably leave it here.

579
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,375
Okay.

580
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:16,458
I'll let you get back to it.

581
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:06,250
Ooh!

582
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:12,083
Nice.

583
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:18,250
Yes, I took her pill.

584
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:21,041
I take pills from everyone.
Is that a crime?

585
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:22,291
Yes!

586
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:26,125
Oh!

587
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:30,750
I didn't do anything with it, so...

588
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:32,875
Maybe Merritt did
after you gave it to her.

589
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:36,000
Why would I give it to Merritt?
I thought it was an oxy.

590
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,791
I kept it for myself.

591
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:42,125
Okay, what'd you do with it?
Where'd you put it?

592
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:43,208
I don't know.

593
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:50,375
See, she died on your parents' property.

594
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:54,208
And if we can prove
the pentobarbital entered her bloodstream

595
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:55,791
because of your negligence,

596
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:59,708
well, not only could you be liable,
your parents could be too.

597
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:02,750
And I can't imagine
there won't be a civil suit,

598
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:06,333
especially if she has any relatives
who could use a few extra bucks.

599
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:10,833
You'd be surprised
how quickly people get real sad

600
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:15,291
about an estranged cousin or a dead niece

601
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:17,750
once they find out
she's worth a couple of mil.

602
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:20,541
Hmm.

603
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:25,083
Isabel.

604
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:28,625
- What?
- Oh, fuck!

605
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:30,916
What?

606
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:34,375
-What about Isabel?
-Oh, fuck.

607
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:36,708
Yeah, this is all my fucking fault, guys.

608
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:41,833
So, my dad got Merritt a little bit, uh...

609
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:43,666
pregnant.

610
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,958
And then she wanted to keep it. Okay?

611
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:52,708
So I did what any good son would do,
and I just tried to see if I could

612
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:57,000
make that situation just go away.

613
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:02,500
<i>So...</i> <i>Here's what I did.</i>

614
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:09,291
<i>I took my grandfather's gun.</i>

615
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:10,416
What?

616
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,166
And I found Merritt on the beach later.

617
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,250
Just listen.

618
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:16,666
Oh, God.

619
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:23,041
<i>So, I was gonna
just scare her a little bit.</i>

620
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:26,250
Just tell her, "Hey, get rid of it,"
you know?

621
00:38:27,958 --> 00:38:28,958
But then,

622
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:31,416
I felt bad, so...

623
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:34,166
-Thomas?
-Oh, fuck.

624
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:37,375
Are you crazy?

625
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:39,833
You've got a gun.

626
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:44,208
She is gonna fuck everything up.

627
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:47,833
She's a stupid girl in love.

628
00:38:47,916 --> 00:38:49,208
-Hmm.
-Poor thing.

629
00:38:49,791 --> 00:38:52,166
It's not going to end well for her.

630
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:55,375
That's for sure.

631
00:38:57,166 --> 00:39:00,125
I just decided to go home to bed.

632
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:06,041
I'm telling you, it was her.

633
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:08,500
She's always in my stash.

634
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:10,500
And she just had a drink with Merritt.

635
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:13,916
Yeah, but why would Isabel
want to murder Merritt?

636
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Money.

637
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:17,666
It was money, duh.

638
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,791
Uh...

639
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:23,000
Look, I owe her, like,
two, two-and-a-half million.

640
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:29,416
She knows that I'm gonna get my trust fund
when the youngest sibling turns 18.

641
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,541
That's Will.

642
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:33,958
Now, if my dad and Merritt had a kid,

643
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,541
the trust automatically resets,

644
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:42,125
and no one gets access to the money
for another 18 years.

645
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:45,625
Plus, we gotta split it four ways
instead of three.

646
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:47,625
So you do the math, genius.

647
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,333
Two-and-a-half million dollars.

648
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:55,041
I might kill for that.

649
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:04,000
I'll just grab my phone,
and a Coke whenever you guys get a sec.

650
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,583
Are you some fucking morons?

651
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,666
This is your evidence?

652
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:22,458
You drag me down here like a criminal

653
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:26,875
because I indulge in a Xanax
with my wine, my... My Chablis?

654
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:35,125
Oh, you sniff around every corner.

655
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:39,791
Except the right one.

656
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:45,916
While the rest of us sit around
reading airport books.

657
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,166
The right one?

658
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:53,500
You said we're sniffing around
every corner, but the right one.

659
00:40:53,583 --> 00:40:55,541
<i>Qu'est que j'ai Vais dire...</i>

660
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,625
Why would I kill for money?

661
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:00,333
Look at me.

662
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:02,875
Really.

663
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,083
I gave Thomas some money.

664
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:12,125
I gave him a lot of money.

665
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:19,208
But anybody who expects to be paid back
by someone like him is an idiot.

666
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,666
No? Hmm?

667
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:26,208
Beautiful women don't kill for money,
they don't kill for sex.

668
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:29,791
They can have these things
anytime they want.

669
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:33,083
Women kill for power, for position.

670
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:36,125
To put a man in his place.

671
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:40,833
Is that what you were doing,
putting Tag in his place?

672
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:42,708
Me?

673
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,208
I was not even there when she died.

674
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,791
So where were you?

675
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:58,166
The driver said
they were both wicked smashed.

676
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,291
And he picked them up
from the Winbury house?

677
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:01,208
Yeah.

678
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:04,083
Gave them a ride over to the Sand Dollar.

679
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:08,125
Looks like they couldn't wait.

680
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:27,375
Hey, can you guys, um,
look at this maid interview with me?

681
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:33,583
<i>Mrs. Abby?</i>

682
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:37,583
<i>I don't work for her,
but still she orders me.</i>

683
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:41,166
<i>Last night,
Mr. Thomas didn't even sleep in the bed.</i>

684
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:46,875
Okay. Abby has told me
that Thomas did sleep in the bed.

685
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:51,208
And we just confirmed that Isabel
and Thomas were at the Sand Dollar hotel.

686
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:53,166
Didn't look like he was
going home to his wife.

687
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:56,166
Yeah, but she clearly lied.

688
00:42:56,833 --> 00:43:00,291
She could be embarrassed
that her husband's having an affair.

689
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:01,208
No.

690
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:03,750
No, it's bigger than that. It's...

691
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:05,458
Okay, wait. There's more.

692
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,625
<i>But still,</i>

693
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,541
<i>"Wash my sheets, Gosia."</i>

694
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:11,500
"Wash my pajamas, Gosia."

695
00:43:11,583 --> 00:43:13,625
"Wash my water glass, Gosia."

696
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:19,583
"Wash my water glass, Gosia.
Use very hot water, Gosia."

697
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:25,083
I told her I washed the glass.

698
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:30,666
But I didn't wash the glass.

699
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:36,125
So, the morning that they found the body,

700
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:40,291
I was talking to Abby in the kitchen
and she was washing a glass.

701
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:43,208
And she seemed very nervous.

702
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,833
Could that be the glass
the barbiturate was in?

703
00:43:57,291 --> 00:44:00,791
The motive Thomas laid out
makes the most sense.

704
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:01,791
-Money.
-Money.

705
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:04,166
With these kind of people,
it's always about the money.

706
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,083
Right.

707
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:08,416
So, Forensics won't find anything
on the glass.

708
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,958
What about that substance
on the hair shaft? Tallow, was it?

709
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,458
Fuck me.

710
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:26,458
Is this even an arrest?

711
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:31,791
Uh, hey, am I actually
under arrest?

712
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:34,916
Am I under arrest,
or can I go get something to eat?

713
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,541
<i>Could somebody call my wife?</i>

714
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,416
Uh...

715
00:44:42,083 --> 00:44:46,541
My sorority sister's mother-in-law
is, like, this Korean cosmetics magnate.

716
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:49,416
Her skin is amazing.

717
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,750
It's because over there, you're allowed to
use, like, baby foreskin and cow placenta.

718
00:44:54,416 --> 00:44:55,583
So unfair.

719
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:06,458
-Hey.
-Hi!

720
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,375
Oh, he's almost done processing,
just finishing up some paperwork.

721
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:15,291
Oh, good. I think we've had enough
of the air freshener smell.

722
00:45:15,375 --> 00:45:17,875
Oh, yeah. Mine was yogurt.

723
00:45:17,958 --> 00:45:19,041
Ugh!

724
00:45:20,041 --> 00:45:23,125
Someone opened a Yoplait
within 50 yards of me, and I'm just...

725
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:29,875
Um, so...

726
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:36,666
Did you know
that Isabel Nallet loaned Thomas money?

727
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:40,791
I knew that
he was managing her investments,

728
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:43,458
but if that's what she calls a loan, okay.

729
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:47,000
No, no, actually, he called it a loan,
but yeah,

730
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:50,250
I guess he owes her,
like, over two million dollars.

731
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:53,500
I don't get super-involved
in our finances.

732
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:54,583
Right.

733
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:58,708
She takes pills from him.
She's, like, "always in his stash." Jesus!

734
00:45:58,791 --> 00:46:00,333
She's always into everything.

735
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:04,458
Tom's meds,
Tag's whiskey, Greer's marriage.

736
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:07,750
You think Isabel was
messing around with Tag?

737
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:10,416
I think she'll take
whatever dick she can still get.

738
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,666
If that dick happens to be attached
to someone else's husband...

739
00:46:14,708 --> 00:46:15,791
Too bad.

740
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:16,958
Wow. Yeah.

741
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:18,958
Yeah, she's...

742
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:22,458
The term my mother would use
is, uh, "loose."

743
00:46:22,541 --> 00:46:25,791
Hmm.
Well, I don't believe in slut-shaming.

744
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:27,291
But...

745
00:46:28,166 --> 00:46:29,541
there's no way she's tight.

746
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:35,666
Yeah, yeah. Ladies,
lock up your husbands, right?

747
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,916
It's a good thing
yours came to bed that night.

748
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:40,000
-Thomas?
-Yeah.

749
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,208
-Hi, babe.
-Oh! There he is.

750
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,625
Yeah, yeah. Um...

751
00:46:45,708 --> 00:46:48,458
The other day you said, um,
you went to bed at 10:30,

752
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:50,000
you woke up a couple times,

753
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:52,458
and one of the times
was when he came to bed.

754
00:46:52,541 --> 00:46:54,916
-Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
-Right. Okay.

755
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,208
-Okay.
-Well, good to see you.

756
00:46:57,291 --> 00:46:59,708
-Ready?
-Yeah. Let's get the fuck out of here.

757
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:01,375
Stinks of fucking bacon.

758
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:03,291
Okay.

759
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:06,625
They didn't give me
anything to eat. All day.

760
00:47:06,708 --> 00:47:08,250
Can you fucking believe that?

761
00:47:17,916 --> 00:47:21,250
So I'm sitting there
across from these two cops,

762
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:22,833
and they're just floundering.

763
00:47:22,916 --> 00:47:25,500
They're just brain-dead.
There's nothing going on.

764
00:47:25,583 --> 00:47:30,666
And it's so obvious to me
that it was Isabel,

765
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,875
-because it's the trust-fund money.
-Right.

766
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:37,416
-And you're about to turn 18.
-What's he talking about? It was Isabel?

767
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,708
So Thomas was banking on
the trust fund being released

768
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:43,791
so he could reimburse Isabel
the money that she loaned him.

769
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:48,500
But that can only happen
when, uh, Will turns 18,

770
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:50,666
which is in a few weeks.

771
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:53,166
-Will, when's your birthday?
-August 9th.

772
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:55,666
- Yeah. So...
- Why doesn't he know that?

773
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,166
With Merritt's condition...

774
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,375
- Because she was pregnant?
- Right.

775
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,291
That would delay the trust?

776
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:04,833
By 18 years.

777
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:08,333
And the baby would be
the youngest Winbury, so...

778
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:14,333
So it was all about money.

779
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:20,625
Forgive the intrusion, Mrs. Winbury.

780
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:23,833
We have to conduct
another sweep of the property.

781
00:48:23,916 --> 00:48:25,333
Abby Stokes-Winbury?

782
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:28,958
You're under arrest
for the murder of Merritt Monaco.

783
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:31,250
-What?
-You have the right to remain silent.

784
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:33,916
-Anything you say can and will...
-You can't be serious.

785
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,875
-This is a mistake.
-No, it's not a mistake.

786
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:38,875
- Hands behind your back.
- You have the right to talk to a lawyer.

787
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,500
-I do. Call the lawyer, Tom.
-Get back.

788
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:44,291
And have him/her present with you
while you are being questioned.

789
00:48:44,375 --> 00:48:46,000
I can't go to jail, I'm pregnant!

790
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:49,083
Yeah, that's not a thing.

791
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:51,208
If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer,

792
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:55,041
one will be appointed to represent you
before any questioning. If you...

793
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:57,583
Tom, do something
for once in your fucking life!

794
00:48:57,666 --> 00:49:00,250
...you can decide at any time
to exercise these rights

795
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:03,041
and not answer any question
and make any statements...

796
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:22,708
Oh, fuck!

797
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:39,958
Hi.

798
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:42,791
Oh!

799
00:49:42,875 --> 00:49:45,250
-Hi.
-Brought you some cold-press.

800
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:47,250
Aw! Thanks.

801
00:49:56,541 --> 00:49:58,333
-I cut my foot.
-Oh, no.

802
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:10,208
-Men are such assholes.
-Yeah, tell me about it.

803
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:15,833
Can't trust them not to cheat.
Can't trust them not to lie.

804
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:21,833
You really can't trust them
to just get the job done.

805
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:24,291
You know?

806
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:28,958
It's true,
if you want something done right,

807
00:50:29,041 --> 00:50:30,958
you just have to do it yourself.

808
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:38,333
I bet a woman said that.

809
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:42,583
It's been helping me
to have a cool swim before bed.

810
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:45,916
You wanna?

811
00:50:47,416 --> 00:50:48,416
Yeah.

812
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:53,208
Why not?

813
00:52:00,458 --> 00:52:02,791
Do you understand your rights
as I have explained them?

814
00:52:02,875 --> 00:52:03,875
No, I don't!

815
00:52:06,416 --> 00:52:09,541
You have the right to remain silent...

816
00:52:09,625 --> 00:52:11,541
The right to remain silent.

817
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:15,041
Anything you say
can and will be used against you...

818
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:17,250
Oh, shit!

819
00:52:18,916 --> 00:52:19,750
Greer!

820
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:33,041
What the fuck?

821
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:37,333
Mrs. Winbury,
would you turn to your right side, please?

822
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:41,958
And to your left.

823
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,333
Back to the front.

824
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:54,625
-Are we done?
-Yes. You can step out.

825
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:14,666
You know what's funny?

826
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:18,250
It never occurred to me,

827
00:53:18,916 --> 00:53:20,541
not even once...

828
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,958
that you might actually leave me.

829
00:53:45,791 --> 00:53:46,958
You stay here.

830
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:51,250
I was gonna write the next one
from the city anyway.

831
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:02,125
You're gonna kill it.

832
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:12,625
I know.

833
00:54:57,875 --> 00:54:58,958
-Bye.
-Bye.

834
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:13,791
-Where is Thomas?
-Uh, in the house, I think.

835
00:55:16,541 --> 00:55:17,958
Ooh!

836
00:55:23,666 --> 00:55:26,500
Chloe, come on,
give me back my phone. Give it back.

837
00:55:26,583 --> 00:55:27,583
-Wait.
-What?

838
00:55:27,666 --> 00:55:29,125
It's a really cool Instagram filter.

839
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:31,583
Oh, my God, Instagram filter?
Are you crazy?

840
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:34,083
You're just like everyone else
in our generation.

841
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:36,166
-Oh, my God. You're so cool.
-All you wanna do...

842
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:39,250
You know what, I am pretty cool, actually.
I think out of the two of us,

843
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:41,875
if you had to decide,
I think I am kind of cool...

844
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:44,458
Mr. Tag.

845
00:55:55,916 --> 00:55:57,875
Thomas! Thomas!

846
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:06,291
-Isabel, I can't speak French, honey.
<i>-Oui.</i>

847
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:08,791
- But it's not what you think.
- You better learn.

848
00:56:08,875 --> 00:56:11,291
-No, right. Wow. Coward!
-Oh, shit!

849
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:13,416
-It was the fucking cops!
-You are such a liar!

850
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,583
-They put words in my mouth!
-My God!

851
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:42,166
Look at that. He loves it.

852
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:44,458
Good job, son.

853
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:46,375
Good job, Elizabeth.

854
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:48,333
Thanks.

855
00:56:48,416 --> 00:56:49,541
Ooh!

856
00:56:50,083 --> 00:56:52,500
Don't be scared.
I got you. I promise, okay?

857
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:53,791
Okay.

858
00:56:53,875 --> 00:56:57,541
Animals can sense fear,
so you gotta project confidence. Okay?

859
00:56:57,625 --> 00:56:59,125
-Yeah.
-Okay?

860
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:01,916
Don't be scared. There you go. Good!

861
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,208
You're a hard person to find.

862
00:57:08,166 --> 00:57:09,000
Hi.

863
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:11,000
Hi.

864
00:57:15,791 --> 00:57:17,250
Not hard enough, I guess.

865
00:57:18,916 --> 00:57:20,208
What are you doing here?

866
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:21,625
I came to find you.

867
00:57:22,458 --> 00:57:26,916
I'm in London meeting with my publishers,
and I've written something. Something new.

868
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:30,541
But I'm not giving it to them
without your blessing.

869
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,791
You want me to read your new book?

870
00:57:36,875 --> 00:57:38,458
I think you're gonna love it.

871
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:40,125
It's about you.

872
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:46,541
-About me?
-Yes, it is.

873
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,791
You look terrified. You don't have to be.

874
00:58:01,791 --> 00:58:02,666
{\an8}Uh...

875
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,291
I'm sorry. I just...

876
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:10,166
I thought you were happy to get rid of me.

877
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:14,166
Oh! I... I was.
I was dreadfully angry at you.

878
00:58:15,583 --> 00:58:18,958
But then I started thinking about things
and I realized...

879
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,125
Uh...

880
00:58:24,541 --> 00:58:25,708
I was jealous.

881
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:29,958
Anyway, I've written it all down
as a good writer should do,

882
00:58:30,041 --> 00:58:33,708
so give it a read,
and if you don't hate it, give me a call.

883
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:35,375
We can have some dinner.

884
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:40,541
I hope you call. I'd love to see you.

885
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:02,583
- How's Safi doing?
- Good.

886
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:03,666
Yeah?

887
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:04,583
Yes.

888
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,916
-You guys want to feed him?
-Yes!

889
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:07,916
Yeah, okay.
