1
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,311
Hey, Nat!

2
00:01:37,057 --> 00:01:38,684
We're both upside down.

3
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,936
And I bet you're gonna fall down first.

4
00:01:41,103 --> 00:01:42,646
No, you will.

5
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:45,440
You can't hold it much longer.

6
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:49,861
Told you you'd fall down first.

7
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:53,323
I told you! I told you!

8
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:56,952
Told you so!

9
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:00,414
Mommy!

10
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:09,506
What happened?

11
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:12,426
She fell on her knee.

12
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:14,553
- Oh, you bump your knee?
- Mmm-hmm.

13
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:15,846
Oh...

14
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:20,809
Kiss it better.
There we go.

15
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:23,937
Oh, come on, little one.

16
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:25,731
Get up. You're okay.

17
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,900
Come on.
You're a brave girl.

18
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:31,611
Your pain only makes you stronger.

19
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:34,197
- Right, you?
- Yeah.

20
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:35,508
- Yeah?
- Look!

21
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:37,492
Forest stars.

22
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:38,779
Yeah. You know what?

23
00:02:38,827 --> 00:02:42,581
Those are actually
part of the <i>Lampyridae</i> family.

24
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:46,293
And the glow, the glow that you see,

25
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,921
that comes from
a chemical reaction called...

26
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:52,632
bioluminescence.

27
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:54,718
Come on, time for dinner.

28
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:57,095
Bio-goomin-feasants?

29
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:59,639
"Bio-goomin-feasants."
That's right.

30
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:02,517
Dinner!

31
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:04,853
Come on, dinner, big girl!

32
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:08,899
I want mac and cheese.

33
00:03:08,982 --> 00:03:12,694
Oh, you want mac and cheese?
Okay. Well, I want...

34
00:03:13,028 --> 00:03:14,780
caviar and champagne.

35
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,782
Grab the napkins.

36
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:19,326
You take this. Thank you.

37
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:22,245
Oh, would you grab
the ranch dressing for Dad?

38
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:27,709
Okay.

39
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:29,687
Green beans
are my favorite vegetable.

40
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:32,672
Dad's home!

41
00:03:35,884 --> 00:03:36,968
Hey, Dad.

42
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:38,553
Hey, baby.

43
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:50,649
Everything okay?

44
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:55,904
How was everybody's day?

45
00:03:56,071 --> 00:03:58,073
Mommy taught me
about lamp bugs.

46
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,076
- Lamp bugs.
- And I fell and hurt my knee,

47
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:03,787
- but it doesn't hurt anymore.
- Mmm-hmm.

48
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,070
And we also saw
fireflies in the backyard.

49
00:04:06,123 --> 00:04:07,124
That was my favorite part

50
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:08,250
- of the whole day.
- No.

51
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:10,770
Yelena,
we see fireflies every year.

52
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:11,795
How long do we have?

53
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:14,464
I don't know. Like, an hour, maybe.

54
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:19,010
I don't wanna go.

55
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:23,181
Don't say that.

56
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,395
Girls...

57
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:33,024
you remember when I told you that
one day we would have that big adventure?

58
00:04:35,277 --> 00:04:37,904
- Today's the day.
- Yay!

59
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,868
All right, let's go.

60
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,626
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:58,175 --> 00:04:59,819
- Come on, we gotta hurry.
- Thank you.

62
00:04:59,843 --> 00:05:01,070
- I don't have my shoes.
- Thank you, baby.

63
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:02,804
That's okay. You don't need your shoes.

64
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:05,223
- But I'm still hungry.
- Yeah? Guess what?

65
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,766
I got Fruit Roll-Ups in the car.

66
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:18,778
No, leave it, leave it, leave it.
Go wait in the car.

67
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,621
- You have it?
- Yeah.

68
00:05:27,704 --> 00:05:29,831
- It's the only copy?
- It's the only one not on fire.

69
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,302
Where are we going?

70
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:44,262
Home.

71
00:05:45,013 --> 00:05:46,723
Mommy, you're silly.

72
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,475
We just left home.

73
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:01,655
I want my song.

74
00:06:04,324 --> 00:06:07,118
♪ <i>Bye, bye, Miss American Pie</i> ♪

75
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:12,290
♪ <i>Drove my Chevy to the levee ♪
♪ but the levee was dry</i> ♪

76
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:16,836

77

78
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:25,595
♪ <i>"This'll be the day that I die"</i> ♪

79
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,960
Come on, Yelena.
Hurry up, baby.

80
00:06:57,127 --> 00:06:59,254
Let's go. Come on, Nat.
Hurry up. We gotta go.

81
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:00,880
We gotta go.
Come on, you gotta run.

82
00:07:12,142 --> 00:07:13,143
Come on. Honey, honey.

83
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:14,328
- Go with your mom. Go with your mom.
- Okay.

84
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:15,832
- Nat, hurry up!
- I'm coming!

85
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,065
Okay. Seat belts.

86
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:22,986
Okay.

87
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:24,130
Why isn't Dad in the plane?

88
00:07:24,154 --> 00:07:25,874
He's coming. He's coming, baby.
He's coming.

89
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:08,531
Mom?

90
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,793
Mom!

91
00:08:22,337 --> 00:08:23,797
I need you up here.

92
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:27,258
- Okay.
- Okay.

93
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:29,302
I need you to pull right.

94
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,058
Mom, you've got blood on you.

95
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:36,226
It's okay, baby.

96
00:08:55,662 --> 00:08:56,955
Hit the accelerator there.

97
00:09:06,673 --> 00:09:08,174
Hold it steady, hold it steady.

98
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:11,803
You're gonna pull back at 55 knots.

99
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:13,304
Let's count together.

100
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:15,932
45, 50...

101
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:30,739
Pull back.
You can do it!

102
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:32,949
Pull back.
All your strength.

103
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,871
Okay.

104
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:29,130
Get up, Mommy.

105
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:32,509
Pain only makes you stronger, remember?

106
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:43,728
The Red Guardian returns.

107
00:10:43,895 --> 00:10:46,356
The Red Guardian returns triumphant.

108
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:50,568
Please, please, I beg you.
No more undercover work.

109
00:10:50,652 --> 00:10:52,779
I wanna get back in the action.
I want my suit back.

110
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:53,947
I wanna get back in it.

111
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:56,491
General Dreykov,
it's been over three years.

112
00:10:56,741 --> 00:11:00,036
Forgive me mom.

113
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:01,162
I'm scared.

114
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:02,973
Never let them take your heart.

115
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,626
Did you get it?

116
00:11:12,382 --> 00:11:14,592
And the North Institute?

117
00:11:15,218 --> 00:11:16,219
Ashes.

118
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:17,762
It's gonna be okay.

119
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:19,973
How is Melina?

120
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:22,433
She'll live. She's strong.

121
00:11:25,103 --> 00:11:27,772
- Mommy?
- Mom?

122
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:29,899
- Daddy!
- I'll handle this.

123
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:31,693
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Yelena!

124
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,403
- Daddy!
- Get away from her!

125
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:36,239
Don't touch her!

126
00:11:36,406 --> 00:11:37,949
I will shoot.

127
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:40,285
Don't touch her!

128
00:11:40,952 --> 00:11:42,954
I will kill you all!

129
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:44,789
I will shoot.

130
00:11:44,998 --> 00:11:46,332
Don't touch her.

131
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:47,625
Honey.

132
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:51,898
You're gonna need to hand me that gun.

133
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,052
I don't wanna go back there.

134
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:00,305
I wanna stay in Ohio.

135
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:03,057
You can't take her.

136
00:12:04,142 --> 00:12:06,185
You can't.

137
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:07,979
She's only six.

138
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:09,346
You were even younger.

139
00:12:10,982 --> 00:12:12,025
It's okay.

140
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:14,944
Come here.

141
00:12:19,616 --> 00:12:20,656
You're gonna be all right.

142
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:24,387
Do you know why
it's gonna be all right?

143
00:12:24,871 --> 00:12:30,043
'Cause my girls are
the toughest girls in the world.

144
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:33,254
You're gonna take care
of each other, okay?

145
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:37,091
And everything,
everything's gonna be fine.

146
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:55,360
That one, she has fire in her.

147
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,030
What was her name?

148
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:01,449
Natasha.

149
00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:07,413
Ah... Natasha.

150
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,148
No!

151
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:47,078
Remove all the defects.

152
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,252
That one

153
00:13:54,711 --> 00:13:56,004
and her.

154
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:57,588
No!

155
00:13:57,755 --> 00:13:58,756
Yelena!

156
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:06,097
Take it! Take it! No!

157
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:15,648
No!

158
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:23,197
The Red Room is your home now.

159
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:25,616
Get off me! No!

160
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:48,890
<i>Undercover spies in our communities.</i>

161
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:51,726
<i>They took on false identities,
even raised families...</i>

162
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,472
- They're topside, sir!
- Tier 1 has LOS!

163
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:56,309
We've got all exits covered.

164
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,477
All right. Stay alert.

165
00:16:58,895 --> 00:17:00,313
I'm sending in alpha squad.

166
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:11,616
Natasha Romanoff is in violation
of the Sokovia Accords.

167
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:13,701
<i>She assaulted the king of Wakanda.</i>

168
00:17:13,868 --> 00:17:15,161
<i>Make an example out of her.</i>

169
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:23,169
- Yeah?
- Don't do this.

170
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:24,545
Do what?

171
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:26,547
Come after me.

172
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:28,901
I mean, you're embarrassing yourself.
It looks desperate.

173
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:31,719
<i>Thought maybe you'd be
calling me to cut a deal.</i>

174
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:34,555
<i>'Cause from my vantage point,</i>

175
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:36,015
<i>it's the federal fugitive</i>

176
00:17:36,182 --> 00:17:37,266
who's desperate.

177
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,394
<i>From my vantage point,
you look like you could use some bed rest.</i>

178
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,355
<i>What is this, your second triple bypass?</i>

179
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:44,732
I wouldn't worry about me.

180
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:47,151
We got Barton, we got Wilson
and that other guy,

181
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:49,111
the incredible shrinking convict.

182
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:51,989
<i>Rogers is on the run.
You got no friends.</i>

183
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:53,616
Where you gonna go?

184
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:56,118
I've lived a lot of lives
before I met you, Ross.

185
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:58,871
You shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble. I'm done.

186
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:01,540
Romanoff?

187
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,527
Got an empty nest,
Secretary Ross.

188
00:18:29,694 --> 00:18:31,654
Her tracker, sir.

189
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:53,384
Eyes on target.
Waiting for the package.

190
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:57,888
I have sights on collateral one.

191
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,352
Firing in place of three.

192
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:05,146
Five, four...

193
00:19:07,398 --> 00:19:09,233
She made us.
Target deployed smoke.

194
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,944
She's on foot with the package.
Stay high. I'm going to ground.

195
00:20:26,685 --> 00:20:28,270
Oksana.

196
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:31,732
Oh, no.

197
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:33,692
What did I do?

198
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:35,653
Free the others.

199
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,248
Yelena, we need a status report.

200
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:53,629
<i>Yelena,
we need a status report.</i>

201
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,805
Converge on team leader.

202
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:10,062
<i>General Dreykov,
we have a deserter.</i>

203
00:21:10,563 --> 00:21:13,649
<i>Permission to activate
Taskmaster Protocol?</i>

204
00:21:37,715 --> 00:21:38,966
Smile.

205
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:05,218
After the Sokovia Accords

206
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:07,786
the hunt is on
for the remaining Avengers...

207
00:22:07,912 --> 00:22:12,500
Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff
are currently on the run.

208
00:22:52,957 --> 00:22:54,667
You're in my bed.

209
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,794
I'm... I'm not even under the covers.

210
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:58,230
Did you get everything on my list?

211
00:22:58,254 --> 00:23:03,467
Got passports, entry visas,
a couple of local driver's licenses.

212
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:07,054
Mix and match, you should be able to
stretch it to 20 or so identities.

213
00:23:07,805 --> 00:23:08,847
Fanny Longbottom?

214
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,808
- What?
- What, are you 12?

215
00:23:10,975 --> 00:23:14,562
That is a legitimate name.

216
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:17,022
We've got a generator outside.

217
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:20,293
It's petrol-powered. And the septic tank
will need a flush in a couple of weeks,

218
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:22,117
but, you know,
I've got a guy coming for that.

219
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:25,072
You have to haul your rubbish into town.
It's just a 20-minute drive.

220
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:28,284
I've got your basic hardware kit
stashed under the stairs.

221
00:23:28,826 --> 00:23:29,952
Thanks.

222
00:23:30,578 --> 00:23:31,870
Are you okay?

223
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:33,163
Why wouldn't I be?

224
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,250
I hear things. You know, something
about the Avengers getting divorced...

225
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,544
Ugh. It's fine.

226
00:23:39,128 --> 00:23:40,328
I'm actually better on my own.

227
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:41,422
Are you sure?

228
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:43,173
Yeah.

229
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:44,951
Because you can tell me, you know.

230
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,810
That's the way
the whole friends thing works.

231
00:23:46,885 --> 00:23:49,722
I know. I have friends.

232
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:52,766
People who have friends don't call me.

233
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:00,899
And I don't pay you to worry.

234
00:24:15,906 --> 00:24:17,033
Oh, hey.

235
00:24:18,284 --> 00:24:19,327
What's all this junk?

236
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,580
Oh, just some mail and personals
from the Budapest safe house.

237
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:24,498
Budapest?

238
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:26,667
Yeah. Budapest.

239
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:29,003
- No, it's "Budapest."
- Budapest.

240
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,254
Budapest.

241
00:24:30,421 --> 00:24:32,506
- It's "Budapest." Sh.
- Whatever.

242
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:35,885
I knew you weren't going back there,
so I've got someone else in the flat now.

243
00:24:36,052 --> 00:24:38,488
Sorry you went through the trouble.
I would've told you to chuck it.

244
00:24:38,512 --> 00:24:40,639
Well, if you don't want it,
throw it in the rubbish.

245
00:25:06,749 --> 00:25:08,310
<i>You're not
a sportsman, Mr. Bond.</i>

246
00:25:08,334 --> 00:25:10,103
Why did you break up the encounter

247
00:25:10,127 --> 00:25:11,212
with my pet python?

248
00:25:11,295 --> 00:25:13,839
Because I discovered
he had a crush on me.

249
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:18,362
Moonraker 1
<i>on preset launch program...</i>

250
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:19,470
Oh, great.

251
00:25:19,637 --> 00:25:21,097
<i>...minus two minutes.</i>

252
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,681
<i>Retract crew access...</i>

253
00:27:02,364 --> 00:27:05,493
I'm pretty sure Ross
has no jurisdiction here.

254
00:27:08,078 --> 00:27:10,748
And you should know I'm a better shot
when I'm pissed off.

255
00:28:13,978 --> 00:28:15,563
You're not here for me.

256
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:05,798
Oh, shit.

257
00:31:02,563 --> 00:31:04,203
I know you're out there.

258
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:07,985
I know you know I'm out here.

259
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:17,286
Then why are you skulking about
like it's a minefield?

260
00:31:17,453 --> 00:31:19,413
'Cause I don't know
if I can trust you.

261
00:31:19,496 --> 00:31:22,499
Funny,
I was going to say the same thing.

262
00:31:25,753 --> 00:31:27,713
So, we gonna talk
like grown-ups?

263
00:31:30,174 --> 00:31:31,425
Is that what we are?

264
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,479
Put it down before I make you.

265
00:31:43,645 --> 00:31:44,730
You put yours down.

266
00:31:45,689 --> 00:31:48,066
Watch your step.

267
00:32:08,712 --> 00:32:10,422
Stay down. Stay down.

268
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:13,008
Stay down.

269
00:33:08,272 --> 00:33:10,607
Stop.

270
00:33:14,069 --> 00:33:15,153
Truce.

271
00:33:26,957 --> 00:33:28,125
You've grown up.

272
00:33:33,922 --> 00:33:35,048
No shit.

273
00:33:38,176 --> 00:33:40,256
You had to come
to Budapest, didn't you?

274
00:33:41,013 --> 00:33:43,181
I came here
because I thought you wouldn't.

275
00:33:44,016 --> 00:33:47,060
But since you're here,
what bullet does that?

276
00:33:49,855 --> 00:33:51,481
Not bullets. Arrows.

277
00:33:51,648 --> 00:33:52,733
Ah, right.

278
00:33:53,525 --> 00:33:56,069
If you didn't think I'd come here,
why'd you send me this?

279
00:33:56,695 --> 00:33:58,113
You brought it back here?

280
00:34:00,574 --> 00:34:03,303
I'm not here trying to be your friend,
but you need to tell me what that is.

281
00:34:03,327 --> 00:34:04,745
It's a synthetic gas.

282
00:34:04,912 --> 00:34:07,289
The counteragent to chemical subjugation.

283
00:34:07,456 --> 00:34:09,166
The gas immunizes
the brain's neuropathways

284
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:10,329
from external manipulation.

285
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:11,710
Maybe in English next time?

286
00:34:11,877 --> 00:34:13,962
It's an antidote to mind control.

287
00:34:14,046 --> 00:34:15,339
Real mature.

288
00:34:15,881 --> 00:34:18,484
Why don't you take it
to one of your super-scientist friends?

289
00:34:18,508 --> 00:34:19,635
They can explain it to you.

290
00:34:19,801 --> 00:34:21,303
Tony Stark, maybe?

291
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:23,972
Oh, yeah. We're not really
talking right now, so...

292
00:34:24,348 --> 00:34:26,099
Great. Perfect timing.

293
00:34:26,266 --> 00:34:28,352
Where's an Avenger when you need one?

294
00:34:28,518 --> 00:34:29,519
I don't wanna be here.

295
00:34:29,686 --> 00:34:31,939
I'm on the run.
You could've gotten me killed.

296
00:34:32,105 --> 00:34:33,690
Well, what was I supposed to do?

297
00:34:33,774 --> 00:34:36,777
You're the only superhero person
that I know.

298
00:34:38,904 --> 00:34:40,739
That was the whole reason
I sent it to you.

299
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:45,285
I kept checking the news,

300
00:34:45,452 --> 00:34:49,873
expecting to see Captain America
bringing down the Red Room.

301
00:34:54,044 --> 00:34:55,045
What?

302
00:34:56,463 --> 00:34:58,590
Taking down the Red Room?
What are you talking about?

303
00:34:58,757 --> 00:35:00,342
It's been gone for years.

304
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:02,344
Dreykov's dead.

305
00:35:02,886 --> 00:35:03,887
I killed him.

306
00:35:04,054 --> 00:35:06,139
You don't actually believe that, do you?

307
00:35:11,395 --> 00:35:12,854
You really do believe that.

308
00:35:13,021 --> 00:35:14,439
Dreykov's dead.

309
00:35:14,606 --> 00:35:17,001
It took almost destroying the entire city
just to get to him.

310
00:35:17,025 --> 00:35:18,753
If you're so sure,
then tell me what happened.

311
00:35:18,777 --> 00:35:20,404
Tell me exactly.

312
00:35:21,363 --> 00:35:22,364
We rigged bombs.

313
00:35:22,531 --> 00:35:24,032
- Who's "we"?
- Clint Barton.

314
00:35:24,616 --> 00:35:27,244
Killing Dreykov was the final step
in my defection to S.H.I.E.L.D.

315
00:35:29,413 --> 00:35:30,789
Simple as that?

316
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:34,876
Yeah, sure, "simple."

317
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,500
That's what I'd call imploding
a five-story building

318
00:35:37,546 --> 00:35:40,632
and then shooting it out
with the Hungarian Special Forces.

319
00:35:40,799 --> 00:35:43,844
Took 10 days in hiding
before we could even get out of Budapest.

320
00:35:44,469 --> 00:35:45,595
And you checked the body?

321
00:35:45,762 --> 00:35:47,347
Confirmed the kill?

322
00:35:50,851 --> 00:35:52,686
There was no body left to check.

323
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,481
You're forgetting Dreykov's daughter.

324
00:36:56,124 --> 00:36:57,560
Where are we trying to get?

325
00:36:57,584 --> 00:36:59,586
Motorbike! East side
of the building.

326
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:02,940
They're going east, to the roof.

327
00:37:02,964 --> 00:37:04,007
Copy, in pursuit.

328
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,993
I got you!

329
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:36,706
No!

330
00:37:54,307 --> 00:37:56,476
Hey.

331
00:37:56,852 --> 00:37:58,687
Don't move. You're hurt.

332
00:37:58,854 --> 00:38:00,063
Let me help you.

333
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:17,164
I don't wanna do this.

334
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:21,459
- What are you doing?
- He's making me.

335
00:38:51,406 --> 00:38:53,325
Do you believe me now?

336
00:38:54,826 --> 00:38:56,244
How many others?

337
00:38:56,411 --> 00:38:57,787
Enough.

338
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,672
Which one's yours?

339
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,178
Black. Brown seat.

340
00:39:14,054 --> 00:39:15,222
Where are my keys?

341
00:39:16,932 --> 00:39:18,092
...ah, bitch.

342
00:39:19,684 --> 00:39:20,685
Any day now.

343
00:39:59,808 --> 00:40:00,910
Are you okay?

344
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:01,977
Fantastic.

345
00:40:02,143 --> 00:40:03,579
You can't just steal a guy's car.

346
00:40:03,603 --> 00:40:05,523
So you want me to chase him down
and un-steal it?

347
00:40:09,526 --> 00:40:11,569
- Okay. Any time now, please.
- Shut up.

348
00:40:46,146 --> 00:40:47,272
Okay, you got a plan,

349
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:48,898
or shall I just stay duck-and-cover?

350
00:40:49,065 --> 00:40:50,465
Yeah, my plan was to drive us away.

351
00:40:50,525 --> 00:40:51,901
That's a shit plan.

352
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:05,790
You're welcome.

353
00:41:19,095 --> 00:41:20,347
Oh, shit. He's back.

354
00:41:32,984 --> 00:41:33,985
Put your seat belt on.

355
00:41:34,152 --> 00:41:35,362
You're such a mom.

356
00:42:07,727 --> 00:42:08,812
Natasha, no.

357
00:42:09,604 --> 00:42:11,022
I think I'm bleeding. I'm...

358
00:42:13,149 --> 00:42:14,984
No. Not now, trust me.

359
00:43:07,237 --> 00:43:08,238
You okay?

360
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:11,116
Yeah. Great plan.

361
00:43:11,825 --> 00:43:14,870
I love the part
where I almost bled to death.

362
00:43:16,496 --> 00:43:17,831
This is cozy.

363
00:43:17,998 --> 00:43:20,584
Barton and I spent two days
hiding out up here.

364
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,335
That must have been fun.

365
00:43:23,795 --> 00:43:25,463
Who the hell is that guy?

366
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:27,007
Dreykov's special project.

367
00:43:27,549 --> 00:43:29,551
He can mimic anyone he's ever seen.

368
00:43:29,718 --> 00:43:30,844
It's like fighting a mirror.

369
00:43:31,553 --> 00:43:33,680
Dreykov only deploys him
for top-priority missions.

370
00:43:33,847 --> 00:43:35,515
This doesn't make any sense.

371
00:43:35,682 --> 00:43:39,144
Well, the truth rarely makes sense
when you omit key details.

372
00:43:40,979 --> 00:43:42,272
What is that supposed to mean?

373
00:43:42,439 --> 00:43:44,399
You didn't say one word
about Dreykov's daughter.

374
00:43:45,817 --> 00:43:47,110
You killed her.

375
00:43:47,777 --> 00:43:49,154
I had to.

376
00:43:50,447 --> 00:43:52,115
I needed her to lead me to Dreykov.

377
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:56,050
<i>We need confirmation
Dreykov's in the building.</i>

378
00:43:57,704 --> 00:43:59,104
His car is pulling up now.

379
00:44:16,598 --> 00:44:18,975
Dreykov's daughter was collateral damage.

380
00:44:20,936 --> 00:44:22,812
I needed her to be sure.

381
00:44:23,146 --> 00:44:24,586
<i>Natasha, we clear?</i>

382
00:44:26,816 --> 00:44:27,817
All clear.

383
00:44:32,322 --> 00:44:34,449
And here you are, not so sure.

384
00:44:34,824 --> 00:44:37,118
I needed out.

385
00:44:52,717 --> 00:44:54,427
The Red Room's still active. Where is it?

386
00:44:54,594 --> 00:44:55,595
I have no idea.

387
00:44:56,346 --> 00:44:58,515
He moves location constantly.

388
00:44:58,682 --> 00:45:03,144
And every widow is sedated
on entry and exit for maximum security.

389
00:45:04,604 --> 00:45:07,857
I'm just finding it hard to believe
that he could stay off my radar.

390
00:45:08,024 --> 00:45:11,569
Well, it's not smart to attack an Avenger
if you want to stay hidden.

391
00:45:11,736 --> 00:45:13,905
I mean, the clue is in the name.

392
00:45:14,072 --> 00:45:15,365
Dreykov kills you,

393
00:45:15,532 --> 00:45:18,285
one of the big ones comes to avenge you.

394
00:45:18,451 --> 00:45:19,786
Wait, what are the big ones?

395
00:45:19,953 --> 00:45:24,332
Well, I doubt the god from space
has to take an ibuprofen after a fight.

396
00:45:26,835 --> 00:45:29,004
Where did you think I was all this time?

397
00:45:32,382 --> 00:45:36,094
I thought that you got out
and were living a normal life.

398
00:45:37,887 --> 00:45:39,514
And you just never made contact again?

399
00:45:39,681 --> 00:45:41,558
Honestly, I thought
you didn't wanna see me.

400
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:44,269
Bullshit.

401
00:45:44,436 --> 00:45:47,105
You just didn't want
your baby sister to tag along,

402
00:45:47,272 --> 00:45:49,072
whilst you saved the world
with the cool kids.

403
00:45:49,149 --> 00:45:51,109
You weren't really my sister.

404
00:45:54,446 --> 00:45:56,990
And the Avengers
aren't really your family.

405
00:45:57,699 --> 00:45:59,677
- Why do you always do that thing?
- Do what?

406
00:45:59,701 --> 00:46:02,162
The thing you do when you're fighting.

407
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:04,664
The... Like, the...

408
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:07,584
This thing that you do

409
00:46:07,751 --> 00:46:09,794
when you whip your hair
when you're fighting

410
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:11,421
with the arm and the hair.

411
00:46:11,504 --> 00:46:13,923
And you do, like,
a fighting pose.

412
00:46:14,007 --> 00:46:15,550
It's a...

413
00:46:15,633 --> 00:46:17,427
It's a fighting pose.
You're a total poser.

414
00:46:17,594 --> 00:46:19,512
I'm not a poser.

415
00:46:19,596 --> 00:46:21,514
Oh, come on.
I mean, they're great poses,

416
00:46:21,681 --> 00:46:24,351
but it does look like
you think everyone's looking at you, like,

417
00:46:24,517 --> 00:46:25,518
all the time.

418
00:46:25,602 --> 00:46:29,022
All that time that I spent posing,
I was trying to actually do something good

419
00:46:29,189 --> 00:46:32,609
to make up for all the pain
and suffering that we caused.

420
00:46:32,984 --> 00:46:35,153
Trying to be more
than just a trained killer.

421
00:46:37,697 --> 00:46:40,450
Well, then you were fooling yourself

422
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:44,954
because pain and suffering is every day
and we are both still a trained killer.

423
00:46:45,372 --> 00:46:48,333
Except I'm not the one
that's on the cover of a magazine.

424
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,710
I'm not the killer
that little girls call their hero.

425
00:47:09,229 --> 00:47:10,230
That gas,

426
00:47:11,106 --> 00:47:12,649
the counteragent,

427
00:47:12,982 --> 00:47:14,567
it was synthesized in secret

428
00:47:14,651 --> 00:47:17,404
by an older widow
from Melina's generation.

429
00:47:17,695 --> 00:47:20,949
I was on the mission to retrieve it,
and she exposed me

430
00:47:21,116 --> 00:47:24,953
and I killed the widow that freed me.

431
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:26,704
Did you have a choice?

432
00:47:26,871 --> 00:47:29,666
What you experienced
was psychological conditioning.

433
00:47:31,209 --> 00:47:34,212
I'm talking about chemically
altering brain functions.

434
00:47:34,379 --> 00:47:36,589
They're two completely different things.

435
00:47:37,257 --> 00:47:41,010
You're fully conscious,
but you don't know which part is you.

436
00:47:41,177 --> 00:47:42,804
I'm still not sure.

437
00:47:52,439 --> 00:47:54,274
- Is that all there is left?
- Mmm-hmm.

438
00:47:55,233 --> 00:47:59,446
It's the only thing that can stop Dreykov
and his network of widows.

439
00:48:01,906 --> 00:48:03,533
He takes more every day.

440
00:48:03,908 --> 00:48:06,494
Children who don't have anyone
to protect them.

441
00:48:06,661 --> 00:48:07,941
Just like us when we were small.

442
00:48:08,538 --> 00:48:11,040
Maybe one in 20 survives the training,
becomes a widow.

443
00:48:11,207 --> 00:48:12,584
The rest, he kills.

444
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:15,545
To him, we are just things.

445
00:48:16,621 --> 00:48:19,666
Weapons with no face
that he can just throw away.

446
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:23,587
Because there is always more.

447
00:48:24,129 --> 00:48:27,424
And no one's even looking for him,
thanks to you and Alexei.

448
00:48:27,591 --> 00:48:29,217
Alexei?

449
00:48:31,344 --> 00:48:32,429
"Dad."

450
00:48:43,315 --> 00:48:46,026
Did you ever look
for your parents? Your real ones?

451
00:48:48,236 --> 00:48:51,865
Well, my mom abandoned me
in the street like garbage.

452
00:48:55,118 --> 00:48:56,369
What about you?

453
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:01,041
They destroyed my birth certificate,
so I reinvented it.

454
00:49:01,958 --> 00:49:04,169
My parents still live in Ohio.

455
00:49:05,253 --> 00:49:07,172
My sister moved out west.

456
00:49:07,255 --> 00:49:08,256
Is that right?

457
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,966
You're a science teacher.

458
00:49:11,635 --> 00:49:14,971
You're working part-time, though,
especially after you had your son.

459
00:49:15,138 --> 00:49:17,807
Your husband, he renovates houses.

460
00:49:17,974 --> 00:49:20,268
That is not my story.

461
00:49:20,435 --> 00:49:22,145
What is your story?

462
00:49:25,315 --> 00:49:29,110
I never let myself be alone
long enough to think about it.

463
00:49:34,241 --> 00:49:36,034
Did you ever wish for kids?

464
00:49:39,246 --> 00:49:41,373
I want a dog.

465
00:49:47,921 --> 00:49:49,047
Where you gonna go?

466
00:49:49,214 --> 00:49:50,799
I don't know.

467
00:49:52,342 --> 00:49:55,553
I don't really have
anywhere to go back to,

468
00:49:55,637 --> 00:49:57,222
so I guess anywhere.

469
00:50:03,979 --> 00:50:05,563
- Don't.
- Don't what?

470
00:50:05,647 --> 00:50:08,191
You're going to
give me some big hero speech,

471
00:50:08,275 --> 00:50:09,276
I can feel it.

472
00:50:10,527 --> 00:50:12,195
Speeches aren't really my thing.

473
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:13,280
Huh.

474
00:50:13,989 --> 00:50:15,657
It was more like an invitation.

475
00:50:16,825 --> 00:50:19,286
To go to the Red Room and kill Dreykov?

476
00:50:19,911 --> 00:50:20,912
Yeah.

477
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:23,331
Even though the Red Room
is impossible to find

478
00:50:23,415 --> 00:50:25,458
and Dreykov is too slippery to kill?

479
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:26,668
Yeah.

480
00:50:26,835 --> 00:50:29,671
That sounds like a shitload of work.

481
00:50:30,005 --> 00:50:31,047
Yup.

482
00:50:34,467 --> 00:50:36,052
Could be fun, though.

483
00:50:37,262 --> 00:50:38,471
Yup.

484
00:50:45,228 --> 00:50:46,521
I saw where he put the keys.

485
00:50:47,147 --> 00:50:50,108
Top drawer, green cabinet.

486
00:51:00,243 --> 00:51:02,120
You know, this is
the first piece of clothing

487
00:51:02,203 --> 00:51:03,705
I've ever bought for myself.

488
00:51:05,707 --> 00:51:07,083
That?

489
00:51:07,667 --> 00:51:08,668
Yeah. You don't like it?

490
00:51:08,835 --> 00:51:10,378
Is that like a...

491
00:51:11,421 --> 00:51:12,464
Is it army surplus, or...

492
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:14,090
Okay, it has a lot of pockets.

493
00:51:14,507 --> 00:51:16,801
But I use them all the time,

494
00:51:16,885 --> 00:51:19,179
and I made some of my own
modifications.

495
00:51:19,346 --> 00:51:20,972
- Oh, yeah?
- Whatever.

496
00:51:21,056 --> 00:51:23,350
Shut up. The point is, I've never...

497
00:51:23,516 --> 00:51:26,811
I've never had control
over my own life before, and now I do.

498
00:51:26,978 --> 00:51:28,646
I want to do things.

499
00:51:29,522 --> 00:51:30,607
Hmm...

500
00:51:31,024 --> 00:51:32,067
I like your vest.

501
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,944
I knew it. I knew you did.
It's so cool, right?

502
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:36,237
It's good. Yes. I like it.

503
00:51:36,404 --> 00:51:39,783
And you can put so much stuff in there.
You wouldn't even know.

504
00:51:44,037 --> 00:51:45,973
I really don't know where
the Red Room is, though.

505
00:51:45,997 --> 00:51:48,083
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

506
00:51:48,249 --> 00:51:51,086
But I think I know somebody who does.

507
00:51:51,252 --> 00:51:52,253
Oh, yeah? Who?

508
00:51:52,962 --> 00:51:54,589
We're gonna need a jet.

509
00:51:56,257 --> 00:51:57,717
I said we needed a jet.

510
00:51:58,593 --> 00:52:00,637
Yeah, you know what you didn't give me?
Time.

511
00:52:00,804 --> 00:52:02,389
Or money. I'm not made of jets.

512
00:52:02,555 --> 00:52:04,116
I thought you were
supposed to be the best.

513
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:05,141
Like a real pro.

514
00:52:05,308 --> 00:52:06,548
Oh, I beg your pardon, tsarina.

515
00:52:06,684 --> 00:52:08,524
Was the free flat
and lifetime supply of kissel

516
00:52:08,561 --> 00:52:10,230
- not to your liking?
- Ha!

517
00:52:10,397 --> 00:52:11,981
Don't let her wind you up.

518
00:52:12,148 --> 00:52:14,567
No, I take exception
to impugning my professionalism.

519
00:52:14,734 --> 00:52:18,571
Well, you did set me up with a generator
that crapped out after six hours.

520
00:52:18,738 --> 00:52:20,990
You, too, huh? Tag team.

521
00:52:21,157 --> 00:52:24,244
Aw, he's sensitive.
See why you keep him around.

522
00:52:24,411 --> 00:52:25,870
Where's the rest?

523
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:33,711
Voilà.

524
00:52:34,337 --> 00:52:35,547
Ooh.

525
00:52:36,673 --> 00:52:38,313
Oh, I stashed that, like, five years ago.

526
00:52:40,343 --> 00:52:41,594
How is it?

527
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,973
It's dry.
It's really dry.

528
00:52:49,978 --> 00:52:52,618
You know, you're getting dangerously close
to running out your tab.

529
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,234
Supplies I can tally, but you bring me
attention from the authorities,

530
00:52:56,317 --> 00:52:57,944
all my prices go up.

531
00:52:59,988 --> 00:53:01,148
What's that supposed to mean?

532
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:04,284
Your mate, Secretary Ross,
has been sniffing around my affairs

533
00:53:04,451 --> 00:53:07,412
to the point at which I've got
contacts declining my calls.

534
00:53:07,579 --> 00:53:09,497
I'm a private contractor.

535
00:53:10,915 --> 00:53:12,500
You are sensitive.

536
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:14,210
You're a very annoying individual.

537
00:53:16,713 --> 00:53:18,339
- I'll make it up to you.
- Mmm-hmm.

538
00:53:19,466 --> 00:53:21,259
That's what you say every time.

539
00:53:26,931 --> 00:53:29,726
So, I have the nuclear code.

540
00:53:29,893 --> 00:53:33,354
But there he is.

541
00:53:34,105 --> 00:53:38,067
- Captain America!
- America.

542
00:53:39,319 --> 00:53:44,365
Finally, the Red Guardian's time has come!

543
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,744
I grab hold of his shield

544
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:53,625
and face to face, it's a test of strength.

545
00:53:57,837 --> 00:54:00,924
Oh... Oh, no.

546
00:54:01,799 --> 00:54:03,801
Oh...

547
00:54:05,887 --> 00:54:07,305
That guy think he going to beat me.

548
00:54:07,472 --> 00:54:09,974
Anyway, this shield, you know,
that he carries with him

549
00:54:10,141 --> 00:54:12,936
like a precious baby blanket, you know?

550
00:54:13,102 --> 00:54:15,271
I use it to my advantage.
I take it

551
00:54:15,438 --> 00:54:16,638
and I push him out the window.

552
00:54:17,023 --> 00:54:19,150
And I make my escape. Huh?

553
00:54:19,776 --> 00:54:21,361
What year was this?

554
00:54:22,487 --> 00:54:24,989
I don't know.
Like, '83, '84.

555
00:54:25,156 --> 00:54:26,157
I know.

556
00:54:26,241 --> 00:54:29,536
Captain America was
still frozen in ice then.

557
00:54:32,914 --> 00:54:35,875
Are you calling me a liar, Ursa, huh?

558
00:54:45,385 --> 00:54:48,179
Alexei Shostakov! Mail Call.

559
00:54:48,805 --> 00:54:50,890
Oh, no.

560
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:53,059
Uh-oh.

561
00:54:53,142 --> 00:54:54,995
Alexei Shostakov! Mail Call.

562
00:54:55,019 --> 00:54:56,563
Aw, look at the big bear.

563
00:54:56,729 --> 00:54:58,398
Gonna cry, little girl?

564
00:55:10,326 --> 00:55:15,164
The famed "Red Guardian."

565
00:55:16,082 --> 00:55:20,753
When you write back, tell your
fans to use more butter.

566
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,589
Take it!

567
00:55:22,672 --> 00:55:23,715
Come on.

568
00:55:52,201 --> 00:55:53,804
Red Guardian forward!

569
00:55:53,828 --> 00:55:55,038
The trumpet is calling!

570
00:56:11,262 --> 00:56:13,264
Today is your lucky day, Alexei.

571
00:56:16,142 --> 00:56:17,542
Move to the door on the south wall.

572
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:27,362
What's up with you?

573
00:56:27,528 --> 00:56:28,696
Can't you read?

574
00:56:39,415 --> 00:56:40,416
Go left.

575
00:56:41,876 --> 00:56:42,919
Just don't make a scene.

576
00:56:47,215 --> 00:56:49,095
The Red Guardian is escaping!

577
00:56:58,434 --> 00:57:00,353
You made a scene, didn't you?

578
00:57:12,323 --> 00:57:13,991
What now?

579
00:57:14,158 --> 00:57:16,053
<i>We're gettin' you outta here.</i>

580
00:57:37,098 --> 00:57:38,458
Go to the upper level.

581
00:57:41,978 --> 00:57:43,229
<i>Move your ass, super soldier.</i>

582
00:57:55,491 --> 00:57:56,784
He's never going to make it.

583
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,369
Get me closer.

584
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:00,913
You got a better idea?

585
00:58:05,001 --> 00:58:06,127
Natasha.

586
00:58:17,889 --> 00:58:19,307
Such a poser.

587
00:58:43,873 --> 00:58:45,374
Seriously?

588
00:58:46,876 --> 00:58:47,960
Whoo!

589
00:58:48,461 --> 00:58:49,837
Sorry!

590
00:58:52,465 --> 00:58:54,217
What are you doing?
Are you kidding me?

591
00:58:54,842 --> 00:58:56,052
Back up!

592
00:58:56,636 --> 00:58:58,888
We're both doing
a really good job.

593
00:59:08,731 --> 00:59:10,024
No.

594
00:59:12,109 --> 00:59:13,820
Okay. Enough of this.

595
00:59:30,461 --> 00:59:31,462
Ha!

596
00:59:39,303 --> 00:59:41,347
Whoa...

597
00:59:46,477 --> 00:59:48,521
This would be a cool way to die.

598
00:59:52,275 --> 00:59:54,569
Tell me that's a good sign for us!

599
00:59:54,735 --> 00:59:55,862
Move your ass!

600
01:00:20,303 --> 01:00:21,929
Get us outta here!

601
01:00:22,638 --> 01:00:23,723
Huh.

602
01:01:07,475 --> 01:01:09,518
Wait!

603
01:01:35,836 --> 01:01:37,004
Yes!

604
01:01:39,298 --> 01:01:41,550
I need some help up here!

605
01:01:45,137 --> 01:01:48,474
Farewell, douchebags.

606
01:01:54,772 --> 01:01:56,440
Oh, that was exciting.

607
01:01:58,776 --> 01:02:01,654
Oh, I'm so proud of you girls.

608
01:02:02,446 --> 01:02:05,241
Oh, you can't hear me, huh?

609
01:02:05,324 --> 01:02:07,410
Okay.

610
01:02:08,411 --> 01:02:10,621
Ah...

611
01:02:11,247 --> 01:02:12,248
Wow.

612
01:02:15,167 --> 01:02:17,294
Okay.

613
01:02:18,504 --> 01:02:20,381
Why the aggression, huh?

614
01:02:21,173 --> 01:02:22,633
Is it your time of the month?

615
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:26,220
I don't get my period, dipshit.
I don't have a uterus.

616
01:02:26,512 --> 01:02:27,596
Or ovaries.

617
01:02:28,472 --> 01:02:30,117
Yeah. That's what happens
when the Red Room

618
01:02:30,141 --> 01:02:31,661
gives you an involuntary hysterectomy.

619
01:02:31,726 --> 01:02:36,272
They kind of just go in and they rip out
all of your reproductive organs.

620
01:02:36,439 --> 01:02:39,900
They just get right in there
and they chop them all away.

621
01:02:40,067 --> 01:02:43,046
- Everything out, so you can't have babies.
- Okay, okay. Okay! Okay!

622
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:45,573
You don't have to get
so clinical and nasty.

623
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:47,241
Oh, well, I was about to talk about

624
01:02:47,324 --> 01:02:49,577
- fallopian tubes, but okay.
- No.

625
01:02:50,202 --> 01:02:55,958
It means so much to me
that you came back for me.

626
01:02:56,125 --> 01:02:59,712
No. No. You're gonna tell us
how to get to the Red Room.

627
01:03:00,171 --> 01:03:01,380
Huh.

628
01:03:01,464 --> 01:03:03,257
Whoa, look at you, huh? All business.

629
01:03:03,424 --> 01:03:04,842
Trust me, this isn't pleasure.

630
01:03:05,009 --> 01:03:09,055
Little Natasha,
all indoctrinated into the Western agenda.

631
01:03:09,555 --> 01:03:12,349
I chose to go west to become an Avenger.

632
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:14,477
'Cause they treated me like family.

633
01:03:14,643 --> 01:03:16,479
Really? Family?

634
01:03:16,645 --> 01:03:18,939
Well, where are they now?

635
01:03:19,106 --> 01:03:21,776
Where is that family now?

636
01:03:21,942 --> 01:03:23,944
Tell me where the Red Room is.

637
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,075
I have no idea.

638
01:03:29,158 --> 01:03:30,326
Okay?

639
01:03:35,372 --> 01:03:36,957
Come on. You and Dreykov were like...

640
01:03:37,041 --> 01:03:38,125
- Dreykov?
- Yeah.

641
01:03:38,209 --> 01:03:40,628
General Dreykov, my friend, huh?

642
01:03:41,212 --> 01:03:43,130
Gives me glory...

643
01:03:43,297 --> 01:03:46,300
Soviet Union's first
and only super soldier.

644
01:03:46,467 --> 01:03:49,637
I could have been more famous
than Captain America.

645
01:03:49,804 --> 01:03:53,224
Then he buries me in Ohio
on that stupid mission.

646
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:54,809
Three years!

647
01:03:54,975 --> 01:03:57,937
So tedious, boring me to tears.

648
01:04:00,898 --> 01:04:02,358
No offense, huh?

649
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,861
Then puts me in prison
for the rest of my life. Why, huh?

650
01:04:06,028 --> 01:04:07,547
Why? Why would he put me in...
You know why?

651
01:04:07,571 --> 01:04:10,241
'Cause maybe I want to talk
about the withering of the state.

652
01:04:10,407 --> 01:04:12,052
Or maybe I don't like
his hair or something

653
01:04:12,076 --> 01:04:13,470
and I say something casually about that.

654
01:04:13,494 --> 01:04:14,495
Maybe, you know,

655
01:04:14,578 --> 01:04:16,622
I want the Party
to feel actually like a party

656
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:19,166
instead of this sourpuss organization.

657
01:04:19,959 --> 01:04:21,502
But instead, no.

658
01:04:21,877 --> 01:04:24,672
He puts me in prison
for the rest of my life.

659
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:26,966
He just runs off and hides, huh?

660
01:04:27,508 --> 01:04:30,886
I'm not even the one who, uh, you know...

661
01:04:33,055 --> 01:04:34,890
I'm not the one who killed his daughter.

662
01:04:36,267 --> 01:04:38,161
Can we throw him
out the window now?

663
01:04:38,185 --> 01:04:40,163
I think we should wait
till we get to a higher altitude.

664
01:04:40,187 --> 01:04:41,188
All right.

665
01:04:41,272 --> 01:04:43,691
Why not ask Melina where it is?

666
01:04:44,024 --> 01:04:45,210
Wait, Mom Melina?

667
01:04:45,234 --> 01:04:47,236
We thought she was dead.

668
01:04:47,319 --> 01:04:50,114
You cannot kill a fox that swift.

669
01:04:50,281 --> 01:04:51,448
- Ew.
- What?

670
01:04:51,991 --> 01:04:56,203
She was the scientist, the strategist.
I was the muscle.

671
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:58,873
She worked directly for Dreykov
far more than I ever did.

672
01:04:58,956 --> 01:05:02,501
Wait. Are you telling me that Melina
is working for the Red Room present day?

673
01:05:02,668 --> 01:05:04,920
She works remotely outside St. Petersburg.

674
01:05:05,004 --> 01:05:06,839
Uh...

675
01:05:07,173 --> 01:05:09,758
I don't think we have enough
fuel for St. Petersburg.

676
01:05:09,925 --> 01:05:11,510
No, we're good. We'll make it.

677
01:05:12,136 --> 01:05:13,137
Okay.

678
01:05:33,157 --> 01:05:35,701
You should've brought
the Avengers' superjet.

679
01:05:39,872 --> 01:05:41,832
I swear, if I hear
one more word from him,

680
01:05:41,999 --> 01:05:44,239
- I will kick him in the face.
- He's the worst.

681
01:05:44,335 --> 01:05:45,920
Natasha.

682
01:05:46,086 --> 01:05:47,463
Natasha. Natasha.

683
01:05:47,630 --> 01:05:50,549
Come here, I want to ask you something.

684
01:05:50,716 --> 01:05:52,635
- Come, it's important.
- What?

685
01:05:57,097 --> 01:05:58,724
Did he talk to you about me?

686
01:05:59,975 --> 01:06:01,101
What?

687
01:06:01,852 --> 01:06:05,272
Did he talk to you about me?
You know, trading war stories?

688
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,583
Who? What are you talking about?

689
01:06:06,607 --> 01:06:08,859
Captain America.

690
01:06:09,026 --> 01:06:13,989
My great adversary
in this theater of geopolitical conflict.

691
01:06:14,156 --> 01:06:15,991
Not so much a nemesis.

692
01:06:16,075 --> 01:06:18,077
More like a contemporary, you know?
Coequal.

693
01:06:18,244 --> 01:06:20,597
I always thought there was
a great deal of mutual respect...

694
01:06:20,621 --> 01:06:22,665
Wait. You haven't seen
either one of us in 20 years

695
01:06:22,831 --> 01:06:24,375
and you're gonna ask me about you?

696
01:06:25,626 --> 01:06:27,670
What is with this tension?

697
01:06:29,630 --> 01:06:30,923
Did I do something wrong?

698
01:06:32,549 --> 01:06:34,093
Is that a serious question?

699
01:06:35,344 --> 01:06:37,346
I only ever loved you girls.

700
01:06:37,972 --> 01:06:40,015
I did my best to make sure
you would succeed

701
01:06:40,182 --> 01:06:42,017
to achieve your fullest potential,

702
01:06:42,101 --> 01:06:43,995
- and everything worked out.
- Everything worked out?

703
01:06:44,019 --> 01:06:46,397
Yes. For you, yes.

704
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:50,526
We accomplished our mission in Ohio.

705
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:54,071
Yelena, you went on to become
the greatest child assassin

706
01:06:54,154 --> 01:06:55,447
the world has ever known.

707
01:06:55,614 --> 01:06:59,576
No one can match your efficiency,
your ruthlessness.

708
01:06:59,868 --> 01:07:01,704
And Natasha,

709
01:07:02,037 --> 01:07:06,750
not just a spy,
not just toppling regimes,

710
01:07:06,917 --> 01:07:09,044
destroying empires from within,

711
01:07:09,628 --> 01:07:11,380
but an Avenger.

712
01:07:12,298 --> 01:07:15,259
You both have killed

713
01:07:15,968 --> 01:07:17,803
so many people.

714
01:07:18,554 --> 01:07:22,057
Your ledgers must be dripping,
just gushing red.

715
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:24,810
I couldn't be more proud of you.

716
01:07:29,273 --> 01:07:30,566
Okay. You can... No.

717
01:07:30,733 --> 01:07:32,484
Let go of me now.

718
01:07:32,651 --> 01:07:34,445
You smell really bad.

719
01:07:38,991 --> 01:07:41,327
So, are we there yet?

720
01:07:41,493 --> 01:07:43,537
You'll know when we're there.

721
01:07:45,622 --> 01:07:47,249
Slight right.

722
01:07:48,584 --> 01:07:49,793
Straight on.

723
01:07:50,627 --> 01:07:51,628
Right.

724
01:07:54,214 --> 01:07:55,257
Slight right.

725
01:07:56,175 --> 01:07:58,594
Oh, very good, my darling.

726
01:07:59,762 --> 01:08:01,930
Yes, very good.

727
01:08:02,097 --> 01:08:05,184
Yes, very good, my darling.

728
01:08:17,529 --> 01:08:20,824
Back home where it's safe.
Come on. Go on.

729
01:09:09,331 --> 01:09:12,668
Honey, we're home.

730
01:09:23,846 --> 01:09:25,597
Come on, girls.

731
01:09:35,691 --> 01:09:38,402
Welcome to my humble abode.

732
01:09:39,027 --> 01:09:40,821
Make yourself at home.

733
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:45,033
Let's have a drink.

734
01:10:00,048 --> 01:10:01,550
Hey, no funny business.

735
01:10:02,718 --> 01:10:04,970
I am putting away my weapon.

736
01:10:28,702 --> 01:10:30,096
Are there
any booby traps around here?

737
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,347
Anything we need to know about?

738
01:10:31,371 --> 01:10:33,011
I didn't raise my girls to fall in traps.

739
01:10:33,165 --> 01:10:34,917
You didn't raise us at all.

740
01:10:37,002 --> 01:10:38,545
Oh, maybe so.

741
01:10:38,921 --> 01:10:42,216
But if you got soft,
it wasn't on my watch.

742
01:11:04,696 --> 01:11:06,448
Let's drink.

743
01:11:08,325 --> 01:11:09,535
Okay.

744
01:11:20,754 --> 01:11:22,089
Still fits.

745
01:11:23,632 --> 01:11:25,300
Oh, my God.

746
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:29,721
I never washed it once.

747
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:31,473
Come and drink.

748
01:11:34,893 --> 01:11:37,437
<i>Rise, you workers of salvation</i>

749
01:11:40,524 --> 01:11:42,317
Family

750
01:11:43,026 --> 01:11:44,945
back together again.

751
01:11:45,529 --> 01:11:47,739
- Mmm.
- Seeing as our

752
01:11:47,823 --> 01:11:48,991
family construct

753
01:11:49,157 --> 01:11:51,952
was just a calculated ruse
that only lasted three years,

754
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:56,456
I don't think that we can use
this term anymore, can we?

755
01:11:56,623 --> 01:11:59,084
Agreed. So, here's what's gonna happen...

756
01:11:59,251 --> 01:12:02,379
Okay. A reunion then, huh?

757
01:12:02,546 --> 01:12:03,630
And, uh...

758
01:12:04,381 --> 01:12:06,216
I want to say something
right off the bat.

759
01:12:06,592 --> 01:12:08,510
You haven't aged a day, huh?

760
01:12:08,677 --> 01:12:13,807
You're just as beautiful and as supple
as the day they staged our marriage.

761
01:12:15,267 --> 01:12:16,768
You got fat.

762
01:12:17,436 --> 01:12:20,063
But still good.

763
01:12:20,647 --> 01:12:22,983
I just got out of prison. I, uh...

764
01:12:24,943 --> 01:12:26,463
- I have a lot of energy.
- Oh!

765
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:28,447
Please don't do that.

766
01:12:30,449 --> 01:12:32,534
So, here's what's gonna happen.

767
01:12:32,701 --> 01:12:34,119
Natasha, don't slouch.

768
01:12:35,037 --> 01:12:36,997
- I'm not slouching.
- Yes, yes, you are.

769
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,081
I don't slouch.

770
01:12:38,165 --> 01:12:39,434
You're going to get a back hunch.

771
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:40,768
- Listen to your mother.
- Oh, my God, this...

772
01:12:40,792 --> 01:12:41,793
Up, up.

773
01:12:41,877 --> 01:12:43,295
All right, enough. All of you.

774
01:12:43,462 --> 01:12:45,213
I didn't say anything.
That's not fair.

775
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:46,941
- Here's what's gonna happen...
- I don't want any food.

776
01:12:46,965 --> 01:12:49,110
Eat a little something,
Yelena, for God's sake.

777
01:12:49,134 --> 01:12:51,094
You're gonna tell us
the location of the Red Room.

778
01:12:54,765 --> 01:12:57,601
You know, it's like when you told them

779
01:12:57,684 --> 01:12:59,811
that they could stay up late
to catch Santa Claus.

780
01:12:59,978 --> 01:13:02,123
What? That was fun. You know,
"He come down the chimney, girls.

781
01:13:02,147 --> 01:13:03,482
"Look out. Where is he?"

782
01:13:03,565 --> 01:13:06,443
You wait for him,
and then when the cookies are gone,

783
01:13:06,610 --> 01:13:08,487
then you see he's there.

784
01:13:08,654 --> 01:13:10,530
No, no. What? I want them

785
01:13:10,614 --> 01:13:12,334
- to follow their dreams.
- No good.

786
01:13:12,407 --> 01:13:14,451
Reach for the stars, girls.

787
01:13:14,618 --> 01:13:17,120
Finding Dreykov is not a fantasy.
It's unfinished business.

788
01:13:17,287 --> 01:13:21,166
You can't defeat a man
who commands the very will of others.

789
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:25,212
You never saw the culmination
of what we started in America.

790
01:13:25,379 --> 01:13:26,713
Nor did you.

791
01:13:29,341 --> 01:13:33,595
Natasha, always focus, focus.
Get what you want.

792
01:13:40,727 --> 01:13:41,728
Come in.

793
01:13:49,069 --> 01:13:50,612
Did that pig just open the door?

794
01:13:50,779 --> 01:13:52,864
Yes. It did.

795
01:13:53,031 --> 01:13:55,784
Good boy, Alexei.
Good boy.

796
01:13:56,785 --> 01:13:58,578
You named a pig after me?

797
01:13:59,204 --> 01:14:00,956
You don't see the resemblance?

798
01:14:04,918 --> 01:14:06,378
See, he sits just like dog.

799
01:14:07,379 --> 01:14:08,797
Amazing. Now, watch.

800
01:14:08,964 --> 01:14:10,364
It's a little weird, to me.

801
01:14:10,424 --> 01:14:11,925
Stop breathing.

802
01:14:17,305 --> 01:14:20,642
We infiltrated
the North Institute in Ohio.

803
01:14:20,809 --> 01:14:22,412
It was a front
for S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists.

804
01:14:22,436 --> 01:14:25,689
Actually, it was Hydra scientists
at that time.

805
01:14:25,856 --> 01:14:27,542
In conjunction with
the Winter Soldier project,

806
01:14:27,566 --> 01:14:30,444
they had dissected
and deconstructed the human brain

807
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:35,282
to create the first and only
cellular blueprint of the basal ganglia.

808
01:14:35,449 --> 01:14:36,867
Was the hub for cognition.

809
01:14:37,033 --> 01:14:40,328
Voluntary motor movement,
procedural learning.

810
01:14:41,997 --> 01:14:45,625
We didn't steal weaponry or technology.

811
01:14:45,792 --> 01:14:48,628
We stole the key to unlocking free will.

812
01:14:54,468 --> 01:14:55,469
What are you doing?

813
01:14:55,594 --> 01:14:59,264
Oh, I am explaining
that the science is now so exact,

814
01:14:59,431 --> 01:15:01,641
the subject can be instructed
to stop breathing

815
01:15:01,808 --> 01:15:03,685
and has no choice but to obey.

816
01:15:03,852 --> 01:15:05,452
Okay, you made your point.
That's enough.

817
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:08,398
Yes, all right. Well, don't worry,
Alexei could've survived

818
01:15:08,565 --> 01:15:11,151
11 more seconds without oxygen.

819
01:15:11,318 --> 01:15:14,112
Good boy. Now, you go back,
back home where it's safe.

820
01:15:15,655 --> 01:15:17,741
You go. You go back home,
back home where it's safe.

821
01:15:18,492 --> 01:15:20,160
Good boy, Alexei.

822
01:15:20,327 --> 01:15:23,955
The world functions on a higher level
when it is controlled.

823
01:15:24,122 --> 01:15:28,502
Dreykov has chemically subjugated agents
planted around the globe.

824
01:15:28,835 --> 01:15:30,796
And do you know who they test it on?

825
01:15:30,879 --> 01:15:32,214
Hmm...

826
01:15:32,297 --> 01:15:34,049
No. That's not my department.

827
01:15:34,132 --> 01:15:36,009
Ah, come on, come on.

828
01:15:36,176 --> 01:15:38,053
- Don't lie to them. Hmm?
- I'm not lying.

829
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:39,679
You're Dreykov's architect, huh?

830
01:15:39,846 --> 01:15:40,847
What were you?

831
01:15:40,931 --> 01:15:42,658
If I was his architect,
you were his partner.

832
01:15:42,682 --> 01:15:43,785
You were his business partner.

833
01:15:43,809 --> 01:15:45,161
No, no, no. I was patsy!

834
01:15:45,185 --> 01:15:47,479
- Don't give me that...
- He sell me ideology.

835
01:15:47,646 --> 01:15:48,956
- Stop with the politics.
- All the while, bigger...

836
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:51,775
Shut up! You are an idiot.

837
01:15:56,363 --> 01:15:57,864
And you're a coward.

838
01:16:00,283 --> 01:16:01,827
You're a coward.

839
01:16:01,993 --> 01:16:06,122
And our family was never real,
so there's nothing to hold on to.

840
01:16:07,415 --> 01:16:08,917
We're moving on.

841
01:16:09,084 --> 01:16:11,419
Never family, huh?

842
01:16:11,586 --> 01:16:14,256
In my heart, I am simple man.

843
01:16:15,173 --> 01:16:18,426
And I think that for a couple
deep undercover Russian agents

844
01:16:18,593 --> 01:16:20,637
I think we did pretty great
as parents, huh?

845
01:16:20,929 --> 01:16:24,266
Yes, we had our orders,
and we played our roles to perfection.

846
01:16:24,808 --> 01:16:27,102
Who cares? That wasn't real.

847
01:16:27,394 --> 01:16:29,813
- What?
- That wasn't real. Who cares?

848
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:31,731
Don't say that.

849
01:16:32,274 --> 01:16:34,818
Please don't say that.
It was real.

850
01:16:35,569 --> 01:16:38,530
It was real to me.
You are my mother.

851
01:16:39,739 --> 01:16:41,449
You were my real mother.

852
01:16:41,616 --> 01:16:44,244
The closest thing I ever had to one.

853
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:48,206
The best part of my life was fake.

854
01:16:49,708 --> 01:16:52,043
And none of you told me.

855
01:16:55,005 --> 01:16:57,132
And those agents

856
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:59,926
you chemically subjugated
around the globe?

857
01:17:01,511 --> 01:17:03,555
That was me.

858
01:17:05,849 --> 01:17:06,850
Mmm.

859
01:17:09,811 --> 01:17:11,730
And you, you got out.

860
01:17:11,897 --> 01:17:14,274
Dreykov made sure no one could escape.

861
01:17:15,108 --> 01:17:17,152
Are you gonna say anything?

862
01:17:20,697 --> 01:17:21,698
No.

863
01:17:23,158 --> 01:17:24,159
Don't touch me.

864
01:17:27,495 --> 01:17:28,496
Yelena.

865
01:17:28,872 --> 01:17:30,081
No.

866
01:17:33,919 --> 01:17:36,421
- I had no idea.
- It's okay, it's okay.

867
01:17:36,588 --> 01:17:38,465
I'll go talk to her.

868
01:17:54,522 --> 01:17:57,025
I came in here
because I didn't want to talk.

869
01:17:58,735 --> 01:17:59,861
Okay.

870
01:18:00,904 --> 01:18:03,031
We, uh... We just sit.

871
01:18:07,869 --> 01:18:09,371
We just sit.

872
01:18:18,922 --> 01:18:20,090
Where are you going?

873
01:18:20,256 --> 01:18:22,592
- To do this myself.
- Don't. You won't survive.

874
01:18:22,759 --> 01:18:25,095
I wish I could believe that you cared.

875
01:18:25,929 --> 01:18:28,098
But you're not even the first mother
that abandoned me.

876
01:18:28,264 --> 01:18:30,392
No, you weren't abandoned.

877
01:18:30,558 --> 01:18:32,519
You were selected by a program

878
01:18:32,602 --> 01:18:34,604
that assessed
the genetic potential in infants.

879
01:18:44,739 --> 01:18:46,241
I was taken?

880
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:50,161
I believe a bargain was struck,
your family paid off.

881
01:18:50,787 --> 01:18:53,206
But your mother,
she never stopped looking for you.

882
01:18:53,373 --> 01:18:56,292
She was like you in that way.
She was

883
01:18:56,459 --> 01:18:58,003
relentless.

884
01:18:58,753 --> 01:19:00,380
What happened to her?

885
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:03,842
Dreykov had her killed.

886
01:19:05,135 --> 01:19:07,971
Her existence threatened
to uncover the Red Room.

887
01:19:09,014 --> 01:19:11,433
Normally, the actions
of one curious civilian

888
01:19:11,516 --> 01:19:12,716
wouldn't warrant an execution,

889
01:19:12,767 --> 01:19:15,478
but, as I said, she was relentless.

890
01:19:18,231 --> 01:19:21,067
I thought about her every day of my life.

891
01:19:25,655 --> 01:19:28,491
Whether or not I admitted it to myself,
I did.

892
01:19:30,952 --> 01:19:33,329
I've always found it best
not to look into the past.

893
01:19:44,466 --> 01:19:45,967
Then why did you save this?

894
01:20:03,902 --> 01:20:05,820
I remember this day.

895
01:20:05,987 --> 01:20:09,949
We shot Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter
and summer vacation all in one day.

896
01:20:10,575 --> 01:20:12,577
- Different backdrops.
- Mmm.

897
01:20:14,037 --> 01:20:18,583
I knew all the presents under the tree
were just empty boxes, but I didn't care.

898
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:20,418
I wanted to open every single one...

899
01:20:23,838 --> 01:20:26,633
so just for a second it would feel real.

900
01:20:27,217 --> 01:20:28,593
Let's stop this.

901
01:20:36,142 --> 01:20:37,644
Why you doing this?

902
01:20:38,853 --> 01:20:42,732
Why does a mouse born in a cage
run on that little wheel?

903
01:20:42,899 --> 01:20:45,527
Do you know I was cycled
through the Red Room

904
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:48,196
four times before you were even born?

905
01:20:48,363 --> 01:20:49,781
Those walls are all I know.

906
01:20:50,532 --> 01:20:52,784
I was never given a choice.

907
01:20:53,201 --> 01:20:55,495
But you're not a mouse, Melina.

908
01:20:57,997 --> 01:21:01,126
You were just born in a cage,
but that's not your fault.

909
01:21:05,171 --> 01:21:08,049
Tell me, how did you keep your heart?

910
01:21:14,013 --> 01:21:16,182
Pain only makes us stronger.

911
01:21:17,183 --> 01:21:19,102
Didn't you tell us that?

912
01:21:21,104 --> 01:21:23,523
What you taught me kept me alive.

913
01:21:27,235 --> 01:21:29,237
I'm sorry, I already alerted the Red Room.

914
01:21:29,404 --> 01:21:31,364
They'll be here any minute.

915
01:21:34,492 --> 01:21:38,830
So, there I am
ice fishing with my father.

916
01:21:39,831 --> 01:21:42,041
It's very cold day
in this little ice shed.

917
01:21:42,125 --> 01:21:43,501
Cold even for Russia, you know?

918
01:21:43,668 --> 01:21:46,421
"Keep the vodka by the fire,"
my father would say to me.

919
01:21:46,588 --> 01:21:47,714
Please stop talking.

920
01:21:47,797 --> 01:21:48,899
- Please wait. Please wait.
- Please, no.

921
01:21:48,923 --> 01:21:49,984
Please, I don't want to talk.

922
01:21:50,008 --> 01:21:51,551
Please. Please.

923
01:21:52,177 --> 01:21:54,888
There is a reason why
I'm telling you this, okay? Trust me.

924
01:21:55,263 --> 01:21:57,557
I am reaching for fish.

925
01:21:59,058 --> 01:22:02,020
Oh! I lose balance. Ah!

926
01:22:02,103 --> 01:22:03,104
Splash!

927
01:22:03,188 --> 01:22:05,106
My hands go in the river.

928
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:09,277
In this weather,
frostbite sets in quick.

929
01:22:09,736 --> 01:22:13,448
My father, he go toilet on my hands.

930
01:22:13,615 --> 01:22:14,741
Oh, my God.

931
01:22:14,908 --> 01:22:19,704
Urine is 35 degrees Celsius,
staves off the frostbite.

932
01:22:19,871 --> 01:22:21,372
How is this relevant?

933
01:22:22,165 --> 01:22:23,458
You know,

934
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:25,251
fathers.

935
01:22:27,795 --> 01:22:30,381
No. No.

936
01:22:31,049 --> 01:22:34,552
You have done nothing
but tell me how bored you were.

937
01:22:34,928 --> 01:22:38,932
I was the chore,
the job you didn't want to do.

938
01:22:39,307 --> 01:22:40,600
To me?

939
01:22:41,643 --> 01:22:43,853
To me, you were everything.

940
01:22:46,522 --> 01:22:49,901
Exactly. You don't care.
You don't care.

941
01:22:50,401 --> 01:22:52,820
The only thing you care about
are your stupid glory days

942
01:22:52,987 --> 01:22:56,241
as the Crimson Dynamo,
and no one wants to hear about it.

943
01:23:02,872 --> 01:23:04,749
It's the Red Guardian.

944
01:23:04,916 --> 01:23:06,000
Get out.

945
01:23:06,376 --> 01:23:07,961

They think...

965
01:25:44,075 --> 01:25:45,535
I'm sorry.

966
01:26:01,592 --> 01:26:03,636
Let's not keep him waiting.

967
01:26:29,696 --> 01:26:31,865
Request clearance for landing.

968
01:26:31,948 --> 01:26:33,175
Copy that.

969
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:34,385
You are cleared to land on bay 5.

970
01:26:34,409 --> 01:26:35,451
Melina?

971
01:26:40,331 --> 01:26:42,171
We're touching down in one minute.

972
01:26:42,292 --> 01:26:44,919
Then why are we still going up?

973
01:26:47,172 --> 01:26:50,592
Now you'll know how Dreykov stayed
above the radar all these years.

974
01:28:10,255 --> 01:28:11,506
My God.

975
01:28:11,673 --> 01:28:13,216
Look at you.

976
01:28:16,177 --> 01:28:17,178
So, uh,

977
01:28:17,762 --> 01:28:19,389
how was the family reunion?

978
01:28:19,555 --> 01:28:21,432
Oh, it was awful.

979
01:28:21,599 --> 01:28:22,684
They were clingy,

980
01:28:22,767 --> 01:28:24,894
and too emotional, and needy.

981
01:28:25,061 --> 01:28:27,438
- Just like old times, huh?
- Hmm.

982
01:28:27,522 --> 01:28:29,023
Yelena Belova.

983
01:28:29,190 --> 01:28:30,900
What's the deal with her?

984
01:28:31,067 --> 01:28:33,319
She was the only one affected, right?

985
01:28:33,486 --> 01:28:35,029
As far as I know, yes.

986
01:28:35,613 --> 01:28:38,157
These gasses and antidotes,

987
01:28:38,783 --> 01:28:41,411
it's a pain in my ass.

988
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:44,956
It's a problem. You need to sort it.

989
01:28:45,039 --> 01:28:46,374
Hmm. I have nine pigs

990
01:28:46,457 --> 01:28:47,601
that will require attending to
in my absence.

991
01:28:47,625 --> 01:28:50,837
Don't give a shit about your pigs.

992
01:28:57,051 --> 01:28:58,303
Cut her brain out...

993
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:01,806
Hmm? Identify the weakness.

994
01:29:11,357 --> 01:29:13,901
This is a much less cool way to die.

995
01:29:22,869 --> 01:29:24,287
Alexei.

996
01:29:33,254 --> 01:29:34,797
What about Romanoff?

997
01:29:34,964 --> 01:29:36,257
She's a traitor.

998
01:29:37,133 --> 01:29:41,220
She turned her back on her people.
On her blood.

999
01:29:42,221 --> 01:29:44,140
She had nothing.

1000
01:29:44,307 --> 01:29:48,102
I gave her home.
I gave her love.

1001
01:29:48,603 --> 01:29:50,897
Put that thing in her you do.

1002
01:29:51,064 --> 01:29:53,149
You know, uh, chemicals.

1003
01:29:54,192 --> 01:29:57,320
Turn her into one of your pigs.

1004
01:29:57,904 --> 01:30:02,450
Can you imagine what I could do
with an Avenger under my control?

1005
01:30:02,617 --> 01:30:05,078
Wouldn't you like to speak to her first?

1006
01:30:05,244 --> 01:30:08,664
When you look into the eyes
of a child you have raised,

1007
01:30:09,165 --> 01:30:12,210
no mask in the world can hide that.

1008
01:30:26,099 --> 01:30:27,266
Welcome home.

1009
01:30:29,268 --> 01:30:30,937
Now, now.

1010
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:34,399
Don't go breaking my new toy.

1011
01:30:36,275 --> 01:30:37,568
Natasha.

1012
01:30:39,862 --> 01:30:41,739
I can't save us.

1013
01:30:42,657 --> 01:30:44,537
<i>I need you to know that I'm sorry.</i>

1014
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,577
<i>I pledged my life to a cause.</i>

1015
01:30:46,744 --> 01:30:49,080
You know, I thought
I was being very brave.

1016
01:30:49,247 --> 01:30:50,373
Possibly the bravest.

1017
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:53,042
<i>But I wasn't being brave.</i>

1018
01:30:53,209 --> 01:30:54,752
I was coward.

1019
01:31:00,633 --> 01:31:02,009
In Cuba,

1020
01:31:03,553 --> 01:31:05,847
when they came
and took you away from me...

1021
01:31:07,181 --> 01:31:09,725
No cause is worth that.

1022
01:31:12,186 --> 01:31:14,647
You should only sacrifice yourself

1023
01:31:15,523 --> 01:31:17,066
for something...

1024
01:31:24,907 --> 01:31:26,784
How did you do that?

1025
01:31:27,577 --> 01:31:29,829
I designed these cells myself.

1026
01:31:32,999 --> 01:31:34,208
What?

1027
01:31:36,043 --> 01:31:37,044
What?

1028
01:31:37,545 --> 01:31:40,923
I bared my soul to you
and it was just you the whole time?

1029
01:31:41,090 --> 01:31:44,677
Yes, I'm afraid so.
But wait, shh, I'm on comms with Yelena.

1030
01:31:45,261 --> 01:31:47,847
Yelena, it's me. It's Mama.

1031
01:31:48,014 --> 01:31:50,975
<i>You have a two-inch blade
concealed in your beltline.</i>

1032
01:31:51,142 --> 01:31:52,143
What?

1033
01:31:55,313 --> 01:31:57,315
What are you going to do to me?

1034
01:31:58,649 --> 01:31:59,689
<i>Outside right hip.</i>

1035
01:32:01,694 --> 01:32:03,488
Keep her awake

1036
01:32:03,571 --> 01:32:05,364
for the cranial incisions.

1037
01:32:27,345 --> 01:32:29,013
You couldn't have told me sooner?

1038
01:32:29,096 --> 01:32:30,181
<i>Don't throw a fit.</i>

1039
01:32:30,348 --> 01:32:31,700
- There wasn't time.
- Okay, girls,

1040
01:32:31,724 --> 01:32:32,975
I'm having trouble hearing you,

1041
01:32:33,059 --> 01:32:35,937
but, Natasha,
there's something I need you to know.

1042
01:32:36,354 --> 01:32:40,775
I need you to know that I'm sorry.
No more excuses, okay?

1043
01:32:41,442 --> 01:32:44,362
I gave my life for a cause.
I thought I was being brave.

1044
01:32:44,529 --> 01:32:46,572
You don't have earpiece.

1045
01:32:47,281 --> 01:32:48,282
What?

1046
01:32:48,449 --> 01:32:49,575
No, she can't hear you.

1047
01:32:49,742 --> 01:32:51,182
- You don't have earpiece.
- Why not?

1048
01:32:51,327 --> 01:32:52,727
Because it wasn't part of the plan.

1049
01:32:52,787 --> 01:32:54,330
Oh, yeah?
Well, what was the plan?

1050
01:32:55,039 --> 01:32:56,183
So, once we're inside,

1051
01:32:56,207 --> 01:32:58,247
I'll activate my tracker
and Ross will come running.

1052
01:32:58,292 --> 01:33:01,462
You are aware that
you are still a global fugitive, yes?

1053
01:33:02,046 --> 01:33:04,423
You know the facility.
There must be some way to land it.

1054
01:33:05,591 --> 01:33:08,886
Instruct them to confine us on level zero.

1055
01:33:09,053 --> 01:33:11,722
Once I'm out,
I can activate the landing protocol,

1056
01:33:11,889 --> 01:33:13,307
we can descend within the hour.

1057
01:33:13,391 --> 01:33:15,059
Ah, problem.

1058
01:33:15,226 --> 01:33:17,812
I only have one earpiece set.

1059
01:33:18,604 --> 01:33:19,730
I'll give it to Yelena.

1060
01:33:20,398 --> 01:33:21,518
Where did he take the vials?

1061
01:33:21,649 --> 01:33:23,568
<i>Probably down to cold storage.</i>

1062
01:33:23,734 --> 01:33:26,070
Dreykov still has the widows
under his control,

1063
01:33:26,237 --> 01:33:28,823
<i>so you have to expose them
to this antidote.</i>

1064
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:31,951
Yeah. Sure. Easy.

1065
01:33:33,619 --> 01:33:34,704
Is this your plan?

1066
01:33:35,162 --> 01:33:36,497
My plan is to kill you.

1067
01:33:36,664 --> 01:33:38,082
I'm alive.

1068
01:33:39,166 --> 01:33:40,918
So, what do we do now?

1069
01:33:42,211 --> 01:33:44,297
What was my mother's name?

1070
01:33:47,883 --> 01:33:48,968
Ah...

1071
01:33:50,011 --> 01:33:52,138
Where we buried her,

1072
01:33:52,763 --> 01:33:54,640
there was a tree...

1073
01:33:55,266 --> 01:33:56,684
Um...

1074
01:33:57,101 --> 01:33:58,644
A pink blossom.

1075
01:33:59,061 --> 01:34:00,521
Beautiful.

1076
01:34:00,688 --> 01:34:02,440
And there was a tombstone

1077
01:34:02,607 --> 01:34:05,234
with her name engraved on it.

1078
01:34:06,027 --> 01:34:07,528
What was her name?

1079
01:34:07,612 --> 01:34:09,113
Ah.

1080
01:34:11,449 --> 01:34:14,827
"Unknown."

1081
01:34:16,871 --> 01:34:19,165
You don't feel anything?

1082
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:22,710
You feel anything
when I killed your daughter?

1083
01:34:22,877 --> 01:34:26,130
Is this your haunted past?

1084
01:34:28,215 --> 01:34:30,217
Really?

1085
01:34:39,769 --> 01:34:42,438
Thank you, Natasha.

1086
01:34:46,692 --> 01:34:49,278
You gave me my greatest weapon.

1087
01:34:53,032 --> 01:34:54,116
Say hello.

1088
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:11,801
When your bomb exploded,

1089
01:35:11,967 --> 01:35:14,512
it nearly killed my Antonia.

1090
01:35:18,265 --> 01:35:22,103
I had to put a chip
in the back of her neck.

1091
01:35:22,269 --> 01:35:24,605
In the back of her neck.

1092
01:35:25,022 --> 01:35:26,982
Look at her.

1093
01:35:27,483 --> 01:35:29,694
You find it difficult to look at her?

1094
01:35:30,611 --> 01:35:31,946
I do.

1095
01:35:32,822 --> 01:35:35,449
She... She watches everything

1096
01:35:36,325 --> 01:35:37,535
and she can do it.

1097
01:35:38,077 --> 01:35:40,121
She's a perfect mimic.

1098
01:35:42,206 --> 01:35:45,042
And she fights
just like all of your friends.

1099
01:35:49,714 --> 01:35:51,298
Can she hear me?

1100
01:35:54,677 --> 01:35:55,886
What?

1101
01:35:57,972 --> 01:36:00,099
You want to make her feel better?

1102
01:36:02,059 --> 01:36:04,729
You want to tell her you're sorry?

1103
01:36:06,063 --> 01:36:09,942
Well, you should have thought of that
before you blew her face off.

1104
01:36:11,944 --> 01:36:14,488
But enough of all this bullshit.

1105
01:36:15,823 --> 01:36:16,949
Go to work.

1106
01:36:17,116 --> 01:36:19,160
I have rats in the basement. Go.

1107
01:36:21,704 --> 01:36:22,955
Go.

1108
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:36,135
Well, that was a mistake.

1109
01:36:36,802 --> 01:36:37,887
Was it?

1110
01:36:38,387 --> 01:36:41,432
You just sent away the one thing
that would stop me from killing you.

1111
01:36:43,184 --> 01:36:44,185
Try, then.

1112
01:36:44,351 --> 01:36:45,561
Do it.

1113
01:36:50,357 --> 01:36:51,859
Is the safety on?

1114
01:36:56,947 --> 01:36:57,948
No.

1115
01:37:01,786 --> 01:37:03,621
Try your knife.

1116
01:37:04,497 --> 01:37:05,581
Ah...

1117
01:37:12,588 --> 01:37:13,672
You're in trouble.

1118
01:37:13,839 --> 01:37:15,174
How are you controlling me?

1119
01:37:15,341 --> 01:37:17,384
I'm not controlling you, Natasha.

1120
01:37:18,052 --> 01:37:19,428
Well, not yet.

1121
01:37:20,054 --> 01:37:22,223
But there is a pheromonal lock.

1122
01:37:22,556 --> 01:37:26,977
Smelling my pheromones prevents you
from committing violence against me.

1123
01:37:31,524 --> 01:37:34,193
I'm very upset with Melina.

1124
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:35,986
It's a shame I have to kill her.

1125
01:37:36,946 --> 01:37:38,632
Come on, now.
If we're just going to

1126
01:37:38,656 --> 01:37:40,491
press buttons and hack computers...

1127
01:37:40,658 --> 01:37:41,718
- Yes.
- I mean, I don't know.

1128
01:37:41,742 --> 01:37:42,844
There's nothing for me to do.

1129
01:37:42,868 --> 01:37:45,663
I want to...
I want to break something.

1130
01:37:45,746 --> 01:37:46,747
Oh, you do?

1131
01:37:48,499 --> 01:37:51,126
Oh, there is something you can break.

1132
01:38:05,015 --> 01:38:08,727
Melina, if this is
the last time that we...

1133
01:38:10,813 --> 01:38:12,565
Ah, damn it.

1134
01:38:25,411 --> 01:38:27,371
That was disgusting.

1135
01:38:40,759 --> 01:38:41,927
Okay.

1136
01:39:03,699 --> 01:39:06,452
So, this was the big plan, huh?

1137
01:39:06,785 --> 01:39:11,665
Melina was going to land the Red Room
and hand me over to the authorities.

1138
01:39:15,044 --> 01:39:16,503
Oh, no, no, no.

1139
01:39:21,258 --> 01:39:25,346
So, what now, you're gonna fold me into
your pathetic little puppeteer act?

1140
01:39:25,512 --> 01:39:26,513
Pathetic, huh?

1141
01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:28,349
Yeah, what would you call it?

1142
01:39:28,515 --> 01:39:29,743
- I would call it...
- When was the last time

1143
01:39:29,767 --> 01:39:31,202
that you had a conversation with somebody

1144
01:39:31,226 --> 01:39:33,062
that wasn't forced to talk to you?

1145
01:39:33,228 --> 01:39:36,190
You ran away to fight in the wrong war.

1146
01:39:36,607 --> 01:39:40,110
The real war was fought here,
in the shadows.

1147
01:39:40,277 --> 01:39:41,862
You didn't fight in the shadows.

1148
01:39:42,029 --> 01:39:43,238
You hid in the dark.

1149
01:39:43,405 --> 01:39:47,201
Real power comes
from undetectable influence.

1150
01:39:47,368 --> 01:39:49,787
If no one's noticed, then why even do it?

1151
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:51,288
You're nothing.

1152
01:39:51,372 --> 01:39:53,582
- Hmm.
- You have nothing.

1153
01:39:54,083 --> 01:39:55,668
There are 50 people on this planet...

1154
01:39:55,834 --> 01:39:57,086
Oh, stop it.

1155
01:39:57,252 --> 01:39:59,880
Don't tell me to stop!

1156
01:40:00,047 --> 01:40:02,967
If I don't tell you when to stop,
then how will you know when to shut up?

1157
01:40:06,929 --> 01:40:08,055
Come on.

1158
01:40:08,222 --> 01:40:10,057
Think I can't take a punch?

1159
01:40:10,140 --> 01:40:11,225
Oh.

1160
01:40:13,060 --> 01:40:16,230
- God damn it, you're weak.
- Weak?

1161
01:40:16,397 --> 01:40:18,708
I bet it's easier to be tough
in front of defenseless little girls, huh?

1162
01:40:18,732 --> 01:40:20,359
That's enough.

1163
01:40:30,452 --> 01:40:32,079
You wouldn't be so glib

1164
01:40:32,246 --> 01:40:35,916
if you had any notion
of the scope of what I've built.

1165
01:40:37,543 --> 01:40:40,129
I own this world. Me.

1166
01:40:40,295 --> 01:40:42,047
You seem desperate to impress me.

1167
01:40:42,214 --> 01:40:43,549
I don't need to impress you.

1168
01:40:43,716 --> 01:40:46,218
I don't need to impress anyone.

1169
01:40:47,428 --> 01:40:50,597
These world leaders, these great men,

1170
01:40:51,432 --> 01:40:54,268
they answer to me and my widows.

1171
01:40:58,022 --> 01:40:59,106
Look at them.

1172
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:03,610
These girls were trash.

1173
01:41:04,737 --> 01:41:06,822
They are thrown out into the street.

1174
01:41:07,281 --> 01:41:10,576
I recycle the trash.

1175
01:41:10,743 --> 01:41:12,619
And I give them purpose.

1176
01:41:14,455 --> 01:41:16,248
I give them a life.

1177
01:41:23,464 --> 01:41:25,716
Melina, I found the location of the vials.

1178
01:41:27,092 --> 01:41:29,094
I've had a slight setback.

1179
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:32,890
You'll need to get to the widows.

1180
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:53,994
It's my network of widows

1181
01:41:54,078 --> 01:41:57,206
that help me control the scales of power.

1182
01:41:57,539 --> 01:42:01,627
One command,
the oil and stock markets crumble.

1183
01:42:01,794 --> 01:42:05,881
One command,
and a quarter of the planet will starve.

1184
01:42:06,048 --> 01:42:09,176
My widows can start and end wars.

1185
01:42:09,426 --> 01:42:12,137
They can make and break kings.

1186
01:42:16,141 --> 01:42:18,685
You control all of that from here?

1187
01:42:19,436 --> 01:42:21,313
And with you,

1188
01:42:21,980 --> 01:42:25,025
an Avenger under my control,

1189
01:42:26,401 --> 01:42:28,862
I can finally come out of the shadows

1190
01:42:29,988 --> 01:42:34,743
using the only natural resource
that the world has too much of.

1191
01:42:36,328 --> 01:42:37,704
Girls.

1192
01:42:48,006 --> 01:42:50,384
All from that little console?

1193
01:42:51,135 --> 01:42:52,344
Yeah.

1194
01:42:56,682 --> 01:42:58,433
Oh, you find this amusing?

1195
01:42:58,725 --> 01:43:00,269
Why are you smiling?

1196
01:43:00,936 --> 01:43:02,980
Don't take it personal, but, uh...

1197
01:43:05,274 --> 01:43:07,359
Thank you for your cooperation.

1198
01:43:07,818 --> 01:43:12,030
Even if you locate the database
and get him to show you the key,

1199
01:43:12,281 --> 01:43:14,741
you won't be able to take it from him.

1200
01:43:14,908 --> 01:43:18,287
For years, Dreykov has implemented
a pheromonal lock

1201
01:43:18,453 --> 01:43:20,289
in all widows, even me.

1202
01:43:20,956 --> 01:43:25,043
So, as long as we can smell him,
then we won't be able to hurt him.

1203
01:43:25,127 --> 01:43:26,837
Well, I'll just hold my breath.

1204
01:43:27,004 --> 01:43:28,463
Not enough.

1205
01:43:28,630 --> 01:43:30,340
This is basic science.

1206
01:43:30,507 --> 01:43:33,760
Natasha, to block receptors
in olfactory center,

1207
01:43:33,927 --> 01:43:35,971
you have to sever the nerve.

1208
01:43:37,806 --> 01:43:39,141
I can handle that.

1209
01:43:40,058 --> 01:43:42,436
You weren't quite strong enough, so...

1210
01:43:43,312 --> 01:43:45,063
I'll have to finish it myself.

1211
01:43:45,147 --> 01:43:47,191
What are you going to do?

1212
01:43:49,151 --> 01:43:50,444
Sever the nerve.

1213
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:12,740
She's got a gun!

1214
01:44:13,842 --> 01:44:15,260
Melina!

1215
01:44:19,806 --> 01:44:21,225
Melina, stop there!

1216
01:44:24,978 --> 01:44:26,313
Drop to the ground!

1217
01:44:26,605 --> 01:44:28,285
Precisely what I was thinking.

1218
01:44:40,869 --> 01:44:42,663
Yelena, slight change of plan.

1219
01:44:42,829 --> 01:44:46,149
I completely demolished one of the engines
and we are going into a controlled crash.

1220
01:44:49,169 --> 01:44:50,170
Fantastic.

1221
01:44:50,337 --> 01:44:51,838
I'm heading to the widows now.

1222
01:44:53,048 --> 01:44:54,341
No.

1223
01:45:31,962 --> 01:45:33,547
We have to go.

1224
01:45:38,885 --> 01:45:41,513
Not so talkative now, are you?

1225
01:45:43,181 --> 01:45:44,266
You took my childhood.

1226
01:45:45,892 --> 01:45:48,437
You took my choices and tried to break me.

1227
01:45:48,603 --> 01:45:50,683
But you're never gonna do that
to anybody ever again.

1228
01:46:02,075 --> 01:46:05,662
Nobody leaves
this room until she's dead.

1229
01:46:05,829 --> 01:46:07,998
Make her suffer.

1230
01:46:10,208 --> 01:46:11,626
I don't wanna hurt you.

1231
01:46:12,210 --> 01:46:13,628
You don't wanna hurt me.

1232
01:48:07,659 --> 01:48:08,869
Hey.

1233
01:48:09,244 --> 01:48:10,564
Are you okay?

1234
01:48:11,538 --> 01:48:12,664
That looks like it hurts.

1235
01:48:12,831 --> 01:48:15,041
Okay. I take out on three, ready?

1236
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:17,210
I'm sorry.

1237
01:48:19,171 --> 01:48:20,651
What do we do now?

1238
01:48:22,799 --> 01:48:25,159
Get as far away
from here as possible.

1239
01:48:25,927 --> 01:48:27,512
You get to make your own choices now.

1240
01:48:38,565 --> 01:48:39,774
We gotta get outta here.

1241
01:48:39,941 --> 01:48:41,085
We need to find Dreykov.
Are you coming?

1242
01:48:41,109 --> 01:48:42,319
I'm right behind you.

1243
01:48:49,034 --> 01:48:52,329
Wait, wait! I have to go back!

1244
01:49:32,619 --> 01:49:33,620
Yes!

1245
01:50:30,885 --> 01:50:32,304
Do you see the girls?

1246
01:50:35,181 --> 01:50:36,182
No!

1247
01:51:09,049 --> 01:51:10,634
We need to go back.

1248
01:51:37,952 --> 01:51:39,579
We've lost control.

1249
01:52:03,687 --> 01:52:05,105
Antonia.

1250
01:52:07,982 --> 01:52:10,110
No!

1251
01:52:11,403 --> 01:52:13,113
I'm gonna open the door.

1252
01:52:13,905 --> 01:52:15,740
You're gonna come after me.

1253
01:52:15,907 --> 01:52:18,118
It's okay. It's okay.

1254
01:52:20,245 --> 01:52:22,414
I know you're still in there.

1255
01:52:24,332 --> 01:52:27,252
And I'm not gonna leave you.
Okay.

1256
01:53:41,659 --> 01:53:42,660
Yelena!

1257
01:53:44,204 --> 01:53:45,705
She's on the wing!

1258
01:53:45,872 --> 01:53:48,249
Move! What are you waiting for?

1259
01:53:49,793 --> 01:53:50,794
Don't do it!

1260
01:53:51,753 --> 01:53:53,421
This was fun!

1261
01:53:53,588 --> 01:53:54,631
No!

1262
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:44,115
Okay.

1263
01:55:45,325 --> 01:55:46,826
Let's go.

1264
01:56:01,633 --> 01:56:02,884
Enough.

1265
01:56:54,268 --> 01:56:55,687
I'm sorry.

1266
01:56:55,853 --> 01:56:57,271
I'm sorry.

1267
01:57:00,483 --> 01:57:02,068
Is he gone?

1268
01:57:06,447 --> 01:57:07,699
He's gone.

1269
01:57:25,508 --> 01:57:26,884
Yelena!

1270
01:57:37,729 --> 01:57:39,022
Yelena?

1271
01:57:45,737 --> 01:57:47,947
We're both upside down.

1272
01:57:56,622 --> 01:58:00,710
Forgive me little sister.

1273
01:58:02,962 --> 01:58:04,398
I should've come back for you.

1274
01:58:04,422 --> 01:58:05,590
You don't have to say that.

1275
01:58:05,673 --> 01:58:06,966
- It's okay.
- Hey. Hey.

1276
01:58:07,508 --> 01:58:09,093
It was real to me, too.

1277
01:58:23,357 --> 01:58:24,358
Thank you.

1278
01:58:39,457 --> 01:58:40,583
Everybody good?

1279
01:58:40,750 --> 01:58:43,169
I am clearly injured.

1280
01:58:44,587 --> 01:58:46,506
You got something to say?

1281
01:58:47,465 --> 01:58:48,883
I'd just mess it up.

1282
01:59:03,231 --> 01:59:05,149
Here comes the cavalry.

1283
01:59:08,152 --> 01:59:10,571
<i>We're closing in on the target, sir.</i>

1284
01:59:13,282 --> 01:59:15,243
So, what's our plan?

1285
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:18,746
You guys go. I'll stay.

1286
01:59:18,913 --> 01:59:20,873
That's insanity. We fight.
We fight with you.

1287
01:59:20,957 --> 01:59:22,893
- I'll hold them off.
- Natasha, we fight.

1288
01:59:22,917 --> 01:59:24,603
We can't split up.
You're so pigheaded.

1289
01:59:24,627 --> 01:59:26,796
- You guys, go.
- Oh, my God.

1290
01:59:26,963 --> 01:59:29,715
Besides, if it can work out
with the four of us, you know,

1291
01:59:29,882 --> 01:59:32,301
there may be some hope for the Avengers.

1292
01:59:32,468 --> 01:59:33,761
Little bit.

1293
01:59:33,928 --> 01:59:37,849
Okay, well, if you're leaving,
then I guess you should take this.

1294
01:59:38,015 --> 01:59:40,560
I know how much you like it.

1295
01:59:40,726 --> 01:59:42,520
Shucks.

1296
01:59:42,603 --> 01:59:43,855
It does have a lot of pockets.

1297
01:59:44,021 --> 01:59:46,023
Very handy pockets, yeah.

1298
01:59:47,150 --> 01:59:49,318
He had widows implanted
all over the world.

1299
01:59:49,485 --> 01:59:51,362
Melina will need to copy the formula,

1300
01:59:51,904 --> 01:59:53,784
but you should be the one
to tell 'em it's over.

1301
02:00:13,551 --> 02:00:15,469
You came back for us.

1302
02:00:15,636 --> 02:00:17,516
We wouldn't leave you behind.

1303
02:00:24,145 --> 02:00:25,605
Thank you.

1304
02:00:30,651 --> 02:00:31,903
Hey.

1305
02:00:32,570 --> 02:00:35,364
Hey. You take care of yourself, okay?

1306
02:00:35,531 --> 02:00:36,657
Don't worry. I got this.

1307
02:00:36,824 --> 02:00:38,284
I know.

1308
02:00:48,669 --> 02:00:51,589
Don't worry.
We're bringing her with us.

1309
02:00:52,298 --> 02:00:54,592
Come. Come with us.

1310
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:30,396
You ever not sleep?

1311
02:02:31,564 --> 02:02:34,942
I've been in six different time zones
in three days because of you.

1312
02:02:35,109 --> 02:02:36,402
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1313
02:02:36,569 --> 02:02:39,030
What, are you scrapping together
some parts?

1314
02:02:39,196 --> 02:02:42,742
What'd you get me this time,
like, an upside-down lawnmower?

1315
02:02:47,913 --> 02:02:50,207
You see what I can get you
with a bit of time and money?

1316
02:02:56,213 --> 02:02:57,840
Go on, say it.
I wanna hear it.

1317
02:02:58,007 --> 02:03:00,634
It would really be good for me
to hear it. Really.

1318
02:03:01,886 --> 02:03:03,054
I'm impressed.

1319
02:03:03,220 --> 02:03:04,889
Well, yeah.

1320
02:03:05,514 --> 02:03:08,142
You've always been
a really good friend to me.

1321
02:03:08,309 --> 02:03:10,811
That's what every man wants to hear.

1322
02:03:11,604 --> 02:03:12,772
Where you gonna go?

1323
02:03:14,106 --> 02:03:16,776
It's funny. My whole life,
I didn't think I had any family.

1324
02:03:16,942 --> 02:03:19,111
Turns out I got two, so...

1325
02:03:19,612 --> 02:03:21,048
One of them's a bit of a mess right now.

1326
02:03:21,072 --> 02:03:23,866
I'm gonna go break
a few of them out of prison

1327
02:03:24,367 --> 02:03:26,869
see if I can't help patch things up.

1328
02:11:14,610 --> 02:11:16,946
Come on, Fanny.

1329
02:12:35,691 --> 02:12:38,194
Wow. Sorry.

1330
02:12:39,278 --> 02:12:41,614
I'm allergic to the Midwest.

1331
02:12:44,116 --> 02:12:46,953
What this woman did,

1332
02:12:47,119 --> 02:12:49,956
honestly, I can't even imagine.

1333
02:12:50,456 --> 02:12:54,210
You're not supposed to be bothering me
on my holiday time, Valentina.

1334
02:12:54,377 --> 02:12:55,878
Oh, bothering you? Oh, no, no.

1335
02:12:55,962 --> 02:12:58,506
I'm just here paying my respects.

1336
02:12:58,589 --> 02:12:59,674
Hmm...

1337
02:13:00,091 --> 02:13:02,385
You know, coming here
makes you look desperate.

1338
02:13:05,721 --> 02:13:06,764
Okay.

1339
02:13:06,931 --> 02:13:08,015
I want a raise.

1340
02:13:08,182 --> 02:13:09,517
Oh, yeah. You and me both.

1341
02:13:09,684 --> 02:13:12,144
Believe me, you're gonna earn it.

1342
02:13:13,312 --> 02:13:15,106
I've got your next target.

1343
02:13:15,173 --> 02:13:16,925
Thought I'd hand-deliver it.

1344
02:13:19,177 --> 02:13:23,974
Maybe you'd like a shot at the man
responsible for your sister's death.

1345
02:13:26,726 --> 02:13:28,687
Kind of a cutie, don't you think?
