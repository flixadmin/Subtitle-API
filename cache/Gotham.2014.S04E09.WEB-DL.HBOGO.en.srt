1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,440
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,720
Taking a life will lead you
down a darker path

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,960
than you can ever imagine.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,520
I know. I've been down it.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,520
I'm not the hero Gotham needs.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,120
And it's gonna be a long,
bumpy journey back.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,520
You've met Martin, I see.

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,720
You and I, we're more than friends.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,440
We're conspirators.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,560
Got him!

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,640
Oh, no.

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,640
You are relieved of duty,
Harvey Bullock.

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,880
As of this moment, I'm assuming
the captaincy of Gotham Central.

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,640
What did you have to do to get it?

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,680
Gotham finds itself in the hands
of a ritualistic cop killer,

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,480
being called Professor Pyg.

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,080
It doesn't stop
until I've butchered every single

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,880
swine on Penguin's payroll.

19
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,240
I'm gonna find you.

20
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,640
I hope you do.

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,200
<i>It's a spectacle.</i>

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,040
And you're my muse, Jimmy Gordon.

23
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,880
My poor lost lambs.

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,240
I come to you today
with an offer for this evening.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,720
Fresh biscuits
and a hearty bowl of soup.

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,840
Wait.

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,840
I have place settings for six.

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,320
Nobody wants some fresh pumpkin pie?

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,120
Smile.

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,240
My children,

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,600
there are two Gothams,

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,920
the Haves and the Have Nots.

33
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,480
I know what it is
to feel like a Have Not.

34
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,600
But...

35
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,520
I say, enough.

36
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,280
Here's to giving the Haves

37
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,720
a taste of what it is like to be...

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,360
...a Have Not.

39
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,080
Let's begin.

40
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,120
Shall we?

41
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,600
{\an5}I'll be out of your way
in just a second, Captain.

42
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
{\an5}Harvey...

43
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,960
...this isn't how I wanted things
to go down.

44
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,040
{\an5}And yet, here we are.

45
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,280
{\an5}You know what I was thinking
about today?

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
{\an5}Our first case.

47
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,400
{\an5}When I told you to walk Penguin
to the end of the pier,

48
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,480
{\an5}put a bullet in his head,

49
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,400
{\an5}and dump him in the water,
and you wouldn't.

50
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,520
{\an5}- You thought it was wrong.
- It was.

51
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,880
{\an5}Well, maybe if you would've done it,

52
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,760
{\an5}Falcone would still be
running things,

53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,360
{\an5}and a lot of people who are dead
would be alive today.

54
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,440
{\an5}If I could go back...

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,040
...I'd do the same thing.

56
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,920
{\an5}Because you still don't understand
how this city works, Jim.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,520
{\an5}You want to be a hero,

58
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,120
{\an5}and Gotham doesn't need heroes.

59
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,120
{\an5}It needs people
who will do what is necessary.

60
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,520
{\an5}You're wrong.

61
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,200
{\an5}If you show 'em the way,
the people will follow.

62
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,160
{\an5}Guess we'll just have to wait
and see, huh?

63
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,840
When your leave is up,

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,360
{\an5}there will be a desk here waiting
for you.

65
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,720
{\an5}Sit around and watch you all day?

66
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
{\an5}No, thanks.

67
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,480
Right there is perfect. Thank you.

68
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,280
Beautiful.

69
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,800
{\an5}I predict this evening's fundraiser
will be a smashing success.

70
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,480
If I want Gotham's wealthiest
families

71
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,200
{\an5}to support the orphanage,
things have to be perfect.

72
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,920
{\an5}I appreciate you taking part,
Oswald.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
{\an5}Yes.

74
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,560
{\an5}- Sadly, a situation has arisen.
- No.

75
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,600
{\an5}That thing in the Narrows,
with your former chief of staff?

76
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,160
{\an5}No, no. This is far more serious.

77
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,360
It has to do with Mayor Burke
promoting James Gordon

78
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,360
to captain of the G.C.P.D.

79
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
You're not really worried
about James Gordon?

80
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
Please.

81
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,080
The issue is the person
who ordered his appointment.

82
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,240
- I see.
- Do you?

83
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,320
Oswald, we both know the mayor
is a weasel.

84
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,680
Someone must have paid him off.

85
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,080
But I don't see why that means
you can't attend my dinner.

86
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,280
Because, my dear,
the mayor has vanished.

87
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,480
But I will find him,

88
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,720
I will learn the name of my enemy,

89
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,440
and there will be a reckoning.

90
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,400
And that is why I might not be able
to make it this evening.

91
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,360
Very well.

92
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,520
But a few of the children
are doing a song.

93
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,760
Martin is taking part.

94
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,960
It would mean the world to him
if you could come.

95
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
Of course.

96
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,720
Now, don't let me keep you.

97
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,880
If you think she's the one,
we could have Victor...

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
...talk to her?

99
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,680
You do realize she is,
literally my only friend.

100
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,080
I need the mayor. I need proof.

101
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,040
But, sir, what if Ms. Falcone,
not to say it is her,

102
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,640
has seen to it that the mayor
is missing, well, permanently?

103
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,640
I could be chasing a ghost
while she prepares her next move.

104
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,360
I wish I had a spy,

105
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,880
close to her, someone quiet.

106
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,440
Bring me Martin.

107
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
Who?

108
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,040
The boy with the pad around his neck.

109
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,760
The one who can't talk.

110
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,200
I thought I was clear. We're done.

111
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,120
<i>Penguin suspects something.</i>

112
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,800
- What are you talking about?
- He was just here,

113
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,040
saying that he couldn't come
to the party

114
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,880
I'm having tonight for the orphanage.

115
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,520
He knows someone paid the mayor
to make you captain.

116
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,840
<i>I think he suspects me.</i>

117
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,240
- Have you warned the mayor?
<i>- I'm not a fool, Jim.</i>

118
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,360
I had him leave town
after your appointment.

119
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,120
Sounds like you have
your bases covered, as usual.

120
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,560
Thanks for the heads-up
about Penguin.

121
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
Don't call me again.

122
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
This is Harper.

123
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,760
Gordon, line one. Says it's private.

124
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,160
- Sofia.
<i>- Wrong. Try again.</i>

125
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,600
- You son of a bitch.
- Yeah, attaboy, Jim.

126
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,280
Or should I say Captain?

127
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,440
<i>Congratulations, by the way.</i>

128
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,560
<i>So, do you remember when you said</i>

129
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,320
the rot in Gotham went
from high to low?

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,240
<i>You've hit the nail on the head.</i>

131
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,360
Police were low.

132
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,240
Now it's time for Gotham's elite
to feel the pain.

133
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,080
Enter Phase Two.

134
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,800
I won't spoil the reveal.

135
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,960
Hurry outside for a little taste
of what's to come.

136
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,760
<i>Ciao, mon ami.</i>

137
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,240
He's outside. Let's go.

138
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
G.C.P.D.

139
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,080
G.C.P.D.! Make way.

140
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,760
- G.C.P.D. Excuse me.
- Back up.

141
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,720
- Are they dead?
- Get forensics here.

142
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,640
And I want this whole area
closed off. No press.

143
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,800
That pig's eating that guy.

144
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,120
Now, Harper.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Excuse me.

146
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
Where's breakfast?

147
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,000
Breakfast was produced and consumed
by yours truly at breakfast time.

148
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,160
It is now fast approaching
luncheon, Master Bruce.

149
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,720
Whatever, just give me a coffee.

150
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,560
Enjoying the benefits

151
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,680
of another night out
on the tiles with Tommy Elliot

152
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,480
and his band of miscreants, are we?

153
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,160
How absolutely delightful.

154
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,320
I know what you're going through,
you know, Master Bruce.

155
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,440
Yeah.

156
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,880
I went out with my friends.
I'm hungover.

157
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,280
Doesn't take a genius
to figure it out.

158
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,640
You're lost is what you are.

159
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,720
I've seen that countless times.

160
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,560
Young men, going off to war
with a clear purpose,

161
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,640
only to return home to a normal life,
unable to assimilate.

162
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,080
Confused, angry.

163
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,120
And they make a complete tosh of it.

164
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,760
I don't really care.

165
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,640
You killed Ra's al Ghul.

166
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,480
Vengeance for your parents' death

167
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,760
has been your driving force
for so long.

168
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,760
You are completely lost without it.

169
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,840
I need to call Tommy.

170
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,240
Have you forgotten
what day it is today?

171
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,600
- Give me my phone.
- You have, ain't you?

172
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,600
Today is the day
my father took me camping

173
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,440
and we put a rock
on top of Mount Bristol.

174
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,480
We did it every year.
Now give me my phone.

175
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,640
You are Bruce Wayne,
son of Thomas Wayne.

176
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,800
And the sooner you start
remembering that, the better.

177
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,920
So, you drink your coffee.

178
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,840
You go upstairs, you put your kit on,
'cause you and I...

179
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
...are going for a walk.

180
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,520
According to the medical examiner,

181
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,400
both victims had been
living outdoors for some time.

182
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,960
Most likely homeless.

183
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,320
Now, see these incisions?

184
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,200
He removed their organs.

185
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,800
- Any idea why?
- Not yet.

186
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,840
Pyg all but announced
that his next victims

187
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,760
would be the rich and powerful,
the high in Gotham.

188
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,920
So why is he killing the homeless?

189
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,200
You're asking for logic
from a psychopath.

190
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,800
From him, yeah. Everything he's done
has been thought through carefully.

191
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,280
There was a card on the table
in French,

192
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,320
said, <i>"Long Live the Revolution."</i>

193
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,680
Maybe he's using them
to make a statement.

194
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,920
- He wants the city's attention.
- For what?

195
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,080
He said this was just a taste
of what's to come.

196
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,080
There's a piece that's still missing.

197
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,720
The homeless are densest
in the Narrows.

198
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,080
I'm gonna start there.

199
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,120
Hell of a first day to be captain.

200
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,360
Yeah.

201
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,800
Call me, you find anything else.

202
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,880
We checked all buildings
in a three-block radius, Captain.

203
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,040
Nothing.

204
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,160
All right, widen it out
a couple of blocks.

205
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,320
Focus on buildings
with protected loading docks.

206
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,320
Captain, that was Lucius Fox.

207
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,640
Final tox came back.
Both victims had sodium sulfide

208
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,280
and chlorine residue on their skin.

209
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,280
He says it's common
in paper manufacturing.

210
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,000
There's an old paper plant
few blocks from here

211
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,240
that closed down a while back.
Let's check that out.

212
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,720
Backup's still incoming.
Should we wait?

213
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
No.

214
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,680
Over here.

215
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,680
What is he doing to them?

216
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,720
Taking their organs.

217
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
A smoker oven?

218
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
He's cooking them.

219
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
Harper?

220
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,640
Drop the gun, Captain.

221
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,600
- Shoot this bastard.
- Drop it!

222
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,520
Thank you.

223
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,440
You found me too soon, James.

224
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,560
The table's not yet set,

225
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,960
and no meal should be served
before its time.

226
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,120
You want a hostage, take me.

227
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,320
No, no, no, no, no.
That won't do at all.

228
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,920
You must see my final act.

229
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,280
Along with all of Gotham.

230
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,560
Right, well,
it's a lovely day for it.

231
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,560
Best foot forward.

232
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,600
Very distinguished.

233
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,600
Sofia tells me you're taking part
in a performance this evening.

234
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,760
She's quite a lady, isn't she?

235
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,000
She's been a friend to both of us.

236
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
Or has she?

237
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,480
Martin, I worry Sofia
is only pretending to be my friend.

238
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
And worse,

239
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,800
I fear she may be using you.

240
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,880
Now, I've been running this over
in my mind,

241
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,480
and there are two ways
this might have gone.

242
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,960
One, Sofia chose a specific orphan
you to place in my path.

243
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
She groomed you.

244
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,800
She told you how to act.

245
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
Or...

246
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,080
...Sofia simply collected
a group of children,

247
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,760
hoping one would gain my trust...

248
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,560
and make me easier to manipulate.

249
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,560
In this version, you are innocent.

250
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
Martin...

251
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,480
...this is the version
I very badly want to believe.

252
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
But I need proof.

253
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,120
Of our friendship.

254
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,400
I need to know
if my suspicions are correct.

255
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,520
And if so, what Sofia is planning
and who she is planning it with.

256
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,480
I need you to be my eyes and my ears.

257
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,480
Do you think you can do that?

258
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,200
Don't let me down, Martin.

259
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,120
Please.

260
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,760
I want a city-wide BOLO on that van.

261
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,000
I want every cop in Gotham
on the streets, looking for Harper.

262
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,840
She will not be the Pyg's
next victim.

263
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
Go.

264
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,120
- Captain Gordon!
- Captain Gordon!

265
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,880
Captain Gordon! Captain Gordon!
Captain Gordon!

266
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,920
Is it true that the serial killer
known as the Pyg is back?

267
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,160
That he's responsible for the scene
outside the G.C.P.D. this morning?

268
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,120
We believe so, yes.

269
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,000
We've also heard he's kidnapped
a G.C.P.D. detective.

270
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,680
How can you keep
the people of Gotham safe

271
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,600
when you can't protect
your own officers?

272
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,720
We remain hopeful
for Detective Harper's safe return.

273
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,640
Let me be clear.

274
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,360
The G.C.P.D. will stop this monster;
that's a promise.

275
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,400
And if you fail, will you be
pushed aside like Harvey Bullock was?

276
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
We're done here. Thank you.

277
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,720
What about the rumor that
the Pyg is now cooking his victims?

278
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,080
Who told you that?

279
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,720
Is it true?

280
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,440
As I said, the G.C.P.D.
will bring the Pyg to justice.

281
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
That's all.

282
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,280
Captain Gordon!

283
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,400
Someone leaked to the press
that the Pyg is cooking his victims.

284
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,240
Maybe it was the Pyg.

285
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,720
We know he wants attention.

286
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,360
Look, Jim...

287
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,160
...everyone in the department
is on your side.

288
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,720
Yeah.

289
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,160
There's something you need to see.

290
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,560
<i>"I grant this food
will be somewhat dear,</i>

291
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,840
<i>and therefore very proper
for landlords, who,</i>

292
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,680
<i>as they have already devoured
most of the parents,</i>

293
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,280
<i>seem to have the best title
to the children."</i>

294
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,760
It's Jonathan Swift,
"A Modest Proposal."

295
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,360
He made an argument for cannibalism,
about the rich eating the poor.

296
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,680
The poor are the homeless.

297
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,560
Who are the rich?

298
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,200
Swift didn't just talk about
the rich eating the poor.

299
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,160
He specifically mentioned
the orphans.

300
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,360
I know where he's going.

301
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,280
He left this for me.

302
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,760
He's doing exactly what he did
with Harvey. It could be a trap.

303
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,320
And I won't lead more officers
to their deaths.

304
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,120
- You're going alone?
- I'm sorry, Lucius.

305
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,240
Where's Chef Louis?

306
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,960
<i>Ici, mademoiselle.</i>

307
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,680
Such a pleasure to meet you
in person.

308
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,680
I was expecting you earlier.

309
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,040
Apologies, I was detained.

310
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,200
But I've made a small change
in the menu.

311
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,880
I have steered us away
from haute cuisine

312
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,400
to something a bit more, mundane.

313
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
<i>Et voilà.</i>

314
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,720
I am calling them Gotham Meat Pies.

315
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,360
Your guests will die for them.

316
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,560
I've made us a delicious
brown English stew

317
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,280
with herb dumplings, Master Bruce.

318
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,920
Your father used to love it
when I made stew.

319
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,120
Did I ever tell you
how I met your old man?

320
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,600
In London.

321
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,640
He was doing postgrad work there.
He told me.

322
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,040
Yeah, but no details.

323
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,560
Well, I was just out the army,
two months.

324
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,960
Don't remember any of it.

325
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,640
All a bit of a blur, really,
booze, drugs, brawling.

326
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,800
A sucking great black cloud.

327
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,080
One day, I wake up
and I'm lying in this alley,

328
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,560
and I'm covered in blood,
don't know how.

329
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,880
So I picked myself up,

330
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,280
I took myself straight down to the
police station, turned myself in,

331
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,320
hoping that they would chuck me
into the big house

332
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,320
and throw away the key.

333
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,880
And they told me to shut up,
sit down and wait.

334
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,240
And there was this really annoying
Yank wandering about,

335
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,880
dressed like he was ready
for a game of tennis,

336
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,960
and it was your dad.

337
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,600
Anyway, he bowls up to me,
asks me what I done.

338
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,840
Asking me questions.

339
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,680
Eventually, you know,
I found myself telling him

340
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,800
stuff that I was too frightened
even to think about.

341
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,160
But I guess it'd just been building.

342
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,520
Anyway, that point,
the desk sergeant called him over,

343
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,680
and your dad turned around to me
and he said,

344
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,760
"Alfred, last night,
I was being attacked in that alley,

345
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,320
and you started fighting this geezer.

346
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,840
I headed on my toes, and I ran away."

347
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,080
And I said, "Yeah, but that's not
what happened, is it, Thomas?"

348
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,280
And he says, "It is now."

349
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,560
Your father saved my life.

350
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,520
His friendship saved me.

351
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,240
You see, I know
what it's all like, being lonely.

352
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,560
Hoping that the world
will punish you.

353
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,960
I can help you.

354
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,320
- Bruce...
- Alfred, I hear you.

355
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,680
I just don't want to talk
about this right now.

356
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,720
All right.

357
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,200
Well, this looks lovely.

358
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,960
The rocks are gone.
They must've fell out in the car.

359
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,560
Oh, the keys are in the bag,
just there.

360
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,160
- You look beautiful. Very nice.
- So nice to see you, dear.

361
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,240
Yes.

362
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,720
Oswald, you came!

363
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,960
Look at you two.

364
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,160
So handsome.

365
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,640
I know how important
tonight's party is to you.

366
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,120
And I wouldn't have forgiven myself
if I missed Martin's performance.

367
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,480
Why don't you go find
the other children.

368
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,200
Did you locate the mayor?

369
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,680
Unfortunately, no.

370
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,800
But I have not given up hope.

371
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,440
Well, I, for one, am happy.

372
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,920
This way, you get to come
to my dinner.

373
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,520
I need to go check on the chef.
He seems a bit odd.

374
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,920
Please try and enjoy yourself.

375
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,960
Let's go.
Straight ahead, down to the left.

376
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,800
Hello, Martin.

377
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,240
What are you writing?

378
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,960
Don't make a noise.

379
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,200
I'm a cop. Who are you?

380
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
A waiter.

381
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,880
I'm looking for a man,
Caucasian, about 5'10".

382
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,680
He would've brought the food.
Maybe the chef.

383
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,200
The chef's in the kitchen.

384
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,760
Look, I just got hired tonight.

385
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,400
Whatever the dude's into,
I have no idea. I'm just here...

386
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,920
You're okay, you're okay.

387
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,080
Do me a favor,
find Ms. Falcone, bring her to me.

388
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,560
- Can you do that for me?
- Yeah. All right.

389
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
What's that in your jacket?

390
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,200
Jim Gordon really
is an impressive policeman.

391
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,760
- Is he alone?
- Seems so.

392
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,400
But, man, whatever it is you're into,
my partner and I?

393
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,680
Our rates just doubled.

394
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
Harper.

395
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,080
My friends, the Falcone orphanage

396
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,280
is the realization
of a long cherished dream,

397
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,560
and one that would not have been
possible without your support.

398
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,840
- So thank you. Cheers.
- Cheers.

399
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,560
Now, if you could please
take your seats in the next room,

400
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,160
a few of the children
have prepared a song.

401
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,040
Where's Martin?

402
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,440
I wanted to wish him luck.

403
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,600
Off getting ready, no doubt.

404
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,480
Oswald, I've been thinking.

405
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,040
Maybe things happen for a reason.

406
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,760
Licensing crime was a bold move,
but it would've destroyed you.

407
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,360
Whoever had Jim Gordon
appointed captain

408
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,720
may actually have saved you.

409
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,480
By attempting to destroy everything
I ever created?

410
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,880
- Oswald...
- Enough.

411
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,200
If you're going to confess, confess.

412
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,840
And face the consequences.

413
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,040
So sorry to interrupt.

414
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,120
The servers are getting everyone
seated.

415
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,840
We don't want the food to get cold.

416
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,880
Shall we go in to dinner?

417
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,240
Chop, chop.

418
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,920
All right.

419
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,480
I stopped the bleeding, I think.

420
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,920
That's the best I can do
until I can get you out of here.

421
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,760
Got to get that door open.

422
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,880
- Gordon.
- Maybe I can get the hinges off.

423
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
Gordon.

424
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,480
Idiots forgot to search me.

425
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,280
- Was this another one of your plans?
- No.

426
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,120
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you by now have surmised,

427
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,280
there's been a change in the program.

428
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,840
Tonight, we are proud to present

429
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,840
the six merry Gothamites
of Squatter's Row,

430
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,480
and Martin, from the Falcone Home
and School for Orphans,

431
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,680
in our rendition of...

432
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,440
...the "Meat Pie Tango."

433
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,320
<i>Bob</i>

434
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,920
<i>Fricks</i>

435
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,080
<i>Trish</i>

436
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,200
<i>Nunuh</i>

437
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,280
<i>Cyrano</i>

438
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,280
<i>Vincent</i>

439
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,080
<i>You have it coming,
You have it coming</i>

440
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,800
<i>You only have yourself to blame</i>

441
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,680
<i>If you'd have been fair,
If you'd have been keen</i>

442
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,960
<i>I betcha these pies
Wouldn't taste the same</i>

443
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,040
Enough! Where are the other children?

444
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,760
If you hurt them, I swear...

445
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,120
Rude.

446
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,360
I'm not finished.

447
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,440
Sit down.

448
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,840
Pull it out,
and the next one's in her eye.

449
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,920
Oswald, no.

450
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,520
Now, to answer your question,
my dear,

451
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,280
the other children and your staff
are safely locked in the kitchen.

452
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,800
Despite appearances,
I'm not an animal.

453
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,440
Martin.

454
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,120
May we continue?

455
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,760
You have all fed upon
the poor of Gotham for years.

456
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,120
Now you're going to know
what they taste like.

457
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,680
Please, open your envelopes
and look at the photographs inside.

458
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,360
Oh, come on.

459
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,160
Open them!

460
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,560
Who is Trish?

461
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,560
Well, I thought you should see
who you're eating.

462
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,920
Bob, Fricks,

463
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,600
Trish, Nunuh, Cyrano and Vincent

464
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,240
all deserve our gratitude.

465
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,200
So these pies are...

466
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,600
People. Yep.

467
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,880
They're people pies.

468
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,960
People.

469
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,200
And you're all going to eat them.

470
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,280
Oh, no.

471
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,160
Absolutely not.

472
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,960
Okay.

473
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,160
Let's try this again.

474
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,680
No!

475
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,920
Eat or I'll kill the boy.

476
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,640
But he's just an orphan.

477
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,080
What did you say?

478
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,640
Well, these are made of people.

479
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,000
For God's sake,
you can't expect us...

480
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,000
I mean, so they kill some urchin,
hmm?

481
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,440
What a waste of a good pie.

482
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,240
But I do applaud the sentiment.

483
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,680
Especially as you, Mr. Cobblepot,
are the reason I'm here.

484
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,480
Me? Why?

485
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,920
Oh, I could've chosen
any gathering of wealthy Gothamites

486
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,360
who've gotten fat upon the poor.

487
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,320
But you, with your Pax Penguina,

488
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,800
you are the biggest glutton
of them all.

489
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,440
You have gorged yourself
on this city's heart,

490
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,560
its lungs, its liver.

491
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,880
Why should today be any different?

492
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,520
Now eat, little Penguin. Eat.

493
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,720
Eat the pies, or the boy dies.

494
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,840
If you don't eat,

495
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,440
I will hunt you down
and kill you all!

496
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,040
Now, that's what I like to see.

497
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,160
And as Mother always used to say,

498
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,800
"Nobody leaves
until every plate is clean."

499
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,920
It's a compliment to the chef,
and I love compliments.

500
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,360
And, Ms. Falcone...

501
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,600
<i>...mangia, signorina.</i>

502
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,400
Only if you don't hurt him.

503
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,280
Can you help me?

504
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,520
Yes.

505
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,400
No!

506
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,840
He'll kill the kid!

507
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,920
Get off of me!

508
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,840
Martin!

509
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,680
Jim!

510
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,960
Get out of here!

511
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,800
Go!

512
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,800
Come on, Jim.

513
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,760
Don't give up.
You'll ruin everything.

514
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Should be good.

515
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,640
How is your hand?

516
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,320
I'll be fine.

517
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,400
How's Martin?

518
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,360
He is stronger than he looks.

519
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,600
You paid off the mayor
to make Jim Gordon captain.

520
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,080
Yes.

521
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,320
And you want me to believe
that you did this out of friendship.

522
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,520
To save me.

523
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,600
I tried to talk you
out of the license program.

524
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,680
You wouldn't listen.

525
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,600
There seemed no other way.

526
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,480
Of course, it's equally plausible
that you are my enemy,

527
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,560
intent upon my destruction.

528
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,040
You could choose to see it that way.

529
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,440
Choice is yours, Oswald.

530
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,520
Well...

531
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
...whatever your actual reasoning...

532
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,480
...you went behind my back.

533
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,480
I would be justified in killing you.

534
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,760
But what you were
going to do for Martin...

535
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,320
...that was real.

536
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,880
Don't ever betray me again.

537
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
Never.

538
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,600
I will abandon the licenses,

539
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,240
but Jim Gordon cannot be captain.

540
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Pick someone else, then.

541
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,280
Gordon's less than nothing to me.

542
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,440
Bye-bye, Piggy, bye-bye.

543
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,320
- Captain Gordon! Captain Gordon!
- Captain Gordon! Captain Gordon!

544
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,240
Captain Gordon? Captain Gordon?

545
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,320
Captain Gordon?

546
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,320
Is that the Pyg?
Did you really catch him?

547
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,960
The suspect known
as the Pyg is in custody.

548
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,040
Detective Vanessa Harper
is on her way to Gotham General,

549
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,800
and is expected
to make a full recovery.

550
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,040
The G.C.P.D. kept its promise.

551
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,840
- Captain Gordon?
- Yes?

552
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,120
Thank you.

553
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,960
Thank you.

554
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,440
Hey, hey, Alfred!

555
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,960
How was your walk?

556
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Everybody out now.

557
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,160
Nobody move.

558
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,040
This is not your house.

559
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,840
If I want my friends to stay,
they're staying.

560
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,840
Like hell they are.

561
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,520
Dude, your butler
is a little out of line.

562
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,800
Have you been hitting
the sherry, Jeeves?

563
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,120
You have no idea what extreme danger
you are now in, son.

564
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,680
If I was you, I would walk away.

565
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,680
Yeah, whatever.

566
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,400
Meet us at the club.

567
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,920
Come on. Driver will take us.

568
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,920
It's fine we'll just meet him there.

569
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,840
Well...

570
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,640
...you've certainly shown
a new side of yourself today,

571
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,280
- haven't you, Master Bruce?
- Save it, Alfred.

572
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,040
You tell me a story
about you and my dad,

573
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,520
and I'm supposed to get all weepy?

574
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,600
You don't know
what I'm going through.

575
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,560
You and I are nothing alike.

576
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,440
Then talk to me.

577
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,560
Let me know how I can help you.

578
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,640
You can't.

579
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,280
Like you said, I did what I did.

580
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,440
I killed Ra's.

581
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,040
I avenged my parents' death,
and guess what.

582
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,800
Nothing changed.

583
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,280
It made no difference.

584
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,560
So then what did I do it for?

585
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,320
How can you help that?

586
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,560
I can help with the way
that you're feeling.

587
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,320
But you need to talk to me.

588
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,760
You have to face up
to who you really are.

589
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,000
Stop telling me who I am.

590
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,720
I know who I am.

591
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,280
And if you really want to help me,

592
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,360
you can stop trying to be my father,
and you can be my butler.

593
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,080
Clean this place up.

594
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,400
Tommy!

595
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,320
You're the hero of the day.

596
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,720
I was just doing my job.

597
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,720
I know you hate me for what I did,
but you deserve to be captain.

598
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,320
I went to your father for help.

599
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,560
I knew what I was getting into.

600
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,960
Doesn't mean I have to like it.

601
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,760
But you accept it.

602
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,000
Because I do deserve it.

603
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,840
Just like Gotham deserves law
and order.

604
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,680
And I'm gonna make sure it gets it.

605
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,600
You don't think I want that, too?

606
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,120
I'm not your enemy, Jim.

607
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,520
I never will be.

608
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,160
Did you find anything out?

609
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,160
<i>"I saw Sofia kissing the policeman."</i>

610
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,360
Is this true?

611
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,240
Martin, you are a good friend.

612
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
As for Sofia...

613
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,800
...she will answer
for what she's done.

614
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,280
I swear it.
