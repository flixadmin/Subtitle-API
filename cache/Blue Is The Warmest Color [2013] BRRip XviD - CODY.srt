1
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,351
<i>"Will I always digress?
I think so.</i>

2
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,770
<i>"Impossible not to.</i>

3
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:47,774
"Ideas take hold of me.
I am a woman. I tell my story.

4
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,650
"Consider my words.

5
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,821
"See how little I misuse
the privileges this gives me."

6
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:58,367
Start over from "I am a woman."
But first say it to yourself.

7
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,370
"I am a woman" is a truth.

8
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,039
Understand, Saïda?

9
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,167
Start from there.
You tell your story.

10
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:07,877
It's a truth.

11
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,589
"I am a woman.
And I tell my story.

12
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,217
"Among the young men I attracted

13
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,177
"was one I myself noticed.

14
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:19,180
"My gaze fell upon him
in particular.

15
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,099
"I didn't realize
the pleasure I procured.

16
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,811
"I flirted with others,
not with him.

17
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,313
"I wanted to watch him,
not please him."

18
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,482
Thank you, Saïda. Maëlisse?

19
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:30,858
"It seems

20
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:33,444
"first love begins
with this sincerity.

21
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:37,615
"Perhaps its sweetness
curtails the desire to please.

22
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,617
"In turn, he observed me

23
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:42,245
"differently from other young men.

24
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,873
"More reservedly,
yet more thoughtfully.

25
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,544
"There was something more serious
between him and me.

26
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,672
"Others welcomed my charms.

27
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,300
"I felt at times
he was not indifferent to them,

28
00:02:56,927 --> 00:03:00,555
"but so confusedly,
I could not say what I thought of him

29
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,526
"nor of myself."

30
00:03:02,565 --> 00:03:06,435
"We left the church.
I remember walking slowly.

31
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,104
"I reduced my pace.

32
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,648
"I was sorry
to be leaving that place.

33
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:16,153
"My heart was missing something,
but it did not know what it was.

34
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:19,323
"I say it did not know.
Perhaps it did,

35
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:25,288
"for as I left, I often turned around
to see the young man I left behind

36
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,874
"without knowing
I did so for him."

37
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,458
What does it mean

38
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,295
that her heart
was missing something?

39
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:43,472
When you exchange glances,
when you cross paths

40
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,851
and you both exchange glances
spontaneously,

41
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,687
like with love at first sight,

42
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:54,358
is there something
less or more in your heart?

43
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,068
Eli...

44
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,486
Regret?

45
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,991
Regret about not speaking
to the person.

46
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,743
For you it's regret?

47
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,788
So regret is something less
in your heart.

48
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:11,292
Regret about not filling
the emptiness in your heart.

49
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,668
Thank you, Eli.

50
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:18,257
Let's stay on this passage
and compare it

51
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,177
to The Princess of Clèves.

52
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:25,900
Particularly when she first meets
the Duc de Nemours.

53
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:28,684
Furthermore, I want you to think

54
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,855
about the idea of predestination
in their encounters, okay?

55
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,860
Which happens, for example,
with love at first sight.

56
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,780
Honestly,
if I can get laid, I will.

57
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,032
But I won't wait three months.

58
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,242
Four days is all it takes.

59
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,621
Who needs to wait
three months to get laid?

60
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,873
He seems a little wishy-washy.

61
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,333
A little?

62
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,377
He just sat there for an hour!

63
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,295
Just a second.

64
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,381
Thomas keeps looking at you.

65
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,548
Behind me?

66
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,425
Look. He can't see.

67
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,678
He keeps staring.

68
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,097
Yeah, and it's not the first time.

69
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,100
He's totally into you.

70
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,853
- Never noticed?
- Come on!

71
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,648
Give me a break.
I've seen him do it.

72
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,484
It could be any of us.

73
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:24,073
He's sneaking a peak.
You can look.

74
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,449
I don't believe you.

75
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,576
- I'm sure you can.
- Can what?

76
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,037
What do you think? Play cards?

77
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,041
It's obvious
you're both into each other.

78
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:36,627
He's cool.
It's totally possible.

79
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,925
Seriously, he's hung up on you.

80
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,636
You think you like him?

81
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:48,514
Sure, physically.

82
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,725
Yeah, he's cute.

83
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,393
More than just "yeah".

84
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,937
He's cute,
but he's not Brad Pitt.

85
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,523
Pretty close!

86
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,774
Honestly, he is.

87
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,901
Our choices at school suck.

88
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,653
Yeah, and then?

89
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,406
So he called and I told him off.

90
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,450
He's gone.

91
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,785
I swear, it is so in the bag!

92
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,376
Stop turning around, Amélie.

93
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,880
She is so heavy-handed.

94
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,798
I checked out his friend.

95
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,425
He's not bad either.

96
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,676
Hugo?

97
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,428
He is totally cute.

98
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,805
No more Vincent. It's Hugo now.

99
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,807
Vincent's with his sister.

100
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,476
He's so hot.

101
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,416
Can I have some more?

102
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,513
It's so good.

103
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,640
Some more?

104
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,281
Thank you.

105
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,071
Thank you.

106
00:08:33,172 --> 00:08:34,203
Thank you.

107
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,484
What's up? Can I sit here?

108
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,694
If you want to.

109
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,326
This weather sucks.

110
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,036
It's crazy.

111
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,627
What's the book?

112
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,629
Marivaux's Life of Marianne.

113
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,548
We have to do
a presentation on it.

114
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,468
- Interesting?
- It's amazing.

115
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,139
- You're a junior?
- Yeah, and you?

116
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,141
Senior. In science.

117
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:21,977
Like it?

118
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,521
It's not that I like it.

119
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,357
I'm just good in math.

120
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,984
And after high school?

121
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,487
I'd like to work in music.

122
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,614
Start a record label.

123
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,617
Discover artists,
start a production company.

124
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,744
And do you...

125
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,373
- You play, or just want to produce?
- I play too.

126
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,499
What?

127
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,084
I play percussion...

128
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,002
guitar, piano.

129
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,963
I'm not a pro, but...

130
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,174
Where did you learn?

131
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,969
On my own. With videos.

132
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,137
By listening.

133
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:03,098
- You play anything?
- No.

134
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:06,897
I'd like to, but I'd have
to start with music class.

135
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,190
It's not for me.

136
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,692
It's awful.

137
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,736
My mom made me go. I hated it.

138
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,947
Turned me off for 10 years.

139
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,703
What do you listen to?

140
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,371
Everything.

141
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,207
I can get into reggae, gypsy music,

142
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,793
classical, dubstep.

143
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,503
Everything.

144
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,424
Only thing I really can't stand
is metal and hard rock.

145
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,843
People with long hair
who scream.

146
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,554
No words, no melody...
not my thing.

147
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,682
It's annoying.
But everything else.

148
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,142
Oh, fuck.

149
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,018
Why?

150
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,060
Because...

151
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,564
my big thing is hard rock.

152
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,401
I mean it. It's no joke.

153
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,237
I'm into the hard stuff.

154
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,489
Hard rock, hard metal.

155
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,494
You said it's lots of screaming.

156
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,830
You may not like my stuff.

157
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,460
I associate it with guys
with long hair who scream.

158
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,461
So I pass.

159
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,713
Maybe your stuff is different.

160
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,465
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,260
- I was kidding.
- You don't play it?

162
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,889
I was trying to fix things.

163
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,099
I couldn't.
I kept blabbering on.

164
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:27,061
You really think
they all have long hair?

165
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,187
Almost.

166
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,731
I don't play it, but it's not true.

167
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,441
But you don't play it?

168
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,944
I'll play you my stuff.

169
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,072
Yeah, cool. I'd like that.

170
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,243
That way we have
to get together again.

171
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,134
Sorry.

172
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,652
You okay?

173
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,070
Fine, and you?

174
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,825
- Sorry, I got held up.
- No problem.

175
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,327
The train was late.

176
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,412
Been waiting long?

177
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:52,831
What now?

178
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:56,418
You want to eat something?
A waffle, a crêpe.

179
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,420
We can sit outside.

180
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,131
But a gyro instead.

181
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,232
You got me slaving away
this weekend.

182
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,399
Why?

183
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,443
Life of Marianne.

184
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,862
- You read it?
- I tried. I started.

185
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:24,863
And?

186
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,282
It's pretty tough. Slow-going.

187
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,451
You mean you don't like it?

188
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,286
Thick books like that...

189
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,553
they put me off.

190
00:14:33,577 --> 00:14:37,167
I put down some short books
after two pages.

191
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,170
But how can anyone not like it?

192
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:41,630
I didn't say that.

193
00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:44,497
It's all that...

194
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,929
that vocabulary,
the long sentences, the old stuff.

195
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,932
There's lots of description.

196
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,185
He explores sentiments
but gets under her skin.

197
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,938
Who knows?
Maybe you'll make me like it.

198
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,690
I'll try to read it all.

199
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,025
Ever read a book you liked?

200
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,278
Have you read a book you liked?

201
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,862
I never read a book!

202
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,657
You never finished
a book you liked?

203
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,285
Never?

204
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,870
There was one book I got into.

205
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,248
But I didn't read it alone.

206
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,874
What was it?

207
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,127
Dangerous Liaisons.

208
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,921
Choderlos de Laclos.

209
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,507
You learned that by heart.

210
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:28,468
Alone, I'd have missed out.

211
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,848
Maybe you'd have found
your own reasons for liking it.

212
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:37,185
He explained each chapter,
each letter, analysed stuff.

213
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,354
It's a bunch of letters.

214
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:43,025
You don't find it a pain,
a teacher explaining it all?

215
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,645
It made it come to life.

216
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:49,072
I got into the double-dealing.
At one point he writes

217
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,575
to the "Marquise de Merqueuil".

218
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:56,538
He says he loves her,
but he's writing on a whore's back.

219
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,874
When you read every other line,

220
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,752
it's another letter,
but she doesn't know.

221
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,920
I'd never have gotten that.

222
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,382
That stuff goes over my head.

223
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,843
But in the end I got really into it.

224
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:11,970
I'm the opposite.

225
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,926
- You read a lot?
- I love to.

226
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,144
When a teacher makes me
overanalyse a book

227
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,395
or a text,

228
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,399
tying everything
into the author's life,

229
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,569
it closes off my imagination.
I don't like it.

230
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,573
But why Marianne in particular?

231
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,241
I was going to ask.

232
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,785
Why that one?

233
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,870
Finish and you'll see why.

234
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,220
I'll read it.

235
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:41,792
I swear I'll read
Life of Marianne.

236
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:45,212
Careful what you say.
It's 600 pages.

237
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,839
I'll read it.
I don't give a fuck.

238
00:19:32,913 --> 00:19:33,921
Hello.

239
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,715
You look like crap.

240
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:37,274
You didn't sleep?

241
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,429
You fucked. I smell it on you.

242
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,473
How did it go with Thomas?

243
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,059
Sleep with him?

244
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,188
That's not an answer.

245
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,439
I'm pregnant.

246
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,984
I'm pregnant.
We're tying the knot.

247
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,194
- Sleep at his place?
- No.

248
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,030
- Details.
- There are none.

249
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,032
What did you two do?

250
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,701
Spent the afternoon together.

251
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,578
No afternoon fucks?

252
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,080
So you deny it.

253
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,416
What are you, a sex cop?

254
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:11,960
I want details.

255
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,963
It's obvious you fucked.
Why not say so?

256
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,840
I didn't or I'd say so.

257
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,509
You didn't sleep.
What did you do?

258
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,011
Go on, say it.

259
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:22,846
Come on.

260
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,181
Because it sucked?

261
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:28,310
I'd tell you, whatever happened.
I promise.

262
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:30,979
I don't buy it.

263
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,648
With her face, the smell on her...

264
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,650
I'm going in. And you?

265
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,110
We're coming.

266
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,613
I smell it from here.

267
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,032
You are so gross.

268
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,826
Since when is fucking a crime?

269
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,453
He's following her.

270
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:48,663
Straight to the bathroom!

271
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,016
Adèle?

272
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,102
Got a sec?

273
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:14,689
I feel like you're avoiding me.

274
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,362
I don't know, maybe...

275
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,574
you misunderstood,
or I went about it too fast.

276
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,453
In fact I like you a lot.

277
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,458
Nothing to say?

278
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:58,103
It wasn't good?

279
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,854
Yes.

280
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,657
It was great.

281
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,965
Say something.

282
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,430
I feel like I'm faking.

283
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,975
Faking everything.

284
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,436
If he's getting you
so worked up...

285
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,855
No, it's me.

286
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,983
He's not the problem.
I'm missing something.

287
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,570
I'm all messed up. I'm crazy.

288
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,071
There's a reason.

289
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:52,824
You're not sad out of the blue.

290
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,535
There have to be reasons.

291
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:14,220
Come on,
stop torturing yourself.

292
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,446
I look like crap.

293
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,740
Come on, you're gorgeous.

294
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,617
- Stop.
- I mean it.

295
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,828
- Think I don't see myself?
- How can you?

296
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,373
My nose is running,
my hair's all oily.

297
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,959
My face is a mess.

298
00:25:45,854 --> 00:25:47,988
Adds to your charm.

299
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,341
Thank God I have you.

300
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,426
You'll make him dump you.

301
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:57,639
Bastard.

302
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,641
I won't have to tell him.

303
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:03,353
If he sees me like this,
he'll say, "Beat it."

304
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,356
I'll answer, "Okay. You sure?"

305
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,023
It's over.

306
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,733
All settled.

307
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,657
I'm sorry. I swear I am.

308
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,191
Students, take to the streets!

309
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,821
No to privatization!

310
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,950
No to job cuts!

311
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,660
No to austerity measures!

312
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:08,788
More money for education!

313
00:29:08,891 --> 00:29:11,704
More money for education!

00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:08,741
in the play.

331
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,118
It's a word that stigmatizes

332
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,663
childhood,
and powerlessness too.

333
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:17,083
Childhood is a time...
no longer for you...

334
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,336
when we're helpless.
Not big enough,

335
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:23,089
not mature enough,
not strong enough.

336
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,299
Antigone is still a child.

337
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,594
She's still little.
"Too little", as she says.

338
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:32,473
But she refuses to be little anymore.
Not that day.

339
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:35,810
It's the day she will say no.

340
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:38,813
The day she says no,
the day she dies.

341
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,398
What we have here

342
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:43,317
is a perfect example of tragedy.

343
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,528
Tragedy is the unavoidable.

344
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,822
It's what we cannot escape,

345
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:48,823
no matter what.

346
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:50,533
It concerns eternity.

347
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,702
It concerns what is timeless.

348
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:55,621
It concerns the mechanism,
the essence,

349
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:56,914
of humankind.

350
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:17,393
- You okay?
- And you?

351
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,604
I was bored stiff in French.

352
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:22,648
Got a light?

353
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,993
You okay? Not too cold?

354
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:35,202
We're fine.

355
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,205
Alice is cute.

356
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,669
She has a nice little ass.

357
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:53,804
Checking out her ass?

358
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,558
I just noticed it
when she walked by.

359
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,229
The kind of girl I like.
Something cool about her.

360
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:08,277
Don't be jealous.
You're cute too.

361
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,072
I'm not jealous.

362
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,282
You sure?

363
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,244
You know it anyway.

364
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:19,455
Know what?

365
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,290
That you're really cute.

366
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,255
You're one of the prettiest girls
in our grade.

367
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,675
It's true.

368
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,010
Surprised to hear me say it?

369
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,891
I like that mysterious side of yours.

370
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,229
I bet the guys love it.

371
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,230
Not really.

372
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,943
Anyway, I find you cute.

373
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:51,070
Thanks.

374
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,115
Even cuter than Alice.

375
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,358
- Are you blushing?
- No.

376
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,665
Not at all.

377
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,297
You are too!

378
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,733
No.

379
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:15,469
Let me see.

380
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,138
Am I?

381
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,990
It's freezing.

382
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,539
- I'm dying to skip English.
- Me too.

383
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,007
- See you later?
- Okay.

384
00:34:53,195 --> 00:34:54,348
- Bye.
- Bye.

385
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,038
The drumstick?

386
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:25,581
I don't care.

387
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,628
Give me your plate.

388
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,218
I'll give you potatoes after.

389
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,345
What's wrong with it?

390
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:42,223
No idea. It cooked long enough.

391
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,266
It's hard to take apart.

392
00:35:44,377 --> 00:35:46,545
- Want some?
- Yes, please.

393
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:00,074
Give me your plate.

394
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,993
You seem out of it, Adèle.

395
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,495
Enjoy.

396
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:06,163
Want some?

397
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,414
Yes, please.

398
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:17,842
What?

399
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:20,761
You look like you had a great day.

400
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:23,806
I guess so.

401
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:25,474
It shows.

402
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,899
Not hungry?

403
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,317
I'd like some salad.

404
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,144
How are you?

405
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:13,814
And you?

406
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,467
Sorry, I didn't think...

407
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:47,348
that you'd get so hooked.

408
00:37:50,477 --> 00:37:53,354
What happened
yesterday was just...

409
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:58,359
It happened
on the spur of the moment.

410
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,867
I didn't think
you'd make much of it.

411
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:11,872
Understand?

412
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:17,962
Nothing will change between us.
I won't tell anyone.

413
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:23,801
I'm sorry.

414
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:31,725
See you later.

415
00:39:22,353 --> 00:39:23,236
Adèle.

416
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:24,746
Adèle, come here.

417
00:39:37,623 --> 00:39:38,639
Adèle.

418
00:39:38,693 --> 00:39:39,607
Adèle!

419
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,420
Can't she hear me?

420
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,091
Why did you ignore me?

421
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:48,469
What is it?

422
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,595
Nothing.

423
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,848
- Tell me what it is.
- Nothing.

424
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:55,434
- Talk to me.
- Let's go out.

425
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,536
What's up?

426
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:17,831
Adèle, my friends.

427
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,336
How are you?

428
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:26,757
Nice to see you.

429
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:27,966
You okay?

430
00:40:34,912 --> 00:40:37,643
Come on and dance a little.

431
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:38,852
Want to dance?

432
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,021
I'll finish my drink first.

433
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,564
Let's all dance.

434
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,525
I'll watch you, then I'll come.

435
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,235
Promise?

436
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:38,412
Love has no gender.
Take whoever loves you.

437
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:41,290
Whatever makes you happy.
Who cares?

438
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,584
True love.

439
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:47,421
Even if we have to die tomorrow,
who cares?

440
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:39,574
How are you?
Looking for someone?

441
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,202
I'm meeting a friend.

442
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,412
Too bad.

443
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:44,997
Enjoy your evening.

444
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,041
First time here?

445
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,502
You seem lost.

446
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:59,256
I'd buy you a drink,
but you've got one.

447
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:02,467
Are you okay?

448
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,593
Yeah.

449
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,556
Talking to my cousin?

450
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:08,849
Your cousin?

451
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:14,855
Can I go?

452
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,481
Be my guest.

453
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,732
Be good.

454
00:46:19,848 --> 00:46:22,863
Sophie, strawberry milk, please.

455
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:26,992
Why are you here all alone?

456
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,704
I don't know.

457
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:33,790
I came in here by chance.

458
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:37,711
By chance.

459
00:46:38,317 --> 00:46:39,395
Okay.

460
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:42,549
You're drinking a Bulldog.

461
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:44,885
Bull dyke beer.

462
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:47,721
I had no idea.

463
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:48,972
Sure is.

464
00:46:50,495 --> 00:46:51,339
Thank you.

465
00:46:52,464 --> 00:46:53,167
So.

466
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,312
Taste this.

467
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,319
So?

468
00:47:02,987 --> 00:47:04,154
You like it?

469
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:05,864
Honestly?

470
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,575
You won't be upset?

471
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,243
No, go ahead.

472
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:12,245
It's gross.

473
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:19,878
I love it.

474
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,758
Your type is rare here.

475
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,428
What's my type?

476
00:47:29,198 --> 00:47:30,764
Your type...

477
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,849
I don't know, underage...

478
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,893
hanging out in bars at night.

479
00:47:45,344 --> 00:47:47,262
How do you know I'm underage?

480
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,366
I can just tell.

481
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:50,283
Or else...

482
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,371
a straight girl who's a little

483
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,081
curious.

484
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,710
Like I said,
I came in here by chance.

485
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,464
No such thing as chance.

486
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,134
Think so?

487
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:15,141
What's your name?

488
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,692
- Adèle.
- Adèle.

489
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,604
Pretty name, Adèle.

490
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:24,651
Adèle means something in Arabic.
I think it means

491
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:26,486
sun.

492
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:27,779
Hope.

493
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:28,822
Love.

494
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:31,658
It means justice.

495
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:32,826
I was close.

496
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,327
Sun...

497
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:41,835
What's your name?

498
00:48:42,712 --> 00:48:43,920
My name's Emma.

499
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,132
What do you do?

500
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,843
What do you think?

501
00:48:50,842 --> 00:48:52,134
Hairdresser?

502
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,437
Fourth year of Fine Arts.

503
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:01,855
Fine Arts?

504
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,024
You like it?

505
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:06,276
Yeah, I do.

506
00:49:08,258 --> 00:49:10,008
Why is it called Fine Arts?

507
00:49:10,278 --> 00:49:12,363
Are there arts that are ugly?

508
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:16,453
No ugly arts. I mean...

509
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,497
some can be ugly.

510
00:49:19,874 --> 00:49:21,875
But it's subjective.

511
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:26,212
Because there are also
Decorative Arts, Applied Arts.

512
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,214
There's no Ugly Arts school.

513
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:29,466
Why not?

514
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,719
That's a good point.

515
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:35,889
At the time of the Impressionists,

516
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:37,891
everyone who was rejected

517
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:40,560
from the Salon
for beautiful paintings

518
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:44,080
and everyone who was considered,
for instance...

519
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,566
"ugly" went to the Salon of the...

520
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:47,734
Ugly.

521
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:51,279
Sort of the Salon of the Ugly.
The best artists.

522
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:52,906
You like painting?

523
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:55,700
I don't know much, but I like it.

524
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,410
What do you know?

525
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,371
Picasso.

526
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:01,790
And...

527
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:02,957
Picasso.

528
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,418
So you already know...

529
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:06,836
Picasso.

530
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,759
What do you do, Adèle?

531
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:15,970
I'm in school.

532
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,348
Oh yeah? What are you studying?

533
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:22,143
Literature.
I haven't graduated yet.

534
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:28,441
I'm in high school.
I'm doing French lit.

535
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:29,943
Okay, I see.

536
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,570
What's your favourite subject?

537
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,323
Depends on the teacher.

538
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,617
If the teacher inspires me,

539
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,537
I like it all.
I find it interesting.

540
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:44,332
It's a problem,
because my grades can vary.

541
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,585
They can drop
from 15 to 4 in a year.

542
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:49,170
From 15 to 4?

543
00:50:51,118 --> 00:50:53,040
From 15 to 4?

544
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:55,260
With you it's all or nothing.

545
00:50:57,972 --> 00:50:59,097
But...

546
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:02,475
they don't vary in French,
because I love to read.

547
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,894
And languages too.

548
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:07,188
Because...

549
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,943
- In fact I love English.
- I'm lousy at English.

550
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:11,985
Really?

551
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,071
It's something I'd really like to...

552
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,199
I should take English classes.

553
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:20,869
My accent is shit.
It's horrible.

554
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,830
- I'm really good.
- Really?

555
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,915
Lucky you.

556
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,921
And since I love American movies,

557
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:36,217
now I can watch movies
without subtitles. It helps me.

558
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,052
What was that?

559
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,852
I can't remember.

560
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,145
Say it.

561
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,355
I love American movies.

562
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:50,857
Like what?

563
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:54,944
I love it all. Scorsese, Kubrick...

564
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,488
Hey, honey.

565
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:58,531
What're you up to?

566
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,476
Not saying hi to my cousin?

567
00:52:00,531 --> 00:52:01,812
Cousin!

568
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:03,119
Cut it out.

569
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:06,039
How old is your cousin?

570
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,209
Allowed to be here?

571
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:11,961
Girls, show some respect.

572
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:17,717
We're going clubbing in Belgium.
Want to come?

573
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:20,345
- Good for you.
- What? You coming?

574
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,181
Come along with us, honey.

575
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:25,517
You can bring your cousin.

576
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:26,935
Hey, cousin...

577
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,939
She's cute!

578
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:35,235
We'll be waiting.

579
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:40,698
Five minutes!

580
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,204
What high school?

581
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:47,497
Pasteur.

582
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,750
Damn it, Emma!

583
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,002
I can't talk for five minutes!

584
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:23,700
What do I owe you?

585
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,201
It's paid for.

586
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,304
How did you do?

587
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:29,807
I flunked it big-time.
And I studied during break.

588
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,392
You cheated.

589
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,854
You were caught red-handed,
like an asshole.

590
00:54:50,456 --> 00:54:52,538
- How are you?
- And you?

591
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,876
I was nearby.
I thought we'd have a drink.

592
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:02,882
Adèle, you know her?

593
00:55:03,504 --> 00:55:04,262
Adèle!

594
00:55:05,246 --> 00:55:06,152
Adèle!

595
00:55:12,762 --> 00:55:13,543
Adèle!

596
00:55:13,613 --> 00:55:14,636
Adèle!

597
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:18,690
See that tomboy?

598
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,068
Where are they going?

599
00:56:01,205 --> 00:56:02,413
Can I move?

600
00:56:02,478 --> 00:56:04,444
- Sure you can.
- Really?

601
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:06,904
No, stay like that.

602
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:12,285
- Seriously?
- Yeah, you can move.

603
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:18,124
Thanks.

604
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:19,792
Thanks for what?

605
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,336
Just thanks.

606
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:25,131
Embarrassed?

607
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,216
A little.

608
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,593
Really?

609
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,802
Yeah.

610
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:32,180
It doesn't make you happy?

611
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,599
It does.

612
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:36,601
Doesn't show.

613
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:39,896
I don't get sketched every day.

614
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,243
You often draw people you meet?

615
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,370
No, not often.

616
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:58,831
I just felt like it.

617
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:06,839
- My hair isn't a mess?
- It's pretty. Don't touch.

618
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:10,384
I rarely do portraits.

619
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,345
I pick a detail.

620
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,722
And I use it again after.

621
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:16,682
Differently.

622
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,184
It can be...

623
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,020
a skin fold by the lips

624
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:23,439
or an emotion in the eyes.

625
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:27,527
"The mysterious weakness
of man's face."

626
00:57:28,237 --> 00:57:30,279
- Know that?
- I don't think so.

627
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:31,572
Sartre.

628
00:57:32,825 --> 00:57:34,784
- Know him?
- Yeah, but I never heard that.

629
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:39,872
I tried his essays,
but I didn't understand.

630
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:43,209
I prefer his plays.
You know Dirty Hands?

631
00:57:43,304 --> 00:57:44,117
Yeah.

632
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:45,419
- Like it?
- Love it.

633
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:46,712
Me too.

634
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:49,373
Try Existentialism is a Humanism.

635
00:57:50,014 --> 00:57:51,592
Good introduction to philosophy.

636
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,761
And not too hard.

637
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,973
The idea behind Sartre is that

638
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,864
existence precedes essence.

639
00:57:58,927 --> 00:58:01,477
We're born, we exist...

640
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:03,896
and then define ourselves
by our actions.

641
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:06,566
It gives us a great responsibility.

642
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:09,465
I think I read it. I'm sure.

643
00:58:09,684 --> 00:58:10,512
- Really?
- Yeah.

644
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:12,446
But I didn't understand.

645
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:16,242
Maybe I'm bad
at philosophy, but for me,

646
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:19,537
existence, essence
is like the chicken and the egg.

647
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:23,249
I don't think we can
ever know what came first.

648
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:25,877
You're funny.

649
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,047
None of that stuff matters much.

650
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:33,811
He started an intellectual revolution

651
00:58:33,886 --> 00:58:36,554
that set an entire generation free.

652
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:39,307
He said we can choose our lives

653
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,517
without any higher principle.

654
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:44,562
I was big on Sartre in high school.

655
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,320
- Really?
- It did me good.

656
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:50,776
Especially in affirming

657
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,279
my freedom and my own values.

658
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,325
And the rigorousness
of his commitments.

659
00:58:58,785 --> 00:58:59,911
I agree with it.

660
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,662
Sort of like Bob Marley.

661
00:59:02,183 --> 00:59:03,011
Yeah.

662
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:04,874
Almost.

663
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,876
I'm not so sure of that.

664
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:10,755
I'm almost sure of that.
Their ideas are similar.

665
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,882
You know "Get Up, Stand Up"?

666
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,467
Yeah, I know it.

667
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:16,469
He's committed.

668
00:59:16,637 --> 00:59:17,678
It's true.

669
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:18,721
Same as Sartre.

670
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:21,724
Philosopher, prophet...
same thing.

671
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:26,062
You can help me with philosophy,
because you seem...

672
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:28,940
Whenever you want.

673
00:59:37,769 --> 00:59:39,020
I have to go.

674
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,912
I was supposed to meet Sabine
15 minutes ago.

675
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:44,497
Want to see?

676
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,083
You don't have to like it.

677
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:51,629
Yeah, I like it.

678
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:56,342
It's strange,
because it's me and it isn't.

679
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:01,514
It's a sketch.
It needs some work.

680
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:07,770
I'll give it to you.

681
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:12,525
Been with Sabine long?

682
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,524
It's been...

683
01:00:14,572 --> 01:00:15,905
about two years.

684
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:18,781
Why?

685
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:23,786
I have to go.

686
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:26,205
What's your schedule like?

687
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:28,040
I'm studying for exams.

688
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:32,003
But maybe I can squeeze you in.

689
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,381
Yeah, I'll have time.

690
01:00:36,425 --> 01:00:37,925
Here's my number.

691
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,050
Promise you'll call?

692
01:00:45,091 --> 01:00:45,966
I swear.

693
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:47,412
Okay.

694
01:01:14,369 --> 01:01:15,411
See you soon.

695
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:17,048
Deal.

696
01:01:44,341 --> 01:01:46,509
Here she is. Speak of the devil.

697
01:01:46,919 --> 01:01:48,162
A friend of yours.

698
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:49,872
Someone named Emma.

699
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,083
You're welcome. Good-bye.

700
01:01:54,171 --> 01:01:57,129
<i>Just checking
you gave me the right number.</i>

701
01:01:57,506 --> 01:01:59,215
Think I'm avoiding you?

702
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:00,549
<i>I don't know.</i>

703
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,687
<i>Since I'm the weird
and imposing type.</i>

704
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,347
You think you're a certain type?

705
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:08,099
<i>Maybe.</i>

706
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:11,310
<i>The type who's over 18
and hangs out in gay bars.</i>

707
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:13,646
<i>I think we're pretty different.</i>

708
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:15,398
<i>I'm not so sure.</i>

709
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,900
<i>You can't tell from one meeting.</i>

710
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,165
How are you?

711
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:34,333
And you?

712
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:45,900
Got a light?

713
01:02:45,924 --> 01:02:48,097
Who was that girl who came?

714
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:49,166
With blue hair.

715
01:02:49,205 --> 01:02:51,455
A little bit dykey.

716
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,269
- Whatever.
- Totally.

717
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:55,229
Blue hair doesn't mean dyke.

718
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:57,773
It's obvious she eats pussy.

719
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,442
Where did you meet?

720
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,652
I met her in a café.

721
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:03,028
In a café?

722
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:06,449
Not in a gay bar,
by chance, with Valentin?

723
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:09,785
He said you went out with him.

724
01:03:11,723 --> 01:03:13,372
Why hang out there?

725
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,999
But I don't.

726
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,126
You didn't go with him?

727
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:19,712
He told us all.

728
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:21,881
I don't know why he said that.

729
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,257
Valentin!

730
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,636
You go to a gay bar with Adèle
the other night?

731
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,639
- Yeah, so what?
- Just asking.

732
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:34,727
You lied. It's not good.

733
01:03:34,895 --> 01:03:37,605
I didn't lie. It's just that...

734
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:43,027
we were out walking,
and we had a drink, that's all.

735
01:03:43,059 --> 01:03:45,905
- That was all.
- Just a drink in a gay bar.

736
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,657
- Okay, no problem.
- End of story.

737
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,410
We're just asking.

738
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:54,163
Why did she come meet you here?

739
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:56,123
Because we're friends.

740
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:58,209
Why don't we know her

741
01:03:58,627 --> 01:04:00,044
if you're friends?

742
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,923
I only just met her.

743
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,966
You already eat her pussy?

744
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:08,052
- What bullshit.
- You're fast.

745
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,304
You were this close!

746
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:12,306
We were just talking.

747
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:14,683
Talk to friends like this?

748
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:16,602
You talk to me like this?

749
01:04:18,516 --> 01:04:21,440
You blew me off and ran after her.

750
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,276
Is she the new woman in your life?

751
01:04:25,141 --> 01:04:27,328
Fess up and tell us.

752
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:30,157
But there's really nothing to fess up to.

753
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:33,536
She's a friend.
We were talking, so we were close.

754
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,955
What you're saying sounds phony.

755
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:39,083
I don't know.
It sounds phony because...

756
01:04:39,193 --> 01:04:41,293
you're all grilling me.

757
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:42,753
Admit you eat pussy.

758
01:04:42,963 --> 01:04:46,215
I don't care if you're a lesbo.
It's your life.

759
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:49,468
But you've slept naked
a few times in my bed.

760
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,011
That's harder.

761
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:53,097
- I'm a friend.
- I know.

762
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:54,515
I prefer to be clear.

763
01:04:54,683 --> 01:04:55,975
So admit it.

764
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,185
I won't admit to what I'm not.

765
01:04:58,353 --> 01:05:00,437
Give us a break, Adèle.

766
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:05,192
Some lesbo comes
and picks you up at school...

767
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:06,652
She's not a lesbo.

768
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:10,489
Don't deny it.
You can see it from a mile away.

769
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:11,699
You're a lesbo?

770
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:14,410
Fess up.

771
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:17,037
I don't care,
but keep me out of it.

772
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:18,998
You'll never eat my pussy.

773
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:21,625
I'd never touch you.
I'm no lesbian!

774
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:22,918
Chill out.

775
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:24,461
Don't tell me to chill.

776
01:05:24,629 --> 01:05:26,839
She's talking crap.
I'm fighting back.

777
01:05:27,007 --> 01:05:28,340
You're freaking out!

778
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:32,595
You're talking crap in front of everyone.
I'm not a lesbian!

779
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:34,388
Relax.

780
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,223
- You relax.
- We're talking.

781
01:05:36,391 --> 01:05:37,391
Just fess up.

782
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:39,602
She jumped down my throat!

783
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,437
Relax. How old are you?

784
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:45,149
How old are you?
I'm not a lesbian. Are you stupid?

785
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,484
You see what's going on?

786
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:48,777
She's a whore.

787
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:52,364
She sleeps naked in my bed,
checks out my ass.

788
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:54,491
Cut the shit!

789
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,452
Whores like you are into ass.

790
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:59,204
Does your bitch
have a blue pussy?

791
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:05,502
Fucking cunt!

792
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:12,801
Fucking lesbo!

793
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:16,263
Go eat pussy!

794
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:17,890
What the hell?

795
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:23,312
Why tell everyone we went to a gay bar?
Why the fuck did you do it?

796
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,606
It's not the end of the world.

797
01:06:25,774 --> 01:06:28,859
It is! They all think
I'm a lesbian, that I eat pussy.

798
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:30,819
She thinks I check out her ass.

799
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:32,821
You said we'd ask calmly.

800
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:36,784
Don't look. Listen to me.

801
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,750
You're not talking.
You attacked her.

802
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:46,585
She attacked us.

803
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:49,922
She attacked physically.
But you did verbally.

804
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:52,091
- We asked nicely.
- You did not.

805
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:55,844
If I were a closeted fag,
I'd have done the same.

806
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,472
Come on, let's fight.

807
01:06:58,658 --> 01:07:01,558
You'll never touch my pussy!

808
01:07:02,189 --> 01:07:03,067
Dirty dyke!

809
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:04,687
Shut your face!

810
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:11,360
He mentions "a pathological scruple".
What is that?

811
01:07:12,304 --> 01:07:14,764
Does that mean gravity, for you?

812
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:16,073
Louis?

813
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:17,825
In stanza two, he says...

814
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:21,286
"The only vice of water
is gravity."

815
01:07:22,122 --> 01:07:26,250
He associates natural law,
the universal law of gravity,

816
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:28,168
with a vice, as if...

817
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:32,256
everything natural is perverted,
and vice versa.

818
01:07:32,647 --> 01:07:34,436
It's sort of...

819
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:37,970
It's sort of the opposite of...

820
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:40,139
Catholic conservatism,

821
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:43,934
which would say
that vice is not natural,

822
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:45,686
and you have to...

823
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:49,356
repress it, reject it.

824
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:50,733
He says that

825
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:54,820
gravity itself is a vice.
It can't be avoided.

826
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,656
It's totally intrinsic to water.

827
01:07:57,824 --> 01:07:59,616
Adèle, what do you think?

828
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:02,077
About what Louis said.

829
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:07,082
I agree.

830
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:11,962
Are you following any of this?

831
01:08:12,328 --> 01:08:13,203
No.

832
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:21,513
We're talking about
a vice intrinsic to water. Gravity.

833
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:26,351
Start reading from "This vice..."

834
01:08:30,482 --> 01:08:31,857
Page 62.

835
01:10:06,739 --> 01:10:08,198
Throwing away the skin?

836
01:10:08,342 --> 01:10:09,592
Yeah, why?

837
01:10:10,707 --> 01:10:11,874
You don't eat it?

838
01:10:12,026 --> 01:10:13,192
I don't like it.

839
01:10:13,707 --> 01:10:16,420
I love it. I eat all the skins.

840
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:20,159
- Rinds too.
- Yeah?

841
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:22,301
As a kid I even ate my scabs.

842
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,844
I loved them.

843
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:27,681
You're funny.

844
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:29,975
So you're really into eating.

845
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,185
You can't imagine.

846
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:33,312
I can see.

847
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:35,647
I eat everything.

848
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:38,483
I could eat non-stop all day.

849
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:41,320
It's scary. Even when I'm full.

850
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,238
Everything but shellfish.

851
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:45,282
- Really?
- That's all.

852
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:47,284
That's what I like most.

853
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:48,660
It's beyond me.

854
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:51,955
I love oysters.

855
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:53,290
Really?

856
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,667
The texture alone grosses me out.

857
01:10:56,072 --> 01:10:56,783
Yeah?

858
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:59,212
That's the best part.

859
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:01,924
They're like little snot balls.

860
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:03,634
Big snot balls.

861
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,510
They remind me of something else.

862
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,221
I don't want to know.

863
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:19,858
Something to say?

864
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:21,860
I don't know.

865
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:23,028
What?

866
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:27,950
I wanted to know

867
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,285
when was the first time

868
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:33,246
that you tasted...

869
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:36,041
Tasted a sausage?

870
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:37,584
Tasted a girl.

871
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:38,752
A girl?

872
01:11:41,602 --> 01:11:43,507
You mean kiss?

873
01:11:43,675 --> 01:11:44,675
Or taste?

874
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,260
Kiss.

875
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:49,896
To start with. Then we'll see.

876
01:11:52,684 --> 01:11:53,892
I was fourteen.

877
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,687
Sometime around then.

878
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:59,690
There was a party.
All the girls had guys.

879
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,400
And I...

880
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:05,028
I went out with Louise.

881
01:12:05,196 --> 01:12:06,488
That was her name.

882
01:12:07,699 --> 01:12:10,409
We didn't kiss
during the party, but...

883
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:14,788
I asked her to sleep over.
That's when we kissed.

884
01:12:18,418 --> 01:12:20,043
You've always preferred girls?

885
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:23,130
I tried both.
I dated boys, girls...

886
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,841
and I realized I preferred girls.

887
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,927
For sure.

888
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:43,418
It's nice being here.

889
01:13:45,176 --> 01:13:46,262
Yeah.

890
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,465
A little too nice.

891
01:13:52,512 --> 01:13:53,512
I guess so.

892
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:10,605
It's here.

893
01:25:16,195 --> 01:25:17,153
Mom?

894
01:25:22,534 --> 01:25:24,410
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

895
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,123
Adèle...

896
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:30,541
my mom, Catherine.

897
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:33,586
We've heard good things about you.

898
01:25:33,754 --> 01:25:35,213
I'm glad to be here.

899
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:37,965
- For you.
- I'll take that.

900
01:25:38,592 --> 01:25:39,884
Very nice, thank you.

901
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:41,677
Hi, honey.

902
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:42,963
How are you?

903
01:25:42,978 --> 01:25:44,889
- And you?
- I'm fine.

904
01:25:45,213 --> 01:25:45,643
So...

905
01:25:45,666 --> 01:25:47,709
- We've been waiting.
- What's to eat?

906
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:49,393
Your favourite.

907
01:25:50,252 --> 01:25:51,354
That's Adèle.

908
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:53,064
Vincent, my stepdad.

909
01:25:56,276 --> 01:25:57,610
The family cook.

910
01:25:57,778 --> 01:26:00,279
We're having white.
Okay with you?

911
01:26:00,531 --> 01:26:02,073
- Sure.
- White's fine.

912
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:03,491
White too?

913
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:06,244
Tell me what you think of it.
I like it.

914
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:07,870
Vincent's new pick.

915
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:12,083
We drank a lot
while we were waiting for you.

916
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:14,085
- Not that much.
- True.

917
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:15,419
We were reasonable.

918
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:19,423
But it's always nice
to cook with a glass of white.

919
01:26:19,591 --> 01:26:21,050
My dad's the same.

920
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:22,468
Really?

921
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,263
Shall we toast?

922
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:27,348
To love.

923
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:30,351
Welcome, Adèle.

924
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:31,936
Big words. To love.

925
01:26:32,104 --> 01:26:33,855
Yes, to love, my love.

926
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:34,939
To love, then.

927
01:26:43,824 --> 01:26:45,116
How is it?

928
01:26:45,784 --> 01:26:47,285
- Delicious.
- Very good.

929
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:49,370
Good, isn't it? I like it a lot.

930
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:52,623
Me too.
I don't know wine, but it's good.

931
01:26:55,247 --> 01:26:57,712
I bet you haven't eaten all day.

932
01:26:58,130 --> 01:26:58,684
Adèle...

933
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:01,140
I went and bought

934
01:27:01,317 --> 01:27:04,302
the best I could find at Trière.

935
01:27:04,563 --> 01:27:05,479
You know it?

936
01:27:05,571 --> 01:27:06,501
- No.
- No?

937
01:27:06,597 --> 01:27:07,555
Just by name.

938
01:27:07,618 --> 01:27:08,501
By name.

939
01:27:08,599 --> 01:27:10,892
- Help yourself.
- I'm fine.

940
01:27:11,101 --> 01:27:13,936
Shit, I forgot to tell you
that Adèle...

941
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:16,564
doesn't like shellfish.

942
01:27:19,109 --> 01:27:20,109
I'm so sorry.

943
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,153
No big deal.

944
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:24,697
Seafood isn't really my thing.

945
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:26,407
But don't worry. I'm not difficult.

946
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:28,576
A nightmare. It's all we have.

947
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:30,453
You're a pain.

948
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:33,289
I go all out,
then you come and say...

949
01:27:33,457 --> 01:27:34,665
"Adèle hates oysters."

950
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:37,376
I'll have other stuff.
The entrée too? No problem.

951
01:27:37,544 --> 01:27:39,795
- Even jumbo shrimp?
- Especially.

952
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:44,342
No biggie. Perfect occasion
to initiate her. It's fine.

953
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:46,886
Like at the school cafeteria.

954
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:49,889
You squeeze lemon on the oyster.

955
01:27:50,276 --> 01:27:51,128
Okay.

956
01:27:51,475 --> 01:27:55,186
And usually,
if it's really good and fresh,

957
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:56,812
it moves.

958
01:27:57,731 --> 01:27:58,940
That means...

959
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:00,358
it's good. See?

960
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:01,525
Look.

961
01:28:01,693 --> 01:28:03,778
- It's moving.
- Why tell me this?

962
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:07,156
- It's alive.
- Exactly.

963
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:09,367
It has to be alive.

964
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:10,993
Don't eat it otherwise.

965
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:16,040
Alive is good.
You can eat the muscle too.

966
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:17,083
I'm fine.

967
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:18,793
Go on.

968
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:20,753
The juice too.

969
01:28:20,921 --> 01:28:24,882
Well?

970
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:27,176
- Are you okay?
- It's good.

971
01:28:27,344 --> 01:28:29,720
- You seem to enjoy it.
- It's good.

972
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:32,306
I'll try another.

973
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:33,724
Great.

974
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:36,018
These are excellent oysters.

975
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:42,316
You have beautiful paintings.

976
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:45,945
My ex-husband was an art lover.

977
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:49,198
Emma gets a lot of that
from her father.

978
01:28:49,366 --> 01:28:50,616
Your ex loved art

979
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,369
but your new husband...

980
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:54,912
A lover as well.

981
01:28:55,122 --> 01:28:58,040
But most of the paintings here...

982
01:28:58,750 --> 01:28:59,583
Lover of what?

983
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:02,128
They come from her father.

984
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:05,256
A lover of food and wine.
That counts.

985
01:29:05,424 --> 01:29:06,632
I agree.

986
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:07,758
And also...

987
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:09,051
culture.

988
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:12,430
Tell us about yourself.

989
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:15,631
We want to know about your life,

990
01:29:15,670 --> 01:29:17,773
what you want to do.

991
01:29:17,826 --> 01:29:19,979
I want to teach.

992
01:29:21,014 --> 01:29:21,600
Right.

993
01:29:21,670 --> 01:29:24,358
Nursery school. I love kids.

994
01:29:26,445 --> 01:29:27,570
You love kids.

995
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:29,905
Have you always wanted to teach?

996
01:29:30,008 --> 01:29:33,784
It's not that
I loved the school system,

997
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:37,288
but school means a lot to me.
It's taught me a lot.

998
01:29:37,696 --> 01:29:40,416
It helped expose me to things

999
01:29:41,001 --> 01:29:43,794
that my parents or friends
didn't show me.

1000
01:29:44,491 --> 01:29:46,297
I want to pass that on.

1001
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:48,341
What do you need to do?

1002
01:29:48,967 --> 01:29:52,887
I'll get a masters
and then do teacher training.

1003
01:29:53,055 --> 01:29:57,725
That way I can start
by being an assistant teacher.

1004
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:01,228
And honestly,
I don't see myself...

1005
01:30:01,778 --> 01:30:04,398
going to school
for 10 or 15 years

1006
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:07,790
just to end up unemployed.

1007
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:10,196
I want something concrete.

1008
01:30:10,489 --> 01:30:12,239
Does the job market scare you?

1009
01:30:12,696 --> 01:30:14,742
I sense it in what you say.

1010
01:30:15,025 --> 01:30:19,872
Maybe you'll go to school and see
that something else interests you.

1011
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:23,334
For now it's what interests me.

1012
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:26,003
At least you know
where you're going.

1013
01:30:27,865 --> 01:30:30,075
And that's important, I think.

1014
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:04,810
Mom?

1015
01:32:06,958 --> 01:32:07,841
Mom?

1016
01:32:09,271 --> 01:32:10,209
Mom?

1017
01:32:16,521 --> 01:32:17,615
Mom?

1018
01:32:25,307 --> 01:32:27,034
Surprise!

1019
01:32:28,627 --> 01:32:33,839

1020

01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:50,385

1024
01:33:00,723 --> 01:33:02,106
Happy birthday!

1025
01:33:03,203 --> 01:33:04,703
Happy 18th, Adèle!

1026
01:33:04,867 --> 01:33:06,117
Thank you.

1027
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:09,667
Mom? Cheers.

1028
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:55,022
- He's the king of bolognese.
- Hope you like it.

1029
01:34:58,610 --> 01:34:59,818
Help yourself.

1030
01:35:00,153 --> 01:35:01,612
Some wine?

1031
01:35:01,988 --> 01:35:03,113
Yes, please.

1032
01:35:03,323 --> 01:35:04,823
Nice to meet you, Emma.

1033
01:35:04,991 --> 01:35:07,618
We've heard about you for months.

1034
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:09,536
Here you are at last.

1035
01:35:09,788 --> 01:35:11,372
It's great to...

1036
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:15,042
to put a face
to everything you've said.

1037
01:35:15,418 --> 01:35:16,293
Really.

1038
01:35:16,795 --> 01:35:18,712
I'm the one who...

1039
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:20,631
Thanks for having me.

1040
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:22,508
It's our pleasure.

1041
01:35:23,121 --> 01:35:24,207
Enjoy your meal.

1042
01:35:24,262 --> 01:35:26,098
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

1043
01:35:27,191 --> 01:35:29,223
Eat. It'll get cold.

1044
01:35:35,673 --> 01:35:39,274
It's nice of you
to help her with philosophy.

1045
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:43,237
It's a really hard subject.

1046
01:35:43,405 --> 01:35:46,031
She was having
a tough time, but now...

1047
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:48,409
it seems to be going well.

1048
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,662
Your grades are up.
Thanks to you.

1049
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:53,497
It's a pleasure for me.

1050
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:58,252
I wasn't going about it right.
She taught me...

1051
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:00,212
to make outlines.

1052
01:36:00,255 --> 01:36:01,672
That's important.

1053
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:05,843
I don't know how
they can do that subject

1054
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:08,804
in just a year.
I don't see the point.

1055
01:36:08,972 --> 01:36:10,681
You can't do it in depth.

1056
01:36:10,972 --> 01:36:12,850
One year isn't enough.

1057
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:14,393
- Well?
- It's delicious.

1058
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:15,561
I knew it.

1059
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:18,313
So you're at Beaux-Arts.

1060
01:36:19,052 --> 01:36:19,950
Yes.

1061
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,109
- It shows.
- Really?

1062
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:24,027
It's artistic.

1063
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,351
Not everyone likes it.

1064
01:36:25,429 --> 01:36:28,187
No, it's not bad. It suits you well.

1065
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:29,406
Thanks.

1066
01:36:30,076 --> 01:36:31,285
Do you do it...

1067
01:36:32,454 --> 01:36:33,662
yourself?

1068
01:36:34,298 --> 01:36:35,189
Yes.

1069
01:36:36,082 --> 01:36:39,084
Her stuff is great.
She's having a show.

1070
01:36:39,294 --> 01:36:40,335
Already?

1071
01:36:40,747 --> 01:36:43,046
At the end of the year
we show our work.

1072
01:36:43,882 --> 01:36:46,884
You have to let us know.
We'll come see.

1073
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:51,847
Living off painting
is pretty hard nowadays.

1074
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:53,390
True, it's difficult.

1075
01:36:54,225 --> 01:36:57,895
The people who make
a living off it are all dead.

1076
01:36:58,062 --> 01:36:59,021
It's true.

1077
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:02,900
I'm a graphic artist too.

1078
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:08,071
And it's easier these days
to live off graphic arts

1079
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:09,323
than off painting.

1080
01:37:09,772 --> 01:37:11,658
There are openings in that.

1081
01:37:11,702 --> 01:37:12,389
Yeah.

1082
01:37:12,897 --> 01:37:15,537
It's important
to have an artistic side.

1083
01:37:15,858 --> 01:37:18,163
It's good to learn that.

1084
01:37:18,889 --> 01:37:22,753
But you need a real job too.
To earn a living.

1085
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:25,088
So if things ever get bad,

1086
01:37:25,381 --> 01:37:26,673
you make a living.

1087
01:37:31,658 --> 01:37:34,139
Not to pry,
but your boyfriend...

1088
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:37,197
what does he do?

1089
01:37:37,236 --> 01:37:39,436
He works in business.

1090
01:37:40,146 --> 01:37:42,147
That's good. It's reassuring.

1091
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:46,735
That way you can do
your painting and he...

1092
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:49,623
If you want to be an artist,

1093
01:37:49,686 --> 01:37:52,938
it's nice to have a husband
who pays the bills.

1094
01:37:58,912 --> 01:38:00,121
We're not married.

1095
01:38:00,490 --> 01:38:02,167
You have time.

1096
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:03,645
Take your time.

1097
01:38:03,724 --> 01:38:05,671
- You never know.
- True!

1098
01:38:08,299 --> 01:38:09,967
The pasta is delicious.

1099
01:38:12,178 --> 01:38:13,929
Simple but...

1100
01:38:15,123 --> 01:38:16,431
- Thank you.
- ...very good.

1101
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:09,443
My love.

1102
01:39:11,571 --> 01:39:14,281
You scared me.
I thought you were going to scream.

1103
01:39:14,532 --> 01:39:16,199
I was going to shriek.

1104
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:20,078
Good thing you didn't.

1105
01:39:29,047 --> 01:39:30,172
You're beautiful.

1106
01:39:35,136 --> 01:39:36,386
So soft.

1107
01:39:39,557 --> 01:39:43,060
My mom thinks
you're sleeping in the bed there.

1108
01:39:44,062 --> 01:39:45,228
On the cot.

1109
01:39:47,857 --> 01:39:49,858
Enjoying philosophy?

1110
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:53,654
I love it.
It's incredibly enriching.

1111
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:55,864
Very deep.

1112
01:39:56,074 --> 01:39:57,282
Very intense.

1113
01:39:57,659 --> 01:39:59,910
Orgasm precedes essence...

1114
01:40:00,578 --> 01:40:02,579
Your grade better be good.

1115
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:03,914
Give me a grade.

1116
01:40:08,502 --> 01:40:09,377
Fourteen.

1117
01:40:09,432 --> 01:40:10,573
Fourteen!

1118
01:40:11,673 --> 01:40:13,423
Just fourteen?

1119
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:18,095
You still need some practice.

1120
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:22,933
I'll give it all I've got.

1121
01:41:51,189 --> 01:41:53,273
This time it must be the wolf.

1122
01:41:53,829 --> 01:41:56,943
"It's Mrs. Goat,
with my seven kids.

1123
01:41:57,069 --> 01:41:59,988
"Let us hide.
Have you heard the bad news?"

1124
01:42:00,615 --> 01:42:02,991
The wolf is coming back!

1125
01:42:03,785 --> 01:42:06,828
"Come inside," says Mr. Rabbit.

1126
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:10,832
Everyone sits down,
and suddenly...

1127
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:12,793
Knock, knock, knock.

1128
01:42:14,337 --> 01:42:15,462
It's the wolf!

1129
01:42:15,838 --> 01:42:17,255
It must be the wolf.

1130
01:42:17,423 --> 01:42:18,507
Must be.

1131
01:42:19,175 --> 01:42:20,425
"It's me, Little Lamb.

1132
01:42:20,593 --> 01:42:22,427
"I was down by the stream.

1133
01:42:22,595 --> 01:42:25,055
"But I cannot go home, because...

1134
01:42:25,223 --> 01:42:27,682
"the wolf is coming back!"

1135
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:32,187
"Come in," says Mr. Rabbit.
"Come sit by the fire."

1136
01:42:35,358 --> 01:42:38,235
Little Lamb sits by the fire
when suddenly...

1137
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:44,783
Bang it.

1138
01:42:57,255 --> 01:42:58,338
Keep moving.

1139
01:43:02,593 --> 01:43:04,261
Keep using your hands!

1140
01:43:04,428 --> 01:43:06,596
Play your drums. Don't stop.

1141
01:43:15,648 --> 01:43:17,274
Keep on moving!

1142
01:43:38,296 --> 01:43:39,838
You don't want to play?

1143
01:43:40,214 --> 01:43:41,715
Want to stay here?

1144
01:43:41,924 --> 01:43:42,966
Hey, you.

1145
01:43:43,134 --> 01:43:44,384
Alone as usual.

1146
01:43:44,712 --> 01:43:45,329
Yeah.

1147
01:43:46,512 --> 01:43:47,470
Best behaved.

1148
01:43:47,597 --> 01:43:48,972
Always has been.

1149
01:43:53,019 --> 01:43:54,561
What are you doing tonight?

1150
01:43:55,646 --> 01:43:56,563
I don't know.

1151
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:58,481
We're going out for a drink.

1152
01:43:58,691 --> 01:44:01,443
Sylvie, Quentin, Anabelle...

1153
01:44:01,611 --> 01:44:02,944
Want to come?

1154
01:44:03,822 --> 01:44:04,400
Yeah.

1155
01:44:04,704 --> 01:44:07,324
- Yes?
- But tonight I have a family dinner.

1156
01:44:08,618 --> 01:44:10,952
You have a lot
of family dinners.

1157
01:44:11,495 --> 01:44:13,246
These days I do.

1158
01:44:13,456 --> 01:44:15,916
Maybe after. Around what time?

1159
01:44:16,459 --> 01:44:17,834
Are you avoiding us?

1160
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,669
No, why do you say that?

1161
01:44:20,171 --> 01:44:23,006
Whenever I suggest something,
you're busy.

1162
01:44:24,884 --> 01:44:26,885
Just bad timing, that's all.

1163
01:44:27,845 --> 01:44:29,012
Is your family far?

1164
01:44:30,071 --> 01:44:32,349
No, pretty close.

1165
01:44:32,516 --> 01:44:33,892
Ten kilometres.

1166
01:44:38,439 --> 01:44:39,689
Okay, then.

1167
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:42,651
I hope you'll be able

1168
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:45,195
to get free.

1169
01:44:46,197 --> 01:44:47,948
I'll do my best.

1170
01:44:48,699 --> 01:44:50,081
I swear I will.

1171
01:44:50,308 --> 01:44:51,504
- Yes?
- Yes.

1172
01:44:52,691 --> 01:44:53,519
Cool.

1173
01:44:55,027 --> 01:44:55,785
Cool.

1174
01:46:01,957 --> 01:46:03,066
Adèle.

1175
01:46:11,949 --> 01:46:13,533
It's gorgeous.

1176
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:14,644
Good evening.

1177
01:46:14,933 --> 01:46:15,886
I'm Adèle.

1178
01:46:16,316 --> 01:46:17,058
Hello.

1179
01:46:17,129 --> 01:46:20,191
I've seen you on canvas.
Finally in flesh and blood.

1180
01:46:20,223 --> 01:46:21,566
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1181
01:46:21,926 --> 01:46:22,730
I'm Adèle.

1182
01:46:27,004 --> 01:46:28,488
- How are you?
- How are you?

1183
01:46:28,632 --> 01:46:29,966
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

1184
01:46:47,985 --> 01:46:49,235
There's champagne.

1185
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:51,988
- You made them?
- Yes.

1186
01:46:52,364 --> 01:46:54,115
- Like it?
- Delicious.

1187
01:46:54,283 --> 01:46:55,617
It's chicken inside?

1188
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:58,787
There's chicken,
tuna, and shrimp.

1189
01:47:02,875 --> 01:47:05,877
- Good to see you.
- Same here. It's great.

1190
01:47:08,005 --> 01:47:08,880
Soon.

1191
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:14,636
In two months I've gotten big.

1192
01:47:15,513 --> 01:47:16,596
Come here.

1193
01:47:17,681 --> 01:47:18,938
This is Lise.

1194
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:19,822
How are you?

1195
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:21,564
How are you?

1196
01:47:21,685 --> 01:47:23,353
It's nice to see you.

1197
01:47:23,521 --> 01:47:24,687
Want to touch it?

1198
01:47:25,356 --> 01:47:26,356
Go on.

1199
01:47:26,524 --> 01:47:28,525
- You don't mind?
- Not at all.

1200
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:31,486
- Feel it?
- Yes. Boy or girl?

1201
01:47:31,654 --> 01:47:33,279
I don't want to know.

1202
01:47:33,447 --> 01:47:35,365
To keep it a mystery?

1203
01:47:40,511 --> 01:47:42,413
Does it hurt? Want to sit?

1204
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:43,706
- I'm fine.
- Sure?

1205
01:47:43,874 --> 01:47:45,291
Playing with baby?

1206
01:47:46,502 --> 01:47:48,545
- Is he the dad?
- Not at all.

1207
01:47:48,704 --> 01:47:50,008
You thought it was him?

1208
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:51,024
No, no, no.

1209
01:47:51,132 --> 01:47:52,423
Not him.

1210
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:53,758
I'm sorry.

1211
01:47:54,343 --> 01:47:55,510
He's an uncle.

1212
01:47:55,678 --> 01:47:56,719
Exactly.

1213
01:47:58,556 --> 01:48:00,723
What you do is really nice.

1214
01:48:01,559 --> 01:48:02,642
What do I do?

1215
01:48:02,768 --> 01:48:03,893
On the paintings.

1216
01:48:04,061 --> 01:48:06,396
Your presence, your poses.
Stunning.

1217
01:48:06,564 --> 01:48:07,772
Thanks. That's nice.

1218
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:08,940
It's normal.

1219
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:11,860
It's especially Emma
who did it all.

1220
01:48:11,928 --> 01:48:12,936
Very powerful.

1221
01:48:13,154 --> 01:48:15,196
Joachim, she writes very well.

1222
01:48:15,364 --> 01:48:16,531
Really?

1223
01:48:16,866 --> 01:48:19,325
Can I read your stuff sometime?

1224
01:48:20,119 --> 01:48:21,744
For the time being,

1225
01:48:21,912 --> 01:48:24,330
all I've written is my diary.

1226
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:25,130
She's shy.

1227
01:48:25,154 --> 01:48:27,542
I want her to write more.

1228
01:48:27,710 --> 01:48:29,443
I see you here

1229
01:48:29,544 --> 01:48:31,880
with a desire to appear on canvas.

1230
01:48:32,089 --> 01:48:35,133
Your writing must be wonderful.
I want to read it.

1231
01:48:36,177 --> 01:48:37,510
Want a drink?

1232
01:48:37,678 --> 01:48:39,262
- A glass.
- Champagne?

1233
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:40,763
And that painting?

1234
01:48:40,931 --> 01:48:42,599
That last one is amazing.

1235
01:48:49,152 --> 01:48:50,902
Okay, so...

1236
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:53,109
First of all,
thanks for being here.

1237
01:48:53,186 --> 01:48:55,153
Thanks for being on time.

1238
01:48:56,428 --> 01:49:00,116
I'd especially like
to thank my muse,

1239
01:49:00,179 --> 01:49:03,140
my source of inspiration
who makes me happy today...

1240
01:49:03,268 --> 01:49:04,185
Adèle.

1241
01:49:05,789 --> 01:49:06,915
Welcome, Adèle!

1242
01:49:09,835 --> 01:49:12,921
I'd also like to say
she did all the cooking.

1243
01:49:16,888 --> 01:49:18,222
Speech!

1244
01:49:19,345 --> 01:49:20,970
It's your turn now.

1245
01:49:21,639 --> 01:49:24,849
I'm really thrilled
to meet you all,

1246
01:49:25,079 --> 01:49:26,746
and I hope you like it.

1247
01:49:28,395 --> 01:49:29,604
Don't cry.

1248
01:49:29,772 --> 01:49:30,813
Cheers.

1249
01:49:30,981 --> 01:49:32,649
Let's have a toast.

1250
01:49:34,814 --> 01:49:35,697
To Adèle!

1251
01:49:35,736 --> 01:49:36,819
To Adèle!

1252
01:49:37,363 --> 01:49:38,947
To Emma and Adèle!

1253
01:49:39,865 --> 01:49:40,990
To love!

1254
01:49:41,183 --> 01:49:42,253
To love!

1255
01:49:48,999 --> 01:49:50,583
She's in a trance!

1256
01:49:52,253 --> 01:49:53,836
And not even drunk yet!

1257
01:49:57,776 --> 01:49:59,854
- That's good champagne.
- Thanks.

1258
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:03,763
Anything else?

1259
01:50:03,889 --> 01:50:05,682
Come sit down a little.

1260
01:50:05,849 --> 01:50:07,016
Join us.

1261
01:50:14,692 --> 01:50:15,900
What do you do?

1262
01:50:16,318 --> 01:50:18,319
I teach nursery school.

1263
01:50:19,498 --> 01:50:20,256
Okay.

1264
01:50:21,236 --> 01:50:22,361
And you?

1265
01:50:22,669 --> 01:50:25,410
I'm doing a Ph.D.

1266
01:50:25,521 --> 01:50:27,996
Both art history and philosophy.

1267
01:50:28,205 --> 01:50:31,332
I'm doing a Ph.D. on...
You know Egon Schiele?

1268
01:50:33,502 --> 01:50:35,586
- I told you about him.
- Maybe.

1269
01:50:35,713 --> 01:50:36,671
He does nudes,

1270
01:50:36,797 --> 01:50:40,008
emaciated,
in unlikely positions.

1271
01:50:40,110 --> 01:50:40,821
A bit...

1272
01:50:41,093 --> 01:50:44,053
I'm working on morbidity
in Schiele's oeuvre.

1273
01:50:45,389 --> 01:50:47,932
Didn't you show her some stuff?

1274
01:50:48,475 --> 01:50:50,226
Yeah, but I prefer Klimt.

1275
01:50:50,728 --> 01:50:52,645
Klimt is so...

1276
01:50:52,938 --> 01:50:54,731
There's something so...

1277
01:50:54,898 --> 01:50:57,066
florid... decorative.

1278
01:50:57,108 --> 01:51:00,069
Florid and decorative?
You and I can't talk.

1279
01:51:00,946 --> 01:51:03,489
You hate it
when people disagree.

1280
01:51:03,657 --> 01:51:04,907
I like Schiele a lot.

1281
01:51:05,743 --> 01:51:07,493
It's more twisted.

1282
01:51:07,953 --> 01:51:10,079
It's darker, more obscure.

1283
01:51:10,247 --> 01:51:12,540
That's the reason I like Klimt.

1284
01:51:13,083 --> 01:51:14,250
It's that...

1285
01:51:15,586 --> 01:51:17,920
The problem
with that florid stuff...

1286
01:51:18,088 --> 01:51:19,505
It's not florid.

1287
01:51:19,673 --> 01:51:21,507
You can't say it's florid.

1288
01:51:25,512 --> 01:51:26,763
I'm hungry!

1289
01:51:28,682 --> 01:51:29,766
I'm starving.

1290
01:51:31,852 --> 01:51:33,269
Some sauce too.

1291
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:39,108
Any Parmesan?

1292
01:51:41,904 --> 01:51:43,279
Get in line.

1293
01:51:46,784 --> 01:51:49,077
That's fine. Perfect. Thank you.

1294
01:51:49,912 --> 01:51:50,912
You're welcome.

1295
01:51:52,664 --> 01:51:53,539
It's so good!

1296
01:51:55,334 --> 01:51:57,794
Adèle, it's out of this world!

1297
01:51:57,961 --> 01:51:58,795
Thank you so much.

1298
01:51:59,338 --> 01:52:00,380
You're welcome.

1299
01:52:03,801 --> 01:52:05,301
- Good?
- Excellent.

1300
01:52:06,387 --> 01:52:09,931
A worm crawls out
of a plate of spaghetti and says,

1301
01:52:10,557 --> 01:52:12,433
"That was some gangbang!"

1302
01:52:12,601 --> 01:52:13,893
How sweet!

1303
01:52:14,144 --> 01:52:16,771
"Sweet" may not be the word.

1304
01:52:17,439 --> 01:52:19,607
What a pleasure to share this.

1305
01:52:19,775 --> 01:52:21,317
Our kind of pleasure.

1306
01:52:22,152 --> 01:52:23,569
Can pleasure be shared?

1307
01:52:25,114 --> 01:52:27,365
We each experience it differently.

1308
01:52:27,533 --> 01:52:28,574
My pleasure

1309
01:52:28,826 --> 01:52:30,535
isn't the same as yours.

1310
01:52:30,606 --> 01:52:33,371
I don't get
the same pleasure as you.

1311
01:52:33,956 --> 01:52:35,415
Find the Parmesan?

1312
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:38,126
...between the sexes,
a quality of pleasure

1313
01:52:38,155 --> 01:52:39,627
so different

1314
01:52:39,795 --> 01:52:41,838
that we attain differing realities.

1315
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:43,548
Over and above orgasm.

1316
01:52:43,639 --> 01:52:46,175
I'm curious.
Why do you think that?

1317
01:52:48,345 --> 01:52:49,220
Because...

1318
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:50,721
We make faces?

1319
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:54,058
- We make more noise?
- Big difference!

1320
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:55,977
Something to drink?

1321
01:52:56,436 --> 01:52:59,230
Every time I slept with a woman,

1322
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:00,940
I noticed something

1323
01:53:01,358 --> 01:53:02,191
that's not...

1324
01:53:02,359 --> 01:53:03,860
She enters another world.

1325
01:53:03,879 --> 01:53:04,597
That's it.

1326
01:53:04,664 --> 01:53:06,957
Orgasm is
an out-of-body experience.

1327
01:53:07,214 --> 01:53:09,691
Our orgasm is limited.

1328
01:53:09,761 --> 01:53:12,869
For you,
female orgasm is mystical.

1329
01:53:13,036 --> 01:53:15,037
I'm totally sure of it.

1330
01:53:15,789 --> 01:53:17,206
Anyone need anything?

1331
01:53:18,461 --> 01:53:19,469
Adèle, Adèle.

1332
01:53:19,668 --> 01:53:21,794
Sit down.
You've been serving everyone.

1333
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:22,837
Here, eat.

1334
01:53:24,548 --> 01:53:27,425
Relax a little.
You cooked for everyone.

1335
01:53:30,387 --> 01:53:35,016
...insofar as I'm a man,
everything I glimpse is frustrated

1336
01:53:35,184 --> 01:53:37,435
by the limits of male sexuality.

1337
01:53:37,978 --> 01:53:40,897
Even though I've done it
with men and women.

1338
01:53:41,064 --> 01:53:44,859
I remember the story of Tiresias,
who was lucky enough

1339
01:53:45,068 --> 01:53:47,862
to be a man, then a woman,
then a man again.

1340
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:49,989
When he was asked

1341
01:53:50,115 --> 01:53:53,034
who gets more pleasure,
man or woman,

1342
01:53:53,077 --> 01:53:55,092
he answered categorically

1343
01:53:55,204 --> 01:53:58,122
that women get nine times
more pleasure than men.

1344
01:53:58,202 --> 01:54:01,819
Ever since women
have been shown in paintings,

1345
01:54:01,858 --> 01:54:06,881
their ecstasy is shown more than men's,
which is shown via woman.

1346
01:54:07,208 --> 01:54:09,420
We see women bathing, we see...

1347
01:54:09,486 --> 01:54:11,772
- The Origin of the World.
- Yeah!

1348
01:54:11,887 --> 01:54:14,430
Men try desperately
to depict it.

1349
01:54:15,557 --> 01:54:16,849
Meaning they saw it.

1350
01:54:17,017 --> 01:54:19,268
- Or imagined it.
- Or wished for it.

1351
01:54:19,399 --> 01:54:21,360
It could be their fantasy.

1352
01:54:21,423 --> 01:54:22,423
No, I think...

1353
01:54:22,856 --> 01:54:25,608
- So it's based in...
- Look in their eyes.

1354
01:54:25,776 --> 01:54:28,069
That gaze into another world.

1355
01:54:28,237 --> 01:54:31,113
Art by women
never tackles female pleasure.

1356
01:54:31,281 --> 01:54:32,698
Excellent pasta.

1357
01:54:32,866 --> 01:54:34,075
Want some more?

1358
01:54:35,285 --> 01:54:36,785
Yeah, I'd like a little.

1359
01:54:36,847 --> 01:54:39,163
Not too spicy? You like spicy?

1360
01:54:39,331 --> 01:54:41,249
It's a little spicy.

1361
01:54:41,458 --> 01:54:43,292
But just spicy enough.

1362
01:54:43,585 --> 01:54:45,545
You see, Emma, your paintings

1363
01:54:45,712 --> 01:54:47,797
of Adèle seem to illustrate this.

1364
01:54:47,965 --> 01:54:50,508
I know I'll never experience that,

1365
01:54:50,676 --> 01:54:52,552
because I'll always be a man.

1366
01:54:53,971 --> 01:54:57,139
I love the sauce.
Make it with fresh tomatoes?

1367
01:54:57,307 --> 01:54:58,307
From the market.

1368
01:54:58,517 --> 01:54:59,725
I can tell.

1369
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:06,399
Had you ever posed before?

1370
01:55:06,525 --> 01:55:07,483
Never.

1371
01:55:07,651 --> 01:55:09,151
It's your first time?

1372
01:55:09,319 --> 01:55:10,653
I don't really pose.

1373
01:55:10,821 --> 01:55:12,633
- Just with Emma.
- Yeah?

1374
01:55:13,031 --> 01:55:15,533
You seem comfortable
in the paintings.

1375
01:55:15,993 --> 01:55:18,869
Because they were
at times when I...

1376
01:55:18,996 --> 01:55:20,121
I don't know.

1377
01:55:20,289 --> 01:55:22,957
I can't imagine doing it
with someone else.

1378
01:55:23,125 --> 01:55:25,334
I know it's a stupid question...

1379
01:55:25,627 --> 01:55:28,129
but have you been
with girls for long?

1380
01:55:29,151 --> 01:55:32,800
Is Emma the first,
or were there any before?

1381
01:55:32,834 --> 01:55:34,376
She's the first.

1382
01:55:38,849 --> 01:55:40,099
Is it different?

1383
01:55:40,138 --> 01:55:41,684
- From what?
- Guys.

1384
01:55:42,019 --> 01:55:43,019
Yes.

1385
01:55:44,813 --> 01:55:45,938
A little.

1386
01:55:48,317 --> 01:55:49,942
Is it gentler?

1387
01:55:51,051 --> 01:55:52,653
It depends.

1388
01:55:53,201 --> 01:55:54,285
I have no idea.

1389
01:55:54,948 --> 01:55:56,782
Sorry to ask like this.

1390
01:55:57,576 --> 01:55:59,201
You don't have to answer.

1391
01:55:59,911 --> 01:56:02,038
I don't think I could explain.

1392
01:56:03,624 --> 01:56:04,957
What do you do?

1393
01:56:05,125 --> 01:56:06,959
I teach nursery school.

1394
01:56:07,085 --> 01:56:08,377
You like kids.

1395
01:56:10,255 --> 01:56:11,922
Would you like to have some?

1396
01:56:16,178 --> 01:56:17,553
What do you do?

1397
01:56:18,221 --> 01:56:19,639
I'm an actor.

1398
01:56:19,806 --> 01:56:21,057
I do action movies.

1399
01:56:21,391 --> 01:56:23,225
I did an action movie,

1400
01:56:23,393 --> 01:56:24,900
my first, in the States,

1401
01:56:24,963 --> 01:56:28,397
that I got because I speak Arabic.
They dig that.

1402
01:56:28,607 --> 01:56:29,982
The beard thing.

1403
01:56:30,275 --> 01:56:32,652
We were terrorists, hijackers.

1404
01:56:33,291 --> 01:56:36,072
They love it when we say
Allah al akbar.

1405
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:37,865
So we did that.

1406
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:41,285
I'm serious.

1407
01:56:41,828 --> 01:56:44,705
It was fun to see
how the Americans work.

1408
01:56:46,534 --> 01:56:47,909
Where in the States?

1409
01:56:47,980 --> 01:56:49,136
Where in the States?

1410
01:56:49,711 --> 01:56:52,630
We shot it in a studio in L.A.

1411
01:56:53,465 --> 01:56:55,091
But it took place in New York.

1412
01:56:55,258 --> 01:56:57,593
They rebuilt the city.
It's wild.

1413
01:56:57,761 --> 01:57:01,263
It's like you're walking
down the streets of New York.

1414
01:57:01,973 --> 01:57:04,183
Then I was
in New York on vacation.

1415
01:57:04,309 --> 01:57:06,477
I really, really loved it.

1416
01:57:06,687 --> 01:57:09,605
I'm sure
it's a city you'd adore.

1417
01:57:10,857 --> 01:57:12,608
- I'm dying to go.
- Really?

1418
01:57:12,734 --> 01:57:14,026
So go. Why wait?

1419
01:57:15,737 --> 01:57:17,113
- It's a total trip.
- Really?

1420
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:18,114
It's amazing.

1421
01:57:18,699 --> 01:57:21,242
It's like walking on a film set.

1422
01:57:21,618 --> 01:57:22,451
I swear.

1423
01:57:22,661 --> 01:57:25,121
Such energy.
Everything seems possible.

1424
01:57:25,288 --> 01:57:26,872
You can do whatever.

1425
01:57:27,207 --> 01:57:29,083
Like there are no barriers.

1426
01:57:30,168 --> 01:57:31,961
There's a huge bug on you.

1427
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:34,098
- It's gone.
- It's gone?

1428
01:57:34,662 --> 01:57:35,454
What was it?

1429
01:57:35,674 --> 01:57:36,674
I don't know.

1430
01:59:26,485 --> 01:59:27,902
What are you reading?

1431
01:59:28,578 --> 01:59:31,956
A piece on Schiele, the guy
Lucie and I were talking about.

1432
01:59:35,252 --> 01:59:36,961
Your friends are nice.

1433
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:38,587
They're funny.

1434
01:59:38,755 --> 01:59:40,965
They talk about so much stuff.

1435
01:59:41,132 --> 01:59:43,425
They seem so knowledgeable.

1436
01:59:44,261 --> 01:59:46,428
So cultured.
I felt uncomfortable.

1437
01:59:47,597 --> 01:59:48,806
You were perfect.

1438
02:00:25,677 --> 02:00:27,595
You made a good impression.

1439
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:30,180
Especially on Joachim.

1440
02:00:31,190 --> 02:00:32,023
Really?

1441
02:00:34,445 --> 02:00:35,863
What does he do?

1442
02:00:35,911 --> 02:00:36,739
Joachim?

1443
02:00:37,188 --> 02:00:38,272
I was afraid to ask.

1444
02:00:40,150 --> 02:00:42,985
- Biggest gallery owner in Lille.
- In Lille?

1445
02:00:43,320 --> 02:00:47,114
He's extremely cultured.
A genius. He knows everything.

1446
02:00:47,660 --> 02:00:51,163
He shows only the crème de la crème.
Believe me...

1447
02:00:51,322 --> 02:00:54,158
if he ever shows my work,
I've got it made.

1448
02:00:54,497 --> 02:00:55,956
He'll show your work.

1449
02:00:56,142 --> 02:00:58,018
- Think so?
- Of course.

1450
02:00:58,835 --> 02:01:00,920
He talks about you
as if you were Picasso.

1451
02:01:01,087 --> 02:01:03,547
It's business above all
for those guys.

1452
02:01:03,924 --> 02:01:07,134
- He's your friend. Why wouldn't...
- My friend...

1453
02:01:07,552 --> 02:01:10,346
Our relationship
is mostly professional.

1454
02:01:11,681 --> 02:01:13,474
Not really a friendship.

1455
02:01:14,017 --> 02:01:15,684
But he can change things.

1456
02:01:16,688 --> 02:01:17,938
Just believe in it.

1457
02:01:18,521 --> 02:01:19,855
Knock on wood.

1458
02:01:28,490 --> 02:01:29,907
You should also do

1459
02:01:30,075 --> 02:01:32,076
something you really like.

1460
02:01:33,286 --> 02:01:34,453
I work.

1461
02:01:34,746 --> 02:01:36,580
I know. I don't mean that.

1462
02:01:36,748 --> 02:01:39,249
You write really well, for example.

1463
02:01:39,501 --> 02:01:41,043
Why not write some stuff?

1464
02:01:42,003 --> 02:01:43,712
Even short stories...

1465
02:01:43,922 --> 02:01:46,382
I've always just written for myself.

1466
02:01:47,050 --> 02:01:50,052
It's a shame
to waste your talent like that.

1467
02:01:50,220 --> 02:01:53,889
I write what I feel.
I can't expose my life to the world.

1468
02:01:54,015 --> 02:01:56,266
You can invent rather than expose.

1469
02:01:56,393 --> 02:01:58,268
I don't know how.

1470
02:01:58,561 --> 02:02:01,897
You love inventing stories
and telling them to kids.

1471
02:02:02,399 --> 02:02:03,983
You like doing that.

1472
02:02:04,150 --> 02:02:08,404
But for kids. Constructing
a storyline isn't my thing.

1473
02:02:08,738 --> 02:02:10,364
Anyway, it's up to you.

1474
02:02:11,366 --> 02:02:12,908
I don't know.

1475
02:02:13,326 --> 02:02:15,119
I'd like you to be...

1476
02:02:16,788 --> 02:02:18,414
- Be what?
- I don't know.

1477
02:02:18,581 --> 02:02:20,207
Fulfilled.

1478
02:02:20,375 --> 02:02:22,334
I am fulfilled with you.

1479
02:02:23,503 --> 02:02:26,797
I like it that you're here,
cooking and stuff...

1480
02:02:27,507 --> 02:02:29,425
but I'd like to see you happy.

1481
02:02:29,801 --> 02:02:31,385
I am happy.

1482
02:02:31,928 --> 02:02:34,596
I'm happy with you, like this.

1483
02:02:34,806 --> 02:02:36,515
It's my way of being happy.

1484
02:02:38,226 --> 02:02:39,810
If you say so.

1485
02:02:41,563 --> 02:02:43,647
It hurts when you insist.

1486
02:02:43,815 --> 02:02:44,982
I'm not insisting.

1487
02:02:45,150 --> 02:02:46,608
A little.

1488
02:02:55,994 --> 02:02:57,369
Kiss me.

1489
02:03:01,166 --> 02:03:02,583
A real kiss.

1490
02:03:11,384 --> 02:03:12,634
I want you.

1491
02:03:13,344 --> 02:03:14,428
I can't.

1492
02:03:14,679 --> 02:03:16,055
Why not?

1493
02:03:16,264 --> 02:03:17,639
I'm having my period.

1494
02:03:19,434 --> 02:03:21,268
Why now?

1495
02:03:21,686 --> 02:03:23,645
I don't know. It happens.

1496
02:03:23,772 --> 02:03:24,646
You're early.

1497
02:03:25,023 --> 02:03:27,566
What can I say? I have no idea.

1498
02:03:36,576 --> 02:03:38,202
Is Lise your ex?

1499
02:03:38,623 --> 02:03:40,076
- Lise?
- Yeah.

1500
02:03:40,545 --> 02:03:41,764
No.

1501
02:03:43,833 --> 02:03:45,459
She paints too.

1502
02:03:47,337 --> 02:03:49,671
<i>Monday is all grey.</i>

1503
02:03:49,839 --> 02:03:52,424
Tuesday, yellow like hay.

1504
02:03:52,592 --> 02:03:55,469
Pink Wednesday,
stay home and play.

1505
02:03:55,637 --> 02:03:58,430
Blue Thursday comes our way.

1506
02:03:58,598 --> 02:04:01,394
Thursday green is next seen.

1507
02:04:02,685 --> 02:04:04,144
Friday green!

1508
02:04:04,207 --> 02:04:05,848
Look, the little children.

1509
02:04:05,897 --> 02:04:07,022
Who's first today?

1510
02:04:12,112 --> 02:04:14,029
Sana, stand up.

1511
02:04:14,065 --> 02:04:15,971
It's your turn today Sana.

1512
02:04:16,651 --> 02:04:17,854
Alright, quiet now.

1513
02:04:19,447 --> 02:04:20,702
In the morning?

1514
02:04:21,913 --> 02:04:24,039
We come to school.

1515
02:04:24,539 --> 02:04:27,709
Listen, she's telling us
what we do during the day.

1516
02:04:27,877 --> 02:04:29,503
Listen up. Listen up, friends.

1517
02:04:29,671 --> 02:04:32,464
Stop pinching, Maxence.
Come here.

1518
02:04:33,675 --> 02:04:34,842
Go on, Sana.

1519
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:39,263
We play.

1520
02:04:40,390 --> 02:04:42,474
After we get here, we play.

1521
02:04:42,570 --> 02:04:43,320
Yes.

1522
02:04:43,393 --> 02:04:45,477
We do our activities. And then?

1523
02:04:46,271 --> 02:04:47,938
We go outside for...

1524
02:04:48,356 --> 02:04:49,815
Recess.

1525
02:04:49,941 --> 02:04:50,941
Then?

1526
02:04:51,067 --> 02:04:52,943
We have gym.

1527
02:04:53,207 --> 02:04:54,778
After gym?

1528
02:04:56,072 --> 02:04:57,447
We take a nap,

1529
02:04:57,574 --> 02:05:00,551
and then we work
with Thérèse and Madame.

1530
02:05:00,622 --> 02:05:01,708
Thanks, that's good.

1531
02:05:06,403 --> 02:05:07,130
Go on.

1532
02:05:19,971 --> 02:05:21,805
Time to stop talking.

1533
02:05:24,767 --> 02:05:26,602
Do they have everything?

1534
02:05:26,769 --> 02:05:28,520
I had three dollies.

1535
02:05:50,001 --> 02:05:51,835
I can watch them now.

1536
02:05:52,003 --> 02:05:53,378
- Really?
- Sure.

1537
02:05:53,546 --> 02:05:55,005
I'll meet you after.

1538
02:06:25,912 --> 02:06:28,372
<i>One new message.</i>

1539
02:06:31,209 --> 02:06:32,334
<i>Honey, it's me.</i>

1540
02:06:32,502 --> 02:06:36,380
<i>I'm still with Lise, working
on the mock-up I mentioned.</i>

1541
02:06:36,589 --> 02:06:40,008
<i>It's a big job,
and it has to be perfect.</i>

1542
02:06:40,677 --> 02:06:42,594
<i>Don't wait up. I'll be late.</i>

1543
02:06:42,762 --> 02:06:44,846
<i>Call if you want.</i>

1544
02:06:45,848 --> 02:06:47,015
<i>Take care.</i>

1545
02:07:34,428 --> 02:07:35,694
Adèle, Adèle.

1546
02:08:10,725 --> 02:08:12,142
It's hot.

1547
02:10:48,925 --> 02:10:53,094
What's his problem with me?
He has a thing with lesbians!

1548
02:10:53,971 --> 02:10:58,308
I'm happy to explain my paintings,
to say what inspired me,

1549
02:10:58,518 --> 02:11:01,436
but I can't get
into intimate details.

1550
02:11:01,813 --> 02:11:04,606
I don't have to justify who I am.

1551
02:11:04,774 --> 02:11:07,526
There are things
I don't want to tell him!

1552
02:11:10,907 --> 02:11:11,626
No.

1553
02:11:16,545 --> 02:11:17,279
Emma.

1554
02:11:17,912 --> 02:11:19,162
I can't sell myself.

1555
02:11:19,330 --> 02:11:22,290
When I see someone
constantly needling me...

1556
02:11:22,932 --> 02:11:25,043
He meant to put me down!

1557
02:11:25,169 --> 02:11:26,670
That's the thing.

1558
02:11:32,718 --> 02:11:35,233
He has to respect my work.

1559
02:11:35,346 --> 02:11:38,890
It's my freedom of expression,
my artistic freedom.

1560
02:11:39,058 --> 02:11:40,600
I can paint what I want!

1561
02:11:41,686 --> 02:11:42,826
You don't want some coffee?

1562
02:11:42,881 --> 02:11:45,107
Too bad if it's no.

1563
02:11:45,231 --> 02:11:47,732
But he can't say,
"I'll buy your painting,

1564
02:11:47,883 --> 02:11:49,670
"but accentuate the line...

1565
02:11:49,693 --> 02:11:54,762
"or make it blurrier here,
or use this or that colour."

1566
02:11:54,943 --> 02:11:56,700
I'm not saying that.

1567
02:11:56,859 --> 02:11:58,077
I'm open to criticism.

1568
02:11:58,140 --> 02:12:00,495
I saw his questions coming.

1569
02:12:00,566 --> 02:12:02,526
How can I answer that?

1570
02:12:03,375 --> 02:12:04,820
Okay. See you. Ciao.

1571
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:08,837
Asshole.

1572
02:12:09,338 --> 02:12:10,839
Bread and butter?

1573
02:12:11,299 --> 02:12:14,092
It's crazy.
They don't understand anything.

1574
02:12:15,595 --> 02:12:19,014
There's a fad in painting.
You have to follow it.

1575
02:12:19,181 --> 02:12:20,682
I don't care about fads.

1576
02:12:20,850 --> 02:12:22,271
- Want one?
- No, thanks.

1577
02:12:22,893 --> 02:12:24,394
I don't give a shit.

1578
02:12:24,604 --> 02:12:27,689
People only think
in terms of business.

1579
02:12:27,857 --> 02:12:32,027
They have no...
I don't know how to explain it...

1580
02:12:32,903 --> 02:12:34,362
They have no taste.

1581
02:12:34,530 --> 02:12:36,197
They just have no taste.

1582
02:12:37,408 --> 02:12:39,743
It's normal to be tense at times.

1583
02:12:40,009 --> 02:12:42,260
I get tense with colleagues too.

1584
02:12:47,251 --> 02:12:50,920
Did you put your pacifier
in the binky box?

1585
02:12:59,388 --> 02:13:00,889
Say good-bye to Mommy.

1586
02:13:02,433 --> 02:13:03,850
Thank you. How nice.

1587
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:12,859
Hang up your coat.

1588
02:13:24,747 --> 02:13:27,290
Luna, go find your name.

1589
02:13:31,295 --> 02:13:32,770
- Friends?
- Yes.

1590
02:13:33,172 --> 02:13:35,632
I wore my pants.

1591
02:13:37,259 --> 02:13:39,594
Did you wear your pants?

1592
02:13:39,762 --> 02:13:41,763
I wore this again.

1593
02:14:18,884 --> 02:14:20,135
Thanks a lot.

1594
02:14:57,506 --> 02:14:58,715
Anything wrong?

1595
02:15:02,136 --> 02:15:05,054
I went out
for a drink with my co-workers.

1596
02:15:05,681 --> 02:15:07,557
After work. Why didn't you call?

1597
02:15:09,685 --> 02:15:11,394
Did someone drop you off?

1598
02:15:16,025 --> 02:15:17,192
Who?

1599
02:15:18,486 --> 02:15:19,486
A girl from work.

1600
02:15:19,779 --> 02:15:20,945
A girl?

1601
02:15:26,702 --> 02:15:29,370
Why'd she drop you off
down the street?

1602
02:15:31,165 --> 02:15:34,209
I didn't want to say
I went out with a girl.

1603
02:15:34,376 --> 02:15:35,376
Really?

1604
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:37,712
Why am I whispering?

1605
02:15:38,088 --> 02:15:40,215
You ashamed to be with a girl?

1606
02:15:40,716 --> 02:15:43,176
No, but they don't all
need to know.

1607
02:15:43,344 --> 02:15:45,220
Afterwards they start blabbing.

1608
02:15:47,746 --> 02:15:49,974
You think I'm ashamed?

1609
02:15:53,395 --> 02:15:54,353
Who is he?

1610
02:15:54,647 --> 02:15:55,647
Who?

1611
02:15:55,898 --> 02:15:57,774
The guy who dropped you off.

1612
02:15:59,235 --> 02:16:00,235
Just a co-worker.

1613
02:16:01,070 --> 02:16:02,529
You think I'm stupid?

1614
02:16:03,219 --> 02:16:04,000
No.

1615
02:16:04,344 --> 02:16:07,283
- Think I didn't see?
- He's a co-worker, I swear.

1616
02:16:07,660 --> 02:16:08,701
I saw him.

1617
02:16:08,911 --> 02:16:10,411
We work together.

1618
02:16:10,579 --> 02:16:13,581
Come see.
He's a co-worker in another class.

1619
02:16:15,422 --> 02:16:17,256
How long have you been
seeing him?

1620
02:16:20,089 --> 02:16:21,339
Since I started there.

1621
02:16:21,590 --> 02:16:22,799
Really?

1622
02:16:25,177 --> 02:16:27,303
- Why are you lying?
- I'm not.

1623
02:16:27,841 --> 02:16:29,258
So why are you crying?

1624
02:16:30,283 --> 02:16:31,659
I'm not crying.

1625
02:16:32,101 --> 02:16:33,643
Then why the tears?

1626
02:16:35,208 --> 02:16:36,541
I'm tired.

1627
02:16:39,441 --> 02:16:42,235
I'm not dumb. How long
have you been sleeping with him?

1628
02:16:43,737 --> 02:16:45,446
I'm not sleeping with him.

1629
02:16:45,948 --> 02:16:48,324
How long have you been
lying to me?

1630
02:16:50,786 --> 02:16:52,620
I'm not sleeping with him.

1631
02:16:57,719 --> 02:16:59,804
We shared a drunken kiss once.

1632
02:17:00,058 --> 02:17:01,517
So why are you crying?

1633
02:17:01,826 --> 02:17:02,867
I regret it.

1634
02:17:03,048 --> 02:17:03,882
I'm not dumb!

1635
02:17:04,049 --> 02:17:05,466
- I swear.
- Don't lie!

1636
02:17:05,634 --> 02:17:06,175
I swear.

1637
02:17:06,343 --> 02:17:07,969
How long have you been
sleeping with him?

1638
02:17:08,637 --> 02:17:10,471
How many times
have you slept with him?

1639
02:17:10,848 --> 02:17:12,056
Tell me!

1640
02:17:12,601 --> 02:17:14,978
How long have you been
lying to me?

1641
02:17:15,117 --> 02:17:18,688
- Since when do you think I'm dumb?
- I've never thought that.

1642
02:17:18,812 --> 02:17:21,149
Get out of here! Get out.

1643
02:17:21,734 --> 02:17:24,903
I don't want a liar here!
Pack your stuff and go.

1644
02:17:25,070 --> 02:17:26,154
Get going.

1645
02:17:28,115 --> 02:17:29,407
Get lost!

1646
02:17:33,370 --> 02:17:36,331
I slept with him two or three times.
I can't remember.

1647
02:17:37,541 --> 02:17:38,499
Two or three times?

1648
02:17:38,667 --> 02:17:42,003
I didn't tell you because...
I don't know...

1649
02:17:42,504 --> 02:17:45,548
I couldn't explain it.
I knew it was stupid.

1650
02:17:47,121 --> 02:17:49,122
I felt so alone.

1651
02:17:52,932 --> 02:17:54,432
Are you in love?

1652
02:17:54,934 --> 02:17:56,184
Of course not!

1653
02:17:56,352 --> 02:17:58,394
I just felt all alone.

1654
02:17:59,521 --> 02:18:01,773
I never meant to hurt you.

1655
02:18:04,985 --> 02:18:06,027
Fuck.

1656
02:18:06,528 --> 02:18:07,695
I'm sorry.

1657
02:18:09,239 --> 02:18:10,782
It's just that...

1658
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:12,700
Fuck this!

1659
02:18:15,412 --> 02:18:17,747
He's nothing, just a colleague.

1660
02:18:17,771 --> 02:18:20,041
It was a stupid mistake.

1661
02:18:26,006 --> 02:18:28,758
I swear I never meant
to hurt you.

1662
02:18:28,884 --> 02:18:30,468
I promise I didn't.

1663
02:18:30,636 --> 02:18:32,136
Adèle, stop.

1664
02:18:32,805 --> 02:18:34,263
Wait.

1665
02:18:34,807 --> 02:18:36,182
You hurt me. It's done.

1666
02:18:37,226 --> 02:18:38,685
No, I swear.

1667
02:18:39,019 --> 02:18:41,437
It wasn't on purpose.
There's no reason.

1668
02:18:41,568 --> 02:18:43,152
You're a little slut.

1669
02:18:44,233 --> 02:18:45,483
Little whore.

1670
02:18:45,693 --> 02:18:47,360
You get fucked, right?

1671
02:18:48,278 --> 02:18:49,821
You like that.

1672
02:18:51,281 --> 02:18:53,574
You suck him off in his car
and then kiss me?

1673
02:18:53,613 --> 02:18:55,243
You dare kiss me?

1674
02:18:56,036 --> 02:18:58,246
You dare touch me
and look at me?

1675
02:18:59,456 --> 02:19:01,250
You do stuff like that?

1676
02:19:01,304 --> 02:19:04,585
And then you lie,
you talk bullshit, you talk crap!

1677
02:19:05,276 --> 02:19:07,088
- I'm sorry.
- You're a slut!

1678
02:19:07,171 --> 02:19:10,078
I don't know
how to ask for forgiveness.

1679
02:19:10,175 --> 02:19:11,500
There is no forgiveness!

1680
02:19:11,570 --> 02:19:14,595
I never want
to see your face again!

1681
02:19:14,888 --> 02:19:17,098
Pack your bags and get out!

1682
02:19:19,372 --> 02:19:20,914
Get out of my life!

1683
02:19:25,274 --> 02:19:27,525
I wouldn't hurt you
for anything.

1684
02:19:27,735 --> 02:19:29,277
Adèle, get out of here.

1685
02:19:29,445 --> 02:19:30,528
Stop it.

1686
02:19:31,488 --> 02:19:33,828
Get out of here now.
Out of my house.

1687
02:19:33,876 --> 02:19:34,759
No.

1688
02:19:34,867 --> 02:19:36,534
Pack up and get out.

1689
02:19:37,202 --> 02:19:40,455
I don't want a slut, a whore!
Pack your stuff!

1690
02:19:40,622 --> 02:19:43,082
Let me talk. He means nothing.

1691
02:19:43,250 --> 02:19:44,208
I won't talk!

1692
02:19:44,334 --> 02:19:46,627
Get the hell out!

1693
02:19:46,754 --> 02:19:49,130
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I did it.

1694
02:19:49,548 --> 02:19:50,673
Take your clothes.

1695
02:19:50,799 --> 02:19:52,216
Let me explain.

1696
02:19:52,282 --> 02:19:53,243
- Let me explain it to you.
- Adèle, I can't.

1697
02:19:53,298 --> 02:19:54,540
Let me explain...

1698
02:19:54,651 --> 02:19:55,568
Get lost!

1699
02:19:55,915 --> 02:19:57,032
Get out of here!

1700
02:19:57,139 --> 02:19:58,764
I never want to see you again!

1701
02:19:58,819 --> 02:20:00,358
I never want to see you again!

1702
02:20:00,434 --> 02:20:03,061
Never again. Get out of my life!

1703
02:20:04,434 --> 02:20:04,942
I don't know...

1704
02:20:04,996 --> 02:20:06,898
Think you're the only one
who suffers?

1705
02:20:08,025 --> 02:20:10,193
It was nothing. Just let me...

1706
02:20:10,319 --> 02:20:12,487
It's too late!

1707
02:20:13,072 --> 02:20:15,219
Take your stuff and get out.

1708
02:20:15,312 --> 02:20:16,953
No sluts here!

1709
02:20:17,046 --> 02:20:17,640
Get out!

1710
02:20:17,743 --> 02:20:19,744
I didn't do anything!

1711
02:20:20,162 --> 02:20:22,080
Stop! I'm not an idiot!

1712
02:20:22,247 --> 02:20:24,582
Don't do this.
Where do I go without you?

1713
02:20:24,750 --> 02:20:26,459
Go see that guy!

1714
02:20:27,169 --> 02:20:29,003
I don't love him!

1715
02:20:29,129 --> 02:20:31,756
It's you I love!
I can't go! What will I do?

1716
02:20:31,924 --> 02:20:34,300
What will I do? I'm begging you!

1717
02:20:34,468 --> 02:20:36,344
Get out! Get out!

1718
02:20:44,895 --> 02:20:46,738
Open the door!

1719
02:20:51,068 --> 02:20:53,277
I'm sorry. Let me talk to you.

1720
02:20:54,207 --> 02:20:55,207
I'm sorry.

1721
02:20:55,239 --> 02:20:56,989
You're just a whore!

1722
02:21:11,630 --> 02:21:13,506
Leave now, Adèle!

1723
02:22:42,638 --> 02:22:44,472
Did you pick these out?

1724
02:22:44,890 --> 02:22:45,932
So pretty.

1725
02:22:46,225 --> 02:22:48,267
I have so many
I can make a garden.

1726
02:22:48,518 --> 02:22:50,728
It's really nice of you.

1727
02:22:50,979 --> 02:22:52,813
I can't even hold them all.

1728
02:22:53,315 --> 02:22:54,941
Bye-bye, Lili Rose.

1729
02:22:55,651 --> 02:22:57,818
That was a great dance you did.

1730
02:22:58,153 --> 02:22:59,737
Bye-bye, Maxence.

1731
02:23:08,305 --> 02:23:10,111
- Enjoy your summer.
- You too. Good bye.

1732
02:23:11,010 --> 02:23:12,065
See you.

1733
02:24:36,376 --> 02:24:37,585
Careful.

1734
02:24:45,177 --> 02:24:47,511
Not in the face or eyes.

1735
02:24:49,931 --> 02:24:52,433
If you get it in her eyes,
no swimming.

1736
02:25:27,427 --> 02:25:29,970
- How's it going?
- Fine.

1737
02:25:33,016 --> 02:25:35,059
Can you watch mine for a minute?

1738
02:25:35,227 --> 02:25:37,103
No problem at all.

1739
02:27:58,954 --> 02:28:01,571
Concentrate on our dictation.

1740
02:28:01,845 --> 02:28:02,728
On your slate...

1741
02:28:02,832 --> 02:28:05,167
No drawing on your table!

1742
02:28:05,335 --> 02:28:07,545
"In the kitchen..."

1743
02:28:08,588 --> 02:28:10,339
Go on. "In the kitchen..."

1744
02:28:12,884 --> 02:28:16,136
"In the kitchen, Mommy..."

1745
02:28:21,643 --> 02:28:23,310
Start with a capital letter.

1746
02:28:24,271 --> 02:28:26,522
"...is peeling...

1747
02:28:30,277 --> 02:28:32,152
"an onion."

1748
02:28:33,530 --> 02:28:34,697
Eyes down.

1749
02:28:36,283 --> 02:28:38,951
No need to talk during dictation.

1750
02:28:39,452 --> 02:28:43,539
"In the kitchen, Mommy
is peeling an onion." Period.

1751
02:28:48,962 --> 02:28:52,298
"Laura is playing the violin."

1752
02:28:58,888 --> 02:29:00,347
- Is there an O?
- Yes.

1753
02:29:00,765 --> 02:29:03,225
What vowel
is in the word "long"?

1754
02:29:03,518 --> 02:29:05,185
Concentrate.

1755
02:29:06,605 --> 02:29:09,565
Say it again for her.

1756
02:29:16,281 --> 02:29:19,366
Shemzeddine, quiet.
You think I enjoy this?

1757
02:29:27,584 --> 02:29:28,802
Ready?

1758
02:29:28,841 --> 02:29:32,046
If we're behind, it's your fault.

1759
02:29:33,506 --> 02:29:34,340
God bless you.

1760
02:29:34,507 --> 02:29:36,925
You're not concentrating.
You're distracted.

1761
02:29:37,093 --> 02:29:39,845
Dictation is taking an hour.

1762
02:29:40,013 --> 02:29:43,682
We could have done it in 15 minutes
and had time for fun.

1763
02:29:45,213 --> 02:29:48,479
Who sees mistakes in her sentence?
Are there any?

1764
02:29:48,730 --> 02:29:52,274
"In kitchen
Mommy is peeling an onion."

1765
02:29:52,442 --> 02:29:54,151
You forgot the word "the".

1766
02:29:54,319 --> 02:29:57,946
It's not a big mistake.
You just weren't paying attention.

1767
02:29:58,948 --> 02:30:02,326
"In the kitchen
Mommy is peeling an onion."

1768
02:30:02,494 --> 02:30:04,078
How did you spell "onion"?

1769
02:30:05,914 --> 02:30:07,665
How did you spell it?

1770
02:30:08,291 --> 02:30:09,333
It's like this.

1771
02:30:12,545 --> 02:30:14,463
Did anyone spell it right?

1772
02:30:15,298 --> 02:30:16,924
- Me.
- Really?

1773
02:30:18,468 --> 02:30:20,636
Who'll write the second sentence?

1774
02:30:20,929 --> 02:30:22,262
Go ahead, Renda.

1775
02:32:03,364 --> 02:32:04,615
How are you doing?

1776
02:32:23,927 --> 02:32:25,677
It's been too long.

1777
02:32:28,056 --> 02:32:29,306
Sit down.

1778
02:32:42,070 --> 02:32:44,738
- Want something to drink?
- Yeah, sure.

1779
02:32:45,990 --> 02:32:47,533
I got a glass of white.

1780
02:32:47,700 --> 02:32:48,575
I see.

1781
02:32:48,743 --> 02:32:50,744
Taste it. I think you'll like it.

1782
02:32:51,746 --> 02:32:52,996
No thanks, I'm okay.

1783
02:32:53,164 --> 02:32:55,290
- Are you sure?
- No, I'm fine.

1784
02:32:55,708 --> 02:32:58,669
I called your stepdad.
He said you'd like it.

1785
02:33:00,672 --> 02:33:02,005
What do you want?

1786
02:33:04,676 --> 02:33:06,176
I'll have a coffee.

1787
02:33:06,453 --> 02:33:08,554
Excuse me. A coffee, please.

1788
02:33:08,610 --> 02:33:10,298
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

1789
02:33:15,436 --> 02:33:16,562
You doing well?

1790
02:33:17,021 --> 02:33:18,939
I am. And you? Are you okay?

1791
02:33:19,428 --> 02:33:20,287
Yeah.

1792
02:33:26,447 --> 02:33:28,031
You have a new hairdo.

1793
02:33:29,033 --> 02:33:29,791
Yeah.

1794
02:33:31,494 --> 02:33:33,495
It makes me look old.

1795
02:33:33,748 --> 02:33:34,748
Not too much.

1796
02:33:35,353 --> 02:33:37,124
You still look as young.

1797
02:33:37,584 --> 02:33:39,710
It's hard to lose these cheeks.

1798
02:33:40,253 --> 02:33:42,296
I wanted to look more ladylike.

1799
02:33:42,463 --> 02:33:46,466
I changed my hair to be taken
seriously. But apparently...

1800
02:33:46,759 --> 02:33:47,718
I was wrong.

1801
02:33:48,001 --> 02:33:48,751
No.

1802
02:33:50,638 --> 02:33:51,763
It looks good.

1803
02:33:52,390 --> 02:33:54,975
You know,
it happens faster than you think.

1804
02:33:55,602 --> 02:33:56,727
Really?

1805
02:33:59,290 --> 02:34:00,321
Thank you.

1806
02:34:02,650 --> 02:34:05,652
I've never met anyone
who wanted to look older.

1807
02:34:08,197 --> 02:34:10,365
And you? What about your shows and stuff?

1808
02:34:10,533 --> 02:34:12,034
Is all that going well?

1809
02:34:12,201 --> 02:34:13,201
It's fine.

1810
02:34:14,162 --> 02:34:15,329
It's all fine.

1811
02:34:17,057 --> 02:34:17,974
Tell me.

1812
02:34:18,041 --> 02:34:19,416
It's a little...

1813
02:34:20,335 --> 02:34:22,753
a little complicated to organize.

1814
02:34:22,962 --> 02:34:25,005
Press, journalists.

1815
02:34:25,609 --> 02:34:26,796
The price of success.

1816
02:34:26,874 --> 02:34:29,509
I see what your fans write
on your site.

1817
02:34:29,761 --> 02:34:31,386
Bunch of dykes.

1818
02:34:32,847 --> 02:34:34,598
Hey, you asked for it.

1819
02:34:41,022 --> 02:34:43,065
I saw your latest paintings.

1820
02:34:43,232 --> 02:34:44,358
Really?

1821
02:34:45,485 --> 02:34:48,111
You blow me away.
It's new, yet it's still you.

1822
02:34:48,169 --> 02:34:50,671
I'm lousy at explaining it.

1823
02:34:51,505 --> 02:34:53,867
I'll buy one
once I have some money.

1824
02:34:54,077 --> 02:34:56,286
Come on, I'll give you one.

1825
02:34:57,358 --> 02:34:58,817
I'll pay you.

1826
02:34:58,874 --> 02:34:59,640
No you're not.

1827
02:34:59,791 --> 02:35:00,999
Yes.

1828
02:35:01,334 --> 02:35:02,709
It's important for me.

1829
02:35:02,877 --> 02:35:05,253
I can pay in flesh and blood.

1830
02:35:11,052 --> 02:35:13,137
It was a joke. A bad joke...

1831
02:35:13,169 --> 02:35:14,294
but a joke.

1832
02:35:15,014 --> 02:35:16,223
It was funny.

1833
02:35:18,893 --> 02:35:20,727
And you're doing well?

1834
02:35:21,646 --> 02:35:23,230
Still with my kids.

1835
02:35:23,606 --> 02:35:25,857
I have first-graders now. Older.

1836
02:35:27,026 --> 02:35:28,568
I'm a beginner, but...

1837
02:35:29,112 --> 02:35:32,072
it's great.
Them too, with their ABCs.

1838
02:35:33,408 --> 02:35:38,036
During school break, I have a support
group for the ones with problems.

1839
02:35:38,371 --> 02:35:39,705
They're my favourites.

1840
02:35:40,123 --> 02:35:41,915
Very special cases, but...

1841
02:35:42,281 --> 02:35:43,656
they're magical.

1842
02:35:44,377 --> 02:35:46,378
So gratifying when you can help.

1843
02:35:47,630 --> 02:35:48,880
I'm having a blast.

1844
02:35:48,976 --> 02:35:52,217
They put me to the test,
push my limits.

1845
02:35:52,343 --> 02:35:54,261
But it's fascinating.

1846
02:35:54,429 --> 02:35:55,887
It's what you wanted.

1847
02:35:56,694 --> 02:35:58,028
Yeah, I think.

1848
02:36:02,103 --> 02:36:03,145
That's good.

1849
02:36:03,312 --> 02:36:04,521
Yeah, it's great.

1850
02:36:04,563 --> 02:36:07,648
But time-consuming.
I have no time for myself.

1851
02:36:08,192 --> 02:36:09,526
You don't go out?

1852
02:36:09,603 --> 02:36:11,903
I do, but with other teachers.

1853
02:36:12,321 --> 02:36:14,948
Nightclubs,
Vieux-Lille, restaurants.

1854
02:36:15,908 --> 02:36:17,075
But...

1855
02:36:18,661 --> 02:36:20,454
I often go home alone.

1856
02:36:20,955 --> 02:36:22,539
I mean, I'm all alone.

1857
02:36:25,032 --> 02:36:26,866
And no boyfriend?

1858
02:36:27,923 --> 02:36:28,814
No?

1859
02:36:29,964 --> 02:36:31,214
Girlfriend?

1860
02:36:35,509 --> 02:36:36,306
No.

1861
02:36:36,345 --> 02:36:38,388
I had some stupid flings, but...

1862
02:36:38,890 --> 02:36:40,098
nothing concrete.

1863
02:36:40,169 --> 02:36:42,170
Anyway, I have a hard time

1864
02:36:42,414 --> 02:36:43,914
getting attached.

1865
02:36:45,938 --> 02:36:47,814
I can understand.

1866
02:36:47,982 --> 02:36:50,150
It's not easy to be a couple.

1867
02:36:53,446 --> 02:36:56,448
You still with the girl
who was at our place?

1868
02:36:56,616 --> 02:36:57,657
Lise?

1869
02:37:02,622 --> 02:37:03,830
You happy?

1870
02:37:05,166 --> 02:37:06,374
Yeah.

1871
02:37:09,754 --> 02:37:11,338
That's good, then.

1872
02:37:14,258 --> 02:37:15,467
Is she nice?

1873
02:37:15,635 --> 02:37:17,135
Yeah, she's nice.

1874
02:37:17,269 --> 02:37:21,848
I can see her cooking for you
when you get home at night,

1875
02:37:22,016 --> 02:37:24,184
giving you flowers
in the morning.

1876
02:37:24,352 --> 02:37:25,769
That's her style.

1877
02:37:27,313 --> 02:37:29,773
It's especially the kid, Aude...

1878
02:37:30,191 --> 02:37:31,448
that I like a lot.

1879
02:37:31,495 --> 02:37:33,193
Yeah, she has a kid.

1880
02:37:33,361 --> 02:37:34,861
She was very pregnant.

1881
02:37:36,030 --> 02:37:37,948
- How old is she?
- Three.

1882
02:37:38,658 --> 02:37:41,701
I like her a lot. She's funny.
We get along great.

1883
02:37:42,036 --> 02:37:44,037
We clown around together.

1884
02:37:44,629 --> 02:37:46,206
I teach her a lot.

1885
02:37:47,043 --> 02:37:48,582
And Lise yells at us.

1886
02:37:48,606 --> 02:37:50,210
No way.

1887
02:37:51,045 --> 02:37:53,213
Two kids in the house is a lot.

1888
02:37:58,886 --> 02:38:00,762
It's my family.

1889
02:38:17,488 --> 02:38:18,905
And sexually?

1890
02:38:20,741 --> 02:38:21,992
Do you enjoy it?

1891
02:38:28,499 --> 02:38:29,583
It's...

1892
02:38:32,461 --> 02:38:33,461
Lousy?

1893
02:38:34,213 --> 02:38:36,256
It's not lousy, but it's...

1894
02:38:37,508 --> 02:38:38,717
It's boring.

1895
02:38:40,261 --> 02:38:42,429
I don't know, Adèle.

1896
02:38:43,931 --> 02:38:45,682
It's not like with you.

1897
02:38:57,320 --> 02:38:58,695
I miss you.

1898
02:39:01,949 --> 02:39:03,950
I miss touching each other,

1899
02:39:04,285 --> 02:39:07,287
seeing each other,
breathing in each other's scent.

1900
02:39:19,300 --> 02:39:20,926
I want you.

1901
02:39:21,510 --> 02:39:22,844
All the time.

1902
02:39:24,096 --> 02:39:25,931
No one else.

1903
02:39:30,311 --> 02:39:31,770
I miss everything.

1904
02:39:32,313 --> 02:39:34,940
But I have to say,
I miss this a lot.

1905
02:39:43,366 --> 02:39:44,950
Let me touch you.

1906
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:10,517
Stop.

1907
02:40:10,643 --> 02:40:13,687
Don't say you don't want to.
I don't believe it.

1908
02:40:15,022 --> 02:40:16,815
I know you miss it too.

1909
02:40:22,029 --> 02:40:23,029
Touch.

1910
02:40:59,692 --> 02:41:00,775
Stop it.

1911
02:41:39,565 --> 02:41:41,024
I can't.

1912
02:41:46,364 --> 02:41:48,198
Forgive me. I don't know.

1913
02:41:48,866 --> 02:41:50,116
I don't know.

1914
02:41:53,579 --> 02:41:55,288
It's beyond my control.

1915
02:41:57,249 --> 02:41:58,792
You're forgiven.

1916
02:42:00,878 --> 02:42:02,754
You won't see me anymore?

1917
02:42:07,968 --> 02:42:09,052
No.

1918
02:42:20,940 --> 02:42:22,565
You haven't forgiven me.

1919
02:42:23,651 --> 02:42:25,443
Yes, I have.

1920
02:42:33,994 --> 02:42:35,703
You don't love me anymore.

1921
02:42:58,352 --> 02:42:59,727
Are you sure?

1922
02:43:01,981 --> 02:43:03,189
Yes.

1923
02:43:10,698 --> 02:43:12,699
I'm with someone else now.

1924
02:43:16,704 --> 02:43:18,079
You know that.

1925
02:43:26,213 --> 02:43:28,840
But I feel an infinite
tenderness for you.

1926
02:43:31,760 --> 02:43:33,136
I always will.

1927
02:43:34,346 --> 02:43:36,055
My whole life.

1928
02:44:00,247 --> 02:44:01,748
I'm sorry.

1929
02:44:03,042 --> 02:44:04,626
You know me.

1930
02:44:08,047 --> 02:44:10,089
Sometimes I cry for no reason.

1931
02:44:10,508 --> 02:44:12,550
Yeah, I know you
pretty damn well.

1932
02:44:18,307 --> 02:44:20,433
Happens to me every time.

1933
02:44:21,393 --> 02:44:22,519
I know.

1934
02:44:22,811 --> 02:44:24,646
You're always blubbering.

1935
02:44:29,610 --> 02:44:31,611
Leave whenever you want.

1936
02:44:31,779 --> 02:44:33,321
Yeah, right.

1937
02:44:34,657 --> 02:44:36,032
No, really.

1938
02:44:37,952 --> 02:44:39,702
I won't bother you again.

1939
02:44:41,997 --> 02:44:43,790
You're not bothering me.

1940
02:44:46,502 --> 02:44:47,794
Okay, I'm going.

1941
02:45:11,664 --> 02:45:12,873
Get going.

1942
02:45:14,280 --> 02:45:16,114
Go on, beat it.

1943
02:46:36,945 --> 02:46:39,405
Alexandre, wake up.
You just got here.

"No Need" by Alain Bosquet.

1945
02:46:53,754 --> 02:46:55,171
Take your time.

1946
02:46:55,339 --> 02:46:58,966
What's the hurry?
Pronounce so we all understand.

02:47:13,307 --> 02:47:14,174
Stop.

1952
02:47:14,233 --> 02:47:16,567
Adam, can you continue?

1953
02:47:17,528 --> 02:47:19,153

How are you?

1972
02:49:30,234 --> 02:49:31,539
I'm great, Adèle.

1973
02:49:32,164 --> 02:49:33,648
- How are you?
- You're Myrième.

1974
02:49:33,705 --> 02:49:36,499
Myrième, exactly.
I haven't seen you in ages.

1975
02:49:37,584 --> 02:49:41,337
What a pretty dress.
I love the colour blue.

1976
02:49:41,880 --> 02:49:43,089
Thanks. That's nice of you.

1977
02:49:43,215 --> 02:49:44,507
Can I ask you something?

1978
02:49:44,675 --> 02:49:47,593
My nephew, Nicolas Rouillard.
Ring a bell?

1979
02:49:47,803 --> 02:49:50,638
He said his teacher
was named Adèle. You?

1980
02:49:51,056 --> 02:49:53,224
Seriously. What's he like?

1981
02:49:53,392 --> 02:49:54,642
Adorable.

1982
02:49:54,767 --> 02:49:56,185
My sister's son.

1983
02:49:56,311 --> 02:49:59,397
I wanted you to give me
the scoop on him.

1984
02:49:59,523 --> 02:50:00,398
How funny.

1985
02:50:00,524 --> 02:50:02,859
Is he a good worker? Really?

1986
02:50:03,193 --> 02:50:04,277
A sweetheart.

1987
02:50:04,560 --> 02:50:05,529
Cool.

1988
02:50:06,435 --> 02:50:09,866
I'm going to go mingle.
We'll talk later.

1989
02:50:10,033 --> 02:50:11,284
- See you.
- Ciao.

1990
02:50:12,264 --> 02:50:13,998
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1991
02:50:14,246 --> 02:50:15,329
And you?

1992
02:50:16,081 --> 02:50:17,707
How did you get here?

1993
02:50:17,764 --> 02:50:19,458
By foot. I live nearby.

1994
02:50:20,794 --> 02:50:22,128
Nice neighbourhood.

1995
02:50:25,108 --> 02:50:25,997
Welcome.

1996
02:50:26,028 --> 02:50:27,005
Yeah thanks.

1997
02:50:27,050 --> 02:50:28,301
Thanks for inviting me.

1998
02:50:29,303 --> 02:50:30,469
It's normal.

1999
02:50:31,013 --> 02:50:34,223
- So here are my paintings.
- Okay.

2000
02:50:34,725 --> 02:50:38,019
And behind you is a painter
named Adé Bernard.

2001
02:50:38,145 --> 02:50:39,145
Okay.

2002
02:50:42,107 --> 02:50:43,816
That one is awesome.

2003
02:50:45,652 --> 02:50:46,861
It's amazing.

2004
02:50:47,029 --> 02:50:47,945
Really.

2005
02:50:48,353 --> 02:50:49,937
Everything.

2006
02:50:52,826 --> 02:50:54,827
Hello. How are you?

2007
02:50:55,579 --> 02:50:56,913
Remember me?

2008
02:50:57,372 --> 02:51:00,333
We love it,
but we have a few questions.

2009
02:51:00,500 --> 02:51:02,335
That's why I'm here.

2010
02:51:03,170 --> 02:51:04,295
Excuse me.

2011
02:51:05,005 --> 02:51:07,924
I see old Emma, new Emma,
blue and red.

2012
02:51:08,091 --> 02:51:09,300
The life bearer.

2013
02:51:09,843 --> 02:51:11,761
She seems totally at peace,

2014
02:51:11,970 --> 02:51:16,265
yet there's something
troubling in her eyes.

2015
02:51:16,934 --> 02:51:20,879
I like it. I was wondering
what she's thinking.

2016
02:51:21,855 --> 02:51:24,523
There's an incipient
happiness, but also

2017
02:51:24,691 --> 02:51:26,067
a lot of anguish.

2018
02:51:27,152 --> 02:51:30,404
Her gaze is absent,
yet it seems to beckon us

2019
02:51:30,781 --> 02:51:32,406
amid all the colours.

2020
02:51:32,699 --> 02:51:33,699
I'll be right back.

2021
02:51:33,800 --> 02:51:35,368
We'll talk afterwards.

2022
02:51:35,667 --> 02:51:37,620
Sarah went to Beaux Arts too.

2023
02:51:38,997 --> 02:51:40,706
I love what you do.

2024
02:51:40,874 --> 02:51:44,627
I feel a passion, a movement...

2025
02:51:45,087 --> 02:51:46,504
in the lines.

2026
02:51:46,713 --> 02:51:48,047
Too much talk.

2027
02:51:48,215 --> 02:51:50,007
What a pick-up artist.

2028
02:51:55,222 --> 02:51:56,514
It's nice to see you.

2029
02:51:57,057 --> 02:51:58,516
How do you like it?

2030
02:51:58,675 --> 02:51:59,769
It's...

2031
02:52:00,435 --> 02:52:01,978
It's breathtaking.

2032
02:52:02,229 --> 02:52:04,397
And Joachim's showing her work.

2033
02:52:04,523 --> 02:52:08,067
When I got the invitation,
I thought of you both.

2034
02:52:08,360 --> 02:52:10,027
She really wanted it.

2035
02:52:11,905 --> 02:52:13,447
It was perfect timing.

2036
02:52:13,824 --> 02:52:15,074
It's really good.

2037
02:52:17,953 --> 02:52:20,204
And you see... you're still here.

2038
02:52:26,628 --> 02:52:28,379
It's nice to see.

2039
02:52:29,182 --> 02:52:29,933
Okay.

2040
02:52:30,757 --> 02:52:31,716
See you later.

2041
02:52:31,842 --> 02:52:33,050
Sure thing.

2042
02:52:51,049 --> 02:52:52,018
Hi.

2043
02:53:07,127 --> 02:53:08,294
You doing okay?

2044
02:54:00,376 --> 02:54:02,329
- Enjoying yourself?
- Yeah, it's all right.

2045
02:54:03,563 --> 02:54:04,850
- How are you?
- And you?

2046
02:54:05,018 --> 02:54:06,102
Yeah, great.

2047
02:54:06,751 --> 02:54:07,918
Good to see you.

2048
02:54:08,031 --> 02:54:09,031
Same here.

2049
02:54:12,109 --> 02:54:14,193
Are you still in movies?

2050
02:54:14,986 --> 02:54:16,320
Real estate now.

2051
02:54:17,572 --> 02:54:20,533
I'm still doing movies,
but very little.

2052
02:54:20,892 --> 02:54:24,703
I was sick of...
rubbing everyone the right way.

2053
02:54:24,871 --> 02:54:26,705
Ball-busting directors.

2054
02:54:27,874 --> 02:54:28,749
It was a pain.

2055
02:54:28,959 --> 02:54:31,252
Better to be a hypocritical salesman.

2056
02:54:32,838 --> 02:54:34,046
Like the show?

2057
02:54:34,589 --> 02:54:37,383
Not bad.
It's not really my thing.

2058
02:54:40,512 --> 02:54:42,221
You're still as beautiful.

2059
02:54:43,097 --> 02:54:44,055
Think so?

2060
02:54:44,082 --> 02:54:45,391
Even in real life.

2061
02:54:47,853 --> 02:54:49,770
That makes you laugh?

2062
02:54:50,063 --> 02:54:51,897
At least you're smiling again.

2063
02:54:55,328 --> 02:54:58,195
It's not that hard seeing Emma?

2064
02:54:58,485 --> 02:55:00,739
No, things are settled between us.

2065
02:55:00,907 --> 02:55:02,533
As long as they're settled.

2066
02:55:07,407 --> 02:55:08,141
So...

2067
02:55:08,498 --> 02:55:10,249
You ever get to New York?

2068
02:55:11,585 --> 02:55:12,793
Not yet.

2069
02:55:13,378 --> 02:55:14,753
Travelling opens your mind.

2070
02:55:15,589 --> 02:55:17,089
Yeah, I know.

2071
02:55:18,758 --> 02:55:20,176
Let me steal him for a minute.

2072
02:55:20,343 --> 02:55:21,969
- Come on.
- One sec.

2073
02:55:43,037 --> 02:55:44,287
It was great.

2074
02:55:44,623 --> 02:55:45,912
Thank you very much.

2075
02:55:52,375 --> 02:55:53,959
I saw you in a movie.

2076
02:55:54,127 --> 02:55:56,128
- Acting suited you.
- Really?
