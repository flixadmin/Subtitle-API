1
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:03,254
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,421 --> 00:00:04,881
- Lyla.
- We need to talk about John.

3
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:06,849
He's back in the country.
And he's in prison.

4
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,009
We are gonna break him out.

5
00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:09,177
Hey, John.

6
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:10,946
I'm not saying you shouldn't do
your penance.

7
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:11,971
But do it as Spartan.

8
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:15,099
Church is planning something.
Something big.

9
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:16,506
You're talking about the Trust.

10
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,939
At least we definitely know
where Church is now.

11
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:20,104
We gotta put him down.

12
00:00:20,313 --> 00:00:21,564
Go. Do not die.

13
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:25,526
- Get him to safety.
- But...

14
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:26,861
Go!

15
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:30,948
Don't kill him. He may have his uses.

16
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:33,201
We are not gonna write off Rene.

17
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,204
We're gonna find him.
We're gonna bring him back.

18
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,371
Wherever he is.

19
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:50,509
The Trust goes
to the Brace, 04 in 72.

20
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,475
How you feeling, my friend?

21
00:00:57,642 --> 00:00:59,602
You can keep
going with the foreplay,

22
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:01,646
but I'm never giving you what you want.

23
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,565
You remind me of this other guy
I once tortured.

24
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:08,402
Maybe bigger,
a little more muscle on the frame.

25
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:16,327
Look, I was conversing
with this son of a bitch

26
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,666
just like you and I have been
conversing for the past...

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,752
What, 20 hours or so?

28
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,004
My knuckles hurt.

29
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:31,175
Even with the brass. I needed a shower.

30
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:33,344
My lady was waiting for me.

31
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:37,223
And this guy
would just not give me what I needed.

32
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:38,891
Not unlike you.

33
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:43,020
So I said to myself, "Tobias,

34
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,233
"make this guy feel pain
like nobody who's ever lived."

35
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:50,194
And then it clicked.

36
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,283
It's not the pain that breaks people.

37
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:57,868
It's fear.

38
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:00,830
Fear of that pain.

39
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:03,916
Of what that pain brings.

40
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:07,044
Of what happens next.

41
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:11,507
You not gonna finish your story?

42
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:12,883
Huh?

43
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:14,135
Oh.

44
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:16,929
I got what I wanted from that guy.

45
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:24,603
So you might wanna think about that
the next time I ask you a question.

46
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:31,694
Tobias Church. Where is he?

47
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,071
Don't know. Even if I did,

48
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,407
whatever you're gonna do to me,
he's worse.

49
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:40,119
How sure are you about that?

50
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:45,833
Ahh!

51
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,587
Hey, you're a lot cuter
than the green guy.

52
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:53,174
Aww, you're kind of cute, too, in a
"I feel sorry for you" kind of way.

53
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:56,010
- Where's Church?
- Yeah, who wants to know?

54
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,511
The green guy.

55
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,722
Where is Church?

56
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,057
Look out!

57
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,692
You okay?

58
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,194
I'm better than this schmuck.

59
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:16,280
Church. Address. Now.

60
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:19,241
I heard he's somewhere northwest of here,
maybe by the water.

61
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,701
Half the city's on the water.

62
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,078
I swear, that's all I know.

63
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:34,090
Come on.

64
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,300
How's it going?

65
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:39,720
I would punch this monitor
if I didn't know how much it cost.

66
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,972
Also, it'd probably really hurt.

67
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:43,867
Can you get off your feet, please?

68
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,559
Oliver told me that you were back to work

69
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,561
a week after you were shot
by the Clock King.

70
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:49,814
Shot in the shoulder.
Not a knife in the back.

71
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,180
I don't need you to remind me.

72
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,067
I have excruciating agony to do that.

73
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,280
Who's that?

74
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,532
Hmm? Telemarketer.

75
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:03,595
Tell me you've had better luck
than I have had.

76
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:06,179
We might have narrowed it down
to the northwest part of the city.

77
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:09,047
Yeah, so now we're looking for a needle
in a slightly smaller haystack.

78
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:12,503
I'll run an algorithm cross-referencing
traffic cams with probable locations.

79
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,214
Wow. This place just got really crowded.

80
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:17,508
Hey.

81
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:20,344
Do people just walk into
your secret base of operations?

82
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:21,512
- Yes.
- Yes.

83
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,389
- This is...
- Spartan.

84
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:24,598
I'm guessing.

85
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,392
You guys must the new kids on the block.

86
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:28,936
We're more like the Backstreet Boys.

87
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:30,855
It was funny in my head.

88
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,023
This is Rory Regan and Evelyn Sharp.

89
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,860
John Diggle. And you are missing a man.

90
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,027
Rene Ramirez.

91
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:40,173
Lyla called in A.R.G.U.S. for the search.
Unfortunately, she's turned up nothing.

92
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,240
It's going around.

93
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:44,452
We are going to find Rene,
and we're not gonna give up hope

94
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,619
while we're doing it.

95
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,790
I have an early meeting at City Hall,
I will check in with everybody soon.

96
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:55,671
Is it just my imagination,
or did Oliver just seem...

97
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,091
Optimistic. That's not usually a word
I'd associate with his demeanor.

98
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:04,805
- Thank you.
- Rene?

99
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,602
- Slow.
- What about the ACU?

100
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,420
Too many cops on Church's dime
keeping him five steps ahead.

101
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,399
And with Conahan gone
and Church's assault on the ACU,

102
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,210
I'm thinking we gotta bring
more men into the fold.

103
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,962
Well, do we have enough guys
that we can trust?

104
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:22,239
Pike says that a bunch of his men
have volunteered since the attack on ACU.

105
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,009
So, if you want, I can vet 'em,
and I could,

106
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,260
you know,
make sure there's no bad apples.

107
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,577
Please. Let's get that done.

108
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:29,097
Look, I know
this is one of the last things

109
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:32,161
you wanna be dealing with right now,
but the re-zoning vote is in a few days.

110
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:36,253
Allowing us to expand
low-income housing in Orchid Bay?

111
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,421
Yeah, yeah.

112
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,357
Okay, well, we need
a four-fifths majority vote

113
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,234
from City Council in order to pass
the ordinance and...

114
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,259
Who are the hold-outs?

115
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,929
Only one that really matters.
Councilman Kullens.

116
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,431
Yeah, he is decidedly anti-residential.

117
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:50,100
I was gonna say,
he's the most stubborn man in the city

118
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,811
compared to you, but that works.

119
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,231
Let's get into it.

120
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:02,279
Anatoly, what is this?

121
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,281
It is time, my friend.

122
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:20,172
English will suffice, Viktor.

123
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:22,716
Fine.

124
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:28,180
What does Bratva mean to you,
Oliver Queen?

125
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:29,932
Brotherhood.

126
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,851
Brotherhood is family.

127
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:34,770
Who are yours?

128
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,230
My father is dead.

129
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,817
- My mother and sister...
- Both dead.

130
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,737
Bratva only know their brothers.

131
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:46,978
Do you know what I mean by this?

132
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,160
I have no family.

133
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:54,290
I have no home. I have no name.

134
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:25,195
We're at the latest probable, Overwatch,
but it's another dead end.

135
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,864
Try not to use that phrase.

136
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:29,617
Look.

137
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,702
- Is that...
- Blood? Looks like.

138
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,747
Scratch that. We think this is where
Rene was being held.

139
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,113
- "Was"?
- Blood's still fresh.

140
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,326
They must've just moved him.

141
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,377
KH-Ten shows a panel van moving
from that location 40 minutes ago.

142
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:41,587
Can you track it?

143
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:44,548
I have been able to every other time
somebody asked me that question.

144
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,134
- Got it.
- Where?

145
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,219
This is a little awkward,

146
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,032
but Oliver made me promise that if we got
our location on Rene,

147
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:53,557
I would only share it with him.

148
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,560
That's actually not surprising at all.

149
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,855
Lest I forget.

150
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,399
So you can pay the ferry.

151
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,362
Why, man?

152
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,113
'Cause you pissed me off.

153
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,574
No. Why this city?

154
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,534
Why come here?

155
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,995
And why are you asking me that now?

156
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,540
'Cause, if I'm gonna die tonight,
it'd be nice to know why.

157
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:23,420
From what I heard, you were popping
in Blidhaven, in Hub City.

158
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,673
Why you messing with us?

159
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,594
For your water access.

160
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,639
Seriously.

161
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,184
Through Star City's docks.

162
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:42,231
I can move thousands of tons of heroin,
Slam, Vertigo.

163
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:46,777
I'm working on the biggest
consolidation of drug enterprises

164
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,696
anybody has ever seen.

165
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:50,698
Only thing I'm waiting for

166
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,783
is for Green Arrow
to get out of the picture.

167
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,454
Little man,
that grave ain't gonna dig itself.

168
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,709
So how about you do the digging yourself?

169
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,169
Oh, you think I'm afraid
to get my hands dirty, huh?

170
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:32,197
Hey, you okay?

171
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,832
I thought Church would put up
more of a fight.

172
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,162
Probably realized he didn't have to.

173
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:39,997
What do you mean?

174
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,125
I was hurting so bad

175
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,335
it got so I couldn't even see straight.

176
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,358
I barely even remember telling him...

177
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:49,506
Telling him what?

178
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,509
Who you are.

179
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,346
He knows you're Oliver Queen.

180
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,497
I should've been out there
with you tonight, Oliver.

181
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,841
Digg, you said you needed time.
Don't be afraid to take it.

182
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,026
And tonight
would not have made any difference.

183
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:10,879
Church didn't want to fight.
He wanted to run.

184
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:12,881
That's because he knows killing the Mayor
is a lot easier

185
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:14,114
than killing the Green Arrow.

186
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,825
What? We were all thinking it.

187
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,119
I told Rene to stand down and recover.

188
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,371
Evelyn and Rory are going to watch
Thea and Quentin

189
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,750
in case Church tries to get at me
through them. How's Curtis doing?

190
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,311
He says he wants to get back at it.

191
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,504
Then let's get him on Lyla and J.J.

192
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,367
Good. I'll have Felicity's back.

193
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,025
Oliver, I know you have a security detail,

194
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,027
but you might as well have a bulls-eye
painted on your head.

195
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,135
I can't disappear again.

196
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,988
I'm still dealing with the
fallout from not being around

197
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,052
when the ACU was attacked.

198
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,183
And there is actually a re-zoning vote
that needs my attention.

199
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,578
What? Wait. Doesn't a vote
take a backseat to finding Church

200
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,288
before he tells every criminal in the city
who you are?

201
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,897
I have security, I'll be fine.

202
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:51,026
Have you ever... Has he ever actually
said that and it turned out to be true?

203
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:52,903
You agree with her?

204
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,924
Well, I know I said I thought it was
a good idea for us to start a new team,

205
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:57,908
but what do we have?
A Laurel Lance wannabe,

206
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,036
a weird rag-guy, a lunatic and Curtis.

207
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:02,788
Curtis just wasn't who I pictured.

208
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,040
They have potential.

209
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,488
One of them got themselves captured
and gave up your name.

210
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,586
- And I'd like you to debrief him.
- Debrief him?

211
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,397
Church told Rene
that he's planning something.

212
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,141
Something big enough
to involve five cities.

213
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,092
So Church just gave up his master plan?

214
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,339
He thought Rene was gonna be dead
five minutes later.

215
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,430
Church is trying to consolidate
the drug trade through Star City,

216
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:24,142
but he was waiting for the Green Arrow
to be gone before he made his move.

217
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,270
Okay. Well, if that's true,

218
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,206
I think I know a way we can turn
this to our advantage.

219
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,231
I'm all ears.

220
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,567
Oliver, I know a guy.
Very specific skill set.

221
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,652
I think he could be here in 24 hours.

222
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:35,988
Did you get my message?

223
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,156
Yeah. Quentin and I
can take care of ourselves.

224
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,677
Still doesn't hurt to have a shadow.
Is Councilman Kullens in there?

225
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,537
Yes. He is waiting in your office
with Susan Williams.

226
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,624
Thank you very much, fellas.
I didn't agree to an interview.

227
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,043
Yeah, well, she's shadowing him
for some type of profile.

228
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,504
And I already tried to get her kicked out,

229
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,132
but he was adamant
about having her in there.

230
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,341
Any advice?

231
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,926
Don't screw it up.

232
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,390
Councilman Kullens, hi.

233
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,934
Miss Williams,
it's a pleasure to finally meet you.

234
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,687
Really? Have you watched any of my pieces?

235
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:12,107
I have, and I think you're off the mark.
In certain instances.

236
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,275
Is that on the record?

237
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,322
If you wanna get an actual quote,
Miss Williams,

238
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,279
you can go through
all the proper channels.

239
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,990
This meeting is strictly
about the re-zoning ordinance.

240
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:23,535
Yes. Councilman, as you know,
I ran on a platform of unity,

241
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,662
but it is difficult
for a city to be united

242
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,624
when so much of the zoning within it
remains exclusionary.

243
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,336
We need to open it up.
Allow for more affordable housing,

244
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,672
give the people the chance
to start over and rebuild.

245
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,926
The second the money starts rolling in,
those families get squeezed out.

246
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,344
By crony capitalists.

247
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,696
That's not going to happen here.

248
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,889
Hard to believe,
considering your family's history.

249
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,950
I'm sorry, Councilman. I don't follow.

250
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,809
Well, the type of re-zoning
you're proposing

251
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,853
happened downtown 25 years ago.

252
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:54,024
But instead of affordable housing,
we got sky-rises.

253
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:58,403
One of them became
the offices of Queen Consolidated.

254
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:01,156
Is that true, Mr. Mayor?

255
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,493
I'll consider that a "no comment."

256
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:08,205
I can tell, you have good intentions.

257
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,874
But politics is the art of the real.

258
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,835
I'm sorry. I'm not changing my vote.

259
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,888
Okay, maybe
you should just put an arrow in him.

260
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:29,393
That was a bit more than I expected
to get done on my lunch break.

261
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,521
Is this a normal Wednesday
afternoon for you?

262
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:35,524
Well, I had to make up for last night.
I hate canceling last minute.

263
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:39,653
I got a feeling I'm gonna be
the one canceling on you for a change.

264
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,072
I got a promotion.

265
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,116
I signed on with the ACU.

266
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:46,410
Oliver's Anti-Crime Unit?

267
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,745
This isn't gonna be weird, right?

268
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,790
- Hmm?
- Me reporting to your ex-fiancé?

269
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,917
Yeah, what could possibly
be weird about that?

270
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,086
- Felicity?
- Mmm-hmm.

271
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:58,296
Does Mayor Queen
know that we're seeing each other?

272
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,400
It really doesn't help if you call him
"Mayor Queen."

273
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:01,425
Felicity...

274
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,094
Definitely. Yeah, he's definitely...

275
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,388
Definitely aware of you.

276
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,599
Love what you've
done with the place.

277
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,520
It's not much, man, but it's home.

278
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:18,191
And it's safe, especially
now that Felicity's teched up the place.

279
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,526
Thanks for coming out.

280
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,533
No problem, man.
Let's just get this over with.

281
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:22,779
But I gotta tell you.

282
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,666
There's nothing you could tell me
that I haven't already told myself.

283
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:27,492
I'm torn apart over this.

284
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,339
Is that what you think this is? A lecture?

285
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,288
What I deserve is a beat-down.

286
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,380
When's the last time
you looked in the mirror?

287
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,269
But maybe something good
can come out of this, man.

288
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:40,297
Like, I don't know,
maybe you saw something,

289
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,883
heard something
that can help us bring down Church.

290
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:45,385
I already told Oliver
everything I remember, man.

291
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,595
I know,

292
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:49,442
but traumatic events have a way
of doing funny things to the memory.

293
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:53,393
And if you think what you went through
was not traumatic, again I say, mirror.

294
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,120
My dad taught me how to take a beating.

295
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,647
I know, Rene. You're tough.
I get that, man.

296
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,562
But this isn't about being tough, okay?
It's about...

297
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,614
Look, man, I've been where you are, okay?

298
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:07,781
And I know it's not easy,
but if we talk about this

299
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,284
and go through it step by step...

300
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:11,078
Look, I said I don't know.

301
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,484
I should be out there trying to fix this.
Not in here with you, playing therapist.

302
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,334
- Oliver says stay put.
- And I'm staying put.

303
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,923
But I don't remember anything.

304
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,678
Yeah, yeah, sure.

305
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,640
Just make sure the AmerTek gear
gets to the Brace.

306
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:34,184
I want everybody locked and loaded.

307
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,186
No, he's not gonna be a problem.

308
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,688
The Green Arrow'll be dead by then.

309
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:43,652
Louis, I'm gonna need to hit you back.

310
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:50,033
You like this place?
I'm getting a penthouse built.

311
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,993
Gonna let me see the whole city.

312
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,496
I told you to stay away
from the Green Arrow.

313
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:58,250
I don't work for you.
And the Green Arrow found me.

314
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,210
You kidnapped his protégé.

315
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:03,046
A serendipitous encounter.

316
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,548
And your last.

317
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,388
After getting threatened by a freak,
I hired one of my own.

318
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:15,767
This was your second warning.
There won't be a third.

319
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,189
I thought you hired me
to kill the Green Arrow.

320
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:24,651
Nope. You're gonna kill the Mayor.

321
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,671
What is Susan Williams
doing in your office?

322
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,872
I agreed to an off-camera interview.

323
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,832
Okay, come here.

324
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:45,589
Okay. So, did you go out last night
as the Green Arrow and get hit

325
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,048
really hard, in the head?

326
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,675
Susan Williams is in our lives.

327
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,562
Thea, if we don't make her an ally,
then she's gonna remain an enemy.

328
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,138
Okay, but she's poison.

329
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:55,950
Well, it turns out that if you ingest
small amounts of poison over time,

330
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,517
you can develop an immunity.

331
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:01,938
Good morning.

332
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:03,512
When I got your call last night

333
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,376
I thought someone in my office
was playing a prank on me.

334
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,319
Well, I thought
Thea made a good point yesterday

335
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,672
when she suggested
that you go through the proper channels.

336
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,364
- Hmm.
- Please.

337
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:16,161
The interview I had in mind
was going to be on camera.

338
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,997
Baby steps. May I ask you a question?

339
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,000
I don't think you understand
how this interview thing works.

340
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,462
Have your attacks
on my administration been

341
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:28,256
personal or are they just good ratings?

342
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:31,218
Don't see why they can't be both.
Why are you asking?

343
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:35,096
Because I'm trying to figure out how hard
I'm gonna have to work to win you over.

344
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,230
You seem like a nice guy.
But you're not a real politician.

345
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,857
I am underqualified.

346
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:50,654
Vastly. And the city,
my home, is suffering because of it.

347
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:55,659
I appreciate
the fact that I haven't earned your trust.

348
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:58,495
Yet. But, Susan,

349
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:01,248
as someone who professes
to care about Star City,

350
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,917
I think that you owe
it to the people of Star City

351
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,844
to give me an opportunity
to earn that trust.

352
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,420
And I promise you

353
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,507
I can't do that
if I'm spending all of my energy

354
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:13,009
dodging all of these grenades
that you're lobbing at me.

355
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,762
So, here's my idea.

356
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,848
You give me one month with no attacks.

357
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:22,102
Let me show you what I can do.
And if I don't deliver,

358
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:25,438
it's open season.

359
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:30,568
One month.

360
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:39,661
- What's this?
- My personal cell.

361
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,037
Why would I need that?

362
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,113
I think you can figure it out.

363
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,505
To survivors of Amazo.

364
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:52,424
May we experience as much sorrow

365
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,427
as drops of wine
about to be left in glass. Prochnost.

366
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:56,803
Prochnost.

367
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:02,225
I get us more drinks.
Something stronger.

368
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:03,768
All right.

369
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,982
It's a party, Viktor.
Let me get you a drink.

370
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:15,739
You may have passed all the tests
and said all the right things,

371
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:19,409
but I do not believe for a second
you are Bratva.

372
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,871
Then you weren't paying attention
during the ceremony, I guess.

373
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:26,958
Look around you. These men are here
because government men like Kovar

374
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,918
have taken everything from them.

375
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:34,424
The Bratva is means to bring justice
for all those crimes.

376
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:37,260
Justice is why I'm here.

377
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:42,849
Yeah, some American castaway
will never understand.

378
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:46,102
So you can say all the words
that Anatoly feeds you.

379
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,229
But you'll never be one of us.

380
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,649
And you should know by now
what we do to outsiders.

381
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,527
Viktor, come to toast our new brother?

382
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,863
Yes. Of course.

383
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,449
Congratulations, brother.

384
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,788
What was that about?

385
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,539
That was nothing.

386
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:11,044
- What is this?
- Best not ask, just drink.

387
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,226
How long are you gonna be staying here,
man?

388
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,931
I'm a fugitive, Rene. I live here.

389
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,977
And until you heal up, we're roomies.

390
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:30,961
So, you feel much more like talking?

391
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,233
Why don't we talk about the time
you were tortured?

392
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:38,947
Sure.

393
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:41,825
It was about a year ago.

394
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,537
My brother, Andy, did it.

395
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,581
- You got tortured by your brother?
- Mmm-hmm.

396
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,167
He was working with Damien Darhk.

397
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,462
Oliver said you re-enlisted. That why?

398
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,339
Partly.

399
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,675
That also why you sidelined yourself?

400
00:20:58,925 --> 00:20:59,926
That too.

401
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,679
- Hmm.
- So, you ex-Navy, right?

402
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,014
- Dishonorably discharged.
- Reason?

403
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,976
You know something, man,
you don't have to tell me.

404
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:16,526
We were transporting a prisoner,
one who had information we needed.

405
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:21,489
Intelligence officers
couldn't get it out of him, so...

406
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:25,785
I tried to do it my way.

407
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:26,953
You put a beating on him.

408
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,880
I've been thinking a lot
about that decision.

409
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:31,725
Particularly since you've been on
the other side of that beat-down, right?

410
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:34,043
Because I screwed up. Again.

411
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,213
That's my life, man.

412
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,925
And now you're asking me
to relive my latest and greatest.

413
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:42,844
That's right, Rene.

414
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,763
If you wanna help us.

415
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,266
If you wanna give us anything
that can bring down Church,

416
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:49,893
I'm afraid you're gonna have to.

417
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,320
Okay.

418
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:02,572
What do I do?

419
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:06,493
Councilman. Thank you for coming back.

420
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,245
I'm afraid
you're just wasting both of our times.

421
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,123
After you educated
us on Queen Consolidated,

422
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,310
Thea and I thought
we would do some of our own research.

423
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:18,421
Yeah, we were very curious to find out
where our family's business was located.

424
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:21,925
You would not believe
how surprised and delighted

425
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,171
we were to find out that
you were one of those, um...

426
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,304
What was...
What was the term the Councilman used?

427
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:27,972
"Crony capitalists"?

428
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:31,100
Right. That you were
one of those crony capitalists

429
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,394
who pushed poor people
out of those neighborhoods.

430
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,605
Hiding behind a shell company, of course.

431
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:39,192
The same company who owns controlling
interest in a real estate developer.

432
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:44,447
Who just filed for permits to redevelop
Orchid Bay for commercial uses.

433
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:49,035
Your opposition to this re-zoning,
it's not political, it's personal.

434
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,930
I get it.
You're trying to protect an investment.

435
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,956
Susan Williams
isn't shadowing you at the moment.

436
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:56,209
But, to me,
this feels like a story she would like.

437
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:58,586
So, should I call her?

438
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,798
She actually gave me her number
this morning.

439
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,717
Are you blackmailing me, Mr. Mayor?

440
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,806
Well, Councilman, it's like you said.
"Politics is the art of the real."

441
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,441
Well, that was fun.
You made Kullens squirm.

442
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,648
The guy's a career politician. Just need
to know where to apply the pressure.

443
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,780
How are you so sure
about all this?

444
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:29,784
I'm the mayor of Star City, Thea.
This is what I do.

445
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:34,789
Thea, get in the car!
Get in the car, get in the car!

446
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:10,158
It's my sad duty to inform you
that at 1:23 a.m.,

447
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:17,540
Mayor Oliver Queen
was pronounced dead at Starling General.

448
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:23,463
In his too-short life,
Oliver Queen experienced great hardship.

449
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:27,321
But he came through the other side
with a passion for service,

450
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:32,847
committed to making Star City
a safer place for us all to call home.

451
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:37,226
Well, he really didn't say anything
that nice about you when you were alive.

452
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:40,104
Probably didn't deserve it.

453
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,566
Sorry about the suit.

454
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:49,530
We haven't been properly introduced.

455
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,741
Heads up.

456
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:53,034
God!

457
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:54,619
Christopher Chance.

458
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,621
John referred to you as the
"Human Target."

459
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:59,916
Well, that works better as a job
description than it does as a nickname.

460
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,710
This is so weird.

461
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:04,921
You have failed this city.

462
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:10,510
How's Thea?

463
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,946
She's a little shaken. You know,
I didn't get a chance to tell her

464
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,348
what was gonna go down until right before.

465
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,642
She is gonna be so pissed at you.

466
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,143
And, like, the whole city.

467
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,313
They're gonna find out though, right?
I mean, you can't stay dead forever.

468
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,816
No. Just until Church makes his big move.

469
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,251
That's what you're
betting on now,

470
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,820
that the Green Arrow/Oliver Queen is dead.

471
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:33,116
That's the hope. Now we just need
to figure out what he has planned.

472
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,119
I do not understand you, Oliver.

473
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,037
You become brother,

474
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:42,583
but you still act like you carry
weight of world on shoulders alone.

475
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:45,962
That is what your brothers are for.

476
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:49,132
I'm just thinking about why I came here.

477
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,677
Because this best bar in town.

478
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,055
Actually, only bar.

479
00:25:56,889 --> 00:26:02,478
No. No, I mean why I came here.
After Lian Yu.

480
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:06,983
Yes. Yes, you already told me.
Something about old promise.

481
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,153
I thought I told you,
time to move forward.

482
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,614
She has a family. I haven't...

483
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,908
I haven't spoken to them.

484
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,785
Oh, this is about woman?

485
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:21,706
Now I understand.

486
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:28,129
There is old saying in Russian.

487
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:31,048
Okay, maybe not Russian,
but it still works.

488
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:34,177
"No problem beautiful woman cannot fix."

489
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:37,263
Now go talk to her before I do.

490
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:52,111
Oliver! Where are you going?
Party just start.

491
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,404
Figure I'd get some air.

492
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:56,866
You sure? I think I heard
Anatoly was looking for you.

493
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,327
I'm sure. I'll be fine.

494
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:08,628
So, thanks for doing this.

495
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:11,297
Being killed is basically my job.

496
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:14,050
But, uh, not just for taking the bullets.

497
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:16,719
I heard that you got Kullens to cave.

498
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:20,223
Yeah. And scored you
a very pretty girl's phone number.

499
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,433
I heard that too.

500
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,561
Yeah, but the truth is, you did that.

501
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:28,422
I was under the impression
that I've been down here all day.

502
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:30,983
I don't just put on faces, Oliver.

503
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:33,402
I become my target.

504
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:36,632
And to do that, I've got to learn
everything there is to know about them.

505
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:39,075
More than they know about themselves.

506
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:42,495
- I've got to become them.
- My apologies.

507
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:45,414
What for? Man, you've got a great life.

508
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:47,750
You're the mayor.

509
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:51,165
But you'd still rather
be The Hood than Oliver Queen.

510
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:55,091
Oliver Queen has...
Has never really been my better half.

511
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:58,386
See, nobody moves forward in life
when they're hiding behind a mask.

512
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:00,096
Trust me.

513
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:02,574
You know,
it's why you're struggling as mayor.

514
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,934
And it's probably
why you won't call that girl.

515
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:06,561
That's not the reason.

516
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,981
Listen, I'm the last person
to give dating advice,

517
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:13,234
but Felicity moved on. You should too.

518
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,280
You didn't know? Sorry.

519
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:22,618
Uh, earlier today, I met with a detective
who just joined the ACU.

520
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:27,373
Uh, Billy Malone. He casually mentioned
that he was seeing Felicity.

521
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:29,333
Seemed to think that you knew.

522
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,501
Hmm.

523
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:37,633
You're safe, Rene.
Nothing can hurt you.

524
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,469
Is this gonna be one of those hippy-dippy
meditation things?

525
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:44,974
Eyes closed. Breathe.
Don't try to remember.

526
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,603
Just go there. Get a picture.

527
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:57,194
I was starving. My wrists hurt
like hell from the zip ties.

528
00:28:57,904 --> 00:29:01,532
What else? Sounds? Smells?

529
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:04,076
Couldn't smell anything. Nose was busted.

530
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,953
What about people? Who else was there?

531
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,749
Muscle. Los Halcones. Triad...

532
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:16,923
[It's not the pain
that breaks people. It's fear.

533
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,300
- But there was something else.
- What?

534
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,763
The Trust goes to the Brace, 04 in 72.

535
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,517
I know what's happening.

536
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:36,400
- Hey!
- Hi.

537
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,321
Um, thanks for letting me swing by.
I know it's late.

538
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:42,848
You do remember that this apartment
has a front door, right?

539
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:46,285
Uh, front doors are more for people
who haven't just faked their own death.

540
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,373
Good point. So, what's up?

541
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,501
Your message sounded cryptic.

542
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:57,254
Sorry. I wasn't sure
if I should say anything at all, actually.

543
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:58,732
That couldn't wait till tomorrow?

544
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:01,258
Why didn't you tell me
that you were seeing someone?

545
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:04,845
Well, maybe on some
crazy sub-conscious level

546
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:07,658
I was worried you'd show up on my balcony
in the middle of the night.

547
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:10,559
Sorry.
Snark probably isn't appropriate here.

548
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,853
I'm totally fine
that you're seeing someone.

549
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:15,898
But I'm hurt that you didn't tell me.

550
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:20,152
I'm sorry. I meant to, and then
every time I went to go bring it up,

551
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:24,740
I just sort of...
Like... I just chickened out.

552
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:27,243
Why? Were you...

553
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,329
Were you
keeping the door open for us, or...

554
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,665
No! Course not.

555
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:35,251
No, it's just,
you and I work together and I just...

556
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:41,048
I didn't wanna make it a thing, you know,
until it was something real.

557
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:44,593
Is it real?

558
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,222
I don't know.

559
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,855
It's John and Rene. They have something.

560
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,484
"The Trust goes to the Brace, 04 in 72."

561
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:01,795
Could that be any more obscure?

562
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:04,155
"04 in 72," could be the time and date.

563
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,282
4:00 a.m., 72 hours after he held Rene.

564
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:07,783
Yeah. That's soon.

565
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,952
And "the Brace"
is what the guys in my hood

566
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,496
used to call a private airstrip
outside Pennytown.

567
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,873
Halpin-Brace Airfield?

568
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,625
That's the one. And this "Trust"?

569
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,587
I think it's the heads of the
crime families that Church controls.

570
00:31:19,754 --> 00:31:22,194
That's a bigger leap than
Curtis took at the Beijing Olympics.

571
00:31:22,465 --> 00:31:23,799
When he had me dig my own grave

572
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:26,385
he talked about bringing this
"Trust" together.

573
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:28,554
That's his big play, man.

574
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,223
- 04:00 a.m.'s in 20 minutes.
- Mmm-hmm.

575
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:36,282
Wake up the team. We don't have much time.

576
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:42,109
You're all geared up.

577
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:45,738
Oliver didn't bust me out of prison
for me to warm the bench, right?

578
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:47,385
So, what's up? You ready to move out?

579
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:49,158
Decided not to go.

580
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:52,005
Last thing any of you need right now
is me screwing things up again.

581
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:55,414
When it comes to guilt and recrimination,
the line forms behind me.

582
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:58,417
I didn't think I was ready to face
what I had done.

583
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:01,796
But I'm wearing this suit again because
I think it's a path to redemption.

584
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,509
And it could be for you, too.

585
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:20,564
Good flight?

586
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:23,293
Everyone's very interested in hearing
what you've got planned, Tobias.

587
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:26,070
It's called the largest drug enterprise
on the Western Coast.

588
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:28,197
Shipments 24/7.

589
00:32:28,364 --> 00:32:32,535
In a city where cops are afraid
or on our payroll.

590
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:37,039
And as an added bonus,
the Mayor's an alkie.

591
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,751
Sentry reports movement on the perimeter.

592
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,521
I thought you'd taken out the Green Arrow.

593
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:45,714
Nah, it's not him. It's the JV squad.

594
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:53,722
Chill out, damn it! Deal with them.

595
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,309
Spartan is such a badass.

596
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:58,602
The baddest.

597
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:17,163
You were right.
Fear of pain is what's worst.

598
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,123
You afraid yet, bitch?

599
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:21,125
Never.

600
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:49,445
I lost Church.

601
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:50,779
Got him. Moving southwest.

602
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,038
I've got these two. Go back up Mr. Church.

603
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:05,586
You guys all right?

604
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:08,607
Good to see you again, brother.

605
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:10,799
Yeah, you too. Nice helmet.

606
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,594
Target is secure. You guys all right?

607
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:23,854
You look like you've seen a ghost.

608
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:30,819
You survived. I guess
I'll just have to kill you again, Oliver.

609
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,655
You mind if I call you Oliver?

610
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:34,114
Yes, I do.

611
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:41,830
Get up.

612
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:13,195
You're done, Church.

613
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:17,366
You got much worse coming,
and you don't even know it.

614
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:21,912
He calls himself Prometheus,
and he's gonna end you.

615
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,550
First of all, I would like to apologize

616
00:35:34,717 --> 00:35:36,719
for perpetrating
a deception on this scale.

617
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:40,222
The ACU had intel that we may
be able to catch Mr. Church,

618
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:43,183
but only if his plan moved forward.

619
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:47,563
Which would only happen if he believed
the Mayor of Star City was dead.

620
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,817
In my mind, this was a worthwhile gamble.

621
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:55,779
And it paid off. Mr. Church
and his underlings were apprehended

622
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:58,365
as well as the heads
of organized crime enterprises

623
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:02,745
in Blidhaven, Hub City,
Keystone and White Holland.

624
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:07,291
One more piece of good news.

625
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:08,751
I've just received word

626
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:12,504
that the City Council passed an ordinance
re-zoning for low-income housing.

627
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:19,136
And with Church in custody,
I take it that your identity is safe?

628
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:21,889
Well, I hope so. Thanks for the assist.

629
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:24,475
And the personal insight.

630
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,643
Just part of the service.

631
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,772
Ah, speak of the devil.

632
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,815
Oh, am I the devil now?

633
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:35,694
That would definitely be my cue to leave.
Take care.

634
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:41,241
Sorry to drop by unannounced.

635
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:42,888
It's not like you need an invitation.

636
00:36:43,494 --> 00:36:45,746
Yeah, no, I know. I just...

637
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:48,248
Just between us,
things have been a bit complicated.

638
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:49,768
Wait, complicated is probably not
the right word.

639
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,793
It's not the wrong word.

640
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,753
I want you to be happy.

641
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:58,175
And in the spirit of that,
I think that you owe it to yourself

642
00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:02,554
to find out if what you have
with Billy is real.

643
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:06,016
And I owe it to myself

644
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:09,144
to embrace whatever's next
for me when I'm not...

645
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:10,813
- Yes.
- The...

646
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:13,357
Yeah.

647
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:17,152
It's funny,
that's what I came here to say to you.

648
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:19,154
We're usually on the same page.

649
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:21,407
About a lot of things.

650
00:37:24,076 --> 00:37:28,997
All right. Uh, mmm, yes,
I will see you later.

651
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:30,207
- Mmm-hmm.
- Okay.

652
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:36,296
- Thank you.
- You don't need to thank me.

653
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:37,548
Yeah.

654
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:39,883
I care about you.

655
00:37:42,094 --> 00:37:43,720
And I will always care about you.

656
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,683
It's a mortal lock.

657
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:56,024
Viktor wanted to give you a proper gift.

658
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:00,446
Guessing that's not you.

659
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:11,874
That's a nice knife.
Maybe I keep it after I kill you.

660
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,459
This doesn't concern you.

661
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:14,710
Actually it does.

662
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:26,847
Have a nice night?

663
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:30,350
You can tell your boss I expect
the other half of my fee within the hour.

664
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:41,320
Oliver, are you okay?

665
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:45,991
I'm fine.
Anatoly, what the hell is going on?

666
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:48,243
Viktor clearly sent those two to kill me.

667
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,704
Then some other guy shows up
and kills them. And...

668
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:53,290
Yes, yes. My way
of handling Viktor problem.

669
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:54,917
I know he wanted you dead.

670
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:57,353
You didn't think
it would be a good idea to tell me that?

671
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:59,922
We cannot kill Viktor. He's too connected.

672
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:01,548
I hire special man.

673
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,177
- Come on.
- Anatoly, what did I get myself into?

674
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:07,721
Yeah, a most interesting question,
my friend.

675
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:16,355
I thought we agreed
the last time was the last time, Susan.

676
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:19,775
I know. But then I remembered
my money was still good,

677
00:39:19,942 --> 00:39:22,402
and you still like
gambling a bit too much.

678
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,112
What do you have for me, lan?

679
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:27,783
The guy who took the bullets for
Mayor Queen was Christopher Chance.

680
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:29,284
It felt like his work.

681
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:31,203
I think I figured out
how Queen knows him.

682
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,412
Really?

683
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,624
I went through the database
looking for details on Chance's past ops.

684
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:39,336
Came across this little beauty.

685
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:41,338
You recognize your boy?

686
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:43,757
That was taken five years ago.

687
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:47,886
When Oliver Queen was supposedly
stranded on a deserted island.

688
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,647
Heading northbound.

689
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:02,109
Those cops riding protection
aren't on your payroll, buddy.

690
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:03,777
Nobody's breaking you out.

691
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,154
It's not what I'm worried about.

692
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,740
You guys should've flown me
to Iron Heights.

693
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,118
Yeah, I heard you liked helicopters.

694
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,288
What's got you spooked?

695
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,512
All right.

696
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:06,882
Don't go out there.

697
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,692
Why? So I can protect your ass in here?

698
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:09,926
So you don't get killed.

699
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:20,812
I knew we'd be having this conversation.
Just hear me out.

700
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:27,069
You want the Green Arrow.
I can give him to you.

701
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:29,321
I can give you his name.

702
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:32,824
You would be the only person who knows.

703
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:37,412
It's Oliver Queen.

704
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:41,833
So, we cool?

705
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,548
Yeah, we are.

706
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:27,838
English - SDH
