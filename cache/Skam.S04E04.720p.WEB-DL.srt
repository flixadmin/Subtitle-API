1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,100
We have merged with the Pepsi-Max.

2
00:00:07,024 --> 00:00:08,924
So we have a bus meeting this week. Vilde?

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,000
Why can't you host for once?

4
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,700
I heard you talked to Isak about Mikael.

5
00:00:19,724 --> 00:00:23,624
Oh yeah! He saw a picture
of Mikael on my Facebook.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,200
Okay?

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,500
We didn't talk about him or anything.

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,120
There is a boy I like.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,100
- Muslim?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,500
He is funny and smart.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,300
- Good looking?
- Yeah, really handsome.

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,400
Like that guy Yousef. Do you know him well?

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,680
Why are we talking about Yousef?
Aren't you with William?

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,500
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,300
I DON'T BELIEVE IN ALLAH.

16
00:01:03,819 --> 00:01:05,819
SUNDAY
11:45

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,820
- No.
- You have it open.

18
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,460
Take away those teeth.

19
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,224
Take them away!

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,480
- Do you love me?
- You don't think I love you?

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,140
Meow!

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Meow!

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,500
You think I don't love you Vilde? Hey!

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,540
- You have the dick of a lion.
- Hah! I have.

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,900
I love you so much that we'll be
together for the rest of our lives.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,100
If you liked it, then you
should have put a ring on it.

27
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,520
Come.

28
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,460
You are so quiet today?

29
00:01:54,084 --> 00:01:55,484
I'm a little tired.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,680
- Shall we go?
- We're going to Magnus' home and to fuck.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,500
- Okay...
- Bye, bye.

32
00:02:01,884 --> 00:02:05,084
- Nice to have coffee with you...
- Jump on my back!

33
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,580
Aren't couples in love
just sick gross or what?

34
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes.

35
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,000
When are you going to tell me
about that stuff with William?

36
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,030
I guess that would
be now, I suppose.

37
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,080
I couldn't testify against Nico.

38
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,300
Has the trial been up?

39
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,240
It was up in August.

40
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:09,680
I took the plane to Oslo and
got up and got dressed.

41
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,080
I sat on the streetcar. Then
I went off the streetcar.

42
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,040
Then I walked ten meters and
took the streetcar back again.

43
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:33,740
Then when I got back to London,
William asked me how it went.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,980
And I lied and said everything went fine.

45
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,920
You should have told us. We
would have gone with you.

46
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:09,920
Either way, the letter about the
trial being dismissed arrived.

47
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,940
I don't think I've ever seen
anyone so disappointed.

48
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,240
But he has to understand
that it was difficult for you?

49
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,560
Yes he understood, or he said so.

50
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,700
That it was fine, but...

51
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,100
I could see that he was so hurt.

52
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,540
It was like as if everything
with Nico just...

53
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,700
came up to the surface again.

54
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,920
After that he started working
and working, all the time.

55
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,200
And we hardly talked
to each other anymore.

56
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,340
So I felt like he
didn't love me anymore.

57
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,600
So...

58
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,340
One day when he was at work...

59
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,904
I just went back home.

60
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,140
What?

61
00:05:26,464 --> 00:05:28,464
Without saying anything?

62
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,140
But you've talked to
each other after that?

63
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:43,080
I've tried writing a mail
to him a hundred times,

64
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,000
but every time I think about
sending it, I think...

65
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,420
that perhaps it's better
if we just stay apart.

66
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,940
It has just become so ridiculously
complicated between us,

67
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:13,220
that perhaps both of us would be
better off with someone else.

68
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,600
You...

69
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:31,422
My God! If I'm going to think about
him being with someone else,

70
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,660
I'll just be destroyed.

71
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,480
You are so lucky.

72
00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:56,104
That you don't have to think
about all those problems.

73
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,500
Heartbreak and all that.

74
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,980
Maybe I should just
convert to Islam as well?

75
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,540
Don't you think Allah would like me?

76
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:11,264
I think Allah would love you.

77
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,080
I could just get married and...

78
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,800
I could marry that sweet
buddy of your brother.

79
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,224
Yousef?

80
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:39,045
TUESDAY
17:13

81
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,800
BUSS STUFF :)
Sara Nørstelien

82
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:46,502
THANKS FOR YOUR COURAGE ON FRIDAY.
YOU SEEM LIKE A COOL BUS BOSS.

83
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,900
1) HOW DO WE PAY FOR THE BUS?
SHOULD WE USE YOUR ACCOUNT?

84
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,610
CAN DO A SHARED ACCOUNT LATER.

85
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,320
2) YOU SPOKE ABOUT A BUS BOSSES' MEETING.
WHEN WILL IT BE?

86
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,400
YOUSEF: ANYONE MISSING THIS?

87
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,410
IT'S TIME FOR ASR

88
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,330
SOUND MUTED

89
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,270
REMOVE AS FRIEND

90
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,400
ADD AS FRIEND

91
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,500
-

92
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,800
-

93
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
-

94
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,700
-

95
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,160
Hello.

96
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,340
Hello.

97
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,370
Are you doing homework?

98
00:09:30,564 --> 00:09:31,864
Yeah. I...

99
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:35,488
I have to submit a biology
work in two days.

100
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,540
Biology? Okay.

101
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,600
What are you reading then?

102
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,510
I'm writing about the
human immune system.

103
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:44,534
Yeah.

104
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,140
Does Elias have guests?

105
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,430
No.

106
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:52,654
But you never know with these boys.

107
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:55,478
It's almost like they live here.
They come over at any time.

108
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:03,985
You.

109
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,210
I have to ask you something.

110
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,810
Do you think Elias has
started drinking alcohol?

111
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,140
- Huh? Why do you think so?
- No, I don't know.

112
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:23,140
But since Yousef drinks alcohol and...

113
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,330
I'm a little worried.

114
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:37,140
You don't have to worry mom. I
really don't think Elias drinks.

115
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,140
You don't think so?

116
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:40,669
No.

117
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,870
No? Okay. I'll just
have to trust you then.

118
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,220
Have you talked more with that
handsome muslim boy then?

119
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,940
No. I haven't.

120
00:10:56,764 --> 00:10:57,464
No.

121
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,840
-

122
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,400
WEDNESDAY
13:37

123
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,500
-

124
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,620
Hello!

125
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,040
What is it?

126
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,540
I've done some research.

127
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,320
Okay?

128
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,620
I know how you can get over William.

129
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,550
What are you doing on Friday?

130
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,380
What are we going to do now?

131
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,100
You'll have to find out and see.

132
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,040
No, I don't like surprises.

133
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,640
Hi!

134
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,500
Did you see my e-mail?

135
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,400
Yes, but I haven't had
the time to answer.

136
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:52,175
But... Can't you just contact Mari
yourself, regarding payment?

137
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,700
Yes, do you have her mail so I can
send the suggestion for contract?

138
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,805
No...

139
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,450
Noora, do you have it?

140
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
I think so. Maybe.

141
00:12:02,124 --> 00:12:03,224
Or just check mine.

142
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,990
- What's your mail then?
- Loglady997

143
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,140
- Password?
- Exper 5.

144
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,490
Huh?

145
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Exper 5.

146
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,140
- Exp...
- Exper.

147
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,140
Exper 5. Haven't you heard...?

148
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,320
How do you write that? E-K-S... or?

149
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,340
Oh my God!

150
00:12:32,564 --> 00:12:35,164
With X, or C or?

151
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,440
Hang on, my God. Don't
judge me for my passwords.

152
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,070
Here. Just look here.

153
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,140
But!

154
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,720
- What's she called? Mari Aspeflaten?
- Yeah.

155
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,140
- Thanks! I'll put you on copy.
- Yes.

156
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,140
Okay. But you'll come along on Friday?

157
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,180
Hello, come on!

158
00:13:12,364 --> 00:13:14,664
My God! You are really excited!

159
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,040
Yeah. But I'm excited for you
getting over William. All right?

160
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,920
- That's why I'm a good friend.
- What are we doing then?

161
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,290
Say it! Say it! Say it!

162
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,600
Will you come if I tell
you what we're doing?

163
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:29,431
No! Come on! Yes, say
what we are doing!

164
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,240
- Okay, we're going to a cafe.
- Are we going to a cafe?! That's...?

165
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,440
- Which one?
- Now you ask a lot.

166
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,900
- No, I'm just curious.
- Some of it must still be a surprise.

167
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,550
But, what are we going
to do at the cafe?

168
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,380
Just drink coffee and enjoy ourselves?

169
00:13:44,464 --> 00:13:46,464
Or is something happening? Is it...?

170
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,740
It's nothing dangerous. It's just a cafe.

171
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,800
And the rest you'll see.

172
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,980
Oh, have you started rhyming as well?

173
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,600
Yes, that's included!

174
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,460
- I come along. (continues rhyming) No.
- I already said "med" (along/with)

175
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,140
- Ok. - Like, "exper5". What's
that suppose to rhyme with?

176
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,900
How was this thing going again?

177
00:15:00,324 --> 00:15:02,124
We're here for my sake?

178
00:15:02,662 --> 00:15:04,942
Yes, of course we're here for your sake.

179
00:15:07,218 --> 00:15:10,718
Just to check out muslim boys and so?

180
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,130
Aren't you tired of westside boys now?

181
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,400
I think we have to go out,
meet new types of people.

182
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:21,978
Check that...

183
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,600
There are plenty of fish in the sea.
If you know what I mean.

184
00:15:26,858 --> 00:15:31,878
But you said muslim boys
only use norwegian girls.

185
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:39,038
Yeah. But then it's a good thing
you're converting to Islam.

186
00:15:56,138 --> 00:15:58,838
Don't turn around now, but...

187
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,978
are those guys looking at us?

188
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,390
How am I going to know that
if I can't turn around?

189
00:16:10,098 --> 00:16:12,748
Oh my God. They are coming over!

190
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,900
- Be cool.
- Be cool? I'm super cool!

191
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:17,878
- Hello!
- Hi.

192
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:19,657
Can we sit here?

193
00:16:19,681 --> 00:16:20,457
Yeah!

194
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,278
- Is it ok?
- Yes, take a seat.

195
00:16:24,298 --> 00:16:26,178
- Hi!
- Ali.

196
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:28,202
- Noora.
- Nice to meet you.

197
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:30,226
- Sana.
- Jonas. Nice to meet you.

198
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:32,878
- It was Sana?
- Sana.

199
00:16:33,978 --> 00:16:36,498
- What are you doing then?
- We're drinking tea.

200
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:40,078
- Chai.
- Enjoying apple.

201
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:44,102
- It's fucking good.
- It looks fucking good.

202
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:48,178
You have no idea how good it is.
Or you can imagine?

203
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,900
Yes, it looked really good.

204
00:16:49,978 --> 00:16:51,978
Help yourself.

205
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,300
- Awesome!
- Are you selling tea or what?

206
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,220
- Yeah. I'm selling this tea.
- Oh! I understand now!

207
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:06,878
- Good choice. Apple tea.
- Totally agree. - Cool

208
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,700
But what do you do besides
drinking tea then?

209
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:14,978
- What do we do?
- Are you studying?

210
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:16,757
- Yeah.
- Yes, we do.

211
00:17:16,758 --> 00:17:21,378
- Cool.
- At the University in Oslo.

212
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:25,878
- Oslo? Same here.
- You're studying there too?

213
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,015
What are you studying?

214
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,290
[UNKNOWN]

215
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,900
We're taking different subjects.
Like some...

216
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,300
Individual courses?

217
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,302
Yeah. Individual courses.

218
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:37,878
- Shopping for courses?
- Shopping for courses.

219
00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:39,777
What do you do then? Study?

220
00:17:39,978 --> 00:17:40,978
Yes, they study...

221
00:17:41,402 --> 00:17:46,002
Shopping for courses. Then I'll see.
Maybe a year off.

222
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:48,778
Because the student fund costs, you know.

223
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,575
[UNKNOWN]

224
00:17:50,298 --> 00:17:53,878
- Hello?
- Hi. It's Yousef.

225
00:17:53,902 --> 00:17:58,802
Sorry for calling, but I don't
know what to do with Elias.

226
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,440
What happened?

227
00:18:00,602 --> 00:18:05,082
He's completely drunk and
wants to go home and sleep.

228
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:07,106
But I don't think that's a good idea.

229
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,000
Where are you?

230
00:19:20,178 --> 00:19:22,578
I can walk you home.

231
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,858
It's ok, you don't have to.

232
00:19:26,882 --> 00:19:29,382
God, there's no problem.
I'll walk you home.

233
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,970
What was Elias exactly drinking?

234
00:20:37,258 --> 00:20:38,658
Vodka.

235
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:45,538
Bad reaction?

236
00:20:49,518 --> 00:20:51,218
What did you say?

237
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:53,802
Bad. Reaction.

238
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:57,419
Relax.

239
00:20:59,018 --> 00:21:00,178
You gotta relax.

240
00:21:02,818 --> 00:21:04,178
You're so tough.

241
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:06,978
Pass the ball.

242
00:21:08,118 --> 00:21:11,878
Wow, reaction! Or what?

243
00:21:13,998 --> 00:21:15,998
Tough girl, then.

244
00:21:20,138 --> 00:21:23,078
Just give me the ball. You
can't handle the ball.

245
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,300
- You got such bad reaction...
- I can handle balls better than you.

246
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,950
Wow. Wow. What the fuck?

247
00:22:17,518 --> 00:22:21,318
Why don't you believe in Allah?

248
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,300
You know, Even, that guy
we used to hang out with?

249
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:40,050
I think he is gay.

250
00:22:40,802 --> 00:22:43,902
Because he... he tried to...

251
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,180
kiss Mikael.

252
00:22:48,178 --> 00:22:53,378
And Mikael is quite religious.

253
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,100
So he distanced himself completely.

254
00:22:56,878 --> 00:22:59,478
He was shocked.

255
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,878
So what happened was,

256
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:09,402
that Even was going to cure
himself by reading the Quran.

257
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
He started posting different
verses from the Quran

258
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,300
about those being gay ending up in hell.

259
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:27,618
You know that he...

260
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:31,858
tried to kill himself?

261
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:40,938
So I just feel that Islam,
or religion in general,

262
00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:46,878
creates a lot of anxiety on people.

263
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:55,878
Even was sick though.

264
00:23:57,618 --> 00:23:59,778
It had nothing to do with religion.

265
00:24:02,938 --> 00:24:03,938
I don't know.

266
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:12,378
I personally feel I've taken
the best from religion

267
00:24:12,698 --> 00:24:14,778
and thrown away the rest.

268
00:24:18,158 --> 00:24:20,558
And what's the best then?

269
00:24:24,638 --> 00:24:30,478
Things like compassion for others. Be
grateful for everything you receive and,

270
00:24:32,078 --> 00:24:34,778
to help others, to be positive.

271
00:24:34,802 --> 00:24:37,802
Do the best for others and
not just for yourself.

272
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,500
That's all.

273
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:51,878
But that's exactly what
the rituals in Islam

274
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:56,378
remind you all the time.
Those values.

275
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:02,480
By fasting and praying
five times a day.

276
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:05,538
It gives you focus.

277
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,250
And that's because of the fact that...

278
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:12,674
one should always remember
what is the most important.

279
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,340
And that is to be a good person.

280
00:25:17,498 --> 00:25:21,878
Don't you think I remember how to
be a good person without praying?

281
00:25:29,053 --> 00:25:30,053
Well.

282
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,650
For me,

283
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:39,850
I stress through the days,

284
00:25:40,842 --> 00:25:43,842
with hundreds of thoughts in my head

285
00:25:44,066 --> 00:25:46,066
and...

286
00:25:49,918 --> 00:25:54,778
and everything can be totally
chaos in the daily life,

287
00:25:54,902 --> 00:25:56,902
but...

288
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,860
but in the moment I start praying,

289
00:26:01,002 --> 00:26:05,002
everything becomes completely quiet.

290
00:26:05,218 --> 00:26:07,878
And clear.

291
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:12,758
Because even if all that chaos is
happening in your everyday life,

292
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,680
you remember what really matters.

293
00:26:19,818 --> 00:26:20,918
Everything...

294
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:26,530
Everything it's ok, because
everything is on a bigger frame,

295
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:30,830
and has a meaning.

296
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,200
Like...

297
00:26:37,358 --> 00:26:38,878
Do you know for example,

298
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,078
that brains of cockroaches,

299
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:47,502
have nine different types
of molecules for antibiotics,

300
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,200
that are stronger than any
penicillin we have today?

301
00:26:52,638 --> 00:26:55,338
Cockroaches? Seriously?

302
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,840
Where did that come from?

303
00:26:56,854 --> 00:26:58,054
Because!

304
00:26:59,438 --> 00:27:02,938
It's just that...

305
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,600
Every little part of the
universe is so complex.

306
00:27:07,738 --> 00:27:09,678
Think about that.

307
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
Even the brain of a cockroach

308
00:27:11,724 --> 00:27:16,524
has a bigger importance
and meaning on earth.

309
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,750
All the way down to
the smallest details.

310
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,790
And I...

311
00:27:23,735 --> 00:27:28,235
I just can't believe that
all this is a coincidence.

312
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,720
If religion is so good,

313
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:01,778
why does it divide society?

314
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,820
- Are we two? 
- Then we're cool.

315
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,200
- Oh, we are cool.
 - We are two as well.

316
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:24,578
- Okay? 
- Okay.

317
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:28,002
Are you looking into my eyes now?
Let me see. Are you?

318
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,400
I'm not really sure...

319
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:34,702
- I am looking into your eyes. 
- Very good. Okay.

320
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,450
No...

321
00:28:54,638 --> 00:28:55,878
But...

322
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:57,702
What was I going to say?

323
00:29:03,238 --> 00:29:05,878
-What should I say? 
- Sana!

324
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,630
Goodbye, then.

325
