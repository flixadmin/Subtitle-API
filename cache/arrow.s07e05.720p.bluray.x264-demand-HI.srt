00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,272
it is because we took

69
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,155
This is Malcolm Byrd,
a black market arms dealer

70

specializing in chemical
weapons trading.

71

The data we pulled
from the bank

72
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,680
tipped us off to
an ongoing transaction

73
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,950
involving a gentleman...

74
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,077
Dr. Nyambi Somto,
biochemist.

75
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,840
Two weeks ago, Somto
went missing

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,878
along with a cache
of nerve agents banned

by the Geneva protocols.

78
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,197
We believe that Somto's
trying to sell

79
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,880
these chemicals to Byrd.

80
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,839

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,189

Byrd still believes the buy is going on,

83
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,480

catch him.

Somto claims he and Byrd
only interfaced online,

never face to face,
thus the mock-up.

00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,536
the signal comes back online,
you want me to call you.

163
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,552
Yes. Look at us,

164
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,976
you know, finishing
each other's sentences.

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
- Really...
- go.

166
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Mm-hmm.

167
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,353
If not for Oliver's sake,
at least for my own.

168
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,599
[Sliding]

169
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,157
<i>I understand you've been
looking for the Demon.</i>

170
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,595
Talia?

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,595
You survived the explosion
on Lian Yu.

172
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,355
- How?
- You know I'm not so easily defeated.

173
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,079
What are you doing
here?

174
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,711
Oh. I ran afoul
of an old foe in Gotham.

175
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,712
What surprised me was to see you here,
a prisoner.

176
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,376
I believe I taught
you better than that.

177
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,993
Oh, you taught me
many things,

178
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,153
including how
to manipulate people.

179
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,511
So the attack
in the shower,

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,117
brick's mind games...

181
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,916
you pushed every button
and pulled every string

182
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,680
just to get me down here.

183
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,599
You always were
a quick study.

184
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,989
Where's Ricardo Diaz?

185
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,560
- I don't know.
- Liar.

186
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,599
I'm many things,

187
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,520
but a liar is not
one of them.

188
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,199
You asked how
I survived Lian Yu.

189
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,596
The answer is barely...

190
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,518
And only with the help of a
drug supplied by your Mr. Diaz,

191
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,231
<i>so in exchange,
I facilitated an attack</i>

192
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,040
on the man who murdered my father,
left me for dead.

193
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,277
More than a fair trade.

194
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,756
There was a time,
Talia,

195
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,991
when aligning yourself with
a man like Ricardo Diaz

196
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,669
would have been
beneath you.

197
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,594
I do what it takes
to survive.

198
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,311
<i>Another lesson you
seem to have forgotten.</i>

199
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,239
I taught you to separate
the man from the monster.

200
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,392
Instead, you exposed
your true identity

201
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,472
for all the world to see

202
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,871
and became the monster you
always feared you were.

203
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,754
What do you want from me?

204
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,314
There is a way out
of slabside,

205
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,193
and I need your help
to escape.

206
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,034
You expect me
to help you

207
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,635
after all the pain
and the suffering

208
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,998
that you inflicted
on my family?

209
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,296
What does it tell you that I
would even ask for your help

210
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,357
after what you've
done to mine?

211
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,636
You don't understand what
they do to people down here.

212
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,280
They reform criminals.

213
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,556
They destroy them.

214
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,875
You and I once stood
on the same side.

215
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,394
We can do it again.

216
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,712
You stood on the same side
as Adrian Chase...

217
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,875
And my son lost
his mother,

218
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,074
so now I'm here,
trying to save

219
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,517
what's left
of my family

220
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,471
because I'm stuck

221
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,630
in a cycle of violence,
and I have been stuck there

222
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,598
since the moment

223
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,798
you told me what to do
with my father's list.

224
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,838
You don't honestly
believe that, Oliver.

225
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,512
There's no Oliver in here.
I'm inmate 4587,

226
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,995
so I'm asking you, however
you broke into my cell...

227
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,030
Get out.

228

Uh, excuse me.
My husband is Oliver Queen,

231
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,856
and as your colleagues have
already triple-checked,

232
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,360
I am definitely
on his visitor's list.

233

It's been 20 minutes,
and he's not here.

234

Inmate 4587 has had his
visitation privileges revoked.

235
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,000
What? What happened?
What are you talking about?

236
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,077
I'm not at Liberty
to say, ma'am.

237
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,311
I'm his wife.
I have a right to see my husband.

238
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,039
I'm afraid you don't.

239
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,559
- You're Oliver's wife.
- Yeah.

240
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,896
I recognize you from the picture
he looks at all the time.

241
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
You know Oliver.

242
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,074
I'm kind of
his sidekick in here.

243
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,879
Can you give him
a message for me?

244
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,236
Can you tell him that
I have a lead on Diaz?

245
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,976
- He'll know what it means.
- I know what that means.

246
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,400
He'll be so excited,

247
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,517
but I can't give
him that message.

248
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,520
Why not?

249
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,592
Because he got sent
down to level two.

250
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,669
What's level two?

251
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,479
It's bad,
it's really bad.

252
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,711
It's where they send
the worst of the worst.

253
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,440
But Oliver isn't
the worst of the worst.

254
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,160
It's kind of a long story,
but he got set up,

255
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,313
and then he had to
stab a guard or two.

256

happened fast,</i>

No. Oliver... Oliver
would never...

259
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,800
he would never do
something like that.

260
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,056
I don't know
if you've noticed,

261
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,517
but the guards aren't exactly
on the side of good in here.

- Wait just one second.

your husband.

OK, Curtis. Once you get
firm confirmation,

we'll move in but not before,
so keep it cool, OK?

Wait.

get out, done.

Getting roped into the sequel
was not part of the plan!

We're in the field.

Sometimes, plans
change in the field!

You, of all people,
should know that!

294

Look. My days
in the field were over

295

the day Oliver went
to prison.

I would like to
keep it that way.

to nail Byrd.

We can't do that
without you!

Well, then you better hope I have
a twin or a clone or something

any sense.

so I suggest you get
it straightened out,

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,390

attorney so far up your ass

319
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,316
It's a work
in progress.

320
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,736
The prisoner that knew
Oliver said

321
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,360
they took him somewhere
called level two.

322
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,840
We need to figure out
what that is.

323
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,800
We?

324
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:20,041
Consider it a lesson
in empathy.

325
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,976
OK. I'm accessing
the federal slabside records...

326
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,673
employment,
inmate sentencing,

327
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
infrastructure.

328
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,216
I don't know what's
more amusing...

329
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,357
the fact that you just broke
6 laws in front of me

330
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,240
or that you're forcing me to
feel empathetic about it.

331
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,720
What? What's wrong?

332
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,714
Wherever they took Oliver is
completely off the books.

333
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,952
There's no record of anything
at slabside called level two.

334
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,991
[Door sliding open]

335
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,313
Oliver: What the hell
happened to him?

336
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,358
You don't recognize
a dead body?

337
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,953
What goes on
in that room?

338
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,670
That's where they
reform you.

339
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,076
Therapy doesn't kill
people, Talia.

340
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,799
You have a surprising
amount of empathy

341
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,235
for a man
who assaulted you.

342
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,278
He's dead because

343
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,318
of whatever happened
behind those doors.

344
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,477
Then he's one
of the lucky ones.

345
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,280
- What?
- Those who walk out alive

346
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,630
suffer much more.

347
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,158
You have no idea what your doctor
is really doing down here.

348
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,033
Come on.

349
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,950
Dr. Parker's behind this?

350
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,714
Not so quick
a study after all.

351
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,272
You fell
for Parker's lies.

352
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,136
That's what happens when you fail
to keep your two sides separate.

353
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,480
You become weak.

354
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,553
Whatever is happening,
we need to stop it.

355
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,071
These people are
criminals

356
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,789
the likes of which you've spent
the past 6 years putting away.

357
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,519
I'm surprised you
want to help them.

358
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,477
But you were the one who pushed
me towards helping others,

359
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,717
towards fighting
for justice.

360
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,354
You had honor then.

361
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,115
That was
a long time ago.

362
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,240
Now all I care about
is getting out of here.

363
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,119
Are you prepared
to help me with that?

364
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,917
Then we have nothing
further to discuss.

365
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,157
I need to see Dr. Parker.

366
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
That's not how it works.

367
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:47,993
I need his help.
I'm having a relapse.

368
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,512
Hey, Dinah.
Do you have a sec?

369
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,240
Yeah. Uh, is this
about the Hudson case?

370
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,240
Because I would like to
get 3 counts if we can.

371
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,674
Felicity: Hi, Dinah.

372
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,991
Hi. Wow. OK.
Since when are you two friends?

373
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,936
Well, we decided to start a support group
for women who've been attacked by Diaz.

374
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,520
Laurel: Or his assassins.
Do you care to join?

375
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,833
Dinah: Uh, thanks,
I'll pass,

376
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,639
but, hey, maybe you
should get back

377
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,029
to witness protection

378
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,696
and you should head
on back to Earth Two

379
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,376
before you both remember
you hate each other.

380
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,800
OK. Real talk. We're working together,
and we need your help.

381
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,794
- We?
- It's called empathy, Dinah.

382
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,216
I'm about 100% sure that's not
what we're dealing with here,

383
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
but what is going on?

384
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,391
Slabside is denying
Felicity access to Oliver.

385
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,336
Felicity: <i>They're keeping him
somewhere called level two,</i>

386
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,816
but there's no record
of anything at slabside

387
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,776
called level two,
so we dove into the employee records,

388
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,056
- and we found something.
- Yes. A psychiatrist by the name

389
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,117
of Dr. Jarrett Parker
with a "p."

390
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,296
We need you to check to see if
there were any complaints made

391
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,551
<i>to the SCPD about Parker
during his private practice.</i>

392
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,720
Surprised you didn't just
hack into SCPD yourself.

393
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,976
Oh, I did. There was just
nothing in the digital records.

394
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,736
I was hoping to do this
the old-fashioned way

395
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,911
and go through the hard
copies in the SCPD archive.

396
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,758
Dinah: OK, but what makes us
believe this Parker guy is shady?

397
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,630
Slabside doesn't have a psychiatric
program for their inmates.

398
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,715
Felicity: Whatever Parker is
doing is not being reported.

399
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,554
Please. If Oliver is in trouble,
we have to help him.

400
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,874
Surprised to see
you here.

401
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,000
Thought you'd be out.

402
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:12,434
Well, still have
a job to do,

403
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,856
you know, the one
that doesn't involve

404
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,837
possibly dismemberment
and/or death.

405
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,840
Since when have you been
afraid of any of that?

406
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,794
- Since always.
- You know what I mean.

407
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,536
You always ran the risk
of dying with Team Arrow.

408
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,016
Why is it any different
now with A.R.G.U.S.?

409
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,872
It just is.
Let's leave it at that.

410
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,400
No. We can't just
leave it at that.

411
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,674
You're sidelining yourself.
I want to know why.

412
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,438
I just don't have it
in me anymore.

413
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,280
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

414
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,311
Oliver's in prison.
Even he couldn't outrun the risk

415
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,279
that it takes to be
out there fighting.

416
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,516
This life has cost
me my marriage,

417
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,593
gotten me stabbed,
and people I love shot.

418
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,434
Maybe you and Lyla
and everyone else has

419
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,696
what it takes
to cope with it,

420
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,189
but I can't keep
lying to myself.

421
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,557
Being Mr. Terrific...

422
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,833
It's just not
me anymore.

seen the faces of men who are done.

Curtis, that is
not you.

425
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,839
Yeah. I am pretty sure
that is me.

429
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,869
Mr. Terrific isn't just an
alter ego you can lay aside.

430
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,480
It's who you are,
Curtis.

<i>The only real risk you're running
is denying the truth in that.</i>

432
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,234
Now, I respect your decision
to sit out this mission.

433
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,839
Just make sure
it's the right one.

434
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,431
When did you notice
the rage happening?

435
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,314
When I saw the inmate with
the grim reaper tattoo.

436
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,312
Interesting. Why do you think you
responded so negatively to him?

437
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,870
He was among the group who
attacked me on level one.

438
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,440
Hmm. Well, the good news is you didn't
give in to your violent tendencies.

439
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,389
You came here.
That means the treatment is working.

440
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,032
Dr. Parker, the main reason
that I didn't do anything was

441
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,560
he was dead.

442
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,200
I...
I saw him being w-wheeled out of the room

443
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,999
with the blue door.

444
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,749
Unfortunately, some
inmates don't respond

445
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,071
as well as you
to the process.

446
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,515
When you're breaking
new scientific ground,

447
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,000
setbacks are inevitable.

448
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,154
It seems like a... ahem...
prisoner dying is

449
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,519
a little bit more
than a setback.

450
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,877
Look at what we've done
together,

451
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,397
h-how we've eliminated
that part of yourself

452
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,756
that was trapped
in a cycle of violence.

453
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,070
Imagine that
on a grander scale.

454
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,640
The world would be
a much safer place.

455
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,591
Right, but people
are dying.

456
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,996
What about them?

457
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,874
That sounds like something
the old you would say, 4587,

458
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,631
the hero who insisted on
righting the wrongs of strangers

459
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,235
at the expense of the
safety and well-being

460
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,399
<i>of the people he loves.</i>

461
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,392
I thought you weren't
that person anymore.

462
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
I'm not.

463
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,390
Good.

464
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,711
You need to continue
focusing on yourself,

465
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,678
on the man you
need to be

466
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,193
for the sake
of your family.

467
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,511
If you're unable
to do that,

468
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,199
we'll be forced

469
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,194
to pursue some
other treatment options.

470
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,676
Felicity:
Why is an arrest report from 1985

471
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,560
in the same box as an
employee file from 2002?

472
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
It doesn't make
any sense!

473
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,616
I know, after the department
switched to computerized files,

474
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,360
they just stopped taking
care of this place.

475
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,797
You mean, the SCPD is
late to the digital party?

476
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,314
Wow! Shocking.

477
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,635
Felicity, there may be
some other options.

478
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,976
Now I still have friends
in the FBI.

479
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,151
- I can call...
- because the FBI is known

480
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,520
for their speed
and efficiency?

481
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,400
Do you have
a better idea?

482
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,075
Yes. I asked the U.S.
attorney to file a motion

483
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,914
compelling slabside to
release all their records.

484
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,639
Oh, and you think
my way is slow!

485
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,274
That could take weeks,
months.

486
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,000
Oliver may not have weeks,
he may not have months!

487
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,391
He may not even have days!
We don't know where he is.

488
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,712
I had no idea what his life
had become in there,

489
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,872
the things that
he's had to do.

490
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,636
Laurel: Felicity, you've been focused
on catching a homicidal maniac.

491
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,400
If anybody understands
that, it's Oliver.

492
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,656
Dinah: And Oliver's the one
who decided to go to prison.

493
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,680
This isn't on you.

494
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,558
And I was pissed
about that decision.

495
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,157
I should have
visited him more.

496
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,277
I should have been
able to prevent this.

497
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,874
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

498
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,595
Look. I get it, OK,
but trust me,

499
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,400
there is nothing
you could have done.

500
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,399
You have to stop
blaming yourself.

501
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,277
I thought that the worst
thing that could happen

502
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,511
was me losing my
husband to prison.

503
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,115
Well, what if I lose
him permanently?

504
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,157
Ahem. If you still want to get out of here,
we go tonight.

505
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,896
Well,
I'm glad you've finally come to your senses,

506
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,016
though I suspect
your willingness

507
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,839
to conspire comes
with... Conditions.

508
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,831
I need you to help me expose
the truth about Dr. Parker.

509
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,440
And how do you
propose we do that?

510
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,876
The evidence we need is
behind those blue doors.

511
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,236
We break in, we get it,
we escape.

512
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,595
That would be unwise.

513
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,336
You've seen what happens to
people who go into that room.

514
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,400
They come out
in body bags.

515
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,800
Talia, we are doing
this my way,

516
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,040
or we're not doing
it at all.

517
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,476
You'd risk both our lives

518
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,096
to help these prisoners,
despite knowing

519
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,476
that every last one
is a murderer or worse?

520
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,429
These people are being treated
like they are disposable.

521
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,597
- No one deserves that.
- Tell me, did you feel

522
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,456
that same compassion when you rammed
a sword through my father's chest?

523
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,517
No, because back then,
I still allowed the monster

524
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,399
that you helped unleash
take over.

525
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,399
Don't insinuate that my father's
death was somehow my fault.

526
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,236
I... Ra's' death
was my fault.

527
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,994
I couldn't see past what he
intended to do to my city,

528
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,799
so I didn't stop and think
about his family,

529
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,352
and for that,
I am truly sorry.

530
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,599
I know you hate me...

531
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,272
But I was
your student once,

532
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,833
and we trusted
each other completely.

533
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,834
We need to find
that trust again

534
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,435
because it is the only way

535
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,239
both of us will get
what we want.

536
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,397
John: Remember, the area surrounding
this meet is densely populated.

537
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,037
Byrd will not hesitate to leverage
this if he suspects something's up.

538
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,549
Dismissed.

539
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,312
But he won't, right,

540
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,951
as long as you all send
me in there alone?

541
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,194
Curtis, that's the hope,
but don't worry, man. You got this.

542
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,877
Right. I just need to turn off the
part of my brain going, "aah!"

543
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,795
OK. Ready.
What's the plan?

544
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,713
We're gonna give him
exactly what he wants.

545
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,832
The chemical will be
housed in this.

as crude as a terrorist.</i>

What you call crude
I see as lucrative.

and you were
far too perfect a mark.

Perhaps you are forgetting
you are standing

563
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,909
right in front
of the bomb.

564
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,312
You've heard of remote detonation,
haven't you?

565
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,640
For someone so smart,
are you really this dumb?

566
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,776
[Normal Voice] Well, actually,
if I wanted to do something

567
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,917
super-dumb, I'd probably
do something stupid like

568
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,720
tackle you to the ground,
take that tablet,

569

and shove it
down your throat.

Still a sense of humor.

Quite impressive for
someone about to die.

Guess I'm just
ready for it.

575
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,757
I do have one
request first.

00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,640
Can you give me a countdown
before you kill me?

577
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,674
First time I've
heard that one.

Ugh. Yeah. Felicity,
I hate to say it,

600
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,456
but I think we might need to
try a different approach here.

601
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,675
It's not that we're
giving up.

602

It's just that we need to
figure out another way to...

several violent outbursts.

Parker promised the parents he
could make their son docile.

612
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,795
Instead, Goodman began suffering
spontaneous bouts of amnesia.

What the hell was this guy
doing to these people?

Looks like Parker's
making a career out of it

about 8 different cases
