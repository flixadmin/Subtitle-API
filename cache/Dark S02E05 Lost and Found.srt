1
00:03:07,547 --> 00:03:09,547
Isn't it peculiar

2
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,800
that we feel the most repulsion

3
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,420
for the very people who are
most similar to ourselves?

4
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:20,355
I just want to know how to get home.

5
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,397
Get dressed.

6
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:02,765
25 June 2020

7
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:06,349
2 days until the Apocalypse

8
00:04:37,963 --> 00:04:39,613
Wait a minute.

9
00:04:47,297 --> 00:04:49,457
There's something you need to see.

10
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:53,207
- We have to go.
- It's probably best if you sit down.

11
00:04:53,297 --> 00:04:56,417
Maybe some other time.
We really have to go.

12
00:04:57,838 --> 00:04:59,158
I...

13
00:04:59,963 --> 00:05:01,723
I've got to tell you this.

14
00:05:01,963 --> 00:05:05,343
It sounds insane, but I need
to know what you think about it.

15
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:07,112
What the hell?

16
00:05:07,347 --> 00:05:09,245
For months you haven't
even spoken to us.

17
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,721
And now you want to know
what we think?

18
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,030
Look around you.

19
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:18,416
We're the kids here, but you've
behaved like one for months!

20
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:19,451
I mean, fuck, Mum,

21
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:22,481
you think you're the only one
who deals with this shit?

22
00:05:23,775 --> 00:05:25,815
But it's not only you!

23
00:05:32,463 --> 00:05:33,713
No.

24
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,080
Even if you want to talk now,
we don't need it.

25
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:51,898
Why is he so interested
in the power plant?

26
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:56,838
I want you to find someone at the
Federal Police who knows Clausen.

27
00:05:56,922 --> 00:05:59,532
Find out what he's really doing here.

28
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:03,223
Call me as soon as you're
able to figure this out.

29
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,560
Bartosz isn't here.

30
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:16,878
His bed wasn't slept in. He
wasn't here all last night.

31
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:21,768
- He's probably at Martha's.
- They broke up.

32
00:06:22,255 --> 00:06:25,255
They could've gotten back
together. Did you try calling?

33
00:06:25,338 --> 00:06:27,018
No one's answering.

34
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,710
I'm sure it's nothing.

35
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:35,017
Say everything's okay.

36
00:06:44,547 --> 00:06:46,297
Everything's okay.

37
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:12,262
Doing all right, Inspector?

38
00:07:24,255 --> 00:07:26,375
<i>Former Winden Chief
Inspector Egon Tiedemann</i>

39
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,263
<i>Found dead on 26 June 26 1987</i>

40
00:07:30,547 --> 00:07:33,267
<i>Circumstances surrounding
his death still unclear</i>

41
00:07:37,838 --> 00:07:39,258
Ms. Tiedemann.

42
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:41,938
The French delegation.

43
00:07:42,922 --> 00:07:45,762
They're all waiting.
I think you better...

44
00:07:49,047 --> 00:07:50,587
Reschedule.

45
00:07:50,672 --> 00:07:51,762
What?

46
00:08:00,422 --> 00:08:03,762
- Reschedule.
- But I can't just...

47
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:28,667
Why am I here?

48
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:34,667
A man

49
00:08:34,755 --> 00:08:36,435
lives 3 lives.

50
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:40,757
The first one ends with
the loss of naïveté,

51
00:08:40,838 --> 00:08:43,918
the second, with the loss of innocence

52
00:08:44,005 --> 00:08:46,125
and the third...

53
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:48,233
with the loss of life itself.

54
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,760
It's inevitable

55
00:08:51,785 --> 00:08:54,155
that we go through all 3 stages.

56
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,460
You turn into your older self.

57
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,845
And your older self...

58
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,760
will turn into what you see here.

59
00:09:03,838 --> 00:09:06,328
I don't have time for
all this shit here.

60
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,628
I have to get back now,
to my time!

61
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:12,423
I know what will happen.
I've seen all the graves.

62
00:09:13,713 --> 00:09:15,713
You have lots of time.

63
00:09:16,797 --> 00:09:19,207
This is the year 1921.

64
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:24,705
Strictly speaking,
you have 99 years left.

65
00:09:33,755 --> 00:09:35,795
So, a fresh snack.

66
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:42,953
People can say whatever they want.

67
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:45,585
This Reagan, he's a great guy.

68
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,263
The Olympics, on both sides of Berlin.

69
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,590
I'd say that's visionary.

70
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:55,192
I recorded his speech.
It was on last night.

71
00:10:23,463 --> 00:10:26,273
You haven't been here in a long time.

72
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:32,275
I just wanted to see
how you were getting along.

73
00:10:35,088 --> 00:10:36,508
It's all right.

74
00:10:43,547 --> 00:10:44,837
Claudia...

75
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,620
you know that I'm quite proud.

76
00:10:54,547 --> 00:10:56,807
Of all your accomplishments.

77
00:11:00,755 --> 00:11:03,225
And your mother would be too.

78
00:11:08,017 --> 00:11:09,477
I have to go.

79
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:18,563
The actual reason I came is...

80
00:11:20,255 --> 00:11:22,555
I think you should live with us.

81
00:11:24,152 --> 00:11:26,152
You wouldn't have to be so alone.

82
00:11:26,177 --> 00:11:28,637
And Regina would be
happy to see you more.

83
00:11:31,088 --> 00:11:32,928
How about tomorrow?

84
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:36,227
Tomorrow?

85
00:11:37,338 --> 00:11:40,548
You're acting as if
I'm inches from death.

86
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:47,255
Think it over, please.

87
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:50,008
All right?

88
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,140
Katharina!

89
00:12:21,422 --> 00:12:23,062
What do you want?

90
00:12:25,463 --> 00:12:26,923
Is he here?

91
00:12:28,338 --> 00:12:29,378
Jonas.

92
00:12:29,922 --> 00:12:33,052
He disappeared. I have
no idea where he is.

93
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,838
You said you saw Mikkel.

94
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:39,802
You were there.

95
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,480
How do I get there?

96
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:48,707
He has a sort of...

97
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,580
apparatus.

98
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:53,567
I guess you'd call it a...

99
00:12:54,255 --> 00:12:55,785
time machine.

100
00:12:58,755 --> 00:13:00,265
A time machine.

101
00:13:01,588 --> 00:13:04,168
And do you know how this thing works?

102
00:13:04,255 --> 00:13:06,515
It wouldn't help even if I did.

103
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:08,883
He took it with him.

104
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:22,577
He was always there.

105
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,000
Right in front of me.

106
00:13:31,163 --> 00:13:32,796
I just can't take in the fact that

107
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:35,437
you slept with my husband and my son.

108
00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:40,578
I guess you always wanted
everything that was mine.

109
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:43,232
You're like a parasite.

110
00:13:45,672 --> 00:13:48,712
Did Ulrich ever tell
you that he loved you?

111
00:13:50,505 --> 00:13:53,625
In the end,
he would always choose us.

112
00:14:06,827 --> 00:14:08,207
Good afternoon.

113
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:11,432
- Hello.
- You missed your appointment yesterday.

114
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,980
Oh, I'm sorry.

115
00:14:14,263 --> 00:14:16,343
I guess I forgot about it.

116
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,626
One would think a mother
whose child is missing

117
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:20,266
wouldn't forget that.

118
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:22,342
Mrs. Nielsen.

119
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:26,052
You're the last person
I expected to see here.

120
00:14:27,922 --> 00:14:30,162
But since you're already here...

121
00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:35,797
have you ever seen this man?

122
00:14:37,297 --> 00:14:38,857
No, I haven't.

123
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:00,605
How about you?

124
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,580
Do you recognise this person?

125
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:15,053
No.

126
00:16:39,422 --> 00:16:42,082
Do you know everything
that's going to happen?

127
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:45,522
I know when wars begin and end...

128
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,420
what discoveries science
makes in the next few years...

129
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,340
what shares to invest in.

130
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,770
But I don't know what
my counterpart will do...

131
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,550
as long as I haven't seen his future.

132
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,760
But you know my future. You
know what I'm going to do.

133
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:09,305
I am your future.

134
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:14,548
There must be a way
to change everything.

135
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,690
So that things happen differently.

136
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:18,288
A loophole.

137
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:24,508
It took me 66 years to
discover a way out of all this.

138
00:17:25,255 --> 00:17:27,875
A way to finally leave this hell.

139
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:35,692
I've been here about a week,

140
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,330
and I get the impression
no one here is telling the truth.

141
00:17:40,713 --> 00:17:42,873
Everyone's hiding something.

142
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:47,375
What I don't know is whether
everyone is hiding the same thing,

143
00:17:47,463 --> 00:17:51,673
or if they all have their own
skeletons in the closet respectively.

144
00:17:58,047 --> 00:17:59,727
Is he paying you?

145
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,470
Aleksander Tiedemann.

146
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't quite follow.

147
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,173
You worked for him as a physiotherapist.

148
00:18:12,198 --> 00:18:14,277
You've stopped now, correct?

149
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,030
Mm-hm.

150
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:20,713
And yet he still wires you
the same amount every month.

151
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:23,833
One would normally require
a service in return.

152
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:26,439
What exactly is the service?

153
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:38,632
What you don't understand is
that we support each other.

154
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:41,087
We stick together here.

155
00:18:44,338 --> 00:18:46,158
My son has disappeared.

156
00:18:47,297 --> 00:18:49,607
Aleksander helps out with money.

157
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,227
That's all.

158
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:57,795
Nothing beats a good neighbourhood.

159
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,875
It's quite remarkable

160
00:19:01,963 --> 00:19:04,463
that Mrs. Nielsen is
also so understanding.

161
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:10,093
Uh, maybe that's how it is
in small towns like this.

162
00:19:10,588 --> 00:19:12,958
You don't just share secrets...

163
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,448
you also share your bed.

164
00:19:53,922 --> 00:19:57,302
- I want to know what you know.
- All right.

165
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,920
Who is Noah?

166
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:01,588
He is one of them.

167
00:20:02,383 --> 00:20:03,863
A traveller.

168
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:07,575
He's Adam's puppet.

169
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:11,105
He killed the children.

170
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:14,047
Mads, Erik, Yasin.

171
00:20:21,963 --> 00:20:25,833
It seems like all this
is somehow tied to me.

172
00:20:29,672 --> 00:20:32,052
Do you know who my parents are?

173
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,080
No.

174
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,970
But I knew your grandfather.

175
00:20:42,088 --> 00:20:44,308
He's not my real grandfather.

176
00:20:44,797 --> 00:20:46,867
I just grew up with him.

177
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:52,367
Did he know all this?

178
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:56,158
Is he one of them?

179
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,062
A traveller?

180
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:02,048
He's just a pawn, like most of us.

181
00:21:04,338 --> 00:21:05,908
Claudia,

182
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:07,688
she used him,

183
00:21:08,172 --> 00:21:11,372
like she used me, Peter and the others.

184
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,410
She had him build this.

185
00:21:35,338 --> 00:21:38,418
You know what will
happen, in the future?

186
00:21:39,338 --> 00:21:40,458
Yes.

187
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:05,263
What is this?

188
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,420
Want another night, maybe?

189
00:22:11,505 --> 00:22:14,335
Bartosz, look at us.
What are we doing here?

190
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,920
- Why won't you tell us what's going on?
- I would if I could.

191
00:22:21,547 --> 00:22:23,207
I'm not allowed to.

192
00:22:23,297 --> 00:22:26,757
Even if I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

193
00:22:26,838 --> 00:22:28,838
Why wouldn't we?

194
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,090
Humans can survive three days
without any fluids or nourishment.

195
00:22:41,255 --> 00:22:43,625
You're crazy. You can't do this.

196
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:47,963
Are you going to leave
me here to die or what?

197
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,880
Hey, Martha. Martha, please. Martha!

198
00:22:51,905 --> 00:22:54,405
You can't do this, Martha! Martha!

199
00:22:54,547 --> 00:22:55,797
Okay.

200
00:22:56,588 --> 00:22:58,618
It's a time machine.

201
00:23:06,255 --> 00:23:07,705
What?

202
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:12,298
Are you kidding me?

203
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,340
I told you you wouldn't believe it.

204
00:23:17,838 --> 00:23:19,798
Come on. We're leaving.

205
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,360
No. Wait.

206
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,330
Then show us how it works.

207
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,525
I need a phone.

208
00:23:45,213 --> 00:23:48,303
- There's no reception.
- That doesn't matter.

209
00:23:49,422 --> 00:23:51,962
It just needs to search
for the signal. That's all.

210
00:24:18,922 --> 00:24:20,522
Come closer.

211
00:24:35,422 --> 00:24:37,622
The incident last summer...

212
00:24:38,005 --> 00:24:40,498
you said it was
the result of a reaction

213
00:24:40,523 --> 00:24:42,809
in the volume control system.

214
00:24:43,963 --> 00:24:47,093
I checked the data.
Everything was normal.

215
00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:49,757
So?

216
00:24:51,547 --> 00:24:53,617
What really happened?

217
00:24:58,672 --> 00:25:02,132
I knew you'd always
refuse to let this go.

218
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:09,460
After the incident, I had
a sample taken and analysed.

219
00:25:09,547 --> 00:25:12,167
What you see there are the results.

220
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:21,050
These values...
they don't make sense.

221
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,310
I thought so too, initially.

222
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,208
So I had them run the
tests another time.

223
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,614
The results were always the same.

224
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,418
If the data is correct, then...

225
00:25:31,418 --> 00:25:34,288
- is this what I think it is?
- It's possible.

226
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,170
It corresponds in several
ways with the calculations

227
00:25:37,195 --> 00:25:38,995
of Englert, Brout and Higgs.

228
00:25:39,047 --> 00:25:40,587
In '64.

229
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:42,765
Ah, but not entirely.

230
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,420
The God Particle.

231
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:50,858
The particle that gives
all things the mass they have.

232
00:25:51,797 --> 00:25:53,807
This is just sensational.

233
00:25:57,458 --> 00:26:01,078
If this data is correct, we have
to make it available to everyone.

234
00:26:01,463 --> 00:26:03,543
As I've told you before,

235
00:26:04,255 --> 00:26:07,955
sometimes it's all right to
let sleeping dogs lie. Hm?

236
00:26:10,088 --> 00:26:14,518
If we make it public people will
want to know how we discovered it.

237
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,020
The nuclear plant

238
00:26:19,088 --> 00:26:21,188
is my only legacy.

239
00:26:22,838 --> 00:26:25,408
Do what you want with the data,

240
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:28,457
but just keep my name

241
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:31,088
and the plant out of it.

242
00:26:31,672 --> 00:26:34,112
At least so long as I'm alive.

243
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,050
Are you all right?

244
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,840
Can I help you?

245
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,710
Hello, Ines.

246
00:27:47,797 --> 00:27:49,427
Ina, hello.

247
00:27:49,963 --> 00:27:51,963
We're out of iodine again.

248
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:53,508
Ah.

249
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,728
- Have you heard?
- Hm?

250
00:27:56,047 --> 00:27:58,417
A patient escaped from the nuthouse.

251
00:27:58,547 --> 00:28:01,033
In the '50s he supposedly
killed two kids

252
00:28:01,058 --> 00:28:02,781
and beat another one half to death.

253
00:28:02,838 --> 00:28:06,758
He's on his last legs now, but
they say we should stay on alert.

254
00:28:26,088 --> 00:28:27,508
Thank you.

255
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,800
You look familiar somehow.

256
00:29:03,797 --> 00:29:06,957
I've waited 33 years for
this moment to get here.

257
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:24,463
"The question isn't how...

258
00:29:25,672 --> 00:29:27,172
it is when."

259
00:29:29,088 --> 00:29:30,968
That's what you said.

260
00:29:32,963 --> 00:29:34,463
Do you recall?

261
00:29:45,005 --> 00:29:46,235
Papa.

262
00:29:50,338 --> 00:29:53,938
In the future there's
a prophecy about a new world.

263
00:29:54,463 --> 00:29:57,303
That Sic Mundus will
lead mankind to paradise.

264
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,210
Is that this?

265
00:30:02,463 --> 00:30:03,963
A religion?

266
00:30:04,838 --> 00:30:07,408
We're the exact antithesis of that.

267
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,240
We've declared war on time.

268
00:30:11,422 --> 00:30:13,862
God is our antagonist.

269
00:30:15,588 --> 00:30:18,048
We are creating a new world.

270
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,130
Without time.

271
00:30:20,213 --> 00:30:21,683
Without God.

272
00:30:23,172 --> 00:30:24,802
How is that?

273
00:30:25,547 --> 00:30:30,047
In short, the God mankind has
prayed to for thousands of years

274
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,300
the God that everything is bound with,

275
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,550
this God exists as nothing
other than time itself.

276
00:30:36,963 --> 00:30:39,673
Not a thinking, acting entity.

277
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:43,165
A physical principle with
which you can no more negotiate

278
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,850
than you could with your own fate.

279
00:30:47,297 --> 00:30:48,707
God...

280
00:30:49,297 --> 00:30:50,757
is time.

281
00:30:52,755 --> 00:30:54,955
And time is not compassionate.

282
00:30:56,005 --> 00:30:59,875
The instant we're born our
lives start to trickle away,

283
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,150
like the sand in this hourglass.

284
00:31:02,175 --> 00:31:04,525
Death is always inevitable.

285
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,400
Our destiny

286
00:31:06,588 --> 00:31:10,228
is nothing but the connection
of cause and effect.

287
00:31:11,588 --> 00:31:13,228
In light,

288
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,302
in shadow.

289
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,300
Charlotte.

290
00:32:23,963 --> 00:32:26,003
What do you want from me?

291
00:32:32,005 --> 00:32:34,455
- I am Noah.
- I know who you are.

292
00:32:39,088 --> 00:32:41,408
You've been killing the children.

293
00:32:47,047 --> 00:32:49,917
I can't make you change
your mind about me.

294
00:32:51,005 --> 00:32:52,255
But...

295
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,188
perhaps one day you will understand

296
00:32:56,213 --> 00:32:58,779
that I only did all this
to finally put a stop

297
00:32:58,804 --> 00:33:01,187
to everything once and for all.

298
00:33:05,547 --> 00:33:08,007
So you won't be taken from me again.

299
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:11,982
Just like your mother was.

300
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:24,883
They didn't think you had much
of a chance when you were born.

301
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,588
You were premature, tiny.

302
00:33:30,297 --> 00:33:32,797
But you wanted to live.
You were so strong.

303
00:33:35,338 --> 00:33:38,508
Your little hand grabbed my
finger and wouldn't let go of it.

304
00:33:38,588 --> 00:33:39,958
Stop it!

305
00:33:42,047 --> 00:33:43,857
This isn't possible.

306
00:33:51,172 --> 00:33:53,462
Your mother took this picture.

307
00:33:56,547 --> 00:33:59,207
I promised her I'd bring you back.

308
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:03,398
I kept searching for you.

309
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,420
But you were here all along.

310
00:34:10,463 --> 00:34:13,133
Adam knew it was you.

311
00:34:15,588 --> 00:34:17,738
He knew it the whole time.

312
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,190
He is preparing for what's to come.

313
00:34:22,547 --> 00:34:25,007
I've read all of the last notes.

314
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:27,958
The nuclear plant, Jonas.

315
00:34:28,047 --> 00:34:30,957
It's all going to happen
again, the apocalypse.

316
00:34:31,047 --> 00:34:32,507
In 2 days.

317
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:34,832
But I know now...

318
00:34:36,005 --> 00:34:37,665
what I have to do.

319
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:45,295
I have to end Adam so that
everyone else can live.

320
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:50,423
Not just those in the bunker.

321
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:57,835
Who is my mother?

322
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:09,638
She loved you very much.

323
00:35:13,213 --> 00:35:14,963
She still loves you.

324
00:35:53,547 --> 00:35:55,577
What happened here?

325
00:36:05,113 --> 00:36:06,923
The chair is gone.

326
00:36:07,005 --> 00:36:11,295
- What's going on?
- I didn't believe it at first.

327
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,650
But then he told me about
things that were going to happen.

328
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:17,672
And they all eventually did.

329
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,650
That...

330
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,100
you and Jonas would kiss each other.

331
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,190
He told me about it before you did it.

332
00:36:29,005 --> 00:36:31,395
That my mother would get cancer.

333
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,480
That Jonas would vanish.

334
00:36:35,255 --> 00:36:37,275
Who told you this stuff?

335
00:36:39,713 --> 00:36:41,713
- Noah.
- Noah?

336
00:36:42,547 --> 00:36:44,777
The priest? Tall, blue eyes?

337
00:36:45,047 --> 00:36:47,877
- You know him?
- I don't, but Elisabeth does.

338
00:36:48,755 --> 00:36:50,785
Okay, what is all this?

339
00:36:51,338 --> 00:36:53,628
Noah said it's about a war.

340
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,400
About controlling time.

341
00:36:57,197 --> 00:36:59,417
That my grandmother is involved.

342
00:36:59,505 --> 00:37:02,555
- That Jonas would return and that...
- Jonas?

343
00:37:04,463 --> 00:37:06,253
Jonas will return?

344
00:37:06,713 --> 00:37:09,303
Yes, he's part of this war.

345
00:37:13,047 --> 00:37:14,727
I'm going home.

346
00:37:19,088 --> 00:37:21,108
Do you trust me?

347
00:37:33,172 --> 00:37:34,622
Michael?

348
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,010
Michael!

349
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,610
Michael!

350
00:37:58,713 --> 00:38:00,963
Egon, it's Ines.

351
00:38:01,047 --> 00:38:03,587
I know this sounds strange,

352
00:38:03,612 --> 00:38:06,911
but I got home and
Michael isn't here and...

353
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,380
The man who broke out of
the psychiatric clinic. I...

354
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:13,883
What man broke out of the clinic?

355
00:38:13,963 --> 00:38:16,163
It was all over the radio.

356
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:18,625
Do you remember

357
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:22,343
the kids from the
construction site in 1953?

358
00:38:22,422 --> 00:38:25,092
That man, that's who broke out.

359
00:38:25,172 --> 00:38:27,624
I'll get in touch with the station.

360
00:38:27,649 --> 00:38:29,886
<i>I might know where they're headed.</i>

361
00:38:30,088 --> 00:38:31,918
<i>I'll pick you up.</i>

362
00:39:00,797 --> 00:39:02,877
Stop! Don't move!

363
00:39:02,963 --> 00:39:04,923
- Michael!
- Let go of the boy!

364
00:39:05,005 --> 00:39:06,005
- Let him go!
- No!

365
00:39:06,088 --> 00:39:07,878
- Get on the ground!
- Michael!

366
00:39:07,903 --> 00:39:10,033
- You don't understand!
- On the ground!

367
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:13,288
- This is my son!
- I said let go of the boy right now!

368
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:18,130
- Mikkel!
- Michael!

369
00:39:18,213 --> 00:39:21,673
Mikkel, I... I'll come
back. I'll take you home.

370
00:39:21,698 --> 00:39:23,158
I promise!

371
00:39:23,183 --> 00:39:24,383
I promise.

372
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,130
It's all your fault. It always has been.

373
00:39:29,213 --> 00:39:32,213
I swear, next time I will kill you!

374
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:34,338
Let's go!

375
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:36,128
Mikkel!

376
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,130
Mikkel!

377
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,138
Mikkel,

378
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,012
Michael, our father,

379
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:49,338
is just a small part of a knot

380
00:39:49,422 --> 00:39:52,672
that is infinitely greater
and more convoluted.

381
00:39:54,107 --> 00:39:57,897
The entire universe is
nothing but a giant knot

382
00:39:57,922 --> 00:40:00,422
from which there is no escape.

383
00:40:01,047 --> 00:40:02,827
If that's the case,

384
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:06,457
if everything is tied
forever in this knot,

385
00:40:06,547 --> 00:40:08,563
if nothing can change...

386
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:11,997
then haven't you already
had this conversation?

387
00:40:12,022 --> 00:40:14,422
And asked that very question.

388
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:19,020
All my life I was convinced that...

389
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:21,718
this moment here

390
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,550
could never be repeated this way.

391
00:40:25,672 --> 00:40:28,362
I would never be able to say the words

392
00:40:28,547 --> 00:40:31,557
that my older self said to me back then.

393
00:40:34,672 --> 00:40:36,972
Because I couldn't understand

394
00:40:37,422 --> 00:40:39,632
how I could ever want

395
00:40:40,255 --> 00:40:42,005
what he wanted.

396
00:40:45,547 --> 00:40:47,037
Now,

397
00:40:47,797 --> 00:40:50,557
66 years later, I understand.

398
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,710
There are moments
that change us forever.

399
00:41:01,672 --> 00:41:03,982
There is pain you never forget.

400
00:41:09,338 --> 00:41:11,668
But there is also a way...

401
00:41:13,005 --> 00:41:17,625
that leads out of all this
gruesome, senseless futility.

402
00:41:19,797 --> 00:41:23,007
But if that's correct,
if there is an escape,

403
00:41:23,713 --> 00:41:27,763
why is everything happening again,
why have you changed nothing?

404
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,510
Every development is
built on its predecessor.

405
00:41:50,588 --> 00:41:53,168
First there is the wheel,
then the automobile.

406
00:41:53,588 --> 00:41:56,798
I cannot be me without
having been you first.

407
00:41:58,255 --> 00:42:00,455
You have seen the passage yourself,

408
00:42:00,547 --> 00:42:01,837
the bunker,

409
00:42:01,862 --> 00:42:03,242
the chair,

410
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:04,597
the device,

411
00:42:05,145 --> 00:42:06,895
the thing in the future.

412
00:42:07,755 --> 00:42:10,585
But that's not the end of the chain.

413
00:42:17,047 --> 00:42:19,627
Thank you for taking the time.

414
00:42:23,922 --> 00:42:25,672
I'd like you...

415
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:29,509
to test this for me.

416
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,897
And not a word.

417
00:42:32,588 --> 00:42:34,108
To anybody.

418
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,160
What is this?

419
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,440
If it's what I think it is,

420
00:42:46,713 --> 00:42:50,113
it will change our understanding
of the entire world forever.

421
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:29,915
Preserve creation gain the future

422
00:43:48,297 --> 00:43:50,337
Hey. Hey, stop the car!

423
00:43:50,942 --> 00:43:52,602
Those are my children!

424
00:43:52,627 --> 00:43:53,827
Magnus!

425
00:43:53,984 --> 00:43:55,264
Martha!

426
00:43:59,463 --> 00:44:01,233
Believe me now?

427
00:44:29,047 --> 00:44:30,707
You came back.

428
00:44:31,422 --> 00:44:33,112
Where'd you go?

429
00:44:46,963 --> 00:44:49,733
Did this ever mean anything to you?

430
00:44:53,463 --> 00:44:55,463
Did you love Dad at all?

431
00:45:00,213 --> 00:45:02,843
I know you had an affair with Ulrich.

432
00:45:05,213 --> 00:45:08,423
If you could choose
between Papa and Ulrich...

433
00:45:17,163 --> 00:45:18,390
In all this mess,

434
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:21,737
I really thought you were the
only person I could trust.

435
00:45:44,547 --> 00:45:47,707
I fucked up everything. I know that.

436
00:45:49,005 --> 00:45:51,225
Maybe you've always done that.

437
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:58,955
Jonas.

438
00:46:02,713 --> 00:46:04,603
You need no one.

439
00:46:05,755 --> 00:46:07,825
You only need yourself.

440
00:49:04,797 --> 00:49:08,047
It's not the same as
the one in the future.

441
00:49:08,797 --> 00:49:11,627
Maybe it's something like its twin.

442
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:17,298
It's a section of the infinite.

443
00:49:19,755 --> 00:49:21,835
It penetrates everything.

444
00:49:22,463 --> 00:49:26,963
People have given it all sorts
of names over the centuries.

445
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,167
Ether,

446
00:49:28,255 --> 00:49:31,085
dark matter, Higgs field.

447
00:49:31,172 --> 00:49:33,012
How was it created?

448
00:49:33,088 --> 00:49:34,818
In the future,

449
00:49:34,905 --> 00:49:36,992
by the catastrophe in 2 days

450
00:49:37,017 --> 00:49:39,619
that you so dearly want to prevent.

451
00:49:40,297 --> 00:49:42,047
This one

452
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:44,210
was created by us.

453
00:49:45,047 --> 00:49:48,147
It is the continuation
of technical evolution.

454
00:49:48,922 --> 00:49:50,412
And...

455
00:49:50,547 --> 00:49:53,337
it will be the end of this knot.

456
00:49:54,713 --> 00:49:58,673
This one will send
you exactly to the day

457
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,713
that you want to travel to.

458
00:50:03,088 --> 00:50:06,458
It will break the 33-year cycle.

459
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,902
That's why I'm here.

460
00:50:11,405 --> 00:50:13,445
That's what you want from me.

461
00:50:13,505 --> 00:50:15,673
The way to stop this all
from happening is for me

462
00:50:15,698 --> 00:50:17,759
to stop the very beginning.

463
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,980
That is right.

464
00:50:20,922 --> 00:50:23,512
The question is, when is the beginning?

465
00:50:25,213 --> 00:50:28,053
And what sacrifice must we make?

466
00:50:32,088 --> 00:50:34,298
The 20th of June 2019.

467
00:50:35,713 --> 00:50:38,143
The day before it happened.

468
00:50:39,422 --> 00:50:42,172
Before my dad committed suicide.

469
00:50:46,005 --> 00:50:48,115
Before it all went to chaos.

470
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:53,165
If you can prevent him
from taking his own life,

471
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,300
then nothing that follows will occur.

472
00:50:59,884 --> 00:51:01,314
Mikkel

473
00:51:01,505 --> 00:51:03,555
won't travel back.

474
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:07,378
You...

475
00:51:07,463 --> 00:51:08,903
I...

476
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:11,858
will never be born.

477
00:51:14,297 --> 00:51:16,757
But everyone else will live.

478
00:51:20,172 --> 00:51:22,632
Martha will live.

479
00:52:00,338 --> 00:52:02,358
If you succeed,

480
00:52:03,172 --> 00:52:05,802
we will reorder the whole world.
