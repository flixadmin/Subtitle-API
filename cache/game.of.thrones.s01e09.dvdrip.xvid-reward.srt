1
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,880
(Breathing)

2
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,960
(Varys) You've seen better days, my lord.

3
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,120
Another visit?

4
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,720
lt seems you're my last friend.

5
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,560
No, no, many still love you.

6
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,720
Sansa came to court this morning
to plead for your life.

7
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,480
On her knees begging for me. Hm!

8
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,640
Did you laugh with the others?

9
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:29,160
You do me wrong, my lord.
Your blood is the last thing l want.

10
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,080
l don't know what you want.

11
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,760
l've given up trying to guess.

12
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,160
When l was still a boy -

13
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,920
before they cut my balls om with a hot knife -

14
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:45,320
l travelled with a group of actors
through the free cities.

15
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,760
They taught me that
each man has a role to play.

16
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:52,520
The same is true at court.

17
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,800
l am the master of whisperers.

18
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:59,120
My role is to be sly, obsequious
and without scruples.

19
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,120
l'm a good actor, my lord.

20
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,360
Huh. Can you free me from this pit?

21
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,400
l could.

22
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,800
But will l?

23
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,160
- No.
- (Laughs)

24
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,160
As l said, l'm no hero.

25
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,960
What do you want? Tell me.

26
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,800
No riddles, no stories...
Tell me, what do you want?

27
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,360
Peace.

28
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:26,280
Did you know that your son is marching south
with an army of northmen? Loyal lad.

29
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,640
Fighting for his father's freedom.

30
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,840
Robb?

31
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,680
He's just a boy.

32
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,920
Boys have been conquerors before.

33
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:41,320
But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights
is the king's... the late king's brother.

34
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,080
Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne.

35
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:47,240
He is a proven battle commander
and he is utterly without mercy.

36
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,560
Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir.
The throne is his by rights.

37
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,160
(Varys tuts)

38
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,120
Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life.
It would be a shame to throw it away.

39
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,600
Cersei is no fool.

40
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:04,880
She knows a tame wolf
is more use to her than a dead one.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,400
You want me to serve the woman who
murdered my king, who butchered my men,

42
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,040
who crippled my son?

43
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,000
l want you to serve the realm!

44
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,720
Tell the queen you will confess
your vile treason,

45
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,760
tell your son to lay down his sword

46
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,960
and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.

47
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,800
Cersei knows you as a man of honour.

48
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,480
lf you give her the peace she needs,
and promise to carry her secret to your grave,

49
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,080
l believe she will allow you
to take the black

50
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,560
and live out your days on the Wall
with your brother and your bastard son.

51
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,960
(Chuckles)

52
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,440
You think my life
is some precious thing to me?

53
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,080
That l would trade my honour
for a few more years of...

54
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,760
Of what?

55
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,440
You grew up with actors.

56
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,720
You learned their craft and you learnt it well.

57
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,040
But l grew up with soldiers.

58
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,320
l learned how to die a long time ago.

59
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,960
Pity.

60
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,760
Such a pity.

61
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,640
What of your daughter's life, my lord?

62
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,080
ls that a precious thing to you?

63
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,800
(Water dripping)

64
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,920
(Cawing)

65
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,080
(Arrow whooshes)

66
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,600
lt's a birthday message
to his grand-niece Walda.

67
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,320
- Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
- (Catelyn) Keep shooting them down.

68
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:12,320
We can't risk Lord Walder sending
word of your movements to the Lannisters.

69
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,320
He's Grandfather's bannerman.
We can't expect his support?

70
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,040
(Greatjon) Expect nothing of Walder Frey
and you'll never be surprised.

71
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,280
Look.

72
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,080
(Robb) Father rots in a dungeon.

73
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:26,200
How long before they take his head?

74
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,200
We need to cross the Trident
and we need to do it now.

75
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,680
Just march up to his gates
and tell him you're crossing.

76
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,600
We've got five times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.

77
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,960
(Greatjon) Not in time.
Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.

78
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,640
The Freys have
held the crossing for 600 years,

79
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,760
and for 600 years
they have never failed to exact their toll.

80
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,000
Have my horse saddled and ready.

81
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,120
Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you
to the Lannisters as he likes.

82
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,920
Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.

83
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,440
My father would do whatever it took
to secure our crossing.

84
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,720
Whatever it took.

85
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,200
lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have
other men doing my bargaining for me.

86
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,440
l agree.

87
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,520
- l'll go.
- (Theon) You can't!

88
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,760
l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl.
He would never harm me.

89
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:15,200
(Greatjon) Unless there was a profit in it.

90
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,440
What do you want?

91
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,000
lt is a great pleasure to see you again
after so many years, my lord.

92
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,760
Oh, spare me.

93
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,800
Your boy's too proud
to come before me himself.

94
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,840
What am l supposed to do with you?

95
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,840
Father, you forget yourself.
Lady Stark is here...

96
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:42,760
Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet,
not until l die. Do l look dead to you?

97
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,480
- Father, please...
- l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard?

98
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,800
Your mother would still be a milkmaid
if l hadn't squirted you into her belly.

99
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:58,080
All right, you come foM/ard.

100
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,280
(Smacking kiss)

101
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,680
There.
Now that l've observed the courtesies,

102
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,040
perhaps my sons will do me the honour
of shutting their mouths.

103
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,080
ls there somewhere we can talk?

104
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,160
We're talking right now.

105
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,480
Fine.

106
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,040
Out! All of you!

107
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:43,280
- Oh!
- You too.

108
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,440
You see that?

109
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,520
Fifteen, she is.

110
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,360
A little flower.

111
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,720
And her honey's all mine. (Chuckles)

112
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,280
l'm sure she will give you many sons.

113
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,880
Huh.
Your father didn't come to the wedding.

114
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,840
He is quite ill, my lord.

115
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,920
Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either.

116
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:16,160
Or the one before that.

117
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,640
Your family has always pissed on me.

118
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,520
- My lord, l...
- Don't deny it. You know it's true.

119
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,880
The fine Lord Tully would never marry
any of his children to mine.

120
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,800
- l'm sure there were reasons...
- l didn't need reasons.

121
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,400
l needed to get rid of sons and daughters.
You see how they pile up?

122
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,720
Why are you here?

123
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,240
To ask you...

124
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,520
to open your gates, my lord...

125
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,960
so my son and his bannermen
may cross the Trident and be on their way.

126
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,000
- Why should l let him?
- If you could climb your own battlements,

127
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,480
you would see that he has
20,OOO men outside your walls.

128
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,840
They'll be 20,OOO corpses
when Tywin Lannister gets here.

129
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,160
Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark.

130
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,600
Your husband's in a cell
beneath the Red Keep

131
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,440
and your son's got no fur
to keep his balls warm.

132
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,760
You swore an oath to my father.

133
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:12,840
Oh, yes, l said some words.

134
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,000
And l swore oaths to the crown too,
if l remember right.

135
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:18,280
Joffrey's king now,

136
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,840
which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be
nothing but rebels, it seems to me.

137
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,520
lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish,
l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters.

138
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:33,320
- Why don't you?
- Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon.

139
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:38,960
Give me one good reason why l should
waste a single thought on any of you?

140
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,680
- (Man) And...engage!
- (Wind howls)

141
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:43,760
(Door slams)

142
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:46,760
When does Aemon think
you'll be able to use that hand?

143
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,960
- Soon, he says.
- Good.

144
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,680
You'll be ready for this, then.

145
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,280
l thought a wolf was more
appropriate for you than a bear...

146
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,640
so l had a new pommel made.
It's called Longclaw.

147
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,280
Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think.

148
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,440
This is Valyrian steel.

149
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:22,880
lt was my father's sword,
his father before him.

150
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,280
The Mormonts have carried it
for five centuries.

151
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,320
lt was meant for my son Jorah.

152
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,920
He brought dishonour to our House,
but he had the grace to leave the sword

153
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,160
before he fled from Westeros.

154
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,160
- My lord, you honour me, but l can't...
- Oh, you can.

155
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,920
And you will.

156
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:45,760
l wouldn't be standing here
if it wasn't for you and your beast.

157
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,480
A bloody dead man tried to kill me.

158
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:53,960
So you'll take it.
l'll hear no more about it.

159
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,680
- Is that understood?
- Yes, my lord.

160
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,280
Right.

161
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,040
Now, don't think this means l approve
of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne.

162
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,520
That's a man's sword.
It'll take a man to wield it.

163
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,720
l'll apologise to Ser Alliser tonight.

164
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,120
No, you won't.
l sent him to King's Landing yesterday.

165
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,080
The hand that your wolf tore om
that thing's wrist...

166
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,320
l've, uh, ordered Thorne
to lay it at the feet of this...

167
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,240
boy king.

168
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,080
That should get young Joffrey's attention.

169
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:32,000
And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues
between you and Thorne.

170
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,600
Now go and put your sword somewhere safe...

171
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,960
and bring me my supper.

172
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,600
Yes, my lord.

173
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,920
- Well done.
- Well done.

174
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:55,520
You earned that, Snow.

175
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,280
Well done.

176
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,960
Go on, let's have a look.

177
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,280
- At what?
- (Grenn) The sword! Show us the sword.

178
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,200
(All) Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

179
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:15,400
Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!

180
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,960
(Laughter, cheering)

181
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,040
- Let's have a look.
- Piss om.

182
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:24,000
(Laughter, excited chatter)

183
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:27,800
Come on,
l want to have a look at it in the light.

184
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,480
(Pyp) Give it here!

185
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,400
What is it?

186
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,440
- l...
- Look at its eyes.

187
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,040
- Give it.
- l can't.

188
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,520
You can't what?

189
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,760
l...

190
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,880
l'm really not supposed to say.

191
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,520
And yet you really want to say.

192
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,520
You want to say that...?

193
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,360
There was a raven.

194
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,280
l read the message to Maester Aemon.

195
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,360
lt's your brother Robb.

196
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,160
What?

197
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,760
What about him?

198
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,600
He's heading south.

199
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,440
To war.

200
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,240
All his bannermen have rallied to his side.
They'll keep him safe.

201
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,520
l should be there.

202
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,040
l should be with him.

203
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,600
(Hoofbeats approaching)

204
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,480
lf we do that, they'll never get back across.

205
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,880
(Robb) Well?

206
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,600
What did he say?

207
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:48,120
Lord Walder has granted your crossing.

208
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,960
- His men are yours, as well.
- (Greatjon) Huh.

209
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,680
Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the
crossing against any who would pursue you.

210
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,080
What does he want in return?

211
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,280
You will be taking on his son Olyvar
as your personal squire.

212
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,120
- He expects a knighthood in good time.
- Fine, fine.

213
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,600
And?

214
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,640
And Arya...

215
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,400
will marry his son Waldron
when they both come of age.

216
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,080
- She won't be happy about that.
- Hm.

217
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,080
And?

218
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,160
And...

219
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,320
when the fighting is done...

220
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,600
you will marry one of his daughters.

221
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,560
Whichever you prefer.

222
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,920
He has a number
he thinks will be...suitable.

223
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,840
l see.

224
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:44,840
- Did you get a look at his daughters?
- (Snickering)

225
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,280
l did.

226
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,640
And?

227
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,440
One was...

228
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,800
Do you consent?

229
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,360
- Can l refuse?
- Not if you want to cross.

230
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,320
Then l consent.

231
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:12,320
(Chuckles)

232
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,320
(Cawing)

233
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
Sam said you wanted to see me?

234
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,760
l did indeed.

235
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:58,720
Perhaps you would
be kind enough to assist me.

236
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:07,040
Tell me, did you ever wonder
why the men of the Night's Watch

237
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,120
take no wives and father no children?

238
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,800
No.

239
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,560
So they will not love.

240
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,920
Love is the death of duty.

241
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:21,680
lf the day should ever come when
your lord father was forced to choose...

242
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:24,000
between honour on the one hand...

243
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,480
I
and those he loves on the other

244
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,840
what would he do?

245
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,800
He... He would do whatever was right.
No matter what.

246
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,880
Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,OOO.

247
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,480
Most of us are not so strong.

248
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,120
What is honour...

249
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,800
compared to a woman's love?

250
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,200
And what is duty...

251
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:50,720
against the feel
of a newborn son in your arms?

252
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:53,080
Or a brother's smile?

253
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,720
Sam told you.

254
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,760
We're all human.

255
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,960
Oh, we all do our duty
when there's no cost to it.

256
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,720
Honour comes easy then.

257
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,240
Yet...

258
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,200
sooner or later...

259
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,160
in every man's life...

260
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:15,160
there comes a day when it is not easy.

261
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,200
A day when he must choose.

262
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,920
And this is my day?

263
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:24,000
ls that what you're saying?

264
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,120
Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes.

265
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,960
- l know.
- You do not know.

266
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:33,680
No one knows.

267
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,280
l may be a bastard,

268
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,800
but he is my father and Robb is my brother.

269
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,880
(Chuckles)

270
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,000
The gods were cruel
when they saw fit to test my vows.

271
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:50,040
They waited till l was old.

272
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,360
What could l do when the ravens
brought the news from the South...

273
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,760
the ruin of my House,
the death of my family?

274
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,680
l was helpless...

275
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,960
blind, frail.

276
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,560
But...

277
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,000
when l heard they had
killed my brother's son...

278
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,120
and his poor son...

279
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,560
and the children!

280
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,880
Even the little children.

281
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,480
Who are you?

282
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:25,160
My father was Maekar,

283
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:27,280
the first of his name.

284
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,480
My brother Aegon reigned after him...

285
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:34,360
when l had refused the throne.

286
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,720
And he was followed by his son Aerys...

287
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:40,640
whom they called the Mad King.

288
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:42,360
You're Aemon Targaryen.

289
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:46,920
l'm a maester of the Citadel,

290
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,040
bound in service to Castle Black
and the Night's Watch.

291
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,840
l will not tell you...to stay or go.

292
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:01,320
You must make that choice yourself...

293
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,520
and live with it for the rest of your days.

294
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,360
As l have.

295
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,920
My lord...

296
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:32,440
My sun and stars...

297
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,440
Drogo.

298
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,640
(Mutters)

299
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:41,360
(Grunts)

300
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,760
(Speaks Dothraki)

301
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,960
My horse...

302
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:50,840
Blood of my blood...

303
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,680
No, l must ride.

304
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,120
He fell from his horse.

305
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,600
A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.

306
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,680
He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest.

307
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:08,880
We've ridden far enough today.
We'll camp here.

308
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,080
This is no place to camp.

309
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,240
A woman does not give us orders.
Not even a Khaleesi.

310
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,200
We'll camp here.
Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.

311
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,720
You do not command me Khaleesi.

312
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:23,840
Find Mirri Maz Duur.
Bring her to me.

313
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,440
The witch?
l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi.

314
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:32,080
Bring her to me unharmed
or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.

315
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,800
Hyah! Hyah!

316
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,240
(Kevan) Our scouts tell us the Stark host
has moved south from the Twins

317
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,600
with Lord Frey's levies in tow.

318
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,120
They're a day's march north.

319
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:10,520
The boy may lack experience and sense,

320
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,000
but he does have a certain mindless...

321
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,520
- provincial courage.
- Ah.

322
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,920
Oh, do continue.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

323
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:24,320
l do hope your savages
are going to be of some use,

324
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,400
otheM/ise we've wasted good steel on them.

325
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,760
The great hairy one insisted
he must have two battleaxes.

326
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,240
Heavy black steel, double-sided.

327
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:34,080
Shagga likes axes.

328
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,720
When the battle commences,
you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.

329
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,320
- The vanguard?
- Mm-hm.

330
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,960
Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?

331
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,320
(Kevan) They do seem rather ferocious.

332
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,440
(Tyrion) Ferocious?

333
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:54,080
Last night...a Moon Brother
stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage.

334
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,760
Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother
and opened his throat.

335
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,400
Bronn managed to keep Shagga
from chopping om the dead man's cock,

336
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:04,480
I
which was fortunate, but even still
Ulf is demanding blood money,

337
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:07,080
which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.

338
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,200
When soldiers lack discipline,
the fault lies with their commander.

339
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,680
Surely there are ways to have me killed that
would be less detrimental to the war emort.

340
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,040
There'll be no more discussion on the matter.

341
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,360
lt appears l'm not hungry after all.

342
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,960
Excuse me, my lords.

343
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:40,520
Where did you find one so pretty
at this hour?

344
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,680
- l took her.
- Took her?

345
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,720
- From whom?
- From, uh...

346
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:47,560
Ser... What's his name?

347
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,280
- l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.
- And he didn't have anything to say about it?

348
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,520
He said something.

349
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,040
Well, the odds of me living long enough for him
to retaliate have just dropped drastically.

350
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,320
We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.

351
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,920
Oh, well. (Sighs)

352
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,120
l, uh...
think l'll go and find myself one.

353
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,880
Who are you?

354
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,240
Who would you like me to be?

355
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,960
What did your mother call you?

356
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,040
Shae. What did your mother call you?

357
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,400
My mother died giving birth to me.

358
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:35,000
ls that why l'm here?
So we can talk about our mothers?

359
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,280
- What sort of accent is that?
- Foreign.

360
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,960
For...

361
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:43,160
What do you want from me?

362
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,920
What do l want from you?

363
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:48,880
(Sighs) l want you to share my tent.

364
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,840
l want you to pour my wine,
Iaugh at my jokes,

365
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,400
rub my legs when they're sore
after a day's ride.

366
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,400
l want you to take no other man to bed
for as long as we're together.

367
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:02,880
And l want you to fuck me
like it's my last night in this world.

368
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,920
Which it may well be.

369
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,520
And what do l get?

370
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,160
One - safety.

371
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:12,160
No one will hurt you
for as long as you're mine.

372
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,800
Two - the pleasure of my company,

373
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,400
which l have heard is spectacular.

374
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,600
Who told you this?
Women you paid?

375
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,200
And three...

376
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:26,200
more gold than you can spend
if you lived a thousand years.

377
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,000
Do you accept my proposal?

378
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,000
Let's start with your last night in this world.

379
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:11,600
(Muttering)

380
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,280
(Muttering)

381
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,960
(Jorah) Khaleesi.

382
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,040
Come.

383
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,400
He's very strong.

384
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:32,120
No one understands how strong he is.

385
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:48,200
(Daenerys gasps)

386
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,240
- He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
- He can't.

387
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,880
He can't. l won't let him.

388
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,960
Even a queen doesn't have that power.

389
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,840
We must go quickly.
l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.

390
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,840
- l won't leave him.
- He's already gone, Khaleesi.

391
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,840
Doth...

392
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,600
Even if...

393
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,960
Even if he dies...

394
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,400
why would l run?

395
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:23,880
l am khaleesi, and my...
my son will be khal after Drogo.

396
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
This isn't Westeros, where men honour blood.

397
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,520
Here they only honour strength.
There will be fighting after Drogo dies.

398
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,240
Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal.

399
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:36,280
He won't want any rivals.

400
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,920
Your boy will be plucked from your breast
and given to the dogs.

401
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:44,600
l won't...leave him.

402
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,840
The wound has festered.

403
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,800
You did this witch.

404
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,640
Stop it!

405
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:02,240
l don't want her hurt.

406
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:07,320
No? No?
You don't want her hurt?

407
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:14,960
Pray we don't hurt you, too.
You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.

408
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:18,560
Rein in your tongue.
She is still your Khaleesi.

409
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,360
Only while the blood of my blood lives.

410
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,000
When he dies, she is nothing.

411
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:39,640
l have never been nothing.
l am the blood of the dragon.

412
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,840
The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.

413
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:56,480
l think you should wear
your armour tonight, ser.

414
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,160
l think you're right.

415
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,000
- You've saved me once more.
- And now you must save him.

416
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:10,240
He's beyond the healer's skills.

417
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:12,640
All l can do is ease his path.

418
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,840
Save him and l will free you. l swear it.

419
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,920
You must know a way.

420
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:19,680
Some...

421
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,280
Some magic.

422
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,920
There is a spell.

423
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,160
Some would say death is cleaner.

424
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,280
Do it.

425
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,760
Save him.

426
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,560
- There is a price.
- You'll have gold, whatever you want.

427
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,840
lt's not a matter of gold.
This is bloodmagic.

428
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,880
Only death pays for life.

429
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,720
My death?

430
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:57,480
No, not your death, Khaleesi.

431
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,720
Bring me his horse.

432
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,960
(Whinnying)

433
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,960
Khaleesi, do not do this thing.

434
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:28,240
- Let me kill this witch.
- Kill her and you kill your khal.

435
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:31,160
This is bloodmagic.
It is forbidden.

436
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,720
l am your khaleesi.
l tell you what is forbidden.

437
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,280
(Recites spell)

438
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:45,960
Go. Now.

439
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,880
- Take her and leave.
- Uh-uh.

440
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,120
Take her!

441
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:58,520
You must go also, lady. Once l begin to sing,
no one must enter the tent.

442
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,080
The dead will dance here tonight.

443
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,560
No one will enter.

444
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,960
(Recites spell)

445
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,720
- (Horse thuds)
- Bring him back to me.

446
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,960
(Singing)

447
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,160
What have you done?

448
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,440
l have to save him.

449
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:48,680
We could have been 10 miles
away from here by now, on the way to Asshai.

450
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,680
- You would have been safe.
- (Grunts)

451
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,960
(Demonic shrieking)

452
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,720
(Qotho speaks Dothraki)

453
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:00,040
This must not be.

454
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,600
This must be.

455
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,880
Witch.

456
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,400
(Speaks Dothraki)

457
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:06,680
No, you can't.

458
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,600
- (Grunts)
- Khaleesi!

459
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:12,280
No further, horselord.

460
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,600
(Sobbing)

461
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:16,400
(Singing continues)

462
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,560
Are you hurt?

463
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,600
- The baby...
- Hmm?

464
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,280
..iscoming.

465
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,040
- Fetch the midwives.
- They will not come. They say she is cursed.

466
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,480
They'll come or l'll have their heads.

467
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:03,640
(Groans)

468
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:07,200
The witch - she can bring baby.
l hear her say so.

469
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,440
(Singing, demonic bellowing)

470
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,760
(Singing, bellowing continues)

471
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,280
(Shae) Are you in agony, my lion?

472
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,680
- No.
- You look like you're in agony.

473
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:37,080
The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.

474
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:42,120
- Ah!
- (Laughter)

475
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:46,240
Damn you, woman.
Are you immune to pain?

476
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,320
- Just used to it.
- Drink.

477
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,280
(Tyrion) Let's play a new game.

478
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,200
There's a Braavosi knife game
l could teach you.

479
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:59,280
Does it involve the potential
for losing fingers?

480
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,800
- Not if you win.
- No!

481
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,360
No fire games, no knife games.

482
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,120
- Let's do something l'm good at.
- What are you good at?

483
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,040
l happen to be a great judge of character.

484
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,280
- This sounds like a boring game.
- It's not.

485
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,320
Here's how it works -
l make a statement about your past.

486
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,440
lf l'm right, you drink.
If l'm wrong, l drink.

487
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,320
And no lying.
l'll know if you're lying.

488
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,200
l don't want to play this game.

489
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,160
Fine. Bronn first.

490
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,360
Your father beat you.

491
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,720
But my mother hit harder.

492
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,400
You killed your first man
before you were 12.

493
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,240
lt was a woman.

494
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,680
She swung an axe at me.

495
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,880
You've been north of the Wall.

496
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,760
What brought you up there?

497
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,000
- Work.
- And...

498
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,320
you once loved a woman many years ago,
but it turned out badly

499
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,160
so you've never let yourself love again.

500
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,200
Oh, wait, that's me.

501
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,960
Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.

502
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,560
l don't want to play.

503
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:25,280
lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having.

504
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:30,680
Your mother was a whore.

505
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:32,760
Drink.

506
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:41,080
All right.

507
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,440
Your father left the family when
you were very young, never to return.

508
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:45,680
Drink.

509
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,560
- And we've established the rules about lying?
- Drink!

510
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,280
- (Bronn pours)
- Mm.

511
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:58,160
You wanted a dimerent life.

512
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,880
You came from somewhere
and you wanted to be elsewhere.

513
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,560
The whole shit-stained world
could drink om that one.

514
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:05,680
So, specifics...

515
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,120
You wanted to be elsewhere,
but how would you get there?

516
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:12,840
l don't believe the life
of the Silent Sisters is for you.

517
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,480
So...what's a lowborn girl to do?

518
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,200
Drink.

519
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,560
- Are you sure...
- Drink!

520
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,560
And don't talk about
my mother and father ever,

521
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:37,080
or l will carve your eyes from your head.

522
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,200
My dear lady,
if l have offended you, l apologise.

523
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,240
My turn.

524
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,320
Fine, fine.

525
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,840
Ask away.

526
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:53,480
Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.

527
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:56,400
- Who were you in love with?
- That's not how the game works.

528
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,760
l don't care the way the game works.

529
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,760
Our lord here used to be married.

530
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,720
- Married?
- How did you hear that?

531
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,000
You hear lots of things
playing dice with Lannister soldiers.

532
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,960
Another night, perhaps.

533
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:14,000
Not another night. This night.

534
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,040
lt's not a pleasant story.

535
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,440
Oh, maybe l will cry.

536
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:24,880
l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more
unpleasant stories than your lordship.

537
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,920
So...

538
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:37,680
l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding,
when we heard a scream.

539
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,080
She ran out onto the road,
clothes half torn om, with two men on her heels.

540
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:46,480
Jaime scared away the men easily enough,
while l wrapped her in my cloak.

541
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,320
She was too scared to send om on her own,

542
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,240
so while Jaime hunted down the rapers
l took her to the nearest inn and fed her.

543
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,680
Her name was Tysha.

544
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,880
She was a wheelwright's orphan.

545
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,080
And she was hungry.

546
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:03,320
Together we finished om three chickens
and a flagon of wine.

547
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,440
lmpossible as it seems, there was a time
when l was unaccustomed to wine.

548
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,520
l forgot how afraid l was around girls...

549
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:13,880
how l was always waiting
for them to laugh at me or...

550
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,200
look away embarrassed,

551
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,920
or ask me about my tall, handsome brother.

552
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:20,280
l forgot about everything but Tysha.

553
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,160
And somehow l found myself in her bed.

554
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,040
For three chickens, l should hope so.

555
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:30,080
lt didn't last long.
l didn't know what the hell l was doing.

556
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:32,440
But she was good to me.

557
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,440
She kissed me afteM/ards and...

558
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,840
San9 me a SOn9.

559
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,760
And by morning
l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand.

560
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:45,000
A few lies, a few gold coins,
one drunken septon

561
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:47,200
and there you have it - man and wife.

562
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,960
For a fortnight anyway,
until the septon sobered up and told my father.

563
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:55,480
Well, l imagine that was the end of all that.

564
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:57,000
Not quite.

565
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,960
First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth.

566
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,920
The girl was a whore, you see.

567
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:11,360
Jaime had arranged the whole thing -
the road, the rapers...all of it.

568
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,840
He thought it was time l had a woman.

569
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,840
After my brother confessed...

570
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,880
my father brought in my wife

571
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,840
and gave her to his guards.

572
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,920
He paid her well -
a silver for each man.

573
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:29,800
How many whores command
that kind of price?

574
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:34,880
He brought me into the barracks
and made me watch.

575
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,200
By the end, she had so much silver

576
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,800
that the coins were slipping through her fingers
and rolling on to the floor.

577
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:49,400
l would have killed the man
who did that to me.

578
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,360
You should have known she was a whore.

579
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:54,240
Really?

580
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:57,440
l was 16, drunk and in love.

581
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:02,680
A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite
another man into her bed two hours later.

582
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:07,120
As l said, l was young and stupid.

583
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:11,840
You are still young and stupid.

584
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:22,160
(Kissing)

585
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,480
(Galloping hoofbeats)

586
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:36,400
Hyah!

587
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,240
(Horse neighs)

588
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:46,880
(Distant shouting)

589
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:52,240
(Clattering)

590
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,680
- What is it? What do you want?
- You're sleeping through the war.

591
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,400
- What?
- They stole a night's march on us.

592
00:40:58,519 --> 00:40:59,960
They're a mile north.

593
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:03,040
- Get my squire!
- You don't have a squire.

594
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,240
lf l die, weep for me.

595
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,360
You'll be dead.
How will you know?

596
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,280
l'll know.

597
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,880
Watch out! Move!

598
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,520
Out of the way!

599
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:27,440
- Move aside!
- (Neighing)

600
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:35,040
Stay low.

601
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:37,480
Stay low?

602
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,840
lf you're lucky, no one will notice you.

603
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,720
l was born lucky.

604
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,000
Tribesmen of the Vale,

605
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,360
gather round!

606
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:52,320
Stone Crows!

607
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,520
Black Ears!
Burned Men!

608
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:57,160
- Moon Brothers!
- (Man) And Painted Dogs!

609
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:59,960
- And Painted Dogs!
- (Men) Painted Dogs!

610
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,840
Your dominion over the Vale begins now!

611
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,680
Onward, to claim what is yours!

612
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,760
Half man! Half man!

613
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,080
(All) Half man! Half man!

614
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:13,680
Half man! Half man!

615
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,560
To battle!

616
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,880
(Yelling)

617
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,640
(Horse neighing, echoes)

618
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,480
(Mumled shouts)

619
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:53,280
(Wagon rumbling)

620
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,800
(Bronn) You're a shit warrior.

621
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:02,520
l'm alive?

622
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,920
You're alive.

623
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:11,680
Did we win?

624
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,320
We wouldn't be having
this conversation if we didn't.

625
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,120
(Screaming)

626
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,200
(Blades slashing)
(Men screaming)

627
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,120
How did our tribesmen do?

628
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,560
Yeah, good.

629
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,720
(Tyrion) It's nice to see them getting along.
(Tywin) You're wounded.

630
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,720
Good of you to notice.

631
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:42,760
l hear we won.

632
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,320
Huh! The scouts were wrong.

633
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:48,920
There were 2,OOO Stark bannermen, not 20.

634
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,000
Did we get the Stark boy, at least?

635
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:53,480
He wasn't here.

636
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,960
Where was he?

637
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,320
With his other 18,OOO men.

638
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,920
And where are they?

639
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:15,480
- We should go, my lady.
- No!

640
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:21,960
My lady!

641
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,200
- (Neighing)
- Hyah! Hyah!

642
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:55,960
(Pants, grunts)

643
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:00,040
By the time they knew what was happening,
it had already happened.

644
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,200
Lady Stark. l'd omer you my sword,
but l seem to have lost it.

645
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,160
lt is not your sword l want.

646
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:12,160
Give me my daughters back.

647
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,040
Give me my husband.

648
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,520
l've lost them too, l'm afraid.

649
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:19,000
(Theon) Kill him, Robb.
Send his head to his father.

650
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,720
- He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.
- He's more use to us alive than dead.

651
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,760
(Catelyn) Take him away and put him in irons.

652
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,280
We could end this war right now, boy,

653
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,320
save thousands of lives.

654
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,200
You fight for the Starks,
l fight for the Lannisters.

655
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,200
Swords or lances, teeth, nails -

656
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,880
choose your weapons
and let's end this here and now.

657
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,320
lf we do it your way, kingslayer...

658
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,000
you'd win.

659
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,480
We're not doing it your way.

660
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,080
(Greatjon) Come on, pretty man.

661
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:56,760
(Laughter, cheering)

662
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:08,280
- l sent 2,000 men to their graves today.
- The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.

663
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,280
Aye. But the dead won't hear them.

664
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,600
One victory does not make us conquerors.

665
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,360
Did we free my father?

666
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,720
Did we rescue my sisters from the queen?

667
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:32,600
Did we free the North from those
who want us on our knees?

668
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,920
This war is far from over.

669
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:52,920
(Bell tolling)

670
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,480
Could l have one?

671
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,320
A lemon one...or any of them.

672
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,000
Three coppers.

673
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,280
- How about a nice fat pigeon?
- Oh, piss om now. Go on.

674
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,040
Do you have any stale ones from yesterday?
Or any burnt ones?

675
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:24,600
Piss om!

676
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:33,600
Hey, where's everyone going?
What's happening?

677
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:35,800
- They're taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
- Who?

678
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,760
The Hand of the King.

679
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,440
(Crowd clamouring)

680
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,760
(Clamouring intensifies)

681
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,000
(Jeering)

682
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,560
- Traitor!
- Coward!

683
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:46,600
(Ned mutters) Baelor.

684
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:47,880
Baelor!

685
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,960
Traitor! Traitor!

686
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:07,920
(Crowd quietens)

687
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,360
l am Eddard Stark...

688
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,400
Lord of Winterfell...

689
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:21,760
and Hand of the King.

690
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:32,960
l come before you to confess my treason...

691
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:35,920
in the sight of gods and men.

692
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,440
l betrayed the faith of my king...

693
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,440
and the trust of my friend Robert.

694
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,160
l swore to protect and defend his children.

695
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,040
But before his blood was cold...

696
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,680
l plotted to murder his son...

697
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,160
and seize the throne for myself.

698
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,600
(Jeering, clamouring)

699
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:10,800
Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed
bear witness to what l say...

700
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:15,720
Joffrey Baratheon...

701
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,840
is the one true heir to the Iron Throne...

702
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:22,200
by the grace of all the gods,

703
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,480
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms...

704
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:26,640
and Protector of the Realm.

705
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,840
(Crowd jeering)

706
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,200
(Gasps)

707
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,640
As... As we sin...

708
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,040
so do we sumer.

709
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:41,080
This man has confessed his crimes...

710
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:43,560
in sight of gods and men.

711
00:50:44,199 --> 00:50:46,680
The gods are just...

712
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,120
but beloved Baelor taught us...

713
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,600
they can also be merciful.

714
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,840
What is to be done
with this traitor, Your Grace?

715
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,520
(Jeering, catcalls)

716
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:07,480
My mother wishes me
to let Lord Eddard join the Night's Watch.

717
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:12,720
Stripped of all titles and powers,
he would serve the realm in permanent exile.

718
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,720
And my Lady Sansa...
has begged mercy for her father.

719
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,520
But they have the soft hearts of women.

720
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,640
So long as l am your king...

721
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,440
treason shall never go unpunished.

722
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,640
Ser Ilyn...

723
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,000
bring me his head!

724
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:36,120
- No!
- (Crowd roars)

725
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:38,000
Someone stop him!

726
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,720
My son, this is madness.

727
00:51:51,639 --> 00:51:52,880
(Slynt) Put him down!

728
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,160
- Don't look!
- Let me go! Let me go!

729
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,720
Shut your mouth!
Look at me! Look at me!

730
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,200
Stop! Daddy! Stop!

731
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,120
- No! No!
- (Crowd) Traitor!

732
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:10,480
(Sansa) Stop!

733
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,480
Stop him! Stop!

734
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,480
(Clamouring fades)

735
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,040
(Breathes slowly)

736
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:44,920
(Wings fluttering)
