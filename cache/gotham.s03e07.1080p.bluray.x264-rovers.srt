1
00:00:02,124 --> 00:00:03,456
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:03,492 --> 00:00:06,097
You are a cop in everything but name.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,940
Saving Gotham's not my job anymore.

4
00:00:07,976 --> 00:00:09,275
If a person comes into contact

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,135
with my blood, it changes them.

6
00:00:11,193 --> 00:00:13,136
It affects every person differently.

7
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,241
I won! They really want me as mayor.

8
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:16,464
How did you know I would win?

9
00:00:16,499 --> 00:00:18,165
I believe in you, Oswald.

10
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:19,634
Even when you don't believe in yourself.

11
00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:20,901
Miss Kringle?

12
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,336
No, my name's Isabella.

13
00:00:22,372 --> 00:00:23,671
You remind me of someone.

14
00:00:23,706 --> 00:00:24,705
I'm Edward.

15
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:25,706
Nygma.

16
00:00:25,742 --> 00:00:27,308
The past is the past.

17
00:00:27,343 --> 00:00:29,210
I know that we can't change the past,

18
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:31,670
but there's a difference between
moving on and letting go.

19
00:00:31,716 --> 00:00:33,681
Who... do you love?

20
00:00:33,716 --> 00:00:35,349
Or I shoot both them,

21
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:37,985
which would be such a thrill.

22
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:39,596
Kill Lee.

23
00:00:48,354 --> 00:00:49,930
I'm so sorry this happened.

24
00:00:54,904 --> 00:00:57,371
Stop the press.

25
00:00:58,456 --> 00:01:00,841
Tough guy Jim Gordon

26
00:01:01,255 --> 00:01:03,577
sheds tear for Valerie Vale.

27
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,774
How you feeling?

28
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:12,286
Like a bullet went through my insides.

29
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:14,121
You don't have any whiskey, do you?

30
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,924
- Sorry.
- You get a girl shot

31
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:19,166
and you don't even bring her booze.

32
00:01:20,134 --> 00:01:22,313
You got a lot of nerve.

33
00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:25,701
I never meant for you to get hurt.

34
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:28,286
You did.

35
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:31,522
You wanted to save Lee.

36
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,724
I wanted to save you both.

37
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:36,627
Yeah, but you could only save one of us.

38
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,029
That's why you told Tetch

39
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:42,266
to kill Lee because you knew
he would do the opposite.

40
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,770
Oldest trick in the book.

41
00:01:46,336 --> 00:01:48,272
At least tell me you caught him.

42
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,467
He's still in the wind. Listen.

43
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,387
- Vale, it's not what you think.
- It is.

44
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:58,934
You love Lee.

45
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,823
Which means we're done.

46
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:16,200
- If there's anything I can do...
- No.

47
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,102
No, Tetch was right.

48
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:20,433
You're nothing but trouble.

49
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,051
So...

50
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,553
let me get this straight.

51
00:02:36,162 --> 00:02:38,856
You're about to be in
possession of some kind of...

52
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,491
virus?

53
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:42,660
Yes.

54
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:46,030
It's blood-based and can
be a little unpredictable.

55
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:49,133
It can take weeks for
symptoms to manifest.

56
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,202
Oh!

57
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:54,272
This...

58
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,340
is an accelerant.

59
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,541
Mix it with the blood...

60
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,577
wham... bam...

61
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:01,245
That virus'll hit 'em like a semi

62
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,047
going 90.

63
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,421
"The Red Queen."

64
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:13,925
She's a blend of psychotropic plants.

65
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,293
Ah, thought she'd be a big hit.

66
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,394
Turns out, she's only good

67
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,296
at putting people in the loony bin.

68
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,031
- I'll take her!
- Ah-ah-ah, b-b...

69
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,033
That stuff's... no joke.

70
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,769
At first, it incapacitates you. Then...

71
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,570
an hour into the trip...

72
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,105
it completely fries your brain.

73
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,273
Perfect.

74
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,275
I'm looking to sideline someone

75
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,477
before this evening's event.

76
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,846
That'll do it.

77
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,582
Hey, uh, what exactly are you...

78
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,818
planning?

79
00:03:47,455 --> 00:03:50,828
This city tore my love from me,

80
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:54,765
so I'm plunging it into insanity.

81
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,945
And that's where I
discovered my love of books.

82
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,681
I never thought a fractured tibia

83
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:11,949
would launch my library career.

84
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,851
But it did. Fun fact:

85
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:16,487
The tibia is the second-largest
bone in the body.

86
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,189
Second only to the femur.

87
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,927
You have exquisite femurs.

88
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,403
Morning!

89
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,071
The morning paper.

90
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,639
What time is it?

91
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,541
Oh, uh... it's just past 6:00.

92
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,748
Uh, Edward...

93
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:48,486
These past 12 hours have
been the best of my life.

94
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,261
When can we meet again?

95
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:54,792
What can't you have
for breakfast or lunch?

96
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:57,762
Dinner. I'd love to.

97
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:58,863
Delightful.

98
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,464
Meet me at the mayor's mansion at 8:00.

99
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,053
I understand that one is expected

100
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,256
to wait 24 hours before filing
a missing persons report,

101
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,224
but, sir, I am the mayor.

102
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,074
Oswald.

103
00:05:29,143 --> 00:05:31,062
I am so sorry.

104
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,631
When you didn't come home,

105
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,966
I assumed the worst.

106
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,803
I am so glad you're okay.

107
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,071
I'm better than okay.

108
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,640
I met someone.

109
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,744
I think I'm in love.

110
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,926
Hey! Hey, you can't be down here.

111
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,629
Oh, I disagree.

112
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:19,910
I don't understand why
we're doing all this, boss.

113
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,580
Wasn't plugging Gordon's
girlfriend enough?

114
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,548
Jim Gordon wasn't the
only one responsible

115
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,997
for my sister's death.

116
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:29,920
Gotham ripped Alice from my loving arms

117
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,789
and turned her against me.

118
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,824
What better way

119
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,426
to make this city pay

120
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:39,697
than by spreading my dear,
dead sister's legacy?

121
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:49,125
Oh, Alice...

122
00:07:11,252 --> 00:07:13,218
Well. It's quite the operation

123
00:07:13,252 --> 00:07:15,585
you've got going on in here,
isn't it, Master Bruce?

124
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:17,587
Do you need a hand?

125
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:19,222
I got it.

126
00:07:19,258 --> 00:07:21,057
Right.

127
00:07:21,093 --> 00:07:23,401
What time can we expect Ms. Kyle?

128
00:07:23,447 --> 00:07:25,228
6:00, I think.

129
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:26,730
We'll see, won't we?

130
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:29,299
She's coming, Alfred.

131
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:32,302
And, uh, Alfred...

132
00:07:32,337 --> 00:07:34,170
Yes, yes. I know, uh...

133
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:35,605
I'll make myself scarce,

134
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:38,275
I'll give you all the
privacy that you need.

135
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,609
Within earshot.

136
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,346
And the lights on.

137
00:07:51,854 --> 00:07:54,155
Well, I got bad news and worse.

138
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,923
Skip the preamble.

139
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,058
It was definitely Tetch
and his two dum-dums.

140
00:07:58,094 --> 00:08:00,761
And? What about Alice's body?

141
00:08:00,796 --> 00:08:03,297
The eggheads here have had her
body on ice since it arrived.

142
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:05,666
Her blood's frozen, but still viable.

143
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:07,401
The second Tetch heats it up...

144
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:10,070
He has himself the virus.

145
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:11,919
How the hell did he even get in here?

146
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:13,393
The old-fashioned way.

147
00:08:13,462 --> 00:08:15,409
Somebody let him in. I got
an unconscious lab tech

148
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:16,810
and a missing guard.

149
00:08:16,846 --> 00:08:19,547
My money's on the guard.

150
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,048
Shouldn't you be in
the hospital with Vale?

151
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:22,770
She's fine. Give me the rundown.

152
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:25,539
Oh, so I take it you're
rejoining the force?

153
00:08:25,574 --> 00:08:27,274
I just want to help.

154
00:08:27,309 --> 00:08:29,576
There's no reason I need
to be a cop to do that.

155
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:31,979
Well, as long as I'm
captain of the GCPD you do.

156
00:08:32,014 --> 00:08:34,448
I'm tired of giving you slack.

157
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:36,417
Get the hell off my crime scene

158
00:08:36,452 --> 00:08:38,585
before I throw you ass in lockup.

159
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:41,388
Biehl, Alban,

160
00:08:41,424 --> 00:08:44,191
escort Mr. Gordon off of the premises.

161
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:47,127
If he resists, book him for obstruction.

162
00:08:47,163 --> 00:08:49,463
I'll go on my own.

163
00:08:52,368 --> 00:08:53,434
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Uh-uh!

164
00:08:53,469 --> 00:08:54,835
No. I see that look in your eye.

165
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,037
Do not try to solve this by yourself.

166
00:08:57,072 --> 00:08:58,806
Then help me. If Tetch
has Alice's blood,

167
00:08:58,841 --> 00:09:00,174
we don't have much time.

168
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:02,443
No, I'm not gonna aid
you on one of your solo,

169
00:09:02,478 --> 00:09:04,278
bullcrap, kamikaze missions anymore!

170
00:09:04,313 --> 00:09:05,913
Tetch murdered four people yesterday.

171
00:09:05,948 --> 00:09:07,948
He shot Vale... I can't just
let him get away with it.

172
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:10,150
Nobody's asking you to.
But Barnes is right.

173
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:12,986
Either be a cop, or don't.

174
00:09:13,022 --> 00:09:14,621
What are you so afraid of?

175
00:09:14,657 --> 00:09:16,316
Is that what you think?

176
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,059
That I'm afraid?

177
00:09:19,094 --> 00:09:21,395
You know, you should go to the hospital.

178
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,729
Be with Vale.

179
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:24,965
And let those of us who
want to wear the badge

180
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,668
do our damn jobs.

181
00:09:31,974 --> 00:09:34,374
You are going to cut
quite the fine figure

182
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,976
at the Founders' dinner tonight.

183
00:09:36,011 --> 00:09:38,979
Yes. Did you know that this dinner

184
00:09:39,014 --> 00:09:42,249
has been thrown annually
for over 200 years?

185
00:09:42,284 --> 00:09:44,651
It was started by the
first families of Gotham.

186
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:47,698
Only the most powerful
citizens are invited.

187
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:51,425
It's a shame I don't have a "plus one."

188
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,357
I can't go anyway. I have a date.

189
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,363
With the woman you
claim to be in love with

190
00:09:56,398 --> 00:09:58,131
after only knowing for a few hours?

191
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:00,133
The heart keeps its own time.

192
00:10:02,872 --> 00:10:04,137
I'm partial to the purple.

193
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:07,441
The brocade brings out my eyes.

194
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:12,079
Are you sure you aren't
mistaking infatuation for love?

195
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:14,047
You did say she is the
spitting image of Kringle.

196
00:10:15,718 --> 00:10:17,223
Isabella's beautiful.

197
00:10:17,545 --> 00:10:19,019
And smart.

198
00:10:19,777 --> 00:10:23,657
So she... bears a passing
resemblance to Kristin.

199
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:25,459
It's just the universe telling me...

200
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:27,908
Telling me I have a
second chance at love.

201
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,698
Where did you say she works?

202
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:34,101
The Main Public Library.

203
00:10:34,136 --> 00:10:35,502
You're right about the brocade.

204
00:10:35,538 --> 00:10:37,871
Do you mind if I skedaddle?

205
00:10:37,907 --> 00:10:40,073
I just need to pick up a
few things for tonight.

206
00:10:42,077 --> 00:10:44,144
Who am I to stand in the way of love?

207
00:10:52,388 --> 00:10:55,055
The missing guard from the
lab, he called in sick.

208
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,688
My gut says he's lying.

209
00:10:56,745 --> 00:10:59,359
Well, he's certainly no
candidate for sainthood.

210
00:10:59,395 --> 00:11:00,627
Gambling, petty theft...

211
00:11:00,663 --> 00:11:02,796
Might I have a word, Captain?

212
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:04,498
Bring him in.

213
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:05,899
What is it?

214
00:11:05,935 --> 00:11:07,434
I just heard from the head of virology

215
00:11:07,469 --> 00:11:08,835
at the Biomedical facility.

216
00:11:08,871 --> 00:11:11,071
Is this about the tests they're
running on Alice Tetch's blood?

217
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:12,039
Yes, in the first trial...

218
00:11:12,074 --> 00:11:14,074
One of the rats ran off the rails
and murdered the rest, I know.

219
00:11:14,109 --> 00:11:15,876
Doc Thompkins told me.

220
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:18,211
But she thought it might
have been an anomaly.

221
00:11:18,247 --> 00:11:20,180
I'm afraid the second
study proves otherwise.

222
00:11:20,215 --> 00:11:22,082
As in the first study, the rats showed

223
00:11:22,117 --> 00:11:24,184
increased strength and agility, but...

224
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:26,620
by week two...

225
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:28,221
the rats were exhibiting
manic tendencies.

226
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:30,223
Violent rage.

227
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:32,225
By the study's end, every trace of their

228
00:11:32,261 --> 00:11:33,727
original demeanor had vanished.

229
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,297
I assume they're, uh, working on a cure.

230
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,566
Yes, but it could take years.

231
00:11:39,602 --> 00:11:41,234
And we only have hours.

232
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,603
Damn it!

233
00:11:42,638 --> 00:11:45,038
If this virus gets set free...

234
00:11:47,676 --> 00:11:49,610
We have to find Tetch, now.

235
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:50,877
Yes, sir.

236
00:12:01,824 --> 00:12:04,324
Watch closely, Dumfree.

237
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,660
Isn't science marvelous?

238
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,430
Gravity, a few heaters...

239
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:11,932
and voila !

240
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:15,402
The last drops of coagulated blood

241
00:12:15,437 --> 00:12:17,504
become cocktail mix.

242
00:12:24,246 --> 00:12:25,712
Ah!

243
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:27,848
Bravo, Alice.

244
00:12:28,404 --> 00:12:32,519
Truly... your best work.

245
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:44,613
- You're kidding me?
- Please, calm down.

246
00:12:44,648 --> 00:12:47,198
- He said, "Kill Lee"?
- He knew Tetch wouldn't.

247
00:12:47,221 --> 00:12:48,254
How?

248
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:49,822
How could he possibly have known that?

249
00:12:49,857 --> 00:12:52,725
Somehow he got inside Tetch's head.

250
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,687
And he knew that he would do the
opposite of what he told him to.

251
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:57,694
I see. So, why would Gordon offer up

252
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,174
the woman he's dating
in place of my fiancée?

253
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:01,609
Mario, stop it.

254
00:13:01,644 --> 00:13:02,943
We have so much to be thankful for.

255
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:04,745
I just want to move past this.

256
00:13:05,815 --> 00:13:07,581
Fine.

257
00:13:07,617 --> 00:13:09,049
But Jim Gordon's the reason

258
00:13:09,085 --> 00:13:10,451
you were in danger to begin with.

259
00:13:10,486 --> 00:13:12,319
I want him out of our lives.

260
00:13:12,355 --> 00:13:14,255
Of course.

261
00:13:20,596 --> 00:13:23,395
I came by to bring this to... Vale.

262
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:28,402
I got to get back to the ER.

263
00:13:41,851 --> 00:13:43,350
He's angry.

264
00:13:43,386 --> 00:13:45,656
I get that.

265
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:48,322
He has every reason to be.

266
00:13:48,357 --> 00:13:51,025
I figured you'd be out
chasing down Tetch.

267
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,688
Barnes banned me.

268
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:55,429
No badge. No investigation.

269
00:13:55,464 --> 00:13:57,531
That's never stopped you before.

270
00:13:57,566 --> 00:13:59,633
They closed ranks.

271
00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:00,834
Even Bullock.

272
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:05,543
He says I'm refusing the
badge because I'm afraid.

273
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,211
Jim... I know what you did

274
00:14:11,247 --> 00:14:13,013
last night.

275
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:16,242
When you told Tetch to kill me,
you knew he would shoot Vale.

276
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,154
No, I'm sorry. That's not true.

277
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,457
At least have the decency
to be honest with me.

278
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:24,858
I am being honest.

279
00:14:24,894 --> 00:14:27,227
I wanted to save Vale.

280
00:14:28,698 --> 00:14:30,230
Bullock was right.

281
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:31,999
You are afraid.

282
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,353
Hello, there.

283
00:14:55,445 --> 00:14:57,224
Mr. Mayor, what an honor.

284
00:14:57,259 --> 00:14:58,559
How can I help you?

285
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:01,528
I am attending the Founders'
dinner this evening

286
00:15:01,564 --> 00:15:04,264
and I wanted to brush up on the history

287
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,532
of Gotham's first families.

288
00:15:05,568 --> 00:15:08,594
My chief of staff suggested I come here.

289
00:15:09,372 --> 00:15:11,372
I think you might know him.

290
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:14,208
Yes. I know Edward.

291
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:15,876
We just met,

292
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:18,245
but...

293
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,115
well, I feel I've known
him my whole life.

294
00:15:22,585 --> 00:15:24,551
How romantic.

295
00:15:24,587 --> 00:15:26,854
Oh, listen to me, blathering on.

296
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:28,288
You wanted a book.

297
00:15:28,324 --> 00:15:29,423
Um...

298
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:30,824
Oh.

299
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,826
I'm...

300
00:15:32,862 --> 00:15:34,728
so glad you appreciate Ed.

301
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:42,391
Really, I should thank you
for brightening Ed's spirits.

302
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:48,008
He has been so down since
he got out of Arkham.

303
00:15:52,948 --> 00:15:55,182
Edward... was in Arkham?

304
00:15:56,127 --> 00:15:57,451
You don't know?

305
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:00,988
It was front page news.

306
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,856
I stick to books.

307
00:16:02,892 --> 00:16:06,794
Don't people typically
go to Arkham for murder?

308
00:16:07,863 --> 00:16:09,897
I make it a policy not to gossip

309
00:16:09,932 --> 00:16:11,503
about staff, but...

310
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,663
Uncanny how much you look like her.

311
00:16:28,551 --> 00:16:31,452
It's that swan-like neck.

312
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,822
Ed loves a neck.

313
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,793
Well, thank you for the book.

314
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:42,596
It was a pleasure meeting you.

315
00:17:07,423 --> 00:17:08,989
Hey.

316
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:10,724
Hey!

317
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:11,859
Hey!

318
00:17:13,362 --> 00:17:16,430
The tea party was part one.

319
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:18,665
I want to have a lot more fun.

320
00:17:25,474 --> 00:17:27,541
I had my way with you.

321
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,445
Now Gotham's up for round two.

322
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,807
The hell are you talking about?

323
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:37,050
Why, I'm going to dismantle
your beloved city,

324
00:17:37,086 --> 00:17:40,597
from the top... on down.

325
00:17:45,675 --> 00:17:48,262
And you can't stop me.

326
00:17:49,832 --> 00:17:51,737
Enjoy the trip.

327
00:17:52,735 --> 00:17:55,125
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

328
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:02,313
There you are.

329
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,050
So good to see you.

330
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,185
Likewise.

331
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,653
Come on, let's get some wine.

332
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,064
Watch where you're going.

333
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:23,635
Of course, Mr. Mayor.

334
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,570
So sorry.

335
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,172
Cretin.

336
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,267
Jim.

337
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,738
Jim.

338
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,154
Jim!

339
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:07,378
Finally, sleeping beauty stirs.

340
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,081
Where am I?

341
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:11,549
You got dosed, buttercup.

342
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,351
Welcome to your hallucination.

343
00:19:16,395 --> 00:19:19,057
- What are you doing in it?
- Hell if I know.

344
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:22,560
Now, we've got a lot
to be getting on with.

345
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:23,661
I don't have time for this.

346
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,800
See, that's the thing about
hallucinations, Jimbo.

347
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,868
You got to ride out the trip.

348
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:32,739
Bummer, huh?

349
00:19:37,215 --> 00:19:39,649
What exactly does this trip entail?

350
00:19:39,684 --> 00:19:42,185
Well, no one gave me an itinerary,

351
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,454
but knowing what goes
on inside your head,

352
00:19:44,489 --> 00:19:46,089
I'm sure it'll be
chock-full of belly laughs.

353
00:19:47,726 --> 00:19:48,925
Just kidding.

354
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,828
We all know fun isn't your forte.

355
00:19:54,032 --> 00:19:56,499
This is where I face
my inner demons, huh?

356
00:19:56,535 --> 00:19:58,735
That's up to you.

357
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,874
Well, go on.

358
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,844
Unless you want to stay in
this tiny space with me.

359
00:20:08,563 --> 00:20:10,446
I'll take my chances.

360
00:20:19,324 --> 00:20:21,591
Jim.

361
00:20:21,626 --> 00:20:23,059
Jim.

362
00:20:26,264 --> 00:20:28,097
Jim.

363
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:31,334
Jim.

364
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:34,637
Bruce?

365
00:20:34,673 --> 00:20:36,573
You don't have much time.

366
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:38,374
What are you talking about?

367
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,463
You don't have much time.

368
00:20:40,486 --> 00:20:41,911
Bruce.

369
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:43,316
Bruce!

370
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:52,121
Where did Bruce go?

371
00:21:01,132 --> 00:21:01,965
What?

372
00:21:03,602 --> 00:21:06,769
Never leave your unit behind.

373
00:21:09,574 --> 00:21:11,641
I have to find him.

374
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:20,550
Bruce. Bruce!

375
00:21:24,723 --> 00:21:26,189
I'm glad you came.

376
00:21:26,224 --> 00:21:29,993
What did you mean when you
said I didn't have much time?

377
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:32,295
I just wanted you to follow me...

378
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,830
so I could show you that.

379
00:21:36,468 --> 00:21:37,433
Down there.

380
00:21:39,704 --> 00:21:41,337
It's because of you.

381
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:46,242
Congratulations, Jim.

382
00:21:46,277 --> 00:21:47,477
You did it.

383
00:21:47,512 --> 00:21:49,746
You're the hero you
always dreamed of being.

384
00:21:51,016 --> 00:21:52,461
Bruce...

385
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,950
Don't...

386
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:22,879
Your name was on the schedule.

387
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:25,715
Yeah, I told you. It was my
shift at the bio lab, but I...

388
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,650
- came down with something.
- The only thing you're coming down

389
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:30,337
with, pal, is ten years at Blackgate.

390
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:31,721
Hey, hey, hey.

391
00:22:31,756 --> 00:22:34,223
That's no way to treat a sick man.

392
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:35,873
Listen, Sullivan,

393
00:22:36,011 --> 00:22:38,628
Tetch got in using an
employee's key card.

394
00:22:38,663 --> 00:22:40,329
Just show us your card,
and you're free to go.

395
00:22:40,365 --> 00:22:41,898
Screw you.

396
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:43,433
I want a lawyer.

397
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:49,605
You pigs think you're such tough guys...

398
00:22:51,342 --> 00:22:54,677
Honest citizens driven mad,

399
00:22:54,713 --> 00:22:56,779
tearing each other limb from limb

400
00:22:56,815 --> 00:22:59,849
just because you decided
that this city's security

401
00:22:59,884 --> 00:23:02,285
is not your concern!

402
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,320
Tell us what you know
about Jervis Tetch!

403
00:23:04,355 --> 00:23:06,155
Tell us what you know
about Jervis Tetch!

404
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:07,857
- Captain! Cap.
- Aah...

405
00:23:07,892 --> 00:23:08,991
Cap! Hey.

406
00:23:09,027 --> 00:23:11,694
I thought I was supposed
to be the bad cop here.

407
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,496
A bruiser in a wrestling mask

408
00:23:13,531 --> 00:23:16,165
paid me to hand over my key
card and take the day off.

409
00:23:16,201 --> 00:23:18,334
Promised I wouldn't get in trouble.

410
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:21,671
Said the cops would be too busy
taking back control of the city.

411
00:23:21,706 --> 00:23:23,406
And?

412
00:23:23,441 --> 00:23:25,174
Tell us something that
might actually help.

413
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,377
He was driving a catering van.

414
00:23:28,413 --> 00:23:30,113
Why would the Tweeds
need a catering van?

415
00:23:30,148 --> 00:23:31,848
Wait.

416
00:23:31,883 --> 00:23:33,216
What's the date?

417
00:23:33,251 --> 00:23:34,751
Friday.

418
00:23:34,786 --> 00:23:37,019
The date.

419
00:23:37,055 --> 00:23:38,588
The 27th.

420
00:23:38,656 --> 00:23:40,623
The Founders' dinner.

421
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:42,492
The archbishop, the
comptroller, the mayor,

422
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,060
all in the same place.

423
00:23:44,095 --> 00:23:46,763
Put together a unit.

424
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:49,398
And not a word to Gordon.

425
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,673
A drop of blood

426
00:23:57,709 --> 00:24:00,376
in each wine glass

427
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:02,678
makes madmen...

428
00:24:02,714 --> 00:24:05,248
of the ruling class.

429
00:24:24,068 --> 00:24:26,169
What the hell are you doing?

430
00:24:26,204 --> 00:24:28,571
Saving your life. Like you wanted.

431
00:24:28,606 --> 00:24:31,607
The last thing I want is
your lips on my mouth.

432
00:24:31,643 --> 00:24:32,909
News flash.

433
00:24:32,944 --> 00:24:34,443
Everything that is happening

434
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:35,645
is in your head.

435
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,513
Which means you made me give you CPR.

436
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:38,881
Just like you put me

437
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:41,951
in this really cheesy nurse's uniform.

438
00:24:41,986 --> 00:24:43,886
That's easily rectified.

439
00:24:44,956 --> 00:24:47,256
Seriously?

440
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:49,559
One bad encounter with Bruce, and...

441
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:50,960
I don't want to talk about it.

442
00:24:50,995 --> 00:24:53,296
Fine. Just don't fall into
a monosyllabic depression

443
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:55,631
because...

444
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:57,200
We're at the next stop.

445
00:24:57,235 --> 00:25:00,336
I have mixed feelings about this floor.

446
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,307
I'm afraid to ask.

447
00:25:17,755 --> 00:25:19,722
I'm so glad you're home.

448
00:25:19,757 --> 00:25:21,657
Mom thought you were gonna be late.

449
00:25:21,693 --> 00:25:23,559
Ha! Mom owes me a quarter.

450
00:25:23,595 --> 00:25:25,261
Mom!

451
00:25:25,296 --> 00:25:28,164
We made a bet that you
were gonna be late.

452
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:30,535
Frankie had more faith than I did.

453
00:25:30,604 --> 00:25:31,634
Now go on.

454
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:33,436
Take those rolls to the table.

455
00:25:35,373 --> 00:25:37,490
How was your trip?

456
00:25:40,211 --> 00:25:41,714
Earth to Jim.

457
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:48,618
Sorry. You just look so beautiful.

458
00:25:48,653 --> 00:25:50,519
Ew! You guys are gross.

459
00:25:50,555 --> 00:25:53,456
Julie, one day, you're
gonna love somebody

460
00:25:53,491 --> 00:25:55,825
as much as I love your father.

461
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,869
- Never. Boys are dumb.
- Are not.

462
00:26:06,304 --> 00:26:08,604
You feeling okay, honey?

463
00:26:10,975 --> 00:26:12,675
Just glad to be here.

464
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,543
With you guys.

465
00:26:15,413 --> 00:26:17,313
I love you so much.

466
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:22,018
Does that mean we can get a dog?

467
00:26:22,053 --> 00:26:23,519
You two.

468
00:26:23,554 --> 00:26:26,555
Does that mean we can get a dog?

469
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,926
- Sure!
- Yay!

470
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:31,994
You're the best, Dad.

471
00:26:40,004 --> 00:26:40,970
The best!

472
00:26:47,178 --> 00:26:48,544
- Just the best, Jim.
- No...

473
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:51,268
No, no, no! No! No! Come back!

474
00:26:58,222 --> 00:27:00,856
You look like you need a drink.

475
00:27:05,096 --> 00:27:06,362
Jim...

476
00:27:07,432 --> 00:27:08,831
Open the damn gate, Barbara.

477
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:11,033
I need to get back to them. To her.

478
00:27:15,073 --> 00:27:16,872
If you're so desperate to have
Thompkins and the two kids,

479
00:27:16,908 --> 00:27:19,909
why are you in that crappy
apartment playing private dick?

480
00:27:19,944 --> 00:27:21,877
Let go of me. You don't
know what the hell

481
00:27:21,946 --> 00:27:23,980
you're talking about.
I know you're lost.

482
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:25,414
You want to find your way home?

483
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,316
Play nice.

484
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:35,108
It's a long way to the basement.

485
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,530
So...

486
00:27:56,566 --> 00:27:59,033
The little minx was a no-show.

487
00:27:59,069 --> 00:28:01,502
Well, it seems a frightful shame to let

488
00:28:01,538 --> 00:28:03,538
this beautiful meal go to waste.

489
00:28:03,573 --> 00:28:06,174
What say we wrap it up and
have it for lunch tomorrow?

490
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,377
Hey?

491
00:28:12,879 --> 00:28:15,316
You always bring your
butler along on dates?

492
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:23,859
Right.

493
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,140
I'll leave you to it.

494
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:29,063
Excuse me, miss.

495
00:28:31,267 --> 00:28:33,401
You're late.

496
00:28:33,436 --> 00:28:35,288
Stuff came up.

497
00:28:35,703 --> 00:28:37,672
Geez. Chill.

498
00:28:39,309 --> 00:28:41,964
- Alfred really outdid himself.
- I made all of it.

499
00:28:42,459 --> 00:28:43,459
For you.

500
00:28:43,495 --> 00:28:45,661
What's with the attitude?

501
00:28:46,482 --> 00:28:48,097
You stood me up.

502
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:50,066
I got busy.

503
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:52,368
Selina, if we're gonna do this,

504
00:28:52,404 --> 00:28:54,604
whatever this is,

505
00:28:54,639 --> 00:28:56,539
I need you to be honest with me.

506
00:29:00,612 --> 00:29:02,111
This?

507
00:29:02,147 --> 00:29:03,447
Me and you.

508
00:29:05,459 --> 00:29:07,517
It's weird for me.

509
00:29:08,653 --> 00:29:10,853
Okay?

510
00:29:10,889 --> 00:29:13,256
It's weird for me.

511
00:29:14,325 --> 00:29:16,893
It's weird for me, too.

512
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,060
So...

513
00:29:18,096 --> 00:29:20,509
are you gonna cut the cake, or what?

514
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:31,674
Of course, I didn't want to
stand in the way of love, but...

515
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:33,843
this woman would have been a disaster.

516
00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:36,279
It sounds as if you did
your friend a favor.

517
00:29:36,314 --> 00:29:39,916
I'm sorry, I have been talking so much.

518
00:29:39,951 --> 00:29:42,418
I never asked your name.

519
00:29:42,454 --> 00:29:44,787
Kathryn.

520
00:29:44,823 --> 00:29:46,489
Just Kathryn.

521
00:29:46,524 --> 00:29:48,558
Mm-hmm.

522
00:29:48,593 --> 00:29:50,993
How did you end up at
the Founders' dinner?

523
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:52,895
If it's not rude of me to ask.

524
00:29:52,931 --> 00:29:54,130
Not at all.

525
00:29:54,165 --> 00:29:57,500
I'm from one of Gotham's
oldest families.

526
00:29:57,535 --> 00:30:00,803
And I'm part of a group which...

527
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:03,221
oversees things.

528
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:06,275
What sort of things?

529
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:09,111
Everything that matters in Gotham.

530
00:30:09,147 --> 00:30:12,281
We've had our eye on you for some time,

531
00:30:12,317 --> 00:30:14,128
Mr. Cobblepot.

532
00:30:15,053 --> 00:30:17,253
Who exactly are you?

533
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:22,725
We'll contact you when
the time is right.

534
00:30:24,496 --> 00:30:26,395
Enjoy your evening.

535
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,512
Excuse me,

536
00:30:42,547 --> 00:30:44,547
did you notice the rather...

537
00:30:44,582 --> 00:30:47,183
severe-looking woman
I was speaking with?

538
00:30:47,218 --> 00:30:48,518
She said her name...

539
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:53,789
What is this? What is going on?

540
00:30:53,825 --> 00:30:55,658
I'm afraid your evening
has been hijacked,

541
00:30:55,693 --> 00:30:57,860
Mr. Mayor.

542
00:30:57,896 --> 00:31:00,329
I see the champagne didn't leave a mark.

543
00:31:00,365 --> 00:31:02,198
I'm so glad.

544
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:04,534
For those of you who don't know me,

545
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:07,837
my name is Jervis Tetch.

546
00:31:07,872 --> 00:31:09,906
I promise not to take up
too much of your time.

547
00:31:09,941 --> 00:31:11,574
But the fact is, you...

548
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:13,743
are the heads of Gotham.

549
00:31:13,778 --> 00:31:15,044
And tonight

550
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:18,147
the heads of Gotham will roll.

551
00:31:19,918 --> 00:31:22,351
But first...

552
00:31:22,387 --> 00:31:23,519
a toast.

553
00:31:23,555 --> 00:31:26,255
A drink to your health.

554
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:28,357
And if we don't?

555
00:31:28,393 --> 00:31:31,928
Change, my friends, is nigh.

556
00:31:31,963 --> 00:31:33,095
Drink the wine...

557
00:31:33,131 --> 00:31:36,432
or else you die.

558
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:45,775
Glasses down now!

559
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,310
Glasses down!

560
00:31:56,588 --> 00:31:59,055
Oh, my...

561
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,524
Is that my dear sister I see?

562
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:04,126
Oh!

563
00:32:04,162 --> 00:32:05,928
She's in you, isn't she?

564
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:08,931
What fun!

565
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:11,233
What fun!

566
00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:14,103
Shut up!

567
00:32:14,138 --> 00:32:16,439
Shut up!

568
00:32:23,615 --> 00:32:26,649
Last stop.

569
00:32:28,134 --> 00:32:29,885
Don't be scared.

570
00:32:35,273 --> 00:32:38,260
It's not easy to face
who you really are.

571
00:32:40,665 --> 00:32:42,632
I should know.

572
00:32:47,005 --> 00:32:50,473
Do you ever wish you were
the person you used to be?

573
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:55,478
Do you?

574
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,126
Use this.

575
00:33:13,097 --> 00:33:14,530
Or don't.

576
00:33:14,565 --> 00:33:16,465
It's up to you.

577
00:33:19,704 --> 00:33:21,061
Good luck, Jim.

578
00:33:47,532 --> 00:33:48,998
Sir...

579
00:33:51,135 --> 00:33:54,270
Sir, I think you're looking for this?

580
00:33:57,975 --> 00:33:59,275
Dad?

581
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,696
Hey!

582
00:34:01,053 --> 00:34:02,778
It's good to see you, son.

583
00:34:04,195 --> 00:34:06,449
I'm always losing that darn thing.

584
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,753
Get in. We don't want to be late.

585
00:34:12,457 --> 00:34:14,123
Doctor? Doctor?

586
00:34:14,158 --> 00:34:15,324
Some help.

587
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,759
Doctor, he's unconscious.

588
00:34:16,794 --> 00:34:19,628
Dr. Calvi, he's in here.

589
00:34:19,664 --> 00:34:21,063
Jim?

590
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:22,264
Jim.

591
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,532
This was beside him.

592
00:34:25,937 --> 00:34:27,336
"Red Queen."

593
00:34:27,371 --> 00:34:28,838
I've heard of this.

594
00:34:28,873 --> 00:34:31,107
Get me 20cc's of Haloperidol.

595
00:34:31,142 --> 00:34:33,342
- Right away, Doctor.
- Jim, can you hear me?

596
00:34:33,377 --> 00:34:34,597
Jim.

597
00:34:34,632 --> 00:34:36,497
Jim!

598
00:34:40,184 --> 00:34:41,951
Come on, Jimmy,

599
00:34:41,986 --> 00:34:44,320
it's time to go.

600
00:35:03,141 --> 00:35:04,974
Something wrong?

601
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:07,644
No.

602
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:09,012
I'm just glad to see you.

603
00:35:09,047 --> 00:35:10,947
I missed you a lot.

604
00:35:10,982 --> 00:35:12,949
Yeah, sorry I haven't been around more.

605
00:35:12,984 --> 00:35:14,250
Heard you got into some kind of trouble.

606
00:35:14,286 --> 00:35:16,119
You want to talk about it?

607
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,857
When I was a kid,

608
00:35:20,892 --> 00:35:24,360
people would tell me,
"Your dad's a hero."

609
00:35:25,864 --> 00:35:27,830
All I knew is you went
to court every day,

610
00:35:27,866 --> 00:35:28,998
and every night you came home

611
00:35:29,034 --> 00:35:32,101
and you played ball with
me while Mom made dinner.

612
00:35:33,438 --> 00:35:35,939
Then I got older

613
00:35:35,974 --> 00:35:38,641
and I understood you were a hero.

614
00:35:40,145 --> 00:35:43,413
Only for me, it wasn't just
that you'd been a great D.A.

615
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:48,785
It was that you got up day after day,

616
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,487
you faced down the worst
the city had to offer,

617
00:35:51,523 --> 00:35:55,191
but you never brought
that home to Mom and me.

618
00:35:55,226 --> 00:35:57,427
You protected us.

619
00:35:59,331 --> 00:36:01,431
I wanted to be just like you.

620
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,136
Turns out I'm the opposite.

621
00:36:08,506 --> 00:36:10,907
I destroy everything
and everyone around me.

622
00:36:10,942 --> 00:36:12,108
Come on, Jimmy,

623
00:36:13,365 --> 00:36:15,578
I'm far from perfect.

624
00:36:15,614 --> 00:36:17,680
I got plenty of darkness inside me,

625
00:36:17,716 --> 00:36:19,148
I just don't dwell on it.

626
00:36:19,184 --> 00:36:21,150
Focus on the good you can
do. That's what counts.

627
00:36:21,186 --> 00:36:23,112
- That's what I'm trying to do.
- No.

628
00:36:23,135 --> 00:36:24,787
Been hiding behind self-righteous

629
00:36:24,823 --> 00:36:28,358
lone wolf nonsense
because you're afraid.

630
00:36:28,393 --> 00:36:30,259
Why is that?

631
00:36:30,295 --> 00:36:32,929
The badge holds expectations.

632
00:36:32,964 --> 00:36:35,698
People want a hero. And I'm not.

633
00:36:35,734 --> 00:36:37,899
You know what makes a hero, son?

634
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,937
A man who values protecting others

635
00:36:40,972 --> 00:36:42,839
above protecting himself.

636
00:36:42,874 --> 00:36:44,607
A man who knows his limits
but isn't afraid to fail.

637
00:36:44,643 --> 00:36:47,310
A man who knows when to ask
for help when he needs it.

638
00:36:47,345 --> 00:36:50,346
Now... I-I wasn't always that man,

639
00:36:50,382 --> 00:36:52,782
but damn, that didn't
stop me from trying.

640
00:36:53,721 --> 00:36:57,086
- I don't know how to be that man.
- Well, sure you do.

641
00:36:57,122 --> 00:36:59,856
Just got to follow the code.

642
00:36:59,891 --> 00:37:02,025
What... you remember what that is?

643
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:03,960
No.

644
00:37:03,995 --> 00:37:06,329
The code we Gordons promise to live by?

645
00:37:06,364 --> 00:37:08,197
No. Why can't I remember?

646
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:10,833
Because you're lost, son.

647
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:12,669
If you want to find your way back home,

648
00:37:12,704 --> 00:37:14,961
the answer you're looking
for is in my ring.

649
00:37:16,908 --> 00:37:19,208
Ah... shoot.

650
00:37:19,244 --> 00:37:20,576
It's time for me to go.

651
00:37:20,612 --> 00:37:22,311
No. I want to talk to you more.

652
00:37:22,347 --> 00:37:24,247
No, I can't. Someone's coming for me.

653
00:37:24,315 --> 00:37:25,581
No, Dad.

654
00:37:25,617 --> 00:37:27,517
No, Dad, please. Don't go. No, Dad!

655
00:37:27,552 --> 00:37:28,551
I'm proud of you, Jimmy.

656
00:37:28,586 --> 00:37:29,991
Dad!

657
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:32,422
Jim?

658
00:37:32,457 --> 00:37:34,691
Jim, can you hear me? Jim.

659
00:37:34,726 --> 00:37:36,893
Yeah.

660
00:37:36,928 --> 00:37:38,695
Yeah, I can hear you.

661
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:44,333
It's Haloperidol,

662
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:46,102
an antipsychotic.

663
00:37:46,137 --> 00:37:49,205
You were dosed with a pretty
powerful hallucinogen.

664
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,107
- It was Tetch.
- I know.

665
00:37:51,142 --> 00:37:53,376
Someone saw him leaving the hospital.

666
00:37:53,411 --> 00:37:55,378
You know, you're lucky.

667
00:37:55,413 --> 00:37:57,081
Another minute, we would have lost you.

668
00:38:00,288 --> 00:38:02,051
Thank you.

669
00:38:02,087 --> 00:38:03,319
It's my job.

670
00:38:03,354 --> 00:38:05,254
Dr. Calvi?

671
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,222
We need your signature, please.

672
00:38:06,257 --> 00:38:07,623
Uh-huh.

673
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:10,059
I'll get somebody to take the I.V. out.

674
00:38:10,095 --> 00:38:13,229
Half an hour, a glass of orange juice,

675
00:38:13,264 --> 00:38:15,498
you'll be good to go.

676
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,380
So while I did...

677
00:38:31,416 --> 00:38:34,383
kill my girlfriend,

678
00:38:34,419 --> 00:38:36,486
who does look rather similar to you,

679
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:39,088
it was not out of malice or intent.

680
00:38:39,124 --> 00:38:41,624
It was an accident that I deeply regret.

681
00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:43,198
And I was not gonna tell
you this, but then...

682
00:38:43,244 --> 00:38:44,894
Edward,

683
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:46,996
I know what you did.

684
00:38:47,031 --> 00:38:49,132
You do?

685
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:52,351
I spent the afternoon reading
every article about you.

686
00:38:53,944 --> 00:38:57,039
You know what I did and yet

687
00:38:57,075 --> 00:38:59,008
you still came on this date anyway?

688
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,010
Well...

689
00:39:01,045 --> 00:39:03,279
That's not logical.

690
00:39:03,314 --> 00:39:04,992
Love isn't logical.

691
00:39:10,321 --> 00:39:13,531
I've lived my whole life
inside the pages of books.

692
00:39:15,263 --> 00:39:17,048
Any other men I've dated,

693
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,656
they didn't compare to the
lovers I spent my life with:

694
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:26,969
Anthony, Cleopatra,

695
00:39:27,005 --> 00:39:29,172
Romeo and Juliet,

696
00:39:29,207 --> 00:39:32,510
Othello and Desdemona.

697
00:39:33,845 --> 00:39:36,412
All of whom died.

698
00:39:36,447 --> 00:39:38,123
Edward,

699
00:39:38,964 --> 00:39:40,737
you're the first to measure up.

700
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,278
You're the one I waited for.

701
00:39:45,523 --> 00:39:47,390
You're not scared of me?

702
00:39:47,425 --> 00:39:49,592
Of course I am.

703
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:52,662
Can you feel how fast
my heart's beating?

704
00:40:04,394 --> 00:40:05,808
Well, Ed,

705
00:40:05,844 --> 00:40:07,577
you would not believe the night...

706
00:40:07,612 --> 00:40:09,912
Oswald, good evening.

707
00:40:12,383 --> 00:40:14,317
This is Isabella.

708
00:40:15,353 --> 00:40:17,210
Oh...

709
00:40:17,647 --> 00:40:19,422
we have met.

710
00:40:19,457 --> 00:40:21,090
Mm.

711
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:23,159
Would you excuse me?

712
00:40:23,194 --> 00:40:26,395
I am very tired.

713
00:41:08,334 --> 00:41:13,075
"Dum spiramus tuebimur."

714
00:41:17,382 --> 00:41:20,116
While we breathe,

715
00:41:20,151 --> 00:41:22,852
we shall defend.

716
00:41:34,966 --> 00:41:36,165
Come in.

717
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,467
You busy?

718
00:41:38,503 --> 00:41:40,269
Just finishing up some
paperwork on Tetch.

719
00:41:40,305 --> 00:41:42,939
He and the Tweeds are
safe and sound in Arkham.

720
00:41:42,974 --> 00:41:45,141
Hopefully, that's the
last we'll hear from them.

721
00:41:45,176 --> 00:41:46,742
Congratulations.

722
00:41:47,845 --> 00:41:50,746
You did what I couldn't. I mean that.

723
00:41:50,782 --> 00:41:52,348
A humble Jim Gordon.

724
00:41:52,383 --> 00:41:53,683
What do you know?

725
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:58,489
I hear Tetch sent you on quite a trip.

726
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:01,123
If it wasn't for Mario, I'd be dead.

727
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:04,327
Anyway, I'm not here about that.

728
00:42:07,398 --> 00:42:09,832
I want to rejoin the GCPD.

729
00:42:11,636 --> 00:42:14,003
Why the sudden change of heart?

730
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:18,207
I made a promise to
someone when I was younger.

731
00:42:19,677 --> 00:42:22,712
I intend to keep that promise.

732
00:42:26,217 --> 00:42:28,250
Good.

733
00:42:29,354 --> 00:42:30,653
We need you here.

734
00:42:31,723 --> 00:42:33,189
I need you here.

735
00:42:35,393 --> 00:42:37,426
Welcome back, Detective.

736
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,435
It seems you left dinner

737
00:42:46,471 --> 00:42:47,803
just in time.

738
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,406
Indeed.

739
00:42:50,441 --> 00:42:53,142
And what did you think of our new mayor?

740
00:42:53,177 --> 00:42:58,247
My gut says once a
criminal, always a criminal.

741
00:42:58,282 --> 00:43:00,316
We'll keep an eye on him.

742
00:43:01,886 --> 00:43:04,887
Judgment is coming, Kathryn.

743
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:08,858
For all of us.
