1
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,125
NETFLIX PRESENTS

2
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:43,595
<i>There are three types of person:</i>

3
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,598
<i>Those at the top,</i>

4
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:48,266
<i>those at the bottom,</i>

5
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,226
<i>and those who fall.</i>

6
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:34,687
Level 48.

7
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:44,364
- The hole.
- Yes.

8
00:02:45,156 --> 00:02:46,324
The hole.

9
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:50,161
And it's the start of the month.

10
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:53,581
So the question is:

11
00:02:53,665 --> 00:02:55,166
What are we going to eat?

12
00:02:56,626 --> 00:02:58,378
What are we going to eat?

13
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,465
Obvious. The people above's left-overs.

14
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:10,140
- Who are the people up above?
- The people on Level 47. Obviously.

15
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,911
My name's Goreng.

16
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,045
Please stay on your side of the hole.

17
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:25,340
Goreng.

18
00:04:37,185 --> 00:04:39,103
What name have they given you?

19
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:40,939
Yes.

20
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:44,150
We should know each other's names.

21
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:46,444
We'll be together for a long time.

22
00:04:48,112 --> 00:04:49,364
Or maybe not.

23
00:04:50,281 --> 00:04:51,824
Who knows?

24
00:04:56,538 --> 00:04:58,623
My name is Trimagasi.

25
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,965
Mr. Trimagasi, do you know
what the hole entails?

26
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:09,759
It's obvious: eating.

27
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:13,096
At times, it's easy,

28
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,056
others, difficult...

29
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:17,141
It depends where you're assigned.

30
00:05:17,225 --> 00:05:20,520
Fortunately, No. 48 is a good level.

31
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:27,277
Are there many more people below?
Don't tell me...

32
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,779
It's obvious.

33
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:34,033
Soon, there will be fewer of them.

34
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:41,624
- You, down there! Can you hear me?
- Don't speak to the people below.

35
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:44,752
- Why?
- Because they're down below.

36
00:05:46,296 --> 00:05:48,256
The people above won't answer you.

37
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:51,551
- Why?
- Because they're above, obviously.

38
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:55,471
You think it's all very obvious.
You must have been here a long time.

39
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:59,809
Months. Many, many months.

40
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:03,730
And I repeat, 48 is a good level,

41
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:06,357
and you've been very lucky.

42
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:09,068
And how long are we going to spend
on this wonderful level?

43
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:11,571
We'll be here for exactly a month.

44
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:14,240
Then, we will see.

45
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:17,076
That's the last question I'll answer.

46
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,995
Speaking tires me out.

47
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:23,332
Especially when I have to give
more information than I get.

48
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,085
That's not fair, obviously.

49
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:28,171
From now on,

50
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:31,716
I will give you as much information
as you give me.

51
00:06:46,064 --> 00:06:48,232
The red light went off
and the green one came on.

52
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,110
I've just given you information.

53
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:54,322
Now, it's only fair for you
to give me some, right?

54
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,201
Why did the red light go off
and the green one come on?

55
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:29,732
This food has already been eaten.

56
00:07:30,191 --> 00:07:33,319
That's so obvious,
I won't even say "obviously."

57
00:07:33,402 --> 00:07:35,196
It's disgusting.

58
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,829
Let's see.

59
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:46,415
If there are 47 levels above us
and two people per level,

60
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,835
are we eating 94 people's left-overs?

61
00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:50,628
Don't worry.

62
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:53,089
As the month goes by,
there'll be fewer people up above.

63
00:07:53,548 --> 00:07:55,967
- Aren't you going to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

64
00:07:56,842 --> 00:07:58,511
You will be.

65
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,977
Why did you say there'd be
fewer people next month?

66
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,105
I won't say it's obvious,
because it's not.

67
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:12,149
I didn't understand myself
till I was on Level 8.

68
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:13,943
Wine!

69
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:19,282
There must be quite a few Muslims
and teetotalers up there.

70
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:23,661
Normally, the drink's all gone by now.

71
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:26,372
Are you really not going to eat?

72
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:41,512
For later.

73
00:08:58,195 --> 00:08:59,322
Why did you do that?

74
00:09:00,156 --> 00:09:01,907
For the people down there to eat.

75
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:03,826
What if the people above did the same?

76
00:09:04,618 --> 00:09:06,329
They probably do.

77
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:09,874
Bastards.

78
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,546
- Isn't it very hot in here?
- And it'll get even hotter.

79
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:17,214
Hotter?

80
00:09:17,298 --> 00:09:19,759
We'll be burned to a cinder.

81
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:21,635
Really? Why?

82
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:23,387
It's your fault.

83
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:27,183
The temperature will keep rising
unchecked unless...

84
00:09:30,144 --> 00:09:33,397
- Unless what?
- Unless you get rid of that apple.

85
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:37,526
The food only belongs to us
while the platform is on our level.

86
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,323
If you keep anything,
the temperature rises till we're cooked.

87
00:09:42,406 --> 00:09:44,533
Or falls till we freeze.

88
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,202
It depends.

89
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,122
Shit.

90
00:09:58,047 --> 00:09:59,632
Do you understand?

91
00:10:02,593 --> 00:10:04,512
I said, do you understand?

92
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:05,971
What?

93
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:11,852
Once you're inside, you can't get out
till the agreed period is over.

94
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:15,189
So, I've been accepted?

95
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,108
Not yet.

96
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:27,368
Can my item be a book?

97
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,121
It can be whatever you want.

98
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:36,961
THE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN
DON QUIXOTE

99
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,681
I'd like to tell you why I'm here.

100
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:50,850
What for?

101
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:54,061
So that then you'll tell me
why you're here.

102
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:55,187
It's obvious.

103
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,401
I wanted to quit smoking
and read <i>Don Quixote.</i>

104
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:04,488
They said I could bring an item.
So, I thought I've never...

105
00:11:04,572 --> 00:11:06,282
You came here voluntarily?

106
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:13,289
Six months in exchange
for an accredited diploma.

107
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,916
An accredited diploma?

108
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:19,628
An accredited diploma?

109
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,258
I should get two.

110
00:11:24,341 --> 00:11:26,802
I came for a year.

111
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,220
Why are you here?

112
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:43,444
They give this guy one, and not me.

113
00:12:05,382 --> 00:12:07,343
I'd stand back if I were you.

114
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,496
- Aren't you going to eat today either?
- Obviously not.

115
00:12:36,246 --> 00:12:37,414
What a waste!

116
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:40,000
You don't deserve to be on this level.

117
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,254
You haven't told me why you're here.

118
00:12:52,513 --> 00:12:54,014
Come on. Tell me.

119
00:12:58,102 --> 00:13:03,690
Only if you promise
not to borrow the word "obviously" again.

120
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:15,327
I was at home, and an ad came on TV.
A bearded chap with a knife-sharpener.

121
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:21,083
"The Samurai-Max sharpens any blade,
straight or serrated," he said.

122
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:23,836
"Look at this knife.

123
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,589
It's so blunt, it wouldn't cut a sponge.

124
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,842
But just apply the Samurai-Max,

125
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:33,512
and you can cut even the hardest surfaces,
like this brick.

126
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:37,224
And it was true. He cut it.

127
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,942
Then, a few housewives came on,

128
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:51,196
saying how the Samurai-Max
had changed their lives.

129
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,992
"We could never cut tomatoes,

130
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:57,828
bread fell to pieces when we cut it.

131
00:13:58,954 --> 00:14:02,374
The Samurai-Max changed our lives,"
they all said.

132
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,794
Honestly, I've never peeled a tomato,

133
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,046
and I always buy sliced bread.

134
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:13,218
And I've never known why you'd want
to cut a brick with a kitchen knife.

135
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,388
But I started to think...

136
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:19,558
Why don't I sharpen my knives?

137
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:22,978
Maybe my life is such crap
because I don't sharpen my knives,

138
00:14:23,061 --> 00:14:24,771
don't look after the little things.

139
00:14:25,188 --> 00:14:28,275
- The little things, Goreng.
- Did you buy it?

140
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,279
- Obviously.
- And what did you do?

141
00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:35,824
Sharpen your knives and slice open
someone's throat, or what?

142
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:43,624
After I bought it,
I watched the next advertisement.

143
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:46,668
The same guy with the beard
came on with the same housewives.

144
00:14:47,878 --> 00:14:49,880
Know what they were advertising?

145
00:14:50,631 --> 00:14:55,802
A knife that didn't go blunt
even if you cut a brick with it.

146
00:14:55,886 --> 00:15:00,390
The knife sharpened itself, as it cut.

147
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:03,560
Know what the knife was called?

148
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:07,189
- The Samurai-Plus.
- You bought it too?

149
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,692
- No, no...
- Obviously, they were taking the piss.

150
00:15:11,234 --> 00:15:12,778
The little things...

151
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:16,823
Because of the little things,
I couldn't take it anymore.

152
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:20,869
I took my television set...

153
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:22,621
and threw it out the window.

154
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:27,000
It fell on some bloody illegal immigrant
on his bicycle.

155
00:15:27,084 --> 00:15:29,586
Tell me, was that guy's death my fault?

156
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,464
He shouldn't even have been there.

157
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,389
You killed a man, and they took you here?

158
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:44,017
They gave me a choice between
a psychiatric hospital and the hole.

159
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:45,977
And I came here.

160
00:15:46,937 --> 00:15:50,107
They never offered me
an accredited diploma, though.

161
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:56,738
How many levels are there?

162
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:01,535
I don't know. But I know there are
more than 132, because I was there.

163
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:03,161
One hundred and thirty two?

164
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:05,080
And there were more below.

165
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:08,500
- How much food gets to that level?
- None.

166
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:11,044
You can't go without food for 30 days.

167
00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:12,796
I didn't say I didn't eat anything,

168
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,840
just that no food got down there.

169
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:17,342
And you can go without food
for more than 30 days.

170
00:16:17,426 --> 00:16:20,887
The problem is when you get assigned
to two lower levels consecutively.

171
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:25,016
We need to tell the people up there.

172
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,060
- What for?
- What do you mean?

173
00:16:27,144 --> 00:16:30,856
We can tell them to ration the food
and pass the message up to Level 46,

174
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:32,983
and from there to Level 45...

175
00:16:34,568 --> 00:16:36,111
Are you a communist?

176
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:39,281
It's fairer to ration out the food.

177
00:16:39,948 --> 00:16:42,159
Up there, they won't heed a communist.

178
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:44,578
Then I'll start with down below.

179
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:46,997
Hey! You in 49, can you hear me?

180
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,295
Leave more wine next time, bastards!

181
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:56,047
There's your wine, fuckers!

182
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:02,971
The people below us are below us.

183
00:17:03,054 --> 00:17:06,433
- Next month they might be above us.
- Yes, and they'll piss on us.

184
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,061
The bastards.

185
00:17:21,156 --> 00:17:22,824
I chose a book.

186
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:25,994
What did you choose?

187
00:17:27,204 --> 00:17:28,455
It's obvious.

188
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,336
The Samurai-Plus.

189
00:18:36,022 --> 00:18:37,816
Do you never get tired of doing that?

190
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:39,317
It's incredible.

191
00:18:40,318 --> 00:18:43,029
The more I use it, the sharper it gets.

192
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:59,212
- Was that a person?
- Of course it was a person.

193
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:01,005
I hope he wasn't a teetotaler,

194
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:02,632
because we're low on wine.

195
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,265
On the upper levels,
you can eat anything you like.

196
00:19:11,141 --> 00:19:13,518
But you've nothing to look forward to.

197
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:16,479
And a lot to think about.

198
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,742
Is no one going to do anything?

199
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:41,796
If I were you, I'd pray they keep us
on the middle levels.

200
00:19:42,672 --> 00:19:46,342
You look like the sort who'd jump
when they're up above

201
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:49,345
and lack the guts when they're below.

202
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:53,099
The guts to do what?

203
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:05,862
Will you read your book to me tonight?

204
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:08,823
These days, I can't get to sleep.

205
00:20:09,532 --> 00:20:10,909
I miss my television.

206
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:15,121
What levels have you been on?

207
00:20:17,957 --> 00:20:19,918
I first woke up on Level 72.

208
00:20:21,461 --> 00:20:24,214
Then I was on 26,

209
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:27,008
seventy-eight, 43,

210
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,513
eleven, 79,

211
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:35,058
thirty-two, 8...

212
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:38,937
Last month, I was on Level 132,

213
00:20:39,854 --> 00:20:42,524
- and now, I'm here.
- Okay, and who were you with?

214
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:45,485
because I gather you always wake up
with the same person.

215
00:20:45,568 --> 00:20:48,738
- Who were you with?
- Why do you gather that?

216
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:52,408
Because you said we'd be together
next month. Who were you with?

217
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:58,456
It doesn't matter. What matters is
that you have a self-sharpening knife,

218
00:20:58,539 --> 00:20:59,749
and your cellmate disappeared

219
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,210
after you were on a level
that gets hardly any food.

220
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:05,046
And you don't look like
you spent a month without food.

221
00:21:06,005 --> 00:21:07,715
The conclusion is obvious, isn't it?

222
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,301
You promised not to use that word again.

223
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:12,428
Obviously, you forgot
the fifth commandment.

224
00:21:12,512 --> 00:21:14,597
Obviously, you dined on your cellmate.

225
00:21:31,864 --> 00:21:33,741
Don't worry about her. Eat.

226
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,910
- Is she injured?
- Nothing serious.

227
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:38,746
Isn't that right, Miharu?

228
00:21:43,626 --> 00:21:44,961
You know her?

229
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,630
She comes down every month.

230
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:51,300
- Why does she do that?
- She's looking for her little boy.

231
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,387
There are children in the hole?

232
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:12,238
Well, well... So, you'd like to keep her
for a couple of days?

233
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,908
I took you for a man of principles.

234
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:17,201
I want to help her.

235
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,495
I am helping her.

236
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,167
In the hole, everyone's free to decide
what they want.

237
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,626
She wants to go down.

238
00:22:26,753 --> 00:22:29,130
Know what she does each month?

239
00:22:29,213 --> 00:22:32,550
Before coming down on the platform,
she kills her cellmate.

240
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:37,221
That way, there's a chance she might be
with her son the next month.

241
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:42,435
I wouldn't be surprised
if that body you saw was her cellmate.

242
00:22:46,105 --> 00:22:48,274
I didn't kill anyone on Level 132.

243
00:22:48,357 --> 00:22:52,153
Quite simply, my cellmate
completed his time in the hole.

244
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:56,908
He'll be out there now,
making it big with his accredited diploma.

245
00:22:58,701 --> 00:23:02,955
After eight days, a body fell
just when the platform was at our level.

246
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,334
We ate human flesh.

247
00:23:07,043 --> 00:23:08,795
But we didn't kill anybody.

248
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,897
Hey!

249
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:29,857
Hey! Hey!

250
00:23:30,316 --> 00:23:32,068
Leave her alone, you bastards!

251
00:23:32,151 --> 00:23:35,112
They'll only keep her a couple of days.
Don't meddle.

252
00:23:36,155 --> 00:23:38,282
- Will you read from your book tonight...
- Hey!

253
00:23:40,284 --> 00:23:43,204
Go ahead! Jump!

254
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:45,706
It's only six or seven meters down.

255
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,153
What chapter do you want me to read?

256
00:24:16,237 --> 00:24:18,197
Chapter One, obviously.

257
00:24:22,868 --> 00:24:23,911
Jesus!

258
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:27,832
"Somewhere in La Mancha, in a place
whose name I do not care to remember,

259
00:24:27,915 --> 00:24:31,252
a gentleman lived not long ago,
one of those who has a lance

260
00:24:31,335 --> 00:24:34,213
an old shield, a nag and a racing dog."

261
00:25:46,285 --> 00:25:48,037
Do you believe in God?

262
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:53,542
Why do you ask?

263
00:25:54,877 --> 00:25:58,506
If you do, I want you to pray for us.

264
00:26:00,007 --> 00:26:01,884
Smell that?

265
00:26:02,843 --> 00:26:04,512
It's gas.

266
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:07,848
In a moment, they'll put us to sleep.

267
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:10,768
Tomorrow, we'll wake on another level.

268
00:26:13,687 --> 00:26:15,356
I'm fond of you, Goreng.

269
00:26:16,565 --> 00:26:19,235
I don't think you'll survive long.

270
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,654
But I'm fond of you.

271
00:26:23,948 --> 00:26:25,407
You've got a good heart.

272
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:30,454
Next month will be my second-to-last.

273
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:36,168
When I get out,
I should have an accredited diploma.

274
00:26:38,796 --> 00:26:40,714
And that's no small matter.

275
00:26:43,592 --> 00:26:44,969
Do you believe in God?

276
00:26:46,345 --> 00:26:49,974
This month, yes.

277
00:27:19,587 --> 00:27:21,589
You sleep very soundly, Goreng.

278
00:27:25,217 --> 00:27:27,386
Don't worry, don't worry.

279
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:29,179
Calm down.

280
00:27:33,183 --> 00:27:36,687
This is not a good place.
Do you understand now?

281
00:27:37,563 --> 00:27:40,441
You're younger and stronger than me.

282
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,486
You might not attack me immediately,

283
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:48,073
but over time,
you'd start to look at me differently.

284
00:27:48,157 --> 00:27:50,701
Hunger unleashes that madman in us.

285
00:27:51,827 --> 00:27:55,664
It's better to eat than be eaten.

286
00:27:57,499 --> 00:27:59,752
Obviously, I don't want to kill you.

287
00:27:59,835 --> 00:28:02,963
Your flesh would soon rot,

288
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:05,341
and we'd have nothing to eat.

289
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:08,052
Nor will I mutilate you right away.

290
00:28:09,595 --> 00:28:13,682
For the first week, fasting is bearable.

291
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:17,519
Have you ever eaten snails?

292
00:28:21,148 --> 00:28:23,400
Refined people call them escargots.

293
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:26,195
They're highly prized in some places.

294
00:28:26,737 --> 00:28:30,282
Before you eat them, you have
to purge them for seven to ten days.

295
00:28:31,658 --> 00:28:34,495
So, there's no need to be scared. Yet.

296
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:41,293
Can you hear that?

297
00:28:43,962 --> 00:28:45,923
The screams of people waking

298
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:49,009
to discover what level they're on.

299
00:28:58,727 --> 00:29:00,938
You don't have to do this, Trimagasi.

300
00:29:01,605 --> 00:29:05,526
As time goes by,
our friendship would deteriorate.

301
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:08,529
And it would end in mutual mistrust,

302
00:29:08,612 --> 00:29:11,573
ultimately leading to conflict and crime.

303
00:29:12,282 --> 00:29:15,285
I know, because I've experienced it.

304
00:29:15,369 --> 00:29:17,079
You're a fucking murderer.

305
00:29:17,162 --> 00:29:20,749
No. I'm someone who's frightened.

306
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:25,003
I don't enjoy this, my little snail.

307
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:29,842
I'm not a fucking snail.

308
00:29:29,925 --> 00:29:33,804
I'm sorry. It's easier for me
to think of you as a snail

309
00:29:33,887 --> 00:29:36,348
purging its impurities.

310
00:29:36,431 --> 00:29:39,893
You see, I'm really quite sentimental.

311
00:29:50,154 --> 00:29:51,196
See that?

312
00:29:52,823 --> 00:29:56,160
They haven't even left us any bones!

313
00:30:00,038 --> 00:30:01,540
Let's see, my little snail,

314
00:30:01,623 --> 00:30:04,334
you're tied down. I'm not.

315
00:30:04,418 --> 00:30:08,714
You have a book. I have my Samurai-Plus.

316
00:30:09,423 --> 00:30:12,175
Obviously, you're in no position
to make demands.

317
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:13,927
But if you cooperate,

318
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:16,638
I can offer you a chance to live.

319
00:30:18,724 --> 00:30:22,769
You can't mutilate someone here
without killing them, you bastard.

320
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:26,189
I promise, I'll do what I can.

321
00:30:27,274 --> 00:30:30,527
After eight days, I'll start cutting off
little strips of flesh.

322
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:34,114
Each time, I'll do my best
to treat your wounds.

323
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,408
And I'll give you your share.

324
00:30:36,491 --> 00:30:37,951
A share of myself?

325
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:40,871
Think of your own survival and help me.

326
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,665
I hope you'll see reason,

327
00:30:43,749 --> 00:30:47,044
and we can go on reading <i>Don Quixote.</i>

328
00:30:47,127 --> 00:30:50,964
Let's see. That person's death
might have been an accident,

329
00:30:51,423 --> 00:30:53,091
but this isn't.

330
00:30:53,175 --> 00:30:56,803
You will be solely responsible
for my death, you bastard.

331
00:30:56,887 --> 00:31:00,724
No. The people above make me do it.

332
00:31:01,308 --> 00:31:04,353
Three hundred and forty people
are to blame before me.

333
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:07,356
We can survive
just by drinking water, Trimagasi.

334
00:31:07,439 --> 00:31:09,858
You might last out,

335
00:31:10,651 --> 00:31:12,944
but I'm an old man.

336
00:31:13,028 --> 00:31:16,573
I need to remember that next month
will be my last one here.

337
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:21,995
And if I survive... what happens
if we're sent to another bad level?

338
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:25,248
- Now you get it, don't you?
- Obviously not.

339
00:31:25,332 --> 00:31:28,627
- Will you read <i>Don Quixote</i> to me tonight?
- Obviously not.

340
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,379
In that case, that's an end to it.

341
00:31:30,462 --> 00:31:32,297
Speaking tires me out.

342
00:31:32,381 --> 00:31:35,050
Keeping quiet tires you out!

343
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:36,593
Keeping quiet tires you out!

344
00:32:25,892 --> 00:32:28,145
The time has come, my little snail.

345
00:32:29,563 --> 00:32:31,314
I was trying to read...

346
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,817
but I can't.

347
00:32:34,443 --> 00:32:36,403
The words get mixed up.

348
00:32:38,071 --> 00:32:40,323
My mind clouds over.

349
00:32:43,827 --> 00:32:45,954
Better for you if we start today.

350
00:32:47,122 --> 00:32:50,959
Otherwise, I can't guarantee
to make a clean job of it.

351
00:32:52,752 --> 00:32:56,548
I want you to know
that I hold you responsible.

352
00:32:57,716 --> 00:32:59,467
Not the people up above.

353
00:33:00,218 --> 00:33:01,928
Not the circumstances.

354
00:33:02,554 --> 00:33:04,472
Not even the Administration.

355
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,394
You.

356
00:33:11,062 --> 00:33:13,607
You're well purged, my little snail.

357
00:33:14,941 --> 00:33:16,860
Inside and out.

358
00:33:17,652 --> 00:33:19,487
You don't even feel any resentment.

359
00:33:21,156 --> 00:33:24,659
Don't worry, just a few morsels of flesh.

360
00:33:24,743 --> 00:33:26,745
I won't touch your genitals.

361
00:33:30,582 --> 00:33:32,250
Are you ready?

362
00:36:44,317 --> 00:36:45,735
Thank you.

363
00:37:28,152 --> 00:37:29,612
What's your boy called?

364
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:49,984
Eat...

365
00:38:51,444 --> 00:38:53,029
or be eaten?

366
00:38:57,366 --> 00:38:59,160
You made me.

367
00:38:59,243 --> 00:39:00,620
No.

368
00:39:01,245 --> 00:39:03,748
I was helpless and you showed no mercy.

369
00:39:04,248 --> 00:39:08,085
You didn't treat me with the same respect
I would have shown you.

370
00:39:08,169 --> 00:39:09,212
Obviously.

371
00:39:09,295 --> 00:39:11,923
Still using that word when you're dead.

372
00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:17,970
It smells of gas.

373
00:39:21,974 --> 00:39:23,643
And you're an illusion.

374
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,603
Perhaps.

375
00:39:26,854 --> 00:39:30,358
What does it matter? We're the same now.

376
00:39:33,986 --> 00:39:36,197
Both murderers.

377
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,283
The difference is that I'm more civilized.

378
00:39:40,701 --> 00:39:45,414
- Go.
- No. I'll never go.

379
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:50,294
I belong to you now. I am in your body.

380
00:39:52,713 --> 00:39:56,133
But you belong to me too,

381
00:39:56,217 --> 00:39:57,760
my snail.

382
00:40:00,137 --> 00:40:01,639
Speaking tires me out.

383
00:40:02,431 --> 00:40:04,475
See? I was right.

384
00:41:02,992 --> 00:41:05,911
Ramesses II! Come here, honey.

385
00:41:08,456 --> 00:41:11,417
Animal! He was only being friendly.

386
00:41:18,215 --> 00:41:20,926
I'm Imoguiri. This is Ramesses II.

387
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,512
Can you bring animals into the hole?

388
00:41:23,596 --> 00:41:26,098
There was no way
I was coming without him, Goreng.

389
00:41:26,182 --> 00:41:29,643
It's not a great idea
to bring a sausage dog in here.

390
00:41:29,727 --> 00:41:32,146
In here, he's more sausage than dog.

391
00:41:32,229 --> 00:41:35,608
I thought someone who chose a book
would be more sensitive with animals.

392
00:41:36,108 --> 00:41:38,110
No one ever brought a book before.

393
00:41:39,361 --> 00:41:42,239
People have asked for everything:
guns, crossbows,

394
00:41:42,907 --> 00:41:44,742
knives, torches,

395
00:41:44,825 --> 00:41:47,620
golf clubs, baseball bats...

396
00:41:47,703 --> 00:41:50,289
- even an exercise bike.
- How do you know my name?

397
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,376
<i>You can smoke if you want.</i>

398
00:42:01,008 --> 00:42:03,969
- Shall we continue?
- Yes.

399
00:42:10,601 --> 00:42:12,269
Any gluten or lactose intolerance?

400
00:42:13,395 --> 00:42:14,438
No.

401
00:42:17,024 --> 00:42:21,153
Any allergy to shellfish, peanuts,
or any type of fruit?

402
00:42:21,237 --> 00:42:23,572
Not that I know of.

403
00:42:38,963 --> 00:42:41,757
You know that once you go in,
you won't be able to smoke?

404
00:42:45,261 --> 00:42:46,637
Yes, I know.

405
00:43:00,734 --> 00:43:02,778
Are these pauses part of the interview?

406
00:43:06,824 --> 00:43:08,200
Do they make you uncomfortable?

407
00:43:09,326 --> 00:43:10,703
No.

408
00:43:20,379 --> 00:43:21,880
Your favorite food?

409
00:43:28,345 --> 00:43:29,471
I don't know.

410
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,727
Think hard, please.

411
00:43:36,145 --> 00:43:37,771
Why do you want to know?

412
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,274
We'll include it on the menu.

413
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,736
So, I've been accepted?

414
00:43:44,945 --> 00:43:46,697
Not yet.

415
00:43:51,744 --> 00:43:53,662
Escargots à la Bourguignonne.

416
00:43:55,414 --> 00:43:56,623
Snails?

417
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:59,752
- Yes.
- Okay.

418
00:44:00,711 --> 00:44:04,631
<i>- Can you get me out of here?
- You know I can't.</i>

419
00:44:05,632 --> 00:44:09,470
How many did you send to this pigsty
before they sent you?

420
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,307
If I remember correctly,
you came here voluntarily.

421
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:16,852
No one sent me. I asked to be sent too.

422
00:44:16,935 --> 00:44:20,314
So, you don't know
there are people dying in the hole?

423
00:44:20,397 --> 00:44:23,817
We prefer to call it
a Vertical Self-Management Center.

424
00:44:29,615 --> 00:44:31,241
How many levels are there?

425
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:34,286
Two hundred levels.

426
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,458
Two hundred?

427
00:44:43,253 --> 00:44:46,256
There isn't enough food for 200 levels.

428
00:44:47,007 --> 00:44:49,468
If everyone ate only what they needed,

429
00:44:50,177 --> 00:44:52,096
the food would reach the lowest levels.

430
00:44:52,179 --> 00:44:55,933
- No, it's not that easy in here.
- No, it isn't.

431
00:44:56,016 --> 00:44:57,351
Or on the outside.

432
00:44:57,434 --> 00:45:00,521
But eventually,
something has to happen in the VSC.

433
00:45:00,604 --> 00:45:04,399
Something that fosters
a spontaneous sense of solidarity.

434
00:45:04,483 --> 00:45:07,694
The VSC? Spontaneous solidarity?

435
00:45:07,778 --> 00:45:10,489
Is that why they created this pit?

436
00:45:16,745 --> 00:45:19,832
Change never happens spontaneously.

437
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,335
Perhaps, that's why you're here.

438
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:35,430
I'll be glad just to get out alive.

439
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:16,346
That's it. Isn't that delicious?

440
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:19,558
You know that what you're doing
could cause the death of a human?

441
00:46:19,641 --> 00:46:20,851
That's it.

442
00:46:22,102 --> 00:46:25,522
One day, I eat, and the next, he does.
It's my ration.

443
00:46:27,024 --> 00:46:28,817
Maybe the death of a child.

444
00:46:30,235 --> 00:46:32,696
Under-16s aren't allowed in the hole.

445
00:46:35,949 --> 00:46:37,743
There's at least one child.

446
00:46:37,826 --> 00:46:41,413
Under-16s aren't allowed in the hole.

447
00:46:41,496 --> 00:46:44,666
The VSC Administration
is very strict about that.

448
00:46:56,803 --> 00:46:58,639
Good morning.

449
00:46:59,056 --> 00:47:00,807
Please listen carefully.

450
00:47:00,891 --> 00:47:03,226
I've left two helpings to one side

451
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:04,895
so you can each eat your share.

452
00:47:04,978 --> 00:47:08,148
Please prepare two similar rations
for the people on the next level.

453
00:47:08,231 --> 00:47:13,070
What? We've just been in Level 88.
It's a miracle we're alive!

454
00:47:13,153 --> 00:47:15,614
I understand, but we have
a responsibility to those

455
00:47:15,697 --> 00:47:17,366
less fortunate that us this month.

456
00:47:17,449 --> 00:47:20,535
Your rations contain enough calories
to ensure your survival.

457
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:27,626
Please, gentlemen!

458
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:33,548
Spontaneous solidarity.

459
00:47:36,593 --> 00:47:39,930
Perhaps this place exists precisely
for the opposite of what you think.

460
00:47:40,013 --> 00:47:45,560
If that solidarity emerged, they'd know
to prevent it happening on the outside.

461
00:47:45,644 --> 00:47:48,188
- Who's "they"?
- Who do you think?

462
00:47:51,441 --> 00:47:52,901
The Administration.

463
00:47:54,653 --> 00:47:59,032
You're one of those people who thinks
all the Administration does is bad.

464
00:47:59,658 --> 00:48:02,285
I've worked for them for 25 years.

465
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,997
And you enjoy special privileges.

466
00:48:06,081 --> 00:48:09,376
- What are you saying?
- You got to choose your cellmate.

467
00:48:16,508 --> 00:48:17,592
Not me.

468
00:48:35,902 --> 00:48:37,796
Gentlemen, I understand
you were hungry yesterday,

469
00:48:37,821 --> 00:48:39,614
and you didn't pay any notice to me.

470
00:48:39,698 --> 00:48:43,827
But it's important you only eat
the helpings I've prepared.

471
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:47,038
And make two more for Level 35.

472
00:48:47,747 --> 00:48:49,291
Leave us alone!

473
00:48:49,374 --> 00:48:51,459
We'll eat what we fucking like!

474
00:48:57,132 --> 00:48:58,925
Sooner or later, you will see reason.

475
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,261
Are you real?

476
00:49:01,344 --> 00:49:05,015
<i>Gentlemen, please, eat your rations
and prepare two similar ones for the...</i>

477
00:49:08,101 --> 00:49:09,477
<i>Gentlemen, please,</i>

478
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:13,189
<i>eat your rations
and prepare two similar ones for the...</i>

479
00:49:15,525 --> 00:49:17,777
<i>Gentlemen, please.</i>

480
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,948
<i>Eat your share
and prepare two similar rations...</i>

481
00:49:23,408 --> 00:49:27,495
<i>Gentlemen, please, eat your rations
and prepare two similar ones...</i>

482
00:49:30,415 --> 00:49:32,834
<i>Gentlemen, I have prepared your rations</i>

483
00:49:32,918 --> 00:49:37,339
<i>and the rations for Level 35
to make things easier for you.</i>

484
00:49:37,422 --> 00:49:39,257
Please prepare two...

485
00:49:41,718 --> 00:49:44,679
Please, it's been two weeks.

486
00:49:44,763 --> 00:49:47,390
This time, please follow my instructions

487
00:49:47,474 --> 00:49:50,435
because there are people dying
beneath your feet.

488
00:49:50,518 --> 00:49:53,146
Do you understand me? People are dying!

489
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,649
Okay, bastards.

490
00:49:56,191 --> 00:49:58,151
You do exactly what the lady says,

491
00:49:58,234 --> 00:50:00,737
or I'm going to shit
in your food every day.

492
00:50:00,987 --> 00:50:04,115
I'll mix it all up till there isn't
a grain of rice left untouched.

493
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:05,367
Do you hear?

494
00:50:05,492 --> 00:50:07,202
You're going to eat shit every day.

495
00:50:07,285 --> 00:50:10,497
And now, go and say the same
to the bastards beneath you.

496
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,623
Is that clear?

497
00:50:15,752 --> 00:50:16,878
Right.

498
00:50:23,635 --> 00:50:25,553
It seems to be working.

499
00:50:25,637 --> 00:50:26,763
Obviously.

500
00:50:28,473 --> 00:50:30,433
But it's not what I thought.

501
00:50:30,517 --> 00:50:32,394
I thought I'd persuade them.

502
00:50:32,477 --> 00:50:33,645
They're persuaded.

503
00:50:33,728 --> 00:50:34,813
With shit?

504
00:50:34,896 --> 00:50:37,565
Much more effective
than your spontaneous solidarity.

505
00:50:39,275 --> 00:50:41,419
Let's see if now we can persuade
the people up above.

506
00:50:41,444 --> 00:50:43,822
The people above won't listen to me.

507
00:50:45,573 --> 00:50:46,991
Why not?

508
00:50:47,075 --> 00:50:49,244
I can't shit upwards.

509
00:51:06,136 --> 00:51:08,430
Help me! Help me!

510
00:51:14,894 --> 00:51:17,355
Okay, calm down, calm down.

511
00:51:17,439 --> 00:51:19,190
It's the mother of the boy.

512
00:51:22,735 --> 00:51:24,821
The pillow, the pillow!

513
00:51:32,078 --> 00:51:33,455
Don't worry.

514
00:51:44,382 --> 00:51:46,885
Don't worry. It's okay.

515
00:51:50,305 --> 00:51:51,764
- What?
- So cold.

516
00:51:51,848 --> 00:51:53,558
It's cold.

517
00:51:54,851 --> 00:51:56,603
That's it.

518
00:51:56,686 --> 00:51:58,646
I'm cold, too.

519
00:52:01,441 --> 00:52:02,817
What's happening?

520
00:52:04,569 --> 00:52:07,071
Fucking dog. Come here!

521
00:52:07,155 --> 00:52:10,074
Bastard, come here! Let go!

522
00:53:00,249 --> 00:53:02,585
I hate you.

523
00:53:02,669 --> 00:53:04,420
You vile bitch!

524
00:53:04,504 --> 00:53:06,214
- I hate you!
- Hey!

525
00:53:07,757 --> 00:53:10,760
What? What?

526
00:53:30,279 --> 00:53:31,739
It's because of her son.

527
00:53:35,493 --> 00:53:38,037
Seriously? I don't know.

528
00:53:39,205 --> 00:53:40,915
I've never been a mother.

529
00:53:40,998 --> 00:53:43,584
Hey! Is this our helping for today?

530
00:53:43,668 --> 00:53:45,586
That's fucking ace, man.

531
00:53:46,337 --> 00:53:49,882
I selected that woman ten months ago,
and she came here alone.

532
00:53:50,675 --> 00:53:52,885
She has no father and no children.

533
00:53:52,969 --> 00:53:54,971
Her favorite dish is bibimbap.

534
00:53:55,847 --> 00:53:59,267
She's a movie actress.
She brought a ukulele.

535
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:02,395
She wanted to look like Marilyn Monroe
in the film.

536
00:54:02,478 --> 00:54:04,230
She came into the hole on her own.

537
00:54:04,939 --> 00:54:06,607
You hear, Goreng?

538
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,820
Completely alone.

539
00:54:15,158 --> 00:54:19,162
The bitch wanted to be
the Asian Marilyn Monroe.

540
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:22,582
With her slit eyes, playing the ukulele...

541
00:54:22,665 --> 00:54:26,043
And now she's a crazed killer
looking for a non-existent child.

542
00:54:28,921 --> 00:54:31,090
A spontaneous act of solidarity.

543
00:54:31,799 --> 00:54:34,343
Solidarity covered in shit.

544
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:42,310
This isn't a great place
for someone who likes books.

545
00:54:43,936 --> 00:54:46,814
I've worked for them for 25 years.

546
00:54:47,398 --> 00:54:49,609
For eight years,
I've sent people to this hell.

547
00:54:49,692 --> 00:54:52,820
I didn't know what I was doing,
because I didn't know.

548
00:54:55,072 --> 00:54:56,991
I swear I didn't know.

549
00:54:59,535 --> 00:55:01,204
Do you believe me, Goreng?

550
00:55:03,372 --> 00:55:05,416
You don't believe me, do you?

551
00:55:06,542 --> 00:55:09,420
Right now, I need you to believe me.

552
00:55:14,634 --> 00:55:19,805
Look at me, Goreng.
I fought cancer for three years.

553
00:55:19,889 --> 00:55:22,683
And the day I found out
I'd lost the fight...

554
00:55:25,144 --> 00:55:27,647
I applied to come here, to help.

555
00:55:36,364 --> 00:55:37,698
But you know something?

556
00:55:39,242 --> 00:55:41,327
That doesn't matter anymore.

557
00:55:42,453 --> 00:55:43,746
I don't care anymore.

558
00:55:44,622 --> 00:55:46,415
I don't care about anything anymore.

559
00:55:49,961 --> 00:55:52,046
Who the hell would bring a book here?

560
00:55:53,089 --> 00:55:57,468
Who the hell would bring
a fucking book here?

561
00:57:27,391 --> 00:57:29,727
Look, it's a miracle
nobody's touched the snails.

562
00:57:36,358 --> 00:57:37,902
Don't you want to eat something?

563
00:57:42,573 --> 00:57:44,492
I'll put a couple in each helping, okay?

564
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:55,211
Imoguiri, why don't you eat a bit?

565
00:57:56,712 --> 00:57:59,507
It's Ramesses II's turn today.

566
00:58:04,845 --> 00:58:08,140
It's the last day, you should eat.

567
00:58:18,692 --> 00:58:20,903
We don't know where we'll be tomorrow.

568
00:59:12,913 --> 00:59:14,748
Aren't you going to take her down?

569
00:59:15,457 --> 00:59:16,834
You were her friend.

570
00:59:19,545 --> 00:59:21,088
Are you going to eat her?

571
00:59:21,171 --> 00:59:23,924
Of course you are, Goreng.
Why do you think I hung myself?

572
00:59:24,008 --> 00:59:27,469
It would have been much easier to jump,
like most people do.

573
00:59:27,553 --> 00:59:29,471
But I wanted to leave you a gift.

574
00:59:30,931 --> 00:59:31,974
My body.

575
00:59:33,058 --> 00:59:35,352
I want you to feed off my body, Goreng.

576
00:59:35,436 --> 00:59:38,522
I want you to digest it,
then flush it out like redeeming shit.

577
00:59:38,605 --> 00:59:41,942
Remember: solidarity or shit.

578
00:59:42,026 --> 00:59:45,112
Do you think covering your ears
will do any good?

579
00:59:45,195 --> 00:59:47,990
We're inside your head, you idiot!

580
00:59:48,073 --> 00:59:50,534
Did you call him an idiot, idiot?

581
00:59:50,617 --> 00:59:52,411
You're talking to the Messiah.

582
00:59:52,494 --> 00:59:55,706
The Messiah of Shit,
but still the Messiah.

583
00:59:56,707 --> 00:59:59,460
- Eat me, Goreng.
<i>- The madwoman is right.</i>

584
00:59:59,543 --> 01:00:02,212
<i>It's your only chance of survival.</i>

585
01:00:02,296 --> 01:00:06,508
<i>That's right. Cut slices of my flesh
and eat my body.</i>

586
01:00:06,592 --> 01:00:07,968
Oh, Savior!

587
01:00:09,386 --> 01:00:10,888
<i>"Verily I say unto you:</i>

588
01:00:10,971 --> 01:00:14,683
<i>If you eat not the flesh of the Son of Man
nor drink of his blood,</i>

589
01:00:14,767 --> 01:00:16,477
<i>ye have no life.</i>

590
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,771
He that eateth my flesh
and drinketh my blood

591
01:00:18,854 --> 01:00:20,773
<i>hath eternal life.</i>

592
01:00:20,856 --> 01:00:23,317
<i>I will raise him up at the last day.</i>

593
01:00:24,401 --> 01:00:26,320
<i>For my flesh is meat indeed,</i>

594
01:00:26,403 --> 01:00:28,697
and my blood is drink indeed.

595
01:00:29,281 --> 01:00:31,950
<i>He that eateth my flesh
and drinketh my blood</i>

596
01:00:32,034 --> 01:00:33,702
<i>dwelleth in me,</i>

597
01:00:33,786 --> 01:00:34,828
and I in him."

598
01:00:36,163 --> 01:00:37,289
Amen.

599
01:02:00,831 --> 01:02:02,124
Here, Goreng.

600
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:05,711
With a Samurai-Plus,
it was like cutting butter.

601
01:02:09,715 --> 01:02:11,091
Do it.

602
01:02:33,739 --> 01:02:37,743
Ears, cheek, jowl...

603
01:02:37,826 --> 01:02:41,997
breast, ribs, belly...

604
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:45,417
brisket, trotters, knuckle...

605
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,836
shoulder, ham...

606
01:02:47,919 --> 01:02:49,921
loin, chops.

607
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:28,043
You, up there! Bastards.

608
01:03:28,126 --> 01:03:32,130
Come on! I know you're there!

609
01:03:32,214 --> 01:03:36,384
My name is Baharat, and I'm on fire!
You're here!

610
01:03:37,052 --> 01:03:38,678
Have you seen what level we're on?

611
01:03:38,762 --> 01:03:40,597
Level six, my friend!

612
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,974
I'm on fire! I'm on fire! I'm on fire!

613
01:03:43,058 --> 01:03:45,268
I can get to the top from here! Hey!

614
01:03:45,352 --> 01:03:48,271
You, in No. 5, answer me!
Come on, answer me!

615
01:03:48,355 --> 01:03:51,483
- What's up? You want to come up?
- Yes, I want to come up.

616
01:03:51,566 --> 01:03:53,860
- What do you want to come up for?
- What for?

617
01:03:54,194 --> 01:03:56,655
To get out of this fucking hell!

618
01:03:58,073 --> 01:04:00,826
- Do you believe in God?
- Yes.

619
01:04:01,618 --> 01:04:03,370
Yes, I believe in God.

620
01:04:04,538 --> 01:04:06,748
But what God do you believe in?

621
01:04:08,208 --> 01:04:09,668
In the One God.

622
01:04:11,002 --> 01:04:13,004
In the One True God!

623
01:04:14,214 --> 01:04:16,925
He says he believes
in the same God as us, darling.

624
01:04:17,008 --> 01:04:19,636
Come on!
I'm just passing through, I promise.

625
01:04:19,719 --> 01:04:22,681
God told me to get out of the hole!

626
01:04:23,557 --> 01:04:25,433
He says God has spoken to him.

627
01:04:25,517 --> 01:04:27,727
And what did he say exactly?

628
01:04:27,811 --> 01:04:31,982
That two pious souls
would help me get out of the hole!

629
01:04:32,065 --> 01:04:34,985
Did you hear that, darling?
I think God was talking about us.

630
01:04:35,068 --> 01:04:38,530
And he will reward you for this!

631
01:04:40,699 --> 01:04:43,577
And how will God reward us?

632
01:04:44,369 --> 01:04:46,454
With everlasting life!

633
01:04:46,538 --> 01:04:48,415
Everlasting life, no less!

634
01:04:48,498 --> 01:04:51,126
Not a bad exchange
for helping a black man.

635
01:04:51,209 --> 01:04:52,627
Come on, let me up!

636
01:04:59,551 --> 01:05:01,595
Throw up the rope. We'll help you.

637
01:05:01,678 --> 01:05:05,515
Thank you, brothers! Praise the Lord!

638
01:05:09,978 --> 01:05:12,355
See you on the outside. Got it?

639
01:05:27,078 --> 01:05:28,663
Help me!

640
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:33,209
Help me!

641
01:05:41,509 --> 01:05:43,553
Bastards!

642
01:05:43,636 --> 01:05:44,763
Pigs!

643
01:05:44,846 --> 01:05:46,306
The bitch shat on me!

644
01:05:46,389 --> 01:05:48,099
Pray for a rope to your God!

645
01:05:48,933 --> 01:05:51,353
The rope! My rope!

646
01:05:56,274 --> 01:05:58,610
You're fine. Be optimistic.

647
01:05:58,693 --> 01:06:00,570
You're screwed.

648
01:06:02,405 --> 01:06:04,282
You're screwed!

649
01:06:06,034 --> 01:06:08,036
Five, five...

650
01:06:09,454 --> 01:06:12,290
You'll never get that close.

651
01:06:13,083 --> 01:06:15,460
Five fucking levels!

652
01:07:33,746 --> 01:07:36,291
You're adapting very well, my snail.

653
01:07:38,042 --> 01:07:40,211
I attacked you.

654
01:07:40,962 --> 01:07:43,423
The mad witch committed suicide.

655
01:07:44,090 --> 01:07:47,552
Now, you can recover fully in this level,

656
01:07:47,635 --> 01:07:49,512
eating everything.

657
01:07:51,097 --> 01:07:54,225
You'll have just one more month

658
01:07:54,309 --> 01:07:57,312
before you get out with your diploma.

659
01:07:58,271 --> 01:08:00,815
See? It wasn't that difficult.

660
01:08:02,775 --> 01:08:04,819
It's just up to you now...

661
01:08:06,487 --> 01:08:08,197
just you.

662
01:08:11,909 --> 01:08:15,204
Change never happens spontaneously, ma'am.

663
01:08:16,539 --> 01:08:18,833
Maybe that's why you are here.

664
01:08:34,515 --> 01:08:36,059
Help me down.

665
01:08:42,565 --> 01:08:44,108
We use whatever weapons we can.

666
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:49,572
We get onto the platform and hand out food
at every level, just enough to survive.

667
01:08:52,241 --> 01:08:53,368
What?

668
01:08:54,243 --> 01:08:56,245
I can't manage it on my own...

669
01:08:56,996 --> 01:08:58,831
but we can do it together.

670
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:03,252
Together, we have a chance, Baharat.

671
01:09:05,463 --> 01:09:07,840
I'll try getting up next month.

672
01:09:09,884 --> 01:09:12,720
There'll always be some bastard
who won't let you past.

673
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:15,640
Going down is suicide.

674
01:09:15,723 --> 01:09:19,811
If we can get food to the last level,
we'll have broken the machinery.

675
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:23,398
The hole doesn't have machinery.

676
01:09:24,273 --> 01:09:25,817
The hole is the hole.

677
01:09:26,609 --> 01:09:28,319
The hole is a prison.

678
01:09:29,404 --> 01:09:32,323
We don't know how many levels there are.

679
01:09:32,407 --> 01:09:35,618
When I was at Level 202,
I counted, second by second,

680
01:09:36,452 --> 01:09:39,122
the time the platform took
to come back up.

681
01:09:39,205 --> 01:09:40,665
It's not very exact,

682
01:09:40,748 --> 01:09:44,001
but by calculating the time
the platform stops at each level...

683
01:09:46,838 --> 01:09:49,507
I reckon there are around 250.

684
01:09:50,716 --> 01:09:54,720
- Two hundred and fifty?
- Two hundred and fifty.

685
01:09:57,682 --> 01:09:59,725
What if you're wrong?

686
01:10:00,434 --> 01:10:03,688
What if we run out of food
and haven't got to the bottom?

687
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,775
Then we stay on the platform
and go back up on it.

688
01:10:08,568 --> 01:10:09,819
Just like you wanted to.

689
01:10:11,362 --> 01:10:14,365
- Go down...
- To go up.

690
01:10:14,448 --> 01:10:17,660
Only a lunatic would leave Level 6.

691
01:10:18,703 --> 01:10:20,621
Or two lunatics on fire.

692
01:10:50,818 --> 01:10:52,528
You're ridiculous up there.

693
01:10:52,612 --> 01:10:55,364
I hope they kill you both, assholes.

694
01:11:25,686 --> 01:11:27,730
You! Get out of here!

695
01:11:27,813 --> 01:11:29,649
Keep well back from the platform!

696
01:11:29,732 --> 01:11:31,859
Baharat! What the hell are you doing?

697
01:11:31,942 --> 01:11:34,403
Relax, we're just passing through.

698
01:11:34,487 --> 01:11:38,240
- We'll give you your rations and go.
- No.

699
01:11:40,076 --> 01:11:41,786
- No?
- No.

700
01:11:42,244 --> 01:11:44,121
The first 50 levels eat every day.

701
01:11:44,205 --> 01:11:45,956
We start handing out food on Level 51.

702
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:50,044
These two are friends of mine.
Two months ago, they helped me climb.

703
01:11:50,127 --> 01:11:52,463
These two ate yesterday,
and they'll eat tomorrow.

704
01:11:53,047 --> 01:11:54,757
A day without food won't kill them.

705
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:58,302
No way! I'm on Level 7,
and I'm entitled to stuff my face.

706
01:11:58,386 --> 01:12:00,262
I nearly died last month on Level 114.

707
01:12:00,346 --> 01:12:02,431
Where were you then, you bastards?

708
01:12:02,515 --> 01:12:04,183
Then, you should understand.

709
01:12:04,266 --> 01:12:06,268
What are you? Some sort of Messiah?

710
01:12:06,352 --> 01:12:07,895
A Messiah who has come to save us?

711
01:12:07,978 --> 01:12:12,149
A Messiah would multiply the loaves
and fishes, not take them from our mouths.

712
01:12:13,776 --> 01:12:15,903
This is crap, Baharat. Christ!

713
01:12:15,986 --> 01:12:17,530
I didn't expect this of you.

714
01:12:17,613 --> 01:12:21,992
Who are you?
The black servant of a white man?

715
01:12:34,296 --> 01:12:36,632
You! Get into the fucking corner!

716
01:12:36,715 --> 01:12:39,385
Hey! I'll kill you!

717
01:12:39,468 --> 01:12:41,929
Into the corner. Don't move!

718
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:46,392
Into the corner! Don't mess with me!

719
01:12:46,475 --> 01:12:48,936
You! Drop that! Drop that!

720
01:12:49,395 --> 01:12:51,897
On the ground! Don't move!

721
01:12:52,398 --> 01:12:53,691
Out! Or I'll crush you!

722
01:12:54,024 --> 01:12:56,152
You! If you come close, you're dead!

723
01:12:56,235 --> 01:12:57,361
Baharat!

724
01:13:03,576 --> 01:13:04,743
Sorry, sir.

725
01:13:04,827 --> 01:13:07,997
Get off there right now!

726
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,667
You idiots are standing on the food.

727
01:13:13,961 --> 01:13:15,588
Who the hell is this guy?

728
01:13:16,714 --> 01:13:18,215
A wise man.

729
01:13:18,299 --> 01:13:22,636
Did I teach you nothing?

730
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:26,265
Sir, we are trying to make sure
that food gets to every level.

731
01:13:26,891 --> 01:13:29,268
That's good.

732
01:13:30,227 --> 01:13:35,065
Very good. But manners come first.

733
01:13:35,149 --> 01:13:38,194
Win them over before you hit them.

734
01:13:38,277 --> 01:13:41,113
Sure, but what if we can't?

735
01:13:41,197 --> 01:13:45,367
Then, hit them hard.
But dialogue must come first.

736
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:48,037
However...

737
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:53,334
who up there will know if you succeed?

738
01:13:55,836 --> 01:13:57,296
The Administration?

739
01:13:59,506 --> 01:14:03,928
The Administration has no conscience.

740
01:14:04,011 --> 01:14:08,515
However, there is a slim chance

741
01:14:08,599 --> 01:14:12,353
the people working on Level 0 do.

742
01:14:12,436 --> 01:14:15,689
That's where you must send your message.

743
01:14:15,773 --> 01:14:18,067
And how do we do that?

744
01:14:32,164 --> 01:14:34,124
With a symbol.

745
01:14:34,792 --> 01:14:37,628
We need a delicious,

746
01:14:37,711 --> 01:14:42,299
perfectly presented dish.

747
01:14:42,383 --> 01:14:47,388
A luxury dish
that gets back to Level 0 untouched.

748
01:14:55,521 --> 01:14:58,273
<i>Imagine their faces</i>

749
01:14:58,357 --> 01:15:03,320
<i>when they see the hole send back
a dish like that.</i>

750
01:15:04,279 --> 01:15:08,534
<i>Then they will understand the message.</i>

751
01:15:10,661 --> 01:15:12,329
<i>The panna cotta.</i>

752
01:15:12,413 --> 01:15:17,459
<i>You must preserve the panna cotta,
as if your life depended on it.</i>

753
01:15:18,252 --> 01:15:21,255
<i>The panna cotta is the message.</i>

754
01:15:25,008 --> 01:15:26,218
Friends,

755
01:15:26,844 --> 01:15:30,431
I ask you please not to approach
the platform.

756
01:15:30,514 --> 01:15:32,933
We want you to join

757
01:15:33,016 --> 01:15:35,144
a peaceful protest movement

758
01:15:35,227 --> 01:15:38,605
that will inexorably change
the course of events

759
01:15:38,689 --> 01:15:40,566
and set an important precedent...

760
01:15:40,649 --> 01:15:42,776
What? Speak properly, asshole!

761
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:45,612
- We want you to go hungry for a day.
- A day without food?

762
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:47,281
Yes.

763
01:15:49,283 --> 01:15:50,868
Fuck that!

764
01:15:57,875 --> 01:16:00,085
The important thing is the message.

765
01:16:12,598 --> 01:16:13,974
Out!

766
01:16:24,443 --> 01:16:27,696
Another couple of levels,
and we start handing out food.

767
01:16:27,779 --> 01:16:28,822
Back!

768
01:16:32,117 --> 01:16:35,120
We don't want trouble, friends.
We're just passing through.

769
01:16:35,204 --> 01:16:38,207
We'll give you your ration and go.

770
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:17,913
- He's going to die.
- Not if you look after him.

771
01:17:17,996 --> 01:17:19,915
He's going to die anyway.

772
01:17:21,541 --> 01:17:23,710
I'll smother him with the pillow.

773
01:17:26,213 --> 01:17:28,507
Eat up and don't talk nonsense.

774
01:17:29,007 --> 01:17:32,719
I'll slit open his belly,
and I'll eat what you've given him.

775
01:17:47,526 --> 01:17:48,819
Jesus!

776
01:17:49,403 --> 01:17:51,029
This must be where Miharu woke up.

777
01:17:51,113 --> 01:17:53,824
- The mother of the child?
- That child that doesn't exist.

778
01:17:53,907 --> 01:17:54,950
Fuck.

779
01:17:55,867 --> 01:17:56,910
Shit.

780
01:17:58,453 --> 01:18:00,914
Shit! Shit!

781
01:18:01,999 --> 01:18:03,625
The platform didn't stop.

782
01:18:04,376 --> 01:18:07,879
That means there are more levels
than you counted.

783
01:18:12,676 --> 01:18:14,553
Shit...

784
01:18:14,636 --> 01:18:18,098
If there's nobody alive,
the platform doesn't stop.

785
01:18:18,181 --> 01:18:21,893
Shit. Shit. Shit.

786
01:18:26,898 --> 01:18:28,817
Miharu! Miharu!

787
01:19:45,894 --> 01:19:47,229
She's dead.

788
01:19:48,647 --> 01:19:51,149
No! No!

789
01:19:51,775 --> 01:19:52,817
She is dead!

790
01:19:52,819 --> 01:19:55,655
The platform! Let's go!

791
01:19:56,488 --> 01:19:58,073
Let's go!

792
01:19:58,156 --> 01:20:00,158
The platform!

793
01:20:27,686 --> 01:20:29,062
Get back!

794
01:21:16,651 --> 01:21:18,403
Be strong.

795
01:21:18,486 --> 01:21:19,738
Be strong.

796
01:21:22,115 --> 01:21:23,616
Be strong.

797
01:22:34,687 --> 01:22:36,314
There's nothing left.

798
01:22:36,397 --> 01:22:38,441
Just the panna cotta.

799
01:22:45,949 --> 01:22:48,034
We still have the panna cotta.

800
01:22:51,913 --> 01:22:54,290
The panna cotta is the message.

801
01:22:56,042 --> 01:22:58,878
The panna cotta is the message.

802
01:22:59,921 --> 01:23:01,839
The panna cotta is the message.

803
01:23:03,716 --> 01:23:06,886
The panna cotta is the message.

804
01:23:32,578 --> 01:23:33,955
There's nobody here.

805
01:23:36,124 --> 01:23:38,084
The platform's stopped.

806
01:23:39,919 --> 01:23:42,005
It must be the last level.

807
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,009
Get ready. We'll go up now.

808
01:24:02,442 --> 01:24:04,068
The child...

809
01:24:04,152 --> 01:24:05,320
No.

810
01:24:11,242 --> 01:24:13,494
Don't do it. Don't do it.

811
01:24:26,215 --> 01:24:30,470
No, no, no, no! Fuck! Fuck!

812
01:24:45,693 --> 01:24:46,944
Throw out the panna cotta.

813
01:24:48,321 --> 01:24:50,823
- Throw out the panna cotta.
- No.

814
01:24:50,907 --> 01:24:52,867
Throw out the fucking panna cotta.

815
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:54,994
No, no, no, no!

816
01:24:55,953 --> 01:24:57,371
Wait.

817
01:24:58,748 --> 01:24:59,832
Wait.

818
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,713
It's not hot.

819
01:25:07,090 --> 01:25:08,424
Or cold.

820
01:25:28,569 --> 01:25:30,071
It's a girl.

821
01:25:42,375 --> 01:25:43,876
She's hungry.

822
01:25:52,593 --> 01:25:53,636
Give her a bit.

823
01:26:00,518 --> 01:26:01,561
No.

824
01:26:03,187 --> 01:26:05,064
The panna cotta is the message.

825
01:26:05,857 --> 01:26:07,525
The panna cotta is the message.

826
01:26:07,984 --> 01:26:09,485
The panna cotta is the message.

827
01:26:09,569 --> 01:26:11,904
The panna cotta is the message.

828
01:26:11,988 --> 01:26:13,906
The panna cotta is the message.

829
01:27:15,676 --> 01:27:18,929
<i>"A great man who is sin-ridden
can only be a great sinner,</i>

830
01:27:19,013 --> 01:27:22,099
<i>the wealthy man who is not generous...</i>

831
01:27:22,767 --> 01:27:26,354
<i>will be a miserly beggar.
The owner of wealth is not made happy</i>

832
01:27:26,437 --> 01:27:29,857
<i>by owning it, but by spending it,
and not by spending it capriciously,</i>

833
01:27:30,608 --> 01:27:32,360
<i>but by knowing how to spend it well."</i>

834
01:27:33,319 --> 01:27:34,612
What do you want?

835
01:27:35,613 --> 01:27:38,324
I like listening to you read.

836
01:27:39,241 --> 01:27:42,870
"Knowing how to spend it well."

837
01:27:42,953 --> 01:27:48,459
You were very daring to squander
the bounties of Level 6, my little snail.

838
01:27:48,542 --> 01:27:51,629
- I didn't squander it.
- What now?

839
01:27:51,712 --> 01:27:54,173
Will you eat the black guy?

840
01:27:56,425 --> 01:27:58,010
Why not the girl?

841
01:27:58,803 --> 01:28:02,306
The girl has a gift. Haven't you realized?

842
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:10,064
Ramesses is the message.

843
01:28:10,147 --> 01:28:11,899
Ramesses II is the message.

844
01:28:12,858 --> 01:28:15,903
<i>Ramesses... Ramesses...</i>

845
01:28:16,695 --> 01:28:18,989
<i>Ramesses... Ramesses...</i>

846
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:22,326
<i>Ramesses... Ramesses...</i>

847
01:28:22,952 --> 01:28:24,411
Hey! Wake up!

848
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:27,706
The girl is the message.

849
01:28:27,790 --> 01:28:29,625
She is the message.

850
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:43,264
She's the message.

851
01:28:50,312 --> 01:28:51,689
Baharat...

852
01:31:36,937 --> 01:31:40,816
"Together, we parted,
and together, we peregrinate.

853
01:31:41,525 --> 01:31:46,530
One luck and one fortune we shall share."

854
01:31:48,991 --> 01:31:51,410
Your journey is over, little snail.

855
01:31:59,418 --> 01:32:00,794
Not yet.

856
01:32:01,795 --> 01:32:05,382
- I've got to go back up with the girl.
<i>- </i>But you are not the message.

857
01:32:07,801 --> 01:32:09,386
But I'm her bearer.

858
01:32:09,469 --> 01:32:12,139
The message requires no bearer.

859
01:32:27,905 --> 01:32:29,531
Don't call me little snail again.

860
01:32:29,615 --> 01:32:32,117
Don't use my word again.

861
01:33:00,437 --> 01:33:02,147
She will succeed.

862
01:33:04,691 --> 01:33:06,193
She is the message.

863
01:33:06,693 --> 01:33:08,945
She is the message.

864
01:37:57,692 --> 01:37:59,777
