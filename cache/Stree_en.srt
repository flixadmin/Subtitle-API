1
00:02:41,354 --> 00:02:44,145
O STREE COME TOMORROW.

2
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:55,769
O STREE COME TOMORROW.

3
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:41,642
<i>Prakash.</i>

4
00:03:58,933 --> 00:04:01,766
<i>Prakash.</i>

5
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,057
<i>Prakash!</i>

6
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:58,222
O STREE COME TOMORROW.

7
00:05:37,886 --> 00:05:41,386
<i>The heart's completely open</i>
<i>With no hook or button</i>

8
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,970
<i>No button</i>

9
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:50,760
<i>Dreams are larger than life</i>
<i>And a mind that cares for no one</i>

10
00:05:50,844 --> 00:05:52,344
<i>Cares for no one</i>

11
00:05:55,927 --> 00:06:00,219
<i>My dreams are too</i>
<i>Big to fit in this city</i>

12
00:06:00,302 --> 00:06:01,719
<i>Bigger than the city</i>

13
00:06:01,802 --> 00:06:06,551
<i>I can fix your pain</i>
<i>With just a smile</i>

14
00:06:07,176 --> 00:06:09,509
<i>I am the tailor of the heart</i>

15
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:14,426
<i>Like a bird soaring in the skies</i>

16
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:15,426
Hey...

17
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:19,051
<i>I am the tailor of the heart</i>

18
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:25,508
<i>Like a bird soaring in the skies</i>

19
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:28,800
<i>I am the tailor of the heart</i>

20
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:37,592
<i>He comes closer to me and gaze</i>

21
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,382
<i>And his magic makes me amaze</i>

22
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:47,382
<i>Stitch me a beautiful dress, darling</i>

23
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:50,257
<i>Which makes me look more charming</i>

24
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:52,924
<i>I am the tailor of the heart</i>

25
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:59,632
<i>Like a bird soaring in the skies</i>

26
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:02,340
<i>I am the tailor of the heart</i>

27
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,298
Uncle, you start this charade
in every festival, don't you?

28
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,881
Vicky, there's still time.

29
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:12,965
But, this is no ordinary ink.

30
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:17,756
These are crushed bones of a bat
mixed with the urine of a white crow.

31
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:19,465
That's how this ink is prepared.

32
00:07:19,548 --> 00:07:23,880
Uncle, sell these stories
to those who like reading Aesop's fables.

33
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:25,755
We're the modern generation.

34
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:28,547
The entire city believes
in this ignorance.

35
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,380
Vicky, any house that has
this ink outside their house

36
00:07:32,464 --> 00:07:35,672
-will always be safe from <i>Stree.</i>
-I see...

37
00:07:36,297 --> 00:07:38,255
Have you ever heard that the
Ambani's daughter was possessed?

38
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,254
Or the Tatas or Birla's were haunted.

39
00:07:40,838 --> 00:07:42,379
I know she will come.

40
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:45,129
Loosen your pockets
and let me finish writing.

41
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:48,088
Uncle, don't forget
to write on our wall too.

42
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:51,629
And listen, write it in bold.

43
00:07:51,713 --> 00:07:55,338
Otherwise, she might not
read it and come right in.

44
00:07:56,213 --> 00:07:57,838
Yes, I will.

45
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,628
Your mouth will end
up like that someday, aunty.

46
00:08:04,628 --> 00:08:06,212
Close the gate, mister.

47
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:08,587
Or the cow will barge in.

48
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:10,420
I am the watchman as well.

49
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:11,795
So you finally found some
time to come home.

50
00:08:11,878 --> 00:08:12,837
What's the matter?

51
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,878
You should also come with me
from tomorrow.

52
00:08:13,962 --> 00:08:15,253
I don't need to.

53
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:16,712
The sewing machine gives
me all the exercise I need.

54
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:18,669
And, you don't need this either.

55
00:08:18,752 --> 00:08:20,377
Or soon you'll be hanging in a hanger.

56
00:08:20,461 --> 00:08:23,086
-Was that a joke?
-And you're trying to be wise.

57
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,377
I'm already observing a fast
for the next four days.

58
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:26,627
And, you're making me waste my energy.

59
00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:29,586
-Another fast?
-Focus on your job.

60
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:32,252
Soon the ladies will queue up.

61
00:08:32,336 --> 00:08:36,336
I've told you before
stop taking alteration work.

62
00:08:36,502 --> 00:08:38,376
Loosen the petticoat, tighten my blouse.

63
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,251
We'll only accept orders
for stitching new clothes.

64
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,543
Brand new clothes only.

65
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,710
Only?

66
00:08:44,793 --> 00:08:47,001
And what will you do for
the rest of the year, son?

67
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:48,543
Ring the bell?

68
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:51,001
Daddy, explaining you is impossible.

69
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:52,335
Listen.

70
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:54,335
Listen...

71
00:08:54,793 --> 00:09:00,500
You should spend some time
learning how to run the shop.

72
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:04,209
Otherwise, if someday your dad passes away

73
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:06,042
then you won't be able
to run the show alone.

74
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:10,167
Even if Death comes himself
to collect your soul, you won't die.

75
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:14,125
Even when your fingers will become frail,
you'll still be altering lady's dresses.

76
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:17,166
Son, soon you'll be following
in my footsteps.

77
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,749
Daddy, I wasn't born
to alter lady's dresses.

78
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,958
Then what are you destined for, Son?

79
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:27,666
I don't know yet, Dad.
But I will know pretty soon.

80
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:46,332
-Let them in.
-How are you, brother Vicky?

81
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:48,248
Stitch a dress for me.

82
00:09:48,332 --> 00:09:50,290
Take down sister-in-law's measurements.
Step back a little.

83
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:53,540
Length;48, Shoulder; 14.5.

84
00:09:53,623 --> 00:09:55,040
-Take off the shawl, sister-in-law.
-Yes.

85
00:09:55,122 --> 00:09:59,497
Arm-hole;16, Wrist;
7, Chest; 38, waist; 42.

86
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:00,831
Turn around, sister-in-law.

87
00:10:01,706 --> 00:10:03,164
Hip;44, Neck:10

88
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:04,206
Deep or Medium?

89
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:06,289
No, not deep.
Keep it medium.

90
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,872
Deep is better, sister-in-law.
It's in fashion these days.

91
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:09,122
You'll look nice.

92
00:10:09,206 --> 00:10:12,956
I am telling you, my son
is the tailor-incarnation of God.

93
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:13,914
Do you want it tighter?

94
00:10:13,997 --> 00:10:15,413
The shoulder on this dress...

95
00:10:15,496 --> 00:10:18,871
But this idiot doesn't
respect his own talent.

96
00:10:32,163 --> 00:10:36,120
What is this boy, Khan sir? What is he?

97
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:38,370
I've stitched thousands of clothes.

98
00:10:38,912 --> 00:10:40,662
But the way his fingers
moves on the machine

99
00:10:40,745 --> 00:10:43,245
feels like God's fingers are
moving on the machine.

100
00:10:44,287 --> 00:10:48,412
The way he handles the scissors sounds
like Goddess Saraswati playing <i>Veena</i>.

101
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:54,119
When he puts a thread in the needle,
I can hear conches resonating in my ears.

102
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:59,036
I am sure it's some
connection from his past life.

103
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:00,994
<i>I am the tailor of the Heart</i>

104
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:08,078
<i>Like a bird soaring in the skies</i>

105
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:11,036
<i>I am the tailor of the Heart</i>

106
00:11:14,202 --> 00:11:16,493
I'll be back in 10 minutes, Dad.
Break time.

107
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:20,285
<i>I am the tailor of the Heart</i>

108
00:11:46,867 --> 00:11:48,117
Hi.

109
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:54,700
-Hi...
-Is your name Vicky?

110
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:56,866
Yes.

111
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:59,283
I saw you last year at the festival.

112
00:12:00,741 --> 00:12:01,616
Okay...

113
00:12:02,575 --> 00:12:03,783
I've heard a lot about you.

114
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,158
I don't live here, but I come
every year during the festival.

115
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:11,407
I see... okay.

116
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:15,157
-Can you stitch a dress for me?
-Okay.

117
00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:18,449
-How long?
-Two weeks.

118
00:12:19,032 --> 00:12:20,032
Can't you do it earlier?

119
00:12:22,115 --> 00:12:23,157
How about 10 days?

120
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,907
I want it on the last day of the festival.

121
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:26,699
To wear it during the
auspicious veneration.

122
00:12:36,573 --> 00:12:37,823
Vicky, please.

123
00:12:40,156 --> 00:12:41,489
Give it earlier.

124
00:12:45,906 --> 00:12:48,281
It's okay.
I'll get it done by someone else.

125
00:12:48,364 --> 00:12:49,197
Thank you.

126
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,572
Two days?

127
00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:58,905
-Two days.
-Thank you so much.

128
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,155
My measurements.

129
00:13:08,113 --> 00:13:11,154
Take off the jacket.

130
00:13:12,321 --> 00:13:13,487
Turn around.

131
00:13:14,737 --> 00:13:15,779
Turn.

132
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:17,904
Again.

133
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:23,112
-Done.
-Ohh...

134
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:25,821
Thank you.

135
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:35,153
I'll be visiting the
temple in the evening.

136
00:13:35,736 --> 00:13:36,611
Good.

137
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:44,611
-For the evening veneration.
-Very good.

138
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:55,110
Visiting the temple!

139
00:13:55,194 --> 00:13:56,319
Okay.

140
00:14:17,026 --> 00:14:17,859
One.

141
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:31,192
Saw?

142
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,650
She doesn't even look at you, and
you can already hear wedding bells.

143
00:14:38,192 --> 00:14:39,317
And you're Mister know-it-all, aren't you?

144
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,483
Whenever I pass through her lane,
she always looks at me.

145
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:45,566
No, she doesn't, she stares at you.

146
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:52,441
Are you all right?

147
00:14:54,024 --> 00:14:55,941
Will you say something? What happened?

148
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:59,649
-Love at first eye-sight.
-First eye-sight.

149
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,566
Love at first sight.

150
00:15:02,482 --> 00:15:03,941
We both attended the English
Speaking course together.

151
00:15:04,023 --> 00:15:05,606
Don't try to be Shakespeare.

152
00:15:06,648 --> 00:15:07,606
Who is the girl?

153
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,523
The same girl who attended
the festival last year.

154
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:11,148
The one with brown eyes.

155
00:15:11,856 --> 00:15:13,648
-One with the long hair.
-Yeah...

156
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:16,148
The one you bragged about last year?

157
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,898
I wasn't bragging.

158
00:15:18,523 --> 00:15:20,856
She came out of nowhere
like a cool breeze.

159
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,731
Took my hand and said...

160
00:15:24,022 --> 00:15:25,480
"Vicky, please!"

161
00:15:25,564 --> 00:15:26,730
She held your hand.

162
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:27,814
Bullshit.

163
00:15:27,897 --> 00:15:29,439
-And she even said please?
-Yes.

164
00:15:29,647 --> 00:15:32,564
-He is lying and you believe him.
-Swear on my sewing machine.

165
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:34,814
She held your hand and said,
Vicky, please.

166
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,689
"Vicky, please!"

167
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,772
Vicky, please!

168
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:43,104
"Vicky, please!"

169
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:44,729
That's what I am saying, Vicky, please.

170
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:46,396
You have no emotions at all.

171
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:47,354
Give me your hand.

172
00:15:49,313 --> 00:15:50,521
"Vicky, please!"

173
00:15:51,271 --> 00:15:52,438
Now that's emotion.

174
00:15:52,979 --> 00:15:54,354
But why you?

175
00:15:54,438 --> 00:15:55,813
She wants me to stitch a dress.

176
00:15:56,354 --> 00:15:57,271
Stitch a dress.

177
00:15:57,354 --> 00:15:59,063
I have a readymade dress shop.

178
00:15:59,354 --> 00:16:00,729
Who gets dresses stitched nowadays.

179
00:16:00,813 --> 00:16:03,770
You idiot, stitched dresses
have a different charisma.

180
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:06,437
And love is never readymade.

181
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,145
It's always tailor-made.

182
00:16:09,228 --> 00:16:10,437
Right.

183
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,645
"Vicky, please!"

184
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:14,895
Bro, put it on my tab.

185
00:16:16,562 --> 00:16:18,395
Jealous.

186
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,270
She held this hand.

187
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:21,477
Smell it.

188
00:16:21,727 --> 00:16:22,936
Sunflower.

189
00:16:23,936 --> 00:16:26,061
I think you should start
planning your wedding.

190
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,977
Even I can hear wedding bells, Janna.

191
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:30,894
Hey, snap out of your dream world.

192
00:16:31,061 --> 00:16:32,852
Today is the first day of the festival.

193
00:16:33,144 --> 00:16:36,561
Lokesh is throwing a
party at his uncle's home.

194
00:16:36,852 --> 00:16:39,144
So we're going to have
a ball for the next four nights.

195
00:16:39,311 --> 00:16:40,477
Nobody be late.

196
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:42,435
Meaning party all night and,
in the morning--

197
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:43,351
Full tight.

198
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,060
-Right.
-But that's in the morning.

199
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:51,435
<i>Just tell me why do you throw tantrums</i>

200
00:16:51,518 --> 00:16:55,935
<i>I can follow you around</i>
<i>Like your crazy lover</i>

201
00:16:56,018 --> 00:16:59,643
<i>I feel a little shy to convey</i>

202
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:04,434
<i>But, I want to sleep in your arms</i>

203
00:17:04,517 --> 00:17:08,434
<i>I've been telling</i>
<i>you since the February second</i>

204
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,017
<i>Darling, step out of Chanderi for me</i>

205
00:17:12,517 --> 00:17:15,850
<i>Come over to my mansion</i>

206
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:26,224
<i>Come over to my mansion</i>

207
00:17:31,724 --> 00:17:34,766
<i>Come over to my mansion</i>

208
00:17:42,307 --> 00:17:45,390
<i>Come over to my mansion</i>

209
00:17:50,473 --> 00:17:53,348
<i>Come over to my mansion</i>

210
00:17:53,432 --> 00:17:55,723
You guys go ahead, I'll join you later.

211
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:58,931
-What are you planning to do out here?
-My heart's a little restless.

212
00:17:59,014 --> 00:17:59,931
I guess I'll just sit here and pray.

213
00:18:00,014 --> 00:18:01,972
What's wrong with you, Vicky? Why
are you feeling so religious today?

214
00:18:02,056 --> 00:18:03,264
That dancer from Bhopal
must have arrived too.

215
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:04,181
I've been waiting for a year to see her.

216
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:06,431
-Let's go...
-Janna, you just go.

217
00:18:06,514 --> 00:18:08,181
-I'll come later--
-Hold on.

218
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,389
He's going to see that girl.

219
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:13,056
One who said "Vicky Please".
And he's making excuses to us.

220
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:15,806
Is sister-in-law coming?
Then we'll wait too.

221
00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:17,470
-What?
-No one's coming.

222
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,305
-I'll get the offerings for you.
-What offerings.

223
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:21,180
Stop making excuses, Vicky.

224
00:18:21,263 --> 00:18:22,595
Remember, females have been
the reason for the downfall of men.

225
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,638
What?

226
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,805
It was a woman who disrupted
Vishwamitra's penance.

227
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:27,345
And I am not Vishwamitra.

228
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,680
And I am not looking for a boon.

229
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,638
I am not standing on one leg and waiting
for some <i>Meneka</i> to disrupt my penance.

230
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:33,555
-What do you think?
-You explain to him.

231
00:18:33,638 --> 00:18:34,721
He's talking nonsense.

232
00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:36,762
-Take him with you, Janna.
-This is not about any girl.

233
00:18:37,345 --> 00:18:38,262
Let's go, Bittu.

234
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,262
-Go on.
-Come soon.

235
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:41,804
-Come on.
-I'm coming.

236
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,387
-You too.
-Janna...

237
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,762
-Go on.
-Why did you say yes?

238
00:19:27,385 --> 00:19:29,385
-Hi.
-Hi.

239
00:19:30,552 --> 00:19:32,677
-Hello.
-I thought you didn't understand.

240
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,342
No, I understood,
but it takes me a little time to...

241
00:19:38,092 --> 00:19:39,967
I mean I've very little experience in...

242
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:42,134
I... I--

243
00:19:42,217 --> 00:19:45,634
-Do you have a problem in speaking?
-No. Why?

244
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,259
Because if you do, it can be treated.

245
00:19:47,342 --> 00:19:50,092
No, no, I can speak pretty well.

246
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:56,883
Peacock. Peacock is our National bird.

247
00:19:56,966 --> 00:19:58,133
Peacock has a long and sharp beak.

248
00:19:58,216 --> 00:19:59,341
The Peacock is around 1.5 feet tall.

249
00:19:59,425 --> 00:20:01,925
The Peacock is a beautiful bird.
The Peacock's feather has many colors.

250
00:20:02,008 --> 00:20:03,800
Some people believe when the female
peacock drinks the male peacock's tears

251
00:20:03,883 --> 00:20:04,925
then a baby peacock is born.

252
00:20:05,008 --> 00:20:06,175
When the Peacock dances
during the monsoons

253
00:20:06,258 --> 00:20:07,466
people are enchanted to see the sight.

254
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,883
Just like I was
enchanted when I saw you...

255
00:20:12,716 --> 00:20:13,590
Sorry.

256
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,257
By the way,
you're looking really nice tonight.

257
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,715
Even you're looking... alright.

258
00:20:22,174 --> 00:20:23,049
Thank you.

259
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,965
-You're late. The veneration is over.
-Is it?

260
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:30,340
-Yes.
-I didn't realize I was late.

261
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,131
It's the ambiance.

262
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:37,298
But I will inform you before
the veneration starts tomorrow.

263
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:38,256
I will call you.

264
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:39,839
Store your number in this.

265
00:20:40,423 --> 00:20:41,423
I don't carry a mobile.

266
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:42,756
You don't.

267
00:20:43,256 --> 00:20:44,089
Okay.

268
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:51,464
If I... or anyone else wants to talk
or call you then how do they do that?

269
00:20:52,047 --> 00:20:56,630
I don't know about others,
but if you want to talk then...

270
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,547
Then?

271
00:21:00,213 --> 00:21:03,380
Just think about me. And I'll come over.

272
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,838
Fine, I will do that.

273
00:21:10,463 --> 00:21:11,337
Letter.

274
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:14,129
"To Vicky." For me?

275
00:21:15,046 --> 00:21:17,462
No. Read it in the morning,
after you get freshened up.

276
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:20,004
After...

277
00:21:21,962 --> 00:21:23,546
Okay. Thank you.

278
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:30,586
By the way, it's quite late, isn't it?

279
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:32,920
It's dark everywhere.

280
00:21:33,503 --> 00:21:35,461
I wait for this darkness.

281
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:40,961
Okay...

282
00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:48,461
FIRST NIGHT

283
00:21:49,295 --> 00:21:52,085
What's the point of owning
a bike if you can't afford fuel?

284
00:21:52,419 --> 00:21:53,960
Do you have any problem with the petrol?

285
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,044
It always gets over.

286
00:21:56,127 --> 00:21:58,294
Forget the petrol.
Think about Vicky.

287
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:00,002
Stop fighting, Bittu.

288
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,627
It was his good luck,
that he found a girl.

289
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,669
But he could've introduced us.
Why didn't he do that?

290
00:22:05,252 --> 00:22:06,335
I think there is no
girl in the first place.

291
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:07,877
And if there is one,
then there's something wrong with her.

292
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,084
What was that sound?

293
00:22:09,376 --> 00:22:11,376
What sound?
I've been speaking all this time.

294
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:12,668
What sound did you hear?

295
00:22:13,793 --> 00:22:15,459
-There, I heard it again.
-What?

296
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:18,959
-Brother Rudra.
-Hello.

297
00:22:19,043 --> 00:22:19,918
Hello, brother Rudra.

298
00:22:20,001 --> 00:22:21,834
-Are you two in your right mind?
-Yes, we are.

299
00:22:22,418 --> 00:22:24,501
-Where are you two going at this hour?
-Why?

300
00:22:24,584 --> 00:22:26,876
-What happened?
-The festival has begun.

301
00:22:27,418 --> 00:22:29,458
She will be out
hunting for the next four days.

302
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:30,500
Who?

303
00:22:32,542 --> 00:22:33,417
Her.

304
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:37,250
Stree.

305
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,333
Stop scaring him, brother Rudra.

306
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:42,708
I am not scaring him, just warning you.

307
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:47,666
Look, our city is the
only place in this world

308
00:22:48,249 --> 00:22:52,541
where no man steps out alone
during these days of the festival.

309
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:57,791
She abducts male,
leaving only his clothes behind.

310
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:59,041
Only his clothes.

311
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:02,166
It's just that I like you two,
you two are like family

312
00:23:02,249 --> 00:23:04,624
that's why I was telling you, otherwise...

313
00:23:04,707 --> 00:23:06,998
Brother Rudra, please tell us.

314
00:23:08,123 --> 00:23:09,706
Form a triangle. Come here.

315
00:23:12,498 --> 00:23:14,081
-What is that?
-Beer.

316
00:23:14,165 --> 00:23:15,498
All right. I have mine.

317
00:23:20,123 --> 00:23:21,040
Yes.

318
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:27,289
There are certain rules
for escape the wrath of Stree.

319
00:23:28,664 --> 00:23:29,789
Rule no. 1.

320
00:23:30,455 --> 00:23:36,039
Under no circumstances, and I mean
none... don't step out of the house alone.

321
00:23:37,455 --> 00:23:41,330
And only those men are safe, who have
written outside their house

322
00:23:41,664 --> 00:23:43,955
-O Stree Come tomorrow.
-Come tomorrow.

323
00:23:44,872 --> 00:23:46,288
Rule no. 2.

324
00:23:47,454 --> 00:23:52,371
If in case you've to step out, then don't
try to be a lion, be a wolf instead.

325
00:23:52,454 --> 00:23:53,579
-Wolf?
-Why?

326
00:23:53,663 --> 00:23:57,038
-Travel in packs, not alone.
-I see.

327
00:23:57,121 --> 00:23:58,621
Rule no. 3.

328
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:03,038
If you ever come across the Stree

329
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:06,037
then she will first call out your name.

330
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:08,745
Hello, Tom-Dick-Harry.

331
00:24:09,787 --> 00:24:10,703
What do you do?

332
00:24:11,828 --> 00:24:13,703
Take off your slippers,
hold it in your hand, and?

333
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,328
-Run!
-No!

334
00:24:17,328 --> 00:24:18,620
No running.

335
00:24:19,787 --> 00:24:20,953
Keep walking.

336
00:24:21,537 --> 00:24:23,912
-What to do?
-Keep walking.

337
00:24:24,494 --> 00:24:26,327
Then she will call you again.

338
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:29,286
This time with more passion.
And what do you do?

339
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:31,119
Keep walking.

340
00:24:31,202 --> 00:24:32,369
Then she will call out to you again,
for the third time.

341
00:24:32,452 --> 00:24:34,202
With an enchanting, alluring voice.

342
00:24:34,286 --> 00:24:35,702
Like an angel.

343
00:24:36,369 --> 00:24:42,536
Embrace me now because this
night may not come again.

344
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:45,201
That's the kind of emotions you'll feel.

345
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:48,035
Your breathing will get faster,
your heart will start pounding.

346
00:24:48,118 --> 00:24:50,368
Bedroom will be the only thing
on your mind.

347
00:24:50,451 --> 00:24:52,035
And what do you do?

348
00:24:52,118 --> 00:24:54,076
-Keep walking.
-No.

349
00:24:55,868 --> 00:25:01,410
No man could ever resist the Stree
when she calls out for the third time.

350
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:05,325
You will start losing
control over yourself.

351
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:07,284
And as soon as you turn around...

352
00:25:09,534 --> 00:25:10,409
Gone!

353
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:16,159
But brother Rudra, there must be some way.

354
00:25:16,242 --> 00:25:17,159
Yes.

355
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,117
Rule no. 4.

356
00:25:20,242 --> 00:25:23,991
And the most important thing to
remember if you want to escape the Stree.

357
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:27,324
At any point...

358
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:29,533
Yes, Shama.

359
00:25:29,908 --> 00:25:30,741
What?

360
00:25:30,991 --> 00:25:32,699
You're coming into my life.

361
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,783
I am coming right over.

362
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,866
Brother Rudra.

363
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:40,116
You didn't finish the 4th rule.

364
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,823
Keep walking! Keep walking! Keep walking!

365
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,157
Don't make a noise.

366
00:25:51,865 --> 00:25:57,823
Keep walking! Keep walking! Keep walking!

367
00:26:01,156 --> 00:26:04,072
-Wait a minute.
-No! Keep walking! Keep walking!

368
00:26:26,696 --> 00:26:27,655
Bittu.

369
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,280
-Janna, look.
-What?

370
00:26:32,363 --> 00:26:33,280
Someone's out there.

371
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,154
Bittu. Wait.

372
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,404
Stop.

373
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,654
Bittu.

374
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,737
Stop Bittu, for your mother's sake.

375
00:26:59,486 --> 00:27:01,736
-Why are you running?
-Because you're running.

376
00:27:02,986 --> 00:27:03,944
-Come on.
-Come.

377
00:27:04,611 --> 00:27:06,528
-What was that?
-I haven't the slightest clue.

378
00:27:06,611 --> 00:27:08,736
Don't tell Vicky anything.
or he'll make fun of us.

379
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,944
Do you understand or not?

380
00:27:11,028 --> 00:27:12,278
Do you understand?

381
00:27:13,611 --> 00:27:14,819
Where were you two?

382
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:16,819
What happened?

383
00:27:16,944 --> 00:27:18,110
-Huh!
-Nothing.

384
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:19,402
What?

385
00:27:31,943 --> 00:27:33,277
<i>Oh, my silly beloved</i>

386
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,235
<i>Snap out of your illusion</i>

387
00:27:35,318 --> 00:27:36,485
<i>Stop being afraid</i>

388
00:27:36,568 --> 00:27:39,026
<i>Stop making gestures from a distance</i>

389
00:27:41,734 --> 00:27:44,776
<i>Open the door to your heart wide apart</i>
<i>And say it out loud</i>

390
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:46,484
<i>Don't be scared</i>

391
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:48,942
<i>Tell me what's your plan for tonight</i>

392
00:27:51,026 --> 00:27:55,651
<i>I want to see the lightning tonight</i>
<i>Start a fire in my heart</i>

393
00:27:55,734 --> 00:28:02,233
<i>If you come with us, baby and</i>

394
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:04,733
<i>Shake your hips</i>

395
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,025
<i>Shake it</i>

396
00:28:06,108 --> 00:28:07,358
<i>Shake it</i>

397
00:28:07,441 --> 00:28:09,441
<i>Cross your eyes with us</i>

398
00:28:09,525 --> 00:28:10,941
<i>Cross your eyes with us</i>

399
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:12,108
<i>Shake it</i>

400
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,566
<i>Shake your hips</i>

401
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,899
<i>Shake it</i>

402
00:28:15,982 --> 00:28:17,190
<i>Shake it</i>

403
00:28:17,274 --> 00:28:19,607
<i>Cross your eyes with us</i>

404
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,857
<i>Cross your eyes with us</i>

405
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,149
<i>Cross your eyes with us</i>

406
00:28:23,857 --> 00:28:26,190
<i>Take my heart, sweetheart</i>

407
00:28:26,357 --> 00:28:28,440
<i>Take my life</i>

408
00:28:28,815 --> 00:28:30,482
<i>But just</i>

409
00:28:30,565 --> 00:28:33,649
<i>Just shake your hips for me</i>

410
00:28:33,774 --> 00:28:35,689
<i>Take my heart, sweetheart</i>

411
00:28:36,273 --> 00:28:38,481
<i>Take my life</i>

412
00:28:38,731 --> 00:28:40,023
<i>But just</i>

413
00:28:40,606 --> 00:28:44,398
<i>Just shake your hips for me</i>

414
00:28:44,481 --> 00:28:45,648
<i>Shake it</i>

415
00:28:45,731 --> 00:28:46,689
<i>Shake it</i>

416
00:28:46,773 --> 00:28:49,314
<i>Cross your eyes</i>

417
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:51,814
<i>Cross your eyes with us</i>

418
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,023
<i>Cross your eyes</i>

419
00:29:02,855 --> 00:29:04,188
<i>These beautiful sights</i>

420
00:29:04,272 --> 00:29:05,397
<i>The stars in the sky</i>

421
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,647
<i>The season of spring that's arrived</i>

422
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,147
<i>It's all for you my love</i>

423
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,397
<i>My love</i>

424
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,855
<i>And my joys</i>

425
00:29:10,938 --> 00:29:13,105
<i>Take anything you want, sweetheart</i>

426
00:29:13,188 --> 00:29:14,479
<i>These beautiful sights</i>

00:29:15,562 --> 00:29:16,812
<i>The season of spring that's arrived</i>

429
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:18,229
<i>Is all for you my love</i>

430
00:29:18,312 --> 00:29:19,354
<i>My love</i>

431
00:29:19,437 --> 00:29:20,646
<i>And my joys</i>

432
00:29:20,771 --> 00:29:22,729
<i>Take anything you want, sweetheart</i>

433
00:29:22,812 --> 00:29:25,146
<i>I want to be struck by lightning</i>

434
00:29:25,271 --> 00:29:27,354
<i>Start a fire in my heart</i>

435
00:29:27,437 --> 00:29:32,896
<i>If you come with us, baby and</i>

436
00:29:33,811 --> 00:29:36,311
<i>Shake your hips</i>

437
00:29:36,395 --> 00:29:37,603
<i>Shake it</i>

438
00:29:37,686 --> 00:29:38,811
<i>Shake it</i>

439
00:29:38,895 --> 00:29:41,228
<i>Cross your eyes</i>

440
00:29:41,311 --> 00:29:42,520
<i>Cross your eyes with us</i>

441
00:29:42,603 --> 00:29:43,770
<i>Cross your eyes</i>

442
00:29:43,853 --> 00:29:46,228
<i>Shake your hips</i>

443
00:29:46,353 --> 00:29:48,645
<i>Shake it</i>

444
00:29:48,811 --> 00:29:51,103
<i>Cross your eyes with us</i>

445
00:29:51,186 --> 00:29:53,644
<i>Cross your eyes with us</i>

446
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:56,144
<i>Shake your hips</i>

447
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,352
<i>Shake it</i>

448
00:29:57,435 --> 00:29:58,602
<i>Shake it</i>

449
00:29:58,727 --> 00:30:01,019
<i>Cross your eyes with us</i>

450
00:30:01,144 --> 00:30:02,269
<i>Cross your eyes with us</i>

451
00:30:02,394 --> 00:30:03,602
<i>Cross your eyes with us</i>

452
00:30:03,977 --> 00:30:04,852
Bye.

453
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,600
<i>Shake it</i>

454
00:30:39,517 --> 00:30:42,058
<i>Shake it</i>

455
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,599
Go on.

456
00:31:04,432 --> 00:31:05,474
Go.

457
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,889
Come on in. Come in.

458
00:31:43,222 --> 00:31:44,722
She's my girlfriend.

459
00:31:45,514 --> 00:31:47,305
I called her over for "friendship".

460
00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:51,804
Come in.

461
00:31:51,888 --> 00:31:53,096
This kind of friendship isn't
allowed in here.

462
00:31:53,763 --> 00:31:55,221
Wasn't it enough that we called a dancer?

463
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:57,221
Uncle will never approve of this.

464
00:31:57,304 --> 00:31:59,388
Just go out and start the generator, okay?

465
00:31:59,471 --> 00:32:01,304
Why didn't you inform me earlier
that there are going to be more people?

466
00:32:01,388 --> 00:32:02,804
Don't worry, darling.

467
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:05,179
I've already reserved
a room for us upstairs.

468
00:32:05,263 --> 00:32:07,970
No one's going to disturb us.
Just you and me.

469
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:09,470
All alone in a room.

470
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,387
Well, if I had known, I would've
brought my friends along.

471
00:32:12,512 --> 00:32:14,637
And even your friends could've
snuggled in with them in a room.

472
00:32:14,803 --> 00:32:15,845
Naughty.

473
00:32:15,928 --> 00:32:16,928
Go upstairs.

474
00:32:20,512 --> 00:32:22,095
Narender.

475
00:32:22,178 --> 00:32:23,470
<i>Shake it</i>

476
00:32:41,552 --> 00:32:42,802
Come on.

477
00:32:43,386 --> 00:32:46,468
-Do you have protection?
-Protection?

478
00:32:46,551 --> 00:32:48,218
No protection, no friendship.

479
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:51,051
Oh, protection!

480
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:56,718
<i>Take away my heart baby</i>

481
00:33:14,217 --> 00:33:17,634
Hello. Who is it?

482
00:33:25,508 --> 00:33:28,383
Janna, do you have protection?

483
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,674
Protection.

484
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:32,633
No, I don't carry one.

485
00:33:32,716 --> 00:33:34,508
Let's ask one of the guys.

486
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:39,133
-Guys, is anyone carrying protection?
-No, I don't have one.

487
00:33:39,216 --> 00:33:40,258
Come on, quickly.

488
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:42,466
Hurry up.

489
00:34:00,382 --> 00:34:02,757
Light's back...

490
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,631
I got the stuff.

491
00:34:05,131 --> 00:34:06,881
Why have you turned off the lights?

492
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:09,589
I like the lights on.
Because now I've protection.

493
00:34:11,214 --> 00:34:13,089
This thing is older than my grandfather.

494
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:14,964
This is of cheap quality.

495
00:34:16,131 --> 00:34:17,006
Yes.

496
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:18,422
Narender.

497
00:34:26,921 --> 00:34:28,213
-What happened?
-There...

498
00:34:28,296 --> 00:34:29,880
-What?
-Outside the window.

499
00:34:29,963 --> 00:34:32,796
-What?
-Someone dragged him out of the window.

500
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,838
Narender?

501
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:37,838
I came into the room and
someone dragged him outside.

502
00:34:37,921 --> 00:34:39,338
Stay here. You go check.

503
00:34:39,963 --> 00:34:40,880
Narender.

504
00:34:41,005 --> 00:34:42,504
Narender.

505
00:34:46,045 --> 00:34:47,004
Clothes.

506
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,420
Clothes?

507
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:50,379
Narender's clothes.

508
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,379
Narender's clothes.

509
00:34:53,545 --> 00:34:54,379
Only his clothes.

510
00:34:55,004 --> 00:34:56,170
Stree took him.

511
00:34:57,504 --> 00:34:58,837
This is Stree's doing.

512
00:34:59,545 --> 00:35:02,586
Whenever she takes any man,
she leaves his clothes behind.

513
00:35:09,169 --> 00:35:12,294
But I don't understand one thing.
How did Stree get inside?

514
00:35:12,461 --> 00:35:13,461
I don't know.

515
00:35:13,586 --> 00:35:16,919
I wrote "O Stree come tomorrow" on the
wall so that we can party peacefully.

516
00:35:18,961 --> 00:35:20,710
Someone erased it.

517
00:35:20,793 --> 00:35:24,793
I think that someone
intentionally erased it.

518
00:35:24,877 --> 00:35:26,418
Who peed on the wall?

519
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:28,835
Who was it? Huh?

520
00:35:29,543 --> 00:35:30,918
Speak up now.

521
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:35,502
-Vicky?
-You did it.

522
00:35:35,585 --> 00:35:36,960
No, it wasn't me.

523
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:39,377
Oh really? Then who did this?

524
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:43,334
Right, you went out
in the middle of the dance.

525
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:44,709
You peed on the wall.

526
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:46,251
Yes, I did.

527
00:35:46,334 --> 00:35:47,834
It didn't say no peeing here. Get lost.

528
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:50,959
Why did you have to pee
there of all the places?

529
00:35:51,292 --> 00:35:54,167
My pee, my will,
I can pee anywhere I want.

530
00:35:54,251 --> 00:35:56,459
We lost a friend because of you.

531
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:58,792
He's a junkie.
He must be high and wandering around.

532
00:35:58,876 --> 00:36:00,541
We won't hear anything against our friend.

533
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,208
-You made him disappear.
-I didn't do anything.

534
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:06,250
You made him disappear.
You peed on the wall.

535
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,916
Just a second.

536
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:15,416
Stop! Stop! Stop, guys! Stop!

537
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,958
What's the point of beating up Janna?

538
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,582
Your friend's missing, go look for him.

539
00:36:19,832 --> 00:36:21,374
Stop ranting Stree.

540
00:36:33,374 --> 00:36:34,832
It's pretty late.

541
00:36:35,624 --> 00:36:37,624
Daddy must be waiting for me.

542
00:36:37,956 --> 00:36:39,831
Even I didn't tell my
mom that I'm coming here.

543
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:44,248
Fine, let's come back tomorrow.

544
00:36:49,164 --> 00:36:53,373
STREE COME TOMORROW.

545
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:57,122
GET RID OF STREE IN JUST Rs. 150.

546
00:37:00,372 --> 00:37:01,830
Letter.

547
00:37:04,538 --> 00:37:05,830
Here's the letter.

548
00:37:13,872 --> 00:37:16,080
Brother, some madam's here to see you.

549
00:37:16,163 --> 00:37:17,371
Who is it? Tell her to come later.

550
00:37:17,454 --> 00:37:18,787
It's her.

551
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:20,287
Take a look for yourself.

552
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:26,162
Idiot!

553
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:28,537
-Did you tell her that I am at home?
-I did, brother

554
00:37:33,246 --> 00:37:34,204
Come here.

555
00:37:34,704 --> 00:37:35,786
What are you doing here?

556
00:37:36,745 --> 00:37:38,911
-I want my money.
-What money?

557
00:37:39,078 --> 00:37:40,995
My charge for the friendship.

558
00:37:41,703 --> 00:37:43,495
Your friend didn't pay
me for the friendship.

559
00:37:43,578 --> 00:37:44,995
So? So you're going to pay me.

560
00:37:45,078 --> 00:37:46,370
Why will I pay?

561
00:37:47,078 --> 00:37:50,328
I see... you pee on the
wall and I won't get my money.

562
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:52,870
Has the government put a ban on my pee?

563
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:54,620
I can pee anywhere I want.

564
00:37:55,202 --> 00:37:56,285
Pay up quietly.

565
00:37:56,869 --> 00:37:58,994
I heard that the
friendship never happened.

566
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,244
We were halfway through.

567
00:38:02,785 --> 00:38:04,869
Please sister, I don't have money.

568
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:05,785
I don't have money--

569
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:07,869
Look here, stop making excuses.

570
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,369
Otherwise, I will come here
with my friends and make a scene.

571
00:38:10,452 --> 00:38:11,327
Calm down.

572
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,202
And, your father won't like it.

573
00:38:14,284 --> 00:38:17,534
-I have heard a lot about him.
-How much do I pay, sister?

574
00:38:18,118 --> 00:38:20,284
She's collecting donation.

575
00:38:22,659 --> 00:38:24,034
I think 3000 will be fine.

576
00:38:25,784 --> 00:38:27,618
-Take some lessons from him.
-Jai Mata Di.

577
00:38:34,325 --> 00:38:37,950
So mister, are you going to stand
like this or put something on.

578
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:44,742
Take care of your son.

579
00:38:45,575 --> 00:38:46,867
He's bustling with energy.

580
00:38:51,658 --> 00:38:56,824
<i>Son, I'm going to share a</i>
<i>really important experience of life.</i>

581
00:38:57,574 --> 00:39:01,824
Youth is a weird phase.

582
00:39:03,824 --> 00:39:06,907
The body bustles with vitality.

583
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:08,824
A tank full of energy.

584
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:15,031
And this energy craves to come out.

585
00:39:15,115 --> 00:39:19,198
But this body is puzzled
about what to do or not to do.

586
00:39:19,281 --> 00:39:21,948
And this restlessness

587
00:39:23,115 --> 00:39:27,365
provokes it to have
friendship with the opposite sex.

588
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,948
Dad, I hope you know
what friendship means here.

589
00:39:30,865 --> 00:39:31,864
Friendship.

590
00:39:32,447 --> 00:39:36,197
Son, I was born in this town before you.

591
00:39:37,405 --> 00:39:38,905
I've had a lot of friendship
back in my days.

592
00:39:39,489 --> 00:39:41,572
-You had friendships.
-I did.

593
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,780
Yes, but once I met your mother

594
00:39:47,572 --> 00:39:50,030
she completely changed my point of view.

595
00:39:50,614 --> 00:39:52,613
The union of a male and a female...

596
00:39:52,696 --> 00:39:54,446
-Listen to me.
-Go on.

597
00:39:54,529 --> 00:39:58,279
The union of a male and a female is pure.

598
00:39:58,363 --> 00:39:59,738
It's auspicious.

599
00:39:59,821 --> 00:40:02,529
Like the union of Heaven and Earth.

600
00:40:02,613 --> 00:40:05,404
The confluence of <i>Shiv</i> and <i>Shakti</i>.

601
00:40:05,488 --> 00:40:08,529
But why are you telling me all this?

602
00:40:08,613 --> 00:40:12,403
I telling you so that
you don't pay for friendship.

603
00:40:12,487 --> 00:40:13,570
When did I pay for friendship?

604
00:40:13,653 --> 00:40:15,528
And what about her?

605
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:19,028
Dad, she wasn't here for me.

606
00:40:19,112 --> 00:40:22,570
-I didn't pay for friendship--
-Listen to me first.

607
00:40:23,778 --> 00:40:28,195
My advice to you is that you must
wait for a companion

608
00:40:28,778 --> 00:40:33,027
with whom you can enjoy this
process for the rest of your life.

609
00:40:33,111 --> 00:40:38,027
And learn to control this energy
bustling in your body till then.

610
00:40:38,611 --> 00:40:42,861
And if you can't, then...

611
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:44,819
Then what?

612
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:46,861
Then be self-reliant.

613
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,401
-Cater to your needs.
-Meaning?

614
00:40:50,985 --> 00:40:53,485
Meaning... yourself.

615
00:40:53,568 --> 00:40:54,860
How, daddy?

616
00:40:54,943 --> 00:40:56,068
I mean...

617
00:40:57,443 --> 00:40:58,735
-I mean...
-Loss of words?

618
00:40:58,818 --> 00:41:01,443
-Come on. Go out.
-Listen...

619
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:03,401
Come on. Go out.

620
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,025
Energy.

621
00:41:12,984 --> 00:41:14,609
Where is my energy?

622
00:41:21,067 --> 00:41:22,192
My dear Vicky.

623
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,192
If she's started with "My dear"
then she will end it with "with love".

624
00:41:27,275 --> 00:41:29,358
-Okay.
-"My dear Vicky, how are you?"

625
00:41:29,983 --> 00:41:31,191
What a stupid question?

626
00:41:31,524 --> 00:41:33,108
She just met yesterday and
today she's asking how you are.

627
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:34,024
Keep reading.

628
00:41:34,108 --> 00:41:39,399
"To be honest, I was
really happy to meet you.

629
00:41:39,899 --> 00:41:43,316
After talking to you I felt like we've

630
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:48,023
known each other for a long time.

631
00:41:49,315 --> 00:41:51,607
Since I've retreated"--

632
00:41:52,023 --> 00:41:53,023
"Returned."

633
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:57,107
Sorry, "Since I've returned
I feel like meeting you again.

634
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:00,607
And this time when we meet,
my dear Vicky

635
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:03,940
can you bring these things for me?

636
00:42:04,023 --> 00:42:05,565
PTO.

637
00:42:07,022 --> 00:42:08,397
A quarter brandy.

638
00:42:08,522 --> 00:42:09,731
Half a kilo of mutton.

639
00:42:10,356 --> 00:42:12,356
A kilo of charred glass.

640
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:15,689
Thornapple flower, Hair of a cat"

641
00:42:15,772 --> 00:42:17,231
-And...
-And?

642
00:42:17,981 --> 00:42:20,106
"A tail of a lizard"

643
00:42:20,689 --> 00:42:21,772
"Thanking you, with love."

644
00:42:21,856 --> 00:42:23,564
With love. Told you...

645
00:42:23,647 --> 00:42:25,771
What is this stupid stuff?

646
00:42:26,563 --> 00:42:28,480
Who asks to get stuff like these?

647
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,813
-Also she drinks.
-What if she drinks?

648
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:33,396
-Sister-in-law is cool.
-That's not the point.

649
00:42:33,563 --> 00:42:36,021
She wants you to get the tail of a lizard.

650
00:42:36,105 --> 00:42:39,146
And you're a tailor,
not the ancestor of lizards.

651
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:42,146
You're prepared for an impossible
mission because she asked you.

652
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:45,062
Janna has been asking you to
stitch a shirt for him. But did you?

653
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,354
I have been asking you
let's go to Goa. But did you?

654
00:42:47,854 --> 00:42:49,437
Trying to be a hero for the girl.

655
00:42:51,604 --> 00:42:52,687
You say something.

656
00:42:53,187 --> 00:42:54,395
What now?

657
00:42:54,979 --> 00:42:56,937
-She's asked so politely...
-So?

658
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,145
Then I must get it.

659
00:42:59,187 --> 00:43:01,104
-What?
-It's very simple.

660
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:04,519
Guys always do what
girls tell them to. That's it.

661
00:43:36,185 --> 00:43:38,685
Shahjahan built the Taj Mahal for love.

662
00:43:40,102 --> 00:43:41,477
And our brother is
chasing cats and lizards.

663
00:43:42,642 --> 00:43:45,351
Whoever imagined love would
fall to such levels in 500 years.

664
00:43:47,517 --> 00:43:49,934
Tell me something, don't
you think something is wrong?

665
00:43:51,184 --> 00:43:53,226
Right and wrong are just
a point of view, Bittu.

666
00:43:53,309 --> 00:43:55,059
Don't try to be wise.

667
00:43:56,476 --> 00:43:59,684
I am telling you,
I have a bad feeling about this.

668
00:44:00,851 --> 00:44:02,266
Something is wrong about this girl.

669
00:44:02,891 --> 00:44:04,475
Got it...

670
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,975
Got it.

671
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:22,474
Come on, now hurry up.

672
00:44:22,557 --> 00:44:24,515
That Stree already
took one male last night.

673
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:27,265
We must return home before
she comes out for a hunt.

674
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:30,099
Don't hurry. Why are you so scared?

675
00:44:30,182 --> 00:44:32,640
You can't handle one woman, and
now you're scared of another.

676
00:45:03,305 --> 00:45:05,472
Hello. Janna, meet me right now.

677
00:45:16,805 --> 00:45:17,847
Vicky!

678
00:45:19,637 --> 00:45:21,512
Vicky! Hi.

679
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:26,971
Hello. Sorry, I was too engrossed
in listening to music.

680
00:45:27,512 --> 00:45:28,512
What do you listen to?

681
00:45:28,596 --> 00:45:29,762
English.

682
00:45:30,387 --> 00:45:31,221
Wow!

683
00:45:32,137 --> 00:45:34,012
-Akon.
-Who?

684
00:45:34,096 --> 00:45:35,096
Akon.

685
00:45:36,762 --> 00:45:39,345
<i>Wanna be my Chammak Challo.</i>

686
00:45:40,136 --> 00:45:42,928
-The guy's like Kumar Sanu of his country.
-I see.

687
00:45:43,011 --> 00:45:44,803
-You don't know?
-No.

688
00:45:45,386 --> 00:45:46,303
I see.

689
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:49,011
You missed the veneration again.

690
00:45:49,095 --> 00:45:51,303
I guess I don't get
along with God too well.

691
00:45:52,178 --> 00:45:53,470
Right. Right.

692
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,220
I...

693
00:45:56,595 --> 00:45:58,510
I brought this offering for you.

694
00:45:59,344 --> 00:46:00,552
I'm fasting today.

695
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,094
Even offerings are not allowed?

696
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:05,385
I see.

697
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,177
Doesn't matter. Whether you
eat or me, it's the same.

698
00:46:09,885 --> 00:46:11,469
By the way, we can go inside.

699
00:46:11,677 --> 00:46:13,094
I know the priest.

700
00:46:13,385 --> 00:46:15,510
I can arrange for a
special veneration for you.

701
00:46:16,177 --> 00:46:18,176
And even make a donation
of 11 rupees in your name.

702
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:21,093
-Your name--
-Did you get the items on the list?

703
00:46:22,134 --> 00:46:23,176
Yes.

704
00:46:23,926 --> 00:46:25,509
I got everything you asked for.

705
00:46:25,593 --> 00:46:28,968
You didn't tell me which brand
of brandy, so I got every brand.

706
00:46:29,051 --> 00:46:32,593
But it's better this way.
You can try every brand, for variety.

707
00:46:33,176 --> 00:46:35,343
And, I couldn't find a
cat with completely white hair.

708
00:46:35,426 --> 00:46:36,883
She had mixed colors.

709
00:46:36,967 --> 00:46:39,050
But what will you
do with all these things?

710
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:43,008
Are you going to ask everything right now?

711
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,883
Let's go to some other place.

712
00:46:49,717 --> 00:46:52,092
-At this hour?
-Yes.

713
00:46:53,467 --> 00:46:54,467
Okay.

714
00:46:55,133 --> 00:46:56,466
But where?

715
00:46:57,757 --> 00:46:59,924
Let's go. I know a spot.

716
00:47:12,966 --> 00:47:17,923
<i>Fair you're so fair</i>
<i>Like the moonlight that's falling on earth</i>

717
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:20,881
<i>Bad very bad</i>

718
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:23,256
<i>The world's intentions are very bad</i>

719
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,965
<i>I hope no one casts an evil eye on you</i>

720
00:47:26,048 --> 00:47:28,673
<i>This thought keeps scaring me all day</i>

721
00:47:28,798 --> 00:47:31,048
<i>I hope no one casts an evil eye on you</i>

722
00:47:31,131 --> 00:47:35,047
<i>this thought keeps scaring me all day</i>

723
00:47:45,505 --> 00:47:51,297
<i>This silky dress that you've worn tonight</i>

724
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:56,338
<i>When you smile all</i>
<i>My sorrows get alleviated</i>

725
00:47:56,421 --> 00:47:59,129
<i>I hope no one casts an evil eye on you</i>

726
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:01,838
<i>This thought keeps scaring me all day</i>

727
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:04,588
<i>I hope no one casts an evil eye on you</i>

728
00:48:04,671 --> 00:48:08,379
<i>This thought keeps scaring me all day</i>

729
00:48:14,753 --> 00:48:16,545
-Vicky's gone tonight.
-Where?

730
00:48:17,212 --> 00:48:19,253
Focus on my meaning.

731
00:48:20,087 --> 00:48:21,712
I pondered over this a lot.

732
00:48:22,045 --> 00:48:25,087
And the verdict I've
reached is pretty dangerous.

733
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:26,628
What is your verdict?

734
00:48:26,962 --> 00:48:31,628
You were a genius at school,
then how are you so slow in real life?

735
00:48:32,045 --> 00:48:34,877
I go to the depth of every
matter and weigh it properly.

736
00:48:35,336 --> 00:48:36,877
My dear Pacific Ocean.

737
00:48:37,461 --> 00:48:40,044
Why aren't your depths
showing you what I can see?

738
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,544
This girl

739
00:48:44,711 --> 00:48:47,086
appears once in a year
like an endangered species.

740
00:48:47,836 --> 00:48:49,252
And always during the festival.

741
00:48:49,752 --> 00:48:51,501
And do you know who else
shows up during the festival?

742
00:48:51,585 --> 00:48:52,543
Who?

743
00:48:53,793 --> 00:48:54,710
Stree!

744
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,001
Mister, open your mind

745
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,835
Has anyone else seen her except for Vicky?

746
00:49:05,543 --> 00:49:06,501
No.

747
00:49:07,585 --> 00:49:09,835
And what does she ask him
to get in her first love letter?

748
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,542
-Cat hair, lizard leg--
-Tail.

749
00:49:14,917 --> 00:49:17,084
It's one and the same.
Who asks to get stuff like this?

750
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:20,584
He's not picking up.

751
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:23,000
-Mister, turn off your phone.
-You shut your mouth.

752
00:49:23,084 --> 00:49:24,500
And fill fuel worth 50 rupees.

753
00:49:24,625 --> 00:49:25,709
50 again.

754
00:49:25,792 --> 00:49:27,167
Why don't you ever put more?

755
00:49:27,459 --> 00:49:29,125
Why don't you try telling my father that?

756
00:49:30,708 --> 00:49:31,874
You try calling him.

757
00:49:34,249 --> 00:49:36,124
He's gone to meet her, I am telling you.

758
00:49:36,749 --> 00:49:38,791
Our friend is in trouble, understand.

759
00:49:39,499 --> 00:49:40,833
Stree has laid a trap.

760
00:49:40,916 --> 00:49:44,541
And our made in love friend,
is heading straight for it.

761
00:49:45,124 --> 00:49:46,416
He is actually cutting the calls.

762
00:49:47,333 --> 00:49:48,999
Why do people become blind in love?

763
00:49:49,083 --> 00:49:50,457
How would I know?

764
00:49:50,665 --> 00:49:52,582
Blind following is a bad thing.

765
00:49:52,957 --> 00:49:54,748
You can be anyone you want,
but not a blind follower.

766
00:49:54,832 --> 00:49:57,665
Where do you think the new couple
have gone to get cozy?

767
00:49:57,748 --> 00:49:58,665
The lake.

768
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:07,373
SECOND NIGHT

769
00:50:11,622 --> 00:50:13,372
How do you know about this place?

770
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:19,206
And why did we come here?

771
00:50:19,956 --> 00:50:23,206
Because it's dark out here.
And no one comes here.

772
00:50:27,747 --> 00:50:28,746
Dark?

773
00:50:32,621 --> 00:50:35,371
He isn't here either.
Where could he be?

774
00:50:35,455 --> 00:50:38,246
I am telling you,
we'll only find his clothes today.

775
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:42,330
Your clothes are very nice.

776
00:50:44,663 --> 00:50:45,538
Where did you buy them?

777
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:47,829
I designed them myself.

778
00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:50,370
People call me the Manish
Malhotra of Chanderi.

779
00:50:53,079 --> 00:50:53,954
Isn't it too tight?

780
00:50:54,579 --> 00:50:55,579
It's just my body.

781
00:50:55,662 --> 00:50:56,745
How do you open it?

782
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:01,912
-Listen.
-Yeah?

783
00:51:01,995 --> 00:51:04,204
-Shall we leave?
-Why?

784
00:51:04,287 --> 00:51:06,828
-Are you scared too?
-No.

785
00:51:06,994 --> 00:51:08,369
I am not scared of any ghosts or spirits.

786
00:51:08,953 --> 00:51:11,536
But how long are we going
to waste our time on a selfish guy?

787
00:51:11,619 --> 00:51:13,244
But he's our friend.

788
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:19,578
-Bittu.
-Wait.

789
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:22,369
So what else do you stitch at your shop?

790
00:51:23,036 --> 00:51:25,036
Just skirts and long dresses,
or anything else?

791
00:51:25,828 --> 00:51:27,160
Actually, we make everything.

792
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:28,327
Completely ladies fashion.

793
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:31,993
Skirts, tops, traditional dresses,
tunics. Midis, minis.

794
00:51:32,077 --> 00:51:37,077
Short dresses, long dresses,
kaftans, fringe, party dresses.

795
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:43,993
Mirror work,
stonework, designer panty, nightfall.

796
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:46,201
Nighty fall.

797
00:51:46,576 --> 00:51:47,617
That's it.

798
00:51:49,784 --> 00:51:51,492
When will you give me my dress?

799
00:51:52,076 --> 00:51:54,992
It completely slipped off my mind.

800
00:51:57,659 --> 00:52:01,534
-I troubled you a lot, didn't I?
-Of course not.

801
00:52:01,951 --> 00:52:03,242
It was no trouble at all.

802
00:52:03,451 --> 00:52:06,491
And anything for you.

803
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:13,575
I should have taken
your measurements that day.

804
00:52:14,908 --> 00:52:16,616
I thought you did.

805
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:22,200
Normally I am good at this,
but in your case, I goofed up.

806
00:52:29,324 --> 00:52:30,282
So take it now.

807
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:33,532
But I don't have my measuring tape.

808
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:35,740
Can't you take my measurement without it?

809
00:52:36,949 --> 00:52:39,032
I can, but...

810
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:40,532
Can I?

811
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,115
Take it.

812
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:44,906
-Should I?
-Take it.

813
00:52:46,281 --> 00:52:47,448
Okay, I will.

814
00:54:27,984 --> 00:54:28,943
Hello.

815
00:54:30,068 --> 00:54:31,609
-Where are you?
-Hello.

816
00:54:40,775 --> 00:54:41,900
-Bittu.
-Yes.

817
00:54:41,983 --> 00:54:43,608
I am missing my mom.

818
00:54:45,942 --> 00:54:47,150
Shall we go back?

819
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:49,483
You're right.

820
00:54:50,608 --> 00:54:55,400
-Parents are more important than friends.
-You're right.

821
00:54:56,025 --> 00:54:57,108
Let's go back.

822
00:55:02,816 --> 00:55:03,816
What happened?

823
00:55:06,316 --> 00:55:07,649
Let me check.

824
00:55:15,607 --> 00:55:17,856
-What?
-I think we're out of petrol.

825
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,231
I told you, didn't I?

826
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,981
Tell me, is your father a menial labor?

827
00:55:24,065 --> 00:55:25,273
You own a big shop in the city.

828
00:55:25,356 --> 00:55:27,648
From Manish Malhotra to Manish Behl.

829
00:55:27,731 --> 00:55:28,731
What is this?

830
00:55:29,356 --> 00:55:32,148
Whether you fill 50 rupees
petrol at a time or fill your tank.

831
00:55:32,273 --> 00:55:33,481
It's still the same.

832
00:55:33,565 --> 00:55:35,273
The petrol pump is close-by. Push.

833
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:38,647
It's your bike, isn't it? You push.
Why should I?

834
00:55:39,439 --> 00:55:41,605
-I've been pushing it since we were kids.
-What's wrong with you?

835
00:55:41,689 --> 00:55:43,189
That Stree is wandering around the city.

836
00:55:43,272 --> 00:55:45,647
And we're stuck in the middle of nowhere.

837
00:55:46,105 --> 00:55:47,397
And you want to know what's wrong?

838
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:48,897
Mom clearly said that
I should come back soon.

839
00:55:49,397 --> 00:55:53,064
If I don't hurry up,
she will lock the doors and sleep.

840
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,772
What now? Push!

841
00:56:02,063 --> 00:56:03,021
Mummy!

842
00:56:07,938 --> 00:56:08,896
Hello.

843
00:56:13,396 --> 00:56:14,438
Where are you?

844
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:17,437
Madam.

845
00:56:41,436 --> 00:56:42,852
Where are you going?

846
00:56:44,019 --> 00:56:45,477
I knew it, selfish rascal.

847
00:56:45,561 --> 00:56:46,894
What's wrong with you today?

848
00:56:46,977 --> 00:56:48,477
I am your friend, not your slave.

849
00:56:48,561 --> 00:56:51,394
First I go to your house so that you
can tuck yourself under the blanket.

850
00:56:51,561 --> 00:56:53,894
-And then I go home all alone.
-But we do that all the time.

851
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,351
-Not today.
-Fine, let it be.

852
00:56:55,435 --> 00:56:56,435
I've been listening to
your nonsense for a long time.

853
00:56:56,518 --> 00:56:57,560
-Go on.
-Fine, you don't have to.

854
00:56:57,643 --> 00:56:59,976
-Get going.
-Weird guy.

855
00:57:00,768 --> 00:57:03,601
-I hope Stree abducts you.
-Same to you.

856
00:58:40,346 --> 00:58:41,221
Son!

857
00:58:41,346 --> 00:58:43,055
No!

858
00:59:02,387 --> 00:59:06,429
<i>If you ever come across the Stree,</i>
<i>this is what you do?</i>

859
00:59:13,928 --> 00:59:16,053
Janna...

860
00:59:18,178 --> 00:59:19,136
<i>No.</i>

861
00:59:20,178 --> 00:59:21,469
<i>Don't turn around.</i>

862
00:59:22,219 --> 00:59:23,761
<i>Keep walking.</i>

863
00:59:29,385 --> 00:59:32,093
Janna...

864
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:45,760
Janna...

865
00:59:46,177 --> 00:59:49,884
<i>And the most important thing to</i>
<i>do if you want to escape from Stree.</i>

866
00:59:50,217 --> 00:59:51,884
<i>At any point...</i>

867
01:00:32,215 --> 01:00:35,924
Mummy!

868
01:00:43,507 --> 01:00:47,006
No... No... No!

869
01:00:56,839 --> 01:00:59,214
Janna...

870
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:02,923
Janna. My Janna.

871
01:01:04,298 --> 01:01:05,880
I curse that Stree.

872
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:09,838
Janna never even touched a girl in life.

873
01:01:10,255 --> 01:01:12,297
And now she must be sitting on top on him.

874
01:01:13,338 --> 01:01:18,005
I told him a thousand times not to hang
around with these worthless friends.

875
01:01:18,588 --> 01:01:21,213
Janna could've had a good job.

876
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,837
But these rascal friends spoiled him.

877
01:01:25,796 --> 01:01:28,004
Lord, give him strength.

878
01:01:28,796 --> 01:01:31,087
Give my son strength.

879
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:33,004
I know you went to meet her.

880
01:01:34,546 --> 01:01:37,796
Stop getting jealous of my love life.
Think about Janna.

881
01:01:38,504 --> 01:01:39,962
Did anything weird happen?

882
01:01:41,129 --> 01:01:42,129
Weird how?

883
01:01:42,462 --> 01:01:45,170
Anything at all, when you were with her?

884
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:47,378
What did you two do?

885
01:01:48,628 --> 01:01:49,461
Why?

886
01:01:49,753 --> 01:01:50,795
Just tell me.

887
01:01:53,628 --> 01:01:55,003
We went to the temple.

888
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,795
Then to the river banks.

889
01:01:57,586 --> 01:02:00,295
We were just sitting and chatting,
and then she disappeared.

890
01:02:00,795 --> 01:02:01,878
And didn't return.

891
01:02:01,961 --> 01:02:03,169
I knew it.

892
01:02:04,627 --> 01:02:06,502
-I knew it, Vicky.
-What?

893
01:02:06,585 --> 01:02:09,669
-That your girlfriend is a ghost.
-What do you mean ghost?

894
01:02:10,252 --> 01:02:11,794
Janna and I were coming to save you.

895
01:02:11,877 --> 01:02:14,627
-And she took Janna instead.
-What nonsense!

896
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:17,752
Snap out of your dream world, Romeo.

897
01:02:18,335 --> 01:02:20,794
Why does your girlfriend show up
only during the festival,

898
01:02:20,877 --> 01:02:22,584
and then disappear?

899
01:02:24,126 --> 01:02:26,501
She asks you to get ingredients
for black magic in her love letter.

900
01:02:27,501 --> 01:02:29,793
Have you ever seen her feet?
Are they straight or crooked?

901
01:02:30,376 --> 01:02:32,251
Did you ask her name?
Do you know her phone number?

902
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:37,168
Has anyone seen her except for you?
Because I haven't.

903
01:02:39,959 --> 01:02:40,959
But...

904
01:02:46,167 --> 01:02:47,250
Oh, fuck!

905
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:54,958
<i>I just don't understand this.</i>

906
01:02:55,583 --> 01:02:57,333
<i>How does she enter the temple?</i>

907
01:02:57,417 --> 01:02:59,583
Are these ghosts atheists?

908
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:01,707
Aren't they scared?

909
01:03:02,457 --> 01:03:05,374
She never enters the temple,
always stays out.

910
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:08,624
She doesn't take the offerings either.

911
01:03:16,291 --> 01:03:19,916
<i>Vicky, I am feeling sad for you</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

912
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:24,373
Because, of all the things in the world,
you fell for a witch.

913
01:03:28,165 --> 01:03:32,290
<i>Go and ask your Stree,</i>
<i>where is Janna.</i>

914
01:03:33,623 --> 01:03:34,915
I miss him.

915
01:03:37,790 --> 01:03:38,998
One more thing.

916
01:03:41,122 --> 01:03:43,497
Don't tell her that
Bittu told you all this.

917
01:03:44,372 --> 01:03:45,747
Otherwise, she might abduct me too.

918
01:04:19,787 --> 01:04:23,162
<i>Warning! Warning! Warning!</i>

919
01:04:23,412 --> 01:04:27,453
<i>An important piece of warning</i>
<i>for all the people in the city.</i>

920
01:04:27,662 --> 01:04:32,620
<i>Stree is out hunting</i>
<i>and the men are in threat.</i>

921
01:04:32,703 --> 01:04:36,162
<i>The method to save yourself</i>
<i>from Stree is written in this paper.</i>

922
01:04:36,245 --> 01:04:37,952
<i>Remember it.</i>

923
01:04:38,577 --> 01:04:40,369
-Show me.
-No, it's not for you.

924
01:04:40,452 --> 01:04:41,452
You're safe.

925
01:04:41,536 --> 01:04:45,452
<i>If you ever run into Stree</i>

926
01:04:45,536 --> 01:04:47,786
<i>then there's just one way to escape</i>

927
01:04:47,869 --> 01:04:50,619
<i>Under no circumstance will you...</i>

928
01:04:50,702 --> 01:04:52,077
Hello! Hello!

929
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:55,327
How do you know so much about the Stree?

930
01:04:55,411 --> 01:04:56,993
I know everything.

931
01:04:57,201 --> 01:05:01,201
Triple BA, Double MA,
literarian, musician, teacher.

932
01:05:01,285 --> 01:05:02,951
I have all these degrees.

933
01:05:03,035 --> 01:05:05,368
I spent my childhood amongst crocodiles.

934
01:05:05,451 --> 01:05:06,576
Rudra Book Depot.

935
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:09,201
But why do we write
"O Stree Come tomorrow"?

936
01:05:09,285 --> 01:05:11,743
We can write something else.
Like, "Stree, never come back again".

937
01:05:11,826 --> 01:05:14,535
As long as it's working, let it continue.

938
01:05:14,618 --> 01:05:16,617
And by the way,
if we ever have an unwanted guest

939
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,367
we don't say
"Get lost and don't come back".

940
01:05:19,450 --> 01:05:21,909
We say politely "Come back tomorrow".

941
01:05:21,992 --> 01:05:25,617
I've heard that the Stree sleeps
with her prey before killing him.

942
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:28,784
That's the system
with female scorpions too.

943
01:05:28,867 --> 01:05:31,700
She swallows the male
scorpion which she mates with.

944
01:05:31,784 --> 01:05:35,034
Listen wise guy, please don't share
your knowledge with us.

945
01:05:35,117 --> 01:05:36,491
Leave all that aside.

946
01:05:36,574 --> 01:05:38,741
Tell us what's the solution to it.

947
01:05:38,824 --> 01:05:41,158
My wife says that I should
wear a sari when I step out.

948
01:05:41,241 --> 01:05:43,616
Please don't spread such rumors.

949
01:05:43,699 --> 01:05:46,366
Or soon we'll see everyone
in our city draped in sari.

950
01:05:46,491 --> 01:05:48,199
"My beloved's arrived" type.

951
01:05:48,283 --> 01:05:49,241
No, no.

952
01:05:49,324 --> 01:05:50,991
How does she know everyone's name?

953
01:05:51,074 --> 01:05:53,241
Because all our databases
are linked to her.

954
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,240
-I see.
-Shut up, idiot.

955
01:05:55,823 --> 01:05:58,573
You see, two youngsters
have already been abducted.

956
01:05:58,657 --> 01:05:59,907
Be alert.

957
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:03,323
Poor guy was abducted from the town
square. He was such a healthy boy.

958
01:06:03,823 --> 01:06:05,282
Wasn't he your friend too, Vicky?

959
01:06:06,157 --> 01:06:08,115
But not anymore. Not anymore.

960
01:06:11,948 --> 01:06:13,782
-Keep the glass down.
-What?

961
01:06:15,156 --> 01:06:18,531
Trying to be over smart. Huh!
Get lost.

962
01:06:20,489 --> 01:06:22,031
He's still alive. My friend isn't dead.

963
01:06:53,737 --> 01:06:55,029
Brother.

964
01:07:01,904 --> 01:07:03,737
Sir. Sir.

965
01:07:27,403 --> 01:07:31,777
Brother Vicky, you are amazing.
You stitched this dress in 31 minutes.

966
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:32,693
Sir.

967
01:07:58,442 --> 01:08:01,942
-What happened?
-No, it's nothing.

968
01:08:23,983 --> 01:08:25,983
No, I haven't done anything.
I didn't do anything.

969
01:08:26,066 --> 01:08:29,524
Don't kill me, Stree. Don't kill me.

970
01:08:29,607 --> 01:08:30,440
What happened?

971
01:08:30,524 --> 01:08:33,482
-Don't kill me, Stree. Don't kill me.
-Vicky, what's wrong?

972
01:08:36,107 --> 01:08:37,315
What happened?

973
01:08:41,732 --> 01:08:43,899
It's nothing.

974
01:08:43,982 --> 01:08:46,274
You look like you saw a ghost.

975
01:08:46,357 --> 01:08:49,398
Ghost. No... ghost. Nothing like that.

976
01:08:49,481 --> 01:08:51,981
-Are you all right, Vicky?
-Yes, I am okay.

977
01:08:52,064 --> 01:08:53,106
I am all right.

978
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:58,273
-Is it ready?
-Yes, it is.

979
01:09:00,356 --> 01:09:02,689
-Thank you.
-It's all right.

980
01:09:05,814 --> 01:09:07,106
Shall we go out somewhere?

981
01:09:07,773 --> 01:09:08,647
Out?

982
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:10,980
I'll take you to another
one of my favorite spots.

983
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,980
No! This is my favorite place.

984
01:09:14,063 --> 01:09:16,480
-Let's sit here.
-Okay.

985
01:09:29,062 --> 01:09:30,812
There's magic in your hands.

986
01:09:33,478 --> 01:09:35,521
And even in my feet.

987
01:09:35,603 --> 01:09:38,187
I can turn it around like this.

988
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,646
Can you turn your feet around too?

989
01:09:41,396 --> 01:09:45,021
-Is there a problem?
-No. What problem?

990
01:09:45,103 --> 01:09:46,187
There is no problem.

991
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:53,145
Can I ask you a question
for my personal knowledge?

992
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:56,395
Do you believe in ghosts and spirits?

993
01:09:57,645 --> 01:10:01,645
I've heard that a woman
wanders in this city at night.

994
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:03,436
Called Stree.

995
01:10:04,227 --> 01:10:07,894
She is a witch.
She abducts males.

996
01:10:08,601 --> 01:10:09,685
Strips them.

997
01:10:11,351 --> 01:10:14,019
I know she must have a good reason.

998
01:10:14,269 --> 01:10:16,601
No one is born as a witch, Right.

999
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:18,851
I understand.

1000
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:23,601
My friend Janna, has disappeared as well.

1001
01:10:23,894 --> 01:10:25,309
He's a very nice guy.

1002
01:10:26,143 --> 01:10:28,059
People say that Stree took him.

1003
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,475
Have you seen Janna?

1004
01:10:38,725 --> 01:10:40,059
Can I ask you a question?

1005
01:10:41,643 --> 01:10:44,892
Its personal,
but don't take it personally.

1006
01:10:46,267 --> 01:10:48,308
Are you...

1007
01:10:49,267 --> 01:10:50,099
Are you...

1008
01:10:50,183 --> 01:10:51,892
I mean not intentionally.

1009
01:10:51,974 --> 01:10:54,433
Are you... Stree?

1010
01:10:55,767 --> 01:10:58,392
I just asked.
I don't have a problem.

1011
01:10:58,517 --> 01:10:59,933
I was just confirming.

1012
01:11:00,225 --> 01:11:03,267
If you're a ghost...
I mean you are what you are.

1013
01:11:04,182 --> 01:11:06,307
If it's anything like that,
please tell me now.

1014
01:11:06,391 --> 01:11:10,391
I'll just be prepared mentally.
That's all.

1015
01:11:16,182 --> 01:11:17,182
Uncle.

1016
01:11:17,391 --> 01:11:19,432
Do you see that girl standing there?

1017
01:11:22,474 --> 01:11:24,556
-What girl?
-That one...

1018
01:11:25,265 --> 01:11:26,223
That...

1019
01:11:39,556 --> 01:11:41,473
You should listen
to your friends sometimes.

1020
01:11:44,514 --> 01:11:47,597
But how can a beautiful
woman like her be Stree?

1021
01:11:48,264 --> 01:11:49,555
Was she beautiful?

1022
01:11:51,389 --> 01:11:52,305
Sorry.

1023
01:11:54,472 --> 01:11:57,264
Think about Janna.
What condition will he be in?

1024
01:11:58,389 --> 01:12:00,139
Lying somewhere naked in this cold.

1025
01:12:02,929 --> 01:12:03,971
What now?

1026
01:12:07,096 --> 01:12:10,679
We'll have to find someone who's
an expert in such absurd folklores.

1027
01:12:20,804 --> 01:12:23,345
You came to the right place.
I know everything.

1028
01:12:23,845 --> 01:12:26,720
-Doesn't get me high.
-Then why do you drink?

1029
01:12:27,428 --> 01:12:29,012
In Shama's memory, that's why.

1030
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:30,845
Leave Shama aside.

1031
01:12:30,928 --> 01:12:35,262
-And tell us what you know about Stree.
-I am doing research on Ms. Stree.

1032
01:12:35,553 --> 01:12:37,637
And like they say, the fruits
of hard work is always sweet.

1033
01:12:38,178 --> 01:12:39,803
-And I got one too.
-Sweet fruit?

1034
01:12:39,887 --> 01:12:41,594
No. Book.

1035
01:12:42,302 --> 01:12:44,927
-Book?
-Just a minute.

1036
01:12:47,552 --> 01:12:48,761
Here you go.

1037
01:12:53,927 --> 01:12:56,011
Oh, KS.

1038
01:12:57,261 --> 01:12:58,261
Ka Su...

1039
01:12:58,344 --> 01:12:59,676
-Are you researching on this?
-Not that.

1040
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,593
This one. This is it.
This is Chanderi Puran.

1041
01:13:03,176 --> 01:13:04,551
Chanderi has its own manuscript.

1042
01:13:04,635 --> 01:13:08,135
Our city is older than you think.

1043
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:10,301
The spot where you're sitting.

1044
01:13:10,426 --> 01:13:12,510
If we dig beneath it,
you'll find the Harappa Civilization.

1045
01:13:12,843 --> 01:13:14,218
Right here. Harappa.

1046
01:13:14,843 --> 01:13:15,926
Exactly under this spot.

1047
01:13:16,426 --> 01:13:20,717
So look, Chanderi Puran
written by Shankar Shashtri.

1048
01:13:21,884 --> 01:13:23,175
Here we go.

1049
01:13:24,842 --> 01:13:26,592
Many years ago.

1050
01:13:28,759 --> 01:13:32,800
Many years ago there used to be
a beautiful and attractive courtesan.

1051
01:13:33,092 --> 01:13:35,759
Every male in the city
would dream about her.

1052
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:41,216
Finally, she found a man
who loved soul and not her body.

1053
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:42,383
True love.

1054
01:13:42,466 --> 01:13:44,258
And talk about your generation.

1055
01:13:44,341 --> 01:13:47,341
Love at first sight.
Then your place or mine.

1056
01:13:47,424 --> 01:13:48,924
What direction is this
generation heading to?

1057
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:51,133
Brother Rudra. Don't be a dad.

1058
01:13:51,216 --> 01:13:53,008
-Please read ahead.
-Yes.

1059
01:13:53,591 --> 01:13:55,924
They both decided to get married.

1060
01:13:56,216 --> 01:13:58,382
But the other people
couldn't tolerate their joy.

1061
01:13:58,465 --> 01:14:04,298
And before their wedding night, the
jealous people murdered both of them.

1062
01:14:05,965 --> 01:14:07,840
Since then she has been
wandering in this city.

1063
01:14:08,048 --> 01:14:12,423
Looking for her love,
and complete her wedding night.

1064
01:14:12,507 --> 01:14:16,673
And this can only happen when
she will find her lost love again.

1065
01:14:16,757 --> 01:14:18,797
Such insolent people.

1066
01:14:18,881 --> 01:14:21,256
They can't tolerate someone's happiness.

1067
01:14:21,339 --> 01:14:23,214
Every female has the
right to find her true love.

1068
01:14:23,297 --> 01:14:27,131
Brother Rudra.
We can have this debate later.

1069
01:14:27,297 --> 01:14:29,964
First, tell us if there's
a method to stop Stree?

1070
01:14:30,714 --> 01:14:32,881
There is just one way to get rid of Stree.

1071
01:14:32,964 --> 01:14:34,464
-Yeah
-Turn the page.

1072
01:14:35,214 --> 01:14:36,671
-Turn the page.
-Okay.

1073
01:14:39,713 --> 01:14:42,588
The city's main business was silk.

1074
01:14:42,671 --> 01:14:44,380
People had such high
scarcity for education

1075
01:14:44,463 --> 01:14:46,588
that they actually believed
that the moon sun's brother.

1076
01:14:46,671 --> 01:14:48,213
The main caste in the...

1077
01:14:48,296 --> 01:14:50,880
How come Shastri turn
up in south from the west.

1078
01:14:52,255 --> 01:14:54,963
After page 66 there is page 80.
Where are the rest of the pages?

1079
01:14:55,088 --> 01:14:57,879
This is why I don't let anyone in.

1080
01:14:57,962 --> 01:15:00,545
Children tear pages from
the book and make paper boats.

1081
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:03,087
-How will we save Janna now?
-Wait a minute.

1082
01:15:04,712 --> 01:15:06,045
I've seen this place.

1083
01:15:06,545 --> 01:15:07,629
-You have?
-Yes.

1084
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:10,670
-Where?
-Above the hill.

1085
01:15:11,212 --> 01:15:13,254
-We should go there.
-Then let's go.

1086
01:15:13,337 --> 01:15:14,754
-We might find something here.
-Yes.

1087
01:15:14,836 --> 01:15:17,419
-Go. Go on you two.
-What do you mean?

1088
01:15:18,128 --> 01:15:19,836
-You must come along too.
-Me?

1089
01:15:19,919 --> 01:15:22,836
-Brother Rudra, you have done research.
-Of course.

1090
01:15:22,919 --> 01:15:25,628
I see Wait a minute.
Let me take this along.

1091
01:15:27,544 --> 01:15:29,169
Shama, I am going.

1092
01:15:33,211 --> 01:15:34,627
THIRD NIGHT

1093
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:36,335
We'll run out of petrol.

1094
01:15:36,418 --> 01:15:39,210
-How much further, Vicky?
-Just a little further.

1095
01:15:42,877 --> 01:15:44,877
Stop! Stop.

1096
01:15:55,126 --> 01:15:59,167
What? I am allergic to dust. Come on.

1097
01:16:03,709 --> 01:16:05,167
It's so dark around here.

1098
01:16:06,542 --> 01:16:10,459
-What if she abducts me forcefully?
-She is a woman, not a man.

1099
01:16:10,834 --> 01:16:13,458
Women don't use force
against your will, like men.

1100
01:16:13,833 --> 01:16:15,791
She will ask for your permission first.

1101
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:18,500
Hello Mr. Tom-Dick-or-Harry.

1102
01:16:18,583 --> 01:16:19,875
And if you turn around.

1103
01:16:20,041 --> 01:16:23,083
Then she will think it's a yes.
Yes, means yes.

1104
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:24,833
Then she will take you away.

1105
01:16:24,916 --> 01:16:27,375
So under no circumstance
will you turn around.

1106
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:29,791
-No turning around.
-Let's go.

1107
01:16:39,374 --> 01:16:40,457
Janna.

1108
01:16:41,457 --> 01:16:42,374
Janna.

1109
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,082
Janna.

1110
01:16:56,039 --> 01:16:57,081
Janna.

1111
01:17:02,831 --> 01:17:04,123
Janna.

1112
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:09,873
What are you doing?

1113
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:19,163
Brother Rudra. Give me the alcohol.

1114
01:17:20,163 --> 01:17:20,997
Alcohol.

1115
01:17:21,955 --> 01:17:22,788
Why?

1116
01:17:24,497 --> 01:17:26,288
This is not a time for a drink.

1117
01:17:27,372 --> 01:17:28,788
No. For power.

1118
01:17:29,372 --> 01:17:30,537
No power.

1119
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,246
Okay, give me.

1120
01:17:37,746 --> 01:17:39,287
Save some for me.

1121
01:17:40,412 --> 01:17:42,037
You're worried about the alcohol.

1122
01:17:42,121 --> 01:17:43,412
You go that way.

1123
01:17:43,496 --> 01:17:45,329
Brother Rudra, you search upstairs.

1124
01:17:45,412 --> 01:17:46,287
-Why?
-And I will look here.

1125
01:17:46,371 --> 01:17:48,412
-Let's stay together.
-We don't have time for that.

1126
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:46,451
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!

1127
01:18:53,283 --> 01:18:56,867
Hail Goddess! Hail Goddess!

1128
01:18:58,117 --> 01:19:02,117
Mom always told me to learn
the Hanuman Chalisa.

1129
01:19:03,283 --> 01:19:04,783
Now I regret.

1130
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:07,241
Sorry, mom.

1131
01:19:08,491 --> 01:19:09,782
Oh my god!

1132
01:19:10,907 --> 01:19:12,449
God, please save me.

1133
01:19:16,116 --> 01:19:20,157
Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake!

1134
01:19:20,241 --> 01:19:22,782
Run.

1135
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:42,323
Mummy!

1136
01:19:48,405 --> 01:19:50,864
Brother Rudra! Where are you going?

1137
01:19:50,947 --> 01:19:52,197
I was just warming up.

1138
01:19:52,655 --> 01:19:54,697
-I saw her.
-Did you?

1139
01:19:56,614 --> 01:19:57,447
Brother Rudra!

1140
01:20:10,779 --> 01:20:11,988
Janna.

1141
01:20:48,652 --> 01:20:50,861
Vicky...

1142
01:20:56,361 --> 01:20:59,652
Stree, it's me. Vicky.

1143
01:21:00,777 --> 01:21:02,610
Remember I stitched your dress.

1144
01:21:03,943 --> 01:21:09,651
I am here for Janna, he's a very nice guy.

1145
01:21:09,776 --> 01:21:11,818
In fact, he calls you sister-in-law.

1146
01:21:11,901 --> 01:21:14,568
Vicky...

1147
01:21:15,901 --> 01:21:20,485
I stitched your dress in 31 minutes,
Stree, and you want to abduct me.

1148
01:21:21,485 --> 01:21:22,984
You hurt me.

1149
01:21:23,567 --> 01:21:25,484
I won't turn around.

1150
01:21:26,275 --> 01:21:27,984
-Vicky...
-I can't hear you at all.

1151
01:21:45,941 --> 01:21:47,316
I'll not turn back.

1152
01:21:49,191 --> 01:21:50,733
I'll not turn around.

1153
01:21:53,149 --> 01:21:54,358
Daddy.

1154
01:21:55,774 --> 01:21:56,608
Daddy.

1155
01:22:57,146 --> 01:22:58,229
Vicky!

1156
01:23:08,187 --> 01:23:09,729
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

1157
01:23:09,812 --> 01:23:12,270
Yes, I am fine.

1158
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,229
Is she gone?

1159
01:23:15,312 --> 01:23:16,145
Don't know.

1160
01:23:17,145 --> 01:23:18,228
Don't know?

1161
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,769
But at least there is a relief.

1162
01:23:24,311 --> 01:23:25,853
You're not Stree.

1163
01:23:26,728 --> 01:23:28,394
You know, like in the morning...

1164
01:23:30,186 --> 01:23:31,269
Sorry.

1165
01:23:31,353 --> 01:23:32,603
Shall we go back?

1166
01:23:33,061 --> 01:23:34,311
-But Vicky is still inside.
-Bittu.

1167
01:23:34,978 --> 01:23:37,935
Vicky, where were you?

1168
01:23:38,018 --> 01:23:39,018
Did you see Janna?

1169
01:23:40,685 --> 01:23:41,518
No!

1170
01:23:41,602 --> 01:23:43,518
Run brother Rudra.
He's fallen prey as well.

1171
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:45,143
That's not her.

1172
01:23:45,227 --> 01:23:46,893
-She is not Stree.
-You are lying.

1173
01:23:46,977 --> 01:23:48,018
That's the girl.

1174
01:23:48,143 --> 01:23:49,393
The letter... Remember?

1175
01:23:49,477 --> 01:23:50,352
The dress.

1176
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:52,393
"Vicky Please!"

1177
01:23:53,227 --> 01:23:54,310
That's her.

1178
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:57,184
I swear she risked
her own life to save mine.

1179
01:23:57,267 --> 01:23:58,559
You two would've...

1180
01:23:59,267 --> 01:24:00,267
Been amazed.

1181
01:24:00,351 --> 01:24:02,101
She flung her dagger at the witch.

1182
01:24:02,184 --> 01:24:04,851
If we had posted that video on Youtube,
it would've been an instant hit.

1183
01:24:05,267 --> 01:24:06,351
#daggergirl.

1184
01:24:06,434 --> 01:24:09,684
But what is she doing here?
How does she know we're here?

1185
01:24:09,767 --> 01:24:11,934
Your friend is not
the only one who's missing.

1186
01:24:12,559 --> 01:24:14,392
Many people go missing every year.

1187
01:24:14,684 --> 01:24:17,016
I've been coming here for the
past three years during the festival.

1188
01:24:17,641 --> 01:24:20,016
So that I can get rid of her for good.

1189
01:24:20,641 --> 01:24:23,975
Just like the others,
I've lost someone too.

1190
01:24:24,058 --> 01:24:26,683
I know he will never come back.

1191
01:24:28,141 --> 01:24:29,183
But still.

1192
01:24:30,766 --> 01:24:33,225
You can share your sorrow with me.

1193
01:24:33,808 --> 01:24:35,140
It will lighten your burden.

1194
01:24:37,224 --> 01:24:39,515
-No
-No? Okay.

1195
01:24:40,099 --> 01:24:42,140
By the way, where did you learn this art?

1196
01:24:42,765 --> 01:24:44,057
I had to wander around for it.

1197
01:24:44,515 --> 01:24:48,182
I went to ascetics, and tantric.

1198
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:53,140
Tantra, magic, hypnosis, and spells from
the red book. I learned everything.

1199
01:24:53,724 --> 01:24:56,223
I've had only one mission
for the past three years.

1200
01:24:56,514 --> 01:24:57,848
Defeating Stree.

1201
01:24:59,764 --> 01:25:03,306
I tried everything I knew.

1202
01:25:03,806 --> 01:25:04,889
But it wasn't enough.

1203
01:25:05,473 --> 01:25:07,264
I thought I was ready.

1204
01:25:07,889 --> 01:25:10,056
I thought that I would
defeat her this time.

1205
01:25:10,973 --> 01:25:15,638
You see, ma'am. I've done
extensive research on this subject.

1206
01:25:15,722 --> 01:25:16,722
Research.

1207
01:25:16,805 --> 01:25:22,055
I have books on magic spells, hypnosis,
and other art forms in my library.

1208
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:24,013
You can come over if you need any help.

1209
01:25:24,097 --> 01:25:25,847
Even we have a shop for lady's fashion.

1210
01:25:25,930 --> 01:25:26,972
Best in town.

1211
01:25:27,097 --> 01:25:29,555
If you need anything at any time,
just let me know.

1212
01:25:29,722 --> 01:25:32,804
And anyway it's always
better than stitched clothes.

1213
01:25:33,387 --> 01:25:34,762
I don't like readymade.

1214
01:25:38,179 --> 01:25:39,137
Shall we?

1215
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:43,346
What happened?

1216
01:25:56,428 --> 01:26:01,511
Janna. My Janna is back.
My son is back.

1217
01:26:02,095 --> 01:26:04,845
My son, where were you?

1218
01:26:05,428 --> 01:26:08,428
-Where were you...
-His clothes will tear.

1219
01:26:08,511 --> 01:26:10,011
He's lost so much weight.

1220
01:26:10,553 --> 01:26:12,802
Forgive me, son. Forgive me.

1221
01:26:12,885 --> 01:26:14,885
You really are his friend.

1222
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:16,760
-I said such bad things.
-It's all right.

1223
01:26:16,844 --> 01:26:20,719
-It's okay, aunty.
-Janna, it's your mom, son.

1224
01:26:20,802 --> 01:26:21,802
I want to go sleep.

1225
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:24,010
He wants to sleep.

1226
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:26,260
-Yes son, let's go.
-Come on.

1227
01:26:26,344 --> 01:26:29,052
-Please send my coat back.
-Okay, aunty.

1228
01:26:30,177 --> 01:26:31,009
Bye, Janna.

1229
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:09,924
Aunty. Aunty.

1230
01:27:10,007 --> 01:27:12,757
She took my husband.

1231
01:27:12,841 --> 01:27:16,841
She took my son too.

1232
01:27:16,924 --> 01:27:19,674
She took him too.

1233
01:27:21,007 --> 01:27:23,424
She took my husband.

1234
01:27:23,507 --> 01:27:25,924
My husband too.

1235
01:27:46,131 --> 01:27:48,672
But, how did so many people disappear?

1236
01:27:50,339 --> 01:27:52,130
Someone has erased the ink.

1237
01:27:58,714 --> 01:28:00,922
Janna, look what Stree did.

1238
01:28:01,005 --> 01:28:03,589
She abducted a dozen men.

1239
01:28:03,714 --> 01:28:06,297
And she's also erased the ink. Janna.

1240
01:28:08,004 --> 01:28:08,879
You...

1241
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:15,129
Janna.

1242
01:28:19,296 --> 01:28:20,296
Janna...

1243
01:28:22,504 --> 01:28:24,338
Why are you sitting like that, Janna?

1244
01:28:27,587 --> 01:28:28,712
And your palms...

1245
01:28:30,587 --> 01:28:31,753
Janna.

1246
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:41,962
I am your mother. Listen to your mom, son.

1247
01:28:42,462 --> 01:28:43,462
Janna.

1248
01:28:44,128 --> 01:28:45,752
Janna, spare your friends at least.

1249
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:49,419
Listen to me, I am already 70% damaged.

1250
01:28:53,877 --> 01:28:57,544
Janna. We're humans, not kites.

1251
01:28:58,919 --> 01:28:59,752
Janna.

1252
01:28:59,836 --> 01:29:02,836
Vicky, look at Janna's hand.
He erased the ink.

1253
01:29:03,419 --> 01:29:05,210
-Divert his attention?
-Me?

1254
01:29:05,293 --> 01:29:06,293
Go.

1255
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:08,710
-Janna.
-Someone get a blanket.

1256
01:29:10,001 --> 01:29:11,043
Janna.

1257
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:12,293
Janna.

1258
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,751
Janna. Janna, stop.

1259
01:29:14,835 --> 01:29:19,960
Janna...

1260
01:29:21,210 --> 01:29:24,085
It's Vicky.

1261
01:29:25,542 --> 01:29:27,417
Janna.

1262
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:28,584
Quiet!

1263
01:29:28,917 --> 01:29:31,667
Or else I will slap you. Quiet!

1264
01:29:35,709 --> 01:29:38,250
Janna. What are you doing?

1265
01:29:39,125 --> 01:29:40,292
It's Vicky.

1266
01:29:42,834 --> 01:29:45,208
Bittu! Bittu!

1267
01:29:50,291 --> 01:29:51,416
Come on.

1268
01:29:56,583 --> 01:29:58,333
This is the only solution left.

1269
01:29:58,499 --> 01:30:01,208
Wear sari and bangles like women do.

1270
01:30:01,333 --> 01:30:02,791
Your solutions were not effective at all.

1271
01:30:02,916 --> 01:30:05,373
That Stree took 20 men.

1272
01:30:06,582 --> 01:30:07,582
Yes, Shama.

1273
01:30:07,707 --> 01:30:09,498
Yes, I know. I am coming.

1274
01:30:09,623 --> 01:30:10,707
I am coming.

1275
01:30:10,790 --> 01:30:12,957
<i>We want our youngsters back.</i>

1276
01:30:13,457 --> 01:30:16,457
<i>Whoever brings the missing men back</i>

1277
01:30:16,790 --> 01:30:23,164
<i>will be rewarded Rs.10,000 for every man.</i>

1278
01:30:24,289 --> 01:30:25,456
<i>Understand?</i>

1279
01:30:28,247 --> 01:30:29,789
This city wants freedom.

1280
01:30:29,872 --> 01:30:31,456
Freedom.

1281
01:30:31,581 --> 01:30:33,289
Everybody knows that

1282
01:30:33,372 --> 01:30:34,664
Stree is a thief.

1283
01:30:34,747 --> 01:30:37,164
Let's all unite.

1284
01:30:37,247 --> 01:30:38,747
And drive Stree away.

1285
01:30:38,831 --> 01:30:40,414
You give us men.

1286
01:30:40,497 --> 01:30:42,080
GET RID OF STREE IN JUST Rs. 250.

1287
01:30:42,163 --> 01:30:44,080
We'll give you freedom.

1288
01:30:45,288 --> 01:30:48,413
It's the smoke coming on my face.

1289
01:30:49,621 --> 01:30:52,621
-Bittu, get me out.
-Wait.

1290
01:30:52,705 --> 01:30:54,288
Don't listen to him, today.

1291
01:30:54,371 --> 01:30:57,330
David has turned into Goliath today.

1292
01:30:57,746 --> 01:30:59,496
How can someone beat up your own friend?

1293
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:01,370
We cannot waste any more time.

1294
01:31:01,454 --> 01:31:03,370
Janna is completely under her control.

1295
01:31:03,537 --> 01:31:05,954
We must do something
before the festival ends.

1296
01:31:06,037 --> 01:31:09,620
You're experienced in this field,
suggest something.

1297
01:31:10,287 --> 01:31:14,454
If we can find out more about Stree,
then I can come up with something.

1298
01:31:15,495 --> 01:31:16,662
But from where?

1299
01:31:17,662 --> 01:31:20,162
-We found a book at his shop.
-Library.

1300
01:31:21,869 --> 01:31:24,078
We found a book in his library.

1301
01:31:24,369 --> 01:31:25,744
But the pages were missing.

1302
01:31:27,078 --> 01:31:30,411
What if we find the
guy who wrote that book

1303
01:31:30,619 --> 01:31:32,119
then he would know what
was written on those pages.

1304
01:31:32,203 --> 01:31:33,286
-Yes.
-Yes?

1305
01:31:33,369 --> 01:31:35,994
-Do you know that guy?
-I know everything.

1306
01:31:36,078 --> 01:31:37,744
-Everything?
-Is he alive?

1307
01:31:38,703 --> 01:31:39,993
He lives in Emergency.

1308
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,368
ICU!

1309
01:31:42,910 --> 01:31:43,952
Emergency.

1310
01:32:08,367 --> 01:32:10,326
Which book are you talking about?

1311
01:32:12,451 --> 01:32:13,992
Respected Mr. Shastri.

1312
01:32:14,076 --> 01:32:18,616
You wrote the history
of our city in a book.

1313
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:21,991
Chanderi Puran, remember?

1314
01:32:22,366 --> 01:32:25,241
The book was launched
in my Rudra Book Depot.

1315
01:32:26,783 --> 01:32:29,575
You used to sell eroticas back then.

1316
01:32:30,575 --> 01:32:33,866
Mr. Shashtri,
that Stree abducted our friend.

1317
01:32:33,950 --> 01:32:35,658
She abducted many more men too.

1318
01:32:35,741 --> 01:32:37,574
Can we get them back?

1319
01:32:38,449 --> 01:32:39,657
Stree.

1320
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:41,449
Please, Mr. Shashtri.

1321
01:32:42,115 --> 01:32:43,157
We request.

1322
01:32:46,032 --> 01:32:47,782
Did the emergency end?

1323
01:32:48,449 --> 01:32:49,615
We've been banging
our heads against a wall.

1324
01:32:49,699 --> 01:32:51,157
This man doesn't remember anything.

1325
01:32:52,115 --> 01:32:55,699
Yes, Emergency is over.

1326
01:32:56,449 --> 01:32:58,364
No-no-no.

1327
01:32:58,448 --> 01:33:01,239
Mr. Shashtri, we're talking about Stree.

1328
01:33:01,406 --> 01:33:03,073
-Stree.
-Like "Stree come back tomorrow".

1329
01:33:03,156 --> 01:33:04,198
Stree.

1330
01:33:04,698 --> 01:33:06,156
What is a woman?

1331
01:33:08,739 --> 01:33:11,864
She has no stature compared to men.

1332
01:33:11,948 --> 01:33:13,073
What?

1333
01:33:13,156 --> 01:33:15,781
She should always stay within her limits.

1334
01:33:16,322 --> 01:33:18,530
Never step out of the house.

1335
01:33:19,822 --> 01:33:24,072
Her job is to keep her husband happy,
and bear children.

1336
01:33:24,155 --> 01:33:28,780
And if she crosses her limit,
then burn her alive at the cross.

1337
01:33:31,072 --> 01:33:33,113
-He has no solution.
-Such vile thoughts.

1338
01:33:33,197 --> 01:33:34,280
We just wasted our time with him.

1339
01:33:34,405 --> 01:33:37,237
What kind of a writer is he?
Is this what he writes?

1340
01:33:37,654 --> 01:33:39,779
What about Janna now?
He's too strong to control.

1341
01:33:39,862 --> 01:33:41,487
-Let's think.
-He's got such a filthy mind.

1342
01:33:42,737 --> 01:33:43,737
It's not me.

1343
01:33:45,529 --> 01:33:49,904
The people of this city
have a filthy mind.

1344
01:33:51,404 --> 01:33:54,446
They used that Stree
as long as they wanted.

1345
01:33:54,903 --> 01:33:56,070
And then they got rid of her.

1346
01:33:57,361 --> 01:34:03,486
And that man who gave her respect,
they took him away as well.

1347
01:34:04,611 --> 01:34:05,778
They will all die.

1348
01:34:06,653 --> 01:34:07,986
Everyone.

1349
01:34:10,403 --> 01:34:15,569
As long as there's even one male
in this city, she won't rest.

1350
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:22,277
Just one. One man can douse this fire.

1351
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:24,944
-Who is he?
-How does he look?

1352
01:34:26,527 --> 01:34:30,444
Wheatish color, long nose.
And treats himself like a king.

1353
01:34:31,235 --> 01:34:33,318
Born in the arms of the oak tree.

1354
01:34:33,401 --> 01:34:35,609
The prince of his family.

1355
01:34:35,818 --> 01:34:39,401
Love reflects in his eyes.
A true artist.

1356
01:34:39,901 --> 01:34:42,734
He's the true protector of this city.

1357
01:34:44,359 --> 01:34:47,443
A prostitute's son who's a bachelor.

1358
01:34:47,526 --> 01:34:49,526
Courtesan's son who's a bachelor.

1359
01:34:49,609 --> 01:34:52,942
A courtesan's son who's a bachelor.

1360
01:34:53,567 --> 01:34:55,108
-Let's find that guy.
-Come let's go

1361
01:34:55,275 --> 01:34:58,108
<i>Wheatish color, long nose.</i>
<i>And treats himself like a king.</i>

1362
01:34:58,692 --> 01:35:03,525
Born in the arms of the oak tree.
The prince of his family.

1363
01:35:04,983 --> 01:35:08,442
Vicky. Weren't you born
at your grandma's house?

1364
01:35:10,025 --> 01:35:12,982
And there was an oak tree
behind her house.

1365
01:35:13,649 --> 01:35:15,649
-Yes.
-So?

1366
01:35:15,732 --> 01:35:17,357
And you're the only son.

1367
01:35:18,232 --> 01:35:20,899
-A Prince.
-Very good.

1368
01:35:20,982 --> 01:35:25,191
Wheatish color, long nose.
And treats himself like a king.

1369
01:35:25,274 --> 01:35:28,566
-He has wheatish color.
-And a long nose.

1370
01:35:29,566 --> 01:35:34,148
And, you always think of yourself
as a king.

1371
01:35:34,898 --> 01:35:36,940
Love reflects in his eyes.

1372
01:35:37,523 --> 01:35:38,898
And a true artist.

1373
01:35:38,981 --> 01:35:40,481
There's love in your eyes.

1374
01:35:41,106 --> 01:35:43,190
And Stree saw that,
which is why she didn't abduct him.

1375
01:35:43,773 --> 01:35:44,856
There's love in my eyes?

1376
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:48,148
-Stree can see it, not her.
-And you're an artist as well.

1377
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:50,980
Aren't you getting carried away now?

1378
01:35:51,230 --> 01:35:52,564
What artist?

1379
01:35:52,897 --> 01:35:58,189
Vicky is the best ladies tailor
in the neighboring three districts.

1380
01:35:58,355 --> 01:36:00,814
-Exactly.
-This is a good coincidence.

1381
01:36:01,105 --> 01:36:03,189
But we must find someone
who has all five qualities.

1382
01:36:03,272 --> 01:36:05,355
And what about the fifth quality?
courtesan's son?

1383
01:36:05,439 --> 01:36:06,772
How will find him?

1384
01:36:07,689 --> 01:36:10,438
Courtesan means that right? That...

1385
01:36:21,688 --> 01:36:23,354
No one told him.

1386
01:36:23,563 --> 01:36:24,479
Nobody.

1387
01:36:25,063 --> 01:36:28,479
Everyone knows, but you don't know?

1388
01:36:29,063 --> 01:36:29,895
What?

1389
01:36:32,478 --> 01:36:33,562
-What?
-Look...

1390
01:36:36,187 --> 01:36:38,853
There's nothing to feel bad about.

1391
01:36:39,437 --> 01:36:43,978
Some mothers are school teachers,
some are government officers.

1392
01:36:44,687 --> 01:36:46,645
Some make pickles.

1393
01:36:47,687 --> 01:36:50,769
-Your mother was that...
-What?

1394
01:36:50,852 --> 01:36:51,811
That.

1395
01:36:53,644 --> 01:36:54,811
What?

1396
01:36:55,686 --> 01:36:56,644
Courtesan!

1397
01:36:59,311 --> 01:37:01,394
I will kill you right now.

1398
01:37:04,894 --> 01:37:07,352
I thought you never meant
it when you called me a bastard.

1399
01:37:07,810 --> 01:37:08,768
You...

1400
01:37:08,851 --> 01:37:10,226
This is absurd.

1401
01:37:12,518 --> 01:37:13,893
Do you have any sense?

1402
01:37:16,893 --> 01:37:18,726
Vicky. it's true.

1403
01:37:20,476 --> 01:37:22,935
Janna, I will break your head.

1404
01:37:26,518 --> 01:37:27,975
Vicky. Don't look at me.

1405
01:37:28,475 --> 01:37:30,350
Should I believe what he says?

1406
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,434
My mother was not a courtesan.

1407
01:37:35,309 --> 01:37:36,517
-Listen!
-No.

1408
01:37:37,017 --> 01:37:38,767
Vicky!

1409
01:37:45,559 --> 01:37:47,349
We've found the protector of the city.

1410
01:37:49,724 --> 01:37:51,224
He will deal with Stree.

1411
01:37:51,808 --> 01:37:54,641
-You mean Stree.
-Yes. Stree.

1412
01:38:12,223 --> 01:38:13,140
One more.

1413
01:38:20,473 --> 01:38:23,890
Brother Vicky, mom's asking
when will you return her blouse.

1414
01:38:28,306 --> 01:38:29,264
Dad.

1415
01:38:33,097 --> 01:38:34,972
What were you lecturing me about energy?

1416
01:38:38,431 --> 01:38:40,389
You've done a lot of friendship
when you were young, right?

1417
01:38:42,806 --> 01:38:44,471
Tell me something.

1418
01:38:45,471 --> 01:38:48,763
Did you do friendship with mom,
or marry her?

1419
01:38:56,263 --> 01:38:57,721
Blouse petticoat.

1420
01:39:04,262 --> 01:39:05,512
Who was she?

1421
01:39:06,804 --> 01:39:08,304
Why didn't you tell me?

1422
01:39:09,929 --> 01:39:12,137
You kept lying to me.

1423
01:39:23,844 --> 01:39:26,969
Daddy, I won't drink again. Swear on mom.

1424
01:39:27,761 --> 01:39:29,844
Swear on my dad, okay. Sorry.

1425
01:39:30,594 --> 01:39:31,636
Eat.

1426
01:39:36,344 --> 01:39:38,678
You could've told me this once.
That's all.

1427
01:39:42,094 --> 01:39:43,052
Eat.

1428
01:39:48,135 --> 01:39:50,968
<i>I talked to daddy.</i>
<i>And I thought how does it matter.</i>

1429
01:39:51,552 --> 01:39:52,677
She was my mother after all.

1430
01:39:53,843 --> 01:39:55,427
Maybe my father's someone else too.

1431
01:39:56,010 --> 01:39:57,593
But I know only one father.

1432
01:39:59,010 --> 01:40:02,051
The guy who stands at the
shop with the measuring tape.

1433
01:40:04,009 --> 01:40:08,259
And who thinks that my talent
is the greatest talent in the world.

1434
01:40:10,676 --> 01:40:11,801
But this city...

1435
01:40:12,801 --> 01:40:16,551
Everyone knew about me,
but they never made fun of me.

1436
01:40:17,884 --> 01:40:20,342
Otherwise, people like to gossip.

1437
01:40:21,883 --> 01:40:27,425
I always knew that I wasn't
meant for altering dresses.

1438
01:40:28,008 --> 01:40:31,633
But I didn't know that
I was born to save these people.

1439
01:40:32,300 --> 01:40:35,883
Lord chose a really unique mission for me.

1440
01:40:38,050 --> 01:40:39,841
"Born in the arms of the oak tree."

1441
01:40:40,382 --> 01:40:41,382
"The sole prince"

1442
01:40:45,299 --> 01:40:46,465
"The son of a courtesan who's a bachelor."

1443
01:40:47,715 --> 01:40:51,674
If I really am the son of a courtesan
then I will save this city.

1444
01:40:52,382 --> 01:40:54,215
Along with Janna, I will save everyone!

1445
01:40:56,132 --> 01:40:58,215
Bittu gather everyone.

1446
01:41:03,089 --> 01:41:04,673
What do we know about the Stree?

1447
01:41:04,756 --> 01:41:07,256
-She is scary.
-Ferocious.

1448
01:41:07,339 --> 01:41:10,048
No! She can read.

1449
01:41:10,131 --> 01:41:13,048
Have you ever heard about
a ghost or spirit who can read?

1450
01:41:13,631 --> 01:41:14,923
Right.

1451
01:41:15,006 --> 01:41:17,506
Meaning we're up against
an educated witch.

1452
01:41:17,589 --> 01:41:19,463
She is the new generation witch.

1453
01:41:19,547 --> 01:41:20,713
Point no. 2.

1454
01:41:20,797 --> 01:41:22,922
She comes every year during
the festival, to abduct men.

1455
01:41:23,255 --> 01:41:26,463
But if you write outside your
house "O Stree, come back tomorrow".

1456
01:41:26,672 --> 01:41:29,172
Then she reads it and thinks

1457
01:41:29,505 --> 01:41:34,547
"Oh okay. Rest today,
and I'll come back tomorrow".

1458
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:37,422
Meaning she listens.

1459
01:41:37,505 --> 01:41:38,962
That means she is obedient.

1460
01:41:39,046 --> 01:41:40,379
No. 3.

1461
01:41:40,837 --> 01:41:41,879
She is very stupid.

1462
01:41:41,962 --> 01:41:43,462
Next night she comes back again.

1463
01:41:43,629 --> 01:41:46,504
Reads the same line again and thinks

1464
01:41:46,879 --> 01:41:49,921
"Oh shit, now I'll have
to come back tomorrow again".

1465
01:41:50,004 --> 01:41:51,087
"This is cheating."

1466
01:41:51,171 --> 01:41:52,962
And she goes back home.

1467
01:41:53,046 --> 01:41:55,796
Poor thing doesn't understand
that these people are s...

1468
01:41:57,545 --> 01:41:58,420
...fooling her.

1469
01:41:59,003 --> 01:42:00,961
-She has a low IQ level.
-Exactly.

1470
01:42:01,045 --> 01:42:03,878
And we're much smarter than her.

1471
01:42:04,086 --> 01:42:06,420
-Thank you.
-And, if we get serious

1472
01:42:07,045 --> 01:42:09,961
then we can easily
get rid of this witch forever.

1473
01:42:10,045 --> 01:42:13,378
-Then let's get serious.
-Correct. Let's get serious.

1474
01:42:15,628 --> 01:42:16,877
But what are we going to do?

1475
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:21,335
Wedding night.

1476
01:42:22,335 --> 01:42:23,294
Wedding night.

1477
01:42:23,710 --> 01:42:25,460
But brother Rudra,
aren't you too old for that?

1478
01:42:25,544 --> 01:42:27,460
Not me. No!

1479
01:42:27,544 --> 01:42:29,460
According to Mr. Shashtri's book

1480
01:42:29,544 --> 01:42:32,752
Stree wants her wedding
night which was left incomplete.

1481
01:42:32,835 --> 01:42:33,960
Yes. So?

1482
01:42:34,044 --> 01:42:35,794
And if you're the protector of this city

1483
01:42:35,877 --> 01:42:38,918
then you must fulfill her wish.

1484
01:42:39,501 --> 01:42:41,251
What are you saying?
Have you lost your mind?

1485
01:42:41,334 --> 01:42:42,834
-No.
-What are you saying?

1486
01:42:42,918 --> 01:42:45,418
My father never even let
me watch a wedding night on TV

1487
01:42:45,501 --> 01:42:46,709
how can I do it with a witch?

1488
01:42:46,834 --> 01:42:47,751
Yes.

1489
01:42:48,168 --> 01:42:50,293
I am the protector, shouldn't
I prepare for a battle or something.

1490
01:42:50,376 --> 01:42:52,918
The battle begins after the wedding night.

1491
01:42:53,668 --> 01:42:54,584
Brother Rudra...

1492
01:42:55,375 --> 01:42:58,750
You mean, me and that witch...

1493
01:42:59,333 --> 01:43:01,917
We just have to use it as bait.

1494
01:43:02,833 --> 01:43:04,958
We must lead her to you, that's all.

1495
01:43:05,875 --> 01:43:08,125
Remember? She saw love in your eyes.

1496
01:43:08,208 --> 01:43:09,292
-Yes.
-And then?

1497
01:43:09,375 --> 01:43:10,958
Then leave it to me.

1498
01:43:11,083 --> 01:43:13,125
She is very strong in her dueling.

1499
01:43:13,292 --> 01:43:16,457
But I know how to overpower
her when she is out of her house.

1500
01:43:17,749 --> 01:43:19,291
But where will we call her?

1501
01:43:21,249 --> 01:43:23,082
Right here, in Vicky's Palace.

1502
01:43:23,207 --> 01:43:24,082
Best place.

1503
01:44:18,288 --> 01:44:20,496
Hurry up.

1504
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:43,828
Stree is out hunting today.

1505
01:44:43,912 --> 01:44:46,412
Don't step out of the
house and lock the door.

1506
01:44:46,495 --> 01:44:48,078
-Okay.
-Come back soon.

1507
01:44:48,162 --> 01:44:49,828
I feel scared alone.
-I'll be back soon.

1508
01:44:49,912 --> 01:44:51,286
Keep the doors closed.

1509
01:45:05,661 --> 01:45:07,119
Vicky, you're looking really handsome.

1510
01:45:07,202 --> 01:45:08,619
-Now wear this cap.
-No, no.

1511
01:45:08,702 --> 01:45:09,994
-I said wear it.
-No, no, caps. You'll ruin my hair.

1512
01:45:10,077 --> 01:45:11,826
-But the groom has to wear...
-I don't want to...

1513
01:45:11,910 --> 01:45:12,826
Wear it.

1514
01:45:26,701 --> 01:45:28,701
Dad had such vivid
dreams about my wedding.

1515
01:45:29,243 --> 01:45:31,825
Who knew that I'll be
marrying a witch some day.

1516
01:45:31,909 --> 01:45:33,159
Don't worry.

1517
01:45:33,409 --> 01:45:35,242
You're getting a chance
to save the entire city.

1518
01:45:35,325 --> 01:45:36,534
Not everyone gets this opportunity.

1519
01:45:36,617 --> 01:45:38,992
-Don't be scared.
-Don't you want to save Janna?

1520
01:45:39,075 --> 01:45:40,700
Don't you want to bring him back again?

1521
01:45:41,159 --> 01:45:42,575
What is the plan? What do we do?

1522
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:47,450
Stree will definitely come here
after reading the message on the wall.

1523
01:45:49,449 --> 01:45:52,991
When she looks into your eyes,
don't look away.

1524
01:45:53,074 --> 01:45:55,033
Instead look into her eyes.

1525
01:45:55,449 --> 01:45:56,866
I know a spell.

1526
01:45:57,116 --> 01:45:58,866
That spell will render her powerless.

1527
01:45:59,449 --> 01:46:02,783
And then we must drive
this dagger through her heart.

1528
01:46:02,866 --> 01:46:05,158
Dagger? How can I...

1529
01:46:06,616 --> 01:46:08,990
We're waiting inside. Don't be scared.

1530
01:46:10,073 --> 01:46:11,907
-Let's go.
-Listen...

1531
01:46:12,490 --> 01:46:14,240
Will your spell work?

1532
01:46:14,323 --> 01:46:16,990
-90 percent
-What percent?

1533
01:46:18,157 --> 01:46:19,573
Maybe 99% percent.

1534
01:46:20,157 --> 01:46:22,532
Meaning there is a 1% chance I'll be dead.

1535
01:46:24,573 --> 01:46:26,490
-Daddy...
-Let's go.

1536
01:46:26,865 --> 01:46:27,989
Listen.

1537
01:46:29,739 --> 01:46:31,406
I am going.

1538
01:46:34,239 --> 01:46:36,072
Don't worry, okay.

1539
01:46:36,656 --> 01:46:37,739
Don't forget you are Vicky.

1540
01:46:37,864 --> 01:46:40,614
The guy who can spend
a night with a witch.

1541
01:46:40,697 --> 01:46:44,031
In case I don't come back,
don't come looking for me.

1542
01:46:44,656 --> 01:46:47,238
And... look after my dad.

1543
01:46:50,488 --> 01:46:51,696
THE LAST NIGHT

1544
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:54,113
O Stree come back tomorrow.

1545
01:46:55,321 --> 01:46:58,280
O Stree there are no men here.

1546
01:46:59,988 --> 01:47:02,113
O Stree come back tomorrow.

1547
01:47:03,071 --> 01:47:06,030
O Stree there are no men here.

1548
01:47:40,819 --> 01:47:45,235
O STREE COME HERE.

1549
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:05,276
O STREE COME HERE.

1550
01:48:15,901 --> 01:48:16,901
I think it's her.

1551
01:48:29,275 --> 01:48:33,858
O STREE COME HERE.

1552
01:48:42,858 --> 01:48:44,232
She isn't coming inside.

1553
01:48:44,315 --> 01:48:45,607
Is she suspicious?

1554
01:48:45,690 --> 01:48:49,232
Stree is smarter than you thought.

1555
01:48:52,024 --> 01:48:53,649
-Janna.
-Janna.

1556
01:48:53,732 --> 01:48:56,024
Janna. Listen to me. Janna.

1557
01:49:00,815 --> 01:49:03,023
-Janna.
-Leave him.

1558
01:49:07,939 --> 01:49:09,106
Janna.

1559
01:49:10,898 --> 01:49:13,773
Vicky.

1560
01:49:25,605 --> 01:49:26,772
Janna.

1561
01:49:32,105 --> 01:49:34,688
-Janna!
-Janna.

1562
01:49:46,354 --> 01:49:47,562
Vicky is missing.

1563
01:49:48,937 --> 01:49:49,854
Vicky.

1564
01:49:56,896 --> 01:49:57,896
Vicky.

1565
01:50:00,353 --> 01:50:01,353
Vicky.

1566
01:50:03,186 --> 01:50:04,936
-Vicky isn't here.
-Isn't he?

1567
01:50:05,978 --> 01:50:07,395
Where could he be?

1568
01:50:08,353 --> 01:50:11,061
Meaning Stree was here
and she took her lover.

1569
01:50:11,145 --> 01:50:12,103
Don't say that.

1570
01:50:12,186 --> 01:50:15,561
All our arrangements, the wedding
night preparations, didn't work.

1571
01:50:16,853 --> 01:50:20,185
Where did your sister take him?

1572
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:23,560
-Vicky just sent a message, on WhatsApp.
-What?

1573
01:50:23,852 --> 01:50:25,269
He just shared his location.

1574
01:50:30,269 --> 01:50:31,519
Stree.

1575
01:50:34,810 --> 01:50:37,185
Where are you, Stree?

1576
01:50:52,518 --> 01:50:54,351
Stree, I...

1577
01:51:17,682 --> 01:51:20,849
Okay. Fine. I am sitting here.

1578
01:51:20,932 --> 01:51:22,349
I'm not going anywhere.

1579
01:51:23,182 --> 01:51:24,599
I am sitting right here.

1580
01:51:36,931 --> 01:51:39,681
This is the same place.
I guess she took him to the bedroom.

1581
01:51:40,265 --> 01:51:42,265
And she won't let him go until
she spends her wedding night.

1582
01:51:51,473 --> 01:51:52,640
Oh, God.

1583
01:51:59,389 --> 01:52:02,097
Stree... I am ready.

1584
01:52:03,847 --> 01:52:07,305
Come to this bed.
We'll spend our wedding night.

1585
01:52:11,639 --> 01:52:14,180
I am getting ready.

1586
01:52:19,388 --> 01:52:20,638
I'm taking it off.

1587
01:52:27,304 --> 01:52:28,846
Do I have to take my pants off too?

1588
01:52:29,638 --> 01:52:31,804
Fine, I'll take it off.

1589
01:52:36,095 --> 01:52:39,970
I am ready now. Come on.

1590
01:52:45,220 --> 01:52:46,387
Sorry. Sorry...

1591
01:52:46,470 --> 01:52:49,970
Sorry, Stree. I understand
that you've no interest in all this.

1592
01:52:50,053 --> 01:52:52,095
I respect you.

1593
01:52:53,345 --> 01:52:55,302
I'll even wear my clothes back.

1594
01:52:55,386 --> 01:52:57,302
See, I am wearing them back.

1595
01:52:57,469 --> 01:53:00,386
Don't kill me, Stree.
I misunderstood you.

1596
01:53:48,092 --> 01:53:48,925
Vicky!

1597
01:53:54,216 --> 01:53:55,383
Janna.

1598
01:53:57,674 --> 01:54:00,091
What happened? Is she dead?

1599
01:54:00,424 --> 01:54:02,424
She is just powerless at the moment.

1600
01:54:02,508 --> 01:54:05,133
But we must finish her
before she gets her powers back.

1601
01:54:06,341 --> 01:54:07,216
Where are your clothes?

1602
01:54:07,299 --> 01:54:09,424
Sorry, I...

1603
01:54:09,591 --> 01:54:12,840
I thought in order to save the city,
I will have to sleep with her.

1604
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:15,965
But you know what,
I don't think she wants any of it.

1605
01:54:18,090 --> 01:54:18,923
Here you go.

1606
01:54:19,423 --> 01:54:21,215
You must pierce her
heart with this dagger.

1607
01:54:21,298 --> 01:54:22,548
And cut off her braid.

1608
01:54:22,632 --> 01:54:25,507
Braid? How did her braid get in all this?

1609
01:54:25,673 --> 01:54:27,215
And, how will I do this?

1610
01:54:27,298 --> 01:54:28,173
You do it, please.

1611
01:54:28,257 --> 01:54:31,506
I would've done it if I could.
You will have to do it.

1612
01:54:31,589 --> 01:54:33,006
You're the protector of the city. Come on.

1613
01:54:33,089 --> 01:54:36,881
Yes, I know I am the protector,
but I am a tailor, not a killer.

1614
01:54:36,964 --> 01:54:39,131
-Kill her before she wakes up again.
-Take it. Come on.

1615
01:54:39,214 --> 01:54:40,172
Yes.

1616
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:18,295
Do we have to kill her?

1617
01:55:18,754 --> 01:55:20,462
Poor thing is lying down so comfortably.

1618
01:55:20,545 --> 01:55:22,337
This is exactly how the
people of this city treated her.

1619
01:55:22,462 --> 01:55:23,587
And we're doing the same.

1620
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:25,212
So what's the difference
between us and them?

1621
01:55:25,295 --> 01:55:26,670
She must be having a reason.

1622
01:55:26,754 --> 01:55:29,336
She is trying to find her true love.

1623
01:55:30,211 --> 01:55:31,628
Let her go, please.

1624
01:55:32,461 --> 01:55:35,669
There must be another way.
Like lizard's tail, cockroach soup.

1625
01:55:40,503 --> 01:55:41,919
Then cut off her braid.

1626
01:55:42,378 --> 01:55:44,836
This will make her powerless.
And, she won't die either.

1627
01:55:45,503 --> 01:55:46,336
Okay.

1628
01:55:53,460 --> 01:55:55,085
No, no, no.

1629
01:55:56,168 --> 01:55:57,210
Find the dagger.

1630
01:55:57,835 --> 01:55:58,835
Vicky, look into her eyes.

1631
01:56:00,043 --> 01:56:01,210
Vicky, open your eyes.

1632
01:56:01,293 --> 01:56:03,752
She won't do anything
if you look in her eyes.

1633
01:56:04,252 --> 01:56:05,335
It's not working.

1634
01:56:05,418 --> 01:56:08,167
She is hungry for love.
Look into her eyes with love.

1635
01:56:08,876 --> 01:56:09,792
Love.

1636
01:56:11,334 --> 01:56:12,251
Love.

1637
01:56:18,667 --> 01:56:19,626
Love...

1638
01:56:20,167 --> 01:56:21,501
More love, Vicky.

1639
01:56:21,584 --> 01:56:24,292
I am shitting in my pants,
and you want more feelings.

1640
01:56:26,042 --> 01:56:26,916
Quiet!

1641
01:56:28,666 --> 01:56:29,750
Quiet!

1642
01:56:30,625 --> 01:56:32,166
What is all this yelling for?

1643
01:56:32,250 --> 01:56:34,125
This is no way to take revenge.

1644
01:56:35,833 --> 01:56:37,916
I am the protector of the city,
so show some respect.

1645
01:56:38,875 --> 01:56:40,000
Always screaming.

1646
01:56:40,583 --> 01:56:43,458
Vicky. Here.

1647
01:57:26,622 --> 01:57:28,538
Vicky. Throw the braid away.

1648
01:57:32,538 --> 01:57:33,788
Are you okay?

1649
01:57:35,913 --> 01:57:37,080
Yes.

1650
01:57:37,163 --> 01:57:38,288
Dagger.

1651
01:57:42,497 --> 01:57:43,455
Sit up.

1652
01:57:43,538 --> 01:57:44,787
Get up.

1653
01:57:46,246 --> 01:57:47,371
Sit up straight.

1654
01:57:51,204 --> 01:57:53,954
-I think she's gone. Isn't it?
-Yes.

1655
01:57:54,787 --> 01:57:57,329
She kept attacking her.

1656
01:57:58,037 --> 01:57:59,954
But I snuck up behind
her and cut off her braid.

1657
01:58:00,037 --> 01:58:02,079
Then she disappeared.
And didn't come back.

1658
01:58:02,162 --> 01:58:03,703
But is the Stree dead or not?

1659
01:58:05,078 --> 01:58:06,245
Tell me.

1660
01:58:07,703 --> 01:58:09,620
Meaning she will come
back again next year.

1661
01:58:10,078 --> 01:58:14,120
-She's only hungry for one thing.
-No. it's two.

1662
01:58:14,203 --> 01:58:15,453
What?

1663
01:58:16,036 --> 01:58:19,370
Love and respect,
which this city never gave her.

1664
01:58:20,120 --> 01:58:21,703
And that was this city's biggest mistake.

1665
01:58:22,410 --> 01:58:24,035
And we were going to
repeat the same mistake.

1666
01:58:25,827 --> 01:58:29,994
And if this city gives her
the respect, which she never received.

1667
01:58:30,910 --> 01:58:32,494
Then she might leave the city.

1668
01:59:08,575 --> 01:59:14,700
<i>These brave men together</i>
<i>have protected the city</i>

1669
01:59:14,992 --> 01:59:18,117
<i>and we will never</i>
<i>forget their contribution.</i>

1670
01:59:18,575 --> 01:59:24,241
<i>All the youngsters who went missing</i>
<i>in the last two days have returned.</i>

1671
01:59:24,324 --> 01:59:25,949
<i>Are you listening?</i>

1672
01:59:38,991 --> 01:59:40,490
-There she is.
-Stop. Stop.

1673
01:59:40,865 --> 01:59:42,198
Sister-in-law.

1674
01:59:42,990 --> 01:59:44,906
The flower. The flower.

1675
01:59:44,990 --> 01:59:46,323
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

1676
01:59:47,198 --> 01:59:50,198
Everyone was looking for you.

1677
01:59:53,365 --> 01:59:55,365
You wore the dress.

1678
01:59:56,031 --> 01:59:57,198
Does it fit well?

1679
01:59:57,948 --> 01:59:59,572
You took my measurements so well.

1680
02:00:01,822 --> 02:00:03,405
This is for you.

1681
02:00:04,030 --> 02:00:06,822
I could've never fought
against the Stree without you.

1682
02:00:08,322 --> 02:00:09,364
Thank you.

1683
02:00:11,739 --> 02:00:13,197
You are very nice, Vicky.

1684
02:00:13,947 --> 02:00:16,780
I wish we had met you before, then
we could have a friendship.

1685
02:00:17,989 --> 02:00:19,571
Can we have a friendship?

1686
02:00:22,238 --> 02:00:25,779
You mean friends, or...

1687
02:00:26,613 --> 02:00:28,904
Yes. Isn't that what friendship means?

1688
02:00:30,279 --> 02:00:31,154
No.

1689
02:00:31,238 --> 02:00:33,488
There's another meaning
for friendship in our town.

1690
02:00:45,112 --> 02:00:48,112
What if I want to talk to you,
or meet you?

1691
02:00:48,195 --> 02:00:49,445
I don't even have your number.

1692
02:00:51,028 --> 02:00:52,278
Just think of me.

1693
02:00:54,612 --> 02:00:56,487
Do you have to go?

1694
02:00:56,902 --> 02:00:58,444
Please wait for a few more days.

1695
02:00:59,361 --> 02:01:00,402
Please.

1696
02:01:01,819 --> 02:01:02,944
Vicky, please!

1697
02:01:17,776 --> 02:01:20,485
Name?
You didn't tell me your name...

1698
02:01:21,068 --> 02:01:24,235
This is my first time where he's smitten
by love but doesn't know her name.

1699
02:01:24,818 --> 02:01:26,068
Maybe this is true love.

1700
02:01:26,151 --> 02:01:27,443
Vicky, please.

1701
02:01:32,110 --> 02:01:34,651
<i>For the past three years,</i>
<i>I had only one motive.</i>

1702
02:01:35,193 --> 02:01:36,442
<i>Defeating Stree.</i>

1703
02:01:37,067 --> 02:01:41,400
<i>I tried everything I knew,</i>
<i>but it wasn't enough.</i>

1704
02:01:42,109 --> 02:01:45,317
<i>There's always a method</i>
<i>to control any power.</i>

1705
02:01:46,025 --> 02:01:50,734
<i>Just cut off her braid.</i>
<i>She will become powerless, and won't die.</i>

1706
02:02:07,983 --> 02:02:10,816
<i>I would've done it long ago if I could.</i>

1707
02:02:10,899 --> 02:02:13,441
<i>You're the protector of the city,</i>
<i>you have to do it.</i>

1708
02:02:32,357 --> 02:02:34,606
ONE YEAR LATER.

1709
02:03:10,355 --> 02:03:12,562
O STREE PROTECT US.

1710
02:04:00,060 --> 02:04:01,018
Music.

1711
02:04:16,517 --> 02:04:18,309
<i>Everyone's talking about you</i>

1712
02:04:18,392 --> 02:04:20,184
<i>They all know that you're an angel</i>

1713
02:04:20,267 --> 02:04:21,226
<i>You're hard to get</i>

1714
02:04:21,309 --> 02:04:24,017
<i>Your poor beloved's been waiting</i>

1715
02:04:24,101 --> 02:04:25,934
<i>All I know is there's a cave</i>

1716
02:04:26,017 --> 02:04:27,851
<i>but the cave's hard to open</i>

1717
02:04:27,934 --> 02:04:29,725
<i>No matter what I do,</i>
<i>but you're never impressed</i>

1718
02:04:29,850 --> 02:04:31,850
<i>Your beloved's been wandering around</i>

1719
02:04:32,016 --> 02:04:33,850
<i>I've played all the shots</i>

1720
02:04:33,933 --> 02:04:35,641
<i>And have been in a tight spot</i>

1721
02:04:35,725 --> 02:04:39,391
<i>But haven't yet hit the jackpot</i>

1722
02:04:39,683 --> 02:04:41,516
<i>But you'll get it, You'll get it</i>

1723
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:43,433
<i>You'll get it</i>

1724
02:04:43,516 --> 02:04:44,975
<i>I'll get it too</i>

1725
02:04:45,058 --> 02:04:46,891
<i>The miracle's going to happen</i>

1726
02:04:46,975 --> 02:04:49,140
<i>You'll get it, You'll get it</i>

1727
02:04:49,224 --> 02:04:50,974
<i>You'll get it</i>

1728
02:04:51,057 --> 02:04:52,599
<i>Someday we'll all get it</i>

1729
02:04:52,682 --> 02:04:54,557
Be patient my friend

1730
02:05:17,389 --> 02:05:19,264
<i>I warned you before</i>
<i>I warned you before</i>

1731
02:05:19,348 --> 02:05:21,181
<i>She will come draped in a sari</i>
<i>Draped in a sari</i>

1732
02:05:21,264 --> 02:05:23,014
<i>And come for your</i>

1733
02:05:23,098 --> 02:05:24,973
<i>Heart, Your heart</i>

1734
02:05:25,056 --> 02:05:26,889
<i>She comes alone</i>

1735
02:05:26,972 --> 02:05:28,805
<i>When she comes along</i>

1736
02:05:28,888 --> 02:05:32,847
<i>Just meet me</i>

1737
02:05:32,972 --> 02:05:34,930
<i>Meet me in my dreams</i>

1738
02:05:35,013 --> 02:05:36,847
<i>Meet me completely decked up</i>

1739
02:05:36,930 --> 02:05:39,638
<i>Don't you worry my dear</i>

1740
02:05:39,763 --> 02:05:40,597
<i>Because</i>

1741
02:05:40,680 --> 02:05:42,430
<i>You'll get it, You'll get it</i>

1742
02:05:42,513 --> 02:05:43,972
<i>You'll get it</i>

1743

<i>I'll get it too</i>

1744

<i>The miracle's going to happen</i>

1745

<i>You'll get it, You'll get it</i>

1746
02:05:49,846 --> 02:05:51,929
<i>You'll get it</i>

1747

<i>Someday we'll all get it</i>

1748
02:05:53,637 --> 02:05:55,596
<i>Be patient my friend</i>
