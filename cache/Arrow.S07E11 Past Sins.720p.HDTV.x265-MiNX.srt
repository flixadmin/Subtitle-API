1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,140
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,143 --> 00:00:02,276
The Dante painting.

3
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:03,672
It's being used as some sort of

4
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:05,932
highly advanced identification protocol

5
00:00:05,935 --> 00:00:07,882
within terrorist circles.

6
00:00:07,885 --> 00:00:09,502
I'm here to offer you a deal.

7
00:00:09,505 --> 00:00:11,460
You give us Dante, you go free.

8
00:00:11,463 --> 00:00:14,835
No one said anything about
sticking a bomb in my head.

9
00:00:14,838 --> 00:00:15,924
What do you see?

10
00:00:15,926 --> 00:00:17,273
I'm with my father at sea.

11
00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:18,867
His bodyguard Ha-Hackett,

12
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,181
my dad shot him.

13
00:00:20,184 --> 00:00:21,777
Your father was a murderer.

14
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,555
Mr. Queen is officially working

15
00:00:23,558 --> 00:00:25,257
for the SCPD.

16
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:26,616
We need to analyze this DNA.

17
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:27,851
It belongs to the new Green Arrow.

18
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:29,240
The vigilante is your sister.

19
00:00:29,242 --> 00:00:31,064
The DNA match is on your father's side.

20
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:32,622
He had a second family.

21
00:00:32,624 --> 00:00:35,258
How... how could he abandon them?

22
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:36,971
Hello, Emiko.

23
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:38,933
We're talking tonight

24
00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:42,297
with two former vigilantes
turned public servants...

25
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,343
Oliver Queen and Laurel Lance.

26
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,929
Ms. Lance, you've had
an impressive start

27
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:49,285
as district attorney.

28
00:00:49,288 --> 00:00:52,038
Tell me what these last few
months have meant to you.

29
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:54,478
Well, Rich, when I first got this job,

30
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:56,387
I didn't think I could do it,

31
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,317
considering... the
trauma that I had endured.

32
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:04,004
But I wanted to honor
my father's legacy.

33
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:05,080
And I think you have.

34
00:01:05,082 --> 00:01:06,674
Well, I know she has.

35
00:01:06,676 --> 00:01:10,035
Mr. Queen, you've talked
before about how much

36
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:13,124
your own father's
sacrifice inspired you.

37
00:01:13,127 --> 00:01:14,330
Yes.

38
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:16,725
Do you believe that's his legacy?

39
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:24,191
Hello, Emiko.

40
00:01:24,193 --> 00:01:26,193
I know everything.

41
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:28,603
You've wasted your time coming here.

42
00:01:28,605 --> 00:01:32,747
What our father did
to you, to your mother

43
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,201
was unforgivable.

44
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:38,229
I need to try and make things right.

45
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:42,284
My father did sacrifice
himself for me, and...

46
00:01:42,286 --> 00:01:44,460
I'll always be grateful.

47
00:01:44,463 --> 00:01:47,859
Still, that experience on the raft...

48
00:01:47,862 --> 00:01:49,532
Just the two of you...

49
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:52,869
Watching your father commit
suicide right before your eyes,

50
00:01:52,871 --> 00:01:55,639
that must have been harrowing.

51
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:57,768
What a true hero your father was.

52
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:03,230
I can prove to you that
I'm nothing like him.

53
00:02:03,232 --> 00:02:05,381
You're a Queen.

54
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:07,476
All you know how to do is
leverage your own privilege

55
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:08,495
to help yourself.

56
00:02:08,498 --> 00:02:11,095
What happened to you was wrong.

57
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,223
You should have been

58
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:14,766
a part of our lives.

59
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:17,227
You should be a part of my life now.

60
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:20,396
Why do you think I want
anything to do with the Queens?

61
00:02:20,398 --> 00:02:23,352
'Cause your family destroys
everything it touches.

62
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:25,121
I just want a chance.

63
00:02:27,072 --> 00:02:29,048
Just give me a chance.

64
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,909
Emiko...

65
00:02:33,912 --> 00:02:35,262
You're my sister.

66
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:39,266
I have no family.

67
00:02:45,142 --> 00:02:48,018
My goal has always
been to serve this city.

68
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:51,970
I understand that
there are people who...

69
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:54,973
They disagreed with my methods before.

70
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:58,118
So I would like to assure
the people of Star City

71
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,146
I will no longer be
hiding in the shadows,

72
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:05,003
and I promise to always
be on the side of the law.

73
00:03:05,006 --> 00:03:07,858
I believe that trust can be built

74
00:03:07,861 --> 00:03:10,236
through transparency.

75
00:03:12,534 --> 00:03:14,444
And I'm gonna prove it.

76
00:03:14,464 --> 00:03:19,588

77
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:21,215
Thank you.

78
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:22,796
You were amazing.

79
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,647
You were genuine and
heartfelt and amazing,

80
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,313
and for a second there, I almost
believed that you liked Laurel.

81
00:03:27,316 --> 00:03:29,117
I almost do.

82
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,329
If Dinah's goal is to convince the city

83
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:32,561
to accept you as SCPD,

84
00:03:32,563 --> 00:03:34,122
I would say mission accomplished.

85
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,564
We'll see.

86
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:37,927
Emiko will come around, too.

87
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,643
Well, she has every right to be angry.

88
00:03:40,645 --> 00:03:44,189
My father abandoned her. I just...

89
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,043
I need her to see

90
00:03:46,046 --> 00:03:48,746
that he and I are not the same person.

91
00:03:48,749 --> 00:03:51,410
Well, she will, because
you're not the same person.

92
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:54,490
Look, that was an excellent first step.

93
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:56,418
If you can prove yourself to the city,

94
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,792
you can convince your
sister to give you a chance.

95
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:01,014
I hope you're right.

96
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,809
You're here because
A.R.G.U.S. is assembling

97
00:04:07,812 --> 00:04:10,018
a unique task force,

98
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:13,360
and you've been identified
as a potential candidate.

99
00:04:13,362 --> 00:04:16,221
For a bomb in my head? No, thanks.

100
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:17,426
I heard what happened

101
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:19,348
to the members of your last squad.

102
00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:20,850
We are offering you a chance

103
00:04:20,852 --> 00:04:22,234
to lessen your prison sentence

104
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:24,686
by repaying your debt to society.

105
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:26,707
And what about your debt to society?

106
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:28,096
Arrow was a criminal,

107
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:29,858
and you fought alongside him.

108
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:33,071
You've demonstrated a
severe negative response

109
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,060
to male authority figures.

110
00:04:35,063 --> 00:04:39,011
Yeah. Well, when you grow
up with a father like mine...

111
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:41,555
Daddy issues.

112
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:46,134
You're only alive right
now because of your friends.

113
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:49,638
Welcome back to A.R.G.U.S., Ms. Cutter.

114
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,025
"Ms. Cutter." So formal.

115
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:54,503
Tell us about a challenge

116
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:56,311
that you've worked to overcome.

117
00:04:56,313 --> 00:05:01,909
Well, the love of my life rejected me...

118
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:03,768
For a blonde.

119
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,746
Man, what the hell is going on?

120
00:05:05,748 --> 00:05:09,232
China White, Spawn of
Slade, and now Cupid?

121
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:11,448
It's like the ghost of
villains past in here.

122
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:12,735
Have we met?

123
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:17,115
Agent Holt, a word.

124
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,676
You're not my type.

125
00:05:22,932 --> 00:05:24,846
The Ghost Initiative is just

126
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:26,400
a cooler-sounding name for suicide s...

127
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:29,601
Look, I know you're angry,
but this is about Dante.

128
00:05:29,604 --> 00:05:30,978
So I was right.

129
00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:32,698
There's a hidden
meaning in that painting.

130
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:34,376
It turns out Dante's a person...

131
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:35,633
A very dangerous one.

132
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,523
Intel from our overseas office indicates

133
00:05:37,526 --> 00:05:38,691
that he is the financier

134
00:05:38,694 --> 00:05:41,147
behind dozens of terrorist
attacks all over the world.

135
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,931
Apparently, there's only a few people

136
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:44,600
who have direct contact with Dante.

137
00:05:44,602 --> 00:05:46,695
We tracked one back
to a compound in Egypt.

138
00:05:46,697 --> 00:05:49,459
We get a hold of this
guy, we catch Dante,

139
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:51,720
and the Ghost Initiative is
our best shot at doing that.

140
00:05:51,723 --> 00:05:53,446
How did you all find all this out?

141
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:55,461
Why was I left in the dark?

142
00:05:55,464 --> 00:05:57,464
The lead came from a source...

143
00:05:57,467 --> 00:05:59,884
Our first member in
the Ghost Initiative.

144
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:06,548
Have you all lost your mind?

145
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,016
Ricardo Diaz?!

146
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:10,120
The same Ricardo Diaz
we just put in prison,

147
00:06:10,123 --> 00:06:11,478
the guy who stabbed me,

148
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,794
who tried to kill all of
us about 17 times? This...

149
00:06:13,797 --> 00:06:15,714
Curtis, we know that it's not ideal.

150
00:06:15,717 --> 00:06:18,343
That is the definition
of an understatement.

151
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:19,969
Do Oliver and Felicity know?

152
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:22,489
No one knows, and it
has to stay that way.

153
00:06:22,492 --> 00:06:24,964
A.R.G.U.S. knows that we
restarted the Ghost Initiative,

154
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,741
but they don't know
that we're using them

155
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:28,118
to go after Dante.

156
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:29,969
And if they did, they
would kill the mission.

157
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:31,774
Remember Switzerland?

158
00:06:31,777 --> 00:06:34,845
Now that you're looped
in, we need your help.

159
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:37,136
I'm not putting any
bombs in anyone's heads.

160
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,369
I don't care how evil
that head might be.

161
00:06:39,372 --> 00:06:40,445
You don't have to.

162
00:06:40,448 --> 00:06:42,115
We just need you to make sure

163
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:44,252
the bomb tech isn't rejected
by the subjects' bodies

164
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:45,470
after insertion.

165
00:06:45,473 --> 00:06:47,022
Yeah, 'cause that's so much better.

166
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:50,016
Curtis, this is how we catch Dante.

167
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:51,560
And it's not a request.

168
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:08,994
I hope you like Malbec.

169
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:10,752
If it's alcohol, I love it.

170
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:12,468
Good. Well, actually, I don't know

171
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:14,022
your Earth-Two situation.

172
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:15,358
Maybe you shouldn't be drinking?

173
00:07:15,361 --> 00:07:16,676
Oh, please.

174
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:19,070
I don't have a problem with alcohol,

175
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,789
maybe the first thing I've managed

176
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,382
to one-up your Laurel on.

177
00:07:22,384 --> 00:07:25,192
Well, then here you go.

178
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,103
So what's going on?

179
00:07:27,106 --> 00:07:28,737
What do you mean?

180
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,698
- You told me to meet you here.
- Mm-hmm.

181
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,251
Usually, there's a reason,

182
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,681
like a kidnapping

183
00:07:34,684 --> 00:07:37,667
or maybe you need help
torturing someone again.

184
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,140
I just wanted to celebrate with you

185
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:40,883
after your incredible interview.

186
00:07:40,885 --> 00:07:43,820
Oh. Okay.

187
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,890
Quentin would be really proud of you,

188
00:07:47,892 --> 00:07:49,678
the work you've done as a D.A.

189
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:53,062
and the person that you've become.

190
00:07:53,064 --> 00:07:55,273
Really.

191
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,042
Thank you.

192
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:02,163
I'll be right back, but pace yourself

193
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:04,227
because we are gonna
drink this whole bottle.

194
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,118
...Including a start

195
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,763
on Pro Bono cases at CNRI,

196
00:08:09,765 --> 00:08:11,703
the question as to
whether Laurel Lance was

197
00:08:11,706 --> 00:08:14,001
the right person to take over as D.A.

198
00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:16,751
was put to rest after
a recent poll indicates

199
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:18,741
she is the most popular D.A.

200
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:20,216
in the past 10 years.

201
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:21,908
The district attorney's position is

202
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:23,834
not an on-the-job training type.

203
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,241
It requires experience to lead, train...

204
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:27,972
Laurel Lance.

205
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:31,501
It is a must to know
criminal law inside and out.

206
00:08:31,504 --> 00:08:34,604
That's impossible.

207
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:37,532
Hello, Brett.

208
00:08:37,535 --> 00:08:39,262
Who the hell are you?

209
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:41,870
I discovered a new talent.

210
00:08:41,872 --> 00:08:44,493
I thought you should
be the first to hear it.

211
00:08:56,222 --> 00:09:00,624
We both know you're not as
perfect as you say you are.

212
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:05,505
You should be behind bars.

213
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:07,821
I think you've had enough, buddy.

214
00:09:11,515 --> 00:09:13,824
What just happened? Who's that guy?

215
00:09:13,827 --> 00:09:15,810
I guess not everyone's a fan of the D.A.

216
00:09:15,813 --> 00:09:17,246
Okay, but the wine, the wine.

217
00:09:18,952 --> 00:09:20,735
Oh, my producer loves the piece.

218
00:09:20,738 --> 00:09:23,361
Yeah. He thinks it's gonna be huge.

219
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,913
Yeah, I'm still here.

220
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:33,054
Hey. I'm gonna have to call you...

221
00:09:38,707 --> 00:09:40,426
Rich Kannon left the
studio just after 8:00

222
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:41,295
to meet his wife for dinner

223
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:42,506
but never made it to the restaurant.

224
00:09:42,508 --> 00:09:43,755
Never even made it to his car.

225
00:09:43,758 --> 00:09:45,336
They found it in a
parking lot this morning.

226
00:09:45,338 --> 00:09:46,319
Security cameras?

227
00:09:46,322 --> 00:09:47,789
Every single one of them shorted out

228
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:49,580
just a few minutes
before Kannon disappeared.

229
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,189
Oh. Overhead lights were blown.

230
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:52,791
Suggests a power surge.

231
00:09:52,794 --> 00:09:53,937
That means our kidnapper knows his way

232
00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:55,012
around an electrical grid.

233
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:56,463
That takes planning.

234
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:58,515
This wasn't just some random attack.

235
00:09:58,517 --> 00:10:00,634
Well, maybe someone saw my interview

236
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:02,803
and didn't like what they saw.

237
00:10:02,806 --> 00:10:04,685
This doesn't feel like a coincidence.

238
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:05,871
Well, probably not.

239
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:07,808
But until we know more,
we can't assume anything.

240
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,143
Captain, you need to see this.

241
00:10:10,145 --> 00:10:12,771
Oliver Queen is not a hero.

242
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:17,570
He's a fraud and a liar.

243
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:19,406
He does not deserve to represent

244
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:20,871
the people of Star City.

245
00:10:20,873 --> 00:10:24,541
And if he does not quit the SCPD,

246
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:27,988
measures will be taken,
people will suffer.

247
00:10:56,242 --> 00:10:58,268
How's the analysis coming?

248
00:10:58,271 --> 00:10:59,794
Almost finished with my algorithm.

249
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:01,865
And then after that, I should
be ready to start testing,

250
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:04,303
assuming they don't
trip-walk into the bathroom

251
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:06,417
and accidentally set off
the bombs in their neck.

252
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:07,909
I guess that saves me from asking

253
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:10,421
if you're still having
a problem with all this.

254
00:11:10,424 --> 00:11:13,147
Look, I know these are bad people,

255
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,875
but what we're doing is inhumane.

256
00:11:14,877 --> 00:11:16,686
Curtis, restoring the program is

257
00:11:16,688 --> 00:11:18,262
the only way we can get Dante

258
00:11:18,265 --> 00:11:19,676
without A.R.G.U.S. oversight.

259
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,432
And that makes it right?

260
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:23,394
How can you be okay with that?

261
00:11:23,397 --> 00:11:26,233
I'm not. I'm not.

262
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:28,218
We are fighting evil

263
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,533
that most people don't even know exists.

264
00:11:30,535 --> 00:11:32,225
And sometimes that means making

265
00:11:32,227 --> 00:11:35,112
very difficult decisions, Curtis.

266
00:11:35,114 --> 00:11:39,000
The bombs are just a
failsafe. That's all.

267
00:11:43,205 --> 00:11:45,605
There has to be a better way.

268
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,427
I wish there were.

269
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,163
District attorney Laurel Lance entering

270
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,258
Queen residence.

271
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:07,373
Phase one is online and operational.

272
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:08,834
What the hell was that?

273
00:12:08,837 --> 00:12:10,627
Just a little something
I've been working on.

274
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,934
Oh, good. That's why I'm here, actually.

275
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:16,404
I was hoping to utilize
some of your skills

276
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:17,629
to help me with something.

277
00:12:17,632 --> 00:12:19,374
- Ooh.
- Hypothetically...

278
00:12:19,377 --> 00:12:20,941
Okay, let me stop you right there

279
00:12:20,943 --> 00:12:22,943
because we both know that
"hypothetically" means

280
00:12:22,945 --> 00:12:25,078
that this is definitely happening.

281
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:27,408
I need to know if someone
from Earth-Two is here.

282
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:31,197
Okay. That's not where I
thought you were going with that.

283
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,711
Is it that guy from the bar?

284
00:12:32,713 --> 00:12:35,122
I knew you recognized him. Who is he?

285
00:12:35,124 --> 00:12:37,007
The more I know, the
more I can help you.

286
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:39,084
Do you remember when I helped you

287
00:12:39,086 --> 00:12:42,295
with that whole torturing
the assassin thing?

288
00:12:42,297 --> 00:12:43,776
No questions asked?

289
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:46,274
Vaguely. Okay, fine.

290
00:12:46,277 --> 00:12:48,135
I will see what Cisco can dig up,

291
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:50,097
but then we are done
playing hypothetical games.

292
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,415
Deal.

293
00:12:51,418 --> 00:12:52,856
His name's Brett Collins.

294
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:55,526
You know, one of these days,

295
00:12:55,528 --> 00:12:58,072
you are going to realize
that you can trust people.

296
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:08,155
- Hey.
- Yeah.

297
00:13:08,157 --> 00:13:10,692
You know, we knew not everyone was

298
00:13:10,695 --> 00:13:12,659
gonna be a fan of you working here.

299
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:14,286
I mean, you should see
my stack of hate mail,

300
00:13:14,288 --> 00:13:15,620
and that was without
everyone knowing about me.

301
00:13:15,622 --> 00:13:19,279
Mm-mm. This guy's an amateur.

302
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:21,544
The video quality, the execution...

303
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:22,682
He's new at this.

304
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:25,004
He also didn't do a very
good job covering his tracks.

305
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:26,874
The video was uploaded
from a coffee shop

306
00:13:26,877 --> 00:13:28,710
in the southeast quadrant of The Glades.

307
00:13:28,713 --> 00:13:30,234
Do we have satellite imagery there?

308
00:13:30,237 --> 00:13:32,027
I think so. Hold on.

309
00:13:36,476 --> 00:13:38,643
What are we looking for?

310
00:13:38,645 --> 00:13:40,663
We're looking for windows.

311
00:13:40,665 --> 00:13:42,480
If he didn't know to cover his tracks,

312
00:13:42,482 --> 00:13:45,025
he might not have
gone too far from home.

313
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:46,860
There.

314
00:13:46,862 --> 00:13:48,691
That's a match.

315
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,513
Let's go get him.

316
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:11,217
Kannon's been moved.

317
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,862
Nothing down here either.

318
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:23,520
I got a visual, southeast corner.

319
00:14:23,523 --> 00:14:26,399
Copy. Closing in from below.

320
00:14:28,621 --> 00:14:32,173
Oh, God. Please help me!

321
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:38,870
Come on, now.

322
00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:40,558
You don't want to do that.

323
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:45,197
Wrong. People without the last
name Queen are human beings, too.

324
00:14:50,736 --> 00:14:52,194
Oh. Oh, God.

325
00:14:57,058 --> 00:14:59,776
I got kannon. Anyone
have eyes on the target?

326
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:03,204
Lost him.

327
00:15:05,385 --> 00:15:07,577
We got the reporter.

328
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:09,519
The kidnapper got away.

329
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:12,321
That's not the only thing
that's bothering you.

330
00:15:12,324 --> 00:15:13,916
It was something that he said:

331
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:17,420
"People without the last name
Queen are human beings, too."

332
00:15:17,422 --> 00:15:18,890
Oh, and you disagree?

333
00:15:18,893 --> 00:15:21,107
I agree. The timing's funny.

334
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,002
What with your secret half-sister
mysteriously returning into your life,

335
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:25,046
it's strange.

336
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,240
It's not that it's
strange. It's familiar.

337
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:30,149
The psychiatric records from Slabside

338
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:32,393
that you leaked to the press.

339
00:15:32,395 --> 00:15:34,558
Can you pull up my
transcript with Dr. Parker?

340
00:15:34,561 --> 00:15:36,561
Not exactly sure what that
has to do with anything,

341
00:15:36,564 --> 00:15:38,339
but, yes, I can.

342
00:15:38,342 --> 00:15:39,826
Thank you.

343
00:15:44,616 --> 00:15:46,073
Here you go.

344
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:47,877
Can you scroll down
a little bit, please?

345
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,296
- Mm-hmm.
- There.

346
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:52,005
"What became of Hackett?

347
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:53,675
Your father shot him. Then what?

348
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:55,625
He doesn't matter in this story,

349
00:15:55,627 --> 00:15:57,300
just collateral damage?

350
00:15:57,303 --> 00:16:00,815
People without the last name
Queen are human beings, too."

351
00:16:00,818 --> 00:16:03,319
The files I sent to
the press were redacted.

352
00:16:03,322 --> 00:16:05,259
The ones you sent to the D.A. weren't.

353
00:16:05,261 --> 00:16:07,261
So the kidnapper hacked them, but why?

354
00:16:07,263 --> 00:16:09,239
Why these particular
sessions with Parker?

355
00:16:11,026 --> 00:16:14,143
Can you look up Hackett,
first name David?

356
00:16:14,145 --> 00:16:17,199
Hackett, David, died in 2007.

357
00:16:17,202 --> 00:16:20,470
Survived by his son Sam,
no other living relatives.

358
00:16:20,473 --> 00:16:22,047
I met Sam a few times growing up.

359
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,738
Yeah, he's got quite the rap sheet...

360
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:25,158
Assault, assault with intent,

361
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:27,423
a bunch of drunk and disorderlies.

362
00:16:27,426 --> 00:16:29,450
His father was lost at sea.

363
00:16:29,453 --> 00:16:31,285
Or so he thought

364
00:16:31,287 --> 00:16:33,863
until he read your sessions with Parker.

365
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:36,499
And he found out his father was murdered

366
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:38,384
by my father.

367
00:16:38,386 --> 00:16:40,670
Emiko was right.

368
00:16:40,672 --> 00:16:43,083
My family destroys
everything it touches.

369
00:16:45,986 --> 00:16:48,820
Crap.

370
00:16:48,822 --> 00:16:50,591
Hey, I have to go.

371
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:52,348
- Okay.
- And I'm sorry.

372
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,141
I love you.

373
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:55,619
I love you, too.

374
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:07,372
Lookie here. Mr. Terrific.

375
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:11,534
It's been a while, my friend.

376
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:13,579
You look a little nervous.

377
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:15,423
Is that because the last time we met

378
00:17:15,426 --> 00:17:18,373
I had my knife in your gut?

379
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:20,042
Wasn't personal.

380
00:17:20,044 --> 00:17:22,578
It's probably best not to
talk during the procedure.

381
00:17:25,382 --> 00:17:26,673
Hey.

382
00:17:26,676 --> 00:17:30,103
He looks a little nervous, doesn't he?

383
00:17:30,105 --> 00:17:32,898
I can smell it on him from here.

384
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:35,725
It's okay, sweetie. I'll protect you.

385
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:37,738
You know, it's really gonna be nice

386
00:17:37,741 --> 00:17:40,780
to finally have some peace and quiet.

387
00:17:42,734 --> 00:17:44,784
What the hell are you doing?

388
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:47,191
Making sure the bombs
inside of your neck work.

389
00:17:47,194 --> 00:17:49,196
But to do that, I need to turn them off,

390
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:51,864
which means that you have to take a nap.

391
00:18:00,894 --> 00:18:02,744
It's strange...

392
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:05,323
You thinking it's a good idea

393
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:07,106
to give me drugs.

394
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:10,534
No. No, no, no, no.

395
00:18:10,537 --> 00:18:11,703
This can't be right.

396
00:18:13,254 --> 00:18:14,537
No, no, no, no, no.

397
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,935
I thought you were some kind of genius.

398
00:18:19,937 --> 00:18:21,902
- Wake 'em up!
- Not a chance.

399
00:18:21,905 --> 00:18:24,087
I said, wake them up!

400
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,355
Okay, okay. It doesn't matter.

401
00:18:27,358 --> 00:18:28,973
Even once you get out that door,

402
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:30,404
A.R.G.U.S. guards are
gonna be all over you.

403
00:18:30,406 --> 00:18:32,009
You let me worry about that.

404
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:33,570
Move!

405
00:18:34,786 --> 00:18:38,454
Up. Hey. Get up.

406
00:18:38,456 --> 00:18:40,623
What the hell's going on?

407
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,626
Early release for good behavior.

408
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:45,997
What about the bombs in our necks?

409
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,993
Thanks to our friend here,

410
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,471
out of commission.

411
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:52,135
Move.

412
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,846
_

413
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:24,333
You're still a disgusting drunk.

414
00:19:24,335 --> 00:19:27,053
You haven't changed a bit.

415
00:19:27,055 --> 00:19:28,605
But you have.

416
00:19:29,982 --> 00:19:35,468
Look at you, pretending to be reformed,

417
00:19:35,471 --> 00:19:40,307
playing make-believe lawyer
in those fancy D.A. suits.

418
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:42,932
You're a wolf in sheep's clothing,

419
00:19:42,935 --> 00:19:47,273
a wolf that this city
needs to be rid of.

420
00:19:47,275 --> 00:19:51,911
- Uh! Hyah...
- Hyah! Hyah...

421
00:19:51,913 --> 00:19:53,863
You should have stayed on Earth-Two.

422
00:19:53,865 --> 00:19:55,427
What the hell is Earth-Two?

423
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,295
You know, threatening me...

424
00:19:58,505 --> 00:20:00,195
That was a bad idea.

425
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:02,041
Then again, your judgment's

426
00:20:02,044 --> 00:20:04,014
in a perpetual state of impairment.

427
00:20:04,017 --> 00:20:06,876
I should've finished
you off the first time,

428
00:20:06,878 --> 00:20:10,838
although I doubt anybody
would've missed you.

429
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,881
Laurel!

430
00:20:15,626 --> 00:20:17,150
We're leaving now.

431
00:20:17,153 --> 00:20:18,363
You followed me here?

432
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:20,951
I didn't follow you. I...
I... I followed your DNA,

433
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:22,182
which you left on my door handle.

434
00:20:22,184 --> 00:20:23,684
It's all part of this new
program that I'm working on

435
00:20:23,686 --> 00:20:24,954
that tracks genetic material.

436
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:28,021
And here I thought I only had one
stalker that I had to worry about.

437
00:20:28,024 --> 00:20:29,407
So you should be flattered

438
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,158
because I only stop people that I like.

439
00:20:31,161 --> 00:20:32,331
And now that I've found you,

440
00:20:32,334 --> 00:20:34,393
you are going to tell
me what is going on.

441
00:20:38,366 --> 00:20:40,742
Hey, I know you're new
to this whole cop thing,

442
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:43,822
but the SCPD is not exactly
too popular in The Glades.

443
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,056
Right.

444
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:46,799
Where are we anyway?

445
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:48,712
Kidnapper's apartment.

446
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,303
His name is Sam Hackett,

447
00:20:50,306 --> 00:20:52,532
and he has a degree in
electrical engineering,

448
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:54,126
and he has motive.

449
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:56,993
His father, Dave, was
my father's bodyguard

450
00:20:56,996 --> 00:21:00,313
on the Queen's Gambit.

451
00:21:00,315 --> 00:21:02,866
Wh... why would he be
going after you for that?

452
00:21:06,321 --> 00:21:08,270
Dave made it to the life raft

453
00:21:08,272 --> 00:21:09,813
with my father and I.

454
00:21:09,816 --> 00:21:11,085
When my father realized

455
00:21:11,088 --> 00:21:14,084
that only one of us could survive,

456
00:21:14,087 --> 00:21:16,129
he shot him.

457
00:21:17,782 --> 00:21:19,281
I didn't know.

458
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,476
Nobody knew until Dr. Parker.

459
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:29,967
Sam Hackett, SCPD. Open up.

460
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:55,455
Huh. Sam had a search trip planned

461
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,869
to the North China sea.

462
00:21:56,871 --> 00:22:00,614
I'm sorry. He was still
looking for his father?

463
00:22:00,616 --> 00:22:05,470
Still holding out
hope he was alive? Why?

464
00:22:05,473 --> 00:22:07,222
Because you survived.

465
00:22:12,837 --> 00:22:14,479
And here are

466
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:17,732
my unredacted transcripts
with Dr. Parker.

467
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:23,229
All these years, Dinah.

468
00:22:23,231 --> 00:22:25,615
All these years he never got closure.

469
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:31,103
Oliver.

470
00:22:31,105 --> 00:22:32,659
You got to see this.

471
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:37,784
Looks like he was building

472
00:22:37,787 --> 00:22:41,822
some sort of weapon.

473
00:22:43,251 --> 00:22:46,319
Remember, they're the
ones that need us alive,

474
00:22:46,322 --> 00:22:48,030
not the other way around.

475
00:22:50,892 --> 00:22:53,810
I love it when a plan comes together.

476
00:23:20,463 --> 00:23:22,013
Unh!

477
00:23:40,925 --> 00:23:43,926
Looking for these?

478
00:23:43,928 --> 00:23:46,680
You just keep trying and failing.

479
00:23:46,683 --> 00:23:48,590
This time I came prepared.

480
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:01,856
Not prepared enough.

481
00:24:11,746 --> 00:24:16,415
This time, I'm gonna finish the job.

482
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,381
This is the Dragon.

483
00:24:36,383 --> 00:24:38,283
A.R.G.U.S. is coming for you.

484
00:24:38,286 --> 00:24:39,578
And we'll be sure to send him

485
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,266
your regards when we do.

486
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,392
What's the matter?

487
00:24:48,395 --> 00:24:50,715
You look like you've heard a ghost.

488
00:24:55,235 --> 00:24:57,950
What the hell just happened?

489
00:24:57,953 --> 00:25:01,245
Well, first, I overrode
the explosive program

490
00:25:01,248 --> 00:25:02,807
A.R.G.U.S. put inside your head

491
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,094
with a virtual reality simulation that

492
00:25:05,097 --> 00:25:06,598
started running about 20 minutes before

493
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,099
you remember getting your sedative.

494
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:11,082
Then I owned your ass.

495
00:25:11,084 --> 00:25:12,599
You're dead.

496
00:25:12,602 --> 00:25:15,711
No. See, that all
happened in your head, too.

497
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,664
By the way, harsh.

498
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:19,186
Get me out of here.

499
00:25:19,189 --> 00:25:21,476
See, I don't think you're gonna
want to be getting out of here

500
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,466
because if you were to do that,
Dante would be waiting for you.

501
00:25:24,469 --> 00:25:26,982
And I think he's gonna be
really pissed when he finds out

502
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,952
you gave us everything
we need to get him.

503
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,749
A.R.G.U.S. thanks you
for your cooperation.

504
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:39,444
As Star City's newest kidnapper
continues to elude the police,

505
00:25:39,446 --> 00:25:41,088
there have been renewed calls

506
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:43,334
demanding Oliver Queen step down.

507
00:25:43,337 --> 00:25:44,782
A recent poll showed

508
00:25:44,784 --> 00:25:48,037
that as many as 77%
of Star City citizens

509
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,743
would support his removal from the SC...

510
00:25:51,972 --> 00:25:53,746
Any luck with the evidence
at Hackett's place?

511
00:25:53,748 --> 00:25:55,899
Well, the guys in tech are
still working on I.D.-Ing

512
00:25:55,902 --> 00:25:57,756
the fragments, but
judging from his notes,

513
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:59,014
plan "B" involves a lot more

514
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,632
than just kidnapping a reporter.

515
00:26:00,634 --> 00:26:04,019
But we can't stop him if
we don't know where he is.

516
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,698
I know one way you can stop him...

517
00:26:06,701 --> 00:26:08,599
Fire me.

518
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:11,721
77% of Star City agrees with me.

519
00:26:11,724 --> 00:26:15,647
So that's what this is
about, public opinion?

520
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:18,650
No. I...

521
00:26:18,652 --> 00:26:20,597
I wore that mask for a reason.

522
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,791
Now that I've taken it off,

523
00:26:21,794 --> 00:26:23,877
maybe the consequences are
finally catching up with me.

524
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:25,539
Well, you can't take responsibility

525
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,825
for every choice some
lunatic makes, you know?

526
00:26:27,827 --> 00:26:30,502
No. I have to take
responsibility for this.

527
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,505
Me being on the force

528
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,435
puts your reputation at risk,

529
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:36,604
and it's putting lives in danger.

530
00:26:36,607 --> 00:26:40,332
Cops face risks every
day. That is the job.

531
00:26:40,335 --> 00:26:42,773
And you are not putting
anyone's life in danger,

532
00:26:42,776 --> 00:26:44,776
not unless you stop fighting for them.

533
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:46,320
You think you're gonna do one interview,

534
00:26:46,322 --> 00:26:48,229
and all of a sudden, your
problems go away overnight?

535
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,790
I think I have been so obsessed

536
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:52,584
with proving to people I'm not my father

537
00:26:52,587 --> 00:26:55,037
that I didn't stop and
look at all the ways

538
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,663
that I am exactly like him.

539
00:26:56,665 --> 00:26:59,939
I should have come
clean with Sam years ago.

540
00:26:59,942 --> 00:27:01,293
But you didn't,

541
00:27:01,295 --> 00:27:04,887
and you can't stop the
past from haunting you.

542
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,890
The only thing you have control over is

543
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:08,295
what you do going forward.

544
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:15,849
Let me break this down for you

545
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:18,251
in words that I think that you're
going to be able to understand.

546
00:27:18,253 --> 00:27:19,401
You are the D.A.

547
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,876
You cannot be seen attacking randos

548
00:27:21,879 --> 00:27:23,190
outside of a bar!

549
00:27:23,192 --> 00:27:25,809
Brett Collins isn't a rando.

550
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,787
He's supposed to be dead.

551
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,240
What does that mean? What
are you talking about?!

552
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:34,595
Collins is the drunk driver
who killed my father, okay?

553
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:36,686
I was 13.

554
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:40,874
And I spent so many years just dreaming

555
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:43,359
of the ways that I
was gonna make him pay.

556
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,120
And you know what? I did.

557
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,545
When I got my cry,

558
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:49,123
I tracked him down, and I killed him.

559
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:52,089
Or at least I thought I had killed him,

560
00:27:52,092 --> 00:27:53,887
but, apparently, he's still alive

561
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:57,140
and... and stalking me
on another earth. Here.

562
00:27:59,085 --> 00:28:00,543
What? What?

563
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:03,892
It's you haven't had
a problem talking about

564
00:28:03,895 --> 00:28:06,279
the dozens of other people
that you have killed.

565
00:28:06,282 --> 00:28:09,522
Um, so why... oh, why
keep this one a secret?

566
00:28:09,525 --> 00:28:11,596
If someone had killed my dad,

567
00:28:11,598 --> 00:28:13,558
I would want revenge, too.

568
00:28:15,268 --> 00:28:18,181
Collins... he caused the accident

569
00:28:18,184 --> 00:28:20,229
that killed my father,

570
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:22,565
but he wasn't the reason my father died.

571
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:26,277
He never should've been
on the road that day.

572
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:29,614
He was working a lot, which...

573
00:28:29,616 --> 00:28:32,167
I hated...

574
00:28:34,788 --> 00:28:36,441
But I knew on my birthday

575
00:28:36,444 --> 00:28:39,414
that we would be able to celebrate,

576
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,351
only he...

577
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:45,797
He showed up without my cake,

578
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:48,591
and I threw a tantrum.

579
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,569
So he went back out.

580
00:28:53,746 --> 00:28:56,389
That's when Collins
drove him off the road.

581
00:28:56,392 --> 00:28:59,542
And do you know the last words

582
00:28:59,545 --> 00:29:01,529
that I said to my father?

583
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:04,291
The last thing that I said
to him was "I hate you."

584
00:29:07,654 --> 00:29:09,921
My dad died because of me.

585
00:29:12,622 --> 00:29:15,098
Well, now that you've said it out loud,

586
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:19,881
can you understand
how irrational that is?

587
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,600
This is exactly the reason

588
00:29:21,603 --> 00:29:23,153
I've never told anyone before.

589
00:29:23,156 --> 00:29:27,429
Well, you should've so that that someone

590
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:32,343
could tell you that it's not your fault.

591
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,823
If someone is after you on this earth

592
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:40,685
or on any other earth,
we are going to get him

593
00:29:40,687 --> 00:29:43,580
whoever they are together.

594
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,689
Officer Selway, what do you got?

595
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:54,734
There's something strange
about these fragments.

596
00:29:54,737 --> 00:29:56,737
There's a partial
etching on some of them.

597
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,106
Separately, they don't mean much,

598
00:29:58,109 --> 00:29:59,684
but you put them together,

599
00:29:59,687 --> 00:30:01,514
you get the logo for Star City Electric.

600
00:30:01,516 --> 00:30:03,454
They use it to tag proprietary parts.

601
00:30:03,457 --> 00:30:06,082
Well, Hackett has a background
in electrical engineering.

602
00:30:06,085 --> 00:30:08,082
Do you think he was
moonlighting for this company?

603
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:09,338
I ran his SoC.

604
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,024
There's no record of him working there.

605
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:13,384
Maybe try Dave Hackett.

606
00:30:13,386 --> 00:30:15,270
After his father died, Sam spiraled.

607
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,584
Severe depression, got
picked up for drugs.

608
00:30:17,587 --> 00:30:18,919
If he wanted to get a job,

609
00:30:18,922 --> 00:30:20,418
he'd have to find a way to hide that.

610
00:30:20,421 --> 00:30:21,440
Well, damn.

611
00:30:21,443 --> 00:30:22,574
Someone with the father's SoC

612
00:30:22,576 --> 00:30:25,020
has been working at
SC Electric since 2015.

613
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:28,054
Hey, doesn't the sce use GPS
trackers in their work vans now?

614
00:30:28,057 --> 00:30:30,252
Yup, I'll run a trace.

615
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,532
How did that 240 go?

616
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:39,201
A couple of drunk frat
bros. Waste of time.

617
00:30:39,203 --> 00:30:40,971
What's going on over there?

618
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:42,705
I guess the box needed work.

619
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:47,527
And 3, 2, 1. Bam. Huh.

620
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,187
Found the location?

621
00:30:49,189 --> 00:30:51,815
Yeah, but it can't be right.
It says the Van's here.

622
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:53,984
Hey, did somebody call this in?

623
00:30:55,552 --> 00:30:57,695
Not yet.

624
00:30:57,698 --> 00:30:59,861
- Come on!
- What's happening?

625
00:30:59,864 --> 00:31:01,616
Hey, did somebody call SC Electric?

626
00:31:15,993 --> 00:31:17,492
You okay?

627
00:31:17,495 --> 00:31:19,978
Yeah.

628
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,817
Dinah, you okay?

629
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,436
What the hell was that?

630
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:26,836
I don't know.

631
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:38,612
That was only a warning.

632
00:31:38,615 --> 00:31:41,256
Because you've aided
and abetted Oliver Queen,

633
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:44,094
you're all going to suffer.

634
00:31:44,096 --> 00:31:46,755
Uh!

635
00:31:46,757 --> 00:31:50,008
The static generated by the electricity

636
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,694
coursing through these walls right now,

637
00:31:51,696 --> 00:31:53,529
it makes this vest

638
00:31:53,532 --> 00:31:58,160
and every substance that
can hold a current deadly.

639
00:32:03,365 --> 00:32:05,106
What the hell do you want?

640
00:32:05,109 --> 00:32:07,209
Oliver Queen.

641
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:09,361
Until I find him,

642
00:32:09,363 --> 00:32:11,929
every minute, a body drops.

643
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:14,108
He must've hacked into
the electrical grid.

644
00:32:14,111 --> 00:32:15,636
I want you to get outside,
and you shut it down.

645
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:16,620
I'll stall him.

646
00:32:16,623 --> 00:32:19,046
How? He wants you dead.

647
00:32:19,048 --> 00:32:20,348
Just hurry.

648
00:32:24,303 --> 00:32:25,585
So much for your hero.

649
00:32:25,587 --> 00:32:27,730
Who's ready to die?

650
00:32:27,732 --> 00:32:32,434
Sam, that's enough.

651
00:32:32,436 --> 00:32:36,572
You want me? I'm right here.

652
00:32:36,574 --> 00:32:38,816
But I need you to let these people go.

653
00:32:38,818 --> 00:32:40,613
They have nothing to do with this.

654
00:32:40,616 --> 00:32:41,841
Of course they do.

655
00:32:57,293 --> 00:33:00,773
SCPD, the news.

656
00:33:00,776 --> 00:33:02,558
They're the ones who allow you

657
00:33:02,561 --> 00:33:05,341
to fool everyone into
thinking you're a hero,

658
00:33:05,344 --> 00:33:07,506
but I know what you really are.

659
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:09,939
I'm a liar, right, Sam?

660
00:33:09,941 --> 00:33:12,773
Because I did lie about your father.

661
00:33:12,776 --> 00:33:15,093
He was on the Queen's Gambit.

662
00:33:15,096 --> 00:33:17,508
He made it to the life raft.

663
00:33:17,511 --> 00:33:20,156
And before my father took his own life,

664
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,117
he murdered your dad

665
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,027
so that I could survive.

666
00:33:25,623 --> 00:33:30,108
Good. You finally...
You finally admit it.

667
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,369
I was worried that I was gonna be judged

668
00:33:32,371 --> 00:33:34,255
by the sins of my father...

669
00:33:36,063 --> 00:33:41,591
But... but not coming to
you for all of these years

670
00:33:41,594 --> 00:33:44,331
and not telling you the truth,

671
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:48,470
I never gave you a
chance to get closure.

672
00:33:48,473 --> 00:33:50,721
That's on me.

673
00:33:50,723 --> 00:33:53,340
I'm truly sorry.

674
00:33:53,342 --> 00:33:57,482
No, no, no, no.

675
00:33:57,485 --> 00:34:00,846
We are way, way past apologies.

676
00:34:00,849 --> 00:34:03,683
My father is gone because of you,

677
00:34:03,685 --> 00:34:05,609
and I need to make that right.

678
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:12,293
Uh!

679
00:34:14,696 --> 00:34:16,580
I'm going to give everyone here

680
00:34:16,582 --> 00:34:18,749
the chance to make a decision

681
00:34:18,751 --> 00:34:22,610
my father never got to...
Whether to live or die.

682
00:34:22,613 --> 00:34:26,550
Sam, no one is dying tonight.

683
00:34:26,553 --> 00:34:33,280
Kill him, you live. Don't, you all fry.

684
00:34:33,283 --> 00:34:35,407
You have till the count of 3. 1...

685
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,268
Don't do this, Sam.

686
00:34:37,271 --> 00:34:39,111
2...

687
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:43,581
I don't want to die.

688
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:48,278
If you really believe

689
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,190
that you have to do this,

690
00:34:52,192 --> 00:34:53,407
I understand.

691
00:34:55,074 --> 00:34:56,833
3.

692
00:34:56,836 --> 00:34:59,262
Pull the damn trigger.

693
00:35:08,797 --> 00:35:10,380
Then I guess we all die.

694
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:21,832
Gun!

695
00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:28,063
Like I said, nobody dies tonight.

696
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:31,319
That includes you.

697
00:35:34,687 --> 00:35:36,613
I think the entire city

698
00:35:36,616 --> 00:35:39,757
can sleep a little more
soundly knowing that

699
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,742
Sam Hackett is behind bars.

700
00:35:41,744 --> 00:35:45,422
Well, that's the reason
I asked to be here today.

701
00:35:45,425 --> 00:35:47,657
I'd like to set the record straight.

702
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,109
12 years ago,

703
00:35:49,112 --> 00:35:52,479
when my father's boat went down...

704
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,389
He and I weren't the only two people

705
00:35:58,392 --> 00:36:00,103
to reach the life raft.

706
00:36:00,106 --> 00:36:05,222
A third individual, his
bodyguard, Dave Hackett,

707
00:36:05,225 --> 00:36:06,682
was also aboard.

708
00:36:06,685 --> 00:36:09,343
Now, when my father realized that there

709
00:36:09,346 --> 00:36:13,334
wasn't enough food and water
for everyone, as you know,

710
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,403
he sacrificed himself for me.

711
00:36:16,406 --> 00:36:19,616
But before he took his own life,

712
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:22,770
he took Dave Hackett's.

713
00:36:22,773 --> 00:36:28,122
Your father killed Dave Hackett.

714
00:36:28,124 --> 00:36:30,278
My father killed Dave Hackett.

715
00:36:30,281 --> 00:36:35,296
The people of S-Star
City deserve the truth.

716
00:36:35,298 --> 00:36:37,065
Why come forward now?

717
00:36:37,068 --> 00:36:39,317
Hackett has been apprehended.

718
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:41,056
The threat is over.

719
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:43,335
Because transparency is about

720
00:36:43,338 --> 00:36:47,911
more than just not wearing a mask.

721
00:36:51,405 --> 00:36:53,855
I've made mistakes.

722
00:36:53,858 --> 00:36:58,336
I'm sure that I will
make mistakes again.

723
00:36:58,338 --> 00:37:02,582
But what I will not do is lie.

724
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:07,345
That is my promise to you,

725
00:37:07,347 --> 00:37:10,098
the people of Star City.

726
00:37:17,924 --> 00:37:19,641
I have waited a long time

727
00:37:19,644 --> 00:37:22,391
to wipe the smirk off of Diaz's face.

728
00:37:22,394 --> 00:37:24,717
Curtis, this is very, very good work.

729
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,886
Well, I am happy to help
make Diaz's life miserable

730
00:37:27,889 --> 00:37:29,055
anytime anywhere.

731
00:37:29,058 --> 00:37:31,203
Your VR program, it is a game changer.

732
00:37:31,206 --> 00:37:32,481
Now that we got the Dante info,

733
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:33,924
we can get rid of those neck bombs

734
00:37:33,927 --> 00:37:35,419
and finally cancel the Ghost Initiative

735
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:36,899
once and for all, right?

736
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:38,710
Right?

737
00:37:41,772 --> 00:37:43,772
Curtis...

738
00:37:43,775 --> 00:37:47,869
The Ghost Initiative
program still has value.

739
00:37:47,872 --> 00:37:49,462
We need boots on the ground.

740
00:37:49,464 --> 00:37:51,516
Look, thanks to you, we
can now get in their heads,

741
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,551
predict problems before they arise.

742
00:37:53,554 --> 00:37:55,709
This is going to save a
lot of lives in the field.

743
00:37:55,711 --> 00:37:57,336
Except maybe theirs.

744
00:37:57,338 --> 00:37:59,255
When the Dante threat is over,

745
00:37:59,257 --> 00:38:02,567
I promise you we will shut
this thing down for good.

746
00:38:02,569 --> 00:38:04,633
There's always gonna be another Dante.

747
00:38:04,636 --> 00:38:05,719
There's always gonna be

748
00:38:05,722 --> 00:38:07,058
a logical reason to compromise,

749
00:38:07,061 --> 00:38:08,322
but I'm not doing that anymore.

750
00:38:08,325 --> 00:38:09,917
We've had this conversation.

751
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,483
Walking away is not the answer.

752
00:38:11,486 --> 00:38:13,310
Oh, I'm not walking away.

753
00:38:13,312 --> 00:38:14,869
I'm just not going to be

754
00:38:14,872 --> 00:38:18,081
following orders blindly anymore either.

755
00:38:18,084 --> 00:38:20,124
I'm gonna call my own shots.

756
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:29,450
A stalker from a different earth.

757
00:38:29,453 --> 00:38:32,513
Of course. Why wouldn't there be?

758
00:38:34,825 --> 00:38:37,418
Ah. I hope you're not leaving

759
00:38:37,421 --> 00:38:39,336
because I have some good news.

760
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:41,548
We have Brett Collins in custody.

761
00:38:41,551 --> 00:38:42,771
And after what you just told me,

762
00:38:42,773 --> 00:38:45,066
I'm gonna make sure he stays
there for a very long time.

763
00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:46,231
But how can you hold him

764
00:38:46,234 --> 00:38:47,983
for crimes he committed
on another earth?

765
00:38:47,986 --> 00:38:49,762
This scumbag is, unfortunately,

766
00:38:49,765 --> 00:38:51,449
our earth's problem.

767
00:38:51,451 --> 00:38:53,475
Beat cop picked him up
for public intoxication,

768
00:38:53,477 --> 00:38:55,635
and it looks like he
has a history of stalking

769
00:38:55,638 --> 00:38:57,696
and anti-vigilante violence.

770
00:38:57,699 --> 00:38:58,578
Well, that makes sense.

771
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,529
I mean, he would've seen your interview,

772
00:38:59,531 --> 00:39:01,586
and you are the former
black Canary, so...

773
00:39:02,819 --> 00:39:06,062
And the Karma gods must
really be on your side,

774
00:39:06,065 --> 00:39:07,306
because Cisco just texted

775
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:09,166
that Brett Collins from your earth

776
00:39:09,169 --> 00:39:11,876
died 5 years ago on his porch

777
00:39:11,879 --> 00:39:13,304
from unknown causes.

778
00:39:13,306 --> 00:39:15,709
So 5 minutes ago, I
had 2 Brett problems,

779
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,002
and now I have none.

780
00:39:17,005 --> 00:39:18,103
None.

781
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,700
Well, thank you. Thank
you to the both of you.

782
00:39:22,703 --> 00:39:26,478
It's not so bad having other
people back you up, is it?

783
00:39:29,347 --> 00:39:30,627
Hey.

784
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,897
Laurel had a stalker?

785
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,071
Yeah, it's been a crazy couple of days.

786
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:37,186
Yup.

787
00:39:37,188 --> 00:39:39,371
Speaking of, I saw your interview.

788
00:39:39,374 --> 00:39:41,967
I'm so proud of you. That
couldn't have been easy.

789
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,170
It's a start.

790
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:45,329
It's gonna take a lot
more to convince this city

791
00:39:45,332 --> 00:39:46,546
I've changed.

792
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:48,650
Oh, I think you'd be surprised.

793
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,753
I, um, I forgot...

794
00:39:53,755 --> 00:39:55,847
I forgot something over here.

795
00:40:06,735 --> 00:40:09,027
I saw your interview.

796
00:40:09,029 --> 00:40:10,936
Hmm.

797
00:40:10,938 --> 00:40:13,180
That took guts.

798
00:40:13,182 --> 00:40:14,741
It was the truth.

799
00:40:16,778 --> 00:40:18,685
It took me too long to say it.

800
00:40:18,687 --> 00:40:22,231
But you did.

801
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:25,168
And that's a start.

802
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:29,159
When I was little, I imagined

803
00:40:29,162 --> 00:40:32,146
what it'd be like to
live in the Queen mansion.

804
00:40:32,149 --> 00:40:35,553
Your lives seemed so glamorous...

805
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:40,590
But even more than that, I imagined

806
00:40:40,593 --> 00:40:43,157
what it must have been
like to have a family.

807
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,046
Your father robbed me of that,

808
00:40:46,048 --> 00:40:48,424
something I swore I could never forgive.

809
00:40:48,426 --> 00:40:53,053
But I see now you are
different from him.

810
00:40:53,055 --> 00:40:54,906
I'm trying to be.

811
00:40:56,828 --> 00:41:01,422
Does all this mean you're ready to talk?

812
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:05,816
It means I'm ready to
think about talking.

813
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:08,002
I'll take that.

814
00:41:31,938 --> 00:41:35,275
