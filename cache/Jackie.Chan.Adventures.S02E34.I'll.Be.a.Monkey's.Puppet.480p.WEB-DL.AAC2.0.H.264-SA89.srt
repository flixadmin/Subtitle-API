1
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:08,040
Jade: But, Jackie,

2
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:10,209
I can't take first prize
at the talent show

3
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:11,777
if I don't
have a talent.

4
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:14,446
Jade, you have
a fine talent...

5
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:16,348
For getting
into trouble.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,517
Har har.

7
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,420
How about music?

8
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:23,255
(Plays recorder off-key)

9
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:24,523
Ugh!

10
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,958
Drill team?

11
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,895
Oof!

12
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:31,196
Archery?

13
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,369
Perhaps something
less hazardous to my health...

14
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:38,637
(Gasps)

15
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,974
Like ventriloquism.

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,543
Huh?

17
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:48,547
Uncle's not going
to like this.

18
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,652
Jade,

19
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,454
it's a monkey king!

20
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,057
A what?

21
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:00,059
Man: The monkey king...

22
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:03,796
A most revered character
from ancient folklore.

23
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:06,031
Only $20.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,568
Uh, I don't know,

25
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,537
he's kinda creepy-looking.

26
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,338
You're not
so cute yourself!

27
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:14,907
Aah!

28
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,011
You know how
to throw your voice?

29
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:20,813
Jackie as puppet:
Jackie won
a few talent shows

30
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:22,181
when
he was your age.

31
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:24,450
You gotta teach me,
Jackie!

32
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:27,152
No finer puppet
with which to learn.

33
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:28,887
This hand-carved
specimen

34
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,490
is the only one
of its kind.

35
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:33,158
We will take it.

36
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,432
(Sinister laugh)

37
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,589
Uncle: You bought this

38
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,391
from my competition?!

39
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,428
Hey, it broke.

40
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,097
Because it is junk!

41
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,899
Kai ching
steals my business

42
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:48,700
by selling
cheap trinkets.

43
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,469
But Kai ching said
it was one of a kind.

44
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:51,670
Ow! Ow!

45
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,139
And that is 2 of a kind
to teach you

46
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,875
that bringing
my competitor's goods
into my shop

47
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,610
invites bad chi.

48
00:02:58,612 --> 00:02:59,945
One more thing,

49
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:03,248
do you see any
monkey kings in here? No?!

50
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,017
That is because
the monkey king is known

51
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:06,552
for his love of mischief.

52
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,823
And he is creepy-looking.

53
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,425
Uncle, please.

54
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:14,693
It is only a puppet,

55
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,728
and Jade's talent show
is tomorrow.

56
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,463
You will be sorry.

57
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,201
Come on, you!

58
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:23,769
Here, Jade.

59
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:25,637
Let me
monkey with it.

60
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,309
Hmm.

61
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,977
An inscription--

62
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,380
"to free me of glitches
and put you in stitches,

63
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,316
"this merry ape begs

64
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:38,784
pull my leg."

65
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,819
Go for it.

66
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,125
(Sinister laugh)

67
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,562
(All gasp)

68
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,931
I'm free!

69
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,534
Greetings,
kiddies!

70
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,302
The monkey king
is in the house!

71
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,271
Sorry, no autographs.

72
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:00,939
Nice sumo!

73
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,774
Is he house-trained?

74
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,112
Grrrr!

75
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:10,882
What have you done with--

76
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:12,150
(all gasp)

77
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:15,887
Jackie!

78
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,356
No! No, no, no!

79
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,690
(Mock crying)

80
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:21,860
What have you
done with him,
you dirty apes?

81
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:24,796
Apes?
- Oh. That would be me.

82
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:27,733
Ha ha ha. Oh, I'm
just pulling your leg.

83
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:30,535
Jackie pulled mine,
and that's why
he's where he is today:

84
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:31,870
A proud graduate of...

85
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,372
Marionette u!

86
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,240
Congratulations,
you little dummy, you.

87
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,808
Jackie is
not a dummy!

88
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,010
Change him back!

89
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:40,045
Well, I could, I suppose,

90
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:42,714
but one of us would have
to stay stuck in dollsville,

91
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,916
and I ain't
never going back!

92
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:48,120
Besides,
as the mandrake of mirth,

93
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,454
the madcap of monkeys--

94
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,857
don't confuse me with
that other monkey king, Kong--

95
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,592
I have a long list
of pranks to pull!

96
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:54,826
Ta-ta.

97
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,265
Tohru, stop him!

98
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:01,867
Gladly, <i> sensei.</i>

99
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,703
Jackie, say something!

100
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,642
See what happens when
you do not listen to uncle.

101
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:11,877
(Bell rings)

102
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:14,146
Monkey king:
Special delivery!

103
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,787
Oh, please do not laugh.

104
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:24,790
We are dealing with
a very sick mind.

105
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,892
Uncle, you have
to do something!

106
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:28,493
I am not geppetto!

107
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,796
I do not bring
puppets to life!

108
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,098
You're a genius!

109
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,400
Well, thank you.

110
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:42,040
The rat talisman brings
motion to the motionless.

111
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,810
This oughta get Jackie
back on his feet.

112
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,091
Well, it's a start.

113
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:00,759
Jackie: What? What is it?

114
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,427
Uh...Nothing!

115
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,463
Do not look in mirror.

116
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:06,631
Bwaaaaa!

117
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,167
I told you not
to look in mirror!

118
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,103
He never listens.

119
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:12,604
I am a puppet!

120
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,639
A living puppet!

121
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,007
Not for long.

122
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,576
We're gonna find
puff the magic monkey

123
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,845
and make him
undo this hoodoo.

124
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,124
A row of ducks.

125
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:34,159
Always good
for big yuks!

126
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,233
¶ Babalu ¶

127
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,379
how do you know
the monkey king went this way?

128
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,681
Just following
the breadcrumbs.

129
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:01,820
Whoa.

130
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:03,054
Did I do that?

131
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:04,890
(Ship's horn blares)

132
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,062
I'm king of the world!

133
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,464
Aah!

134
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:13,765
Glacier!

135
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,204
Don't touch the fur!

136
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,338
I'm royalty.

137
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,107
Give me back my body!

138
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,276
Aah! The puppet!
It spoke!

139
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,811
Say.

140
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:28,613
How do you do that?
I didn't get to talk
when I was wood.

141
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:31,983
We'll see what we can do,
your majesty,

142
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,119
if you switch places
with Jackie.

143
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,987
So soon?

144
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,660
I hate to quit...

145
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:43,161
When I'm on a roll.

146
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,467
(Gasps)
You've gotta be joking!

147
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:50,101
Joking is
all he does.

148
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,011
Both: Bwaaaaaa!

149
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,179
Aahhhhh!

150
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:02,547
Come on!

151
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,849
(Groans)

152
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,454
Ha ha ha ha!

153
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,756
(Both panting)

154
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,562
(Both sigh)

155
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,977
Alley oop!

156
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,345
Whoaaaa!

157
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:34,813
Uhh!

158
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,281
(Gasp)
(Gasp)

159
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,850
Both: Noooooo!

160
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,721
Ooh, instant replay!

161
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,000
Jade, wait here.

162
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,974
Whoa!

163
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,143
Knucklehead talks
and rocks!

164
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,714
Go, Jackie.

165
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,316
Mayday! Mayday!

166
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,357
Bwaaaa!

167
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:22,928
Look out!
Look out! Look out!

168
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,329
Whoa!
- Whoa!

169
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,199
(Pants)

170
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,368
Why have your doughnut dry

171
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,170
when you can dunk?!

172
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,980
Jackie?!

173
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,750
(Coughs)

174
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,791
(Laughs)
Oh, that was rich!

175
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,726
A classic monkeyshine!

176
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:55,961
Ha ha ha!

177
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:57,128
All right, chimp,

178
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,530
you've had your fun.

179
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:01,466
There is nothing comical
about endangering lives.

180
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:02,934
Ha ha ha ha--

181
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,402
there isn't?

182
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,472
You two aren't kidding,
are you?

183
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:09,174
You want to stop
the laughter,

184
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:11,810
and I just can't
let that happen!

185
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,878
Ok, we tried
reasoning with you.

186
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,380
No more Mr. nice guy.

187
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,916
Jackie, it's time
to give happy boy
a heapin' helpin'

188
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:21,353
of the ancient art
of butt whoop!

189
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,521
If it's
a punch-and-Judy show
you want...

190
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:24,923
(Whistles)

191
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,777
Boys...

192
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,179
Cook his goose!

193
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,582
Wait! I have
no quarrel with you!

194
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,250
Aah!

195
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,520
Tag team!

196
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:56,621
Whoa!

197
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:57,756
Huh?

198
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,827
Dance, little monkey,
dance!

199
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,602
Jackie!

200
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,808
Ooh. That's got to hurt.

201
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,144
Only my pride.

202
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,278
Now, students,

203
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,480
what have we
learned today?

204
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:25,417
You don't want to put
the king of comedy
in a bad humor!

205
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:33,291
Tohru: Hold still.

206
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,595
Let's hear it
for detachable parts.

207
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:40,598
Jackie, do you wish
some wax to restore
your shine?

208
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,833
No, thank you!

209
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,769
I do not plan on
being wooden much longer!

210
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,504
Isn't that right,
uncle?

211
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,773
Patience, Jackie.

212
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,408
Huh?! At this rate,

213
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,944
I will be a puppet
forever!

214
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,779
I do not want
to collect dust

215
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,948
in your shop window,
uncle!

216
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,452
Shouldn't we just ask
Kai ching if he knows
of a remedy?

217
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,187
What?!

218
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:05,557
Kai ching is the reason
you are in this kettle
of fish to begin with.

219
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,692
Well, that is
exactly my point.

220
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:11,463
You want me to grovel
to that snake oil salesman?!

221
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,598
Never!
I have everything I need

222
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,667
to research an antidote
for you right here,

223
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,502
thank you.

224
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,471
I say we see
that chuckling chimp
about an antidote!

225
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,940
We have had enough
monkey business, Jade!

226
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,708
And you need
to go to school.

227
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,043
But, Jackie,

228
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,144
this is way more
important

229
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,912
than anything
going on at schoo--

230
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,047
(gasps)

231
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,548
The talent show!

232
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,751
It's today!
I have to win!

233
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,053
First prize is a trip
to moose world, Florida!

234
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,855
What am I gonna do?

235
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,028
Oh, no.

236
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,164
No! No no no!

237
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,971
Um...

238
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,507
A horse walks
into a doctor's office.

239
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,842
The doctor asks,
"why the long face?"

240
00:12:57,844 --> 00:12:59,544
(Audience laughs)

241
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,516
It's not bad enough
those two want to drop
the curtain on me.

242
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,584
Now they're stealing
my thunder?

243
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,653
A brief pause
in my pranks, then,

244
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:11,623
while I kibosh
the competition!

245
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,592
(Whispering) Jade,
I don't think this
is competing fairly.

246
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,327
Zip the lips,
Jackie!

247
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,363
You're gonna
tank my act!

248
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,731
Stop the show!

249
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:20,965
(Gasps)

250
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,400
They're cheating!

251
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,868
The puppet is alive,
I tell you!

252
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,069
It's alive!

253
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,738
(Audience gasps)

254
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,775
Help me out
here, Jackie!

255
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,410
Just a dummy!

256
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,745
See?

257
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:34,979
Nothing up
my sleeves!

258
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,381
Oh?

259
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,449
Maybe this will put
a little spring
in his step!

260
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:39,751
Aah! Hey!

261
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:41,119
Oh! Ow ow ow!

262
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,288
Heh heh heh!
Why bother with ants
in your pants

263
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,723
when you could have
termites in your tights!

264
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:46,991
Jackie!

265
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,495
Ha ha!

266
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,530
If you want
real talent, folks,

267
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:55,233
watch me pull a rabbit
out of this hat!

268
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,936
Har har.

269
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,637
(Audience laughs)

270
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,573
You like me!

271
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:03,374
You really like me!

272
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:08,179
(Gasps)
Here comes chuckie!

273
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,185
Ohhh.
I have found
no means

274
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,887
of reversing
the curse, <i> sensei.</i>

275
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:19,324
Surely there is a volume
we have overlooked!

276
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,359
Monkey...Monkey...

277
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,527
Monkey...

278
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,629
Perhaps we should
visit Kai ching,

279
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,364
for Jackie's sake?

280
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:28,800
(Sighs)

281
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:30,201
All right.

282
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,740
We can't
let him escape.

283
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:37,475
I will be stuck
this way!

284
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:38,710
Don't fret yet,
Jackie.

285
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,511
Trail's still warm!

286
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,626
A lumberyard?

287
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:58,329
Aah!
This is no place
for a man made of wood!

288
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,832
Whoa!

289
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,100
Jackie!

290
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,805
Ha ha!

291
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,140
And when
you're sawdust,

292
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,709
we'll both
be feeling chipper!

293
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:13,177
Ha ha ha ha!

294
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,147
Bad day, bad day, bad day!

295
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:25,990
You wouldn't!

296
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,292
That's not funny!

297
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:28,359
Haven't you noticed?

298
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,628
I have a weird
sense of humor!

299
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,198
Aah!

300
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,734
Oh! Detachable parts!

301
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:42,640
Unh!

302
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,475
Fancy footwork!

303
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,481
How much wood does
a woodchuck Chuck?

304
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,417
Oh, my gosh! Look out!

305
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,620
Huh?

306
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,790
Can't believe
- I fell for that old gag.

307
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,661
He keeps his shop open later
just to spite me!

308
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,134
Hmmph!

309
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,704
What brings you here?

310
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,939
Nothing.
Just browsing.

311
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:18,376
We wish to reverse the curse
of the monkey king puppet.

312
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:19,677
Ah, yes.

313
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,317
This contains
the answers you seek.

314
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,585
We will take it.

315
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,454
You will purchase it.

316
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,089
$200.

317
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:33,591
Aah!

318
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:34,826
You pirate!

319
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,894
This is no trinket.

320
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:38,563
It is very rare.

321
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,633
$10.

322
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:43,935
200.

323
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:45,937
20!
My final offer!

324
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:47,105
Uh, here's 200.

325
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:50,008
Why did you pay
retail, tohru?!

326
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,176
He was
weakening!

327
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,178
Hmm. To reverse
the curse,

328
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,515
the monkey king
must pull the leg
of its puppet victim.

329
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:01,386
That is all?!
For $200?!

330
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:04,856
Do you want me
to throw in a tea cozy?

331
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,557
Do you want me
to throw in

332
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,426
a piece
of uncle?!

333
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:11,295
No purchase
necessary!

334
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,897
<i>Sensei,</i> please.

335
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:21,773
Dead end!

336
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,241
Up and over!

337
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,647
(Cell phone rings)

338
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,449
Uncle?

339
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:34,952
What?
The monkey king
has to pull my leg?

340
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:45,963
Timber!

341
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,700
Talk later!

342
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:56,941
Cowabunga!

343
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,076
Aah!

344
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,283
Whoa!
- Whoa!

345
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,621
Logrolling?!

346
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,490
Now they're stealing
my lumberjack bit!

347
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:13,691
Whoa!
- Whoa!

348
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:15,726
Whoa--oomph!
Whoa--oomph!

349
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,595
Ohhh.

350
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,634
We have to get the monkey king
to pull your leg!

351
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,536
Unh! But how
can we trick

352
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:27,472
the ultimate
trickster?

353
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,412
Hey, Jackie?

354
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,681
How 'bout
we rock his world?

355
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,883
You know,
I won a few
talent shows

356
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,685
when
I was your age.

357
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,257
Stop me if you've
heard this one before.

358
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,331
Hey!

359
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,533
Where is everyone?!

360
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,035
Jackie: Shh!

361
00:18:58,037 --> 00:18:59,504
Here he comes!

362
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:00,838
Going up!

363
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:06,010
Third floor: Housewares,
ladies' undergarments,

364
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,111
puppets!

365
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:09,514
Jackie: Don't
let him see us!

366
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:12,984
Gotcha!

367
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,523
Hyah!

368
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,791
Whoa!

369
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:22,360
Unh!

370
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,929
What do you know?

371
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,464
He fell for it!

372
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,300
Uhh! Uhh!

373
00:19:29,302 --> 00:19:30,902
Tough crowd.

374
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:32,370
I'll help you out of there
if you promise

375
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:33,804
to stop stalking Jackie!

376
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,206
Oh, sure!

377
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,309
No problem!
Got yourself a deal!

378
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:40,011
Unh!

379
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,379
Hang on!

380
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:43,681
I'll grab a stick
or something!

381
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:47,785
Here!

382
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:53,057
Prepare to wear pretty
concrete slippers, my dear!

383
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,659
Huh?!

384
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:56,427
Uncle said you had
to pull the leg,

385
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,229
he didn't say Jackie
had to be wearing it!

386
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,867
That's...Not...

387
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,101
Funny!

388
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,646
The Jack is back!

389
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,415
In the flesh!

390
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,984
And I hope
to stay this way.

391
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:21,552
Knock on wood.

392
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,263
Hey, Jackie!

393
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,098
What's your favorite fruit?

394
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,233
I love fruit.

395
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:36,968
Every morning
I get fresh fruit.

396
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,169
Pineapple,

397
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:39,437
papaya!

398
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,705
A lot of papaya!

399
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:41,839
Banana.

400
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:44,075
Very good for the stomach,

401
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,310
good for the digest--
uh, good everything.

402
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:47,678
Banana's good.

403
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,447
Did you ever see
a fat monkey?
