1
00:00:56,807 --> 00:01:01,062
There's a legend that precedes
the dawn of our civilization.

2
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:05,524
A vile god, so large and so powerful

3
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:09,487
that it consumed entire planets as fuel.

4
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,989
Few believed such a thing could be true,

5
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:17,536
until the day we saw Unicron
with our own eyes.

6
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,396
But he didn't just come for our planet.

7
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,649
He wanted our greatest technology,

8
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,943
the Transwarp Key.

9
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:53,322
And he sent his most powerful henchman
to collect it,

10
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:55,157
Scourge.

11
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:45,916
More enemies are landing.

12
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,376
We won't be safe for long.

13
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,627
Do we have the key?

14
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,505
You must take it.

15
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,341
Keep it hidden,

16
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:56,218
so that it never falls
into the hands of Unicron.

17
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,929
But, Apelinq, we can fight.

18
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:02,850
No. Protecting our Transwarp Key
is all that matters!

19
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,977
Go. Use it to escape.

20
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:06,812
What will you do?

21
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,815
I'll hold him off.

22
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,692
Buy you some time.

23
00:03:12,485 --> 00:03:13,694
Then I'm staying with you.

24
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:15,821
This is my fight.

25
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:19,992
Listen,
if Unicron were to get the key,

26
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:22,328
he could open a portal
through time and space

27
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:25,206
with no end to the worlds
he could destroy.

28
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:29,085
It is now your time to lead
the Maximals,

29
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,170
Optimus Primal.

30
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:57,571
So you're this planet's great warrior.

31
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:04,328
You have such a beautiful world

32
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:09,917
filled with an abundance of life.

33
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,255
Savory.

34
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,925
My master grows hungry.

35
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:23,848
Give me the Transwarp Key,
and he will spare your home.

36
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:27,393
We'd rather die
than let him reach other planets.

37
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,896
So be it.

38
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,458
Benefits of serving the almighty Unicron.

39
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,255
They never learn.

40
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,216
You're too late, Scourge.

41
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,928
Your master will be trapped
in this galaxy forever.

42
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,602
No!

43
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,610
His sacrifice will be our oath.

44
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:19,778
To preserve the key,

45
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,239
no matter the cost.

46
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:36,378
You let them slip away
with the Transwarp Key.

47
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:40,925
Scour the universe
and find where the Maximals have gone.

48
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:45,804
When you acquire the key,
use it to bring me to you.

49
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,057
Yes, my lord.

50
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:54,188
Once I have the key,
I alone will reign supreme.

51
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,667
All right, baby, come on.

52
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,294
Show me the money.
Show me the money.

53
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,092
Here we go. There we go.

54
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,428
Yo, Sonic. Breakfast ready yet?

55
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,681
I ain't your butler, Kris.

56
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,434
Come on, man.
No names over the airwaves.

57
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:14,685
It's Tails.

58
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,729
Oh, my bad,

59
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:20,065
Kristopher Diaz from 974 Wilson Avenue,

60
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:21,900
Apartment 2-C, Brooklyn.

61
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:24,194
No real names. They're listening.

62
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:27,615
Ain't no secret government agencies
worried about us, Tails.

63
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,700
Now get your behind out here
while it's hot.

64
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,745
At least they got that going for 'em.
Here, I ironed this for you.

65
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:35,331
- I already ironed it. What...
- Yeah, like you cooked those eggs?

66
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,958
What you mean?
They're just... seasoned.

67
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:40,252
Aw, come on.

68
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:41,545
Come eat, bro.

69
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,173
I can't get past Bowser.

70
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:45,674
Well, good morning to you too.

71
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:47,551
Drink this and take your medicine.

72
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:49,678
- All of it.
- Okay.

73
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:51,221
Are you sure you can take him?

74
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,932
Yeah, hospital's on the way.
I got time.

75
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,810
And if that lady,
that administrator, is there

76
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,354
and she mentions a bill,

77
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,438
just...

78
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,899
tell her we're handling it.

79
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,569
I will. And after today,
I'll be able to help out more.

80
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,155
Good luck on the interview.

81
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,783
Don't forget to laugh
at all their jokes.

82
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:13,869
- White people love that shit.
- Ma, language.

83
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,037
Okay!

84
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,498
Remember, I have class tonight,
so I'll be home late.

85
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,166
- Los quiero.
- I love you.

86
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,669
Hurry up, man.
We gotta get into the city.

87
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,633
Hey. Hold up. Hold up.

88
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,301
Your hand's hurting again?

89
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,970
No, it's nothing.

90
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:33,972
Yo, let me see.

91
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:37,810
Kris.

92
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:43,023
It's swollen.

93
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:46,235
The sickle cells must be
blocking the blood flow again.

94
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:47,778
How long has this been going on?

95
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,279
Couple days.

96
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,199
Hey, yo, look, I told you,

97
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,826
you gotta tell me these things.

98
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,495
You fighting this alone,
or we fighting it together?

99
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,039
Together.

100
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,917
Home team?

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,085
Home team.

102
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:12,720
Two for ten. Two for...
Stop touching everything.

103
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:13,887
Oh, hell no.

104
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,682
Yo, Kris, what'd I tell you about
letting your mans come out the crib

105
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:17,850
looking like a whole square?

106
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,852
Only so much I can do.

107
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,729
Yeah, whatever, bro.
Look. Here.

108
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,273
My dawg!

109
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:27,901
When you gonna let me put your skills
to work and get you some real money?

110
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,112
Yeah. Says the dude
who can't even afford cable.

111
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,488
Says the guy who...

112
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,574
I choose not to purchase cable.

113
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:36,201
It's my own personal way
to protest the vampiric nature

114
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:37,494
of modern-day capitalism!

115
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,748
Hey, good luck with that interview
in that dusty suit!

116
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,058
Dang it, dang it, dang it.

117
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,064
I'm coming.

118
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,649
Hey, guys. That's a good one,

119
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,735
but the Ankylosaurus
was an armored dinosaur.

120
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,752
Thank you, thank you for being...
patient.

121
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,212
Intern? Intern?

122
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,131
I paged you three times.
Why didn't you call me?

123
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,217
Okay, well,
I figured if I stopped to call,

124
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,301
that would make me later.

125
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,720
The police are here.

126
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,597
They busted an art auction.

127
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,308
The owner claims
that everything is authentic,

128
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,852
but they want a second opinion.

129
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,313
All right.

130
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:53,278
The Da Vinci sketch is legit.
The painting's a copy.

131
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:55,322
Real one's at the National Gallery
in London.

132
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,450
Roman vase.

133
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:02,120
Valuable, but you are not
gonna retire off of them.

134
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,083
The sinner's Greek curse tablet.

135
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,544
It would be expensive,
but it's a fake.

136
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,087
How can you tell?

137
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,714
See the spelling? Roman.

138
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,424
Doesn't even show up in that era.

139
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,134
Got it.

140
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:19,054
Officers, I figured it out.

141
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:23,517
So, the Da Vinci, that is real.

142
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,611
Now, where did you come from?

143
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,878
What are you?

144
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,505
- It's pretty neat, right?
- Yes.

145
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,674
Where is it from?

146
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,551
They just discovered it in Sudan.

147
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:01,513
The boys say it's Horus,
fifth millennia BC, Nubian?

148
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:04,683
This symbol is
definitely not hieroglyphic.

149
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,394
Well, if it's as exotic as it looks,

150
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,313
I'm gonna get a feature in Minerva.

151
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,107
Jillian?

152
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,320
Okay, team, let's do it.

153
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:35,964
Okay, what are the rules?

154
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,926
Bros before hos.

155
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,640
Don't be a problem.
Don't go looking for a problem.

156
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,767
Or else we're gonna...
have a problem.

157
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,976
I know, I know.

158
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,603
Okay, I'll be back in a little bit.

159
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,111
Mr. Diaz?

160
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:01,740
Hey, I know
we're a little behind on the bill.

161
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,950
Three months behind.

162
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,327
Until your account is current,
you can't bring your brother.

163
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,703
- I've told you that.
- I'm gonna fix it.

164
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,206
- I need a little more time.
- Take him to the ER.

165
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,792
Well, they won't see him in the ER
unless he's critical.

166
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,377
- Mr. Diaz.
- He's 11!

167
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,129
He's 11 years old.

168
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,342
Come on, Kris, we gotta go.

169
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,762
- What happened?
- I'll tell you later, man. All right?

170
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,264
Come on. Let's get out of here.

171
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:30,769
Hey, yo. Sit here.

172
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,189
And don't move!

173
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:38,485
After a conference with
Simpson's attorney, Howard Weitzman...

174
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,653
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

175
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,781
Hey, I'm here for an interview
with the head of security, Mr. Bishop.

176
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,241
I'm Noah Diaz.

177
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,910
- It's been canceled.
- No. No, that has to be a mistake.

178
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,787
Came right from Mr. Bishop.

179
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,833
Just need your authorization...

180
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,668
Mr. Bishop! Hey! Hey!

181
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,170
It's okay, Walker.

182
00:13:57,254 --> 00:14:00,382
It's me, Noah Diaz. Sir, I think
your boy back there is confused.

183
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,759
- He said our interview was canceled.
- Because it is.

184
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:05,804
Wait, why? On the phone,
you said I was perfect for the job.

185
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,055
You said this was just a formality.

186
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,766
It was until your old commanding officer
called me back.

187
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,270
Said you were brave,
an expert comtech, but unreliable.

188
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,730
Couldn't trust you.

189
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,565
Your head was always somewhere else.

190
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:18,191
Sir, I can explain all of that.

191
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,777
I had some responsibilities at home.
My brother, he's sick...

192
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,280
You had a responsibility
to the United States Army.

193
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,407
Mr. Bishop! Sir.

194
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,993
I'm a hard worker, okay?
I just...

195
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:31,288
I just really need a break.

196
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:35,667
Listen, I can't have someone like you
mess up what I've built.

197
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,878
Someone like me?

198
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,135
You don't know anything about me!

199
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,763
I know you don't know
how to be part of a team.

200
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,433
God.

201
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:53,810
Hey, look.

202
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,604
Superman went on a bunch of interviews

203
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,648
before he got his job on the Daily Planet.

204
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,485
- But he never gave up.
- I'm not Superman, Kris.

205
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:02,819
Life ain't a comic book.

206
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:05,363
I'm just saying.
You'll get the next one.

207
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,532
Yo, there is no next one.

208
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,993
No one's coming to save us.
We're alone in this.

209
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:20,337
Yo, man, I'm sorry.

210
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:22,380
It's all right.

211
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:23,673
No, it's not.

212
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:28,678
None of this is.

213
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,521
You know what?

214
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:39,564
Come on.

215
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,902
Yo, here, bro.

216
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,530
Just head upstairs.
I'll be right there, all right?

217
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,203
So what was you talking about earlier?

218
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,307
Hey, yo, you want one?

219
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,601
No. I don't want any candy.

220
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,520
You gotta relax, man.

221
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,605
Your energy is really affecting my chi.

222
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,150
And I get it.
I was nervous my first time too.

223
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:26,069
But you might wanna do some breathing
exercises or something. Look at me.

224
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,244
My man, my man, my man, my man.

225
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,914
It's just I ain't done this before.

226
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,667
I know that.
But them rich cats in there,

227
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,752
they give a ton of paper
to charities every year

228
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,504
to make themselves feel better.

229
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:46,131
If you look at it
from a holistic perspective,

230
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,716
we doing them a favor.

231
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:51,845
- Hey, yo! You're welcome!
- Will you stop?

232
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:52,762
What are you doing?

233
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,557
This ain't about to
affect they pockets at all.

234
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,225
And it's about to be easy as hell.

235
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:59,728
So why you ain't the one
going in there and doing it?

236
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,230
Because, papito, I'm the mastermind.

237
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:05,108
Now come on, put this in your ear.

238
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,861
My man, you serious?
Yo, is that even clean?

239
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,362
It's the fourth quarter,

240
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,531
we got about
ten seconds left on the clock,

241
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,241
and you got the rock.

242
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,452
- Get rid of this.
- Hey, man!

243
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,039
Don't slam the...

244
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:27,589
Okay. I am off to my fundraiser.

245
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,966
- What do you think?
- It's nice.

246
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,762
Can I run something by you?

247
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,975
So I've been doing some research,

248
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,187
and I don't think
that the statuette is Horus.

249
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,314
As a matter of fact, I'm sure it's not.

250
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,067
The boys dated it around 5000 BC, right?

251
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:49,903
But the Nubians,

252
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,863
they never even had contact
with the Egyptians

253
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:53,782
until 600 years after that.

254
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,325
The symbol's not hieroglyphic.

255
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,535
I don't even think
it's from that part of the world.

256
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,746
I think it might be Aztec or Inca.

257
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:04,501
It's not some Egyptian god.
It's something else.

258
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,466
Interesting.

259
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,759
Get those pressed, okay?

260
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,992
Yeah.

261
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:40,578
There you go.
Let that breath fill you up.

262
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,373
In... out.

263
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,250
Please stop talking.

264
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,128
Okay, all right, I get it,
you don't like to chitchat back and forth.

265
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:49,462
But I got something for you.

266
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,677
You got a robbing mixtape?

267
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,761
No.

268
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,222
I got a liberating mixtape.

269
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:13,611
You feeling that, huh?

270
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:14,696
Yeah, whatever.

271
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,331
All right, there shouldn't be
nobody in this part of the building.

272
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,416
You should be able
to just waltz right on in.

273
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,756
Strike one, mastermind.
This place is packed.

274
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,050
Hey, well, to error is divine.

275
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,926
Just act like you own the place.

276
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,928
Hey, wassup, brother?
Good to see you again.

277
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,140
Try not to look suspicious.

278
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:47,604
Here you go. Here you go.
Sorry. Sorry. That's you, bro.

279
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,440
Nice glasses. I didn't know...
I didn't know you had glasses.

280
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,525
What are you doing,
making friends?

281
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,244
- Every thing good?
- We're in the mix.

282
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,877
Hey. Let's see what you really are.

283
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,556
Now, my man said
it's tucked in the back.

284
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,141
Been there a couple weeks.

285
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:27,977
It's like a grayish car

286
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,270
with like a...

287
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:30,688
Blue stripe.

288
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,124
All right, now just
like brother Reek showed you.

289
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:50,333
Down the window...

290
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,044
a little wiggle...

291
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:55,880
feel that snag and...

292
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,550
yeah.

293
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,260
Now we making money.

294
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,870
All right. Talk to me, homey.

295
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:27,996
I'm in.

296
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,289
This won't hurt a bit.

297
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,140
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

298
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,854
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

299
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,029
I'm gonna lose my job.

300
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:04,407
I'm gonna go to jail.

301
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:24,052
It's definitely not Nubian.

302
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:04,133
This cannot be.

303
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:07,178
Calling all Autobots!
Calling all Autobots!

304
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:08,846
Yippee-ki-yay, mother...

305
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,855
Prime, this is Arcee.
I have a visual.

306
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,190
What am I looking at?

307
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:22,110
A way home.

308
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:28,950
Calling all Autobots!

309
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,119
Calling all Autobots!

310
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,084
- What am I doing?
- Well, the coast is clear out here,

311
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,753
so whenever you want to slide
that thing on out, you good.

312
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:42,463
I can't. I can't.

313
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:44,591
Like you can't
drive stick or something?

314
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:47,218
No, it's just... I ain't no thief.

315
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,429
Are you having
an existential crisis now?

316
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,514
The deadline for that was
when I offered you Twizzlers.

317
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,433
This is an emergency.

318
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:55,393
Can you hear me, Mirage?
Rollout!

319
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:56,978
Hey, yo, who the hell was that?

320
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,606
That's the radio, bro.
This car is buggin'. I'm out.

321
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:02,775
Hey!

322
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,611
Shit!

323
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:06,696
- Oh, shit.
- Hey, you!

324
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:10,908
Get out of the car!

325
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:13,995
I'm trying!
The car started by itself, I promise!

326
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,705
- Look, it's not working!
- Get out now!

327
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,382
No! Wait! What you doing?

328
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:27,675
Noah, what's...

329
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:33,348
Reek! Reek! Reek!

330
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:35,224
Now, that's top-tier manifestation!

331
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,353
Yo, the car's driving by itself!

332
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:41,773
Noah, you good?

333
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:43,149
I don't know what's going on!

334
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,400
It won't stop!

335
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,944
Yo, stop! Stop!
Why aren't you listening?

336
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:49,405
- You might wanna slow down.
- It's not me, it's the car!

337
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,074
- It's possessed!
- No, no, no.

338
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,825
You're just on an adrenaline high.

339
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:54,786
Let's do some of them breathing exercises.

340
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,039
Yo, I don't need no breathing exercises!

341
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,415
The car's driving by itself!

342
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:02,877
Oh, snap.

343
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,796
Yo, Reek, what do we do?

344
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:06,798
Noah, I cannot hear you.

345
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,508
- Reek!
- Noah, I can't...

346
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,846
No, he did not!
No, he did not just leave me!

347
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:18,476
- Pull over!
- Help me!

348
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:53,261
Are you ok...

349
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,729
Drive. Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive!

350
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,619
The bridge. The bridge, the bridge...

351
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:19,871
Take the Williamsburg!

352
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,340
I got a 10-37 in progress.
Silver Porsche.

353
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,178
You serious, man?

354
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:42,769
Oh, nah. Oh, nah.

355
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,403
Hell, do something, please!

356
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:08,795
Yo, nah. Nah, nah, nah.

357
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,385
Come in, come in.

358
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,429
- Can you hear me, Mirage?
- Mirage?

359
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:33,444
Mirage.

360
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:56,759
Yo, yo, yo, slow down!
Slow down!

361
00:28:09,662 --> 00:28:11,816
That felt good!

362
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:15,528
Gets the oil pumping, you know?
Damn!

363
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,238
I've been cooped up forever, dude.

364
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,282
I can't tell you how old it gets!

365
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,284
Mirage, stay hidden.

366
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:24,453
Mirage, don't draw
any attention to yourself.

367
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:29,458
Mirage, Big is just a movie.
You'll never be a real boy.

368
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:32,211
But that was fun, man.
You're fun, dude.

369
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:35,798
Oh, right. This is probably
a lot for you, huh?

370
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:38,426
Back up!

371
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,928
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's with the aggression?

372
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:43,014
I thought after the car chase,
we were boys.

373
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:45,349
- Are you gonna hit me?
- Maybe.

374
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:48,644
It's like that?

375
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,733
Tough guy.

376
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:56,569
I like that. I like it a lot.

377
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,321
What are you?

378
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,364
Some sort of possessed car or something?

379
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:02,867
Nah. That's not real, man.

380
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,951
I'm an alien.

381
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:05,995
Like... Like E.T.?

382
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,414
E.T.?
The little ugly guy in the basket?

383
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:11,042
Look at this face!
The name's Mirage.

384
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,463
Come on.
Give me a little, give me a little.

385
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,089
Give me a little. Give a little tap.

386
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,424
Give me a little tap.

387
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,426
There you go.
Now we're friends!

388
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,429
Oh, great. The gang's here.

389
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:26,515
- There are more like you?
- Like me? Nah.

390
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,225
But be cool so they don't crush you.

391
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:30,603
- What?
- I'd put that pipe down if I were you.

392
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:02,677
Well, well, who have we go there?

393
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:08,766
Mirage, what have you done?

394
00:30:10,184 --> 00:30:12,186
You brought a human here?

395
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,855
Optimus! Hey! Looking good, man!

396
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:16,440
Wait a second. Are those new rims?

397
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:18,567
You were told to stay hidden.

398
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,861
Right, right. Crazy coincidence.

399
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:22,947
When you called, all Optimus-like...

400
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,157
Autobots, roll out!

401
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:27,034
This guy was already in the car.

402
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:29,245
But he's cool, so it's cool.
Cool?

403
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,830
Not cool.

404
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,168
Who are you, human?

405
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:38,212
I'm nobody.
I ain't even seen nothing.

406
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,089
I'm not even seeing anything right now.

407
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,757
Arcee.

408
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:47,555
Private Noah Diaz, US Army.

409
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:50,558
Multiple commendations.
A wizard with electronics.

410
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,393
He's a soldier.

411
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,895
He does not look like a soldier.

412
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:57,189
I mean,
you looking pretty rough yourself.

413
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,776
Sorry, sir.

414
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,654
I will deal with your mistake later.

415
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:10,786
Okay, the energy surge
we felt was in the 4,000 yottahertz range,

416
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,747
which is undetectable to humans.

417
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:16,000
I've reconstructed the source
from the energy echoes.

418
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:19,587
I cannot believe it.
It exists and it is here.

419
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,589
What the hell am I looking at?

420
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,215
The Transwarp Key.

421
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,260
It was thought to be lost
thousands of years ago.

422
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:30,556
It was once used
to open space-time portals

423
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,060
to Energon-rich planets
throughout the universe.

424
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:36,395
You mean Energon-rich planets like...

425
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:37,980
Cybertron.

426
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:40,941
After seven long years stranded on Earth,

427
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:43,027
we've finally found a way home.

428
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,945
Wait till I catch you, Reek.

429
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:48,199
Okay, so where is this tran, trun...

430
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:49,617
- Transwarp Key?
- Thank you.

431
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,452
It's in the new museum on Ellis Island.

432
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:54,622
Let's blow it up
and get the hell out of Dodge!

433
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:57,792
No, we can't just go in
blasting and steal it, Bee.

434
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:59,502
The humans will hunt us down.

435
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:02,088
What we need is a quiet way in.

436
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,011
Oh, how about him?

437
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,263
- No.
- What? Come on, man.

438
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:13,849
He could slip in right through
one of them little doors,

439
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:16,477
grab the key, leave a nice IOU
and peace out.

440
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,105
- He's perfect.
- What?

441
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:21,565
No, it is a bad idea.

442
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:23,692
I agree with Big Man.

443
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:26,821
So, it's been real, y'all.
But...

444
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:28,697
- Time-out.
- Mirage.

445
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:31,826
I know. I know. Just relax.
Let me just talk to my guy real quick.

446
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:34,286
Yo, don't leave me
with these tight-asses, bro.

447
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,371
We make a great team.

448
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,331
This is a waste of time.

449
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:40,000
Look, I'm not breaking into a museum
for some space robots.

450
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:42,002
But what about for friendship?

451
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:45,464
Or, or, or...

452
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,883
what about for cash?

453
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:51,846
You help us get this key,
so we can get off this rock...

454
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:54,181
no offense,
love the neighborhood and all...

455
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:56,559
and then I let you sell me.

456
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,686
Lambo?

457
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:00,521
Ferrari?

458
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:02,439
Indy?

459
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:06,735
Look, you get paid and then I'll split.

460
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,821
So all I gotta do is walk in and out?

461
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,282
All you gotta do.
We'll take care of the rest.

462
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:14,076
Cross my spark and hope to die.

463
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,453
That was corny
when I said it out loud.

464
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:21,500
What about the big man?
Optimal, or whatever.

465
00:33:21,584 --> 00:33:23,752
You let me worry about him.

466
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:24,837
Cool?

467
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,592
Got him! He's in, baby!

468
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:58,412
So y'all are robots
that transform into cars,

469
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,581
even though you're from
way out in space.

470
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:03,334
But now there's this key
that opens a portal back to your home?

471
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:06,503
Oh, and you know this
because there's a beacon light in the sky

472
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:08,214
that I can't see because I'm human.

473
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:11,008
- You say that like it's weird.
- It's super weird.

474
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:13,886
You know what's weird?
Marky Mark is leaving the Funky Bunch!

475
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,263
I heard he's just gonna pursue acting now.

476
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:17,473
- That's crazy!
- What?

477
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:19,391
- How does that...
- What a world.

478
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:20,601
Whatever, man.

479
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,353
I'm just trying to collect this money

480
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:25,231
and get your angry-ass boss off of Earth
before he blows a gasket.

481
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:26,982
Don't take it personal.

482
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:28,817
He just misses home.

483
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:32,321
And I think he blames himself
for us getting stuck here.

484
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,531
Earth was supposed
to be a pit stop, you know,

485
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:38,410
a place for us to regroup
and rejoin the war back home.

486
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:40,996
Prime feels like it's his fault
we've been stranded here,

487
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,207
like he has to fix it all on his own.

488
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,126
All right, team, heads up.
There's security up ahead.

489
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,461
Nice!

490
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:48,754
This is gonna be fun, man.

491
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,131
No, no, no. No, bro.
You need to switch it up.

492
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:54,426
You need to turn into a helicopter
or a speedboat or something.

493
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,762
I got something
way better than that.

494
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,443
Good call.

495
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,407
I do not like this plan.

496
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,493
Yeah, Mirage isn't
really known for being quiet.

497
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:21,495
At least Mirage is one of us.

498
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,998
We should not be relying on a human.

499
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:25,332
They are my friends.

500
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:27,584
I know one was good to you, Bee,

501
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:29,503
but this is not our world.

502
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,464
The humans will always protect
what is theirs.

503
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:35,426
We can only trust our own kind.

504
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:37,761
You can't handle the truth!

505
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:41,432
I do not want you going
to that drive-in theater anymore.

506
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,271
Nightbird, search the island.

507
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:34,610
Finally, the hunt draws to a close.

508
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:02,346
Hello?

509
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,864
Fudge.

510
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:29,289
- Hey, are you okay?
- Back up!

511
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:31,417
- Yo, are you okay?
- Back up! Back up! Back up!

512
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,001
I didn't think anyone was in here.

513
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:37,464
That's it.

514
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,387
Who are you?

515
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,721
I'm...

516
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:46,515
the janitor.

517
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:50,144
Security!

518
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:53,188
No, no, no! You don't have to do that!
It's not what it looks like.

519
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:56,275
It looks like you're trying
to steal museum property.

520
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:58,152
Okay, it's a little what it looks like.

521
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,405
Oh, shit.

522
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,490
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, hey, yo, yo!

523
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:05,534
- It doesn't belong to you anyway.
- No, no, no!

524
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:06,702
Just stop! Just...

525
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:10,456
Hey, hey! Relax, relax,
and let me explain.

526
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:11,540
Let me ex...

527
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:13,417
It belongs to...

528
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:16,879
to these...

529
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:23,469
these giant robots from space.

530
00:38:24,178 --> 00:38:25,220
Really?

531
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:26,930
Look, I'm gonna need that.

532
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,392
Da...

533
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:32,269
- Damn!
- Hey!

534
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,813
Hey, hey, hey! What's going on here?
Don't move.

535
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:36,273
Man, it's about time you showed up!

536
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:45,574
The key.

537
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,434
- You were telling the truth.
- Yeah.

538
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:14,728
But those ones aren't with me.

539
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:25,405
Rip the flesh from their bones
and bring me the key.

540
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,411
It's yours.

541
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,882
Guys, we got company!

542
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,017
Autobots, protect the key!

543
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,271
Catch!

544
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:09,783
Not so fast!

545
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:17,624
Oh, they're flying now?
Who the hell are these guys?

546
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:29,970
Impossible!

547
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:32,848
I enjoy that look of confusion

548
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:36,935
when an inferior being
meets a higher power.

549
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:48,697
What the hell are those things?

550
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,949
Are you okay?

551
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:57,122
- Hey! Stop following me!
- I'm not following you!

552
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:59,124
I'm just escaping in the same direction.

553
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,806
<i>We're moving on</i>

554
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:57,724
<i>Keeping strong</i>

555
00:41:57,808 --> 00:42:01,186
<i>Don't you let them
steer you wrong</i>

556
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:04,356
<i>It's a groove thang</i>

557
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:10,737
<i>Gonna give you what you want</i>

558
00:42:10,821 --> 00:42:12,656
<i>Just as long...</i>

559
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:19,788
Run!

560
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,332
Go, go!

561
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,261
Run!

562
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:36,096
Go, go, go, go, go!

563
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,021
Watch out!

564
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:47,983
Thanks.

565
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:57,075
Scourge, I have eyes on the key.

566
00:42:58,827 --> 00:43:01,288
Prime, I don't think
we can hold these guys...

567
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:03,248
Oh, no!

568
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,624
My God! Put me down!

569
00:43:07,419 --> 00:43:10,046
Whoa, that was so scary.

570
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,048
Oh, cool. You're still alive.

571
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:15,594
Get the key!

572
00:43:17,179 --> 00:43:18,346
Noah, get outta here!

573
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:21,892
Get off me! I hate spiders!

574
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:27,147
- Go, go, go!
- Don't die, don't die, don't die!

575
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:32,778
Go! Get out of here!

576
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:42,329
Leaving so soon?

577
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:44,915
Yo! Look out!

578
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:50,587
The key!

579
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:58,762
Enough of these games.
I'll get it myself.

580
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,680
Not on my watch.

581
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,711
Aw, don't be frightened, humans.

582
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:35,006
This'll all be over soon.

583
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:40,095
And you call yourself a Prime.

584
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:43,139
Primus would be ashamed.

585
00:44:56,486 --> 00:45:00,490
I'm tired of little things
getting in my way.

586
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,158
Bee!

587
00:45:03,994 --> 00:45:05,662
O Captain! My Captain!

588
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:07,330
No!

589
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:27,684
Bee.

590
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:36,401
Now to add a Prime to my collection.

591
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:50,332
Maximals.

592
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:53,418
Good.
Maybe we'll get a real fight.

593
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:56,671
No. We got what we came for.

594
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:03,637
No.

595
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:07,891
This cannot be.

596
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,535
We must go now. Come with me.

597
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:56,064
This is my fault.
It should've been me.

598
00:46:57,315 --> 00:46:59,943
I'm sorry for your loss.

599
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:03,029
No offense, lady,
but who are you again?

600
00:47:03,113 --> 00:47:06,491
My name is Airazor.

601
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,410
I am a Maximal.

602
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:11,329
A warrior from both your past
and future.

603
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:14,582
Oh, right.
That... That tracks. Yeah.

604
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:18,628
We fled our home planet
on the eve of its destruction.

605
00:47:18,712 --> 00:47:22,298
We sought refuge and hid here on Earth.

606
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:24,676
Right.
So you're a Maximal. Y'all are Autobots.

607
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,845
What was those things
that attacked us earlier?

608
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:28,054
Terrorcons.

609
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:30,724
Servants of a dark, hungry god

610
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:33,893
who feeds on entire worlds
to sustain himself.

611
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:36,021
Unicron.

612
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:39,733
So you're saying this thing Unicron
eats planets to survive?

613
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:44,112
Yes. And he imbues
his servants, like Scourge,

614
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:49,367
with dark energy,
which makes him all but invincible.

615
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:52,495
He is entirely beholden to Unicron.

616
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:56,916
Through his power,
he possesses Scourge's soul.

617
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,794
Awaken, my dark master.

618
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:20,148
Rise.

619
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:23,109
My hunger is killing me.

620
00:48:23,193 --> 00:48:24,527
What have you found?

621
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:26,696
Salvation.

622
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:31,618
The galaxy will once again
be yours to feast on, my master.

623
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:35,622
I should've gotten the key myself.

624
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:38,208
I should've known better
than to rely on humans.

625
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:40,794
Yo, hold up.
What, you blaming me?

626
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:44,506
After you conveniently left out the part
about a planet-eating monster?

627
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:46,925
Because of you,
Unicron will now use the key

628
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:49,552
to consume every planet
in the universe!

629
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:51,638
Including my home world.

630
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:55,308
He doesn't have the key.
At least not all of it.

631
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:59,145
You fool!

632
00:48:59,229 --> 00:49:02,482
- This is only half the key.
- Please!

633
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:06,653
The Maximals...
They must have split it.

634
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:08,571
Excuses!

635
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:11,533
Complete the key,
or else you will wish you had died

636
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:13,827
with the rest of your planet.

637
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:17,664
We broke the key into two pieces
for safekeeping,

638
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:20,416
then splintered and went into hiding.

639
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,628
I do not know where the other half is.

640
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:28,007
For all I know,
I am the last of our kind.

641
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:30,468
It's in Peru.

642
00:49:30,552 --> 00:49:31,970
How you know that?

643
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:34,013
It's the symbols on the stone.

644
00:49:34,097 --> 00:49:36,808
They were only ever recorded
in one other place in the world.

645
00:49:36,891 --> 00:49:39,727
The Inca Temple of the Sun in Cusco.

646
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:42,188
It's one of the oldest buildings
in the western hemisphere.

647
00:49:42,272 --> 00:49:46,276
I'm... I'm guessing that
that can't be a coincidence.

648
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:50,155
If you can track those symbols to Peru,
so can the Terrorcons.

649
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:51,990
We need to get there before they do.

650
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:57,036
And then kill Scourge
and take his piece to complete the key.

651
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,663
Yo. Hold up. Hold up.

652
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,790
You want to find this other key

653
00:50:00,874 --> 00:50:03,877
and deliver it to the guy
that just kicked your asses.

654
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,171
The Transwarp Key is our only way home.

655
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:09,215
If this dude gets ahold of that thing,
it's game over for Earth!

656
00:50:09,299 --> 00:50:11,342
Our families, everybody!

657
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:16,514
I'm going.

658
00:50:16,598 --> 00:50:17,765
Out of the question.

659
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:20,602
No offense,

660
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:23,730
but I'm not trusting my home to a guy
who couldn't even protect his.

661
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:27,984
This is my planet.
I'm going.

662
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:29,444
What about you?

663
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:35,033
- Me?
- What is your name?

664
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:37,118
Elena.

665
00:50:37,202 --> 00:50:38,745
Elena,

666
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:40,955
will you lead us to this temple?

667
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:46,377
Chance to stop the end of the world.

668
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:48,171
Actually,

669
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:50,590
you'll be saving two worlds.

670
00:50:58,348 --> 00:50:59,557
Yeah.

671
00:51:09,234 --> 00:51:11,653
Yo, is that you, Sonic?

672
00:51:14,364 --> 00:51:15,949
What are you doing up, Tails?

673
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,326
I can't sleep.

674
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:29,754
This too hot?

675
00:51:31,214 --> 00:51:32,840
You playing that game too much.

676
00:51:32,924 --> 00:51:35,051
Give it a rest,
so your hand can take a break.

677
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:36,886
I'm gonna beat it.

678
00:51:39,222 --> 00:51:40,556
My money's on you, bro.

679
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,308
We don't quit.

680
00:51:42,392 --> 00:51:44,143
Come on, get some sleep, all right?

681
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:54,153
Yo, listen,

682
00:51:54,237 --> 00:51:56,489
I gotta...
I gotta head out for a while.

683
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:58,741
And I don't know
when I'm gonna be back.

684
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,451
Why?

685
00:52:02,328 --> 00:52:05,331
Oh, shit.

686
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,005
- What the...
- No, no, no!

687
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:14,257
No! Stop, please!
Turn off! Turn off!

688
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,718
Yo, won't you...
I told you to sit tight.

689
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:18,511
- Stop it.
- I can't turn it off. I'm sorry.

690
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:19,554
Is that a robot?

691
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:22,056
No, no, no. Go... Go back to bed.
Yo, shut it off!

692
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,684
I think your bad hot-wiring skills
messed up my lights.

693
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:26,436
- I got the bat.
- Yo, chill. Give me that.

694
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:29,022
- Did he say bat?
- You're gonna wake up Ma!

695
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:36,529
I know you're a robot.

696
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,032
Kris?

697
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:48,791
Yo! You scratched my paint!

698
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:51,627
What are you doing?

699
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:53,421
Man, they didn't treat E.T.
like this.

700
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,048
- You know this thing?
- Yeah.

701
00:52:55,131 --> 00:52:57,633
We're just work friends.

702
00:52:57,717 --> 00:53:00,636
Work friends?
You've been inside me.

703
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,474
Look, that thing I told you
I have to go do?

704
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:05,850
It's for him and his crew.

705
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,685
We're trying to stop the end of the world.

706
00:53:07,769 --> 00:53:08,936
The world's ending?

707
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,439
- No!
- Maybe. Sixty-forty.

708
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,399
You know I'm not gonna let that happen.

709
00:53:14,067 --> 00:53:15,693
But that's why I have to leave.

710
00:53:19,364 --> 00:53:20,698
I'll go get my things.

711
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:23,326
Tough kid.

712
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:26,120
What? No. Hold up. Hold up.
You're not coming.

713
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:28,164
Why?
You need someone to watch your back.

714
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:30,333
It's too dangerous, Kris.

715
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:34,379
And I need you to stay here
and take care of Mom.

716
00:53:36,756 --> 00:53:38,466
'Cause you might not come back.

717
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:53,773
Hey, robot.

718
00:53:54,816 --> 00:53:57,402
Me? 'Sup?

719
00:53:57,485 --> 00:54:01,155
Watch out for my brother.
Okay?

720
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:03,199
You got it, little man.

721
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:05,159
Nah, I'm serious.

722
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:07,787
If he gets hurt,
I'm coming after you.

723
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:12,917
Don't worry.
I got Noah's back. I promise.

724
00:54:16,963 --> 00:54:18,089
Home team?

725
00:54:21,092 --> 00:54:22,093
Home team.

726
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:28,099
Kid's got heart.

727
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,101
Cojones muy grande.

728
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:43,990
Wu-Tang is in the building, baby!

729
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:46,451
Way to be incognito.

730
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:49,287
Aw, come on, Prime.
Smile a little bit.

731
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,456
It won't hurt.
Let me see that underbite.

732
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:54,625
All right. So what kind of jet
we taking to Peru?

733
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:56,461
Or is it a plane?
Either one's fine.

734
00:54:56,544 --> 00:54:59,172
I just need first class, okay?
'Cause I got long-ass legs.

735
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:01,132
Well, he is a plane.

736
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:02,884
No. No, no. Don't...

737
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,719
Don't tell me we're flying on...

738
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,012
Oh, no.

739
00:55:24,322 --> 00:55:28,868
My lads! I am Stratosphere,
lord of the skies!

740
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:37,877
Yeah, I'm walking to Peru.

741
00:55:44,217 --> 00:55:46,886
<i>Chasing waterfalls</i>

742
00:55:49,305 --> 00:55:50,306
Oh, my gosh.

743
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:53,184
<i>Gonna have it your way</i>

744
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:54,936
<i>Or nothing at all</i>

745
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:58,439
<i>But I think you're moving too fast</i>

746
00:55:59,357 --> 00:56:00,691
Sorry.

747
00:56:00,775 --> 00:56:04,195
I sing when I get nervous.
It usually calms me down.

748
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:05,655
First time flying?

749
00:56:05,738 --> 00:56:08,157
Man, this is my first time
leaving New York.

750
00:56:09,575 --> 00:56:11,994
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

751
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,497
So the Bronx, huh?

752
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,624
Brooklyn, all right?

753
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,334
East New York all day.

754
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:20,378
I'm from Bushwick.

755
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:22,838
Really?

756
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:25,466
Me and my dad,
we used to go to this...

757
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,927
this pizza spot down
on Knickerbocker and Greene.

758
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:30,763
Tony's Pizza?

759
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:37,520
So tell me about him, your pops.

760
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:38,771
What... What was he like?

761
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:42,775
He was a...
He was a cabbie for 40 years.

762
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:45,528
Smartest guy you ever met.

763
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,863
He could talk to you about anything.

764
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:50,533
History, science, cricket.

765
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:52,285
Cricket?

766
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:55,705
And he ain't never
even go to college either.

767
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:57,748
He used to always say,

768
00:56:57,832 --> 00:57:01,419
if you keep your eyes
and your ears open,

769
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:03,754
life will show you
everything you need to know.

770
00:57:06,299 --> 00:57:08,551
So that's why you said
yes to all of this.

771
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:12,054
I figured if he is somewhere watching,

772
00:57:12,138 --> 00:57:15,725
then seeing his daughter
do something crazy like this

773
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:18,477
would definitely make him proud.

774
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:31,115
You really think
this key thing's in Peru?

775
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:32,533
I... I think so.

776
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:34,118
The evidence lines up.

777
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,206
Well, if it is,
and we get our hands on it,

778
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:40,666
then we gotta destroy it.

779
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:41,751
What?

780
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:45,921
They can't unite the key
without both pieces.

781
00:57:46,005 --> 00:57:49,508
No key, no Unicron,
no Earth getting eaten.

782
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:55,181
Yeah, but then they can't get home.

783
00:57:56,724 --> 00:57:58,225
We gotta think about us.

784
00:58:02,355 --> 00:58:04,065
Look, all you gotta do is find it.

785
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:06,359
And I'll take care of the rest.

786
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:13,115
Do you think an Energon infusion
could bring him back?

787
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:15,826
Perhaps.

788
00:58:16,911 --> 00:58:19,413
If we could get him back to Cybertron.

789
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:24,460
I never should have taken us
so far from home.

790
00:59:06,669 --> 00:59:09,088
Wheeljack needs to fix
that power steering.

791
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:13,384
Sorry I'm late.

792
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,261
I was taking in a harmonious moment

793
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:19,056
between a serene butterfly
and an unruffled caterpillar.

794
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:20,808
Such tranquility.

795
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:24,353
- Yo-ho-ho. Oye, papo, where you from?
- Cybertron.

796
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:26,939
- So where'd you get that accent?
- Accent? What accent?

797
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:29,316
You know what I'm saying?
I'm just saying it's cool.

798
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,819
I was about to be like,
yo, mira, papi, de dónde eres?

799
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:35,489
Pero I didn't want to assume
that you speak Spanish too,

800
00:59:35,573 --> 00:59:36,949
because then... Right?

801
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:39,785
A little racist, hermano.

802
00:59:39,869 --> 00:59:41,871
I'm not trying to be, you know...
Yo.

803
00:59:41,954 --> 00:59:45,124
But anyway... The mission.
Follow me.

804
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:47,209
But he's a robot, like, so,

805
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:49,587
how's that racist?

806
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:55,301
Okay, you guys, check this out.

807
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:58,471
The coordinates you gave me
correspond to an old church.

808
00:59:58,554 --> 00:59:59,597
Take a look.

809
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:03,642
That's Santo Domingo.

810
01:00:03,726 --> 01:00:05,770
The Spanish built it
on top of an old Inca temple.

811
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:09,732
Correcto. I picked up some residual
energy readings around the courtyard,

812
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:12,359
so I'm guessing
the key's somewhere close by.

813
01:00:12,443 --> 01:00:14,653
But we may have some trouble
getting there.

814
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:16,113
Inti Raymi.

815
01:00:16,197 --> 01:00:18,991
It's a festival that
shuts down the whole city.

816
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:21,452
- Guess it's a night mission then.
- No.

817
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:23,788
Scourge could already be here.

818
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:27,082
We must retrieve
the other half before he does.

819
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:31,712
Me and Elena will do it.

820
01:00:31,796 --> 01:00:33,547
Y'all would never make it two blocks.

821
01:00:33,631 --> 01:00:35,716
There's human security
all around the church.

822
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,675
You'll never get through.

823
01:00:36,759 --> 01:00:39,470
Then we'll have to take
a play out of your book.

824
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:41,722
We'll hide in plain sight.

825
01:00:41,806 --> 01:00:44,058
We'll blend in with the parade.

826
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:47,019
It is not a bad idea.

827
01:00:47,102 --> 01:00:49,897
We will keep an eye out
for the Terrorcons.

828
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,609
On first sign of trouble,
we are going in.

829
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:55,277
Yo, Noah, think fast.

830
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:03,619
And if you need help, just holler.

831
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,679
I am in position.

832
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:23,639
All right, coast is clear.

833
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:26,308
Noah, Elena, it's go time.

834
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:29,311
Blend in. Act natural.

835
01:02:02,136 --> 01:02:05,014
Autobots must be using
their new pets

836
01:02:05,097 --> 01:02:07,141
to reach the temple.

837
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:09,435
Lovely.

838
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:12,229
They're doing our work for us.

839
01:02:12,313 --> 01:02:14,440
Go fetch.

840
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:21,238
The key's gotta be
in here somewhere.

841
01:02:22,031 --> 01:02:23,032
Yeah.

842
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:39,590
That stonework is 17th century.

843
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:42,718
What we're looking for is something

844
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:46,388
much, much older.

845
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:57,441
- What is it?
- It's the same insignia on Airazor.

846
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,152
But it's not lined up right.

847
01:03:02,905 --> 01:03:04,573
Wait, you see that?

848
01:03:04,657 --> 01:03:09,620
I think there's something
under here.

849
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:14,875
There's another one.

850
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:20,714
There is.

851
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:30,933
Now what?

852
01:03:32,393 --> 01:03:34,645
I thought it would've...

853
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,411
That's some Indiana Jones-type shit.

854
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:53,539
You sure about this?

855
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:55,249
No.

856
01:04:04,133 --> 01:04:06,301
Any sign of Scourge?

857
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:07,636
Nope, all clear here.

858
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,013
Yeah.

859
01:04:09,096 --> 01:04:10,973
It's just groupies over here.

860
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:13,350
Stay on task, Mirage.

861
01:04:13,434 --> 01:04:16,270
Prime, you gotta learn
how to relax, my man.

862
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:42,921
You know, we must be the first people
to walk here in half a millennium.

863
01:04:44,757 --> 01:04:47,176
Yo, Sonic. You dead yet?

864
01:04:48,886 --> 01:04:49,970
No.

865
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,973
Wait, did you just call me Sonic?

866
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:54,433
I think that's a temple.

867
01:05:01,148 --> 01:05:03,150
What are we looking for?

868
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,235
You see the symbols
on that temple?

869
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:07,112
They match the ones in the courtyard.

870
01:05:07,196 --> 01:05:08,614
I think it's up there.

871
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:22,711
I think we found
what we came here for.

872
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,424
I always wondered
what it would feel like to be there

873
01:05:27,508 --> 01:05:29,843
when artifacts were actually found.

874
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:35,224
All right. Now come on, push.

875
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,192
Are you even pushing?

876
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,361
Yeah, I'm pushing.

877
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:00,791
- Wait, what?
- Just... Just let me think.

878
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:02,793
Oh, no, no. Where is it?

879
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:07,005
Sometimes there's, like, a...
like a false bottom or something.

880
01:06:10,509 --> 01:06:11,927
Look.

881
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:14,847
I think I found something.
You see these symbols?

882
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:18,183
I've seen markings like this...
the Airazor statue at my museum.

883
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:19,810
They're new.

884
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:22,437
They're not on the Transwarp Key.

885
01:06:22,521 --> 01:06:23,564
There's two of them.

886
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:34,491
Mirage?

887
01:06:38,829 --> 01:06:41,540
- Let's keep moving.
- Just give me a second.

888
01:06:45,878 --> 01:06:47,296
Run!

889
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:56,555
Go, go, go, go, go!

890
01:06:56,638 --> 01:06:58,724
Mirage! We got trouble!

891
01:06:58,807 --> 01:07:01,685
One of those things is down here!
Where are you guys?

892
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:03,729
Hang tight! I'm on the way.

893
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:07,858
The Autobots are moving.

894
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:10,235
They must have found the key.

895
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:22,915
Come on!

896
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:25,918
Airazor, where are the humans?

897
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:28,837
They're underground,
heading towards the jungle.

898
01:07:46,355 --> 01:07:48,440
Aw, man, they're tailing us!

899
01:07:58,325 --> 01:08:00,285
- Do something!
- What do you want me to do?

900
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:09,878
You had a gun this whole time?

901
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:30,274
Prime, what the hell
are you doing?

902
01:08:30,357 --> 01:08:33,110
I'm going to take back Scourge's key

903
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:36,446
and then take off his head.

904
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,877
Guys!
I could use a little help!

905
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:53,005
Did someone call for backup?

906
01:09:01,388 --> 01:09:02,973
- Brake, brake, brake!
- What?

907
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:05,267
Brake!

908
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:18,572
This is for Bee!

909
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:32,169
Come here.

910
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:33,503
Hold on!

911
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:56,318
I love your fire, Prime.

912
01:09:56,401 --> 01:10:00,155
But you're going to die
on this speck of dust.

913
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:04,034
I can think of no better place
to bury you.

914
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:34,314
I will end you, Scourge.

915
01:10:36,108 --> 01:10:39,694
That is a promise.

916
01:10:39,778 --> 01:10:41,321
They're getting away.

917
01:10:41,405 --> 01:10:43,156
Not this time.

918
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:52,374
I hear water.

919
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,796
Where are we?

920
01:11:04,094 --> 01:11:05,095
What was that?

921
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:20,193
Who are you?

922
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:23,155
And why are you hunting for the key?

923
01:11:23,238 --> 01:11:25,615
Yo, Donkey Kong!
Stay away from my friends!

924
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:28,493
- Mirage?
- Don't worry. Your boy's got this.

925
01:11:31,163 --> 01:11:33,707
Stranger danger! Stranger danger!

926
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:36,334
Hey, hey, hey!

927
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:37,377
Not so fa...

928
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:45,677
Hey! Over here, kitty, kitty.

929
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:49,681
Stand down!

930
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,644
I won't ask a second time.

931
01:11:59,316 --> 01:12:01,443
No! All of you, stop!

932
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:06,698
- Airazor.
- Primal.

933
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:09,784
I thought you were lost.
All of you.

934
01:12:09,868 --> 01:12:13,038
The others... Are they...

935
01:12:13,121 --> 01:12:15,665
I am all that is left.

936
01:12:19,878 --> 01:12:22,547
Prime, these are my fellow Maximals.

937
01:12:22,631 --> 01:12:24,966
Rhinox.

938
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:26,551
Cheetor.

939
01:12:26,635 --> 01:12:28,345
Sorry about scaring you, brother.

940
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:30,388
Scared? Please.

941
01:12:30,472 --> 01:12:31,932
I'm not scared.

942
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:33,517
That's just engine oil.

943
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:38,021
And our leader, Optimus Primal.

944
01:12:38,939 --> 01:12:40,899
Optimus Primal?

945
01:12:40,982 --> 01:12:45,237
Named after you,
the legendary warrior of Cybertron.

946
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,488
It's an honor.

947
01:12:47,948 --> 01:12:51,034
Airazor, I'm happy to see you, old friend.

948
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:54,204
But bringing others here
was not part of our plan.

949
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:56,748
I fear you bring dark tidings.

950
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,042
Scourge has come to Earth.

951
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,877
He's found us.

952
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:03,380
And he has half of the key.

953
01:13:03,463 --> 01:13:06,174
We must find the second piece
before he does.

954
01:13:06,258 --> 01:13:08,093
But it wasn't in the cave.

955
01:13:08,176 --> 01:13:11,137
It was. But we moved it long ago
to keep it safe.

956
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:13,473
Where is it now?

957
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:18,103
Come with me.

958
01:13:26,444 --> 01:13:28,321
That doesn't look so good.

959
01:13:28,405 --> 01:13:31,658
When Scourge touches you,
he leaves a mark.

960
01:13:32,492 --> 01:13:34,494
But I'll be all right.

961
01:13:47,507 --> 01:13:49,467
Hey, back there
you called me Sonic.

962
01:13:49,551 --> 01:13:51,636
Yeah.
Your little bro's got this thing

963
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,431
about using real names
over the airwaves, so...

964
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:56,224
Wait, you been talking to Kris?

965
01:13:56,308 --> 01:13:59,686
He gave me this to keep tabs on you,

966
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:01,187
make sure I'm keeping my promise.

967
01:14:01,271 --> 01:14:02,772
Oh, here.

968
01:14:02,856 --> 01:14:04,899
Next time, include warning labels.

969
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:06,776
Nah, go ahead, keep it.

970
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:09,946
I guess it does look better on me.

971
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:12,574
Just don't ask
what part of my body it came from.

972
01:14:15,452 --> 01:14:17,621
So, who are you?

973
01:14:17,704 --> 01:14:19,748
We Maximals are an advanced race

974
01:14:19,831 --> 01:14:24,002
dedicated to the expansion of life
throughout the universe.

975
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:27,339
We use the Transwarp Key
to visit young worlds.

976
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:31,092
The Nazca Lines,
the Temple at Tikal...

977
01:14:31,176 --> 01:14:32,802
That was you guys, right?

978
01:14:32,886 --> 01:14:34,095
Not us.

979
01:14:34,179 --> 01:14:36,723
We cannot claim credit
for human ingenuity.

980
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:40,226
But you had the key.
Why stay on this world?

981
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:42,771
When Unicron destroyed our world,

982
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:46,608
we took an oath dedicated
to the preservation of life,

983
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,652
no matter the cost.

984
01:14:48,735 --> 01:14:50,945
And Earth has been a safe refuge.

985
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:31,945
This is Amaru.

986
01:15:32,821 --> 01:15:35,699
He and his family
are the last descendants of a tribe

987
01:15:35,782 --> 01:15:38,576
that has watched over us
for hundreds of years.

988
01:15:39,536 --> 01:15:43,623
When we arrived,
they shared their world with us.

989
01:15:43,707 --> 01:15:46,084
And together we protected its people

990
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:48,920
and our secret.

991
01:15:55,593 --> 01:15:57,429
You allied with humans.

992
01:15:58,388 --> 01:16:00,014
We did.

993
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:03,768
If you give us this key,

994
01:16:03,852 --> 01:16:07,939
tomorrow I will light the beacon
and bring Scourge to us.

995
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:12,444
The Maximals have already sacrificed
one home to protect the universe.

996
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:14,863
I won't risk losing another.

997
01:16:14,946 --> 01:16:17,574
As a leader, I know you understand.

998
01:16:42,724 --> 01:16:46,352
He is not the Optimus Prime
I imagined.

999
01:16:46,436 --> 01:16:49,355
Well, he has lost so much.

1000
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:51,357
Many more will perish

1001
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:54,527
if the key falls into the wrong hands.

1002
01:16:54,611 --> 01:16:58,323
If you had another chance
to save our home,

1003
01:16:58,406 --> 01:17:00,158
would you act any differently?

1004
01:17:04,412 --> 01:17:07,540
Optimus, come.
I want to show you something.

1005
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:14,631
Your friend will find peace here.

1006
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:19,052
This is raw Energon.

1007
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:21,095
The valley is rich with it.

1008
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:22,931
Could this revive Bee?

1009
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:27,060
I'm sorry, but in this state,
it is inert.

1010
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:29,729
It would take a great power
to ignite it.

1011
01:17:29,813 --> 01:17:32,690
Greater than anything we have here.

1012
01:17:35,318 --> 01:17:38,363
I see that you are surprised
we entrust the key to them.

1013
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:40,323
Yes, I am.

1014
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:43,201
I've been amongst them a long time now.

1015
01:17:43,284 --> 01:17:46,496
There is more to them than meets the eye.

1016
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:48,498
They are worth saving.

1017
01:18:23,408 --> 01:18:24,909
What if we didn't destroy it?

1018
01:18:27,328 --> 01:18:32,584
Maybe there's another way to...
to save both our homes.

1019
01:18:32,667 --> 01:18:35,712
Elena, I made a lot
of mistakes in my life.

1020
01:18:37,505 --> 01:18:39,007
This is different.

1021
01:18:41,551 --> 01:18:43,261
I can't fail at this.

1022
01:18:44,095 --> 01:18:46,264
I can't let my family down.

1023
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:49,350
You're just like him.
You know that?

1024
01:18:49,434 --> 01:18:50,727
Who?

1025
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:51,978
Optimus.

1026
01:18:53,521 --> 01:18:54,522
I'm serious.

1027
01:18:55,607 --> 01:18:57,734
- He feels it too.
- Feels what?

1028
01:18:58,526 --> 01:19:00,612
Like a beast of burden

1029
01:19:00,695 --> 01:19:04,574
just trying to carry
the weight of the world on his shoulders.

1030
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:09,537
You think he's some...
some general barking orders,

1031
01:19:09,621 --> 01:19:11,873
but when I look at him,

1032
01:19:11,956 --> 01:19:14,834
all I see is a big brother
trying to protect his family.

1033
01:20:12,517 --> 01:20:13,810
Are you okay?

1034
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:21,526
Airazor?

1035
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:25,279
I can feel Scourge!

1036
01:20:25,363 --> 01:20:27,865
He's... in my mind.

1037
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:39,919
Run, Elena!

1038
01:20:42,672 --> 01:20:44,007
No!

1039
01:20:47,635 --> 01:20:50,596
Airazor.

1040
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,056
They found us.

1041
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:55,518
Everyone, defensive positions!

1042
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:58,146
Noah, guard the key.

1043
01:20:58,229 --> 01:21:00,606
Take Elena
and find someplace safe to hide.

1044
01:21:02,942 --> 01:21:04,736
We must protect the humans.

1045
01:21:07,405 --> 01:21:09,198
Miss me?

1046
01:21:09,282 --> 01:21:11,409
Noah, Elena, get out of here!

1047
01:21:28,176 --> 01:21:29,802
We have to destroy it.

1048
01:21:32,096 --> 01:21:33,222
Noah!

1049
01:21:33,306 --> 01:21:34,807
No!

1050
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:37,393
Don't.

1051
01:21:39,896 --> 01:21:43,649
I know you want to protect your people,

1052
01:21:43,733 --> 01:21:46,444
but if you destroy that key,

1053
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:49,405
our home will be lost forever.

1054
01:21:49,489 --> 01:21:51,699
We do not have to choose.

1055
01:21:58,498 --> 01:22:00,291
Please, Noah.

1056
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:20,353
Elena!

1057
01:22:24,732 --> 01:22:25,733
Go!

1058
01:22:47,797 --> 01:22:49,173
Elena!

1059
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:58,099
Wait, wait.
Didn't I kill you already?

1060
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:00,601
No!

1061
01:23:00,685 --> 01:23:03,563
I'm the Maximal
that's going to rip out your spark.

1062
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:06,774
We'll see about that.

1063
01:23:06,858 --> 01:23:07,900
Kill them!

1064
01:23:14,824 --> 01:23:16,033
Airazor, no!

1065
01:23:16,117 --> 01:23:18,995
I can't hold him back...

1066
01:23:19,078 --> 01:23:20,913
much longer.

1067
01:23:20,997 --> 01:23:23,291
Fight it, Airazor.

1068
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:27,295
Remember our oath, Primal.

1069
01:23:27,378 --> 01:23:30,006
No matter the cost.

1070
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:33,634
- I can't hold it back!
- Airazor, no!

1071
01:23:45,396 --> 01:23:46,647
Primal!

1072
01:23:54,113 --> 01:23:57,283
It's okay.

1073
01:23:57,366 --> 01:23:58,784
Do it.

1074
01:24:22,683 --> 01:24:24,268
Primal.

1075
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:27,563
No matter the cost.

1076
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:38,324
Elena! Elena, look at me.

1077
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:40,910
Are you okay?

1078
01:24:43,746 --> 01:24:45,248
Scourge has the key.

1079
01:25:30,001 --> 01:25:34,547
Awaken, almighty Unicron.
Your time has come.

1080
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:39,612
I am sorry, Noah.

1081
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:42,406
You were looking out for your own.

1082
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:47,536
I can't even be angry at you for that.

1083
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:48,954
On my home world,

1084
01:26:49,038 --> 01:26:51,999
we believe that the battle
with darkness will continue

1085
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:54,168
till all are one.

1086
01:26:55,753 --> 01:26:57,755
I lost sight of that.

1087
01:26:57,838 --> 01:27:01,842
You fought for yours
as I fought for mine

1088
01:27:01,926 --> 01:27:05,304
when we should have been
fighting the darkness together.

1089
01:27:09,058 --> 01:27:11,435
Well, I ain't done fighting yet.

1090
01:27:16,148 --> 01:27:18,192
All right, everybody, squad up!

1091
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:19,860
Bring it in.

1092
01:27:19,944 --> 01:27:21,904
There's got to be a way
to stop this dude.

1093
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:26,033
It's too late.
The Transwarp has already been activated.

1094
01:27:26,117 --> 01:27:28,786
It has more energy than a supernova.

1095
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:31,705
Any interruption
will ignite it like a bomb.

1096
01:27:32,873 --> 01:27:34,750
The only way to stop this process

1097
01:27:34,834 --> 01:27:38,129
is an access code
installed long ago as a safeguard.

1098
01:27:38,212 --> 01:27:39,630
Okay, what's the code then?

1099
01:27:39,713 --> 01:27:42,341
The code was split along with the key.

1100
01:27:42,425 --> 01:27:46,595
Sadly, the second half
of that code died with Airazor.

1101
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:48,139
No, wait, wait, wait.
I got it.

1102
01:27:48,222 --> 01:27:50,182
The one hiding her half of the key,

1103
01:27:50,266 --> 01:27:51,434
it had markings in it,

1104
01:27:51,517 --> 01:27:54,103
just like the ones I found in the cave
where you hid yours.

1105
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:57,148
Together, they must complete
the access code.

1106
01:27:58,315 --> 01:28:00,192
So we got a chance now, right?

1107
01:28:00,276 --> 01:28:01,735
A slim chance.

1108
01:28:01,819 --> 01:28:06,282
That is all we need
if you will show us the way, Primal.

1109
01:28:09,368 --> 01:28:12,037
All right.
We need to move quickly.

1110
01:28:12,121 --> 01:28:14,290
We have a small window
before the portal opens

1111
01:28:14,373 --> 01:28:16,125
large enough for Unicron to enter.

1112
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:19,420
The bridge is girded
by a series of tunnels.

1113
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:21,797
They are too small for Maximals,
but...

1114
01:28:21,881 --> 01:28:23,632
But not for humans.

1115
01:28:23,716 --> 01:28:27,386
If Noah and Elena
reach the central antenna,

1116
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:29,889
they can use the code
to shut it down,

1117
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:32,558
remove the Transwarp Key...

1118
01:28:32,641 --> 01:28:36,562
and close the portal
before Unicron enters our atmosphere.

1119
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:38,772
But Scourge will be watching
our every move.

1120
01:28:38,856 --> 01:28:41,275
He'll do anything to stop us
from getting the key.

1121
01:28:41,358 --> 01:28:43,486
Then we bring the fight to him.

1122
01:28:43,569 --> 01:28:48,199
Autobots and Maximals
will charge the bridge together

1123
01:28:48,282 --> 01:28:50,868
and lure Scourge onto the battlefield.

1124
01:28:50,951 --> 01:28:53,746
While me and Elena sneak in
through the back way.

1125
01:28:56,957 --> 01:28:59,168
It sounds like we're all going to die.

1126
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:05,508
If we are to die,
then we will die fighting

1127
01:29:05,591 --> 01:29:07,510
all as one.

1128
01:29:19,772 --> 01:29:23,567
This world is yours, master.

1129
01:29:24,401 --> 01:29:26,278
Scourge,

1130
01:29:26,362 --> 01:29:27,655
they're back.

1131
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:36,747
Prime.

1132
01:29:38,290 --> 01:29:42,211
Protect the key.
Don't let them get to the bridge.

1133
01:30:02,898 --> 01:30:04,149
Maximals!

1134
01:30:04,233 --> 01:30:05,985
Autobots!

1135
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:07,653
Roll out!

1136
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:21,959
Rhinox, Cheetor, maximize!

1137
01:30:45,524 --> 01:30:47,401
At least the foot soldiers
took the bait.

1138
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:49,528
Yeah, but Scourge didn't.
He's guarding the key.

1139
01:30:49,612 --> 01:30:50,446
All right.

1140
01:30:50,529 --> 01:30:53,866
This should lead to the bottom
of the Transwarp control panel.

1141
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:57,244
- Get the key, get the hell out of there.
- What are you gonna do?

1142
01:30:57,328 --> 01:30:59,371
I'm gonna go distract Scourge.

1143
01:30:59,455 --> 01:31:01,123
No, you can't take on Scourge alone.

1144
01:31:01,206 --> 01:31:04,001
Relax. I'm Mirage, remember?

1145
01:31:04,084 --> 01:31:05,085
Hey.

1146
01:31:41,205 --> 01:31:43,374
One, two, three!

1147
01:31:43,457 --> 01:31:45,459
Whoomp! There it is! Pow!

1148
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:47,961
We gotta hurry up.

1149
01:31:53,008 --> 01:31:56,136
Take cover!

1150
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,639
Someone give me a real fight!

1151
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:04,019
It's a fight you want?
You got one.

1152
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:20,577
He was mine.

1153
01:32:21,787 --> 01:32:22,955
Nope!

1154
01:32:23,539 --> 01:32:24,540
Missed me!

1155
01:32:27,334 --> 01:32:29,837
Noah, get to the key.

1156
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:30,838
Mirage!

1157
01:32:31,588 --> 01:32:33,882
What do we have here?

1158
01:32:33,966 --> 01:32:35,884
Elena, go!

1159
01:32:39,138 --> 01:32:43,767
Brave, but futile.

1160
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:49,565
Hey! Don't mess with my boy!

1161
01:33:12,379 --> 01:33:13,630
Mirage.

1162
01:33:19,136 --> 01:33:22,222
No one will remember this pathetic planet.

1163
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:26,685
And no one will remember you.

1164
01:33:30,898 --> 01:33:32,399
Mirage, what are you doing?

1165
01:33:32,483 --> 01:33:34,735
Keeping my promise.

1166
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:37,404
Mirage, no!
Come on, you gotta get up!

1167
01:33:37,488 --> 01:33:39,031
It's okay, Noah.

1168
01:33:44,411 --> 01:33:45,871
Home... Home team.

1169
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:49,541
Home team.

1170
01:33:52,795 --> 01:33:54,463
Mirage!

1171
01:33:57,341 --> 01:33:58,801
Mirage?

1172
01:34:01,053 --> 01:34:03,847
Mirage.

1173
01:34:04,765 --> 01:34:06,642
Kill the other human.

1174
01:34:44,054 --> 01:34:45,722
Unicron.

1175
01:34:45,806 --> 01:34:48,433
You fought bravely.

1176
01:34:48,517 --> 01:34:52,729
But this world is already mine.

1177
01:35:02,072 --> 01:35:03,532
We're too late.

1178
01:35:12,833 --> 01:35:14,418
- Yo!
- Hey!

1179
01:35:16,753 --> 01:35:21,049
Hey! Look!

1180
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:36,273
Hey, Knuckles.

1181
01:35:36,356 --> 01:35:39,234
You there? Over.

1182
01:35:39,318 --> 01:35:40,569
Yo, Sonic.

1183
01:35:41,278 --> 01:35:43,238
- Kris!
- Noah?

1184
01:35:44,031 --> 01:35:45,532
What's going on?

1185
01:35:45,616 --> 01:35:47,159
Where's Mirage?

1186
01:35:47,242 --> 01:35:50,495
He... He's gone.

1187
01:35:50,579 --> 01:35:51,830
Gone?

1188
01:35:53,999 --> 01:35:56,627
No.

1189
01:35:59,212 --> 01:36:00,714
I'm sorry, Kris.

1190
01:36:08,347 --> 01:36:10,349
I'm not gonna win this one.

1191
01:36:11,058 --> 01:36:12,684
But you don't lose, right?

1192
01:36:13,435 --> 01:36:14,811
I wish that were true,

1193
01:36:15,854 --> 01:36:16,855
but I can't.

1194
01:36:23,362 --> 01:36:25,072
Yes, you can.

1195
01:36:26,156 --> 01:36:28,075
No.

1196
01:36:29,826 --> 01:36:32,204
No, man, I'm not you.

1197
01:36:32,287 --> 01:36:33,497
I hate being sick.

1198
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:34,873
Whenever I wanna give up,

1199
01:36:34,957 --> 01:36:37,501
you're always there
telling me to keep going.

1200
01:36:38,251 --> 01:36:39,586
And now it's my turn.

1201
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:41,296
Keep going, Noah.

1202
01:36:43,465 --> 01:36:47,844
You think you're a nobody,
but you're the strongest guy I know.

1203
01:36:47,928 --> 01:36:50,430
You guys are so cute.

1204
01:36:51,181 --> 01:36:52,182
Mirage?

1205
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:54,059
You're alive!

1206
01:36:54,142 --> 01:36:58,897
Yeah, but...
I'm gonna need you to take the wheel.

1207
01:37:10,617 --> 01:37:12,411
You can do this.

1208
01:37:17,124 --> 01:37:18,917
'Cause you're my brother.

1209
01:37:19,001 --> 01:37:21,878
Noah Diaz from Wilson Avenue,

1210
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,632
Apartment2-C, Brooklyn, New York.

1211
01:37:29,177 --> 01:37:31,263
No names over the airwaves.

1212
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:33,390
Forget that.

1213
01:37:33,473 --> 01:37:34,891
Let 'em know who you are.

1214
01:37:39,563 --> 01:37:41,106
Yo, Scourge!

1215
01:37:46,278 --> 01:37:47,779
Remember me?

1216
01:38:08,717 --> 01:38:11,678
You think you can take me on alone?

1217
01:38:14,848 --> 01:38:17,059
He is not alone.

1218
01:39:03,063 --> 01:39:05,065
I'm never leaving Brooklyn again.

1219
01:39:17,536 --> 01:39:20,372
Energon.

1220
01:39:50,068 --> 01:39:51,444
Prime!

1221
01:39:54,156 --> 01:39:55,157
Noah!

1222
01:40:12,299 --> 01:40:15,552
I'm getting really tired of you humans.

1223
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:50,921
Bee!

1224
01:40:55,717 --> 01:40:59,346
You again.
You should've stayed dead!

1225
01:41:21,326 --> 01:41:24,037
I have come here to kick ass.

1226
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:25,413
Glad to have you back.

1227
01:41:25,497 --> 01:41:27,415
Everyone guard the bridge!

1228
01:41:27,499 --> 01:41:30,377
Elena, shut it down!

1229
01:41:36,549 --> 01:41:38,385
We gotta give her some cover!

1230
01:41:38,468 --> 01:41:39,970
We'll clear the way.

1231
01:41:42,973 --> 01:41:44,683
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1232
01:41:45,558 --> 01:41:48,144
Punch in an access code...
How hard could that be?

1233
01:41:51,856 --> 01:41:53,650
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

1234
01:41:59,572 --> 01:42:01,741
Just you and me, Scourge.

1235
01:42:06,288 --> 01:42:10,083
Let's end this once and for all.

1236
01:42:10,166 --> 01:42:12,043
Master, the reinforcements!

1237
01:42:33,398 --> 01:42:34,607
All right, I got this.

1238
01:42:34,691 --> 01:42:35,692
Let's go, Bee!

1239
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:46,328
Say hello to my little friend!

1240
01:43:09,517 --> 01:43:10,852
We gotta hurry!

1241
01:43:11,686 --> 01:43:12,604
Last one.

1242
01:43:13,688 --> 01:43:15,982
Die, you ugly mother...

1243
01:43:52,602 --> 01:43:56,314
You will never see Unicron
take this world.

1244
01:44:03,113 --> 01:44:04,656
You did it!

1245
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:06,199
Brooklyn, baby!

1246
01:44:06,282 --> 01:44:08,284
No!

1247
01:44:08,952 --> 01:44:10,995
Unicron will prevail!

1248
01:44:11,079 --> 01:44:12,539
Elena!

1249
01:44:16,126 --> 01:44:18,128
I've had enough!

1250
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:24,509
Time to show you
the real power of the Prime!

1251
01:44:28,471 --> 01:44:31,558
This belongs to a friend of mine!

1252
01:44:44,612 --> 01:44:45,613
The panel,

1253
01:44:46,489 --> 01:44:47,866
it's destroyed.

1254
01:44:48,741 --> 01:44:50,076
I can't stop it.

1255
01:44:51,536 --> 01:44:53,997
Autobots, Maximals,

1256
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:55,623
retreat to safety.

1257
01:44:55,707 --> 01:44:58,751
I will destroy the key myself.

1258
01:44:58,835 --> 01:45:00,420
Prime! No!

1259
01:45:00,503 --> 01:45:02,046
There's gotta be another way.

1260
01:45:02,130 --> 01:45:03,923
Bee, protect them.

1261
01:45:12,765 --> 01:45:16,519
Your sacrifice becomes our oath.

1262
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:20,064
Thank you, my friends.

1263
01:45:24,444 --> 01:45:27,489
Bee!

1264
01:45:27,572 --> 01:45:29,574
We can't leave him!

1265
01:45:36,164 --> 01:45:38,291
Everyone, on me!

1266
01:45:50,220 --> 01:45:51,846
Don't, Prime.

1267
01:45:51,930 --> 01:45:55,099
I can give you everything you want.

1268
01:45:55,183 --> 01:45:56,559
Then die.

1269
01:46:35,014 --> 01:46:36,015
Noah.

1270
01:46:36,099 --> 01:46:37,475
I got you!

1271
01:46:48,736 --> 01:46:51,364
Let me go, Noah. Save yourself.

1272
01:46:53,533 --> 01:46:55,994
Till all are one.

1273
01:47:16,055 --> 01:47:18,057
Till all are one.

1274
01:47:30,695 --> 01:47:31,904
Punch it, Prime.

1275
01:47:59,515 --> 01:48:00,516
Yeah, baby!

1276
01:48:31,464 --> 01:48:33,966
Unicron... Is he dead?

1277
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:37,178
Trapped, but not dead.

1278
01:48:37,261 --> 01:48:39,681
Evil can never be vanquished completely.

1279
01:48:40,765 --> 01:48:42,141
He could return.

1280
01:48:42,225 --> 01:48:44,227
Let him come.

1281
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:47,271
United, we will destroy him,

1282
01:48:47,355 --> 01:48:49,357
once and for all.

1283
01:48:53,236 --> 01:48:55,405
I am Optimus Prime,

1284
01:48:55,488 --> 01:48:57,365
leader of the Autobots.

1285
01:48:58,282 --> 01:49:00,535
We have lost the Transwarp Key

1286
01:49:00,618 --> 01:49:03,621
and with it,
our ability to go home.

1287
01:49:06,708 --> 01:49:09,127
But we have gained an ally

1288
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:12,463
in our battle against
the forces of evil.

1289
01:49:12,547 --> 01:49:14,841
Forces too powerful

1290
01:49:14,924 --> 01:49:18,469
for any of us to defeat on our own.

1291
01:49:18,553 --> 01:49:22,557
But together,
we might just have a chance.

1292
01:49:31,858 --> 01:49:34,026
I am Noah Diaz.

1293
01:49:35,153 --> 01:49:36,446
What is there to know about me?

1294
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:38,865
I was raised out in Brooklyn.

1295
01:49:39,949 --> 01:49:42,201
I got a little bro who calls me Sonic.

1296
01:49:42,285 --> 01:49:45,538
And if I gotta help save the universe
in order to save the people I love,

1297
01:49:45,621 --> 01:49:47,540
well, then that's what I'm gonna do.

1298
01:50:18,321 --> 01:50:19,489
How you doing, sir?

1299
01:50:19,572 --> 01:50:21,908
I'm here for the job interview?

1300
01:50:21,991 --> 01:50:23,201
Noah Diaz.

1301
01:50:23,284 --> 01:50:24,786
I'll tell 'em you're here.

1302
01:50:26,996 --> 01:50:28,706
This Sunday on 60 Minutes,

1303
01:50:28,790 --> 01:50:31,626
is it down to talk with Elena Wallace.

1304
01:50:31,709 --> 01:50:34,462
She recently discovered
an underground temple

1305
01:50:34,545 --> 01:50:36,589
with a network of catacombs...

1306
01:50:36,672 --> 01:50:39,425
dating back to 5000 BC.

1307
01:50:39,509 --> 01:50:43,095
I never could've imagined
making a discovery of this significance.

1308
01:50:43,179 --> 01:50:45,848
So it's definitely a dream come true.

1309
01:50:47,308 --> 01:50:48,726
Brooklyn, baby.

1310
01:50:48,810 --> 01:50:50,853
They're ready for you.

1311
01:50:50,937 --> 01:50:52,855
- Thank you, sir.
- Elevator in the back.

1312
01:50:58,027 --> 01:51:00,196
Why don't you tell me
about your strengths?

1313
01:51:00,279 --> 01:51:02,490
In addition to my experience
with electronics,

1314
01:51:02,573 --> 01:51:06,202
I've also been really developing
my team-building skills too.

1315
01:51:07,954 --> 01:51:09,288
Is that so?

1316
01:51:09,372 --> 01:51:12,542
Look, I'm gonna be honest with you.

1317
01:51:12,625 --> 01:51:15,002
Résumé's a little thin.

1318
01:51:15,086 --> 01:51:17,713
Yeah, well,
I just recently had a job

1319
01:51:18,464 --> 01:51:20,508
working internationally.

1320
01:51:20,591 --> 01:51:21,926
Oh, was that...

1321
01:51:23,970 --> 01:51:26,097
No, don't think it's on here.

1322
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:28,850
No, it was...
it was a short-term contract.

1323
01:51:28,933 --> 01:51:31,644
Oh, well, that's cool.

1324
01:51:31,727 --> 01:51:33,354
Why don't you tell me about that?

1325
01:51:36,816 --> 01:51:40,528
It was in South America.
So I got to work on my Spanish.

1326
01:51:40,611 --> 01:51:42,113
My mom was real happy about that.

1327
01:51:42,196 --> 01:51:44,490
You know what I'm saying?
You know moms.

1328
01:51:44,574 --> 01:51:47,326
She's just really...
But while I was out there, honestly, man,

1329
01:51:47,410 --> 01:51:50,329
it was really just like
work, work, work, you know?

1330
01:51:51,497 --> 01:51:54,166
That's a shame, because I hear
the food is really good in Peru.

1331
01:51:56,752 --> 01:51:59,171
Wait, I didn't... I didn't
mention anything about Peru.

1332
01:51:59,255 --> 01:52:01,507
Well, that's where you were, right?

1333
01:52:01,591 --> 01:52:03,968
- I was...
- Down in Cusco?

1334
01:52:04,051 --> 01:52:06,888
With you and Elena

1335
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:11,267
and your, I don't know,
call 'em friends?

1336
01:52:14,854 --> 01:52:15,855
What...

1337
01:52:16,814 --> 01:52:18,691
What's going on in here?

1338
01:52:18,774 --> 01:52:21,193
We know a lot about you, Mr. Diaz.

1339
01:52:21,277 --> 01:52:24,780
Who are you?
The CIA or FBI or...

1340
01:52:24,864 --> 01:52:27,825
We are a secret government organization.

1341
01:52:27,909 --> 01:52:29,577
Strictly off the books.

1342
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:31,412
We specialize in global threats.

1343
01:52:31,495 --> 01:52:34,415
Planetary loss prevention,
that kind of thing.

1344
01:52:34,498 --> 01:52:37,627
We're in the middle of an ongoing war,

1345
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:39,795
and we'd love to have you join the fight.

1346
01:52:39,879 --> 01:52:41,714
You and your whole team.

1347
01:52:42,423 --> 01:52:43,424
You know,

1348
01:52:44,967 --> 01:52:45,968
the big guys.

1349
01:52:46,052 --> 01:52:48,054
No idea what you're talking about.

1350
01:52:49,805 --> 01:52:51,515
That's a good answer.

1351
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:52,975
All right.

1352
01:52:53,059 --> 01:52:55,686
Either way, I want you to know,

1353
01:52:55,770 --> 01:52:58,105
in lieu of the thanks
of a grateful nation,

1354
01:52:58,189 --> 01:53:01,192
we will be taking care of
your brother Kris's health care.

1355
01:53:01,275 --> 01:53:02,276
All of it.

1356
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:05,112
From now on,
he will have 24/7 access

1357
01:53:05,196 --> 01:53:07,281
to the greatest doctors in the world.

1358
01:53:07,365 --> 01:53:10,743
And these are doctors who don't ask
their patients about account balances.

1359
01:53:15,706 --> 01:53:16,999
Are you serious?

1360
01:53:17,083 --> 01:53:19,919
You saved the world, kid.
It's the least we can do.

1361
01:53:20,002 --> 01:53:21,629
I don't know what to say.

1362
01:53:21,712 --> 01:53:23,506
We'll work on that.

1363
01:53:25,174 --> 01:53:27,093
Your brother's gonna be just fine.

1364
01:53:34,517 --> 01:53:36,352
Kris was right, by the way.

1365
01:53:45,903 --> 01:53:47,446
No names over the airwaves.

1366
01:53:50,199 --> 01:53:51,617
We could really use
someone like you, Noah.

1367
01:53:51,701 --> 01:53:53,995
Why don't you think about it?

1368
01:54:16,308 --> 01:54:17,643
G.I. Joe?

1369
01:54:55,222 --> 01:54:58,642
Come on, baby, show me some.
Show me some.

1370
01:54:58,726 --> 01:55:00,102
That oughta do it.

1371
01:55:00,186 --> 01:55:03,898
This?

1372
01:55:03,981 --> 01:55:07,693
This is a complete waste of
your skills and my expertise.

1373
01:55:07,777 --> 01:55:09,361
Think it came out pretty good.

1374
01:55:10,780 --> 01:55:13,240
Well, I guess we could call it modern art

1375
01:55:13,324 --> 01:55:15,493
and sell it to some cats in So Ho.

1376
01:55:15,576 --> 01:55:16,744
Nah, I'm not selling.

1377
01:55:16,827 --> 01:55:17,828
What?

1378
01:55:18,579 --> 01:55:19,580
Why?

1379
01:55:20,998 --> 01:55:22,583
Is this about the 5-0 thing?

1380
01:55:23,626 --> 01:55:26,295
No. I told you,
I did not ditch you!

1381
01:55:26,378 --> 01:55:29,048
I was running the give-and-go.
I thought you knew the play!

1382
01:55:29,131 --> 01:55:32,426
All right, let's say I did ditch you,
even though I didn't.

1383
01:55:32,510 --> 01:55:34,929
For your sake... I see your face...
let's just say I did.

1384
01:55:35,012 --> 01:55:37,139
I think all the blood,
sweat and dead presidents

1385
01:55:37,223 --> 01:55:40,434
I put into getting these car parts for you
make us even steven.

1386
01:55:40,518 --> 01:55:42,353
It's not that.

1387
01:55:42,436 --> 01:55:44,271
This car is special.

1388
01:55:44,355 --> 01:55:47,775
This car is a jigsaw puzzle
made of garbage!

1389
01:55:47,858 --> 01:55:52,196
Hey, I bet the joint don't even start.

1390
01:55:54,782 --> 01:55:55,866
Bet?

1391
01:55:57,284 --> 01:55:58,619
Yo, Mirage.

1392
01:56:09,672 --> 01:56:13,175
Yeah! Your boy is back!

1393
01:56:13,259 --> 01:56:15,511
This dude said
I wasn't even gonna start!
