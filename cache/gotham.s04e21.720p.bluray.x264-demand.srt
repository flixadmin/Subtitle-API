1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,459
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:04,535
<i>What's your record for</i>

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,747
<i>how many banks
you've robbed in one day?</i>

4
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,833
<i>You can't take ownership
of everyone's problems.</i>

5
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:11,213
<i>We all have our flaws.</i>

6
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,010
But you're still breaking the law.

7
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,093
<i>I want you to throw me a wake.</i>

8
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,344
<i>Dig me up!</i>

9
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,851
<i>I will liberate Lee Thompkins
with surgical precision.</i>

10
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:25,598
Dead or alive.

11
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,228
Jerome uses distractions.

12
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,400
Got a plan for that?

13
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,023
Bruce?

14
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,274
Jeremiah?

15
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,946
Oh, God, no. He's still alive.

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,657
<i>Jerome is dead.</i>

17
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:41,782
<i>Long live me.</i>

18
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,286
I could not have done any of this

19
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,998
<i>without your help.</i>

20
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:48,125
<i>Those generators that we built</i>

21
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,215
<i>work even better as bombs.</i>

22
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,559
<i>Sources tell us Captain James Gordon
was at the scene</i>

23
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,762
<i>and is missing and feared dead.</i>

24
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,063
<i>Investigators are certainly looking into</i>

25
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,482
<i>what could've caused
the sudden explosion.</i>

26
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,188
Harvey.

27
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,271
I just got off the phone
with Search and Rescue,

28
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,448
whatever blew Jeremiah's bunker
was catastrophic.

29
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:16,650
There are no signs of life.

30
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,779
Tell them to keep looking.

31
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,953
- Harvey, I think...
- Listen, Jim found his way out.

32
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,075
Understand?

33
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,578
<i>Gotham City Police Department has
dispatched an investigative unit,</i>

34
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,159
<i>which is currently canvasing the area,</i>

35
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,666
<i>looking for any traces
of Captain Gordon.</i>

36
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,496
Screw that. And screw her.

37
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,627
Listen, in two minutes,

38
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,674
Jim Gordon's gonna come
walking through that door

39
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,171
and chew all your asses out

40
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,595
for standing around
and not doing your job.

41
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,339
Now, first responders are on the scene,

42
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,299
I want CSIs out there pronto.

43
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:45,433
And I want everyone looking for
Jeremiah Valeska and Bruce Wayne.

44
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,390
That's who Jim was looking for
when this whole thing went blooey.

45
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,270
- You ain't the captain.
- The captain ain't here.

46
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,521
I'm ranking detective.

47
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,730
Last time we followed you,
the Pyg slaughtered us.

48
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:01,578
All right, look, enough.
Jim trusts him, okay?

49
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,746
So, everybody get back to work.

50
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,409
Harvey.

51
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,248
Jeremiah Valeska wasn't inside
the bunker when it blew.

52
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,583
How do you know?

53
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,133
'Cause he's outside,
and he's not alone.

54
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,429
What the hell?

55
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,472
You might not recognize
Jerome's followers as I've given them

56
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,803
something of a makeover.

57
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:30,015
But I assure you they're as loyal
to me as they ever were to him.

58
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,443
More so, 'cause I accomplished
something my brother never could.

59
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,938
Killing James Gordon.

60
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,399
- Jeremiah! Jeremiah!
- You're a liar.

61
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,907
Not so fast.

62
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,704
I have bombs planted around this city.

63
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,704
Just like the one
that killed Jim Gordon.

64
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,036
Jeremiah! Jeremiah!

65
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:56,549
All you need to know is,
if I hit this detonator,

66
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,842
Gotham's blown back to the Stone Age.

67
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,757
If I pull this trigger,

68
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,011
your brains are blown
through the back of your skull.

69
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,304
Dead man's switch. You're familiar.

70
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:11,640
It's another little something
I took from my brother,

71
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,146
except mine is a bit more advanced.

72
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:17,354
You shoot me, my thumb loosens,

73
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:21,657
and then boom, boom, boom.

74
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,076
Boom.

75
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,949
Now, if you won't do what I say...

76
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,288
You're more sick than your brother.

77
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,751
Don't compare me to that
shortsighted psychopath.

78
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,795
He just wanted to destroy things.

79
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,964
Me, I'm a builder.

80
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,667
I'm going to create
a new Gotham in my image.

81
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,629
But every artist
needs a blank canvas.

82
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,007
So, all of this has to go.

83
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,847
I detonate the explosives
in six hours,

84
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,724
I want this city empty when I do.

85
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,183
You need us to evacuate Gotham
in six hours? That's impossible.

86
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,189
Then everyone who dies screaming,

87
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:00,147
who watches their loved ones
crushed before them

88
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,357
will have you to thank,
Detective Bullock.

89
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,026
Look,

90
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,112
nobody has to die.

91
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,457
Well, except for these people.

92
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,919
I know seeing is believing,
and I do want you to believe me.

93
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,121
So...

94
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,547
Oh, my God.

95
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,339
Get officers on the scene now! Go!

96
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,719
Six hours, Detective.

97
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,230
The clock is ticking.

98
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,319
Shame. I liked the clock tower.

99
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:52,365
Jim took me there on a date once.
Now they're both up in smoke.

100
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,625
Good riddance.

101
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,668
He always did want to die a hero.

102
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,917
And that was Jim's problem.

103
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,425
Me, I'd rather live.

104
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,387
And live well.

105
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,805
If it isn't little Penguin.

106
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,049
Oh, and Butch's corpse.

107
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,644
- Hey, Tabby.
- Butch.

108
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,685
The man responsible for the recent
fireworks is Jeremiah Valeska.

109
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,732
Twin brother of our old associate.

110
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,613
He has plans for Gotham.

111
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:28,113
Plans we learned about,
courtesy of this gentleman.

112
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,783
They ripped out my fingernails.

113
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,115
I believe that this is a golden
opportunity for cash and glory.

114
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,668
Normally, I would keep
both of them for myself,

115
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:42,499
but I find myself a bit short
of the necessary manpower.

116
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,669
- Or woman-power, if you will.
- Hmm.

117
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,301
I'll go 50/50 on the take.

118
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,975
An alliance with you. I'll pass.

119
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,769
Pity. With the money
we were going to make,

120
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,724
I'd hoped to finally be able to
cure Butch of his condition.

121
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,436
Wait, what do you mean?

122
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,364
Hugo Strange ran Indian Hill.

123
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,905
Indian Hill's toxic sludge
turned Butch into this.

124
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:13,909
Hugo Strange can fix Butch,
but it won't be cheap.

125
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,033
Strange might be my only hope, Tabby.

126
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,040
Don't look at me like that.

127
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,593
I almost got killed fighting
your ex-boyfriend's rotting corpse.

128
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,261
I think it's time to return the favor.

129
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,047
Fine.

130
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,305
But swamp boy keeps his funk
ten feet from me at all times.

131
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,219
What did you have in mind?

132
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,610
Evacuate this city in six hours?

133
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,653
Five and a half hours.
And it will happen,

134
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,824
because this maniac has
bombs hidden all over Gotham.

135
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,526
Think of how many lives are at stake.

136
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,284
And every minute you hesitate
means fewer people get to safety.

137
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,991
- We'll need police.
- We are police!

138
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,373
We're here to help. Harper,
please, will you help the mayor?

139
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,829
You got it.

140
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,666
Holy Mother of God. Bruce Wayne.

141
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:06,999
Hey.

142
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,461
Bruce, are you okay?

143
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,342
I'm fine. I heard about Jim.

144
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,882
- Is it true?
- As far as I'm concerned,

145
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,389
Jim Gordon is alive, kicking,
and waiting for us to find him.

146
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,062
Detective, don't lie to me.

147
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,731
It's not looking good, kid.

148
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,484
I was hoping you could help me.

149
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,653
Did you see Jim?
How did you get out of the bunker?

150
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,196
Jeremiah and I had
already left the bunker.

151
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,070
Jerome sprayed him with a gas
that drove him insane.

152
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,776
I'm so sick of that freaking family.

153
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,829
Did you hear about
Gotham Clock Tower? Huh?

154
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,747
This guy's got these massive...

155
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,950
- It's my fault.
- What?

156
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,961
Jeremiah had plans to create
next-generation generators.

157
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:47,748
I funded him.

158
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,298
Wayne Enterprises built those bombs?

159
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,508
Listen,

160
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,638
the schematics for the battery

161
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,515
should be in the Wayne Enterprises
R&D lab.

162
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,515
Lucius can take a look at them and
figure out how to disarm the bombs.

163
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,349
- I'm going to go get them now.
- No, you're going home.

164
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,560
- No, I have to do this.
- Look, I know you feel guilty,

165
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:11,694
but Jim Gordon was...
Is important to all of us.

166
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,239
And it's my job. So, go home,
be with Alfred, be safe.

167
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,035
It's what Jim would want.

168
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,038
Lucius.

169
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,207
Alfred, where have you been?

170
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,087
<i>No, not Alfred.</i>

171
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,174
I hope you didn't
catch a cold in my brother's grave.

172
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,382
I know those things aren't
exactly designed for the living.

173
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,092
What have you done? Where's Alfred?

174
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,979
Such anger.

175
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,103
Some people, not me, of course,

176
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,277
might consider that ingratitude
considering all I've done for you.

177
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,480
<i>All I'm still doing for you.</i>

178
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:53,860
You mean lying to me?

179
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,575
Using my company to build bombs?
Trying to kill me?

180
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,529
Bruce, let's get something straight.

181
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,073
If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

182
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,033
I'd have put a bullet through your brain

183
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,335
and left you to rot in that grave.

184
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,288
But I meant what I said.

185
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,550
You're my best friend. And today,
I'm going to prove it to you.

186
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:17,889
You are insane.
And you killed Jim Gordon.

187
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,474
<i>And if you don't want
your man-servant to die, too,</i>

188
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,768
<i>you will follow
my instructions to the letter.</i>

189
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,521
71 Welling Avenue,
be there in an hour.

190
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,223
Tell the police and I'll know.

191
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,567
Just like I know
that's where you are right now.

192
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,395
Well, well,

193
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,406
Jim Gordon, back from the dead.

194
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,206
Where am I?

195
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,291
The Narrows.

196
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,713
I was in Jeremiah's bunker.
There was a bomb.

197
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,085
Ed had you followed.

198
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,459
His people found you after the blast.

199
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,670
I'll have to thank him
when I arrest him.

200
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,852
I'm surprised you didn't kill me.

201
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,849
I am, too, actually.

202
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,435
What do you plan to do with me?

203
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,361
I don't really know.

204
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,524
Lee, I have to get back to the GCPD.

205
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,404
Jerome's brother Jeremiah...

206
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,451
Blew up the Gotham Clock Tower
about an hour ago.

207
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,450
The city's being evacuated.

208
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,783
I have to...

209
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:10,868
It's just a painkiller.

210
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,209
Does make you easier to handle.
You're not going anywhere.

211
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,887
My jacket... In my jacket.

212
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,971
I got those from Jeremiah's office.

213
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,936
They may give us
some clue as to what he's planning.

214
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,272
Please, let me take them to Harvey.

215
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,449
Oh, Jim, you still think you're
the only one who can save this city.

216
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,569
- Wait.
- Get some rest.

217
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,410
Doctor's orders.

218
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:59,341
Jeremiah's followers must have taken
Alfred while I was at the cemetery.

219
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,960
I bet he put up a fight.

220
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,763
Thanks again for meeting me, Selina.

221
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,636
- Sure.
- I didn't have anyone else to call.

222
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,467
I know it's asking a lot.
So I just really appreciate...

223
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,850
Bruce, I'm going to be here
whenever you need me.

224
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,858
Okay, that's the address.

225
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,110
I don't see anyone though.
That could be a trap, right?

226
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,190
I don't know.

227
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,239
Jeremiah could have killed me
at the cemetery.

228
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,821
He wants something out of me.

229
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,781
Like what? To be your best friend?

230
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,997
Trap or not, if Alfred's in there,
I need to find out.

231
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,903
Alfred?

232
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,446
Alfred! Alfred!

233
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,501
Alfred!

234
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,966
You want to help Jim Gordon?
Have you lost your mind?

235
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,465
You brought him here because
you thought it would give us leverage

236
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,764
- with the GCPD.
- Yes, by holding him hostage.

237
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,467
This drawing is the key
to Valeska's plan.

238
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:35,100
We solve it, and we trade
the information for clemency.

239
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,521
Perhaps.

240
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:42,483
Or, perhaps there's
something more going on.

241
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,111
What happened between Jim and I is over.

242
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,081
I'm trying to protect
what we've built.

243
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:58,873
I still like my plan better.

244
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,920
Ed, if this maniac
levels half the city,

245
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,421
it's going to disrupt food
distribution, water supply, power.

246
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,467
The people of The Narrows
will suffer the most.

247
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,887
We can prevent that,
while at the same time

248
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,465
helping us out of this mess we're in.

249
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,094
Please.

250
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:19,598
Fine.

251
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,061
If this is what you want,

252
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,064
I will do it.

253
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,908
For you.

254
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,411
Do it for us.

255
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,587
<i>After the mayor's
evacuation orders,</i>

256
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,543
<i>the new Trigate Bridge
is absolute bedlam...</i>

257
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:49,924
Where are we at
with the evac?

258
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,550
Bridges and tunnels
are bumper to bumper.

259
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,382
National Guard is
bringing in the choppers.

260
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,219
Look, we're talking about evacuating
hospitals, nursing homes, jails.

261
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,678
Some people just don't want to leave.

262
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,934
<i>We are seeing
the same levels of panic</i>

263
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,231
<i>on every bridge
and tunnel out of Gotham.</i>

264
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,058
God, what a mess.
Just make it happen.

265
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,394
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

266
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,735
I got the schematics from
Wayne Enterprises R&D.

267
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,987
The Wayne kid said
the bombs were batteries.

268
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,694
A series of network
self-perpetuating generators.

269
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,121
But when supercharged,
they contain enough energy

270
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,243
to level a city block.

271
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,869
Got it, battery bombs from hell.

272
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,452
Just tell me this will
help us find and disable them.

273
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,580
Disable, yes. Find, no. But...

274
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:30,927
Look. Look here. Because they were
created to be networked together,

275
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:32,588
Jeremiah would have to send a signal.

276
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,140
A centrally-located core relay
in order to blow all the bombs

277
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,014
- from a single detonator.
- Lucius, just English, please.

278
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,892
Sorry, the bombs are connected
by a nervous system.

279
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,816
The core relay is the brain.
We find that, we destroy that.

280
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,437
We can stop the bombs from going off.

281
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,645
- Yes.
- But how do we find it?

282
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,980
How do we find this brain?

283
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:05,126
Oh, Bruce, you are about to have
a very transformative experience.

284
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,336
I envy you.

285
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,224
Call our friends.

286
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:21,095
Tell them to kill the butler.
He is no longer necessary.

287
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,185
Oswald Cobblepot.

288
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,900
Barbara Kean.

289
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,903
In my stronghold.

290
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:38,328
Not one step closer, Mr. Valeska.

291
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,620
And is that my dear Jongleur
with my core relay in his hand

292
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,417
and a grenade taped to his mouth?

293
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,707
Indeed, it is.

294
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,371
Huh.

295
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:53,336
Well, it seems you have
the upper hand.

296
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,379
Undoubtedly.

297
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,097
And now,

298
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,469
we have our own demands.

299
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:12,317
$50 million. That's what you want?

300
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,198
It's a nice, round number.

301
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,118
I don't quite have that
on me right now.

302
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,413
You gave the mayor
six hours to evacuate Gotham.

303
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,991
An impossible task.

304
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:27,578
Let him buy another hour.
He will save thousands of lives.

305
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,084
$50 million will seem cheap.

306
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:34,589
I see. I play the villain,
you get away scot-free and rich.

307
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,718
I get you the money,
you give me back my core relay.

308
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,760
That is usually
how a hand-off works, yeah.

309
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,598
You drive a hard bargain,
but I'll see what I can do.

310
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,980
Just like that?
After knowing your brother,

311
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,686
I expected something more...

312
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,941
Insane?

313
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:58,113
I'm nothing if not sane and reasonable.

314
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,861
Two things my brother never valued.

315
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,618
That's why I'll be successful
where he failed.

316
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:09,124
Well, that and being
vastly more intelligent.

317
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,548
Now, to see about your money.

318
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,419
This is Jeremiah Valeska.

319
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,464
I'd like to speak to the mayor.
I have additional demands.

320
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,382
Yes, really.

321
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,355
50 million, unmarked bills.
I'll tell you the location.

322
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,852
We're not going to just
hand this thing over

323
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,353
and let him destroy Gotham, are we?

324
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,730
Of course not.

325
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,062
Once we get the money,
we kill Jeremiah and his people,

326
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,148
give the core relay to the police,

327
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,450
split the 50 million and are
hailed as the heroes of Gotham.

328
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,696
And we cure Butch.

329
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,451
And that, certainly.

330
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,703
Would you believe it?

331
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,831
They put me on hold.

332
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,715
Well, there's always plan number two.

333
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,917
Get down!

334
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,437
Are you out of your mind?

335
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,484
Why do you keep insisting I'm insane?

336
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,525
What's insane about having
a backup plan,

337
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:22,075
something Jongleur never knew about.

338
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,571
And, so you know, this building
is within the blast radius.

339
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,156
And because of your interference,

340
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,457
I'm going to detonate the bombs
as soon as I'm far enough away

341
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,250
to observe the destruction in peace.

342
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,209
No, you promised the city six hours!

343
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:36,506
Whose fault is it
that I changed my mind?

344
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,510
Tell our men to rewire the bombs
to work in direct sequence,

345
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:44,590
and the rest of you, kill these idiots.

346
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,518
Alfred?

347
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,729
<i>Hello, Bruce.</i>

348
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,685
Jeremiah?

349
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:00,944
<i>I imagine you're wondering,
"Why is Jeremiah doing this?"</i>

350
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,447
<i>My brother once said, "All it takes
is one bad day to reduce</i>

351
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,779
<i>"the sanest man alive to lunacy."</i>

352
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,335
<i>Jerome gave me what I thought
was the worst day of my life.</i>

353
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,583
<i>But only by losing everything</i>

354
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,419
<i>was I able to face
what was inside me.</i>

355
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:22,879
<i>And I believe I've seen something
very special inside of you as well.</i>

356
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,088
Alfred.

357
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,099
<i>But to free it,
you'll have to lose everything</i>

358
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,973
<i>and everyone you hold dear.</i>

359
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,564
<i>I instructed Scarecrow
to mix up something exceptional.</i>

360
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,400
No!

361
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:50,497
<i>Your butler is going
to show you the path ahead.</i>

362
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,714
<i>Now, watch closely.</i>

363
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,299
No! Alfred!

364
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,849
Hello, sleepyhead. You do realize
the city's about to be blown up.

365
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,683
It's an odd time for a nap.

366
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,778
- You know that she drugged me.
- Yeah, don't really care.

367
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,025
Thank you, gentlemen.

368
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,735
I want to make one thing very clear.

369
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,788
If Gotham becomes a rock pile,
I mind zero percent.

370
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:35,618
I'm only helping you
because I'm with Lee now.

371
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,619
Fine, whatever.

372
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:42,383
Feign nonchalance. It's very cute.
It's almost convincing.

373
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:45,586
Ed, Jeremiah Valeska is threatening
to destroy half the city.

374
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,887
You really think I care
if you've deluded yourself

375
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,384
into thinking
you and Lee are a couple?

376
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:51,725
You see?

377
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,635
That is my point.

378
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,308
You don't believe that
Lee could actually love me, do you?

379
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,731
Honestly? No.

380
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,849
Hmm.

381
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,776
You're a psychopath and a murderer.

382
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:05,856
And the fact that you need me
to validate your crazy fantasy

383
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,532
means that
you don't believe it either.

384
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:08,825
That doesn't matter.

385
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,699
What matters is stopping Jeremiah
from killing thousands of people.

386
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:12,825
So, can we...

387
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,744
Yeah, we're going to settle this.

388
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,167
- Ed...
- No, Jim!

389
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,789
This isn't the GCPD.

390
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,245
Here, I make the rules.

391
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,455
So, we're not going to do this

392
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,085
until we talk about
what I want to talk about.

393
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,918
Lee's changed. I accept that.

394
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,672
Maybe she will never be
the person that I knew. Fine.

395
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,633
But she is not who you think she is.

396
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,560
The fact that she is with you
in whatever way she's with you...

397
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:40,016
Oh, Jim, she's with me in every way.

398
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,687
Means that
she wants something from you.

399
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,782
So, when it's done,
she'll get rid of you.

400
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,447
So, you're saying that she
wouldn't be with a killer and yet,

401
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,415
she was with you.

402
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:02,500
And you, Jim, are 10 times
the killer that I ever was.

403
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,965
You have a point.

404
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,177
Maybe that's why she's not with me now.

405
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,848
Can we do this?

406
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:17,552
Why not?

407
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,351
Just try to keep up.
I'll speak slowly.

408
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:24,108
So most labyrinths
are constructed as contiguous lines

409
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,026
along concentric circles.

410
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,775
One way in, one way out.

411
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,106
But this one's different.

412
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:30,691
Undoubtedly.

413
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,700
Those red rectangles,

414
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,536
they're unbound on one side,

415
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:39,120
and they overlap black lines which
would lead out of the labyrinth.

416
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,917
So maybe we're not looking at plans,

417
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,078
but the end result.

418
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,999
<i>Voilà.</i> Look familiar?

419
00:23:56,393 --> 00:24:00,433
So, this is Wayne Enterprises.

420
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,138
This would be Gotham Central Bank.

421
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,193
These are the buildings Jeremiah's
planning to demolish with his bombs.

422
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,396
Once those buildings are blown,

423
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,606
they collapse and create

424
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,110
the labyrinth
from the finished drawing.

425
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,909
Jeremiah lived his entire life
in a maze.

426
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:17,954
Now he's trying to remake the city
into the place he feels most safe.

427
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,906
It's actually rather elegant.

428
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:23,210
- I need to get to the GCPD.
- No, sorry.

429
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,753
You're not going anywhere until
we get this information to the mayor.

430
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:29,583
Lee and I have some
legal knots we need untangled.

431
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,219
Yeah, before we spend
the rest of our lives together.

432
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,589
So you're going to use this
to hold the city hostage?

433
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:36,719
Time is running out.

434
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,552
Well, then the mayor would be wise to
forgive Lee and I our indiscretions.

435
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:42,721
Ed. Wait.

436
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,848
There's one thing I can't figure out.

437
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,186
One, be a little kind to yourself.

438
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,610
Yeah, I'm sorry, I think
you made a mistake right there.

439
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,281
Where?

440
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,036
"Get the core relay," he says.

441
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,292
"Have the upper hand," he says.

442
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,004
Finally.

443
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,430
Let's get the hell out of here

444
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,803
before Jeremiah
blows us all to smithereens.

445
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,014
This is all your fault, Oswald.

446
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,221
- You better...
- Fix it! I know!

447
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,526
- What?
<i>- Harvey...</i>

448
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,274
Is this Oswald?

449
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,906
I'm, uh, kind of busy.

450
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,858
I have information
regarding Jeremiah Valeska's plan.

451
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,369
<i>What information?</i>

452
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,074
Wait a second, is that gunfire?

453
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:42,281
<i>Just listen!</i>

454
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,286
Jeremiah is not honoring the six hours.

455
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,583
He will blow the bombs

456
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,582
<i>as soon as he can watch
the catastrophe from a safe distance.</i>

457
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,001
Jeremiah said something
about rewiring the bombs

458
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,207
<i>to communicate with each other.</i>

459
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:54,213
<i>He called it a direct sequence.</i>

460
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:55,669
Communicate with each other.

461
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,421
<i>Harvey...</i>

462
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,968
Harvey!

463
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:03,177
It's a backup system from when
they operated as batteries.

464
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,636
That means we can disrupt them

465
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,562
by disarming the first bomb
in the sequence.

466
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,311
It's like removing one light
from a string of Christmas lights.

467
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,063
If only we knew where the bombs were.

468
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:12,314
He's back. Hey!

469
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,568
Jim! Oh!

470
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,696
Oh, buddy!

471
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:23,162
All right, easy there, big fella.
Remember, I just got blown up.

472
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,456
- How did you get out of the bunker?
- It's a long story,

473
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,283
but what matters is,

474
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,420
I have the locations of
every bomb Jeremiah planted.

475
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,720
<i>Alfred?</i>

476
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,553
<i>Alfred?</i>

477
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,354
<i>Alfred?</i>

478
00:26:58,992 --> 00:26:59,982
<i>Alfred?</i>

479
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:07,787
Jeremiah said Bruce Wayne
might try to bring his friends.

480
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,290
I suppose you're one of them.

481
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,793
What? No, I just wandered in here.

482
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:18,752
I think our little experiment is
about to get much more interesting.

483
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,176
Jeremiah wasn't bluffing.

484
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,475
There's at least
a dozen bombs on this map.

485
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,769
But you're saying, if we disarm
one of them in the sequence,

486
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:29,562
we'll stop all of them
from going off.

487
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,015
And according to this,
the closest one is just a mile away.

488
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:33,225
I need to look at the schematics

489
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,604
to determine the best way
to neutralize them.

490
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:37,187
Alert the bomb squad.
Tell them to meet me there.

491
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,821
Wait, Harvey.

492
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,864
Let the bomb squad handle this.
You don't have to go.

493
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,654
Yes, I do.

494
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,528
I need this, Jim.

495
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,363
Yeah.

496
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:18,107
It doesn't matter. The experiment
is nearing it's conclusion.

497
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:21,110
Your friend will soon be driven mad.

498
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,141
No!

499
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,436
Alfred.

500
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,985
Alfred, please. Please, stop.

501
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,995
Alfred!

502
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,787
Alfred! Alfred, stop.

503
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,081
Alfred!

504
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,466
Just stop, Alfred. Please.

505
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,440
What the...

506
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:34,663
Come on, Brucey, give me a smile.

507
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:36,624
Smile.

508
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:38,459
Alfred, listen to me.

509
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,496
You can beat this!
You can fight this!

510
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,841
Alfred, you're stronger than him!

511
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,429
Do not let him win!

512
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:57,345
No.

513
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:02,855
- No! Alfred! Alfred! Alfred!
- Bruce, Bruce. Bruce.

514
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,401
Breathe. Look at me.

515
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:07,026
Scarecrow was just
pumping his fear gas in here.

516
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,532
You were only seeing
what he wanted you to.

517
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:18,075
- No, no, no.
- No, Bruce. Bruce. Bruce.

518
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,415
Bruce! Bruce,
listen. Listen to me.

519
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:24,088
Listen, look at me now. Look at me.

520
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,545
Just look at me.

521
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:32,471
Look, I'm fine. It's me.

522
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,058
It's Alfred.

523
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,683
Alfred?

524
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,024
Alfred?

525
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,662
Hey, I'm at the site.
Where the hell is the bomb squad?

526
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,081
The evacuation's jamming the streets.
They're still en route.

527
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,450
I can't wait. I've got to go in.

528
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,203
Do you see the bomb?

529
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,164
I don't know what
it's supposed to look like,

530
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,751
but I think it is exactly
what I'm staring at.

531
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,085
Oh.

532
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,212
Lucius, we've got to do this thing.

533
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,889
- Harvey...
<i>- Listen, we can't wait.</i>

534
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:18,514
We don't know when Jeremiah's
going to set this thing off.

535
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,307
Then you're going to
have to unscrew the antenna

536
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,606
- to activate the kill switch.
<i>- Okay.</i>

537
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,148
Uh...

538
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,358
Lucius,

539
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,364
<i>it's making some kind of weird noise.</i>

540
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:36,444
What kind of a noise?

541
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:40,452
A bad one, and it's getting all glowy.

542
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,330
Then, you are going
to have to work quickly.

543
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,461
<i>Okay.</i>

544
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,546
Jeremiah! Jeremiah!

545
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:01,136
All my life I spent by myself,
hidden away.

546
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:08,022
I am so glad to be sharing
this happy moment with all of you.

547
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,734
Today marks the dawning
of a new Gotham City.

548
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:17,576
One where we will all be free.

549
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,614
Now,

550
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,501
shall I do the honors?

551
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:30,457
<i>Once you unscrew the antenna,
a kill-switch breaker should pop out.</i>

552
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,918
<i>Destroying it should stop the signal
from the detonator to all the bombs.</i>

553
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,134
Which breaker is it?

554
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,012
What the...
What do you mean, which breaker?

555
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,471
<i>There are two of them.</i>

556
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,057
Jeremiah must have changed them
since making these schematics.

557
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,110
- Okay, I'll break both of them.
<i>- No, wait. Harvey,</i>

558
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,313
one of the breakers could be
the super-charged fail-safe.

559
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:54,942
Whatever you do,
do not touch that one.

560
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,901
- Or?
- Or all the bombs will blow.

561
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,736
Lucius, they're identical.

562
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,371
Then, Harvey, I don't know.

563
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,033
<i>We interrupt this program...</i>

564
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,289
- That's Jim Gordon.
- He's not dead.

565
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,461
What?

566
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,586
<i>This is a message to
the followers of Jeremiah Valeska.</i>

567
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,592
<i>Jeremiah claims to have killed me.</i>

568
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,638
<i>Well, bad news, I'm alive.</i>

569
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,266
No. No, it's a trick.

570
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:23,388
I killed him.

571
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,937
<i>So, just know,
you're worshiping a fraud.</i>

572
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,391
<i>A pale imitation of Jerome.</i>

573
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:33,353
<i>You did your worst, Jeremiah.
And I'm still here.</i>

574
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,773
- You lied to us.
- Gordon's alive.

575
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,278
Doesn't matter whether he's alive.

576
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,696
When I hit this switch,

577
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,828
you'll hear the sounds
of a new world being born.

578
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,878
Oh, for the love of God.

579
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,131
Our world.

580
00:34:56,428 --> 00:35:00,047
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo,
which of you will make it blow?

581
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,427
Now, listen.

582
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,829
- He's a liar! Liar!
- He's a fake!

583
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,705
Shut up!

584
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,056
I want you all to know

585
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:53,357
I find your fickleness

586
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,268
quite hurtful.

587
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:02,026
And more so, very predictable.

588
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,204
- Jeremiah!
- Jeremiah!

589
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,467
Well, that is disappointing.

590
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,013
You know, if you had asked me
this morning

591
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,845
how many people I was gonna kill today,

592
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,729
I would have been way off.

593
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,020
Perhaps the outcome
was not what we had hoped,

594
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,478
- but it was worth the risk.
- Ozzy,

595
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,735
if I were you, I would limp
out of here while you still can.

596
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,107
Fine.

597
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,242
- Let's go, Butch.
- Nope.

598
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,535
I'm done.

599
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,615
Ever since we teamed up,
everything's gone to crap.

600
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,371
Hell, we don't even know
where Strange is.

601
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,079
Except, I do know where Strange is.

602
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,831
You mean to tell me you've
known where he is the whole time

603
00:36:58,925 --> 00:36:59,915
and never told me?

604
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:03,468
- I just got word.
- No more excuses.

605
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,638
He fixes me now!

606
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,558
And how exactly do we pay him?

607
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,143
I can be very persuasive.

608
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:19,068
Think, think, think.

609
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,941
How did they beat you, huh?

610
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,231
How did they figure you out?

611
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,071
Gordon must have stolen
the blueprints to the maze,

612
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,449
found one of the bombs,
and sabotaged the sequence.

613
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:33,874
I'll have to start again.

614
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,921
You're tenacious. I like that.

615
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:43,801
Who are you? What do you want?

616
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,804
I had a vision of Gotham in flames.

617
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,221
Together we can make that happen.

618
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,303
Well, I appreciate the offer,

619
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,725
but recent events have convinced me
of the benefits of working alone.

620
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,357
Don't be so rash.

621
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:06,236
Your dream of a new Gotham
will come to be, with my help.

622
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:13,410
You're behind me, aren't you?

623
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,827
I can conquer Gotham on my own.

624
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,754
What makes you think I need your help?

625
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,503
Whoever you are.

626
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:25,050
Because, my boy,

627
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:29,471
all this is not just about Gotham.

628
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:35,557
This is about Bruce Wayne.

629
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,617
You here to arrest me?

630
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:53,612
To thank you.

631
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,082
And to present you with an offer.

632
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:58,867
Leave Gotham.

633
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,958
Start a new life somewhere else.
Alone.

634
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:09,720
And if I don't?

635
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,853
I know we can't change the past.

636
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:21,682
What we've done...

637
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:24,393
We've done to each other.

638
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,528
I can't pretend to recognize
the person I see before me.

639
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,203
But whatever happens
after I walk out that door,

640
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:42,119
I care about you.

641
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,746
And I always will.

642
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,113
Lucius, call the mayor.

643
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,115
Tell him not to lift
the evacuation order

644
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,322
until all the bombs
are under lock and key.

645
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:22,706
And I want every cop out there
to keep looking for Jeremiah Valeska.

646
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,167
What?

647
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,505
Give it up for Harvey Bullock.

648
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,687
Give it up.

649
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,731
Dude, come on.

650
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:54,867
Thank you. No, come on.

651
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:09,131
Right. Well, I'm going to take
a very long and a very hot shower.

652
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,254
And then I'm going to make us
a legendary fry-up.

653
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:13,131
Will you be joining us, Miss Kyle?

654
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:17,181
- I've got no plans.
- Excellent.

655
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,057
You all right, mate?

656
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:27,103
Okay, then.

657
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,322
Thank you again.

658
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,750
I don't know what would have
happened if you weren't there.

659
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,065
You're welcome.

660
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:18,075
Why do you think
he's so obsessed with you?

661
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:23,740
Jeremiah said, "All it takes is one
bad day to drive a person insane."

662
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:32,256
I wonder if my parents dying
made me a little insane?

663
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,344
Maybe he sensed that.

664
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,714
Maybe he wanted to bring it out.

665
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,430
Well, you proved him wrong.

666
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,932
To be fair,

667
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,394
the day's not over yet.
