1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,343
Who sleeps standing up?

2
00:00:12,836 --> 00:00:14,008
You know, you'd be really proud of me.

3
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:16,097
I didn't even blink
when I told him to go fuck himself.

4
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:19,847
- You did just then, though.
- This does not count. I'm not in the moment.

5
00:00:20,468 --> 00:00:22,141
I don't know, maybe I suck in bed.

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,563
Trust me, you don't suck in bed.

7
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:26,190
- Thank you.
- So needy.

8
00:00:26,307 --> 00:00:27,934
Hey, maybe the guy's married or something.

9
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:29,860
No, did a background check at work.

10
00:00:29,978 --> 00:00:33,073
Single, no criminal history,
credit report 720.

11
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:34,782
Background check. Did you do one on me?

12
00:00:34,858 --> 00:00:37,077
How could you possibly
max out an Old Navy card?

13
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:39,366
After college I was
really into cargo pants.

14
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:42,915
Dylan, I gotta stop thinking it's not me.

15
00:00:43,032 --> 00:00:45,285
- I mean, it's gotta be me.
- It's not you.

16
00:00:45,368 --> 00:00:46,620
Nothing is wrong with you.

17
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:48,705
He's a guy.
You gave him a five-date challenge,

18
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,208
he got you and cutout. Forget the douche.

19
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:53,755
He's a dick. He's a dick-douche.

20
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:56,421
Go have fun with your mom.

21
00:00:56,921 --> 00:01:00,095
- Okay.
- Almost forgot. I got you something.

22
00:01:07,724 --> 00:01:10,398
It's Lieutenant Kali,
the street artist we talked about.

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,063
I got him to do something for you.
"F-tale." Fairytale.

24
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,904
- I know you're into that girly shit, so...
- This is so cool.

25
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:19,994
Dylan, that's actually really sweet.

26
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:22,071
- It's cool, right?
- Yeah. Thank you.

27
00:01:23,907 --> 00:01:25,580
Hey, I'm gonna need to borrow cab fare.

28
00:01:26,743 --> 00:01:28,916
I'm not taking that thing on the subway.
I don't wanna get rolled.

29
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:30,129
No problem.

30
00:01:30,246 --> 00:01:32,248
As long as you get your feet off my bed.
They're disgusting.

31
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:35,634
What are you doing?

32
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:37,049
Why are you doing that?
Why are you doing that?

33
00:01:37,587 --> 00:01:39,464
You're an animal. Stop doing that.
An animal. Stop.

34
00:01:43,593 --> 00:01:45,061
Hey, Ma.

35
00:01:46,387 --> 00:01:48,810
Ma. Come on, we gotta get on the road.

36
00:01:49,265 --> 00:01:50,608
Come on.

37
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:52,147
Ma?

38
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:12,664
Why did I think that
this time would be any different?

39
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:14,416
- Come with me to LA.
- What?

40
00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:17,218
What else are you gonna do?
It's 4th of July, everybody's left the city.

41
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:19,045
You're very sweet for
asking, but it's fine.

42
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:20,801
You know what, I'll just stay here.
I'll be fine alone.

43
00:02:20,922 --> 00:02:23,141
I know you'll be fine alone.
You're not a baby in a hot car.

44
00:02:24,133 --> 00:02:25,976
I'm actually asking you to come
because it would help me.

45
00:02:26,302 --> 00:02:28,020
You'd be a great distraction for my family.

46
00:02:28,137 --> 00:02:30,310
They'd forget all about
drilling me for being single.

47
00:02:30,473 --> 00:02:31,645
Won't they think that we're together?

48
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:33,814
- Not if I tell them we're not.
- And they'll believe you?

49
00:02:33,935 --> 00:02:36,313
Yeah, we're one of these crazy families
that doesn't lie to each other.

50
00:02:36,437 --> 00:02:37,780
PBS is doing a documentary on us.

51
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:39,028
Come on, they'll love you.

52
00:02:39,148 --> 00:02:41,617
All fast-talking and brusque,
like I'm bringing home a carny.

53
00:02:41,693 --> 00:02:44,788
You're really nice to ask,
but I'm just gonna stay here.

54
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:46,114
Go to the gym.

55
00:02:46,364 --> 00:02:49,288
I just got you a ticket with my miles,
it's done. Meet me at JFK.

56
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:50,789
- But...
- No buts.

57
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:53,712
- Like you were gonna go to the gym.
- I wasn't.

58
00:03:07,176 --> 00:03:08,803
LA's so nice.

59
00:03:09,387 --> 00:03:11,230
And everyone's so genuine and level-headed.

60
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:15,853
Thanks for this. You're good peeps.

61
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,646
You're the good peeps, dude.

62
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:20,357
You haven't met my family.
You don't know what you're in for.

63
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,322
Okay.

64
00:03:23,568 --> 00:03:25,411
You know these planes
pretty much land themselves?

65
00:03:25,528 --> 00:03:28,407
Nobody cares. You sound like an asshole.

66
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:31,243
She's from New York.

67
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:32,710
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,677
Wow. This looks normal.

69
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:47,009
It is.

70
00:03:47,884 --> 00:03:49,010
Thank you.

71
00:03:53,222 --> 00:03:55,099
Wow, you grew up here?

72
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:57,727
It was my grandfather's.

73
00:03:57,894 --> 00:03:59,521
He bought it
when there was nothing else here.

74
00:03:59,687 --> 00:04:01,906
My dad and my sister
and her son live here now.

75
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:05,235
Why would you move to New York?

76
00:04:05,401 --> 00:04:06,903
I was conned by some headhunter.

77
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:09,573
- You're here.
- Sammy!

78
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:10,740
Hey, Uncle Dylan.

79
00:04:10,907 --> 00:04:12,124
What's up, buddy?

80
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:14,168
How are you?

81
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:16,962
Jamie, this is my nephew,
Sam the Magnificent.

82
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:19,833
- Hello.
- May I offer you a light for your cigarette?

83
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,589
I'm sorry, I don't smoke.

84
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,507
Just pretend. He's a magician.

85
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:26,465
Of course I'll have a cigarette.
Smoking is great for you.

86
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,139
- Wow. Thank you, good sir.
- My pleasure, my lady.

87
00:04:35,056 --> 00:04:36,399
Oh, my God. I got it, I got it.

88
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:38,647
Sammy. I got it, I got it.
Just stay still. I got it, I got it.

89
00:04:38,768 --> 00:04:40,395
Sammy! Are you okay?

90
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:41,730
All part of the illusion.

91
00:04:41,813 --> 00:04:43,440
- Jet Skis later?
- Definitely.

92
00:04:44,482 --> 00:04:45,699
Still into magic, huh?

93
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:48,949
Yep. But I'll take that over him
sexting his friends any day.

94
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:51,998
- Dilbert!
- Banannie.

95
00:04:53,324 --> 00:04:55,827
Jamie, this is my sister, Annie.

96
00:04:55,952 --> 00:04:57,374
- Hi.
- Thank you for having me.

97
00:04:57,453 --> 00:04:59,421
Oh, please.
It's nice to have Dylan bring a girl home.

98
00:04:59,497 --> 00:05:01,090
- We're just friends.
- Oh, no, I know.

99
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:03,338
If you were his girlfriend,
he never would've brought you here.

100
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:06,133
- This one has intimacy issues.
- I know.

101
00:05:06,295 --> 00:05:07,342
- Dylan.
- Dad.

102
00:05:07,463 --> 00:05:09,090
- Dylan. Oh, man.
- Hey.

103
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:11,551
- How you doing, buddy?
- I'm good.

104
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:13,602
I miss you guys, but I'm good.

105
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:16,018
Dede Spencer?

106
00:05:16,472 --> 00:05:18,349
Jamie. Dylan's friend.

107
00:05:20,518 --> 00:05:22,270
- I'm sorry. I...
- That's okay.

108
00:05:22,353 --> 00:05:24,321
No, for a minute you reminded me
of a girl I used to know.

109
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,824
- No, that's okay. It happens.
- Nice to meet you.

110
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:29,035
Pleasure meeting you.
You have a beautiful house.

111
00:05:29,152 --> 00:05:30,153
Thank you.

112
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:33,619
Pool's a little cold,
but it's very expensive to heat, so...

113
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:36,659
I think I'm gonna goin
and check the tide tables

114
00:05:36,784 --> 00:05:38,377
'cause I'm gonna take the boat out
early in the morning.

115
00:05:38,494 --> 00:05:39,996
- You should come.
- I would love to.

116
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:41,714
We sold the boat.

117
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:43,833
The doctor doesn't want you
driving the boat any more.

118
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:48,004
- Turning to mush.
- No.

119
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,849
It's good to see you, buddy.

120
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:53,635
- Nice to meet you.
- It was nice meeting you, too.

121
00:05:53,718 --> 00:05:55,470
- Jamie. See?
- Yes.

122
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:03,319
- What's with the pants?
- He doesn't like them any more.

123
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,362
He's getting worse.

124
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,482
It's so good to have you here.

125
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:09,738
Go show her the beach.

126
00:06:11,194 --> 00:06:13,242
- Let me show you the beach. Come on.
- Okay.

127
00:06:13,362 --> 00:06:16,206
- Go, get sandy. Get all messed up.
- Okay.

128
00:06:31,756 --> 00:06:33,804
Dylan never told me about your dad.

129
00:06:33,883 --> 00:06:36,602
Yeah, it's been tough on him.
They were real close.

130
00:06:37,261 --> 00:06:39,138
Dylan doesn't quite know
how to deal with the Alzheimer's.

131
00:06:39,222 --> 00:06:40,439
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:40,556 --> 00:06:43,150
He'll be his regular old self
and everything seems fine,

133
00:06:43,226 --> 00:06:45,900
and then just in a flash, he's gone.

134
00:06:47,855 --> 00:06:50,358
- That's Dylan when he was nine.
- Are those braids?

135
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:53,236
He was going through a Kris Kross phase.
Remember them?

136
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:01,452
- Is that your mom?
- No, that's Dylan's speech therapist.

137
00:07:02,578 --> 00:07:05,548
He had a stutter.
It got real bad when he was nervous.

138
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,258
He had a rough childhood.

139
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:10,420
- His math tutor called it "character-building."
- Math tutor?

140
00:07:10,545 --> 00:07:14,391
No, we're talking, like,
8 times 6 equals 1,200.

141
00:07:14,465 --> 00:07:16,559
But he's very visual, thank God.

142
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:21,307
- Can you please explain to me this photo?
- That is my 12th-birthday surprise party.

143
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,478
- Hey.
- Amazing moment.

144
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,317
I'm exhausted. I'm gonna go to bed.

145
00:07:25,434 --> 00:07:28,483
- Jamie, you all good with your room?
- Yeah. No, it's perfect.

146
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:30,648
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

147
00:07:35,444 --> 00:07:38,664
Sammy and I built a saw-a-girl-in-half box,
so just be careful on your way to bed.

148
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:41,910
- He's not using a real saw, is he?
- Of course he is. He's magnificent.

149
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,789
I'll make sure he brushes his teeth,
and you, don't believe anything she says.

150
00:07:45,913 --> 00:07:47,415
She's a liar.

151
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:50,926
- He's a pretty special guy.
- Yeah, I think so.

152
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:55,639
- Jamie. Hey.
- Hey.

153
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:57,137
- You up?
- Yeah. Come in.

154
00:08:00,094 --> 00:08:01,892
- I thought you were going to bed.
- I was.

155
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:04,645
But then I realized
we were both single again, so...

156
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:09,979
- Dude, no.
- Why not?

157
00:08:10,104 --> 00:08:11,981
I washed my hands. With soap this time.

158
00:08:12,148 --> 00:08:14,025
Are you serious?
Why would you just assume?

159
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:17,866
You cracked your neck on the porch.
This thing. That's your tell, remember?

160
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:21,329
I cracked my neck
because we were on a flight for six hours,

161
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:24,870
and you were yapping my ear off
about how planes all fly themselves,

162
00:08:24,994 --> 00:08:26,496
and it actually kinked my neck a bit.

163
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:29,340
- So, no?
- No. Not having sex with you.

164
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:31,710
Is it your special time?
They have an app for that. No, wait.

165
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,638
- Nope, you're good to go.
- We talked about this.

166
00:08:36,714 --> 00:08:39,388
- Plus, I just got dumped, so...
- Okay, I'm sorry.

167
00:08:39,508 --> 00:08:41,806
I thought this would be a good way
to take your mind off him.

168
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:44,014
No, I don't function that way.
Sex is not gonna help.

169
00:08:44,472 --> 00:08:46,600
But you know what will? Emotional support.

170
00:08:46,682 --> 00:08:49,561
Before we were sex without emotion,
and now we're emotion without sex.

171
00:08:49,685 --> 00:08:51,107
Exactly.

172
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:53,030
I just need you to be my friend right now.

173
00:08:53,147 --> 00:08:55,195
Okay. So I'll listen to you
while you give me a hand job.

174
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:57,827
- No.
- I'm kidding. I got it. Good night.

175
00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:02,074
Wait, hold on! Friends can still hang out
and, I don't know, listen to music.

176
00:09:02,323 --> 00:09:03,370
Listen to music?

177
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:06,535
I'm gonna kill Annie.

178
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,374
- I can't believe you used to like them.
- I didn't like these guys.

179
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:11,545
I don't even remember...

180
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,564
And then there's something,
I don't know what he says right there...

181
00:09:29,058 --> 00:09:31,607
Are you kidding me?
These dudes were da bomb.

182
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:33,604
Everybody had Girbauds,
we all wore them backwards.

183
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:34,730
The baseball jerseys.

184
00:09:36,565 --> 00:09:38,567
I went as Kris Kross
three years in a row for Halloween.

185
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:40,866
- Oh, you poor kid.
- I'm not proud of it.

186
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:44,742
Hey, I borrowed one of your books.
I hope that's okay.

187
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:49,582
Like this.

188
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,086
No.

189
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,925
Surprise!

190
00:10:06,637 --> 00:10:09,937
Have you really never brought
a girl home before?

191
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:11,939
I brought you here.

192
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:15,233
I mean like a real girl. Not a friend.

193
00:10:16,105 --> 00:10:18,107
- A real girl?
- Yeah.

194
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,822
I guess not.

195
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:23,617
- Separation of church and state.
- Ah, yes.

196
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:27,283
Build up as many walls as possible.
That's really healthy.

197
00:10:27,408 --> 00:10:29,502
- What, are you talking to me about walls?
- Yeah.

198
00:10:29,618 --> 00:10:31,837
What about you and your mom?

199
00:10:31,996 --> 00:10:34,966
You couldn't get me out of there fast
enough when she walked in on us.

200
00:10:35,124 --> 00:10:37,252
That was for your own protection. Okay?

201
00:10:37,334 --> 00:10:41,180
I'm just surprised she didn't try
to slip you her number or something.

202
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:43,470
She did. She put it in my phone.

203
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:45,685
- Under "MILF."
- Oh, my God.

204
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:48,475
It's cool, we only hooked up, like, twice.

205
00:10:50,097 --> 00:10:52,395
I'm starting to get a mental image.

206
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:53,727
Well, I have a video image.

207
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:56,983
No. Just stop it. Just stop it.

208
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:01,655
Just wrong.

209
00:11:04,987 --> 00:11:06,159
What?

210
00:11:07,698 --> 00:11:09,996
Nothing. Just glad I met you.

211
00:11:12,453 --> 00:11:15,502
Yeah, well, knowing you
doesn't suck either.

212
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:36,523
- But I thought you said...
- I know what I said.

213
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:14,791
God.

214
00:13:39,683 --> 00:13:41,856
Lasorda was a good pitcher,
but he was an even better manager.

215
00:13:41,977 --> 00:13:44,446
- Wrecking Crew?
- I wasn't saying he's not a great manager.

216
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:46,273
He's underappreciated as a pitcher,
that's all I'm saying.

217
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:47,700
We get it. Guys.

218
00:13:47,816 --> 00:13:48,908
- Hi.
- Morning.

219
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:52,488
- Good morning.
- Is it always this beautiful out here?

220
00:13:52,988 --> 00:13:55,867
Well, in between the fires and the floods,
we get about 10 good days.

221
00:13:56,492 --> 00:13:58,745
No, no. Here. You two sit together.

222
00:13:58,827 --> 00:14:00,204
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah, no, no.

223
00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:03,003
- You don't have to do that, Dad.
- I know. I wanna look at the boat.

224
00:14:03,082 --> 00:14:04,834
I love that boat.

225
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:07,010
- Here. Sorry.
- Great. Thanks.

226
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:08,550
Here.

227
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,054
Thank you. This... Okay.

228
00:14:13,676 --> 00:14:15,770
- Coffee, my lady?
- Yes, please.

229
00:14:16,762 --> 00:14:18,184
Thank you.

230
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,439
- All right, man!
- Look at you!

231
00:14:22,685 --> 00:14:25,814
- That's pretty impressive.
- Yay, Sammy!

232
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:27,569
All right!

233
00:14:27,898 --> 00:14:31,698
Oh, buddy. Your shirt's leaking.
Oh, no, that's...

234
00:14:31,777 --> 00:14:32,903
Apologies.

235
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:38,788
Here.

236
00:14:43,372 --> 00:14:45,045
- You okay?
- Yeah.

237
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,380
- You?
- Yeah.

238
00:14:59,805 --> 00:15:02,058
- See them, Sammy?
- Yeah.

239
00:15:03,892 --> 00:15:05,894
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

240
00:15:06,812 --> 00:15:08,655
God, it's nice.

241
00:15:08,731 --> 00:15:12,986
I do miss the mornings out here.
Right before it burns off, it really is beautiful.

242
00:15:13,235 --> 00:15:14,452
I like Jamie.

243
00:15:17,072 --> 00:15:18,915
And she's pretty, too.

244
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:21,748
Hey, easy, dude.
Don't you go casting a spell on her.

245
00:15:22,077 --> 00:15:25,752
I'm a magician, not a wizard.
You and your gay Harry Potter.

246
00:15:26,248 --> 00:15:28,797
You can't deny that going to Hogwarts
wouldn't be life-changing.

247
00:15:29,918 --> 00:15:32,421
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too, bud.

248
00:15:33,422 --> 00:15:36,266
Mom misses you. And so does Grandpa.

249
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,432
Does he say anything?

250
00:15:39,762 --> 00:15:42,606
No. But sometimes he calls me Dylan.

251
00:15:45,476 --> 00:15:47,103
He said that he didn't want the job.

252
00:15:47,186 --> 00:15:49,939
That he was just coming to New York
to explore his options.

253
00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:51,361
What a crock of gas.

254
00:15:52,357 --> 00:15:54,451
You fly across the country
to explore your options?

255
00:15:54,526 --> 00:15:55,948
Please. I don't think so.

256
00:15:56,028 --> 00:15:59,658
Exactly! Please, I knew I had him
the second he got off that plane.

257
00:15:59,823 --> 00:16:01,040
- Oh, did you, now?
- Yeah.

258
00:16:01,116 --> 00:16:03,710
Was that the same second you leapt
onto the baggage carousel barefoot

259
00:16:03,786 --> 00:16:05,129
and acted out a scene from Will and Grace?

260
00:16:05,788 --> 00:16:07,665
- She did?
- Oh, yeah, you should have seen her.

261
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,133
"Look at me, I'm goofy but cute."

262
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,755
You know what? It was all part of my plan.

263
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:12,006
Quite a plan.

264
00:16:12,127 --> 00:16:13,595
Did you major in Planning
at Headhunting College?

265
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,014
- So clever.
- It's not a real college, by the way, buddy.

266
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:19,180
You guys bicker like
you're an old married couple.

267
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:20,765
Here, pick a card, my lady.

268
00:16:20,844 --> 00:16:22,016
Okay.

269
00:16:22,137 --> 00:16:24,105
Oh, no, not that one. The one on top.

270
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:26,354
- This is a good one.
- So...

271
00:16:26,475 --> 00:16:27,647
- Yeah?
- Shuffle.

272
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,733
Did you get her an engagement gift?

273
00:16:30,145 --> 00:16:32,739
We're not engaged, Dad. We're not together.
We're just friends.

274
00:16:32,815 --> 00:16:36,991
All right, you don't wanna label it.
I understand. But get her some jewelry.

275
00:16:37,986 --> 00:16:39,363
The only thing your mom loves is jewelry.

276
00:16:39,488 --> 00:16:42,992
I don't care how upset she is,
I get her jewelry, she lights right up.

277
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:44,539
Where is she, anyway?

278
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:49,043
- She's not here, Dad.
- I know, that's why I asked. Where is she?

279
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,548
- She's not coming.
- Why not?

280
00:16:54,086 --> 00:16:56,839
She doesn't live with you any more, Pop.
You're not married.

281
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:00,217
- What?
- She left about 10 years ago.

282
00:17:00,342 --> 00:17:01,434
I don't understand.

283
00:17:01,844 --> 00:17:03,721
She divorced you, Dad.

284
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:08,192
- I have to call her.
- Dad, you can't.

285
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:09,689
Stop telling me what to do.

286
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:12,529
Get your...

287
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:17,443
Grandpa!

288
00:17:17,693 --> 00:17:18,990
Dylan, get...

289
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,446
- You okay, Dad?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

290
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:22,952
- Here, let me help you up.
- No, don't. Don't!

291
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:56,740
Here we are.

292
00:17:57,816 --> 00:18:00,114
This is beautiful.

293
00:18:00,235 --> 00:18:02,988
Yeah, this is where I used to
come to think. My rooftop.

294
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:04,573
Okay, how high do you think that fence is?

295
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,242
I'm a little over 6 foot.

296
00:18:06,408 --> 00:18:09,662
Looks like it's about three of me.
So six times three...

297
00:18:10,746 --> 00:18:12,419
Ninety-two feet.

298
00:18:12,915 --> 00:18:16,294
- Ninety-two feet. That's really tall, right?
- Yeah.

299
00:18:17,252 --> 00:18:20,756
But they don't want you to get up there,
so I guess that makes sense.

300
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:24,594
- Wait. Six times three...
- Oh, God, you poor kid.

301
00:18:25,469 --> 00:18:27,312
- What's up?
- Come on.

302
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:29,310
What? What? Where are you going?

303
00:18:29,932 --> 00:18:32,651
Jamie, no, no, no, no, no, wait.
They take this shit seriously, okay?

304
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:33,769
Look at all the cameras.

305
00:18:33,852 --> 00:18:37,231
This is the only landmark this city has
other than the Scientology Center.

306
00:18:37,314 --> 00:18:40,409
And if any of these cameras are hooked up
to the actual Scientology Center,

307
00:18:40,484 --> 00:18:42,361
that was an inappropriate joke
and I apologize.

308
00:18:42,444 --> 00:18:45,038
I believe in the freedom
of science fiction.

309
00:18:46,531 --> 00:18:48,204
Pussy! Oh, sorry.

310
00:18:48,283 --> 00:18:49,330
Pussy!

311
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:50,793
Come on!

312
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,924
- You really never been up here before?
- No.

313
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:02,472
I've also never transferred
heroin in my rectum,

314
00:19:02,547 --> 00:19:04,345
'cause it's against the law.

315
00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:08,475
You know, sometimes a simple
yes or no answer is adequate.

316
00:19:08,637 --> 00:19:10,310
Hey, why didn't you tell me about your mom?

317
00:19:10,806 --> 00:19:12,808
She's not worth talking about.

318
00:19:13,475 --> 00:19:14,476
That's rough.

319
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,187
So is leaving your husband and kids.

320
00:19:17,312 --> 00:19:19,360
Yeah, you never told me about him either.

321
00:19:19,481 --> 00:19:21,404
You know, there's a lot of stuff
you didn't tell me.

322
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:23,072
I don't want your pity.

323
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:28,324
I can handle anything except
that look in people's eyes.

324
00:19:30,742 --> 00:19:33,666
- That one.
- Who cares what anybody thinks?

325
00:19:34,204 --> 00:19:37,549
He's the smartest man I've ever known.
He's the only person I'd ever go to for advice.

326
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:38,918
He's my dad.

327
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:40,464
Dylan, he's still the same man.

328
00:19:40,544 --> 00:19:41,887
When I see the way people
look at him now...

329
00:19:42,004 --> 00:19:45,178
It doesn't matter how people look at him.

330
00:19:45,257 --> 00:19:46,509
All that matters is how you look at him.

331
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:49,435
Yeah, but he's walking around
without his pants. Everyone's staring.

332
00:19:49,553 --> 00:19:51,146
- So what?
- It's embarrassing.

333
00:19:51,221 --> 00:19:52,894
He needs to know that nothing has changed.

334
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:54,892
That he's still that same man to you.

335
00:19:55,017 --> 00:19:57,019
Can we stop talking about this?

336
00:19:58,562 --> 00:20:01,816
Yeah, that's really smart.
Let's just not talk about our feelings.

337
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:03,024
I'm trying not to.

338
00:20:05,027 --> 00:20:08,122
Come on. Is something going on here?
You've been acting really weird.

339
00:20:08,447 --> 00:20:10,199
- No, I haven't.
- Yeah, you have.

340
00:20:10,782 --> 00:20:12,079
Is this about what
happened the other night?

341
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,294
What, sex? That doesn't mean anything.
You know that.

342
00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:18,586
Right.

343
00:20:18,707 --> 00:20:20,880
- And I haven't been acting weird.
- Okay.

344
00:20:22,544 --> 00:20:24,922
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit!

345
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:27,011
- I told you!
- Well, I'm sorry!

346
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,137
Fuck!

347
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:31,311
This is the LAPD. You are trespassing.
Get down from the sign.

348
00:20:31,386 --> 00:20:32,558
We gotta jump.

349
00:20:34,473 --> 00:20:36,896
- Dylan, jump!
- I'm frozen.

350
00:20:36,975 --> 00:20:38,067
Come on, get down!

351
00:20:38,143 --> 00:20:39,269
Sin this is your last warning.

352
00:20:39,394 --> 00:20:41,567
- Use the ladder!
- I have a fear of heights!

353
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:46,569
And also helicopters!
They don't make sense to me!

354
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:48,995
What do you mean
you have a fear of heights?

355
00:20:49,446 --> 00:20:50,868
Why would you come up here?

356
00:20:50,947 --> 00:20:53,496
You called me a pussy!

357
00:20:55,494 --> 00:20:58,168
A bizarre situation
this afternoon in the Southland.

358
00:20:58,246 --> 00:21:01,796
The LAPD rescued a local man
from the Hollywood sign,

359
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,968
the city's only real landmark.

360
00:21:04,086 --> 00:21:06,259
They actually wrapped
you in a foil blanket!

361
00:21:06,463 --> 00:21:08,010
Did you run a marathon before this?

362
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,637
- Okay. Give me...
- No!

363
00:21:09,758 --> 00:21:12,011
- No, no. I wanna save it. I gotta save it.
- No. That's enough!

364
00:21:12,094 --> 00:21:14,347
- Give me the remote! Shut up!
- No, I wanna watch it over and over.

365
00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:16,022
Foil wrapper...

366
00:21:16,098 --> 00:21:17,315
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

367
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:20,018
It's okay, it'll be up on YouTube.

368
00:21:21,311 --> 00:21:25,032
Hey, you're still good to take Dad that week I
have to go to DC for Sam's class trip, right?

369
00:21:25,107 --> 00:21:28,281
- Yeah, he's gonna stay with me in New York.
- Oh, good.

370
00:21:28,652 --> 00:21:31,371
So, when are we gonna see Jamie again?

371
00:21:31,446 --> 00:21:32,914
I don't know.

372
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:35,367
What's your problem?
Did you have a fight with your girlfriend?

373
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,498
She's not my girlfriend.
Why don't you believe me?

374
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:39,963
I would believe you if
you didn't lie to me.

375
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:42,086
I saw you creeping out of her room
the other night.

376
00:21:42,165 --> 00:21:44,213
Like you had just had sex,
if you know what I mean.

377
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:46,211
Yes, I know what you
mean, you just said it.

378
00:21:46,294 --> 00:21:48,513
And how do you know
what I look like after I have...

379
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:51,850
I'm not talking to you about this, okay?
We're not together.

380
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,519
- Dylan.
- Enough! I'm not talking about it.

381
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:55,971
Dylan.

382
00:21:57,806 --> 00:21:59,228
Forgot my saw. I'll be right back.

383
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,359
I'll wait here. Don't worry about me.

384
00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:07,653
Friends who have sex?
What are you, in college?

385
00:22:07,732 --> 00:22:09,700
- It doesn't matter, it's over.
- Why?

386
00:22:09,818 --> 00:22:11,491
Because we don't like each other like that.

387
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,540
Okay, you know what?
Can we just talk about this? Sit down.

388
00:22:14,823 --> 00:22:16,245
What more are you looking for?

389
00:22:16,324 --> 00:22:18,326
- Who says I'm looking for anything?
- Dylan.

390
00:22:18,493 --> 00:22:21,667
- I don't know, but it's not Jamie.
- Why, because you're great together?

391
00:22:21,997 --> 00:22:23,590
Because you're actually
friends with each other?

392
00:22:23,665 --> 00:22:26,134
Because this is the happiest
I have ever seen you?

393
00:22:26,209 --> 00:22:29,088
I don't know what to tell you. She's not for me.
I don't like her like that.

394
00:22:29,171 --> 00:22:32,675
- You liked her enough to have sex with her.
- It's just physical.

395
00:22:32,757 --> 00:22:35,636
- Like playing tennis.
- I don't even know what that means, Dylan.

396
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:38,268
I haven't seen you this dumb
since you got that candy corn tattoo.

397
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:40,686
It's a lightning bolt! With extra powers!

398
00:22:40,765 --> 00:22:42,859
Dylan, you can't name
one thing that's wrong with her.

399
00:22:43,018 --> 00:22:46,147
I can never go out with her.
She's too fucked up.

400
00:22:46,229 --> 00:22:48,152
Okay, she doesn't want a boyfriend.

401
00:22:48,231 --> 00:22:49,403
She's too damaged.

402
00:22:49,524 --> 00:22:51,572
Magnum P.l. couldn't solve
the shit going on in her head.

403
00:22:51,693 --> 00:22:53,912
Wow. You'll say anything right now

404
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:55,576
not to admit that
you're perfect for each other.

405
00:22:55,697 --> 00:22:57,574
- Why am I still having this conversation?
- Because I'm right.

406
00:22:57,699 --> 00:22:59,372
- Good talk, Annie.
- Dylan.

407
00:23:19,596 --> 00:23:21,644
I don't think the three-point line
would have done anything.

408
00:23:21,723 --> 00:23:23,521
- He was taller than anyone alive.
- No, but it helped Kobe.

409
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,068
- Kobe Bryant is incredible.
- It helped him.

410
00:23:25,143 --> 00:23:28,522
- You're men. You like sports. You're men.
- Scored 81 points. Please.

411
00:23:28,605 --> 00:23:30,482
Hey! We were waiting for you.

412
00:23:30,774 --> 00:23:32,196
I actually got a call from work.

413
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:33,993
I have to be on a red eye tonight
back to New York.

414
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:35,741
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

415
00:23:36,112 --> 00:23:38,080
- Tomorrow's the 4th.
- I know, it sucks.

416
00:23:38,323 --> 00:23:39,620
Well, at least let me
drive you to the airport.

417
00:23:39,741 --> 00:23:42,745
No, no. It's fine. Stay.
I already called a cab. It's out front.

418
00:23:42,827 --> 00:23:44,875
But thank you guys for everything.

419
00:23:44,955 --> 00:23:47,754
And thank you for letting me stay here.
It's been pretty great.

420
00:23:51,002 --> 00:23:52,174
- Hey.
- Hey.

421
00:23:52,254 --> 00:23:55,178
- Everything okay, buddy?
- Yeah, buddy. Everything's great.

422
00:23:55,257 --> 00:23:56,600
I just really gotta go.

423
00:23:56,925 --> 00:24:00,555
So, thank you again. I'm sorry I gotta go.

424
00:24:00,637 --> 00:24:02,355
- Let Dylan drive you.
- Yeah.

425
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:05,274
- Do you wanna take some food to go?
- Do you want me to saw you in half?

426
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:08,687
You can send your bottom part to New York
and your top half can stay here.

427
00:24:10,146 --> 00:24:13,150
Or the whole of you could stay.

428
00:24:13,275 --> 00:24:14,993
Okay, I'm sorry. I gotta go.

429
00:24:27,372 --> 00:24:28,794
Jamie!

430
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:38,847
She's gone. She hopped in the cab.

431
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:48,519
- We should eat. You hungry, buddy?
- Yeah.

432
00:24:48,893 --> 00:24:51,316
Okay. Hand me your plate.

433
00:25:21,593 --> 00:25:24,437
Hey, bro. You hungry?
'Cause I'm going to get something to eat.

434
00:25:24,512 --> 00:25:27,516
Thanks, man.
I think I'm just gonna work through lunch.

435
00:25:27,682 --> 00:25:32,779
A work ethic. I love it.
That is why this country is still number one.

436
00:25:33,355 --> 00:25:37,110
Well, behind Germany and France
and Belgium and Japan and China and...

437
00:25:37,525 --> 00:25:39,778
Thank God for Bangladesh.

438
00:25:40,528 --> 00:25:44,032
By the way, why did you take
your door off its lovely hinges?

439
00:25:44,115 --> 00:25:46,538
It was dumb, man.
Something I saw in a management book.

440
00:25:46,701 --> 00:25:50,456
Oh, right, right.
Like, that's how Warren Buffett got rich.

441
00:25:50,538 --> 00:25:52,290
He took doors off of things.

442
00:25:52,374 --> 00:25:54,376
Hey, everybody wants a shortcut in life.

443
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:57,303
My guidebook is very simple.
You wanna lose weight?

444
00:25:57,462 --> 00:25:58,634
Stop eating, fatty.

445
00:25:58,755 --> 00:25:59,881
You wanna make money?

446
00:25:59,964 --> 00:26:01,966
Work your ass off, lazy.

447
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,176
You wanna be happy?

448
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:05,478
Find someone you like and never let him go.

449
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,724
Or her, if you're into
that Kind of creepy shit.

450
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:24,072
Hi, you've reached Jamie Rellis.
I can't pick up the phone right now

451
00:26:24,155 --> 00:26:26,749
but please leave a message
and I'll call you back.

452
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:36,919
Mom, Mom, you gotta point it at the screen.
You gotta tell it where you are.

453
00:26:37,585 --> 00:26:40,964
Fine. I'm over here pouring myself a drink.

454
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:48,434
Booty call.
I can take a walk around the block.

455
00:26:48,513 --> 00:26:51,107
No, no. Nope, that's okay.

456
00:26:51,182 --> 00:26:52,934
This is your apartment.
I don't wanna twat-block you.

457
00:26:55,937 --> 00:26:57,780
That's Dylan, right?

458
00:26:57,939 --> 00:26:59,737
- He seemed pretty great.
- You met him once.

459
00:26:59,816 --> 00:27:01,659
Well, that's more than
anybody else you've dated.

460
00:27:01,943 --> 00:27:04,947
I don't know, you think maybe I keep
my worlds apart for some crazy reason?

461
00:27:16,124 --> 00:27:18,627
I am an asshole.

462
00:27:19,294 --> 00:27:22,389
We're looking for someone
to lead the redesign of our entire website.

463
00:27:22,464 --> 00:27:24,216
Someone to turn it completely upside down.

464
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:26,051
But you can't tell me
what company you work for?

465
00:27:26,134 --> 00:27:28,683
For confidentiality reasons, no.

466
00:27:28,803 --> 00:27:30,020
Can you give me a hint?

467
00:27:30,138 --> 00:27:34,143
We may or may not be the largest seller
of purchased goods on the Internet.

468
00:27:34,225 --> 00:27:36,569
And by 'purchased goods, ” I mean books.

469
00:27:36,978 --> 00:27:39,572
You just placed the new art director
over at GQ, right?

470
00:27:39,647 --> 00:27:40,694
Yeah.

471
00:27:40,815 --> 00:27:43,694
That's the type of guy we want.
Shoot, that's the guy we want.

472
00:27:43,818 --> 00:27:44,819
Can you get him to come out to us?

473
00:27:45,653 --> 00:27:48,247
No longer have a relationship with him.

474
00:27:48,364 --> 00:27:51,208
- Can you get to him?
- He's still in the first year of his contract,

475
00:27:51,326 --> 00:27:53,749
so that would be inappropriate.

476
00:27:53,828 --> 00:27:55,922
So is paying full price
for a book at Barnes & Noble,

477
00:27:55,997 --> 00:27:57,169
but people do dumb shit.

478
00:28:00,835 --> 00:28:03,338
Hi, you've reached Jamie Rellis.
I can't pick up the phone right now

479
00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:05,515
but please leave a message
and I'll call you back.

480
00:28:05,673 --> 00:28:08,677
Wow, right to voice mail. Didn't even ring.

481
00:28:20,939 --> 00:28:22,191
Jamie.

482
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:26,406
How'd you know I was up here?

483
00:28:27,695 --> 00:28:29,538
Only place in the city
you don't get reception.

484
00:28:29,614 --> 00:28:30,866
Right.

485
00:28:31,032 --> 00:28:33,126
- Why are you avoiding me?
- I'm not.

486
00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:35,377
Really? Come on, Jamie.

487
00:28:35,537 --> 00:28:39,542
Well, Dylan, I don't know if you've heard,
but I am seriously fucked up.

488
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,221
I mean, Magnum P.I. couldn't solve
the shit going on up here.

489
00:28:45,213 --> 00:28:47,511
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- But I'm just gonna go

490
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,890
and try to fix the shit going on up
in my head, if that's even possible.

491
00:28:51,553 --> 00:28:55,274
I shouldn't have said that.
I was just trying to get my sister off my back.

492
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,609
- She thought we liked each other.
- Yeah, me, too, Dylan.

493
00:28:57,725 --> 00:28:58,726
I thought we were friends.

494
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,404
But friends don't go
talking shit about each other,

495
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:04,858
which must mean that you and I
were actually never friends.

496
00:29:04,941 --> 00:29:08,366
- That all you wanted was to get in my pants.
- What?

497
00:29:08,444 --> 00:29:10,663
You jumped at the chance
at your dad's house.

498
00:29:10,738 --> 00:29:11,830
You cracked your neck.

499
00:29:11,906 --> 00:29:14,034
I thought you were giving me a sign.
We talked about this.

500
00:29:14,117 --> 00:29:15,460
Oh, my God, really?

501
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:17,830
You pulled my robe off.
"Oopsy." Remember?

502
00:29:17,912 --> 00:29:20,131
Yeah. And then you snuck out of the room.

503
00:29:20,248 --> 00:29:21,420
"Oopsy." Remember that?

504
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:25,421
Are you pissed off at me
because I didn't cuddle?

505
00:29:27,255 --> 00:29:31,351
Isn't that why we started
this whole arrangement in the first place?

506
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:33,182
You wanted this.

507
00:29:35,847 --> 00:29:37,440
I wanted this?

508
00:29:38,474 --> 00:29:39,771
Just me?

509
00:29:40,101 --> 00:29:43,401
God, you are just like every other guy.

510
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:46,278
The sad thing is, Dylan,
I actually thought you were different.

511
00:29:46,357 --> 00:29:48,610
Different from what?
I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your friend.

512
00:29:49,444 --> 00:29:51,617
Well, with friends like you,
who needs friends?

513
00:29:54,365 --> 00:29:58,791
And thank you for ruining my mountaintop.

514
00:29:59,662 --> 00:30:00,959
Asshole.

515
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:09,847
Hey, man, you can't be up here.

516
00:30:10,715 --> 00:30:11,887
Okay.

517
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:14,849
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

518
00:30:41,496 --> 00:30:43,544
Bryce, is this for me?

519
00:30:43,831 --> 00:30:46,209
Yeah. And so is this.

520
00:30:46,584 --> 00:30:49,178
Madison, will you many me?

521
00:30:49,504 --> 00:30:51,427
You bet your ass, Flapjack!

522
00:30:53,675 --> 00:30:55,928
- I love New York.
- I love you.

523
00:30:56,678 --> 00:30:58,555
Oh, my God.
Look, the Empire State Building.

524
00:30:58,763 --> 00:30:59,935
Wow.

525
00:31:00,014 --> 00:31:01,607
Oh, look, the Statue of Liberty.

526
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,362
Hello, this is Jamie.

527
00:31:12,193 --> 00:31:14,116
What do you mean they went to him directly?

528
00:31:15,196 --> 00:31:16,698
Well, is he gonna take it?

529
00:31:16,864 --> 00:31:19,959
No, no, no, no, no. I'll handle it.
I'll call him right now.

530
00:31:20,034 --> 00:31:21,206
Okay.

531
00:31:24,956 --> 00:31:26,708
Hey this is Dylan. Leave a message.

532
00:31:35,091 --> 00:31:36,764
Excuse me. May I help you?

533
00:31:36,968 --> 00:31:39,016
Oh, hi. Where's Dylan Harper?

534
00:31:39,095 --> 00:31:40,722
He's at a photo shoot for the sports issue.

535
00:31:41,222 --> 00:31:44,476
That's right. The photo shoot.
Where was that again?

536
00:31:44,726 --> 00:31:45,818
I'm sorry. Who are you?

537
00:31:46,561 --> 00:31:47,733
One of the models.

538
00:31:48,438 --> 00:31:50,566
I have the perfect body for Photoshop.

539
00:31:51,065 --> 00:31:54,660
Yeah, this gets more angular,
these get longer,

540
00:31:54,777 --> 00:31:57,075
and this gets way more Christian.

541
00:31:57,572 --> 00:31:59,666
So where did you say he was again?

542
00:32:00,742 --> 00:32:04,121
Sports is the last chance we have
of bringing our world together, bro.

543
00:32:04,287 --> 00:32:07,336
So I just wanted to shoot some photos
that speak to that,

544
00:32:07,415 --> 00:32:09,793
to the unification of all people
through sports.

545
00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:11,294
Okay, guys. Let's go.

546
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,091
That's it.

547
00:32:13,629 --> 00:32:14,846
Beautiful.

548
00:32:15,006 --> 00:32:16,724
Okay, now put your arms around each other,

549
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,143
like you like each other,
like you love each other.

550
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,763
- Too gay?
- A little bit.

551
00:32:22,013 --> 00:32:24,141
Throw some girls in there.

552
00:32:24,265 --> 00:32:26,609
Come on, ladies. Hop to.

553
00:32:28,186 --> 00:32:31,486
Girls, girls. Okay, look. Just blend in.

554
00:32:31,939 --> 00:32:34,158
Okay, let's go boy, girl, boy...

555
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:36,118
- Dylan.
- ...boy, boy, boy, boys.

556
00:32:36,944 --> 00:32:38,787
- What are you doing here?
- You met for another job!

557
00:32:38,863 --> 00:32:41,616
- What, are you gonna leave now?
- I don't know. Yeah, I took one meeting.

558
00:32:41,699 --> 00:32:44,122
- I can't believe you.
- Come here.

559
00:32:45,161 --> 00:32:47,255
- Is this your way of getting back at me?
- What?

560
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,458
You know that if you leave
before a year is up, I get screwed.

561
00:32:49,707 --> 00:32:51,175
Oh, right.

562
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:52,509
If I did leave,

563
00:32:52,627 --> 00:32:55,426
which I don't know yet
because all I did was take one meeting,

564
00:32:55,505 --> 00:32:57,348
I'd write you a check for your bonus.

565
00:32:58,633 --> 00:33:01,011
Whatever it is, I'll pay for it.
Happy now? We good?

566
00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:03,475
- Why didn't you tell me you were looking?
- That's personal.

567
00:33:03,554 --> 00:33:05,852
And we're not friends any more.
You made that pretty clear.

568
00:33:07,391 --> 00:33:11,066
See, all I wanted to do
was have sex with you. Remember?

569
00:33:11,813 --> 00:33:13,406
Pretend you were the best
friend I'd ever had.

570
00:33:13,481 --> 00:33:15,324
Open up to you
like I've never done with anyone ever.

571
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,995
And then when the sex stopped,
invite you to LA for the weekend

572
00:33:20,571 --> 00:33:22,039
to introduce you to my family.

573
00:33:23,574 --> 00:33:25,997
- I'll send you a check if I take the job.
- Don't bother.

574
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,088
Why don't you pick him up?

575
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:36,095
Yeah. Just pick him on up.

576
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:38,507
Oh, you little Christ figure, you!

577
00:34:02,697 --> 00:34:05,041
- Hey, Dyl.
- Dad's coming into Newark Airport, right?

578
00:34:05,116 --> 00:34:06,868
Yeah, he leaves at 9:00 our time.

579
00:34:07,034 --> 00:34:09,878
9:00. So it's a five-hour flight,
three-hour time difference,

580
00:34:09,954 --> 00:34:12,582
so he gets in at 321007

581
00:34:12,707 --> 00:34:15,711
5:00. Be there at 5:00, Dylan.

582
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,928
Right. How is Dad?

583
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:22,092
He's lost more often than not now.

584
00:34:22,216 --> 00:34:25,220
But then he has these moments
of real clarity. It's hit or miss.

585
00:34:25,303 --> 00:34:26,475
- Okay.
- How's Jamie?

586
00:34:28,973 --> 00:34:30,566
- That's over.
- Oh, Dylan!

587
00:34:30,725 --> 00:34:33,774
- Okay, we're done.
- Don't be an idiot, please.

588
00:34:33,895 --> 00:34:36,239
Thank you, Annie.
I'll pick up Dad tomorrow at the airport.

589
00:34:36,314 --> 00:34:38,066
- 32:00 sharp.
- I love you.

590
00:34:41,736 --> 00:34:43,113
I don't know what it is.

591
00:34:43,237 --> 00:34:45,740
I just can't get myself
to start looking for a replacement for him,

592
00:34:45,823 --> 00:34:46,915
assuming that he leaves.

593
00:34:46,991 --> 00:34:50,211
- Do you want some motherly love advice?
- Not really.

594
00:34:50,286 --> 00:34:52,038
Oh, good, 'cause I don't know
how to do that.

595
00:34:52,121 --> 00:34:55,716
What I do know is that
it's no great goddamn secret

596
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:58,510
you live in fear of repeating my mistakes.

597
00:34:58,586 --> 00:35:00,680
And you're not wrong, so learn from me.

598
00:35:00,922 --> 00:35:03,926
Do you know how many men in my life
I thought were really perfect?

599
00:35:04,133 --> 00:35:05,259
- Eighty.
- One.

600
00:35:05,426 --> 00:35:07,099
- Eighty-one?
- One.

601
00:35:07,303 --> 00:35:09,772
It was your dad. Greatest man I ever met.

602
00:35:09,847 --> 00:35:11,520
Obviously. Look at you.

603
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,819
How smart you are, how great,
how funny, how driven.

604
00:35:14,936 --> 00:35:16,279
Your vaguely Middle Eastern beauty.

605
00:35:16,354 --> 00:35:19,107
Sure as hell didn't all come from me.

606
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,534
Okay, but, seriously, Mom,

607
00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:23,953
do you really not remember
where my dad's from?

608
00:35:24,153 --> 00:35:25,780
Or is it like a coping mechanism?

609
00:35:25,863 --> 00:35:27,661
- A little of both.
- Okay.

610
00:35:27,782 --> 00:35:30,285
But I'm pretty sure he's Eurasian.

611
00:35:31,452 --> 00:35:35,127
I mean, we all have our Prince Charming,
you just gotta know him when you see him.

612
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:37,792
Mom, it's Prince Charming.
You should just know.

613
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:41,129
Well, your Prince Charming isn't coming
to rescue you in a horse and carriage.

614
00:35:41,212 --> 00:35:42,885
That's not who you want.

615
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:46,889
I mean, you're looking for a man
to be your partner.

616
00:35:47,802 --> 00:35:49,520
To take on the world with.

617
00:35:49,637 --> 00:35:52,390
You gotta update your fairytale, baby.

618
00:35:53,015 --> 00:35:54,858
My Prince Charming?

619
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:56,902
You.

620
00:35:57,061 --> 00:35:58,153
Mom.

621
00:36:20,418 --> 00:36:24,013
- Hey.
- A wheelchair. Like I'm an invalid.

622
00:36:24,171 --> 00:36:25,718
- How was the flight?
- I'm hungry.

623
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,558
You know they don't serve food
in coach any more?

624
00:36:27,675 --> 00:36:29,928
You'd think with these new planes,
they practically fly themselves,

625
00:36:30,011 --> 00:36:32,560
they could get rid of a pilot
and use his salary for a hot lunch.

626
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,103
- I know, right? Let's get you some food.
- God.

627
00:36:35,558 --> 00:36:37,777
The engineering on these planes
is so advanced.

628
00:36:37,852 --> 00:36:39,069
Completely computerized.

629
00:36:39,186 --> 00:36:41,188
- It's like playing a video game.
- Exactly.

630
00:36:41,355 --> 00:36:44,199
God. How long have we been waiting here?
It's ridiculous.

631
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:46,406
I'll be right back, okay?

632
00:36:49,196 --> 00:36:51,244
Excuse me. We've been waiting a while.

633
00:36:51,365 --> 00:36:53,038
- Harper.
- Yeah, I got you. I got you.

634
00:36:53,117 --> 00:36:54,744
I have to seat people
in the order they came.

635
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:56,792
I totally understand that,
but I'm with my dad

636
00:36:56,871 --> 00:36:58,748
- and he's not in the best shape.
- I'm sorry.

637
00:36:58,914 --> 00:37:00,712
Is there no way we could,
like, squeeze a table?

638
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:03,632
No, I gotta go by the list. Sorry.

639
00:37:07,548 --> 00:37:08,720
Dad?

640
00:37:15,556 --> 00:37:16,728
Dad?

641
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:19,561
Shit. Dad?

642
00:37:32,281 --> 00:37:33,749
You gonna join me?

643
00:37:43,459 --> 00:37:45,086
Absolutely.

644
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:51,597
Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry, you cannot do this.

645
00:37:51,675 --> 00:37:53,894
Could I get a steak, medium, please?

646
00:37:53,969 --> 00:37:55,937
- Sir, this is the Daily Grill.
- Make that two.

647
00:38:05,106 --> 00:38:06,483
Dede? Dede!

648
00:38:15,449 --> 00:38:16,621
Dad.

649
00:38:17,118 --> 00:38:18,461
Dad.

650
00:38:22,289 --> 00:38:23,381
Who is Dede?

651
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:28,467
Jesus. She's just a girl
that I met in the Navy.

652
00:38:29,547 --> 00:38:30,969
Was...

653
00:38:33,467 --> 00:38:35,060
She was the love of my life.

654
00:38:36,637 --> 00:38:37,684
Okay?

655
00:38:38,806 --> 00:38:40,149
Why didn't you tell me about her before?

656
00:38:40,307 --> 00:38:43,151
This is not something
you discuss with your children.

657
00:38:43,227 --> 00:38:46,106
And besides, I have you and Annie.
I have no regrets.

658
00:38:46,188 --> 00:38:47,235
So tell me now.

659
00:38:49,483 --> 00:38:50,860
She was the love of my life.

660
00:38:50,985 --> 00:38:52,237
And I was too stupid to realize it,

661
00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:55,414
and I lost her because of something
so dumb I don't even remember.

662
00:38:56,157 --> 00:38:57,579
And I never really got over her.

663
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:01,914
And I think that may be
one of the reasons your mom left.

664
00:39:03,164 --> 00:39:06,714
You know, my friends used to say that
when Dede and I looked at each other,

665
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:08,006
it was electric.

666
00:39:08,085 --> 00:39:09,337
And I let her go.

667
00:39:09,753 --> 00:39:11,096
I just let her go.

668
00:39:11,172 --> 00:39:14,722
Because I was too damn proud
to tell her howl really felt about her.

669
00:39:15,426 --> 00:39:18,020
I'll tell you something that I wish
I knew when I was your age.

670
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:20,022
And I know you've heard
a million times, "life is short."

671
00:39:20,097 --> 00:39:23,692
But let me tell you something,
what this is teaching me

672
00:39:23,767 --> 00:39:26,896
is that life is goddamn short
and you can't waste a minute of it.

673
00:39:29,523 --> 00:39:31,366
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

674
00:39:35,863 --> 00:39:39,709
The girl I brought home to LA, Jamie?

675
00:39:39,783 --> 00:39:42,457
- Yeah, what's going on with her?
- I think I messed it up.

676
00:39:42,953 --> 00:39:44,546
- Fix it.
- She won't talk to me.

677
00:39:44,872 --> 00:39:47,000
Maybe she'll listen. There's always a way.

678
00:39:47,082 --> 00:39:51,758
If you think there's even a chance
that she could be it, you fix it.

679
00:39:53,881 --> 00:39:55,133
Did Annie put you up to this?

680
00:39:55,883 --> 00:39:57,055
Who's Annie?

681
00:39:57,593 --> 00:39:58,765
I'm kidding.

682
00:39:58,886 --> 00:40:01,184
What, I can't joke about this?

683
00:40:01,263 --> 00:40:03,766
- Jesus Christ, Dad.
- I don't know what else to do.

684
00:40:05,601 --> 00:40:06,727
Let's go.

685
00:40:07,102 --> 00:40:09,150
You don't want to finish your steak?

686
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:12,109
We're eating in the goddamn airport.
I can leave the steak. Come on.

687
00:40:12,608 --> 00:40:16,579
Yeah, hey, this is Dylan Harper from GQ.
We meta few weeks ago at the...

688
00:40:16,654 --> 00:40:19,123
Right. Hey, can I ask you a huge favor?

689
00:40:19,448 --> 00:40:21,917
- I am so sorry, sir.
- It's my fault.

690
00:40:21,992 --> 00:40:23,539
- You just scared me.
- No, no. My fault. You all right?

691
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:25,121
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Here, let me help you with that.

692
00:40:25,246 --> 00:40:27,840
- Thanks, man. You're really nice.
- All right. Hey, safe travels.

693
00:40:27,915 --> 00:40:29,417
- All right, thanks, man.
- Okay, thank you.

694
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:34,013
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
All right, let's dance, Clowny Brown.

695
00:40:34,171 --> 00:40:36,845
- What's your problem with me?
- I saw you at that bar with Jamie.

696
00:40:37,091 --> 00:40:40,686
How could such an awesome girl
be with this over this?

697
00:40:41,428 --> 00:40:44,272
I've been trying to take that little monkey
to pound-town for years.

698
00:40:44,765 --> 00:40:46,608
- I'll tell her you say hello.
- What?

699
00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:48,857
You missed a little. There you go.

700
00:40:48,936 --> 00:40:50,609
Dylan! I got a cab. Come on.

701
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,110
I ever run into you again,

702
00:40:52,189 --> 00:40:54,612
I'll crush your earlobes
and make soup stock out of them.

703
00:40:54,775 --> 00:40:56,777
- You have a vivid imagination.
- I do!

704
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,204
- I'm gonna get in the cab now.
- I'm gonna go make soup!

705
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,157
- What's the matter with her?
- I don't know.

706
00:41:05,286 --> 00:41:08,631
God! I thought LA was bad.
This traffic is terrible.

707
00:41:08,789 --> 00:41:10,041
Is there another way into the city?

708
00:41:20,467 --> 00:41:22,561
I owe you big time, Tommy.

709
00:41:22,636 --> 00:41:27,016
You'll make it up to me.
Actually, I was heading into town anyway.

710
00:41:27,516 --> 00:41:31,817
Tonight's the Butterfly Ball.
Great place to pick up dudes.

711
00:41:31,979 --> 00:41:34,152
- You okay, Dad?
- Are you kidding?

712
00:41:34,315 --> 00:41:37,615
1937 Chris-Craft?
Couldn't get any better, buddy.

713
00:41:37,693 --> 00:41:38,819
Nice.

714
00:41:41,071 --> 00:41:43,244
Yeah. Hi, this is Dylan. We met at...

715
00:41:43,324 --> 00:41:46,419
Right. Can I ask you a huge favor?

716
00:41:50,914 --> 00:41:53,258
My number. Here's the remote.

717
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,674
My friend Dave from across the hall, his
oven broke, so he'll be using the kitchen.

718
00:41:56,754 --> 00:42:00,099
Your friend Dave is here using the kitchen
or watching me?

719
00:42:00,507 --> 00:42:01,850
Go.

720
00:42:02,009 --> 00:42:03,556
- Holy...
- What?

721
00:42:03,677 --> 00:42:05,520
"How to wear white pants to a cookout."

722
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:08,774
Did you scoop the Times on this?
I smell Pulitzer.

723
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,567
All right, all right.

724
00:42:10,684 --> 00:42:12,106
Just say hello to her for me, will you?

725
00:42:13,103 --> 00:42:14,525
See you, Dad.

726
00:42:15,856 --> 00:42:17,028
Thanks, man.

727
00:42:17,399 --> 00:42:18,946
Hi, Dave from across the hall.

728
00:42:19,026 --> 00:42:22,747
Hi, Mr. Harper. How are you?

729
00:42:23,614 --> 00:42:25,207
And now we know why you're here.

730
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,795
Mom, I'm over by the Lexington exit.
Where are you?

731
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,998
I'm standing right by the guy in the tie.

732
00:42:32,081 --> 00:42:35,756
- There are a million guys in ties.
- So look for the guy I'm standing next to.

733
00:42:35,876 --> 00:42:38,720
You never do what you say you're gonna do.
When am I gonna learn?

734
00:42:38,921 --> 00:42:40,423
Just hang on, baby.

735
00:42:45,052 --> 00:42:46,144
What?

736
00:42:48,472 --> 00:42:50,395
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to make it after al/.

737
00:42:50,474 --> 00:42:52,602
Something came up. Let's meet tomorrow.

738
00:42:52,726 --> 00:42:55,821
I'll be on the stairs.
Right across from you.

739
00:43:00,275 --> 00:43:01,743
Oh, my God.

740
00:43:02,111 --> 00:43:03,579
Have a great night, baby.

741
00:43:22,965 --> 00:43:24,512
What is this?

742
00:43:24,633 --> 00:43:27,307
It's Closing Time, by the band Semisonic!

743
00:43:27,594 --> 00:43:29,892
It's not Third Eye Blind.
Can you believe that?

744
00:43:29,972 --> 00:43:32,771
No, no, no. Not the song. This.

745
00:43:32,975 --> 00:43:34,977
You said you wanted your life
to be like a movie.

746
00:43:35,936 --> 00:43:39,531
Sorry I had to use the real Grand Central
instead of the fake one.

747
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,372
Listen, Jamie, I'm...

748
00:43:47,448 --> 00:43:49,621
I'm having trouble hearing you!

749
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,577
Yeah, I didn't really think this through.

750
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,004
I guess in the movies
the guy pours his heart out

751
00:43:54,121 --> 00:43:55,498
and they put the music in later.

752
00:43:55,664 --> 00:43:56,836
What?

753
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,299
I messed up.

754
00:44:02,296 --> 00:44:03,798
I was scared.

755
00:44:04,631 --> 00:44:06,349
Look at what happened
with my mom and my dad.

756
00:44:06,467 --> 00:44:07,559
Of course I was scared.

757
00:44:08,385 --> 00:44:09,807
So I ruined it.

758
00:44:10,971 --> 00:44:12,769
Everything that happens in the day,

759
00:44:12,848 --> 00:44:16,022
all I can think to myself is,
"I can't wait to tell Jamie about this."

760
00:44:17,019 --> 00:44:20,148
When I see someone cursing,
all I picture is you blinking.

761
00:44:20,981 --> 00:44:25,578
And when I hear a kid's been cured of
cancer, I pray it's not by that douchebag,

762
00:44:25,652 --> 00:44:28,576
tree-hugging fucking doctor
who ran out on you.

763
00:44:28,822 --> 00:44:33,202
I mean, cancer being cured is awesome,
but, you know, I wish someone else did it.

764
00:44:34,077 --> 00:44:35,374
Come on.

765
00:44:40,334 --> 00:44:42,678
Hey, I miss you.

766
00:44:42,836 --> 00:44:44,679
Yeah, I miss you, too.

767
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,848
But you're not wrong, I am damaged.

768
00:44:47,007 --> 00:44:49,226
So am I. Who isn't?

769
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:51,387
That's what makes us so awesome.

770
00:44:51,512 --> 00:44:53,185
- And our tattoos.
- Yeah.

771
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:57,852
- No, no, no.
- Shut up. It's not what you think.

772
00:44:58,393 --> 00:45:00,862
Jamie, will you be my best friend again?

773
00:45:01,897 --> 00:45:04,195
- That is so lame.
- I know.

774
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,986
That's some Prince Charming shit,
though, right?

775
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:08,286
- Get up.
- Okay.

776
00:45:09,863 --> 00:45:13,083
Look, I can live without
ever having sex with you again.

777
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:15,293
It'd be really hard.

778
00:45:15,744 --> 00:45:18,588
Hey, I want my best friend back,

779
00:45:18,872 --> 00:45:20,715
because I'm in love with her.

780
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:24,052
- Under one condition.
- Anything.

781
00:45:25,879 --> 00:45:27,222
Kiss me.

782
00:45:28,799 --> 00:45:31,427
- In public? In front of all these people?
- I did not ask you to...

783
00:45:51,071 --> 00:45:53,073
You can all go home now.

784
00:45:59,329 --> 00:46:01,297
Okay. So...

785
00:46:04,251 --> 00:46:06,424
- What do we do now?
- Have our first date.

786
00:46:06,795 --> 00:46:07,921
Okay.

787
00:46:11,091 --> 00:46:14,186
Oh, my God!
Did you get a horse and carriage?

788
00:46:15,262 --> 00:46:17,105
Yeah, that's not for you.

789
00:46:17,306 --> 00:46:20,355
Oh, thank God.
Horses actually scare the shit out of me.

790
00:46:20,517 --> 00:46:21,769
- Really?
- Yeah.

791
00:46:21,935 --> 00:46:23,187
So, where are you from?

792
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:25,819
- Outside of Philly, actually.
- Interesting.

793
00:46:26,023 --> 00:46:29,618
- I'm from LA, just moved to New York.
- Interesting. Didn't really ask, but go on.

794
00:46:29,693 --> 00:46:32,993
What? I'm excited, I'm
on a first date. So...

795
00:46:33,322 --> 00:46:35,495
This isn't weird at all.

796
00:46:35,616 --> 00:46:37,789
- We're okay.
- Yeah. Thank you.

797
00:46:40,162 --> 00:46:41,789
So...

798
00:46:44,374 --> 00:46:45,967
Yeah, fuck it.

799
00:52:57,163 --> 00:53:00,918
Roll credits, roll credits, roll credits.
And here come the outtakes.

800
00:53:01,334 --> 00:53:04,679
Because if the actors had
a good time making it, it must be good.

801
00:53:04,838 --> 00:53:06,681
You bet your ass, Jason.

802
00:53:07,257 --> 00:53:09,680
Oh, my God, I just called him Jason.

803
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,511
Look, the crew's laughing.

804
00:53:12,512 --> 00:53:15,391
They made me do it! They made me do it.

805
00:53:16,057 --> 00:53:17,525
It's my favorite part.
