-[Masher] John, wait!
- Masher?

00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:14,139
Has Astra released
the worst souls from hell onto Earth?

7
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,391
- I'm unkillable! [laughs]
-[grunts]

8
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,312
[Constantine] I'm putting
an end to this.

9
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,688
Are you trying to go back to hell?

10
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:23,732
I'll return when the sigil is complete.

11
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,401

[alternative music playing]

13
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,044
Ma'am, we caught him lurking outside.

14
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,675
It seems you're having a hard time
staying away from hell these days, John.

15
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,012
Well, what can I say?
I'm a creature of habit.

16
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,513
You might as well get used to it.

17
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,474
You'll be living down here soon enough.

18
00:00:59,142 --> 00:00:59,976
What do you want?

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,437
Oh, whiskey neat and a steak well done.

20
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,648
Oh, yeah, and all those souls
you released...

21
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,107
Call them back.

22
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,235
Look, there is enough evil on Earth

23
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,278
without you giving the damned
a second chance.

24
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:15,200
Those damned souls
are making me rich, John.

25
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:19,621
Any humans corrupted or killed by them
all belong to me.

26
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,249
And after years of being
under the boot of the triumvirate,

27
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:27,045
it sure feels good
to grind my heel on someone else.

00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,297
[Masher groans]

29
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,215
Masher?

[stuttering] John...

31
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,469
Help me.

32
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,847
John's better at getting his friends
into trouble than out of it.

33
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:41,226
Something you should have known
when you squealed on me.

34
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,227
-[squelches]
-[yells]

35
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,395
You don't have to do this, Astra.

36
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,647
I like doing this.

37
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,067
[groans] No more. Please.

38
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,527
[screams]

39
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,030
Astra, look, I came down here
for a friendly chat, all right?

40
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,033
Now, we don't have to be enemies.

41
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,911
[chuckles] You're not my enemy, John.

42
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,455
You're an important step
in my evolution.

43
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,500
I crawled my way up from the bottom,

44
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,712
and I finally have
some real power around here.

45
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,631
So, if you want to stop me...

46
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,092
you'll have to kill me.

47
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,428
But really, what's the point?

48
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:20,473
My soul would just end up
back down here anyway.

49
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,689
-[Constantine gasps]
- John.

50
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,817
-[coughs]
- What happened down there?

51
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,944
[panting]

52
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,238
I need a drink.

53
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:41,328
- No post-mission debrief?
-[sighs] It's part of his process.

54
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,081
Come on, Gideon,
play the damn message again.

55
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,292
[Gideon] You can mistreat me
all you like, Mr. Heywood,

56
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:51,338
but I assure you there are no secret
messages hiding in my memory banks.

57
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,381
Everything okay, bro?

58
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,885
Oh, um, yeah, I was just, uh,
double-checking something.

59
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,136
Little help?

60
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,104
I think I'm starting to see things.

61
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,523
I know what's going on.

62
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,858
You do?

63
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,651
You get into my stash again?

64
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,321
[both chuckle]

65
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,490
Dude, no worries.
Sara's gathering the team.

66
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,116
- Come on.
- Thanks.

67
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,119
And that is the truth of it, mateys.

68
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:27,332
Astra and this whole bloody mess
is on me.

69
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,626
And she can't be reasoned with.

70
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,087
So, we need a more permanent solution
to stop her,

71
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,756
or she could continue
releasing souls indefinitely.

72
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,717
Surely Astra can change.
She's still human, right?

73
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,469
I mean, even a Master of the Dark Arts

74
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,554
must believe there's still
some good left in her.

75
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,764
[Constantine] Forget it, big man.

76
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,559
Astra's lust for power,
it zapped the humanity out of her.

77
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,520
[Sara] Well, on the bright side,

78
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,356
at least the Encores
aren't our fault this time.

79
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,524
Hey, up top.

80
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,693
Is there any point in sending
these Encores to hell?

81
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,737
It sounds like Astra would
just send them straight back.

82
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:58,863
Correct.

83
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,825
Well, then, until we find
a more permanent solution,

84
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,910
we'll house the Encores on the ship.

85
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,871
We're gonna need a bigger pantry.

86
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:28,977
Hey, Cap, normally I'd be all for
rolling up my sleeves and pitching in,

87
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,896
but I gotta take shore leave
for my pop's birthday.

88
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,148
And Nate's coming with me.

89
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,649
- I am?
-[Sara] You are?

90
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,610
My parents are always
asking questions about my life.

91
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,696
He could pretend to be
one of my biz school professors.

92
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,281
[both mouthing]

93
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,366
I still can't believe that
you haven't told your parents

94
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,576
the truth about what you do.

95
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,619
You mean that
I'm a time-traveling superhero

96
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,871
who stole the family heirloom?

97
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,874
Hmm, okay.
Yeah, stick to business school.

98
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,208
We'll be back before
you can say Timequake.

99
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,168
Don't jinx it.

100
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,297
[Gideon] Too late, Captain.
A new Timequake has been detected.

101
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,923
You are needed on the bridge.

102
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,924
[sighs]

103
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:01,759
[groans]

104
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,637
What are we looking at?

105
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,891
Ah. The epicenter of the Timequake
is in Los Angeles, 1947.

106
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,684
It's the Golden Age of Hollywood

107
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,020
and the height
of organized crime in the city.

108
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,480
The real golden age.

109
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,274
All right, people, we're gonna
need two teams for the...

110
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,527
Sorry, honey. I think I'm in your spot,
aren't I?

111
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,779
Hey, don't sweat it, babe.

112
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,324
As Ava was saying, two teams.

113
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,658
Ray, John, with me.

114
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,870
Mick, Ava, QB from the ship.
Now let's do it.

115
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,166
Mmm. You hear that?

116
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,335
It's only my second official mission
with the Legends,

117
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,420
and I'm already being trusted
with the football.

118
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,338
Really?

119
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:42,050
QB means staying on the ship
and doing nothing.

120
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:46,346
Or it could mean providing the team
with vital information.

121
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:50,141
Gideon, pull up a topographical survey
of the city, please.

122
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,522
How you feeling?

123
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,066
[sighs] Great. I just needed to get
off the ship, clear my head--

124
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:58,983
[Speaking Farsi]

125
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,622
[in English] Guys,
this is Nathaniel Heywood.

126
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,998
He's one of my professors.

127
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,041
-[in English] Welcome.
- Thank you.

128
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,085
[in English] Oh, we've never
had a professor over for dinner.

129
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,127
What do you teach?

130
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,005
Advanced Macroeconomics.
Behavioral Economics--

131
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,799
-[Zari] Hey, guys.
- Brace yourself.

132
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,928
Z here. So I'm at my parents' house
celebrating my dad's birthday.

133
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,514
After all, family is everything.

134
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,645
Speaking of which, it looks like
we have a surprise guest this year.

135
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,064
My brother, Behrad.

136
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,233
- Say hello, B. [smooching]
- Hi.

137
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,362
Anyways, guys, I gotta go.
Big love to the Z-Nation.

138
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,613
[Speaking Farsi]

139
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,576
Insert that clip
at the end of the current file.

140
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,618
We'll start cutting tonight.

141
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,162
You two can set up glam
in the bathroom for touch-ups.

142
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,457
Hey, I thought this was
supposed to be a family party.

143
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,210
Huh, says the woman who just invited
her 48 million followers into her house.

144
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,462
It's 51 million. Try to keep up.

145
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,007
Zari, darling, isn't it marvelous?

146
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,093
Your brother brought home
one of his professors from grad school.

147
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,470
Zari, Nate. Nate, Zari.

148
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,471
Hi.

149
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,098
It's you.

150
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,726
[whispers] I saw the video.

151
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,437
Oh. Thanks for subscribing.

152
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,857
You know, it's the fans that really
make all the hard work worth it.

153
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,774
[chuckles]

154
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,279
What a weirdo.

155
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,209
Your sister is the secret woman
from the hologram message.

156
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,753
Secret what?

157
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,589
I thought I was hallucinating,
but Gideon was scrubbing her memory,

158
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,090
and there was a secret message
from your sister...

159
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,344
...telling me to find her,
and she's the reason I came back.

160
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,137
Are you having a psychological break?

161
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,680
No! I'm being serious.

162
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,891
Remember when
we dented history at Heyworld?

163
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,437
Your sister is the dent.

164
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,161
The traces of magical energy
lead into this office.

165
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,997
There's an infernal residue in here.

166
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,585
Sure is. Residue of a dead guy.

167
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,004
[grunts]

168
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,464
Oh, oh, stand back.

169
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,427
Ugh.

170
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,515
The victim was consumed
by <i>ignis inferni.</i>

171
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,016
It's hellfire.

172
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,103
Whoever did this to him
was not of this world.

173
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,481
Well, looks like our killer
is the Encore.

174
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:44,982
Bollocks!

175
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,276
Huh, there's the ticket.

176
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,115
[heels tapping]

177
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,788
[woman] Don't come any closer!

178
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,208
All right, easy. You can put
the gun down. We're here to help.

179
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,501
Where's Webb?

180
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,381
[Ray] Uh, we are the "& Moore"
of Webb & Moore.

181
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,133
We work with Moore. Webb.

182
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,094
You must be Moore.

183
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,931
[in American accent] Sure.
That's me. Johnny Moore.

184
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,392
Sara is my secretary,
and this fella here--

185
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,935
Has got a cop face.

186
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,019
Oh, thank you.

187
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:25,106
[chuckles] Sergeant Palmer
at your service. I'm undercover.

188
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,233
Tell Webb to call me when he's back.

189
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,360
He's, uh, on holiday. Vacation.

190
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,114
Which leaves me
handling your case, Miss...

191
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,532
Hill.

192
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,367
Jeanie Hill.

193
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,454
I hired your partner
to protect me from my boyfriend.

194
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,164
Oh, well, you're in good hands, ma'am.

195
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,751
[sighs] Give me a break, Johnny Law.
Half the PD is in Bugsy's pocket.

196
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,420
- Bugsy as in...
- Benjamin Siegel.

197
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,589
Doesn't like it when you call him Bugsy.

198
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:50,840
But here's the kicker.

199
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,593
He died last week.

200
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,429
And now he's back from the dead.

201
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,265
<i>[Jeanie] And he's more dangerous
than ever.</i>

202
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,684
[band playing swing music]

203
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,440
<i>He took over</i> a <i>joint on Sunset Boulevard
called the Blue Iguana.</i>

204
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,151

and the Hollywood elite.</i>

205

[music concludes]

207
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,535
Ladies and gentlemen...

208
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,705
welcome to the Blue Iguana.

209
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,874
Now, have fun. I insist.

210
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,126
If you don't,
I just might have to shoot you.

211
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,503
[laughter]

212
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,005
[photographer] Mr. Siegel.

213
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,466
Big smile for the camera, Mr. Siegel.

214
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,842
[camera shutter clicking]

215
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,813
Just, uh, cleaning up
a little bit of crumbs.

216
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,648
Please, Miss Hill, continue.

217
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,068
I was there when Bugsy
was assassinated by a mob hitman.

218
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,319
Saw the whole thing.

219
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,322
But then, the very next day,
lover boy shows up on my doorstep,

220
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,324
takes me to his club
like nothing had happened.

221
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,451
And that's just the biscuit.
Here comes the gravy.

222
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,620
He's different now.

223
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,581
More ambitious and fearless.

224
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,335
I want to leave him, but I can't
because I know he'd kill me.

225
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,837
[exhales heavily]

226
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,673
Look, Miss Hill, we can protect you
from your boyfriend.

227
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,967
But you're gonna need
to get out of town for a few days,

228
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,177
stay in a motel. Things could get messy.

229
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,137
But I don't have any money.

230
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,473
Bugsy takes care of all that.

231
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,938
How can I ever repay you?

232
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,983
No need to worry about that.
We just want to make sure you're safe.

233
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:37,780
Secretary Sara,
can you, uh, show Miss Hill the way out?

234
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,458
[in normal voice] Well, she took you
for an easy mark, Raymondo.

235
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,420
What? She was absolutely terrified.

236
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:53,963
Sara?

237
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,090
Jury's still out on the missus.

238
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,968
But it sounds like we need
to pay a visit to the Blue Iguana.

239
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,428
[band playing swing music]

240
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,443
All right, this is more like it.

241
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,986
Feels good to be back in the field.

242
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,282
Ava, what's your status?

243
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,909
Uh,been

244
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,702
Rory and I are just
sidling up to the bar now.

245
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,287
We're gonna keep an eye on things.

246
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,123
I'm, uh, seeing two zones of egress.

247
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,791
Back door's a gray zone.

248
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,585
Front door's got about four guys
sitting around it,

249
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,837
which quite frankly feels like overkill.
What do you think, Mick?

250
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,923
I think you need to relax.

251
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,257
[Agent Sharpe scoffs]

252
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,135
Ray, are you ready to grab Bugsy
when he comes out?

253
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,971
Ready and walking the beat.

254
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,849
Gotta say, feeling pretty spiffy
in this uniform.

255
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,020
[Sara] Bugsy's drawn himself
quite a crowd of ass-kissers.

256
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,856
Yeah, and judging by the cheap threads
and conservative haircuts,

257
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,858
I'd say they're politicians.

258
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,824
Well, if it isn't
our damsel in distress.

259
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,910
[scoffs] It's gonna be kind of hard
to protect her from her beau

260
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,495
when she's hanging on his arm.

261
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,206
I knew it.
She's as bent as a nine bob note.

262
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,255
Let's go.

263
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,927
[Sara] Not so fast, sister.

264
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,804
-[sighs]
- What happened to getting out of town?

265
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,641
You think a cab ride could get me away
from what Bugsy's got on me?

266
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,476
[with American accent] You and the rest
of town, by the looks of it.

267
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,727
Look“.

268
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:36,065
Ever since Bugsy came back,
he gets whatever he wants.

269
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,067
And everyone answers to him.

270
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,987
- Politicians, studio heads--
- Even the cops.

271
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,615
Then tell me, how did he get
so much juice so fast?

272
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,202
By using America's favorite pastime,
of course. Blackmail.

273
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,998
He's got a secret stash of compromising
photographs he uses against all of them.

274
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,541
And what does that have to do with you?

275
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,627
Everything. I'm in those pictures.

276
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,798
Bugsy used me as bait to lure men
and women into his trap.

277
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,135
[chuckles softly]

278
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,053
When I first moved here
from Shaker Heights,

279
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,055
I thought I was gonna be famous.

280
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,684
And sure, I became famous, all right.

281
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,395
Just not the right kind of famous.

282
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,108
I can't leave without those pictures.

283
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,402
Satisfied?

284
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,198
You know, if Bugsy
likes honeytraps so much,

285
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,909
why don't we give him
a taste of his own medicine?

286
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,483
I couldn't help but notice you,
and I gotta tell you,

287
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,735
I like the way you walk.

288
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:06,489
I learned to do it all by myself,
Mr. Siegel.

289
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,783
Oh, please. Benjamin.

290
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,119
Hmm. Sara Lance. At your service.

291
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,412
Lance,huh?

292
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,207
What's the matter? You don't like it?

293
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,834
Well, I don't know yet.
Just trying it out for size.

294
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,921
You know, even if it fits, I'm a little
curious about the price tag.

295
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,132
Well, if you have to ask,
it's probably too expensive.

296
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,675
[chuckles]

297
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,219
I take what I want.

298
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:31,514
Does that make you a thief, Mr. Siegel?

299
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,142
I am a lot of things, Miss Lance.

300
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,729
And I am especially a thief.

301
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,525
Well, then let's stop
all the tiddlywinks

302
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,236
and get straight
to the big reveal, shall we?

303
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,905
Now, I'm a reporter
for a new gossip rag,

304
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:52,743
and I've got some dirt on half the city
councilmen and the new archbishop.

305
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,245
It's in my car.

306
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,413
What do you say we go out back,

307
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,250
and you can take a peek
what's in my trunk?

308
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:03,629
I say, you keep talking like that,

309
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,923
I just might follow you anywhere.

310
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,341
[chuckles]

311
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,971
- Ray, I'm outside with--
-[earpiece beeps]

312
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,349
Benjamin. Car's this way.

313
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,936
You know, on second thought,
why don't we ditch the club?

314
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,022
How about you and me, we go someplace
with a little less company?

315
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,360
Actually, I think we
already have company.

Your eyesight's 20/20, doll.
Those are Mickey Cohen's boys.

But after going through hell,
I ain't afraid of nothing on this Earth.

[Ray] It feels weird to be foiled
by the good guys.

What's the plan B?

325
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,209
Well, it looks like
you're going downtown, Sergeant.

326
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,717
Tomorrow is huge.
We're making a line of dressy sneakers.

327
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,303
- It's gonna be so major.
- That's nice, dear.

328
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,264
So, Behrad, any girlfriends
we should know about?

329
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:41,185
No, Ma. There's not really much time
for dating, given all the coursework.

330
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,647
But you need to take your nose
out of your books on occasion,

331
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,692
otherwise you'll never find
a nice Persian girl to marry.

[in English] By all means.
Add to your entourage.

How much does worshipping you
pay these days?

335
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,293
[in English] My team
is my extended family.

336

They help me manage a multi-platform,
multi-million-dollar brand,

337
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,131
and I didn't even have
to go to business school.

Wow.

Why, yes, it is, Professor.

341
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,187
How do you know
about our family heirloom?

342
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:26,855
Behrad told me.

343
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,650
Really? What did he tell you
about the Air Totem?

344
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,818
[Behrad] Just that...

345
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,988
[voice breaking] I was so broken up
when I found out it was stolen.

346
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,407
We keep the painting up as a memento.

347
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:40,786
Even though it's lost, I feel like
it's still here with us today

348
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,329
in this very room.

- So, Sara,

350
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,714
do you, uh, want us back at the ship
for a post-mission debrief?

<i>[Sara] No. Mission ain't over yet.</i>

I need you guys posted at the club.

353

<i>Keep your eyes peeled
and your ears open.</i>

354
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,846
Great.

355
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,432
- What?
- Mmm?

356
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:03,726
[chuckles]

357
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:05,311
You wouldn't understand.

358
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,564
That you were the boss of
a massive government organization

359
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,274
and now you do diddly-squat?

360
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:15,487
Wow. I take it back, Rory.
You just summed up my life perfectly.

361
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,992
Can I get a double?

362
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:24,788
Bugsy is gonna be pretty hard to catch
if he still has that gun.

363
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,623
[in normal voice] Well,
we best get our hands on it pronto,

364
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,544
because only a weapon from hell
can eliminate a hell-spawned Encore.

365
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:35,257
And that gun, it may be useful
in more ways than one.

366
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,469
Well, good thing
I have my best man on the job.

367
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,695
Jeanie was right.

368
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,615
Bugsy really does have the LAPD
in his pocket.

369
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,870
I'm gonna have to figure out
another way to get that gun.

370
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,292
Can I take those arrest summaries
off your hands?

371
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,877
I'm on my way to records.

372
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,880
Sure. Aah.
That'd be super helpful. Thanks.

373
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,927
[officer] Tough to watch the department
kowtow to a gangster.

374
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,971
That's exactly what I was thinking.

375
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,641
Ah. Good cops like you are hard to find.

Well, see you around, Sergeant.

00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,274
Officer Sullivan.

381
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,237
Can certainly set your watch
to that fine constable.

382
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,573
We need a plan B.
If Ray can't get this gun,

383
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,701
the last thing we need is Bugsy
blasting anyone else out of existence.

384
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,246
Yeah, well,
maybe a stretch of the old legs

385
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,206
and some fresh air
will give us some clarity.

386
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,882
I think I know how to get Bugsy's gun.

387
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,933
[with American accent]
So, you got my message.

388
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,022
Look, if this is about the money
your friend gave me, I already spent it.

389
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,192
I knew you were on the grift
from the moment I laid eyes on you.

390
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,070
And I never once fell
for that Yankee accent of yours.

00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:22,948
[laughs]

392
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,826
[in normal voice]
Well, all right, then. [sighs]

393
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,870
Well, now that we've
dropped the charades, tell me,

394
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,996
what is your angle?

395
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:33,208
I want to take Bugsy down.
Free this town from his sway.

396
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,878
The only way to do that
is to destroy his blackmail stash.

397
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,754
Webb said he'd found it,

398
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,965
but I'm guessing Bugsy killed him
for snooping too close.

399
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,468
Well, that's bad news for Webb
and good news for me,

400
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,303
because I know where the stash is.

401
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,182
Well, aren't I the luckiest girl
in the world?

402
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,934
What do you want in exchange?

403
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,105
I want Bugsy's gun.

404
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,107
You're looking to ice Bugsy?

405
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,901
No, that bloke's not worth it.

406
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,153
I'm aiming at the person
who brought him back.

407
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,863
Then we have a deal.

408
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,158
You get your guy, I get my freedom.

409
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,871
Now, how exactly are you planning
on stealing Bugsy's prized weapon, eh?

410
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,748
When we kiss,

411
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,043
I'll press my hand against his chest,

412
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,088
and then I'll run my hand
all the way down his body,

413
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,258
and then I'll grab it, like this.

00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,273
Jeanie, no!

627
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,997
They killed her.

628
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,333
Forget it, Ray.

629
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,378
It's Burbank.

630
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,348
Hey, holding cell still works.

631
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,227
Who are you people?

632
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,021
- You communists?
- Idiots.

633
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,857
I know you're probably
pretty confused, Mr. Siegel,

634
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,442
but you might as well
make yourself comfortable

635
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,236
because you may be here for a while.

636
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,865
I should blast you straight to oblivion,
you dumb bastard.

637
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:21,244
You made Jeanie's life miserable,
and now she's dead because of you.

638
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,788
I may have corrupted a wannabe starlet,

639
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,834
but you, you created a real monster.

640
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,461
Astra Logue.

641
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,757
You know what?
It's funny that you mention her.

642
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,884
I was just about to go and see her.

643
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:40,138
John, if you're about to do
what I think you're gonna do,

644
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,306
then you'd better be sure.

645
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,642
Hand him over, big man.

646
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:45,852
Go on.

647
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,606
That's it, big boy.
See, you're my ticket to hell.

648
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,700
Flesh become my flesh.

649
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,535
Soul become my soul.

650
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,912
Hades, firstborn of Cronus and Rhea,

651
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,664
I call upon you.

652
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,583
Light her up, big man.

653
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:28,978
Hey, Astra says you're banned.

654
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,271
Is that so?

655
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,025
[patrons screaming]

656
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,496
You just can't stay away, can you?

657
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,456
Careful. He's still got one bullet left.

658
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:52,418
I appreciate your concern, Benjamin,
but I'm not worried about him.

659
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,670
We're old friends, aren't we, Johnny?

660
00:36:56,756 --> 00:37:01,010
So, why don't you tell me
what you came all the way down here for?

661
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,596
I came all the way down here
to tell you...

662
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,147
that I'm not giving up on you.

663
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,984
And even if it takes me till
the end of my days, I promise you

664
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,529
that I will find a way.

665
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:24,951
Another meaningless promise
made by the great John Constantine.

666
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,204
You've gone soft.

667
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,831
[both laughing]

668
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,000
Not that soft.

669
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,461
This one's for Jeanie.

670
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,634
[howls]

671
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:46,472
I'll be seeing you around, love.

672
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:54,605
So what happened down there?

673
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,775
- I need a drink.
- Not this time.

674
00:37:59,026 --> 00:37:59,986
Is Astra...

675
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,239
[sighs] When I got down there,
I was swarmed.

676
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,199
Astra had the drop on me.
She knew I was coming.

677
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,161
- And the gun?
- Is gone.

678
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,497
We'll figure out another way.

679
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:21,549
Hey, whatever really happened back there
with Astra, I'm sure it wasn't easy.

680
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,342
What are you talking about, big man?

681
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,970
Just so you know,
if I had "taken care" of Nora

682
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,597
back when we all thought
she was evil,

683
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,932
we wouldn't be happy
and together right now.

684
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:34,687
I had the chance to
pull the trigger to end all this...

685
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,190
but I couldn't do it.

686
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,444
What's all your grinning about?

687
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,614
I'm just happy there are
still good guys out there.

688
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,742
Even if one of them is
a Master of the Dark Arts.

689
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,827
You know, you're wrong about me, Ray.

690
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,539
But I will save Astra, and you
should know it's just as much for me

691
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,541
as it is for her. All right?

692
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,299
Hey, don't give Ava a hard time
for getting on stage, all right?

693
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,759
I don't want her to be too embarrassed.

694
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,594
[Mick] She's not gonna remember a thing.

695
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,847
Well, hello! Ha.

696
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:12,016
Where's my invite
to this party, huh, Mickey boy?

697
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,062
I spat in that. Old prison habit.

698
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,522
Mmm.

699
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:22,652
I cannot believe that I sang
in front of all those people.

700
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,570
I...

701
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,074
[exclaims] I was awesome.

702
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,368
I killed it.

703
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,662
And did you see my backup band?
They were like...

704
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,997
[imitates instruments and smooches]

705
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,000
Please.., please tell me
somebody got a video.

706
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,170
- Actually, we...
-[Sara] Mmm-mmm.

707
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:47,385
Mmm, and another thing.
Seriously, Sara, I love you so much.

708
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,638
Working that side mish with Rory
was way more fun

709
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,890
than running any stupid Time Bureau.

710
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,559
[slurs] Like, responsibilities?

711
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,601
Ha!

712
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,104
- Who needs them?
- Well, good, babe.

713
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,939
I'm glad you had fun.

714
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:04,193
Just know there's no small role
on this team. Right, Rory?

715
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:06,362
Right.

716
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,574
[snoring]

717
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:12,285
Okay. Night-night, sweetheart.

718
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,207
[exhaling heavily]

719
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,960
Look, there is more to Zari
than you give her credit for.

720
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:24,839
She's buried down deep inside
underneath all that fame.

721
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,090
You were getting played, man.

722
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,634
Don't feel bad.
She does this all the time.

723
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,429
- I know who you are.
- You do?

724
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,140
Yeah. The more we talked,
the more you looked familiar.

725
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,601
- Then I realized where I knew you from.
- The Waverider.

726
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:39,270
What's a Waverider? No. Heyworld.

727
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,815
Tell me that's not you there
in the star-spangled outfit.

728
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:45,901
In fact, you were both there.
That's totally you, Behrad.

729
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,778
Can't believe I never noticed it before.

730
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:51,157
What I don't get is
how Heyworld was 24 years ago,

731
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,451
but you two haven't aged a day.

732
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,328
What the hell is going on?

733
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,496
Zari, you've finally lost it.

734
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:02,168
You accuse me of being a fake,
but you're the one living a lie.

735
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,794
- Maman. Baba.
- Okay, shh.

736
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:06,088
- Just hang on.
- No, I will not hang on.

737
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:08,257
It's time they finally heard the truth.

738
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,933
What the hell? Where am I?
