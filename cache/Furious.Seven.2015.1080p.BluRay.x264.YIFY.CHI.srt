264

that no government would
ever admit to employing.

a necessary evil

269
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,536
until eventually

270
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,006

The powers that be

272
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,616
felt that he knew just
a little bit too much.

273
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,404
The asset became a liability.

274
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,490
So they sent in 20 elite
operatives to retire him.

275

is, you don't.

281
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,809
He killed Han.

282

Almost killed my family.

283
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,007
He also tried to put
me in a body bag, too.

284
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,766
Which is why when I get out, I'm
gonna put a hurt on him so bad

285
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,816

had kept her legs closed.

satellite, ATM machine and computer.

468
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,496
Simultaneously.

469
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,376
If it's got a
microphone or a lens,

470
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,176
God's Eye can find you.

471
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,696
So you invited me here to
show me a tracking device.

472
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,816
On steroids. Lots of them.

473
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,444
Let me put it to you this way.

474
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,176
It took us nearly a decade
to find Osama bin Laden.

475
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,567
With this, we'd have located
him anywhere on the planet

476
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,256
in a couple of hours.

477
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,856
Now, that's a serious
piece of machinery

478
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,803
that could be catastrophic
in the wrong hands.

479
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,336
But for some very nauseating
political reasons,

480
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,696
any rescue plans involving

481
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,656
any US government
forces or entity

482
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,648
has been strictly ruled out.

483
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,764
And that's why I need you.

484
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,522
But why do I need you?

485
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,936
I mean, I could
go back outside,

486
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,928
enjoy the rest of the Coronas,

487
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,049
let Shaw come to me.

488
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,851
You could do that. How's that
working out for you so far?

489
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,016
You got one friend
in the ground,

490
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,336
another one in the hospital.

491
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,736
And then, of course, there's
that little issue of the bomb

492
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,888
that destroyed your home.

493
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,936
Shaw lives in a
world that doesn't

494
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,883
play by your rules.

495
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,681
Like it or not,

496
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,161
you live in that
world now, too.

497
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,168
You wanna know how
to kill a shadow?

498
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,567
You just shine a
little light on it.

499
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,376
If you get the
God's Eye for me,

500
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,004
I've already got authorization

501
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,376
for you to use it
until you get Shaw.

502
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,416
You go from the
hunted to the hunter.

503
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,761
And there's no place on Earth
Shaw can hide from you.

504
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,684
More importantly,

505
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:40,563
you and your family don't
go to any more funerals.

506
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,206
You get Ramsey, you
get the God's Eye,

507
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,646
you get Shaw.

508
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,486
Well, that's the
wind-up and the pitch.

509
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,936
Now that I've given you
this incredibly sensitive

510
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,406
and highly classified
information,

511
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,000
what do you think, Toretto?

512
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,443
I think you already
know what I'm gonna do.

513
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,040
Good.

514
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,931
But it'll be my way.

515
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,856
And my crew.

516
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,928
I assumed you might say that.

517
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,727
Which is why I've taken the
Liberty of gathering your team.

518
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,322
This is crazy.

519
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,245
What the hell is
going on in here?

520
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,216
<font color="#804040">MR. NOBODY</font>: Our intelligence
suggests that Ramsey

521

522
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,936
through the Caucasus
mountain range.

523
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,136
If they clear this range and
reach their destination,

524
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,936
Ramsey is as good as gone.

get this straight.

526
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,776
There's only one road
that leads in or out,

527
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,896
sheer drops on every side,

528
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,616
a motorcade from hell
protected by a small army

529
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,165
from one mile in
either direction?

530
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,802
Yeah, that's about it.

531
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,005
You done? No, I'm not done.

532
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,256
So you all wanted
me to break into

533
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,884
a police station. Fine.

534
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,010
Then you asked me
to stop a tank.

535
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,924
I wasn't happy about
it, but I did it.

536
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,216
Then you came up with
this brilliant idea

537
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,736
to shoot down one of the
largest airplanes ever.

538
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,331
I shot that shit out
of the sky. Mmm.

539
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,841
It's nothing.

540
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,205
But this right
here, my friend,

happens to be

542
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,056
the stupidest idea I've
ever heard of in my life.

543
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,208
I forgot that you were the only
one to bring the plane down.

544
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,456
No, no. The only thing I've
ever seen him take down was.

gonna do that right here?

Okay.

It is impossible
to hit it there.

That is literally the most

Why? Because you cannot

See, that's what
makes it so sweet.

least expect us to hit them from.
