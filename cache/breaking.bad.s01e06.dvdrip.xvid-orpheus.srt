1
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:54,488
Let's get something straight.

2
00:00:54,613 --> 00:00:57,606
This, the chemistry,
is my realm.

3
00:00:57,831 --> 00:01:00,008
I am in charge of the cooking.

4
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:03,130
Out there on the street,
you deal with that.

5
00:01:05,842 --> 00:01:09,104
As far as our customers go,
I don't wanna know anything about them.

6
00:01:09,174 --> 00:01:11,800
I don't want to see them.
I don't want to hear from them.

7
00:01:11,803 --> 00:01:14,750
I want no interaction
with them whatsoever.

8
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,247
This operation is you and me,
and I'm the silent partner.

9
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:24,674
You got any issues
with that?

10
00:01:25,821 --> 00:01:27,336
Whatever, man.

11
00:01:33,924 --> 00:01:35,853
No matter what happens,

12
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:38,246
no more bloodshed.

13
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,066
No violence.

14
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:35,989
Walt?

15
00:02:37,162 --> 00:02:39,267
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.

16
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,368
Yeah. I'm okay.

17
00:02:42,838 --> 00:02:45,706
You know, honey,
you really don't have to...

18
00:02:47,386 --> 00:02:50,467
Look,
I like being here with you.

19
00:02:53,534 --> 00:02:55,389
I'm only saying that,

20
00:02:55,477 --> 00:02:58,874
I'd be okay with it, really,
if you want to go.

21
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:03,168
You know, actually,

22
00:03:03,205 --> 00:03:06,170
it would make me feel a little better
knowing that you were there

23
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:09,216
when Walter Jr.
gets home from school.

24
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,529
Okay.

25
00:03:16,103 --> 00:03:17,170
All right.

26
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:20,181
- You'll call me when you're finished?
- Oh, yeah.

27
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:26,624
And have you been
in touch with Elliott?

28
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:30,163
Because I haven't
seen a check from him.

29
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:32,107
Yes, I got it.

30
00:03:32,677 --> 00:03:34,599
- Really?
- It came, yeah.

31
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,729
Yeah, it came last week,

32
00:03:37,732 --> 00:03:41,419
and I put it right into
my credit union account, so...

33
00:03:42,283 --> 00:03:43,911
Taken care of it.

34
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:46,656
Good.

35
00:03:48,083 --> 00:03:50,113
So we're good. We're good.

36
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,334
Could you not deposit this

37
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,514
until Monday?

38
00:04:01,196 --> 00:04:02,173
Thank you.

39
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:04,875
Call if the discomfort's too much.

40
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:07,249
Otherwise,
we'll see you next week.

41
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:08,500
Yeah.

42
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:33,964
Chemical reactions
involve change on two levels:

43
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,956
matter and energy.

44
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,569
When a reaction is gradual,

45
00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:43,154
the change in energy is slight.

46
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,622
I mean, you don't even notice
the reaction is happening.

47
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:48,088
For example,

48
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,400
when rust collects
on the underside of a car.

49
00:04:57,426 --> 00:05:01,122
But if a reaction
happens quickly,

50
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:05,752
otherwise harmless substances
can interact in a way

51
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:09,772
that generates
enormous bursts of energy.

52
00:05:14,324 --> 00:05:17,430
Who can give me an example

53
00:05:17,444 --> 00:05:20,224
of rapid chemical reaction?

54
00:05:25,485 --> 00:05:27,652
Hint, hint. Right here.

55
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,329
Like an explosion?

56
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,646
Yes. Good.

57
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:34,371
Explosions.

58
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:37,128
Explosions are the result

59
00:05:37,354 --> 00:05:39,283
of chemical reactions

60
00:05:39,523 --> 00:05:42,054
happening almost
instantaneously.

61
00:05:42,304 --> 00:05:45,754
And the faster reactants,
i.e., explosives,

62
00:05:45,987 --> 00:05:49,357
and fulminative mercury
is a prime example of that,

63
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,666
the faster
they undergo change,

64
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:55,521
the more violent
the explosion.

65
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,179
So... explosions.

66
00:06:02,254 --> 00:06:05,464
Okay, listen. Why don't you
start reading on your own

67
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,935
from the top of chapter 7,
all right?

68
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:24,966
You okay?

69
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,370
I got it, Mr. White.

70
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:30,130
Don't worry.

71
00:06:30,443 --> 00:06:32,484
You got kids to teach.

72
00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:54,450
Thanks, Hugo.

73
00:07:06,107 --> 00:07:08,549
He's starting to lose weight,

74
00:07:08,743 --> 00:07:10,697
which is tough...

75
00:07:12,363 --> 00:07:13,666
to see that.

76
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:16,376
You know, to feel
the difference when I put my

77
00:07:16,418 --> 00:07:18,710
arms around him.

78
00:07:26,532 --> 00:07:29,262
- Can I talk to him?
- Of course.

79
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,587
Walt...

80
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:38,699
when you don't let me in,
when you don't tell me what's going on,

81
00:07:39,273 --> 00:07:43,063
I think it's like I feel like you don't
even want me around sometimes.

82
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:43,977
No.

83
00:07:44,952 --> 00:07:48,114
And recently these afternoons,

84
00:07:48,547 --> 00:07:51,079
when you're
coming home so late

85
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,702
and we're
just left wondering

86
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:55,653
where you are.

87
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,304
Yeah, Dad.

88
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:01,757
What's up with that?

89
00:08:03,254 --> 00:08:06,462
Walt,
is there anything else

90
00:08:06,938 --> 00:08:09,506
you're holding back
from your family?

91
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,283
Now's the time to share.

92
00:08:17,395 --> 00:08:18,397
Well...

93
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:26,359
I like to be alone,
I mean at times,

94
00:08:26,453 --> 00:08:29,033
and it's not
about you, really.

95
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:33,451
It's just that sometimes
it feels better

96
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:37,883
not to talk at all...

97
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:43,200
about anything,
to anyone.

98
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:47,125
Alone time can be helpful
for some types.

99
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:52,419
Maybe knowing what you do
when you're alone

100
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:56,115
might make it easier
for your family

101
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:00,096
to be more accepting
of whatever it is you do alone.

102
00:09:02,562 --> 00:09:03,652
Well...

103
00:09:05,773 --> 00:09:08,642
I like to go on walks

104
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:13,267
a couple of times a week,
maybe more, after work,

105
00:09:15,776 --> 00:09:19,308
And I really
enjoy the nature.

106
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:23,298
You know, the cacti,

107
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:27,444
the vegetation,
that kind of thing.

108
00:09:29,412 --> 00:09:33,395
It's really
very therapeutic.

109
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:05,329
Yo! You okay?

110
00:10:06,476 --> 00:10:09,645
- Did you breathe that shit?
- No. I'm just dizzy.

111
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:11,519
Come here.

112
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,655
- Sit down, sit down.
- I'm burning up.

113
00:10:14,685 --> 00:10:16,076
Take this off.

114
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,010
Sit down. Get some air.

115
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:23,769
Oh, God.

116
00:10:31,726 --> 00:10:33,366
Yeah, that's better.

117
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:41,543
When were you
going to tell me?

118
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:45,773
Tell you what?

119
00:10:46,565 --> 00:10:47,742
Cancer.

120
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:50,320
You got it, right?

121
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,244
How did you know?

122
00:10:59,306 --> 00:11:02,916
My aunt had one
of those dots on her,

123
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,533
to target the radiation.

124
00:11:05,571 --> 00:11:07,546
What is it, in your lung?

125
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:11,558
I'm your partner, man.
You should have told me.

126
00:11:11,946 --> 00:11:14,401
That's not cool,
okay? Not at all.

127
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:19,336
What stage are you?

128
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:22,115
3a.

129
00:11:24,756 --> 00:11:26,954
Gone to your lymph nodes.

130
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:40,551
Your aunt.

131
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:44,231
How bad was she
when they caught it?

132
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:47,709
Bad enough.
She didn't last long.

133
00:11:49,571 --> 00:11:50,548
How long?

134
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:52,590
Seven months.

135
00:11:59,373 --> 00:12:00,789
I get it now.

136
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,407
That's why
you're doing all this.

137
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,062
You want to make some cash for
your people before you check out.

138
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:09,319
- You got a problem with that?
- You tell me.

139
00:12:09,322 --> 00:12:13,184
You're the one that looks like you
just crawled out of a microwave.

140
00:12:18,624 --> 00:12:20,929
You going to be able
to finish the batch?

141
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:21,861
Yes.

142
00:12:23,058 --> 00:12:24,110
All right.

143
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:28,971
No.

144
00:12:30,988 --> 00:12:32,303
You do it.

145
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:36,045
Me?

146
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:38,003
Yeah.

147
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:42,205
What happened
to your mad skills?

148
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,863
Go on. Here.

149
00:12:50,495 --> 00:12:51,885
You do it.

150
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:57,161
You can do it.

151
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:05,762
If you have any questions,
I'll be right out here.

152
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,720
The next time, put an ice pack
on your head during chemo.

153
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:18,998
My aunt said it helped
with the hair loss.

154
00:13:56,024 --> 00:13:58,279
What's this? Christmas?

155
00:14:01,622 --> 00:14:04,876
This the one we found way out
in the boonies, the cook site?

156
00:14:08,353 --> 00:14:10,219
- Holy shit.
- What?

157
00:14:10,487 --> 00:14:12,679
Lab pulled up an imprint
of some old writing

158
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:15,488
that used to be on the inside.
Old Magic Marker or something.

159
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:16,985
Yeah? What's it say?

160
00:14:17,063 --> 00:14:19,832
"Property of J.P. Wynne
Chemistry Lab."

161
00:14:20,981 --> 00:14:22,685
That's Walt's school.

162
00:15:41,803 --> 00:15:44,183
We were supposed
to start at 3.

163
00:15:44,283 --> 00:15:47,314
I'm out there making
fat stacks, man. Chill.

164
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,224
Hey. Prepaid cell phone.
Use it.

165
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,678
- How much is this?
- 26 big ones.

166
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,490
Is that all? $26,000?

167
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:08,557
No, that's 26 hundred,

168
00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:11,175
and your share is 13,

169
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:14,086
minus 25 bucks for that phone.

170
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:18,020
- How much meth did you sell?
- Nearly an ounce.

171
00:16:22,451 --> 00:16:25,733
Last time I checked,
there were 16 ounces to a pound.

172
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:27,055
You smoked the rest?

173
00:16:27,092 --> 00:16:29,735
I've been out there
all night slinging crystal.

174
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:32,858
You think it's cake moving a pound
of meth one teenth at a time?

175
00:16:32,884 --> 00:16:35,020
Why are you selling it
in such small quanties?

176
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:37,547
Why don't you just sell
the whole pound at once?

177
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,680
To who? What do I
look like, Scarface?

178
00:16:39,727 --> 00:16:41,876
This is unacceptable.

179
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:44,288
I am breaking the law here.

180
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:46,787
This return is too little
for the risk.

181
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:49,194
I thought you'd be ready
for another pound today.

182
00:16:49,202 --> 00:16:50,972
You may know a lot
about chemistry,

183
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:53,875
but you don't know jack
about slinging dope.

184
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:58,010
Well, I'll tell you, I know
a lack of motivation when I see it.

185
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:03,232
You've got to be more
imaginative, you know?

186
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:06,013
Just think outside the box here.

187
00:17:06,376 --> 00:17:10,234
We have to move our product
in bulk, wholesale, now.

188
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:13,300
How do we do that?

189
00:17:15,091 --> 00:17:17,635
- What do you mean, to a distributor?
- Yes. Yes.

190
00:17:17,655 --> 00:17:19,960
That's what we need.
We need a distributor now.

191
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,957
Do you know
anyone like that?

192
00:17:21,982 --> 00:17:25,360
Yeah, I mean I used to
until you killed him.

193
00:17:38,838 --> 00:17:42,753
So who took Krazy-8's place?

194
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:45,198
Some guy named Tuco.

195
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:47,841
A bad ass, from what I hear.

196
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:51,631
Tuco, okay. So then
just go talk to Tuco.

197
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:53,222
Right. Like,

198
00:17:53,231 --> 00:17:55,622
"Hello, sir. Hey, I know
you don't know me,

199
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,535
"but would you be interested in
a felony quantity of methamphetamine?"

200
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:01,804
Well, yes, but maybe with a little more
salesmanship, perhaps?

201
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:04,015
You just don't get it, man.
This guy's O.G.

202
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:05,763
What does that mean?

203
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:07,862
Jesus, look,
he's upper level, man.

204
00:18:07,864 --> 00:18:11,246
He's not going to do business
with some dude he doesn't know.

205
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,379
You don't understand
the way it works.

206
00:18:13,387 --> 00:18:16,491
You can't just bum rush
some high-level ice man

207
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,403
and start cutting deals,
okay?

208
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:20,428
It's risky.
You need an intro.

209
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,422
You need
someone to vouch.

210
00:18:22,638 --> 00:18:24,633
Well, who introduced you
to Krazy-8?

211
00:18:24,643 --> 00:18:27,549
Emilio. That's only because
I knew him from, like, third grade.

212
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,247
- We can't talk to Emilio, either...
- All right, all right.

213
00:18:31,386 --> 00:18:34,752
Look, I'm telling you,
Mr. White, it's too risky.

214
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,196
Okay?
I mean, we're making money.

215
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:41,174
Why can't you just be satisfied
with the way it is?

216
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,049
Jesus!

217
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,287
Just grow
some fucking balls!

218
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,547
Wait till Monday again?

219
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,696
Yes, please. Thank you.

220
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:01,835
Mr. White.

221
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:09,706
Thank you, Hugo.

222
00:20:35,203 --> 00:20:37,198
- Knock-knock.
- Oh, hey.

223
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:40,102
- How are you feeling, Walt?
- Good.

224
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:44,228
Are you up
for having a visitor?

225
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:45,823
Hey, buddy.

226
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:48,223
Hank.

227
00:20:48,438 --> 00:20:50,222
Let me know
if you need anything.

228
00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:52,885
- I will. Thank you, Carmen.
- No problem.

229
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,188
Damn.

230
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:57,875
That chick's got
an ass like an onion.

231
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,615
Makes me want to cry.

232
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:03,827
So what are you doing here?

233
00:21:04,121 --> 00:21:07,027
Well, I had some questions
I wanted to run by you,

234
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:08,494
work-related.

235
00:21:08,691 --> 00:21:12,173
- You okay? I could come back later.
- No, no, no, no. I'm fine.

236
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:13,820
Everything's fine.

237
00:21:14,526 --> 00:21:17,081
What do you mean
work-related, though?

238
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,110
Do you recognize that?

239
00:21:25,088 --> 00:21:25,915
No.

240
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:30,700
That was used to cook meth.

241
00:21:31,573 --> 00:21:35,284
Found that on some Indian land
about 40 miles from here.

242
00:21:35,534 --> 00:21:38,578
Old label on the inside
used to say...

243
00:21:39,893 --> 00:21:41,824
J.P. Wynne Chemistry Lab.

244
00:21:41,924 --> 00:21:43,026
Really?

245
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:46,034
I don't understand
how that came from here.

246
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:49,412
I was hoping you could help me.
We found it near an abandoned car

247
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:51,787
belonging to one of our snitches.

248
00:21:54,528 --> 00:21:55,792
A snitch?

249
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:58,498
Yeah, one of our
confidential informants.

250
00:21:58,598 --> 00:22:00,808
Went missing a while back.
No body yet,

251
00:22:00,817 --> 00:22:03,264
but we're pretty sure
he's, you know...

252
00:22:03,442 --> 00:22:07,378
Probably chopped up in little pieces
and fed to the buzzards.

253
00:22:09,381 --> 00:22:13,205
Anyway, any respirators like that
go missing lately?

254
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:16,163
No. No.

255
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:20,132
No, I mean,
not that I know of.

256
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:22,537
I'll need to take a look
at that inventory.

257
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:25,142
Sure. I got a list
hanging on the wall.

258
00:22:25,295 --> 00:22:27,650
You mind if I take a look
at your storeroom?

259
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,732
Not at all, no. Be my guest.

260
00:22:34,613 --> 00:22:35,964
Right. So who's got keys?

261
00:22:36,363 --> 00:22:38,856
Well, the science faculty,
the staff,

262
00:22:38,873 --> 00:22:41,900
Carmen, the vice principal
has the master,

263
00:22:41,906 --> 00:22:43,288
and me.

264
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,386
How about students?

265
00:22:45,987 --> 00:22:46,992
No, no.

266
00:22:47,112 --> 00:22:48,665
No students have keys.

267
00:22:49,126 --> 00:22:50,363
I should hope not.

268
00:22:50,373 --> 00:22:53,369
My question is do any know
where you keep them?

269
00:22:53,976 --> 00:22:55,787
I don't think so. No.

270
00:22:55,817 --> 00:22:58,701
Besides, I keep them right here
in my pocket anyway, so...

271
00:22:58,763 --> 00:23:01,305
Walt, look, I know they're
your students, but,

272
00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:04,184
do not underestimate them.
Big mistake.

273
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,363
Are there
any other respirators?

274
00:23:06,433 --> 00:23:07,483
Uh, no.

275
00:23:07,493 --> 00:23:10,508
Because I'm counting six.
Inventory says eight.

276
00:23:14,191 --> 00:23:16,174
Glassware looking
a little sparse.

277
00:23:16,237 --> 00:23:17,734
- Is it?
- Yeah.

278
00:23:18,046 --> 00:23:21,904
You're missing a couple of
Erlenmeyer flasks at least.

279
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:24,110
Oh, yeah.

280
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:28,295
A 5,000 milliliter
round bottom.

281
00:23:28,562 --> 00:23:31,342
Meth heads love
to brew in this, baby.

282
00:23:32,935 --> 00:23:34,381
Going to answer that?

283
00:23:34,597 --> 00:23:36,706
No, it's just...
No, I don't...

284
00:23:36,757 --> 00:23:39,133
Maybe it's Skyler.
She's in trouble or something.

285
00:23:39,154 --> 00:23:43,069
Don't ignore it on my account.
Answer it! C'mon, I got stuff to do.

286
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:45,061
- Jeez.
- Okay.

287
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:47,707
Hello.

288
00:23:47,937 --> 00:23:49,797
Yo. What's up, Mr. W?

289
00:23:51,078 --> 00:23:52,256
Speaking.

290
00:23:52,358 --> 00:23:54,854
- Bad time to talk?
- Absolutely.

291
00:23:54,971 --> 00:23:56,606
All right,
so just listen.

292
00:23:56,694 --> 00:23:59,805
You know that guy
we were talking about, Tuco?

293
00:23:59,937 --> 00:24:01,860
Turns out my boy
Skinny Pete

294
00:24:01,865 --> 00:24:04,669
was in the same cellblock with him
over at Los Lunas.

295
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,329
So we got our in.

296
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,496
We're hauling a pound
to the dude right now.

297
00:24:10,078 --> 00:24:11,185
Okay, then.

298
00:24:11,196 --> 00:24:13,711
Thank you very much for calling.

299
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:19,301
My doctor is very solicitous.

300
00:24:19,956 --> 00:24:22,926
Look, buddy, the last thing I want to do
is get you in hot water,

301
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:26,139
but some meth monkey
had a feeding frenzy in here, okay?

302
00:24:26,244 --> 00:24:28,784
You got to keep a better
watch over your turf.

303
00:24:28,848 --> 00:24:30,038
I will.

304
00:24:30,478 --> 00:24:33,973
We don't want people
to start wondering about you, right?

305
00:24:40,894 --> 00:24:42,071
Right. No.

306
00:24:42,497 --> 00:24:43,987
Right. Absolutely not.

307
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:49,758
So you're sure you're
tight with this guy?

308
00:24:49,762 --> 00:24:52,020
Two nuts in a ball sack, yo.

309
00:25:09,004 --> 00:25:11,158
Yo, man, I'm Skinny Pete!

310
00:25:19,915 --> 00:25:22,908
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea, yo. Come on.

311
00:25:27,476 --> 00:25:29,543
Atta man.
That's what's happening.

312
00:25:43,004 --> 00:25:44,958
Yo, Tuco's expecting us.

313
00:25:55,395 --> 00:25:58,050
No need, man.
Me and Tuco go back.

314
00:26:12,264 --> 00:26:15,133
Tuco. What's happening,
my brother?

315
00:26:21,396 --> 00:26:23,220
Sick crib, yo.

316
00:26:23,225 --> 00:26:25,482
You been keeping it real
since you been sprung.

317
00:26:25,487 --> 00:26:27,379
What's it been,
like a year?

318
00:26:27,581 --> 00:26:29,392
- This your boy?
- Yeah, Jesse.

319
00:26:29,428 --> 00:26:31,884
The dude with the glass
I was telling you about.

320
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,598
Hey, man.
Yeah, I've heard a lot about you.

321
00:26:35,285 --> 00:26:36,850
Break out the ice.

322
00:26:53,544 --> 00:26:54,697
Take a bump.

323
00:26:54,704 --> 00:26:56,784
No worries, man.
I'm no cop.

324
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:00,283
I said hit it.

325
00:27:03,151 --> 00:27:04,241
All right.

326
00:27:20,131 --> 00:27:23,778
This kicks like a mule
with his balls wrapped in duct tape.

327
00:27:25,238 --> 00:27:27,706
- Where'd you get it?
- I cooked it.

328
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,487
Bullshit!

329
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,362
Who you working for?

330
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,942
No one, man. I mean,
I have a partner that I cook with,

331
00:27:37,972 --> 00:27:39,495
but that's it.

332
00:27:42,365 --> 00:27:43,560
All right.

333
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,122
We got a deal.

334
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:50,328
See? I told you
Tuco would hook you up.

335
00:27:50,448 --> 00:27:51,313
Cool.

336
00:27:51,915 --> 00:27:53,719
I haven't said how much.

337
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:04,789
All right. How much?

338
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,514
35 large for the pound.

339
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:14,850
Well, you're
a little light, ese.

340
00:28:18,587 --> 00:28:20,997
It's all right. Don't sweat it.
It's all good.

341
00:28:21,011 --> 00:28:23,568
It's good.
Walk. Get out of here.

342
00:28:24,442 --> 00:28:27,031
- What about the money?
- You'll get it.

343
00:28:27,302 --> 00:28:29,607
This is a consignment operation.

344
00:28:30,656 --> 00:28:33,299
You want me to float 35 G's?

345
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:37,544
You don't trust me?

346
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:41,120
No, no. Hey, it's not that, man.
It's just, you know, I don't...

347
00:28:41,208 --> 00:28:43,042
I don't do business that way.

348
00:28:43,061 --> 00:28:45,683
Tough shit!
The deal is done!

349
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,047
You said this was cool.

350
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,198
Get money for meth.
Cash up front.

351
00:28:52,306 --> 00:28:55,244
Don't front, dude.
Tuco's good for it.

352
00:28:55,624 --> 00:28:58,562
I don't need your punk ass
to vouch for me!

353
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:04,054
Come on!

354
00:29:05,547 --> 00:29:06,862
Oh, come on!

355
00:29:19,003 --> 00:29:22,988
All right, you brought me
some really clean crystal.

356
00:29:25,901 --> 00:29:28,469
Do you really
want your money up front?

357
00:29:52,147 --> 00:29:53,512
Up front.

358
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:25,541
Nobody moves crystal

359
00:30:25,544 --> 00:30:28,248
in the South Valley but me, bitch!

360
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,704
Good morning, Hugo.

361
00:30:52,051 --> 00:30:54,857
Don't mind if
I call you Hugo... Hugo.

362
00:30:59,105 --> 00:31:01,660
We've never had a crowd
on the street like that.

363
00:31:01,855 --> 00:31:03,609
Is that Uncle Hank?

364
00:31:08,984 --> 00:31:11,740
Uncle Hank's arresting
Mr. Archuleta.

365
00:31:12,465 --> 00:31:15,373
This doesn't make any sense
to me at all. I don't understand.

366
00:31:15,569 --> 00:31:19,051
I got two words for you:
background check. How about that?

367
00:31:21,003 --> 00:31:24,340
Yo, yo, yo. 148-3369,

368
00:31:24,428 --> 00:31:26,031
representing the ABQ.

369
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:27,423
What up, biatch?

370
00:31:27,473 --> 00:31:29,234
Leave it at the tone.

371
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,720
Where the hell are you?
Call me back.

372
00:31:33,364 --> 00:31:35,182
- Hey, Walt.
- Yeah?

373
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,613
Hank's about to deal.

374
00:31:37,714 --> 00:31:40,195
Okay. I'll be right there.

375
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:49,469
All right. Let's see
what the turn brings us.

376
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,639
You're looking good, Walt.

377
00:31:52,705 --> 00:31:54,137
Your color's better.

378
00:31:54,152 --> 00:31:56,184
Yeah? Thanks.

379
00:31:56,322 --> 00:31:59,221
He's actually on
the pretty strong stuff now.

380
00:31:59,553 --> 00:32:03,139
Dr. Delcavoli's trying to talk him into
taking some time off from work, but...

381
00:32:03,151 --> 00:32:06,026
Well, actually, I just
talked to Carmen this morning,

382
00:32:06,064 --> 00:32:08,995
and they're getting
a substitute for a few weeks.

383
00:32:09,668 --> 00:32:12,522
I just didn't have a chance
to tell you. Sorry.

384
00:32:12,685 --> 00:32:14,300
Your bet, tough guy.

385
00:32:14,593 --> 00:32:15,620
Check.

386
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,149
Yeah. Check.

387
00:32:18,476 --> 00:32:20,225
Check's in the mail.

388
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:22,518
10 million.

389
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:24,297
Red's 25 million.
Blue's 10.

390
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,321
Then 25 million
because that's how I roll.

391
00:32:27,534 --> 00:32:30,561
Hey, Uncle Hank,
why were you arresting

392
00:32:30,674 --> 00:32:33,195
Mr. Archuleta the other day?

393
00:32:33,356 --> 00:32:34,785
He's a pretty cool guy.

394
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:37,982
Well, turns out
that he has a record.

395
00:32:38,185 --> 00:32:40,415
Yeah. Couple
of possession beefs.

396
00:32:40,874 --> 00:32:44,432
We figure he was the guy that was
stealing your school's chemistry gear.

397
00:32:44,552 --> 00:32:46,669
I mean, you know,
he had a key.

398
00:32:46,995 --> 00:32:48,510
Fit the profile.

399
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,124
When we searched his truck,
we found a big old fat blunt,

400
00:32:52,412 --> 00:32:55,670
which goes to prove old Huge Hugo
ain't so cool after all.

401
00:32:55,757 --> 00:32:57,155
It's to you, Walt.

402
00:32:57,205 --> 00:32:59,535
Yeah, I'll call.

403
00:33:00,115 --> 00:33:02,018
I can't believe
the school system

404
00:33:02,033 --> 00:33:04,047
didn't know
about this guy's record.

405
00:33:04,074 --> 00:33:05,978
I mean, that's pretty scary.

406
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:08,581
How could something like that
just slip through the cracks?

407
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:11,422
I don't know. I mean,
for what it's worth,

408
00:33:11,797 --> 00:33:14,690
Hugo just doesn't strike me
as the thief.

409
00:33:14,954 --> 00:33:17,366
Yeah, well, nothing
personal, Walt, but

410
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:21,280
you wouldn't know a criminal if he was
close enough to check you for a hernia.

411
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:25,713
Now, that said,
we got a search warrant,

412
00:33:25,722 --> 00:33:27,964
and we tore
old Hugo's house apart.

413
00:33:28,036 --> 00:33:30,617
Turns out he's
a major league pothead.

414
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:33,793
But he didn't
raid your chemistry set.

415
00:33:33,868 --> 00:33:35,484
You hiding something?

416
00:33:41,803 --> 00:33:42,803
I'm in.

417
00:33:42,851 --> 00:33:45,183
And the river card.

418
00:33:47,727 --> 00:33:49,794
Yeah, I got nothing.
I'm out.

419
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,147
I'm out.

420
00:33:54,729 --> 00:33:55,694
Yowsa!

421
00:33:56,553 --> 00:34:00,251
When old "holes in her purse" bails,
you know you're in deep.

422
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:03,176
Looks like it's
you and me, buddy.

423
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,278
What's going to happen
to him? Hugo.

424
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,345
Well, I mean, he's going to lose
his job, like he should.

425
00:34:10,596 --> 00:34:14,503
Probably spend a couple months
in County, as it's not his first rap.

426
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:17,705
I'm waiting.

427
00:34:20,144 --> 00:34:22,615
You going to man up,
or you're going to puss out?

428
00:34:22,678 --> 00:34:23,492
Hank.

429
00:34:25,165 --> 00:34:26,480
What? Sorry.

430
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:31,789
I'm all in.

431
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,193
No.

432
00:34:37,224 --> 00:34:41,157
You bad, bad, bad,
horrible liar.

433
00:34:42,563 --> 00:34:44,580
What are you smoking
there, huh?

434
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,964
You got a heart?
You got the flush, don't you?

435
00:34:53,152 --> 00:34:56,291
Nope. Not falling for it,
buddy. I fold.

436
00:34:58,184 --> 00:35:00,131
Talk about anti-climactic.

437
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,762
Your cards couldn't
have been that bad.

438
00:35:02,836 --> 00:35:05,765
Oh, my God.
You threw away an ace...

439
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:09,150
- What are you doing? Don't.
- ...and a cowboy, for...

440
00:35:14,275 --> 00:35:16,154
A handful of nothing.

441
00:36:17,222 --> 00:36:18,513
Who is this?

442
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:20,743
I was dialing Jesse Pinkman.

443
00:36:23,941 --> 00:36:25,883
Well, where is he, then?

444
00:36:40,428 --> 00:36:41,718
You the guy?

445
00:36:42,572 --> 00:36:44,350
Yeah, I'm the guy.

446
00:36:49,966 --> 00:36:51,239
How is he?

447
00:36:52,483 --> 00:36:54,907
Got some busted ribs
and like that.

448
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:58,482
Got messed up
pretty good.

449
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,586
I was all like
"Damn, Tuco, chill, ese."

450
00:37:03,453 --> 00:37:06,258
I don't know what got into him.
Seriously.

451
00:37:08,872 --> 00:37:11,399
Oh, he's out, man,
way out.

452
00:37:12,211 --> 00:37:14,591
They got him doped up
big-time.

453
00:37:20,357 --> 00:37:22,436
So you're the cook, huh?

454
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:26,253
Yo, I didn't
catch your name.

455
00:37:40,362 --> 00:37:42,479
Tell me about this Tuco.

456
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:45,802
Tell me everything about him.

457
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:30,536
Good morning.

458
00:39:33,655 --> 00:39:35,622
Would you
pass the butter, please?

459
00:39:38,029 --> 00:39:39,645
Bad ass, Dad.

460
00:40:32,779 --> 00:40:34,041
You Tuco?

461
00:40:39,518 --> 00:40:43,038
I want to talk to Tuco,
and I'm not leaving until I do.

462
00:42:07,896 --> 00:42:09,394
What's your name?

463
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:11,719
Heisenberg.

464
00:42:11,993 --> 00:42:13,484
Heisenberg.

465
00:42:14,489 --> 00:42:15,354
Okay.

466
00:42:16,163 --> 00:42:18,205
Have a seat, Heisenberg.

467
00:42:19,025 --> 00:42:21,710
I don't imagine
I'll be here very long.

468
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,133
No?

469
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:25,409
All right.

470
00:42:27,402 --> 00:42:28,679
Be that way.

471
00:42:31,259 --> 00:42:32,900
It's your meeting.

472
00:42:32,995 --> 00:42:36,427
Why don't you start talking
and tell me what you want?

473
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:38,897
$50,000.

474
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,643
Oh, man! 50 G's?

475
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:45,367
How you figure that?

476
00:42:45,372 --> 00:42:47,842
35 for the pound
of meth you stole

477
00:42:47,992 --> 00:42:51,199
and another 15 for my partner's
pain and suffering.

478
00:42:56,775 --> 00:42:57,752
Partner.

479
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:08,297
Oh, yeah. I remember
that little bitch.

480
00:43:09,278 --> 00:43:11,319
So you must be Daddy.

481
00:43:19,951 --> 00:43:21,767
Let me get this straight.

482
00:43:23,636 --> 00:43:26,041
I steal your dope, hmm?

483
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,623
I beat the piss
out of your mule boy!

484
00:43:31,422 --> 00:43:35,356
And then you walk in here,
and you bring me more meth?

485
00:43:39,254 --> 00:43:41,529
That's a brilliant plan, ese.

486
00:43:41,655 --> 00:43:42,719
Brilliant.

487
00:43:44,443 --> 00:43:46,722
You got one part
of that wrong.

488
00:43:51,289 --> 00:43:53,744
This is not meth.

489
00:44:21,456 --> 00:44:22,909
Are you nuts?

490
00:44:23,124 --> 00:44:24,840
You want to find out?

491
00:44:25,543 --> 00:44:27,807
No-Doze, Gonzo, calma!

492
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:30,014
Calma. Calma.

493
00:44:32,646 --> 00:44:34,275
You got balls.

494
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:36,138
I'll give you that.

495
00:44:36,263 --> 00:44:37,813
All right. All right.

496
00:44:38,038 --> 00:44:39,867
I'll give you your money.

497
00:44:43,836 --> 00:44:47,798
That crystal that your
partner brought me,

498
00:44:48,773 --> 00:44:50,734
it sold faster

499
00:44:51,236 --> 00:44:53,397
than $10 ass in TJ.

500
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:59,204
What say you bring me

501
00:44:59,605 --> 00:45:01,471
another pound next week?

502
00:45:04,686 --> 00:45:06,268
Money up front.

503
00:45:06,577 --> 00:45:07,616
All right.

504
00:45:09,135 --> 00:45:10,738
Money up front.

505
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,399
Sometimes you got to rob
to keep your riches.

506
00:45:20,023 --> 00:45:22,916
Just as long as we
got an understanding.

507
00:45:25,778 --> 00:45:28,004
One pound
is not going to cut it.

508
00:45:28,245 --> 00:45:30,052
You have to take two.

509
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:37,814
Orale.

510
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,312
What is that shit?

511
00:45:44,323 --> 00:45:46,289
Fulminated mercury.

512
00:45:47,626 --> 00:45:49,931
A little tweak of chemistry.
