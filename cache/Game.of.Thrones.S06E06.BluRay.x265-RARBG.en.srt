he'll take you in.

I told them I met you in the North.

The thing is...

60

My father doesn't like wildlings.

61

He hoped I'd make a man of myself
by "killing some bloody wildlings,"

165

It's hard to walk in this.

You're beautiful.

168
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:26,218
This venison, it's very tasty.

169
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,846
Is it from today's hunt?

170
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,932
Well, no.
We haven't been able to cure that one yet.

171
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,852
This is last week's.

172
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,520
Oh, uh... <i>(CHUCKLES)</i>

173
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,689
Of course. Sorry.

- Long journey.
- <i>(GIGGLES)</i>

175
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:42,860
Brought it down from 70 yards.

176
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:43,986
One shot.

177
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:48,532
Oh! That's a fair distance.

178
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,368
So do you do much hunting up at the Wall?

179
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:53,829
Oh, yes. Yes.

180
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:55,747
A good amount.

181
00:15:56,915 --> 00:16:00,502
North of the Wall,
you don't hunt, you don't eat.

182
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:03,906
Mostly deer, or is it elk as well?

183
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:06,675
Rabbits.

184
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,345
Sometimes squirrels.

185
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:17,227
I say "we," it's my friend Jon mostly.

186
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,062
Sometimes Edd.

187
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,190
And Gilly.

188
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,151
She's quite a good hunter as well.

189
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:26,737
Huntress.

190
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:29,948
LADY TARLY: I imagine
it's common where you're from.

191
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:33,410
We once met a man, Lord Umber
from Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll?

192
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:35,787
Who said he taught all his daughters
how to hunt.

193
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:38,290
TALLA: Your father taught you to hunt?

194
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,459
Our father would never teach us.

195
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:44,254
I think our father
could learn a thing or two from your father.

196
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,631
That's enough of that.

197
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:50,778
Samwell, would you care for more bread?

198
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:51,929
Oh, um...

199
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:55,098
Yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother.

200
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:00,896
Not fat enough already?

201
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,578
I traveled south under orders
from the Lord Commander.

202
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,789
- He wants me to...
- I read your letter.

203
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,501
You're to be a maester.

204
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,961
Yes.

205
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:28,799
And once I have my chain,
I'll return to Castle Black.

206
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,927
I thought the Night's Watch
might make a man of you.

207
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:35,556
Something resembling a man at least.

208
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:40,644
You managed to stay soft and fat.

209
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:45,941
Your nose buried in books.

210
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,987
Spending your life reading
about the achievements of better men.

211
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,282
I'll wager you still can't sit a horse
or wield a sword.

212
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:56,451
Randyll, to be Maester of the Night's Watch
is a great honor.

213
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,704
He can wield a sword.

214
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,124
He killed a Thenn.

215
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,627
He killed a White Walker.

216
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:07,588
<i>(LAUGHING)</i>

218
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:14,261
I saw it with my own eyes
on our way down to Castle Black.

219
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:18,015
He drove a dagger into the Walker's heart.

220
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:21,810
He risked his own life
to save mine more than once.

221
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:25,063
He's a greater warrior
than either of you will ever be.

222
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,444
Your way down to Castle Black?

223
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:35,782
Where did he kill a White Walker?

224
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:40,245
Where are you from?

225
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:42,706
How'd you come to meet my son?

226
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,252
The Night's Watch came to our keep.

227
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:49,421
- Where?
- Gilly.

228
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,548
- North of the Wall.
- North of the Wall?

229
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,804
You're a wildling.

230
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:09,483
The Seven Kingdoms have waged war
against these savages for centuries,

231
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:13,153
and here I sit, hosting one in my hall,

232
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,073
thanks to my son.

233
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,077
See that sword?

234
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,665
It's called Heartsbane.

235
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:29,711
It's been in our family for 500 years.

236
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:32,255
It's Valyrian steel.

237
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,675
Only a handful of them left in the world.

238
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,970
It's supposed to go to
my firstborn son after I die.

239
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,097
To him.

240
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:45,018
He will never wield that sword.

241
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:50,899
If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill,
it would be the end of this house.

242
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,905
I took you for a Mole's Town whore
when I saw you,

243
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,782
and I made my peace with that.

244
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:00,534
Who else would have him?

245
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:04,162
But I overestimated him.

246
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,623
No.

247
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:13,046
It was a wildling whore that seduced my son.

248
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,509
This you getting back at me, boy?

249
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:20,971
Hmm?

250
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,974
Bringing that to my table
and making me dine with it?

You're not worthy of her.

260
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,386
To please her, I'll take the wildling in.
She can work in the kitchens.

261
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,181

and your king faithfully for many years.

488
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:06,220
And you will continue to do so.

489
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:09,765
But not in this city.

490
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:16,272
You've lost it?

491
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:19,692
BLACK WALDER: Yes, Father.

492
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:22,820
It's a castle, not a bloody sheep.

493
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:25,781
Presumably you still know where it is.

494
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:28,075
You didn't lose Riverrun.

495
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:30,119
You let the Blackfish take it from you.

496
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:33,414
He surprised us.
He knows the castle better than anyone.

497
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:36,625
You did lose the Blackfish
after the Red Wedding.

498
00:39:37,001 --> 00:39:39,795
You had him right here in this hall,
and you let him leave.

499
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:41,964
And when I told you
to hunt him down and kill him,

500
00:39:42,006 --> 00:39:43,757
you couldn't find him.

501
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:45,968
That's what it means to lose something.

502
00:39:46,302 --> 00:39:49,346
Now he's come back and taken Riverrun.

503
00:39:50,306 --> 00:39:51,783
I don't think it's fair to blame us...

504
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:54,935
For 300 years we kissed Tully boots,

505
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:58,981
swore oaths to them
and their stinking fish banners.

506
00:39:59,023 --> 00:40:01,650
Not again. Riverrun is ours.

507
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:03,903
Take it back.

508
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:05,487
We don't have the men.

509
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:08,949
We've got 10 times as many men
as the damn Blackfish.

510
00:40:08,991 --> 00:40:12,036
BLACK WALDER: The Mallisters have risen
against us. And the Blackwoods.

511
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:15,331
LOTHAR: The Brotherhood Without Banners
is rallying the commoners against us,

512
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:17,458
raiding our supply trains and camps.

513
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:20,461
BLACK WALDER: Riverrun can withstand
a siege for a year.

514
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:24,006
If I want excuses, I'll put her in charge.

515
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:25,841
They're laughing at us.

516
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:29,595
All across the Riverlands,
right down to King's Landing,

517
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:31,180
they're laughing at us.

518
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:33,349
I hear it in my sleep!

519
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:37,728
I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you.

520
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:42,191
And I'll not leave this world
until they all choke on that laughter.

521
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:44,026
Take that castle back.

522
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,280
He'll never yield, Father.

523
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:49,615
Oh!

524
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:50,866
He'll yield.

525
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:58,415
You'll show him the knife you used

526
00:40:58,499 --> 00:41:02,211
to kill Robb Stark's child
in its whore mother's belly,

527
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:04,380
and you'll show him the knife you used

528
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,715
to open his niece's throat.

529
00:41:06,757 --> 00:41:09,009
And you'll remind him who it was

530
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:13,180
that got married
at the Red Wedding in the first place.

531
00:41:13,222 --> 00:41:14,515
His nephew.

532
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,408
Cheer up, Lord Edmure.

533
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:34,743
You're going home.

534
00:41:35,077 --> 00:41:38,664
I'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish.

535
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:41,125
Apparently Walder Frey
can't manage it on his own

536
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:43,252
because he's 400 years old.

537
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:47,631
Sent me with an army to the Riverlands
and a siege that could last months.

538
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:51,969
Better you're elsewhere at the head of an army
than in the Sept dungeons.

539
00:41:53,095 --> 00:41:55,931
- I'm not going to the Riverlands.
- <i>(POURING)</i>

540
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,143
What, then?

541
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:03,063
I'm going to give Bronn
the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen

542
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:06,442
and have him gather
the best killers he knows.

543
00:42:06,525 --> 00:42:09,737
I'll take them to the Sept,
and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head

544
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:11,739
and every other Sparrow head I can find.

545
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,906
You can't.

546
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:15,367
He has our son! He stole our son!

547
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:17,536
He's torn our family apart.

548
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:19,872
How should we treat people
who tear us apart?

549
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:24,626
We should treat them without mercy,
and we will.

550
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,063
But if you kill the High Sparrow,
you won't leave the Sept alive.

551
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:29,423
And without you, this is all for nothing.

552
00:42:30,758 --> 00:42:33,844
Stand at the head of our army
where you belong,

553
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:36,221
where Father wanted you.

554
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:38,599
Show our men where their loyalties belong.

555
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,559
Show them what Lannisters are,

556
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:43,854
what we do to our enemies.

557
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:48,650
And take that stupid little castle back
because it's ours and because you can.

558
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:51,820
You'll stand trial soon.
I need to be here for you.

559
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:55,324
It will be a trial by combat.

560
00:42:56,617 --> 00:42:58,911
I have the Mountain.

561
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:03,165
They've made us both stronger, all of them.

562
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,835
They have no idea how strong we are.

563
00:43:07,628 --> 00:43:09,213
No idea what we're going to do to them.

564
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:22,601
We've always been together.

565
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:25,312
We'll always be together.

566
00:43:25,354 --> 00:43:27,689
We're the only two people in the world.

567
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:49,586
Why did you help us?

568
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:54,091
The three-eyed raven sent for me.

569
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:55,300
The three-eyed raven's dead.

570
00:43:56,552 --> 00:43:57,719
Now he lives again.

573
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:13,402
When I last saw you, you were a boy.

574
00:44:14,778 --> 00:44:16,572
A fearless boy.

575
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:19,575
Loved to climb the castle walls,
frighten his mother.

576
00:44:20,868 --> 00:44:21,910
Who are you?

577
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:41,305
Uncle Benjen.

578
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:46,101
The last letter Jon wrote me
said you had been lost beyond the Wall.

579
00:44:49,313 --> 00:44:54,109
I led a ranging party deep into the North
to find White Walkers.

580
00:44:54,193 --> 00:44:55,277
They found us.

581
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:59,865
A White Walker stabbed me in the gut
with a sword of ice.

582
00:45:02,868 --> 00:45:04,369
Left me there to die.

583
00:45:04,453 --> 00:45:05,704
To turn.

584
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:08,207
The Children found me.

585
00:45:09,124 --> 00:45:11,627
Stopped the Walker's magic from taking hold.

586
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:13,003
How?

587
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:15,422
The same way they made the Walkers
in the first place.

588
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:16,798
You saw it yourself.

589
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,968
Dragonglass.

590
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:23,722
A shard of dragonglass
plunged into your heart.

591
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:28,977
You are the three-eyed raven now.

592
00:45:29,478 --> 00:45:31,813
I didn't have time to learn.
I can't control anything.

593
00:45:34,942 --> 00:45:38,820
You must learn to control it
before the Night King comes.

594
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:42,824
Drink.

595

One way or another,

596
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:51,208
he will find his way to the world of men.

597
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:53,877
When he does,

598
00:45:53,961 --> 00:45:56,838
you will be there waiting for him.

A week at best.

Dothraki and all their horses,

1,000 ships easily.

- And who has that many?
