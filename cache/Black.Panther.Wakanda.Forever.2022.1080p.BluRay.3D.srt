1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,880
Bast...

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,720
time is running out.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,180
Please allow me to heal my brother
of this illness...

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,510
and I will never
question your existence again.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,100
His heart rate is dropping fast.
Where are we?

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,480
We are finishing a sequence now.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,230
GRIOT, give me the controls.

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,600
As you wish, Princess.

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,900
What is the confidence rate?

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,610
25%.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,200
We'll have to try another way.

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,790
King T'Challa's heart rate
has fallen to 31 beats per minute.

13
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,410
Princess, you should go be by his side.

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,120
I have to think.
Everyone, get out.

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,540
Get out!

16
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,760
What is the confidence rate?

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,300
29.1%.

18
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,510
Print it!

19
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,150
Princess, I am aware of the urgency,
but I must warn you...

20
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,110
this synthetic Heart-Shaped Herb...

21
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,480
has a minimal chance of
producing the desired effects.

22
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,780
I don't care! Has to work.

23
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,130
GRIOT.

24
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,300
Yes, Princess?

25
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,590
What's my brother's heart rate?

26
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,520
Your brother is with the ancestors.

27
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,990
No.

28
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:05,040
We give thanks for the gift of King T'Challa.

29
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,840
The Black Panther.

30
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,130
Son of King T'Chaka.

31
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,680
My son.

32
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:22,270
Descendant of the most revered King Bashenga,

33
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,190
the first Black Panther.

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,440
We release you.

35
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,730
Praise the ancestors.

36
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,800
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,840
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

38
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,720
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

39
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,440
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

40
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,860
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

41
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,070
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

42
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,530
T'Challa

43
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

44
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,190
It is an honor for me...

45
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,940
to invite her majesty, Queen Ramonda...

46
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,530
daughter of Lumumba,
sovereign ruler of the kingdom of Wakanda.

47
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,830
Mr. Chairperson...

48
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,420
I believe I speak for
all the member states here...

49
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,430
when I say that
I am deeply disappointed in Wakanda's...

50
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:13,390
failure to stand by promises to
participate in global efforts...

51
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,730
to tackle international challenges,
to share resources...

52
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,400
and full cooperation...

53
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,770
concerning vibranium.

54
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:28,950
France has information that vibranium can be
used to make weapons of mass destruction.

55
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,830
It does not trigger any known metal detector.

56
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:39,420
It is a threat to global security
and the non-proliferation regime.

57
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,880
I now give the floor to
Her Majesty, Queen Ramonda.

58
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,800
It has always been our policy...

59
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,890
to never trade vibranium
under any circumstance.

60
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,940
Not because of the dangerous potential
of vibranium...

61
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,610
but because of
the dangerous potential of you.

62
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,290
I just lost security visuals.

63
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,550
Down on your stomachs right now!

64
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,130
Face to the floor! Go! Go!

65
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,550
Where are the vibranium tools?

66
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,350
Who has access?

67
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,780
You perform civility here.

68
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,620
But we know what you whisper...

69
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,080
in your halls of leadership
and in your military facilities.

70
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,800
"The King is dead.

71
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,590
"The Black Panther is gone.

72
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,760
"They have lost their protector.

73
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,900
"Now is our time...

74
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,480
"to strike."

75
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,640
Aneka, where is your spear?

76
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,220
Shuri gave me these to try.

77
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,690
You know, I like them better.

78
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,350
Our foremothers gave us the spear...

79
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,230
because it is precise, elegant...

80
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,110
and deadly.

81
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,240
It will not change under my watch.

82
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,660
Yes, General.

83
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,120
I told you not to bring them.

84
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,750
Last night there was another attack
on one of our outreach facilities.

85
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,260
Proof of the involvement of a member state...

86
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,510
is being uploaded to your mobile devices
as we speak.

87
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,680
And as for the identity of the attackers...

88
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,860
Kneel!

89
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,620
You're welcome.

90
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:09,380
Let our gracious response to this incursion
be an olive branch.

91
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,300
Further attempts on our resources...

92
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,550
will be considered an act of aggression...

93
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,470
and met with a much steeper response.

94
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,640
We mourn the loss of our king.

95
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,230
But do not think for a second
that Wakanda has lost her ability...

96
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,940
to protect our resources.

97
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,070
We are aware
of the ongoing efforts by some...

98
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,570
to find vibranium outside of Wakanda...

99
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,870
and wish you the best of luck.

100
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,090
This is Rotor 625
requesting clearance to land.

101
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,300
All right. Meet you down there.

102
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,470
Yeah.

103
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,060
Hey!

104
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,060
I thought you retired!

105
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,270
I thought I had too.

106
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,770
They said that machine had a one
in a billion chance of finding vibranium.

107
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,110
Oh, less than that.

108
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,170
Here we go.

109
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,170
Cabin pressure is stable
at negative one P-S-I.

110
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,930
At 800 feet...

111
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,060
passing through thermocline.

112
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,850
All my life supports in the green.

113
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,060
Copy you.

114
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,820
We've touched down.

115
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,920
Perfect. So, Salazar,
you are near the site right there.

116
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,340
Yeah, it's astonishing.

117
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,130
The drill seemed to make contact
with a metallic substance.

118
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,100
Whatever it is, it's solid.

119
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,810
I've never seen a drill bit
chewed up like this before.

120
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,440
I'll be.

121
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,690
Vibranium in the ocean.

122
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,570
Let's go ahead
and get the detector out of there...

123
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,650
since it's the only one we've got.

124
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,950
Heading towards the vibranium detector.

125
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,080
Okay, Salazar, we just went dark.

126
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,790
Yeah. The rig lost power.

127
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,260
Copy that. I'm gonna fix it up here.

128
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,190
What the hell was that?

129
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,500
Jackson...

130
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,410
tell me you're seeing this?

131
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,500
Hang on. Salazar's heart rate.

132
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,880
Hey, Salazar, can you give me a visual?

133
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,840
It's a phantom jellyfish.

134
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,420
I've never seen one this color.

135
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,720
Emergency dive team, stand by.

136
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,640
Salazar, we just lost Jackson's vitals.

137
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,970
Can you see him?

138
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,770
No. He's gone.

139
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,900
Can you clarify?
What do you mean by, "He's gone"?

140
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,070
Salazar, do you copy?

141
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,620
Salazar?

142
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,450
Smitty, we got a situation out here.

143
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,380
What's that sound?

144
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,550
West, you got a visual on
what's making that sound?

145
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,560
West, how copy, over?

146
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,110
West, you got a visual?

147
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,670
It's some kind of sonic attack.

148
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,630
Hey, Smitty, earplugs.

149
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,930
We are under attack.

150
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,930
You need to send in
a strike team immediately.

151
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,980
Copy.
Mayday, mayday, this is Rotor 625.

152
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,520
We are requesting assistance immediately.

153
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,730
It's the Wakandans.

154
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,270
It has to be.

155
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
Henderson.

156
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,670
Smitty, we gotta go.

157
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,130
Henderson!

158
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,210
Let's go.

159
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,050
What's going on?

160
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Get off the edge.

161
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,530
Go!

162
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,260
Go, go, go!

163
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,680
Now! Go!

164
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,430
Spin! Spin them off!

165
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,400
Okay. They're gone!

166
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,650
Oh, my God!

167
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,290
Just get us out.

168
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,670
We're good.

169
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,090
We're good.

170
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,510
Where is the strike team?

171
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,720
It wasn't the Wakandans. They were blue.

172
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,010
Everyone is dead...

173
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,760
Shit.
What is going on?

174
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,970
We're getting pulled backwards.

175
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,470
Oh, my God.

176
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,020
Oh, God! Hang on!

177
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,810
Queen Ramonda of the nation of Wakanda...

178
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,190
gave an electrifying speech
at the UN yesterday...

179
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,150
while members of her military
escorted captive mercenaries...

180
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,030
onto the floor of the UN.

181
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,820
A year has passed since Queen Ramonda...

182
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,950
was reinstated as ruler of Wakanda...

183
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,530
after King T'Challa's sudden death
from an undisclosed illness last year.

184
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,700
All eyes are on the tiny, powerful nation...

185
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,540
as it finds itself increasingly isolated...

186
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,420
My Queen.

187
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,830
Approaching the river border.

188
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,180
We are home.

189
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,060
Princess.

190
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,650
Just a moment.
I'm in the middle of something.

191
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,150
I understand, Princess, however...

192
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,070
You're disrupting my train of thought.

193
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,610
Shuri.

194
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,070
Mother.

195
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,120
I was trying to tell you.
The Queen is here.

196
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,290
-Thank you.
-That thing unnerves me.

197
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,250
I think that one day artificial intelligence
is going to kill us all.

198
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:55,090
My AI isn't like the movies, Mother.
It does exactly what I tell it to do.

199
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,590
Yeah, if only children were the same.

200
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,630
Everyone seems to be working diligently.

201
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,760
Yes. Rapid emergency response task.

202
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,680
There could be any number of...

203
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:11,060
unknown threats on the horizon,
and they're creating solutions.

204
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,110
Oh, what is this?

205
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,940
Exo Suits for our army.

206
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,650
It grants the user super-human strength,
speed, and durability.

207
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,370
But, as always, Okoye had notes.

208
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,570
What were her notes?

209
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,080
She hates them.

210
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,830
What about recreating the Heart-Shaped Herb?

211
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Have you made any progress on that?

212
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,300
Excuse me, Princess.

213
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,510
Nakia, daughter of Yaa,
is trying to reach you again.

214
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,720
Maybe you should...

215
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,550
Maybe you should
continue your calculations...

216
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,760
as I instructed.

217
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,600
As you wish, Princess.

218
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:52,480
We do not need the Herb, Mother.
We need new technology.

219
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,810
What of the Black Panther?

220
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,650
The mantle has unified our nation
for centuries.

221
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,990
The Black Panther is a relic, Mother.

222
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,530
I wasn't trying to save the mantle
with the Herb...

223
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,870
I was trying to save my brother.

224
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,000
Oh, Shuri.

225
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,340
Do you know what day it is?

226
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,300
Tuesday.

227
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,640
The date, child.

228
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,230
Brother's passing.

229
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,320
One year ago today.

230
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,120
Have you planned anything?

231
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,210
Yes. It involves you
taking your mother for a drive.

232
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:57,210
-Right now?
-Right now.

233
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,460
And you can leave your Kimoyo Beads here.

234
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,550
-Mother.
-No, no.

235
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,800
You won't need them where we are going.

236
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,470
And the other two. Yes.

237
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:38,080
You need to sit here with me.
And with yourself.

238
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,750
It is the only way
you are going to heal...

239
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,090
from the wound caused
by T'Challa's death.

240
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,510
I'm fine, Mother.

241
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,010
You don't have to worry about me.

242
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,760
He's gone, but I'm moving forward.

243
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:57,730
T'Challa is dead,
but that doesn't mean he is gone.

244
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,020
When that illness
took your brother from us...

245
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:05,780
I had to lead a wounded nation
and a broken world.

246
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,610
But I still took time in the bush.

247
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,080
I wandered until I found water.

248
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,540
And I sat.

249
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,870
Then I did this ritual...

250
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,500
that I am about to show you now.

251
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,170
I found your brother in the breeze...

252
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,930
pushing me gently, but firm.

253
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,100
Like his hand on my shoulder.

254
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,890
It took some time...

255
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,310
but he was there.

256
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,950
He wasn't there, Mother.

257
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,120
The presence that you felt...

258
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,200
was just a construct of your mind.

259
00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:00,120
Brought on so you could feel
some comfort or joy.

260
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,250
That's all.

261
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,930
What construct
does your mind create...

262
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,050
when you think of your brother?

263
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,060
Does it offer you comfort?

264
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,850
Or torment?

265
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,530
Come, child.

266
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,340
How did you get this?

267
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,590
What does it matter?

268
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,220
What does this have to do with your ritual?

269
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,680
Burning of the funeral garments...

270
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,180
marks the end
of the mourning period...

271
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,140
and the beginning
of a new relationship...

272
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,600
with our loved ones that have passed on...

273
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,690
I'm not doing this, Mother.

274
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,360
If I sit...

275
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,110
and think about my brother
for too long...

276
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,450
it won't be these clothes I'll burn.

277
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,160
It will be the world...

278
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,120
and everyone in it.

279
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,500
Shuri...

280
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,880
Shuri, there's something
that I need to tell you...

281
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,720
about your brother.

282
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,220
Mother, wait!

283
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,220
What are you doing?

284
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,370
This better not be a part of your ritual.

285
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,830
It isn't.

286
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,130
Stop! Right there!

287
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,670
Who are you?
And how did you get in here?

288
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,720
This place is amazing.

289
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,720
The air is pristine.

290
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,180
And the water...

291
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,770
My mother told stories
about a place like this.

292
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:30,320
A protected land with people
that never have to leave.

293
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,820
That never have to change who they were.

294
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,410
What reason do you have
to reveal your secret to the world?

295
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,410
I am not a woman
who enjoys repeating herself.

296
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,450
Who are you?

297
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,870
I have many names.

298
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,540
My people call me K'uk'ulkan...

299
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,210
but my enemies call me Namor.

300
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:58,220
The American military detected vibranium
under my nation's domain.

301
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,760
I was able to
stop them from minin' it...

302
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,810
but we need Wakanda's help
to prevent it from happenin' again.

303
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,900
They use a machine
designed by an American scientist.

304
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,530
Vibranium only exists here.

305
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,070
In Wakanda.

306
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,570
Mother, he's covered in it.

307
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:24,200
Your son exposed the power of vibranium
to the world.

308
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:28,620
In response, other nations have begun
searching the planet for it.

309
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:32,130
His choice has compromised us.

310
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,720
I think Wakanda could find the scientist
and bring them to me?

311
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:41,430
It is only fair that Wakanda
helps to resolve our dilemma.

312
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,890
You do not sneak into my country
and tell me what is fair.

313
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,480
I have more soldiers
than this land has blades of grass.

314
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,030
And they have incomparable strength.

315
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,570
I would hate to come back
under different circumstances.

316
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,040
When you have the scientist,
blow into this...

317
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,620
place it in the ocean.

318
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'll be there shortly afterwards.

319
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,840
For your own sake...

320
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:20,010
don't mention anything about me
to anyone outside of Wakanda.

321
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,690
Did you see the wings on his ankles?

322
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,240
How did he do that?

323
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,660
We must convene the Council.

324
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,130
Heaven Scrapers had no evidence
of any activity at all.

325
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,130
Oh, the river border has been breached?

326
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,590
If my soldiers were present...

327
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,180
this "fish man"...

328
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,060
would be bound before us
as we speak.

329
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,520
If your muscle brains were present...

330
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,810
they would still be there
choking on their fuzzy adornments.

331
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,150
You bald-headed demon...

332
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,110
Show some respect, you two.

333
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,280
Respect?

334
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,900
These men should be
ashamed to show their faces!

335
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,030
Watch your tone, Jabari!

336
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,130
As I was saying...

337
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:40,960
there was no aerial surveillance
footage of him.

338
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,420
And nothing on the radar as well.

339
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:46,090
So, he swam underwater
for 100 kilometers.

340
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,060
He was not alone.
And claims to command a massive army.

341
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:54,520
He wants us to deliver
one American scientist?

342
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:55,690
So he can kill them?

343
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,810
Do it.

344
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:02,690
We never had to face an enemy
with access to vibranium before.

345
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,530
And we have no Black Panther to protect us.

346
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:10,040
That is because this wise Council
allowed Killmonger to take the throne...

347
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,040
and burn up all of
your precious Heart-Shaped Herb.

348
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,750
M'Baku, what would you have us do?

349
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:17,250
We should find the fish man and kill him.

350
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:22,050
If we do what he is asking for now...

351
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:26,510
what is to stop him from coming back
and asking for more?

352
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:36,940
As you were.

353
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,900
Is it just me,
or does this keep getting uglier?

354
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,150
It's you.

355
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,950
-So, does it work?
-Yes.

356
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:50,780
This thing can detect
the altered frequency of vibranium...

357
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:55,910
through water, stones, even heavy metals.
Whoever built this is brilliant.

358
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,670
Come, look.

359
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,880
Some are custom parts
and others look like...

360
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,840
they gathered it from a junkyard.

361
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,590
I am still struggling to believe...

362
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,300
that vibranium exists
outside of Wakanda.

363
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,760
Perhaps there was
more than one meteorite.

364
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,720
Our planet is covered of mostly water,
so it's reasonable...

365
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,930
that the other one just landed there.

366
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,190
This changes everything that we know.

367
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:21,770
The Great Mound.
All of the legends and fables.

368
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,400
Those stories are seared in my mind.

369
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,360
That sounds very painful.

370
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,620
So we have to find this scientist after all.

371
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,370
I do have an idea.

372
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,080
I'm going to need the princess.

373
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,210
Out of the question.

374
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,460
She is in no state to be in the field.

375
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,920
My Queen,

376
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,460
it may do her some good to get out.

377
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,590
It might just be exactly what she needs.

378
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:53,180
Besides, I can do this American operation
with my eyes closed.

379
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,600
It's not the Americans
that I'm worried about.

380
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,180
This Namor...

381
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,480
he snuck past our defenses.

382
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,560
That will never happen again.

383
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,270
He was not alone.

384
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,320
She'll be with me.

385
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,450
So...

386
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,530
when are we leavin'...

387
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,740
so I can see my favorite colonizer?

388
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,980
Come on.

389
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,400
Yeah, I got it.

390
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,690
I got it.

391
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,200
Will you slow down?

392
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,540
You didn't think to call?

393
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,620
Now, why would I have your number?

394
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,840
We are looking for the scientist
who built the vibranium detector.

395
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,510
So it was you guys in the Atlantic?

396
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,130
Come on. Mining ship.

397
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,640
Lot of casualties.

398
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,260
What happened?

399
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,510
Seriously?

400
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,390
It was a joint operation.
Us and the SEALs.

401
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,480
Thirty of their top guys,
two of our best officers...

402
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,690
friends of mine.

403
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,190
Gone.

404
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,400
Just like that.

405
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,820
You throw in the fact that
they were tracking vibranium...

406
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,700
I can assure you
Wakanda had nothing to do with this.

407
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,700
So who was it?

408
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,080
God, look, the way that
this is supposed to work...

409
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,290
is that I give you information
and you reciprocate.

410
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:44,170
For our own safety,
we cannot tell you.

411
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,380
It's imperative that
we get to the scientist...

412
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,040
before anything else happens.

413
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,550
You owe me, Ross.

414
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,300
You owe my brother.

415
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,050
Okay, look.

416
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,100
There are agents
who have been sentenced to death...

417
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:02,390
for less than I'm about to give you now.

418
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,850
And we got a new director.

419
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,900
She's watching me like a hawk.

420
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,610
We will be very, very careful.

421
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,730
Not just careful, you gotta be fast.

422
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,490
The US needs another machine...

423
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,150
and this kid is the only person
in the world...

424
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,280
who knows how to build one.

425
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,490
So they're comin' for her.

426
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,620
A kid?

427
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,920
Hey.

428
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,130
You forgot to Venmo me.

429
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,260
It slipped my mind.
It's eight hundred, right?

430
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,300
Eight hundred was yesterday's price.
It's a band today.

431
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,970
That's predatory.

432
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:41,010
I built the whole robotic hand.

433
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,680
You just corrected the grip algorithm.

434
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,190
And what grade did you get?

435
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,690
Thanks.

436
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:56,740
Is that an iPhone I see?

437
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:57,950
Primitive.

438
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,450
My Queen.

439
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,160
We have located the scientist.

440
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:06,920
She is in the American equivalent
of a Wakandan village school.

441
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,290
A school?

442
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:11,130
Please tell me it is a professor.

443
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,090
It's a student, Mother.

444
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,800
We can't give her to Namor.

445
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,180
Bring this student back to Wakanda.

446
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,300
Yes, my Queen.

447
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:24,810
I've got it from here.

448
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,310
Wait. Maybe I should speak with her.

449
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,730
It will be more discreet.

450
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,150
I can be discreet.

451
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,860
What?

452
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,400
-Nothing.
-Is it the makeup?

453
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,610
No.

454
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,870
-It's the wrong shade, isn't it?
-It's the right shade.

455
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,620
Fenty 440. You look good.

456
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,290
I can blend in as a student.

457
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,370
I can do this.

458
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,630
-You get five minutes.
-Yes!

459
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,020
Yo!

460
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,230
Riri Williams?

461
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,190
Yo, I don't do drop-bys no more.
You gotta go to the website.

462
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,650
It's an encrypted file.

463
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,030
I wanted to airdrop it.

464
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,410
You the...

465
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,620
You're Princess Shuri.

466
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,830
What the hell are you doing here?

467
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,540
Oh, shit, am I getting recruited?

468
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,290
No.

469
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,340
I'm here about the vibranium detector
that you built for the CIA.

470
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,640
I ain't built no detector for no CIA.
I made that for my metallurgy class.

471
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,760
-A school project?
-Yeah.

472
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,970
My professor said I'd never be able to do it.

473
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,730
To be young, gifted, and Black though, right?

474
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,020
Y'all probably don't say that in Wakanda.

475
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,280
How old are you?

476
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,570
Nineteen.

477
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:05,870
Brilliance at a young age
is not always accepted by the elders.

478
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:08,830
How long did it take you?

479
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,120
Couple months.

480
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,870
-Couple months?
-The hardest part was...

481
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,920
finding big enough mylar sheets
to cover the...

482
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,130
Wait, did I piss off Wakanda?

483
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,300
Not just us.

484
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,380
This place is no longer safe for you.

485
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,720
Gather your things and come with me.
Right now.

486
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:27,510
I got Differential Equations class in,
like, 15 minutes.

487
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,140
Okay.

488
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,440
Okay.

489
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,810
You wait right here.

490
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,280
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'm just gonna...

491
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,360
I had it under control.

492
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,830
I said five minutes.
I gave you six.

493
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,620
Get out. Get out of my dorm.

494
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,410
Get out!

495
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,580
Hey.

496
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:56,630
I'm warning you!
Do not take another step toward me!

497
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,800
See how they teach the children
to treat their guests?

498
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,760
You brought a spear in here?

499
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,180
You brought a spear in here.

500
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,100
I like her.

501
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,890
Hey, hey, hey. Put it down, put it...

502
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,440
You'll hurt yourself. Come on.

503
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,650
It's all right, Princess.

504
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,190
Small, small girl.

505
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:22,150
I am going to give you two options.

506
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,530
You can come to Wakanda...

507
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,950
conscious or unconscious.

508
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,490
You need to be conscious
of the way that you look.

509
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,700
Walking round here,
all that ash on your head.

510
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,580
-Oh, it's funny?
-No, it's not.

511
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,210
-I told you!
-You look good.

512
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,750
Calm down. We'll leave, okay?

513
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:45,590
And she can deal with that merman
with the winged ankles...

514
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,680
who wants to kill her
all by herself.

515
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,930
-You got this.
-With your heater.

516
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,270
Come on. Let's go.

517
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,020
What?

518
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,070
What exactly is this place?

519
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,740
I fixed a few trucks
for the head of sanitation.

520
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:10,370
He lets me work out of this garage
in exchange.

521
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,450
I just have to grab my work laptop.

522
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,920
Please don't touch anything.

523
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,170
You don't have to worry about that.

524
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,050
It may not look like much,
but it's my life's work in here.

525
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,430
So, the design for the machine
is on that laptop?

526
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,590
Yeah.

527
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,640
And you just leave it on a desk
in a car garage?

528
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:35,770
I got 2065-byte encryption
on that thing.

529
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:39,060
That's impressive.
Ever locked yourself out?

530
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,190
Took me the whole semester to get back in.

531
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,400
Had to build a functional quantum computer...

532
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,490
just to crack my own encryption.

533
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:48,030
What is it you're building here?
Is it Stark Tech?

534
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,070
I said don't touch anything.

535
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,780
Princess, American law enforcement
has arrived at your location.

536
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,370
-Shit.
-Who was that?

537
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,750
My AI.

538
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,830
They are surrounding us.

539
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:05,550
I thought you said a merman was after me.

540
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,720
That's the feds.

541
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,610
I do not need this shit right now!

542
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,860
I swear to God, I was doing so well!

543
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,690
Goin' to class on time.
I must be dumb as hell.

544
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,490
Real dumb thinking that
the Princess of Wakanda...

545
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,830
is gonna show up at my doorstep
and then shit about to pop off.

546
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,660
I think that I'm actually gonna
take my chances with this merman...

547
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:41,420
because at least he never
brought the FBI to my garage!

548
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,960
Hey. Namor sank an entire ship
of CIA operatives...

549
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:48,720
-This is the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
-...because of your little machine.

550
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,760
-So those popo out there...
-We have surrounded the premises.

551
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,550
...are the very least of your worries.

552
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,180
Listen, we need to work together
to get out of here.

553
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,850
General, they've got us surrounded.

554
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,560
Maybe we should just split up.

555
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,190
Out of the question.

556
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,440
Does this vehicle work?

557
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,070
No.

558
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:09,360
Everything in this lab works.
Including this bike.

559
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:13,490
Don't even think about it.
Besides, there are three of us.

560
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,120
Two of y'all. I'm takin' this.

561
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,080
I knew it.

562
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,710
Don't tell me that you built this
in two months.

563
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,830
I spent years on this. On and off.

564
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:27,750
Nice. Have you flown it yet?

565
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,010
That thing can fly?

566
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:32,470
There's an entire YouTube channel
dedicated to sightings of me.

567
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,220
That's awesome.

568
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,300
-We have a warrant to detain...
-Come.

569
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,680
...the student Riri Williams.

570
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,020
Wireless transmitter...

571
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,480
-so we can communicate.
-Don't try to scurry off.

572
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,650
General Okoye, Princess Shuri...

573
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,860
come out with your hands up.

574
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,570
What a hunk of junk.

575
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,860
Hey, please be careful.

576
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,110
-You will not be placed under arrest.
-Keys are on the seat.

577
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,780
Once we get to
the other side of the bridge...

578
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,120
we can lose them in Boston traffic.

579
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,120
General, we really need to split up.

580
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,540
Listen to me. We are not in your lab.
We are in the field.

581
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,080
Now, get her in the car.

582
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,750
Always shouting at me.

583
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:15,760
The tactical unit will breach the entrance
in three, two...

584
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,260
one.

585
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,270
FBI! Don't move!

586
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:21,890
What the hell is that?

587
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,940
Oh, shit! She got an Iron Man suit?
Fall back!

588
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,480
Stay where you are!

589
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,110
Guess it can fly.

590
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,530
-GRIOT!
-Yes, Princess.

591
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,240
-Now!
-Remote piloting activated.

592
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:35,660
Shuri! No!

593
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,000
Let's go!

594
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,250
GRIOT.

595
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,710
Give me a visual.

596
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,140
-GRIOT...
-Yes, General?

597
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,140
...take me to the princess...

598
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:06,020
or I will drive my spear
so deep into your CPU...

599
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:09,310
you will not be able to process
basic input for a millennia.

600
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,650
Just one moment, General.

601
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:12,320
Okoye, I'm on my way to you.

602
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,540
GRIOT, give me control of this vehicle
right now!

603
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:28,790
I am clearing you a path.

604
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:34,800
She's all yours, General.

605
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,840
Manual drive engaged.

606
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:55,070
We need to find an extraction point.

607
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,700
There's one across the river.

608
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,490
Hey, yo, they cuttin' off the bridge.

609
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:11,630
Princess, there is a surveillance drone
locked onto you.

610
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:12,710
How high?

611
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,170
Thirty-thousand feet.

612
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,220
Hang on.

613
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:22,930
I got it.

614
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,600
Come on, Riri.

615
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,270
You gotta find these differential equations.

616
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,190
Once the relative velocity evens out...

617
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,150
Riri, I'm not sure
you can reach that drone...

618
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:35,320
without an oxygen mask.

619
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,610
Oxygen level is now 55%.

620
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:43,450
Twenty-eight thousand feet.

621
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:47,450
Oxygen level is now 30%.

622
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:53,590
Maximum acceleration. I just need to
adjust my Euler angles and that should...

623
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,590
drop it right on the...

624
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:03,930
Oxygen, 0%.

625
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:09,270
The drone is no longer tracking you.

626
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:12,190
Altitude, 500 feet and falling.

627
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:13,520
Riri! Are you okay?

628
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:15,860
-Riri!
-Yeah.

629
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,570
I'm good.

630
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,490
-Incoming!
-Get out of the way!

631
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,780
Oh my!

632
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:24,950
-Shit!
-And no worries.

633
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:27,080
I got a special delivery for y'all
in three...

634
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,580
two, one...

635
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,290
Nice one, Riri!

636
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,300
Riri!

637
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,750
What just happened?
Shuri!

638
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:13,210
Shuri!

639
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:31,600
The Princess's vitals are stable, General.

640
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:34,310
She should regain consciousness
momentarily.

641
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,890
Take another step closer...

642
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,180
and I will kill you all.

643
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:14,850
Drop your weapons!

644
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:18,860
Kill the scientist.

645
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,690
I'll deal with the witnesses.

646
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,900
OK.

647
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:24,820
Hey, is she blue?

648
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,410
Kill that woman first.

649
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,660
Drop your weapon!

650
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:06,780
Go to Namora.

651
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:18,430
You're not worth my blade.

652
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:32,570
What's taking so long?

653
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:35,530
This is not a time for games.

654
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:45,840
Okoye!

655
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,380
Wait!

656
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:49,840
Activating interpretation.

657
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:50,970
I'm Shuri.

658
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,430
Princess of Wakanda.

659
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,720
I demand that you take me to Namor.

660
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:56,970
Do not bring harm to this girl.

661
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,690
Do we take them both alive?

662
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,350
Yes, Attuma.

663
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,750
Breathe.

664
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,630
Shuri!

665
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,740
Ross, from the Agency. You got any witnesses?

666
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:55,200
None. But we think it was the Wakandans.

667
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:56,610
Excuse me?

668
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,780
Our field office got a tip from Langley
that they were coming.

669
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:00,830
Right. Who made that call?

670
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:03,160
-She did.
-Director de Fontaine.

671
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:06,920
Director de Fontaine.

672
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,040
Really?

673
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:09,170
Well...

674
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:12,130
Agent thinks it was the Wakandans.

675
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:15,180
Yeah, we've been on every one of them
since they took out our ship.

676
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,630
That's why I wanted you here.

677
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,720
You're lookin' good.

678
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:20,560
Well, I try.

679
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,100
You put that home gym in?

680
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:23,310
Yeah. Last year.

681
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,140
Maybe I'll drop by sometime
and jump on your Peloton.

682
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,850
Howdy.

683
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:28,940
I'm special agent in charge.

684
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:32,030
Oh, good for you. You wanna walk me
through the evidence here, or what?

685
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,280
-Yeah. Okay. After you.
-Yeah. Okay.

686
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:35,610
-All right.
-So, what happened here?

687
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,820
We think it was a car crash...

688
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,780
but we're having trouble finding the cars.

689
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,200
What do you mean?
It was just like this when you found it?

690
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,750
Yes. We think someone involved
got rid of the vehicles.

691
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:47,750
-Got rid of them how?
-They dumped them into the river.

692
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,170
You're kidding me.

693
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,880
It's got an MIT sticker on it.

694
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,340
I want that transferred
to the NSA immediately.

695
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,680
Hey, Ross? You got a full tank of gas?

696
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,430
Can you give me a ride back to Langley?

697
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:00,800
It's an eight-hour drive.

698
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,260
Yeah. We can talk about the case.

699
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:03,770
Actually, wouldn't mind...

700
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:08,190
apologizing to you for a couple of things
I said during our marriage.

701
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,730
They were blue.

702
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,690
And they had superhuman strength.

703
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,410
And they came from the water
on the backs of whales.

704
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,370
I struck down three of them
with blows that should've killed them...

705
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,250
but they rose again.

706
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,670
I wish to leave immediately
to retrieve our princess.

707
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:41,800
Okoye...

708
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:46,520
you will be stripped of your rank
as General of Wakanda's armies...

709
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:49,640
and your status as Dora Milaje.

710
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,440
Permission to speak...

711
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:56,530
my Queen?

712
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:58,990
You may.

713
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:00,950
I beg of you.

714
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,450
I have given everything.

715
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:09,120
Let me die saving my country and that throne.

716
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:11,290
I'm asking you, mother.

717
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,250
Allow me to make this right.

718
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,630
"Make it right"?

719
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:19,470
I do not know
if my daughter is alive or dead.

720
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:22,800
Perhaps we are being too hasty.

721
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:29,310
She raised a spear
against her own husband for Wakanda.

722
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,980
Where is her treacherous husband now...

723
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:36,480
but in a place where she can visit
if she wished? Mine...

724
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,650
is with the ancestors.

725
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:44,490
I am Queen of the most powerful nation
in the world...

726
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,910
and my entire family is gone!

727
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:51,580
Have I not given everything?

728
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,630
On your feet, General.

729
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:11,020
I stood by you...

730
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:14,770
after Killmonger took the throne...

731
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,610
and you and the elders in this room
stood by him...

732
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,360
while I ran begging to the Jabari
for protection.

733
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:28,160
And I warned you
about taking my daughter on this mission...

734
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,250
and you lost her.

735
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,410
So, today...

736
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:34,670
I am done.

737
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:24,260
Are you here, GRIOT?

738
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:26,720
Yes, my Queen.

739
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,180
Were you with Shuri when she was abducted?

740
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:32,720
I was.

741
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:35,600
Are you able to track her Kimoyo Beads?

742
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:38,190
Ballistics found slugs all over Cambridge.

743
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,770
Those Wakandans really
took a tour of the city.

744
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,150
I can't see how they figured out
who built it.

745
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,740
That information is highly classified.

746
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:51,530
-What is that? That's a new ringtone?
-Oh, shit.

747
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,870
Director, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to take this.

748
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,000
It's enough with the titles.
Just take it. I don't care.

749
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:58,830
Hey, honey sweetheart.

750
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:03,090
No, I'm with my boss. Now.

751
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,220
Actually, she's leaving.

752
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,300
All right.

753
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:09,050
I'm gonna work from home,
and then have a shower.

754
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:17,810
Everett Ross.

755
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,150
Queen Ramonda?

756
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:21,270
What are you doing with Shuri's Kimoyo Beads?

757
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,230
I didn't know they were hers. All right?

758
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,690
I just found them
at a pretty ugly crime scene.

759
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:27,860
Do you have the student?

760
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:31,660
Shuri was trying to save her
when they were both taken.

761
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:34,080
What? Taken by who?

762
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,620
My agency assumes it was you.

763
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:39,750
And I'm worried
they might be onto the fact...

764
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,090
that I pointed Shuri and Okoye
in the right direction.

765
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:43,880
Look, if they're in danger, I wanna help.

766
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:45,960
But I can't if I don't know what's going on.

767
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,930
I am afraid there is
a new world power at play.

768
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:52,220
A country that's already on our radar?
Or you mean someone else?

769
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:54,390
That is all I can say for now.

770
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,600
Please...

771
00:57:56,100 --> 00:58:00,440
alert me if your government
decides to act on their suspicions.

772
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,270
Yeah. Sure.

773
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,190
Look, if there's anything
I can do to help, let me know.

774
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,110
I owe Shuri my life.

775
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:12,870
GRIOT, did Shuri have her earrings with her?

776
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:15,540
I lost track of them in the North Atlantic...

777
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:18,910
but the people who took her
spoke Yucatec Mayan.

778
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,800
Hello.

779
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,020
You're here for the headmistress?

780
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:46,270
She's there.

781
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,900
Very good.

782
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:57,290
Hello.

783
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:07,000
Please excuse us for a moment.

784
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:12,130
Hello.

785
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:13,220
Hello.

786
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:14,340
Hello.

787
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:20,680
Queen Mother.

788
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,810
Everything is a lesson here for the children.

789
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,980
They painted the walls, they feed the fish...

790
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:30,400
and they grow everything we eat here.

791
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:33,280
I recognize some of the concepts here.

792
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,370
But you are using different material.

793
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:38,830
Yes, we use strictly
what we can find here in Haiti.

794
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:44,170
You were missed at T'Challa's funeral.

795
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:57,180
Queen Mother.

796
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,270
It's been six years since you left us.

797
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:03,560
I thought you would at least come back
for the ceremony.

798
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,690
I was afraid...

799
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:12,530
of how final the funeral would be.

800
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:15,660
Nakia, daughter of Yaa...

801
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:20,910
wherever you go,
you are still Wakandan...

802
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,710
and you know death is not the end.

803
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:31,090
Thank you.

804
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,640
How is everyone at home?

805
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,060
Shuri has been taken.

806
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:41,850
What?

807
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:45,270
You have infiltrated many nations before.

808
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,560
That was a long time ago.

809
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:48,940
I was a different person then.

810
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:52,110
I need someone who can find
where she is being held...

811
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:55,280
and rescue her, without being seen.

812
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:58,530
Who on earth would risk war with Wakanda?

813
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:01,990
Oh, my God.

814
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,370
Okay, breathe. Breathe.

815
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:04,950
Don't tell me to breathe.

816
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,160
Where the hell are we?

817
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:08,250
We're in a cave. I'm not sure where.

818
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,460
Oh, my God!

819
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:11,590
What is that?

820
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:14,510
Glow worms. Their larva gives off light.

821
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:16,550
Just calm down.

822
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:18,760
Okay, is there, like, a new Black Panther...

823
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:21,180
-that you can call to come and get us?
-No.

824
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:22,350
Why not?

825
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:24,180
Because it doesn't work like that anymore.

826
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:26,560
The Black Panther is gone.

827
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:29,310
So y'all stopped having Black Panthers
when I get kidnapped?

828
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:35,860
Princess.

829
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:39,160
Here royalty wears traditional clothing.

830
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:41,740
We had this made for you.

831
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,660
Do you understand her?

832
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,290
Not completely.

833
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:49,620
Nuh-uh.

834
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:52,040
That is some supervillain shit right there.

835
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,630
That's in every movie.

836
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,050
Princess Leia.

837
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:56,420
Belle from Beauty and the Beast.

838
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:59,180
That white chick from Indiana Jones.

839
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,300
It's fine.

840
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:03,010
You should see what I have to wear
at Warrior Falls.

841
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:10,400
Come with me.

842
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,770
Wait.

843
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:15,320
You're not leaving me in here, are you?

844
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:16,940
I'm coming back.

845
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:18,820
I'm coming back.

846
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:20,910
Stay calm.

847
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:28,910
Eat?

848
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:45,180
Hello Ma'am. It's nice to meet you.

849
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:46,310
What can I help you with?

850
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:50,350
My name is Maria Aldana.
I'm a student from Merida...

851
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:52,440
I'm not interested. Go away. Please.

852
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:56,610
Yes, of course. I don't mean to bother you.
Just give me a second...

853
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:59,070
My professor mentioned a study

854
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,910
where you told researchers that
you encountered something...

855
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,990
Someone unimaginable.

856
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:10,330
Nothing good came of speaking
with those outsiders.

857
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:11,960
I'm begging you.

858
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:13,330
Leave. Now.

859
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,090
I've encountered him too.

860
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,560
Sometimes we would catch a
glimpse of a man with winged feet...

861
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,440
...on the shore of the beach.

862
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:38,110
We thought he was a spirit.

863
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:40,440
The K'uk'ulkan.

864
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:43,530
Our Feathered Serpent God,

865
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,200
...of this realm and the realm below.

866
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:50,790
I would very much like to visit that beach.

867
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:52,460
Be warned...

868
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:59,050
K'uk'ulkan has been here for
much longer than you and I.

869
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,420
Others who have searched for him

870
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:03,340
with ill in their hearts...

871
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,720
have never returned.

872
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:07,470
Lost to the depths...

873
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:10,810
forever...

874
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:31,580
Princess.

875
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:32,700
Welcome.

876
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:37,130
Please, feel free.

877
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:45,720
This is beautiful.

878
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:48,220
That was my mother's.

879
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,860
These are all Mesoamerican artifacts.

880
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,190
Most likely 16th century.

881
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:07,660
Have you been alive since then?

882
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:11,200
Your mother was human.

883
01:05:12,540 --> 01:05:13,540
She was.

884
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:15,960
Then she became something else.

885
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:18,250
-How?
-"How?"

886
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:21,250
"How" is never as important as "why."

887
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:35,560
My mother and her village
were driven from their farms...

888
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:39,480
by Spanish conquistadors
who brought the smallpox...

889
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:42,570
a hateful language,
and dogma from another world.

890
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,110
Facing starvation...

891
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,030
war, and disease...

892
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:50,370
my people turned to Chaac...

893
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:53,950
our god of rain and abundance.

894
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,040
Chaac gave our shaman a vision...

895
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,210
a way to save his people.

896
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:10,090
Chaac led him to a plant
sprouting from a blue rock.

897
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,780
My mother was pregnant with me
at the time...

898
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,190
and she did not want to
ingest the plant...

899
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,530
for fear of what it may do to me.

900
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:32,240
No. My baby.

901
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,580
But the Shaman was convincing.

902
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:45,050
Your baby is sick.

903
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:47,340
Only this can heal him.

904
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:51,510
Your baby will be the first to be born
in our new home.

905
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,430
Take this gift as a promise...

906
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:58,060
He will be our new king.

907
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,280
They all fell sick.

908
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,280
And their lives...

909
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,530
their existence there...

910
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,120
ended.

911
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,130
The plant took away their ability
to breathe air...

912
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:33,130
but enabled them to draw oxygen from the sea.

913
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:38,220
They settled in the ocean...

914
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:42,060
away from war and diseases.

915
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:45,690
Let's go!

916
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:13,380
My mother gave birth to me there...

917
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:16,890
and I became the firstborn son of Talokan.

918
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:19,470
The plant gave me wings on my ankles...

919
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:22,020
and ears that pointed to the clouds.

920
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,770
I was a mutant.

921
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:27,940
I could swim in the sky and age slower.

922
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:30,570
Breathe the air our ancestors breathed.

923
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:33,450
As she grew older...

924
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:38,370
my mother mourned the life on land
that she once knew...

925
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:41,950
and died with a broken heart.

926
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:48,790
She made me promise to bury her
in the soil of her homeland.

927
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:57,260
Nothing could prepare me
for what I found there.

928
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,020
Whose child is this?

929
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:21,620
Shoot!

930
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,160
Fire!

931
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:40,930
Thou art a demon.

932
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:42,970
Son of Satan.

933
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:45,140
A Spanish man of faith cursed me.

934
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:47,190
As he died by my hand...

935
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:48,400
he called me...

936
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,730
Thou art a child without love.

937
01:09:50,610 --> 01:09:51,690
The child without love.

938
01:09:53,780 --> 01:09:55,940
The child without love.

939
01:09:56,570 --> 01:09:57,950
And I took my name from there.

940
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:05,120
"Namor."

941
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:08,160
Because I have no love for the surface world.

942
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:12,250
Why are you telling me all of this?

943
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:16,720
So that you can understand why
I have to kill the scientist.

944
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,550
What if we took her to Wakanda?

945
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,010
Let us go.

946
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:23,510
I give you my word.

947
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,060
She will remain in my country.

948
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:26,810
I cannot risk that, Princess.

949
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:28,560
Then keep me instead.

950
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,190
I'd love to see your nation.

951
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:36,150
Well, you can't go down there in that.

952
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:41,660
Hypothermia will grip you
almost instantaneously.

953
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:43,990
Your blood will become toxic...

954
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:48,000
and the pressure of the ocean
will break every bone in your body.

955
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,330
Or you can wear a suit.

956
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,500
We have some of them. Come on.

957
01:10:57,590 --> 01:10:58,590
Stay close.

958
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:04,700
Hey! Namor, wait!

959
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,740
Hello.

960
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:39,440
It's beautiful.

961
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,520
It's made of vibranium.

962
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:43,730
Yes.

963
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:45,440
In the depths of the ocean...

964
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:48,070
I brought the sun to my people.

965
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:53,660
I know you wished me
to spare the life of the scientist.

966
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,240
But now you see what I have to protect.

967
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:23,190
Nakia, your hunch was correct.

968
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:26,360
I have picked up a location
on Shuri's Kimoyo earrings.

969
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:02,350
The signal is coming
from an underwater cavern...

970
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,980
approximately 140 meters below the surface.

971
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:08,900
Queen Mother, I've found her signal.

972
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:12,070
It's coming from an underwater cave.

973
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:14,910
If she's down there,
I'm sure I'll encounter resistance.

974
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:18,490
How would you like me to proceed?

975
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:23,040
Retrieve the princess by any means necessary.

976
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:26,500
I will attempt to draw Namor out.

977
01:17:01,290 --> 01:17:04,580
You are the first person from the surface
to come to Talokan.

978
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:07,630
Please take this as a token of our gratitude.

979
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,430
It was made with the plant
that saved Talokan.

980
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:21,600
You are young, Princess.

981
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:25,310
When you age as I do, you realize...

982
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,310
we all lose everyone we love.

983
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,070
But when I lost my brother...

984
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:31,820
it just felt different.

985
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,610
He suffered in silence.

986
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:37,280
When he finally asked me to help him,
I couldn't.

987
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,910
How does that make sense...

988
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:44,660
that the ancestors would give me
gifts and skills...

989
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:47,580
to help me save my brother,
and I couldn't?

990
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:50,130
Why?

991
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:55,090
I don't have an answer for that question.

992
01:17:57,220 --> 01:17:59,680
My ancestors would often say...

993
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:03,560
"Only the most broken people
can be great leaders."

994
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:09,440
I admire what you have built here.

995
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:14,280
And how you've protected your people.

996
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:18,030
But as princess of Wakanda...

997
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,660
I will not stand for you
killing that young woman.

998
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:25,500
My nation will not rest until I'm returned.

999
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:29,000
I'm not leaving without her.

1000
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:33,460
We need to find
a peaceful way to resolve this.

1001
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:38,880
It is no longer about the scientist.

1002
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:45,470
For centuries, the surface nations
have conquered and enslaved people like us.

1003
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:47,600
Over resources.

1004
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:51,310
Since the day I buried my mother...

1005
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:55,230
I have prepared my people
for the time they will come for us.

1006
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:59,610
And that machine
is the sign that the time is now.

1007
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:06,830
I need to know if Wakanda
is an ally or an enemy.

1008
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:09,120
There is no in-between.

1009
01:19:11,290 --> 01:19:14,960
So you plan to wage war
on the entire world...

1010
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:17,840
and you want Wakanda to help you?

1011
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:19,920
That's madness.

1012
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:24,800
There isn't a nation that wouldn't
plunder Wakanda if given a chance.

1013
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:28,060
If we make an alliance...

1014
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:30,940
we can protect each other
by striking them first.

1015
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:35,690
Then, when the threat of these nations
has been eliminated...

1016
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:38,530
the scientist will be returned to Wakanda.

1017
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,780
And if Wakanda does not accept, what then?

1018
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:44,820
The scientist will die.

1019
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:48,660
And Wakanda will be the first nation to fall.

1020
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,410
An attack on my people?

1021
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:52,250
Yes.

1022
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:54,790
And I want you to listen to me.

1023
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,840
Wakanda cannot win a war with Talokan.

1024
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:04,180
You have been summoned...

1025
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:05,550
K'uk'ulkan.

1026
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:14,100
I heard you that night,
with your mother at the river.

1027
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,150
You said you wanted to burn the world.

1028
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,700
Let us burn it together.

1029
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:37,460
Queen Ramonda won't sell us any vibranium.

1030
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:41,010
And now they abducted a young woman
who built the machine.

1031
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:44,130
Yeah, with all due respect,
Riri Williams is a child prodigy...

1032
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:46,470
who was running circles around
all of her professors.

1033
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:49,510
The Wakandans were recruiting her
as part of their outreach program.

1034
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,100
Nothing more. And then...

1035
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:53,640
you guys send in a SWAT team
under cover of night...

1036
01:20:53,730 --> 01:20:57,190
to arrest the Crown Princess
of an international superpower.

1037
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:03,190
The President wants to
take offensive action against Wakanda.

1038
01:21:04,570 --> 01:21:06,450
What type of offensive action?

1039
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,660
Destabilization.

1040
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:13,200
Well, Special Officer Ross is our expert.

1041
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:15,620
So, Ross, what do you think?

1042
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:18,540
My sources are telling me
that there's someone else out there.

1043
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,300
-Another nation?
-Could be. I don't know.

1044
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,630
You've gotta give me enough time
to investigate this properly...

1045
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,880
otherwise we're gonna
find ourselves at war...

1046
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:27,800
with a country whose military capacity...

1047
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:29,930
we can't even comprehend.

1048
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:32,430
Director?

1049
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:35,230
I think he's the expert.

1050
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:38,310
I think it would be a mistake
to attack Wakanda.

1051
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:45,900
Yes?

1052
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:46,990
We have a problem.

1053
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:11,050
Is my daughter alive?

1054
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:13,180
The princess is alive and well.

1055
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:16,770
She requested to be taken to Talokan.

1056
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:19,230
She will remain there for the time being.

1057
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:26,190
What can I offer you in exchange?

1058
01:22:26,570 --> 01:22:27,650
Nothing.

1059
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:29,740
I beg to differ.

1060
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:33,240
The Americans are preparing
to blame Wakanda...

1061
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:36,160
for your attack on their mining ship.

1062
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:39,330
Return my daughter and the scientist...

1063
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:43,170
or I will inform them of your existence.

1064
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,930
If you tell the Americans about us...

1065
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:55,640
if you try to find us...

1066
01:22:56,730 --> 01:23:00,520
or if I discover
a single Wakandan ship in the ocean...

1067
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:02,770
I will kill the princess.

1068
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:06,110
I will come to Wakanda...

1069
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:08,280
and I will kill you.

1070
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:18,660
So, what happened?

1071
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:23,500
He wants to go to war
with the surface world...

1072
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:25,380
and asked me to help him.

1073
01:23:29,970 --> 01:23:32,090
I need to think.

1074
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:34,220
We ain't never gettin' out of here.

1075
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,820
Drop your spear!

1076
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:49,400
Kill the Princess!

1077
01:23:55,450 --> 01:23:56,870
Drop your knife.

1078
01:23:57,330 --> 01:23:58,330
You...

1079
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,290
You killed her.

1080
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,460
Let her go

1081
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:04,630
and you don't have to die.

1082
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:08,630
Shuri...

1083
01:24:09,630 --> 01:24:11,090
Move your left arm.

1084
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:16,930
Are you okay?

1085
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,100
Are you okay?

1086
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:20,560
-Give me your Beads!
-Let's go.

1087
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:23,230
-Give me your Beads. I can save her.
-We have to go.

1088
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:25,690
Shuri, I don't know who this lady is,
but we need to listen to her.

1089
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:27,020
Listen, I hit her with a sonic round.

1090
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:29,230
It is lethal from this distance.
There is no chance.

1091
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:31,400
You don't understand. This will mean war.

1092
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:33,860
-We have to go.
-Wait!

1093
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:18,580
Did they hurt you?

1094
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,240
No. No.

1095
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:22,950
Thank you.

1096
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:24,910
You're welcome.

1097
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:27,670
-GRIOT.
-Yes, my Queen.

1098
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:29,840
Return us to Wakanda at once.

1099
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:35,470
What happened my child?

1100
01:25:37,430 --> 01:25:39,300
The Wakandans.

1101
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:41,810
They came for her.

1102
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:46,560
K'uk'ulkan...

1103
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:52,530
can you save me?

1104
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:07,250
Is she dead?

1105
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:10,750
Yes.

1106
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,720
Rest child.

1107
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:25,640
They came...

1108
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:30,110
while you spoke to the Queen?

1109
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,860
We should not have trusted her.

1110
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:38,660
The Princess has seen our home.

1111
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:41,240
What is stopping them

1112
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:43,870
from coming for Talokan?

1113
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,330
I will.

1114
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:23,780
Rise Talokan!

1115
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,910
Rise Talokan!

1116
01:27:33,130 --> 01:27:35,250
I was blinded

1117
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:36,670
by hope

1118
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,550
of partnership.

1119
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:41,510
And...

1120
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:44,470
I have compromised

1121
01:27:44,970 --> 01:27:47,100
all of us.

1122
01:27:47,850 --> 01:27:48,980
Talokan

1123
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:50,890
will not move

1124
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:52,520
again.

1125
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:54,440
Namora.

1126
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:56,440
Attuma.

1127
01:27:58,570 --> 01:28:01,570
When we are done with them

1128
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:06,830
they will never think

1129
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,040
of approaching

1130
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:10,660
Talokan!

1131
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,420
Rise Talokan!

1132
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:29,180
Princess, it is good to have you back.

1133
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,520
The city has been on edge since you left.

1134
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,440
Go.

1135
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,150
Fortify the sonic barriers for all waterways.

1136
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:37,360
Princess?

1137
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:39,230
Neka.

1138
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:43,610
Thank the ancestors.

1139
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:47,160
I just wanted to return these.

1140
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:50,450
No. Keep them.

1141
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:52,210
Might need them soon.

1142
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,130
Did you get that from down there?

1143
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,510
Is it true you saw an underwater empire?

1144
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:03,840
Yes.

1145
01:29:05,050 --> 01:29:06,760
It is beautiful.

1146
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:10,560
But these people are dangerous, Aneka.

1147
01:29:30,830 --> 01:29:33,580
So, Miss Riri Williams...

1148
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:36,420
what do you think of Wakanda?

1149
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:39,500
The stories just don't do this place justice.

1150
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:42,760
It's great.

1151
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:44,670
But I really would like to go home.

1152
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:47,680
You will need to be patient.

1153
01:29:47,890 --> 01:29:49,930
Can I at least call my mom?

1154
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:59,730
The Princess has been brought home
by the War Dog Nakia.

1155
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,190
Glory to Hanuman.

1156
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,820
Glory to Hanuman.

1157
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:07,450
The spy saves Wakanda once again.

1158
01:30:08,030 --> 01:30:09,490
The Queen will reward her...

1159
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:12,160
with lifetime banishment.
I'm sure of it.

1160
01:30:14,620 --> 01:30:16,000
Okoye.

1161
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:19,540
Thank you, my sister.

1162
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:22,960
After Thanos' attack...

1163
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:25,470
when you left without saying a word...

1164
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:27,260
it hurt.

1165
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:34,600
I regret not being there with all of you.

1166
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:37,560
It was not easy.

1167
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:39,310
He was...

1168
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:43,780
King and Black Panther to everyone.

1169
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:45,940
But to me...

1170
01:30:52,330 --> 01:30:54,120
he was everything.

1171
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,910
My T'Challa.

1172
01:30:59,290 --> 01:31:02,250
When he was taken away from me,
just like that, I...

1173
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:04,800
I had to step away...

1174
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:07,470
and let myself break.

1175
01:31:10,010 --> 01:31:12,100
I couldn't just...

1176
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:15,600
keep going as if nothing had happened,
you know.

1177
01:31:33,490 --> 01:31:34,450
We are under attack.

1178
01:31:42,170 --> 01:31:43,170
Here.

1179
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:51,050
Take this one.

1180
01:31:52,010 --> 01:31:53,680
Are you okay? Are you all right?

1181
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,720
GRIOT, activate the Sunbird.

1182
01:31:55,890 --> 01:31:56,970
Shuri, where are you?

1183
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:58,680
Making my way to the city right now.

1184
01:31:58,850 --> 01:32:00,230
Stand down! That is an order!

1185
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:02,770
Mother, I'm with Aneka.
We can provide air support.

1186
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:05,480
-Aneka, do not let her leave the lab.
-Mother, you're breaking up.

1187
01:32:05,570 --> 01:32:06,570
-We can't hear you.
-Shuri!

1188
01:32:06,650 --> 01:32:07,650
Love you. Bye!

1189
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:11,070
You just hung up on the Queen.

1190
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:12,200
I just hung up on my mom.

1191
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,950
There's a difference. Come. Let's go!

1192
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,270
Invaders!

1193
01:32:53,910 --> 01:32:57,120
Mama! Mama!

1194
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:01,580
Let us turn! Turn around!

1195
01:33:05,540 --> 01:33:08,460
EMTs are suffering a form of sonic hypnosis.

1196
01:33:11,050 --> 01:33:12,170
Take the child.

1197
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:14,180
General, plug your ears.

1198
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:15,430
Yes, my Queen.

1199
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:02,720
Can I help?

1200
01:34:02,850 --> 01:34:04,060
Come, quickly.

1201
01:34:10,940 --> 01:34:12,440
Warrior!

1202
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:15,450
Cross your arms...

1203
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:16,530
...my child.

1204
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:22,290
Nakia.

1205
01:34:22,410 --> 01:34:23,370
Yes.

1206
01:34:23,870 --> 01:34:24,870
We'll find your mama, OK?

1207
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:38,180
The fish man.

1208
01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:45,100
The defenses have been lured
away from the palace.

1209
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:47,520
It is up to you now.

1210
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:07,140
Mayday!

1211
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,680
Mayday!

1212
01:36:26,490 --> 01:36:28,410
-Shit, he's too fast.
-He's even faster in the water.

1213
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:55,980
-Activating system override.
-No.

1214
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:58,150
-Wait! I'll fix it.
-Can't leave you here, Shuri!

1215
01:37:15,460 --> 01:37:16,460
Do you see her?

1216
01:37:16,710 --> 01:37:18,040
Yes. Right there.

1217
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:32,600
Go, child.

1218
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:35,520
Wait, what? And leave you here?

1219
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:36,730
Run!

1220
01:37:51,410 --> 01:37:52,790
Okoye, move now!

1221
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:54,470
Help the child.

1222
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:01,560
She did this.

1223
01:39:05,650 --> 01:39:09,660
In one week's time,
I will return with my entire army...

1224
01:39:09,740 --> 01:39:12,990
and you will join us
against the surface world...

1225
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:16,120
or I will wash Wakanda
from the face of the Earth.

1226
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Come on, my Queen.

1227
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,080
Mother.

1228
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:22,210
-Keep her back!
-Mother!

1229
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:25,300
-Mama! Mama!
-Bury your dead.

1230
01:39:26,090 --> 01:39:27,590
Mourn your losses.

1231
01:39:30,890 --> 01:39:32,550
You are queen now.

1232
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:33,720
Mother!

1233
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:35,520
No!

1234
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,230
Get off of me!
Mother!

1235
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:42,860
Mama!

1236
01:39:49,610 --> 01:39:51,200
Mama!

1237
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:53,240
Mama!

1238
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:54,910
Mother!

1239
01:39:55,540 --> 01:39:56,620
Wake up, my Queen.

1240
01:39:58,710 --> 01:39:59,830
Let me see.

1241
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:01,500
Wake up.

1242
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:03,920
Help me!

1243
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,250
Mama!

1244
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:10,010
Wake up, Mother.

1245
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:11,890
She has passed.

1246
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,260
Mama!

1247
01:40:55,680 --> 01:41:00,850
Jabariland offers you their comfort
for your loss.

1248
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:09,150
You must mourn her...

1249
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:13,240
in accordance to the rituals
of your ancestors.

1250
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:16,990
Do not bury yourself in your technology.

1251
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:18,410
Why are you here?

1252
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:22,040
I promised your brother...

1253
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:24,420
that I would provide you with counsel...

1254
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:26,130
and protection.

1255
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:30,670
But I am in need of your advice today.

1256
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:38,180
Your tribal elders have approached me
with a proposition.

1257
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:42,890
They wish to evacuate the city
and set up camp...

1258
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:44,560
in Jabariland.

1259
01:41:44,730 --> 01:41:47,900
So, now you are keen
to hear from a child...

1260
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:50,230
who scoffs at tradition?

1261
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,490
The world...

1262
01:41:57,370 --> 01:41:59,950
The world has taken too much from you...

1263
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:04,000
for you to still be considered a child.

1264
01:42:07,130 --> 01:42:09,000
It is in my people's interest to know...

1265
01:42:09,170 --> 01:42:11,590
which way your mind is leaning.

1266
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:15,260
The elders are desperate.

1267
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:18,680
The city is vulnerable.

1268
01:42:20,930 --> 01:42:23,140
If you are to provide for them...

1269
01:42:24,270 --> 01:42:26,520
they will be in great debt to you.

1270
01:42:28,610 --> 01:42:30,270
And what of your heart?

1271
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:35,820
Which way is your heart leaning?

1272
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:40,620
I just buried the last person
who truly knew me.

1273
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:45,750
My heart was buried with her.

1274
01:43:22,910 --> 01:43:23,870
Oh, man.

1275
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:26,580
Yeah, your olive oil's about to go bad.

1276
01:43:26,830 --> 01:43:27,830
What are you doing here?

1277
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:30,580
I'm hungry. And...

1278
01:43:31,130 --> 01:43:33,130
Tragedy strikes the international community.

1279
01:43:33,290 --> 01:43:37,420
Sources can now confirm that Queen Ramonda,
daughter of Lumumba, has died.

1280
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:41,760
Western allies say that civil conflict
was the likely cause of the Queen's...

1281
01:43:44,180 --> 01:43:45,180
So...

1282
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:47,020
You have any comment?

1283
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:52,230
I wonder what else your friends
are keeping from you.

1284
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:54,150
What are you talking about?

1285
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:57,820
I have no unsanctioned contact
with the kingdom of Wakanda.

1286
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:02,410
What about the Beads?

1287
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:04,700
What?

1288
01:44:04,830 --> 01:44:05,830
The Beads.

1289
01:44:05,950 --> 01:44:07,080
I had them bugged...

1290
01:44:07,290 --> 01:44:08,960
before you ever even got there.

1291
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:13,040
I've been privy to
every conversation you've had...

1292
01:44:13,130 --> 01:44:15,710
including that treasonous call
with the Queen.

1293
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:17,210
May she rest in peace.

1294
01:44:17,630 --> 01:44:19,050
But it's good.

1295
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:20,260
Well, for us.

1296
01:44:20,430 --> 01:44:23,090
All right. You know what?
The Wakandans saved my life.

1297
01:44:23,550 --> 01:44:24,600
They're a good people.

1298
01:44:25,310 --> 01:44:27,350
You ever thought for a second...

1299
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:29,100
what they could be doing?

1300
01:44:29,310 --> 01:44:30,640
Ever thought what we would be doing...

1301
01:44:30,850 --> 01:44:33,940
if the US was the only country in the world
with vibranium?

1302
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:38,530
I actually dream about that.

1303
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:43,070
Val. Val, please.

1304
01:44:43,370 --> 01:44:45,030
It's Director de Fontaine.

1305
01:44:47,910 --> 01:44:51,080
Your mother protected me
like I was one of her own.

1306
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:54,830
The least that I could do
is try to return the favor.

1307
01:44:57,130 --> 01:44:59,630
We need to find a way to weaken Namor.

1308
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,970
Even weakened,
he's still gonna be a problem.

1309
01:45:02,130 --> 01:45:05,430
The Black Panther has never
failed to protect Wakanda.

1310
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:08,310
I thought the Black Panther was gone.

1311
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:19,320
My brother is dead.

1312
01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:23,660
But it doesn't mean
the Black Panther is gone.

1313
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:42,880
GRIOT?

1314
01:45:43,050 --> 01:45:45,760
Let's start by running
a comparative analysis...

1315
01:45:45,890 --> 01:45:49,470
between our attempts at creating
a synthetic Heart-Shaped Herb...

1316
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:54,230
and the fibers from this bracelet.

1317
01:45:54,770 --> 01:45:56,020
Yes, Princess.

1318
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:02,110
Since this was grown
from vibranium-rich soil...

1319
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:06,740
they may share some base-level similarities
that we can exploit.

1320
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:08,240
As you wish, Princess.

1321
01:46:12,580 --> 01:46:15,000
Please upload my brother's DNA also.

1322
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:16,210
Uploading now.

1323
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:49,200
Why doesn't he look like them?

1324
01:46:49,410 --> 01:46:51,580
His physiology is completely different.

1325
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:54,410
None of them fly
or have pointed ears like him.

1326
01:46:54,830 --> 01:46:56,830
The women that were guarding us,
they had water over their mouths...

1327
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,790
and on their necks.

1328
01:46:58,880 --> 01:46:59,880
He didn't have that.

1329
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:05,380
Several organisms don't need gills
to extract oxygen from the water, so...

1330
01:47:05,550 --> 01:47:07,180
It's like a jellyfish.

1331
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:11,140
He just absorbs the oxygen
from his skin.

1332
01:47:12,470 --> 01:47:14,680
-It's a process called diffusion.
-Diffusion.

1333
01:47:39,080 --> 01:47:41,790
Every day that passes
without selecting the ruler...

1334
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:43,460
is a day wasted.

1335
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:46,920
We must deal with Namor
before he brings his warriors back here.

1336
01:47:47,050 --> 01:47:49,840
And how are we to deal with a man
with that much power?

1337
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:52,350
In that attack,
before he took out your plane...

1338
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:53,890
he jumped back into the water.

1339
01:47:54,010 --> 01:47:55,770
What if that's what makes him strong?

1340
01:47:55,970 --> 01:47:59,390
He's breathing air and getting oxygen
from the water on his skin.

1341
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:02,860
If we could find a way to dry his ass out,
he won't be as strong.

1342
01:48:03,230 --> 01:48:04,400
Yo, that's it.

1343
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:05,530
GRIOT.

1344
01:48:05,610 --> 01:48:09,400
We need to convert the Royal Talon Fighter
into a pervaporation chamber.

1345
01:48:09,570 --> 01:48:10,660
Is that even possible?

1346
01:48:10,820 --> 01:48:11,910
Yes.

1347
01:48:13,490 --> 01:48:15,370
You're going to help us trap him.

1348
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:18,160
Please show Miss Williams
where she's working.

1349
01:48:18,370 --> 01:48:20,000
Right this way.

1350
01:48:23,790 --> 01:48:26,300
How old were you
when you built your first machine?

1351
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:27,460
Three.

1352
01:48:27,630 --> 01:48:31,220
My stepdad was a car mechanic.
He wanted to build airplanes.

1353
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:33,720
He gave me these tools
and let me just work it out.

1354
01:48:37,770 --> 01:48:40,020
So who taught you how to do
all that you do?

1355
01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:41,600
My big brother.

1356
01:48:44,610 --> 01:48:47,980
I was the tip of the spear
of Wakanda's army.

1357
01:48:48,150 --> 01:48:50,490
This is not me.

1358
01:48:51,070 --> 01:48:53,200
Besides, I'm a civilian now.

1359
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:55,620
I turned in my weapon.

1360
01:48:56,330 --> 01:48:57,950
I built you a new spear as well.

1361
01:48:59,790 --> 01:49:00,870
A new one?

1362
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,000
Yes.

1363
01:49:03,380 --> 01:49:05,840
What is this contraption's name anyway?

1364
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:07,340
The Midnight Angel.

1365
01:49:07,550 --> 01:49:09,010
Midnight Angel?

1366
01:49:09,130 --> 01:49:10,920
Listen to me.

1367
01:49:12,010 --> 01:49:14,220
This will even the odds against them.

1368
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:16,720
Sister, I need you to
be ready when I call you.

1369
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:19,770
Please.

1370
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:25,690
Shuri.

1371
01:49:26,270 --> 01:49:27,480
Yes.

1372
01:49:29,030 --> 01:49:30,690
How many of these did you make?

1373
01:49:32,820 --> 01:49:34,780
I looked for you at the Jabari outpost.

1374
01:49:34,950 --> 01:49:36,570
I won't be forced out of my home.

1375
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:39,330
You have such a rebellious spirit.

1376
01:49:39,410 --> 01:49:40,830
Why did you join the Dora?

1377
01:49:41,870 --> 01:49:43,040
Why do you care?

1378
01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:52,840
I still have a lot of fight left in me.

1379
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:56,390
Tell me, Aneka, daughter of Kyana...

1380
01:49:57,140 --> 01:49:59,260
do you still have some fight left in you?

1381
01:49:59,430 --> 01:50:01,930
What do you have in mind?

1382
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:27,500
GRIOT...

1383
01:50:29,170 --> 01:50:30,500
what's the confidence rate?

1384
01:50:31,250 --> 01:50:33,510
98.7%, Princess.

1385
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:37,550
Would you like me to print
the Heart-Shaped Herb?

1386
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:43,020
Hey, Shuri.

1387
01:50:43,850 --> 01:50:46,140
Thought you'd be back in Haiti by now.

1388
01:50:47,190 --> 01:50:48,810
I'm still Wakandan, you know.

1389
01:50:52,820 --> 01:50:53,820
So...

1390
01:50:55,150 --> 01:50:58,070
this is what you've been up to.

1391
01:50:58,870 --> 01:51:00,030
Yes.

1392
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:02,120
What you have here, now...

1393
01:51:03,410 --> 01:51:07,620
is a chance to restore Wakanda's protector.

1394
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:13,130
It would be the greatest gift...

1395
01:51:13,510 --> 01:51:15,970
since Bashenga's discovery.

1396
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:23,350
We'll soon find out. Come.

1397
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:27,890
-GRIOT?
-Yes, Princess.

1398
01:51:27,980 --> 01:51:28,980
Print it.

1399
01:51:33,150 --> 01:51:34,940
How will we know if it works?

1400
01:51:35,740 --> 01:51:36,950
If it glows.

1401
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:47,290
You did it!

1402
01:51:52,090 --> 01:51:54,500
I mean, shouldn't we be burning incense
or something?

1403
01:51:55,050 --> 01:51:58,220
Only Bast knows how the ancestors
will make it to this lab.

1404
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:10,480
Are you sure you don't want me to bury you?

1405
01:52:10,650 --> 01:52:11,650
No.

1406
01:52:12,190 --> 01:52:14,230
Need you to have access to my chest...

1407
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:16,480
just in case I go through cardiac arrest.

1408
01:52:17,030 --> 01:52:18,570
"Cardiac arrest"?

1409
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:20,700
She's joking...

1410
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:22,490
right?

1411
01:52:24,490 --> 01:52:25,490
Right?

1412
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:34,340
Allow this Heart-Shaped Herb...

1413
01:52:34,630 --> 01:52:37,760
to give you the strength
of the Black Panther...

1414
01:52:38,130 --> 01:52:40,590
and take you to the Ancestral Plane.

1415
01:52:43,010 --> 01:52:44,390
Ramonda.

1416
01:52:44,850 --> 01:52:49,850
We beg of you, come to your daughter.

1417
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:00,880
Mother?

1418
01:54:14,230 --> 01:54:15,480
N'Jadaka.

1419
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:17,190
Lil' cousin.

1420
01:54:17,610 --> 01:54:18,610
How?

1421
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:21,480
How is never as important as why, right?

1422
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:24,490
You chose me.

1423
01:54:24,700 --> 01:54:27,570
Impossible. I would never choose you.

1424
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:29,370
Why did you take the Herb?

1425
01:54:30,370 --> 01:54:31,370
To see my family.

1426
01:54:31,450 --> 01:54:32,450
No, that's bullshit.

1427
01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:36,370
You didn't believe the Ancestral Plane
was real, did you?

1428
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:40,500
No.

1429
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:42,510
So, why did you take it, then?

1430
01:54:44,170 --> 01:54:45,550
You don't have to lie to me.

1431
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:47,930
So I can be strong.

1432
01:54:48,220 --> 01:54:49,800
Strong to do what?

1433
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:53,680
See?

1434
01:54:55,230 --> 01:54:57,190
We're more alike than you think.

1435
01:54:59,110 --> 01:55:01,020
I took it to avenge my ancestors too.

1436
01:55:01,230 --> 01:55:02,400
I'm nothing like you.

1437
01:55:03,820 --> 01:55:05,570
You took it for yourself...

1438
01:55:05,780 --> 01:55:07,280
then destroyed the rest.

1439
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:09,990
Unworthy king...

1440
01:55:10,870 --> 01:55:12,330
afraid of being replaced.

1441
01:55:13,410 --> 01:55:14,410
Just a coward.

1442
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:15,540
No.

1443
01:55:15,750 --> 01:55:18,330
I had the courage to do
what was necessary to change Wakanda.

1444
01:55:19,750 --> 01:55:21,210
How many people like your scientist...

1445
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:23,710
did Wakanda protect
before I took the throne?

1446
01:55:24,760 --> 01:55:25,760
Cowards.

1447
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:29,010
That was the Panthers
that came before me...

1448
01:55:29,180 --> 01:55:30,180
and before T'Challa.

1449
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:32,180
Don't mention my brother.

1450
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:34,140
You're the reason why he's dead.

1451
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:37,980
You burnt the Herb,
left us with no protector.

1452
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:40,310
Then Namor struck and killed my mother.

1453
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:42,320
Their blood is on your hands.

1454
01:55:43,530 --> 01:55:44,820
That ain't on me.

1455
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:46,780
And don't you dare...

1456
01:55:46,900 --> 01:55:48,780
take that away from your mother.

1457
01:55:48,950 --> 01:55:52,490
She sacrificed her life to protect
a young girl from the lost tribe.

1458
01:55:53,830 --> 01:55:56,500
Your father, he was a hypocrite.

1459
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,790
He would've killed that girl.

1460
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:02,380
Shit, he killed his own brother.

1461
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,590
T'Challa was too noble.

1462
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:11,180
He let the man who murdered your father live.

1463
01:56:13,300 --> 01:56:14,930
And here you stand.

1464
01:56:20,650 --> 01:56:22,770
Are you gonna be noble like your brother...

1465
01:56:22,940 --> 01:56:25,030
or take care of business...

1466
01:56:25,730 --> 01:56:26,860
like me?

1467
01:56:29,610 --> 01:56:30,610
Are you okay?

1468
01:56:32,780 --> 01:56:33,990
Are you OK?

1469
01:56:36,540 --> 01:56:37,620
Who did you see?

1470
01:56:43,130 --> 01:56:44,130
No one.

1471
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:48,380
What's going on?

1472
01:56:49,090 --> 01:56:50,430
I failed.

1473
01:56:50,630 --> 01:56:51,550
It didn't work.

1474
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:52,760
Hey, Shuri.

1475
01:56:55,850 --> 01:56:56,810
They abandoned me.

1476
01:56:57,020 --> 01:56:58,180
They would never do that.

1477
01:56:58,350 --> 01:56:59,850
I did everything I was supposed to do.

1478
01:57:00,020 --> 01:57:01,310
I re-created the Herb.

1479
01:57:01,480 --> 01:57:03,860
-Okay.
-I just did your stupid ritual, and for what?

1480
01:57:04,060 --> 01:57:05,570
-Relax.
-Why didn't they come for me?

1481
01:57:05,690 --> 01:57:06,780
Just relax.

1482
01:57:13,950 --> 01:57:15,200
Shit.

1483
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:20,870
Can I get some of that too?

1484
01:57:28,340 --> 01:57:29,380
I think...

1485
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:32,380
you're going to need a suit.

1486
01:58:04,040 --> 01:58:05,960
There are more people coming from the city.

1487
01:58:06,130 --> 01:58:07,630
They need more space.

1488
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:08,840
So what?

1489
01:58:09,670 --> 01:58:12,010
You are visitors.

1490
01:58:12,170 --> 01:58:15,510
It is a wonder how anything gets done
with you people.

1491
01:58:41,120 --> 01:58:42,750
The princess!

1492
01:59:16,280 --> 01:59:17,660
She has done it!

1493
01:59:18,320 --> 01:59:21,370
The Black Panther lives!

1494
01:59:39,180 --> 01:59:41,640
Namor believes Wakanda is on her knees.

1495
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:45,480
Our Queen murdered.

1496
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:49,520
Our capital destroyed.

1497
01:59:51,270 --> 01:59:53,110
He believes we have no protector.

1498
01:59:55,070 --> 01:59:56,070
But now...

1499
01:59:57,820 --> 01:59:59,910
now is our time to strike.

1500
02:00:00,030 --> 02:00:03,660
How, when we don't even know
how to find him?

1501
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:06,000
We'll bring Namor to us.

1502
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:07,580
-Here, again?
-No.

1503
02:00:07,830 --> 02:00:10,210
A distant location at sea.

1504
02:00:10,290 --> 02:00:11,290
All right.

1505
02:00:11,750 --> 02:00:13,340
Let's say this does work.

1506
02:00:15,670 --> 02:00:17,380
Assuming we can kill this man...

1507
02:00:17,550 --> 02:00:20,590
who can fly and is potentially
as strong as the Hulk...

1508
02:00:23,260 --> 02:00:25,720
is murdering him the right solution?

1509
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:28,060
You were calling for his head...

1510
02:00:28,230 --> 02:00:30,650
when his only crime was intimidation.

1511
02:00:30,810 --> 02:00:32,560
What has changed, Lord M'Baku?

1512
02:00:32,770 --> 02:00:33,980
His soldiers...

1513
02:00:34,150 --> 02:00:35,730
did not call him General or King.

1514
02:00:35,900 --> 02:00:38,570
They called him K'uk'ulkan.

1515
02:00:38,740 --> 02:00:39,950
What is that?

1516
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:42,280
The feather serpent god.

1517
02:00:42,780 --> 02:00:43,780
What?

1518
02:00:43,950 --> 02:00:45,870
Do you think because
we are living in the mountains...

1519
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:47,950
we do not have access to books?

1520
02:00:48,460 --> 02:00:49,790
Elders...

1521
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:51,500
with your permission...

1522
02:00:51,750 --> 02:00:55,340
I would like to talk
with Lord M'Baku alone.

1523
02:00:56,300 --> 02:00:57,260
Yes.

1524
02:00:57,630 --> 02:00:58,630
Yes.

1525
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:06,810
Namor's not finished.

1526
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:11,390
He promised to destroy the surface world.

1527
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:13,900
Now is our opportunity to take him.

1528
02:01:14,020 --> 02:01:16,270
-What are you afraid of?
-War.

1529
02:01:16,730 --> 02:01:20,070
If Namor is indeed a god to his people...

1530
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:22,860
killing him will risk eternal war.

1531
02:01:23,030 --> 02:01:24,120
And so what?

1532
02:01:24,570 --> 02:01:26,950
Was my mother's life not worth eternal war?

1533
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:28,450
Of course it was.

1534
02:01:29,580 --> 02:01:33,670
Of course she was.

1535
02:01:35,670 --> 02:01:38,880
But it is not what she would
have wanted for you.

1536
02:01:44,180 --> 02:01:45,970
And it is not what I want...

1537
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:50,430
for my people.

1538
02:02:00,740 --> 02:02:03,780
You speak of my mother
as if she's still here.

1539
02:02:04,700 --> 02:02:06,700
Of what she would've wanted for me.

1540
02:02:07,780 --> 02:02:10,120
Her hopes and her dreams.

1541
02:02:13,250 --> 02:02:14,670
But she's dead.

1542
02:02:15,710 --> 02:02:16,710
She's gone!

1543
02:02:18,550 --> 02:02:22,420
Namor drowned her, right in front of me!

1544
02:02:23,760 --> 02:02:25,010
So, her dreams...

1545
02:02:25,180 --> 02:02:28,260
her goals, her hopes for me...

1546
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:32,930
it doesn't exist.

1547
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:37,190
It doesn't matter anymore.

1548
02:02:39,270 --> 02:02:42,150
What matters is what I want...

1549
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:44,990
and what I want is Namor dead!

1550
02:02:48,950 --> 02:02:51,660
And you're going to help me get it.

1551
02:02:58,170 --> 02:02:59,340
Are we clear?

1552
02:03:06,890 --> 02:03:08,600
We leave in the morning.

1553
02:03:34,410 --> 02:03:35,410
Hi.

1554
02:03:35,620 --> 02:03:36,580
Good morning.

1555
02:03:39,130 --> 02:03:40,420
If we survive this...

1556
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,220
I want you to know
you have a home with me in Haiti.

1557
02:03:48,130 --> 02:03:50,350
Here. Take my hands.

1558
02:03:53,680 --> 02:03:54,680
Breathe.

1559
02:03:59,060 --> 02:04:01,650
Shuri, I want you to be honest with me.

1560
02:04:01,730 --> 02:04:04,820
Who did you see when you took the Herb?

1561
02:04:10,030 --> 02:04:11,740
If you go to war for vengeance...

1562
02:04:11,910 --> 02:04:14,240
it will not fill the hole left from her loss.

1563
02:04:14,910 --> 02:04:16,750
It will only grow larger...

1564
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:18,420
and it will consume you.

1565
02:04:20,580 --> 02:04:21,960
It already has.

1566
02:04:27,470 --> 02:04:34,060
K'uk'ulkan, another machine to
detect vibranium is in use in the ocean.

1567
02:04:35,060 --> 02:04:36,060
Where?

1568
02:05:05,500 --> 02:05:06,670
Get out of the water!

1569
02:05:51,340 --> 02:05:52,630
For the Queen.

1570
02:07:06,750 --> 02:07:08,460
Riri, how's it going up there?

1571
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:10,250
Hey, Mr. GRIOT.

1572
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:11,760
I could really use that backup right now.

1573
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:13,880
I thought you'd never ask.

1574
02:07:19,760 --> 02:07:20,760
Shit.

1575
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:26,560
Shit, he's fast.

1576
02:07:27,190 --> 02:07:28,440
But I'm faster.

1577
02:07:48,420 --> 02:07:49,460
I got you.

1578
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:57,180
It's on you now, Shuri.

1579
02:08:06,390 --> 02:08:07,980
-Princess.
-No.

1580
02:08:08,190 --> 02:08:11,730
I am the Black Panther,
and I'm here for retribution!

1581
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:15,320
Pervaporation cells activated.

1582
02:08:24,790 --> 02:08:25,790
What's wrong?

1583
02:08:26,580 --> 02:08:27,830
You need a glass of water?

1584
02:08:31,790 --> 02:08:32,880
Yo, we got him.

1585
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:34,670
-Good!
-Namor has been captured.

1586
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:36,130
Retreat back!

1587
02:08:41,090 --> 02:08:42,510
Back to Wakanda!

1588
02:08:48,310 --> 02:08:49,310
Move out!

1589
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:15,550
What is going on?

1590
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:18,260
The sonic emitter has been destroyed.

1591
02:09:40,450 --> 02:09:41,950
That can't be good.

1592
02:10:14,020 --> 02:10:16,190
Panther, the Sea Leopard has lost power...

1593
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:18,360
and they are experiencing
significant casualties.

1594
02:10:19,940 --> 02:10:20,900
Okoye.

1595
02:10:21,110 --> 02:10:22,400
Panther.

1596
02:10:23,450 --> 02:10:24,570
Aneka.

1597
02:10:25,820 --> 02:10:26,830
Okoye.

1598
02:10:26,990 --> 02:10:28,240
It is time.

1599
02:10:39,090 --> 02:10:40,130
For Wakanda!

1600
02:10:40,920 --> 02:10:42,130
Wakanda!

1601
02:10:50,470 --> 02:10:52,140
GRIOT, what's the damage?

1602
02:10:52,270 --> 02:10:54,520
Catastrophic. His spear is
made of raw vibranium.

1603
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:57,110
-The ship could explode at any second.
-Get us to the desert.

1604
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:16,920
No!

1605
02:11:45,570 --> 02:11:47,070
Sink the ship!

1606
02:12:14,680 --> 02:12:15,680
I got you, sis.

1607
02:12:15,850 --> 02:12:16,850
Hold on.

1608
02:13:21,080 --> 02:13:22,500
Warrior!

1609
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:28,210
You speak the mother tongue?

1610
02:13:28,550 --> 02:13:30,930
You can greet your ancestors with it...

1611
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:02,290
Get off me!

1612
02:14:14,220 --> 02:14:15,510
All right, come here.

1613
02:14:18,810 --> 02:14:22,190
You will greet your ancestors.

1614
02:14:46,170 --> 02:14:47,710
May the ancestors save us...

1615
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:49,460
if the princess does not hurry.

1616
02:14:49,630 --> 02:14:51,420
We may be going to join them.

1617
02:14:52,300 --> 02:14:53,380
If so, hey...

1618
02:14:53,510 --> 02:14:55,720
let us take as many of them with us
as we can.

1619
02:15:25,830 --> 02:15:27,250
It could've been different.

1620
02:15:31,960 --> 02:15:33,340
I need water.

1621
02:15:50,110 --> 02:15:52,230
Are you gonna be noble like your brother...

1622
02:15:52,440 --> 02:15:53,820
or take care of business...

1623
02:15:53,900 --> 02:15:54,940
like me?

1624
02:15:55,110 --> 02:15:56,740
I'm not my brother.

1625
02:15:58,110 --> 02:16:00,200
Namor will beg me for mercy...

1626
02:16:00,830 --> 02:16:03,330
as I stand and watch as he dies.

1627
02:16:42,200 --> 02:16:44,660
Imperius Rex.

1628
02:16:47,290 --> 02:16:48,460
Wakanda forever!

1629
02:18:37,190 --> 02:18:38,690
Shuri.

1630
02:18:40,190 --> 02:18:41,190
Mama.

1631
02:18:44,110 --> 02:18:45,490
Show him...

1632
02:18:45,870 --> 02:18:47,330
who you are.

1633
02:18:54,290 --> 02:18:55,290
Yield...

1634
02:18:56,380 --> 02:18:58,710
and Wakanda will protect your oceans.

1635
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:01,210
We will protect your secrets.

1636
02:19:01,420 --> 02:19:02,420
Yield...

1637
02:19:03,680 --> 02:19:05,340
and your people will live.

1638
02:19:09,390 --> 02:19:11,770
Vengeance has consumed us.

1639
02:19:12,100 --> 02:19:14,850
We cannot let it consume our people.

1640
02:19:23,570 --> 02:19:25,410
I yield.

1641
02:19:50,390 --> 02:19:52,600
Talokanile'ex!

1642
02:19:54,480 --> 02:19:55,890
Let us return home.

1643
02:19:56,560 --> 02:19:57,940
Our fight here is done.

1644
02:20:10,830 --> 02:20:12,660
Wakanda forever!

1645
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:14,700
Wakanda forever!

1646
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:00,580
Thank you, my love.

1647
02:21:24,480 --> 02:21:25,570
Yo.

1648
02:21:30,110 --> 02:21:31,280
All set to head home?

1649
02:21:31,450 --> 02:21:33,910
As long as you're sure the police
won't be waiting for me at the airport.

1650
02:21:34,120 --> 02:21:35,790
Don't worry. Took care of that.

1651
02:21:35,950 --> 02:21:39,540
But you might want to slow down
on your homework-for-hire business.

1652
02:21:39,750 --> 02:21:42,080
Get caught slipping,
I can't help you with that.

1653
02:21:43,250 --> 02:21:45,210
They said you wanted
to talk to me about something?

1654
02:21:45,340 --> 02:21:46,340
Yes.

1655
02:21:46,590 --> 02:21:49,800
Your suit.
It's a great design...

1656
02:21:50,470 --> 02:21:51,590
but can't let you leave with it.

1657
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:52,970
It's all good.

1658
02:21:53,180 --> 02:21:56,100
Figured the least I could do
is help Wakanda clean up my mess.

1659
02:21:57,430 --> 02:21:58,850
I have one more thing to show you.

1660
02:21:59,310 --> 02:22:00,310
Come.

1661
02:22:04,310 --> 02:22:07,400
Took me a while to find
all the parts from the river...

1662
02:22:07,570 --> 02:22:08,990
but it was worth it.

1663
02:22:09,610 --> 02:22:10,610
How did you...

1664
02:22:11,990 --> 02:22:13,450
It's my dad's car.

1665
02:22:14,740 --> 02:22:16,490
We used to work on it before...

1666
02:22:22,460 --> 02:22:24,290
-You sure this is her?
-Every part.

1667
02:22:24,500 --> 02:22:25,960
Have it shipped to Boston.

1668
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:27,340
Be there before you arrive.

1669
02:22:33,050 --> 02:22:34,050
Bring it in, man.

1670
02:22:37,470 --> 02:22:41,770
Panther, Miss Williams' transport
has arrived.

1671
02:22:42,520 --> 02:22:43,940
Look after yourself.

1672
02:22:44,350 --> 02:22:46,770
Sure you're not trying to slide to Chicago?

1673
02:22:46,860 --> 02:22:47,940
Catch a Bulls game?

1674
02:22:49,190 --> 02:22:53,740
Sounds fun, but I have something
I need to take care of.

1675
02:23:18,390 --> 02:23:20,970
And now I present to you...

1676
02:23:21,100 --> 02:23:22,270
Princess Shuri...

1677
02:23:22,350 --> 02:23:23,690
the Black Panther!

1678
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:45,040
The Black Panther sends her regards...

1679
02:23:45,830 --> 02:23:47,790
but she will not be joining us today.

1680
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:50,880
I, M'Baku...

1681
02:23:51,090 --> 02:23:53,550
leader of the Jabari Tribe...

1682
02:23:53,720 --> 02:23:55,300
son of Wakanda...

1683
02:23:56,680 --> 02:23:58,550
wish to challenge...

1684
02:23:59,640 --> 02:24:00,720
for the throne.

1685
02:24:06,390 --> 02:24:08,100
What is troubling you, my child?

1686
02:24:09,980 --> 02:24:16,950
I looked forward to fighting
alongside you my entire life...

1687
02:24:17,910 --> 02:24:22,990
The thought of you
kneeling to the Wakandans...

1688
02:24:23,410 --> 02:24:28,170
The Black Panther
had every reason to kill me.

1689
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:32,130
Why do you think
she didn't go through with it?

1690
02:24:34,050 --> 02:24:38,470
The Black Panther is the most powerful person

1691
02:24:38,840 --> 02:24:44,640
in the most powerful nation on the surface.

1692
02:24:44,810 --> 02:24:47,810
But she has no allies.

1693
02:24:48,230 --> 02:24:52,860
Now she has empathy
for the people of Talokan.

1694
02:24:54,690 --> 02:24:56,780
With this alliance...

1695
02:24:57,450 --> 02:25:04,490
Talokan will be stronger than ever.

1696
02:25:04,910 --> 02:25:08,750
The surface world will come for Wakanda

1697
02:25:09,670 --> 02:25:12,540
and Wakanda will turn to us.

1698
02:25:14,170 --> 02:25:15,840
Trust me.

1699
02:25:32,560 --> 02:25:33,730
What the hell is this?

1700
02:25:33,940 --> 02:25:35,150
Can we turn around?

1701
02:25:36,820 --> 02:25:38,780
I don't know, man. We'll lose an hour.

1702
02:25:40,160 --> 02:25:41,610
Why don't you go check it out?

1703
02:25:41,740 --> 02:25:42,950
Okay.

1704
02:25:45,790 --> 02:25:47,080
Yeah, this is Shauver.

1705
02:25:47,450 --> 02:25:49,460
Yeah, looks like we got
a tree blocking our way.

1706
02:25:49,620 --> 02:25:51,420
How do you want us to proceed?

1707
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:52,880
What the...

1708
02:26:04,930 --> 02:26:07,180
A colonizer in chains.

1709
02:26:07,930 --> 02:26:10,020
Now I have seen everything.

1710
02:26:10,190 --> 02:26:11,190
Funny.

1711
02:26:11,940 --> 02:26:12,980
Let's go.

1712
02:26:39,710 --> 02:26:40,720
Thank you.

1713
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:41,800
You're welcome.

1714
02:26:46,760 --> 02:26:47,760
Hey.

1715
02:26:49,100 --> 02:26:50,730
Welcome!

1716
02:26:52,520 --> 02:26:53,940
It's good to see you.

1717
02:26:54,690 --> 02:26:55,900
Everything is ready.

1718
02:26:56,060 --> 02:26:57,400
Just give me one moment, eh?

1719
02:26:57,570 --> 02:26:58,940
Actually...

1720
02:26:59,110 --> 02:27:00,940
I think I should do it on my own.

1721
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:03,530
Of course.

1722
02:31:38,600 --> 02:31:39,600
Shuri...

1723
02:31:40,850 --> 02:31:42,640
can we join you now?

1724
02:31:45,730 --> 02:31:48,770
This is my son, Toussaint.

1725
02:31:49,940 --> 02:31:50,940
Toussaint...

1726
02:31:51,530 --> 02:31:54,650
this is your aunty, Shuri.

1727
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:57,160
Hi.

1728
02:32:18,090 --> 02:32:20,680
We agreed it was better for him
to grow up here.

1729
02:32:20,930 --> 02:32:24,020
Away from the pressure of the throne.

1730
02:32:25,390 --> 02:32:26,600
Your father...

1731
02:32:27,230 --> 02:32:28,940
your baba...

1732
02:32:29,110 --> 02:32:31,820
prepared us for his death, didn't he?

1733
02:32:36,400 --> 02:32:38,450
But he didn't want us to go to the funeral...

1734
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:42,240
because he felt the time was not yet right.

1735
02:32:42,990 --> 02:32:45,710
So we had our own ceremony for him here.

1736
02:32:47,500 --> 02:32:49,080
Did my mother meet him?

1737
02:32:49,170 --> 02:32:50,170
She did.

1738
02:32:59,800 --> 02:33:00,850
It's nice to meet you.

1739
02:33:01,050 --> 02:33:02,260
Nice to meet you.

1740
02:33:02,390 --> 02:33:04,020
Toussaint is a beautiful name.

1741
02:33:04,430 --> 02:33:06,600
It holds a great history.

1742
02:33:06,810 --> 02:33:10,110
Thanks. Yours is cool, too, I guess.

1743
02:33:13,400 --> 02:33:15,490
My mom says you are good
at keeping secrets.

1744
02:33:15,570 --> 02:33:16,650
Is that true?

1745
02:33:17,820 --> 02:33:20,700
Yes, I can keep a good secret.

1746
02:33:23,700 --> 02:33:26,040
Toussaint is my Haitian name.

1747
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:30,170
Who are you?

1748
02:33:31,080 --> 02:33:35,300
My name is Prince T'Challa,
son of King T'Challa.
