1
00:00:33,568 --> 00:00:35,027
-What's up?
-How's it going?

2
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,451
All right.

3
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:07,894
What you need?

4
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:13,483
You buying
or you just stopping to envy?

5
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:20,239
Yeah. Punk bitches.

6
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:07,120
<i>Please leave your message

00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:10,289
<i>Record your message after the tone.

8
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:11,624
Bounce, little man.

9
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:15,336
Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine,
getting eyeballed hard.

10
00:02:15,545 --> 00:02:17,797
I got a bad feeling, man.
I need some backup.

11
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:20,299
Get your ass up here now.

12
00:02:23,845 --> 00:02:27,098
-What's that thing in your ear?
-What did I say? Get out of here!

13
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:30,309
What are you waiting for? Go!

14
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,879
Well, Walt, we've made such headway
with your treatments...

15
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:43,299
...that now it's time we talked about
sealing the deal.

16
00:03:43,508 --> 00:03:44,759
Absolutely.

17
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:46,344
As you know...

18
00:03:46,552 --> 00:03:49,555
...my initial diagnosis was
that your cancer was inoperable.

19
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:53,518
That may no longer be the case.

20
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:58,231
We think now that a lobectomy
may be a viable option.

21
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,233
Maybe a pretty good option.

22
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:03,111
Dr. Bravenec is one of
the few surgeons in the country...

23
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,905
...performing lobectomies
after full-dosage radiation.

24
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:08,449
He's got a good track record.

25
00:04:08,658 --> 00:04:10,243
Pretty good.

26
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:12,995
It sounds...

27
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:15,415
...aggressive.

28
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:17,750
Yes. Very much so.

29
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,753
Understand that
if you don't have this surgery...

30
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:23,256
...you're just waiting
for the cancer to spread.

31
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,591
And it will.

32
00:04:26,426 --> 00:04:29,470
Through the treatment you've had,
we've bought you some time.

33
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:32,765
Maybe a lot, probably a little...

34
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,435
...but that's all.

35
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:37,437
In my opinion...

36
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,939
...if you're willing to take some risk...

37
00:04:40,148 --> 00:04:42,275
...then this offers the best chance.

38
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:52,869
How much would it cost?
I mean, I'm not on your insurance.

39
00:04:53,077 --> 00:04:55,872
I'd say between 170-...

40
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,499
...and 200,000, all in.

41
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:02,295
For my part, I'd be willing
to write off what I can...

42
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:05,298
...but mine isn't even
the biggest expense.

43
00:05:07,383 --> 00:05:10,970
This is obviously a big decision...

44
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:14,474
...and you folks are gonna wanna
take some time to discuss it.

45
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:16,893
No.

46
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:19,353
I'll do it.

47
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,322
Walt, don't you think we should
at least talk this through first?

48
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:33,618
I just think it's the way to go.

49
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:41,000
I have to say,
I think it's the right choice.

50
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:44,295
I recommend
that we let the pneumonitis heal...

51
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:46,297
...for another couple of weeks...

52
00:05:46,506 --> 00:05:48,800
...and then we'll have at it.

53
00:05:50,218 --> 00:05:52,261
That's tricky.

54
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:58,518
-When's the due date?
-It's the 21 st.

55
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:00,061
So two weeks and change?

56
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:02,480
I'll book the surgery
for four weeks from now.

57
00:06:02,688 --> 00:06:05,817
That way Walter can be on his feet
for the birth of your daughter.

58
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:09,362
But I wouldn't wait any longer.

59
00:06:10,947 --> 00:06:12,365
Yeah.

60
00:06:29,507 --> 00:06:32,051
Fourteen messages....

61
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,137
God.

62
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:38,683
<i>-Yeah.
-It's me.</i>

63
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:42,311
<i>Where the hell were you?
I called, like, 20 times.</i>

64
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,896
Working.

65
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:45,440
What is it?

66
00:06:48,568 --> 00:06:50,194
Combo's dead.

67
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,405
<i>Shot.</i>

68
00:06:54,115 --> 00:06:55,241
Which one is he?

69
00:06:56,492 --> 00:06:58,077
You did not just say that to me.

70
00:06:58,286 --> 00:07:00,747
<i>-Jesse, listen--
-That figures.</i>

71
00:07:13,468 --> 00:07:15,053
What's the word on the street?

72
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:17,889
No one's dropping no names.

73
00:07:18,097 --> 00:07:21,267
Combo rang me before it went down,
said dudes were mad-dogging him...

74
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:25,271
...trying to run him up off the corner.
That's all I know.

75
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:30,777
Why'd we have to go pushing
into new turf, yo? I mean...

76
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:32,779
...what'd you expect?

77
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:35,323
I don't know.

78
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:37,200
You don't know?

79
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:40,244
Is that all you got?

80
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:44,290
I'll do right by Combo's people.

81
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:50,755
But make sure you bust up your cell
and toss it, all right? We'll figure it out.

82
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:55,635
I appreciate what
you're saying and all...

83
00:07:55,843 --> 00:08:00,264
...but with Combo gone
and Badger laying low out in Cali....

84
00:08:01,265 --> 00:08:02,725
I'm on probation, man.

85
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:05,812
Fast track to Los Lunas.

86
00:08:07,438 --> 00:08:09,399
We're on the verge...

87
00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:13,820
...of making some serious coin,
Skinny.

88
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:16,489
What, you're gonna jump ship now?

89
00:08:18,324 --> 00:08:22,328
This game we playing? We don't got
the street cred to survive it.

90
00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:25,289
Back when everyone thought
you killed Spooge...

91
00:08:25,498 --> 00:08:28,376
...maybe we were doing okay,
but that whole...

92
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:31,879
-...thing to the head thing, the ATM?
-Yeah?

93
00:08:32,088 --> 00:08:33,840
His junkie bitch copped to it.

94
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:37,009
Whole town knows it wasn't you.

95
00:08:42,014 --> 00:08:43,516
Everyone knows?

96
00:08:45,685 --> 00:08:49,355
-Why didn't you say something?
-I don't know, man.

97
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:51,023
Because we like you and all.

98
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:54,360
I'm telling you, just sit tight.

99
00:08:55,236 --> 00:08:56,529
We'll get by.

100
00:08:56,738 --> 00:09:00,533
-All right? We'll make it.
-Sorry, Jesse.

101
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:02,869
I'm out.

102
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:16,758
We have had a bit of a setback.

103
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:20,970
That's an accurate description.
What else do you want me to call it?

104
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:23,973
-How about "your fault"?
-No, no, don't lay that on me.

105
00:09:24,182 --> 00:09:27,351
-You are in charge of distribution.
-You said expand the territory.

106
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,979
-Doesn't mean you become careless.
-Guys, guys! Hey!

107
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:33,066
Do I look like Maury Povich?
I'm not your marriage counsellor.

108
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:35,902
Now, you're professionals.
Act like it.

109
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,154
Now, setback. Go.

110
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:42,450
One of our dealers was murdered.

111
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:47,580
It was some kind of turf dispute...

112
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:49,916
...and apparently we lost.

113
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,834
And then everyone quit on us.

114
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:55,922
I mean,
we have absolutely no distribution.

115
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,591
Is there any way any of this
can be traced back to you?

116
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,843
Now, the police, I'm talking about.

117
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:05,598
Well, there's your silver lining.

118
00:10:05,807 --> 00:10:08,601
How about you?
How's the health situation?

119
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:12,105
It's better. Do you mind?

120
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:13,773
Better?

121
00:10:15,274 --> 00:10:17,151
Yeah, it's...

122
00:10:19,195 --> 00:10:23,408
...looking a little more positive.

123
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:25,368
I may have more time than I thought.

124
00:10:25,576 --> 00:10:27,412
Outstanding.

125
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,914
Now, as to your dead guy:

126
00:10:30,123 --> 00:10:31,916
occupational hazard.

127
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:33,376
Drug dealer getting shot?

128
00:10:33,584 --> 00:10:37,630
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say it's been known to happen.

129
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,925
Now, what about product on hand?
How's your inventory?

130
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:45,304
Thirty-eight and change.

131
00:10:45,513 --> 00:10:47,390
Thirty-eight ounces? Grams?

132
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:48,808
Pounds.

133
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:54,272
You did say make hay
while the sun is shining.

134
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,566
Guys!

135
00:10:56,774 --> 00:10:58,651
Why the long faces here?

136
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,987
You're sitting on a gold mine.

137
00:11:01,195 --> 00:11:03,281
A gold mine we can't sell.

138
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:05,783
We need a proper infrastructure.

139
00:11:05,992 --> 00:11:08,327
We need foot soldiers
and we need dealers...

140
00:11:08,536 --> 00:11:10,371
...on a street level
that are rock solid.

141
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,666
We need muscle
and we need enforcers.

142
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,835
Payback. That's what we need.

143
00:11:20,965 --> 00:11:22,508
God.

144
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:27,638
I mean, this entire process
has just been so....

145
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:34,687
It's always been one step forward
and two steps back.

146
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:37,398
We need your help.

147
00:11:38,983 --> 00:11:41,694
Look, let's start with
some tough love, all right?

148
00:11:41,903 --> 00:11:43,571
Ready for this? Here goes.

149
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,700
You two suck at peddling meth.
Period.

150
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:50,370
So give up on trying
to do it all yourselves.

151
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:52,997
Hell, I'm amazed you got this far.

152
00:11:53,206 --> 00:11:57,627
Look, we are not going to deal with
another high-level distributor.

153
00:11:57,835 --> 00:12:00,046
No, thank you.
We have been down that road.

154
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:02,882
What, some tattooed speed freak?

155
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:06,511
No. What you two need
is an honest-to-God businessman.

156
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:08,513
Somebody who treats your product...

157
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:12,100
...like the simple
high-margin commodity that it is.

158
00:12:12,308 --> 00:12:15,520
Somebody who ships out of town,
deals only in bulk.

159
00:12:15,728 --> 00:12:20,066
Someone who's been doing this
for 20 years and never been caught.

160
00:12:22,235 --> 00:12:23,903
You know someone like that?

161
00:12:24,112 --> 00:12:28,074
Let's just say I know a guy
who knows a guy.

162
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:30,159
Who knows another guy.

163
00:12:30,368 --> 00:12:34,205
Let me make some calls,
see if I can get you a meeting.

164
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:38,251
Well, what's his name?

165
00:12:39,585 --> 00:12:41,045
I have no idea.

166
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:45,717
He's very low profile.
He's careful like that.

167
00:12:46,884 --> 00:12:49,053
You know,
from what I do hear about him...

168
00:12:49,262 --> 00:12:51,264
...he sounds a little like you.

169
00:12:56,227 --> 00:12:59,063
<i>And McDonald tabletops it, lands it.</i>

170
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:01,858
<i>He's coming to the end
and he's got the big fist pump.</i>

171
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:05,111
<i>Now Mueller's coming.
Oh, a double! Here he comes.</i>

172
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:08,865
<i>And he's coming to the end
and he takes second.</i>

173
00:13:09,073 --> 00:13:11,117
I need you to leave.

174
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:22,086
Look, there's...

175
00:13:23,087 --> 00:13:26,174
...some stuff about me
you don't know and....

176
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:31,721
Like you're a drug dealer?

177
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:35,058
I kind of got that.

178
00:13:36,476 --> 00:13:40,396
You pay in cash
and you use an alias, so....

179
00:13:46,694 --> 00:13:49,155
One of my guys...

180
00:13:49,906 --> 00:13:52,742
...a friend who worked for me...

181
00:13:53,868 --> 00:13:55,119
...got murdered.

182
00:13:56,996 --> 00:13:59,248
It was my fault.
I put him on that corner.

183
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:05,171
I'm gonna smoke some crystal
and I just think you should go...

184
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,425
...being that you're in a programme
and all and....

185
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:14,472
You could come with me
to a meeting.

186
00:14:16,516 --> 00:14:18,101
No.

187
00:14:19,268 --> 00:14:20,812
No meetings.

188
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:25,274
We could just get out of here.

189
00:14:27,652 --> 00:14:31,948
-It won't help.
-Yeah, it will.

190
00:14:32,156 --> 00:14:34,617
And I don't need you
telling me that it won't.

191
00:14:34,826 --> 00:14:36,369
I just....

192
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:40,331
All right, I really just need you to go.

193
00:15:47,982 --> 00:15:49,942
Sir? Enjoy your meal.

194
00:15:50,151 --> 00:15:51,736
Thank you.

195
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:24,685
You're late.

196
00:16:26,187 --> 00:16:27,480
Yeah.

197
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:30,483
We're in the big time now.

198
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:33,403
So where's the kingpin?

199
00:16:34,195 --> 00:16:36,823
Your guess is as good as mine.

200
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,995
So you get the dude's name?

201
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:44,831
Nope.

202
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:48,292
So let me get this straight.
He's allowed to know all our names...

203
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:51,587
...what we look like,
but not the other way around?

204
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:57,176
Why don't you get yourself
some food?

205
00:16:57,385 --> 00:16:59,637
So we won't both sit here
with our Happy Meals...

206
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:01,514
...looking like a couple chumps?

207
00:17:01,723 --> 00:17:04,517
Gentlemen,
is everything to your satisfaction?

208
00:17:05,017 --> 00:17:06,269
Fine, thanks.

209
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:11,482
This is nothing but an ankle-grab.

210
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,776
I don't get you, man.

211
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:17,780
A week ago you talked like
you were all ready to hang it up.

212
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,326
We've nearly got 40 pounds
we still need to sell.

213
00:17:22,535 --> 00:17:24,287
Yeah, what about after?

214
00:17:24,495 --> 00:17:27,874
After you gonna make up
some new magic number?

215
00:17:28,082 --> 00:17:30,543
Like, "I got bills. I got bills.
I gotta make more."

216
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:32,879
What do you want me to say, Jesse?

217
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:36,674
-Things have changed.
-Oh, I know.

218
00:17:37,508 --> 00:17:39,302
We got a guy killed.

219
00:17:42,972 --> 00:17:44,640
You know what?

220
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,351
This is bullshit.

221
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:50,396
-I'm out of here.
-Hey.

222
00:18:00,281 --> 00:18:03,409
I think she's waking up from a nap.

223
00:18:03,618 --> 00:18:07,038
She is certainly gonna wanna get out
and stretch those legs soon.

224
00:18:11,584 --> 00:18:13,252
We have to keep an eye
on your fluids.

225
00:18:13,461 --> 00:18:15,129
You're on the low side of normal.

226
00:18:15,338 --> 00:18:17,924
What? How low?

227
00:18:18,132 --> 00:18:21,260
It's not a problem unless we see
a growth drop-off, so we're good.

228
00:18:21,469 --> 00:18:24,972
We'll have you in for an ultrasound
next week and keep an eye on things.

229
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:27,934
Hey.

230
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:30,269
Oh, man,
you would not believe the traffic.

231
00:18:30,478 --> 00:18:32,438
That's why I left 40 minutes early.

232
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:34,649
-Sorry. Hi.
-Hi.

233
00:18:34,857 --> 00:18:37,276
-What did I miss?
-For your refrigerator.

234
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:39,570
Oh, my God.

235
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:40,988
Look at her.

236
00:18:41,197 --> 00:18:42,615
-Look.
-Yeah.

237
00:18:42,824 --> 00:18:45,451
God. It's like she's here already.

238
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,247
I was just telling Skyler
everything looks great.

239
00:18:49,455 --> 00:18:51,666
Okay, we've been talking
about it for months now.

240
00:18:51,874 --> 00:18:53,793
It's time to make a decision.

241
00:18:54,001 --> 00:18:57,130
-You know what I'm gonna say.
-The C-section?

242
00:18:57,338 --> 00:18:59,590
And if it's a yes,
we need to schedule it.

243
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:05,722
Well, my last labour
was pretty tough, so....

244
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,850
For the baby, I say yes.

245
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:11,811
I agree, considering that your fluids
are on the low side.

246
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:16,315
It's best we take her a little early.
So why don't we schedule it for...

247
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:17,984
...a week from Friday?

248
00:19:20,862 --> 00:19:22,655
Isn't that a Friday the 13th?

249
00:19:27,368 --> 00:19:29,203
We have a birthday.

250
00:19:29,704 --> 00:19:31,247
The 16th.

251
00:19:31,456 --> 00:19:33,583
-I like it.
-Yeah.

252
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:37,086
You know, speaking of birthdays...

253
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:40,840
...I've got to run back to the office,
so I will see you later?

254
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:43,843
It's an hour before closing.

255
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:46,095
You're supposed to be
taking it easy.

256
00:19:46,304 --> 00:19:48,514
We're having a get-together
for Ted's birthday...

257
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:50,349
...and I've gotta pick up the cake.

258
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,101
Why you?

259
00:19:53,061 --> 00:19:56,814
Because I said I would...?

260
00:19:57,023 --> 00:19:59,609
It is the least I can do.

261
00:20:00,443 --> 00:20:02,737
-Okay?
-Yeah, okay. Yeah.

262
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:04,322
-Bye.
-Bye.

263
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,914
Let's get out of here.

264
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:57,333
You know, go do something.

265
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:00,628
Seriously.

266
00:21:00,962 --> 00:21:04,257
You know that museum in Santa Fe
you talked about?

267
00:21:04,841 --> 00:21:06,801
Let's take a drive.

268
00:21:10,847 --> 00:21:12,432
Sure.

269
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,911
No, I cannot return that stock.
It's been drilled, it's been cut.

270
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,039
We're halfway through the job.

271
00:21:36,622 --> 00:21:41,127
<i>Mr. Beneke to the shop, please.
Mr. Beneke to the shop.</i>

272
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:44,922
All right.
Just let me think about it, okay?

273
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:46,382
I gotta go.

274
00:21:46,591 --> 00:21:48,593
Dean, I gotta go.

275
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:50,970
Okay, all right.

276
00:21:53,973 --> 00:21:56,809
Happy birthday!

277
00:21:57,685 --> 00:21:58,978
Happy birthday!

278
00:21:59,187 --> 00:22:02,398
Oh, my God. This is beautiful, guys.
Thank you very much.

279
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:05,318
Hurry. These candles aren't gonna
hold out much longer.

280
00:22:06,152 --> 00:22:09,155
Wait a minute. You making a wish?
You gotta make a wish.

281
00:22:09,364 --> 00:22:13,242
Okay. Well, let's see.
The economy's in the toilet.

282
00:22:13,451 --> 00:22:16,662
China's undercutting us at every turn.
I'm at a loss.

283
00:22:18,956 --> 00:22:21,501
-Wait. Skyler?
-Yes?

284
00:22:21,709 --> 00:22:23,294
I wanna hear it first.

285
00:22:24,212 --> 00:22:25,755
Absolutely not. No way.

286
00:22:25,963 --> 00:22:28,216
You cannot deny your employer
his birthday wish.

287
00:22:28,424 --> 00:22:31,177
-Yes, I can. Watch me.
-Please!

288
00:22:31,386 --> 00:22:35,181
If this is your birthday wish,
I feel very, very sorry for you.

289
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,851
-Come on. It was so good last time.
-It was ages ago.

290
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,938
And I'm enormous now.

291
00:22:42,146 --> 00:22:44,357
And I don't look anything
like her anymore.

292
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:46,859
Not that I ever did. I mean, come on.

293
00:22:47,068 --> 00:22:49,487
These candles are getting wax
all over the place.

294
00:22:49,696 --> 00:22:51,447
-Seriously.
-Yes, come on, Skyler.

295
00:22:51,656 --> 00:22:56,369
<i>-Skyler, Skyler, Skyler....
-It's obscene.</i>

296
00:22:56,577 --> 00:22:59,539
<i>Skyler, Skyler, Skyler....</i>

297
00:23:09,841 --> 00:23:15,221
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

298
00:23:16,597 --> 00:23:22,061
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

299
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:29,819
<i>Happy birthday, Mr. President</i>

300
00:23:30,028 --> 00:23:34,323
<i>Of Beneke Fabricators Incorporated</i>

301
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,911
<i>Happy birthday</i>

302
00:23:40,455 --> 00:23:43,583
<i>To you</i>

303
00:23:47,587 --> 00:23:49,255
That was fantastic.

304
00:23:49,464 --> 00:23:51,299
Isn't she great, huh?

305
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,885
Okay, here we go.

306
00:24:05,897 --> 00:24:08,608
<i>-He wasn't there.
-Oh, he was there, all right.</i>

307
00:24:08,816 --> 00:24:11,361
What are you talking about?
I sat there for two hours.

308
00:24:11,569 --> 00:24:12,695
Nobody came.

309
00:24:12,904 --> 00:24:15,531
<i>All I know is my contact
said he was there.</i>

310
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,992
Are you sure you were
at the right restaurant?

311
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:20,036
<i>Yes, I'm positive.</i>

312
00:24:20,244 --> 00:24:21,746
<i>-Where was he?
-Who knows?</i>

313
00:24:21,954 --> 00:24:24,624
Maybe he checked you out
with a telephoto lens...

314
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,626
...didn't like the cut of your jib.

315
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:31,214
Anyway, it doesn't matter now
because my contact says it's a no-go.

316
00:24:32,215 --> 00:24:33,883
What? What do you mean?

317
00:24:34,092 --> 00:24:35,468
No deal. No dice.

318
00:24:35,676 --> 00:24:37,637
Shot at and missed. Shit on and hit.

319
00:24:38,096 --> 00:24:39,097
Wait a minute.

320
00:24:39,305 --> 00:24:41,808
How can he make that decision
without even meeting me?

321
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:45,144
<i>I told you, he's very cautious
who he does business with, all right?</i>

322
00:24:45,978 --> 00:24:49,816
He's skittish, like a deer.

323
00:24:51,693 --> 00:24:53,069
Call him back.

324
00:24:53,277 --> 00:24:55,321
<i>I'm sorry. I can't do that.</i>

325
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:58,157
Yes, you can. Call him, Saul.

326
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:00,618
First of all,
I never called him, all right?

327
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:03,079
I called a guy who called a guy
who called a guy.

328
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:04,956
Second of all, it's over.

329
00:25:05,164 --> 00:25:07,625
<i>Understand?
With this particular individual...</i>

330
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:10,211
<i>...all you get is the one shot.</i>

331
00:25:11,462 --> 00:25:12,672
Look...

332
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,508
...I'll see if I can scrape
something else together...

333
00:25:15,717 --> 00:25:17,468
...but don't get your hopes up.

334
00:25:17,677 --> 00:25:20,430
<i>No one else handles
that kind of bulk.</i>

335
00:25:20,638 --> 00:25:22,181
Damn it.

336
00:27:02,657 --> 00:27:05,702
Lucy, you must remember to have
the salt and pepper shakers wiped.

337
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:14,794
Can I help you, sir?

338
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:18,923
Diet Coke, please.

339
00:27:21,008 --> 00:27:23,886
And five minutes of your time.

340
00:27:34,439 --> 00:27:37,150
-What can I do for you?
-Have a seat.

341
00:27:39,027 --> 00:27:40,486
Please.

342
00:27:51,998 --> 00:27:56,210
I would like to know why you wouldn't
meet with me yesterday.

343
00:27:57,587 --> 00:28:00,298
I'm sorry. I'm not following.

344
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,053
I sat here yesterday,
waiting to meet with someone.

345
00:28:05,803 --> 00:28:08,264
I believe that person was you.

346
00:28:08,723 --> 00:28:12,018
I think that you're confusing me
for someone else.

347
00:28:13,352 --> 00:28:14,771
I don't think I am.

348
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,735
Sir, if you have a complaint...

349
00:28:20,943 --> 00:28:23,196
...I suggest you submit it
through our e-mail system.

350
00:28:23,404 --> 00:28:25,865
I would be happy to refer you
to our website.

351
00:28:27,408 --> 00:28:30,328
I was told that the man
I would be meeting with...

352
00:28:30,536 --> 00:28:32,830
...is very careful.

353
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,041
A cautious man.

354
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:38,753
I believe we're alike in that way.

355
00:28:40,838 --> 00:28:44,509
If you are who I think you are...

356
00:28:45,051 --> 00:28:47,136
...you should give me another chance.

357
00:28:52,225 --> 00:28:55,061
I don't think we're alike at all,
Mr. White.

358
00:28:56,896 --> 00:28:59,691
You are not a cautious man at all.

359
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:02,902
Your partner was late
and he was high.

360
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,823
Yes. Yes, he was.

361
00:29:07,615 --> 00:29:10,827
He's high often, isn't he?

362
00:29:14,414 --> 00:29:16,207
You have poor judgement.

363
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,669
I can't work with someone
with poor judgement.

364
00:29:19,877 --> 00:29:23,005
Are you familiar with my product?

365
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:27,218
-I've been told it's excellent.
-It is impeccable.

366
00:29:28,469 --> 00:29:29,887
It is the purest...

367
00:29:30,096 --> 00:29:33,558
...most chemically sound product
on the market anywhere.

368
00:29:33,766 --> 00:29:36,102
That is not the only factor.

369
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:40,273
You could charge twice the current rate
for what I provide...

370
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:42,942
...and your customers would pay it.

371
00:29:43,484 --> 00:29:45,236
Hands down.

372
00:29:45,987 --> 00:29:52,410
Now, who I choose to do business with
on my end is not your problem.

373
00:29:53,327 --> 00:29:54,620
You won't see him.

374
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:57,582
You won't interact with him.

375
00:29:58,166 --> 00:29:59,792
Forget he exists.

376
00:30:01,252 --> 00:30:03,629
I have to ask.

377
00:30:05,381 --> 00:30:06,466
Why?

378
00:30:06,674 --> 00:30:08,468
Why him?

379
00:30:10,845 --> 00:30:13,681
Because he does what I say.

380
00:30:15,141 --> 00:30:17,560
Because I can trust him.

381
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,314
How much product
do you have on hand?

382
00:30:22,106 --> 00:30:23,983
Thirty-eight pounds.

383
00:30:24,192 --> 00:30:26,819
Ready to go at a moment's notice.

384
00:30:33,076 --> 00:30:34,911
Will I hear from you?

385
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,956
I have your numbers.

386
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:47,131
You can never trust a drug addict.

387
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:04,857
Look, I mean, it's all kind of
little dribs and drabs...

388
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:08,236
...but right here,
take Keller, for instance.

389
00:31:08,444 --> 00:31:11,989
A couple hundred dollars here,
a few thousand there.

390
00:31:12,198 --> 00:31:13,741
Dribs and drabs.

391
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,035
Once you add it all up, though,
with Keller...

392
00:31:16,244 --> 00:31:19,706
...the revenues are almost 10 percent
less than was actually received.

393
00:31:19,914 --> 00:31:25,002
And this is every quarter
for the last two years.

394
00:31:27,922 --> 00:31:31,676
When I saw that, I got worried
so I checked Accounts Receivable.

395
00:31:31,884 --> 00:31:34,887
I found six other instances...

396
00:31:36,055 --> 00:31:38,599
...of revenues being under-reported.

397
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,311
And I've only just started
to look into it.

398
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,898
We have requirement contracts
with a lot of these companies.

399
00:31:46,107 --> 00:31:48,359
They anticipate their needs
for the next quarter.

400
00:31:48,568 --> 00:31:50,445
Most of the time, they overestimate.

401
00:31:50,653 --> 00:31:53,072
I let them roll their overages
into the next order...

402
00:31:53,281 --> 00:31:55,408
...and if I don't, they'll go elsewhere.

403
00:31:55,616 --> 00:31:57,243
Obviously, we forgot...

404
00:31:57,452 --> 00:32:01,456
...or didn't go back
and adjust the revenue entries.

405
00:32:01,664 --> 00:32:04,917
I know it's wrong from an accounting
standpoint, but as you can see...

406
00:32:05,126 --> 00:32:08,755
...the money's coming in eventually,
as you can see.

407
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:11,215
Right.

408
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:13,009
Right...

409
00:32:13,217 --> 00:32:17,847
...but I got the old bills of sale
and order forms out of storage...

410
00:32:18,056 --> 00:32:20,433
...to try and sort this out.

411
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:25,605
Most of the time, there's no backup
for the reported revenues at all.

412
00:32:27,023 --> 00:32:29,108
In a few cases...

413
00:32:30,526 --> 00:32:33,780
...I found xeroxed copies
with the dates changed.

414
00:32:36,824 --> 00:32:38,534
Ted.

415
00:32:48,711 --> 00:32:50,338
All right.

416
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,716
You got me.

417
00:32:54,258 --> 00:32:59,138
We're talking nearly a million dollars
of undocumented revenue.

418
00:32:59,597 --> 00:33:02,725
-What are you thinking?
-I'm thinking...

419
00:33:02,934 --> 00:33:05,103
...about saving a company.

420
00:33:05,311 --> 00:33:07,105
I'm thinking about people's jobs...

421
00:33:07,313 --> 00:33:09,107
...about their mortgages
and pensions...

422
00:33:09,315 --> 00:33:12,610
...and their college funds
for their kids.

423
00:33:13,444 --> 00:33:14,654
Not to mention my own.

424
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:17,448
It doesn't mean that you have to
break the law.

425
00:33:17,657 --> 00:33:19,325
Yes, it does, Skyler.

426
00:33:19,534 --> 00:33:21,452
It's in the books.
Business is terrible.

427
00:33:21,661 --> 00:33:24,956
The bank is on my back,
the IRS is grinding me down to a nub.

428
00:33:25,164 --> 00:33:26,624
-If I don't keep up--
-Ted.

429
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:29,669
People go to prison for this.

430
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:38,761
My dad built this company
from nothing.

431
00:33:39,637 --> 00:33:42,098
We make things here.

432
00:33:42,306 --> 00:33:45,351
The people who work here
are like family.

433
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:49,647
I can't let that all fall apart
because of a couple of bad years.

434
00:33:54,277 --> 00:33:55,319
Sky...

435
00:33:58,114 --> 00:34:00,116
...don't report this.

436
00:34:01,117 --> 00:34:02,702
Please.

437
00:34:04,954 --> 00:34:07,582
I'm not gonna turn you in, Ted.

438
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,881
But I can't be a part of it.

439
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:19,427
I know.

440
00:34:20,053 --> 00:34:22,305
I know. I just wish....

441
00:34:23,431 --> 00:34:25,141
I'm sorry.

442
00:34:27,268 --> 00:34:29,103
I don't want you to go.

443
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:49,916
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

444
00:34:50,124 --> 00:34:52,877
<i>Yo, it's Skinny Pete.
Just checking in with you, man.</i>

445
00:34:53,086 --> 00:34:54,921
<i>We missed you at the funeral today.</i>

446
00:34:55,129 --> 00:34:56,589
<i>The whole crew was representing.</i>

447
00:34:56,798 --> 00:34:58,758
<i>Even Badger came
all the way from Fresno.</i>

448
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:01,052
<i>Combo's people, his ma,
grandma, cousins...</i>

449
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,221
<i>...everyone was all choked up
and shit.</i>

450
00:35:03,429 --> 00:35:06,099
<i>Man, it was, like, emotional.</i>

451
00:35:06,307 --> 00:35:08,267
<i>And you should have
seen the coffin.</i>

452
00:35:08,476 --> 00:35:10,353
<i>It was this shiny white pearlescent.</i>

453
00:35:10,561 --> 00:35:13,648
<i>I'm sure I've seen
the exact same paint job on a Lexus.</i>

454
00:35:13,856 --> 00:35:16,818
<i>So we're definitely talking high-end.</i>

455
00:35:17,026 --> 00:35:20,238
<i>Anyway, guess you had something
bigger going down.</i>

456
00:35:20,446 --> 00:35:23,533
<i>Watch your back out there, bro.
Peace.</i>

457
00:36:06,034 --> 00:36:07,994
I like to mix some ice with it.

458
00:36:56,542 --> 00:36:58,211
Hold that.

459
00:37:00,588 --> 00:37:02,048
What's it feel like?

460
00:37:05,718 --> 00:37:07,512
There's a chill.

461
00:37:08,721 --> 00:37:10,973
Don't freak out. It passes.

462
00:37:11,432 --> 00:37:12,725
And then....

463
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:14,060
You'll see.

464
00:37:18,815 --> 00:37:20,483
I'll meet you there.

465
00:37:32,245 --> 00:37:33,871
Take that off.

466
00:40:03,396 --> 00:40:05,857
Phones off, please.

467
00:40:23,958 --> 00:40:26,002
Pipes, I guess.

468
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:29,005
All right, everyone.
Eyes on your paper.

469
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:31,674
Eyes on your paper.

470
00:40:46,773 --> 00:40:48,107
Yes.

471
00:41:02,497 --> 00:41:03,998
Excuse me, where's the manager?

472
00:41:04,207 --> 00:41:06,501
I'm the manager. Can I help you?

473
00:41:06,709 --> 00:41:10,129
No, no, no.
I met a man here last week.

474
00:41:10,338 --> 00:41:13,216
He's a black gentleman.
He's thin. Glasses.

475
00:41:13,424 --> 00:41:14,967
Yes, sir. That's the owner.

476
00:41:15,176 --> 00:41:17,011
Oh, owner. Okay.

477
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,972
He owns 14 Los Pollos restaurants
in between here and Nevada.

478
00:41:20,181 --> 00:41:22,475
He could be at any one of them.

479
00:41:23,643 --> 00:41:27,230
Is there a phone number
that I can get to...?

480
00:41:27,438 --> 00:41:30,149
I'm sorry, sir. I can't give that out.

481
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:33,444
Is this about a complaint? I'd be happy
to refer you to our website.

482
00:41:33,653 --> 00:41:35,488
No, no.

483
00:41:35,697 --> 00:41:37,657
-What's his name?
-Gustavo.

484
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:39,367
Gus.

485
00:41:39,575 --> 00:41:40,576
Thank you.

486
00:41:44,872 --> 00:41:47,291
Thirty-eight pounds, $1.2 million.

487
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,962
Truck stop,
two miles south of Exit 13 on the 25.

488
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,505
-One hour.
-What?

489
00:41:52,714 --> 00:41:54,090
One hour. You in or out?

490
00:41:54,716 --> 00:41:57,885
In. In. Absolutely.
But I just need a little more time.

491
00:41:58,094 --> 00:42:00,096
One hour. If you miss it...

492
00:42:00,304 --> 00:42:03,015
...don't ever show your face
in here again.

493
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,858
Exit 13 off the 25 South,
to a truck....

494
00:42:12,066 --> 00:42:15,194
<i>-Come on! Come on!
-Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

495
00:42:15,403 --> 00:42:18,197
Jesse. Jesse, pick up the phone.

496
00:42:18,406 --> 00:42:20,241
Pick up the phone.

497
00:42:20,908 --> 00:42:23,786
I'm coming by. I need the product.

498
00:42:23,995 --> 00:42:25,788
I need the product now.

499
00:43:13,211 --> 00:43:15,671
Oh, God.

500
00:43:27,225 --> 00:43:28,601
Jesse.

501
00:43:32,021 --> 00:43:33,648
Jesse!

502
00:43:34,273 --> 00:43:35,900
Jesse.

503
00:43:36,734 --> 00:43:38,444
Jesse.

504
00:43:58,339 --> 00:44:01,050
Jesse. Jesse.

505
00:44:02,218 --> 00:44:04,011
Jesse.

506
00:44:25,825 --> 00:44:27,994
Jesse.

507
00:44:28,202 --> 00:44:29,787
Jesse. Jesse, wake up.

508
00:44:29,996 --> 00:44:31,664
Jesse.

509
00:44:32,415 --> 00:44:35,001
Jesse. Jesse, wake up. Wake up.

510
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:36,335
Wake up!

511
00:44:36,544 --> 00:44:38,129
Come on, damn it.

512
00:44:38,337 --> 00:44:39,630
Wake up.

513
00:44:41,007 --> 00:44:42,008
Where'd you put it?

514
00:44:42,216 --> 00:44:43,968
-Where's the product?
-Get off of me.

515
00:44:44,177 --> 00:44:47,055
Where is it?
Where'd you hide the meth?

516
00:44:47,263 --> 00:44:49,015
-In the kitchen.
-Where?

517
00:44:49,849 --> 00:44:51,851
Under the sink.

518
00:45:54,288 --> 00:45:59,252
No. No, no, no.
Not now, not now. Not now!
