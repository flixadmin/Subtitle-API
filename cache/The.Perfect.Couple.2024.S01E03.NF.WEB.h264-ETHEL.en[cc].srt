00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:19,916
I had an Agatha Christie obsession,
didn't I?

319
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,833
Yes.

320
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:25,500
I mean, I had inspiration,
I think, with some wealthy aunts.

321
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,458
-Oh. Quite a few wealthy aunts.
-And...

322
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,166
-Greer, you mentioned aunts?
-[Greer] Yes.

323
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,500
You don't normally talk about your family.

324
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,458
[mouths] No.

325
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,166
That's because I went to boarding school
when I was five.

326
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,083
As you do.

327
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,875
Um, but I do remember...

328
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:43,291
I remember when Dash Hardaway came to me.

329
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,416
And it was in the form of this

330
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,000
gorgeous man.

331
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,500
[laughs]

332
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:53,291
Oh, crap.

333
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,166
-Wasn't supposed to start until 4:00.
-Did you feel that?

334
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,708
-[woman] Oh, no.
-Right.

Just wait until
you smell the grass afterwards.

337
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,250
-Better run.
-Only a few questions.

338
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:10,291
Now, we're going to have to do the photos
indoors in our own house,

339
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:13,166
and the whole reason to do it outside here

340
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,250
was because of the fucking hydrangeas.

341
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:19,333
And what was that all about, Tag?
Honestly.

342
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:23,166
-What was what all about?
-You know exactly what I'm talking about,

343
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,208
all that over-the-top romantic drivel.

344

[Greer scoffs]

seems to be ever-expanding, doesn't it?

349
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,000
I could say the same about you.

350
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,208
A thoroughbred? [chuckles dryly]

351
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:53,333
I'd like to know
what possessed your pot-filled brain

352
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:56,083
to think you could liken me
to a fucking horse.

353
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,333
-Just doing my part, darling.
-[scoffs]

Seems like you've been doing your part
just a little too much.

Huh?

359
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,875
<i>People Magazine</i> is here,

360
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:17,916
and suddenly you've found
some fake fucking morality?

361
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,708
Suddenly we're the perfect family?

362
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,500
Is that... Is that it, Greer?
Is that what you want?

363
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:25,666
-Come on. Just get dressed.
-Do you even know what you want?

364
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:27,791
Because I do.

It's you.

That's all I've ever wanted.

That's my fucking sickness.

I've done everything I can to cure it,
but I can't!

Get on a fucking plane and go
somewhere beautiful? Just you and me.

373

You know the interesting thing
about guilt, Tag? It's not transferable.

You're not dressed.

00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:34,875
Come on.
Are you going to be in the family photo?

00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,750
-If you want me to.
-If I want...

Uh... Come on, do you want?

No, I don't think so.

386
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,541
I think it would mean a lot to Benji

387
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:48,375
to know that you gave a shit
about participating in his family.

-I give a shit.
-Really? Do you?

-You don't act like you do.
-I'm sorry you feel that way.

You don't act like you're in love.

Benji deserves to be loved, Amelia.

392

He does. I agree with you.

393

I just have a different idea
of what love looks like.

Now please go and put on
something presentable, would you?

00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,375
She never picked up.

Um...

They're doing a blood test,

but depending on how far along she was,
it might not even be detectable yet.

Oh, and we heard
from Shooter Dival's lawyer.

we don't have enough to keep him.

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,083
[Greer laughs]

473
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:26,291
[woman] Your own cover.

474
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:27,666
-You're...
-I know.

475
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,500
-...going to get married.
-[woman] We are.

476
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:30,916
-Hi.
-[woman] Hi.

477
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,125
[Karen] It's nice,
but we don't need to be in there.

478
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,458
[Benji] Let's do the photo.

479
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:36,458
-Don't need to be in the pictures.
-Just get in.

480
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:37,958
-No, we want you.
-[Tag] It's okay.

481
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,166
Sit down, please.

482
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,458
-That sounds good. The couple.
-Yeah, right?

483
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:43,708
-This is Karen.
-[woman] Hi, Karen.

484
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:46,250
Sit down.
We'd love to have you both in the photo.

485
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:48,333
This is amazing!

486
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,875
-You okay?
-Mmm-hmm.

487
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:52,166
-We are the perfect family.
-[Tag] Will...

488
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,291
-[Greer chuckles]
-Everyone. One, two, three.

489
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,291
[camera shutter clicking]

490
00:29:58,375 --> 00:30:00,916
You all look amazing.
You must be so proud.

491
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,500
Let's get a couple more.

492
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:04,500
Where's Shooter?

493
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:07,666
-Uh, I haven't seen him all day.
-It'd be nice to have him in the photo.

494
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,125
I hear he's finally been adopted
by someone else.

495
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,666
We can take this picture
without Shooter, darling.

496
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:16,791
Shooter and Greer?
Yeah. They're weirdly close.

497
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:19,958
And Mrs. Greer
has a special spot for Shooter.

498
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:23,583
She always says, "He's like a son to me."

499
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:30,791
I wouldn't behave this way with my son.

500
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:33,041
Whatever. Can't all have a dead mom.

501
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:40,125
All right, Mr. Dival, you're free to go,
but you cannot leave the island.

502
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:43,541
All right? None of you
can leave the island. Understood?

503
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:44,458
Yeah.

504
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:47,625
You got a good lawyer, but we still
believe you're hiding something,

505
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:49,666
so we're gonna keep a close eye on you.

506
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,666
Come on. Let's go.

507
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,041
-[Henry] This way.
-Thank you.

508
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,791
[door creaks open]

509
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:57,791
[birds squawking]

510
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:07,375
[Dan] Mmm!

511
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:08,625
[lively music playing]

512
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:09,708
Hell, yeah.

513
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:14,208
-You've done it again.
-[knocking at door]

514
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:16,541
-[Henry] Hello?
-Uh, yeah, back here.

515
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:21,666
Hi. Your hedges need a haircut.

516
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,875
[chuckles] Yeah. Well, I'll be sure
to inform my gardener.

517
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:26,041
Ah! [chuckles]

518
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:27,458
Oh! Something smells good!

519
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:32,416
Stop & Shop marinara. I add real garlic.

520
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,500
Well, that's impressive.

521
00:31:34,583 --> 00:31:37,916
I just lie and tell my kids
the frozen garlic bread's homemade.

522
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,208
[chuckles] Well, listen, anything, uh,
you have to preheat the oven for

523
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:44,708
counts as home cooking.

524
00:31:44,791 --> 00:31:46,041
Oh!

525
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:49,791
No. No, thank you. I am still feeling
the plastic cup of Yellow Tail

526
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:52,833
I just had with Isabel Nallet
at the Sand Dollar.

527
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:55,041
-Oh, and was it worth it?
-[sighs wearily]

528
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:58,500
Jeez. You know I can only understand
half of what that woman says.

529
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,666
[Dan chuckles]

530
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:04,541
But apparently
the Winbury money is all tied up in trust.

531
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:07,375
So that's why Greer churns out
a book or two a year.

532
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,875
She's paying for everything:

533
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:11,708
schools, cars,
the penthouse on Park, all of it.

534
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:12,625
Can't touch it.

535
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:15,583
Tag gets some money to invest,
but he's never worked a day in his life.

536
00:32:15,666 --> 00:32:17,875
Yeah, well, no wonder Tag is such a...

537
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:20,666
Prick.

538
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,125
No, no, I wasn't gonna say that.
I was gonna say "great guy."

539
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:27,375
[chuckles] I mean,
the boys get their money down the line,

540
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:30,500
but Greer doesn't want them
to turn out like Tag.

541
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:32,958
I mean, it's too late for Thomas, clearly.

542
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:36,791
But she said Benji had some issues
when he was a teenager.

543
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:39,833
Got into fights,
got kicked out, had to switch schools.

544
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:40,916
Yeah.

545
00:32:41,875 --> 00:32:43,666
-He's hard to read.
-Yeah.

546
00:32:44,708 --> 00:32:45,625
[sighs]

547
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:46,708
And Will...

548
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:52,250
I mean, he's very anxious,
nervous kid, tightly wound,

549
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:55,041
and he doesn't get along with Tag at all.

550
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,708
[door closes]

551
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:59,708
Chloe, come here. Come here.

552
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:01,500
I want you to meet my daughter.

553
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,000
This is Detective Henry.

554
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,333
Hey.

555
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:09,041
"Hey"?

556
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:13,083
I like her. She seems nice.

557
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:20,916
-Quality door slam. I like her. Yep.
-Yeah.

558
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,833
-Never get used to that sound.
-No?

559
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:24,541
No, but it happens all the time.

560
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:26,833
[sarcastically] Does it?
Never at my house.

561
00:33:26,916 --> 00:33:27,833
[Dan chuckles]

562
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:35,291
[Tag] What is that?

563
00:33:35,375 --> 00:33:37,625
-[Bruce] Great.
-[Thomas] Going to start with Burgundy?

564
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:40,416
[Tag] I don't know.
Does it taste like moldy castle?

565
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:42,708
[Greer] Bread. If you want it.

566
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:45,208
Oh, Shooter? Is that you... Ah...

567
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,208
-You made it.
-Yeah.

568
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,583
The prodigal son returns.

569
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,041
Please.

570
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:52,458
Where have you been, dude?

571
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:54,208
Police station.

572
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:56,750
Uh, it's okay. They just wanted to talk.

573
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:57,833
[Greer] It'll be fine.

574
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
[Tag sighs]

575
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,833
[Greer] Let me get the rest of the food.

576
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:06,708
-[Shooter] Greer?
-It's, um...

577
00:34:06,791 --> 00:34:09,000
-What happened?
-I didn't say anything about the money.

578
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,375
-I swear.
-[sighs] Good.

579
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:12,958
Should I be worried?

580
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:17,833
No. Gosia, that looks so delicious!

581
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:20,875
All right,
I think we all need some comfort food.

582
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,583
I prefer comfort drink.

583
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:23,791
[Greer laughing]

584
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:24,833
Of course.

585
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:26,958
[laughter]

586
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:30,291
Gosia, you are a magician.

587
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:34,333
This is extraordinary. I don't know
what we would do without you. Bravo.

588
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:35,416
[Bruce] Hear, hear!

589
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,666
Yes. Thank you, Gosia.

590
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:41,166
Are you okay?

591
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,208
[Greer] Bon appétit!

592
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,458
[Tag] Mmm. <i>Oui!</i>

593
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:52,083
So, Isabel, how are you,
uh, liking the hotel?

594
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:55,541
-Oh, it's hideous. It's hideous.
-Oh!

595
00:34:55,625 --> 00:35:00,166
They serve wine in little plastic bottles.

596
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,708
[Tag] Ooh.

597
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:03,375
That's better than none at all.

598
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,250
[in French] Yes, of course.

599
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,625
[in English] All the magazines are
about Nantucket. I am on Nantucket.

600
00:35:10,166 --> 00:35:12,666
I should have bought a book
at the airport,

601
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:19,250
but I did not anticipate
so much <i>comment dit-on...</i>

602
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:20,750
-Downtime.
-Yeah. Downtime.

603
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:22,791
[Tag] You were expecting more activity?

604
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,666
When Tom and I went to Parrot Cay
last month, I bought <i>Death in Greenwich,</i>

605
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,833
and I read it for the third time.
It never gets old.

606
00:35:29,916 --> 00:35:31,875
-[Tag mumbles and laughs]
-Tom.

607
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:33,958
[Greer] My books at the airport.
It's torture.

608
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:35,458
[Abby] I know. Awful.

609
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:38,833
Mmm-hmm.
But it does make up 30% of my sales.

610
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:40,833
Exactly. You have to play the game.

611
00:35:41,583 --> 00:35:45,541
Even though I do feel like
I'm churning them out like Doritos.

612
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:47,708
-People love Doritos.
-[Bruce] They do.

613
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,833
-I love Doritos.
-She does.

614
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,875
No, I mean, I did,
when I could still taste them.

615
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:57,833
You're right, Karen.
I love Doritos, too, once in a while.

616
00:35:57,916 --> 00:35:58,833
She does.

617
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:02,583
Karen and I ate Fritos and Franzia
every night of our honeymoon

618
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:06,000
from this great little place
on the sand. It was terrific.

619
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,000
Heaven.

620
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:09,291
-[Greer] Lovely!
-[Tag] Sounds like it.

621
00:36:10,625 --> 00:36:12,583
Why do you ask people to sign NDAs?

622
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:15,333
[awkward laughter]

623
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:16,583
Pardon?

624
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,666
Why do you ask people
to sign legal documents

625
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,791
promising they won't talk about
what goes on here?

626
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:25,000
-[Benji] We talked about this.

Now, that is a good question.

631
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,000
Benji, what is she talking about?

632
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:36,333
-Mae Pratt?
-I don't know.

Honey.

00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:41,291
Amelia.

Well, if her disappearance
had nothing to do with anyone,

637
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:48,333

-Yeah, that's so weird. Why...
-Why can't anyone talk about it?

Stop.

640
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,083
Benji, would you please ask your fiancée
to stop talking?

-Who are you protecting?
-Who am I protecting?

642

[Tag] Okay, I think, um,
worn this subject out, frankly.

-Tom!

Thomas, why would you say
something like that?!

652
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:29,166
Because it's the truth.

653
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,791
[Tag] Because your son
is an insecure little prick, that's why.

Would you mind not smoking

I'm sorry, darling.

-[Abby] Oh, my God.

And when Dad broke it off with her...

663
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:53,500
-You've had too much to drink.

-Remember?

So Mom and Dad
threw their huge dicks on the table...

Tom.

I mean, I think I prefer Italian whites,
but... [scoffs] Whatever.

A Chablis is a Chardonnay,

but a Chardonnay
is not necessarily a Chablis, right?

Of course. You're pregnant.
