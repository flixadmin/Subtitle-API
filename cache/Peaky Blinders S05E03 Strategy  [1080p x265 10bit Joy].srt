1
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,560
Good morning, sisters.

2
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,040
Let us pray.

3
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,680
Our Father, who art in heaven...

4
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,320
...but deliver us from evil.

5
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,120
For thine is
the kingdom, the power...

6
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,760
...forever and ever. Amen.

7
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,840
You wanted
to speak to us, Mr Shelby?

8
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,200
Yep.

9
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,120
-All of us?
-Yep.

10
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,880
At 6:30 in the morning?

11
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,800
Yes.

12
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,920
We don't smoke in here.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,120
Well, I fucking do.

14
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,960
Nor do we use language.

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,880
Nor do we find fault in the innocent.

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,800
Yet, you do.

17
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,200
You fucking do.

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,000
May I ask what this meeting is about?

19
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,440
The Grace Shelby Foundation
is the biggest single source of funding

20
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,760
for this charitable institution

21
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,960
devoted to the care of the orphaned girls
of South Birmingham, yeah?

22
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,400
For which we give thanks.

23
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,840
Uh-huh.

24
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,240
I have a temper similar to the one
described in that report.

25
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,240
Yet, unlike you,
I wait until I'm matched in size.

26
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,320
Whose report?

27
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,920
The testimony of children.

28
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,440
Who have they spoken to?

29
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,400
You'd have them only speak to God.

30
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,760
God be their witness.

31
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,520
There is God,
and there are the Peaky Blinders.

32
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,960
This is Sparkhill, we're in Small Heath.

33
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,840
We're much, much closer at hand than God.

34
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,640
And we have heard terrible things.

35
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,160
We have, in this place,
children of the worst sort.

36
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,960
They lie as easily as breathe.

37
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,400
You had a child half black.

38
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,360
You made her wash with a different soap.

39
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,800
Mr Shelby, your own sins are legend.

40
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,200
Our sins.

41
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,240
Our sins against the beating of children

42
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,440
with bricks and hoses.

43
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,720
Our sins...

44
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,640
Our sins...

45
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,560
against the black child who hanged herself
for fear of your temper.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,640
- I do not see how--
-You do not see...

47
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,320
Now put 'em on.

48
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,960
Put 'em on your face

49
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,560
or it'll be your eyes that are broken.

50
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,840
And please don't imagine
that I won't use this minute to do it

51
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,280
or that I am afraid of your prayers
or your crosses.

52
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,600
You see the world broken.

53
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,720
Like those beaten children will.

54
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,600
Now look at me.

55
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,640
Look at me.

56
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,520
Look at me!

57
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,720
Funding withdrawn.

58
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,320
All children to be
taken into our own institutions.

59
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,480
You have no say in where the children--

60
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,000
If I come for you,

61
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,920
and I still might yet decide
to come for you,

62
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,040
I will wear high heels

63
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,560
so you can hear my approach
on the cobblestones

64
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,440
and have time to repent.

65
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,360
You listen for my footsteps.

66
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,480
Happy birthday, Pol.

67
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,000
You grow grand in the horse shit, Pol.

68
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,400
Curly, pour some beer, eh?

69
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,560
The train to London leaves in an hour.

70
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,000
Arthur, Michael, you're coming with me.

71
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,720
Tommy, I have to take Gina
to the hospital today.

72
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,840
A week ago, one of our most trusted men
was killed by Jimmy McCavern.

73
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,560
The man we're going to speak to in London

74
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,600
is establishing a relationship
with Jimmy McCavern.

75
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,480
So, cancel your appointments,

76
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,480
and Ada can take Gina to the hospital.

77
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,080
'Cause that's what women do.

78
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,960
Clean that shit off your shoes
before you get in me car, eh?

79
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,400
Michael, they will give it and give it
until your case is proven,

80
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,440
and then they'll take it.

81
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,400
From you, but mainly from me.

82
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,720
Polly, you go to the hospital
and speak to Aberama Gold.

83
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,880
You tell him there is a strategy in place
to avenge the death of his son,

84
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,440
so not to do anything rash.
And take with you

85
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,000
the heartfelt condolences
of the whole family.

86
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,200
Why me?

87
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,640
Because Aberama Gold is in love with you.
He even got an haircut.

88
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,000
And the smell of your perfume
might help ease his pain.

89
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,600
Tommy, I'm 45 years old today.

90
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,280
Forty-five years old
and still breaking hearts, eh?

91
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,840
- Yeah.
-To Polly.

92
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,360
-Polly Gray. Hmm?
-Right.

93
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,400
Polly.

94
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,880
Happy birthday, Pol, yeah.

95
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,960
Curly, organise a wagon
to take Bonnie Gold's soul to heaven.

96
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,920
Isiah, fetch his boxing gloves
from the gym to burn with his body.

97
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,200
Michael, turn the Bentley around.
We have a train to catch.

98
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,240
And don't forget to wipe
that shit off your shoes, eh?

99
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,520
Just start up the car and drive.

100
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,120
<i>♪ There ain't no grave ♪ </i>

101
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,480
<i>♪ Can hold my body down ♪</i>

102
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,880
<i>♪ There ain't no grave ♪</i>

103
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,160
<i>♪ Can hold my body down ♪</i>

104
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,640
So, what's the strategy?

105
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,200
You can smile. And you, don't smile.

106
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,360
<i>♪ There ain't no grave ♪</i>

107
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,920
<i>♪ Can hold my body down ♪</i>

108
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Nice.

109
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,320
Very nice, Tom.

110
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,240
Hmm.

111
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,920
Although, I must say, I thought
your office would be bigger than this.

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,920
It will be.

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,280
Michael, you sit.
Arthur, you stand by the window.

114
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,360
So, who we meetin'?

115
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,080
The man we're about to meet

116
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,360
is the minister
for the Duchy of Lancaster.

117
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,400
He is also deputy
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer

118
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,160
and Cabinet adviser
to the Prime Minister of Great Britain.

119
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,000
You've both met bad men before.

120
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,080
The man we're about to meet is the devil.

121
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,559
Yep. Send him in.

122
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,600
I never seem to get to meet you
without your family.

123
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,240
I understand you know a man
called Jimmy McCavern.

124
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,640
May I take a cigarette?

125
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,200
Please.

126
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,720
Who on earth is Jimmy McCavern?

127
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,880
Over the last 12 months,

128
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,840
you've been making approaches
to various men across the country

129
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,080
who you think might be able to
help you in your cause.

130
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,200
McCavern is one of these men.

131
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,040
He runs the East Glasgow shipyards.

132
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,720
He killed an associate of mine.

133
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,640
I want to know what your strategy is.

134
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,480
That one's your brother, yes?

135
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Yes.

136
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,440
And I'm his business adviser.

137
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,080
We would like to talk business.

138
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,920
Michael.

139
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,680
Michael Gray.

140
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,640
You lost all your cousin's money
in America playing the fool.

141
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,080
A night club in Detroit
called the Gladiator is your regular.

142
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,560
You lost the money...

143
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,200
and found a wife there.

144
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,320
And poor old Arthur Shelby,
standing there at the window,

145
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,280
-is afraid his wife will never return.

146
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,920
My spies tell me she's been seen
with another man.

147
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,880
Arthur... Arthur.

148
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,280
His time will come.

149
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,360
And... bingo.

150
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,440
Twenty seconds in, and I have them
speaking their wog lingo.

151
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,120
Mr Shelby, I do have plans.

152
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,440
I will have need of men like you.

153
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,640
Except, of course,
there is no other man like you.

154
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,040
You, in particular, I need.

155
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,320
But please.

156
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,640
Don't imagine I would
trouble myself with turf wars.

157
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,840
You have many enemies.

158
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,960
Shuffle the pack and pick another card.

159
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,240
That investigation
of the dead journalist, the queer...

160
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,400
I've made that go away.

161
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,200
Read it and, er, come back to me.

162
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,520
Next time, bring only an open mind
and a cigar to celebrate our union.

163
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,360
What the fuck was that all about, Tom?

164
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,000
Fuck.

165
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,720
Fuck.

166
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,760
- Arthur!

167
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,400
Do not let them get inside your head.

168
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,760
That's exactly how these people work.

169
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,840
Who the fuck are these people?

170
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,760
Hmm?

171
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,120
Who the fuck are they?

172
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,000
I've just been invited...

173
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,800
...to become the deputy leader

174
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,600
of a brand-new political party.

175
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,520
These people say they are the future.

176
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,840
Do you want a drink?

177
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,160
I've stopped.

178
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,480
So, what have you decided?

179
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,680
I've been talking to the Friends.

180
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,000
What friends?

181
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,320
Quakers. Friends who meet
at the Meeting House in Bournville.

182
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,440
I'm staying in Bournville.

183
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,800
And what do they say?

184
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,560
They say I have been led astray.

185
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,880
If you've come to talk about redemption,
you're talking to the wrong person.

186
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,680
I also went to a solicitor.

187
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,040
They heard my name was Shelby,
and suddenly, they were too busy.

188
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,160
To divorce a Shelby man,
you have to go to a solicitor in London.

189
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,520
I found one.

190
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,360
He said he'd represent me.

191
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,000
But I put the phone down.

192
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,120
Not through fear.

193
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,880
I chose this life, it didn't choose me.

194
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,760
Also, Lizzie, one of the Friends is a man.

195
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,120
He listens to me when I talk.

196
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,360
His wife died of the Spanish flu.

197
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,480
He has a daughter.

198
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,640
And you're considering
making this daughter an orphan.

199
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,840
Nothing has happened.

200
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,040
Nor will it.

201
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,240
He would die without his eyes.

202
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,840
And out of kindness,
Tommy would offer his daughter

203
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,720
a place in one of his institutions
for orphaned girls.

204
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,080
Or even take her into the family.

205
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,840
And it would begin again.

206
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,520
What is the thing, Linda?

207
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,360
The thing you can't put aside?

208
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,440
It's not Arthur.

209
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
It's who I am when he's there.

210
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,600
God hears every filthy word in my head,
knows every dirty thing.

211
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,480
And your Friends don't use filthy words?

212
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,040
If I fall this time,
I'll fall all the way.

213
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,160
Perhaps it's what you deserve
with your filthy words.

214
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,600
I used to fuck seven men a day,

215
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,720
and now I'm learning
how to ride a horse side-saddle.

216
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,280
There's good and there's evil.

217
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,760
There's both mixed.

218
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,800
And that's Arthur and you and me.

219
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,120
You don't get what you deserve,
you get what you take.

220
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,440
What about him?

221
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,640
He's making up his mind.

222
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,520
Someone called Polly Gray to see you.

223
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,000
Yes or no?

224
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Yes.

225
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,000
I've come to take you to the clinic.

226
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,400
I already told Michael.
My husband or no one.

227
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,560
I've got a car.

228
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,119
They have taxis.
Even in this fucking city.

229
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,359
Look, if they don't hear a heartbeat,

230
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,160
they're gonna give you options.
None of them are nice.

231
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,560
I had my check-up three days ago.

232
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,160
They heard a beating heart.

233
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,560
But if they had told me
that baby had died inside of me,

234
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,280
I would have wanted someone with me.

235
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,840
My husband may do as he's told, but, er...

236
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
I don't.

237
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,720
Look, if they hear a heartbeat,
you won't need anybody with you,

238
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,040
'cause you'll have the baby with you.
So I will leave you alone.

239
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,680
But if you get in a taxi in this city
and they hear your accent,

240
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,120
they'll take you on a grand tour.

241
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,000
Come on.

242
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,920
So, when will Mum be home?

243
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,200
She said
she had to go to Birmingham.

244
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,360
Do you want me to cook you something?

245
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,480
Cook?

246
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
You're a man.

247
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,680
This is really not fair.

248
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,720
Your mother never told me
you were this good.

249
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,520
I'm in a club. I'm champion.

250
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,120
I've beat people even older than you.

251
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,720
Even older than me?

252
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,680
At school, some of the children say
that black people and Jews are worse.

253
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,600
Worse than what?

254
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,320
Than anything.

255
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,760
And one teacher, Mr Hudson,

256
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,880
he calls my friend "the little Jew boy."

257
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,120
Karl,

258
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,760
these days,
there are some very stupid people

259
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,800
saying some very stupid things.

260
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,320
Okay?

261
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,600
What do you think?

262
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,880
Checkmate.

263
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,880
I think I don't want you to be my dad...

264
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,160
'cause my dad's white and he's in heaven.

265
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,360
I came to see you in hospital
to tell you there is a strategy in place.

266
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,400
Not to break you out.

267
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,480
Don't worry.

268
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,240
My sister will look after me.

269
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,040
You must stay here,

270
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,520
and you'll let Tommy deal with the men
who killed your son.

271
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,720
You're 45 today?

272
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,520
I'm probably a bit older than that.

273
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,840
Probably.

274
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,000
I've dealt death.

275
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,600
Now death has dealt with me.

276
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,360
I have one more killing to do,

277
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,640
then I'll be done.

278
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,920
Happy birthday, Polly Gray.

279
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,080
Get a car and a driver.

280
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,320
Find out where the Fury family are camped.

281
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,640
I need their men to help me.

282
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,720
I need my hunting rifle, 50 bullets.

283
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,240
I'm going to Scotland...

284
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,640
tonight.

285
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,480
I was expecting Ada.

286
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,640
Yeah. Give you a key, did she?

287
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,080
I was meant to meet her today,
but she said she had to go to Birmingham.

288
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,120
Yes, Tommy sent her on a mission.
She's doing my job for me.

289
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,920
Where's Karl, eh? Where's the boy?

290
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,480
He went to buy an ice cream.

291
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,440
Ada said to tell you she'd be late.

292
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,560
You knew I'd be here?

293
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,320
Yeah. We knew you'd be here.

294
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,040
We have some business for you.

295
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,680
Any business I have with you, Mr Shelby,
is meant to be strictly confidential.

296
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,360
Er, Michael, you still have
shit on your shoes.

297
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,400
My associate here can evidently smell it.

298
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,720
I don't mean any offence.

299
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,840
Here, Michael. Go and find Karl
and buy him an ice cream, eh?

300
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,960
The man doesn't trust you.

301
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,680
Fuck you, Tom.

302
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,120
You know, Gina phoned.

303
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,920
Baby's heart's beating strong.

304
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,800
But I swear to God, Tom,

305
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,800
by the time that baby
draws his first breath,

306
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,560
-you and I will be done.

307
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,400
And you will be king.

308
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,880
Is that it, Michael?

309
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,280
You know, Tom,

310
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,600
there are doctors in London now

311
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,600
who can talk their way into your head.

312
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,120
Dig out all the shit.

313
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,560
Perhaps you should see one.

314
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,960
You're still not alone.

315
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,400
Me brother and I are the same person.

316
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,600
Here.

317
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,080
There's a letter from Mosley.

318
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,840
You should read it.

319
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,000
What investigation is he talking about?

320
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,840
Two weeks ago,
a journalist was killed in Maida Vale.

321
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,880
The night before,

322
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,320
he'd come to me about some story
he was going to write about me.

323
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,760
We had nothing to do with that killing.

324
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,000
Mosley wants you as his deputy?

325
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,320
His constituency is Smethwick.
It borders me own.

326
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,000
And he wants Birmingham as his stronghold.

327
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,480
He knows I have strong support
among working people.

328
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,840
We help him out with rallies,

329
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,440
and show up at some town hall meetings.

330
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,960
Right, and why are you
showing this letter to me?

331
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,200
A Minister of State...

332
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,920
who may have seditious intentions.

333
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
There's no proof of sedition
in this letter.

334
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,720
You work in intelligence, Younger.

335
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,240
You don't need proof.
Give it to your superiors.

336
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,680
Mr Shelby, I have a very specific brief.

337
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,560
My brief is specifically
to gather information

338
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,640
on the activities of communists.

339
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,640
Your immediate superior
in the intelligence unit

340
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
is a Colonel Patrick Wyatt, yeah?

341
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,200
I understand he regularly plays polo
with Oswald Mosley.

342
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,920
They share membership of various clubs
in London and Birmingham.

343
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,880
I have specific orders.

344
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,920
I am a soldier. I--

345
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,560
You think you can join this family?

346
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,400
I have no intention of joining a family.

347
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,640
Oh, thank fuck for that,
'cause, er, you'd hate our weddings.

348
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,240
I thought you said
this was about business.

349
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,840
Yes. Family business
and government business.

350
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,200
All in one envelope.

351
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,000
Younger...

352
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,760
listen to me. Forget about Ada.

353
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,600
Forget about weddings.

354
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,040
You know what Mosley represents.

355
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,080
You know his philosophy.

356
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,640
Now, I'm planning to reply to him
and tell him that I'm making up me mind.

357
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,960
But in the meantime,
you need to give me instruction.

358
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,680
I could fight him on me own if I have to,

359
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,000
or I could join his organisation

360
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,360
and undermine him on behalf of the King.

361
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,080
But you need to make a decision.

362
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,680
I suppose there are a few things
I can do on my own initiative.

363
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,560
On your fucking feet.

364
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,280
Hello, Tom.

365
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,320
I thought you were staying over in London.

366
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,400
Hello, Johnny.

367
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,960
How are you, eh?

368
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,080
How are your ribs?

369
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,120
Are you managing?

370
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,480
-Just about, Tom, yeah.
-Yeah? Good.

371
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,360
And who's that?

372
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,880
Is it Maisy or is it Clara?

373
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,800
Ah.

374
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,640
Sandra.

375
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,480
Well, may I say,

376
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,640
your breakfasts...

377
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,720
are a great improvement.

378
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,920
Mr Shelby,

379
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,520
I'm sorry.

380
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,560
Don't worry, Sandra.

381
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,480
The only way to get fired
from this household is through burnt toast

382
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,040
or talking to the police.

383
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,360
Go on, go to bed.

384
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,240
And, Sandra...

385
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,160
everything Johnny said is lies.

386
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,480
-Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.

387
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,600
While you was gone, I got a message, Tom.

388
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
A cousin of Aberama Gold.

389
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,080
Galloped from Meriden.

390
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,280
He said Aberama wants you to know

391
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,520
that he's gone to Scotland
to deal with his business himself,

392
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,160
and that you'd know what that meant.

393
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,520
Fuck!

394
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,240
The boy said Aberama arrived
from the hospital in Polly's Bentley.

395
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,000
She fucking helped him?

396
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,360
She fucking helped him.

397
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,040
But it can't be love, 'cause it's Polly.

398
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,880
'Cause it's fucking Polly.

399
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
All right, Johnny,
I have a job for you.

400
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,720
Tom, I'm in a lot of pain here.

401
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,720
I need you to go and find Aberama Gold.

402
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,400
He has kin on the Lothian border.
The Fury family.

403
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,960
For fuck's sake, Tom!

404
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,520
The Furys,
they don't even use words to fucking talk.

405
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,160
Just hand gestures and fucking howls.

406
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,280
You will go to them and you will find him.

407
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,640
-Tom, I am in fucking pain here.
-Yeah, you appear to be managing.

408
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,000
I said I was just managing.

409
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,840
Well, you can just manage
to sit in a car with Arthur

410
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,120
and follow the patrin
to find the Fury family.

411
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,480
Arthur will take care of everything
that requires bones and muscles.

412
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,920
I warned you, Tom.

413
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,400
The Golds will be the death of one of us.

414
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,080
And it looks like
it's going to be fucking me! Ow!

415
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,680
Well, go on.

416
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,560
Open it.

417
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,880
So...

418
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,480
you heard the baby's heartbeat today.

419
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,480
Beats so fast.

420
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,760
Would have been a birthday gift enough.

421
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,240
New life.

422
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,840
Liberty.

423
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,160
Freedom.

424
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,960
Feels like a weapon.

425
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,280
I only came because
Michael's driving back from London,

426
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,480
and he said he didn't want you
to be on your own.

427
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,360
So...

428
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,000
whose idea was the gift of freedom?

429
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,240
Mine.

430
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,120
You want to take Michael
and the baby to New York?

431
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,920
Yes.

432
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,680
The baby will have two grandmothers.
The other one lives--

433
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,280
The other one lives amongst human beings.

434
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,120
The other one is a human being.

435
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,960
-It's all right,

436
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,720
I'm not drunk.

437
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,640
I'm just free.

438
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,240
So, what do you want?

439
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,480
My approval?

440
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,880
Your help.

441
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,520
Michael wants you to come with us.

442
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,480
We can all live in Long Island,
right on the beach.

443
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,000
Isn't Long Island in Australia?

444
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,480
Or is it in California
amongst the Indians?

445
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,640
It's in New York,

446
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,000
Polly.

447
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,120
You see, we all try and get away.

448
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,120
But we never do.

449
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,320
I wish I felt that heartbeat today.

450
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,040
You're starting to sound
a little sorry for yourself.

451
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,080
I'm an American.

452
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,160
We don't just go round and round
and round. We go in a straight line.

453
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,800
And my baby...

454
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,520
will be born in New York.

455
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,680
I'm not happy about moving this meeting
to licensed premises.

456
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,760
You've saved your union the train fare,

457
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,280
and you hate London anyway.

458
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,600
We are looking for popular speakers
for our upcoming rally.

459
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,160
You're making quite a name for yourself
in the Commons.

460
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,920
Betty!

461
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,360
-What are you drinking?
-Water.

462
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,360
Bottle of champagne, Betty.

463
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,520
You'll drink it on your own.

464
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,800
That's the idea.

465
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,960
Shall we sit down, Miss Eden?

466
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,800
Revolution.

467
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,120
So, how is life as a socialist?

468
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,880
This glass...

469
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,880
The bubbles...

470
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,600
They rise to the top.

471
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,600
Each bubble has the same chance to rise.

472
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,640
That's a very peculiar form of socialism.

473
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,640
And this bottle...

474
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,520
Once the cork comes out,

475
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,800
you can't get it back in.

476
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,400
You need to finish what you started.

477
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,320
It's cleverness, that's all.

478
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,080
So, you're playing at this?

479
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,880
Yeah, people can be turned around.

480
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,400
-Even your people.
-My people?

481
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,320
Yeah.

482
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,400
For them, it's just the same.

483
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,000
Communism, fascism.

484
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,920
For most people,
it's an apple and an apple.

485
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,040
Fascism is the subject of the rally.

486
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,199
I want you to speak against it.

487
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,679
In answer to your question,

488
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,120
I cannot address your rally...

489
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,040
because it's not part of
the current strategy.

490
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,400
Are you okay, Thomas?

491
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,040
Do you want a man to carry you home?

492
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,000
I knew we should not have had this meeting
on licensed premises.

493
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,880
Happy or sad, Thomas?

494
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,920
I warn you...

495
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,040
I'll break your heart.

496
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,760
I didn't expect you home.

497
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,040
Frances said Linda was here today.

498
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,800
Frances has a very specific loyalty,
doesn't she?

499
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,080
Well,

500
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,200
people are loyal
to those who pay their wages.

501
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,680
Also, Maggie at the exchange
said you made some calls.

502
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,280
Then you'll know I called a solicitor.

503
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,400
Did Maggie listen in to the conversation?

504
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,160
He said he'd represent me.

505
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,960
But I put the phone down.

506
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,400
There and then, I made a decision.

507
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,400
And when I heard your car pull up,

508
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,960
I got changed.

509
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,480
You said in your head,
you still pay for it.

510
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,120
So I have decided to continue
to take the payment

511
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,760
and balance my heart against my head
as though it were a book of accounts.

512
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,440
Value my head a shilling more.

513
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,520
When was the last time
you had to worry about shillings?

514
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,480
Eh?

515
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,440
People are loyal to those
who pay their wages.

516
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,680
So I will be loyal to you.

517
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,680
But this is the deal.

518
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,960
You don't fuck anybody else in my house.

519
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,680
Nor within a day of holding our child
by the hand. A day on either side.

520
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,960
And you let me in sometimes.
Into your head.

521
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,440
To clear it out.

522
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,560
That what needs clearing out.

523
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,520
Agreed.

524
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,160
And this...

525
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,720
always.

526
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,200
The deal is,

527
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,360
you belong to me.

528
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,960
My property.

529
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,200
No one touches my property.

530
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,840
I touch myself, but it's still you anyway,

531
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,120
so that's why I put the phone down.

532
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,520
No, Tom.

533
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,760
We do it in the bed at least.

534
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,720
Everything is mine, Lizzie.

535
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,960
Everything.

536
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,800
Arthur?

537
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,240
<i>-Yeah?</i>
-Frances was right.

538
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,160
Linda was here today.

539
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,840
Fuck.

540
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,680
What did she say, huh?

541
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,920
I just want to talk to her, that's all.

542
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,960
<i>Arthur, listen. First I need you</i>
<i>to go to Scotland</i>

543
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,360
<i>and bring back Aberama Gold.</i>
<i>Then we'll go and we'll find Linda.</i>

544
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,920
<i>No, no, no.</i>

545
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,280
<i>I'll keep calling you, Tom.</i>

546
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,160
You know I will.

547
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,320
I'll call this number back.

548
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,360
Again, again, and again.

549
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,480
If you do not answer,

550
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,600
I'll jump in my fucking car

551
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,160
and I'll drive to your house.
You know I will.

552
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,760
I'll stay there all night if I have to.

553
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,800
<i>I won't go nowhere.</i>

554
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,960
<i>Not Scotland, until you tell me</i>
<i>what it is you know.</i>

555
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,200
All right, listen to me.

556
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,960
I don't have an address.

557
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,600
But she's with the Quakers in Bournville.

558
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,000
<i>Apparently, there is someone</i>
<i>who is a Friend.</i>

559
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,160
He had a wife who died...

560
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,480
from Spanish flu in 1918.
He has a daughter.

561
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,280
<i>That should be enough to find him. </i>

562
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,600
<i>And Arthur,</i>

563
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,400
just talk to him
and get a message to Linda.

564
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,520
Nothing happened, Arthur.

565
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,880
He's a Quaker who is a friend.
They're not like us, they talk.

566
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,240
Oh, I'll speak to him. Hmm.

567
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,280
Man to man.

568
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,960
<i>And then after that,</i>

569
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,440
<i>I'll go up north, hmm.</i>

570
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,760
Deal with our business. I promise ya.

571
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,520
<i>Arthur. Arthur, listen to me...</i>

572
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,000
Who were you talking to?

573
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,440
I have to ask you 'cause Maggie
at the exchange won't tell me.

574
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,600
Who was it?

575
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,720
Was it Arthur?

576
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,480
I need me brother in one piece.

577
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,160
Arthur makes his own decisions.

578
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,640
You marry a Shelby,

579
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,560
you stay fucking married.

580
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,200
- Fuck.

581
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,280
Well, look at this, hmm?

582
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,200
Can I help you?

583
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,240
Yeah, I think you can.

584
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,160
I'm looking for Linda Shelby.

585
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,280
Do you know her?

586
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:44,960
Eh?

587
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,320
I'm Arthur...

588
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,520
her husband.

589
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,640
If you're her husband,
she doesn't want to talk to you.

590
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,280
Well, look at you.

591
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,040
Ain't you smart?

592
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,960
Eh?

593
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,480
What, you got all the fucking answers,
have ya?

594
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,600
Well, let's try you with another one, huh?

595
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,800
Let's try you with another one.
How about...

596
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,680
How about we search
for the fucking truth within, hmm?

597
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,000
Let's have a look, all right?
Let's have a look.

598
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,840
Let's see what we've got inside here, eh?

599
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,960
-Inside, you fucking bastard!

600
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,960
Hey...

601
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,640
you wanna keep looking, eh?

602
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,600

00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,360
I will ask you again.

Eh? Eh?

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,840
I'll ask you again. Come here,
listen, listen. Get up.

613
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,720
Where is she?

614
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,640
Eh?

615
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,440
Where is she?

616
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,800
No.

617
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,720
Eh.

618
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,160
No. No, no, no!

I'm a fucking good man like you.

622
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,160
A God-fearing man.

623
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,720
And there's good in my heart.

624
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,040
There is good in my heart!

625
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,840
But my hands...

626
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,280
These hands belong to the devil.

627
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,200
The fucking devil!

628
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,840
Right. I...

629
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,160
Did she come back?

630
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,760
No.

631
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,480
Is she in Scotland?
Is that why you're going?

632
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,080
No, she's not
in fucking Scotland, Charlie.

633
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,400
Whiskey. We want whiskey.

634
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,760
Maps. Cigars.

635
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,560
Load the van. We want it all.

636
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,480
Who's "we"?

637
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,120
Me and Johnny Dogs.

638
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,040
Ah.

639
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,840
So it's you and Johnny Dogs
against Scotland.

640
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,120
You know, at the BSA,

641
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,600
our friends could get you
some of them new artillery cannons

642
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,840
that fire ten shells a second.

643
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,440
You can mount one
on the roof of your fucking car.

644
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,520
Petrol.

645
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,120
Need petrol.

646
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,360
It's so far up north,
they run out of the bloody stuff.

647
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,240
Yeah.

648
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,600
Still riding around on fucking chariots,
they are.

649
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,200
Curly, Arthur is going to Scotland,
so he needs hand grenades.

650
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,640
How many?

651
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,720
Fuck's sake, it's like it's normal.

652
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,880
Our friends at the BSA
still have lots left from the war,

653
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,000
but we can't give them away, yeah?

654
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,920
Get me some hand grenades, Curly, eh?

655
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,920
-Hmm?

656
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,480
You find them back there, eh?
Good boy, yeah?

657
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,000
Go get me some.

658
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,760
-Put them on my account.
-Yeah.

659
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,320
How many?

660
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,280
Three, Curly.

661
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,400
Three, three. Right, yeah.

662
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,120
Find a way of getting her back, Arthur.

663
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,360
Without her,
you're as good as dead already.

664
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,680
That's them. The Billy Boys.

665
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,600
Gentlemen,

666
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,480
you have just crossed the border
into the County of East Tollcross.

667
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,760
Now, according to
the unwritten constitution

668
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,520
of Tollcross County,

669
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,680
Gypsies, Catholics,

670
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,160
and other criminally-minded individuals

671
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,640
are not allowed to work the roads
of our Protestant district,

672
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,600
on account of the poor quality
of their labour.

673
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,000
So, my own boys
will be taking over from here.

674
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:12,200
We will be needing your tools,
your tar, your burner,

675
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,520
and your transportation.

676
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,760
You're Gypsies.
You can easily steal another.

677
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,080
I have the keys to the truck.

678
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,480
Now...

679
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:23,080
I want you boys to take a message
back to Jimmy McCavern.

680
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,960
"You killed my son.

681
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,000
-You hoisted him on a cross!"

682
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,800
In this gun...

683
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:34,880
there is a bullet.

684
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,800
And on it is carved the name McCavern.

685
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,920
And when the time comes
for his crucifixion,

686
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,960
it will be me who drives in the nails!

687
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,640
Mr Shelby!

688
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,080
At last you are alone.

689
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,560
I think we'll make quite the team.

690
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,440
The pheasants won't know what hit them.

691
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,440
You're a fine shot, Mr Shelby.

692
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,760
You were in the yeomanry, yes?

693
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,840
You were cavalry.

694
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,720
You won the Distinguished Service medal.

695
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,480
That will help.

696
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:05,960
With what?

697
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,440
Two months ago, I was in Rome.

698
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,040
I met Mr Mussolini.

699
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,200
You and I, and men like him...

700
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,640
...we will shape the future.

701
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,480
When will you resign
from the Labour party?

702
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,080
The day before I announce
the formation of my new party.

703
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:35,800
The British Union of Fascists will be born
on January the 1st of next year.

704
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,680
First day of a new decade.

705
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,600
The 1930s, Mr Shelby, will belong to us.

706
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,680
Did you bring that cigar?

707
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,320
Before we smoke,

708
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,640
I have some conditions.

709
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,800
It really isn't going to be
that kind of relationship.

710
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,200
Just smoke like the fine man
you will become.

711
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,880
Yes, Colonel Ben Younger.

712
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,880
I have an allocated confidential line.
Code 78.

713
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,120
It's me.

714
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,480
I've agreed to work with our friend.

715
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,360
He is going to announce on January 1st.

716
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,560
I need to know that my position

717
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,440
as informant against him
is officially sanctioned.

718
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,440
Today, gentlemen,

719
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:58,560
we are avenging an unprovoked attack
on members of our organisation

720
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,120
who were simply carrying out
a routine border patrol.

721
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,640
Our enemies are Gypsies,

722
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,920
members of a race
destined for natural eradication anyway,

723
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,480
due to what the scientists call selection.

724
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,760
And since these beggars are unchristened
and unregistered,

725
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:23,320
the local constabulary will as soon
drop them in a communal grave

726
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,640
as find a name for a gravestone.

727
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,840
So, proceed in any manner you choose

728
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,920
to find the fugitive we seek.

729
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,200
Morning, Mr Gold.

730
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,120
Yeah,

731
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,520
the Billy Boys are coming for you.

732
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,440
How the fuck'd you find me?

733
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,760
How the fuck did they find me?

734
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,920
I kinda let it slip.

735
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,040
Give you no choice.

736
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,240
What? Hmm? What?

737
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:03,760
No.

738
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,160
In the Bentley outside,
the engine running.

739
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,640
Fastest engine in the world apparently,
which is good.

740
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,160
We got two minutes to get out of here.

741
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,160
We are officers of
the East Lanarkshire Special Constabulary.

742
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,760
We are seeking a man
by the name of Aberama Gold.

743
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,440
Hand the gentleman over,

744
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:44,520
and no one else will be harmed.

745
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,560
Fuck! Take cover!

746
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,840
So, Tommy Shelby.

747
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,520
It's war you want...

748
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,880
it's war you shall have.

749
