1
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:23,786
My knee!

2
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,017
- Oh, my God, my knee.
- Sorry, son, I didn't see you. You all right?

3
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,526
Yeah, I don't know.
Listen, help me up, will you, mister?

4
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,358
- Thanks.
- Come on.

5
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,466
- Yeah, yeah, I think it's gonna be okay.
- You sure?

6
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,696
- Yeah, listen, thanks for your help.
- I'm sorry.

7
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,103
- Chump.
- Chump?

8
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,266
What did he mean by...?

9
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:47,506
Hey! Hey!

10
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:50,676
He took my wallet.

11
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,152
Yes?

12
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,321
This is your wake-up call, Sullivan.

13
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:09,332
Wake up and dig the bum trip
you're about to take.

14
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:12,528
Bum trip? Who is this?
Where are you calling from...

15
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:16,232
...l968? Who is this?
- Listen, man...

16
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,607
...kill the Lesko story
before the Lesko story kills you.

17
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,244
It's me.

18
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:29,047
Say the word, baby,
and he'll kiss the sky.

19
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:41,797
- Hi there.
- Hey! Hey!

20
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:46,331
Turn on, tune in, drop out.

21
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:59,382
And, Lesko, there was one problem.

22
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,817
You know the computer disk
with all of Sullivan's notes on it?

23
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,082
Some kid swiped it.

24
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,322
They don't know who killed him or why.

25
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:22,366
- But, Barry, I was hoping that maybe you...
- I'm already on the case, Tina.

26
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:26,369
I'll do whatever I can,
on or off duty.

27
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,767
The Arkham exposé, I remember that.

28
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,640
- He was some writer.
- The best.

29
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,247
But you know,
Phil always hated these awards.

30
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,316
He called them bowling trophies.

31
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:41,317
It never stopped him
from letting me put them up.

32
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,047
Joan, I'm so sorry.

33
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:49,385
This is a friend from the police department.
Barry Allen, Dr. Joan Sullivan.

34
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,497
Hi. Pleased to meet you.
I was a big fan of Phil's work.

35
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:56,362
You and me both.
Will you look at this dress.

36
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,471
It took me an hour
to get the dog hair off.

37
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,039
Joan's a vet, Barry.

38
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,733
Phil always said it'd be impossible
to have children...

39
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,506
...because they'd have to compete
with the animal kingdom.

40
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:12,143
Phil hated me in black.
He said I looked like someone died.

41
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,776
- Oh, Joan.
- What am I gonna do?

42
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,203
Hey, Earl. Earl. Come on.

43
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,364
Hey, don't we get enough of that?

44
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,613
You just keep wasting my time, Duvivier.
All you give is talk.

45
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,512
Hey. Hey. Will you relax, all right?

46
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:48,347
And, you, if you don't take
that foot off my bumper...

47
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,456
...l'm gonna chew it off at the ankle.

48
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,285
Thank you.

49
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,953
Look, we are setting the next major trend
in the drug market here.

50
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,593
I think we know these guys.

51
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:06,535
Come on, I'm gonna make you two so rich
it's gonna take you weeks to spend it.

52
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,675
Yeah, that's a swell sales pitch,
but we still ain't seen jack.

53
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:13,340
You ain't seen jack?
All right, well, meet Jack.

54
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,344
This is Blue Paradise.

55
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,575
The clouds of heaven are now
being sold right here on earth.

56
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:22,585
Even for a guy like you though,
the first one's always free.

57
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,490
- Beautiful.
- Good.

58
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:32,086
You're under arrest. Spread them, pal.

59
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,526
Pal?

60
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,135
Look, we could've been pals, all right.

61
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:42,502
But now, how about I spread you two
all over the sidewalk, huh? Excuse me.

62
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:49,979
Hey, ladies, not on the car, all right?

63
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,460
Don't look at me like that.

64
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,691
Tie, please.

65
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,939
What am I doing here?
A guy can't have car trouble anymore?

66
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,440
What is this?
What are you booking me on?

67
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:55,547
How about suspicion of a stolen
necktie, gerbil. Come on. Let's go.

68
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,376
Jerk.

69
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,645
Hey, Barry, I got a deli tray in the back.
You want a sandwich?

70
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,812
- Two.
- Sure.

71
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,857
- Okay, guys, what happened?
- We had a line on Blue Paradise...

72
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,824
...this new designer drug
just hitting the street.

73
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:13,295
The bust went bad.
But the dealer got collared anyway.

74
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,299
- We had a little help.
- From whom?

75
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,801
Don't tell Lieutenant Garfield.

76
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,962
The Flash saved our lives.

77
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,099
- What, you don't think he's for real?
- Absolutely not.

78
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,042
Hey, maybe you guys
have been undercover too long, huh?

79
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:31,911
- What happened to the Paradise?
- It went down the drain.

80
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:35,713
Now every alligator in the sewer's
grooving to the colors.

81
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:48,199
I don't get it. Sullivan's editor said he was
working on a piece about Blue Paradise.

82
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:51,336
- But there's nothing in his files.
- Maybe someone killed him...

83
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,665
...and cleaned out the evidence.
- I don't know.

84
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,308
Only fingerprints on the files
were his own.

85
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,536
- I should get back to the lab.
- I got a lunch date with Sabrina.

86
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,442
We're going to some new place
called Eggzadica.

87
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:06,449
- You ever eat a poached ostrich egg?
- I have not. Would not. Will not.

88
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:10,282
Hey, me neither, man. Strictly turtle-eggs
benedict for me, thank you.

89
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,788
- See you back at the ranch, man.
- Right.

90
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,397
Lose your keys?

91
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:34,137
Yeah. I mean, my dad did.
He's always locking them in the car.

92
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,804
- He's a doctor. And he needs his bag...
- Oh, yeah?

93
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:40,544
...because there's a sick baby
across the street in the building.

94
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,178
Sounds serious to me.
Maybe I could help you out.

95
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,190
Wrong car. Help!
Somebody call the cops!

96
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,351
Police!

97
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,762
- Can I tell you something?
- What's that, Murph?

98
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,871
- Bean dip is my world, man.
- Really?

99
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,305
- So is lard, cholesterol, salt and cancer.
- This has salt?

100
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,571
Book this little hoodlum
for attempted theft, auto.

101
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:11,649
- Nice collar, Bar. Anybody killed?
- A young delinquent.

102
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:15,776
- It's truly a shame.
- Let me go, huh? I'm a victim of society.

103
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,320
Keep your eye on this one...

104
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,323
...while I get an officer from juvenile hall.
- You got it.

105
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,984
If you can do that
and eat at the same time.

106
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:29,025
All right, young man. Can you say,
"I'm in big trouble"?

107
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:31,533
What are you doing?
Hey, this is a no-smoking area.

108
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:35,538
Hey, kid, at your size, you can't afford
to stunt your growth. Put that thing out.

109
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,810
Last kid that did that's
now called Stumpy.

110
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,951
His name is Terry Cohan, age 13.

111
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:49,451
Her ran away from a foster home
in St. Louis nine months ago.

112
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,489
He's got a history of running away,
surviving on petty theft.

113
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:55,354
A kid like that living
on the street for nine months?

114
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,520
- What's the procedure from here?
- Well, if he's drug-free...

115
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,030
...and if his foster parents want him...

116
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,636
...and if we can convince the St. Louis
authorities to pick up the tab...

117
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,431
...he'll be sent back.

118
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,803
The paperwork will take a week.
Till then...

119
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:13,275
...he'll be locked up.
- Like hell.

120
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,973
- Take those cuffs off.
- Yeah, sure. Sorry, I'll get right on it.

121
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:21,210
Carmen, come on. Listen,
I don't wanna put the kid in jail.

122
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:25,687
I just thought a good scare
might help set him straight, that's all.

123
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,648
Stay!

124
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,321
- What else can we do?
- Look, Barry.

125
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:34,091
You can drop the charges, but I'll still
have to take him to juvenile hall.

126
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,394
Unless Terry can stay
with a responsible guardian...

127
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,733
...until we can contact
his foster parents.

128
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,340
Say...

129
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:48,071
...you've got one of those nice, big
warehouse apartments, don't you?

130
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:51,239
- Yeah, it's big.
- And a dog that loves kids.

131
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,146
Yeah, Earl loves kids.

132
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:57,050
Carmen, wait a minute. Now, you don't
think that I'm the right guy for this.

133
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:01,819
Send me to jail, all right?
Just save me from another bleeding heart.

134
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,630
All right, Terry, come with me.
I'll take you down to the hall.

135
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,630
Hold it.

136
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,469
I guess we could...

137
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,071
...give it a try.

138
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:16,969
What do you say, Terry?

139
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,178
You got cable?

140
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:25,115
Here's my car over here.
But you know that.

141
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,275
Listen, Barry.

142
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,818
Thanks.

143
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,217
You're welcome.

144
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:37,227
- Hey, isn't that a bank robbery going on?
- A bank robbery?

145
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,728
There's no bank in that...

146
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:22,236
Cory? Hey. Hey, Cory.

147
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,875
Cory?

148
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,808
Cory, come on. Where are you?

149
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,207
Cory?

150
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:32,006
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Well, I'm...

151
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,210
I'm just trying to give you a break, kid.
All right?

152
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,817
So...

153
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,391
...this is some place you got here.

154
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,287
Cory. Hey. Hey. Take...

155
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,798
Taught her everything I know. My sister.

156
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,831
Lesko.

157
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,034
Never disturb me when I'm working.

158
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,942
- Never.
- Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

159
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,377
Well...

160
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,246
...is our greasy little pusher
out of jail yet?

161
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:43,786
Duvivier should be free tomorrow.
The pigs lost the evidence.

162
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:47,653
They'll never make anything stick.
Why do you even keep him around? He's...

163
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:52,696
Duvivier is like a one-celled organism
driven by a single thought:

164
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,727
Greed.

165
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,893
He'll put the Paradise on the street
almost as fast as I can make it.

166
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,961
But...

167
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,200
...how long will I be able to make it...

168
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:08,369
...with Sullivan's story drifting
about on that disk?

169
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,548
Pepper...

170
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:16,051
...twenty years of life underground...

171
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:19,384
...have made me a very cautious man.

172
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:22,652
- Lf the cops find out I'm still alive...
- I checked around.

173
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,763
That kid on the skateboard,
the one that took Sullivan's bag...

174
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,559
...he works Helltown
as a pickpocket and a shoplifter.

175
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:32,830
- Then why aren't you searching Helltown?
- Word's out he got pinched by the man.

176
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:37,237
Then in the morning, go down to the
police station and find out where he is.

177
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,741
How am I gonna do that?

178
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,372
One of the fabulous properties
of Blue Paradise...

179
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,584
...is the rush.

180
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,859
Pepper...

181
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,890
...do you love me?

182
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:10,136
- When you're nice to me, I do.
- I'll be very nice if you get Sullivan's disk.

183
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:14,276
And kill the kid.

184
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,014
Lesko!

185
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,218
Never disturb me when I'm laughing.

186
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,565
- Free surprise.
- Hey. Hey, hey, let me see that. All right?

187
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,135
- Hey, mine.
- Look, Cory, this isn't a toy, all right?

188
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,932
Dinner's ready.

189
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,098
- Our secret. All right?
- Okay.

190
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,713
- Sorry I'm late.
- No problem.

191
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,752
- I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, Tina.
- Hi.

192
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:59,049
- I'd rather eat with Earl.
- Cory!

193
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,385
So, Barry, this your new squeeze, huh?

194
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,155
No, this is not my new squeeze.
She's a good friend of mine, like I told you.

195
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,730
- Come on.
- Hey.

196
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,960
Well, that's a relief, okay, because she's
too fine a babe for a dipstick like you.

197
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:15,300
Well, thank you. I think.
You volunteered for this?

198
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,466
- I don't have a mommy.
- That's so sad.

199
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,341
Isn't it? I'd feel better
if you gave me $ 100.

200
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:25,449
Come on, Earl. Earl, come on.
Here's some spaghetti.

201
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,949
Look out! You see why
I didn't clean up the place.

202
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,486
The Mongol hordes
would just wreck it again.

203
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,521
What will you do
when you go to the lab?

204
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,158
- Take them with me?
- Barry.

205
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,317
Julio had his three nephews
there once.

206
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,726
They made that stink bomb, and the station
was evacuated for two days.

207
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:42,833
Good point. Well, I don't know.
What do you suggest, daycare?

208
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,402
- The circus?
- What about Joan?

209
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:47,698
She's got a lot on her mind,
don't you think?

210
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,569
She loves kids. Maybe having
them around would do her good.

211
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,211
- These two?
- She's a vet.

212
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,748
And your little boy's
been missing for how long?

213
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:04,812
Two days.

214
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,019
I can't believe he'd run away.

215
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:12,019
We don't have much,
but I try to make a good home for him.

216
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,189
Don't worry, we'll find him for you.

217
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,528
They usually don't go far.

218
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,194
I hope you're right.

219
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,696
Listen...

220
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,639
...do you have an aspirin or something?
A glass of water?

221
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,041
Sure. I'll be right back.

222
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,204
Thank you.

223
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:57,405
Earl's a picture of health, but how
did he get spaghetti sauce all over him?

224
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,373
The little monsters.

225
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:04,039
- I understand. They're a real handful.
- Both hands. And the way they eat...

226
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,616
Joan, they're a mouthful too.

227
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,015
You think you're gonna
be able to handle them?

228
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,521
Yeah. Like I said on the phone,
I could use the help.

229
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:16,354
And frankly, having someone else
to worry about can't hurt.

230
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,223
You forget...

231
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:22,265
...how much time you give
the people in your life.

232
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:26,195
Joan, I hope you don't mind, but I've
gotta ask you a couple of questions.

233
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,601
- Barry.
- It's okay, Tina.

234
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,698
What was your husband working on?

235
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:33,743
We had a rule at home.
Work stays at the office.

236
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:38,110
The only thing I do know is that he had
been bringing home a lot of dead files.

237
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,683
- Stuff from college.
- Were there any notes?

238
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,616
An address book, anything like that?

239
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:47,748
Phil lived out of his file-a-data,
and he had that with him in the car.

240
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,594
Oh, no! Oh, gosh!
Oh, come on! Oh, God!

241
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,732
Oh, come on, come on, come on!
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

242
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,131
Let's get out. Come on. Come on, you.
Go. Let's go. Out! Out! Out!

243
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,168
This is not a good idea, young lady!

244
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,706
- These are not stuffed animals!
- Hey, you. <i>Ándale.</i> Here you go.

245
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,572
As for you, young man,
you are old enough to know better.

246
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:10,408
- They looked cramped. So sue me.
- That cuts no ice with me!

247
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:14,074
These are sick animals.
You might have hurt them.

248
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,352
Just for this...

249
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,822
...you're both walking Brutus.

250
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,487
Brutus? Which one is Brutus?

251
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,725
Come on, Brutus. Move it, huh?

252
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,733
Summer of love is here again.

253
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,567
Candles?

254
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:39,336
Hey, incense? Peppermint?

255
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,174
- Spare change?
- Get a job, hippie.

256
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,945
I got a job.

257
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,028
Hey, Pepper.

258
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,862
This is West.
I found the kid you're looking for.

259
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:11,966
- Hey, Terry, your shoe's untied.
- Very funny. Make me laugh next time.

260
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,844
Hi. Cute dog.

261
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,006
Watch out. He's an attack dog.

262
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:23,484
Listen. I'm kind of lost.
Do you know the way to the waterfront?

263
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:28,888
- Yeah. Follow the seagulls. Come on, Cory.
- Hey. I'll never find it by myself.

264
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,052
How about taking a ride,
showing me the way?

265
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,223
- Are you crazy? Get lost.
- I've got a gun in my purse.

266
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,969
- Get in the van.
- Brutus, attack!

267
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,104
Get away!

268
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:03,021
Brutus, I like a mouse with an attitude.

269
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:13,165
- Do it harder, Pepper.
- Wow, you really do have a third eye.

270
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:16,034
I have more eyes than you can count.

271
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:20,709
A pair of them told me you tried to grab
the kid and got stopped by a schnauzer.

272
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,780
Well, hey, the mutt had rabies.
He almost ripped my face off.

273
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,281
- Do I have to send someone else?
- No.

274
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,544
- I thought you could handle this for me.
- I can.

275
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,187
Then what are you going to do?

276
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,485
Well, you know that report
I stole from the station?

277
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,456
It said the kid never went to juvie.

278
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,653
He's in custody of some cop
named Barry Allen.

279
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:42,856
Okay. Find out who he is.

280
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:47,899
Have someone watch the station.
Get a license plate number.

281
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:52,737
Bribe some DMV slave and get
a home address. Must I do everything?

282
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,445
You're wearing patchouli oil.

283
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,106
That's very nostalgic.

284
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:02,176
A police scientist.

285
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,549
I wonder if his civil servant's
brain can grasp...

286
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:10,718
...the elegant complexities
of Blue Paradise.

287
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:15,155
It might just blow his mind.

288
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,999
Barry. Barry.

289
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,607
- Thanks, Julio.
- You look beat, man.

290
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:33,649
Cory's on my bed. Terry's on the couch,
I'm on the floor with Earl. And he snores.

291
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,947
Well, you're the one who
wanted to play bachelor father.

292
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,783
- The Sullivan murder.
- Yeah.

293
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,857
- Think it was a Mob hit?
- No. No way.

294
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,723
Bomb was amateur night, man. You can
pick up that stuff from any hardware store.

295
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:48,559
Radicals in the '60s used to build them,
but those guys aren't around anymore.

296
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,498
But Sullivan was on to that
Blue Paradise story. Maybe he...

297
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,639
...crossed a drug dealer or two?

298
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:58,867
I need his notes, you know. They're in his
file-a-data, and that went up in the blast.

299
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,672
No, it didn't.
File-a-datas are made out of leather...

300
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:05,510
...and the only leather we found
at the crime scene were from his shoes.

301
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,711
I've gotta find that notebook.

302
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:25,362
You were careless, Duvivier.

303
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,404
Don't ever sell my wares
to people you don't know.

304
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,667
Come on, Lesko,
the cops had nothing on me.

305
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:35,973
I'd never give your name up, you know that.
They're just part of the equation.

306
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,912
I have been at this since before
you were even a bad idea...

307
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,848
...and I've never let the law
be a part of any equation.

308
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,511
What am I supposed to do
about the Flash?

309
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:47,852
The Flash?
You sure you're not hallucinating?

310
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:52,019
Hallucinating? Lesko, I don't hallucinate.

311
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:55,724
I think you're confusing me with
one of your brain-dead hippies here.

312
00:23:55,901 --> 00:24:00,270
And who dresses you guys anyway?
It ain't the '60s anymore...

313
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:04,100
There was a whole lot less peace and love
back then than you think.

314
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,439
Could you watch the car?
I just had it redone.

315
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,312
Thank you.

316
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,481
Moe.

317
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:18,649
Thank you.

318
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:25,955
The idea, Duvivier, is to make people die
if they don't get their Paradise...

319
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,292
...not if they do.

320
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:39,004
Now go and spread my gospel.

321
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:42,442
I want everyone to share my dreams...

322
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:45,276
...and my nightmares.

323
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:59,958
Even with 100 Duviviers,
it's moving too slowly.

324
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:03,794
I need to find a way
to get us the entire city.

325
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:09,000
A population of addicts thanking me
with their bank accounts...

326
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:13,167
...for admitting them to Paradise.

327
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:21,882
Washing cats, shampooing dogs. This has
to be the boring-est day ever spent.

328
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:25,079
- Well, Cory enjoyed it.
- Yeah, she was just being polite.

329
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:29,353
Is that why she asked Joan to let her
close up? You know, went right by me.

330
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,793
Listen, since it's just us,
why don't we go out for a pizza. Or four.

331
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:34,955
- Yeah, whatever.
- Yeah.

332
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:39,467
You know, you're making a mistake.
You know? I mean...

333
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,873
You stick us in a foster home, we're out of
here. Me and Cory are better on our own.

334
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:47,569
- You think so?
- When did you leave home?

335
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:51,238
- When I was 19, for college.
- You going back?

336
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:55,409
- No, of course not.
- You get my point.

337
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,595
- Okay, baby. We're on.
- Wow, yeah!

338
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,088
Barry?

339
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,720
Hey, Barry, you okay?

340
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:42,994
Barry! Barry!

341
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,999
Gotcha, kid!

342
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,368
Barry!

343
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,098
- Barry! Barry!
- Come on!

344
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,115
You can't get away with this!
My dad's a cop!

345
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:47,194
You guys should have worn
your seat belts.

346
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:52,669
- Flash!
- Never accept rides from strangers.

347
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:01,145
- I'm telling you guys, I saw him.
- Blurry, kind of like a red ghost?

348
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:02,836
Yeah, that's him.

349
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:06,313
Sure. Why don't you two form a club?
You can join too, Allen.

350
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,817
- I never seen him.
- They hire you on a jerk quota, Murphy?

351
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:11,819
That's two.

352
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:16,484
Hey, Murph, I got some cold drinks over
there. Come on. Thanks for the pizza, guys.

353
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:23,533
Okay, Terry, who are these guys?
Why'd they grab you?

354
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:27,194
How should I know?
You're the one with the rap sheets.

355
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,704
Well, all right, let's take a look.

356
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:35,970
Looks like both these guys
have a lot of narcotics arrests.

357
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:41,712
- You involved with drugs, Terry?
- Hey, come on, I'm not that stupid.

358
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,356
My life is hard enough.

359
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:49,224
Barry. Those two guys you brought in
are freaking out in lockup.

360
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,555
Stay here, Terry.

361
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,961
Man, they look like hell.
But they don't seem to be...

362
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:02,004
Well, five seconds ago, they were jumping
around and screaming like apes in a cage.

363
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:04,300
- No lie.
- Open the cell. Let me check them out.

364
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:07,138
- Are you sure, Allen?
- I gotta check them out.

365
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,603
Careful, Barry.

366
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:12,406
Okay.

367
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,456
Barry, look out!

368
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,561
Time to die, friend!

369
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,103
I got him! I got him!

370
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,042
Call the paramedics!

371
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:49,314
- This one's dead.
- So is this one. What the hell are they on?

372
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:51,819
Blue Paradise.

373
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:56,022
Terry, take your sister upstairs.
Get her ready for bed, all right?

374
00:29:56,194 --> 00:30:00,631
Good night, Cory. Thank you. You were
great with Mrs. Galuchi's weird dog.

375
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,267
- What a knucklehead.
- No kidding.

376
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,233
See you tomorrow.

377
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,198
- Barry?
- Yeah, sweetheart.

378
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:13,037
We don't get to stay here forever?

379
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:16,936
I'm afraid not, Cory.

380
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,977
But listen, maybe we can find you
someplace you can.

381
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,948
Yeah, right.

382
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,926
- Joan, listen. Thanks for everything.
- Yeah.

383
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:33,791
If it weren't for you, those kids
would run me into the ground.

384
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:38,061
But I just... I don't know.
They're so hard-boiled.

385
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,069
Were we as cynical at that age?

386
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:46,138
- How are you getting along with...?
- There's nothing yet.

387
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,211
- I'll keep you posted.
- All right.

388
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,108
- Okay?
- I'll see you in the morning...

389
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:52,181
...when you drop the kids off.
- Yeah.

390
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,343
And, Barry, thanks again.
It really is great therapy.

391
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,421
- Yeah, shock therapy, huh?
- Bye-bye.

392
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,182
Bye-bye.

393
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:09,258
Well, she's all conked out.
You know, Allen...

394
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,868
...you're all out of potato chips
and stuff.

395
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,027
I wonder why.

396
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:17,066
Terry, I've been talking
to the cops down in Helltown...

397
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:21,611
...and it seems they're looking
for a skateboard snatch-and-run artist.

398
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,679
Could that be you?

399
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:26,282
- Yeah, well, way past my bedtime, huh?
- Yeah.

400
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:28,346
Come on.

401
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,314
All right.
Okay, what do you want me to do?

402
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:33,957
Learn to say,
"Will there be fries with that, please?"

403
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,525
Equal opportunity counts for zip
when you're 13.

404
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:39,527
Those kidnappers are dealers.
Didn't snatch you for no reason.

405
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:42,393
Look, I've seen these crackheads
and these needle freaks.

406
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,058
And they all end up
like those two in jail.

407
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,306
I've got Cory to take care of.
Who else is gonna protect her, you?

408
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:53,137
No, I'm just trying to find out who
you've gotten messed up with and why.

409
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,144
Now, what have you lifted lately?

410
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:00,317
- Terry!
- Nothing! A doll, a knapsack.

411
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,885
A knapsack? Okay. From where?
From whom?

412
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,249
Some car in front
of the <i>Daily News</i> building.

413
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,254
The <i>Daily News</i> building?

414
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,417
- What kind of car?
- I don't know! It was a red car, okay?

415
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,153
When was this, huh?

416
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,991
- Look, it's important!
- All right!

417
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:16,190
- This was last week?
- Yes, it was last week!

418
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,232
- Just stop grilling me.
- Sullivan's car.

419
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:21,497
- What did you grab? Where is it?
- You're a really dull dog, Allen.

420
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,506
You know that? I mean,
you take us into your house...

421
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,268
...you let us trust you.

422
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,311
All this social-worker crap
to get me to cop to some boosts!

423
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,041
- Man, you are way off base.
- To hell with that and with you! Okay?

424
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:37,051
- Why don't you give me a break?
- Me and Cory got along fine before you.

425
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:41,123
- Nobody wants us, and we don't need you.
- I am trying to help you!

426
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:44,791
Look, the only one
in this whole stinking town...

427
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,626
...who hasn't been jabbing me
is the Flash.

428
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,529
All right.

429
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,092
The Flash!

430
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,592
- What are you doing here?
- Keeping an eye on you.

431
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:21,823
- You've made a lot of enemies.
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right.

432
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,662
You definitely saved my bacon
back there.

433
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,770
How do you do it?

434
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,929
The speed, I mean.

435
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,339
It just happens.

436
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,807
- Do you wanna check it out?
- Are you serious?

437
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,346
Just keep your balance.

438
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,279
Awesome!

439
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:03,000
I may be fast, Terry, but there's
some things even I can't run away from.

440
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:06,675
- Like what?
- Like trouble, for one.

441
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:10,177
Word on the street is you'd do almost
anything to protect your sister.

442
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,441
What happens if you end up
in juvenile hall?

443
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,648
- Hey, I'm not gonna get busted.
- Don't kid yourself.

444
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,813
Look, I know life's been hard for you.
But you can't do it alone.

445
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,692
Find someone to trust.
Someone who can help you.

446
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:30,067
What you're involved in is bigger
and more dangerous than you know.

447
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,426
All right, man. Listen, l...

448
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:39,169
I never went through the bag.

449
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:44,805
- All I wanted was the doll for Cory.
- Yes! Here it is.

450
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,019
I'll tell you one thing.

451
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:54,681
We're a lot closer now
to figuring this whole mess out.

452
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,763
Well, I analyzed the Blue Paradise.

453
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,374
It's an extremely powerful
hallucinogen euphoric.

454
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,975
With a healthy load
of amphetamine for a boost.

455
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:15,237
The smallest amount
could rewire your head.

456
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:18,974
Yeah, I've seen a few rewired heads lately.
Rewired to death.

457
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,481
Barry, who's behind all this?

458
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:24,951
I don't know. According to Sullivan's notes,
only person capable is Beauregarde Lesko.

459
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,591
- Lesko? Who's that?
- An outlaw chemist.

460
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:30,488
Went berserk in San Francisco
in the late '60s.

461
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:34,722
Only problem is
he died 20 years ago.

462
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:39,863
- Joan, listen, thanks for babysitting.
- <i>No problem.</i>

463
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:41,732
Thank Tina too.

464
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:45,899
- I think we're really on to something. Bye.
- <i>Bye</i>.

465
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:50,706
All they had were mushu fajitas.

466
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,217
- I'll pass.
- You'll pass?

467
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:58,082
Julio, look at this. I accessed the file
from the Central City Library.

468
00:35:58,256 --> 00:35:59,951
- Check it out.
- So? This isn't news.

469
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:02,718
Yeah, but this is. FAA report.

470
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,658
Plane went down over the Pacific.
No bodies were recovered.

471
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:10,324
The only evidence that Lesko was ever on
that plane was his signature on the charter.

472
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:13,263
- What's this?
- The most advanced hallucinogen...

473
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:17,032
...l've ever come across. Fries your brain
before you wanna kick the habit.

474
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,176
Nobody but Lesko
could have synthesized it.

475
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,278
- What are you trying to say?
- I think Lesko faked his death...

476
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,846
...went underground.
Now he's back, bigger than ever.

477
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,814
That's what Sullivan discovered,
and it cost him his life.

478
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:32,479
So you're saying Lesko is still alive and
you think the kid has Sullivan's evidence?

479
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:38,285
Yeah, dispatch. Allen, Crime Lab. You have
a squad car watching my house, right?

480
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:42,930
- No, no. Just checking. Thanks.
- Relax. You sent the car hours ago.

481
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,762
Nobody is gonna get those kids.

482
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:50,897
- Why can't I go with you?
- Because it's business, Cory, okay?

483
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,566
What kind of business?

484
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:00,442
I'm gonna sell something to a guy,
and with the money he gives me...

485
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:03,109
...it's enough to take care of us
for a long time.

486
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:05,482
- Does Barry know about this?
- No.

487
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:09,387
No. Barry's all right.
He's a great guy...

488
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,155
...but sooner or later, he's gonna have
to put us in a foster home.

489
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,496
But with the money I'll get, hey...

490
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:20,000
...you know, we can go wherever we want
and no one's gonna tell us what to do.

491
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:24,267
- That would be great, right?
- I guess.

492
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,506
Okay. Now, listen up.

493
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:29,339
I'm giving one of these to you, all right?

494
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:31,504
And I'm gonna keep the other one.

495
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:35,846
If I'm not back in a couple of hours,
you give that to Barry.

496
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:40,087
And don't worry, because everything's
gonna be cool from now on.

497
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:42,686
Okay.

498
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:48,996
Lesko. Lesko, chill out.

499
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:54,001
I've been sitting outside his apartment
all night. I'm tired, I'm hungry and...

500
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:59,506
I know! But there's a cop car
parked right out in front.

501
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,668
What am I gonna do?

502
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:06,405
Wait a minute. Something's going down.

503
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,655
- Okay.
- Where did you come from?

504
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:25,666
I called the false alarm. By the time they
figure that out, we'll be out of here.

505
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:28,168
Just take me to Lesko.

506
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:32,866
What's the matter? You ever see
a drug-free face before? Step on it.

507
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:43,319
- All right, call if you hear anything, okay?
- <i>Okay. Bye.</i>

508
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,784
Thanks.

509
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:47,583
Well, I checked the zoo. No luck.
There's an APB out.

510
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,988
- Barry, we're so sorry.
- Don't be silly, Joan.

511
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:54,188
I know what these kids are capable of.
Cory, listen to me.

512
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:57,357
If you know anything at all about this,
you must tell me.

513
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,366
I can't. I promised Terry.

514
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:03,200
But Terry could get hurt.
So we have to help him.

515
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,872
He went to sell something
and get big bucks.

516
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,138
- Sell what?
- One of these.

517
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:13,806
- A dragon?
- No, this.

518
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:36,003
Johnny, how you doing?
You look good tonight.

519
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:39,074
Excuse me. Could I speak to you
two ladies for a second?

520
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:43,043
Don't worry about the line. I'll get you in.
I know the owner. We're good friends.

521
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,705
I was just wondering if...

522
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:49,842
...you two girls would maybe like
to take a little trip to Paradise?

523
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:09,570
Get off me, man. You got nothing on me.
I'm clean.

524
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,141
You're dirty as the drugs you deal.
Now tell me where Lesko is.

525
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:16,473
- Lesko? What's Lesko?
- I can take you apart faster than a car.

526
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,979
No tools required.

527
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:24,281
All right, it's the old
Fillmore Central, downtown.

528
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,950
Thanks.

529
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,710
Well, well, well,
if it isn't our favorite rodent.

530
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,367
Come on, dirt bag, let's go.

531
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:50,907
Look, Mr. Lesko.

532
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:54,414
I've got all your dirt right here
on the disk.

533
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:59,446
- The price I'm asking is cheap.
- A million dollars.

534
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:03,753
Kids. Why not 2 million? Or 5?

535
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:08,422
It doesn't matter. What makes you think
you'll live to spend a nickel?

536
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,264
I made a copy. Anything happens to me,
it goes straight to the police.

537
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:17,896
Did anyone ever tell you
how the universe works?

538
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,975
It's the duality of life:

539
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,875
The yin, the yang.
The Tao, the balance.

540
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:26,482
Now, it's true that you
have something that I want...

541
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:30,586
...but if I dose you with Blue Paradise,
I'll have something that you'll want.

542
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:33,120
You'll be so desperate
for another fix...

543
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,418
...you'll sell your own sister.
And then maybe...

544
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,926
...maybe I'll give you more.

545
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:43,089
But not until you give me the second disk.
And I promise you...

546
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:46,293
...you will hand it over gladly.

547
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,131
Moe.

548
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,248
Relax, Terry. You're going to have
lots of company.

549
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:03,450
I've filled enough canisters to strap to
a half-dozen choppers I've got standing by.

550
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,111
Imagine...

551
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:09,988
...a shimmering cloud of Paradise
drifting over Central City as she sleeps...

552
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,494
...and come tomorrow morning,
we'll have a town full of addicts.

553
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,366
Pepper...

554
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,698
...you may do the honors.

555
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:29,775
- Ready to get turned on, junior?
- Is it okay if I just say no?

556
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,243
What a trip.

557
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,817
What is that?

558
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,960
Just a bad flashback, Lesko.

559
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,796
Terry, take off!

560
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:58,538
Get up!

561
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:35,204
Get those canisters together. I want
them on the copters in an hour!

562
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:40,679
- Hey. Hey, Flash, you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. I think so.

563
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:45,345
Lesko hit me with some of that Paradise,
but I think I burned it out of my system.

564
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:47,786
You went through that brick wall
like a ghost.

565
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,951
Yeah, I guess my molecules were vibrating
so quickly I passed right through the wall.

566
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:55,492
Weird.

567
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,714
Hey, Lesko! You ready to rock?

568
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:07,263
All right! Yes!

569
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:24,751
Wish I could change your minds. New York
can be a pretty tough town on your own.

570
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:31,256
So you want me to drive you
to the bus station?

571
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:33,919
I mean, you got a long ride
to New York as it is.

572
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:38,000
No. I think we'll walk.
Listen, thanks for everything.

573
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:41,899
- We'll send you a postcard.
- All right. Here you go.

574
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,063
Bye, Barry.

575
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,232
So long, sweetheart.

576
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:51,740
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Hey, wait.

577
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,406
Joan came here to see you, all right?

578
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,645
Joan, you coming to New York
with me and Terry?

579
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:01,154
I don't think so.
But I might have a better idea.

580
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,725
How would the both of you like
to come live with me?

581
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:06,055
That way we could
take care of each other.

582
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,926
- You set this up, didn't you?
- Well...

583
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:11,465
- Come on, Cory, let's get out of here.
- Terry.

584
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:15,867
All right. That's what you want, fine.
All right. I'm going to New York.

585
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,700
Terry, wait a minute.

586
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:22,539
I've known you for a few days, all right?
And I know you're a tough guy.

587
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:26,246
Are you tough enough
to do the right thing?

588
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:31,846
Okay. All right. For Cory.

589
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,519
- But only under one condition.
- What?

590
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:37,683
Next person who asks me
to shampoo a cat dies.

591
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,422
- Deal.
- All right.

592
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:42,189
All right.

593
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,292
