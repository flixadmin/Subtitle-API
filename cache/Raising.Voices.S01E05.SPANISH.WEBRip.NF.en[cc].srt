what's the big deal?

100

I mean, after matches.

119
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,640
Or are you the kind of guy who showers
with their clothes on, Christian?

Fine.

150

Um, maybe ask the guys
at the park or... I don't know?

Let's just say unavailable.

158
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,520
Um, and, you don't know anyone else?

159
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,040
Alma, Alma, Alma, please, please,
please, please, please. Please. Please.

160
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,360
Yes?

00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
How long's it been?

173
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,720
Last time I saw you, you ran off.

174
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,280
Yeah, I was late for a thing.

175
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,720
[Kevin] Hm. And what brings you here?

176
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,040
My friend Greta.
She wants to buy some weed.

177
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
- [Kevin] Greta.
- Hm.

178
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
[Kevin] All right.

179
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
Take a seat.

180
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,640
You two want a beer or something?

181
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
We're pressed for time.

182
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,960
[Jota] You seem a bit, uh, nervous, Alma.
You're not wearing a wire, are you?

183
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,400
Go on then, pull up your shirt.

184
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,120
You, chill out.

185
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,600
Things are a little bit tense
with the authorities.

186
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,800
Yeah.

187
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,200
I'll take five grams. Will you sell to us?

188
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
Yeah, yeah.

189
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,880
- Let's go, come on.
- [Kevin] Wait, wait, wait.

190
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
Wait.

191
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,720
You can't leave..

192
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,440
without trying it.

193
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,560
Uh, no, thanks.

194
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,000
I have things to do
so I can't get stoned before then.

195
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,600
You won't take off your coat.

196
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,840
You don't want to sit,
you don't wanna drink.

197
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,240
I don't sell to clients
who don't show respect.

198
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,800
Give me back the pot.

199
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,040
Gimme. [clears throat]

200
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,680
Well, look, this weed
of yours fucking blows. Hm?

201
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,120
So give me my money back,

202
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,720
and we will find somewhere else to buy,

203
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,920
because well there's
plenty of dealers nearby. Hm?

204

[tense music plays]

No, I'm kidding, dude.

206
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,960
Actually, your weed is pretty dope.
You grow it yourselves?

207
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,240
Because, well, I have this friend
who smokes substantially

208
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,000
and we're seeing each other tonight.

209
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,400
And, well, maybe could come by
and buy weed every day...

210
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,600
Well, not every day,
but every week, maybe?

211
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,240
[laughs] This chick?

212
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,160
[Kevin] I like you, Greta.

213
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,040
[Alma] I don't want you
to go back there alone.

214
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,080
Don't worry about it. Those guys
are idiots. Playing tough, that's all.

215
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
No,

216
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
They're gross.

217
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
Well, you're gross, then.

218
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,640
Dude, this is not a joke.

219
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,400
- Okay, fine.
- I don't want you to ever go there alone.

220
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,400
All right!

221
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,560
I get it, stop worrying.

222
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,760

Mm.

[Greta] Hmm.

233
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,800
Were you two together for a while?

234
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,000
Very long time, yeah.

235
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,560
But well, some stuff ended up going down

236
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,800
and I realized
that I no longer wanted that.

[Greta chuckles]

You know, hardly anything
in my life was the way I wanted it.

239
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,120
And you know, it's important
to permit yourself to do what you want to.

- For sure. Well, hey...
- Mm.

Here's to doing what we want.

Absolutely. 'Cause when you least
expect it, everything goes to shit.

Yeah.

The truth is, life can just be

a bit really fucking cruel at times.

246

my mother finds European subsidies
for local governments and stuff.

He isn't now though.

Mm, very cool.

Oh, hey! I have the polish here.
Uh, I'll do yours.

- Wait.
- What? You have nail polish with you?

265
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,440
Come on, dude, of course. You never know
whose nails you might have to do.

266
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,360
- [laughs]
- [Greta] For real.

267
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,920
I mean, I like the color for you,

268
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,760
but I don't think it'll complement me.

269
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,600
Of course it will! It's beautiful.
Come on.

Your buddies that sell pot
in the area. Kevin and Jota.

They're not my buddies.

And no, I didn't say anything.

Why?

295
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,200
Because I had someone
send another dick pic.

I'm pretty sure they wouldn't do that.

That way, when we got a big shipment,

he would alert the Guardia
