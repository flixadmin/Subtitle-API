1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,210
Previously on "The Flash"...

2
00:00:01,213 --> 00:00:02,922
It's the city, they're
responding to my article.

3
00:00:02,924 --> 00:00:04,703
This guy says he saw
DeVoe on 5th and Knoll

4
00:00:04,706 --> 00:00:05,781
- two days ago.
- Yeah.

5
00:00:05,784 --> 00:00:07,485
This means DeVoe can't
hide from us anymore.

6
00:00:07,487 --> 00:00:09,266
The injection of dark
matter from the thinking cap,

7
00:00:09,268 --> 00:00:10,648
which overwhelmed my synapses.

8
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:12,296
The more I try to use my brain,

9
00:00:12,299 --> 00:00:13,695
the sooner I'm going to lose it.

10
00:00:13,698 --> 00:00:15,297
DeVoe plans to position each

11
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,058
of his five satellites around the globe.

12
00:00:17,061 --> 00:00:18,463
And when the satellite link up...

13
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:21,437
He'll use that network to emit a
series of dark matter bursts.

14
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,468
It will reboot the pre-frontal cortex

15
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:25,575
of every man, woman,
and child on this earth.

16
00:00:25,578 --> 00:00:27,840
We know we need a tech-free projectile

17
00:00:27,842 --> 00:00:29,408
to stop DeVoe's satellites.

18
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,709
We've been looking for an object

19
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:32,965
when what we really need is a person...

20
00:00:32,968 --> 00:00:34,246
Amunet.

21
00:00:34,248 --> 00:00:37,536
It will deliver one
savage concussive blow.

22
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:39,251
But you only get one shot.

23
00:00:39,253 --> 00:00:41,553
Initially we set out
to enlighten the world.

24
00:00:41,555 --> 00:00:44,356
Now you want to rule it.
I am leaving you, Clifford.

25
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:51,426
_

26
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:00,706
Agent Diggle. Good to see you, sir.

27
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:03,008
- We have the specimen ready...
- The specimen?

28
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,543
That's a man in there

29
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:06,020
that we are supposed to protect.

30
00:01:06,023 --> 00:01:07,212
Of course, sir.

31
00:01:07,214 --> 00:01:08,847
Our most powerful meta-dampeners

32
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:10,977
are set on the building, I assure you.

33
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:15,781
- Elvis Banana.
- Hendrix Spaghetti.

34
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,717
- Eye scan?
- DNA sample, sir.

35
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,453
Central City branch
had some trouble with

36
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:22,591
a transmogrifier this time last year.

37
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:24,227
You're good to go, sir.

38
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,064
Good. Now drop the dampener.

39
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:28,399
Got caught in a blast.

40
00:01:28,402 --> 00:01:29,968
Slugger's microchipped now,

41
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,371
Dampener scrambles the frequency.

42
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,108
Technical, this is Castlellan.

43
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,906
Lower the drawbridge.

44
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,751
Thank you, gentlemen.

45
00:01:52,026 --> 00:01:54,626
Modern music.

46
00:01:54,628 --> 00:01:57,629
So lacking in the harmonic
resources necessary

47
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:59,831
for expressiveness.

48
00:02:01,735 --> 00:02:04,036
For profundity.

49
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:09,107
Timpani in Handel's
orchestra weighed 140 pounds,

50
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:12,044
the exact gravitational
force that I am now exerting

51
00:02:12,046 --> 00:02:13,612
on your lungs.

52
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:20,752
Music Appreciation 101.

53
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:24,323
This evening's recital
will be conducted by your...

54
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:26,091
beloved professor.

55
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:30,211
Who goes there?

56
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:31,813
Oh!

57
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:33,783
My wife...

58
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,167
cared very little for violence.

59
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,637
- Stay where you are!
- Me...

60
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,039
Not so much.

61
00:02:42,977 --> 00:02:44,776
- What's going on?
- Oh...

62
00:02:46,113 --> 00:02:47,946
Go!

63
00:03:08,102 --> 00:03:09,945
Get out of my mind!

64
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,506
Move, move, move!

65
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:20,312
Ahh!

66
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:04,750
Hey!

67
00:04:04,753 --> 00:04:06,290
Oh!

68
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:09,428
Come on, come on!

69
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:31,183
And God said, "Let there be light."

70

71
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:40,492
Okay we've got eyes on Cape Canaveral,

72
00:04:40,494 --> 00:04:44,062
Space X, and the Xichang Space Center.

73
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:45,625
And Blackhawk Island.

74
00:04:45,628 --> 00:04:47,841
That's every launch pad
south of the 39th parallel.

75
00:04:47,844 --> 00:04:49,167
Good man.

76
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,069
Okay, are we sure that DeVoe is gonna

77
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,537
launch the machine from an airfield?

78
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:54,211
If he's shooting five satellites

79
00:04:54,214 --> 00:04:56,708
into synchronous orbit,
that's the latitude he needs.

80
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,677
And whether or not
he's still moping around

81
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:00,935
about his wife ditching
him, he's gonna resurface.

82
00:05:00,938 --> 00:05:02,114
And he's gonna do it soon.

83
00:05:02,116 --> 00:05:05,164
When he does, I whoosh. You whoosh.

84
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:06,585
She bangs.

85
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:08,220
If I can get there in time.

86
00:05:08,222 --> 00:05:09,621
I mean, I'm still not fast enough

87
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:12,224
to make it to DeVoe's pocket dimension.

88
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:14,266
That's why we split up. Yeah.

89
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:16,669
Each one of us stakes out
a different launch pad.

90
00:05:16,672 --> 00:05:17,648
You're serious?

91
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,359
I mean you've seen DeVoe in action.

92
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:22,100
Yeah, the guy's a one
man Legion of Doom.

93
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:23,672
So send the Super Friends.

94
00:05:23,675 --> 00:05:25,857
Okay, but we're not at full
super strength right now.

95
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,478
I mean Joe's got the baby on the way

96
00:05:27,481 --> 00:05:29,473
and Caitlin's looking for Killer Frost.

97
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:32,144
Harry's...

98
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:36,081
This chair came out of nowhere.

99
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,359
So hey, Allen. West-Allen.

100
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,920
- Ramon.
- Cisco.

101
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:44,689
Cisco Ramon. Guys.

102
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:46,525
Check this out. Okay?

103
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:50,125
Somebody has been
blogging about the Thinker.

104
00:05:50,128 --> 00:05:51,997
About DeVoe and the bus
metas, all of it, okay.

105
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,678
And if we find this blogger,
we can stop the Thinker.

106
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,172
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, buddy.

107
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:57,434
That's... that's my blog.

108
00:05:57,437 --> 00:05:58,970
Look at the byline.

109
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:01,973
It's not written by
Iris West-Allen, okay?

110
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:07,045
It's written by Anonymous
Central City Citizen.

111
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:08,750
Mic drop.

112
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:10,549
- Hold on to that mic.
- It's imaginary.

113
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:14,753
I asked you to proofread
this for me, remember?

114
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:17,022
You asked me to proofread this when?

115
00:06:17,024 --> 00:06:18,657
This morning.

116
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:19,991
That's when.

117
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:23,895
When you said, "Harry...
will you proofread,

118
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:25,363
- will you proofread..."
- Yeah.

119
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:29,901
Let's start by finding him
a room with less chairs.

120
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:32,204
Okay. Good.

121
00:06:32,206 --> 00:06:34,172
- Is that powder on the floor?
- Ayay-ay.

122
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:36,675
You have 400,000 new views.

123
00:06:36,677 --> 00:06:39,044
- That's amazing.
- I know, right?

124
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:41,112
I mean, people have been
writing in from all over

125
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:44,382
sharing their theories and
reporting DeVoe sightings.

126
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:45,977
- And Marlize sightings?
- Yeah.

127
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,586
I've been trying to
track her down for days.

128
00:06:47,588 --> 00:06:49,654
I know Harry thinks that they split up,

129
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:51,731
but she's still just
as dangerous as DeVoe.

130
00:06:51,734 --> 00:06:55,360
Right, so wh... why would
we send citizens after her?

131
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:57,862
I'm all for telling
people the truth, but...

132
00:06:57,864 --> 00:06:59,820
Yeah, I mean after I convinced you.

133
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:01,105
Yeah, I just... I don't know.

134
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:02,492
I don't know if it's the best idea

135
00:07:02,495 --> 00:07:05,069
to send people out there
to do our jobs for us.

136
00:07:05,072 --> 00:07:07,672
No, we're inspiring them, Barry.

137
00:07:07,674 --> 00:07:09,741
I mean, we could be
the ones to show them

138
00:07:09,743 --> 00:07:11,555
how to do the right thing.

139
00:07:11,558 --> 00:07:12,857
Oh.

140
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:16,758
- I just got a new lead.
- Hmm.

141
00:07:18,652 --> 00:07:20,164
Fallout...

142
00:07:21,945 --> 00:07:23,867
So you think your psychosis made

143
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,490
a friend of yours disappear?

144
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:30,055
Yeah, I mean, she's a
really good friend of mine.

145
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:32,024
Almost like a part of me.

146
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,900
So your friend, is...

147
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:38,036
she with us here right now?

148
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:40,872
Oh, no, I'm not schizophrenic, um...

149
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:43,642
she's more like another personality.

150
00:07:43,644 --> 00:07:46,278
Dissociative identity disorder.

151
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,281
That is usually caused by trauma,

152
00:07:48,284 --> 00:07:50,949
and from your history
you've had quite a bit.

153
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:53,184
Yeah, I did see my fiancé die.

154
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:54,919
Twice.

155
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:56,554
And then my next boyfriend turned evil.

156
00:07:56,556 --> 00:08:00,025
I actually meant childhood trauma.

157
00:08:00,027 --> 00:08:02,360
Tell me about your father.

158
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:04,258
My dad? He was the best.

159
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:05,596
Loving, supportive,

160
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,198
always pushed me to get smarter.

161
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,568
And how did you feel when he passed?

162
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,338
I... He had ALS, he...

163
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,173
was always hiding his symptoms from us.

164
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:17,275
He never wanted us to see him suffer.

165
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:18,810
Sometimes when we're young

166
00:08:18,812 --> 00:08:20,512
we repress things that scare us.

167
00:08:20,514 --> 00:08:23,081
Oh, I'm not repressing
anything from my childhood.

168
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:26,188
My missing friend just
appeared a couple years ago.

169
00:08:26,191 --> 00:08:27,663
It's my adult life

170
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,365
that's got me like this.

171
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:32,523
I'm so sorry. I have to go.

172
00:08:32,526 --> 00:08:34,559
Do you charge by the hour?

173
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:37,095
For you and your friends,

174
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:38,897
the quarter-hour.

175
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,565
I got a tip about Fallout,
but it's been scrambled

176
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:42,967
by Kilgore's code.

177
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:45,270
Hmm, not anymore.
Consider it unscrambled.

178
00:08:45,272 --> 00:08:46,688
Devoe.

179
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:48,552
Where's A.R.G.U.S.
keeping Borman? Do we know?

180
00:08:48,555 --> 00:08:50,608
I-I can't ping Lyla, but I can try Dig.

181
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,677
I'll just go get him.

182
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,961
- Uh...
- Trash can.

183
00:08:53,964 --> 00:08:56,398
- Ooh, how about the recycling?
- Nope.

184
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:58,982
- I got it, I got it.
- Really?

185
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:01,319
Seemed like a good idea at the time.

186
00:09:02,823 --> 00:09:03,955
Sorry, man.

187
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:07,158
I'm sorry.

188
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,516
Mm-hmm.

189
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,361
Can we just... I'm sorry.

190
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:12,497
I hate you. What is this about?

191
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:14,132
Neil Borman, the man we left with you,

192
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:16,758
with A.R.G.U.S. Where you keeping him?

193
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:18,256
Barry, that's classified information.

194
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:19,392
I'm not the director of A.R.G.U.S. I...

195
00:09:19,394 --> 00:09:20,560
Dig, we don't have time.

196
00:09:20,563 --> 00:09:22,396
Please.

197
00:09:24,144 --> 00:09:26,611
He's at a place called the Castle.

198
00:09:26,613 --> 00:09:28,480
It's a thousand miles
away from anything.

199
00:09:28,482 --> 00:09:30,482
Please. Can you check it?

200
00:09:37,724 --> 00:09:40,325
Okay, looks like everything's
fine in A.R.G.U.S.

201
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:42,494
except for me.

202
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:45,563
Um... Says I checked in six hours ago.

203
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:48,032
DeVoe can shapeshift.

204
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:50,702
With Melting Point's powers,
he can trick a DNA scanner

205
00:09:50,704 --> 00:09:52,337
and take over the building.

206
00:10:00,814 --> 00:10:04,349
Hey, Diggle. Diggle, Diggle.

207
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:06,117
10,000 rads and climbing.

208
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,719
Borman's body's gone critical already.

209
00:10:07,721 --> 00:10:09,086
We can't save him.

210
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:10,522
If that chamber hits 100k,

211
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:12,322
it'll start generating nuclear fusion.

212
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:15,172
- Like core of the sun fusion.
- Infinite fuel.

213
00:10:15,175 --> 00:10:16,861
He's using Borman's body as a battery.

214
00:10:16,863 --> 00:10:18,630
That's the last piece of the Machine.

215
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:19,641
Wait. A battery?

216
00:10:19,644 --> 00:10:21,380
Borman's containment
cell is 10 feet tall.

217
00:10:21,383 --> 00:10:22,959
And DeVoe has the
power to shrink it down.

218
00:10:22,961 --> 00:10:24,302
He'll charge the satellites.

219
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:26,104
All he'll have to do is launch 'em.

220
00:10:26,106 --> 00:10:27,505
How long do we have?

221
00:10:27,508 --> 00:10:30,064
At this rate of fusion, we have...

222
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:34,546
12 hours until the Enlightenment begins.

223
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:43,210
Okay, Dig's back in Star City.

224
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:44,578
Now, I'm going after DeVoe.

225
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,247
Don't go storming the Castle just yet.

226
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:50,050
You're looking at motion-
activated electro-shock plates

227
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:52,617
that A.R.G.U.S. installed in the facility.

228
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,253
70,000 volts? You hit one of those,

229
00:10:54,256 --> 00:10:55,588
you'll be knocked out for sure.

230
00:10:55,591 --> 00:10:57,124
So I'll avoid them when I go in.

231
00:10:57,126 --> 00:10:58,992
Okay. Genius idea,

232
00:10:58,994 --> 00:11:02,095
if their placement didn't
randomize every couple hours.

233
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:04,464
So DeVoe's basically charging
his battery for 12 hours,

234
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:06,700
completely protected
by A.R.G.U.S. defenses.

235
00:11:06,702 --> 00:11:09,469
And then he'll probably just
jump into a pocket dimension,

236
00:11:09,471 --> 00:11:11,038
and he's out of there.

237
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,391
What if I don't avoid the plates?

238
00:11:13,394 --> 00:11:16,145
What if I hit 'em? All of 'em.

239
00:11:16,148 --> 00:11:18,544
I'm serious. I mean,
if I go into Flash Time,

240
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:20,147
I could use each
plate's electric current

241
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:21,882
as a fuel source.
Then I'd be fast enough

242
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:23,684
to follow DeVoe into
his pocket dimension.

243
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:25,451
You would get a serious boost.

244
00:11:25,454 --> 00:11:27,454
Again, another genius idea,

245
00:11:27,456 --> 00:11:30,557
if hitting the plates didn't
cause an electrical explosion.

246
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,528
Yeah, but I'd be through
the pocket dimension

247
00:11:32,531 --> 00:11:33,627
before the blast wave,

248
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:35,518
ready to blow up the
satellite on the other side.

249
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:38,865
Satellite results came in.

250
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:40,567
Okay.

251
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:41,794
Oh, frell me.

252
00:11:41,797 --> 00:11:42,836
What? What is it?

253
00:11:42,838 --> 00:11:44,171
We got six plates

254
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:47,341
and six heat signatures above them.

255
00:11:47,343 --> 00:11:49,509
There are A.R.G.U.S.
agents still alive in there.

256
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:51,144
He has hostages.

257
00:11:51,146 --> 00:11:53,513
You can outrun an electrical explosion.

258
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:55,682
They can't.

259
00:11:55,684 --> 00:11:58,518
How's he keeping them
suspended like that?

260
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,484
I think I know how.

261
00:12:03,992 --> 00:12:08,027
Do you know what my favorite thing

262
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,664
about teaching is?

263
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:15,302
Having a captive audience.

264
00:12:18,398 --> 00:12:20,583
I haven't moved from
this spot in three days.

265
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:23,243
Baby, you're gonna have to
carry me into the hospital.

266
00:12:23,245 --> 00:12:25,545
Okay, so I got snacks.

267
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:28,989
I got clothes for you. I
got clothes for the baby.

268
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:30,484
Damn, I forgot something.

269
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:33,720
Joe, we are not gonna need
a katana at the hospital.

270
00:12:33,722 --> 00:12:35,445
Okay, so you're in my head again

271
00:12:35,448 --> 00:12:36,857
and it's entirely possible
that we get attacked

272
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:38,425
by a samurai at the hospital.

273
00:12:38,427 --> 00:12:41,061
You have already repacked
that bag five times.

274
00:12:41,063 --> 00:12:43,163
You've read ten different
books on birthing methods.

275
00:12:43,165 --> 00:12:44,764
By the way, I love the one about Lamaze.

276
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:46,967
- Yeah, but...
- Damn, where is this boy?

277
00:12:46,969 --> 00:12:49,302
You have already left
Wally a dozen voice mails.

278
00:12:49,304 --> 00:12:50,904
He's literally on a time machine,

279
00:12:50,906 --> 00:12:53,273
so he has no excuse
not to show up on time

280
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:55,008
to meet his new baby sister.

281
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,344
I'm sorry. It's just nerves.

282
00:12:57,346 --> 00:12:59,770
We've both done this before.

283
00:12:59,773 --> 00:13:01,882
Not gonna be any surprises, okay?

284
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:04,217
This is gonna be...

285
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:07,187
totally sick.

286
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:08,855
Sick?

287
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:11,692
Are you feeling sick?

288
00:13:11,694 --> 00:13:13,660
Nah, brah, nah.

289
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:16,645
This delivery is gonna be sick.

290
00:13:16,648 --> 00:13:18,747
Having this baby is gonna be like

291
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,536
one epic wave.

292
00:13:22,538 --> 00:13:24,404
You okay? You're scaring me.

293
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:26,273
Far out!

294
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:28,909
That's the 'za I ordered.
'Chovies and pineapple.

295
00:13:28,911 --> 00:13:31,545
- Tubular.
- Tubular, brah!

296
00:13:31,547 --> 00:13:32,979
There's your 'za!

297
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:34,560
That'll totally be 8.50.

298
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,117
- Thanks, brah.
- Hey, this house is...

299
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:38,225
Bitchin', yeah, everybody says that.

300
00:13:38,227 --> 00:13:39,903
No. Hard to find.

301
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:42,022
Those are some gnarly bushes outside.

302
00:13:46,228 --> 00:13:48,995
Let's crush some 'za, brah.

303
00:13:48,997 --> 00:13:51,832
Dude! Dude?

304
00:13:53,944 --> 00:13:55,634
Where is she?

305
00:13:55,637 --> 00:13:57,337
Where is...?

306
00:13:57,339 --> 00:13:59,474
Ahh, where is she? I don't see her.

307
00:13:59,477 --> 00:14:02,375
No, Harry, I... I'm talking
about tracking down Marlize.

308
00:14:02,377 --> 00:14:04,644
If DeVoe has popped back
up then she might too.

309
00:14:04,646 --> 00:14:06,170
And we need to put her erin the Pipelie

310
00:14:06,172 --> 00:14:07,781
before she causes any trouble.

311
00:14:07,783 --> 00:14:09,616
- How are you tracking her?
- Well, my readers

312
00:14:09,618 --> 00:14:10,984
have sent in hundreds of tips.

313
00:14:10,986 --> 00:14:12,285
Plus there's facial recognition

314
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:14,020
- and credit card checks...
- Facts.

315
00:14:14,023 --> 00:14:15,489
- Right.
- Wrong.

316
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:17,691
- What?
- You're looking at facts

317
00:14:17,693 --> 00:14:20,118
when you should be focusing on feelings.

318
00:14:20,121 --> 00:14:22,989
You remember the Council of Harrisons?

319
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:24,798
- I do.
- Handsome but annoying.

320
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,200
Well, they kind of taught
me that if you wanna...

321
00:14:27,202 --> 00:14:28,635
if you wanna follow DeVoe's actions

322
00:14:28,637 --> 00:14:30,516
you gotta focus on DeVoe's motives.

323
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:32,844
Which is basically DeVoe's feelings,

324
00:14:32,847 --> 00:14:36,114
and so feelings, if
you're Marlize DeVoe...

325
00:14:36,117 --> 00:14:39,179
Where are you gonna feel safe?

326
00:14:39,181 --> 00:14:41,548
So if I dig into her past,

327
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,651
maybe I can figure out where she is now.

328
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:47,954
Harry, that's really helpful. Thank you.

329
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:51,424
Thank you, Iris West,
for saying that, I...

330
00:14:51,426 --> 00:14:55,529
I-I don't feel helpful that much anymore.

331
00:14:55,531 --> 00:14:57,397
So thanks.

332
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,866
Hey, um...

333
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:03,203
Are you busy, Harry? Me?

334
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:05,272
Yeah, you.

335
00:15:05,274 --> 00:15:07,107
Would you maybe wanna
help me investigate?

336
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:09,476
- Yes.
- Okay, cool.

337
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,314
- When...
- We're gonna... Right now.

338
00:15:16,018 --> 00:15:18,151
Hey. Did you guys send an alert?

339
00:15:18,153 --> 00:15:19,886
We did. We think we've figured out

340
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:22,088
how to stop DeVoe and save the hostages.

341
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,456
What... what is it?

342
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,492
Us.

343
00:15:25,494 --> 00:15:27,801
You bring us into Flash Time with you.

344
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,789
Look guys, that's great, you know,

345
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:36,431
you want to help, but we
can't split up in A.R.G.U.S.

346
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:38,267
if I'm holding onto you the whole time.

347
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:41,504
Well, survey says...

348
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:43,239
you don't have to.

349
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:45,141
Have you guys been researching me?

350
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:47,109
At first we thought you
were vibrating our molecules

351
00:15:47,111 --> 00:15:48,577
when we were in Flash
Time, but that didn't

352
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:49,845
explain why we were conscious.

353
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:51,814
Which gave us this brain blast.

354
00:15:51,816 --> 00:15:54,950
When you run, you don't just
tap into the Speed Force.

355
00:15:54,952 --> 00:15:56,886
You generate Speed Force around you.

356
00:15:56,888 --> 00:15:58,454
It's like you're creating lightning

357
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,591
to protect you from the friction

358
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:00,756
Like an aura.

359
00:16:00,758 --> 00:16:02,658
So when I bring you into Flash Time

360
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,669
I'm actually extending my
Speed Force aura to you.

361
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:08,715
And what if physical touch
just focuses those powers?

362
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,585
I could let go. Share my speed.

363
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:13,034
We'd only be able to last a few moments

364
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:14,078
before we burnt out.

365
00:16:14,081 --> 00:16:16,004
Like 55 milliseconds of real time.

366
00:16:16,006 --> 00:16:17,185
And thanks to relativity,

367
00:16:17,188 --> 00:16:19,632
that gives us just enough
time to rescue the hostages

368
00:16:19,635 --> 00:16:21,601
while you chase DeVoe
down the rabbit hole.

369
00:16:21,604 --> 00:16:23,273
Guys, I mean...

370
00:16:23,276 --> 00:16:24,943
you know everything looks normal to me

371
00:16:24,946 --> 00:16:26,600
when I'm in Flash Time,
but it took me months

372
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:27,802
to learn how to operate like that.

373
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:29,117
Exactly.

374
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,422
That's what makes you the
perfect candidate for training.

375
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:34,525
Train us.

376
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:36,140
I know it's a leap, Barry,

377
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:37,862
but we're running out of time

378
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:39,734
and I just think it might work.

379
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,177
Okay. Ready?

380
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:58,314
One second on the clock.

381
00:16:58,316 --> 00:17:00,149
Go.

382
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:07,756
Oh, Flash Time, how I've missed thee.

383
00:17:07,758 --> 00:17:09,937
Here we go.

384
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,560
Is that lightning about to hit me?

385
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:13,460
You wanted to do this.

386
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:21,904
It's working.

387
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:23,742
Thank you, Speed Force.

388
00:17:23,745 --> 00:17:26,046
Okay, here we go.

389
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:27,976
Just remember, when
you're moving this fast

390
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:29,378
it's not about running with your legs.

391
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,747
It's about staying
calm, focused, centered.

392
00:17:31,749 --> 00:17:33,754
Otherwise you're gonna
fall on your ass at Mach 3.

393
00:17:33,757 --> 00:17:36,710
Yeah, okay, sensei, I'm
just opening a breach.

394
00:17:38,723 --> 00:17:39,968
You good?

395
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:41,357
It's a little harder than I thought.

396
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,953
Maybe if I shift my weight.

397
00:17:42,956 --> 00:17:45,010
You know, you're burning up already.

398
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:46,079
You okay?

399
00:17:46,082 --> 00:17:47,715
I...

400
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:49,797
- I-I can't move my leg.
- What?

401
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,400
- My leg's not working.
- All right, stay calm.

402
00:17:51,402 --> 00:17:53,302
Remember, concentrate.
You're slowing down.

403
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:55,477
I can't really concentrate...
I-I gotta, gotta keep it loose.

404
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:57,106
I gotta keep moving, I've
got to breach, I mean...

405
00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:59,174
- You gotta stay calm.
- Okay, well,

406
00:17:59,176 --> 00:18:01,810
I gotta get the leg to move.

407
00:18:01,812 --> 00:18:03,145
Now both of my legs are stuck.

408
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:05,514
- What?
- My... my legs are stuck.

409
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:08,083
I'm working with two
frozen drumsticks here.

410
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:10,019
- Okay, just relax.
- Okay.

411
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:11,585
Now I'm falling.

412
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:12,787
Ah...

413
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,359
- You okay?
- Yep. Yep.

414
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:19,995
My leg's just asleep,
but I'm gonna get this.

415
00:18:19,997 --> 00:18:22,231
- I'm telling you.
- Okay.

416
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:26,268
It's Joe and Cecile.

417
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,237
Do you think I can spare a minute?

418
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:29,734
Just gotta walk it off.

419
00:18:29,737 --> 00:18:31,804
- Yeah.
- We could use a break.

420
00:18:33,444 --> 00:18:35,511
Good news is you're totally healthy.

421
00:18:35,513 --> 00:18:37,231
Thank God.

422
00:18:38,276 --> 00:18:41,215
Oh, no, Caitlin, please
don't think "relax."

423
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:42,580
If you were nine months pregnant

424
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,253
and you suddenly started
craving Master Kush and surf,

425
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:46,622
I don't think that you would relax.

426
00:18:46,624 --> 00:18:48,515
Actually, I was thinking relaxin.

427
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:49,715
The hormone?

428
00:18:49,718 --> 00:18:51,251
As we get closer to your due date,

429
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:53,328
your body releases relaxin
to loosen the ligaments

430
00:18:53,331 --> 00:18:55,698
to make it easier to deliver the baby.

431
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,333
It's like you're literally stretching.

432
00:18:57,335 --> 00:19:00,502
So you think this hormone is
stretching her meta powers?

433
00:19:00,504 --> 00:19:02,906
Yes, I think instead of
just reading people's minds,

434
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:06,177
she's now inhabiting them.

435
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,606
Great. That's great. I mean that's just

436
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:10,247
one more thing for me
to talk about in therapy.

437
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,948
I mean can you believe what
Dr. Finkel said this morning?

438
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,751
Babe, we didn't see her this morning.

439
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:17,186
Uh, I did.

440
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:19,188
She thinks that I'm
repressing something.

441
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,223
I mean, repressing something?

442
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:22,991
How crazy is that? Oh, my God.

443
00:19:22,993 --> 00:19:27,129
This Erlenmeyer flask is
covered in water spots.

444
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:28,731
Yeah, she's definitely me.

445
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:30,299
Here why don't I give you this.

446
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:32,601
It'll help you take some
deep breaths and focus.

447
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:35,204
I'm familiar with an
albuterol inhaler, thank you.

448
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:42,344
Oh, my God. Oh, oh,
I'm so sorry, Caitlin.

449
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:43,679
Don't worry about it.

450
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:45,848
You're just going off my instincts.

451
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,916
How do we stop this
from happening again?

452
00:19:47,918 --> 00:19:50,953
I don't think we can
until you give birth.

453
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:52,654
So I think the best thing to do

454
00:19:52,656 --> 00:19:55,991
is actually keep you
isolated and use this.

455
00:19:56,694 --> 00:19:58,460
Come on, we can handle that.

456
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,663
Okay. I'm gonna get back to training.

457
00:20:01,665 --> 00:20:04,166
Thank you, Caitlin.

458
00:20:04,168 --> 00:20:06,635
Hey, Caitlin? For what it's worth,

459
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:09,705
when I was you back
there for like 20 seconds,

460
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:12,741
it seemed like you were
trying to ignore something.

461
00:20:12,743 --> 00:20:15,078
Something really big.

462
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,800
And if there's anything
that I've learned

463
00:20:16,803 --> 00:20:19,180
from having these powers,
it's that you cannot hide

464
00:20:19,183 --> 00:20:22,084
from anything forever.

465
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,987
You just be careful, okay?

466
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:32,528
Marlize Malan.

467
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,363
Born in Cape Town.

468
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:37,156
Cape Town. Summers by the sea.

469
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:39,025
Picking grapes in the vineyard.

470
00:20:39,028 --> 00:20:42,870
Got a PhD in inflationary
theory and engineering.

471
00:20:42,873 --> 00:20:45,340
Cute little button nose
always buried in her book.

472
00:20:45,342 --> 00:20:47,309
So nice.

473
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,060
Tenured as a professor
of engineering at Oxford

474
00:20:49,062 --> 00:20:50,395
where she met Clifford DeVoe.

475
00:20:50,398 --> 00:20:51,856
Where she met her husband to be.

476
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:53,786
Isn't that romantic? A continent apart,

477
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:56,140
yet they find each other. So romantic.

478
00:20:56,143 --> 00:20:58,286
I mean, it's beautiful
when you think about it.

479
00:20:58,289 --> 00:21:00,389
- It's... it's... what?
- Beautiful. What is that?

480
00:21:00,391 --> 00:21:02,057
- What are you doing?
- I'm empathetic.

481
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:03,564
I'm being empathetic...
Council says be empathetic.

482
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:04,932
I'm empathetic. You know?

483
00:21:04,935 --> 00:21:06,196
I'm putting myself in Marlize's shoes.

484
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,664
I should see if she's got a
pair of shoes, put myself in 'em.

485
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,515
No, Harry. This?

486
00:21:10,518 --> 00:21:12,218
This is not a love story, okay?

487
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:13,635
She married a psychopath.

488
00:21:13,637 --> 00:21:16,004
Psychopath now, not then.

489
00:21:16,006 --> 00:21:17,444
Back then he had feelings.

490
00:21:17,447 --> 00:21:18,948
They loved each other. He had feelings.

491
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,375
She had feelings then he...

492
00:21:20,377 --> 00:21:22,778
Lost the feelings, and
that's why she got out.

493
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,979
That's why she left.

494
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:26,148
She left.

495
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:30,185
West-Allen.

496
00:21:30,187 --> 00:21:32,020
We should turn Marlize.

497
00:21:32,022 --> 00:21:33,789
Harry, no. I don't think you even know

498
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:35,157
- what you're saying right now.
- I know what I'm saying.

499
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:36,959
I know. I have... I have bad days.

500
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:38,927
Dumb Harry. But I'm not dumb today.

501
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:40,829
Today's a good day.
We should turn Marlize.

502
00:21:40,831 --> 00:21:42,464
Marlize can help us.

503
00:21:42,466 --> 00:21:44,333
And why would she want to do that?

504
00:21:44,335 --> 00:21:45,724
To stop the psychopath.

505
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:47,830
Right? Protect the man
trapped inside the monster.

506
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,205
Marlize can save everybody.
Marlize is the key.

507
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:52,007
Harry, we've tried that already.

508
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:54,755
With Savitar, remember? It didn't work.

509
00:21:54,758 --> 00:21:56,512
You can't save monsters.

510
00:21:56,514 --> 00:21:58,013
Marlize isn't a monster.

511
00:21:58,015 --> 00:22:00,482
And besides...

512
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:02,017
the clock's ticking.

513
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:04,099
It's like ten hours
before the Enlightenment.

514
00:22:04,102 --> 00:22:05,401
What do we have to lose?

515
00:22:05,404 --> 00:22:08,119
She stabbed me with a katana, Harry.

516
00:22:08,122 --> 00:22:10,273
Our lives are what we have to lose.

517
00:22:10,276 --> 00:22:12,643
We can't save anyone if we're all dead.

518
00:22:12,646 --> 00:22:14,897
- Right.
- We're going to bring her in

519
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:18,888
and we're gonna stop her so she
doesn't hurt anyone ever again.

520
00:22:18,891 --> 00:22:20,419
Okay.

521
00:22:23,755 --> 00:22:25,088
I left some of my files at home.

522
00:22:25,091 --> 00:22:26,624
I'll finish my investigation there.

523
00:22:26,627 --> 00:22:28,210
- I'm gonna come with.
- No I'm fine, Harry.

524
00:22:28,212 --> 00:22:29,830
- You stay here, okay?
- I'll come with.

525
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,548
- Harry!
- I'll just stay here.

526
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,341
Just stay right here.

527
00:22:40,691 --> 00:22:43,792
All right, just remember
to stay calm this time.

528
00:22:43,794 --> 00:22:46,528
- Why are you looking at me...
- I wasn't... Both of you.

529
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:51,767
All right. Take two.

530
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,339
- Yes!
- Nice!

531
00:22:57,341 --> 00:22:59,875
- Brrrrat!
- A little baby breach.

532
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:02,144
That's right, Barry. A baby breach.

533
00:23:02,146 --> 00:23:04,746
And in time, she'll
blossom into maturity,

534
00:23:04,748 --> 00:23:06,882
but for now, in Flash Time, she's...

535
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:08,116
my little breachling.

536
00:23:08,118 --> 00:23:10,886
Okay. Cait.

537
00:23:12,356 --> 00:23:14,790
Cold Gun's still not working,
just like Killer Frost.

538
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:16,725
We gotta find a way to
off-set the friction.

539
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:18,827
Ah, damn it.

540
00:23:18,829 --> 00:23:20,271
- Oh...
- My leg's stuck.

541
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,874
All right, just stay calm.

542
00:23:21,877 --> 00:23:23,143
Hey, watch out!

543
00:23:23,146 --> 00:23:24,745
Ah...

544
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:29,396
Dad! My leg's stuck.

545
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:31,325
Caitlin, watch out!

546
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,506
- Caitlin!
- Cait!

547
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:45,739
- What happened?
- Training.

548
00:23:45,742 --> 00:23:47,379
You came out of Flash Time in midair.

549
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:48,896
I think you got concussed.

550
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:50,499
Then again, I'm not the team doctor.

551
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:52,642
I mean, I don't feel nauseous.

552
00:23:52,645 --> 00:23:54,303
Just hand me some acetaminophen,

553
00:23:54,305 --> 00:23:56,405
- and get back to training.
- No, hold on.

554
00:23:56,407 --> 00:23:58,974
We have to talk about what happened.

555
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,361
What do you mean? You
just lose focus, right?

556
00:24:01,364 --> 00:24:02,878
- Yeah.
- No, it was...

557
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,707
I don't know. Something
pulled your focus.

558
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,815
- No, I'm fine.
- If this were the real thing,

559
00:24:07,818 --> 00:24:09,942
- you would have died.
- I'm not a liability.

560
00:24:09,945 --> 00:24:11,478
I know.

561
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:14,221
I am. I'm putting you
guys in danger doing this.

562
00:24:14,224 --> 00:24:15,657
I mean I-I realize
you guys want to help,

563
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:17,028
but I've got to stop training you.

564
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:18,664
Barry, come on. Those hostages...

565
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,066
I'll find another way to save 'em.

566
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:21,395
You have to let us help you.

567
00:24:21,398 --> 00:24:23,264
I mean, after everything
DeVoe did to us...

568
00:24:23,267 --> 00:24:24,866
Killer Frost.

569
00:24:24,868 --> 00:24:26,501
She's right.

570
00:24:26,503 --> 00:24:29,071
We're running out of
time. It's worth the risk.

571
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,741
I'm not training you guys
just to get you killed.

572
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:36,044
I'm sorry.

573
00:24:44,955 --> 00:24:47,255
West-Allen!

574
00:24:47,257 --> 00:24:49,192
West-Allen!

575
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:50,825
Of course he followed me home.

576
00:24:50,828 --> 00:24:52,760
West-Allen!

577
00:24:52,763 --> 00:24:54,696
West Allen!

578
00:24:54,698 --> 00:24:57,833
- West-Allen!
- Apartment five.

579
00:24:57,835 --> 00:25:01,036
- Hi.
- Five... Oh, you moved.

580
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:03,271
- No.
- This...

581
00:25:03,273 --> 00:25:04,981
- This is apartment four.
- Four.

582
00:25:04,984 --> 00:25:06,675
- You're in apartment five.
- Yes.

583
00:25:06,677 --> 00:25:10,645
So, look, I just came
to say you were right.

584
00:25:10,647 --> 00:25:12,347
Trying to put myself in Marlize's shoes,

585
00:25:12,349 --> 00:25:15,951
and I forgot I should also try
to put myself in your shoes.

586
00:25:15,953 --> 00:25:17,496
Thanks.

587
00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:19,854
It's very big of you to admit
that you were wrong, Harry.

588
00:25:19,857 --> 00:25:21,723
I'm not... I don't
know if I was wrong...

589
00:25:21,725 --> 00:25:23,492
The word you said.
It's more like I'm dumb.

590
00:25:23,494 --> 00:25:24,526
I'm dumb now.

591
00:25:24,528 --> 00:25:25,961
- Harry.
- Yeah?

592
00:25:25,963 --> 00:25:27,478
Marlize is not gonna help us

593
00:25:27,481 --> 00:25:29,164
fight her husband out of love.

594
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:31,600
Love. Exactly.

595
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:34,035
Look, she... look...
The Enlightenment was not

596
00:25:34,037 --> 00:25:37,559
born out of love. She's
always been an activist.

597
00:25:37,562 --> 00:25:39,141
Look at that. Even before she met DeVoe,

598
00:25:39,143 --> 00:25:40,675
she was trying to save people.

599
00:25:40,677 --> 00:25:42,679
Yes, her earlier papers
were very optimistic.

600
00:25:42,682 --> 00:25:44,181
She thought that technology could...

601
00:25:44,184 --> 00:25:45,881
- Could liberate humanity.
- Humanity. Right.

602
00:25:45,883 --> 00:25:47,790
But she's not saving anyone now.

603
00:25:47,793 --> 00:25:50,118
Not according to your perspective.

604
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,988
What about her perspective?
Put yourself in her shoes.

605
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,523
Come in, please.

606
00:25:54,525 --> 00:25:57,457
You know? Just put
yourself in her shoes.

607
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,759
- Okay?
- Harry.

608
00:25:58,762 --> 00:26:00,028
- Yeah?
- Take your shoes off.

609
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,682
You put on my shoes, and
I'll put on your shoes.

610
00:26:01,684 --> 00:26:02,520
- We'll both trade shoes.
- No.

611
00:26:02,522 --> 00:26:04,372
No, Harry, I don't want
to try your shoes on.

612
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:06,034
I want you take your shoes
off. You're tracking mud

613
00:26:06,036 --> 00:26:07,689
all through my house. Please.

614
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:10,405
Oh. Right. Sorry.

615
00:26:10,407 --> 00:26:12,474
It is kind of...

616
00:26:12,476 --> 00:26:14,668
- more of a loft.
- This is my home, okay?

617
00:26:14,671 --> 00:26:16,588
This is the first place that
I've lived in with Barry.

618
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,447
It makes me feel loved and safe,

619
00:26:18,449 --> 00:26:21,049
and so we are going
to keep it nice and...

620
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:23,919
Clean.

621
00:26:23,921 --> 00:26:25,320
What? What is it?

622
00:26:25,322 --> 00:26:27,656
What are you thinking about?

623
00:26:27,658 --> 00:26:30,004
I think I know where Marlize is hiding.

624
00:26:31,695 --> 00:26:33,262
Apartment four.

625
00:26:33,265 --> 00:26:34,813
No, not apartment four.

626
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:38,043
Babe.

627
00:26:38,046 --> 00:26:39,260
Babe?

628
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:43,337
What are you doing?

629
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,307
I gotta get this bag ready. Uh...

630
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:47,375
I got, I got snacks. I got water.

631
00:26:47,377 --> 00:26:49,311
I got a change of clothes for the baby.

632
00:26:49,313 --> 00:26:51,513
Forgot a change of clothes for me.

633
00:26:51,515 --> 00:26:53,548
You're me?

634
00:26:55,018 --> 00:26:56,785
This a whole new level of weird. Stop.

635
00:26:56,787 --> 00:26:59,371
Give me this...

636
00:26:59,374 --> 00:27:00,722
Sit down.

637
00:27:04,851 --> 00:27:06,473
Okay...

638
00:27:17,608 --> 00:27:19,307
Better?

639
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:20,876
Who the hell are you anyway?

640
00:27:20,878 --> 00:27:22,410
Okay, not better. I'm calling Caitlin.

641
00:27:22,412 --> 00:27:23,845
What are you doing in my house?

642
00:27:23,847 --> 00:27:25,981
Cecile, this is our house.

643
00:27:25,984 --> 00:27:27,884
Cecile? Why do you
keep calling me Cecile?

644
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:29,153
My name's not Cecile.

645
00:27:29,163 --> 00:27:31,363
I'm Joe West. Um...

646
00:27:31,366 --> 00:27:33,181
Okay don't! Joe! Joe.

647
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,624
Joe, sit down.

648
00:27:35,626 --> 00:27:37,259
Sit down.

649
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:39,728
Okay. I need you to take a deep breath.

650
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,264
In through your nose.
Out through the mouth.

651
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:44,466
Close your eyes.

652
00:27:44,468 --> 00:27:51,239
Imagine that you're sitting
in a big, beautiful sea.

653
00:27:51,241 --> 00:27:56,745
The waves are cresting
over you, back and forth.

654
00:27:56,747 --> 00:27:59,895
Those waves... that's Joe.

655
00:27:59,898 --> 00:28:01,882
Now look up.

656
00:28:01,885 --> 00:28:05,120
Big, dark, beautiful sky

657
00:28:05,122 --> 00:28:08,490
with one shining star.

658
00:28:08,492 --> 00:28:11,159
That star is you, Cecile.

659
00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:16,293
Great. How do you feel?

660
00:28:19,703 --> 00:28:22,340
- Joe?
- Oh, God.

661
00:28:22,343 --> 00:28:25,106
You pulled me back. How
did you pull me back?

662
00:28:25,108 --> 00:28:27,042
- Lamaz?
- I-I had to switch

663
00:28:27,044 --> 00:28:28,443
some things up in my head, but...

664
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:32,747
Hey, am I crazy, because you were...

665
00:28:32,749 --> 00:28:35,550
Babe, trust me. There are far worse

666
00:28:35,552 --> 00:28:37,552
heads I could have been stuck in.

667
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:42,524
I love you.

668
00:28:46,062 --> 00:28:48,128
You figure it out yet?

669
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:52,000
No, I-I shut down the generator.

670
00:28:52,002 --> 00:28:54,469
I can save the hostages,
but DeVoe still gets away,

671
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:55,770
and then, you know.

672
00:28:55,772 --> 00:28:57,639
Actually, I meant...

673
00:28:57,641 --> 00:29:00,008
Have you figured out how come...

674
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,611
you lost your damn mind?

675
00:29:02,613 --> 00:29:05,213
Okay. Look, I'm sorry. I'm just...

676
00:29:05,215 --> 00:29:06,548
You're just trying to keep us safe.

677
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,116
I know. It's starting real familiar

678
00:29:08,118 --> 00:29:09,417
coming out of your mouth.

679
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:11,019
You're not ready to use Flash Time.

680
00:29:11,021 --> 00:29:12,921
- Not like that.
- We will be ready

681
00:29:12,923 --> 00:29:14,309
if you train us.

682
00:29:14,312 --> 00:29:16,969
It takes more than ten
hours to learn Super Speed.

683
00:29:16,972 --> 00:29:18,492
Okay? You guys could do in there.

684
00:29:18,495 --> 00:29:20,662
And if you don't take
us, we'll die anyway.

685
00:29:20,664 --> 00:29:22,329
Our brains get wiped, and that's it.

686
00:29:22,332 --> 00:29:23,999
- That's the end of our world.
- No!

687
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:26,267
Losing both of my best friends
and it being my fault...

688
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:27,606
That's the end of my world.

689
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:29,070
You may think it's worth the risk,

690
00:29:29,072 --> 00:29:31,640
but I couldn't live with myself.

691
00:29:31,642 --> 00:29:33,341
Barry.

692
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:35,410
You cannot sideline us because

693
00:29:35,412 --> 00:29:37,176
of what happened to him.

694
00:29:40,617 --> 00:29:41,816
All right.

695
00:29:41,818 --> 00:29:43,585
I don't need another therapist.

696
00:29:43,587 --> 00:29:45,575
Look we all lost somebody, okay.

697
00:29:45,578 --> 00:29:47,311
But that never gives us an excuse

698
00:29:47,314 --> 00:29:49,356
to shut each other out.
I said drop it, all right?

699
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,625
You think you're the
only one who feels bad

700
00:29:50,627 --> 00:29:51,832
- about Ralph dying?
- Guys...

701
00:29:51,835 --> 00:29:53,927
You know he came to
see me at Iron Heights?

702
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:56,097
He told me he was afraid.
He warned me he wasn't ready.

703
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:57,966
But I pushed him anyway.
I said go back out there

704
00:29:57,968 --> 00:29:59,968
and do my job. My burden.

705
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,103
We made the bus metas.

706
00:30:02,105 --> 00:30:03,705
We gave Ralph his powers.

707
00:30:03,707 --> 00:30:06,207
You wanna talk about
burdens. I started this.

708
00:30:06,209 --> 00:30:08,877
I shot that bazooka. I
opened up the Speed Force,

709
00:30:08,879 --> 00:30:10,612
and I didn't do it so you can stand here

710
00:30:10,614 --> 00:30:13,415
and tell me you're going to
save the world alone again.

711
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:15,770
I... I know that.

712
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:18,040
And I know we're running
out of time and...

713
00:30:18,043 --> 00:30:21,178
I can't do this by myself, but...

714
00:30:21,181 --> 00:30:23,758
Everybody I've tried to
teach has ended up worse

715
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,959
than when I found them.

716
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:26,327
And what about Ralph?

717
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:28,697
Was he worse?

718
00:30:28,699 --> 00:30:31,059
You taught him that when his back

719
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,701
was against the wall
and the world was ending

720
00:30:32,703 --> 00:30:34,736
around him he could
always make the choice.

721
00:30:34,738 --> 00:30:37,639
Make the choice to be a hero.

722
00:30:37,641 --> 00:30:40,842
We deserve that same choice.

723
00:30:40,851 --> 00:30:43,485
All we need is someone to show us how.

724
00:30:46,817 --> 00:30:48,983
You guys really want to do this?

725
00:30:48,985 --> 00:30:51,086
It's not a burden if
we shoulder it together.

726
00:31:00,197 --> 00:31:01,596
We found her.

727
00:31:01,598 --> 00:31:04,799
- You found Marlize?
- I think so.

728
00:31:04,801 --> 00:31:08,269
She's in England.

729
00:31:08,271 --> 00:31:09,871
All right.

730
00:31:09,873 --> 00:31:12,640
This is our last extrapolator.

731
00:31:12,642 --> 00:31:14,976
You set the coordinates,
it'll breach you there.

732
00:31:16,313 --> 00:31:18,513
We have to stop DeVoe.

733
00:31:18,515 --> 00:31:20,670
- By the time you get back...
- Hey.

734
00:31:23,653 --> 00:31:26,588
I love you.

735
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,991
- Go save the world.
- I love you.

736
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:33,428
Where're we at?

737
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:36,998
Borman's almost at 100,000 rads.

738
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,767
All right, we got to go. Come on.

739
00:31:41,271 --> 00:31:43,605
Thank you, subject seven.

740
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:50,378
Now your fire will light up the world.

741
00:31:56,231 --> 00:31:58,064
Perimeter's secure. Once we're inside,

742
00:31:58,066 --> 00:31:59,532
we'll have less than a second.

743
00:31:59,534 --> 00:32:01,282
I'll activate the
plates, draw their charge.

744
00:32:01,285 --> 00:32:02,769
- I'll lay the breachlings.
- And I'll protect

745
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:05,271
the A.R.G.U.S. agents from
the blast using this...

746
00:32:05,273 --> 00:32:07,040
- ice shooter.
- Ice shooter.

747
00:32:07,042 --> 00:32:08,475
Do I have to call it an ice shooter?

748
00:32:08,477 --> 00:32:10,035
I thought Frostbite sounded good.

749
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:12,277
Guys, it solves the
friction offset problem

750
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,955
by shooting ice, therefore
it's an ice shooter.

751
00:32:13,957 --> 00:32:15,448
- You call it an ice shooter.
- Relax.

752
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,215
It's just not that hard.

753
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,622
DeVoe must be shrinking
Borman's chamber.

754
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:28,676
We can do this.

755
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,457
Catch me if you can.

756
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:05,999
I've got the charge.

757
00:33:07,602 --> 00:33:09,168
Breachling is go.

758
00:33:11,373 --> 00:33:13,439
He's iced.

759
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:16,576
Five more to go. Remember, stay focused.

760
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:22,543
We did it.

761
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,355
"Once upon a time in some remote corner

762
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:30,125
of that universe, there was a star

763
00:34:30,128 --> 00:34:34,186
upon which clever
beasts invented knowing."

764
00:34:34,189 --> 00:34:37,090
You're quoting Nietzsche at me?

765
00:34:37,092 --> 00:34:38,958
You destroyed a satellite.

766
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,160
Top marks, quick boy.

767
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,229
You can destroy a thousand
more and you will still

768
00:34:43,231 --> 00:34:45,164
march closer to the Enlightenment.

769
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,167
I forget what Nietzsche
said about wiping minds.

770
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,887
I must have skipped Philosophy class...

771
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,603
Did I teach you nothing this year?

772
00:34:51,606 --> 00:34:54,105
Has nothing pierced you thick cowl?

773
00:34:54,108 --> 00:34:55,691
Think of it?

774
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:57,210
Or rather don't. You'll just end up

775
00:34:57,212 --> 00:34:59,178
hurting yourself, so let me explain.

776
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,848
A world enlightened.

777
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,884
Within a day, all soldiers
will lay down their arms.

778
00:35:04,886 --> 00:35:07,186
Every nuclear weapon will be disarmed

779
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,554
within six months.

780
00:35:08,556 --> 00:35:11,924
Poverty, famine, disease... Eradicated.

781
00:35:11,926 --> 00:35:14,193
We will clean up the streets.

782
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,329
People will put down their idiot phones

783
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:18,134
and become curious again,

784
00:35:18,137 --> 00:35:20,867
and I will be there to teach them.

785
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:23,236
I... not you...

786
00:35:23,238 --> 00:35:25,772
Will save this godforsaken world.

787
00:35:25,774 --> 00:35:27,206
No, you'll just control it.

788
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,875
You want to take away free will.

789
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,210
A pittance for humanity to pay

790
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,279
to know peace.

791
00:35:33,281 --> 00:35:35,381
But we wouldn't know each other.

792
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,184
Parents wouldn't remember their kids.

793
00:35:38,186 --> 00:35:40,420
Husbands wouldn't remember their wives.

794
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,890
Good. You hit upon

795
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,025
precisely the point.

796
00:35:46,027 --> 00:35:49,165
Emotion is the father of all error.

797
00:35:49,168 --> 00:35:52,231
Chemicals in our brain that distract us,

798
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,534
impede progress.

799
00:35:54,536 --> 00:35:57,813
And the most destructive
and ridiculous imbalance

800
00:35:57,816 --> 00:36:02,341
of all is that thing
you feebles call love.

801
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:08,714
I learned this from
experience, Mr. Allen.

802
00:36:08,717 --> 00:36:11,637
And soon... you will too.

803
00:36:21,098 --> 00:36:22,497
What happened in there?

804
00:36:22,507 --> 00:36:24,441
All that matters is
that you're all safe.

805
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:26,843
- But DeVoe? Where's DeVoe?
- Hey.

806
00:36:26,845 --> 00:36:28,278
Hey, don't worry.

807
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,713
- Flash is on it.
- Thank you.

808
00:36:33,185 --> 00:36:35,418
What's wrong?

809
00:36:36,888 --> 00:36:38,988
I need your help.

810
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,623
Back when we were training,

811
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:43,460
I had this fragment of a memory.

812
00:36:43,462 --> 00:36:45,028
I think it's something
that I've been repressing

813
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,464
for a long time. I don't remember much,

814
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:51,534
just that I was young
and I was terrified.

815
00:36:52,698 --> 00:36:54,898
Caitlin, are you sure you
want me to vibe you there?

816
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:56,935
I mean, maybe your
brain kept this memory

817
00:36:56,938 --> 00:36:58,470
under lock and key for a reason.

818
00:36:58,473 --> 00:37:00,176
I need to know what it was.

819
00:37:00,178 --> 00:37:02,245
I can handle it.

820
00:37:02,247 --> 00:37:05,448
Then focus on it and hang on.

821
00:37:09,086 --> 00:37:10,652
Caity!

822
00:37:10,655 --> 00:37:12,222
Oh, no! Caity!

823
00:37:12,224 --> 00:37:14,157
Caity, are you okay?

824
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,792
Stay still! We're gonna get you help!

825
00:37:15,794 --> 00:37:17,594
That's me. Right there.

826
00:37:17,596 --> 00:37:20,897
Caity... honey, don't!

827
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,337
Killer Frost.

828
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:30,540
She was part of you even then.

829
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:32,809
The particle accelerator
hadn't exploded.

830
00:37:34,813 --> 00:37:36,566
How is that possible?

831
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,035
_

832
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,434
Empty.

833
00:37:46,437 --> 00:37:48,291
But this is their first place together.

834
00:37:48,293 --> 00:37:50,627
She would come here. I can feel it.

835
00:37:52,964 --> 00:37:55,365
The pot's still warm.

836
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:57,333
That means...

837
00:37:57,335 --> 00:37:59,669
- We can have tea.
- No!

838
00:37:59,671 --> 00:38:01,971
- Marlize!
- Iris, she's not here.

839
00:38:01,973 --> 00:38:03,652
- Come out.
- Iris.

840
00:38:04,644 --> 00:38:07,509
It's rude to breach into
a person's home uninvited.

841
00:38:07,512 --> 00:38:09,212
And dangerous when
that person is holding

842
00:38:09,214 --> 00:38:11,447
a grudge and a katana.

843
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:14,050
Why are you here?

844
00:38:14,052 --> 00:38:15,585
I got this.

845
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:17,854
We're here, Marlize...

846
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:21,958
we're here because you...

847
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,227
because...

848
00:38:24,229 --> 00:38:25,995
Wait, uh, you...

849
00:38:25,997 --> 00:38:27,664
You have... You... you've...

850
00:38:29,543 --> 00:38:31,400
- I can't. I can't.
- He can't verbalize it.

851
00:38:31,403 --> 00:38:33,503
Not anymore. Just like we hypothesized

852
00:38:33,505 --> 00:38:35,338
but never observed before.

853
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,509
You're experiencing
the penultimate stages

854
00:38:38,512 --> 00:38:40,710
of the Enlightenment.

855
00:38:40,712 --> 00:38:42,312
You mind is being rebooted.

856
00:38:42,314 --> 00:38:44,447
Soon you will be without memories,

857
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:46,149
without relationships.

858
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:48,017
Just a blank slate so that Clifford

859
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:49,686
may re-educate you.

860
00:38:52,241 --> 00:38:53,907
Soon we'll all be just like you.

861
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:57,093
Marlize, we have to stop him.

862
00:38:57,095 --> 00:38:59,579
Your husband has gone too
far, and I think you know it,

863
00:38:59,582 --> 00:39:01,130
or you'd be with him right now.

864
00:39:01,132 --> 00:39:02,899
Yes, I left my husband.

865
00:39:02,901 --> 00:39:04,300
But that doesn't change the fact

866
00:39:04,302 --> 00:39:05,702
that he's right.

867
00:39:05,704 --> 00:39:09,005
If anything, his betrayal
proves his very point.

868
00:39:09,007 --> 00:39:12,709
Man corrupts even the best of ideas.

869
00:39:12,711 --> 00:39:15,245
Pessimism...

870
00:39:15,247 --> 00:39:17,914
isn't smarter than optimism.

871
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:20,845
In this life the
bravest thing you can be

872
00:39:20,848 --> 00:39:22,619
is optimistic.

873
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:24,120
Familiar words.

874
00:39:24,122 --> 00:39:26,322
You said them when you were at Oxford.

875
00:39:26,324 --> 00:39:29,058
Two weeks before you met Clifford DeVoe.

876
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,594
I gave a speech

877
00:39:31,596 --> 00:39:34,264
on technology and the
elimination of world hunger.

878
00:39:34,266 --> 00:39:36,332
I truly believed it could be done.

879
00:39:36,334 --> 00:39:38,485
He tried to change you, Marlize.

880
00:39:38,488 --> 00:39:42,805
But I think deep down,
you are still an optimist.

881
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:46,876
You still believe in humanity.

882
00:39:46,878 --> 00:39:49,512
And I believe in you.

883
00:39:49,514 --> 00:39:51,907
You asked me what I was willing to do

884
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,216
for my husband.

885
00:39:53,218 --> 00:39:56,085
And now I'm gonna ask you.

886
00:39:56,087 --> 00:39:59,355
What are you willing
to do for the world?

887
00:40:07,432 --> 00:40:09,532
Barry shot down one of his satellites.

888
00:40:09,534 --> 00:40:11,000
He did...

889
00:40:11,002 --> 00:40:12,368
DeVoe didn't seem to care.

890
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,923
I'll try and see if I can track it.

891
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,359
I don't like that sound.

892
00:40:17,362 --> 00:40:20,476
This says a Star Lab
satellite's been activated.

893
00:40:20,478 --> 00:40:22,445
- It's DeVoe.
- He's using our satellite

894
00:40:22,447 --> 00:40:23,913
to replace the one you destroyed.

895
00:40:23,915 --> 00:40:25,214
Well, can you stop him?

896
00:40:30,188 --> 00:40:31,957
He's here.

897
00:40:33,658 --> 00:40:36,059
Hello, professor DeVoe.

898
00:40:36,817 --> 00:40:38,310
No, no, no.

899
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:39,604
Come on.

900
00:40:44,603 --> 00:40:46,103
DeVoe!

901
00:40:46,106 --> 00:40:48,671
DeVoe!

902
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:52,095
DeVoe!

903
00:40:52,098 --> 00:40:54,493
Initiating Enlightenment protocol.

904
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:57,146
Let there be light.

905
00:41:03,021 --> 00:41:05,688
- He did it.
- The Enlightenment.

906
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:08,958
What are we gonna do?

907
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,582
I don't know.

908
00:41:11,729 --> 00:41:15,564
God saw... it was good.

909
00:41:21,903 --> 00:41:25,865
