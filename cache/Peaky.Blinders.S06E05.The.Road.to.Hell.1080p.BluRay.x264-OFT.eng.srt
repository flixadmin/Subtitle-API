1
00:00:01,004 --> 00:00:02,684
<i>A daughter lost.</i>

2
00:00:02,804 --> 00:00:04,804
A son found. He is yours.

3
00:00:04,924 --> 00:00:06,644
Evadne Barwell?

4
00:00:09,044 --> 00:00:10,964
<i>Since you have proven
your commitment,</i>

5
00:00:11,084 --> 00:00:12,364
<i>Boston is now officially open</i>

6
00:00:12,484 --> 00:00:15,084
for the importation
of your merchandise.

7
00:00:15,204 --> 00:00:18,164
Jack says just a few more weeks
and you'll be free.

8
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,244
Stories about you
come up the canal.

9
00:00:20,364 --> 00:00:22,004
<i>Once you walked fine alone,</i>

10
00:00:22,124 --> 00:00:24,364
<i>now you need a stick.</i>

11
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:25,580
<i>You stay clean for two weeks,</i>

12
00:00:25,604 --> 00:00:27,524
I'll write Linda another letter.

13
00:00:27,644 --> 00:00:29,244
<i>Have you recently
suffered seizures?</i>

14
00:00:29,364 --> 00:00:32,964
It is tuberculoma.
I am afraid it is inoperable.

15
00:01:55,284 --> 00:01:56,844
Mr Shelby.

16
00:01:56,964 --> 00:01:58,964
I only gave opium
to your brother

17
00:01:59,084 --> 00:02:01,004
because he give me big trouble.

18
00:02:01,124 --> 00:02:02,764
He attacked my wife.

19
00:02:10,724 --> 00:02:13,604
I'd like a pot of green tea,
please.

20
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:27,444
It's taken me ten years
to build this business.

21
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,124
Business will be safe,
if you do what I say.

22
00:02:33,884 --> 00:02:35,844
How much opium do you have
in your cellar?

23
00:02:37,604 --> 00:02:38,644
Five pounds.

24
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:41,084
Bring it to me.

25
00:02:42,484 --> 00:02:44,724
Four minutes, against the clock.

26
00:03:17,124 --> 00:03:18,764
As a Member of Parliament...

27
00:03:21,484 --> 00:03:23,204
...for this constituency...

28
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,404
...it is my duty

29
00:03:25,484 --> 00:03:27,164
to take responsibility
for the welfare...

30
00:03:27,284 --> 00:03:28,300
- Mr Shelby!
- ...of my constituents.

31
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:29,844
The clock is still ticking.

32
00:03:29,964 --> 00:03:32,924
The consumption of opium
is very prejudicial to health.

33
00:03:33,044 --> 00:03:36,284
Women give it to their children
so they can leave them untended

34
00:03:36,404 --> 00:03:37,844
while they work
in the factories.

35
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:40,844
Men lose their jobs
when they become addicted.

36
00:03:42,484 --> 00:03:48,964
From now on, you will sell
only cigarettes, cake and tea.

37
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,564
If I hear that you're selling
opium again, time will indeed

38
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:55,564
run out very quickly for you.
Do you understand?

39
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:58,004
Yes, I understand, I will stop.

40
00:03:58,124 --> 00:04:00,204
Mr Shelby,
the clock is still ticking.

41
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,404
Please tell...

42
00:04:09,964 --> 00:04:12,764
...your suppliers
and your customers...

43
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:15,524
...that from now on...

44
00:04:15,644 --> 00:04:18,804
...there will be no more opium

45
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:22,164
in Small Heath or in Bordesley.

46
00:04:23,404 --> 00:04:25,044
Thank you for the tea.

47
00:05:03,124 --> 00:05:06,284
- You can let them through now.
- Yes, sir, Mr Shelby.

48
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:10,044
You tell the pub and cafe owners

49
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:11,404
in Montague Street...

50
00:05:12,404 --> 00:05:14,164
...if there's any further trade
in powder,

51
00:05:14,284 --> 00:05:16,004
there will be no more
Montague Street.

52
00:05:16,124 --> 00:05:18,204
I'll have it demolished
and replaced by apartments,

53
00:05:18,324 --> 00:05:21,044
by order of the Birmingham
Urban District Council.

54
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:38,924
Sorry I'm late,
they closed Montague Street.

55
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:41,244
There's a gas explosion or...

56
00:05:44,884 --> 00:05:47,764
Right, well, it would be nice
if just one thing

57
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:50,724
could happen in Birmingham
that wasn't our fault.

58
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:57,764
I've gathered you all here
today because there is news,

59
00:05:57,884 --> 00:06:00,524
and it's of interest
to the whole family.

60
00:06:01,764 --> 00:06:02,844
First of all,

61
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:08,204
I'd like to welcome
Finn's new wife, Mary,

62
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:09,964
<i>to</i> the family.

63
00:06:10,084 --> 00:06:11,844
Right, well, I'm very glad

64
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:13,684
that I dragged myself
out of bed for this.

65
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:16,644
There is...

66
00:06:16,764 --> 00:06:18,684
...one more item of business.

67
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:21,204
- Johnny.
- Tom.

68
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:24,284
Come on, come on.

69
00:06:24,404 --> 00:06:25,604
Hurry up.

70
00:06:31,364 --> 00:06:33,044
Everyone...

71
00:06:34,964 --> 00:06:37,044
...this here is Erasmus.

72
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,324
Nobody calls me that.

73
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,244
They call him Duke.

74
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:47,884
20 years ago,
at Appleby Horse Fair...

75
00:06:48,964 --> 00:06:49,964
...I met a girl.

76
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:51,924
We shared the shade
of a hazel tree.

77
00:06:53,444 --> 00:06:56,564
Nine months later,
this lad was born.

78
00:06:59,364 --> 00:07:00,964
This is my son.

79
00:07:01,084 --> 00:07:04,004
His mother died on the road.

80
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,884
Up until now,
never tried to find him.

81
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:10,564
But I'm trying to look at life
in a different way.

82
00:07:12,404 --> 00:07:14,124
A child is a precious thing.

83
00:07:16,964 --> 00:07:18,084
So I'm bringing him...

84
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,484
Into the fucking family
with a snap of his fingers.

85
00:07:20,604 --> 00:07:23,844
No, I am bringing him
into the fold.

86
00:07:23,964 --> 00:07:26,044
He'll have to earn membership
of the family.

87
00:07:27,164 --> 00:07:30,364
For the moment, welcome, son.
You have a seat. Go on.

88
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:31,764
Sit down here.

89
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,724
There are some mistakes
I've made...

90
00:07:40,804 --> 00:07:42,004
...that I can never address...

91
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:44,204
...and some I can.

92
00:07:45,484 --> 00:07:47,284
Some wounds I can try to heal.

93
00:07:47,404 --> 00:07:50,044
And new wounds you can open up.

94
00:07:50,164 --> 00:07:51,724
Anyway...

95
00:07:53,444 --> 00:07:54,500
...that's the business
of the day.

96
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:57,604
Is it too early for whiskey?

97
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:05,684
There you go.

98
00:08:06,884 --> 00:08:08,604
Shelby breakfast for you, son.

99
00:08:08,724 --> 00:08:10,324
I don't drink.

100
00:08:11,564 --> 00:08:14,124
And I'm not a Shelby,
all right? I'm a Duke.

101
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:18,084
You're a fucking
Shelby, all right.

102
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:19,564
Don't worry about that.

103
00:08:20,724 --> 00:08:23,444
Mm, I think we'll need Curly

104
00:08:23,564 --> 00:08:26,004
and a strong rope
to break this one in, Tom.

105
00:08:26,124 --> 00:08:27,844
Arthur, open up the shop,

106
00:08:27,964 --> 00:08:29,404
put the kid here
on the blackboard,

107
00:08:29,524 --> 00:08:30,644
writing up the odds.

108
00:08:30,764 --> 00:08:32,444
I can't write.

109
00:08:33,644 --> 00:08:36,244
Put the kid on the blackboard,
wiping off the chalk.

110
00:08:38,924 --> 00:08:40,004
Go on, son.

111
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:41,804
Come on, then.

112
00:09:00,284 --> 00:09:01,444
Lizzie...

113
00:09:02,724 --> 00:09:03,764
...come on.

114
00:09:09,524 --> 00:09:12,164
My father was
the Duke of the Saxon Shore.

115
00:09:12,284 --> 00:09:14,004
My mother was a Romany queen.

116
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:15,764
Who told you that, your mum?

117
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:19,484
I don't allow people to talk
about my mother.

118
00:09:21,804 --> 00:09:23,364
Good for you.

119
00:09:23,484 --> 00:09:25,044
So let's get this right, then.

120
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,404
You can't read,
you can't fucking write.

121
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:28,524
Nothing wrong with that.

122
00:09:28,604 --> 00:09:30,924
What can you do, eh?

123
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:32,804
I can tell the time.

124
00:09:32,924 --> 00:09:34,084
Tell the time.

125
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:36,204
Here, he can tell the time.

126
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:37,964
Ain't that clever?!

127
00:09:39,364 --> 00:09:41,364
It's a lot more
than what you can fucking do.

128
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,004
What did you just say to me?

129
00:09:47,604 --> 00:09:49,164
What time is it, Mr Shelby?

130
00:09:53,444 --> 00:09:54,764
That's what I can do.

131
00:09:55,764 --> 00:09:57,524
You little bastard.

132
00:09:58,524 --> 00:10:01,164
Here, keep it.

133
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:03,644
Stop you from being late
in the future.

134
00:10:31,604 --> 00:10:33,484
Is there forgiveness
in your heart

135
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:34,964
for Arthur Shelby?

136
00:10:36,164 --> 00:10:37,644
No.

137
00:10:40,884 --> 00:10:43,124
But there may be forgiveness
from God.

138
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:47,644
And you will do God's work?

139
00:10:47,764 --> 00:10:51,084
God is interested in you
as well, Tommy.

140
00:10:51,204 --> 00:10:53,044
And God will be with you
on your journey,

141
00:10:53,164 --> 00:10:54,244
every step of the way.

142
00:10:58,484 --> 00:11:01,244
He may not need to take
many steps.

143
00:11:14,844 --> 00:11:16,284
So, tell me this, Linda...

144
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:20,284
...is God interested in me...

145
00:11:21,444 --> 00:11:23,284
...or in my money?

146
00:11:27,764 --> 00:11:29,444
I believe you run a foundation,

147
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:32,804
and that your foundation has
many missions across the world,

148
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:35,364
but in these times
of financial crisis,

149
00:11:35,484 --> 00:11:38,364
funding is hard to come by,
so perhaps...

150
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:41,044
...your God's plan
is a practical one.

151
00:11:41,164 --> 00:11:44,364
Perhaps, He would like me
to make a donation

152
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:46,044
to your foundation

153
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,444
and, in return,
He would like you

154
00:11:49,564 --> 00:11:52,244
to help my brother on his road
to redemption.

155
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:56,124
Now, I know that in a place
of worship such as this,

156
00:11:56,244 --> 00:11:57,844
you would never ask how much.

157
00:11:57,964 --> 00:11:59,724
So I will tell you plainly.

158
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:04,124
I will write your foundation
a cheque for £10,000...

159
00:12:04,244 --> 00:12:05,404
Praise the Lord.

160
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:08,884
...if you agree to look kindly
on Arthur and to help him.

161
00:12:12,044 --> 00:12:14,084
I need to look after everyone
in the family.

162
00:12:16,844 --> 00:12:18,084
Do we have a deal?

163
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:23,804
Your money will be spent
to do good around the world...

164
00:12:25,524 --> 00:12:27,124
...and a mission will be named
after you.

165
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,404
But I'm only agreeing
to help him...

166
00:12:33,564 --> 00:12:34,764
...not sleep with him.

167
00:12:35,884 --> 00:12:37,364
No.

168
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:40,924
No, I imagine the negotiation
for that particular favour

169
00:12:41,044 --> 00:12:43,284
would take a considerable
amount of time...

170
00:12:44,644 --> 00:12:45,924
...and I have an appointment.

171
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:49,764
God bless.

172
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:14,844
Apologies for
the initial misunderstanding.

173
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:18,204
My brother dealt with it.

174
00:13:25,244 --> 00:13:26,684
For the care you took.

175
00:13:28,084 --> 00:13:30,884
Even though
I succumbed to temptation?

176
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:34,124
Part of the reason my brother
is back dealing with it

177
00:13:34,244 --> 00:13:35,844
is down to you.

178
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:37,284
You spoke to him.

179
00:13:37,404 --> 00:13:38,604
As a comrade.

180
00:13:38,724 --> 00:13:40,204
The beating
is still owed to you.

181
00:13:40,324 --> 00:13:42,084
Do you still do that kind
of work yourself,

182
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:43,724
Thomas Shelby, MP?

183
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:48,804
Mr Stagg, you see,
I can use men like you.

184
00:13:50,884 --> 00:13:54,404
I have friends
that are in need of guns.

185
00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:59,444
Soon, there will be a shipment
of Thompson sub-machine guns

186
00:13:59,564 --> 00:14:02,124
coming here from Boston.

187
00:14:02,244 --> 00:14:05,204
And I need you to unload
and store those weapons.

188
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:09,484
There will also be ammunition...

189
00:14:10,924 --> 00:14:12,084
...like this.

190
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:14,524
You have a good look.

191
00:14:15,644 --> 00:14:17,764
And I need you
to take better care

192
00:14:17,884 --> 00:14:19,644
of the guns and ammunition

193
00:14:19,764 --> 00:14:21,324
than you did of the powder.

194
00:14:22,604 --> 00:14:23,604
You understand?

195
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:26,644
Previously,

196
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:31,124
all of my import and export
went through Belfast docks.

197
00:14:31,244 --> 00:14:33,084
Now we're dealing with Boston...

198
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:39,804
...I'm considering shifting
my supply line to Liverpool.

199
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:42,444
You'll be a very rich man.

200
00:14:46,404 --> 00:14:48,364
Don't you ever say thank you?

201
00:15:06,284 --> 00:15:07,564
Thank you.

202
00:15:12,484 --> 00:15:14,684
Is that why you do it,
Mr Shelby?

203
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,324
Is that why you keep
all this going?

204
00:15:18,444 --> 00:15:20,444
To have people say thank you?

205
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,044
You could close all this down.

206
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:26,444
You could leave the sport
behind.

207
00:15:26,564 --> 00:15:29,524
You could live like
an ordinary mortal man.

208
00:15:29,644 --> 00:15:32,164
On your gravestone -

209
00:15:32,284 --> 00:15:34,044
"an ordinary mortal man".

210
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,284
But, instead,

211
00:15:37,404 --> 00:15:40,884
you still go round collecting
"please" and "thank you"

212
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:44,084
and "sorry"
and "forgive me, Mr Shelby".

213
00:15:45,964 --> 00:15:47,364
That what it's all for?

214
00:15:50,204 --> 00:15:51,244
You want to know?

215
00:15:52,684 --> 00:15:54,204
You want to know
why I've carried on...

216
00:15:55,724 --> 00:15:57,604
...all these years?

217
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:00,284
It's so I can do this.

218
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,644
And then...

219
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:09,164
...do this.

220
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,084
Feel it?

221
00:16:17,004 --> 00:16:18,324
I feel it.

222
00:16:21,044 --> 00:16:22,484
Junk doesn't even come close.

223
00:16:26,964 --> 00:16:28,284
Soon, Mr Stagg...

224
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:32,484
...when my last bit of business
is done...

225
00:16:34,804 --> 00:16:36,124
...I will indeed...

226
00:16:37,724 --> 00:16:39,444
...be an ordinary mortal man.

227
00:16:42,564 --> 00:16:43,764
You have a good day.

228
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:54,244
Arthur, we've got a problem
with a referee.

229
00:16:54,364 --> 00:16:55,764
He's not taking the money.

230
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:57,484
He's fucking religious
or something.

231
00:16:57,604 --> 00:16:59,364
Jesus Christ.

232
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:04,484
With Tommy away, you're in
charge of gambling, Arthur,

233
00:17:04,604 --> 00:17:05,684
what shall we do?

234
00:17:06,924 --> 00:17:08,804
"And this they said to him,

235
00:17:08,924 --> 00:17:12,484
"that they may have some charge
to bring against him."

236
00:17:12,604 --> 00:17:13,844
Arthur, this referee,

237
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:16,284
he's threatening
to go to the police...

238
00:17:16,404 --> 00:17:17,404
"Jesus...

239
00:17:18,444 --> 00:17:20,164
"...bent down,

240
00:17:20,284 --> 00:17:23,444
"and with one finger,
he wrote on the ground..."

241
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:25,724
Arthur... brother...

242
00:17:27,724 --> 00:17:29,524
...people are laughing at you.

243
00:17:32,564 --> 00:17:35,484
So I just phoned
our holy referee again.

244
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:38,884
He basically told me
to fuck off.

245
00:17:39,004 --> 00:17:40,404
Not even basically, actually.

246
00:17:40,524 --> 00:17:42,124
He literally just told me to...

247
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:44,124
- ...to fuck off.
- Is that right?

248
00:17:44,244 --> 00:17:46,764
So, do you know?

249
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:48,364
Oh, for fuck's sake.

250
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,284
Do you know what he wrote
on the ground?

251
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:51,404
- Hmm?
- No.

252
00:17:51,484 --> 00:17:52,484
- Do you know?
- No.

253
00:17:52,524 --> 00:17:54,020
- You don't know, do you?
- No, I don't.

254
00:17:54,044 --> 00:17:55,884
Billy, do you know
what he wrote on the ground?

255
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:57,204
- I...
- Hmm?

256
00:17:58,364 --> 00:18:00,124
Do you know what Jesus wrote
on the ground?

257
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:01,724
He bent down,

258
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:04,844
and with one finger,
he wrote on the fucking ground.

259
00:18:04,964 --> 00:18:06,964
Do you know?
Do you know what he wrote?

260
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:09,204
- Come on, Billy.
- No.

261
00:18:09,324 --> 00:18:11,524
Arthur, what should we do?

262
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:14,444
Go and get me the referee.

263
00:18:14,564 --> 00:18:17,244
Bring me the fucking referee.

264
00:19:26,604 --> 00:19:28,044
I know she's here with us.

265
00:19:31,324 --> 00:19:32,444
Always.

266
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,964
But still, it's just you and me.

267
00:19:48,444 --> 00:19:49,764
I thought it'd be good

268
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:51,524
if we were in a different place.

269
00:19:54,124 --> 00:19:55,404
I hate that house now.

270
00:19:56,684 --> 00:19:58,324
I wish I could blow it up.

271
00:20:08,844 --> 00:20:11,364
There was a time when we'd say
nothing afterwards

272
00:20:11,484 --> 00:20:14,364
because we didn't have
to say anything.

273
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:20,524
Now we've got nothing left
to say.

274
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,204
There's business.

275
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,684
What business?

276
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:37,764
The American.

277
00:20:39,644 --> 00:20:41,164
He's coming to Birmingham.

278
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,404
He's stopping over
on his way to Liverpool.

279
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:47,964
He's staying with us
tomorrow night.

280
00:20:48,084 --> 00:20:49,244
Frances knows.

281
00:20:49,364 --> 00:20:50,844
She's been making up a menu.

282
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:56,004
And then...

283
00:20:57,684 --> 00:20:59,124
...we have to make a move.

284
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,804
Do you want to know
what that move is, Lizzie?

285
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:08,724
No.

286
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:12,284
I know enough.

287
00:21:16,364 --> 00:21:18,244
Your book of regrets.

288
00:21:23,004 --> 00:21:24,604
23, 24...

289
00:21:25,724 --> 00:21:27,124
...52, 55.

290
00:21:29,484 --> 00:21:31,364
The combination to the safe.

291
00:21:35,164 --> 00:21:36,364
Regrets.

292
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,004
And I'm on there.

293
00:21:40,084 --> 00:21:41,084
I'm on the list.

294
00:21:42,204 --> 00:21:45,164
On the very top of the list.

295
00:21:50,804 --> 00:21:51,884
Yep.

296
00:21:53,164 --> 00:21:54,484
Yes, you are.

297
00:21:58,044 --> 00:21:59,804
I regret marrying you, Lizzie.

298
00:22:03,524 --> 00:22:05,324
Cos I've put you through
so much.

299
00:22:06,764 --> 00:22:07,884
Put you through all of this.

300
00:22:09,484 --> 00:22:10,484
Ruby.

301
00:22:12,524 --> 00:22:14,124
Everything that is to come.

302
00:22:17,684 --> 00:22:18,764
When you married me,

303
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:21,244
you married a man
and you married a curse.

304
00:22:22,404 --> 00:22:23,924
You have shared my fate.

305
00:22:27,404 --> 00:22:28,924
That is my regret.

306
00:22:33,444 --> 00:22:34,604
But know this, Lizzie.

307
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,204
In this moment,

308
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:39,724
in this room...

309
00:22:42,364 --> 00:22:43,604
...I love you.

310
00:22:51,324 --> 00:22:53,804
You sound like
you're ticking a fucking box,

311
00:22:53,924 --> 00:22:56,204
and I don't know
what's inside the box!

312
00:22:59,764 --> 00:23:02,924
Never have you let me in...

313
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:08,244
...even though I know
the combination to the safe.

314
00:23:48,244 --> 00:23:49,284
So this is him, is it?

315
00:23:49,404 --> 00:23:53,204
The one who likes
to be fucking difficult, eh?

316
00:23:53,324 --> 00:23:54,324
When I leave this place,

317
00:23:54,444 --> 00:23:55,884
I'm going straight
to the police.

318
00:23:56,004 --> 00:23:57,724
- You are?
- This man pointed a gun at me.

319
00:23:57,844 --> 00:24:00,524
- Who, him there?
- Yeah.

320
00:24:02,164 --> 00:24:04,484
Well, let's phone the police,
eh?

321
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:07,684
Don't worry.

322
00:24:07,804 --> 00:24:09,020
We'll have this sorted out
for you.

323
00:24:09,044 --> 00:24:10,044
Hello?

324
00:24:10,164 --> 00:24:12,484
Yes, get me the police.

325
00:24:12,604 --> 00:24:15,044
Reports of a man
with a revolver on Watery Lane.

326
00:24:15,164 --> 00:24:16,964
There you go.

327
00:24:17,084 --> 00:24:19,644
And you ask for Inspector Moss.

328
00:24:19,764 --> 00:24:24,604
Chief Superintendent Moss.

329
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:29,204
He's in charge of Watery Lane
and Bordesley Green.

330
00:24:29,324 --> 00:24:30,964
That's right.

331
00:24:31,084 --> 00:24:32,244
And you see this?

332
00:24:34,924 --> 00:24:37,004
That's his betting credit
with us.

333
00:24:38,284 --> 00:24:42,044
He makes a lot of money
from football matches...

334
00:24:43,084 --> 00:24:46,764
...because we give him
the results before the match.

335
00:24:56,804 --> 00:24:58,484
On Saturday afternoon,

336
00:24:58,604 --> 00:25:00,924
you take this whistle,
and you blow.

337
00:25:01,044 --> 00:25:02,844
You give a penalty
to Birmingham City

338
00:25:02,964 --> 00:25:04,124
in the final minute.

339
00:25:04,244 --> 00:25:06,604
The goalkeeper will let
the penalty go by him,

340
00:25:06,724 --> 00:25:09,484
and Birmingham City will win
1 -0.

341
00:25:09,604 --> 00:25:11,684
All you got to do is...

342
00:25:19,244 --> 00:25:20,244
No.

343
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:22,964
I won't do it.

344
00:25:23,084 --> 00:25:26,004
If the police won't listen,
I'll go to the newspapers.

345
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,204
I'm not afraid.

346
00:25:30,564 --> 00:25:32,244
I was in France.

347
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,844
Phone Tommy, Arthur.

348
00:25:34,924 --> 00:25:35,924
You shut up.

349
00:25:35,964 --> 00:25:39,124
I'm not phoning fucking Tommy.

350
00:25:39,244 --> 00:25:40,764
I am dealing with this, OK?

351
00:25:40,884 --> 00:25:43,244
- I'm leaving.
- You're going fucking nowhere.

352
00:25:43,364 --> 00:25:45,884
It's time one of us stood up
to you people.

353
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,844
It's not right
what's been happening.

354
00:25:49,164 --> 00:25:51,884
I will not take money to cheat.

355
00:25:52,004 --> 00:25:53,404
Fucking hell.

356
00:25:53,524 --> 00:25:55,564
In France, I ran at the wire...

357
00:25:56,844 --> 00:25:58,444
...and I was not afraid.

358
00:26:00,564 --> 00:26:02,124
I am not afraid.

359
00:26:03,204 --> 00:26:04,444
I won't do a bad thing.

360
00:26:05,484 --> 00:26:07,484
I've seen too many bad things.

361
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:11,364
A beating will make
no difference.

362
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:17,004
I know that, cos I can see it
in your fucking eyes.

363
00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:19,004
Fuck him.

364
00:26:20,244 --> 00:26:22,284
"In the bleak midwinter..."

365
00:26:22,404 --> 00:26:23,684
Holy Mary, mother of God.

366
00:26:24,964 --> 00:26:27,564
- Agh!
- Right, Billy Boy.

367
00:26:27,684 --> 00:26:29,204
You've been in the family
long enough.

368
00:26:29,324 --> 00:26:30,404
- No...
- Yeah.

369
00:26:30,524 --> 00:26:31,644
It's time for you

370
00:26:31,764 --> 00:26:33,284
<i>- to</i> get bloodied.
- Arthur, you can't.

371
00:26:33,404 --> 00:26:34,404
Arthur, please...

372
00:26:34,524 --> 00:26:35,580
You've been with us long enough.

373
00:26:35,604 --> 00:26:37,604
Fuck, Arthur. Jesus Christ.

374
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:40,124
I can't be that man,
Arthur, please!

375
00:26:40,244 --> 00:26:43,524
Either two men die today,
Billy... or one.

376
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:44,684
You fucking decide.

377
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:49,484
- Hate him, Billy. Hate him.
- Please...

378
00:26:49,604 --> 00:26:50,700
Try. You don't know him, Billy.

379
00:26:50,724 --> 00:26:52,020
He's fucking laughing at you,
look.

380
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:53,764
Come on, hate him.

381
00:26:53,884 --> 00:26:56,244
Look him in the eyes, man.
Look him in the eyes.

382
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,380
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Look him in the eyes.

383
00:26:58,404 --> 00:27:01,444
I'm sorry... sorry.

384
00:27:15,484 --> 00:27:17,124
Enough. Enough, enough, enough.

385
00:27:19,044 --> 00:27:21,084
It's all right. Billy, Billy,
come on, come on.

386
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:27,404
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

387
00:27:29,124 --> 00:27:30,564
Look at you. Look...

388
00:27:31,764 --> 00:27:33,044
Look at you, look.

389
00:27:33,164 --> 00:27:34,244
Huh?

390
00:27:36,124 --> 00:27:38,244
You're bloodied now, Billy.

391
00:27:40,244 --> 00:27:41,524
You're bloodied now.

392
00:27:43,284 --> 00:27:45,564
You're not going to heaven
no more.

393
00:27:45,684 --> 00:27:47,364
They won't let you in.

394
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:54,404
Isiah,
you take him to the foundry.

395
00:27:54,524 --> 00:27:56,124
You ask for Mr Patches,
all right?

396
00:27:56,244 --> 00:27:58,484
You tell him we got some fuel
for the furnace.

397
00:29:28,084 --> 00:29:29,084
Who the fuck are you?

398
00:29:36,244 --> 00:29:37,964
- I hear...
- Please.

399
00:29:38,084 --> 00:29:41,004
...you're the informant
inside the Shelby organisation.

400
00:29:43,124 --> 00:29:44,644
And who the fuck I am...

401
00:29:45,764 --> 00:29:47,324
...is the man you now work for.

402
00:29:47,444 --> 00:29:49,364
Please, please.

403
00:29:49,484 --> 00:29:51,444
I have something
I need you to do,

404
00:29:51,564 --> 00:29:52,844
and I want to impress
upon you...

405
00:29:52,884 --> 00:29:54,044
<i>...to impress...</i>

406
00:29:54,164 --> 00:29:58,204
...upon you the seriousness
of my intent.

407
00:29:59,484 --> 00:30:00,604
Cos, you see, I used to do

408
00:30:00,724 --> 00:30:02,364
this kind of thing for a living.

409
00:30:03,764 --> 00:30:06,244
And sometimes I kind of miss it.

410
00:30:07,364 --> 00:30:09,644
Just like Mr Shelby,
I miss the...

411
00:30:09,764 --> 00:30:12,364
...the wave of electricity
you get under your scalp.

412
00:30:12,484 --> 00:30:15,964
I miss the taste like metal
on the tip of your tongue.

413
00:30:17,124 --> 00:30:18,804
I'm about to give you
an instruction.

414
00:30:18,924 --> 00:30:22,524
You do as I say, you stay a man.

415
00:30:22,644 --> 00:30:26,364
Fail, and I will send people
to serve your balls to you

416
00:30:26,484 --> 00:30:27,764
on a china plate.

417
00:30:30,844 --> 00:30:32,044
I'll do what you say.

418
00:30:33,764 --> 00:30:36,004
A decision's been taken.

419
00:30:36,124 --> 00:30:39,004
My associates are going
to take care of Tommy Shelby,

420
00:30:39,124 --> 00:30:43,044
and you are going to give us up
his brother, Arthur.

421
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:45,844
Do you understand?

422
00:30:45,964 --> 00:30:49,684
Yes! Yes! Fucking yes! Please!

423
00:30:53,964 --> 00:30:57,084
Only information leading
to the murder of Arthur Shelby

424
00:30:57,204 --> 00:30:59,404
will save you
from an Italian death.

425
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,364
Cos it was the Italians
that taught me that

426
00:31:02,484 --> 00:31:04,804
above God, above children,

427
00:31:04,924 --> 00:31:06,804
above his wife
and above his mother...

428
00:31:08,564 --> 00:31:10,724
...most of all,
a man loves his balls.

429
00:32:22,004 --> 00:32:23,284
Hello, Arthur.

430
00:32:34,764 --> 00:32:36,764
I think we should pray.

431
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:40,204
That's how we begin this.

432
00:32:41,284 --> 00:32:42,724
You'd like to pray?

433
00:32:42,844 --> 00:32:44,204
The prayer I've chosen

434
00:32:44,324 --> 00:32:46,644
is the Act of Contrition,
Version 2.

435
00:32:48,604 --> 00:32:50,604
So, you're Catholic now, Linda?

436
00:32:50,724 --> 00:32:53,524
You're Catholic.
Quakers don't pray.

437
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:58,764
Bow your head, Arthur,
and close your eyes.

438
00:33:00,924 --> 00:33:02,044
And recite the prayer.

439
00:33:02,164 --> 00:33:03,724
You know it well
from when you were boy.

440
00:33:03,844 --> 00:33:06,484
Oh, my mind's all dried up
with junk, though,

441
00:33:06,604 --> 00:33:08,204
and shot full of fuck...

442
00:33:08,324 --> 00:33:09,724
...shot full of holes.

443
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,204
Linda, please.

444
00:33:15,884 --> 00:33:18,724
It's in there somewhere,
Arthur. It's like a song.

445
00:33:18,844 --> 00:33:19,924
Yeah.

446
00:33:21,204 --> 00:33:22,364
Somewhere.

447
00:33:22,484 --> 00:33:23,924
Together, we'll find it.

448
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,644
Digging for the words
will help clean your soul.

449
00:33:28,244 --> 00:33:29,564
I'll begin it.

450
00:33:31,964 --> 00:33:35,244
Forgive me my sins, O, Lord,
forgive me my sins.

451
00:33:35,364 --> 00:33:37,204
The sins of my youth.

452
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:39,444
The sins of my youth,

453
00:33:39,564 --> 00:33:41,044
the sins of my age,

454
00:33:41,164 --> 00:33:42,404
the sins of my soul.

455
00:33:44,124 --> 00:33:46,004
The sins of my body.

456
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:50,164
The sins I know,
the sins I know not.

457
00:33:51,484 --> 00:33:53,724
The sins I have concealed
for so long.

458
00:33:53,844 --> 00:33:55,924
For so fu...

459
00:33:56,044 --> 00:33:57,284
For so long.

460
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,204
Caught him stealing a car,

461
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:22,284
and he's got a stack of cash
from the betting shop.

462
00:34:35,604 --> 00:34:37,684
Steal from who you want.

463
00:34:37,804 --> 00:34:38,924
But don't steal from me.

464
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:42,604
Here you are.

465
00:34:44,804 --> 00:34:46,444
Get a train

466
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:48,324
to wherever the fuck
you want to go. Get out.

467
00:34:48,444 --> 00:34:50,364
- I don't ride trains.
- That a fact?

468
00:34:53,484 --> 00:34:55,564
Well, Curly has
a two-wheeled wagon.

469
00:34:56,724 --> 00:34:58,004
What am I, a tinker?

470
00:34:58,124 --> 00:34:59,644
I need four wheels.

471
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,444
And a horse for the hills.

472
00:35:05,764 --> 00:35:07,724
Which hills?

473
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:10,564
All of them.
All the hills of England.

474
00:35:15,684 --> 00:35:16,684
Why do you want to leave?

475
00:35:21,124 --> 00:35:23,044
I didn't take to that work
in the betting shop.

476
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:28,404
Well, you heard him, Charlie.

477
00:35:29,604 --> 00:35:32,284
Get my dad's old four-wheeled
wagon and two strong ponies.

478
00:35:32,404 --> 00:35:33,524
Right.

479
00:35:34,604 --> 00:35:37,244
Curly! Get here.

480
00:35:42,804 --> 00:35:44,404
Before you go,

481
00:35:44,524 --> 00:35:46,524
do you want to know the truth
about yourself?

482
00:35:48,364 --> 00:35:50,484
No. Who does?

483
00:35:52,524 --> 00:35:53,964
Right, well,
I'm going to tell you.

484
00:35:55,084 --> 00:35:56,604
That spring at Appleby Fair,

485
00:35:56,724 --> 00:35:58,724
your mother stole
my watch and chain.

486
00:35:58,844 --> 00:36:00,524
You're from a long line
of thieves.

487
00:36:01,684 --> 00:36:05,724
The watch had the words
"Saxon Shore" carved in it.

488
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:08,364
Stole it meself from a drunk
when I was a kid.

489
00:36:09,844 --> 00:36:10,844
I imagine she told you

490
00:36:10,924 --> 00:36:13,364
your dad was the Duke
of the Saxon Shore. Well...

491
00:36:14,804 --> 00:36:16,364
...I'm the Duke,

492
00:36:16,484 --> 00:36:17,724
It was my watch.

493
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,004
I'm your father.

494
00:36:22,604 --> 00:36:23,604
That's the truth.

495
00:36:24,884 --> 00:36:25,964
When her dad found out,

496
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:28,644
he shot me in the chest
with a squirrel gun.

497
00:36:29,724 --> 00:36:34,524
A scar and a stolen watch
and a story she made up.

498
00:36:36,324 --> 00:36:38,004
That's all you need to know
about yourself

499
00:36:38,124 --> 00:36:39,604
before you get on the road.

500
00:36:52,404 --> 00:36:54,404
Esme tells me
the spirits favour you.

501
00:36:56,164 --> 00:36:57,924
That the spirit is in you.

502
00:36:58,044 --> 00:37:00,684
She tried to sell me like one
of those horses, didn't she?

503
00:37:01,764 --> 00:37:04,044
How much did she pay for me?

504
00:37:05,444 --> 00:37:06,804
I've no use for gold any more.

505
00:37:08,084 --> 00:37:09,444
But if you <i>are</i> a horse,

506
00:37:09,564 --> 00:37:11,044
you're in the right place.

507
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:13,764
Curly!

508
00:37:16,164 --> 00:37:17,644
Curly, hurry up!

509
00:37:18,684 --> 00:37:20,364
This boy has hills to climb.

510
00:37:23,484 --> 00:37:24,924
I remember that watch.

511
00:37:27,444 --> 00:37:28,964
Oh, yeah?

512
00:37:30,364 --> 00:37:32,084
She used to wear it
over her heart.

513
00:37:35,244 --> 00:37:37,124
We buried it with her.

514
00:37:39,964 --> 00:37:41,004
Tom.

515
00:37:41,124 --> 00:37:44,004
The old wagon's right
front wheel is fucked, Tom.

516
00:37:44,124 --> 00:37:45,404
It's standing in the wet.

517
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,004
Put a new wheel on, Curly.

518
00:37:51,084 --> 00:37:52,084
Yeah.

519
00:37:54,724 --> 00:37:56,164
Fix wagons here.

520
00:37:57,964 --> 00:38:00,524
Good families
come from the New Forest

521
00:38:00,644 --> 00:38:02,484
to get their wagons fixed

522
00:38:02,604 --> 00:38:04,804
and fresh horses
before the fairs.

523
00:38:08,084 --> 00:38:10,524
Yeah. Yeah, I like it here.

524
00:38:11,764 --> 00:38:13,444
I like it better than
that betting shop.

525
00:38:16,364 --> 00:38:17,364
Why?

526
00:38:18,564 --> 00:38:19,564
People.

527
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:21,884
People piss me off.

528
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:25,924
There are a lot of people
in that betting shop.

529
00:38:27,524 --> 00:38:29,804
So far, here... What?
I've only counted two.

530
00:38:29,924 --> 00:38:30,924
Mm-hm.

531
00:38:32,004 --> 00:38:33,164
Charlie and Curly.

532
00:38:33,284 --> 00:38:35,004
The rest is dogs and horses.

533
00:38:35,124 --> 00:38:36,804
Curly's half horse himself.

534
00:38:38,204 --> 00:38:39,444
Dogs are OK.

535
00:38:40,604 --> 00:38:42,524
Horses are better than people,
mind you.

536
00:38:45,844 --> 00:38:48,244
There's work here
for a man who knows horses.

537
00:38:51,724 --> 00:38:52,884
Unknown.

538
00:38:54,284 --> 00:38:56,564
I want to remain
completely unknown.

539
00:38:56,684 --> 00:38:57,684
Well, you'd be

540
00:38:57,724 --> 00:38:58,860
in the right place
for that as well.

541
00:38:58,884 --> 00:39:00,004
No-one knows anyone here.

542
00:39:02,404 --> 00:39:04,284
Hey, mister!
Save that wheel a minute.

543
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:07,644
Where would I stay?

544
00:39:09,364 --> 00:39:12,324
Stables,
with the other stallions.

545
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:15,244
Now that Finn is married off,

546
00:39:15,364 --> 00:39:17,244
plenty of girls round here.

547
00:39:17,364 --> 00:39:20,844
Fathers are mostly unarmed.

548
00:39:24,684 --> 00:39:27,044
I have a future for you, Duke.

549
00:39:28,524 --> 00:39:30,524
You already have a son.

550
00:39:31,884 --> 00:39:34,204
My business has two sides.

551
00:39:35,444 --> 00:39:36,764
Light and dark.

552
00:39:37,844 --> 00:39:39,764
I'll need someone for each.

553
00:39:40,804 --> 00:39:42,524
And I'm dark, am I?

554
00:39:44,004 --> 00:39:46,764
I've realised we don't get
to choose which one we are.

555
00:39:48,484 --> 00:39:49,644
Dark knows dark.

556
00:39:51,284 --> 00:39:53,604
And my affairs,
both light and dark...

557
00:39:54,884 --> 00:39:56,444
...will need settling soon.

558
00:39:58,364 --> 00:39:59,404
Curly!

559
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:03,804
Find a shovel for the Duke
of the Saxon Shore here.

560
00:40:03,924 --> 00:40:05,804
Get him shovelling shit.

561
00:40:07,124 --> 00:40:08,964
And put some petrol in the boat.

562
00:40:09,084 --> 00:40:11,084
I'm off to meet a lady
in Solihull.

563
00:40:50,844 --> 00:40:51,964
Take a look at her.

564
00:40:53,924 --> 00:40:56,404
Now imagine ten people
living on side.

565
00:40:58,444 --> 00:41:00,124
Step on. Have a look inside.

566
00:41:06,124 --> 00:41:09,004
I've had a response
from the Guinness Trust

567
00:41:09,124 --> 00:41:12,084
about building
charitable housing

568
00:41:12,204 --> 00:41:15,324
at two sites
along the canal network

569
00:41:15,444 --> 00:41:17,044
between London,

570
00:41:17,164 --> 00:41:18,804
Birmingham and Liverpool.

571
00:41:18,924 --> 00:41:22,644
This lock here would be
the one of the sites.

572
00:41:23,844 --> 00:41:26,964
I have the permission.
Just need the finance.

573
00:41:29,324 --> 00:41:31,444
I know that you and your
husband, Bryan Guinness,

574
00:41:31,564 --> 00:41:32,604
are estranged,

575
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:35,284
but I understand
you still have influence

576
00:41:35,404 --> 00:41:36,524
in the Guinness family.

577
00:41:37,644 --> 00:41:40,284
Your support might help them
make their decision.

578
00:41:40,404 --> 00:41:41,804
Will you help me?

579
00:41:51,444 --> 00:41:54,004
I've booked a suite in a hotel
a mile from here.

580
00:41:55,124 --> 00:41:56,804
My chauffeur will take us there.

581
00:41:58,764 --> 00:41:59,924
You look quite the thing

582
00:42:00,044 --> 00:42:02,724
dressed like that,
dressed like a working man.

583
00:42:02,844 --> 00:42:04,380
They'll probably show you
to the coalhouse

584
00:42:04,404 --> 00:42:06,244
to make your delivery.

585
00:42:06,364 --> 00:42:08,604
Yep, they probably will.

586
00:42:11,764 --> 00:42:13,764
Oswald has fucked your wife,

587
00:42:13,884 --> 00:42:16,484
so my suggestion is
about balance and proportion.

588
00:42:17,764 --> 00:42:18,964
It would be only fair.

589
00:42:22,404 --> 00:42:24,204
Can I assume...

590
00:42:25,404 --> 00:42:26,684
...I have your support?

591
00:42:30,844 --> 00:42:32,684
This isn't about
charitable housing -

592
00:42:32,804 --> 00:42:34,244
this is about changing
the world.

593
00:42:35,324 --> 00:42:37,204
It's about a different kind
of trust.

594
00:42:37,324 --> 00:42:39,244
Absolute trust.

595
00:42:40,604 --> 00:42:42,564
We have important work
ahead of us.

596
00:42:44,524 --> 00:42:46,484
It's much harder to lie
with your body

597
00:42:46,604 --> 00:42:47,804
than with your words.

598
00:42:49,284 --> 00:42:50,524
This, I have learnt.

599
00:42:58,644 --> 00:43:00,484
Mostly,
I do whatever I want to do.

600
00:43:01,764 --> 00:43:03,844
Sometimes,
I do things for the cause.

601
00:43:03,964 --> 00:43:05,924
In this case, it's both.

602
00:43:09,204 --> 00:43:10,284
Come.

603
00:43:36,884 --> 00:43:38,884
In the interests
of absolute clarity,

604
00:43:39,004 --> 00:43:40,484
that is simply

605
00:43:40,604 --> 00:43:43,124
the English aristocracy's way
of shaking hands.

606
00:43:46,764 --> 00:43:47,764
So...

607
00:43:48,884 --> 00:43:50,044
...welcome.

608
00:46:35,164 --> 00:46:36,524
<i>If you do this thing...</i>

609
00:46:38,364 --> 00:46:42,284
<i>...the possibility of war,
you have to consider.</i>

610
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:49,084
<i>It was the ambitions</i>

611
00:46:49,204 --> 00:46:51,404
<i>and strategies of one man
that caused this.</i>

612
00:46:54,964 --> 00:46:57,604
<i>There will be a war
in this family,</i>

613
00:46:57,724 --> 00:47:00,164
<i>and one of you will die.</i>

614
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:26,884
We need to leave early

615
00:47:27,004 --> 00:47:29,244
to catch the first train
to Liverpool, yes?

616
00:47:29,364 --> 00:47:30,924
Yep.

617
00:47:31,044 --> 00:47:33,084
So we eat early, finish early.

618
00:47:38,364 --> 00:47:40,204
You changed the combination
of the safe.

619
00:47:41,444 --> 00:47:42,524
Why?

620
00:47:43,764 --> 00:47:45,044
Have you got new secrets?

621
00:47:46,284 --> 00:47:48,164
With the new business at hand...

622
00:47:49,484 --> 00:47:50,644
...there are some things...

623
00:47:51,804 --> 00:47:53,204
...that I cannot share.

624
00:47:53,324 --> 00:47:55,484
What things?

625
00:48:00,764 --> 00:48:02,124
What are those tablets?

626
00:48:02,244 --> 00:48:03,764
Doctor gave them me.

627
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:05,484
Painkillers?

628
00:48:05,604 --> 00:48:07,804
- Yeah.
- What pain?

629
00:48:09,204 --> 00:48:11,684
Any pain that comes, Lizzie.

630
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:36,724
When you're ready, I want you
to tell me everything

631
00:48:36,844 --> 00:48:38,044
that's going on.

632
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,884
It's like the clock's
stopped ticking

633
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:45,084
and I'm waiting
for the bomb to explode.

634
00:48:49,364 --> 00:48:51,124
We're in that quiet minute.

635
00:48:57,484 --> 00:48:58,844
Tommy?

636
00:49:07,204 --> 00:49:09,684
That's where we live now.

637
00:49:11,204 --> 00:49:12,684
When I know everything...

638
00:49:14,804 --> 00:49:16,284
...I will tell you everything.

639
00:49:33,244 --> 00:49:35,084
Oh, no,
Gina's running wild, you see.

640
00:49:35,204 --> 00:49:37,884
Harrods, dope, amphetamines,
lords and ladies,

641
00:49:38,004 --> 00:49:40,004
you know, the whole
English aristocracy thing.

642
00:49:40,124 --> 00:49:42,404
Fuck wine - whiskey.

643
00:49:42,524 --> 00:49:44,284
Shelby, you having whiskey?

644
00:49:44,404 --> 00:49:46,364
- I'll stay on wine.
- Fuck wine, more whiskey.

645
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:50,004
I'm celebrating.
Celebration, you know.

646
00:49:50,124 --> 00:49:51,524
Getting off this fucking island.

647
00:49:51,644 --> 00:49:52,964
You see, the thing with England,

648
00:49:53,084 --> 00:49:55,524
the currency here,
it's not money.

649
00:49:55,644 --> 00:49:58,164
Nah, you got bored of money
a long time ago.

650
00:49:59,444 --> 00:50:00,884
Cos, you know,
anyone can have money,

651
00:50:01,004 --> 00:50:02,324
you can fucking...

652
00:50:04,764 --> 00:50:07,244
...you can fucking find money
in the mud.

653
00:50:07,364 --> 00:50:09,244
You can forge money.

654
00:50:09,364 --> 00:50:12,764
Mr Shelby, you can steal money,
am I right?

655
00:50:13,964 --> 00:50:15,204
The currency here...

656
00:50:16,204 --> 00:50:17,444
...it's blood.

657
00:50:19,724 --> 00:50:22,804
And Mr Shelby knows that
better than all of them.

658
00:50:22,924 --> 00:50:23,924
Blood here is like wine,

659
00:50:24,004 --> 00:50:25,564
like the vintage wine
in that bottle.

660
00:50:25,684 --> 00:50:28,084
It's the... It's the label,
it's the terroir,

661
00:50:28,204 --> 00:50:30,404
it's the grape
that makes the wine.

662
00:50:30,524 --> 00:50:32,244
Who fucking cares
about the glass around it?

663
00:50:32,324 --> 00:50:35,644
And you, my friend,
you're an American.

664
00:50:35,764 --> 00:50:37,604
You fucking...
...smash the glass,

665
00:50:37,724 --> 00:50:39,004
you spill the blood

666
00:50:39,124 --> 00:50:41,364
and you spend their currency
to get what you want.

667
00:50:42,484 --> 00:50:43,924
Am I right?

668
00:50:46,164 --> 00:50:48,004
When you come to America,

669
00:50:48,124 --> 00:50:50,524
I will show you things.

670
00:50:50,644 --> 00:50:52,324
You're going to America?

671
00:50:54,724 --> 00:50:58,244
To Canada, Lizzie, to collect
payment for the shipment.

672
00:50:58,364 --> 00:51:00,124
I need to do it myself.

673
00:51:01,284 --> 00:51:02,804
And who will be going with you?

674
00:51:02,924 --> 00:51:05,364
Michael will be there
to watch his back.

675
00:51:05,484 --> 00:51:08,004
Another journey, Tommy?

676
00:51:08,124 --> 00:51:10,324
$5 million, Mrs Shelby.

677
00:51:10,444 --> 00:51:12,484
It's worth a little cruise,
don't you think?

678
00:51:16,404 --> 00:51:18,044
You know whiskey does talk...

679
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:21,244
...Mr Nelson,
and sometimes whiskey is...

680
00:51:22,364 --> 00:51:23,884
...very eloquent.

681
00:51:25,444 --> 00:51:29,364
But $5 million, Mr Nelson...

682
00:51:31,444 --> 00:51:32,644
...that is a legacy.

683
00:51:34,604 --> 00:51:38,404
And when I come back,
I will know everything.

684
00:51:40,844 --> 00:51:45,964
I see myself so clearly
in you, Thomas Shelby.

685
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:50,444
You are a man with a bright
and glittering future.

686
00:51:54,284 --> 00:51:56,524
Mr Shelby, there's
a car coming up the drive.

687
00:51:56,644 --> 00:51:58,124
A Rolls-Royce.

688
00:51:58,244 --> 00:51:59,684
Were you expecting more guests?

689
00:52:01,764 --> 00:52:02,924
No.

690
00:52:10,404 --> 00:52:11,844
Excuse me.

691
00:52:19,604 --> 00:52:21,844
We were on our way
to my constituency in Smethwick

692
00:52:21,964 --> 00:52:23,684
and I heard our American friend

693
00:52:23,804 --> 00:52:26,164
was in Birmingham
and that he was coming here,

694
00:52:26,284 --> 00:52:29,804
so we came
to say one last farewell.

695
00:52:32,924 --> 00:52:35,484
Champagne.
We have much to celebrate.

696
00:52:43,684 --> 00:52:45,964
It isn't that I wasn't sure
Mr Shelby would give you

697
00:52:46,084 --> 00:52:47,124
an excellent send-off,

698
00:52:47,244 --> 00:52:52,124
I just felt, since telegrams
and wires and letters

699
00:52:52,244 --> 00:52:54,364
can so easily be intercepted,

700
00:52:54,484 --> 00:52:56,244
we might confirm
all that we've achieved

701
00:52:56,364 --> 00:52:57,724
during your visit

702
00:52:57,844 --> 00:52:59,204
over champagne.

703
00:53:00,364 --> 00:53:01,364
It is remarkable

704
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,844
how quickly our relationships
have developed.

705
00:53:03,964 --> 00:53:06,524
So many triangles in this room.

706
00:53:06,644 --> 00:53:09,964
Everyone except from Mr Nelson
is the point of a triangle.

707
00:53:10,964 --> 00:53:13,484
How am I part of a triangle?

708
00:53:13,604 --> 00:53:17,244
Mr Nelson,
you have all that you came for?

709
00:53:17,364 --> 00:53:19,924
I have confirmation
that the future of Europe

710
00:53:20,044 --> 00:53:22,564
is in the hands
of men like yourselves.

711
00:53:22,684 --> 00:53:27,484
And that urgent conversations
between Washington, Rome,

712
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:30,524
and of course Berlin
can now begin.

713
00:53:30,644 --> 00:53:34,364
A two-week visit that may have
changed the course of history.

714
00:53:35,644 --> 00:53:37,204
We all got what we wanted.

715
00:53:37,324 --> 00:53:38,684
Yes.

716
00:53:38,804 --> 00:53:40,324
And I got what I have wanted

717
00:53:40,444 --> 00:53:42,404
from the moment
I set eyes on it.

718
00:53:48,004 --> 00:53:50,924
Elizabeth,
you are a very lucky woman...

719
00:53:52,164 --> 00:53:55,844
...to have each day
what I have only sampled once.

720
00:54:19,004 --> 00:54:20,404
Forgive us, Mr Nelson,

721
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:22,124
that was a necessary bit
of housekeeping.

722
00:54:28,004 --> 00:54:29,084
Thomas...

723
00:54:30,884 --> 00:54:33,004
...we do so hate
to be indiscreet, but...

724
00:54:34,324 --> 00:54:36,044
...we have told you
many times,

725
00:54:36,164 --> 00:54:37,324
if you are to seek power

726
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:40,804
in these days of shiny magazines

727
00:54:40,924 --> 00:54:43,164
and society photographs,

728
00:54:43,284 --> 00:54:45,524
sooner or later,
you will have to find a spouse

729
00:54:45,644 --> 00:54:46,844
who's more suitable.

730
00:54:48,204 --> 00:54:50,084
A woman with Lizzie's past

731
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:52,764
and personal history
really isn't suitable.

732
00:54:55,284 --> 00:54:57,204
She doesn't deserve you,
Mr Shelby.

733
00:55:21,404 --> 00:55:22,964
You know, the thing is,
Mosley...

734
00:55:24,644 --> 00:55:25,764
...you're right.

735
00:55:29,004 --> 00:55:30,724
You're right,
she doesn't deserve me.

736
00:55:35,684 --> 00:55:37,124
She doesn't deserve what I am.

737
00:55:39,804 --> 00:55:42,324
She doesn't deserve
what I will become.

738
00:55:42,444 --> 00:55:44,044
What will you become?

739
00:55:45,124 --> 00:55:47,644
Truth is, I belong here,
at this table,

740
00:55:47,764 --> 00:55:49,684
with fuckers like you.

741
00:55:51,924 --> 00:55:53,324
She doesn't.

742
00:55:56,564 --> 00:55:58,844
For all I try to hide it...

743
00:56:00,604 --> 00:56:02,444
...I'm just one of you.

744
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,564
Could there be a sadder ending,
eh?

745
00:57:10,484 --> 00:57:11,964
I'm here on behalf
of your wife, Gina,

746
00:57:12,004 --> 00:57:13,324
and Jack Nelson.

747
00:57:13,444 --> 00:57:15,964
Mr Nelson's prepared
to get you out of here.

748
00:57:17,124 --> 00:57:19,684
But first he needs an answer
to a question.

749
00:57:21,484 --> 00:57:22,764
If the answer is yes...

750
00:57:24,364 --> 00:57:25,444
...you'll be released.

751
00:57:27,964 --> 00:57:29,124
If the answer is no...

752
00:57:30,444 --> 00:57:31,644
...you'll stay.

753
00:57:34,964 --> 00:57:36,444
I have consulted my mother.

754
00:57:37,604 --> 00:57:38,844
Your mother's dead.

755
00:57:41,484 --> 00:57:43,204
Nevertheless,
I have consulted her.

756
00:57:46,844 --> 00:57:47,844
And yes.

757
00:57:49,484 --> 00:57:50,564
When I'm released,

758
00:57:50,684 --> 00:57:52,724
it is my intention
to kill Tommy Shelby.
