00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,666
Mic testing 1 2 3...

2
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:55,291
OK

3
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:57,916
Women's day!

4
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:02,041
Rather than talking about ourselves,

5
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:04,916
let's welcome someone
who talks about us in his stories.

6
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,166
The most happening writer
in the country...

7
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,041
Mr. Amarendhar is with us.

8
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,916
Amar, the stage is all yours!

9
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,041
Hi Friends!

10
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,541
Hi Sir!

11
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,541
Didn’t expect this big a response!

12
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:24,666
Sir, we read all your books!

13
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:25,416
Thank you!

14
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:26,916
What’s your next book, sir?

15
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:27,916
I’m writing it...

16
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,166
Goddess Kali’s fury,
Goddess Sita’s calm...

17
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:33,541
come together for this age Satyabhama’s story.
Do you want to hear it?

18
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:34,666
Yes, sir!

I was in the library at that time.

I heard your voice and
went running to the auditorium.

Move!

50
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,416
Madam, catch hold of him!

51
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:14,916
Move!

52
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,291
You shouldn’t have let him go, madam.

53
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:20,916
Proxy!

54
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,041
Hi ma’am.

55
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:28,541
I’m sending his feed.

56
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,416
Sent it ma’am, take a look.

57
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,541
You want to file a complaint?

58
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:50,541
With whom?

59
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:51,791
With the police?
Or with your husband?

60
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:53,666
Okay!

61
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,041
Once this video goes viral,

62
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,791
your husband will
give the complaint.

63
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,916
It will cost you for that.

64
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,416
Forget about it...

65
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,666
Shall I put it out on the internet?

66
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:03,666
No?

67
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,416
OK then,
I’ll send you the scanner...

68
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:06,916
send me fifty thousand rupees.

69
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,041
Bro!

70
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:10,291
This MMTS train video will
fetch us One Lakh.

71
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,791
One Lakh, my foot!

72
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,416
Let’s squeeze two for this!

73
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,791
But there were police
in the train...

74
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:23,291
Hey!

75
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:23,916
Leave me.

76
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:26,791
Come on...move!

77
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:27,916
Move!

78
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:29,291
Leave me!

79
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:31,416
Move!

80
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:33,291
Hey!

81
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,041
Move!

82
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:34,416
My Lungi!

83
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:37,958
Come on...

84
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:38,333
Move!

85
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,666
All these rogues formed
a syndicate and,

86
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,666
were blackmailing girls
when we nabbed them.

87
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,666
And the credit goes to my SHE Teams.

88
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,166
Big round of applause for them!

89
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:23,541
And one more thing...

90
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:24,416
Girls!

91
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:25,791
SHE Safe App.

92
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:27,541
I installed it for myself.

93
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:30,791
You should do it too,
for your safety!

94
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:32,916
Your safety...

95
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:34,291
is our responsibility!

96
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,416
This is my promise to
all the women out there!

97
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,166
Thus, Satya became someone
whom all the girls could trust.

98
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:47,666
Coming to us,

99
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,041
our long relationship
reached a destination.

100
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,041
Hey Amar!

101
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:56,166
Where is Satya?

102
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,666
She’s coming, dude.
On the way.

103
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:58,666
Come on, have it!

104
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,166
Amar,

105
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,041
All the guests are here.

106
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:05,791
Satybhama is still not here?

107
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,541
You take care of the guests, dad.

108
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:08,666
She’ll be here soon.

109
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:09,541
Okay.

110
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:19,416
Hello, Amar!

111
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,416
Darling, where are you?

112
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,916
Remember our wedding is today?

113
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,666
Stop it, Amar. I’m coming.
Just two minutes.

114
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:25,916
Two minutes?

115
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:27,291
Satya, Come in!

116
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,041
Satya!

117
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,541
Amar, stay on the line for a minute.

118
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:30,041
OK.

119
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:31,541
Joseph sir, tell me.

120
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,041
We found the guys involved
with women trafficking.

121
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,541
But they are not revealing the location
of the girls in spite of thrashing them.

122
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:36,791
Take charge!

123
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,166
Tell me, you rogue!

124
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:41,041
Hey!

125
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:42,416
Start talking then!

126
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:46,666
Damn!

127
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:57,416
Heh!

128
00:08:58,666 --> 00:08:59,666
I didn’t budge for him, after all!

129
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:16,416
I’ll talk, ma’am!

130
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,291
I’ll tell the truth, ma’am!

131
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,916
Should’ve hit him
without the bangles, ma’am.

132
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,833
He did that without them, didn’t he?

133
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:54,958
Did he budge?

134
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,791
-: SATYABHAMA :-

135
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,416
I need to meet ACP Satyabhama ma’am.

136
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,166
Madam is a bit busy today.

137
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,291
You cannot meet her now.

138
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,916
I watched madam on the TV.

139
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,791
Can you please make it happen?

140
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,666
You gave all your details...
I’ll tell her.

141
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,166
Hima!

142
00:10:47,041 --> 00:10:47,541
What’s your name?

143
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,166
Haseena, madam.

144
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,041
What do you do, Haseena?

145
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:53,541
PeopleTech...

146
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:56,541
Haseena,

147
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:57,791
you need to talk.

148
00:10:59,541 --> 00:10:59,958
I’m an...

149
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:01,541
IT professional, ma’am.

150
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,166
Is he a colleague?

151
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:04,166
No.

152
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,041
Tattoo artist.

153
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,291
Love marriage?

154
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:13,416
We could take action
only if you speak up!

155
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:16,916
His name is Yedhu.

156
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:21,416
Last week, he brought home
a girl he met on Tinder.

157
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,291
Who’s that?

158
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:24,791
I couldn’t bear it.

159
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:25,916
Heh!

160
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,416
Get out of here!

161
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,791
I called for divorce,

162
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:31,291
but he keeps bringing her home.

163
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,916
He came today too.

164
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,541
When my brother...

165
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,291
tried to stop him...

166
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:40,791
What do you want?

167
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:41,916
What do you mean, huh?

168
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:42,416
Tell me!

169
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:43,291
We are done.

170
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,916
- Done with what? What are you talking?
- Please don’t hurt my sister.

171
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,666
- Please let my sister go.
- Why is he interfering?

172
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,416
Yedhu, please!

173
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,791
- Listen to me!
Please...Please? For what?

174
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,541
- Let her go.
- HEH!

175
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,791
He hurt my brother too...

176
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,916
I mean everything to him, ma’am.

177
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:55,791
Other than your brother,

178
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,041
who else in your family knows this?

179
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,041
My mother...

180
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,041
passed away soon after
my brother was born.

181
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,541
My father...

182
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,041
I can’t tell him.

183
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:06,791
I’ll speak with your father,

184
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,166
file a complaint.

185
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,041
Haseena, please allow me.

186
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,291
Call that jerk!

187
00:12:57,291 --> 00:12:58,041
No, ma’am.

188
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,041
Call him!

189
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:07,166
Hey!

190
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:08,166
Don’t move.

191
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,166
Special night...

192
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,416
Special tattoo.

193
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,291
Heh!

194
00:13:15,291 --> 00:13:16,416
Why are you calling me?

195
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:17,291
Where are you?

196
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:18,041
She’s with me.

197
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:19,166
Who are you?

198
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,416
ACP Satyabhama.

199
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,916
Listen, I have some advice for you.

200
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,166
Don’t bother Haseena again.

201
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:30,166
If you do,

202
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:31,916
I will have to bother you!

203
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:34,916
I DARE YOU!

204
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:56,916
Haseena,

205
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:58,291
this is my number.

206
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,416
If anything, just call me.

207
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:00,041
Okay.

208
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,416
Ma’am, my brother.

209
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,666
She’s our family friend, Divya.

210
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,666
Nice. What’s your name?

211
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:09,166
Chotu.

212
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,041
I mean, Iqbal.

213
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:13,416
We call him Chotu, with love.

214
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:16,166
What are you studying?

215
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,041
Junior College, Ma’am.
In Bhashyam Academy...

216
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,041
Shh...Shh...

217
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,291
Won’t you speak?

218
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,666
Do they have to say it all?

219
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,416
Hmm? Doctor or Engineer?

220
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,416
Doctor, ma’am.

221
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,666
I wanna be a Doctor too, ma’am!

222
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:35,666
Good!

223
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,541
You should always take care of
your sister just like this!

224
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:39,416
Okay?

225
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:41,666
Don’t worry.

226
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:42,791
I’m there for you!

227
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,541
Thank you ma’am.

228
00:14:59,416 --> 00:14:59,916
Mom...

229
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,166
Come on, Cheer up!

230
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,541
She is here now!

231
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,291
Isn’t it enough if we have
just our loved ones?

232
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,416
You are all that we have!

233
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,416
Amar, no!

234
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,791
Amar, no!

235
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:48,916
Why?

236
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,041
I want a daughter like you.

237
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,041
Daughter?
I want a boy like you.

238
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:57,916
Hey Amar!

239
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:02,291
Satya!

240
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,291
It’s been ringing for a while, dear.

241
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,041
Thanks, aunty!

242
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,791
Amar, sorry.
I need to take this.

243
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:11,416
Okay...

244
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,416
Haseena?

245
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,416
Yedhu came home, ma’am.

246
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:14,916
HASEENA!

247
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:15,541
He came again?

248
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,791
He is screaming
and banging at the door, ma’am.

249
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:18,666
Haseena,

250
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,666
Calm down.
Just calm down!

251
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:21,791
Go to the door.

252
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:22,416
OPEN THE DOOR!

253
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:22,791
Ma’am?

254
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:23,791
Listen to me!

255
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:25,791
Block the door with some sofa.

256
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:26,666
OK ma’am.

257
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:27,791
HOW DARE YOU GO TO THE POLICE!

258
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:30,916
ARE YOU BLOCKING THE DOOR?

259
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,041
Hima!

260
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:32,666
Madam?

261
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:33,916
Send back up to Haseena’s house.

262
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:34,791
Immediately!

263
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:35,541
I’m on my way.

264
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:36,166
OK madam.

265
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,166
HASEENA!

266
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,916
ARE YOU BLOCKING THE DOOR?

267
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,041
HASEENA!

268
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:42,166
Haseena,

269
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:42,666
talk to me.

270
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,416
Ma’am, I did what you asked me to do.

271
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,791
Just hold on for a few minutes.

272
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:46,416
I’m coming.

273
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:47,416
Ma’am, but...

274
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,291
HASEENA!

275
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,166
I’M TELLING YOU FOR THE LAST TIME!

276
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,166
HASEENA!

277
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:01,666
WHERE ARE YOU?

278
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:05,916
HOW DARE YOU COMPLAIN AGAINST ME?

279
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:06,791
Huh?

280
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,041
How dare you complain against me!

281
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,166
Yedhu!

282
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,166
Yedhu!

283
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:13,416
Yedhu, please!

284
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:14,083
Yedhu!

285
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,291
Yedhu, please!

286
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,416
Now go and complain!

287
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:25,916
Haseena!

288
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:27,541
Haseena, talk to me!

289
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:28,916
Haseena...

290
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:30,666
Haseena?

291
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,416
get out of there!

292
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:34,916
Do you hear me?

293
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:20,416
HEY!

294
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:57,541
Haseena!

295
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,416
I DARE YOU!

296
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,541
Haseena!

297
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:15,666
Haseena!

298
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:16,916
Haseena!

299
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:20,166
Madam,

300
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,166
take care of Chotu!

301
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:24,291
OK.

302
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:25,916
Let’s get to the hospital.

303
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,541
Haseena...

304
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,291
Who else in your family knows this?

305
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:13,541
My mother passed away
soon after my brother was born.

306
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,916
I mean everything to him, ma’am.

307
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,041
Stay strong, Imran!

308
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:39,291
Stay strong.

309
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,916
If only my daughter
said a word to me...

310
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,666
I would never have
let this happen.

311
00:22:58,166 --> 00:23:01,791
While rescuing a girl,
SHE Teams ACP Satyabhama

312
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:03,666
fired a shot at the accused.

313
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:05,041
You emptied the entire magazine!

314
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:06,666
Did you realize that?

315
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:11,291
Human rights groups are outraged
by her rash actions.

316
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,541
If you had shot someone by mistake?

317
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:17,416
But Joseph, who fires a gun
in a residential area!?

318
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:22,208
ACP Anand Rao says that
Satyabhama will face reprimand.

319
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,291
Joseph sir spared you from
getting suspended.

320
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:26,916
Satya!

321
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,708
Haseena approached her with immense trust,

322
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:00,958
but she could not save her.

323
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:03,208
She never came to terms with that pain.

324
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,208
She kept looking for Yedhu since that day.

325
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,833
“He used to torture me a lot.”

326
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,708
“I don’t know where he is now, ma’am.”

327
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,208
“I don’t know anything about him.
Don’t ask me.”

328
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,333
Madam, we scanned all of Vizag.

329
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:18,333
He is not here too.

330
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,583
“Yedhu left me long ago!”

331
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:21,958
“He dumped me long ago!”

332
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:25,708
Satya, I circulated Yedhu’s photo
to all the police stations.

333
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:26,833
But, no use.

334
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:27,958
“He’s a cheat!”

335
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:30,333
Madam, he is not in Vijayawada either.

336
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:34,208
“Yedhu left me and went away long ago.
He was an expert at cheating.”

337
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:36,208
I searched all over Hubli, ma’am.

338
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:37,208
Found him nowhere.

339
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,833
Please don’t refuse, uncle.

340
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:42,583
Consider it as coming from your daughter.

341
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,708
This is for Chotu’s fees.

342
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:46,458
He got a scholarship, dear.

343
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:49,708
Have it dear.

344
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:51,083
OK Chotu, I’ll get going.

345
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:55,583
Chotu!

346
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:58,333
Chotu, why don’t you say hi...

347
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:15,333
Iqbal!

348
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:20,833
Iqbal?

349
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:30,958
Remember this...

350
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:33,708
you have another sister in me.

351
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:43,958
Dad!

352
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:46,458
She said she would be there for her.

353
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:47,958
I am there for you.

354
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,083
But she wasn’t!

355
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:13,083
Doctor, we are hale and healthy.

356
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:16,208
But, I didn’t expect it to be
negative even this time.

357
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:18,208
We really want to have kids.

358
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,708
Not sure what the issue is!

359
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:30,083
Physically, all your reports are good.

360
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:31,458
But...

361
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:35,208
Satya, the reason for you
not getting pregnant...

362
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:36,708
is stress and anxiety.

363
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:42,083
I suggest taking a break from work
until you conceive.

364
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:44,750
Joseph sir called,

365
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:46,083
I should go to the office.

366
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:49,958
Satya was inspired by Joseph sir
to become an IPS officer.

367
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:52,208
He too has every confidence in her.

368
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:53,208
We counseled them, sir.

369
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:54,458
I spoke with the victim too.

370
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:57,083
What happened, sir?

371
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:58,708
I knew an impulsive Satya...

372
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:00,333
I’m amused to see you
talk about counseling!

373
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:00,708
Come!

374
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:04,875
Here!

375
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,583
Intelligence reports are coming in.

376
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:12,458
Sleeper cells are very active.

377
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:14,958
So we formed a Crime team.

378
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:15,958
Sir,

379
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:16,583
I’m aware.

380
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:19,708
To replace you in the SHE Team,

381
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:21,083
I have a lot of options.

382
00:27:21,958 --> 00:27:23,083
But for the crime team,

383
00:27:23,083 --> 00:27:24,333
you are my best option!

384
00:27:25,708 --> 00:27:26,708
Sir...

385
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:33,333
Satya,

386
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:37,333
if you get stuck at an unsolved case,

387
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:38,333
neither time stops,

388
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:39,708
nor does crime.

389
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:42,333
You have to move on!

390
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:45,958
OK,

391
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:47,333
How is Amar?

392
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:51,333
Did he complete that book?

393
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:54,208
He did, sir.

394
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:56,583
What’s the title?

395
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:59,083
After paying tribute to the
Queen of his heart,

396
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:01,208
and at that moment,

397
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:03,958
he stood with flowers in his hands,

398
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:05,333
right in front of her.

399
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:06,333
The End!

400
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:10,583
Thank you.

401
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:11,583
Thank you.

402
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:12,833
Sir,

403
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,833
We live in the age of million views,

404
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,333
and a million copies
of your book got sold.

405
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:17,708
How do you feel about that?

406
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:19,458
I’m writing for millions of smiles.

407
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:21,583
Not for views or sales!

408
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:24,583
OK, next question?

409
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:25,208
Sir!

410
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:27,833
You write very strong
woman characters.

411
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,083
Is there...any inspiration?

412
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,583
Yeah, she is beyond some inspiration.

413
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:35,583
No matter how many differences we have,

414
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:37,583
I want her to be smiling always.

415
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:43,333
Thank you...

416
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:44,333

He’ll be there in a bit.

00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:27,208
I think he’s in the restroom.

445
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:57,958
Heh!

446
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:02,708
Let go of me!

447
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:05,583
Hey Yedhu, Stop!

448
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:06,208
Stop!

449
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:10,083
Stop!

450
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:10,833
- Stop!
- Who are you?

451
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:11,583
Hyderabad Police!

452
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:12,458
Yedhu!

453
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:12,958
Are you okay?

454
00:31:13,958 --> 00:31:14,833
Yedhu?

455
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:17,458
Yedhu...that ****** left me long ago!

456
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,083
Poor thing...

457
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:19,458
he doesn’t know anything!

458
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:22,083
What nonsense!

459
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:23,583
Are you out of your minds?

460
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:25,583
If you find him,

461
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:26,708
you let me know.

462
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:28,833
I will put a bullet in him myself.

463
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,958
Hi Satya!

464
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:01,375
Three days…

465
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:02,458
what?

466
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:04,625
It’s been three days
since we had coffee together!

467
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,083
Sherlock!

468
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:16,083
Hey Sherlock!

469
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:18,333
Still hunting?

470
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:21,458
That mouse is long gone.

471
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,208
Don’t waste your time.

472
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:24,583
Talk to me!

473
00:32:27,208 --> 00:32:28,708
Why don’t you tell it
to me directly?

474
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,458
You are just like your mummy...

475
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:31,583
You don’t listen to me.

476
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,083
Stop it, Amar!

477
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:44,958
I will listen to whatever you say!

478
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:55,958
Why don’t you give a thought to
what the doctor said, at least now?

479
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:04,458
Uncle!

480
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:06,208
Iqbal is missing since
last night, dear.

481
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:09,708
We filed the complaint.

482
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:10,708
You can go now.

483
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:14,333
Ma’am!

484
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:19,333
When did you last speak with him?

485
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:20,208
Yesterday afternoon.

486
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,583
He didn’t come home for the night...

487
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,458
and you didn’t call him?

488
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,708
He sometimes stays back
at Divya’s house.

489
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:25,833
- That is why!
- Hmm.

490
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:27,583
Does he have any other friends?

491
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:28,708
No...

492
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:32,458
I don’t know.

493
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:36,708
Where did the phone trace to?

494
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:37,458
Sir,

495
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:38,083
one minute.

496
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:41,958
By evening 6:30,
the phone went off, madam.

497
00:33:41,958 --> 00:33:44,333
Last location was traced
to a cafe called ‘Coffee Man’.

498
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:45,208
Madam...

499
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,458
This is my station,

500
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:49,333
my case.

501
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:51,083
Sir!

502
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:54,833
Satya,

503
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:56,333
why are you here?

504
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:57,833
Sir, why are ‘you’ here?

505
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:01,833
Prahlad started the
investigation already.

506
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,958
and it’s not even a
‘SHE’ that’s missing!

507
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,583
I’ll let you know if there is
any harassment case.

508
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,583
Sir, Iqbal is Haseena’s brother.

509
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:08,583
So?

510
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:09,958
- Sir!
- Satya!

511
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:11,458
Just follow...

512
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:13,333
PROTOCOL!
OK?

513
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:27,708
Haseena!

514
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:31,458
Madam...

515
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:33,333
take care of Chotu!

516
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:40,791
This is Iqbal and Divya’s
college, madam.

517
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:42,666
Coffee Man.

518
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:44,291
They regularly hangout at this Cafe.

519
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:50,541
Good Morning madam!

520
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:52,916
Hello Ma’am.

521
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:55,291
Are there any common friends of
Iqbal and Divya?

522
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:57,166
Iqbal used to come here
to study, ma’am.

523
00:34:57,416 --> 00:34:58,916
Divya was also with him usually.

524
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:00,541
Did Iqbal have any
differences with anyone?

525
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:02,791
No madam, he was quite studious.

526
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:05,541
From what I know,
he always kept to himself.

527
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:06,166
Hima!

528
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:13,291
Ma’am, Coffee Man parking.

529
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:25,166
I can see him going in, but...

530
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:26,791
how did he get out?

531
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,916
He didn’t.
Some one must have took him out.

532
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:30,541
Let’s check the coffee shop.

533
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,291
Go back.
Play it in loop.

534
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:40,916
Something is fishy with
this CC TV, madam!

535
00:35:41,666 --> 00:35:43,541
Now play the parking lot
footage again.

536
00:35:47,291 --> 00:35:48,791
Looks like a maroon car
is heading out.

537
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:50,791
The footage was tampered ma’am.

538
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:53,666
Calling the Coffee shop?

539
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:54,916
Time waste.

540
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:57,916
Play our CCTV footage of that street.

541
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:03,916
I don’t see any maroon car
in this street, ma’am.

542
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:06,291
If it’s not in our footage too...

543
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,291
Someone from our department
must have tampered it.

544
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:14,166
Ma’am, how about checking the
neighboring building’s footage?

545
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:15,291
Good idea, play!

546
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:22,041
Ma’am, right there!

547
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:28,041
This looks like a VIP number.

548
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:29,666
Ma’am,

549
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:31,791
It’s registered under
the name of K Rishi Reddy.

550
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:33,291
Rishi...

551
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,041
MP Ramakanth Reddy’s nephew!

552
00:36:35,291 --> 00:36:36,041
I mean...

553
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:38,291
He is in the medical college photos
clicked by Iqbal, ma’am.

554
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:53,916
Sir is meeting with visitors now.
Come back later.

555
00:36:53,916 --> 00:36:55,791
We are here to meet Rishi Reddy,
not your sir.

556
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:58,166
Rishi is not here.
Go to his office to speak with him.

557
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:04,166
They aren’t letting me in
when I ask for Rishi, ma’am.

558
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:22,291
Hello Sir!

559
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:24,541
Have we met before?

560
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:25,791
Sir, I am ACP Satyabhama.

561
00:37:26,041 --> 00:37:26,916
Need to speak with Rishi.

562
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:29,541
SHE Teams?

563
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:31,041
I mean Rishi...

564
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:33,041
If you speak with me,
it’s as good as speaking with Rishi.

565
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:35,041
But I don’t have the time.

566
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:35,791
Sir...

567
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:37,791
If there’s anything, you can
speak with DCP Anand Rao.

568
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:43,666
Madam,

569
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:46,541
DCP sir and Ramakanth Reddy were
classmates in Osmania University.

570
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:54,791
Why are you here?

571
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:57,916
I get it now.

572
00:37:58,041 --> 00:37:58,416
Let’s go.

573
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:43,541
Usually Iqbal used to give the Insulin.

574
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:46,916
For the first time...

575
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:49,791
I don’t know where he is, ma’am.

576
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:51,416
Divya!

577
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:53,916
I noticed when I came for
Haseena...

578
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,666
and now when Iqbal isn’t around.

579
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:01,666
Did Iqbal tie this?

580
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:05,041
Hmm.

581
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:07,166
Divya,

582
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:08,541
How did you meet Iqbal?

583
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:17,166
Divya!

584
00:39:18,416 --> 00:39:19,666
Who is the President of India?

585
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:22,916
APJ Abdul Kalam?

586
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:24,541
But...

587
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:26,916
this is Chotu’s writing, isn’t it?

00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:33,666

give me a smile!

605
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:02,541
If Iqbal is with me,
I feel strong, ma’am.

606
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:09,416
I know Iqbal has a
special place in your life.

607
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:13,916
But, who is this Rishi?

608
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:16,416
He was with you
at the police station.

609
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:23,541
If you want Iqbal to come back,
you need to speak up.

610
00:41:31,166 --> 00:41:32,041
Did you smoke?

611
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:35,166
Did you drink as well,
in the last 24 hours?

612
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:37,041
Is this a joke?

613
00:41:37,916 --> 00:41:38,916
What is this, sir?

614
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:41,416
Couldn’t you find a better donor for the kid?

615
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,416
Since he is a blood relation...

616
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:44,791
What has relation got to do
with donation?

617
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:50,666
Is there anyone with
A -ve blood group?

618
00:41:50,666 --> 00:41:53,041
Is there anyone with
A -ve blood group?

619
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:53,916
Hello!

620
00:41:54,541 --> 00:41:56,666
Is there anyone with
A -ve blood group?

621
00:41:56,666 --> 00:41:57,541
I will go check in the south block.

622
00:41:57,541 --> 00:41:58,416
A -ve?

623
00:41:59,166 --> 00:41:59,541
Hello!

624
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:00,666
Yeah.

625
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:03,041
Did you drink or smoke
in the last 48 hours?

626
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:04,041
I don’t have the habit.

627
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:04,541
Come!

628
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:20,291
Divya,

629
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:22,916
He is the chairman’s nephew...

630
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:25,791
Does the chairman’s nephew
not have blood?

631
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:26,416
Can’t he donate some?

632
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:30,791
- Hi!
- Hello Rishi.

633
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:40,791
-Can I go?
-Yeah.

634
00:42:40,916 --> 00:42:42,541
Let’s keep everything
ready for tomorrow.

635
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:43,041
Yeah, okay.

636
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:43,916
Okay, bye bye!

637
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:49,291
Hi!

638
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:50,166
Huh?

639
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:52,166
When can I come back for this?

640
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:53,416
To have it again,

641
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:54,291
you have to wait
another eight weeks.

642
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:55,166
Oh!

643
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:58,041
How about a coffee then?

644
00:42:58,541 --> 00:43:00,041
Classes...Internship...

645
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:01,666
and I have to be home by Nine.

646
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:03,041
So it’s tough.

647
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:07,541
Rishi...

648
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:08,416
Hmm?

649
00:43:08,791 --> 00:43:09,666
It’s not a NO.

650
00:43:09,666 --> 00:43:10,916
Just busy...

651
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:16,291
Hi!

652
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:19,166
My hand...

653
00:43:19,416 --> 00:43:20,166
got sprained.

654
00:43:20,916 --> 00:43:22,291
Let me know if it happens again.

655
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:23,541
Give me your number,
I’ll inform.

656
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:31,291
Are you done now?

657
00:43:31,416 --> 00:43:32,666
with your classes...seminars?

658
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:34,416
Let’s go out?

659
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:35,041
Now!?

660
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:35,666
Hmm...

661
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:37,416
My house is too far away...

662
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:38,666

Divya, move a little to your right.

693
00:45:12,875 --> 00:45:13,250
Yeah.

694
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:16,125
Hey, move!

695
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:19,250
- Let’s get one together.
- Hey, don’t you get it?

696
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:20,500
Just one photo...

697
00:45:21,375 --> 00:45:22,500
Hey Iqbal, you click it!

698
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:23,625
- Leave me!
- Abhi...

699
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:24,375
Abhi, let go of her hand.

700
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,250
Let me go!

701
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:26,166
Hey... you go and click the photo!

702
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:27,000
Let go of her hand first!

703
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:27,750
Take your hand off...

704
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:28,375
Get lost!

705
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:43,000
Rishi, I am speaking with him...

706
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,375
What is there to talk when
he lays his hands on her?

707
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:45,125
Rishi, keep calm.

708
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:46,125
- Who is that idiot?
- Rishi!

709
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:47,500
Why didn’t you tell me
that he is troubling you?

710
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,250
- Hold on, Rishi!
- I was dealing with him...

711
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,750
Iqbal, I’m not speaking with you!

712
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,250
Calm down, Rishi.

713
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,375
- I was handling it...
- Listen to me, Rishi!

714
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,250
Why is he interfering
when I am talking with you?

715
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,125
Rishi, relax!

716
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,375
I’m telling you
that I’m handling it...

717
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,125
- Rishi...
- Heh!

718
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:01,000
He hit Iqbal?

719
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:02,125
Hmm.

720
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:03,875
Hima?

721
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:05,125
Madam, your guess was right.

722
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:07,125
Rishi’s phone also traced
to Coffee Man that day.

723
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:11,000
I am so happy, guys.

724
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,375
Our game is about to reach
one million downloads.

725
00:46:13,625 --> 00:46:14,875
I want you all to know that...

726
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:16,375
I’m so proud of you all!

727
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:17,625
Sir, please!

728
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:19,875
NINETY SEVEN!

729
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:21,375
Yes! We’ve done this!

730
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:22,500
NINETY EIGHT!

731
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,125
NINETY NINE!

732
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:34,375
ONE MILLION...YAY!

733
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:45,375
Do the chat messages in this game
get saved in the server?

734
00:46:45,666 --> 00:46:46,166
They do.

735
00:46:46,375 --> 00:46:47,375
Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it.

736
00:46:47,375 --> 00:46:48,375
OK uncle, I will wait.

737
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:11,125
Suspicious about Rishi,

738
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:13,000
Satya started strict vigilance on him.

739
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:18,500
Where is madam?

740
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:20,875
Madam,

741
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:21,625
DCP Sir.

742
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:23,125
Sir!

743
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:25,375
Satya, why don’t you answer the phone?

744
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,750
What is this warrant about?

745
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,750
This is a very important evidence
in the MMTS gang case, sir.

746
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:29,875
OK, so?

747
00:47:29,875 --> 00:47:31,500
What has the game got to do with it?

748
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,125
Got a complaint that the game
is being misused, sir.

749
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:34,250
Madam,

750
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:35,625
it’s last month’s date here!

751
00:47:35,875 --> 00:47:37,125
Oh! Is it?

752
00:47:37,375 --> 00:47:38,500
So sorry, sir.

753
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:39,500
Hey Hima!

754
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:40,875
Why didn’t you check it?

755
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:46,750
Hima!

756
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:49,250
Madam, the game is awesome!

757
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,250
Is that so? Let’s play!

758
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,125
Hey!

759
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:11,875
Can I buy you a drink?

760
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:13,625
I have a girl friend.

761
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:15,750
I just said hi...

762
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,291
did I ask about the girlfriend?

763
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:19,625
Why worry about the girlfriend
when I am here?

764
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,000
Good one!

765
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,625
Third level is quite convenient.

766
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:30,875
Did you check my feedback?

767
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,125
I already updated it.

768
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,000
Didn’t you notice?

769
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,500
I’ll check it, but...

770
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,500
will you beat my high score
at least this time?

771
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:40,750
I won’t miss this time.

772
00:48:41,125 --> 00:48:42,125
Hmm? Let’s see!

773
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:04,750
All the played games have been
saved in the server, ma’am.

774
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,375
And this is the game
Rishi played with Neha.

775
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:08,125
This is all a game?

776
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,625
It felt so realistic!

777
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:10,625
Yes, madam.

778
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:11,500
You feel as if you are right there!

779
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,250
I played it that day!

780
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:15,000
Yeah ma’am, this game was
developed by AI technologies.

781
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,500
- It’s a very complicated design...
- Proxy!

782
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,500
Make me understand!

783
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:19,375
Ma’am, simple.

784
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,875
This is a firing game
designed with real places.

785
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,750
It has different levels like
pub, garage etc.

786
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,125
Also, like whatsapp and Instagram,

787
00:49:26,125 --> 00:49:29,000
chats, voice messages, photos
and videos also can be shared.

788
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,750
You can choose an avatar you like
and enter this game.

789
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,875
More than users, there are misusers
in this game, madam.

790
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:36,500
What do you mean?

791
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:40,500
Yes ma’am, that MMTS black mailer gang
used this game and trapped women.

792
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,625
Okay.
Are there any chats of Rishi with Neha?

793
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:49,750
Ma’am, all these chats are encrypted.
I’m unable to open them.

794
00:49:49,875 --> 00:49:50,625
Just give us some time.

795
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:51,625
Hmm...hurry up!

796
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:03,625
Let’s go!

797
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:12,750
I’m coming to Hyderabad in
January first week.

798
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:14,750
What...really?

799
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:15,625
Let’s catch up then!

800
00:50:15,625 --> 00:50:16,000
Hmm!

801
00:50:17,875 --> 00:50:18,625
Rishi!

802
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,750
Got the access, ma’am!

803
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:29,000
Did Rishi meet Neha?

804
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,375
Who is this Neha?

805
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:35,375
I feel there is a strong connection between
Iqbal’s disappearance and Neha.

806
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:38,750
What did they chat further? Look!

807
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,375
Rishi did message her, but...

808
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,250
there’s no reply from Neha, ma’am.

809
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:47,125
Who else did he chat with frequently?

810
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:47,875
Check it.

811
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:53,250
After Neha, Rishi chatted mostly with...

812
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,750
another player called Vijay, ma’am.

813
00:50:56,875 --> 00:50:57,750
No, these are not important...

814
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
open the last chat.

815
00:50:59,000 --> 00:50:59,875
Okay ma’am.

816
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:04,875
Voice clip!

817
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:07,500
Vijay, I dropped Iqbal at the
location you asked me to.

818
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:08,000
I’m done.

819
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:09,625
Oh, you’re so done!

820
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:12,625
Vijay...

821
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,375
Vijay, please answer!

822
00:51:14,375 --> 00:51:16,000
The police came to my home
looking for Iqbal.

823
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:17,625
They came to my office too.

824
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:19,000
Vijay, please respond.
Vijay?

825
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:20,375
Who is Vijay?

826
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:21,375
Ma’am!

827
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:22,500
Ma’am, let me explain.

828
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,250
Ma’am, just listen to me once.

829
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,000
There are a lot of people downstairs...
it will be embarrassing.

830
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:27,750
Ma’am...

831
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,500
-Ma’am, please. Please, ma’am!
-Satya!

832
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,625
Hey, leave him...leave him now!

833
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:31,750
Satya, listen to me!

834
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:32,625
How did you even get in?

835
00:51:32,625 --> 00:51:34,625
-Satya, it’s an order!
-Anand, ask her to leave him!

836
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:35,125
HEH!

837
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,500
Answer the phone, sir.

838
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,875
Don’t think you heard it.
Answer it.

839
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:43,750
Hello?

840
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:44,375
- Anand!
- Sir!

841
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Satya took charge.

842
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,000
But, sir...

843
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,500
- Listen...
- Sir!

844
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,375
She will lead this case from now on.

845
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,750
Sir, this case...

846
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:01,375
-Ma’am, please!
-Hey, sit down!

847
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:03,625
Ma’am...

848
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:04,500
Where is Iqbal?

849
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,125
Please ma’am,
just listen to me once.

850
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:06,875
Who is Vijay?

851
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:08,500
Ma’am, please listen to me.

852
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:09,500
Who is Neha?

853
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:10,500
Just once, listen to...

854
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:11,625
ANSWER, GODDAMNIT!

855
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,750
Neha said she would come to
Hyderabad in January, ma’am.

856
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:23,500
We wanted to meet up.

857
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
But I couldn’t find her
online for a few days.

858
00:52:28,875 --> 00:52:30,000
All of a sudden, one day...

859
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:34,250
Can I buy you a drink?

860
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:34,875
Hmm?

861
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:36,875
What?

862
00:52:37,375 --> 00:52:38,500
Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?

863
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:39,500
Lover boy!

864
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:41,250
Who are you?

865
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:42,375
I’m ACP Vijay.

866
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:44,250
Anti Terrorist Squad, Dehradun.

867
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:47,750
Who do you think Neha is?

868
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,500
She honey-trapped you.

869
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,750
What nonsense!

870
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:53,125
Look at this.

871
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:54,875
Neha has terror links.

872
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,625
They planned something big for January.

873
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:01,750
Still don’t believe me?

874
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,125
You want to see my ID?

875
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,750
Clueless what to do,

876
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,250
I approached DCP Uncle.

877
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:12,875
Uncle!

878
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:13,625
- Five minutes.
- OK.

879
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:21,000
Sir!

880
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:22,125
In the first week of January,

881
00:53:22,125 --> 00:53:24,000
there could be a terror attack
in a political meeting,

882
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,875
according to intelligence report.

883
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:27,875
If we take immediate action,
we can avoid the damage.

884
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:29,375
And sir,

885
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:31,500
I hope you know what I’m saying.

886
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,125
I mean, your friend...

887
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,750
MP Ramakanth Reddy’s meeting?

888
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:36,375
Yes sir.

889
00:53:39,625 --> 00:53:41,000
Alert all the forces!

890
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,500
The attack should not happen
at any cost!

891
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:43,125
OK sir.

892
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:48,500
Oh God!

893
00:53:53,875 --> 00:53:55,875
I tried a lot to call
Vijay online, ma’am.

894
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:57,875
Hello Vijay!

895
00:53:58,625 --> 00:53:59,250
Vijay, are you there?

896
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:00,750
Please come online once.

897
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,125
Are you there?

898
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:08,875
What’s your problem, man?

899
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,375
We are busy at work.

900
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:12,125
Don’t disturb!

901
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,750
Sir, I didn’t get it
when you tried to explain.

902
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,125
Tell me what to do now.

903
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:20,000
OK, will you give me Neha’s
chat data from the game?

904
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:22,500
Okay.

905
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Not just your conversations with her,

906
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,250
I want all the conversations she had
with the other players too.

907
00:54:26,375 --> 00:54:26,875
Sure, sir.

908
00:54:27,375 --> 00:54:29,500
After sharing Neha’s chat data
with Vijay,

909
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:31,375
I was curious to know
what was in those chats.

910
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:34,000
She mostly interacted with
one gamer particularly, ma’am.

911
00:54:34,625 --> 00:54:37,750
She asked him to meet a guy called
Akhtar, for the January attack.

912
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:41,000
I went there to find out
what it was all about, and...

913
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:50,250
Iqbal?

914
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,000
Iqbal...

915
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:43,625
Terrorist!

916
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:46,875
I couldn’t believe it, ma’am.

917
00:55:50,125 --> 00:55:50,875
I’m sorry, sir.

918
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,875
I saw him holding this...

919
00:55:53,625 --> 00:55:55,375
and didn’t know what to do.

920
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:01,875
You have to do
one more task for us.

921
00:56:11,875 --> 00:56:14,625
While I couldn’t make up my mind
if I should follow Vijay’s orders...

922
00:56:20,125 --> 00:56:21,625
-: 06 JANUARY 2024 :-

923
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,250
Sir,

924
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:24,625
In the first week of January,

925
00:56:24,625 --> 00:56:26,250
there could be a terror attack
in a political meeting,

926
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,375
according to intelligence reports.

927
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:29,125
I’m coming to Hyderabad in the
first week of January.

928
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:30,625
They planned something big
for January.

929
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:31,750
-: 06 JANUARY 2024 :-

930
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,541
-: Anantagiri Hills :-
-: 2 KM :-

931
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:39,625
Vijay!

932
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:41,500
I dropped Iqbal at the location
you asked me to.

933
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,625
I’m done.

934
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,125
Iqbal!

935
00:57:52,375 --> 00:57:53,000
What...

936
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:54,000
What happened?

937
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:05,750
Leave me!

938
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:06,625
Iqbal...

939
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,500
Iqbal, let go of me!

940
00:58:15,875 --> 00:58:16,875
Iqbal, let go of me!

941
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:24,375
-: Anantagiri Hills :-
-: 2 KM :-

942
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:33,250
-: Anantagiri Hills :-
-: 2 KM :-

943
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,125
Iqbal is in Vijay’s custody...

944
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:02,125
Iqbal!

945
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,500
Iqbal!

946
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,625
Iqbal, wake up!

947
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:05,875
Iqbal!

948
01:01:06,125 --> 01:01:06,625
Iqbal!

949
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:09,375
Hima!

950
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:10,125
Ambulance!

951
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,500
HEY!

952
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:08,958
Take it slow.

953
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:09,958
Be careful!

954
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:32,958
Iqbal?

955
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:33,833
Emergency ward.

956
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:13,583
Nothing to worry,
he’ll come out of coma.

957
01:03:13,583 --> 01:03:14,458
What do you mean?

958
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:16,458
It could take a day
or even a month.

959
01:03:26,833 --> 01:03:27,333
Thomas?

960
01:03:27,458 --> 01:03:29,833
Ma’am, I just crossed Mangalore.

961
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:30,958
I don’t care where you are!

962
01:03:31,333 --> 01:03:33,083
Where is Yedhu? Where is he?

963
01:03:33,583 --> 01:03:36,458
Ma’am, I’ve been searching in
all the places you asked me to.

964
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:38,333
I’ve been working on this
case full time.

965
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:41,458
That’s not where
you should be looking.

966
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:47,208
Okay, ma’am.

967
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:48,208
Madam!

968
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:51,333
Should we bring the
sleeper cell thing up with him?

969
01:03:54,333 --> 01:03:55,458
What do you want to ask him,
Prahlad?

970
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:57,333
If his son is a terrorist?

971
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,833
If we believe everything
the accused says,

972
01:03:58,833 --> 01:04:00,083
what’s the point of our investigation?

973
01:04:00,458 --> 01:04:01,083
Madam!

974
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:03,583
The prime accused in the
highly sensational Iqbal case,

975
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:06,458
Rishi Reddy, has been granted
conditional bail.

976
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:07,833
As part of the rescue operation,

977
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:08,833
ACP Satyabhama found

978
01:04:08,833 --> 01:04:11,708
a heavily wounded Iqbal in Vikarabad.

979
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:16,208
Getting the bail so quickly was possible
only because of you sir.

980
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:17,458
It’s okay Ramakanth, it happens.

981
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:18,083
Thank you sir.

982
01:04:18,083 --> 01:04:19,083
No big deal...

983
01:04:19,083 --> 01:04:19,958
I’ll meet you in Delhi, sir.

984
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:20,833
Yes, definitely!

985
01:04:21,458 --> 01:04:22,208
Goodbye, sir.

986
01:04:22,208 --> 01:04:23,208
Goodbye.

987
01:04:23,833 --> 01:04:25,333
I’m off too, bye!

988
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:27,333
Hey, what happened?

989
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:30,333
Rishi got out on just a conditional bail.

990
01:04:30,958 --> 01:04:32,333
As if the case has been
closed completely...

991
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:34,708
you casually ask “ what happened?” !

992
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:36,708
It started off as a missing case.

993
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:39,458
It turned into a kidnap,
then to attempted murder,

994
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:40,583
and finally settled at terrorist case!

995
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:42,458
If that Iqbal dies,

996
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:44,208
it will become a murder case also!

997
01:04:44,583 --> 01:04:46,458
Mm...murder case??

998
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:47,583
You first sit down.

999
01:04:51,083 --> 01:04:52,458
Tell me what to do now.

1000
01:04:53,208 --> 01:04:54,583
If he wakes up there,

1001
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:56,833
it’s a climax for Rishi’s life!

1002
01:04:56,958 --> 01:04:58,583
If he dies instead,

1003
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:01,708
it’s THE END of your political career!

1004
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:06,583
Make sure Rishi doesn’t
go out for a few days.

1005
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:09,458
Especially, make sure he
doesn’t use his phone.

1006
01:05:09,458 --> 01:05:11,208
These games, browsing...
nothing doing.

1007
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:11,833
Okay!

1008
01:05:31,833 --> 01:05:34,333
Why would Yedhu want to kill Iqbal?

1009
01:05:35,083 --> 01:05:37,458
How is Rishi connected to Yedhu?

1010
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:43,333
Who are Neha and Vijay
that Rishi talked about?

1011
01:05:43,458 --> 01:05:46,458
If I learn more about them,
will I find Yedhu?

1012
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:49,333
Still awake?

1013
01:05:57,083 --> 01:05:58,583
From Rishi’s story,

1014
01:05:59,208 --> 01:06:01,958
it’s true that he interacted with
Vijay and Neha.

1015
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,583
You call it a story on the one hand,

1016
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:05,083
and truth on the other!

1017
01:06:06,958 --> 01:06:08,083
Whatever it is Amar,

1018
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:10,833
this should not have happened at all!

1019
01:06:13,083 --> 01:06:14,833
Had I saved Haseena,

1020
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:17,083
Iqbal wouldn’t have been
in this situation now.

1021
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:24,958
A typical police officer would have...

1022
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:27,208
stopped at Haseena.

1023
01:06:27,708 --> 01:06:30,458
But you stayed put for Iqbal.

1024
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:31,708
Satya,

1025
01:06:32,333 --> 01:06:33,458
whether I write a story,

1026
01:06:33,833 --> 01:06:35,083
or you take up a case,

1027
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:37,958
we both strive for closure.

1028
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:48,458
Hima?

1029
01:06:48,458 --> 01:06:49,458
Madam, Rishi is absconding.

1030
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:50,333
He is no where to be seen.

1031
01:06:50,458 --> 01:06:50,958
What?

1032
01:06:52,458 --> 01:06:53,583
Did you check over there?

1033
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:54,333
We are checking, ma’am.

1034
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:10,208
What happened?

1035
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:12,083
We covered a five km radius
around this area ma’am,

1036
01:07:12,083 --> 01:07:12,958
but couldn’t find him.

1037
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:14,833
Do you think five km is enough?

1038
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:15,583
Hima!

1039
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,833
Search another five!

1040
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:17,708
She says another five!

1041
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:18,583
What’s happening here?

1042
01:07:18,583 --> 01:07:19,583
Is this how you work
in your department?

1043
01:07:19,583 --> 01:07:20,333
Let me talk with her...

1044
01:07:20,333 --> 01:07:22,208
Sir, why don’t you ask
your folks in Delhi?

1045
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:23,583
They’ll find him in fifteen minutes!

1046
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:24,333
Satya!

1047
01:07:24,333 --> 01:07:24,833
Sir.

1048
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:35,708
Is there a conspiracy behind
Joseph Raj’s early retirement?

1049
01:07:35,708 --> 01:07:38,583
That is true -
say some sectors supporting him.

1050
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:42,833
Joseph, my man!

1051
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:43,833
Come on...click the photos!

1052
01:07:57,708 --> 01:07:58,583
Done?

1053
01:07:58,958 --> 01:07:59,708
Let’s go.

1054
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:09,583
Why is Ramankanth still calling me?

1055
01:08:09,833 --> 01:08:12,583
We did transfer Joseph
on his demand, didn’t we?

1056
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:15,958
That doesn’t mean
the case is closed, sir.

1057
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,833
Just to close this case,

1058
01:08:18,208 --> 01:08:20,458
they will blame
Iqbal to be a terrorist.

1059
01:08:21,083 --> 01:08:22,458
Sir, that will only be an allegation.

1060
01:08:22,458 --> 01:08:23,208
You are right.

1061
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:25,708
But once I’m out of the case,

1062
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:27,458
that will become true!

1063
01:08:29,458 --> 01:08:32,333
Why don’t we just say that the guy
in coma is a terrorist,

1064
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:33,708
and close the case?

1065
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:35,458
Nope.

1066
01:08:35,708 --> 01:08:37,083
Why? What’s wrong with it?

1067
01:08:37,083 --> 01:08:39,458
There are still three days left for
Joseph sir’s transfer, sir.

1068
01:08:41,208 --> 01:08:41,708
Satya,

1069
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:43,708
I can just give you three more days...

1070
01:08:43,708 --> 01:08:45,833
From Rishi’s statement,
Akhtar is the only one who’s real, sir.

1071
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:48,083
and we hit a dead end
for his location too!

1072
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:48,708
So?

1073
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:49,833
Sir, that is why...

1074
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:51,083
Akhtar’s co-ordinates?

1075
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,958
That’s a very sensitive area.

1076
01:08:53,208 --> 01:08:54,458
It’s not safe for you.

1077
01:08:54,458 --> 01:08:55,833
Sir, I can’t take another chance
in Iqbal’s case.

1078
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:57,833
Satya, we are done with
this conversation.

1079
01:09:00,958 --> 01:09:02,208
Guys, we only have three days.

1080
01:09:02,458 --> 01:09:04,833
Pull out all the details of everyone
linked with this case.

1081
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:05,833
It’s a fake Id ma’am,

1082
01:09:05,833 --> 01:09:06,833
not in the records.

1083
01:09:07,083 --> 01:09:08,333
What if this Vijay is undercover?

1084
01:09:08,333 --> 01:09:09,583
If he is undercover,

1085
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:10,833
why would he show ATS ID?

1086
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:16,208
There’s no Neha in our Terrorist list,

1087
01:09:16,458 --> 01:09:18,583
nor a profile that matches this picture.

1088
01:09:18,583 --> 01:09:20,333
So, this is a fake profile too!

1089
01:09:20,583 --> 01:09:22,458
When Rishi spoke with Vijay and Neha,

1090
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:24,208
they masked the IP address with VPN,

1091
01:09:24,208 --> 01:09:26,333
and changed the location
every five seconds, ma’am.

1092
01:09:27,583 --> 01:09:28,333
Akhtar.

1093
01:09:28,708 --> 01:09:30,083
He brainwashes youngsters,

1094
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:31,958
and recruits them for
terrorist organizations.

1095
01:09:31,958 --> 01:09:32,958
Exactly!

1096
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:35,083
Masjids and Madrasas are his targets.

1097
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:36,083
What’s the kid’s name?

1098
01:09:36,458 --> 01:09:37,208
Iqbal, sir.

1099
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,083
Digital Forensic Reports -

1100
01:09:41,083 --> 01:09:42,583
Iqbal’s phone, laptop, system...

1101
01:09:42,583 --> 01:09:43,708
everything is clean, madam.

1102
01:09:43,708 --> 01:09:46,083
There is nothing in them that suggests
that he contacted Akhtar.

1103
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:48,708
If Akhtar contacted him, that means...

1104
01:09:48,708 --> 01:09:49,833
this kid is up to something.

1105
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:51,833
How about we nab this Akhtar?

1106
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:53,208
Six months of investigation!

1107
01:09:53,583 --> 01:09:55,083
Don’t mess our operation against him.

1108
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:55,958
Rajan!

1109
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:57,333
Satya, please stay out of this.

1110
01:10:04,208 --> 01:10:06,208
Satya, I know you will never stop.

1111
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:08,208
But we are running out of time.

1112
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:09,083
Off the records...

1113
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:10,458

Where is Iqbal’s file?

01:13:44,583 --> 01:13:46,083
You know how sensitive that area is.

1172
01:13:46,083 --> 01:13:47,083
Why did you go there, still?

1173
01:13:47,458 --> 01:13:48,333
Who said I went there, sir?

1174
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:49,208
I got a call from ATS!

1175
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:50,958
Didn’t they ask you not to
disturb their operation?...

1176
01:13:57,958 --> 01:13:59,833
Looks like you are more disturbed?

1177
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:02,458
Forty Eight hours.

1178
01:14:02,708 --> 01:14:03,208
After all!

1179
01:14:03,583 --> 01:14:04,833
You only have two days left.

1180
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:05,750
I will see to it!

1181
01:14:06,083 --> 01:14:06,708
Pull the car out!

1182
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:13,291
Iqbal’s prescription?

1183
01:14:13,666 --> 01:14:14,166
Ma’am,

1184
01:14:14,166 --> 01:14:15,291
the prescription has changed.

1185
01:14:17,666 --> 01:14:19,041
-Okay, thanks!
-That’s OK.

1186
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:22,541
Phone!

1187
01:14:47,791 --> 01:14:48,416
Who’s that?

1188
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:49,666
Water, sir!

1189
01:14:50,416 --> 01:14:51,041
I don’t want it.

1190
01:14:52,166 --> 01:14:52,791
Hello Divya!

1191
01:14:53,041 --> 01:14:53,916
Rishi, what’s happening?

1192
01:14:54,291 --> 01:14:55,166
Why did you run away?

1193
01:14:55,416 --> 01:14:56,166
Where are you?

1194
01:14:56,166 --> 01:14:57,416
Divya, listen to me carefully.

1195
01:14:57,416 --> 01:14:58,166
What should I listen to?

1196
01:14:58,166 --> 01:14:59,666
Neha...Vijay...terror attack...

1197
01:15:00,166 --> 01:15:01,666
Why are you so mad at Iqbal?

1198
01:15:01,666 --> 01:15:03,041
If we get hold of Vijay,
everything will be clear.

1199
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:05,416
Now his life is at risk.

1200
01:15:05,416 --> 01:15:07,541
If something happens to him,
I will never forgive you!

1201
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:08,291
Police...Police!

1202
01:15:08,291 --> 01:15:10,041
Divya, does anyone know
that you are talking to me?

1203
01:15:10,041 --> 01:15:13,291
Police...Police...Police!

1204
01:15:13,666 --> 01:15:14,541
Where is he?

1205
01:15:15,541 --> 01:15:16,541
He is upstairs, madam.

1206
01:15:16,791 --> 01:15:17,666
Hello Divya!

1207
01:15:18,916 --> 01:15:19,541
Divya!

1208
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:22,291
Satya!

1209
01:15:22,666 --> 01:15:26,041
Ma’am, if you scan this QR code with
Divya’s phone, her phone can be cloned.

1210
01:15:29,666 --> 01:15:30,166
Phone!

1211
01:15:42,291 --> 01:15:42,916
This way, madam.

1212
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:44,916
This room.

1213
01:15:52,416 --> 01:15:52,916
Madam,

1214
01:15:53,041 --> 01:15:53,791
Rishi escaped again.

1215
01:15:55,541 --> 01:15:56,666
Isn’t that what we want?

1216
01:15:57,166 --> 01:15:58,666
I know where he would go now.

1217
01:16:04,041 --> 01:16:05,500
After all that happened to Iqbal,

1218
01:16:06,166 --> 01:16:08,416
no matter what you say,
it isn’t justified, Rishi.

1219
01:16:08,416 --> 01:16:09,291
You too?

1220
01:16:10,041 --> 01:16:11,291
Divya, at least you should trust me!

1221
01:16:11,291 --> 01:16:12,041
How could I?

1222
01:16:12,666 --> 01:16:13,916
Iqbal accepted us.

1223
01:16:14,416 --> 01:16:15,291
But you?

1224
01:16:16,791 --> 01:16:17,666
Just tell me, Rishi...

1225
01:16:18,291 --> 01:16:21,416
did you meet at least
one person from your story?

1226
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:26,166
Syringe!

1227
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:29,041
Divya, I did meet a guy!

1228
01:16:29,416 --> 01:16:30,541
He gave me a syringe in old city.

1229
01:16:31,041 --> 01:16:31,916
We should catch hold of him.

1230
01:16:32,541 --> 01:16:33,416
Trust me Divya.

1231
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:34,291
One chance.

1232
01:16:34,541 --> 01:16:35,416
One last chance.

1233
01:16:36,166 --> 01:16:37,166
Please?

1234
01:16:39,416 --> 01:16:40,916
Iqbal is getting better now.

1235
01:16:41,916 --> 01:16:42,916
Yeah, I’m going home.

1236
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:44,541
Yeah.

1237
01:16:45,541 --> 01:16:46,166
Dear...

1238
01:16:47,166 --> 01:16:48,166
did you find Rishi?

1239
01:16:48,916 --> 01:16:49,916
We couldn’t find him, Uncle.

1240
01:17:03,166 --> 01:17:04,916
Come in for some tea, dear.

1241
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:11,291
Chotu!

1242
01:17:11,416 --> 01:17:12,791
Go get some tea leaves!

1243
01:17:27,916 --> 01:17:29,291
How much can he bear?

1244
01:17:29,666 --> 01:17:30,541
He is just a kid!

1245
01:17:32,291 --> 01:17:34,541
Everybody is worried about him.

1246
01:17:34,791 --> 01:17:36,791
Haseena left us.

1247
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:38,166
I’m ACP Vijay.

1248
01:17:38,916 --> 01:17:40,166
Now Iqbal is suffering.

1249
01:17:48,666 --> 01:17:49,666
Who is he?

1250
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:51,666
He is my brother-in-law, Riaz.

1251
01:17:51,791 --> 01:17:53,666
His daughter is getting married
next week.

1252
01:17:53,666 --> 01:17:54,666
Where does he live?

1253
01:17:54,916 --> 01:17:55,666
Istanbul.

1254
01:17:56,666 --> 01:17:57,666
It’s been three days

1255
01:17:57,916 --> 01:17:58,791
since he came to Hyderabad.

1256
01:17:59,416 --> 01:18:01,666
You never told me anything about him?

1257
01:18:01,916 --> 01:18:02,666
Well...

1258
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:05,916
he promised to find a job for
Haseena sometime back.

1259
01:18:06,916 --> 01:18:08,166
After that, things went out of hand.

1260
01:18:08,666 --> 01:18:09,166
Forget it.

1261
01:18:09,666 --> 01:18:10,541
What exactly happened?

1262
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:21,541
Riyaz landed from Istanbul,

1263
01:18:21,791 --> 01:18:22,916
that same day Iqbal went missing.

1264
01:18:23,291 --> 01:18:24,666
Madam, found Riaz’s location.

1265
01:18:24,791 --> 01:18:25,916
Prahlad Sir, I’ve sent it to you.

1266
01:18:26,541 --> 01:18:26,916
Prahlad!

1267
01:18:27,166 --> 01:18:27,541
Ma’am!

1268
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:28,291
Not in our car!

1269
01:18:28,541 --> 01:18:30,041
Sir, a fine of five hundred just for insurance?

1270
01:18:30,041 --> 01:18:31,291
Hey, Just pay the fine!

1271
01:18:35,541 --> 01:18:36,416
I came the day before.

1272
01:18:37,041 --> 01:18:37,666
Yes...one...

1273
01:18:40,416 --> 01:18:40,916
Hey, one minute!

1274
01:18:56,291 --> 01:18:57,291
Hey, who are you all?

1275
01:18:58,041 --> 01:18:58,916
Why did you bring me here?

1276
01:18:59,416 --> 01:19:00,791
Vijay, why did you want to kill Iqbal?

1277
01:19:01,416 --> 01:19:01,916
Vijay?

1278
01:19:03,166 --> 01:19:04,416
Hey, my name is Riaz!

1279
01:19:04,541 --> 01:19:06,041
Why would I want to kill Iqbal?

1280
01:19:06,416 --> 01:19:07,166
Then, what is this?

1281
01:19:09,166 --> 01:19:10,041
Vijay again?

1282
01:19:10,166 --> 01:19:11,916
Why the hell are you calling me Vijay?

1283
01:19:11,916 --> 01:19:12,916
Hey, keep it down!

1284
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:14,916
Just answer the questions.
Do you understand?

1285
01:19:16,416 --> 01:19:17,041
OK.

1286
01:19:18,541 --> 01:19:19,666
You aren’t Vijay, you’re Riaz.

1287
01:19:20,541 --> 01:19:22,166
Why did you trap Rishi posing as Vijay?

1288
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:22,916
Rishi?!

1289
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:23,916
Who is Rishi?

1290
01:19:24,166 --> 01:19:26,041
Madam, I do construction work
in Istanbul.

1291
01:19:26,416 --> 01:19:28,041
I move labour from here to there!

1292
01:19:28,791 --> 01:19:30,291
Then, Iqbal and Haseena?

1293
01:19:30,416 --> 01:19:30,916
Madam,

1294
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:32,041
I am an NRI, OK?

1295
01:19:32,291 --> 01:19:33,791
I came to Hyderabad for my
daughter’s wedding.

1296
01:19:33,916 --> 01:19:35,416
If you have any questions,
talk to the embassy!

1297
01:19:35,791 --> 01:19:37,541
What’s there to talk?
Where’s your passport?

1298
01:19:37,541 --> 01:19:39,166
Look, you can’t talk to me like this!

1299
01:19:39,166 --> 01:19:40,416
Of course, I can!

1300
01:19:40,791 --> 01:19:41,916
Call my lawyer, then.

1301
01:19:42,041 --> 01:19:43,916
You are ‘some’ lawyer...
took so long to get here!

1302
01:19:44,041 --> 01:19:45,541
I’m here now, let it go!

1303
01:19:46,416 --> 01:19:47,416
If Vijay turned out to be Riaz,

1304
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:49,291
Neha could be some one else too.

1305
01:19:49,916 --> 01:19:52,416
I want this girl in different looks
and age groups!

1306
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:53,666
Send it to all the departments.

1307
01:19:53,916 --> 01:19:54,541
No need ma’am.

1308
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:55,541
I found Neha.

1309
01:19:58,041 --> 01:19:59,916
This is her digital footprint
and live footage.

1310
01:20:00,166 --> 01:20:02,916
But there’s a bus ticket booked to
Vijayawada under the name Maya!

1311
01:20:03,041 --> 01:20:03,666
When is the bus leaving?

1312
01:20:03,916 --> 01:20:04,291
Now!

1313
01:20:07,416 --> 01:20:08,041
Look out, Hima.

1314
01:20:11,916 --> 01:20:12,666
-: VIJAYAWADA :-

1315
01:20:13,291 --> 01:20:14,041
Madam, there!

1316
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:14,541
Vijayawada bus.

1317
01:20:14,916 --> 01:20:15,291
There!

1318
01:20:15,291 --> 01:20:16,166
-: VIJAYAWADA :-

1319
01:20:17,666 --> 01:20:18,416
Prahlad, why did you stop?

1320
01:20:19,041 --> 01:20:19,416
Go!

1321
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:22,541
Prahlad, go!

1322
01:20:25,541 --> 01:20:26,166
Mm...ma’am...

1323
01:20:39,916 --> 01:20:41,291
Madam, I don’t understand anything!

1324
01:20:41,541 --> 01:20:43,416
I work at a music shop.

1325
01:20:44,416 --> 01:20:45,166
Who is Iqbal?

1326
01:20:45,666 --> 01:20:46,291
and Vijay?

1327
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:47,416
Who are you for that matter?

1328
01:20:47,916 --> 01:20:48,791
I have no idea what
you are talking about!

1329
01:20:48,916 --> 01:20:50,791
Maya...err...Neha,

1330
01:20:50,916 --> 01:20:51,791
Why are you going to Vijayawada?

1331
01:20:52,166 --> 01:20:53,166
to a music shop there?

1332
01:20:55,041 --> 01:20:55,416
Madam,

1333
01:20:55,791 --> 01:20:56,791
Not Neha, it’s Maya.

1334
01:20:57,916 --> 01:20:59,666
All the details she gave are correct.

1335
01:21:07,791 --> 01:21:09,041
This is where he gave me, Divya!

1336
01:21:09,791 --> 01:21:10,291
Okay...

1337
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:14,166
A brown cover with a syringe and vials.

1338
01:21:18,041 --> 01:21:20,166
Shall we check some
medical shops nearby?

1339
01:21:21,541 --> 01:21:21,916
Yes!

1340
01:21:24,416 --> 01:21:24,916
Divya!

1341
01:21:27,166 --> 01:21:27,916
Pen and paper?

1342
01:21:28,666 --> 01:21:29,666
I think I can sketch him!

1343
01:21:34,041 --> 01:21:35,416
Guys, we just have one day!

1344
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:37,041
Hima... any update?

1345
01:21:37,041 --> 01:21:38,916
Madam, all that Maya said about the
music shop was fake.

1346
01:21:39,041 --> 01:21:39,916
I’m following her.

1347
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:41,166
Good. Don’t lose her.

1348
01:21:41,291 --> 01:21:41,791
Okay ma’am.

1349
01:21:50,291 --> 01:21:50,666
Proxy!

1350
01:21:50,916 --> 01:21:51,291
Ma’am!

1351
01:21:52,166 --> 01:21:54,416
Looks like Rishi and Divya are looking
for the guy who gave him the syringe.

1352
01:21:55,041 --> 01:21:55,916
Keep a close track on them.

1353
01:21:56,166 --> 01:21:56,916
Okay, ma’am.

1354
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:01,041
Prahlad!

1355
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:03,291
Riaz is right in front you.
Red shirt.

1356
01:22:03,791 --> 01:22:04,416
Got it, Proxy.

1357
01:22:22,416 --> 01:22:22,916
Excuse me!

1358
01:22:23,666 --> 01:22:24,666
did he work here?

1359
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:25,291
No.

1360
01:22:31,041 --> 01:22:31,916
Call everyone.

1361
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:36,166
Excuse me, do you recognize him?

1362
01:22:36,166 --> 01:22:37,416
Yeah, he is a delivery guy.

1363
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:39,291
Go straight and take a right.
You will find his house there.

1364
01:22:39,791 --> 01:22:40,166
Thank you.

1365
01:22:46,166 --> 01:22:46,541
Prahlad!

1366
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:49,291
Madam, Riaz is talking with someone
in Balanagar industrial area.

1367
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:49,916
Keep an eye on him.

1368
01:22:54,041 --> 01:22:55,541
Madam, she is going into 511.

1369
01:22:55,541 --> 01:22:57,291
Madam, by the way, where are you?

1370
01:22:57,791 --> 01:22:58,416
We are following Maya.

1371
01:23:01,416 --> 01:23:01,916
Hello!

1372
01:23:03,291 --> 01:23:04,791
You take care of Riaz.
I’ll call you back.

1373
01:23:05,166 --> 01:23:05,541
Madam...

1374
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:06,041
Madam...

1375
01:23:14,291 --> 01:23:14,666
Sir!

1376
01:23:16,416 --> 01:23:16,916
This guy...

1377
01:23:21,416 --> 01:23:22,041
Dad, who’s that?

1378
01:23:28,166 --> 01:23:28,541
Who are you?

1379
01:23:36,541 --> 01:23:37,291
What do you want?

1380
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:07,166
Why did you give the syringe?

1381
01:24:07,416 --> 01:24:08,666
Who asked you to give it?

1382
01:24:09,541 --> 01:24:10,791
He was in a mask just like this.

1383
01:24:11,541 --> 01:24:13,416
He paid me to do the delivery,
and I just did that.

1384
01:24:21,041 --> 01:24:21,416
I mean...

1385
01:24:21,916 --> 01:24:23,541
we both met on Tinder.

1386
01:24:23,916 --> 01:24:24,791
After that...

1387
01:24:25,291 --> 01:24:27,041
I found her in Rishi’s game...

1388
01:24:27,416 --> 01:24:29,166
We have very common interests.

1389
01:24:29,666 --> 01:24:32,166
But, if we meet in public places,

1390
01:24:32,791 --> 01:24:34,541
people might misunderstand.

1391
01:24:34,666 --> 01:24:35,416
If it’s a farm house like this,

1392
01:24:35,416 --> 01:24:36,291
they won’t misunderstand.

1393
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:37,416
Ha ha, yeah!

1394
01:24:51,916 --> 01:24:52,666
Customer care...

1395
01:24:54,041 --> 01:24:54,541
Sir,

1396
01:24:54,916 --> 01:24:56,416
- Satya madam is in the resort...
- I’m here sir!

1397
01:24:57,916 --> 01:24:58,541
Madam, you?

1398
01:24:59,041 --> 01:25:00,291
I’ve dealt with your sir,

1399
01:25:00,791 --> 01:25:02,041
you deal with Riaz!

1400
01:25:12,791 --> 01:25:13,666
What happened, Rishi?

1401
01:25:14,666 --> 01:25:15,041
Hey...

1402
01:25:15,791 --> 01:25:16,541
what happened?

1403
01:25:18,041 --> 01:25:18,541
Tell me!

1404
01:25:21,166 --> 01:25:22,291
My only hope, Divya.

1405
01:25:24,041 --> 01:25:24,416
It’s gone.

1406
01:25:26,416 --> 01:25:27,416
Nobody believed me.

1407
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:30,916
They will never, now!

1408
01:25:34,291 --> 01:25:35,291
I believed you,

1409
01:25:35,291 --> 01:25:36,416
and now I’m with you, aren’t I?

1410
01:25:38,916 --> 01:25:39,416
Rishi...

1411
01:25:40,166 --> 01:25:41,166
Whatever may happen,

1412
01:25:42,416 --> 01:25:43,666
I will be with you.

1413
01:25:44,666 --> 01:25:45,541
Stay strong!

1414
01:25:46,166 --> 01:25:46,666
Hmm?

1415
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:48,666
Hmm.

1416
01:25:56,791 --> 01:25:57,041
Hi!

1417
01:25:57,291 --> 01:25:58,041
Darling, where are you?

1418
01:25:58,666 --> 01:25:59,666
It’s our wedding anniversary.

1419
01:25:59,916 --> 01:26:00,541
Do you remember?

1420
01:26:01,791 --> 01:26:02,541
Stop it, Amar!

1421
01:26:02,916 --> 01:26:03,541
How can I forget?

1422
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:06,416
OK, I’m preparing dinner.
Come home soon.

1423
01:26:06,916 --> 01:26:07,916
Hmm...coming.

1424
01:26:08,666 --> 01:26:09,666
Prahlad is not reachable.

1425
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:11,541
Just a routine check.

1426
01:26:11,791 --> 01:26:12,583
Hello...

1427
01:26:15,291 --> 01:26:15,916
Hello?

1428
01:26:16,791 --> 01:26:17,666
Satya, can you hear me?

1429
01:26:18,166 --> 01:26:18,541
Hello?

1430
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:19,291
No signal there?

1431
01:26:19,916 --> 01:26:20,291
Hello?

1432
01:26:20,541 --> 01:26:20,916
Hello?

1433
01:26:21,791 --> 01:26:22,666
Amar, I’ll call you later.

1434
01:26:38,416 --> 01:26:39,791
Satya surrendered there...

1435
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:41,541
not because she could not fight...

1436
01:26:41,791 --> 01:26:43,416
but to learn the true colors of Riaz.

1437
01:26:43,916 --> 01:26:45,416
They brought another one.

1438
01:26:46,166 --> 01:26:48,166
Oh no...who could that be?

1439
01:26:49,166 --> 01:26:50,166
Will you go check?

1440
01:26:50,791 --> 01:26:52,541
No, no...I’m scared!

1441
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:53,666
Shh...

1442
01:26:54,416 --> 01:26:55,416
Silence, everyone!

1443
01:26:55,541 --> 01:26:56,541
I’ll go check.

1444
01:27:10,416 --> 01:27:11,291
I’ll talk ma’am.

1445
01:27:12,041 --> 01:27:12,916
I’ll tell the truth, ma’am.

1446
01:27:13,666 --> 01:27:15,791
They are planning to sell all
the girls to Istanbul, ma’am.

1447
01:27:16,166 --> 01:27:17,041
Where does he live?

1448
01:27:17,541 --> 01:27:18,041
Istanbul.

1449
01:27:18,916 --> 01:27:19,666
What exactly happened?

1450
01:27:20,166 --> 01:27:20,541
Well...

1451
01:27:21,666 --> 01:27:24,041
He tried to destroy Haseena’s life.

1452
01:27:24,541 --> 01:27:28,666
He promised to get her a job in Dubai,
but he wanted to sell her.

1453
01:28:17,791 --> 01:28:18,791
Hey, give me your dupatta.

1454
01:28:19,041 --> 01:28:19,666
here...tie it tight!

1455
01:28:19,916 --> 01:28:21,291
Take my dupatta too.

1456
01:28:21,666 --> 01:28:22,791
Here...hold this.

1457
01:28:32,416 --> 01:28:32,791
Come...

1458
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:21,166
Go!

1459
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:22,541
Dump them all inside!

1460
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:26,291
Girls...

1461
01:31:27,666 --> 01:31:28,166
Remember...

1462
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:40,416
‘SHE Safe’ App...

1463
01:31:42,291 --> 01:31:43,791
I installed it for myself...

1464
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:54,291
For your safety,

1465
01:31:54,291 --> 01:31:55,541
you should do it too!

1466
01:31:59,166 --> 01:31:59,916
Your safety...

1467
01:32:00,541 --> 01:32:01,166
is our responsibility!

1468
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:43,375
Ma’am!

1469
01:32:43,375 --> 01:32:46,750
I watched you on TV,
talking about this app.

1470
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,125
You will never learn!

1471
01:32:48,875 --> 01:32:49,875
Why did you do that to Iqbal?

1472
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:50,750
Iqbal?

1473
01:32:51,375 --> 01:32:52,625
I didn’t do anything to Iqbal!

1474
01:32:53,125 --> 01:32:54,500
I’m just doing some
small side businesses...

1475
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:55,875
Business with girls?

1476
01:32:58,250 --> 01:32:59,750
I agree, what I did was wrong.

1477
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:01,625
I swear on Allah, madam!

1478
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,750
I have nothing to do with
what happened to Iqbal.

It’s really a Good Morning.

1483

Because, last night our SHE Teams

1484
01:33:16,125 --> 01:33:21,125
rescued twelve girls from the
clutches of a women trafficking gang.

1485

Really hats off to Hyderabad SHE Teams!

1486

Why are you wounded?

1487
01:33:39,875 --> 01:33:40,750
What happened Satya?

1488
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:44,500
I ran out of the three days
that Joseph sir gave me.

1489
01:33:45,625 --> 01:33:47,625
The case is not in my hands anymore.

1490
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:50,250
Case!

1491
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:52,250
You know what?

1492
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:54,000
You lost the case long back.

1493
01:33:56,875 --> 01:33:57,625
Yes Satya!

1494
01:33:58,625 --> 01:34:00,250
You have been on the hunt
since the day we got married.

1495
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,000
You are still on it.

1496
01:34:04,625 --> 01:34:05,500
Look at you!

1497
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:11,750
Is there anything other than
this case since our marriage?

1498
01:34:12,875 --> 01:34:14,250
Everyday abuse...murders...

1499
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:15,500
some crime or the other
keeps happening.

1500
01:34:16,875 --> 01:34:18,125
You deal with a lot of cases.

1501
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:20,000
Haseena’s case is just one of them.

1502
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,250
Why Haseena? Why this case?

1503
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:23,125
Tell me one reason!

1504
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:25,125
Tell me Satya, speak up!

1505
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:26,625
Just tell me, damnit!

1506
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:31,250
There is nothing more important
to me than you,

1507
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:32,375
but for you…

1508
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:33,875
She was pregnant.

1509
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:35,625
What!?

1510
01:34:57,250 --> 01:35:00,625
Unable to disclose this information
to Haseena’s family,

1511
01:35:00,625 --> 01:35:03,375
I felt tormented...

1512
01:35:03,375 --> 01:35:08,000
and kept drifting away from my
desire to have children, Amar.

1513
01:35:14,875 --> 01:35:15,875
Satya...

1514
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,875
He knew it and still killed her.

1515
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,250
He didn’t kill Haseena alone.

1516
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:33,625
How can I leave him like that,
Amar?

1517
01:35:35,125 --> 01:35:36,375
How can I let it go?

This is his condition at a

1554
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:11,750
I’ll update you the details.

1555
01:38:15,375 --> 01:38:16,000
Satya!

1556
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:17,750
What?

1557
01:38:17,750 --> 01:38:18,250
Come here.

1558
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:24,500
Something is off
about this chat, Satya.

1559
01:38:25,875 --> 01:38:27,000
What are you doing
with this data?

1560
01:38:27,375 --> 01:38:28,250
I got it from Hima.

1561
01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:29,375
- What?
- Listen to me!

1562
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:30,750
Sit down.

1563
01:38:31,625 --> 01:38:32,500
Typing pattern!

1564
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:33,500
What?

1565
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:34,750
Now, look at this...

1566
01:38:35,125 --> 01:38:36,625
You use a lot of dots.

1567
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,250
and I use quite a bit of emojis.

1568
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,250
This happens involuntarily.

1569
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:42,125
So?

1570
01:38:42,625 --> 01:38:43,500
So look at this...

1571
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:46,000
Vijay is writing ‘Okay’ as ‘Okie’.

1572
01:38:46,125 --> 01:38:48,500
Neha is also writing ‘Okay’ as ‘Okie’.

1573
01:38:48,875 --> 01:38:49,500
And...

1574
01:38:50,375 --> 01:38:53,625
both of them are writing
‘night’ as ‘ni8’.

1575
01:38:53,625 --> 01:38:55,250
Why are they both talking
in the same style?

1576
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:57,375
Or...

1577
01:38:57,875 --> 01:38:59,750
is one person acting as
two different people?

1578
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:03,375
Hey...

1579
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
Sherlock!

1580
01:39:05,875 --> 01:39:06,750
I’ll just be back.

1581
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:08,875
You naughty fellow!

1582
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:10,500
My laptop...hmm!

1583
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:20,375
Thomas?

1584
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:21,375
Ma’am,

1585
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:22,250
I found Yedhu!

1586
01:39:40,125 --> 01:39:42,500
OK then, the baby must be up.
I’ll get going now.

1587
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:43,000
Okay.

1588
01:39:44,875 --> 01:39:45,500
Did you bring it?

1589
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:19,500
Shh!

1590
01:40:19,875 --> 01:40:21,000
Yedhu...Where is Yedhu?

1591
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:21,875
That’s my husband.

1592
01:40:21,875 --> 01:40:22,750
- Yedhu?
- Who is Yedhu?

1593
01:40:22,875 --> 01:40:24,000
He’s Sekhar!

1594
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:26,500
Sekhar?

1595
01:40:28,875 --> 01:40:29,750
What happened to him?

1596
01:40:30,375 --> 01:40:31,750
One year ago,

1597
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:32,875
he met with an accident.

1598
01:40:32,875 --> 01:40:34,500
He isn’t able to get up since then.

1599
01:40:43,125 --> 01:40:44,250
Sorry ma’am!

1600
01:40:44,875 --> 01:40:46,125
He’s Sekhar, apparently.

1601
01:40:48,875 --> 01:40:50,125
It’s not the girl
that changed this time.

1602
01:40:51,250 --> 01:40:52,125
It’s his name!

1603
01:40:52,875 --> 01:40:54,125
You are not wrong, Thomas.

1604
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:55,250
He is Yedhu, indeed!

1605
01:41:45,125 --> 01:41:47,375
She doesn’t even know that
his name is Yedhu, ma’am.

1606
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,250
Looks like he took
good care of her.

1607
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,500
All of a sudden,
he fell sick one day...

1608
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:52,500
and his condition deteriorated
slowly to this stage.

1609
01:41:52,750 --> 01:41:54,375
On their doctor’s suggestion,

1610
01:41:54,625 --> 01:41:56,375
she brought him here for treatment.

1611
01:42:01,125 --> 01:42:03,250
Madam, remember Divya’s classmate,
Abhinav?

1612
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:05,500
This is his condition at a
hospital in Vizag.

1613
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:13,250
Hey, you click it.

1614
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:15,250
I wanna be a doctor too, ma’am.

1615
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:29,750
Yeah, Satya...

1616
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:31,375
Is the letter ‘L’
missing in their chats?

1617
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:32,000
What?

1618
01:42:32,375 --> 01:42:35,000
In Rishi’s chats with Neha and Vijay,
is the alphabet ‘L’ missing?

1619
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,250
Hold on, let me check.

1620
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:46,625
Not always.

1621
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:47,750
Only some times.

1622
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:50,125
Why are they both talking
in the same style?

1623
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:52,625
Or...

1624
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,750
Is one person acting like
two different people?

1625
01:42:58,375 --> 01:42:59,500
Doctor or Engineer?

1626
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:01,875
He is the doctor, isn’t he?

1627
01:43:01,875 --> 01:43:02,375
Yes.

1628
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:07,875
Doctor, ma’am.

1629

1630

...this case’s accused Rishi Reddy
is out on bail,

1631
01:44:04,916 --> 01:44:06,416
and is at large for a few days.

1632
01:44:06,416 --> 01:44:08,416
The Police continue to search for him.

1633
01:44:08,666 --> 01:44:11,166
Although this case is under the
purview of Crime branch DCP AnandRao,

1634
01:44:11,166 --> 01:44:14,666
ACP Satyabhama’s investigation
uncovered some crucial clues,

1635
01:44:14,666 --> 01:44:15,666
according to sources.

1636
01:44:16,291 --> 01:44:19,041
She says she will nab
the criminal at any cost.

1637
01:44:19,541 --> 01:44:21,041
Ma’am, why are you keeping
this case updates a secret?

1638
01:44:21,041 --> 01:44:22,416
Are you not in good terms with DCP Anand Rao?

1639
01:44:22,416 --> 01:44:23,541
Ma’am, did you find out where Rishi is?
Tell us, ma’am!

1640
01:44:23,541 --> 01:44:25,208
Are you responsible for that girl’s death?

1641
01:44:25,208 --> 01:44:25,833
Ramakanth Reddy’s party...

1642
01:44:25,833 --> 01:44:27,583
You couldn’t find any clue
about the culprit...

1643
01:44:27,583 --> 01:44:29,041
did you give up on this case?

1644
01:44:31,166 --> 01:44:31,666
Never!

1645
01:44:48,291 --> 01:44:50,916

is busy.”

1646
01:44:53,875 --> 01:44:54,375
Hima!

1647
01:44:55,208 --> 01:44:55,958
OK ma’am.

1648
01:45:15,916 --> 01:45:16,666
Satya,

1649
01:45:17,166 --> 01:45:17,916
listen to me...

1650
01:45:18,916 --> 01:45:20,291
More than finding out
who did that,

1651
01:45:20,666 --> 01:45:22,541
it’s important to know
why they did it.

1652
01:45:24,291 --> 01:45:24,916
At this moment,

1653
01:45:25,791 --> 01:45:28,291
what you need is to think well
rather than act in fury.

1654
01:45:28,916 --> 01:45:29,416
But...

1655
01:45:29,666 --> 01:45:31,416
Thought or a weapon?

1656
01:45:32,166 --> 01:45:33,416
You know which one to use.

1657
01:45:34,916 --> 01:45:36,291
The decision is yours!

1658
01:46:24,291 --> 01:46:25,041
White Brownie!

1659
01:46:25,416 --> 01:46:26,041
Will you sell it?

1660
01:46:26,041 --> 01:46:26,916
No. I’ll buy it.

1661
01:46:27,791 --> 01:46:28,791
I want to know who sells it.

1662
01:46:29,041 --> 01:46:30,666
Yedhu. Only he used to sell.

1663
01:46:30,791 --> 01:46:31,791
He is absconding though.

1664
01:46:32,291 --> 01:46:34,416
Search near Maharashtra,
Goa, Karnataka border.

1665
01:46:34,416 --> 01:46:35,166
You may find him.

Did they discharge you!?

1687
01:48:57,291 --> 01:48:58,291
How did you come?

1688
01:48:58,291 --> 01:48:59,916
Is Imran Uncle here, too?

1689
01:49:00,666 --> 01:49:02,541
I thought you would be
by my side when I woke up!

1690
01:49:07,291 --> 01:49:07,916
Blood!

1691
01:49:08,166 --> 01:49:08,916
Sit down.

1692
01:49:12,041 --> 01:49:13,875
Wait, I’ll bring First Aid.

1693
01:49:23,583 --> 01:49:24,083
Divya!

1694
01:49:24,833 --> 01:49:25,583
Where’s aunty?

1695
01:49:26,083 --> 01:49:27,458
She went to Srisailam,

1696
01:49:27,458 --> 01:49:29,208
to pray for your recovery.

1697
01:49:44,791 --> 01:49:45,416
Divya!

1698
01:49:45,666 --> 01:49:46,541
Divya, finally! Vijay...

1699
01:49:49,083 --> 01:49:49,583
Iqbal?

1700
01:49:50,458 --> 01:49:51,458
When did you come?

1701
01:49:52,041 --> 01:49:53,041
I’m really sorry.

1702
01:49:53,666 --> 01:49:55,166
I didn’t do this on purpose.

1703
01:49:55,791 --> 01:49:58,541
I didn’t mean to do that.
Please, try to understand.

1704
01:49:59,666 --> 01:50:01,666
Divya, he sent a message again.

1705
01:50:01,666 --> 01:50:02,291
What?

1706
01:50:02,416 --> 01:50:04,666
“Iqbal is downstairs,
what are you doing?”- he says!

1707
01:50:04,791 --> 01:50:05,541
Who?

1708
01:50:05,791 --> 01:50:06,541
Vijay?

1709
01:50:06,541 --> 01:50:07,416
Hmm.

1710
01:50:20,166 --> 01:50:20,666
What?

1711
01:50:28,666 --> 01:50:29,166
You...

1712
01:50:30,541 --> 01:50:30,791
Hey!

1713
01:50:30,916 --> 01:50:31,291
Rishi!

1714
01:50:31,666 --> 01:50:32,791
-Stop it!
-Why did you do this?

1715
01:50:33,416 --> 01:50:35,041
Why did you come here, huh?

1716
01:50:35,916 --> 01:50:36,666
Guys, stop!

1717
01:50:36,666 --> 01:50:37,583
What do you want?

1718
01:50:38,041 --> 01:50:39,291
Guys, let’s sit and talk!

1719
01:50:40,166 --> 01:50:41,416
Stop it, both of you!

1720
01:50:43,791 --> 01:50:44,666
Why did you come?

1721
01:50:45,416 --> 01:50:46,541
Rishi, stop!

1722
01:50:46,791 --> 01:50:47,541
Speak up!

1723
01:50:49,666 --> 01:50:51,416
Iqbal, why aren’t you
saying anything?

1724
01:50:53,916 --> 01:50:54,416
Rishi?

1725
01:50:55,916 --> 01:50:56,416
Rishi...

1726
01:50:58,916 --> 01:50:59,791
Rishi, what happened?

1727
01:51:03,416 --> 01:51:04,416
Rishi, what’s wrong?

1728
01:51:06,166 --> 01:51:06,791
Rishi!

1729
01:51:10,666 --> 01:51:11,291
Rishi?

1730
01:51:25,416 --> 01:51:25,958
Iqbal...

1731
01:51:26,166 --> 01:51:26,833
Terrorist!

1732
01:51:27,916 --> 01:51:29,166
So easy to believe, isn’t it?

1733
01:51:39,041 --> 01:51:39,916
Sedative...

1734
01:51:39,916 --> 01:51:40,916
I gave him just one ml.

1735
01:51:40,916 --> 01:51:43,166
Don’t worry.
I’ll give the rest now!

1736
01:51:50,041 --> 01:51:51,541
How happy we were, Divya!

1737
01:51:52,541 --> 01:51:53,166
You...

1738
01:51:53,541 --> 01:51:54,041
me...

1739
01:51:55,291 --> 01:51:56,166
our hospital...

1740
01:51:59,208 --> 01:52:01,000
This idiot, and his games!

1741
01:52:01,666 --> 01:52:02,916
How did you fall for him, Divya?

1742
01:52:03,166 --> 01:52:04,916
Why are you doing all this?

1743
01:52:06,458 --> 01:52:07,583
For you, Divya!

1744
01:52:09,041 --> 01:52:12,291
I... I never saw you that way, Iqbal!

1745
01:52:12,916 --> 01:52:13,416
How?

1746
01:52:15,291 --> 01:52:15,666
Oh!

1747
01:52:17,291 --> 01:52:19,416
You think all this is love?

1748
01:52:21,291 --> 01:52:23,041
I didn’t see you that way, either!

1749
01:52:23,291 --> 01:52:25,041
Chotu, for the sake of his loved ones,

1750
01:52:25,291 --> 01:52:27,166
he could go to any extent.

1751
01:52:27,416 --> 01:52:30,916
He travelled a lot,
and achieved what he wanted.

1752
01:52:31,166 --> 01:52:32,916
Hmm...that’s enough.

1753
01:52:33,291 --> 01:52:34,291
Go to sleep.

1754
01:52:34,291 --> 01:52:35,666
Tell me more!

1755
01:52:35,666 --> 01:52:37,291
It’s getting late, Chotu!

1756
01:52:37,666 --> 01:52:38,666
Go to sleep now.

1757
01:52:40,166 --> 01:52:42,666
I feel scared when you aren’t around.

1758
01:52:49,791 --> 01:52:51,541
You are growing up, dear!

1759
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:55,791
You shouldn’t be scared.

1760
01:52:55,958 --> 01:52:58,416
There...now it’s as good as
I’m with you.

1761
01:53:07,791 --> 01:53:09,666
Having our loved ones with us...

1762
01:53:10,041 --> 01:53:11,291
gives us courage, Divya.

1763
01:53:13,041 --> 01:53:15,416
Don’t mix it up with Love,

1764
01:53:15,666 --> 01:53:16,666
and belittle it.

1765
01:53:17,666 --> 01:53:21,291
I felt the same when
Rishi was next to me.

1766
01:53:21,916 --> 01:53:23,291
What did he do?

1767
01:53:25,541 --> 01:53:26,041
Hey, tell me!

1768
01:53:26,416 --> 01:53:26,916
Yedhu,

1769
01:53:27,416 --> 01:53:28,166
we are done!

1770
01:53:28,166 --> 01:53:30,083
When I’m speaking with you,
why is he interfering?

1771
01:53:30,083 --> 01:53:31,041
Heh..why is he coming in between?

1772
01:53:31,041 --> 01:53:31,791
Yedhu, please!

1773
01:53:31,791 --> 01:53:32,916
Rishi, listen to me!

1774
01:53:32,916 --> 01:53:34,416
Rishi, let me talk!

1775
01:53:34,416 --> 01:53:34,916
HEY!

1776
01:53:39,916 --> 01:53:41,916
When my sister was no more,
you were there for me...

1777
01:53:42,416 --> 01:53:43,541
you will be there forever.

1778
01:53:44,666 --> 01:53:46,541
But now, if someone
comes all of a sudden and,

1779
01:53:47,083 --> 01:53:49,416
poses as a sister and
expects me to forget everything?

1780
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,041
How can I forget?

1781
01:53:52,791 --> 01:53:53,791
Never!

1782
01:54:13,541 --> 01:54:14,041
Iqbal!

1783
01:54:17,708 --> 01:54:18,541
Iqbal, no!

1784
01:54:19,958 --> 01:54:20,791
Iqbal, please!

1785
01:54:27,041 --> 01:54:28,666
Thought or weapon?

1786
01:54:29,583 --> 01:54:30,583
The decision is yours.

1787
01:54:47,416 --> 01:54:47,916
Iqbal!

1788
01:54:58,291 --> 01:54:58,791
Chotu!

1789
01:55:01,291 --> 01:55:02,166
Don’t call me that.

1790
01:55:02,916 --> 01:55:03,416
Why?

1791
01:55:03,916 --> 01:55:05,166
What do you know about me,

1792
01:55:05,791 --> 01:55:06,916
that you call me Chotu?

1793
01:55:07,166 --> 01:55:08,041
I know.

1794
01:55:08,666 --> 01:55:09,666
I alone know...

1795
01:55:09,916 --> 01:55:10,666
Chotu!

1796
01:55:10,666 --> 01:55:11,916
Don’t you get it?

1797
01:55:12,833 --> 01:55:14,041
Didn’t I tell you not to call me that?

1798
01:55:14,541 --> 01:55:15,666
How else should I call you?

1799
01:55:16,666 --> 01:55:17,416
Vijay?

1800
01:55:20,916 --> 01:55:21,416
Or...

1801
01:55:22,041 --> 01:55:22,916
Neha?

1802
01:55:25,166 --> 01:55:26,250
Can I buy you a drink?

1803
01:55:26,333 --> 01:55:27,291
I have a girlfriend.

1804
01:55:27,291 --> 01:55:28,166
I just said hi...

1805
01:55:28,166 --> 01:55:29,416
did I ask about your girlfriend?

1806
01:55:29,416 --> 01:55:30,041
However,

1807
01:55:30,041 --> 01:55:31,666
why worry about your girlfriend
when I’m here?

1808
01:55:38,125 --> 01:55:39,083
And then...

1809
01:55:39,250 --> 01:55:41,083
after meeting Akhtar,
you realized that...

1810
01:55:42,708 --> 01:55:44,416
you could take advantage of your name.

1811
01:55:45,541 --> 01:55:46,166
Iqbal...

1812
01:55:46,791 --> 01:55:47,416
Terrorist!

1813
01:55:48,541 --> 01:55:49,916
It’s so easy to believe, isn’t it?

1814
01:55:51,541 --> 01:55:52,791
Then you brought in Riaz...

1815
01:55:52,916 --> 01:55:53,541
as...

1816
01:55:53,916 --> 01:55:55,416
ATS officer Vijay.

1817
01:55:55,708 --> 01:55:56,250
Who is this?

1818
01:55:56,416 --> 01:55:57,541
My brother-in-law.

1819
01:55:57,916 --> 01:55:58,541
A while ago,

1820
01:55:58,541 --> 01:55:59,916
he promised to find
a job for Haseena.

1821
01:56:00,291 --> 01:56:00,791
Forget it.

1822
01:56:00,916 --> 01:56:01,791
What exactly happened?

1823
01:56:01,791 --> 01:56:03,041
Send her to Dubai with me.

1824
01:56:03,833 --> 01:56:04,541
Dubai?

1825
01:56:04,916 --> 01:56:06,166
Everything will be alright,
brother-in-law.

1826
01:56:06,916 --> 01:56:08,291
I’ll take care of everything
over there.

1827
01:56:08,750 --> 01:56:09,416
But Riaz...

1828
01:56:09,958 --> 01:56:12,166
wanted to traffick Haseena too.

1829
01:56:13,291 --> 01:56:14,541
How could you do that?

1830
01:56:14,541 --> 01:56:16,166
You could have ruined Haseena’s life!

1831
01:56:16,375 --> 01:56:17,416
Aren’t we family?

1832
01:56:17,583 --> 01:56:19,166
And to get back at Riaz,

1833
01:56:19,833 --> 01:56:21,166
you turned him into Vijay.

1834
01:56:25,416 --> 01:56:26,541
Rishi, listen to me.

1835
01:56:26,666 --> 01:56:27,291
I’m Vijay.

1836
01:56:27,666 --> 01:56:29,416
ACP, Anti Terrorist Squad, Dehradun.

1837
01:56:29,666 --> 01:56:30,916
Who do you think Neha is?

1838
01:56:31,541 --> 01:56:32,791
She honey-trapped you.

1839
01:56:34,166 --> 01:56:35,041
And then,

1840
01:56:35,541 --> 01:56:39,041
you planned for Rishi to
kidnap you, quite cleverly.

1841
01:56:39,416 --> 01:56:41,791
Vijay, I dropped Iqbal at the
location you asked me to.

1842
01:56:41,916 --> 01:56:42,666
I’m done!

1843
01:56:50,916 --> 01:56:52,791
But things didn’t pan out
according to your plan.

1844
01:56:53,041 --> 01:56:53,708
When I found you,

1845
01:56:53,708 --> 01:56:55,041
I was worried what happened to you!

1846
01:56:56,333 --> 01:56:56,916
Iqbal!

1847
01:56:57,625 --> 01:56:58,291
Iqbal!

1848
01:56:58,708 --> 01:56:59,916
When I found this,

1849
01:56:59,916 --> 01:57:02,041
I suspected you.

1850
01:57:07,541 --> 01:57:09,666
Yedhu had evaded capture
for very long,

1851
01:57:09,666 --> 01:57:12,041
but you made me realize
where to look for him!

1852
01:57:12,916 --> 01:57:14,791
That’s not the place
you should be searching!

1853
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:16,291
It’s Hyderabad.

1854
01:57:18,708 --> 01:57:20,791
Looking for Yedhu who
cheated your sister,

1855
01:57:20,791 --> 01:57:21,791
you reached Maya.

1856
01:57:22,541 --> 01:57:25,541
I even know why you
setup Maya as Neha.

1857
01:57:25,666 --> 01:57:26,666
Do you know how?

1858
01:57:30,375 --> 01:57:32,541
Did anyone come looking
for your tattoo?

1859
01:57:32,541 --> 01:57:33,416
There was one guy, ma’am.

1860
01:57:33,791 --> 01:57:35,416
You look much younger than
your Tinder profile?

1861
01:57:35,791 --> 01:57:36,666
What’s this?

1862
01:57:36,666 --> 01:57:38,541
I want the guy who gave you
that tattoo.

1863
01:57:38,916 --> 01:57:39,458
Yedhu?

1864
01:57:39,750 --> 01:57:40,291
I don’t know.

1865
01:57:40,416 --> 01:57:41,416
He left me and went away.

1866
01:57:42,875 --> 01:57:44,291
With our story of searching for Yedhu,

1867
01:57:44,625 --> 01:57:45,791
if I was the one who started it,

1868
01:57:46,291 --> 01:57:47,666
you put an end to it much early.

1869
01:57:49,541 --> 01:57:50,416
Our story?

1870
01:57:51,291 --> 01:57:52,541
and you started it?

1871
01:57:59,458 --> 01:58:00,916
He’s taking these medicines, doctor.

1872
01:58:01,291 --> 01:58:03,041
But, he is not getting any better.

1873
01:58:16,041 --> 01:58:16,916
He’ll be fine.

1874
01:58:17,083 --> 01:58:17,791
Don’t worry.

1875
01:58:22,250 --> 01:58:24,416
We need to take him to Hyderabad.
Okay?

1876
01:58:28,166 --> 01:58:28,541
Be gentle!

1877
01:58:28,666 --> 01:58:28,916
Get in.

1878
01:58:53,791 --> 01:58:55,541
I was the one who started it,

1879
01:58:56,375 --> 01:58:57,791
and I was the one who ended it too!

1880
01:58:57,916 --> 01:58:59,291
If that was the end indeed,

1881
01:59:00,041 --> 01:59:01,916
this story wouldn’t have
come till Rishi.

1882
01:59:02,041 --> 01:59:03,291
That’s the mistake I made!

1883
01:59:03,833 --> 01:59:05,291
Instead of treating them all,

1884
01:59:05,291 --> 01:59:06,291
I should have killed them!

1885
01:59:06,291 --> 01:59:07,041
Is this why...

1886
01:59:07,708 --> 01:59:09,541
your sister wanted to see you
as a doctor?

1887
01:59:09,708 --> 01:59:10,916
He didn’t spare her to see that!

1888
01:59:11,291 --> 01:59:12,916
Now he will do the same to Divya!

1889
01:59:13,166 --> 01:59:14,541
Everybody is a Yedhu!

1890
01:59:15,875 --> 01:59:17,041
-Not everybody.
-Iqbal!

1891
01:59:17,583 --> 01:59:18,166
You!

1892
01:59:30,708 --> 01:59:33,791
You only saw fear for Yedhu,
in Haseena.

1893
01:59:34,125 --> 01:59:38,291
I saw the pain she endured, for not
being able to save the truth in her womb.

1894
01:59:41,916 --> 01:59:42,375
It’s true!

1895
01:59:42,875 --> 01:59:44,041
You only had one sister.

1896
01:59:45,541 --> 01:59:47,291
She didn’t die alone.

1897
01:59:48,166 --> 01:59:49,166
A beast,

1898
01:59:49,416 --> 01:59:51,666
in spite of knowing that she was about to
become a mother, killed her.

1899
02:00:33,791 --> 02:00:35,416
Tell me a story, sister.

1900
02:00:37,666 --> 02:00:39,291
Once up on a time, a death!

1901
02:00:39,291 --> 02:00:41,166
Ignited vengeance in one...

1902
02:00:41,416 --> 02:00:44,041
and left repentance in another.

1903
02:00:44,166 --> 02:00:48,041
They both set out to find the beast
responsible for the death,

1904
02:00:48,416 --> 02:00:50,041
and entered a dark jungle.

1905
02:00:50,541 --> 02:00:53,666
While one fought with
that darkness for light,

1906
02:00:54,041 --> 02:00:57,666
the other one turned into a beast
himself while hunting for it,

1907
02:00:57,791 --> 02:01:00,666
and became the darkness
that engulfed the light.

1908
02:01:04,416 --> 02:01:05,916
If Haseena was in my place today,

1909
02:01:06,791 --> 02:01:07,791
she would have done the same.

1910
02:01:24,041 --> 02:01:29,041
♪ I witnessed all the
little stars in your smile ♪

1911
02:01:29,041 --> 02:01:35,166
♪ but those stars slipped away
like teardrops ♪

1912
02:01:36,166 --> 02:01:41,166

everlasting friendship ♪

1913
02:01:41,166 --> 02:01:46,041

1914
02:01:46,041 --> 02:01:50,916

1915

1916
02:01:56,041 --> 02:02:00,916

1917
02:02:46,291 --> 02:02:47,041
Iqbal!

1918
02:02:51,291 --> 02:02:52,666
It is in the right hands, indeed!

1919
02:02:54,291 --> 02:02:55,291
Ma’am, gun!

1920
02:03:02,625 --> 02:03:04,166
Ma’am, magazine?

1921
02:03:04,166 --> 02:03:06,666
Madam never used the gun
since Haseena’s death.

1922
02:03:17,541 --> 02:03:18,666
That Satyabhama,

1923
02:03:18,791 --> 02:03:20,666
slayed Narakasura
with her weapons.

1924
02:03:22,166 --> 02:03:23,291
This Satyabhama,

1925
02:03:23,666 --> 02:03:24,666
gave up her weapons,

1926
02:03:25,166 --> 02:03:26,791
and triumphed in a war.

1927
02:03:33,708 --> 02:03:34,416
Sir, selfie!

1928
02:03:36,541 --> 02:03:37,416
- Thank you, sir!
- Amar sir!

1929
02:03:38,333 --> 02:03:38,708
Hey!

1930
02:03:39,666 --> 02:03:41,541
That was wonderful,
what you said about ma’am!

1931
02:03:41,750 --> 02:03:42,500
Of Course!

1932
02:03:42,750 --> 02:03:45,916
Who knows Satyabhama
better than Sri Krishna?

1933
02:03:47,166 --> 02:03:47,750
Thank you.

1934
02:03:52,791 --> 02:03:53,291
Amar?

1935
02:03:53,666 --> 02:03:55,416
Satya, where are you?

1936
02:03:55,541 --> 02:03:56,291
You are coming, aren’t you?

1937
02:03:56,416 --> 02:03:57,791
Just two minutes.
I’m coming!

1938
02:03:58,041 --> 02:03:59,166
Two minutes again?

1939
02:03:59,166 --> 02:04:00,041
Satya, come in!

1940
02:04:00,041 --> 02:04:01,166
Amar, stay on the line.

1941
02:04:01,166 --> 02:04:01,708
Okay!

1942
02:04:03,166 --> 02:04:03,916
Tell me, sir.

1943
02:04:04,166 --> 02:04:06,041
They are asking us to form
the crime team again.

1944
02:04:06,166 --> 02:04:07,541
Apparently, a stubborn case!

1945
02:04:12,375 --> 02:04:13,166
What do we do?
