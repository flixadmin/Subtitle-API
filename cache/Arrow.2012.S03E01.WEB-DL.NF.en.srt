These numbers show QC's performance
under Mr. Queen's management.

00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,267
I'm using that term extremely loosely, BTW...

these numbers aren't sanitized for Wall Street.

But the truth is, this company's woes
are a symptom of a much larger problem.

393
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,286
And that problem is Starling City.

394
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:24,791
Queen Consolidated can't hope to survive
if the city it's located in is dying.

Nobody wants to live here anymore.

397
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,800
And after two terrorist attacks,
who can blame them?

398
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:37,387
This city still needs saving.

399
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:40,473
And that is my vision for this company.

400
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,684
To not only see it rise from the ashes...

401
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,438
...but to take this city with it
to that new horizon.

402
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:50,025
And that new day has a name.

00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,832
So did I, but maybe the company's
better off with Dr. Palmer.

406
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,794
I couldn't make time for QC last year,
trying to get the company back now is selfish.

407
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,005
It's something that
the old me would have done.

408
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,549
If the past 12 hours
have reminded me of anything...

409
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,303
...it's that I made the decision
to put Oliver Queen aside and be the Arrow.

410
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,888
It's not a choice I can unmake.

Oliver. The explosion wasn't your fault.

When Werner hit me with the Vertigo dart...

414
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:32,233
...he told me that his formula,
it shows us our worst fear.

I saw myself.

You don't really think
you're afraid of yourself, do you?

00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:42,327
I think I'm scared of what would happen
if I let myself be Oliver Queen.
