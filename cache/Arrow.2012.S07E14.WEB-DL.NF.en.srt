FAMILY REUNION HERE, BRO.

157
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:22,174
OH, I'M SORRY, SIS,
BUT I HAVE COME TOO FAR

158

SO WE'RE HELPING EACH OTHER

159

WHETHER YOU WANT TO
OR NOT.

160
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,769
THE GHOST INITIATIVE SOUNDS
A LOT LIKE TASK FORCE X.

DIDN'T LYLA SHELVE
THAT YEARS AGO?

162

SHE DID,
BUT THERE'S NOW

163
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:41,235
A MORE IMMEDIATE,
MORE DANGEROUS TARGET

164
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:44,071
THAT THE BRASS
AT A.R.G.U.S.,
EVEN ABOVE LYLA,

165
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,073
IS PREVENTING US
FROM PURSUING.

166

WE'RE USING
THE GHOST INITIATIVE

TO GO AFTER
THIS TARGET

168
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,286
WITHOUT THEIR
OVERSIGHT.

169

WELL, I LOVE
A SPONTANEOUS OTA MOMENT

AS THE NEXT PERSON,

COME HERE TO TELL US

172
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,336
ABOUT RESURRECTING
AN OLD A.R.G.U.S.
DEFUNCT PROGRAM, DID YOU?

173
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:01,296
IT'S NOT
ABOUT THE PROGRAM.

174
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,423

WHO THREATENED

178
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,766

MY ENTIRE FAMILY?

179
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,018
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT WE HEAR WHAT
JOHN HAS TO SAY.

180
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,730

181

A MUCH LARGER THREAT.

182
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,319
DIAZ WAS THE ONLY ONE
WE COULD USE TO GET
CLOSE TO THIS GUY,

183
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,239
AND I PROMISE YOU
HE IS A MILLION
TIMES WORSE.

184
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,574

AROUND FREE RIGHT NOW
IN EXCHANGE FOR INTEL?

185
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,911
HE'S NOT FREE, FELICITY.
HE HAS A BOMB IN HIS HEAD.

186

A STEP LIKE THIS

194

NO OTHER CHOICE.

195

THERE WAS
NO OTHER CHOICE,

IT CAME TO THIS,

BELIEVE THAT USING

THE GHOST INITIATIVE IS
THE BEST WAY TO TAKE
DOWN THIS THREAT.

GET THE MEETING.

WHY DO YOU NEED ALL
THIS OLD JUNK?

309
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,831
BECAUSE AS ADVANCED
AS ARCHER IS,

310
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:11,874
IT WAS DESIGNED
FOR THE GLADES.

311
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,792
THIS SYSTEM WAS
BUILT FOR STAR CITY.

SO WHO AM I LOOKING
FOR AGAIN?

313
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,505
UH, SOME GUY.
PAUL LOISEAU.

314
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,508
SCPD HAS HIM LISTED
AS THE ONLY EYEWITNESS

315
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,510
TO FELICITY'S MURDER.

I'M GUESSING SHE PAID HIM
TO SAY SHE WAS THERE.

FELICITY'S DISAPPEARANCE.

BUT NOT THAT BAD.

SOMEONE'S TAKING
THESE PEOPLE OUT,
BUT WHY?

323
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,280
SO FELICITY UNCOVERS
A BOMB PLOT,

324
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,198
BUT BEFORE SHE
CAN TELL ANYBODY,

DINAH: BECAUSE THEY NEEDED HER.

328
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,374
YOU WERE THE LAST ONE
TO TALK TO FELICITY.
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

329
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,336
JUST THE USUAL

THE CITY'S NOT SAFE

00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,254
AND SHE WANTED ME
TO GET OUT OF TOWN.

A HERO'S FUNERAL.

764
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,674
THE OFFICIAL STORY IS
HE WAS AT THE EMBASSY

765
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,509
ON A COVERT ASSIGNMENT
THAT WENT AWRY.

766
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,845
RIGHT. SO IT'S
A COVER-UP.

767
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,513
OK. WHAT ABOUT
THE GHOST INITIATIVE?

768
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,807
-IT'S BEING SUSPENDED.
-WELL, THAT'S SOME GOOD NEWS.

769
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,600
THAT'S ALL THE GOOD NEWS.

770
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,644
WE LOST DANTE,
AND I LOST MY LAST
CHANCE TO GET HIM.

771
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,520
YOU DIDN'T LOSE
YOUR LAST CHANCE.

772
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,983
I'LL BE THE ONE
TO RESIGN.

773
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:53,192
LOOK. WE WILL TELL
THEM THAT I TOOK OUT

774
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,153
THE GHOST INITIATIVE
WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT

775
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,822
AND WITHOUT YOUR
KNOWLEDGE.

776
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,740
NO. THIS IS
MY RESPONSIBILITY.

777
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,784
LYLA, LISTEN
TO ME.

778
00:36:00,826 --> 00:36:04,037
WE HAVE NO IDEA
HOW FAR THIS
CONSPIRACY GOES.

779
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,580
IF YOU STEP DOWN
AS DIRECTOR,

780
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:09,084
WE MAY NEVER
FIND OUT THE TRUTH.

781
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:11,711
BEING TERMINATED
FOR AN OPSEC VIOLATION

782
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,880
WILL RUIN YOUR CAREER.

783
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:16,341
BUT YOU'LL STILL
HAVE YOURS.

784
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:19,011
LET ME TAKE
THIS FALL

785
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:20,971
FOR THE FAMILY.

786
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,434
OLIVER: HEY.

787
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,728
GLAD YOU CALLED.

788
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,355
THOUGHT YOU WERE
DONE WITH ME.

789
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:34,026
YEAH, I DID, TOO,
UNTIL I GOT THAT.

790
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,652
YEAH.

791
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:38,613
THANKS FOR HAVING RENE
BRING THAT OVER.

792
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,907
I'M SURE IT'S NOT
SCPD PROTOCOL

793
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,784
TO RELEASE
INTERROGATION RECORDS.

794
00:36:42,826 --> 00:36:44,703
-UH-UH.
-YEAH.

795
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,788
LEAST I COULD DO,
THOUGH.

796
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,874
IT IS YOUR MISSION.

797
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:55,130
IT'S...BEEN
HARD FOR ME

798
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:57,215
NOT SEEING YOU AS HIM.

799
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,675
HIM BEING OUR FATHER?

800
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,219
I JUST ASSUMED
I SHOULDN'T TRUST YOU.

801
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,222
THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN
KEEPING SO MUCH
DISTANCE BETWEEN US.

802
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,765
THEN YOU GIVE ME
A CHANCE,

803
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:08,185
AND I, OF COURSE,
IMMEDIATELY OVERSTEP.

804
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,728
PRETTY MUCH.

805
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:18,778
I'VE LOST A LOT
IN MY LIFE.

806
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,364
PEOPLE,
YOU KNOW, BUT...

807
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:26,619
WITH YOU,
I LOST TIME,

808
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,580
SO YOU GAVE ME A CHANCE,
AND I IMMEDIATELY SAW IT

809
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,499
AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO
GET SOME OF IT BACK,

810
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,376
BUT THERE WAS
NO EXCUSE FOR THE WAY

811
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:36,295
THAT I BEHAVED
WHEN I WAS COMING
ABOARD YOUR MISSION.

812
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:42,094
I'M SORRY.

813
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:44,804
I DIDN'T REALIZE
OLIVER QUEEN DID APOLOGIES.

814
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:48,600
WELL, I MEAN, I
DIDN'T, BUT I'VE...

815
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,643
GROWN A BIT
OVER THE YEARS.

816
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,566
SO? FILL ME IN.

817
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,110

HAVE SO FAR?

WHAT IS THAT?

830
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:38,691
I THINK IT'S
A MINI-CASSETTE.

831
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,945
MY GRANDPARENTS HAD
AN ANSWERING MACHINE
THAT USED THESE.

832
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:43,696
WHAT'S
AN ANSWERING MACHINE?

833
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,573
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

834
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:48,367
WHAT IS IMPORTANT
IS THE MESSAGE
THAT'S ON THIS TAPE.

835
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,911
CAN YOU HACK IT OR...

836
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:52,455
NO. YOU CAN'T
HACK THIS. HEH.

837
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:55,167
IT'S ENCRYPTION

838
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,960
IT'S PRETTY GENIUS,
ACTUALLY.

839
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,753
YEAH, SO GENIUS,
YOU CAN'T LISTEN TO IT.

840
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:01,006
-WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

BE THE KEY TO

850
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,738
A NIGHT THAT COULD HAVE
ENDED VERY DIFFERENTLY.

I WAS READY TO.

854
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:40,837
THEN I REALIZED
KILLING DIAZ

855
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,089
WASN'T GOING TO
PROVE ANYTHING.

856
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,342
THE WHOLE REASON
I WANTED DIAZ DEAD

857
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,552
WAS TO PROTECT
