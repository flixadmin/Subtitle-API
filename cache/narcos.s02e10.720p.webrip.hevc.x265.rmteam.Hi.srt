00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,960
Pablo...

164
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,630
I think the time has come.
We don't have a choice.

165
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,700
Turning yourself in
isn't the end of the world, my love.

166
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,010
You can survive prison.

167
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,290
We both know that won't happen.

168
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,600
[Hugo Jr.]
Stop, stop, stop, stop! Shh!

169
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,830
- [Tata] Listen to me, Pablo.
- They're talking.

170
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,840
- You will always be Pablo Escobar.
- Boss.

171
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,170
You will always be that man
that's admired and followed.

172
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,740
My man.

173
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,300
My love, there's a lot of journalists
who want to speak with you.

174
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,160
The people love you and follow you.

175
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,270
[Pablo]
Tata, Limón wants me off.

176
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,460
It's Escobar. Let's go west!
Fix the position, Morales.

177
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,550
My love, look at Nelson Mandela.

178
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,320
They put the man in jail,
but the people still believed in him.

179
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,320
They gave him the Nobel Prize.

180
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,330
They say he may even become president.
President, Pablo.

181
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,330
Of the same country that imprisoned him.

182
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,420
[Pablo] I need to hang up.
We'll talk about this later.

183
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,170
[Hugo Jr.]
Alvaro, stop. Stop for a second.

184
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,040
[Tata] All right, Pablo.
But think about what I'm saying.

185
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,000
It's very important.

186
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,070
It's our only way out really.

187
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,740
Alvaro, let's go slowly.

188
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,680
Colonel!
Colonel, this is Lieutenant Martinez.

189
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,680
Think about turning yourself in, my love.
Think of your family.

190
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,080
I'll think about it.

191
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,290
All right?

192
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,760
I love you very much.

193
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,250
Where are you going?

194
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,190
To Medellín.

195
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:31,760
What? No, no, no, Hermilda.
You can't leave.

196
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,630
My son needs me.

197
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,010
How so?

198
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,100
What you want...

199
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,980
for him to turn himself in
to those monsters...

200
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,870
I don't want them to kill him.

201
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,120
They're going to kill him either way,
and you know that.

202
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,790
They won't if he turns himself in.

203
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,750
- It's a trap! Tata, my God!
- Lower your voice.

204
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,670
No! No, ma'am.

205
00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:01,180
I will not stay quiet when...
when I see you... betraying my son!

206
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,080
I have never betrayed Pablo.
Let's make that very clear.

207
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,980
We're locked in this hotel
as if it were a jail.

208
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,040
We can't even leave the country.

209
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:17,050
And the only shot I have at
getting my children out of this alive...

210
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,050
is for Pablo to turn himself in.

211
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,440
My son...

212
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,020
needs his mother.

213
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,870
Hermilda.

214
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,250
Please be very careful. Please.

215
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,010
Tell the children...

216
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,430
[whispers] I'll tell them.

217
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,360
[in Spanish] We have intel
that Escobar is in this building.

218
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,950
Listen up. I want you to do
what you can to get him alive.

219
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,640
Escobar must be brought to justice
before the people of Colombia

220
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,460
and answer for the atrocious crimes
he has committed against this nation.

221
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,710
Now, if he resists...

222
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,550
if a single one of our men
is in harm's way...

223
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,280
I want you to take his life. Understood?

224
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,120
- [all] Yes, Colonel!
- Let's go.

225
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,970
[engines revving]

226
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,520
[Limón]
Everything all right, boss?

227
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,800
Tata wants me to surrender.

228
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,140
[sighs]
She said I can be like Nelson Mandela.

229
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,430
Nelson Mandela?

230
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,310
Who's that, boss?

231
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,110
Did you buy more rolling papers?

232
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,280
Sorry, no, boss.

233
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,130

I can't think with that
fucking smell of Chinese food in here.

237
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,930
[man over radio]
He's not here.

238
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,560
Come inside.
You can't risk being seen, sir.

239
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,610
This is my city, Limón.

240
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,320
These are my people.

241
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:37,200
Medellín will never betray me.

242
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,960
- [low chatter]
- Colonel.

243
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,560
- We fucked up again, sir.
- He's not here.

244
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:49,480
- Looks like your little machine is broken.
- [men chuckle]

245
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,550
Go and fiddle with the little knob. Go on.

246
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,430
Excuse me, Colonel.

247
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,770
[man] Listen up! Take down
the staging area and head back to Holguín.

248
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,990
[Hugo Jr.] Son of a bitch wasn't talking
from this building, but he was close.

249

- [kids chattering]
- [water splashes]

250
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,920
- A ghost.
- What's that?

251
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,520
That's what you call a signal that's been
reflected and appears somewhere else.

252
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:32,630
That's what happened with Escobar's
signal. It bounced off the water.

253
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,520
I'm going to get the rolling papers
and clear my head.

254
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,410
Give me the keys!

255
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,110
- If you want, I'll go.
- Where are the sunglasses?

- Hello, sir.
- Hello, how are you?

266
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,110
Can I have a strawberry with cream,
please?

267
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,310
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

268
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:44,700
- Thank you. How much do I owe you?
- Just two thousand pesos.

269
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,620
- There you go. Thank you.
- Thank you.

Sir.

[church bell ringing]

279
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:44,670
[Gustavo] You'd have to be really stupid
or have a lot of balls

280
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,910
to sit here as if nothing's happening.

281
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,720
They're offering seven million dollars
for your head,

282
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,000
and you're sitting here
like a fucking tourist.

283
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,850
You look just like Che Guevara.

284

What's beautiful is always beautiful.

285

You look like you ate Che Guevara.

00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,810
What? You don't miss me or what?

287
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,110
Yesterday, I turned 44 years old.

288
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,360
Son of a bitch, you're old, Pablo.

289
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,910
Thank you, Gustavo.

290
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,950
Did you know that Julius Caesar
invaded Britain when he was 44?

291
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,180
He lost power many times,
but always got it back.

292
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,790
Never letting anything stop him.

293
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,380
Yeah, but that motherfucker
had a fucking army.

294
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:50,220
You remember when we used to talk about
going to the jungle if shit got too heavy?

295
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,600
- Yeah, and joining the guerrillas.
- Mmm.

296

[sighs] Tata wants me to surrender.

297
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:04,900
Tata's a smart woman, Pablo.
She loves you very much.

298
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,900
Maybe it's a good idea.

299
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,720
You surrender, go to jail
and take the time to rest, think,

300
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,180
to restructure the business,
and escape whenever you want.

301

The legend grows.

302
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,750
- She said the same thing.
- Yeah.

303
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,880
We both know that things aren't
going to be as easy as before, cousin.

304
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,600
Let's cut the bullshit.

305
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,430
We are bandits, Pablo.

306
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,270
Right?

307
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,070
What do you think?

308
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:53,160
[sighs] I think...

309
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,790
that everything started to fall apart
the day you left.

310
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,710
So you do miss me, you son of a bitch.

311
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,180

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,310
- I was worried. It's dangerous.
- Look...

317
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,980
It worked perfectly.

318
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:00,370
You're a good man, Limón.

319
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,660
Thank you.

320
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,670
Thanks a lot.

321
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,610
- Are we going to eat the pasta or what?
- Yes, sir.

322
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:15,400
- Put salt on it, pussy.
- Yes, boss. Whatever you say.

323
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,720
I'm hungry.

324
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,260
[Pablo] Tata?

325
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,370
Pablo?

326
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:29,100
There's the love of my life.

327
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,860
- You sound different.
- I'm good, my love.

328
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,400
I feel good.

329
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,330
And ready to talk to those reporters.

330
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,970
Good, my love.

331
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,080
Does that mean you're turning yourself in?

332
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
No, Tata.

333
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,170
I'll never surrender.

334
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,010
We won't be under protection, Pablo.

335
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,850
You have to.

336
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,230
I'll never surrender, my love.

337
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,370
I know, Pablo.

338
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,710
But what's your plan?

339
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,380
All right.

340
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,630
I know what we're going to do.

341
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:44,070
We will talk to all of those
foreign journalists.

342
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,060
That's what we are going to do.

343
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,020
[signal breaking up]

344
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,580
- [Pablo] ...foreign journalists...
- Alvaro, slow down!

345
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,500
...so the world will know
what these bastards are doing...

346
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,150
- It must be around here, Morales.
- You sure?

347
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,290
We will make the international press
put pressure on the Colombian government.

348
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:13,810
And listen, we will succeed, Tata.

349
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:17,650
We will succeed.
We will fight and we will succeed.

350
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,760
You have to believe me.

351
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,550
- We will succeed.
- [softly] Stop, stop, stop, stop!

352
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:30,120
As soon as we do that, I'll go
to the jungle, join the guerrillas...

353
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,290
Son of a bitch, it's Escobar.

354
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,560
We have to get you and the kids
out of the country.

355
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,480
And listen...

356
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:43,210
I will not rest until that happens.

357
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,620
Alvaro, drive slowly. Park up ahead.

358
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:52,410
[Tata] I only have one notebook.
Let me go get it.

359
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,190
The helicopters are triangulating
that area, correct?

360
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,730
Yes, Colonel, just in this area.

361
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,150
- Very well.
- Excuse me, Colonel.

362
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,840
Lieutenant Martinez is on channel four.

363
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,140
All right, excuse me. Thank you.

364
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,540
[Martinez]
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

365
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,940
Colonel, I found him.

366
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,940
Who? Escobar?

367
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,540
Yes, Colonel.

368
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,150
He's in Los Olivos.

369
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,740
Son, are you sure? We can't afford
the luxury of making another mistake.

370
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,040
I'm sure. I saw him.

371
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,500
What do you mean you saw him?

372
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,710
Yes, he looked out a window.
He's got a beard now, but it's him.

373
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,630
And did he see you?

374
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:43,420
No, I don't think so.

375
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,320
Listen up, Lieutenant.

376
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,910
There's still some men
in the staging area.

377
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:53,520
I need you to wait until they get to you.
Understood?

378
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,830
Copy that, Colonel.

379
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,770
One more thing. Be safe. Over and out.

380
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,400
- Fix the position.
- Right away.

381
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,720
Hello, Dad.

382
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,570
How's it going, son?

383
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,260
You wanted to ask me something or what?

384
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,540
Yes, sir.

385
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,100
What wish did you make for your birthday?

386
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,590
If I tell you, it won't come true. Right?

387
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,770
Tell me! Don't be like that!

388
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,280
Well, the only thing that I can tell you

389
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,780
is that it was a very good wish.

390
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,740
You know,

391
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,220
you deserve the best birthday
in the world.

392
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,860
Thank you, my love.

393
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,590
Captain.

394
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:52,300
- [Martinez] Captain, can you hear me?
- Yes, Colonel?

395
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,760
How many men are left
in the provisional base?

396
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:57,580
- Counting me, about 12.
- Listen up.

397
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:02,650
- Lieutenant Martinez found Escobar.
- Shit! Let's go!

398
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:05,230
- Everybody to Los Olivos!
- [overlapping shouts]

399
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,940
[Manuela] Hello.

400
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:11,400
Hello, my little princess.
How's my little girl?

401
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,450
Good.

402
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:16,330
I've got your little rabbit here.
He's getting very fat.

403
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,810
[giggles]

404
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,420
Perez!

405
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:32,260
Attention! Two groups. Captain, Sergeant
in the back, and I'll take the front.

406
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,580
[in English] This is the house.

407
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,870
[Pablo in Spanish]
Get your mom on the phone, okay?

408
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,060
Pablo.

409
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,600
- Do you have the questions?
- Yes, my love, I've got them here.

410
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,550
The first one
is from a Spanish journalist.

411
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,180
"How do you feel after
all these days on the run?"

412
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,470
Write this down.

413
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,910
"It's been very hard
being far from my family,

414
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:00,910
who I love more than anything
in the world."

415
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,420
- Sergeant, go around.
- "But I feel good.

416
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,040
I feel strong.

417
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:10,860
And I have the will to fight
all of these injustices.

418
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:15,580
The government has made a mockery
of our rights.

419
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,670
It's allowed our justice system
to become corrupted by murderers.

420
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:27,460
The people of Colombia deserve
much better than that.

421
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,760
The government
is holding my family hostage.

422
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:39,240
That's a crime against human rights
committed by a government

423
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:42,390
that calls itself democratic.

424
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:46,040
My little kids are innocent children

425
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:50,530
that have nothing to do
with their father's problems.

426
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,350
All we want from the government

427
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:02,350
is that they bring those killers,
Los Pepes, to justice.

428
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:08,560
But above else, that they allow my family
to leave the country immediately.

429
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,760
- Without that..."
- [dogs barking outside]

[barking continues]

You just shot Pablo Escobar!

458
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:36,030
Is he alive?

459
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:38,070
[Steve]
All that time hunting him...

460
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,700
and just like that,
I'm looking down at Pablo fucking Escobar.

461
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:47,390
For years I'd been building
this son of a bitch up in my head.

462
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:50,670
What a monster he'd be. [chuckles]

463
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,100
But here's the thing.

464
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:56,920
When you lay eyes on him,
the devil's a real letdown.

465
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,110
Just a man.

466
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:00,800
Beard grows if he doesn't shave.

467
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,700
Fat and shoeless.

468
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,660
You take a good long look at evil,
and it reminds you of one...

484
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:33,830
My son! My son...

[Hermilda]
I pray to God that other mothers

487
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:44,420
don't have to experience
the pain that I'm feeling.

488
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,380
And I know my son wasn't as bad
as they made him out to be.

489
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,510
I know that they blamed him
for anything bad that happened.

490
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,720
I want the good things he did
to be remembered,

491
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,090
because he didn't do the bad things
they say he did.

492
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,350
He built playing fields.
He built a neighborhood for the poor.

493
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:00,390
No one has paid attention to that.

494
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:04,600
As a son,
there will never be anyone better.

495
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:08,260
[dialogue fades] He was the noblest
of men. Not just as a son...

496
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:25,650
[up-tempo Latin music playing]

497
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,070
[celebratory shouting]

498
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:40,310
Sit down, ma'am. Sit.

499
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:41,710
Thank you.

500
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:49,710
Talk to me.

501
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,300
Before he died,
my husband told me to find you.

502
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,430
He told you that?

503
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,960
He told me that despite the fact
that you became enemies,

504
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,080
you were once associates and friends.

505
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:09,650
[laughter, loud chatter]

506
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,030
You were saying?

507
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:22,250
He told me that you were a decent man.
That you would understand the situation.

508
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:25,880
That you would forgive us.

509
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,880
And that you might help us
get out of the country.

510
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:35,610
How much do you have left, Mrs. Escobar?

511
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,220
In property? In cash?

512
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,270
I can find out.

513
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,440
That's good.

514
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:52,150
Because I want all of it.

515
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,690
[Javier in English]
Sir, do I need a lawyer?

516
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,070
You're the review board, right?

517
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:41,870
Professional conduct or some bullshit?

518
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:45,910
We're not the review board.

519
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:50,840
So who are you?

520
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:55,050
We're from Operations.

521
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,410
What do you want from me?

522
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:04,830
- [laughter, chatter]
- [in Spanish] All right, gentlemen!

523
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:06,490
Gentlemen!

524
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:12,630
In the history of every business,
there are decisive moments.

525
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,590
In 1992, do you know how much cocaine

526
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:16,820
we estimated came into the US
from Colombia?

527
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,550
311 metric tons.

528
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:25,850
The first sale. The first million.
The first billion.

529
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:29,850
And when your rival no longer exists.

530
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,290
[laughter]

531
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,900
And in 1993, during the hunt for Escobar,
372 metric tons.

532
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,440
Now that piece of shit is on his last leg.

533
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,530
Every one of his labs has been shut down.

534
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:44,950
And cocaine production goes up.

535
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:48,120
The important thing in these moments
isn't how one reacts,

536
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,540
but how well one has prepared for them.

537
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:54,900
Gentlemen, I have to tell you
that we are ready.

538
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,650
Can you imagine what happens next year?

539
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,840
[Gilberto] And we won't be needing
kidnappings and bombs to succeed.

540
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:06,220
We will do it covertly.

541
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,100
And when they turn around
to see what happened,

542
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,520
we'll no longer be there.

543
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,350
- No, sir!
- [laughter]

544
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,710
- Cheers!
- [all] Cheers!

545
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,420
Now the king is dead. Long live the kings.

546
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:27,520
Agent Peña, how much do you know
about the Cali cartel?

547
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:34,520
