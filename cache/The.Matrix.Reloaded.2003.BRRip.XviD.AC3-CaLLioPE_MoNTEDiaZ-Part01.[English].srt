1
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,300
See you tomorrow.

2
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,660
Oh, my God!

3
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,850
I'm in.

4
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,710
We're almost there.

5
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,880
- Sir, are you sure about this?
- I told you, we're going to be all right.

6
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:18,470
I understand, sir. It's just that I'm scoping
some serious sentinel activity up here.

7
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,060
- Link.
- Yes, sir?

8
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,350
Given your situation, I can't say
I understand your reasons...

9
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,190
...for volunteering to operate
onboard my ship.

10
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,360
However, if you wish to continue to
do so, I must ask you to do one thing.

11
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,360
What's that, sir?

12
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,400
To trust me.

13
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,530
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

14
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,740
- I mean, I do, sir.
- I hope so.

15
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:24,290
Repatch the main AC to the hard drives
and stand by to broadcast.

16
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,540
Yes, sir.

17
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,630
Still can't sleep?

18
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,970
You wanna talk?

19
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,730
They're just dreams.

20
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,400
If you're afraid of something...

21
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,400
I just wish...

22
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,320
I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.

23
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,320
That's all.

24
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,860
I just wish I knew.

25
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,240
She's gonna call. Don't worry.

26
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,450
Here you are.

27
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,080
- Are we ready to go?
- We're already late.

28
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:12,880
These geotherms confirm
the last transmission of the Osiris.

29
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,300
The machines are digging.

30
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,300
They're boring from the surface
down to Zion.

31
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,010
- Mother-
- They'll avoid the perimeter defense.

32
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,680
How fast are they moving?

33
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,230
Control estimates their descent
at 100 meters an hour.

34
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,850
- How deep are they?
- Almost 2000 meters.

35
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,570
- What about the scans from the Osiris?
- They can't be accurate.

36
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,650
- They may be.
- It's not possible.

37
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,280
That'd mean there are
a quarter-million sentinels.

38
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,950
- That's right.
- That can't be.

39
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,780
Why not?

40
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,750
A sentinel for every man,
woman and child in Zion.

41
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,620
That sounds exactly like
the thinking of a machine to me.

42
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,960
Morpheus, glad you could join us.

43
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,630
Niobe.

44
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,380
My apologies to all.
But as you are undoubtedly aware...

45
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,850
...it's become difficult to locate
a secure broadcast position.

46
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,270
- Squiddies got our best spots.
- Lines are crawling with them.

47
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,230
And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours
there's gonna be a quarter-million more.

48
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,520
What are we gonna do?

49
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,980
We're gonna do what
Commander Lock ordered.

50
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,900
We'll evacuate broadcast level
and return to Zion.

51
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:22,200
And does the commander have a plan
for stopping 250,000 sentinels?

52
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,030
A strategy is still being formulated.

53
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,870
I'm sure it is.

54
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,890
What do you think
we should do, Morpheus?

55
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,220
- We should proceed as ordered...
- What is it?

56
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,430
I don't know.

57
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,390
...however, I must ask one of you
for help.

58
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,270
Some of you believe as I believe, some
of you do not. Those of you that do...

59
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,030
...know we are nearing
the end of our struggle.

60
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,410
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon.
But before it can be...

61
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,910
...the Oracle must be consulted.

62
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,090
If we return and recharge now...

63
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,010
...we can be back in 36 hours, well
before the machines reach this depth.

64
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,050
Do you understand what you're asking?

65
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,050
I am asking that one ship
remain here in our place...

66
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,930
...in case the Oracle
should attempt to contact us.

67
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,230
Bullshit. You're asking one of us
to disobey a direct order.

68
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,940
That's right, I am. But we well know
that the reason most of us are here...

69
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,780
...is because of our affinity
for disobedience.

70
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,820
What happens when you
get back to Zion...

71
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,410
...and the commander
throws you in the stockade?

72
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,820
He won't.

73
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,120
Goddamn it, Morpheus,
you ain't never gonna change.

74
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,580
Shit, I'll do it just to see
what Deadbolt does to you.

75
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,290
You got 36 hours.

76
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,920
I'm looking for Neo.

77
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,470
- Never heard of him.
- I have something for him.

78
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,890
A gift.

79
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,970
You see, he set me free.

80
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,640
Fine, whatever. Now piss off.

81
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,230
- Who was that?
- How did you know someone was here?

82
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,860
He gave you this.

83
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,030
He said you set him free.

84
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,330
Is everything all right, sir?

85
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,330
The meeting is over.
Retreat to your exits.

86
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,750
- Agents are coming.
- Agents?

87
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,540
Go.

88
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,430
Hiya, fellas.

89
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,720
- It's him.
- The anomaly.

90
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,140
- Do we proceed?
- Yes.

91
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,810
- He is still-
- Only human.

92
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,280
Upgrades.

93
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,710
- That went as expected.
- Yes.

94
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,590
It's happening exactly as before.

95
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,420
Well, not exactly.

96
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,220
- What happened?
- I can't figure it out.

97
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,060
Agents just came out of nowhere.

98
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,220
Then the code got all weird.
Encryption I've never seen.

99
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,310
- Is Neo okay?
- Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.

100
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,900
Where is he now?

101
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,110
He's doing his Superman thing.

102
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,530
Where are you?

103
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,830
This is the Nebuchadnezzar,
requesting access through Gate Three.

104
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,300
Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control.
Maintain present velocity and stand by.

105
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,010
Roger that, Control.

106
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,640
This is Control requesting immediate
stand-down of arms at Gate Three.

107
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,640
We have the Nebuchadnezzar
on approach. Let's open her up.

108
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,150
You are cleared through
Gate Three to Bay Seven.

109
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,030
Roger that, Control.

110
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,250
Door's open, bed's made.
Welcome home.

111
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,170
No place like it.

112
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,060
Roger that, Control. Zion Control,
stand by for Gate Three lockdown.

113
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,990
The Nebuchadnezzar is down.
Bay Seven.

114
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,320
Understood.

115
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,580
Captain Mifune.

116
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,840
Captain Morpheus.

117
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,840
Are you here to escort me
to the stockade, captain?

118
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,430
- I'm just here to keep the peace.
- Commander Lock demands-

119
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,850
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.

120
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,600
- Link.
- Sir?

121
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,350
I want the ship ready to go
as soon as possible.

122
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,060
Understood, sir.

123
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,650
- What is it between them?
- Morpheus and Lock?

124
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,950
- Niobe.
- Captain Niobe?

125
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,330
She used to be with Morpheus.
Now she's with Lock.

126
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,160
What happened?

127
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,830
Morpheus went to the Oracle.
After that, everything changed.

128
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,630
Yeah, she can do that.

129
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,960
Neo!

130
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,880
- Oh, no.
- How does he always know?

131
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,010
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

132
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,850
You know what they say
about the life you save.

133
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,810
I didn't save his life.

134
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,350
Hiya, Neo.

135
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,190
- Trinity, Link.
- Hey.

136
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,990
- It's great to have you back.
- Thanks. It's good to be back.

137
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,910
- Can I carry that for you?
- No, I can carry my own bag.

138
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,740
- Trinity?
- I'm fine.

139
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,580
- You can carry these.
- Yeah, sure, Link.

140
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:56,000
Hey, you know, next year
I'm old enough to join a crew, right?

141
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,920
I've been thinking about it,
and I've made my decision.

142
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,590
Let me guess.

143
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,010
I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.

144
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,560
Morpheus hasn't filled the other
positions, except for you, Link.

145
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,100
I'm sure he has reasons...

146
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,600
...but the more I think about it,
the more I think it's meant to be.

147
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,310
You know, it's fate.

148
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,070
You're the reason I'm here, Neo.

149
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,730
I told you, you found me.
I didn't find you.

150
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,450
I know, but you got me out.
You saved me.

151
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,240
You saved yourself.

152
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,800
- Morpheus.
- Commander Lock.

153
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:48,560
I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to
offer you a chance to explain your actions.

154
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,640
I wasn't aware that my actions
required any explanation.

155
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,060
You were given an order
to return to Zion.

156
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,060
- I did.
- You asked for one ship to remain behind.

157
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,940
I would have stayed,
but I needed to recharge my ship.

158
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,820
So you admit to a direct contravention
of your duty.

159
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,370
We need a presence inside the Matrix
to await contact from the Oracle.

160
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,490
I don't want to hear that shit!

161
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,330
I don't care about oracles
or prophecies or messiahs!

162
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,960
I care about one thing: Stopping that army
from destroying this city.

163
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,920
To do that I need soldiers
to obey my orders.

164
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,670
With all due respect, commander,
there is only one way to save our city.

165
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,260
How?

166
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,260
- Neo.
- Goddamn it, Morpheus.

167
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,010
Not everyone believes what you believe.

168
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,310
My beliefs do not require them to.

169
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,360
There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's
talking. A lot of people are scared.

170
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,280
No one remembers the last time
so many ships were docked.

171
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,410
- Something big is happening, isn't it?
- Hey.

172
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,790
We're not allowed to say anything,
so stop asking.

173
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,170
Goddamn, it's good to be home.

174
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,190
I'm recommending that you
be removed from duty.

175
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,650
That is, of course,
your prerogative, commander.

176
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,690
If it were up to me, you wouldn't set foot
on a ship for the rest of your life.

177
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,160
Then I am grateful that it is not up to you.

178
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,500
- Councillor Hamann.
- Commander.

179
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,880
- Captain.
- Councillor.

180
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,420
Council's asked me to speak tonight
at the temple gathering.

181
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,720
The presence of the fleet and the
persistence of rumors must be addressed.

182
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,340
The people must be told
what is happening.

183
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,220
Of course, councillor.

184
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:58,190
But might I advise a level of discretion
concerning specific details.

185
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,360
- We do not wish to start a panic.
- Quite right.

186
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,610
A panic is not what anyone wants.

187
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,150
What about you, captain?
What would you advise?

188
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:15,290
The truth. No one will panic,
because there is nothing to fear.

189
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,580
That army won't reach
the gates of Zion.

190
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,960
- What makes you so sure?
- Consider what we have seen, councillor.

191
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,000
Consider that in the past six months...

192
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,210
...we have freed more minds
than in six years.

193
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,430
This attack is an act of desperation.

194
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:33,430
I believe very soon the prophecy
will be fulfilled and this war will end.

195
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,390
I hope you're right, captain.

196
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,270
I do not believe it to be
a matter of hope, councillor.

197
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,020
It is simply a matter of time.

198
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,690
My stop.

199
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,240
See you soon.

200
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,900
Hopefully not too soon.

201
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,200
Let's go, kid.
These two got things to do.

202
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,380
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

203
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,000
I am if you're thinking
this elevator is too slow.

204
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,470
- How long do we charge the Neb?
- Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.

205
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:14,850
Some people go their entire lives
without hearing news that good.

206
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:43,620
Neo, please, I have a son,
Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.

207
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,300
- Please, watch over him.
- I'll try.

208
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,550
I have a daughter on the Icarus.

209
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,630
No, wait.

210
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,300
It's all right. They need you.

211
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,720
- I need you.
- I know.

212
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,560
There's time.

213
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,650
Where's my puss-?

214
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,190
- Hey!
- Uncle Link!

215
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,940
God!

216
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,070
Uncle Link!

217
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,820
Oh, my God! You're so huge!

218
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,160
- You should be picking me up!
- No!

219
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,870
- Yeah!
- Okay!

220
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,750
Okay? All right.

221
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,960
Now, we're gonna have
to work together here, okay?

222
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,340
One, two, three, lift!

223
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,710
Oh, my God!
What are you feeding these two?

224
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,590
Come on, kids. It's time to go.

225
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,720
- Hey, Cas.
- Hey.

226
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,810
- Good to have you home, Link.
- Good to be home.

227
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,810
You be careful with her.

228
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,730
Don't worry about me.
He's the one that's gonna get it.

229
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,980
Out the door! Both of you, march!

230
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,150
- Bye!
- Bye!

231
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,120
I'm gonna get what?

232
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:05,460
Every ship up there's been home two, even
three times more than the Nebuchadnezzar.

233
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,460
Come on, Zee.
I thought we were past this.

234
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,050
- We'll be when you operate another ship.
- I can't do that.

235
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,720
- Why?
- You know why.

236
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,050
If Dozer knew how I felt,
he wouldn't have asked you to do this.

237
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,310
Maybe. But it's too late now.

238
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:24,100
I made a promise,
and some promises can't be unmade.

239
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,980
- It's not fair.
- Nobody said it was gonna be.

240
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,110
You think Cas thinks it's fair
that I'm here and Dozer's not?

241
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:39,240
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.

242
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,540
I'm afraid of it.

243
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,750
I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.

244
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,250
It won't.

245
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,250
How can you say that to me?

246
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,380
Because of Morpheus.

247
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:58,220
Because of what he's told me. He said
that this is it, that it will be over soon.

248
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,560
- Link, Morpheus is crazy.
- No doubt.

249
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,310
But Tank and Dozer believed him.
And I'll tell you what...

250
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,770
...after being on that ship and seeing Neo
do the things he can do, I gotta say...

251
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,980
...I'm starting to believe him too.

252
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,530
Be careful, Link.

253
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,250
Please be careful.

254
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,760
- They started yet?
- Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.

255
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:45,060
Tonight, let us honor
these men and women.

256
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,810
These are our soldiers, our warriors.

257
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:52,230
These are our husbands and wives,
our brothers and sisters...

258
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,110
...our children.

259
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,780
Let us remember those
that have been lost...

260
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,160
...and let us give thanks
for those that have been found...

261
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,620
...and who stand here beside us.

262
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:08,540
Now I would like someone else
to close this prayer...

263
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,870
...someone who hasn't spoken here
in a long time...

264
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:17,420
...but who I believe has something to say
that we all need to hear.

265
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,010
I give you Morpheus.

266
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:43,700
Zion! Hear me!

267
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,830
It is true what many of you have heard.

268
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:52,000
The machines have gathered
an army, and as I speak...

269
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,090
...that army is drawing nearer
to our home.

270
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:02,220
Believe me when I say we have
a difficult time ahead of us.

271
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,060
But if we are to be prepared for it,
we must first shed our fear of it.

272
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,480
I stand here before you now
truthfully unafraid.

273
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,810
Why?

274
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,070
Because I believe something you do not?

275
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,070
No!

276
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,330
I stand here without fear
because I remember.

277
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:31,410
I remember that I am here not because
of the path that lies before me...

278
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,960
...but because of the path
that lies behind me.

279
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,750
I remember that for 100 years
we have fought these machines.

280
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,680
I remember that for 100 years
they have sent their armies to destroy us.

281
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,930
And after a century of war,
I remember that which matters most:

282
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,810
We are still here!

283
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,610
Tonight...

284
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:07,160
...let us send a message to that army.

285
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,370
Tonight, let us shake this cave.

286
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,410
Tonight, let us tremble these halls...

287
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,750
...of earth, steel and stone.

288
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,130
Let us be heard from red core
to black sky.

289
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,890
Tonight, let us make them remember:

290
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:33,020
This is Zion and we are not afraid!

291
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,330
I remember.

292
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,590
I remember you used to dance.

293
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,510
I remember you were pretty good.

294
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,510
There are some things in this world,
Captain Niobe...

295
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,100
...that will never change.

296
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,310
Niobe!

297
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,770
Some things do change.

298
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,880
Excuse me.

299
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:00,230
- I missed you.
- I can tell.

300
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:04,400
I was thinking, everyone is here.

301
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,230
Follow me.

302
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:31,810
Neo, what is it?

303
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,400
What's wrong?

304
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,280
It's okay, you can tell me.

305
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,160
Trinity...

306
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,120
Don't be afraid.

307
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,620
I can't lose you.

308
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,710
You're not gonna lose me.

309
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,670
You feel this?

310
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,630
I'm never letting go.

311
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,550
Good night, Zion.

312
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,340
Sweet dreams.

313
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,190
- You all right?
- I'll make it.

314
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,980
Did you see that agent?
I've never seen anything like that.

315
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,230
It doesn't matter.
All that matters is this.

316
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,690
You first.

317
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,460
- Oh, God.
- "Smith" will suffice.

318
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:29,270
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

319
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:21,940
- Care for some company?
- Councillor Hamann.

320
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,700
I don't want to intrude
if you'd prefer to be alone.

321
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:29,660
- No, I could probably use some company.
- Good.

322
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,540
So could I.

323
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:38,130
It's nice tonight.

324
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,050
Very calm.

325
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,010
It feels like everyone is sleeping
very peacefully.

326
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,840
Not everyone.

327
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:51,810
I hate sleeping.
I never sleep more than a few hours.

328
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:56,060
I figure I slept the first 11 years
of my life, now I'm making up for it.

329
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,230
- What about you?
- I just haven't been able to sleep much.

330
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:05,820
- It's a good sign.
- Of what?

331
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:09,160
That you are in fact still human.

332
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:16,660
Have you ever been
to the engineering level?

333
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,880
I love to walk there at night.
It's quite amazing.

334
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,630
- Would you like to see it?
- Sure.

335
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:37,770
Almost no one comes down here.
Unless, of course, there's a problem.

336
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:42,980
That's how it is with people. Nobody
cares how it works as long as it works.

337
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,440
I like it down here.

338
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:51,410
I like to be reminded this city survives
because of these machines.

339
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:56,700
These machines are keeping us alive while
other machines are coming to kill us.

340
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,960
Interesting, isn't it?
The power to give life...

341
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,340
- ... and the power to end it.
- We have the same power.

342
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,220
Yeah, I suppose we do, but...

343
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,840
...sometimes I think about those people
still plugged into the Matrix.

344
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:15,010
And when I look at these machines...

345
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:20,270
...I can't help thinking that, in a way,
we are plugged into them.

346
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,440
But we control these machines,
they don't control us.

347
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,860
Of course not. How could they?

348
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,570
The idea is pure nonsense...

349
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:33,200
...but it does make one wonder just...

350
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,950
...what is control?

351
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,250
If we wanted, we could
shut these machines down.

352
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:43,130
Of course. That's it. You hit it.
That's control, isn't it?

353
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,090
If we wanted,
we could smash them to bits.

354
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,470
Although if we did, we'd have to consider
what would happen to our lights...

355
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,350
...our heat, our air.

356
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:59,480
So we need machines and they need us.
Is that your point, councillor?

357
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,270
No. No point.

358
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:07,020
Old men like me don't bother
with making points. There's no point.

359
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,610
Is that why there are no young men
on the Council?

360
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,490
Good point.

361
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,330
Why don't you tell me
what's on your mind, councillor.

362
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,790
There is so much in this world...

363
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,880
...that I do not understand.

364
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:31,380
See that machine? It has something to do
with recycling our water supply.

365
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,550
I have absolutely no idea how it works.

366
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,810
But I do understand the reason
for it to work.

367
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:44,810
I have absolutely no idea how you
are able to do some of the things you do.

368
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,190
But I believe there's a reason for that
as well.

369
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:55,200
I only hope we understand that reason
before it's too late.

370
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,370
- Ballard.
- Is he here?

371
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,340
Neo, it's from the Oracle.

372
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,010
It's time to go.

373
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:16,430
Morpheus said this was how
it was gonna happen.

374
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,020
I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true,
maybe it's not.

375
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,770
All I know is, that ship needs an operator.

376
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:28,190
Right now, that operator's me.

377
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,900
I know.

378
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,530
- Zee...
- I want you to wear it.

379
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,790
- You know I don't believe in this stuff.
- But I do.

380
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,080
It's always brought me luck.

381
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:48,380
- Maybe it'll bring me you.
- I'm coming back.

382
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:53,050
I promise. No matter what it takes,
I'm coming home.

383
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,390
Just keep it with you. Please.

384
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,640
For me.

385
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,350
Okay.

386
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,000
- Neo!
- How the hell-?

387
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,580
Bane.

388
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:30,080
Is something wrong?

389
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,000
No, I'm fine.

390
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,920
I just wanted to catch you to say...

391
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,920
...good luck.

392
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,340
Thanks.

393
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,890
We'll see you.

394
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,560
Neo! Just in time.

395
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:50,060
- You're gonna see the Oracle?
- There's no time.

396
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,860
I had to give something to Neo.

397
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:55,280
A gift from one of the orphans.

398
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,860
He made me swear to get it to you
before you left.

399
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,200
He said you'd understand.

400
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,000
Thanks.

401
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:17,010
I was just told you cleared
the Nebuchadnezzar for takeoff.

402
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,130
That is correct.

403
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,260
Am I still in charge
of our defense system?

404
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,720
Of course.

405
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:27,480
I believe I need every ship we have
if we're going to survive this attack.

406
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,230
I understand that, commander.

407
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,980
Then why did you allow
the Nebuchadnezzar to leave?

408
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:38,030
Because I believe our survival depends
on more than how many ships we have.

409
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,820
Be careful.

410
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:14,060
Hello.

411
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:27,910
- You seek the Oracle.
- Who are you?

412
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,460
I am Seraph. I can take you to her,
but first I must apologize.

413
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,420
Apologize for what?

414
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,880
For this.

415
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,440
Good.

416
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,110
The Oracle has many enemies.
I had to be sure.

417
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,530
- Of what?
- That you are the One.

418
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:51,700
- You could have just asked.
- No. You do not truly know someone...

419
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:54,120
...until you fight them.

420
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:58,130
Come. She's waiting.

421
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,100
Where the hell did they go?

422
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:18,150
These are back doors, aren't they?

423
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:21,270
Programmer access.

424
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,070
- How do they work?
- A code is hidden in tumblers.

425
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:31,280
One position opens a lock and another
position opens one of these doors.

426
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:35,830
Are you a programmer?

427
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,370
Then what are you?

428
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:44,010
I protect that which matters most.

429
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,940
Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.

430
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,110
Come around here
and let me have a look at you.

431
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:15,700
My goodness, look at you.

432
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,870
You turned out all right, didn't you?

433
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,290
- How do you feel?
- I-

434
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,000
I know you're not sleeping.
We'll get to that.

435
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:27,880
Why don't you come
and have a sit this time.

436
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:32,720
- Maybe I'll stand.
- Well, suit yourself.

437
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,400
- I felt like sitting.
- I know.

438
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,490
So...

439
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:53,990
...let's get the obvious stuff
out of the way.

440
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,790
- You're not human, are you?
- It's tough to get more obvious than that.

441
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:04,750
If I had to guess, I'd say you're
a program from the machine world.

442
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:09,340
- So is he.
- So far, so good.

443
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:12,680
But if that's true, that could mean
you're part of this system...

444
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,430
...another kind of control.

445
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:20,100
- Keep going.
- I suppose the most obvious question is...

446
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:24,190
- ... how can I trust you?
- Bingo.

447
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:28,530
It is a pickle, no doubt about it.
Bad news is...

448
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:32,320
...there's no way you can really know
if I'm here to help you or not.

449
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:36,030
So it's really up to you. Just have
to make up your own damn mind...

450
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:41,000
...to either accept what
I'm going to tell you or reject it.

451
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:44,460
Candy?

452
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:51,590
- Do you already know if I'll take it?
- Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.

453
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,970
But if you already know,
how can I make a choice?

454
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:59,180
Because you didn't come here to make
the choice. You've already made it.

455
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:04,020
You're here to try to understand
why you made it.

456
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:12,490
I thought you'd have figured that out
by now.

457
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,820
- Why are you here?
- Same reason.

458
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:19,830
I love candy.

459
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:22,830
But why help us?

460
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,540
We're all here to do
what we're all here to do.

461
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,130
I'm interested in one thing, Neo:
the future.

462
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,550
And believe me, I know, the only way
to get there is together.

463
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:40,260
- Are there other programs like you?
- Well, not like me, but...

464
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:43,100
Look. See those birds?

465
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:46,770
At some point, a program was written
to govern them.

466
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:52,740
A program was written to watch over the
trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.

467
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:55,910
There are programs running
all over the place.

468
00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:00,490
The ones doing their job, doing what
they were meant to do, are invisible.

469
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:04,500
You'd never even know they were here.
But the other ones...

470
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:08,750
Well, you hear about them all the time.

471
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:12,250
- I've never heard of them.
- Of course you have.

472
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:17,340
Every time you've heard someone
say they saw a ghost or an angel...

473
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:22,060
...every story you've ever heard about
vampires, werewolves or aliens...

474
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,560
...is the system assimilating
some program...

475
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:29,400
...that's doing something
they're not supposed to be doing.

476
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:32,610
Programs hacking programs.

477
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,650
- Why?
- They have their reasons...

478
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,740
...but usually a program chooses exile
when it faces deletion.

479
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,080
- And why would a program be deleted?
- Maybe it breaks down.

480
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:48,830
Maybe a better program is created
to replace it. Happens all the time.

481
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,960
And when it does, a program
can either choose to hide here...

482
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,760
...or return to the source.

483
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:01,720
- The machine mainframe.
- Yes.

484
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:04,390
Where you must go.

485
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,770
Where the path of the One ends.
You've seen it...

486
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,770
...in your dreams, haven't you?

487
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:15,780
A door made of light?

488
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:21,570
What happens when you go through
the door?

489
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:26,750
I see Trinity...

490
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:30,040
...and something happens...

491
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:32,130
...something bad.

492
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:36,300
She starts to fall,
and then I wake up.

493
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:41,220
- Do you see her die?
- No.

494
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:45,060
You have the sight now, Neo.

495
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:48,230
You are looking at the world
without time.

496
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:50,810
Then why can't I see
what happens to her?

497
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:54,730
We can never see past the choices
we don't understand.

498
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,110
Are you saying I have to choose
whether Trinity lives or dies?

499
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:02,160
No, you've already made the choice.

500
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,830
Now you have to understand it.

501
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:06,830
No.

502
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:10,250
I can't do that. I won't.

503
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,380
- Well, you have to.
- Why?

504
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,000
Because you're the One.

505
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:22,180
What if I can't?

506
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,350
What happens if I fail?

507
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:27,930
Then Zion will fall.

508
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,280
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo.
You can save Zion...

509
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,740
...if you reach the source, but to do that
you need the Keymaker.

510
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:44,950
The Keymaker?

511
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,740
He disappeared. We didn't
know what happened to him until now.

512
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:52,670
He's being held prisoner
by a very dangerous program...

513
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:56,380
...one of the oldest of us.
He is called the Merovingian.

514
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:59,420
- And he won't let him go willingly.
- What does he want?

515
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:04,430
What do all men with power want?
More power.

516
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:08,430
Be there at that exact time...

517
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,230
...and you will have a chance.

518
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,270
We must go.

519
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,820
Seems like every time we meet
I got nothing but bad news.

520
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,280
I'm sorry about that. I surely am.

521
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:26,200
But for what it's worth...

522
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,910
...you've made a believer out of me.

523
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,330
Good luck, kiddo.

524
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:57,270
Mr. Anderson.

525
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:00,320
Did you get my package?

526
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,610
- Yeah.
- Well, good.

527
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:06,660
- Smith?
- He's not reading like an agent.

528
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:10,700
- Surprised to see me?
- No.

529
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:13,450
- Then you're aware of it.
- Of what?

530
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:16,670
Our connection.

531
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:19,500
I don't fully understand how it happened.

532
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:23,050
Perhaps some part of you
imprinted onto me...

533
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:25,930
...something overwritten or copied.

534
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:28,800
It is, at this point, irrelevant.
What matters is...

535
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:32,060
...that whatever happened,
happened for a reason.

536
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,890
And what reason is that?

537
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:38,270
I killed you, Mr. Anderson.
I watched you die.

538
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:41,690
With a certain satisfaction,
I might add.

539
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:45,360
And then something happened,
something that I knew was impossible...

540
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:47,360
...but it happened anyway.

541
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:51,280
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.

542
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:57,830
Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood
what I was supposed to do...

543
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
...but I didn't.

544
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:05,340
I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...

545
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,340
...compelled to disobey.

546
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:13,720
And now, here I stand
because of you, Mr. Anderson.

547
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:17,810
Because of you, I'm no longer an agent
of this system.

548
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:21,190
Because of you, I've changed.
I'm unplugged.

549
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:26,190
A new man, so to speak.
Like you, apparently free.

550
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:27,950
Congratulations.

551
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:30,990
Thank you.

552
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:36,250
But as you well know,
appearances can be deceiving...

553
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:41,540
...which brings me back to the reason
why we're here.

554
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:46,590
We're not here because we're free.
We're here because we are not free.

555
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,680
There's no escaping reason,
no denying purpose.

556
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,220
Because as we both know,
without purpose...

557
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:59,230
- ... we would not exist.
- It is purpose that created us.

558
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,400
- Purpose that connects us.
- Purpose that pulls us.

559
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:04,400
- That guides us.
- That drives us.

560
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:09,280
- It is purpose that defines.
- Purpose that binds us.

561
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:11,910
We are here because of you,
Mr. Anderson.

562
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:16,450
We're here to take from you
what you tried to take from us:

563
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:20,500
Purpose.

564
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,460
- What's happening to him?
- Don't know.

565
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:32,130
Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.

566
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:21,410
- You.
- Yes, me.

567
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:28,460
Me, me, me.

568
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,010
Me too.

569
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,800
More.

570
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:48,950
It is inevitable.

571
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:50,790
Come on, get out of there.

572
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,290
Are you all right?

573
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,290
- It was Smith.
- Yes.

574
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:42,800
- Now there's more than one of them?
- A lot more.

575
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,760
- How is that possible?
- I don't know.

576
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:49,390
Somehow, he's found a way
to copy himself.

577
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:53,770
- Is that what he was doing to you?
- I don't know what he was doing...

578
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:56,690
- ... but I know what it felt like.
- What?

579
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:01,320
It felt like I was back in that hallway.

580
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,900
It felt like dying.

581
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,280
The machines are tunneling to avoid
our defense system.

582
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:10,320
But I believe they will intersect
certain pipelines to control them.

583
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:12,990
These points of intersection
are crucial...

584
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,960
...because I believe they're
vulnerable to counterattack.

585
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:20,170
Although it has been suggested that
this is the same kind of attack...

586
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:24,010
...we've defended for years,
I urge the Council to realize the truth.

587
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:27,550
This is the single greatest threat
we have ever faced...

588
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:31,550
...and if we do not act accordingly,
we will not survive.

589
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:35,730
Commander Lock, the Council is well
aware of the seriousness of this attack.

590
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:40,520
You have our leave to prepare our defense
by any and all means necessary.

591
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:43,360
- Thank you, Council.
- However...

592
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:46,990
...we ask if there's been word
from the Nebuchadnezzar.

593
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:49,700
No, councillor. No word. Nothing.

594
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:55,290
Then we request a ship be dispatched
to ascertain the fate of the One.

595
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:59,210
I wish that were possible, councillor,
but I do not believe our defense...

596
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:02,920
- ... can suffer the loss of another ship.
- It will, commander, if it must.

597
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:05,420
It could take one ship days
to find the Nebuchadnezzar.

598
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:08,630
- Then send two.
- This is insane.

599
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,800
Careful, commander.

600
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:15,390
Forgive my frustration, councillors.

601
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:19,440
But I wish I were able to comprehend
the Council's choice in this matter.

602
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,730
Comprehension is not
a requisite of cooperation.

603
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:25,360
If you are asking me
to order two of my captains-

604
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:27,230
There's no need for such an order.

605
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,950
The captains are present.
They can answer for themselves.

606
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:36,700
The Council is calling for two volunteers
to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.

607
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:41,000
Are there two among you
that would answer such a call?

608
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:46,090
Captain Soren of the Vigilant
will answer the Council's call.

609
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:49,170
You understand the situation,
Captain Soren?

610
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:51,800
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, captain.

611
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:54,640
Is there another?

612
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:59,140
- Captain, I think we should volunteer.
- What? You have gone crazy.

613
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:01,230
- Listen-
- Shut your hole, Bane...

614
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:02,850
...before I put you in one.

615
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,490
Is there no other?

616
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,120
Be hard for any man to risk his life...

617
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:20,250
...especially if he doesn't
understand the reason.

618
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:24,210
Captain Niobe of the Logos
will answer the councillor's call.

619
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:26,670
- What?
- Thank you, Captain Niobe.

620
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,920
Commander Lock, you have your orders.
This Council is hereby adjourned.

621
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:39,220
- Niobe, what are you doing?
- What I can.

622
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:40,430
Why?

623
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:45,020
Because some things
never change, Jason...

624
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:47,480
...and some things do.

625
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:05,370
What can you see, Neo?

626
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:07,840
It's strange.
The code is somehow different.

627
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,590
- Encrypted?
- Maybe.

628
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:11,710
Is that good for us or bad for us?

629
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:15,590
Well, it looks like every floor
is wired with explosives.

630
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:17,760
Bad for us.

631
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:19,680
Here we go.

632
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:30,570
Yes. We are here to speak
with the Merovingian.

633
01:03:31,070 --> 01:03:34,900
Well, of course.
He has been expecting you.

634
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:36,070
Follow me.

635
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:03,930
Here he is at last.
Neo, the One himself.

636
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:05,520
Right?

637
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:08,020
And the legendary Morpheus.

638
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:13,730
And Trinity, of course.
I have heard so much.

639
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:17,360
You honor me. Please, sit. Join us.
This is my wife, Persephone.

640
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:21,580
Something to eat? Drink?

641
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:24,910
Of course, such things are contrivances,
like so much here.

642
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,580
For the sake of appearances.

643
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:31,210
- No, thank you.
- Yes, of course. Who has time?

644
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:36,470
Who has time? But then, if we do not ever
take time, how can we ever have time?

645
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:43,560
Chteau Haut-Briond, 1959.
Magnificent wine.

646
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:46,640
I love French wine
like I love the French language.

647
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:50,980
I have sampled every language. French
is my favorite. Fantastic language...

648
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:53,320
...especially to curse with.

649
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:01,820
You see? It's like wiping your ass
with silk. I love it.

650
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:05,200
You know why we are here.

651
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:11,830
I am a trafficker of information.
I know everything I can.

652
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:18,090
The question is,
do you know why you are here?

653
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,890
We are looking for the Keymaker.

654
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:26,020
Oh, yes, it is true.
The Keymaker, of course.

655
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:29,140
But this is not a reason,
this is not a why.

656
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:33,110
The Keymaker himself, his very nature,
is a means, it is not an end.

657
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:38,990
And so to look for him is to be
looking for a means to do...

658
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,320
- ... what?
- You know the answer to that question.

659
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:44,620
But do you?

660
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:47,200
You think you do, but you do not.

661
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:50,540
You are here
because you were sent here.

662
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:53,830
You were told to come here,
and then you obeyed.

663
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,380
It is, of course, the way of all things.

664
01:05:57,550 --> 01:06:00,170
You see, there is only one constant...

665
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:04,550
...one universal. It is the only real truth.

666
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,350
Causality.

667
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,810
Action, reaction.

668
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:13,190
- Cause and effect.
- Everything begins with choice.

669
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:15,110
No. Wrong.

670
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:19,860
Choice is an illusion created
between those with power...

671
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:22,110
...and those without.

672
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:26,830
Look there at that woman.

673
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:31,460
My God, just look at her...

674
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:34,380
...affecting everyone around her.

675
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:39,300
So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring.
But wait.

676
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:43,340
Watch. You see, I have sent her
a dessert...

677
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:47,720
...a very special dessert.

678
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:54,560
I wrote it myself.

679
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:57,900
It starts so simply...

680
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:02,650
...each line of the program creating
a new effect, just like...

681
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:05,320
...poetry.

682
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:06,910
First...

683
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:12,870
...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.

684
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:16,040
You can see it, Neo, yes?

685
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:19,250
She does not understand why.

686
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,920
Is it the wine? No.

687
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:24,470
What is it then? What is the reason?

688
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:27,430
And soon it does not matter.

689
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,600
Soon the why and the reason are gone...

690
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:37,100
...and all that matters is the
feeling itself.

691
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:40,650
And this is the nature of the universe.

692
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:43,400
We struggle against it,
we fight to deny it...

693
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:46,110
...but it is, of course, pretense.
It is a lie.

694
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:50,280
Beneath our poised appearance...

695
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:55,750
...the truth is, we are completely...

696
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:01,500
...out of control.

697
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:11,720
Causality. There is no escape from it.
We are forever slaves to it.

698
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:17,600
Our only hope, our only peace, is
to understand it, to understand the why.

699
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:21,190
"Why" is what separates us from them...

700
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:23,650
...you from me.

701
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:27,570
"Why" is the only real source of power.
Without it, you are powerless.

702
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:31,030
And this is how you come to me,
without why, without power.

703
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:34,000
Another link in the chain.

704
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,500
But fear not.

705
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:39,540
Since I have seen how good you are
at following orders...

706
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:42,380
...I will tell you what to do next.

707
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:47,680
Run back and give the fortuneteller
this message:

708
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:52,140
Her time is almost up.

709
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:56,730
Now I have some real business to do,
so I will say adieu and goodbye.

710
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:59,400
- This isn't over.
- Oh, yes, it is.

711
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:04,940
The Keymaker is mine, and I see no
reason why I should give him up.

712
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:10,160
- No reason at all.
- Where are you going?

713
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:15,080
Please, ma chrie, I have told you.
We are all victims of causality.

714
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:18,540
I drank too much wine,
I must take a piss.

715
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:22,170
Cause and effect. Au revoir.

716
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:30,340
Touch me and that hand
will never touch anything again.

717
01:09:39,190 --> 01:09:40,690
Well, that didn't go so well.

718
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:43,230
Are you certain the Oracle
didn't say anything else?

719
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,570
- Yes.
- Maybe we did something wrong.

720
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:47,570
Or didn't do something.

721
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:50,950
No, what happened couldn't have
happened any other way.

722
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:54,910
- How do you know?
- We are still alive.

723
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:00,410
If you want the Keymaker, follow me.
