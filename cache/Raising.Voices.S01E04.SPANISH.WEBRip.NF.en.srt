1
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,760
People are assholes, I swear.

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,840
Christian and the rest are shitty cowards.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,640
You get me, right?

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,440
I don't think burning uniforms
is so crazy. What about it?

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,880
And me being stark naked is a lie.

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,200
It's cheap gossip.

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,240
But sure, now everyone's looking at me
as if I were crazy.

8
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,320
Hey, are you listening to me?

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,720
Do you know who that is?

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,720
One of the new guys.

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,600
My God, I'd fuck his brains out.

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,600
A lot of muscle, but not much brain.

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,960
I don't care if he's got no brains.
Have you seen him?

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,240
He's a Greek god.

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,120
-Come on.
-Girl...

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Come on, let's go.

17
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,960
{\an8}RAISING VOICES

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,240
{\an8}<i>I made this T-shirt
to remind myself of how stupid I was.</i>

19
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,920
<i>A way to punish myself.</i>

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,240
POSTING

21
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,320
<i>I got myself into this.</i>

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,680
{\an8}#TOTALLYFUCKEDUPBUTSTILLSMILING

23
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,760
{\an8}<i>It was my fault.</i>

24
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,760
Shut the fuck up.

25
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,360
You're all so lame.
Shut the fuck up. Shut it.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,120
Turn it off, asshole.

27
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,760
Wait, Nata.

28
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,920
Nata!

29
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,520
Nata!

30
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,240
Nata!

31
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,040
I'm always running after you.
What the hell's wrong?

32
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,280
I'm going home.

33
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,000
I'll walk you to the bus.

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,240
-No need.
-No, Nata.

35
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,520
<i>It was Valentine's Day, dammit.</i>

36
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,440
Nata!

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,520
<i>I expected something nice,
and I got a shitty date.</i>

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,520
<i>I should've gone home much sooner,</i>

39
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,440
<i>but I was mortified
about explaining to my mother</i>

40
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,280
<i>that I'm going out with an idiot.</i>

41
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,480
<i>I just never learn.</i>

42
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,400
<i>Instead of a romantic night in a hotel,
he sticks me in a garage with his buddies.</i>

43
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,000
AN UNFORGETTABLE WEEKEND!

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,960
<i>Then this guy turned up and...</i>

45
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,400
<i>I swear, at that point,
I didn't give a damn.</i>

46
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,520
<i>That's fucking scary, girl.</i>

47
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,680
I ask myself, what's a boyfriend for
if I can't get home safe?

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,960
Maybe you should find someone
who cares how you feel.

49
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,520
I obviously don't come
because we have no privacy.

50
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,360
Don't you see he won't change?

51
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,000
Really.

52
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,600
If you want things done right,
you have to do them yourself.

53
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,520
That's what my mom always says.

54
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,240
Right, I didn't mean that.

55
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,360
Right.

56
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,680
Girls, shall we go back?

57
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

58
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,920
FEBRUARY

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,160
LIBRARY

60
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,520
Can I get my phone?

61
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,120
I just want to check my messages, please.

62
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,200
Ten minutes. In the box on the shelf.

63
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,240
YOU'RE A SLUT.

64
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,040
<i>-Alma!</i>
-Hey.

65
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,360
<i>They gave you your phone back.</i>

66
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,800
Yeah, for ten minutes.

67
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,000
And only after I've studied,
and if I ask <i>really</i> nicely.

68
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,280
<i>It's about time.</i>

69
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,400
The Dorayakis aren't on offer anymore,
and I was spending a fortune.

70
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,640
It's not so bad without a phone.

71
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,320
I have more time to study,

72
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,000
<i>even to read.</i>

73
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,440
What do you read?

74
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,400
<i>Well, your letter,</i>

75
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,840
<i>before I go to sleep.</i>

76
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,240
You should be a writer.

77
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,800
It's so beautiful.

78
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,360
I wrote it from the heart.

79
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,960
I know that.

80
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
I remembered something.

81
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,880
From the summer
they took you out of school.

82
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,520
We were the saddest pair in the world.

83
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,760
<i>We'd spend the day lying around,</i>

84
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,760
doing nothing, not talking.

85
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,880
But it didn't matter.
What mattered was we were together.

86
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,200
<i>Now everybody knows everything
about everyone,</i>

87
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,720
<i>and they tell everything, and that's...</i>

88
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,360
<i>It's like emotional porn.</i>

89
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,600
<i>"Emotional porn"?</i>

90
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,440
<i>It's from one of my mother's books.</i>

91
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,160
<i>I love you loads, Alma.</i>

92
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,360
And I love you.

93
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,160
I'm fine, okay?

94
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,280
<i>Don't worry.</i>

95
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,520
Okay.

96
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,400
{\an8}PENELOPE SAYS GOOD NIGHT

97
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,000
"Time to turn the lights off."

98
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,920
"And where's Penelope?"

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,040
"Do you see her?"

100
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,640
She's here!

101
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,280
Good girl!

102
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,640
Now off to sleep. It's very late.

103
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,960
<i>-Will you read it to me again?
-Again?</i>

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,320
You'll catch a cold.

105
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,200
What are you doing?

106
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,800
There's a leak in the junk room.

107
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,000
Look, <i>Penelope.</i>

108
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,000
"The frying pan is too heavy,
and it hits Penelope in the face."

109
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,440
Bam!

110
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,000
I loved this.

111
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,040
See if anything else is worth keeping,
and we'll toss the rest.

112
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,560
It's my stuff.

113
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,280
It's taking up space,
and you don't even remember what's here.

114
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,400
I spent my afternoons with these toys.

115
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,880
You too.

116
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,240
Alma, I went to the trouble
of packing them up and storing them away.

117
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,800
-What? Wait, I'll help...
-I'll take them.

118
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,040
I don't want your help.

119
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,760
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hello.

120
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,360
-Hi.
-Hi.

121
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,480
-I brought you this.
-You'd better come in.

122
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,520
-Okay.
-We can have a drink if you like.

123
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,120
Okay.

124
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,880
Have you seen
those YouTube fireplace videos?

125
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,600
I'm embarrassed to think
of someone sitting with some wine,

126
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,360
putting on a fake fire,
and turning out the lights.

127
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,960
Maybe it's a paradigm
of how bad society is doing.

128
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,000
Greta's a Nordic name.
Do you have family in Sweden,

129
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,080
Denmark, or somewhere like that?

130
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,200
-No?
-No.

131
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,080
When I was little, they told me
the story of <i>Hansel and Gretel</i>

132
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,440
and the candy house.

133
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,720
Where did you leave Hansel?

134
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,200
There is no Hansel.

135
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,400
So you're alone in the woods.

136
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,320
I really think there's a need for some

137
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,840
feminist revisionism
of traditional fairy tales.

138
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Because, look...

139
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,920
The witch...

140
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,480
Well,

141
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,720
I think she's just an independent woman...

142
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,280
who's attracted to Gretel

143
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,080
and lures her to her house with candy,

144
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,840
and once inside, she makes her do

145
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,600
everything she wants.

146
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,040
And...

147
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,280
Gretel loves it.

148
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,120
You can do what you like with me.

149
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,720
The Brothers Grimm were German, right?

150
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,680
What?

151
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,280
-Gosh, I'm boring you to death.
-No.

152
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,800
It was me. You mentioned that story,
and I drifted off...

153
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,960
I'm sorry. Besides, it's Friday,

154
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,520
and I'm sure you've got
better things to be doing.

155
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,800
So, shall we meet up next week?

156
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,840
Okay.

157
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,040
-No problem.
-Okay?

158
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,240
Can you go get your brother?

159
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,120
Where is he?

160
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,640
At his friend Eli's house.

161
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,720
Jeez, Mom, it's two blocks,
and he's ten. Can't he come back alone?

162
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,440
Do you know
how many ten-year-olds get run over?

163
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,200
They've shut themselves
in the upstairs room. One second.

164
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,640
-We were in the middle of a game.
-You've been on for hours. Let's go.

165
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,960
Mom, can Álex sleep here this weekend?

166
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,800
No, honey, we're going skiing tomorrow.

167
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,200
-Maybe next weekend, okay?
-Great.

168
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,400
Let's go.

169
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,680
I HAVE A PLAN FOR THIS WEEKEND
YOU'LL GO FREAKING CRAZY

170
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,880
ALBERTO:
GREAT!!!

171
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,520
Come here.

172
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,600
Change sides and catch!

173
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,720
Go!

174
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,560
How's school?

175
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,720
Fine.

176
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,280
I'm getting some good grades,

177
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,680
and Nata and her study group
are helping me with notes.

178
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,400
Will you pass?

179
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,800
Yes.

180
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,120
Yes, I'll pass.

181
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,960
I'll work really hard, and I'll get there.

182
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,120
We can go shopping later if you like.

183
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm sure you need something.

184
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,120
I'd love to,

185
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,280
but I can't.

186
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,640
I have a lot to catch up on
and not much time to do it.

187
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,040
Besides, Greta

188
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,560
said she wanted to come
to see me this afternoon.

189
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,640
Can she?

190
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,520
Okay with you?

191
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,640
Sure.

192
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,440
I fixed the leak.

193
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,720
No more water in the junk room.

194
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,040
We can put the boxes
with your stuff back in there.

195
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,640
Cool.

196
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:31,080
Jeez, it's like... Sometimes I go nuts
and watch him eat for hours.

197
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,960
The noise is fucking gross, Berta.

198
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,920
It's far-out, even for you.

199
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,920
It's the algorithm.

200
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,080
It's like it brings out
the worst in me, you know?

201
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,040
It's like an inner god.

202
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,840
Like the keeper of my secrets,

203
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,880
like an invisible friend
who knows me best.

204
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,440
Yes, and you too.

205
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,000
-Me?
-Yes.

206
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,200
-Look, I'll show you.
-No.

207
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,640
No, I want the link
between the algorithm and me

208
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,440
to be totally private, thanks.

209
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,520
-You're hiding something, Alma.
-What do you mean?

210
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,800
-Come on, I can tell.
-No, Berta, don't go all psycho.

211
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
I know you.

212
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,280
Okay.

213
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,520
I'll stop.

214
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,640
Whoa, this is the best!

215
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,880
Let's go.

216
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,720
The keys are in that pot.

217
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,760
Come on.

218
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
There's no one here.

219
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,920
-Come on.
-Hey.

220
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,800
Hey, come here.

221
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,200
Goddammit.

222
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,040
-Awesome!
-Wow!

223
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,640
Amazing!

224
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,600
No fucking way. We're doing it right.

225
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,640
Put this on and make dinner
while I fix myself up.

226
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,280
-Go on.
-Okay.

227
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,840
I really need to pee.
Where's the bathroom?

228
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,760
-Down the hall, on the right.
-Okay.

229
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,640
Berta.

230
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,160
Sorry, I couldn't find the bathroom.

231
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,920
Use the one in the hall.

232
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,520
First door on the left.

233
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,200
Okay, I'm really sorry.

234
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,240
It's all right.

235
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,480
-Didn't you get dressed?
-This is it, idiot.

236
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,080
You're fucking awesome, Nata.

237
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,640
Dinner?

238
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,480
-Sure, come on.
-Come on.

239
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,360
-S'il vous plaît.
-Thanks.

240
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,720
Watch the door!

241
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,920
Now we're ready.

242
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,880
Whoa!

243
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,600
Stop.

244
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,320
Not like that.

245
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,640
If you come, I'll kill you.

246
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,040
Did you come?

247
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,080
Of course.

248
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,400
I'm such an asshole.

249
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,240
Why?

250
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,920
How the fuck

251
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
did I ever think
your brother wanted to be with me?

252
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,840
Have you seen me?

253
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,640
Anyway, the girls he was talking to...

254
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,120
They weren't that hot.

255
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,840
If he'd been a bit wasted,
I could've denied it all.

256
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,320
Are you done?

257
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,880
Don't ever say anything like that again.

258
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,600
Alma, you're amazing.

259
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,280
And you're the bravest girl I've ever met.

260
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,200
Alma.

261
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,320
Goddammit!

262
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,160
I mean, you're...

263
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,240
You're Alma,

264
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,120
you know?

265
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,720
Sometimes I forget.

266
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
Okay.

267
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,120
Well, don't ever forget it.

268
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,320
What?

269
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,600
Are we leaving it like this, or what?

270
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,120
What are you doing?

271
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,680
Fuck!

272
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,240
SLUT

1 NEW MESSAGE

275
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,960
LIKE MY DICK, BITCH?

276
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,160
Fuck it.

277
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,600
What the fuck are you talking about?

278
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,200
-What?
-You're talking about me?

279
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,160
No, we're talking about Christian.

280
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,080
He made out with a girl in junior high.

281
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,960
The next day he acted
like he didn't know her.

282
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,400
What's so funny about that?

283
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,040
Hey, Alma. Take it easy, okay?

284
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,840
You've been a pain in the ass lately.

285
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,680
Are you playing with me, Hernán?

286
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,360
Playing what?
I don't know what you're talking about.

287
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,240
Look, if this is
some shitty revenge, stop it, okay?

288
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,160
Right now, I'm the last person
you should play a joke on.

289
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,400
You have to look much sluttier.

290
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,280
-Slutty like how?
-Push your boobs up.

291
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,400
And open your mouth a bit.

292
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,280
Like that.

293
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,240
That's it.

294
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,560
Don't take those shitty photos
of yourselves.

295
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,520
Listen to her! What the fuck
do you care what we do?

296
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,400
Don't take any fucking notice.

297
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,080
That's all we fucking need.
Miss Morality on her high horse.

298

DELETE THIS PHOTO? DELETE

300
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,160
Watch out for this topic
because it always comes up in the SATs.

301
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,560
And it's not easy.

302
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,760
A lot of general knowledge, dates, laws...

303
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,840
And I'll finish this line next week.
Right, bye.

304
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,880
How are you?

305
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,840
Fine.

306
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,600
Look, I'm going to steal
Bernardo's exclusive.

307
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,440
You passed the first economics assessment.

308
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,400
-What?
-Well done.

309
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,920
Really?

310
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,600
-Thank you.
-No, thank <i>you.</i>

311
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,480
For what?

312
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,080
When I give up a student for lost,

313
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,200
and then see they're not,

314
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,400
I take it as a gift.

315
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,040
You put that very nicely.

316
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,640
You're doing great.

317
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,080
What the hell's up with her?
Moping around all day...

318
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,960
I don't know.

319
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,280
You do know. Tell me.

320
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,960
I'm telling you I don't know.

321
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,080
Who knows what she's been taking?

322
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,760
Don't talk like that about Alma.
She's my friend.

323
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,920
-She doesn't like me either.
-I don't care. I don't like it.

324
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,560
If she's a slut, then what am I?

325
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,480
After the other night,

326
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,760
you're a fucking crazy criminal.

327
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,400
Shut up. They'll hear us.
And don't talk to me like that.

328
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,320
All right, okay.

329
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,080
Jeez, what a temper.

330
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,040
Greta, have you seen my headphones?

331
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,200
In my room.

332
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,680
By the way, any news of Alma?

333
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,720
For someone who's not into her,
you're very interested.

334
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,120
No, I just feel responsible
for what happened at the party.

335
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,760
Right.

336
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,760
Well...

337
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,800
She's fine. I saw her, and she's fine.

338
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,720
Okay.

339
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,840
Hey, did you take some of my weed?

340
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,520
A little to smoke
with the guys in class, but very little.

341
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,520
Right.

342
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,880
I'm missing more.

343
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,280
Ciao.

344
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,240
The last book you read.

345
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,760
<i>Americanah.</i>

346
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,960
A word you hate.

347
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,840
Urine.

348
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,080
It's awful.

349
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,480
It's awful.

350
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,600
-I'm rolling a joint. Do you mind?
-No.

351
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,960
-Use some of mine if you like.
-No.

352
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,040
I don't like to use my customers' weed.

353
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,720
Do you have many?

354
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,640
Professional secret.

355
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,600
Just kidding.

356
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,600
I don't even do this for a living.

357
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,400
I just know people with good weed

358
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,200
and pass it to people I like.

359
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,160
That's it. I don't make anything.
Just smoke for free.

360
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,280
In fact, you're subsidizing this joint.

361
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,960
So you like me.

362
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,840
You know the answer already.

363
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,960
Come on, let's keep going.

364
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,840
Your turn.

365
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,040
How was it your first time?

366
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,160
Dammit!

367
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,640
Look, it's like...

368
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,960
I haven't finished rolling, and already

369
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,400
I'm getting a bit dirty.

370
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,440
-No, here goes.
-Sorry.

371
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,560
I can only think of asking
dirty stuff, okay?

372
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,880
I don't know what to do.

373
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,920
Wake up, Alma! It's my birthday!

374
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,080
Let's go!

375
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,360
Party!

376
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,800
Come here.

377
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,800
Take it easy, kids. Take it outside.

378
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,800
-You're the clown on the cake?
-Who?

379
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,040
What's this?

380
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,520
Okay.

381
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,520
Yes.

382
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,560
It's Pablito's birthday.

383
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,000
Thank you for volunteering.
You're welcome.

384
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,000
I think my mother
would rather have you as a daughter.

385
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,520
All the girls over 40 are into me.

386
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,240
Did I miss something?

387
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,240
Okay.

388
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,240
I have something wild to tell you.

389
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,160
All right.

390
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,040
Look.

391
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,720
I've become the dealer...

392
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:03,160
for a girl well in her 30s,
and I really like her.

393
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,320
What?

394
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,720
Where did she come from?

395
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,600
I met her in the supermarket.

396
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,960
I've dealt to her a few times.

397
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,040
I've spent three Saturdays at her house.

398
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,480
-Have you made out?
-No.

399
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,840
Not yet.

400
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,320
But I jerk off thinking about her.

401
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,480
Fuck, Greta.

402
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,600
I bet you jerk off
thinking about my mother.

403
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,960
Don't you jerk off
thinking about my mother?

404
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,880
No.

405
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,640
No.

406
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,520
I love you loads.

407
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,880
-I love you sometimes.
-Sure.

408
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,280
I'm getting a drink, okay?

409
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,440
Your kids are really excited
about the vacation you promised them.

410
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,240
No, I'm not sorting out your shit!

411
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,080
Come and tell them to their faces,
if you can!

412
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,320
No, you listen to me!

413
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,080
Own your responsibilities.

414
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,320
Yes, I know you have a girlfriend,
but you also have three kids.

415
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,040
WHAT YOU DOING? I NEED TO GET OUT.

416
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,160
Why do I have to take care of everything?

417
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,200
I'm so fed up with you!

418
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,120
LILY:
COME TO MINE

419
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
You know what? Fuck off.

420
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,560
COOL!!!

421
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,920
One, two, and three!

422
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,760
Bring on the candy!

423
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,320
Yay!

424
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,320
Yes!

425
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,680
That's it.

426
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,640
What if... Take him some.

427
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,760
Take him a piece.

428
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,080
Okay.

429
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,560
Hi there.

430
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,120
Anyone want some cake? I made it myself.

431
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,040
I do.

432
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,680
Greta asked me to go for a walk
around the neighborhood. Can I?

433
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,600
The cake is delicious.

434
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,040
She deserves it.

435
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,880
I'll be back at 10:00.

436
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,400
Yes?

437
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,040
Yes.

438
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,760
Thanks for saving me.

439
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,000
It was a great plan.

440
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,040
-Do you want to go back?
-No.

441
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,520
-Let's go back.
-No way.

442
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,800
What do you want to do?

443
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,880
I want to show you something.

444
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,000
Okay.

445
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,080
I was sent this photo

446
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,160
and another two dick pics.

447
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,880
Who the fuck sent you this?

448
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,480
He used a nickname.

449
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,480
PutoAlfucking.

450
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,840
-What a fucking clown.
-Right.

451
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,480
You're sure you don't know who sent it?

452
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,240
Alma, can you tell me now, please?

453
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,480
Okay.

454
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,720
The night of the party,

455
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,680
when you went for the coats...

456
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,600
<i>someone turned up.</i>

457
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,960
What are you doing here?

458
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,400
<i>I was really fucked up.</i>

459
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,720
And I didn't want to see your brother.

460
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,680
Or you.

461
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,240
Please, get me out of here.

462
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,160
<i>I swear I wasn't thinking
of disappearing like that,</i>

463
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,760
<i>but the Molly took over,
everything started spinning, and...</i>

464
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,840
<i>I didn't want my parents
to see me like that.</i>

465
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,960
<i>So I asked him to take me to his place.</i>

466
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,160
<i>I didn't know what I was doing.</i>

467
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,360
And I thought

468
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,880
that maybe fucking Hernán

469
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,680
<i>would make me feel better.</i>

470
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,520
<i>But it wasn't a good idea.</i>

471
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,040
The next day,

472
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,440
I had the world's worst hangover,

473
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,760
<i>and I just wanted to run out of there.</i>

474
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,720
-Where are you going?
-My coat?

475
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,000
You didn't have a coat.

476
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,680
Shit, fuck.

477
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,600
-What's wrong?
-This didn't happen, okay?

478
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,040
Don't you dare tell anyone!

479
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,760
Wait, Alma. Alma!

480
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,200
Why didn't you tell me?

481
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,440
I don't know.

482
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,040
I guess I had to process it,
and I was ashamed.

483
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,960
Come here, please.

484
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,640
Greta...

485
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,280
what if Hernán sent the photos?

486
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,240
Then send him a message.

487
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,880
-Now?
-Yes.

488
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,440
Tell him you want to see him.

489
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,560
Berta, what's bothering you so much?

490
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,840
I don't know.
He talks like it's for the Tate Modern.

491
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,600
It's not like that. It's just a show
at the local cultural center.

492
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,120
-Where's the bathroom?
-At the end of the hall.

493
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,120
Are you drinking that?

494
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,320
He's famous. What are you saying?

495
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,360
-Hey, girls.
-They let you out.

496
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,480
-You see? I'll be right back.
-How are you?

497
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,160
What's up, Gretix?

498
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,760
What did you want to talk about?

499
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,400
I want to show you something.

500
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,600
-Maybe you've seen it, huh?
-Let's see.

501
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,680
Did you take it?

502
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,680
No. No way.

503
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,480
-What's this?
-It's this fucking photo.

504
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,960
And this one.
Is this your dick? Or is this it?

505
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,080
Are you crazy?
I've got nothing to do with that.

506
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,240
I don't do that shit.

507
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,960
-Give me your phone.
-What?

508
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,320
Give her your damn phone, Hernán.

509
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,640
Give it to her. Now.

510
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,560
-Fuck, give it to her!
-Okay.

511
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,480
Here.

512
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,280
Here.

513
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,600
I wouldn't do that.

514
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,600
We're friends.

515
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,440
Look, Hernán,

516
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,520
a friend doesn't pull down your panties
and fuck you

517
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,120
when you're wasted
and someone's just broken your heart.

518
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,760
What did you tell her?

519
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,080
The truth.

520
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,200
We fucked because you wanted to.
I didn't force you.

521
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,000
In fact...

522
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,640
if anyone took advantage, you did of me.

523
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,160
-You left me there like a piece of shit.
-What? Bullshit, Hernán.

524
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,800
Don't you get it, Greta?

525
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,600
You're the one who doesn't get it.

526
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,360
Okay?

527
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,680
You couldn't wait to fuck her

528
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,200
and made the most
of her being wasted to do it.

529
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,920
Alma.

530
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,680
You're disgusting, man.

531
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,880
A real friend would've left me
at my front door.

532
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,640
Look, man, I think you should get lost.

533
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,320
-You're kidding me, right?
-No.

534
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,880
-You're shitting me, right?
-Beat it.

535
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,320
Beat it.

536
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,840
This is bullshit, man.

537
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,200
This is fucking bullshit.

538
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,160
Alma.

539
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,000
It was okay outside. No damage.

540
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,680
We came in, the couch was slit...

541
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,560
Hey.

542
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,480
You didn't do anything wrong, okay?

543
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,000
Just forget about it.

544
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,800
I'm thinking about the photos.

545
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,040
I don't think it's Hernán.

546
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,200
Who the fuck is sending me this shit?

547
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,480
Oh, you bitch.
