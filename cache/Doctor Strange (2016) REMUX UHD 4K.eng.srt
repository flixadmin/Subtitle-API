1
00:02:24,596 --> 00:02:26,473
Master Kaecilius.

2
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,445
That ritual will bring you only sorrow.

3
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,647
Hypocrite!

4
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:05,390
Challenge round, Billy.

5
00:05:09,636 --> 00:05:11,531
Oh, come on, Billy,
you've got to be messing with me.

6
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:12,977
No, doctor.

7
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,063
Feels So Good, Chuck Mangione, 1977.

8
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,858
Honestly, Billy,
you said this one would be hard.

9
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:20,939
- It's 1978.
- No, Billy.

10
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:23,612
While Feels So Good
may have charted in 1978...

11
00:05:23,775 --> 00:05:27,154
the album was released
in December of 1977.

12
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,889
No. Wikipedia says it's a nineteen...

13
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:30,015
Check again.

14
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:32,412
Where do you store
all this useless information?

15
00:05:32,492 --> 00:05:33,493
Useless?

16
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,500
The man charted a top 10 hit
with a flugelhorn.

17
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:37,330
Status, Billy?

18
00:05:37,497 --> 00:05:38,498
1977.

19
00:05:38,665 --> 00:05:40,101
- Oh, please.
- I hate you.

20
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:43,174
Feels so good, doesn't it?

21
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:48,325
Oh, I got this, Stephen.

22
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:50,302
You've done your bit.
Go ahead. We'll close up.

23
00:05:51,386 --> 00:05:52,386
What is it?

24
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:53,643
GSW.

25
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:56,253
It's amazing you kept him alive.

26
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:57,871
Apneic, failed the brain stem test...

27
00:05:58,101 --> 00:05:59,318
and the apnea reflex test.

28
00:05:59,436 --> 00:06:02,030
I think I found the problem,
Doctor Palmer.

29
00:06:02,272 --> 00:06:03,774
You left a bullet in his head.

30
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:05,626
Thanks. It's impinging on the medulla.

31
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,053
I needed a specialist.
Nic diagnosed brain death.

32
00:06:08,153 --> 00:06:09,953
Something about that
doesn't feel right to me.

33
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:10,989
We have to run.

34
00:06:12,532 --> 00:06:13,533
Doctor West.

35
00:06:13,784 --> 00:06:15,036
What are you doing? Hey.

36
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,537
Organ harvest. He's a donor.

37
00:06:16,995 --> 00:06:18,389
Slow down. I did not agree to that.

38
00:06:18,413 --> 00:06:20,391
I don't need you to.
We've already called brain death.

39
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,517
Prematurely.
We need to get him prepped

40
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,701
for sub-occipital craniotomy.

41
00:06:22,876 --> 00:06:24,503
Not gonna let you operate
on a dead man.

42
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:26,047
What do you see?

43
00:06:26,254 --> 00:06:28,097
- A bullet?
- A perfect bullet.

44
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,140
It's been hardened. You harden a bullet
by alloying lead with antimony.

45
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:34,851
A toxic metal. And that's leeched
directly into the cerebral spinal fluid.

46
00:06:35,097 --> 00:06:36,699
Rapid onset central
nervous system shutdown.

47
00:06:36,723 --> 00:06:37,724
We gotta go.

48
00:06:37,974 --> 00:06:39,368
The patient's not dead, but he is dying.

49
00:06:39,392 --> 00:06:40,814
Still want to harvest his organs?

50
00:06:41,895 --> 00:06:43,380
- I'll assist you.
- No.

51
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,357
Doctor Palmer will assist me.

52
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:03,174
Thank you.

53
00:07:09,673 --> 00:07:11,425
Image guidance, stat.

54
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:13,093
We don't have time for that.

55
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:14,886
You can't do it freehand.

56
00:07:15,095 --> 00:07:16,221
I can and I will.

57
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:18,151
This isn't a time
for showing off, Strange.

58
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,390
How about 10 minutes ago

59
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:22,068
when you called
the wrong time of death?

60
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:32,621
Cranial nerves intact.

61
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,939
Doctor West, cover your watch.

62
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:45,328
You know, you didn't have to
humiliate him in front of everyone.

63
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:46,913
I didn't have to save his patient, either.

64
00:08:46,937 --> 00:08:49,631
But I sometimes just can't help myself.

65
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:51,091
Nic is a great doctor.

66
00:08:51,191 --> 00:08:52,342
You came to me.

67
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:53,878
Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.

68
00:08:53,902 --> 00:08:54,970
You had a second opinion.

69
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,510
What you needed was a competent one.

70
00:08:56,571 --> 00:08:57,639
Well, all the more reason

71
00:08:57,739 --> 00:08:58,841
why you should be
my neurosurgeon on call.

72
00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:00,308
You could make such a difference.

73
00:09:00,408 --> 00:09:01,977
I can't work in your butcher shop.

74
00:09:02,077 --> 00:09:03,145
Hey!

75
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:04,388
I'm fusing transected spinal cords.

76
00:09:04,412 --> 00:09:06,641
I'm stimulating neurogenesis
in the central nervous system.

77
00:09:06,665 --> 00:09:09,018
The work I'm doing is gonna save
thousands for years to come.

78
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:11,444
In ER, you get to save
one drunk idiot with a gun.

79
00:09:11,544 --> 00:09:12,571
Yeah, you're right.

80
00:09:12,671 --> 00:09:14,114
In ER, we're only saving lives.

81
00:09:14,214 --> 00:09:15,991
There's no fame, there's no,

82
00:09:16,091 --> 00:09:17,742
CNN interviews.

83
00:09:17,842 --> 00:09:19,703
I guess I'll just have to stick with Nic.

84
00:09:19,803 --> 00:09:20,829
Wait a minute.

85
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:22,209
You're not... You guys aren't...

86
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:23,498
What?

87
00:09:23,598 --> 00:09:26,334
Sleeping together? Sorry, I thought
that was implicit in my disgust.

88
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:27,961
Explicit, actually.

89
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:30,297
No, I have a very strict rule
against dating colleagues.

90
00:09:30,397 --> 00:09:31,397
Oh, really?

91
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:32,625
I call it the "Strange Policy."

92
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:35,198
Oh, well, good, I'm glad
something's named after me.

93
00:09:35,777 --> 00:09:37,620
I invented a laminectomy procedure.

94
00:09:37,862 --> 00:09:40,591
And yet, somehow no one seems to want
to call it the "Strange Technique."

95
00:09:40,615 --> 00:09:42,117
We invented that technique.

96
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:44,703
Regardless, I'm very flattered
by your policy.

97
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:50,049
I'm talking tonight
at a Neurological Society dinner.

98
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,460
Come with me.

99
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:53,320
Another speaking engagement?

100
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,421
So romantic.

101
00:09:54,671 --> 00:09:56,482
You used to love coming
to those things with me.

102
00:09:56,506 --> 00:09:57,741
We had fun together.

103
00:09:57,841 --> 00:09:59,492
No! You had fun.

104
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:01,390
They weren't about us,
they were about you.

105
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:03,556
Not only about me.

106
00:10:03,805 --> 00:10:06,649
Stephen. Everything is about you.

107
00:10:07,267 --> 00:10:09,144
Maybe we could hyphenate.

108
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:11,313
Strange-Palmer Technique.

109
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:13,277
Palmer-Strange.

110
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,618
Billy.

111
00:11:02,906 --> 00:11:03,932
What have you got for me?

112
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:05,676
I've got a 35-year-old
Air Force Colonel...

113
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,561
crushed his lower spine
in some kind of experimental armor.

114
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:10,038
Mid-thoracic burst fracture.

115
00:11:10,246 --> 00:11:11,589
Yeah, well, I could help...

116
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:12,991
but so could 50 other people.

117
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,509
Find me something worth my time.

118
00:11:14,793 --> 00:11:17,967
I have a 68-year-old female
with an advanced brain stem glioma.

119
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:20,799
Yeah, you want me to screw up
my perfect record?

120
00:11:20,965 --> 00:11:22,325
Definitely not.

121
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:23,745
How about a 22-year-old female...

122
00:11:24,928 --> 00:11:27,073
with an electronic implant in her brain
to control schizophrenia...

123
00:11:27,097 --> 00:11:28,290
struck by lightning?

124
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,937
That does sound interesting.

125
00:11:31,684 --> 00:11:33,231
Can you send me the...

126
00:11:33,436 --> 00:11:35,154
Got it.

127
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:37,959
Hey.

128
00:12:39,711 --> 00:12:41,759
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

129
00:12:55,852 --> 00:12:57,775
What did they do?

130
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:01,216
They rushed you in a chopper.

131
00:13:01,316 --> 00:13:03,410
But it took a little while to find you.

132
00:13:04,402 --> 00:13:07,639
The golden hours for nerve damage
went by while you were in the car.

133
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:10,413
What did they do?

134
00:13:13,536 --> 00:13:16,289
11 stainless steel pins in the bones.

135
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:19,341
Multiple torn ligaments...

136
00:13:20,168 --> 00:13:22,512
severe nerve damage in both hands.

137
00:13:23,796 --> 00:13:25,990
You were on the table for 11 hours.

138
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,013
Look at these fixators.

139
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:31,604
No one could have done better.

140
00:13:37,727 --> 00:13:39,946
I could have done better.

141
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,551
No.

142
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:12,307
Give your body time to heal.

143
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:15,723
You've ruined me.

144
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:18,285
How long until I can take...

145
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:19,377
Doctor Strange.

146
00:14:19,477 --> 00:14:21,087
Those tissues are still healing.

147
00:14:21,187 --> 00:14:22,234
So, speed it up.

148
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,074
Pass a stent down the brachial artery
into the radial artery.

149
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,151
It's possible.

150
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:31,202
Experimental and expensive,
but possible.

151
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:33,204
All I need is possible.

152
00:14:56,764 --> 00:14:57,765
Up.

153
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:00,226
Up.

154
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:02,729
Show me your strength.

155
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:09,535
This is useless.

156
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:12,781
It's not useless, man. You can do this.

157
00:15:13,698 --> 00:15:16,292
All right, answer me this,
bachelor's degree.

158
00:15:16,534 --> 00:15:19,020
Have you ever known anyone
with nerve damage

159
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,713
this severe to do this...

160
00:15:20,872 --> 00:15:22,023
and actually recover?

161
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:23,650
One guy, yeah.

162
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,194
Factory accident, broke his back...

163
00:15:26,294 --> 00:15:28,717
paralyzed, his leg wasted away.

164
00:15:28,838 --> 00:15:30,031
He had pain in his shoulder,

165
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:31,132
from the wheelchair.

166
00:15:31,424 --> 00:15:33,768
He came in three times a week.

167
00:15:33,885 --> 00:15:35,125
Then one day he stopped coming.

168
00:15:35,303 --> 00:15:37,121
I thought he was dead.

169
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:39,315
A few years later, he walked
past me on the street.

170
00:15:39,557 --> 00:15:40,875
- Walked?
- Yeah, walked.

171
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:43,854
Bullshit.
Show me his file.

172
00:15:44,187 --> 00:15:46,631
It'll take me a while to
pull the files from the archive.

173
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:49,154
But if it proves
your arrogant ass wrong...

174
00:15:49,734 --> 00:15:50,906
Worth it.

175
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:07,819
I looked at all your research...

176
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,138
I read all the papers you've sent.

177
00:16:10,296 --> 00:16:12,014
It's not gonna work.

178
00:16:12,173 --> 00:16:13,658
I don't think you realize...

179
00:16:13,758 --> 00:16:16,244
- how severe the damages are.
- Here's the thing...

180
00:16:16,344 --> 00:16:17,584
The best have tried and failed.

181
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:20,352
I understand. Here's the thing.

182
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,563
What you want from me
is impossible, Stephen.

183
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:23,935
Come on.

184
00:16:24,102 --> 00:16:25,775
I've got my own reputation to consider.

185
00:16:25,937 --> 00:16:27,655
- Etienne, wait. No.
- I can't help you.

186
00:16:27,897 --> 00:16:29,257
No, no, wait!

187
00:16:35,196 --> 00:16:36,197
Hey!

188
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,167
He won't do it.

189
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,130
He's a hack.

190
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:50,778
There is a new procedure in Tokyo.

191
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:52,363
They culture donor stem cells...

192
00:16:52,463 --> 00:16:53,680
and then harvesting them

193
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:55,199
and then 3D printing a scaffold.

194
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:56,527
If I could get a loan together...

195
00:16:56,551 --> 00:16:57,552
Stephen.

196
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:59,266
A small loan, just $200,000.

197
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,490
You've always spent money
as fast as you could make it...

198
00:17:01,514 --> 00:17:03,562
but now you're spending money
you don't even have.

199
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:06,353
Maybe it's time to consider stopping.

200
00:17:07,145 --> 00:17:09,819
No, now is exactly the time not to stop...

201
00:17:09,981 --> 00:17:12,655
because, you see,
I'm not getting any better!

202
00:17:12,984 --> 00:17:14,657
But this isn't medicine anymore.

203
00:17:14,902 --> 00:17:16,495
This is mania.

204
00:17:17,363 --> 00:17:19,240
Some things just can't be fixed.

205
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,868
- Life without my work...
- Is still life.

206
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:23,118
This isn't the end.

207
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:26,040
There are other things that
can give your life meaning.

208
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,923
Like what? Like you?

209
00:17:30,376 --> 00:17:32,674
This is the part where you apologize.

210
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,638
This is the part where you leave.

211
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:38,180
Fine, I can't watch you
do this to yourself anymore.

212
00:17:38,468 --> 00:17:39,788
Oh, too difficult for you, is it?

213
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:41,854
Yes, it is.

214
00:17:42,013 --> 00:17:44,186
It breaks my heart to see you this way.

215
00:17:44,432 --> 00:17:46,434
- No, don't pity me.
- I'm not pitying you.

216
00:17:46,768 --> 00:17:47,911
Oh, yeah?
Then what are you doing here...

217
00:17:47,935 --> 00:17:50,247
bringing cheese and wine
like we're old friends going for a picnic?

218
00:17:50,271 --> 00:17:51,523
We are not friends, Christine.

219
00:17:51,773 --> 00:17:52,924
We were barely lovers.

220
00:17:53,024 --> 00:17:54,867
But you just love a sob story, don't you?

221
00:17:55,151 --> 00:17:56,323
Is that what I am to you now?

222
00:17:56,444 --> 00:17:59,072
"Poor Stephen Strange, charity case."

223
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
"He finally needs me."

224
00:18:00,364 --> 00:18:02,084
Another dreg of humanity
for you to work on.

225
00:18:02,158 --> 00:18:04,519
Patch him up and send him
back into the world...

226
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:06,104
heart's just humming.

227
00:18:06,204 --> 00:18:09,549
You care so much, don't you?

228
00:18:13,795 --> 00:18:15,047
Goodbye, Stephen.

229
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:05,788
All the way. Here we go.

230
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:07,832
Let's go! All day! All day!

231
00:19:07,932 --> 00:19:10,936
Yeah! All day.

232
00:19:11,143 --> 00:19:12,623
Come on, man!
Where's the competition?

233
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:16,782
Talk a lot.

234
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:19,135
Jonathan Pangborn...

235
00:19:19,235 --> 00:19:22,159
C7-C8 spinal cord injury, complete.

236
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,848
Who are you?

237
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:25,175
Paralyzed from the mid-chest down.

238
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:26,746
Partial paralysis in both hands.

239
00:19:26,993 --> 00:19:28,961
- I don't know you.
- I'm Stephen Strange.

240
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:32,131
I'm a neurosurgeon.
Was a neurosurgeon.

241
00:19:33,165 --> 00:19:35,839
Actually, you know what, man,
I do know you.

242
00:19:36,002 --> 00:19:38,721
I came to your office once.
You refused to see me.

243
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,302
I never got past your assistant.

244
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:43,476
You were untreatable.

245
00:19:43,968 --> 00:19:45,970
No glory for you in that, right?

246
00:19:47,972 --> 00:19:50,225
You came back from a place
there's no way back from.

247
00:19:54,645 --> 00:19:56,898
I'm trying to
find my own way back.

248
00:19:59,817 --> 00:20:01,911
Pangborn, are you in or you out?

249
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,503
All right.

250
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:14,795
I'd given up on my body.

251
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,253
I thought my mind's
the only thing I have left...

252
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:19,212
I should at least try to elevate that.

253
00:20:19,837 --> 00:20:21,839
So, I sat with gurus...

254
00:20:22,006 --> 00:20:23,633
and sacred women.

255
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:26,678
Strangers carried me to
mountaintops to see holy men.

256
00:20:26,844 --> 00:20:27,845
And finally...

257
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:30,682
I found my teacher.

258
00:20:30,848 --> 00:20:33,351
And my mind was elevated...

259
00:20:33,517 --> 00:20:34,689
and my spirit deepened.

260
00:20:35,645 --> 00:20:36,646
And somehow...

261
00:20:36,812 --> 00:20:37,813
Your body healed.

262
00:20:38,022 --> 00:20:39,023
Yes.

263
00:20:40,691 --> 00:20:42,659
There were deeper secrets
to learn there...

264
00:20:42,818 --> 00:20:44,630
but I didn't have the strength
to receive them.

265
00:20:44,654 --> 00:20:47,453
I chose to settle for my miracle
and I came back home.

266
00:20:52,828 --> 00:20:55,923
The place you're looking for
is called Kamar-Taj.

267
00:20:56,082 --> 00:20:57,334
But the cost there is high.

268
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,318
How much?

269
00:20:59,418 --> 00:21:01,091
I'm not talking about money.

270
00:21:03,214 --> 00:21:04,557
Good luck.

271
00:21:06,425 --> 00:21:08,848
Let's ball. All right, ball up!

272
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,083
Kamar-Taj?

273
00:21:31,325 --> 00:21:33,828
You know where Kamar-Taj is?

274
00:21:57,685 --> 00:21:59,278
Kamar-Taj?

275
00:22:00,271 --> 00:22:02,114
Kamar-Taj.

276
00:22:30,468 --> 00:22:31,685
Okay.

277
00:22:34,305 --> 00:22:36,307
Look, guys, I don't have any money.

278
00:22:37,016 --> 00:22:38,063
Your watch.

279
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,354
No, please. It's all I have left.

280
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,567
Your watch.

281
00:22:45,941 --> 00:22:47,158
All right.

282
00:23:27,483 --> 00:23:29,531
You're looking for Kamar-Taj.

283
00:24:00,391 --> 00:24:01,392
Really?

284
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:03,481
Sure we got the right place?

285
00:24:04,228 --> 00:24:07,732
That one looks
a little more Kamar-Tajey.

286
00:24:09,692 --> 00:24:12,286
I once stood in your place.

287
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,870
And I, too, was disrespectful.

288
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,248
So, might I offer you some advice?

289
00:24:21,245 --> 00:24:23,623
Forget everything you think you know.

290
00:24:25,916 --> 00:24:27,634
All right.

291
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,229
The sanctuary of our teacher.

292
00:24:39,388 --> 00:24:40,435
The Ancient One.

293
00:24:40,973 --> 00:24:42,374
The Ancient One?

294
00:24:42,474 --> 00:24:43,600
What's his real name?

295
00:24:45,311 --> 00:24:46,312
Right.

296
00:24:46,478 --> 00:24:48,947
Forget everything I think I know. Sorry.

297
00:24:59,992 --> 00:25:01,494
Um, thank you for...

298
00:25:03,787 --> 00:25:05,835
Okay, that's a thing.

299
00:25:06,832 --> 00:25:08,129
Thank you for...

300
00:25:08,334 --> 00:25:09,335
Hello.

301
00:25:10,252 --> 00:25:11,674
Oh, thank you.

302
00:25:12,296 --> 00:25:13,639
And thank you.

303
00:25:13,964 --> 00:25:15,762
Thank you...

304
00:25:15,925 --> 00:25:18,644
Ancient One, for seeing me.

305
00:25:18,802 --> 00:25:20,804
You're very welcome.

306
00:25:23,474 --> 00:25:24,521
The Ancient One.

307
00:25:24,683 --> 00:25:27,527
Thank you, Master Mordo.
Thank you, Master Hamir.

308
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,272
Mr. Strange.

309
00:25:29,605 --> 00:25:31,528
Doctor, actually.

310
00:25:31,815 --> 00:25:34,159
Well, no, not anymore, surely.

311
00:25:34,318 --> 00:25:35,410
Isn't that why you're here?

312
00:25:36,195 --> 00:25:37,993
You've undergone many procedures.

313
00:25:38,197 --> 00:25:40,416
- Seven, right?
- Yeah.

314
00:25:41,283 --> 00:25:43,160
It's good tea.

315
00:25:43,494 --> 00:25:44,495
Yes.

316
00:25:48,457 --> 00:25:51,506
Did you heal a man named Pangborn?

317
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:52,711
A paralyzed man?

318
00:25:52,836 --> 00:25:53,883
In a way.

319
00:25:54,046 --> 00:25:55,948
You helped him to walk again.

320
00:25:56,048 --> 00:25:57,174
Yes.

321
00:25:57,341 --> 00:26:00,891
How did you correct a complete
C7-C8 spinal cord injury?

322
00:26:01,053 --> 00:26:02,851
Well, I didn't correct it.

323
00:26:02,972 --> 00:26:04,315
He couldn't walk.

324
00:26:04,473 --> 00:26:05,816
I convinced him that he could.

325
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:07,877
You're not suggesting
it was psychosomatic?

326
00:26:07,977 --> 00:26:09,945
When you reattach a severed nerve...

327
00:26:10,187 --> 00:26:12,464
is it you who heals it
back together or the body?

328
00:26:12,564 --> 00:26:13,565
It's the cells.

329
00:26:13,857 --> 00:26:15,217
The cells are only programmed...

330
00:26:15,317 --> 00:26:17,437
to put themselves back together
in very specific ways.

331
00:26:17,486 --> 00:26:18,486
Right.

332
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:21,032
What if I told you that
your own body could be convinced...

333
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,369
to put itself back together
in all sorts of ways?

334
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:28,543
You're talking about
cellular regeneration.

335
00:26:28,706 --> 00:26:30,879
That's bleeding edge medical tech.

336
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,884
Is that why you're working here?

337
00:26:33,085 --> 00:26:35,258
Without a governing medical board?

338
00:26:35,713 --> 00:26:37,306
Just how experimental
is your treatment?

339
00:26:38,257 --> 00:26:39,383
Quite.

340
00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:42,161
So, you've figured out a way...

341
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:44,559
to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?

342
00:26:45,556 --> 00:26:47,103
No, Mr. Strange.

343
00:26:48,183 --> 00:26:50,606
I know how to reorient the spirit...

344
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:52,396
to better heal the body.

345
00:26:54,231 --> 00:26:56,905
- The spirit to heal the body?
- That's right.

346
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:01,030
No. All right.

347
00:27:01,196 --> 00:27:02,197
How do we do that?

348
00:27:02,406 --> 00:27:03,874
Where do we start?

349
00:27:09,413 --> 00:27:11,381
- Don't like that map?
- Oh, no.

350
00:27:11,582 --> 00:27:14,631
It's really good. It's just,
I've seen it before...

351
00:27:14,752 --> 00:27:16,004
in gift shops.

352
00:27:17,963 --> 00:27:19,135
And what about this one?

353
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:21,766
- Acupuncture, great.
- Yeah?

354
00:27:23,844 --> 00:27:24,891
What about that one?

355
00:27:25,095 --> 00:27:27,769
Showing me an MRI scan.
I do not believe this.

356
00:27:28,098 --> 00:27:30,442
Each of those maps
was drawn up by someone...

357
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:33,229
who could see in part, but not the whole.

358
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:35,790
I spent my last dollar getting here,
one-way ticket...

359
00:27:35,814 --> 00:27:39,034
and you're talking to me
about healing through belief?

360
00:27:39,276 --> 00:27:41,620
You're a man looking at the world
through a keyhole.

361
00:27:41,904 --> 00:27:43,389
You've spent your whole life

362
00:27:43,489 --> 00:27:44,632
trying to widen that keyhole...

363
00:27:44,656 --> 00:27:46,283
to see more, to know more.

364
00:27:46,742 --> 00:27:49,461
Now, on hearing that it can be widened...

365
00:27:49,745 --> 00:27:51,463
in ways you can't imagine...

366
00:27:51,622 --> 00:27:53,124
you reject the possibility.

367
00:27:53,624 --> 00:27:55,769
No, I reject it because
I do not believe in fairy tales...

368
00:27:55,793 --> 00:27:57,466
about chakras or energy...

369
00:27:57,711 --> 00:27:59,213
or the power of belief.

370
00:27:59,463 --> 00:28:01,386
There is no such thing as spirit!

371
00:28:02,132 --> 00:28:05,011
We are made of matter
and nothing more.

372
00:28:05,302 --> 00:28:08,351
You're just another tiny,
momentary speck

373
00:28:08,472 --> 00:28:09,769
within an indifferent universe.

374
00:28:09,973 --> 00:28:11,475
You think too little of yourself.

375
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:13,669
Oh, you think
you see through me, do you?

376
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:14,861
Well, you don't.

377
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,819
But I see through you!

378
00:28:35,499 --> 00:28:36,921
What did you just do to me?

379
00:28:37,126 --> 00:28:39,174
I pushed your astral form
out of your physical form.

380
00:28:39,378 --> 00:28:40,863
What's in that tea?

381
00:28:40,963 --> 00:28:42,681
Psilocybin? LSD?

382
00:28:42,965 --> 00:28:44,450
It's just tea...

383
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,597
with a little honey.

384
00:28:46,218 --> 00:28:47,390
What just happened?

385
00:28:47,553 --> 00:28:49,872
For a moment, you entered
the astral dimension.

386
00:28:49,972 --> 00:28:50,973
The what?

387
00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:54,105
A place where the soul exists
apart from the body.

388
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:56,107
Why are you doing this to me?

389
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,693
To show you
just how much you don't know.

390
00:28:59,731 --> 00:29:00,823
Open your eye.

391
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:08,157
Oh, shit!

392
00:29:08,323 --> 00:29:10,701
Oh, God! Oh, God, no!

393
00:29:10,868 --> 00:29:12,245
No, no, no!

394
00:29:12,411 --> 00:29:13,412
What's happening?

395
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:15,673
This isn't real!

396
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,227
His heart rate
is getting dangerously high.

397
00:29:34,516 --> 00:29:35,563
He looks all right to me.

398
00:29:38,103 --> 00:29:40,902
You think
you know how the world works?

399
00:29:41,064 --> 00:29:44,284
You think that this material universe
is all there is?

400
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:51,082
What is real?

401
00:29:52,701 --> 00:29:55,796
What mysteries lie beyond
the reach of your senses?

402
00:29:58,582 --> 00:30:00,300
At the root of existence...

403
00:30:00,459 --> 00:30:03,554
mind and matter meet.

404
00:30:03,962 --> 00:30:06,590
Thoughts shape reality.

405
00:30:19,728 --> 00:30:23,198
This universe is only one
of an infinite number.

406
00:30:25,943 --> 00:30:27,945
Worlds without end.

407
00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:31,157
Some benevolent and life giving.

408
00:30:34,117 --> 00:30:37,792
Others filled with malice and hunger.

409
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,667
Dark places...

410
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:46,634
where powers older than time
lie ravenous...

411
00:30:48,382 --> 00:30:49,554
and waiting.

412
00:30:57,349 --> 00:31:03,402
Who are you
in this vast Multiverse, Mr. Strange?

413
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:26,587
Have you seen
that before in a gift shop?

414
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,807
Teach me.

415
00:31:37,514 --> 00:31:38,561
No.

416
00:31:44,354 --> 00:31:45,380
No.

417
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,481
No!

418
00:31:46,648 --> 00:31:48,696
No, no, no!

419
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:51,929
No!

420
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:54,327
Open the door! Please!

421
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,878
Thank you, Masters.

422
00:32:03,749 --> 00:32:06,343
You think I was wrong to cast him out?

423
00:32:06,501 --> 00:32:08,799
5 hours later,
he's still on your doorstep.

424
00:32:10,005 --> 00:32:11,598
There's a strength to him.

425
00:32:11,757 --> 00:32:14,368
Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition.

426
00:32:14,468 --> 00:32:16,141
I've seen it all before.

427
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:19,331
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

428
00:32:19,431 --> 00:32:22,251
I cannot lead another
gifted student to power...

429
00:32:22,351 --> 00:32:24,604
only to lose him to the darkness.

430
00:32:26,563 --> 00:32:28,065
You didn't lose me.

431
00:32:28,857 --> 00:32:30,717
I wanted the power
to defeat my enemies.

432
00:32:30,817 --> 00:32:34,447
You gave me the power
to defeat my demons.

433
00:32:34,613 --> 00:32:37,492
And to live within the natural law.

434
00:32:37,741 --> 00:32:40,769
We never lose our demons, Mordo.

435
00:32:40,869 --> 00:32:42,917
We only learn to live above them.

436
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:48,378
Kaecilius still has the stolen pages.

437
00:32:48,585 --> 00:32:50,821
If he deciphers them,
he could bring ruin...

438
00:32:50,921 --> 00:32:52,343
upon us all.

439
00:32:53,465 --> 00:32:55,183
There may be dark days ahead.

440
00:32:55,926 --> 00:32:59,055
Perhaps Kamar-Taj
could use a man like Strange.

441
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,982
Don't shut me out.

442
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,864
I haven't got anywhere else to go.

443
00:33:20,784 --> 00:33:21,785
Thank you.

444
00:33:27,124 --> 00:33:28,171
Bathe.

445
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:30,509
Rest.

446
00:33:31,461 --> 00:33:32,838
Meditate...

447
00:33:33,004 --> 00:33:34,847
if you can.

448
00:33:35,006 --> 00:33:37,054
The Ancient One will send for you.

449
00:33:44,474 --> 00:33:46,147
What's this? My mantra?

450
00:33:48,812 --> 00:33:50,485
The Wi-Fi password.

451
00:33:51,648 --> 00:33:53,696
We're not savages.

452
00:34:25,015 --> 00:34:27,188
The language
of the mystic arts...

453
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,853
is as old as civilization.

454
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:32,398
The sorcerers of antiquity...

455
00:34:32,522 --> 00:34:35,366
called the use of this language "spells."

456
00:34:35,525 --> 00:34:37,587
But if that word offends
your modern sensibilities...

457
00:34:37,611 --> 00:34:40,114
you can call it a "program."

458
00:34:40,572 --> 00:34:43,291
The source code that shapes reality.

459
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,247
We harness energy...

460
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:50,879
drawn from other dimensions
of the Multiverse...

461
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:53,961
to cast spells...

462
00:34:55,587 --> 00:34:58,181
to conjure shields...

463
00:34:58,381 --> 00:35:00,224
and weapons...

464
00:35:01,218 --> 00:35:02,390
to make magic.

465
00:35:15,774 --> 00:35:20,280
But even if my fingers could do that...

466
00:35:21,238 --> 00:35:24,037
my hands would just be
waving in the air.

467
00:35:24,241 --> 00:35:26,289
How do I get from here to there?

468
00:35:26,576 --> 00:35:29,896
How did you get
to reattach severed nerves...

469
00:35:29,996 --> 00:35:32,590
and put a human spine
back together bone by bone?

470
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:35,177
Study and practice, years of it.

471
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,761
Hey.

472
00:35:48,473 --> 00:35:49,816
Mr. Strange.

473
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,852
Stephen, please.

474
00:35:52,102 --> 00:35:54,104
- And you are?
- Wong.

475
00:35:54,354 --> 00:35:55,446
Wong.

476
00:35:56,106 --> 00:35:57,358
Just Wong?

477
00:35:57,524 --> 00:35:59,197
Like Adele?

478
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,779
Or Aristotle.

479
00:36:04,447 --> 00:36:05,539
Drake.

480
00:36:05,949 --> 00:36:06,996
Bono.

481
00:36:09,452 --> 00:36:10,453
Eminem.

482
00:36:14,457 --> 00:36:16,710
The Book of the Invisible Sun.

483
00:36:17,127 --> 00:36:19,129
Astronomia Nova.

484
00:36:19,296 --> 00:36:20,843
Codex Imperium.

485
00:36:21,131 --> 00:36:22,849
Key of Solomon.

486
00:36:25,135 --> 00:36:26,432
You finished all of these?

487
00:36:26,761 --> 00:36:27,762
Yup.

488
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:29,518
Come with me.

489
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:30,731
All right.

490
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:33,685
This section
is for masters only...

491
00:36:33,852 --> 00:36:36,230
but at my discretion, others may use it.

492
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,824
You should start with Maxim's Primer.

493
00:36:42,986 --> 00:36:44,238
How's your Sanskrit?

494
00:36:45,322 --> 00:36:48,326
I'm fluent in Google Translate.

495
00:36:48,658 --> 00:36:51,207
Vedic, classical Sanskrit.

496
00:36:55,206 --> 00:36:56,207
What are those?

497
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,969
The Ancient One's
private collection.

498
00:37:00,128 --> 00:37:01,345
So, they're forbidden?

499
00:37:01,796 --> 00:37:04,015
No knowledge in Kamar-Taj
is forbidden.

500
00:37:04,174 --> 00:37:05,972
Only certain practices.

501
00:37:06,801 --> 00:37:08,787
Those books are far too advanced

502
00:37:08,887 --> 00:37:10,981
for anyone other than
the Sorcerer Supreme.

503
00:37:23,193 --> 00:37:25,036
This one's got pages missing.

504
00:37:25,362 --> 00:37:27,490
That's The Book of Cagliostro.

505
00:37:27,656 --> 00:37:29,329
A study of time.

506
00:37:29,658 --> 00:37:32,286
One of the rituals was stolen
by a former master.

507
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:36,089
The Zealot, Kaecilius.

508
00:37:37,499 --> 00:37:40,127
Just after he strung up
the former librarian...

509
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:42,716
and relieved him of his head.

510
00:37:45,382 --> 00:37:47,259
I am now the guardian of these books.

511
00:37:47,759 --> 00:37:51,059
So if a volume from this collection
should be stolen again...

512
00:37:51,388 --> 00:37:52,560
I'd know it...

513
00:37:53,014 --> 00:37:55,938
and you'd be dead before
you ever left the compound.

514
00:37:59,562 --> 00:38:01,735
What if it's just overdue?

515
00:38:02,065 --> 00:38:04,105
Any late fees I should know about?
Maiming, perhaps?

516
00:38:08,863 --> 00:38:10,740
People used to think that I was funny.

517
00:38:11,032 --> 00:38:12,124
Did they work for you?

518
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,418
All right. Well, it's been
lovely talking to you.

519
00:38:14,744 --> 00:38:16,313
Thank you for the books...

520
00:38:16,413 --> 00:38:18,607
and for the horrifying story...

521
00:38:18,707 --> 00:38:20,550
and for the threat upon my life.

522
00:38:51,781 --> 00:38:53,624
We will now receive the power

523
00:38:53,742 --> 00:38:55,619
to destroy the one who betrayed us.

524
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,298
The one who betrays the world.

525
00:39:59,682 --> 00:40:03,482
Mastery of the sling ring
is essential to the mystic arts.

526
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:06,148
They allow us to travel
throughout the Multiverse.

527
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,692
All you need to do is focus.

528
00:40:09,526 --> 00:40:10,743
Visualize.

529
00:40:11,236 --> 00:40:14,160
See the destination in your mind.

530
00:40:14,781 --> 00:40:17,330
Look beyond the world in front of you.

531
00:40:18,368 --> 00:40:20,336
Imagine every detail.

532
00:40:21,621 --> 00:40:25,592
The clearer the picture,
the quicker and easier...

533
00:40:26,209 --> 00:40:28,052
the gateway will come.

534
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:32,782
And stop.

535
00:40:32,882 --> 00:40:35,510
I would like a moment alone
with Mr. Strange.

536
00:40:36,219 --> 00:40:37,311
Of course.

537
00:40:41,474 --> 00:40:42,709
My hands.

538
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:43,981
It's not about your hands.

539
00:40:44,227 --> 00:40:46,195
How is this not about my hands?

540
00:40:46,855 --> 00:40:47,856
Master Hamir.

541
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:03,668
Thank you, Master Hamir.

542
00:41:05,081 --> 00:41:07,800
You cannot beat a river into submission.

543
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:09,840
You have to surrender to its current...

544
00:41:10,003 --> 00:41:12,256
and use its power as your own.

545
00:41:12,422 --> 00:41:14,574
I control it by surrendering control?

546
00:41:14,674 --> 00:41:16,096
That doesn't make any sense.

547
00:41:16,342 --> 00:41:18,640
Not everything does.
Not everything has to.

548
00:41:19,387 --> 00:41:21,890
Your intellect has
taken you far in life...

549
00:41:22,056 --> 00:41:23,524
but it will take you no further.

550
00:41:24,017 --> 00:41:26,019
Surrender, Stephen.

551
00:41:26,477 --> 00:41:28,229
Silence your ego...

552
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:30,398
and your power will rise.

553
00:41:31,107 --> 00:41:32,450
Come with me.

554
00:41:37,572 --> 00:41:38,640
Wait.

555
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,708
- Is this...
- Everest.

556
00:41:42,243 --> 00:41:43,311
Beautiful.

557
00:41:43,411 --> 00:41:45,960
Yeah, right, beautiful.

558
00:41:46,122 --> 00:41:48,545
Freezing but beautiful.

559
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:49,984
At this temperature...

560
00:41:50,084 --> 00:41:52,195
a person can last for 30 minutes...

561
00:41:52,295 --> 00:41:54,889
before suffering permanent
loss of function.

562
00:41:55,131 --> 00:41:56,131
Great.

563
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:58,685
But you'll likely go into shock
within the first two.

564
00:41:59,969 --> 00:42:02,097
- What?
- Surrender, Stephen.

565
00:42:02,263 --> 00:42:03,310
No!

566
00:42:13,149 --> 00:42:14,309
How's our new recruit?

567
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:16,448
We shall see.

568
00:42:17,237 --> 00:42:18,955
Any second now.

569
00:42:21,115 --> 00:42:22,332
Oh, no, not again.

570
00:42:27,664 --> 00:42:28,665
Maybe I should...

571
00:43:42,864 --> 00:43:43,911
Stephen.

572
00:43:44,157 --> 00:43:45,157
Wong.

573
00:43:45,241 --> 00:43:46,260
What do you want, Strange?

574
00:43:46,284 --> 00:43:47,706
Books on astral projection.

575
00:43:48,745 --> 00:43:49,792
You're not ready for that.

576
00:43:50,413 --> 00:43:52,211
Try me, Beyoncé.

577
00:43:55,001 --> 00:43:56,653
Oh, come on. You've heard of her.

578
00:43:56,753 --> 00:43:58,130
She's a huge star, right?

579
00:44:00,882 --> 00:44:02,099
Do you ever laugh?

580
00:44:03,343 --> 00:44:04,970
Oh, come on, just give me the book.

581
00:44:06,012 --> 00:44:07,104
No.

582
00:44:34,457 --> 00:44:36,192
Once, in this room,

583
00:44:36,292 --> 00:44:38,636
you begged me to let you learn.

584
00:44:39,087 --> 00:44:41,614
Now, I'm told
you question every lesson...

585
00:44:41,714 --> 00:44:43,307
preferring to teach yourself.

586
00:44:43,591 --> 00:44:45,361
Once, in this room,
you told me to open my eye.

587
00:44:45,385 --> 00:44:47,308
Now, I'm being told
to blindly accept rules...

588
00:44:47,512 --> 00:44:48,809
that make no sense.

589
00:44:49,138 --> 00:44:51,937
Like the rule against
conjuring a gateway in the library?

590
00:44:52,183 --> 00:44:53,560
Wong told on me?

591
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:56,212
You're advancing quickly
with your sorcery skills.

592
00:44:56,312 --> 00:44:58,986
You need a safe space
to practice your spells.

593
00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:19,460
You are now inside
the Mirror Dimension...

594
00:45:19,794 --> 00:45:22,297
ever present but undetected.

595
00:45:22,505 --> 00:45:24,507
The real world isn't affected
by what happens here.

596
00:45:26,467 --> 00:45:29,641
We use the Mirror Dimension
to train, surveil...

597
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:32,749
and sometimes to contain threats.

598
00:45:32,849 --> 00:45:35,089
You don't wanna be stuck in here
without your sling ring.

599
00:45:35,184 --> 00:45:37,903
Hold on. Sorry.
What do you mean, "threats?"

600
00:45:47,822 --> 00:45:51,668
Learning of an infinite Multiverse
includes learning of infinite dangers.

601
00:45:52,493 --> 00:45:54,937
If I told you everything else
that you don't already know...

602
00:45:55,037 --> 00:45:56,584
you'd run from here in terror.

603
00:46:02,628 --> 00:46:05,051
So just how ancient is she?

604
00:46:07,383 --> 00:46:09,761
No one knows the age
of the Sorcerer Supreme.

605
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,724
Only that she's Celtic
and never talks about her past.

606
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:15,708
You follow her, even though
you don't know?

607
00:46:15,808 --> 00:46:16,855
I know she's steadfast...

608
00:46:17,059 --> 00:46:18,481
but unpredictable.

609
00:46:18,644 --> 00:46:19,941
Merciless, yet kind.

610
00:46:22,106 --> 00:46:23,574
She made me what I am.

611
00:46:25,234 --> 00:46:26,577
Trust your teacher...

612
00:46:27,403 --> 00:46:28,450
and don't lose your way.

613
00:46:28,738 --> 00:46:29,739
Like Kaecilius?

614
00:46:30,156 --> 00:46:31,157
That's right.

615
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:37,122
You knew him.

616
00:46:38,372 --> 00:46:39,452
When he first came to us...

617
00:46:40,166 --> 00:46:41,759
he'd lost everyone he ever loved.

618
00:46:42,084 --> 00:46:45,738
He was a grieving, broken man
searching for answers in the mystic arts.

619
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:49,742
A brilliant student,
but he was proud, headstrong.

620
00:46:49,842 --> 00:46:51,922
He questioned the Ancient One,
rejected her teaching.

621
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:01,337
He left Kamar-Taj.

622
00:47:01,437 --> 00:47:03,965
His disciples followed him like sheep.

623
00:47:04,065 --> 00:47:06,008
Seduced by false doctrine.

624
00:47:06,108 --> 00:47:08,511
And he stole the forbidden ritual, right?

625
00:47:08,611 --> 00:47:09,612
Yes.

626
00:47:09,779 --> 00:47:10,951
What did it do?

627
00:47:13,282 --> 00:47:14,625
No more questions.

628
00:47:16,118 --> 00:47:17,186
What's that?

629
00:47:17,286 --> 00:47:18,538
That's a question.

630
00:47:20,289 --> 00:47:22,132
This is a relic.

631
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:24,134
Some magic is too powerful to sustain...

632
00:47:24,293 --> 00:47:25,493
so we imbue objects with it...

633
00:47:26,546 --> 00:47:28,765
allowing them
to take the strain we cannot.

634
00:47:28,965 --> 00:47:31,809
This is the staff...

635
00:47:32,009 --> 00:47:33,602
of the Living Tribunal.

636
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:38,516
There are many relics.

637
00:47:39,308 --> 00:47:40,480
The Wand of Watoomb.

638
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:43,108
The Vaulting Boots of Valtorr.

639
00:47:43,354 --> 00:47:45,106
Really just roll off
the tongue, don't they?

640
00:47:46,065 --> 00:47:47,865
- When do I get my relic?
- When you're ready.

641
00:47:48,276 --> 00:47:49,323
I think I'm ready.

642
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:52,163
You're ready when the relic
decides you're ready.

643
00:47:52,822 --> 00:47:54,074
For now...

644
00:47:55,074 --> 00:47:56,075
conjure a weapon.

645
00:47:57,827 --> 00:47:58,828
All right.

646
00:48:05,251 --> 00:48:06,343
Fight!

647
00:48:07,503 --> 00:48:08,971
Fight like your life depended on it.

648
00:48:15,177 --> 00:48:16,554
Because one day...

649
00:48:16,846 --> 00:48:18,063
it may.

650
00:49:28,417 --> 00:49:29,418
Wong?

651
00:49:42,098 --> 00:49:43,099
Okay.

652
00:49:43,766 --> 00:49:47,316
"First, open the Eye of Agamotto."

653
00:50:07,498 --> 00:50:08,715
All right.

654
00:50:32,022 --> 00:50:33,365
Oh, my.

655
00:50:47,913 --> 00:50:49,005
What if...

656
00:51:10,895 --> 00:51:12,272
"Dormammu."

657
00:51:14,023 --> 00:51:15,195
"The Dark Dimension."

658
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,618
Eternal life?

659
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:24,917
- What the...
- Stop!

660
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:31,377
Tampering with continuum probabilities
is forbidden.

661
00:51:31,624 --> 00:51:34,002
I was just doing
exactly what it said in the book.

662
00:51:34,293 --> 00:51:35,403
What did the book say

663
00:51:35,503 --> 00:51:37,063
about the dangers
of performing that ritual?

664
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,732
I don't know.
I hadn't gotten to that part yet.

665
00:51:38,756 --> 00:51:41,760
Temporal manipulations
can create branches in time.

666
00:51:41,926 --> 00:51:44,179
Unstable dimensional openings.

667
00:51:44,345 --> 00:51:46,564
Spatial paradoxes! Time loops!

668
00:51:46,722 --> 00:51:48,690
You wanna get stuck
reliving the same moment

669
00:51:48,974 --> 00:51:50,042
over and over forever...

670
00:51:50,142 --> 00:51:51,485
or never having existed at all?

671
00:51:52,895 --> 00:51:55,131
Really should put the warnings
before the spell.

672
00:51:55,231 --> 00:51:57,199
Your curiosity could have
gotten you killed.

673
00:51:57,483 --> 00:51:59,593
You weren't manipulating
the space-time continu

674
00:51:59,693 --> 00:52:00,694
you were breaking it.

675
00:52:02,112 --> 00:52:04,056
We do not tamper with natural law.

676
00:52:04,156 --> 00:52:05,157
We defend it.

677
00:52:05,407 --> 00:52:06,704
How did you even do that?

678
00:52:08,369 --> 00:52:11,248
Where did you learn the litany of spells
required to even understand it?

679
00:52:11,497 --> 00:52:12,557
I've got a photographic memory.

680
00:52:12,581 --> 00:52:14,621
That's how I got my M.D.
and Ph.D. at the same time.

681
00:52:14,667 --> 00:52:16,089
What you just did...

682
00:52:16,836 --> 00:52:18,509
takes more than a good memory.

683
00:52:18,796 --> 00:52:20,489
You were born for the mystic arts.

684
00:52:20,589 --> 00:52:22,762
And yet my hands still shake.

685
00:52:23,008 --> 00:52:24,134
For now, yes.

686
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,432
Not forever?

687
00:52:25,678 --> 00:52:26,725
We're not prophets.

688
00:52:26,929 --> 00:52:28,809
When are you gonna start
telling me what we are?

689
00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:35,671
While heroes like the Avengers

690
00:52:35,771 --> 00:52:38,048
protect the world
from physical dangers...

691
00:52:38,148 --> 00:52:41,618
we sorcerers safeguard it
against more mystical threats.

692
00:52:42,695 --> 00:52:45,164
The Ancient One
is the latest in a long line

693
00:52:45,281 --> 00:52:46,407
of Sorcerers Supreme...

694
00:52:46,949 --> 00:52:50,294
going back thousands of years
to the father of the mystic arts...

695
00:52:50,452 --> 00:52:51,578
the mighty Agamotto.

696
00:52:52,621 --> 00:52:56,717
Same sorcerer who created the eye
you so recklessly borrowed.

697
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:01,697
Agamotto built three Sanctums
in places of power...

698
00:53:01,797 --> 00:53:03,866
where great cities now stand.

699
00:53:03,966 --> 00:53:06,139
That door leads to
the Hong Kong Sanctum.

700
00:53:06,886 --> 00:53:08,763
That door to the New York Sanctum.

701
00:53:09,471 --> 00:53:10,711
That one to the London Sanctum.

702
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,857
Together...

703
00:53:13,142 --> 00:53:16,567
the Sanctums generate
a protective shield around our world.

704
00:53:16,979 --> 00:53:18,714
The Sanctums
protect the world...

705
00:53:18,814 --> 00:53:20,157
and we sorcerers...

706
00:53:20,816 --> 00:53:22,068
protect the Sanctums.

707
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:24,195
From what?

708
00:53:24,486 --> 00:53:26,989
Other dimensional beings
that threaten our universe.

709
00:53:27,698 --> 00:53:28,824
Like Dormammu.

710
00:53:30,409 --> 00:53:31,706
Where did you learn that name?

711
00:53:32,411 --> 00:53:35,585
I just read it in
The Book of Cagliostro. Why?

712
00:53:40,794 --> 00:53:43,343
Dormammu dwells
in the Dark Dimension.

713
00:53:44,506 --> 00:53:45,507
Beyond time.

714
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,327
He is the cosmic conqueror...

715
00:53:48,427 --> 00:53:50,350
the destroyer of worlds.

716
00:53:50,846 --> 00:53:54,166
A being of infinite power
and endless hunger...

717
00:53:54,266 --> 00:53:56,669
on a quest to invade every universe...

718
00:53:56,769 --> 00:53:59,488
and bring all worlds
into his Dark Dimension.

719
00:54:00,898 --> 00:54:03,367
And he hungers for Earth most of all.

720
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,703
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

721
00:54:07,196 --> 00:54:09,265
A ritual to contact Dormammu

722
00:54:09,365 --> 00:54:10,885
and draw power
from the Dark Dimension.

723
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:16,919
Okay...

724
00:54:17,706 --> 00:54:19,504
I'm out.

725
00:54:20,376 --> 00:54:22,879
I came here to heal my hands.

726
00:54:23,629 --> 00:54:26,929
Not to fight in some mystical war.

727
00:54:29,134 --> 00:54:30,226
London.

728
00:54:35,057 --> 00:54:36,058
Kaecilius!

729
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:37,351
No!

730
00:54:43,607 --> 00:54:45,450
Wong? Mordo?

731
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:37,457
Hello?

732
00:56:06,815 --> 00:56:07,816
Hello?

733
00:56:46,522 --> 00:56:50,152
Daniel, I see they made you
master of this Sanctum.

734
00:56:51,235 --> 00:56:53,363
You know what that means?

735
00:56:53,862 --> 00:56:55,535
That you'll die protecting it.

736
00:57:11,547 --> 00:57:12,764
Stop!

737
00:57:24,101 --> 00:57:26,445
How long have you been
at Kamar-Taj, Mister...

738
00:57:26,728 --> 00:57:27,854
Doctor.

739
00:57:29,314 --> 00:57:30,315
Mister Doctor?

740
00:57:30,858 --> 00:57:32,405
It's Strange.

741
00:57:34,027 --> 00:57:36,405
Maybe. Who am I to judge?

742
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:03,518
You don't know how to use that, do you?

743
01:01:48,657 --> 01:01:50,125
What?

744
01:01:55,163 --> 01:01:56,506
Oh, stop it.

745
01:01:56,623 --> 01:01:57,624
I said stop it.

746
01:01:57,833 --> 01:01:59,273
You cannot stop this, Mister Doctor.

747
01:01:59,459 --> 01:02:01,803
I don't even know what "this" is.

748
01:02:01,962 --> 01:02:03,009
It's the end...

749
01:02:03,338 --> 01:02:05,011
and the beginning.

750
01:02:05,173 --> 01:02:07,926
The many becoming the few
becoming the One.

751
01:02:09,636 --> 01:02:11,155
If you're not gonna start making sense...

752
01:02:11,179 --> 01:02:12,990
I'm just gonna to have to
put this thing back on.

753
01:02:13,014 --> 01:02:14,061
Tell me, Mister Doctor...

754
01:02:14,724 --> 01:02:17,523
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange.

755
01:02:17,811 --> 01:02:19,358
- You are a doctor?
- Yeah.

756
01:02:19,521 --> 01:02:20,522
A scientist.

757
01:02:21,064 --> 01:02:22,691
You understand the laws of nature.

758
01:02:22,983 --> 01:02:26,136
All things age. All things die.

759
01:02:26,236 --> 01:02:27,763
In the end, our sun burns out.

760
01:02:27,863 --> 01:02:30,116
Our universe grows cold and perishes.

761
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:31,992
But the Dark Dimension...

762
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,833
it's a place beyond time.

763
01:02:35,078 --> 01:02:36,639
That's it. I'm putting this thing back on.

764
01:02:36,663 --> 01:02:38,223
This world doesn't have to die, doctor.

765
01:02:38,331 --> 01:02:40,931
This world can take its rightful place
alongside so many others...

766
01:02:41,084 --> 01:02:42,336
as part of the One.

767
01:02:43,044 --> 01:02:44,887
The great and beautiful One.

768
01:02:45,672 --> 01:02:47,390
We can all live forever.

769
01:02:47,716 --> 01:02:48,888
Really?

770
01:02:51,094 --> 01:02:54,143
What do you have to gain
out of this New Age dimensional utopia?

771
01:02:55,223 --> 01:02:56,303
The same as you.

772
01:02:56,475 --> 01:02:59,228
The same as everyone. Life. Eternal life.

773
01:02:59,811 --> 01:03:01,734
People think in terms of good and evil...

774
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,740
when really time
is the true enemy of us all.

775
01:03:03,815 --> 01:03:05,533
Time kills everything.

776
01:03:05,775 --> 01:03:07,368
What about the people you killed?

777
01:03:07,652 --> 01:03:08,720
Tiny.

778
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:11,289
Momentary specks within
an indifferent universe.

779
01:03:13,408 --> 01:03:15,285
Yes. You see.

780
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:18,121
You see what we're doing.

781
01:03:18,747 --> 01:03:20,482
The world is not what it ought to be.

782
01:03:20,582 --> 01:03:23,068
Humanity longs for the eternal...

783
01:03:23,168 --> 01:03:25,862
for a world beyond time,
because time is what enslaves us.

784
01:03:25,962 --> 01:03:28,198
Time is an insult.

785
01:03:28,298 --> 01:03:29,925
Death is an insult.

786
01:03:31,343 --> 01:03:32,595
Doctor...

787
01:03:33,595 --> 01:03:36,039
we don't seek to rule this world.

788
01:03:36,139 --> 01:03:37,374
We seek to save it...

789
01:03:37,474 --> 01:03:40,978
to hand it over to Dormammu,
who is the intent of all evolution...

790
01:03:41,978 --> 01:03:43,821
the why of all existence.

791
01:03:44,814 --> 01:03:47,738
The Sorcerer Supreme
defends existence.

792
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:51,533
What was it that brought you
to Kamar-Taj, doctor?

793
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:53,032
Was it enlightenment?

794
01:03:53,823 --> 01:03:55,040
Power?

795
01:03:56,868 --> 01:03:59,291
You came to be healed, as did we all.

796
01:04:01,122 --> 01:04:03,608
Kamar-Taj is a place
that collects broken things.

797
01:04:03,708 --> 01:04:05,694
We all come with the promise
of being healed...

798
01:04:05,794 --> 01:04:08,638
and instead The Ancient One
gives us parlor tricks.

799
01:04:09,881 --> 01:04:12,451
The real magic she keeps for herself.

800
01:04:12,551 --> 01:04:15,896
You ever wonder
how she managed to live this long?

801
01:04:21,142 --> 01:04:23,486
I saw the rituals
in The Book of Cagliostro.

802
01:04:23,812 --> 01:04:25,985
So, you know.

803
01:04:26,314 --> 01:04:27,883
The ritual gives me the power

804
01:04:27,983 --> 01:04:29,301
to overthrow The Ancient One...

805
01:04:29,401 --> 01:04:31,136
and tear her Sanctums down.

806
01:04:31,236 --> 01:04:33,889
To let the Dark Dimension in.

807
01:04:33,989 --> 01:04:35,991
Because what The Ancient One hoards,

808
01:04:36,283 --> 01:04:37,705
Dormammu gives freely.

809
01:04:38,535 --> 01:04:40,037
Life everlasting.

810
01:04:40,829 --> 01:04:43,148
He's not the destroyer of worlds, doctor.

811
01:04:43,248 --> 01:04:45,171
He's the savior of worlds.

812
01:04:46,209 --> 01:04:47,444
No. I mean, come on.

813
01:04:47,544 --> 01:04:49,387
Look at your face.

814
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:51,907
Dormammu made you a murderer.

815
01:04:52,007 --> 01:04:54,226
Just how good can his kingdom be?

816
01:04:56,177 --> 01:04:57,724
You think that's funny?

817
01:04:58,179 --> 01:04:59,852
No, not that.

818
01:05:00,015 --> 01:05:02,438
What's funny is that
you've lost your sling ring.

819
01:06:10,794 --> 01:06:11,861
Sir, can I help you?

820
01:06:11,961 --> 01:06:13,178
Doctor Palmer, where is she?

821
01:06:13,338 --> 01:06:14,898
- Sir. We need to get...
- Where is she?

822
01:06:14,923 --> 01:06:16,408
The nurse's station.

823
01:06:16,508 --> 01:06:17,600
Christine!

824
01:06:19,594 --> 01:06:20,745
Stephen?

825
01:06:20,845 --> 01:06:21,913
Oh, my God.

826
01:06:22,013 --> 01:06:24,583
Get me in an operating theater now.
Just you.

827
01:06:24,683 --> 01:06:25,809
Now! I haven't any time.

828
01:06:26,434 --> 01:06:27,502
What happened?

829
01:06:27,602 --> 01:06:30,572
I was stabbed. Cardiac tamponade.

830
01:06:31,606 --> 01:06:33,108
What are you wearing?

831
01:06:39,781 --> 01:06:40,781
Chest cavity is clear.

832
01:06:40,824 --> 01:06:43,577
No, the blood is in the pericardial sac.

833
01:06:46,538 --> 01:06:47,689
No, no, no.

834
01:06:47,789 --> 01:06:48,790
Stephen?

835
01:06:50,375 --> 01:06:51,592
Come on, come on.

836
01:07:17,318 --> 01:07:19,537
Just a little higher.

837
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:22,140
Please be careful with the needle.

838
01:07:24,075 --> 01:07:25,076
Stephen?

839
01:07:27,829 --> 01:07:28,830
What am I seeing?

840
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,878
My astral body.

841
01:07:32,167 --> 01:07:33,168
Are you dead?

842
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:35,053
No, Christine. But I am dying.

843
01:07:37,255 --> 01:07:39,132
Right.

844
01:07:40,592 --> 01:07:41,593
Yeah. All right.

845
01:07:42,343 --> 01:07:43,344
Okay.

846
01:07:46,765 --> 01:07:48,608
Oh, wow.

847
01:07:53,104 --> 01:07:55,072
I've never seen a wound like this.

848
01:07:55,607 --> 01:07:57,029
What were you stabbed with?

849
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,784
I don't know.

850
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:20,303
I'm gonna have to vanish now.

851
01:08:20,548 --> 01:08:21,741
What?

852
01:08:21,841 --> 01:08:23,388
Keep me alive, will you?

853
01:08:26,471 --> 01:08:28,519
Okay.

854
01:08:52,956 --> 01:08:54,048
Oh, shit.

855
01:09:31,327 --> 01:09:32,874
Come on, come on.

856
01:09:37,876 --> 01:09:39,048
Stephen, come on.

857
01:09:41,754 --> 01:09:43,156
Hit me again.

858
01:09:43,256 --> 01:09:44,849
Stop doing that!

859
01:09:45,133 --> 01:09:46,785
Up the voltage and hit me again.

860
01:09:46,885 --> 01:09:47,932
No, your heart's beating!

861
01:09:48,094 --> 01:09:49,346
Just do it!

862
01:09:50,096 --> 01:09:51,848
Oh, my God.

863
01:10:20,919 --> 01:10:22,921
Oh, God! Oh, God!

864
01:10:23,087 --> 01:10:24,155
Are you okay?

865
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,323
Yeah.

866
01:10:25,423 --> 01:10:26,543
Okay.

867
01:10:32,972 --> 01:10:35,020
After all this time...

868
01:10:35,183 --> 01:10:36,981
you just show up here...

869
01:10:38,519 --> 01:10:40,613
flying out of your body.

870
01:10:40,772 --> 01:10:42,490
Yeah, I know.

871
01:10:42,649 --> 01:10:44,196
I missed you, too, by the way.

872
01:10:46,235 --> 01:10:48,847
I wrote you emails,
but you never responded.

873
01:10:48,947 --> 01:10:50,199
Why would I?

874
01:10:51,115 --> 01:10:53,413
Christine, I am so, so sorry.

875
01:10:54,494 --> 01:10:56,337
For all of it. You were right.

876
01:10:56,537 --> 01:11:00,108
I was a complete asshole.
I treated you so horribly.

877
01:11:00,208 --> 01:11:02,631
And you deserved so much more.

878
01:11:02,877 --> 01:11:04,254
Stop. You're clearly in shock.

879
01:11:06,172 --> 01:11:08,516
What the hell is happening?

880
01:11:08,675 --> 01:11:09,972
Where have you been?

881
01:11:10,927 --> 01:11:14,038
Well, after Western medicine failed me...

882
01:11:14,138 --> 01:11:17,108
I headed east,
and I ended up in Kathmandu.

883
01:11:17,392 --> 01:11:18,392
Kathmandu?

884
01:11:18,434 --> 01:11:19,731
Yeah.

885
01:11:20,603 --> 01:11:21,900
Like the Bob Seger song?

886
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:23,982
1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. Yeah.

887
01:11:24,232 --> 01:11:27,862
I went to a place called Kamar-Taj...

888
01:11:28,027 --> 01:11:31,702
and I talked to someone
called "The Ancient One."

889
01:11:32,407 --> 01:11:33,808
So you joined a cult.

890
01:11:33,908 --> 01:11:36,502
No, I didn't. No, not exactly. No.

891
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:39,422
They did teach me to tap into powers
that I never even knew existed.

892
01:11:39,539 --> 01:11:40,836
Yeah. That sounds like a cult.

893
01:11:41,082 --> 01:11:42,254
It's not a cult.

894
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,978
Well, that's what a cultist would say.

895
01:11:44,002 --> 01:11:45,003
Oh, no.

896
01:11:45,586 --> 01:11:48,055
Wait. Stephen, wait.
What do you think you're doing?

897
01:11:48,297 --> 01:11:49,924
I'm late for a cult meeting.

898
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,787
This is insane.

899
01:11:54,887 --> 01:11:55,955
Yeah.

900
01:11:56,055 --> 01:11:58,057
Where are you going?

901
01:11:58,599 --> 01:12:00,021
Can you tell me the truth?

902
01:12:00,309 --> 01:12:02,670
Well, a powerful sorcerer

903
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:04,530
who gave himself over
to an ancient entity...

904
01:12:04,564 --> 01:12:07,175
can bend the very laws of physics,
tried very hard to kill me.

905
01:12:07,275 --> 01:12:09,128
But I left him chained up
in Greenwich Village...

906
01:12:09,152 --> 01:12:11,714
and the quickest way back there
is through a dimensional gateway...

907
01:12:11,738 --> 01:12:12,881
that I opened up in the mop closet.

908
01:12:12,905 --> 01:12:14,782
Okay. Don't tell me. Fine.

909
01:12:25,334 --> 01:12:26,927
Really do have to go.

910
01:12:28,004 --> 01:12:29,096
Yeah.

911
01:13:14,967 --> 01:13:15,968
Strange!

912
01:13:18,471 --> 01:13:19,723
You're okay.

913
01:13:19,972 --> 01:13:22,066
A relative term. But yeah, I'm okay.

914
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:24,602
The Cloak of Levitation.

915
01:13:25,645 --> 01:13:27,113
It came to you.

916
01:13:27,897 --> 01:13:29,319
No minor feat.

917
01:13:30,274 --> 01:13:31,696
It's a fickle thing.

918
01:13:31,901 --> 01:13:33,869
- He's escaped.
- Kaecilius?

919
01:13:34,153 --> 01:13:35,154
Yeah.

920
01:13:35,738 --> 01:13:37,957
He can fold space and matter at will.

921
01:13:38,199 --> 01:13:41,578
He folds matter
outside the Mirror Dimension...

922
01:13:41,744 --> 01:13:42,836
in the real world?

923
01:13:43,037 --> 01:13:44,038
Yeah.

924
01:13:44,205 --> 01:13:46,003
- How many more?
- Two.

925
01:13:46,874 --> 01:13:49,068
I stranded one in the desert.

926
01:13:49,168 --> 01:13:50,236
And the other?

927
01:13:50,336 --> 01:13:51,779
His body's in the hall.

928
01:13:51,879 --> 01:13:53,677
Master Drumm is in the foyer.

929
01:13:53,923 --> 01:13:55,533
He's been taken back to Kamar-Taj.

930
01:13:55,633 --> 01:13:57,201
The London Sanctum has fallen.

931
01:13:57,301 --> 01:13:59,554
Only New York and Hong Kong
remain now...

932
01:13:59,804 --> 01:14:01,806
to shield us from the Dark Dimension.

933
01:14:02,598 --> 01:14:05,442
You defended the New York Sanctum
from attack.

934
01:14:05,685 --> 01:14:07,437
With its master gone, it needs another.

935
01:14:07,687 --> 01:14:09,109
Master Strange.

936
01:14:11,983 --> 01:14:12,984
No.

937
01:14:14,193 --> 01:14:16,179
It is Doctor Strange.

938
01:14:16,279 --> 01:14:18,973
Not Master Strange. Not Mister Strange.

939
01:14:19,073 --> 01:14:20,245
Doctor Strange.

940
01:14:21,659 --> 01:14:25,104
When I became a doctor,
I swore an oath to do no harm.

941
01:14:25,204 --> 01:14:26,522
And I have just killed a man!

942
01:14:26,622 --> 01:14:28,441
I'm not doing that again.

943
01:14:28,541 --> 01:14:31,010
I became a doctor
to save lives, not take them.

944
01:14:31,252 --> 01:14:34,405
You became a doctor
to save one life above all others.

945
01:14:34,505 --> 01:14:35,506
Your own.

946
01:14:37,091 --> 01:14:38,764
Still seeing through me, are you?

947
01:14:38,968 --> 01:14:42,598
I see what I've always seen:
Your over-inflated ego.

948
01:14:43,139 --> 01:14:46,313
You want to go back to the delusion
that you can control anything...

949
01:14:46,475 --> 01:14:47,818
even death...

950
01:14:48,019 --> 01:14:49,612
which no one can control.

951
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:52,444
Not even the great
Doctor Stephen Strange.

952
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:54,784
Not even Dormammu?

953
01:14:56,444 --> 01:14:58,287
He offers immortality.

954
01:14:58,446 --> 01:15:00,448
It's our fear of death
that gives Dormammu life.

955
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:01,808
He feeds off it.

956
01:15:01,908 --> 01:15:04,227
Like you feed off him?

957
01:15:04,327 --> 01:15:06,145
You talk to me about controlling death?

958
01:15:06,245 --> 01:15:07,313
Oh, I know how you do it.

959
01:15:07,413 --> 01:15:10,212
I've seen the missing rituals
from The Book of Cagliostro.

960
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:14,129
Measure your next words
very carefully, doctor.

961
01:15:14,378 --> 01:15:16,096
Because you might not like them?

962
01:15:16,422 --> 01:15:19,221
Because you may not know
of what you speak.

963
01:15:19,467 --> 01:15:20,969
What is he talking about?

964
01:15:21,135 --> 01:15:24,435
I'm talking about her long life,
the source of her immortality.

965
01:15:26,015 --> 01:15:27,858
She draws power
from the Dark Dimension

966
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,477
to stay alive.

967
01:15:31,437 --> 01:15:32,563
That's not true.

968
01:15:32,813 --> 01:15:34,941
I've seen the rituals. Worked them out.

969
01:15:35,858 --> 01:15:37,235
I know how you do it.

970
01:15:38,945 --> 01:15:40,367
Once they regroup...

971
01:15:40,613 --> 01:15:42,115
the Zealots will be back.

972
01:15:42,823 --> 01:15:44,666
You'll need reinforcements.

973
01:15:52,083 --> 01:15:53,630
She's not who you think she is.

974
01:15:53,834 --> 01:15:55,677
You don't have the right to say that.

975
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,489
You've no idea the responsibility
that rests upon her shoulders.

976
01:15:58,589 --> 01:16:00,512
No, and I don't want to know.

977
01:16:00,925 --> 01:16:01,972
You're a coward.

978
01:16:02,343 --> 01:16:03,390
Because I'm not a killer?

979
01:16:03,636 --> 01:16:05,156
These Zealots will snuff us all out...

980
01:16:05,221 --> 01:16:07,815
and you can't muster the strength
to snuff them first?

981
01:16:08,015 --> 01:16:09,417
What do you think I just did?

982
01:16:09,517 --> 01:16:10,734
You saved your own life!

983
01:16:12,103 --> 01:16:14,652
And then whined about it
like a wounded dog.

984
01:16:14,855 --> 01:16:16,333
Oh, you would have done it so easily?

985
01:16:16,357 --> 01:16:19,031
You've no idea the things I've done.

986
01:16:21,195 --> 01:16:23,055
And the answer is yes.

987
01:16:23,155 --> 01:16:24,873
Without hesitation.

988
01:16:25,116 --> 01:16:26,236
Even if there's another way?

989
01:16:26,409 --> 01:16:28,207
There is no other way.

990
01:16:28,369 --> 01:16:29,645
You lack imagination.

991
01:16:29,745 --> 01:16:30,837
No, Stephen.

992
01:16:31,122 --> 01:16:34,547
You lack a spine.

993
01:16:39,672 --> 01:16:40,889
They're back.

994
01:16:47,638 --> 01:16:48,981
We have to end this.

995
01:16:49,181 --> 01:16:50,273
Now!

996
01:16:55,563 --> 01:16:56,610
Strange!

997
01:16:56,856 --> 01:16:58,449
Get down here and fight!

998
01:16:58,774 --> 01:16:59,866
No!

999
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,577
The Mirror Dimension.

1000
01:17:06,198 --> 01:17:08,576
You can't affect the real world in here.

1001
01:17:09,076 --> 01:17:10,373
Who's laughing now?

1002
01:17:10,578 --> 01:17:11,704
Asshole.

1003
01:17:13,581 --> 01:17:14,628
I am.

1004
01:17:28,929 --> 01:17:29,929
I've got his sling ring.

1005
01:17:29,972 --> 01:17:30,973
They can't escape, right?

1006
01:17:32,391 --> 01:17:33,483
Run!

1007
01:17:50,701 --> 01:17:52,270
Their connection
to the Dark Dimension

1008
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:54,290
makes them more powerful
in the Mirror Dimension.

1009
01:17:54,372 --> 01:17:56,767
They can't affect the real world,
but they can still kill us.

1010
01:17:56,791 --> 01:17:59,635
This wasn't cleverness. It was suicide!

1011
01:18:16,227 --> 01:18:18,446
That is hilarious.

1012
01:19:04,859 --> 01:19:06,406
This was a mistake.

1013
01:20:38,869 --> 01:20:39,995
It's true.

1014
01:20:40,913 --> 01:20:44,292
She does draw power
from the Dark Dimension.

1015
01:20:47,795 --> 01:20:48,842
Kaecilius.

1016
01:20:51,757 --> 01:20:54,476
I came to you broken...

1017
01:20:54,802 --> 01:20:57,476
lost, in need.

1018
01:20:57,721 --> 01:21:00,474
Trusted you to be my teacher,
and you fed me lies.

1019
01:21:00,975 --> 01:21:02,443
I tried to protect you.

1020
01:21:02,685 --> 01:21:04,938
- From the truth?
- From yourself.

1021
01:21:05,187 --> 01:21:07,315
I have a new teacher now.

1022
01:21:07,648 --> 01:21:08,820
Dormammu deceives you.

1023
01:21:09,817 --> 01:21:12,115
You have no idea what he truly is.

1024
01:21:12,319 --> 01:21:16,165
His eternal life is not paradise,
but torment.

1025
01:21:16,323 --> 01:21:17,540
Liar.

1026
01:22:13,297 --> 01:22:14,389
Christine!

1027
01:22:15,382 --> 01:22:16,804
Are you kidding me?

1028
01:22:17,968 --> 01:22:18,969
Oh, my God.

1029
01:22:21,513 --> 01:22:23,707
It's not fibrillation.
She has a stunned myocardium.

1030
01:22:23,807 --> 01:22:25,007
- Neurogenic?
- Yes.

1031
01:22:30,022 --> 01:22:31,239
Someone get the swabs.

1032
01:22:33,734 --> 01:22:34,735
Nic?

1033
01:22:38,072 --> 01:22:39,832
We need to relieve
the pressure on her brain.

1034
01:22:42,409 --> 01:22:44,562
She's still dropping.

1035
01:22:44,662 --> 01:22:45,688
We're losing her!

1036
01:22:45,788 --> 01:22:47,040
We need to increase her oxygen!

1037
01:22:47,247 --> 01:22:48,247
I need a crash cart!

1038
01:22:48,290 --> 01:22:49,610
Her pupils have dilated!

1039
01:22:50,084 --> 01:22:51,084
No reflexes.

1040
01:22:51,168 --> 01:22:52,648
We're not reading any brain activity.

1041
01:23:04,264 --> 01:23:05,732
What are you doing?

1042
01:23:06,684 --> 01:23:08,436
Come on, you're dying!

1043
01:23:17,069 --> 01:23:19,618
You have to return to your body now.
You don't have time.

1044
01:23:19,738 --> 01:23:21,390
Time is relative.

1045
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:23,788
Your body hasn't even hit the floor yet.

1046
01:23:25,703 --> 01:23:27,479
I've spent so many years...

1047
01:23:27,579 --> 01:23:29,297
peering through time...

1048
01:23:29,456 --> 01:23:31,942
looking at this exact moment.

1049
01:23:32,042 --> 01:23:33,669
But I can't see past it.

1050
01:23:34,336 --> 01:23:37,865
I've prevented countless,
terrible futures.

1051
01:23:37,965 --> 01:23:40,534
And after each one,
there's always another.

1052
01:23:40,634 --> 01:23:42,995
And they all lead here...

1053
01:23:43,095 --> 01:23:44,096
but never further.

1054
01:23:44,346 --> 01:23:46,314
You think this is where you die.

1055
01:23:47,224 --> 01:23:49,585
You wonder what I see in your future?

1056
01:23:49,685 --> 01:23:50,811
No.

1057
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:54,173
Yes.

1058
01:23:54,273 --> 01:23:55,820
I never saw your future.

1059
01:23:56,108 --> 01:23:58,427
Only its possibilities.

1060
01:23:58,527 --> 01:24:01,246
You have such a capacity for goodness.

1061
01:24:01,447 --> 01:24:03,307
You always excelled...

1062
01:24:03,407 --> 01:24:05,893
but not because you craved success...

1063
01:24:05,993 --> 01:24:08,437
but because of your fear of failure.

1064
01:24:08,537 --> 01:24:10,289
That's what made me a great doctor.

1065
01:24:10,497 --> 01:24:13,091
It's precisely what kept you
from greatness.

1066
01:24:14,209 --> 01:24:16,236
Arrogance and fear still keep you...

1067
01:24:16,336 --> 01:24:17,696
from learning the simplest

1068
01:24:17,796 --> 01:24:19,823
and most significant lesson of all.

1069
01:24:19,923 --> 01:24:20,924
Which is?

1070
01:24:23,177 --> 01:24:25,396
It's not about you.

1071
01:24:29,183 --> 01:24:30,459
When you first came to me...

1072
01:24:30,559 --> 01:24:33,733
you asked me how I was able
to heal Jonathan Pangborn.

1073
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:36,027
I didn't.

1074
01:24:37,941 --> 01:24:42,196
He channels dimensional energy
directly into his own body.

1075
01:24:42,362 --> 01:24:44,098
He uses magic to walk?

1076
01:24:44,198 --> 01:24:45,370
Constantly.

1077
01:24:45,949 --> 01:24:47,792
He had a choice...

1078
01:24:48,577 --> 01:24:50,545
to return to his own life...

1079
01:24:51,121 --> 01:24:53,399
or to serve something
greater than himself.

1080
01:24:53,499 --> 01:24:56,151
So I could have my hands back again?

1081
01:24:56,251 --> 01:24:57,673
My old life?

1082
01:24:58,337 --> 01:24:59,589
You could.

1083
01:25:00,672 --> 01:25:03,471
And the world would be
all the lesser for it.

1084
01:25:05,052 --> 01:25:08,330
I've hated drawing power
from the Dark Dimension.

1085
01:25:08,430 --> 01:25:09,581
But as you well know...

1086
01:25:09,681 --> 01:25:12,042
sometimes one must break the rules...

1087
01:25:12,142 --> 01:25:13,940
in order to serve the greater good.

1088
01:25:14,186 --> 01:25:16,088
Mordo won't see it that way.

1089
01:25:16,188 --> 01:25:18,799
Mordo's soul is rigid and unmovable...

1090
01:25:18,899 --> 01:25:21,118
forged by the fires of his youth.

1091
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,095
He needs your flexibility...

1092
01:25:23,195 --> 01:25:25,243
just as you need his strength.

1093
01:25:26,365 --> 01:25:30,040
Only together do you stand a chance
of stopping Dormammu.

1094
01:25:30,285 --> 01:25:31,753
I'm not ready.

1095
01:25:33,831 --> 01:25:35,253
No one ever is.

1096
01:25:36,917 --> 01:25:39,090
We don't get to choose our time.

1097
01:25:43,215 --> 01:25:45,434
Death is what gives life meaning.

1098
01:25:46,552 --> 01:25:49,121
To know your days are numbered.

1099
01:25:49,221 --> 01:25:51,269
Your time is short.

1100
01:25:53,225 --> 01:25:55,523
You'd think after
all this time, I'd be ready.

1101
01:25:56,478 --> 01:25:58,172
But look at me.

1102
01:25:58,272 --> 01:26:01,276
Stretching one moment out
into a thousand...

1103
01:26:01,525 --> 01:26:03,869
just so that I can watch the snow.

1104
01:26:42,608 --> 01:26:44,030
Are you okay?

1105
01:26:51,825 --> 01:26:53,953
I don't understand what's happening.

1106
01:26:54,119 --> 01:26:55,211
I know.

1107
01:26:55,996 --> 01:26:58,875
But I have to go away now.

1108
01:27:03,795 --> 01:27:06,657
You said that losing my hands
didn't have to be the end.

1109
01:27:06,757 --> 01:27:08,430
That it could be a beginning.

1110
01:27:08,634 --> 01:27:09,681
Yeah.

1111
01:27:11,178 --> 01:27:13,897
Because there are other ways
to save lives.

1112
01:27:17,017 --> 01:27:18,519
A harder way.

1113
01:27:20,771 --> 01:27:23,006
A weirder way.

1114
01:27:23,106 --> 01:27:25,008
Doctor Palmer to the ER, please.

1115
01:27:25,108 --> 01:27:26,735
Doctor Palmer to the ER.

1116
01:27:31,031 --> 01:27:32,874
I don't want you to go.

1117
01:28:20,956 --> 01:28:22,128
Stop!

1118
01:28:52,029 --> 01:28:54,031
Choose your weapon wisely.

1119
01:28:57,367 --> 01:28:59,540
No one steps foot in this Sanctum.

1120
01:29:01,788 --> 01:29:02,835
No one.

1121
01:29:18,764 --> 01:29:19,981
Kaecilius.

1122
01:29:20,474 --> 01:29:22,647
You're on the wrong side
of history, Wong.

1123
01:29:35,322 --> 01:29:36,848
She's dead.

1124
01:29:36,948 --> 01:29:38,165
You were right.

1125
01:29:39,409 --> 01:29:41,411
She wasn't who I thought she was.

1126
01:29:42,579 --> 01:29:44,331
She was complicated.

1127
01:29:48,919 --> 01:29:50,341
Complicated?

1128
01:29:53,632 --> 01:29:55,976
The Dark Dimension is volatile.

1129
01:29:56,176 --> 01:29:57,348
Dangerous.

1130
01:29:58,136 --> 01:29:59,388
What if it overtook her?

1131
01:30:01,431 --> 01:30:03,650
She taught us it was forbidden...

1132
01:30:04,559 --> 01:30:08,422
while she drew on its power
to steal centuries of life.

1133
01:30:08,522 --> 01:30:10,340
She did what she thought was right.

1134
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:12,158
The bill comes due.

1135
01:30:13,068 --> 01:30:14,490
Don't you see?

1136
01:30:16,029 --> 01:30:19,433
Her transgressions
led the Zealots to Dormammu.

1137
01:30:19,533 --> 01:30:23,003
Kaecilius was her fault!

1138
01:30:23,787 --> 01:30:24,896
And here we are...

1139
01:30:24,996 --> 01:30:27,249
in the consequence of her deception.

1140
01:30:30,669 --> 01:30:31,966
A world on fire.

1141
01:30:32,212 --> 01:30:34,489
Mordo, the London Sanctum has fallen.

1142
01:30:34,589 --> 01:30:36,450
The New York one
has been attacked twice.

1143
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:38,143
You know where they're going next.

1144
01:30:38,593 --> 01:30:39,685
Hong Kong.

1145
01:30:39,886 --> 01:30:42,086
You told me once to fight
like my life depended on it...

1146
01:30:42,139 --> 01:30:43,179
because one day, it might.

1147
01:30:43,348 --> 01:30:44,895
Well, today is that day.

1148
01:30:45,684 --> 01:30:48,107
I cannot defeat them alone.

1149
01:31:05,495 --> 01:31:06,917
The Sanctum's already fallen.

1150
01:31:14,796 --> 01:31:16,719
The Dark Dimension.

1151
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:19,972
Dormammu is coming.

1152
01:31:22,554 --> 01:31:23,601
It's too late.

1153
01:31:24,097 --> 01:31:25,394
Nothing can stop him.

1154
01:31:27,726 --> 01:31:29,023
Not necessarily.

1155
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:34,441
No.

1156
01:32:15,815 --> 01:32:17,112
The spell's working.

1157
01:32:18,735 --> 01:32:20,863
We've got a second chance.

1158
01:33:59,502 --> 01:34:01,470
No!

1159
01:34:11,598 --> 01:34:13,100
Wong.

1160
01:34:21,483 --> 01:34:23,156
Breaking the laws of nature. I know.

1161
01:34:25,403 --> 01:34:26,825
Well, don't stop now.

1162
01:34:28,531 --> 01:34:29,849
When the Sanctum's restored,

1163
01:34:29,949 --> 01:34:31,101
they'll attack it again.

1164
01:34:31,201 --> 01:34:32,373
We've got to defend it.

1165
01:34:32,619 --> 01:34:33,871
Come on!

1166
01:35:02,148 --> 01:35:03,149
Get up, Strange.

1167
01:35:03,441 --> 01:35:04,658
Get up and fight.

1168
01:35:05,151 --> 01:35:06,528
We can finish this.

1169
01:35:07,862 --> 01:35:09,830
You can't fight the inevitable.

1170
01:35:13,118 --> 01:35:14,995
Isn't it beautiful?

1171
01:35:16,496 --> 01:35:18,919
A world beyond time.

1172
01:35:21,418 --> 01:35:22,840
Beyond death.

1173
01:35:27,006 --> 01:35:29,509
- Beyond time...
- Strange.

1174
01:36:02,459 --> 01:36:03,711
He's gone.

1175
01:36:05,086 --> 01:36:08,386
Even Strange has left you
and surrendered to his power.

1176
01:36:40,246 --> 01:36:43,591
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1177
01:36:43,833 --> 01:36:46,086
You've come to die.

1178
01:36:46,419 --> 01:36:50,515
Your world is now my world...

1179
01:36:50,798 --> 01:36:53,267
like all worlds.

1180
01:37:23,122 --> 01:37:26,547
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1181
01:37:26,876 --> 01:37:29,529
You've come to die.

1182
01:37:29,629 --> 01:37:32,633
Your world is now my...

1183
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,302
What is this?

1184
01:37:35,969 --> 01:37:37,312
Illusion?

1185
01:37:37,470 --> 01:37:38,813
No. This is real.

1186
01:37:39,055 --> 01:37:40,398
Good.

1187
01:37:50,650 --> 01:37:53,699
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1188
01:37:53,945 --> 01:37:57,199
You've... What is happening?

1189
01:37:57,782 --> 01:38:00,560
Just as you gave Kaecilius
powers from your dimension...

1190
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:03,163
I brought a little power from mine.

1191
01:38:03,538 --> 01:38:05,666
This is time.

1192
01:38:06,165 --> 01:38:09,294
Endless looped time.

1193
01:38:09,836 --> 01:38:11,759
You dare!

1194
01:38:15,508 --> 01:38:17,852
Dormammu, I've come to bargain.

1195
01:38:18,636 --> 01:38:21,139
You cannot do this forever.

1196
01:38:21,306 --> 01:38:22,853
Actually, I can.

1197
01:38:23,182 --> 01:38:25,460
This is how things are now.

1198
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:28,671
You and me, trapped in this moment...

1199
01:38:28,771 --> 01:38:29,863
endlessly.

1200
01:38:30,148 --> 01:38:33,698
Then you will spend eternity dying.

1201
01:38:34,027 --> 01:38:37,998
Yes. But everyone on Earth will live.

1202
01:38:38,156 --> 01:38:39,749
But you will suffer.

1203
01:38:39,949 --> 01:38:41,872
Pain's an old friend.

1204
01:38:44,245 --> 01:38:45,872
Dormammu...

1205
01:38:46,122 --> 01:38:47,214
I've come to bargain.

1206
01:38:47,373 --> 01:38:48,374
End this!

1207
01:38:48,875 --> 01:38:51,253
Dormammu... Dormammu...
Dormammu...

1208
01:39:07,477 --> 01:39:10,481
You will never win.

1209
01:39:11,773 --> 01:39:12,899
No...

1210
01:39:13,608 --> 01:39:15,076
but I can lose...

1211
01:39:16,027 --> 01:39:18,530
again and again...

1212
01:39:19,238 --> 01:39:20,285
and again...

1213
01:39:21,074 --> 01:39:23,076
and again, forever.

1214
01:39:24,577 --> 01:39:26,079
And that makes you my prisoner.

1215
01:39:26,245 --> 01:39:27,480
No!

1216
01:39:27,580 --> 01:39:28,820
Stop!

1217
01:39:29,374 --> 01:39:31,797
Make this stop!

1218
01:39:32,085 --> 01:39:34,087
Set me free!

1219
01:39:35,088 --> 01:39:36,089
No.

1220
01:39:36,714 --> 01:39:38,557
I've come to bargain.

1221
01:39:40,218 --> 01:39:42,596
What do you want?

1222
01:39:44,389 --> 01:39:46,437
Take your Zealots from the Earth.

1223
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:49,102
End your assault on my world.

1224
01:39:49,727 --> 01:39:51,149
Never come back.

1225
01:39:51,604 --> 01:39:52,730
Do it...

1226
01:39:53,314 --> 01:39:55,487
and I'll break the loop.

1227
01:40:05,076 --> 01:40:06,123
Get up, Strange!

1228
01:40:06,411 --> 01:40:07,537
Get up and fight.

1229
01:40:08,162 --> 01:40:09,755
We can finish this.

1230
01:40:10,289 --> 01:40:11,489
Isn't it beautiful?

1231
01:40:13,793 --> 01:40:16,137
A world beyond time.

1232
01:40:18,756 --> 01:40:20,303
Beyond death.

1233
01:40:32,145 --> 01:40:33,488
What have you done?

1234
01:40:33,646 --> 01:40:35,193
I made a bargain.

1235
01:40:38,151 --> 01:40:39,152
What is this?

1236
01:40:40,236 --> 01:40:43,080
Well, it's everything you've ever wanted.

1237
01:40:44,157 --> 01:40:46,330
Eternal life as part of the One.

1238
01:40:48,953 --> 01:40:50,705
You're not gonna like it.

1239
01:41:10,683 --> 01:41:11,994
Yeah, you know, you really should have

1240
01:41:12,018 --> 01:41:14,921
stolen the whole book
because the warnings...

1241
01:41:15,021 --> 01:41:17,274
The warnings come after the spells.

1242
01:41:26,949 --> 01:41:28,371
Oh, that's funny.

1243
01:41:55,978 --> 01:41:57,230
We did it.

1244
01:42:00,066 --> 01:42:01,238
Yes.

1245
01:42:02,026 --> 01:42:03,744
Yes, we did it.

1246
01:42:04,737 --> 01:42:06,159
By also violating...

1247
01:42:06,405 --> 01:42:07,907
the natural law.

1248
01:42:08,741 --> 01:42:11,415
Look around you. It's over.

1249
01:42:11,661 --> 01:42:14,380
You still think there will be
no consequences, Strange?

1250
01:42:15,832 --> 01:42:17,505
No price to pay?

1251
01:42:18,084 --> 01:42:21,088
We broke our rules, just like her.

1252
01:42:22,088 --> 01:42:25,558
The bill comes due.

1253
01:42:26,259 --> 01:42:27,351
Always!

1254
01:42:28,594 --> 01:42:29,766
A reckoning.

1255
01:42:32,849 --> 01:42:35,693
I will follow this path no longer.

1256
01:43:09,594 --> 01:43:11,062
Yeah, okay.

1257
01:43:20,438 --> 01:43:21,735
Wise choice.

1258
01:43:22,481 --> 01:43:24,550
You'll wear the Eye of Agamotto...

1259
01:43:24,650 --> 01:43:26,886
once you've mastered its powers.

1260
01:43:26,986 --> 01:43:28,158
Until then...

1261
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,891
best not to walk the streets
wearing an Infinity Stone.

1262
01:43:31,991 --> 01:43:33,038
A what?

1263
01:43:34,410 --> 01:43:36,479
You might have a gift for the mystic arts,

1264
01:43:36,579 --> 01:43:38,422
but you still have much to learn.

1265
01:43:39,790 --> 01:43:43,528
Word of the Ancient One's death
will spread through the Multiverse.

1266
01:43:43,628 --> 01:43:46,177
Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme
to defend it.

1267
01:43:46,672 --> 01:43:47,673
We must be ready.

1268
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:48,841
We'll be ready.

1269
01:46:35,341 --> 01:46:38,686
So Earth has wizards now, huh?

1270
01:46:40,679 --> 01:46:41,680
Tea?

1271
01:46:42,306 --> 01:46:43,666
I don't drink tea.

1272
01:46:43,766 --> 01:46:44,767
What do you drink?

1273
01:46:46,143 --> 01:46:47,486
Not tea.

1274
01:46:50,981 --> 01:46:52,528
So, I keep a watch list...

1275
01:46:52,775 --> 01:46:54,527
of individuals and beings
from other realms

1276
01:46:54,652 --> 01:46:56,052
that may be a threat to this world.

1277
01:46:56,195 --> 01:46:59,790
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

1278
01:47:02,201 --> 01:47:03,853
Worthy inclusion.

1279
01:47:03,953 --> 01:47:05,125
Yeah.

1280
01:47:06,330 --> 01:47:10,301
So why bring him here to New York?

1281
01:47:10,501 --> 01:47:11,944
It's a bit of a long story.

1282
01:47:12,044 --> 01:47:14,030
Family drama, that kind of thing.

1283
01:47:14,130 --> 01:47:15,882
But we're looking for my father.

1284
01:47:16,382 --> 01:47:19,577
Oh, okay. So if you found Odin...

1285
01:47:19,677 --> 01:47:22,726
you'd all return to Asgard promptly?

1286
01:47:22,888 --> 01:47:24,185
Oh, yes. Promptly.

1287
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:25,767
Great!

1288
01:47:27,059 --> 01:47:28,686
Allow me to help you.

1289
01:53:29,922 --> 01:53:31,048
Can I help you?

1290
01:53:32,299 --> 01:53:35,428
They carried you into Kamar-Taj
on a stretcher.

1291
01:53:36,720 --> 01:53:38,939
Look at you now, Pangborn.

1292
01:53:40,307 --> 01:53:41,308
Mordo.

1293
01:53:44,144 --> 01:53:45,963
So what can I do for you, man?

1294
01:53:46,063 --> 01:53:47,881
I've been away
for many months now,

1295
01:53:47,981 --> 01:53:49,733
and I've had a revelation.

1296
01:53:50,609 --> 01:53:53,158
The true purpose of a sorcerer...

1297
01:53:53,445 --> 01:53:56,073
is to twist things out of
their proper shape...

1298
01:53:56,990 --> 01:53:58,492
stealing power...

1299
01:53:59,326 --> 01:54:00,828
perverting nature.

1300
01:54:01,495 --> 01:54:02,838
Like you.

1301
01:54:03,789 --> 01:54:06,133
I've stolen nothing. This is my power.

1302
01:54:06,959 --> 01:54:09,007
- Mine.
- Power...

1303
01:54:10,170 --> 01:54:11,797
has a purpose.

1304
01:54:25,852 --> 01:54:27,980
Why are you doing this?

1305
01:54:28,188 --> 01:54:31,362
Because I see, at long last,
what's wrong with the world.

1306
01:54:36,655 --> 01:54:38,783
Too many sorcerers.
