1
00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:20,553
Stark!

2
00:00:20,586 --> 00:00:21,687
He doesn't seem happy.

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,855
Hello, Hank.

4
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:26,425
You're supposed to be in Moscow.

5
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:28,228
I took a detour...

6
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:32,365
Through your defense lab.

7
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:34,767
Tell me that isn't
what I think it is.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,871
That depends if you think it's
a poor attempt to replicate my work.

9
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:42,041
Even for this group,
that takes nerve.

10
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:43,843
You were
instructed to go to Russia.

11
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:45,711
May I remind you, Dr. Pym,
that you're a soldier...

12
00:00:45,744 --> 00:00:46,912
I'm a scientist.

13
00:00:46,945 --> 00:00:48,981
Then act like one.

14
00:00:49,014 --> 00:00:51,450
The Pym Particle is the most
revolutionary science ever developed.

15
00:00:51,483 --> 00:00:52,718
Help us put it to good use.

16
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:54,987
I let you turn me
into your errand boy,

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,390
and now you try to
steal my research?

18
00:00:57,423 --> 00:01:01,294
If only you'd protected Janet
with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

19
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:04,829
Ah...

20
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:07,800
Easy, Hank.

21
00:01:09,568 --> 00:01:12,071
You mention my wife again

22
00:01:12,104 --> 00:01:14,407
and I'll show you ferocity.

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,808
Don't look at me. You said it.

24
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:19,478
I formally
tender my resignation.

25
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:21,647
We don't accept it. Formally.

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,015
Hank,

27
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:24,817
we need you.

28
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,453
The Pym Particle is a miracle.
Please.

29
00:01:27,486 --> 00:01:29,622
Don't let your past
determine the future.

30
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:32,825
As long as I am alive,

31
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:35,962
nobody will ever
get that formula.

32
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:45,104
We shouldn't let him
leave the building.

33
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:47,340
You've already lied to him.
Now you want to go to war with him?

34
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,041
Yes.

35
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:51,844
Our scientists haven't come close
to replicating his work.

36
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:54,380
He just kicked
your ass, full-size.

37
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:57,293
You really want to find out what it's like
when you can't see him coming?

38
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,452
I've known Hank
Pym for a long time.

39
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:00,720
He's no security risk.

40
00:02:02,988 --> 00:02:04,657
Unless we make him one.

41
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:44,997
You like that?

42
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,399
You like that?

43
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:47,667
Come get you some now.

44
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:00,478
You didn't even move.

45
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:02,815
Nah.

46
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:04,517
What if I come in on the left side, right?
Just down here.

47
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,718
You see this right here?

48
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:15,928
I'm gonna miss you, Scott.

49
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:17,597
I'm gonna miss you,
too, Peachy.

50
00:03:19,097 --> 00:03:21,700
Man, you guys got
the weirdest goodbye rituals.

51
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:23,736
All right, break it up.

52
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:25,872
Break it up!
Break it up!

53
00:03:42,988 --> 00:03:44,490
Scotty!

54
00:03:44,523 --> 00:03:46,125
What's up, man!

55
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:47,693
Damn! Hey.

56
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:49,996
Ha-ha! Hey, man.

57
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:53,732
Hey, what's up with your eye?

58
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:56,569
Oh. Well,
what do you think? Peachy.
It's a going-away present.

59
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:58,504
Oh, yeah.
I still got my scar from a year ago.

60
00:03:58,537 --> 00:03:59,839
Oh, yeah.

61
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,140
Yeah.

62
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:03,776
You know what? I'm still the
only one who knocked him out.

63
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:06,645
Well, I definitely didn't.

64
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:08,481
Thanks for
picking me up, brother.

65
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,649
Bro, you think I'm gonna miss
my celly getting out?

66
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:11,817
Hey, how's your girl, man?

67
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:13,019
Oh, she left me.

68
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:14,720
Oh.

69
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:15,955
Yeah, my ma died, too.

70
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:18,090
And my dad got deported.

71
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:20,960
But I got the van!

72
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:22,094
It's nice.

73
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,195
Yeah, right?

74
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:25,831
Thanks for the hook-up, too.
I needed a place to stay.

75
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:28,000
You wait till you see this couch.
You're gonna be really happy.

76
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:29,535
You're gonna be on your feet
in no time. Watch.

77
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:31,103
- I hope so.
- Yeah.

78
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:32,505
And I gotta
introduce you to some

79
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:33,772
people.
Some really skilled people.

80
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:35,274
- Not interested.
- Yeah, right.

81
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:37,643
No, I'm serious, man.
I'm not going back.

82
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:41,647
I got a daughter
to take care of.

83
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,716
You know that jobs don't
come easy for ex-cons, right?

84
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:46,486
Look, man, I got a master's
in electrical engineering, all right?

85
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:48,787
I'm gonna be fine.

86
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:53,292
Welcome to Baskin-Robbins.

87
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:55,160
Would you like to try our
Mango Fruit Blast?

88
00:04:55,193 --> 00:04:56,729
Uh, no, thanks.

89
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:59,965
Um, I will have...
I'll have a burger, please.

90
00:04:59,998 --> 00:05:02,768
Oh, we don't...
We don't make that.

91
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:05,571
Pretzel.
Hot pretzel. Like, mustard...
Do you have mustard dip?

92
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:07,640
It's ice cream.
Baskin-Robbins.

93
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,843
I'll just do, like,
whatever's hot and fresh.

94
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,811
Dude.

95
00:05:12,844 --> 00:05:14,613
Can I see you in the back,
chief? Pronto.

96
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:17,182
Sure thing, Dale.

97
00:05:17,215 --> 00:05:19,886
Darby, could you just, uh,
take care of this idiot? Thanks.

98
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:24,240
Hey, Dale.

99
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,324
Come on in.

100
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:26,659
Pull up some chair.

101
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:31,564
Three years at San Quentin, huh?

102
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:32,831
You found out.

103
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:34,967
Baskin-Robbins
always finds out.

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,836
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
But I...

105
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:39,104
No one would hire me.

106
00:05:39,137 --> 00:05:41,807
Breaking and entering.
Grand larceny.

107
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,076
Look, I'm sorry.

108
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:45,611
I don't do it anymore.
I just...

109
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:46,644
Respect.

110
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:48,781
I couldn't be happier about it.

111
00:05:48,814 --> 00:05:50,282
- Really?
- Yeah.

112
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:52,318
Thank you. Thank you.

113
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:55,187
You really stuck it
to those billionaire SOBs.

114
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,756
The more I read about
what you did and stuff...

115
00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:00,125
I'm like,
"Wow, I know this guy?

116
00:06:00,158 --> 00:06:02,328
"I'm in charge of this guy?"

117
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,964
Well,
I'm very happy in this job,

118
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:07,132
and I really just appreciate
the opportunity to...

119
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:08,634
Well, you're fired, of course.

120
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:12,671
I can't really keep you on.

121
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:14,239
Wait, what? Fired?

122
00:06:14,272 --> 00:06:16,241
Yeah.

123
00:06:16,274 --> 00:06:17,943
Dale, look, it wasn't a violent crime.
I mean, I'm a good worker.

124
00:06:17,976 --> 00:06:20,646
No, it wasn't a violent crime.
It was a cool crime.

125
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:22,247
I'll tell you what, though.

126
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,284
This will be totally off the books,
off the records,

127
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:28,153
but if you want to grab
one of those Mango Fruit Blasts

128
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:29,755
on your way out the door,

129
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:32,024
I'll just pretend
I didn't see it.

130
00:07:10,762 --> 00:07:12,431
Hey, Scotty. What's up?

131
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:14,233
I thought you were
supposed to be at work.

132
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:16,135
I was. I got fired.

133
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:17,970
Damn.
They find out who you are?

134
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:19,338
Yeah.

135
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:21,106
Baskin-Robbins
always finds out, bro.

136
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:22,908
Baskin-Robbins don't play.

137
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:24,777
You want some waffles?

138
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,245
Yeah, I'll take a waffle.

139
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,047
Oh. That's Kurt.

140
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,400
He was Folsom for five years.
He's a wizard on that laptop.

141
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:32,251
Nice meet you.

142
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:33,404
Yeah. Nice to meet you, too.

143
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,319
Who are you?

144
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:36,756
Dave.

145
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,659
Nice work on the Vista job.

146
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:42,161
Vista job, yes.

147
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:44,897
No, no.
I have heard of this robbery.

148
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,167
Well, technically, I didn't rob them.
Robbery involves threat.

149
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,936
I hate violence.
I burgled them.
I'm a cat burglar.

150
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:52,271
You mean you're a pussy.

151
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:53,839
Yeah.

152
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:55,340
They were overcharging
the customers, right?

153
00:07:55,373 --> 00:07:57,076
And it added up to millions.

154
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,311
He blows
the whistle and he gets fired.

155
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:00,879
And what does he do?

156
00:08:00,912 --> 00:08:02,915
He hacks into
the security system

157
00:08:02,948 --> 00:08:05,851
and transfers millions
back to the people that they stole it from.

158
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:07,820
Posts all the bank records online.

159
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:10,013
And he drove the dude's Bentley
into his swimming pool.

160
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,159
What are you doing?

161
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:16,228
Hmm?

162
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:18,363
Why are you telling my
life story to these guys?

163
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:19,498
What do you want?

164
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:21,033
Okay.

165
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:23,302
My cousin talked to this guy
two weeks ago

166
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:24,503
about this little perfect job.

167
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:26,271
No way.

168
00:08:26,304 --> 00:08:28,107
No, no, no. Wait!
This guy... This guy fits your M.O.

169
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,475
No!

170
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,944
I'm finished, man.
I'm not going back to jail.

171
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:33,879
It's some retired millionaire
living off his golden parachute.

172
00:08:33,912 --> 00:08:35,914
It's a perfect Scott Lang mark!

173
00:08:35,947 --> 00:08:37,817
I don't care. I'm out.

174
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:57,936
Dr. Pym?

175
00:08:57,969 --> 00:09:00,406
Yes. I'm still alive.

176
00:09:07,445 --> 00:09:08,445
ID?

177
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:12,051
Perhaps that will suffice.

178
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:16,255
Very sorry, sir.
Please come in.

179
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,359
Is that Hank Pym?

180
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:25,931
Good morning, Hank.

181
00:09:27,165 --> 00:09:28,300
Hope.

182
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,570
Would it kill
you to call me Dad?

183
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:33,338
Dr.
Cross will be so pleased that

184
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:35,073
you could find
the time to join us today.

185
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:38,010
More like "thrilled."

186
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:41,914
I was surprised to receive
any kind of invitation from you, Darren.

187
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:43,182
What's the occasion?

188
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,117
Oh, you'll see.
Won't he, Hope?

189
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:51,323
We're ready for you inside.

190
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:53,324
Ouch.

191
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:58,297
I guess some old wounds
never heal, huh?

192
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,898
Don't worry,
she's in good hands.

193
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:03,536
You're in for a treat.

194
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:10,176
Long time, no see, Dr. Pym.
How's retirement?

195
00:10:11,042 --> 00:10:12,444
How's your face?

196
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:17,216
After you.

197
00:10:25,223 --> 00:10:28,293
Now, before we start,
I'd like to introduce a very special guest.

198
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:30,462
This company's
founder and my mentor,

199
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:32,164
Dr. Hank Pym.

200
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:50,015
When I took over this company
for Dr. Pym,

201
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:52,284
I immediately started
researching a particle

202
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:55,153
that could change
the distance between atoms,

203
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:58,490
while increasing
density and strength.

204
00:10:58,523 --> 00:11:01,426
Why this revolutionary idea
remained buried

205
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:03,662
beneath
the dust and cobwebs of

206
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:05,998
Hank's research,
I couldn't tell you.

207
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:08,000
But just imagine,

208
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:12,071
a soldier
the size of an insect.

209
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:17,076
The ultimate secret weapon.

210
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:31,123
An Ant-Man.

211
00:11:32,624 --> 00:11:34,393
That's what they called you.
Right, Hank?

212
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,232
Silly, I know.

213
00:11:40,265 --> 00:11:42,167
Propaganda.

214
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,903
Tales to astonish!

215
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:47,606
Trumped-up BS to
scare the USSR.

216
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,343
Hank, will you tell our guests
what you told me

217
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:54,647
every single time I asked you,

218
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:59,017
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

219
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,719
Just a tall tale.

220
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:02,587
Right.

221
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,957
Because how could anything
so miraculous possibly be real?

222
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:19,237
Well, I was inspired by the legend
of the Ant-Man.

223
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,140
And with my breakthrough
shrinking inorganic material,

224
00:12:22,173 --> 00:12:25,010
I thought, could it be possible
to shrink a person?

225
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:27,513
Could that be done?

226
00:12:28,646 --> 00:12:32,318
Well,
it's not a legend anymore.

227
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,188
Distinguished guests,

228
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:40,092
I am proud to present
the end of warfare as we know it.

229
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,760
The Yellowjacket!

230
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:49,368
Oh, no.

231
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:52,704
The Yellowjacket
is an all-purpose weapon of war

232
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:55,340
capable of altering
the size of the wearer

233
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:57,476
for the ultimate
combat advantage.

234
00:12:58,343 --> 00:13:00,379
We live in an era

235
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,314
in which the weapons
we use to protect ourselves

236
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:05,250
are undermined
by constant surveillance.

237
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:08,053
It's time to
return to a simpler age.

238
00:13:08,086 --> 00:13:10,789
One where the powers of freedom
can once again operate openly

239
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:13,025
to protect their interests.

240
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,293
An all-purpose
peace-keeping vessel,

241
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:17,496
the Yellowjacket
can manage any conflict

242
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:19,164
on the geopolitical landscape

243
00:13:19,197 --> 00:13:21,767
completely unseen.

244
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,771
Efficient in both preventative
measures and tactical assault.

245
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:28,640
Practical applications
include surveillance,

246
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:30,025
industrial sabotage,

247
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:35,380
and the elimination of obstructions
on the road to peace.

248
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:37,249
A single Yellowjacket

249
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:39,051
offers the user
unlimited influence

250
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,520
to carry out protective actions.

251
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:44,289
And, one day soon,
an army of Yellowjackets

252
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:46,758
will create
a sustainable environment

253
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,394
of well-being
around the world.

254
00:13:49,427 --> 00:13:51,330
The Yellowjacket.

255
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:53,765
So, it's a suit?

256
00:13:57,402 --> 00:13:59,171
Don't be crude, Frank.

257
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:02,707
It's not a suit,
it's a vessel.

258
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,342
What's the matter?
You're not impressed?

259
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,279
No, I'm impressed.
I'm also concerned.

260
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:10,348
Imagine what our enemies
could do with this tech.

261
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:12,818
We should have a longer
conversation about that, Frank.

262
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,586
I really value your opinion.

263
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,123
Thank you for coming. Hope?

264
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:20,592
Thank you very much, everybody.
I will escort you out now.

265
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:21,625
Thank you.

266
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:26,865
You seem a bit shocked.

267
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:31,169
Darren, there's a reason
that I buried these secrets.

268
00:14:31,202 --> 00:14:34,139
So you
finally admit it!

269
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:38,310
We could have done this together, Hank.
But you ruined that.

270
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:39,611
That's why you're the past
and I'm the future.

271
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:42,614
Don't do this.

272
00:14:42,647 --> 00:14:44,316
Dr. Cross?

273
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:48,587
You sell to me first,
20% over your asking price,

274
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,355
I can have the cash
here in two weeks.

275
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:51,857
Deal.

276
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:02,534
We have to
make our move, Hank.

277
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:03,802
How close is he?

278
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:06,605
He still can't
shrink a live subject.

279
00:15:06,638 --> 00:15:08,840
Just give me the suit and let me
finish this once and for all.

280
00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:10,575
No.

281
00:15:10,608 --> 00:15:12,244
I have Cross' complete trust.

282
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:13,378
It's too dangerous.

283
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:15,147
We don't have a choice.

284
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,882
Well,
that's not entirely true.

285
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,686
I think I found a guy.

286
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,889
Who?

287
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:29,594
Daddy!

288
00:15:29,627 --> 00:15:31,163
Peanut! Oh!

289
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,431
Happy birthday!

290
00:15:33,464 --> 00:15:34,766
I'm so sorry I'm late.

291
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,368
I didn't know
what time your party started.

292
00:15:36,401 --> 00:15:37,769
It was on the invitation.

293
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:39,604
He didn't get an invitation.

294
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:41,473
But he came anyway!

295
00:15:41,506 --> 00:15:44,442
Well, I'm not gonna miss
my little girl's birthday party.

296
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:46,278
I'm gonna go tell
Mommy you're here.

297
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:47,345
Oh, you don't...

298
00:15:47,378 --> 00:15:48,680
What are you doing here, Lang?

299
00:15:48,713 --> 00:15:50,515
You haven't paid
a dime of child support.

300
00:15:50,548 --> 00:15:51,716
You know, right now, if I wanted to,
I could arrest you.

301
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:53,451
It's good to see
you too, Paxton.

302
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:56,354
Mommy's so happy you're here,
she choked on her drink.

303
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,425
Hey, look what I have for you.

304
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,860
Can I open it now?

305
00:16:01,893 --> 00:16:03,629
Of course, sweetheart.
It's your birthday.

306
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,634
You're my bestest friend.

307
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:10,869
What is that thing?

308
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:12,604
He's so ugly!

309
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:15,407
I love him!

310
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,841
Can I go show my friends?

311
00:16:16,874 --> 00:16:19,611
Of course, sweetheart.
Go ahead.

312
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:21,284
You're my bestest friend.

313
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:23,515
Look, the child support
is coming, all right?

314
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:25,617
It's just hard finding a job
when you have a record.

315
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,420
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
But for now, I want you out of my house.

316
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:29,821
- No way! It's my daughter's birthday.
- It's my house!

317
00:16:29,854 --> 00:16:31,414
- So what? It's my kid!
- Scott!

318
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:34,826
You can't just show up here.
You know that. Come on.

319
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:36,328
It's a birthday party.

320
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:37,696
Yeah, I know,
but you can't just show up.

321
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:39,397
She's my daughter.

322
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,632
You don't know the first thing
about being a father.

323
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:42,601
Maggie,
I tell you this as a friend,

324
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,436
and as the first
love of my life.

325
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:46,471
Your fiance is an asshat.

326
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:47,806
He's not an asshat.

327
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,341
Hey, watch your language.
Okay?

328
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:50,575
What language? I said "hat."

329
00:16:50,608 --> 00:16:51,777
Stop it.

330
00:16:53,444 --> 00:16:55,547
Really, Maggie? That guy?

331
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,249
Come on! You could marry
anyone you want,

332
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,450
and you have to
get engaged to a cop?

333
00:16:58,483 --> 00:16:59,918
At least he's not a crook.

334
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,789
I'm trying, okay?
I've changed. I'm straight.

335
00:17:04,822 --> 00:17:06,959
I had a job and...

336
00:17:08,726 --> 00:17:10,495
I wanna provide.

337
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:12,430
I had a lot of time to think about it
and I love her.

338
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:14,366
So much.

339
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:16,901
I've missed so much time
and I wanna be a part of her life.

340
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:17,934
What do I do?

341
00:17:18,736 --> 00:17:20,538
Get an apartment,

342
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:23,041
get a job, pay child support.

343
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:26,778
And then we will talk about visitation,
I promise.

344
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:29,914
You're her hero, Scott.

345
00:17:29,947 --> 00:17:33,752
Just be the person
that she already thinks you are.

346
00:17:58,576 --> 00:18:01,256
I'm sorry you have such deep concerns
about the Yellowjacket, Frank.

347
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:03,415
Yeah. Well, uh...

348
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:07,686
Unfortunately,
we can't just do whatever we want.

349
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:10,021
It'd be nice though, right?

350
00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:12,589
But there are laws.

351
00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:14,826
What laws? Of man?

352
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:17,362
The laws of nature
transcend the laws of man.

353
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:19,331
And I've transcended
the laws of nature.

354
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:25,704
Darren, I don't
think you understand...

355
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:29,708
Hmm.

356
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:34,046
We still haven't
worked out all the bugs.

357
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:40,819
Goodbye, Frank.

358
00:18:54,565 --> 00:18:56,001
Thank you.

359
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:02,941
You know, I've been thinking a lot
about gratitude lately.

360
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:05,543
And today,
during my morning meditation,

361
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:06,911
an interesting
thought occurred to me,

362
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:08,380
and I think it
might apply to you, too.

363
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:09,748
How's that?

364
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,583
Gratitude can be forgiveness.

365
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:16,621
I've spent years carrying around
my anger for Hank Pym.

366
00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:19,491
I devoted my genius to him.

367
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:20,959
I could have worked anywhere.

368
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:23,495
I chose my mentor poorly.

369
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:25,931
You didn't even have a choice.

370
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:28,934
He never believed in you.

371
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:32,670
It's a shame
what we had to do,

372
00:19:32,703 --> 00:19:35,140
but he forced us
to do it, didn't he?

373
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:38,910
But we shouldn't be angry,
we should be grateful.

374
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:41,880
Because his
failures as a mentor,

375
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:44,783
as a father,

376
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,686
forced us to spread our wings.

377
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:53,458
You're a success, Darren.

378
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:55,627
You deserve everything
coming your way.

379
00:20:15,746 --> 00:20:16,915
Ooh.

380
00:20:16,948 --> 00:20:18,583
Stop cheating.

381
00:20:19,617 --> 00:20:20,919
Hey, what's up, hotshot?

382
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:24,222
Maybe he didn't hear you.

383
00:20:24,255 --> 00:20:25,255
How was the party?

384
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:33,198
Tell me about that tip.

385
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:34,833
What?

386
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,868
I wanna know about that tip.

387
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:39,771
Oh, baby, it's on!
It's so on, right now.

388
00:20:39,804 --> 00:20:41,840
Calm down, all right?
I just need to know where it came from.

389
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:42,974
It's gotta be airtight.

390
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,243
Okay.

391
00:20:45,276 --> 00:20:47,645
I was at a wine tasting
with my cousin Ernesto.

392
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:50,014
Which was mainly reds,
and you know I don't like reds, man.

393
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,250
But there was a rose that saved the day.
It was delightful.

394
00:20:52,283 --> 00:20:54,118
And then he tells
me about this girl,

395
00:20:54,151 --> 00:20:56,521
Emily,
that we used to kick it with.

396
00:20:56,554 --> 00:20:57,255
It was actually the first pair of boobs
I ever touched.

397
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:58,890
It's the wrong details.

398
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:00,525
It has nothing to
do with the story.

399
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:02,227
Go.

400
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,496
So,
uh, he tells me that she's

401
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,130
working as
a housekeeper now, right?

402
00:21:06,163 --> 00:21:08,066
And she's dating
this dude, Carlos,

403
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:10,268
who's a shot caller
from across the bay.

404
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:12,670
And she tells him about the dude
that she's cleaning for.

405
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:15,139
Right? That he's
like this big-shot CEO

406
00:21:15,172 --> 00:21:17,242
that is all retired now,
but he's loaded.

407
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:20,879
And so, Carlos and Ernesto
are on the same softball team,

408
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,014
and they get to talking,
right?

409
00:21:23,047 --> 00:21:26,117
And here comes the good part.
Carlos says, "Yo, man.

410
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,253
"This guy's got
a big-ass safe just

411
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:30,288
"sitting in the basement,
just chilling."

412
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:31,789
Of course Ernesto
comes to me because

413
00:21:31,822 --> 00:21:32,857
he knows I got
mad thieving skills.

414
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,692
Of course, I ask him...

415
00:21:34,725 --> 00:21:36,628
"Did Emily tell
Carlos to tell you

416
00:21:36,661 --> 00:21:37,695
"to get to me what
kind of safe it was?"

417
00:21:37,728 --> 00:21:39,597
And he says, "Nah, dawg.

418
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,566
"All she said is
that it's super-legit

419
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:43,279
"and whatever's in it,
it's gotta be good."

420
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:47,171
What?

421
00:21:47,204 --> 00:21:49,741
Old man have safe.

422
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,277
And he's gone for a week.

423
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,978
All right.
There's an old man,
he's got a safe,

424
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:55,113
and he's gone for a week.

425
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:56,281
Let's just work with that.

426
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:57,782
You know what I'm saying?

427
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:50,001
Landline's cut,
cell signal's jammed.

428
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:52,203
No one will be making
for distress call tonight.

429
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:53,271
Comm check.

430
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:55,206
- Check.
- Check.

431
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,741
Hey, if the job goes bad,
you know I got your back, right?

432
00:22:56,774 --> 00:22:58,076
Don't worry.

433
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:00,111
It's not gonna happen.

434
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,540
I love it when he gets cocky.

435
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,656
Damn!

436
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:40,718
Alarm is dead.

437
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:41,751
Nice.

438
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:46,291
All right,
I'm moving through the house.

439
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,785
There's a fingerprint
lock on the door.

440
00:24:13,818 --> 00:24:16,058
It's got what?
Ernesto didn't tell me nothing about that.

441
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,222
Aw, man, are we screwed?

442
00:24:18,255 --> 00:24:20,191
Not necessarily.

443
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:09,874
I'm in.

444
00:25:09,907 --> 00:25:12,310
No alarms have been triggered.
He's in like the Flynn.

445
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,216
Oh, man.

446
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:20,351
What is it?

447
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,221
Well, they weren't kidding.
This safe is serious.

448
00:25:23,254 --> 00:25:25,289
How serious
are we talking, Scotty?

449
00:25:25,322 --> 00:25:27,058
It's a Carbondale.

450
00:25:27,091 --> 00:25:28,760
It's from 1910.

451
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,395
Made from the same
steel as the Titanic.

452
00:25:31,428 --> 00:25:32,930
Wow.

453
00:25:32,963 --> 00:25:34,932
Can you crack it?

454
00:25:34,965 --> 00:25:37,902
Well, here's the thing.
It doesn't do so well in the cold.

455
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:39,070
Remember what that iceberg did?

456
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:40,872
Yeah, man. It killed DiCaprio.

457
00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:42,140
Killed everybody.

458
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:43,775
Did not kill the old lady.

459
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,777
She still throw
the jewel into the oceans.

460
00:26:38,262 --> 00:26:40,231
What are you doing?

461
00:26:40,264 --> 00:26:42,904
I poured water in the locking mechanism
and froze it with nitrogen.

462
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:45,603
Ice expands. Metal doesn't.

463
00:26:45,636 --> 00:26:47,972
- What are you doing now?
- Waiting.

464
00:26:49,206 --> 00:26:50,208
Waiting.

465
00:26:58,449 --> 00:26:59,450
Nice.

466
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:05,356
What is it?
Cash? Jewels?

467
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:08,493
- There's nothing here.
- What did you say?

468
00:27:10,194 --> 00:27:11,379
It's a suit.

469
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,563
What?

470
00:27:12,596 --> 00:27:14,499
It's an old motorcycle suit.

471
00:27:15,532 --> 00:27:17,468
There's no cash,
no jewelry, nothing?

472
00:27:17,501 --> 00:27:18,937
No.

473
00:27:20,004 --> 00:27:21,038
It's a bust.

474
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:23,407
I'm really sorry, Scotty.

475
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,210
I know you needed to score.

476
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,370
I thought we were using mice.

477
00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:03,314
What's the difference?

478
00:28:05,082 --> 00:28:10,021
Commence Experiment 34-C.
Organic atomic reduction.

479
00:28:10,054 --> 00:28:12,023
Darren, maybe we should think...

480
00:28:12,056 --> 00:28:14,258
Shrinking organic tissue
is the centerpiece of this technology.

481
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:16,251
I can't go to the buyers
with half a breakthrough.

482
00:28:40,617 --> 00:28:45,122
Experiment 34-C results,

483
00:28:45,155 --> 00:28:46,155
negative.

484
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:53,965
Sanitize the work station.
Bring in subject 35-C.

485
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:06,696
Why would you lock this up?

486
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:30,501
This is so weird.

487
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:04,068
Scotty, what's up, man?

488
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,509
I wonder...
What is this?

489
00:30:42,272 --> 00:30:44,075
The world
sure seems different

490
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,676
from down here,
doesn't it, Scott?

491
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:48,379
What? Who said that?

492
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,287
Luis, down here!

493
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,124
It's a trial by fire, Scott.
Or, in this case,

494
00:31:00,157 --> 00:31:01,157
water.

495
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:27,718
Guess you're tougher
than you thought.

496
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:31,954
Oh, I don't want to see this!

497
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:33,624
Luis!

498
00:31:38,762 --> 00:31:39,830
Son of a...

499
00:32:56,907 --> 00:32:58,276
What the hell?

500
00:32:59,676 --> 00:33:01,912
Not bad for a test drive.

501
00:33:01,945 --> 00:33:04,281
Keep the suit.
I'll be in touch.

502
00:33:04,314 --> 00:33:06,284
No! No! No, thank you!

503
00:33:19,663 --> 00:33:20,531
Get down on the ground!

504
00:33:20,564 --> 00:33:22,533
You are under arrest!

505
00:33:22,566 --> 00:33:24,868
No, I didn't steal anything!
I was returning something I stole.

506
00:33:24,901 --> 00:33:25,901
Oh...

507
00:33:28,438 --> 00:33:29,840
Don't move.

508
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:35,479
You know,
you almost had us convinced

509
00:33:35,512 --> 00:33:37,881
that you were
gonna change your ways.

510
00:33:37,914 --> 00:33:39,884
They were really
rooting for you.

511
00:33:41,685 --> 00:33:43,721
It's gonna break their hearts.

512
00:33:46,456 --> 00:33:47,725
You got a visitor.

513
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:49,260
Who?

514
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:50,294
Your lawyer.

515
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:52,430
My lawyer?

516
00:33:55,766 --> 00:33:58,936
I told you I'd
be in touch, Scott.

517
00:33:58,969 --> 00:34:02,473
I'm starting to think that
you prefer the inside of a jail cell.

518
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:04,308
Oh, man.

519
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:05,841
Sit down.

520
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:12,916
Sir,
I'm sorry I stole the suit.

521
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:14,652
I don't even wanna know
why you have it.

522
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,654
Maggie was right about you.

523
00:34:18,455 --> 00:34:19,923
How do you know about...

524
00:34:19,956 --> 00:34:21,996
No wonder she's trying
to keep you away from Cassie.

525
00:34:22,626 --> 00:34:24,595
The moment things get hard,

526
00:34:24,628 --> 00:34:25,863
you turn right back to crime.

527
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:30,801
The way I see it,
you have a choice.

528
00:34:30,834 --> 00:34:33,037
You can either spend
the rest of your life in prison,

529
00:34:34,104 --> 00:34:36,707
or go back to your cell

530
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,043
and await further instructions.

531
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:40,577
I don't understand.

532
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,980
No, I don't expect you to.

533
00:34:43,013 --> 00:34:45,916
But you don't have many options
right now, and quite frankly,

534
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:48,552
neither do I.

535
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:52,056
Why do you think I let you
steal that suit in the first place?

536
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:53,089
What?

537
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,804
Second chances
don't come around all that much.

538
00:35:06,837 --> 00:35:10,107
So, next time you think
you might see one,

539
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:14,412
I suggest you take
a real close look at it.

540
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,892
You're my bestest friend!

541
00:35:28,925 --> 00:35:30,761
Are you sure you
don't want a different toy?

542
00:35:30,794 --> 00:35:33,530
No, I love this one.

543
00:35:33,563 --> 00:35:35,866
Okay. Well,
get some sleep. I love you.

544
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,369
- Mommy?
- Hmm?

545
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:41,071
Is Daddy a bad man?

546
00:35:41,104 --> 00:35:43,941
I heard some
grownups say he's bad.

547
00:35:44,741 --> 00:35:47,077
No.

548
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,947
Daddy just gets
confused sometimes, you know?

549
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:44,168
Smart choice.
You actually listened, for once.

550
00:36:45,635 --> 00:36:46,470
Under the door.

551
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,210
Okay, where to now?

552
00:36:53,243 --> 00:36:55,012
- Hang tight.
- Oh, God.

553
00:36:58,048 --> 00:36:59,116
What, what?

554
00:36:59,149 --> 00:37:00,551
Where the hell did he go?

555
00:37:00,584 --> 00:37:01,785
I have no idea.
He just vanished.

556
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:03,787
Set up a five-block perimeter.
Now!

557
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,556
Get back! Get back!

558
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:07,925
Scott,
these are my associates.

559
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:09,660
Is that a camera on an ant?

560
00:37:09,693 --> 00:37:11,628
Yeah, sure. Why not?

561
00:37:11,661 --> 00:37:12,863
Where's the car?

562
00:37:12,896 --> 00:37:14,231
No car. We've got wings.

563
00:37:14,264 --> 00:37:15,533
Incoming!

564
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:28,779
Put your foot on the central
node and mount the thorax.

565
00:37:28,812 --> 00:37:30,812
- How safe is...
- Just get on the damn ant, Scott!

566
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,696
Why am I on a police car?

567
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:47,264
Shouldn't I not
be on a police car?

568
00:37:47,297 --> 00:37:49,066
So they can give you a lift

569
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:49,933
past their
five-block perimeter.

570
00:37:49,966 --> 00:37:51,668
All right.

571
00:37:51,701 --> 00:37:53,704
- Now, what's the next move?
- Hang on tight.

572
00:37:53,737 --> 00:37:55,539
Oh, this is easy!
I'm getting the hang of this.

573
00:37:55,572 --> 00:37:57,274
Yank up to go up.
It's like a horse.

574
00:37:57,307 --> 00:37:59,176
You're
throwing 247 off balance.

575
00:37:59,209 --> 00:38:01,044
Wait, his name is 247?

576
00:38:01,077 --> 00:38:02,846
He doesn't have a name,
he has a number, Scott.

577
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:05,148
Do you have any idea
how many ants there are?

578
00:38:05,181 --> 00:38:07,150
Whoa!

579
00:38:07,183 --> 00:38:08,886
Maybe it's...
Maybe it's 248.

580
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,654
No, no!
Vertigo, vertigo!

581
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:11,522
No, I think it's 247.

582
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:12,789
Wait.

583
00:38:12,822 --> 00:38:14,658
Hang on tight!

584
00:38:14,691 --> 00:38:16,793
I think
I'm getting the hang of this.

585
00:38:16,826 --> 00:38:19,630
I am controlling 247.
He is not listening to you.

586
00:38:19,663 --> 00:38:21,064
What?

587
00:38:21,097 --> 00:38:22,666
- Can I make one little request?
- No.

588
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:25,803
Stop, 247!
Time out, time out.

589
00:38:26,603 --> 00:38:27,838
Time out.

590
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:29,006
All right, hold on.

591
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:31,642
Just wait! Whoa!

592
00:38:31,675 --> 00:38:33,644
What happens
if I throw up in this helmet?

593
00:38:33,677 --> 00:38:36,813
It's my helmet, Scott.
You do not throw up.

594
00:38:36,846 --> 00:38:38,315
Let's set
her down, all right?

595
00:38:38,348 --> 00:38:39,583
I'm getting light-headed.

596
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,151
Hang on, Scott.

597
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:43,186
I'm getting a little light...

598
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:45,822
I need a snooze button.

599
00:38:45,855 --> 00:38:48,025
Hit me in 5 minutes.

600
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,878
Hello.

601
00:39:11,281 --> 00:39:12,281
Who are you?

602
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:17,321
Have you been standing there,
watching me sleep, this whole time?

603
00:39:17,354 --> 00:39:18,322
Yes.

604
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:20,824
Why?

605
00:39:20,857 --> 00:39:23,097
Because the last time you were here,
you stole something.

606
00:39:23,793 --> 00:39:25,729
Oh. Oh.

607
00:39:26,396 --> 00:39:27,396
Hey, look...

608
00:39:28,665 --> 00:39:29,665
Whoa!

609
00:39:34,104 --> 00:39:35,872
Paraponera clavata.

610
00:39:35,905 --> 00:39:37,641
Giant tropical bullet ants,

611
00:39:37,674 --> 00:39:39,276
ranked highest
on the Schmidt pain index.

612
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:41,189
They're here to
keep an eye on you when I can't.

613
00:39:42,112 --> 00:39:44,848
Dr. Pym's waiting
for you downstairs.

614
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:46,649
Who?

615
00:39:48,818 --> 00:39:49,886
Hey!

616
00:39:49,919 --> 00:39:52,590
Um... Whose pajamas are these?

617
00:39:58,995 --> 00:40:00,931
How am I supposed to do this?

618
00:40:07,137 --> 00:40:10,207
All right,
just one step at a time.

619
00:40:12,342 --> 00:40:13,342
Ugh!

620
00:40:15,211 --> 00:40:19,316
You don't bite me,
I don't step on you. Deal?

621
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:24,721
I could take down the servers

622
00:40:24,754 --> 00:40:25,856
and Cross
wouldn't even know it.

623
00:40:25,889 --> 00:40:27,357
We don't need this guy.

624
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,693
I assume that you've already
met my daughter, Hope.

625
00:40:29,726 --> 00:40:32,162
I did. She's great.

626
00:40:32,195 --> 00:40:34,665
She doesn't think
that we need you.

627
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,133
We don't.
We can do this ourselves.

628
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:39,202
I go to all this effort
to let you steal my suit,

629
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:42,072
and then Hope
has you arrested.

630
00:40:42,105 --> 00:40:44,975
Okay, we can try this and when he fails,
I'll do it myself.

631
00:40:45,008 --> 00:40:47,144
She's a little bit anxious.

632
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:49,046
It has to do with this job,

633
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,248
which, judging by the fact
that you're sitting opposite me,

634
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:53,817
I take it that
you're interested in.

635
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:54,985
What job?

636
00:40:55,018 --> 00:40:56,018
Would you like some tea?

637
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,288
Uh... Sure.

638
00:40:58,321 --> 00:41:00,157
I was very impressed with

639
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,760
how you managed to get
past my security system.

640
00:41:04,227 --> 00:41:07,064
Freezing that metal
was particularly clever.

641
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,765
Were you watching me?

642
00:41:08,798 --> 00:41:12,069
Scott, I've been
watching you for a while.

643
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,271
Ever since you
robbed Vista Corp.

644
00:41:15,772 --> 00:41:17,774
Oh! Excuse me.

645
00:41:17,807 --> 00:41:19,376
"Burgled" Vista Corp.

646
00:41:21,411 --> 00:41:23,246
Vista's security
system was one of

647
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:25,215
the most advanced
in the business.

648
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,017
It was supposed
to be unbeatable.

649
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,019
But you beat it.

650
00:41:29,052 --> 00:41:30,420
Would you like some sugar?

651
00:41:30,453 --> 00:41:32,022
Yeah, thanks.

652
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:37,161
You know what? I'm okay.

653
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,367
How do you make them do that?

654
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,270
Ants can lift objects
50 times their weight.

655
00:41:47,303 --> 00:41:50,974
They build, farm,
they cooperate with each other.

656
00:41:51,007 --> 00:41:52,976
Right. But how do you
make them do that?

657
00:41:55,145 --> 00:42:00,317
I use electromagnetic waves
to stimulate their olfactory nerve center.

658
00:42:01,951 --> 00:42:03,887
I speak to them.

659
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,123
I can go anywhere,
hear anything,

660
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:07,824
and see everything.

661
00:42:07,857 --> 00:42:09,326
And still know
absolutely nothing.

662
00:42:10,126 --> 00:42:11,161
I'm late to meet Cross.

663
00:42:14,998 --> 00:42:17,000
Uh... Dr. Pym?

664
00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:19,870
You don't need to
raise your hand, Scott.

665
00:42:19,903 --> 00:42:22,839
Sorry,
I just have one question.

666
00:42:22,872 --> 00:42:24,808
Who are you, who is she,
what the hell's going on,

667
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:26,376
and can I go back to jail now?

668
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:28,411
Come with me.

669
00:42:28,444 --> 00:42:30,514
40 years ago,
I created a formula

670
00:42:30,547 --> 00:42:32,783
that altered atomic
relative distance.

671
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,251
Huh?

672
00:42:34,284 --> 00:42:36,219
I learned how to change
the distance between atoms.

673
00:42:36,252 --> 00:42:37,988
That's what powers the suit.

674
00:42:38,021 --> 00:42:39,490
That's why it works.

675
00:42:40,924 --> 00:42:41,925
Wow.

676
00:42:47,297 --> 00:42:48,899
- Whoa!
- But it was dangerous.

677
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,468
It was too dangerous.

678
00:42:53,069 --> 00:42:56,072
So I hid it from the world.

679
00:42:56,105 --> 00:42:58,545
And that's when I switched gears
and I started my own company.

680
00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:00,544
Pym Tech.

681
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:03,013
Yes.

682
00:43:03,046 --> 00:43:06,883
I took on a young protege
called Darren Cross.

683
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:08,018
Darren Cross.

684
00:43:08,051 --> 00:43:09,486
He's a big deal.

685
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:12,088
But before he was a big deal,
he was my assistant.

686
00:43:12,121 --> 00:43:16,326
I thought I saw something in him.
The son I never had, perhaps.

687
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:18,895
He was brilliant,
but as we became close,

688
00:43:18,928 --> 00:43:22,365
he began to suspect
that I wasn't telling him everything.

689
00:43:22,398 --> 00:43:26,136
He heard rumors about
what was called the Pym Particle,

690
00:43:26,169 --> 00:43:29,840
and he became obsessed
with recreating my formula.

691
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,842
But I wouldn't help him.

692
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,878
So he conspired against me and
he voted me out of my own company.

693
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:36,479
How could he do that?

694
00:43:36,512 --> 00:43:39,149
The board's chairman
is my daughter, Hope.

695
00:43:39,182 --> 00:43:40,317
She was the deciding vote.

696
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,521
But she came back to me

697
00:43:44,554 --> 00:43:47,357
when she saw how close
Cross was to cracking my formula.

698
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:51,094
The process is highly volatile.

699
00:43:51,127 --> 00:43:54,030
If one isn't protected
by a specialized helmet,

700
00:43:54,063 --> 00:43:57,534
it can affect
the brain's chemistry.

701
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:00,036
I don't think
Darren realizes this,

702
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:03,340
and, you know, he's not
the most stable guy to begin with.

703
00:44:03,373 --> 00:44:05,342
So, what do you want from me?

704
00:44:08,011 --> 00:44:11,348
Scott, I believe that everyone deserves
a shot at redemption.

705
00:44:11,381 --> 00:44:12,415
Do you?

706
00:44:12,448 --> 00:44:13,917
I do.

707
00:44:14,584 --> 00:44:16,286
If you can help me,

708
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,857
I promise I can help you be
with your daughter again.

709
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:23,260
Now, are you ready
to redeem yourself?

710
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,662
Absolutely.

711
00:44:25,695 --> 00:44:28,565
My days of breaking into places
and stealing shit are done.

712
00:44:30,033 --> 00:44:31,601
What do you want me to do?

713
00:44:31,634 --> 00:44:34,471
I want you to break into a place
and steal some shit.

714
00:44:37,674 --> 00:44:39,274
Are you gonna be home
for dinner tonight?

715
00:44:41,377 --> 00:44:43,446
Uh, yeah.
I'll pick something up.
Text me.

716
00:44:43,479 --> 00:44:45,315
Okay. Good news?

717
00:44:45,348 --> 00:44:47,350
Uh... I don't know. It's news.

718
00:44:47,383 --> 00:44:49,920
Are you trying
to find my daddy?

719
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:53,523
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.

720
00:44:55,024 --> 00:44:56,293
I just want your
daddy to be safe.

721
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,462
Hope you don't catch him.

722
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,509
This isn't
the first time these guys

723
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:49,379
have tried to get their hands
on game-changing weaponry.

724
00:45:49,412 --> 00:45:53,516
That's Mitchell Carson,
Ex-Head of Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.

725
00:45:53,549 --> 00:45:56,252
Presently in the business
of toppling governments.

726
00:45:56,285 --> 00:45:58,388
He always wanted my tech.

727
00:45:58,421 --> 00:46:01,591
And now, unless we break in
and steal the Yellowjacket

728
00:46:01,624 --> 00:46:04,561
and destroy all the data,

729
00:46:04,594 --> 00:46:09,599
Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos
upon the world.

730
00:46:12,368 --> 00:46:16,306
I think our first move should be
calling the Avengers.

731
00:46:17,573 --> 00:46:19,576
I spent half my life

732
00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:23,046
trying to keep this technology
out of the hands of a Stark.

733
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:26,683
I'm sure as hell not gonna
hand-deliver it to one now.

734
00:46:26,716 --> 00:46:30,120
This is not some cute technology
like the Iron Man suit.

735
00:46:30,153 --> 00:46:32,522
This could change
the texture of reality.

736
00:46:34,657 --> 00:46:36,493
Besides,
they're probably too busy

737
00:46:36,526 --> 00:46:39,295
dropping cities
out of the sky.

738
00:46:39,328 --> 00:46:41,064
Okay, then why don't you
just send the ants?

739
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:44,300
Scott, they are ants.

740
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:47,671
Ants, they can do a lot of things,
but they still need a leader.

741
00:46:49,138 --> 00:46:51,608
Somebody that could
infiltrate a place

742
00:46:51,641 --> 00:46:54,044
that's designed to
prevent infiltration.

743
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:55,712
Hank, I'm a thief, all right?
I mean,

744
00:46:55,745 --> 00:46:57,714
I'm a good thief,
but this is insane.

745
00:46:57,747 --> 00:47:00,083
He's right, Hank.
And you know it.

746
00:47:00,116 --> 00:47:03,053
You've seen the footage,
you know what Cross is capable of.

747
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:04,487
I was against using him
when we had months,

748
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,523
and now we have days.

749
00:47:06,556 --> 00:47:07,590
I'm wearing the suit.

750
00:47:07,623 --> 00:47:09,526
Absolutely not!

751
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:12,262
I know the facility inside and out.
I know how Cross thinks.

752
00:47:12,295 --> 00:47:14,230
I know this mission
better than anybody here.

753
00:47:14,263 --> 00:47:16,699
We need you close to Cross.
Otherwise, this mission cannot work.

754
00:47:16,732 --> 00:47:17,834
We don't have
time to screw around!

755
00:47:17,867 --> 00:47:19,302
Hope, please
listen to me...

756
00:47:19,335 --> 00:47:20,603
He is a criminal!
I'm your daughter.

757
00:47:20,636 --> 00:47:21,772
No!

758
00:48:00,376 --> 00:48:02,178
She's right, Hank.

759
00:48:02,211 --> 00:48:04,447
I'm not your guy.

760
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,682
Why don't you wear the suit?

761
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:09,152
You think I don't want to?

762
00:48:09,185 --> 00:48:10,387
I can't.

763
00:48:12,288 --> 00:48:13,690
I spent years wearing it,

764
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:16,760
and it took a toll on me.

765
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:25,469
You're our only option.

766
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:34,210
Before Hope lost her mother,

767
00:48:34,243 --> 00:48:37,781
she used to look at me like
I was the greatest man in the world.

768
00:48:39,849 --> 00:48:42,719
And now she looks at me
and there's just disappointment.

769
00:48:46,489 --> 00:48:48,258
It's too late for me,

770
00:48:49,492 --> 00:48:51,294
but not for you.

771
00:48:51,327 --> 00:48:53,496
This is your chance.

772
00:48:53,529 --> 00:48:57,200
The chance to earn that look
in your daughter's eyes.

773
00:48:57,233 --> 00:49:01,804
To become the hero
that she already thinks you are.

774
00:49:01,837 --> 00:49:03,907
It's not about
saving our world.

775
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,644
It's about saving theirs.

776
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:12,616
Damn. That was a good speech.

777
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:14,284
Scott,

778
00:49:15,551 --> 00:49:19,156
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

779
00:49:22,491 --> 00:49:24,227
In the right hands,

780
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:27,197
the relationship
between man and suit is symbiotic.

781
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,833
The suit has power.
The man harnesses that power.

782
00:49:30,866 --> 00:49:33,736
You need to be skillful,
agile, and above all,

783
00:49:33,769 --> 00:49:35,238
you need to be fast.

784
00:49:35,271 --> 00:49:37,240
You should be able
to shrink and grow

785
00:49:37,273 --> 00:49:38,841
on a dime.

786
00:49:38,874 --> 00:49:41,945
So your size
always suits your needs.

787
00:49:43,412 --> 00:49:45,348
Now dive through the keyhole,
Scott.

788
00:49:45,381 --> 00:49:48,919
You charge big, you dive small,
then you emerge big.

789
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,556
Ow!

790
00:49:53,823 --> 00:49:55,458
Ahhh!

791
00:49:55,491 --> 00:49:57,227
Ow!

792
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,260
Useless.

793
00:50:00,696 --> 00:50:01,998
When you're small,
energy's compressed,

794
00:50:02,031 --> 00:50:04,400
so you have the force
of a 200-pound man

795
00:50:04,433 --> 00:50:07,570
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide.
You're like a bullet.

796
00:50:07,603 --> 00:50:10,974
You punch too hard, you kill someone.
Too soft, it's a love tap.

797
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:12,775
In other words,
you have to know how to punch.

798
00:50:12,808 --> 00:50:14,010
I was in prison for three years.
I know how to punch.

799
00:50:14,043 --> 00:50:16,012
Show me.

800
00:50:16,045 --> 00:50:17,805
- Terrible.
- You wanna show me how to punch?

801
00:50:18,381 --> 00:50:19,382
Show me...

802
00:50:20,816 --> 00:50:22,819
That's how you punch.

803
00:50:22,852 --> 00:50:24,254
She's been
looking forward to this.

804
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:25,722
No kidding.

805
00:50:25,755 --> 00:50:28,391
Hope trained in martial arts
at a difficult time.

806
00:50:28,424 --> 00:50:30,526
Oh, by "difficult time,"
he means when my mother died.

807
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,662
We lost her in a plane crash.

808
00:50:32,695 --> 00:50:34,464
It's bad enough
you won't tell me how she died.

809
00:50:34,497 --> 00:50:35,898
Could you please stop
telling me that lie?

810
00:50:35,931 --> 00:50:37,734
We're working, here.

811
00:50:40,903 --> 00:50:42,623
All right, princess.
Let's get back to work.

812
00:50:43,572 --> 00:50:45,609
Were you going for the hand?

813
00:50:52,348 --> 00:50:54,317
You know, I think this regulator
is holding me back.

814
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:56,886
Do not screw
with the regulator.

815
00:50:56,919 --> 00:50:58,721
If that
regulator is compromised,

816
00:50:58,754 --> 00:51:00,523
you would go subatomic.

817
00:51:00,556 --> 00:51:02,992
What does that mean?

818
00:51:03,025 --> 00:51:05,061
It means that you would enter
a quantum realm.

819
00:51:05,094 --> 00:51:06,763
What does that mean?

820
00:51:06,796 --> 00:51:08,898
It means that you
would enter a reality

821
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:11,334
where all concepts
of time and space

822
00:51:11,367 --> 00:51:12,468
become irrelevant

823
00:51:12,501 --> 00:51:14,938
as you shrink
for all eternity.

824
00:51:15,871 --> 00:51:18,508
Everything that you know

825
00:51:18,541 --> 00:51:19,843
and love,

826
00:51:20,743 --> 00:51:22,345
gone forever.

827
00:51:23,479 --> 00:51:26,616
Cool.
Yeah, if it ain't broke...

828
00:51:26,649 --> 00:51:28,084
You've learned about the suit,

829
00:51:28,117 --> 00:51:30,787
but you've yet to learn
about your greatest allies,

830
00:51:32,121 --> 00:51:33,121
the ants.

831
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:35,091
Loyal, brave,

832
00:51:35,124 --> 00:51:36,893
and your partners on this job.

833
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:46,102
Paratrechina longicornis.
Commonly known as crazy ants.

834
00:51:46,135 --> 00:51:48,471
They're lightning fast
and can conduct electricity,

835
00:51:48,504 --> 00:51:50,707
which makes them useful
to fry out enemy electronics.

836
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,642
You're not so crazy.

837
00:51:53,843 --> 00:51:54,877
Hey!

838
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:56,012
You're cute.

839
00:52:04,887 --> 00:52:07,390
That was a lot
scarier a second ago.

840
00:52:16,932 --> 00:52:20,103
It looks like the Futures Lab
has its own isolated power supply.

841
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:22,105
There's a security
guard posted around the clock.

842
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:24,574
We'll need you to take him out
to deactivate the security systems.

843
00:52:24,607 --> 00:52:26,943
Okay, who's next?

844
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:31,047
Paraponera clavata.

845
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,515
I know.
Bullet ants, right?

846
00:52:32,548 --> 00:52:33,983
Number 1 on
the Schmidt pain index?

847
00:52:34,016 --> 00:52:35,819
Hey, guys.
Remember me from the bedroom?

848
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:40,790
The Yellowjacket pod
is hermetically sealed,

849
00:52:40,823 --> 00:52:42,458
and the only
access point is a tube

850
00:52:42,491 --> 00:52:45,027
we estimate to be about
5 millimeters in diameter.

851
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,963
Why do I have a sick feeling
in my stomach?

852
00:52:46,996 --> 00:52:49,432
The tube is protected
by a laser grid,

853
00:52:49,465 --> 00:52:51,167
and we can only
power that down for 15 seconds.

854
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,736
You're gonna need to signal
the crazy ants to blow the servers,

855
00:52:53,769 --> 00:52:55,872
retrieve the suit,
and exit the vaults

856
00:52:55,905 --> 00:52:57,907
before
the backup power comes on.

857
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:00,777
Camponotus pennsylvanicus.

858
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,412
Alternatively known
as a carpenter ant.

859
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:05,081
Ideal for ground
and air transport.

860
00:53:05,114 --> 00:53:06,783
Wait a minute,
I know this guy.

861
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:10,620
I'm gonna call
him "Ant-thony."

862
00:53:10,653 --> 00:53:11,954
That's good. That's very good.

863
00:53:11,987 --> 00:53:14,157
Because this time,
you're really gonna

864
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,659
have to learn
how to control him.

865
00:53:16,692 --> 00:53:19,562
Tell them to put
the sugar in the teacup.

866
00:53:22,164 --> 00:53:23,466
Aw! You okay? Did I hurt...

867
00:53:35,511 --> 00:53:37,613
Hank wants you outside
for target practice.

868
00:53:37,646 --> 00:53:39,886
The suit has no weapons,
so I made you these discs.

869
00:53:39,915 --> 00:53:40,950
Red shrinks.

870
00:53:42,184 --> 00:53:43,720
Blue enlarges.

871
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,491
Solenopsis mandibularis.

872
00:53:48,524 --> 00:53:50,660
Known for their bite,

873
00:53:50,693 --> 00:53:53,162
the fire ants have evolved
into remarkable architects.

874
00:53:53,195 --> 00:53:55,632
They are handy to
get you in and out of difficult places.

875
00:54:05,174 --> 00:54:06,943
You can do it, Scott. Come on.

876
00:54:09,778 --> 00:54:11,881
They're
not listening to me.

877
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:14,650
You have to commit.
You have to mean it.

878
00:54:14,683 --> 00:54:16,719
No shortcuts, no lies.

879
00:54:16,752 --> 00:54:18,921
Throwing
insults into the mix

880
00:54:18,954 --> 00:54:21,257
will not do
anyone any good, Hope.

881
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:23,025
We don't have time for coddling.

882
00:54:23,058 --> 00:54:25,094
Our focus should
be on helping Scott!

883
00:54:25,127 --> 00:54:26,496
Really?

884
00:54:27,863 --> 00:54:29,183
Is that where our
focus should be?

885
00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:54,724
Hope!

886
00:55:03,732 --> 00:55:06,069
I don't know why I came to you
in the first place.

887
00:55:15,077 --> 00:55:17,180
We can't do this without her.

888
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:22,885
Oh, God.

889
00:55:22,918 --> 00:55:24,921
You gotta lock your doors.

890
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:27,890
I mean, really, there's some weird folks
in this neighborhood.

891
00:55:27,923 --> 00:55:30,593
Do you think this is a joke?

892
00:55:30,626 --> 00:55:32,995
Do you have any idea what
he's asking you to risk?

893
00:55:33,028 --> 00:55:34,297
You have a daughter.

894
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:36,265
I'm doing this for her.

895
00:55:36,298 --> 00:55:38,738
You know, when my mother died,
I didn't see him for two weeks.

896
00:55:39,668 --> 00:55:40,803
He was in grief.

897
00:55:40,836 --> 00:55:42,338
Yeah,
so was I, and I was seven.

898
00:55:42,371 --> 00:55:45,675
And he never came back.
Not in any way that counted.

899
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:47,228
He just sent me off
to boarding school.

900
00:55:48,877 --> 00:55:49,877
You know, I thought,

901
00:55:50,713 --> 00:55:52,181
with all that's at stake,

902
00:55:52,214 --> 00:55:55,184
just maybe we might have
a chance of making peace.

903
00:55:55,217 --> 00:55:57,186
But, even now,
he still wants to shut me out.

904
00:55:57,219 --> 00:56:00,122
He doesn't wanna shut you out.
He trusts you.

905
00:56:00,155 --> 00:56:01,791
Then why are you here?

906
00:56:01,824 --> 00:56:03,626
It proves that he loves you.

907
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:07,096
Hope. Look at me.

908
00:56:08,797 --> 00:56:10,233
I'm expendable.

909
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:12,101
That's why I'm here.

910
00:56:13,669 --> 00:56:16,339
You must have
realized that by now.

911
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:18,252
I mean, it's why I'm in the suit
and you're not.

912
00:56:20,676 --> 00:56:22,612
He would rather
lose this fight than lose you.

913
00:56:24,713 --> 00:56:25,713
Anyway...

914
00:56:27,116 --> 00:56:30,119
You know, I didn't know
you had a daughter

915
00:56:30,152 --> 00:56:32,155
when I called the cops on you.

916
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:37,392
What's her name?

917
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:39,929
Cassie.

918
00:56:40,863 --> 00:56:42,231
It's a pretty name.

919
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:47,303
You have to clear
your mind, Scott.

920
00:56:47,336 --> 00:56:48,904
You have to make
your thoughts precise.

921
00:56:48,937 --> 00:56:50,707
That's how it works.

922
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,709
Think about Cassie.

923
00:56:53,742 --> 00:56:57,246
About how badly you want to see her.
And use that to focus.

924
00:57:05,988 --> 00:57:08,024
Open your eyes

925
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:10,226
and just think about
what you want the ants to do.

926
00:57:33,048 --> 00:57:34,283
That's good!

927
00:57:52,201 --> 00:57:55,137
Your mother convinced me

928
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:58,908
to let her join
me on my missions.

929
00:57:58,941 --> 00:58:00,976
They called her the Wasp.

930
00:58:01,009 --> 00:58:03,212
She was born to it.

931
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,816
And there's not
a day that goes by

932
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:10,720
that I don't
regret having said yes.

933
00:58:15,157 --> 00:58:17,827
It was 1987.

934
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:22,131
Separatists had hijacked
a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

935
00:58:23,866 --> 00:58:26,436
and launched an ICBM
at the United States.

936
00:58:34,276 --> 00:58:37,279
The only way to
the internal mechanics

937
00:58:37,312 --> 00:58:39,248
was through solid titanium.

938
00:58:48,957 --> 00:58:53,496
I knew I had to shrink between
the molecules to disarm the missile.

939
00:58:53,529 --> 00:58:56,399
But my regulator had sustained
too much damage.

940
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,969
Your mother,

941
00:59:00,002 --> 00:59:01,170
she didn't hesitate.

942
00:59:03,338 --> 00:59:04,941
Janet! No!

943
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,183
She turned off her regulator

944
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:16,452
and went subatomic

945
00:59:18,153 --> 00:59:20,223
to deactivate the bomb.

946
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:23,860
And she was gone.

947
00:59:28,297 --> 00:59:30,399
Your mom died a hero.

948
00:59:33,302 --> 00:59:35,504
And I spent the next 10 years

949
00:59:35,537 --> 00:59:39,842
trying to learn all I could
about the quantum realm.

950
00:59:43,412 --> 00:59:45,348
You were trying
to bring her back.

951
00:59:47,382 --> 00:59:50,787
But all I learned
was we know nothing.

952
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:57,393
It's not your fault.

953
00:59:59,995 --> 01:00:01,430
She made her choice.

954
01:00:07,135 --> 01:00:10,873
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?

955
01:00:10,906 --> 01:00:13,476
I was trying to protect you.

956
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:17,113
I lost your mother.

957
01:00:19,348 --> 01:00:22,018
I didn't mean
to lose you, too.

958
01:00:22,651 --> 01:00:24,220
I'm sorry.

959
01:00:27,623 --> 01:00:28,858
This is awesome.

960
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:32,061
It's awesome, you know?

961
01:00:32,094 --> 01:00:34,014
You guys are breaking down walls,
you're healing.

962
01:00:35,063 --> 01:00:36,299
It's important.

963
01:00:39,234 --> 01:00:40,936
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

964
01:00:40,969 --> 01:00:42,471
Yes, you did. Yes.

965
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:45,374
I'm going to make some tea.

966
01:00:51,213 --> 01:00:52,281
Nailed it!

967
01:01:01,556 --> 01:01:03,392
That's a good boy, Ant-thony.

968
01:01:33,488 --> 01:01:36,392
The final phase of your training
will be a stealth incursion.

969
01:01:36,425 --> 01:01:37,960
It's freezing!

970
01:01:37,993 --> 01:01:40,996
You couldn't make a suit
with a flannel lining?

971
01:01:41,029 --> 01:01:44,033
You must retrieve this prototype
of a signal decoy.

972
01:01:44,066 --> 01:01:46,635
It's a device that I invented
during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

973
01:01:46,668 --> 01:01:48,404
We need it to counteract
the transmission blockers

974
01:01:48,437 --> 01:01:50,106
that Cross installed
in the Futures vault.

975
01:01:51,606 --> 01:01:53,642
It's currently collecting dust

976
01:01:53,675 --> 01:01:56,378
in one of Howard Stark's old
storage facilities in upstate New York.

977
01:01:56,411 --> 01:01:58,414
Should be a piece of cake.

978
01:01:58,447 --> 01:02:00,382
You're over the target area.

979
01:02:00,415 --> 01:02:02,952
Disengage now, Scott!

980
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:03,986
Squadron A, go!

981
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:05,321
B, go!

982
01:02:07,689 --> 01:02:09,959
C, go!

983
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:13,329
All right, Ant-thony,
please don't drop me this time.

984
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:16,565
Oh, it feels like a big leap
from sugar cubes to this!

985
01:02:16,598 --> 01:02:17,598
Stay calm.

986
01:02:19,468 --> 01:02:21,603
Guys?
We might have a problem.

987
01:02:21,636 --> 01:02:25,107
Hank, didn't you say
this was some old warehouse?

988
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,140
It's not!

989
01:02:27,409 --> 01:02:29,278
You son of a bitch!

990
01:02:31,646 --> 01:02:33,515
- Scott, get out of there.
- Abort!

991
01:02:33,548 --> 01:02:35,250
Abort now!

992
01:02:35,283 --> 01:02:37,486
No, it's okay. It doesn't look
like anyone's home.

993
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:39,555
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

994
01:02:40,455 --> 01:02:41,590
He's gonna lose the suit.

995
01:02:41,623 --> 01:02:43,125
He's gonna lose his life.

996
01:02:49,197 --> 01:02:51,157
All right, I'm on the roof
of the target building.

997
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:53,602
Somebody's home, Scott.

998
01:02:57,139 --> 01:02:58,307
What's going on
down there, Sam?

999
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:00,309
It's the Falcon!

1000
01:03:00,342 --> 01:03:02,244
I had a sensor trip
but I'm not seeing anything.

1001
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:04,079
Wait a second.

1002
01:03:04,112 --> 01:03:06,148
Abort, Scott! Abort now!

1003
01:03:06,181 --> 01:03:07,549
It's okay. He can't see me.

1004
01:03:07,582 --> 01:03:08,684
I can see you.

1005
01:03:08,717 --> 01:03:09,717
He can see me.

1006
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:14,390
Hi. I'm Scott.

1007
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:16,091
Did he just say,
"Hi, I'm Scott"?

1008
01:03:16,124 --> 01:03:17,626
What are you doing here?

1009
01:03:17,659 --> 01:03:19,495
First off, I'm a big fan.

1010
01:03:19,528 --> 01:03:21,088
Appreciate it.
So, who the hell are you?

1011
01:03:21,763 --> 01:03:22,798
I'm Ant-Man.

1012
01:03:22,831 --> 01:03:24,333
"Ant-Man"?

1013
01:03:24,366 --> 01:03:26,502
What? You haven't heard of me?

1014
01:03:26,535 --> 01:03:28,670
No, you wouldn't
have heard of me.

1015
01:03:28,703 --> 01:03:30,406
You wanna tell
me what you want?

1016
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:32,708
I was hoping I could grab
a piece of technology.

1017
01:03:32,741 --> 01:03:34,710
Just for a few days.
I'm gonna return it.

1018
01:03:34,743 --> 01:03:37,413
I need it to save the world.
You know how that is.

1019
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:38,681
I know exactly how that is.

1020
01:03:39,581 --> 01:03:40,749
Located the breach.

1021
01:03:40,782 --> 01:03:42,262
- Bringing him in.
- Sorry about this!

1022
01:03:46,688 --> 01:03:48,190
What the hell are you doing?

1023
01:03:51,326 --> 01:03:52,661
Breach is an adult male,

1024
01:03:52,694 --> 01:03:54,094
who has some sort
of shrinking tech.

1025
01:04:07,242 --> 01:04:08,477
Sorry!

1026
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:09,830
Look, I'm sorry about this.
Sorry.

1027
01:04:10,579 --> 01:04:11,580
That's enough!

1028
01:04:34,636 --> 01:04:36,305
Ant-thony! A little help!

1029
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,151
I've lost visual.

1030
01:04:59,327 --> 01:05:00,629
He's inside my pack!

1031
01:05:00,662 --> 01:05:01,697
Sorry!

1032
01:05:03,498 --> 01:05:04,778
You seem like
a really great guy.

1033
01:05:29,858 --> 01:05:33,462
It's really important to me
that Cap never finds out about this.

1034
01:05:36,932 --> 01:05:40,236
That was completely irresponsible
and dangerous!

1035
01:05:40,936 --> 01:05:43,172
You jeopardized everything!

1036
01:05:59,321 --> 01:06:00,723
You got it.

1037
01:06:03,725 --> 01:06:04,760
Well done.

1038
01:06:04,793 --> 01:06:05,827
Wait a minute.

1039
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,329
Did you just compliment me?

1040
01:06:07,362 --> 01:06:08,597
He did, didn't he?

1041
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,465
Kind of sounded like he did.

1042
01:06:11,866 --> 01:06:13,268
I was good, wasn't I?

1043
01:06:15,303 --> 01:06:18,574
Hey, how about the fact that
I fought an Avenger and didn't die?

1044
01:06:18,607 --> 01:06:20,943
Let us not dwell on the past.

1045
01:06:20,976 --> 01:06:22,878
We gotta finish our planning.

1046
01:06:25,447 --> 01:06:26,916
Don't mind him.

1047
01:06:27,649 --> 01:06:28,684
You did good.

1048
01:06:35,557 --> 01:06:36,792
Darren.

1049
01:06:39,794 --> 01:06:41,463
How the hell did
you get in here?

1050
01:06:42,664 --> 01:06:45,300
You left
the front door open, Hank.

1051
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:46,368
It's official.

1052
01:06:46,401 --> 01:06:47,503
You're old.

1053
01:06:48,303 --> 01:06:49,303
The plans.

1054
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:52,274
He will kill him.

1055
01:06:55,677 --> 01:06:57,980
Well, to what do I
owe this pleasure?

1056
01:06:59,414 --> 01:07:00,749
I have good news.

1057
01:07:00,782 --> 01:07:01,850
Really?

1058
01:07:02,851 --> 01:07:04,620
What's that?

1059
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:09,324
Pym Tech,
the company you created,

1060
01:07:09,357 --> 01:07:11,326
is about to
become one of the most

1061
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:13,428
profitable
operations in the world.

1062
01:07:13,461 --> 01:07:16,799
We're anticipating $15 billion in sales,
tomorrow alone.

1063
01:07:23,438 --> 01:07:24,573
You're welcome.

1064
01:07:29,077 --> 01:07:32,047
I know this is odd,
but I'd like you to be there.

1065
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,849
This is my moment.
I want you to see it.

1066
01:07:35,517 --> 01:07:36,918
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

1067
01:07:36,951 --> 01:07:38,254
I'll be there.

1068
01:07:55,503 --> 01:07:56,739
What did you see in me?

1069
01:07:57,906 --> 01:08:00,442
I don't know what you mean.

1070
01:08:00,475 --> 01:08:02,878
All those years ago,
you picked me.

1071
01:08:02,911 --> 01:08:04,446
What did you see?

1072
01:08:06,581 --> 01:08:08,950
I saw myself.

1073
01:08:08,983 --> 01:08:11,387
Then why did you push me away?

1074
01:08:12,921 --> 01:08:16,292
Because I saw
too much of myself.

1075
01:08:27,102 --> 01:08:28,603
He knows.
He's baiting you.

1076
01:08:28,636 --> 01:08:30,572
We have to call it off.

1077
01:08:30,605 --> 01:08:31,640
We're all taking risks.

1078
01:08:31,673 --> 01:08:33,008
What if he saw me here?

1079
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:34,643
He didn't. There's no way.

1080
01:08:34,676 --> 01:08:35,677
How do you know that?

1081
01:08:44,486 --> 01:08:45,654
Darren, hi.

1082
01:08:45,687 --> 01:08:48,524
Hope, where are you right now?

1083
01:08:49,157 --> 01:08:50,392
I'm at home. Why?

1084
01:08:50,425 --> 01:08:52,427
I just saw Hank.

1085
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:54,529
I still get nothing
but contempt from him.

1086
01:08:54,562 --> 01:08:57,933
Don't let him rile you up.
He's just a senile old man.

1087
01:08:57,966 --> 01:09:00,502
We need to start
everyone working around the clock.

1088
01:09:00,535 --> 01:09:02,404
Get the assembly
line up and running.

1089
01:09:02,437 --> 01:09:03,739
And I'm tripling security.

1090
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:05,841
Full sensors at all entrances

1091
01:09:05,874 --> 01:09:09,144
and exterior air vents
fitted with steel micro-mesh.

1092
01:09:09,177 --> 01:09:11,780
Great. Good idea.

1093
01:09:11,813 --> 01:09:14,983
Thank you, Hope.
I'm so lucky to have you on my team.

1094
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:22,157
He's tripling security.
He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

1095
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:24,393
But he is not onto you.

1096
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:26,628
He's adding full body scanners
to all entrances

1097
01:09:26,661 --> 01:09:28,663
and closing exterior vents.

1098
01:09:28,696 --> 01:09:30,432
How are we gonna
get Scott inside?

1099
01:09:31,933 --> 01:09:33,469
The water main.

1100
01:09:34,769 --> 01:09:36,738
You can't add
security to a water main.

1101
01:09:36,771 --> 01:09:38,940
The pressure is too strong,
but if we can decrease it,

1102
01:09:38,973 --> 01:09:40,742
that's how I get in.

1103
01:09:40,775 --> 01:09:42,711
Somebody would have to reach
the building's control center

1104
01:09:42,744 --> 01:09:43,945
to change the water pressure.

1105
01:09:43,978 --> 01:09:45,580
Hank and I will
be beside Cross.

1106
01:09:45,613 --> 01:09:46,748
How are we
supposed to do that?

1107
01:09:46,781 --> 01:09:48,083
So we expand our team.

1108
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:50,152
What do we need?

1109
01:09:50,185 --> 01:09:51,920
A fake security
guard on the inside

1110
01:09:51,953 --> 01:09:53,622
to de-pressurize
the water system,

1111
01:09:53,655 --> 01:09:55,524
somebody else to hack in
to the power supply

1112
01:09:55,557 --> 01:09:56,858
and kill the laser grid,

1113
01:09:56,891 --> 01:09:59,628
and a getaway guy.

1114
01:09:59,661 --> 01:10:03,999
No, no. No, no, no.
Not those three wombats.
No way.

1115
01:10:04,032 --> 01:10:06,034
Thank you for
the coffee, ma'am.

1116
01:10:06,067 --> 01:10:09,037
It's not too often that you rob a place
and then get welcomed back.

1117
01:10:09,070 --> 01:10:10,939
Because we just robbed you.

1118
01:10:13,007 --> 01:10:16,111
You know that he was arrested
for stealing a smoothie machine, right?

1119
01:10:16,144 --> 01:10:17,679
Two smoothie machines.

1120
01:10:17,712 --> 01:10:19,147
Are you sure they
can handle this?

1121
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:20,949
Oh, we can handle it.
We're professionals.

1122
01:10:20,982 --> 01:10:24,719
You'll forgive us if we're not
instilled with confidence.

1123
01:10:24,752 --> 01:10:27,088
Well, hey, everybody just kick back
and relax a little bit, man.

1124
01:10:27,121 --> 01:10:28,790
We know our business.

1125
01:10:28,823 --> 01:10:30,926
We broke into this
spooky-ass house, didn't we?

1126
01:10:30,959 --> 01:10:32,627
I let you.

1127
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:35,997
Well, one could say
that I let you let me.

1128
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:37,732
Look, it's okay.
They can handle this.

1129
01:10:37,765 --> 01:10:39,568
Yeah, we can handle it.

1130
01:10:39,601 --> 01:10:41,002
- You got their credentials?
- He's in the system.

1131
01:10:41,035 --> 01:10:42,537
I'm in the system?

1132
01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:43,605
You're in the system.

1133
01:10:43,638 --> 01:10:44,840
The system?

1134
01:10:44,873 --> 01:10:47,242
Yeah, we're doomed.

1135
01:10:47,275 --> 01:10:48,710
All right.

1136
01:10:48,743 --> 01:10:50,111
There's something
you guys need to see.

1137
01:10:50,144 --> 01:10:52,214
When you get to this corner,

1138
01:10:52,247 --> 01:10:54,850
there's gonna be three offices
on your left side.

1139
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:56,018
Damn!

1140
01:10:57,886 --> 01:11:00,856
Whoa! That's so cool, bro!

1141
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:03,625
Now, look,
this is gonna get weird, all right?

1142
01:11:03,658 --> 01:11:05,126
It's pretty freaky,
but it's safe.

1143
01:11:05,159 --> 01:11:06,962
There's no
reason to be scared.

1144
01:11:06,995 --> 01:11:08,163
Oh, no, no.
Daddy don't get scared.

1145
01:11:08,196 --> 01:11:10,098
- Really?
- Yeah.

1146
01:11:10,131 --> 01:11:11,131
Good.

1147
01:11:18,606 --> 01:11:20,575
This is the work of gypsies.

1148
01:11:20,608 --> 01:11:21,810
That's witchcraft.

1149
01:11:21,843 --> 01:11:23,578
Wow, that's amazing.

1150
01:11:23,611 --> 01:11:25,113
That's like some
David Copperfield shit.

1151
01:11:25,146 --> 01:11:26,081
That's some kind of wizardry.

1152
01:11:26,114 --> 01:11:27,282
This is sorcery!

1153
01:11:27,315 --> 01:11:28,850
How'd you do that, bro?

1154
01:11:28,883 --> 01:11:30,683
Don't freak out.
Look at your shoulder.

1155
01:11:30,985 --> 01:11:32,521
Ahhh!

1156
01:11:32,554 --> 01:11:34,022
Get off! Get off!

1157
01:11:34,055 --> 01:11:36,658
Wait, I thought
Daddy didn't get scared!

1158
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:40,529
I gave them each half a Xanax

1159
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:42,797
and Hank explained the science
of the suit to them.

1160
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:45,800
They fell right asleep.

1161
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:48,303
Hey, look,
I wanna thank you for...

1162
01:11:48,336 --> 01:11:50,305
No, please don't.

1163
01:11:50,338 --> 01:11:51,806
We're all doing
this for reasons

1164
01:11:51,839 --> 01:11:53,041
much bigger
than any one of us.

1165
01:11:53,074 --> 01:11:55,010
I'm just glad
that you might have

1166
01:11:55,043 --> 01:11:56,945
a slight chance of
maybe pulling this off.

1167
01:11:56,978 --> 01:12:00,115
Hey, thank you, you know,
for that pep talk.

1168
01:12:00,148 --> 01:12:02,684
You know, the honest truth is,
I actually went from despising you

1169
01:12:02,717 --> 01:12:04,553
to almost liking you.

1170
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:06,154
You really
should write poetry.

1171
01:12:09,657 --> 01:12:11,159
Get some sleep, Scott.

1172
01:13:01,876 --> 01:13:03,144
All right,
just so we're clear,

1173
01:13:03,177 --> 01:13:04,746
everyone here knows
their role, right?

1174
01:13:04,779 --> 01:13:06,247
- Dave?
- Wheels on the ground.

1175
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,816
- Kurt?
- Eyes in the sky.

1176
01:13:07,849 --> 01:13:09,150
- Luis?
- Oh, man, you know it.

1177
01:13:09,183 --> 01:13:10,885
You know what?
I get to wear a uniform.

1178
01:13:10,918 --> 01:13:12,387
- That's what's up.
- Luis.

1179
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:14,856
I'm sorry. I'm good. I'm good.
I'm just excited.

1180
01:13:14,889 --> 01:13:16,291
Plus,
your girlfriend's really hot.

1181
01:13:16,324 --> 01:13:17,659
So, you know,
that makes me nervous, too.

1182
01:13:17,692 --> 01:13:18,760
And you are very beautiful,
ma'am.

1183
01:13:18,793 --> 01:13:20,695
- Oh, my Lord.
- She's not my...

1184
01:13:20,728 --> 01:13:21,968
You know what?
I was thinking of

1185
01:13:21,996 --> 01:13:23,932
a tactic,
like when I go undercover.

1186
01:13:23,965 --> 01:13:25,133
Like a whistling. You know what I'm saying?
To like, blend in.

1187
01:13:25,166 --> 01:13:28,203
No.
Don't whistle. No whistling.

1188
01:13:28,236 --> 01:13:30,105
It's not The Andy Griffith Show.
No whistling.

1189
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:49,157
All clear in Sector One.

1190
01:13:54,295 --> 01:13:55,295
Step out.

1191
01:13:58,066 --> 01:13:59,234
All clear.

1192
01:14:04,972 --> 01:14:06,041
We're set.

1193
01:14:06,841 --> 01:14:07,976
Wish me luck.

1194
01:14:19,353 --> 01:14:21,156
Utilities online.

1195
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:36,071
Hey! What are you doing?

1196
01:14:36,104 --> 01:14:40,275
Uh... Boss-man said to secure the area,
so I'm securing it.

1197
01:14:41,909 --> 01:14:43,478
I'm the boss.

1198
01:14:43,511 --> 01:14:45,013
- Oh.
- Utilities 1.3...

1199
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:01,229
Water level is dropping!

1200
01:15:29,957 --> 01:15:31,826
Coming up on extraction pipe.

1201
01:15:31,859 --> 01:15:33,061
All right, I see it.

1202
01:15:41,435 --> 01:15:43,104
All right, come on,
I gotta get up there.

1203
01:15:43,137 --> 01:15:44,377
That's it.
That's it, guys! Yes!

1204
01:15:47,842 --> 01:15:50,779
Yes! You got it!
You got it! Come on!

1205
01:15:55,283 --> 01:15:56,451
All right,
let's fly, Ant-thony.

1206
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:10,298
The Ant-Man is
in the building.

1207
01:16:10,331 --> 01:16:13,034
Pym's pulling up.
Right on time.

1208
01:16:15,303 --> 01:16:17,172
Got a Crown Vic
right outside there.

1209
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:19,073
This is problem?

1210
01:16:19,106 --> 01:16:20,809
Considering the Crown Vic's
the most commonly used car

1211
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:21,842
for undercover cops, man,

1212
01:16:22,543 --> 01:16:23,945
yes, this is problem.

1213
01:16:27,982 --> 01:16:28,982
That's Pym.

1214
01:16:31,853 --> 01:16:33,288
Oh, no.

1215
01:16:33,321 --> 01:16:35,123
I'm
deploying the bullet ants.

1216
01:16:35,156 --> 01:16:37,926
Papanera Claire
de Merna Merna...

1217
01:16:37,959 --> 01:16:38,994
I don't remember what it's called,
but I feel bad for this guy.

1218
01:16:40,294 --> 01:16:41,463
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

1219
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:48,503
Ow! Ow!

1220
01:16:51,472 --> 01:16:52,941
See? That's what
I'm talking about.

1221
01:16:52,974 --> 01:16:55,109
That's what I call
an unfortunate casualty

1222
01:16:55,142 --> 01:16:57,145
in a very serious operation.

1223
01:17:06,387 --> 01:17:09,224
Signal decoy in place.

1224
01:17:09,257 --> 01:17:12,393
Mean,
pretty lady did good, Scott.

1225
01:17:12,426 --> 01:17:14,529
Looks like Pym's getting arrested.

1226
01:17:14,562 --> 01:17:16,531
Scott, we have problem.

1227
01:17:16,564 --> 01:17:18,266
Problem?
What's the problem?

1228
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:21,636
Dave! Dave,
that's not part of plan!

1229
01:17:21,669 --> 01:17:23,538
Listen to me.

1230
01:17:23,571 --> 01:17:27,142
If I don't get into this building,
people will die.

1231
01:17:28,042 --> 01:17:29,577
That's awfully dramatic.

1232
01:17:32,413 --> 01:17:33,515
Are you kidding me?

1233
01:17:38,152 --> 01:17:39,921
Problem solved.

1234
01:17:55,069 --> 01:17:56,071
Well...

1235
01:17:58,039 --> 01:17:59,474
How do I look?

1236
01:18:08,983 --> 01:18:09,985
There he is.

1237
01:18:11,619 --> 01:18:14,589
Just in time. Come on.

1238
01:18:24,298 --> 01:18:26,234
12-point verification.

1239
01:18:26,267 --> 01:18:28,269
Little over-the-top,
don't you think, Darren?

1240
01:18:28,302 --> 01:18:29,504
Confirming authorization level.

1241
01:18:29,537 --> 01:18:31,406
Well,
you can never be too safe.

1242
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:32,959
Access granted.

1243
01:18:40,147 --> 01:18:41,507
Gotta hand it to you, Darren.

1244
01:18:42,116 --> 01:18:44,319
You really did it.

1245
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:45,987
And you only know
the half of it, Hank.

1246
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:13,615
Arriving in second position.

1247
01:19:15,716 --> 01:19:17,585
All right, top speed,
Ant-thony. Let's go!

1248
01:19:28,796 --> 01:19:30,065
Proceeding to command position.

1249
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:49,484
I'll be right back, Ant-thony.

1250
01:19:51,385 --> 01:19:53,521
All right, guys.
I'm in position.

1251
01:19:53,554 --> 01:19:55,289
I'm gonna signal the ants.

1252
01:19:55,322 --> 01:19:57,759
No, no, no, no, no!

1253
01:19:59,093 --> 01:20:00,061
Did you see that?

1254
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:08,336
Assume formation.

1255
01:20:08,369 --> 01:20:10,304
All right,
you cute little crazies,

1256
01:20:10,337 --> 01:20:11,673
let's fry these servers!

1257
01:20:24,285 --> 01:20:26,154
Let's go get 'em, buddy!

1258
01:20:38,699 --> 01:20:39,734
Servers are fried.

1259
01:20:39,767 --> 01:20:42,236
Data backup completely erased.

1260
01:20:42,269 --> 01:20:43,789
Heading to the particle chamber.

1261
01:20:50,211 --> 01:20:51,813
Hello, Dr. Cross.

1262
01:20:56,183 --> 01:20:58,419
My associates have agreed
to your terms.

1263
01:20:58,452 --> 01:21:00,154
Wonderful.

1264
01:21:00,187 --> 01:21:02,790
Mr. Carson introduced me
to these fine gentlemen here.

1265
01:21:02,823 --> 01:21:04,459
They're
representatives of Hydra.

1266
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:05,693
They're not what they were.

1267
01:21:05,726 --> 01:21:08,229
They're doing some
interesting work.

1268
01:21:08,262 --> 01:21:11,432
And
I'm enjoying myself.

1269
01:21:11,465 --> 01:21:13,668
You tried to hide
your technology from me.

1270
01:21:13,701 --> 01:21:15,536
And now it's gonna
blow up in your face.

1271
01:21:19,406 --> 01:21:21,275
Wow.

1272
01:21:21,308 --> 01:21:25,279
Wow! I mean, I saw that punch coming
a mile away,

1273
01:21:25,312 --> 01:21:27,248
but I just figured it'd
be all pathetic and weak.

1274
01:21:27,281 --> 01:21:28,583
Well, you figured wrong.

1275
01:21:29,783 --> 01:21:31,119
I know this van.

1276
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,754
Anybody home?

1277
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:40,600
All right, guys. I'm here.

1278
01:21:45,332 --> 01:21:46,701
I'm setting the charges.

1279
01:22:05,619 --> 01:22:08,623
Great job, guys.
I'll take it from here.

1280
01:22:17,965 --> 01:22:20,535
Good boy, Ant-thony.

1281
01:22:21,502 --> 01:22:22,504
Final position.

1282
01:22:31,345 --> 01:22:33,681
Guys, how we looking
on that laser grid?

1283
01:22:33,714 --> 01:22:35,316
- Almost.
- No, you're not.

1284
01:22:35,349 --> 01:22:36,829
- I'm getting close!
- No, you're not.

1285
01:22:41,422 --> 01:22:42,957
San Francisco P.D.!

1286
01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:43,990
Out of the van!

1287
01:22:44,592 --> 01:22:45,626
I know you're in there!

1288
01:22:45,659 --> 01:22:46,761
Make it go faster.

1289
01:22:46,794 --> 01:22:47,795
Dude, seriously.

1290
01:22:53,534 --> 01:22:55,670
Ready to jump.
Do you read, Kurt?

1291
01:22:55,703 --> 01:22:57,638
So close.

1292
01:22:57,671 --> 01:22:59,273
- Okay, hold up! Wait a minute!
- Freeze!

1293
01:22:59,306 --> 01:23:01,242
There was a black guy
that looked exactly like me

1294
01:23:01,275 --> 01:23:02,877
who attacked us and put us
in the back of this disgusting van.

1295
01:23:02,910 --> 01:23:04,212
- Get out of the van!
- Okay, I'm coming.

1296
01:23:04,245 --> 01:23:06,280
Take it easy!

1297
01:23:06,313 --> 01:23:07,882
No, I will not move!
Go now!

1298
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:11,485
Wait!

1299
01:23:11,518 --> 01:23:12,718
What?
What do you mean, "Wait"?

1300
01:23:19,326 --> 01:23:20,328
Phew!

1301
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:23,831
What? What?

1302
01:23:25,532 --> 01:23:26,768
Hey, little guy.

1303
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:42,650
I always suspected you had
a suit stored away somewhere.

1304
01:23:42,683 --> 01:23:43,718
Which begs the question,

1305
01:23:43,751 --> 01:23:45,953
who is the new Ant-Man?

1306
01:23:45,986 --> 01:23:48,456
Who is the man
that my beloved mentor

1307
01:23:48,489 --> 01:23:50,391
trusted even more than me?

1308
01:23:52,626 --> 01:23:54,862
Scott Lang.

1309
01:23:56,330 --> 01:23:57,965
A martyr

1310
01:23:57,998 --> 01:24:00,501
who took on the system
and paid the price,

1311
01:24:00,534 --> 01:24:03,971
losing his family
and his only daughter in the process.

1312
01:24:04,004 --> 01:24:08,442
Exactly your
kind of guy, Hank!

1313
01:24:08,475 --> 01:24:12,880
He escapes his jail cell
without leaving any clue as to how.

1314
01:24:15,783 --> 01:24:17,252
And then he
disappears magically,

1315
01:24:18,619 --> 01:24:20,788
despite having no
money to his name.

1316
01:24:20,821 --> 01:24:23,291
And now he brings
me the Ant-Man suit.

1317
01:24:25,859 --> 01:24:29,463
The only thing that
can rival my creation.

1318
01:24:29,496 --> 01:24:32,967
Darren, don't do this.

1319
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,303
If you sell to these men,

1320
01:24:35,336 --> 01:24:36,637
it's gonna be chaos.

1321
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:38,306
I already have.

1322
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:39,640
And for twice the price,

1323
01:24:39,673 --> 01:24:41,942
thanks to you.

1324
01:24:41,975 --> 01:24:45,379
It's not easy to successfully infiltrate
an Avengers facility.

1325
01:24:45,412 --> 01:24:47,448
Thankfully, word travels fast.

1326
01:24:47,481 --> 01:24:49,417
I'll sell them
the Yellowjacket,

1327
01:24:49,450 --> 01:24:50,970
but I'm keeping
the particle to myself.

1328
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:53,788
They don't run on diesel.

1329
01:24:53,821 --> 01:24:56,491
If you want the fuel,
you'll have to come to me.

1330
01:24:57,658 --> 01:24:59,694
What do you call the only man

1331
01:24:59,727 --> 01:25:03,331
who can arm the most
powerful weapon in the world?

1332
01:25:03,364 --> 01:25:05,833
The most powerful
man in the world.

1333
01:25:05,866 --> 01:25:07,635
You proud of me yet?

1334
01:25:07,668 --> 01:25:10,738
You can stop this, Darren.
It's not too late.

1335
01:25:10,771 --> 01:25:14,075
It's been too late
for a long time now.

1336
01:25:15,442 --> 01:25:17,078
Darren!

1337
01:25:18,645 --> 01:25:20,581
What are you doing?

1338
01:25:20,614 --> 01:25:22,850
He wasn't any more capable of
caring for you than he was for me.

1339
01:25:22,883 --> 01:25:24,885
This is not who you are.

1340
01:25:24,918 --> 01:25:27,555
It's the particles altering
your brain chemistry.

1341
01:25:35,896 --> 01:25:37,998
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1342
01:25:39,867 --> 01:25:42,103
You're right. I have
to be the one to do it.

1343
01:25:44,938 --> 01:25:46,007
Here we go.

1344
01:25:47,608 --> 01:25:50,812
Drop your gun.

1345
01:25:53,614 --> 01:25:56,617
You know, I came to the house
the other night to kill him,

1346
01:25:56,650 --> 01:25:58,419
but you were there.

1347
01:25:58,452 --> 01:26:01,389
You're sick and I can help you.
Just put the gun down.

1348
01:26:01,422 --> 01:26:02,662
I wasn't ready
to kill you then,

1349
01:26:04,458 --> 01:26:05,526
but I think I am now!

1350
01:26:05,559 --> 01:26:07,895
Drop your gun now!

1351
01:26:07,928 --> 01:26:10,898
You picked
the wrong side, Hope.

1352
01:26:24,178 --> 01:26:25,380
Dad!

1353
01:26:34,054 --> 01:26:35,156
Hank, no.

1354
01:26:35,189 --> 01:26:37,792
No, Hank.

1355
01:26:37,825 --> 01:26:39,827
Hank?
Listen, you're gonna be okay.

1356
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:41,940
All right? You're gonna be just fine.

1357
01:26:42,930 --> 01:26:45,633
Take the suit off, or I'll blow
your brains out and peel it off.

1358
01:27:11,658 --> 01:27:13,594
We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech.

1359
01:27:13,627 --> 01:27:14,962
Request immediate backup!

1360
01:27:14,995 --> 01:27:16,063
Go, go, go!

1361
01:27:29,176 --> 01:27:31,111
Get me to the roof.

1362
01:27:31,144 --> 01:27:32,947
And radio ahead.

1363
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:35,149
I want to make sure the helicopter
is ready to take off.

1364
01:27:35,182 --> 01:27:36,717
You two,

1365
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:39,253
kill anything that
comes out of that vault!

1366
01:27:39,286 --> 01:27:42,457
Dad, can you move?

1367
01:27:44,825 --> 01:27:46,027
We need to get
him out of here.

1368
01:27:47,728 --> 01:27:49,964
Go get that suit.

1369
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,775
Hey, Scotty.

1370
01:28:34,808 --> 01:28:36,143
Hey, did I save your life?

1371
01:28:37,311 --> 01:28:38,646
Scotty?

1372
01:28:38,679 --> 01:28:40,548
Scotty?

1373
01:28:42,716 --> 01:28:44,151
Thank you, Luis.

1374
01:28:44,184 --> 01:28:45,786
- Are we the good guys?
- Yeah.

1375
01:28:45,819 --> 01:28:46,921
We're the good guys, right?

1376
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:47,994
Yeah, we're the good guys.

1377
01:28:48,822 --> 01:28:50,624
Feels kinda weird, you know.

1378
01:28:50,657 --> 01:28:52,793
Yeah, but we're not done yet.

1379
01:28:52,826 --> 01:28:54,662
Get out of here
before this place blows!

1380
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:04,639
Damn it! That guy.

1381
01:29:06,006 --> 01:29:08,142
Hey!
We're getting out of here!

1382
01:29:12,646 --> 01:29:14,114
The charges are set.

1383
01:29:14,147 --> 01:29:15,616
We've gotta find a way out of here.
And fast.

1384
01:29:15,649 --> 01:29:17,818
Don't worry.

1385
01:29:17,851 --> 01:29:20,254
I'm not gonna die.

1386
01:29:20,287 --> 01:29:21,756
And neither are you.

1387
01:29:22,823 --> 01:29:25,126
It's not a keychain.

1388
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:31,165
It's total chaos in here!
Multiple shots fired!

1389
01:29:42,175 --> 01:29:43,945
And there's a tank.

1390
01:29:53,687 --> 01:29:55,089
A little help!

1391
01:29:56,757 --> 01:29:57,757
I got it.

1392
01:29:58,692 --> 01:29:59,961
We need a doctor!

1393
01:30:01,228 --> 01:30:02,296
We've got him.

1394
01:30:04,431 --> 01:30:06,267
Thank you.

1395
01:30:07,801 --> 01:30:09,170
Let's go!

1396
01:30:25,252 --> 01:30:26,387
Ant-thony!

1397
01:30:39,966 --> 01:30:41,202
Go!

1398
01:30:42,703 --> 01:30:43,943
You're gonna regret that.

1399
01:30:54,214 --> 01:30:55,916
Wait a minute!
Get out of that van!

1400
01:30:55,949 --> 01:30:57,384
- What?
- Get out of that van!

1401
01:30:57,417 --> 01:30:59,297
It's too loud, there's a tank.
I can't hear you!

1402
01:31:00,387 --> 01:31:02,857
Hey! Hey!

1403
01:31:07,861 --> 01:31:09,997
Are you crazy?
Put the gun down!

1404
01:31:10,030 --> 01:31:11,332
The windows!

1405
01:31:16,236 --> 01:31:19,106
Did you think you could
stop the future with a heist?

1406
01:31:19,139 --> 01:31:20,419
It was never just a heist!

1407
01:31:42,896 --> 01:31:44,165
Put the gun down!

1408
01:31:52,973 --> 01:31:55,013
Okay, I got him, I got him.
There he is! Go, go, go!

1409
01:32:11,358 --> 01:32:13,194
We gotta set her
down somewhere.

1410
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:45,826
I'm gonna disintegrate you!

1411
01:32:45,859 --> 01:32:47,499
Playing Disintegration
by the Cure.

1412
01:33:25,866 --> 01:33:27,067
Call 911!

1413
01:33:45,452 --> 01:33:47,021
It's okay.

1414
01:33:51,658 --> 01:33:53,427
Freeze! Put your hands up!
Get them up!

1415
01:33:55,996 --> 01:33:57,231
Scott?

1416
01:33:57,264 --> 01:33:58,932
Paxton,
you have to listen to me!

1417
01:34:26,693 --> 01:34:29,196
Paxton, turn around!
Take me back!

1418
01:34:29,229 --> 01:34:31,265
I am taking you back.
To prison.

1419
01:34:31,298 --> 01:34:33,600
There's something in that backyard
that needs to be destroyed.

1420
01:34:33,633 --> 01:34:35,102
In the bug zapper. There...

1421
01:34:37,070 --> 01:34:40,140
You need to desist right now!
Your delusions are out of hand.

1422
01:34:40,173 --> 01:34:42,376
All units, we have a 2-36

1423
01:34:42,409 --> 01:34:44,344
in progress at
840 Winter Street.

1424
01:34:44,377 --> 01:34:46,046
- Cassie!
- That's my house.

1425
01:35:03,296 --> 01:35:04,398
Don't be scared.

1426
01:35:05,598 --> 01:35:06,700
Paxton, let me help!

1427
01:35:06,733 --> 01:35:07,968
Don't move.

1428
01:35:08,001 --> 01:35:09,236
Let me help!

1429
01:35:09,269 --> 01:35:10,103
Maggie! What's going on?

1430
01:35:10,136 --> 01:35:11,371
He's got Cassie!

1431
01:35:11,404 --> 01:35:13,106
- Who's got Cassie, honey?
- That thing.

1432
01:35:13,139 --> 01:35:15,259
- Thing?
- I don't know! I don't know!

1433
01:35:23,283 --> 01:35:24,518
Are you a monster?

1434
01:35:26,353 --> 01:35:28,289
Do I look like a monster?

1435
01:35:29,322 --> 01:35:30,591
I want my daddy!

1436
01:35:32,459 --> 01:35:34,227
I want your daddy, too.

1437
01:35:37,630 --> 01:35:38,732
There you are.

1438
01:35:38,765 --> 01:35:40,067
Daddy, is that you?

1439
01:35:41,768 --> 01:35:43,971
Hi, peanut.

1440
01:35:44,004 --> 01:35:45,724
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

1441
01:35:59,386 --> 01:36:01,722
Now,
where did you go, little guy?

1442
01:36:07,193 --> 01:36:08,261
There you are.

1443
01:36:12,265 --> 01:36:13,367
Not just me!

1444
01:36:24,144 --> 01:36:25,379
Damn it!

1445
01:36:26,079 --> 01:36:27,481
Go! Go!

1446
01:37:21,601 --> 01:37:23,303
Scotty needs us,
you know what I'm saying?

1447
01:37:23,336 --> 01:37:24,772
Ain't nothing gonna stop us.

1448
01:37:27,707 --> 01:37:29,076
Back it up.

1449
01:37:29,109 --> 01:37:30,143
Back it up, slow.

1450
01:37:30,176 --> 01:37:31,211
Yeah.

1451
01:37:31,244 --> 01:37:32,446
- Back it up.
- Yeah.

1452
01:37:32,479 --> 01:37:34,181
- Back it up.
- Okay.

1453
01:37:35,515 --> 01:37:36,817
- We just back it up, okay?
- That's it.

1454
01:37:36,850 --> 01:37:38,251
- Back it up.
- That's right.

1455
01:37:38,284 --> 01:37:39,719
Backin' up?

1456
01:37:39,752 --> 01:37:41,321
Yep, just backin' up.

1457
01:37:41,354 --> 01:37:42,554
No, no. Just back it up.

1458
01:37:49,295 --> 01:37:51,131
You insult me, Scott.

1459
01:37:55,635 --> 01:37:59,206
Your very existence
is insulting to me.

1460
01:38:01,241 --> 01:38:04,445
You know, it'd be much easier to hit you
if you were bigger.

1461
01:38:06,646 --> 01:38:07,748
Yeah, I agree.

1462
01:38:29,569 --> 01:38:30,571
Cassie!

1463
01:38:37,911 --> 01:38:41,348
I'm gonna show you
just how insignificant you are.

1464
01:38:42,515 --> 01:38:44,718
Cassie! I'm coming!

1465
01:38:57,730 --> 01:38:59,432
That's
a messed-up looking dog.

1466
01:38:59,465 --> 01:39:00,634
I'm gonna destroy

1467
01:39:00,667 --> 01:39:02,202
everything you love.

1468
01:39:03,836 --> 01:39:05,472
Freeze! S.F.P.D.

1469
01:39:13,413 --> 01:39:14,548
I can't break through.

1470
01:39:15,715 --> 01:39:17,551
It's titanium, you idiot!

1471
01:39:23,690 --> 01:39:25,626
- Get her out of here.
- Come on.

1472
01:39:26,826 --> 01:39:28,428
Sorry, sweetheart.

1473
01:39:28,461 --> 01:39:30,730
You have to help Daddy
pay for his mistakes.

1474
01:39:30,763 --> 01:39:32,365
- You stay behind me, okay?
- Okay.

1475
01:39:32,398 --> 01:39:33,398
Stay behind me.

1476
01:39:34,968 --> 01:39:37,637
I'm gonna have to shrink
between the molecules to get in there.

1477
01:39:37,670 --> 01:39:39,706
Get away from us!

1478
01:39:41,574 --> 01:39:42,642
Daddy, help!

1479
01:39:42,675 --> 01:39:44,244
I love you, Cassie.

1480
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:15,508
Daddy, where are you?

1481
01:40:17,310 --> 01:40:19,279
You could go subatomic.

1482
01:40:19,312 --> 01:40:20,314
You could go subatomic.

1483
01:40:21,381 --> 01:40:22,616
Oh, no.

1484
01:40:34,727 --> 01:40:37,397
You would enter a reality

1485
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:41,635
where all concepts
of time and space...

1486
01:40:41,668 --> 01:40:45,739
All concepts of time and space
become irrelevant.

1487
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:51,645
...all concepts of time and space
become irrelevant.

1488
01:40:55,948 --> 01:40:58,785
Come back, Daddy!

1489
01:40:58,818 --> 01:41:04,958
...as you shrink for all eternity.

1490
01:41:06,759 --> 01:41:09,429
Everything that you know

1491
01:41:11,364 --> 01:41:12,899
and love,

1492
01:41:14,334 --> 01:41:16,670
gone forever.

1493
01:41:16,703 --> 01:41:17,903
Daddy, where are you?

1494
01:41:36,489 --> 01:41:37,489
Where are you?

1495
01:41:40,393 --> 01:41:41,628
Where are you?

1496
01:41:42,829 --> 01:41:44,631
- Daddy!
- Cassie.

1497
01:41:52,505 --> 01:41:53,874
Come back, Daddy!

1498
01:41:58,378 --> 01:42:00,614
Do not screw
with the regulator!

1499
01:42:31,177 --> 01:42:32,846
Daddy!

1500
01:42:36,449 --> 01:42:37,851
I love you so much.

1501
01:42:38,551 --> 01:42:39,720
I love you, too.

1502
01:42:40,186 --> 01:42:41,521
So much.

1503
01:42:46,058 --> 01:42:47,658
You know, there's
a big hole in the roof.

1504
01:42:50,663 --> 01:42:51,865
Sorry.

1505
01:42:54,834 --> 01:42:56,603
- Is she all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.

1506
01:42:58,671 --> 01:42:59,673
Mommy!

1507
01:43:02,775 --> 01:43:03,977
She's fine, she's fine.

1508
01:43:13,753 --> 01:43:15,755
Scott, please.

1509
01:43:15,788 --> 01:43:17,724
You don't remember anything?

1510
01:43:17,757 --> 01:43:18,958
Hank. I don't.

1511
01:43:18,991 --> 01:43:21,395
There must be something else.

1512
01:43:23,095 --> 01:43:26,466
Well, I suppose the human mind

1513
01:43:26,499 --> 01:43:28,969
just can't
comprehend the experience,

1514
01:43:31,070 --> 01:43:32,406
but you made it.

1515
01:43:33,072 --> 01:43:34,674
You went in,

1516
01:43:36,075 --> 01:43:37,778
and you got out.

1517
01:43:39,979 --> 01:43:41,581
It's amazing.

1518
01:43:42,482 --> 01:43:44,083
Scott,

1519
01:43:44,116 --> 01:43:46,019
I'll walk you out.

1520
01:43:49,989 --> 01:43:51,491
Get some rest.

1521
01:43:59,765 --> 01:44:01,935
Is it possible?

1522
01:44:20,019 --> 01:44:21,120
When did this happen?

1523
01:44:21,153 --> 01:44:22,722
Nothing's happening.

1524
01:44:22,755 --> 01:44:24,824
Whoa. Hold on.
Something's kind of happening.

1525
01:44:24,857 --> 01:44:26,759
Well, if that's the case,

1526
01:44:26,792 --> 01:44:28,828
shoot me again.

1527
01:44:28,861 --> 01:44:30,029
Yeah. I don't know
what you were doing,

1528
01:44:30,062 --> 01:44:31,498
grabbing and
kissing me like that.

1529
01:44:31,531 --> 01:44:33,500
I'm a little surprised myself.

1530
01:44:33,533 --> 01:44:35,768
I have to get somewhere.
I'll see you later, Hank.

1531
01:44:35,801 --> 01:44:37,037
Really, Hope.

1532
01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:40,006
- Scott.
- Yeah?

1533
01:44:40,039 --> 01:44:41,808
- You're full of shit.
- Oh, yeah.

1534
01:44:43,209 --> 01:44:45,578
Scott,
I met with my captain today.

1535
01:44:45,611 --> 01:44:48,715
He wanted a report on the night
that you got out of jail.

1536
01:44:48,748 --> 01:44:50,148
Something happened
with the cameras.

1537
01:44:50,716 --> 01:44:52,886
Some circuits got fried.

1538
01:44:54,220 --> 01:44:56,523
But I told him that
you were processed correctly.

1539
01:44:56,556 --> 01:44:57,724
Really?

1540
01:44:57,757 --> 01:44:58,959
Well, yeah.

1541
01:45:01,060 --> 01:45:03,730
Can't be sending Cassie's dad
back to jail on a technical glitch, right?

1542
01:45:03,763 --> 01:45:05,798
Thank you, Paxton.

1543
01:45:05,831 --> 01:45:08,234
I'm blown away.

1544
01:45:08,267 --> 01:45:09,903
Thank you for everything
you do for Cassie.

1545
01:45:09,936 --> 01:45:11,972
Well, that's my pleasure.

1546
01:45:13,205 --> 01:45:16,142
But, no.
This one, I did for you.

1547
01:45:18,578 --> 01:45:19,846
- This is awkward.
- Yeah.

1548
01:45:19,879 --> 01:45:20,897
Yeah.

1549
01:45:21,948 --> 01:45:23,249
I mean, what do we even talk about
after all of that?

1550
01:45:23,282 --> 01:45:24,918
- Oh, I know.
- What?

1551
01:45:24,951 --> 01:45:26,085
I did my first
cartwheel today.

1552
01:45:26,118 --> 01:45:27,554
What?

1553
01:45:27,587 --> 01:45:30,023
Yeah. She has been
practicing all week.

1554
01:45:30,056 --> 01:45:31,724
But today was the magic day.

1555
01:45:31,757 --> 01:45:32,997
I recorded it on my phone.
Here.

1556
01:45:34,660 --> 01:45:36,863
No, that can't be Cassie.
That's not you.

1557
01:45:36,896 --> 01:45:38,831
- Yeah, it is.
- Yeah, it is.

1558
01:45:38,864 --> 01:45:40,733
This is a professional gymnast.
There is no way that's you.

1559
01:45:40,766 --> 01:45:41,766
Yeah, that's her.

1560
01:45:42,635 --> 01:45:44,037
Good boy.

1561
01:45:46,138 --> 01:45:48,908
Sweetie, that's
pretty amazing, peanut.

1562
01:45:51,811 --> 01:45:52,812
Sorry.

1563
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:56,216
It's work.

1564
01:45:56,882 --> 01:45:58,118
Yeah.

1565
01:45:59,852 --> 01:46:01,087
All right.

1566
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:02,922
Here's the deal.
Just give me the facts.

1567
01:46:02,955 --> 01:46:04,090
Just the facts.
Only the facts.

1568
01:46:04,123 --> 01:46:08,261
Breathe.
Focus. Keep it simple.

1569
01:46:08,294 --> 01:46:10,063
No, no, no.
No doubt, no doubt. Okay.

1570
01:46:10,096 --> 01:46:12,765
So, I'm at this art museum
with my cousin Ignacio, right?

1571
01:46:12,798 --> 01:46:15,602
And there was this, like,
abstract expressionism exhibit.

1572
01:46:15,635 --> 01:46:18,237
But you know me, I'm more
like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right?

1573
01:46:18,270 --> 01:46:19,639
But there was this one Rothko
that was sublime, bro! Oh, my God!

1574
01:46:19,672 --> 01:46:20,807
Luis.

1575
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:22,075
Okay, sorry. Sorry.

1576
01:46:22,108 --> 01:46:23,943
You know,
I just get excited and stuff.

1577
01:46:23,976 --> 01:46:26,179
But anyway, Ignacio tells me,

1578
01:46:26,212 --> 01:46:28,081
"Yo, I met this
crazy-fine writer chick

1579
01:46:28,114 --> 01:46:29,882
"at the Spot last night.
Like fine-fine.

1580
01:46:29,915 --> 01:46:31,351
"Like crazy-stupid fine."
And he

1581
01:46:31,384 --> 01:46:33,720
"goes up to
the bartender and goes,

1582
01:46:33,753 --> 01:46:35,321
"Look at the girl I'm with.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1583
01:46:35,354 --> 01:46:37,657
"She's
crazy-stupid fine, right?"

1584
01:46:37,690 --> 01:46:39,292
The bartender's all like,
"Yeah, crazy-stupid fine."

1585
01:46:39,325 --> 01:46:42,028
So this writer
chick tells Ignacio,

1586
01:46:42,061 --> 01:46:44,263
"Yo, I'm like a boss
in the world of guerrilla journalism,

1587
01:46:44,296 --> 01:46:45,698
"and I got mad connects
with the peeps behind the curtains,

1588
01:46:45,731 --> 01:46:46,933
"you know what I'm saying?"

1589
01:46:46,966 --> 01:46:48,835
Ignacio's like, "For real?"

1590
01:46:48,868 --> 01:46:50,670
And she's like,
"Yeah, you know what,

1591
01:46:50,703 --> 01:46:52,372
I can't tell you
who my contact is,

1592
01:46:52,405 --> 01:46:53,039
"because he works
with the Avengers."

1593
01:46:53,072 --> 01:46:54,641
Oh, no.

1594
01:46:54,674 --> 01:46:55,875
Yeah, and this dude sounds
like a badass, man.

1595
01:46:55,908 --> 01:46:57,844
Like,
he comes up to her and says,

1596
01:46:57,877 --> 01:46:59,245
"Yo, I'm looking for this dude
who's new on the scene,

1597
01:46:59,278 --> 01:47:01,347
"who's flashing
his fresh tack,

1598
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:03,082
"who's got, like, bomb moves, right?
Who you got?"

1599
01:47:03,115 --> 01:47:04,717
And she's like,
"Well, we got everything

1600
01:47:04,750 --> 01:47:07,320
nowadays.
We got a guy who jumps.

1601
01:47:07,353 --> 01:47:08,788
"We got a guy who swings,
we got a guy who crawls up the walls.

1602
01:47:08,821 --> 01:47:11,190
"You gotta be more specific."

1603
01:47:11,223 --> 01:47:12,692
And he's like,
"I'm looking for a guy that shrinks."

1604
01:47:12,725 --> 01:47:13,993
And I'm, like, "Damn!"
I got all nervous

1605
01:47:14,026 --> 01:47:15,662
'cause I'd keep mad
secrets for you, bro.

1606
01:47:15,695 --> 01:47:17,730
So I asked Ignacio,

1607
01:47:17,763 --> 01:47:19,332
"Did the badass tell
the stupid-fine writer chick

1608
01:47:19,365 --> 01:47:21,034
"to tell you to tell me,
because I'm tight with Ant-Man,

1609
01:47:21,067 --> 01:47:22,268
"that he's looking for him?"

1610
01:47:22,935 --> 01:47:25,305
And? What'd he say?

1611
01:47:28,774 --> 01:47:30,210
He said, "Yes."

1612
01:49:25,291 --> 01:49:27,393
There's something
I want to show you.

1613
01:49:29,995 --> 01:49:33,032
I realized you
can't destroy power.

1614
01:49:34,967 --> 01:49:38,471
All you can do is make sure
that it's in the right hands.

1615
01:49:45,377 --> 01:49:47,580
This is an advanced prototype

1616
01:49:47,613 --> 01:49:50,283
that your mother and I
worked on together.

1617
01:49:52,051 --> 01:49:55,388
She never got to use it.

1618
01:49:55,421 --> 01:49:59,392
But now I realize that we were...
We were working on it for you.

1619
01:50:06,432 --> 01:50:08,568
Maybe it's time
we finished it.

1620
01:50:15,407 --> 01:50:17,844
It's about damn time.

1621
01:56:18,370 --> 01:56:19,539
Hey, Cap!

1622
01:56:32,951 --> 01:56:36,522
This would have
been a lot easier a week ago.

1623
01:56:36,555 --> 01:56:38,324
- If we call Tony...
- He won't believe us.

1624
01:56:38,357 --> 01:56:39,692
Even if he did...

1625
01:56:39,725 --> 01:56:41,405
Who knows if the Accords
will let him help.

1626
01:56:42,661 --> 01:56:44,230
We're on our own.

1627
01:56:45,597 --> 01:56:46,732
Maybe not.

1628
01:56:49,434 --> 01:56:50,570
I know a guy.
