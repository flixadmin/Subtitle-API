1
00:00:27,758 --> 00:00:30,383
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

2
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,717
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:32,717 --> 00:00:34,508
Excuse me. Coming through.

4
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:38,342
<i>Tonight, so-called</i>
<i>magician Lionel Shrike</i>

5
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:40,842
<i>is making another sad</i>
<i>attempt for attention</i>

6
00:00:40,842 --> 00:00:44,383
<i>by performing what he calls</i>
<i>an impossible feat.</i>

7
00:00:44,383 --> 00:00:47,717
<i>The safe is made of</i>
<i>the strongest iron.</i>

8
00:00:47,717 --> 00:00:50,883
<i>It can't be sawed</i>
<i>through or pried.</i>

9
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:55,383
<i>Yet, Lionel Shrike thinks</i>
<i>he's able to escape.</i>

10
00:00:55,383 --> 00:00:57,342
Dad! Dad!

11
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:00,050
Hey, buddy.

12
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,925
You made it?

13
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:05,508
Now, see that seat there?

14
00:01:05,508 --> 00:01:11,383
Is Lionel Shrike
the kind of magician
who can pull this off?

15
00:01:11,383 --> 00:01:14,383
<i>Or is he actually</i>
<i>in over his head?</i>

16
00:01:14,383 --> 00:01:15,883
We'll see about that.

17
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:17,050
What's the matter?

18
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,425
I don't want you to go.

19
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:20,633
Dylan, come on.
We talked about this.

20
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:22,925
Remember?
This is what I do.

21
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:25,592
I got to prove all
those naysayers wrong.

22
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:28,508
Okay? Besides...

23
00:01:28,508 --> 00:01:31,592
I always keep
something up my sleeve.

24
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,717
Now, got your watch
like your dad's?

25
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:36,383
Okay. How many seconds?

26
00:01:36,383 --> 00:01:37,842
300.

27
00:01:37,842 --> 00:01:39,508
300. Maybe a few less.

28
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,342
I love you so much.

29
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:49,883
Okay.
See you later, big man.

30
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:54,675
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>- Lionel Shrike!</i>

31
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,300
Will he be able
to hold his breath?

32
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,925
<i>Will he be able to</i>
<i>somehow escape the safe?</i>

33
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:07,675
Three, two, one...

34
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,550
Two, three,

35
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,050
four, five, six,
seven, eight...

36
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:22,050
296...

37
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,342
297, 298, 299, 300.

38
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:33,383
303, 304...

39
00:02:34,383 --> 00:02:35,467
<i>It's five minutes now,</i>

40
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:41,508
<i>and we have not</i>
<i>seen or heard anything</i>
<i>from Lionel Shrike yet.</i>

41
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:42,717
Move!

42
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:45,050
Dad!

43
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:48,883
Dad! Dad!

44
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:52,300
Let go of me!

45
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:54,342
Dad!

46
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,592
No! Dad!

47
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:00,508
Dad! Let go!

48
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,800
Find him!

49
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:24,300
<i>The Eye.</i>

50
00:03:24,883 --> 00:03:26,883
<i>It may not lie...</i>

51
00:03:26,883 --> 00:03:30,550
<i>But don't think for a moment</i>
<i>that it can't be lied to.</i>

52
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,050
<i>Seeing is believing.</i>

53
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,050
<i>But is it truth?</i>

54
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,508
<i>People see the Horsemen</i>
<i>as noble Robin Hoods.</i>

55
00:03:40,508 --> 00:03:41,675
<i>Are they?</i>

56
00:03:41,675 --> 00:03:44,883
<i>Or are they common thieves?</i>

57
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:46,383
<i>Depends on your point of view.</i>

58
00:03:47,508 --> 00:03:52,717
<i>They robbed a bank in Paris</i>
<i>from a stage in Las Vegas.</i>

59
00:03:52,717 --> 00:03:54,425
<i>They fleeced</i>
<i>an insurance magnate</i>

60
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:55,967
<i>of hundreds of</i>
<i>millions of dollars</i>

61
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:58,717
<i>and disappeared from</i>
<i>a roof in New York.</i>

62
00:03:58,717 --> 00:04:02,925
<i>Always showering their</i>
<i>devoted fans with money.</i>

63
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:04,883
<i>Here's what you don't know.</i>

64
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:07,050
<i>They left one man behind.</i>

65
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,008
<i>Framed. Holding the bag.</i>

66
00:04:09,842 --> 00:04:10,883
<i>Me.</i>

67
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,633
<i>Are you listening, Horsemen?</i>

68
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:17,842
<i>When you emerge,</i>
<i>and you will...</i>

69
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,925
<i>I will be there waiting.</i>

70
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:24,383
<i>Because mark my words,</i>

71
00:04:24,383 --> 00:04:27,383
<i>you will get</i>
<i>what's coming to you.</i>

72
00:04:27,383 --> 00:04:29,758
<i>In ways you can't expect.</i>

73
00:04:30,758 --> 00:04:33,383
<i>But very much deserve.</i>

74
00:04:33,383 --> 00:04:36,383
<i>Because one thing</i>
<i>I believe in</i>

75
00:04:36,383 --> 00:04:39,675
<i>is any eye for an eye.</i>

76
00:05:56,842 --> 00:05:58,758
<i>Welcome, Daniel Atlas.</i>

77
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:01,050
Who am I speaking to?

78
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:04,592
I asked to see the face
behind all of this.

79
00:06:05,842 --> 00:06:07,717
<i>You've asked many questions.</i>

80
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:10,300
<i>And registered</i>
<i>many complaints.</i>

81
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,383
<i>You can rest assured</i>
<i>that we've heard you.</i>

82
00:06:12,383 --> 00:06:13,883
Have you? Because I don't...

83
00:06:13,883 --> 00:06:15,383
<i>Trust?</i>
<i>No.</i>

84
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:18,050
<i>Your leader?</i>
<i>Your fellow Horsemen?</i>

85
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,717
I don't like
that we've been living
in hiding for a year.

86
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,925
I don't like
that every message
I get from Dylan is,

87
00:06:25,925 --> 00:06:27,467
"Wait. Be patient.

88
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:28,717
"The Eye has a plan."

89
00:06:28,717 --> 00:06:31,050
<i>Wait. Be patient.</i>

90
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,508
<i>The Eye has a plan.</i>

91
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:35,550
This is games and
it's not working for me.

92
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,050
<i>You feel it is you</i>
<i>who should be leading</i>
<i>the Horsemen,</i>

93
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,550
<i>not Dylan.</i>

94
00:06:42,383 --> 00:06:43,633
<i>If that is</i>
<i>what you desire,</i>

95
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:46,008
<i>stay the course.</i>

96
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:48,050
<i>Trust that</i>
<i>your unique talents</i>

97
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,967
<i>and remarkable mind</i>
<i>will not go unrecognized.</i>

98
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:54,717
<i>We have a new mission</i>
<i>for the Horsemen.</i>

99
00:06:54,717 --> 00:06:57,842
<i>Dylan has a plan</i>
<i>and will gather</i>
<i>you together soon.</i>

100
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:00,675
<i>Now leave!</i>

101
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:16,967
...North Carolina,
Florida, Maryland, Maine.

102
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:19,550
We're talking the entire
eastern seaboard.

103
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,508
I need to see some results.

104
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,425
Hey. Sorry.

105
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:25,508
Just real quick.
Can I have you for
a couple of minutes?

106
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:26,758
I'm right in the middle
of something, Dylan.

107
00:07:26,758 --> 00:07:28,717
No, I know. It's okay.
Hey. Hey, everybody. Sorry.

108
00:07:28,717 --> 00:07:30,925
Sorry about that.

109
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:32,342
Call the mayor.

110
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:34,717
Thanks a lot.
Twins? Good.

111
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,925
Is he coming?

112
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:39,050
Look, I wouldn't
have brought you
out of that meeting

113
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,717
unless it was
something important.

114
00:07:40,717 --> 00:07:43,050
It's about
the Horsemen.

115
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,425
Something's happening here
and it's happening now.

116
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,050
Message boards.
Elite magic society.

117
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,675
There is chatter going on
about the Horsemen

118
00:07:51,675 --> 00:07:54,508
and something happening
with Octa, the giant
software company.

119
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:56,008
I know what Octa is.

120
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,842
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but two months ago

121
00:07:57,842 --> 00:07:59,342
we sent men
to Philadelphia
because he knew...

122
00:07:59,342 --> 00:08:00,425
And I said
that I was wrong.

123
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:02,050
He knew that
the Horsemen

124
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,050
were going to hit
the Euro-Atlantic
Banking Summit.

125
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,342
I have proof.

126
00:08:04,342 --> 00:08:05,717
Let him talk.
Thank you.

127
00:08:05,717 --> 00:08:07,342
Communications.

128
00:08:07,342 --> 00:08:11,383
Contact between who I think
might be Daniel Atlas

129
00:08:11,383 --> 00:08:14,008
and who may be
Merritt McKinney.

130
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:16,050
And what do you have?
Emails? Cell phones?

131
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,550
Any transcripts?

132
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,717
Pigeons.
What?

133
00:08:19,717 --> 00:08:22,050
I'm sorry,
you mean stool pigeons?

134
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,800
No, I mean
actual pigeon pigeons.
Like carrier pigeons.

135
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,383
Okay? Magicians work

136
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:27,842
with pigeons.
Doves.

137
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,467
Stay with me.

138
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:33,675
This pigeon,
right here...

139
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:36,425
There's Daniel Atlas.
Same pigeon.

140
00:08:36,425 --> 00:08:37,550
East Village.

141
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,300
Same pigeon, West Village.

142
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,967
42nd Street, pigeon.
65th Street.

143
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:44,925
All the way up to the
George Washington Bridge

144
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:47,467
on a sail boat
with a guy

145
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:49,675
that looks just
like Merritt McKinney.

146
00:08:49,675 --> 00:08:51,050
And what does
this all mean?

147
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,383
I know
what it means.

148
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:53,675
It means nothing.
It's bullshit.

149
00:08:53,675 --> 00:08:55,508
Could you
sing a new song?
No.

150
00:08:55,508 --> 00:08:57,550
How is it that
two years ago
you were so close...

151
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,050
You think I went
out of my way to screw up
my own investigation?

152
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:04,342
but you want everybody
else to think that
you're an idiot.

153
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:06,383
Okay, stop.

154
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:09,467
Cowan, I know I'm new here,
but as far as I can tell,

155
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:11,758
people who don't
even know you,
think you're an asshole.

156
00:09:12,675 --> 00:09:16,758
You don't know me,
but my first year
in the Academy,

157
00:09:16,758 --> 00:09:18,050
you gave a talk.

158
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,883
The "long game"
you called it.

159
00:09:19,883 --> 00:09:22,675
You talked about
a moral compass.

160
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:24,883
About how you believed
in yours immutably.

161
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:29,050
And I thought to myself,
"That guy.

162
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,008
"One day,
I want to be that guy."

163
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:36,342
And now... A pigeon?

164
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,550
Technically, it was
a few pigeons, but I hear
what you're saying.

165
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,050
Okay.
So here's what
I'm going to do.

166
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,633
You want to take
a vacation day?

167
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:46,592
But I'm not going
to devote resources
to another snipe hunt.

168
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:49,758
I came to clean this mess up,
not add to it. I'm sorry.

169
00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:50,883
Boss, thank you.

170
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:53,425
I promise you,
it won't be a snipe hunt.

171
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:55,800
We're gonna get
those Horsemen.

172
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,925
She's great.

173
00:09:56,925 --> 00:09:58,717
The problem is

174
00:09:58,717 --> 00:10:00,342
when you're two people
at the same time,

175
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:01,758
one of them is bound
to trip the other.

176
00:10:01,758 --> 00:10:03,425
And when that happens,

177
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:05,050
I will be there.

178
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:06,883
Duly noted.

179
00:10:28,342 --> 00:10:29,883
Hi!
Who are you?

180
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:31,717
What are you doing in my...
It's actually
a funny story.

181
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:33,425
How did you get
into my apartment?
Whoa!

182
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,717
I think it's funny.
It's not like funny "ha ha."

183
00:10:35,717 --> 00:10:37,883
Or you might not think
that it's funny "ha ha."

184
00:10:37,883 --> 00:10:40,383
I think it's funny.
I guess it's all
kind of relative.

185
00:10:40,383 --> 00:10:42,383
I was actually...
No, that's not...

186
00:10:42,383 --> 00:10:44,592
I made myself in
the neighborhood
and now I'm here,

187
00:10:44,592 --> 00:10:45,883
and maybe...

188
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:49,883
Okay.

189
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,717
Seriously,
how did you
get in here?

190
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,717
Are you some kind
of crazed fan
or something?

191
00:10:53,717 --> 00:10:55,717
My God.
No, no, no,
I recognize you.

192
00:10:55,717 --> 00:10:57,467
You did that B-grade

193
00:10:57,467 --> 00:10:58,883
"geek magic" thing,
didn't you?
You pulled a...

194
00:10:58,883 --> 00:11:00,050
Pulled a hat
out of the rabbit.

195
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,467
A hat out of the rabbit,
that's right.

196
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:02,633
I know
that it didn't work.

197
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:03,758
No, it was actually
kind of disgusting.

198
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:08,717
Well, your drop was obvious
and your body shell is flimsy.

199
00:11:08,717 --> 00:11:09,967
So if you wouldn't mind

200
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:12,300
crawling out from
under my couch and...

201
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,550
Ta-da! Now I'm sitting
over here. Crazy!

202
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,508
By the way,
that rabbit thing?

203
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:22,342
That was eight
years ago, okay?

204
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:23,967
I've gotten so much
better since then.

205
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:25,717
Have you?
Yeah.

206
00:11:25,717 --> 00:11:26,967
Okay, come here.
What is it
that you want?

207
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:28,675
I wanted to meet you.
Everybody, really.

208
00:11:28,675 --> 00:11:30,508
I want to be a part
of the Eye, okay?

209
00:11:30,508 --> 00:11:33,550
I said it. I do.
And I want to use
my magic for good,

210
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,883
like you and Merritt
and Jack especially.

211
00:11:36,883 --> 00:11:38,967
That's right.
I know that Jack is alive.

212
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:40,425
I know that he
faked his own death.

213
00:11:40,425 --> 00:11:41,758
I am a huge fan
of faking deaths.

214
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:43,383
That was crazy!

215
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:44,883
What is this?
A trucker's hitch?

216
00:11:44,883 --> 00:11:46,758
Yeah.
It's terrible.

217
00:11:46,758 --> 00:11:48,883
Embarrassing.
Okay.

218
00:11:48,883 --> 00:11:51,925
By the way,
I am so sorry
that Henley left you.

219
00:11:51,925 --> 00:11:53,842
- God!
- Sorry.

220
00:11:53,842 --> 00:11:55,342
That's actually
a little better.

221
00:11:55,342 --> 00:11:56,508
You know what I heard?

222
00:11:56,508 --> 00:12:00,383
I heard that
she got tired
of waiting around.

223
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,842
She lost faith
and so she asked
for an out,

224
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:04,800
and the Eye
gave it to her.

225
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,050
But who knows, right?

226
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:08,300
In matters of the heart,
so difficult to tell.

227
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,550
I mean, maybe she got
sick of you.

228
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,717
You ever think
about that?

229
00:12:10,717 --> 00:12:13,925
Maybe you just
didn't tie her up
tight enough.!

230
00:12:13,925 --> 00:12:15,508
Here's what's
going to happen.

231
00:12:15,508 --> 00:12:17,800
You're going to stay
here and stop talking,

232
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,425
and I'm going to
make a phone call,

233
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:21,758
and in about five minutes,
some people are going...

234
00:12:28,342 --> 00:12:30,508
It's all in the wrist.

235
00:12:30,508 --> 00:12:33,592
Let the momentum
of the card
do the work for you.

236
00:12:34,758 --> 00:12:36,717
This last one
I call the Stall.

237
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,008
Not bad.

238
00:12:41,008 --> 00:12:42,717
Now you want to see
a thing of beauty?

239
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:44,550
I do indeed.
Here you go.

240
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,800
And bingo bango bongo.

241
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:51,550
No, no, no,
it's good
to be positive

242
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,050
despite making zero
progress in a year.

243
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,342
Yeah.

244
00:12:54,342 --> 00:12:56,342
Whereas when it
comes to hypnotism,

245
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,675
the student has almost
become the master.

246
00:12:58,675 --> 00:13:00,883
I like your confidence,

247
00:13:00,883 --> 00:13:03,425
but you might say that
you have the better teacher.

248
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:04,550
Ooh!
Yeah.

249
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,050
Your teacher
definitely doesn't know
what he's doing.

250
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,050
By the way, was this
your card yesterday?

251
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,383
In fact it was.

252
00:13:11,383 --> 00:13:12,592
I thought so.

253
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,342
That's not bad.

254
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,717
If I can hypnotize Danny
before you hit him
with a card,

255
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,050
I get top bunk
for a week.

256
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,050
Okay, that's a deal.

257
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,717
Stare at the palm
of your hand and as
your eyes change focus,

258
00:13:28,717 --> 00:13:30,008
you will begin
to notice...

259
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:34,383
It's not working.
Please don't become him.

260
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:35,967
I didn't know you guys
did party tricks

261
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:37,758
when there weren't
floozies around
to impress.

262
00:13:37,758 --> 00:13:40,050
I think we stopped
trying to impress floozies

263
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,425
in, like, 1937.

264
00:13:42,425 --> 00:13:44,550
Okay, somebody broke
into my apartment,
all right?

265
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,383
Some amateur who knew
everything about me,

266
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:47,675
everything about
Henley leaving,

267
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:48,883
and everything about us.

268
00:13:48,883 --> 00:13:50,008
That's her.

269
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:51,717
Hey!

270
00:13:51,717 --> 00:13:52,842
Hi.

271
00:13:52,842 --> 00:13:53,967
You met Lula.

272
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:56,633
I've met her.
What is she doing here?

273
00:13:56,633 --> 00:13:58,550
I'm the new Horseman!

274
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:01,675
I'm the girl Horseman.

275
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,383
Whoo!

276
00:14:03,383 --> 00:14:04,550
Yeah!

277
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,717
Nobody.
No excitement.

278
00:14:06,717 --> 00:14:08,050
Jack? Anything?

279
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,050
Dylan, tell me
what's going on here.

280
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,800
Well, Lula's been on
the underground scene
for the last decade,

281
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,550
and I think she
has some real talent,

282
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,633
and I'd like to
try her on stage

283
00:14:18,633 --> 00:14:20,800
to balance out the duo.
What?

284
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,758
No, are you serious, man?

285
00:14:22,758 --> 00:14:24,383
After Henley left,
you said I could
get back on stage again.

286
00:14:24,383 --> 00:14:25,758
Not someone who
just showed up.

287
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:29,925
and I really need you
behind the scenes with me
for a little while longer.

288
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:32,342
Dylan, come on.
I've been behind
the scenes my whole life.

289
00:14:32,342 --> 00:14:34,842
Which is a crime,
might I add. Have you
seen that man's face?

290
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,925
the addition
of some femininity
to the group,

291
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:42,383
over and above
what Atlas provides...

292
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,717
I think the real issue
is we've been in this...

293
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,050
Yeah, the issue
is that we have been
rehearsing for months

294
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,883
for something...
We don't even
know what it is.

295
00:14:49,883 --> 00:14:50,967
And you're going to
keep working until...

296
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:52,050
Until we work as
a single organism.

297
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,342
I know, I've heard
you say that.

298
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:57,342
I think what
you're referring to
is us, not you.

299
00:14:57,342 --> 00:14:59,633
Listen, I'm getting
my orders directly
from the Eye.

300
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:01,300
Okay? And then
I give them to you.

301
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,717
Now, if you don't like that,
you're welcome to go.

302
00:15:02,717 --> 00:15:04,008
No, I'm not going anywhere.
But I'm...

303
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:06,883
Guys, can I
just weigh in here
really quickly?

304
00:15:06,883 --> 00:15:08,550
Because I think I see
what's going on here.

305
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,467
You guys are this amazing,
tight-knit family unit.

306
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:13,800
I'm a new person...
We are anything
but a family.

307
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,758
Okay, well, my mother

308
00:15:15,758 --> 00:15:17,883
literally knifed my father
in the neck one time.

309
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,925
So you are actually
a little bit like
my family unit.

310
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:21,383
Literally?
But, yeah.

311
00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:23,383
It was an accident,
I think.

312
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:26,508
Okay. So, does this mean
we're actually going
to do something?

313
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,633
Yes.

314
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:33,050
You've all heard of Octa
and their playboy CEO,
Owen Case.

315
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,717
His partner, Walter Mabry,
died about a year ago.

316
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:37,050
You wanna know
what all this has
been leading to?

317
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,717
Octa's hosting the launch
of the next-gen cell phone.

318
00:15:40,717 --> 00:15:42,675
Once these phones
hit the streets,

319
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,592
they'll siphon
their users' information
to the black market.

320
00:15:45,592 --> 00:15:49,383
Meaning Octa's
selling privacy
to up their profit.

321
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:52,383
So, the Eye has decided
to expose them for it.

322
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:54,550
Our mission
is to hijack the show.

323
00:15:55,342 --> 00:15:57,383
Rehearsal's over, guys.

324
00:15:57,383 --> 00:15:58,967
This is what we've
been waiting for.

325
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:00,550
Now it's time
to get to work.

326
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,842
<i>Welcome, Octa insiders,</i>

327
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:14,925
<i>We're delighted that you've</i>
<i>joined us to participate</i>
<i>in our special event.</i>

328
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:16,800
<i>Today marks the beginning</i>

329
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,967
<i>of a bright new journey</i>
<i>in social networking.</i>

330
00:16:18,967 --> 00:16:20,717
<i>Our latest product,</i>
<i>Octa 8...</i>

331
00:16:20,717 --> 00:16:22,883
Keys, cell phones,
iPads, in the bin.

332
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:25,550
Thank you, sir.

333
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:30,050
Can't have you texting,
tweeting, recording,
or eating.

334
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,800
Sorry, we will
take very good care
of it for you.

335
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:35,633
By the way.

336
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:37,425
Security memo
from Case himself.

337
00:16:37,425 --> 00:16:40,883
Couple of surprise guests.
Just follow his lead, yeah?

338
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:42,883
We're all good.
I'm heading to
the control room.

339
00:16:42,883 --> 00:16:44,550
All right.
Thanks, Jack.

340
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:46,883
Atlas, go.

341
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:48,925
No, Dylan, I can't...

342
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,300
<i>What?</i>
<i>What's the problem?</i>

343
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,383
No, there's
too many people...

344
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:53,717
Atlas, I got Owen
landing now.

345
00:16:53,717 --> 00:16:55,342
Okay, I'm going now.

346
00:16:55,342 --> 00:16:56,925
Stop.

347
00:16:58,383 --> 00:16:59,758
Okay.
Thanks.

348
00:16:59,758 --> 00:17:00,883
Pascal, we need you
in the kitchen.

349
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,717
Look, the speech is
about freedom, okay?

350
00:17:21,717 --> 00:17:23,508
That's what we're
trying to sell here,
is freedom.

351
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:24,925
Which part of that
do you not understand?

352
00:17:24,925 --> 00:17:26,300
For goodness sake!
I know, I'm sorry.

353
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,717
Mr. Case.
John from legal.

354
00:17:27,717 --> 00:17:29,550
Just need
your signature
for release.

355
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,300
Thank you so much.

356
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,758
Just get it done
and get it back to me.

357
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:41,508
- Hey there, buddy!
- Smile!

358
00:17:41,508 --> 00:17:43,842
Who are you?
What the hell?
Who am I?

359
00:17:43,842 --> 00:17:45,758
It is picture day.
Did Julie not tell
you it's picture day?

360
00:17:45,758 --> 00:17:47,758
Picture day?
What are you...
Company-wide policy.

361
00:17:47,758 --> 00:17:49,883
Look, I got a job to do.
I have a job to do, too.

362

Hold on a second.
What is that?

363
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,592
I'm going to need
some backup here.

364

Who are you calling?
Hey! That's my ID.

365

Hey, I'm Bo Walsh!

367

He's not Bo Walsh.

Calm down, please.

369

Hey! Hey, what's going on?

370
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:01,925
This guy just came and
put a flashlight in my eyes.

371
00:18:01,925 --> 00:18:04,342
I'm trying to do my job.
This guy, check his badge.

372
00:18:04,342 --> 00:18:05,925
Who is this guy?
I'm Bo Walsh, not him.

373
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:07,967
It says here,
"Evans Mental Facility.

374
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:09,550
"Mark D. Stooge."
Hold on a second.

375
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,675
I've never seen
this before in my life.

376
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:13,342
Come on, Mr. Stooge.
Hold on.
He's not Mr. Walsh!

377
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,050
Come on. Let's go.
What's going on here?

378
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,925
I'm Bo Walsh, not him!

379
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:21,383
God, you cannot trust
anybody in this city
anymore, can you?

380
00:18:21,383 --> 00:18:23,050
Get off me!
Look, I want to make
a phone call.

381
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,008
I want to call my boss!
Hey, hey! What's going on?

382
00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:27,050
I want to call my boss,
and this jackass...

383
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,008
Hey! Make your phone call.
That's your right, sir.

384
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,425
That's my right.

385

You're crazy.
Let's go.

386

This isn't my...
Where's my phone?

Where's my phone?

388
00:18:36,842 --> 00:18:38,717
Atlas, Stooge has left
the building.

389
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:42,508
The circuit board is ours.
I am leaving backstage.

Lula, show these guys
what you're made of.

392
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:58,883
I can take over from here.
Clark says you're on break.

393
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,300
What break? Who's Clark?

394
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,883
"Who's Clark?"
That's funny.

395
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:05,383
Imagine if I
told Roger that,
he'd freak out.

396
00:19:05,383 --> 00:19:07,383
Don't do that!
What?

397
00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:08,717
Who the hell is Roger?

398
00:19:08,717 --> 00:19:10,383
Does Lisa know that
you don't know Roger?

399
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,050
I don't know
who Lisa is.
Are you kidding again?

400
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,717
You don't know
who Lisa is now?
No, I don't. Just get away.

401
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:15,925
That is
a dangerous...
You're ruining the meat.

402
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:17,675
Don't make me
have to go to Brian!

403
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:19,300
I don't know who Brian is!
Why are you
acting like this?

404
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,717
I'll go straight
to him.
Give me that!

405
00:19:21,717 --> 00:19:23,717

408
00:19:31,883 --> 00:19:34,508
Have some water.

409
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:37,342
I feel from your face
you're freaked
by the flow of blood,

410
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,883
which is fully fixable
in a snap

411
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:42,550
by focusing and following
the flow of my words

412
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,883
as you're flowing
and floating,

413
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,883
which is why
you're focusing
on my commands.

414
00:19:47,883 --> 00:19:49,425
You got this far in life

415
00:19:49,425 --> 00:19:52,008
by listening to one voice,
the voice in your head.

416
00:19:52,008 --> 00:19:53,967
This is that voice.

417
00:19:56,425 --> 00:19:57,883
Look at the light.

418
00:19:57,883 --> 00:20:00,842
Listen to
your own voice.

419
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,717
My God.

420
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,467
Wow. What is that?
Is that a miracle towel?

421
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:15,050
Thank you so much.
Do you know what?

422
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:18,675
You have taught me
that I'm not cut out
for this kind of work.

423
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,425
I quit!

424
00:20:20,425 --> 00:20:21,508
Get another towel.

425
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,592
Thank you,
and goodbye.

going onstage.

432
00:20:44,842 --> 00:20:47,383
You know, I've heard
that if you're nervous,

433
00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:50,342
it can be really helpful
to picture each other naked.

434
00:20:50,342 --> 00:20:52,008
It's actually picture
the audience naked.

00:20:52,008 --> 00:20:53,883
No, this is new.
This is a new science.

436
00:20:53,883 --> 00:20:55,425
So, I don't know.

437
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:56,717
Do you want...
We should try it.

438
00:20:56,717 --> 00:20:58,633
Not the right mood.

What? Picture each other...
No. No, thank you.

464
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:26,467
Pretty good.

465
00:22:28,675 --> 00:22:30,633
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>
<i>Um, okay.</i>

466
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:32,425
<i>We want to talk to you</i>
<i>about your privacy.</i>

467
00:22:32,425 --> 00:22:34,550
<i>What does your privacy</i>
<i>mean to you?</i>

468
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:37,050
<i>Because apparently</i>
<i>to Owen Case, it means</i>
<i>absolutely nothing.</i>

469
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,883
<i>No, actually</i>
<i>it means less than</i>
<i>absolutely nothing.</i>

470
00:22:39,883 --> 00:22:41,717
<i>You see, he's mocked</i>
<i>your privacy.</i>

471
00:22:41,717 --> 00:22:46,050
<i>Right, and we're not just</i>
<i>talking about the things</i>
<i>that you already agreed to</i>

472
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,508
<i>when you signed,</i>
<i>probably without reading</i>

473
00:22:48,508 --> 00:22:51,675
<i>the terms and conditions</i>
<i>of Octas 1 through 7.</i>

474
00:22:55,425 --> 00:22:58,342
Dylan, the FBI is here.

475
00:22:58,342 --> 00:23:00,592
All right.
Don't worry about it.

476
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:02,675
All right,
go to plan C-4.

477
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,758
Lock the doors.

478
00:23:05,758 --> 00:23:07,508
Hey, boss,
I'm glad you're here.

479
00:23:07,508 --> 00:23:09,467
Don't.

480
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:11,800
Guys, look.
We got to move around,
get in through the back.

481
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,467
These Horsemen
are tricky, okay?

482
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:16,675
They got backup plans
on top of backup plans.

483
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:18,800
Hey, sorry,
don't mean to gloat,
but I told you so.

484
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,383
We got an anonymous
phone call an hour ago.

485
00:23:22,383 --> 00:23:23,717
Confirms everything
I've been telling her.

486
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:25,008
What are you
talking about?

487
00:23:25,008 --> 00:23:28,883
You've been crying wolf
so we wouldn't
send them here.

488
00:23:28,883 --> 00:23:30,383
Boss, please.

489
00:23:30,383 --> 00:23:35,633
Please tell me that you
haven't bought into Cowan's
crazy, paranoid fantasia.

490
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:41,008
<i>We had Owen agree</i>
<i>to a few terms and</i>
<i>conditions of our own.</i>

491
00:23:41,008 --> 00:23:44,050
<i>So, everything</i>
<i>that he had once</i>
<i>considered private...</i>

492
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:48,758
<i>That he thinks</i>
<i>is really private...</i>

493
00:23:48,758 --> 00:23:52,800
<i>Yeah, everything</i>
<i>that he once considered</i>
<i>private is now...</i>

494
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,883
My.

495
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,967
<i>As the Horsemen</i>
<i>like to say,</i>

496
00:23:59,967 --> 00:24:02,967
<i>magic is about</i>
<i>controlling perception.</i>

497
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:07,050
<i>You see them</i>
<i>as champions of the truth,</i>
<i>but are they?</i>

498
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:10,050
<i>Or is that just another</i>
<i>one of their illusions?</i>

499
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,717
- What's going on, Rhodes?
- This is crazy.

500
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,342
We got to get everyone
to the other entrance.

501
00:24:14,342 --> 00:24:16,550
Let's go, to the back.
No. You stay here.

502
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:19,342
<i>So, since they clearly</i>
<i>love secrets...</i>

503
00:24:19,342 --> 00:24:21,842
<i>Let's reveal</i>
<i>some of theirs.</i>

504
00:24:21,842 --> 00:24:23,675
Danny, everyone,
get off the stage.

505
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:25,717
<i>Abort.</i>

506
00:24:25,717 --> 00:24:27,383
Jack, go with them.

507
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:31,800
<i>Do you recall the death</i>
<i>of Jack Wilder?</i>

508
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,758
<i>What if I told you</i>
<i>he's not just alive,</i>
<i>but he's actually right here.</i>

509
00:24:43,758 --> 00:24:45,675
<i>And do you know</i>
<i>who else is here?</i>

510
00:24:45,675 --> 00:24:47,300
<i>The FBI.</i>

511
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,508
<i>Let's let them in,</i>
<i>shall we?</i>

512
00:24:50,842 --> 00:24:52,592
<i>And now,</i>
<i>for the big reveal.</i>

513
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:55,467
Go! Move!
To the stage.

514
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:57,508
<i>There's a fifth Horseman,</i>

515
00:24:57,508 --> 00:25:00,425
<i>and he's the biggest</i>
<i>criminal of them all.</i>

516
00:25:00,425 --> 00:25:02,967
<i>FBI agent, Dylan Rhodes.</i>

517
00:25:04,592 --> 00:25:06,383
- I knew it.
- What?

518
00:25:07,717 --> 00:25:09,508
This is so much deeper
than you know, boss.

519
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,675
You think you're
looking at one thing,

520
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,383
but you have no idea.
Who are you?

521
00:25:12,383 --> 00:25:13,883
The same man
I've always been.

522
00:25:13,883 --> 00:25:15,967
Boys, I'm sorry.

523
00:25:24,675 --> 00:25:26,425
You gotta
be kidding me.

524
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:30,050
- Move! Move!
- Who are those guys?

525
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,467
Who cares? Come on!

526
00:25:31,467 --> 00:25:32,717
- Hurry, hurry!
- Keep going!

527
00:25:32,717 --> 00:25:34,383
How the hell
could this happen?

528
00:25:34,383 --> 00:25:35,592
I thought Dylan had
everything under control.

529
00:25:35,592 --> 00:25:37,425
Yeah.
Apparently he didn't.

530
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:38,883
Maybe you're
the leak, Dan.

531
00:25:38,883 --> 00:25:40,550
Where you been
sneaking off to?

532
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,008
Don't you dare
for a second
insinuate that I had...

533
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:43,592
I'm not insinuating.
That's your...

534
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:45,550
Let's get to the truck,
come on!

535
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,050
- Stay together!
- Move! Move!

536
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,883
Lula, come on!

537
00:25:48,883 --> 00:25:50,842
Coming! Whoa!

538
00:25:53,758 --> 00:25:54,883
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

539
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:03,050
<i>Sleep. Sleep.</i>
<i>Sleep. Sleep.</i>

540
00:26:13,592 --> 00:26:15,050
What the hell
is going on?

541
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,383
Wasn't there supposed
to be a truck?

542
00:26:16,383 --> 00:26:17,550
Where the hell are we?

543
00:26:19,717 --> 00:26:20,925
Come on!

544
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:22,883
Hey, hey! Wait,
did you mis-run the tube?

545
00:26:22,883 --> 00:26:24,717
No, I put it in the truck.
I know I did!

546
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:26,383
Because we're really
not in the truck right now.

547
00:26:26,383 --> 00:26:30,717
I'm moving! Relax!
There's something
very wrong.

548
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,508
Okay.
Why are we here?

549
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:38,550
Why am I
frickin' starving?

550
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,717
Yeah,
I'm weirdly starving, too.

551
00:26:40,717 --> 00:26:43,008
This makes no sense.

552
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:08,383
Okay, sorry.

553
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:12,425
At least,
and I know this
isn't much consolation,

554
00:27:12,425 --> 00:27:14,758
but apparently
we're now surrounded
by Chinese food.

555
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:15,925
Right?

556
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:20,508
I think where we are
right now, they don't refer
to it as "Chinese food."

557
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:21,758
It's just called

558
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,633
"food."

559
00:27:27,717 --> 00:27:30,550
Wait, what are you saying?
How is this possible?

560
00:27:32,842 --> 00:27:37,008
I believe in your
particular parlance,
the word is

561
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:38,383
"magic."

562
00:27:38,383 --> 00:27:40,925
That guy looks
exactly like you.

563
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:44,008
He looks exactly like you.
Are you seeing this
right now?

564
00:27:44,008 --> 00:27:45,342
Chase.

565
00:27:45,342 --> 00:27:49,425
it's like what I heard
about meeting
the Rolling Stones.

566
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:51,383
They're a lot
shorter in person.

567
00:27:51,383 --> 00:27:54,342
Remember I told you about
the guy who screwed me
out of everything?

568
00:27:54,342 --> 00:27:57,675
This is
my twin brother, Chase.

569
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,425
Wait,
did you do this?

570
00:28:01,675 --> 00:28:03,633
As you can see,

571
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:05,550
my boss don't mess around.

572
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,383
I do not understand what is
going on right now. At all.

573
00:28:08,383 --> 00:28:10,508
Okay, let me break it
down for you.

574
00:28:10,508 --> 00:28:14,550
You jumped off
a rooftop in New York
and you landed in Macau.

575
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:18,675
AKA the Vegas of China.

576
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:20,550
And presto-changeo.

577
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,758
Don't you just love it?

578
00:28:21,758 --> 00:28:23,883
The "greatest magicians
in the world"

579
00:28:23,883 --> 00:28:26,550
are the object
of someone else's
magic trick?

580
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,717
Isn't that poetic?

581
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,383
No?
You know what,

582
00:28:32,383 --> 00:28:34,467
I'm not gonna
let you guys
yuck my yum.

583
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:36,883
Shoo-shoo. Or mu-shu.
Whatever.

584
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,425
And you know
what they say,

585
00:28:40,425 --> 00:28:42,967
"What happens in Macau..."

586
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:44,592
Well, I don't know
the rest of it,

587
00:28:44,592 --> 00:28:46,425
'cause it's
in Chinese...

588
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,050

Hey, I burned you once,
I'll burn you again.

615
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:19,967
I'm not playing,
Thaddeus.

616
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:22,800
It's not my game,
Agent Rhodes. It's yours.

617
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,425
You started it when
you locked me in a cell.

618
00:30:25,425 --> 00:30:27,050
<i>This is simply my move.</i>

619
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:29,050
Next one is yours.

620
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:33,800
<i>No!</i>

621
00:30:34,592 --> 00:30:36,300
Let go!

622
00:30:36,925 --> 00:30:39,717
Dad! Help me! Dad!

623
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,967
<i>Dad!</i>

624
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,592
<i>It's all about</i>
<i>blind spots.</i>

625
00:31:02,592 --> 00:31:04,925
<i>When you're staring</i>
<i>straight at something,</i>

626
00:31:04,925 --> 00:31:07,550
<i>and not see it. Why?</i>

627
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,883
Blind spots.

628
00:31:09,883 --> 00:31:11,717
We learned that together.
Didn't we, bro?

629
00:31:11,717 --> 00:31:15,050
Did he tell you that
we were partners once?

630
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:18,467
No? I didn't think so.
The "Mini-McKinneys."

631
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:20,842
<i>♪ Chasey and a Mer-Bear</i>

632
00:31:20,842 --> 00:31:22,883
<i>♪ Gonna make you scare-bear</i>

633
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:26,425
<i>♪ Ma-ma-magic McKinneys</i>

634
00:31:26,425 --> 00:31:28,508
Cool.

635
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:32,758
And then, one day,
we were 12

636
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:35,050
and Virginia von Welsheim

637
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:38,383
had a very nice party
down the street.

638
00:31:38,383 --> 00:31:41,050
I had a little tum-tum,
couldn't go.

639
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:45,717
Mer-Bear did it on his own,
and got a taste
of the solo thing,

640
00:31:47,883 --> 00:31:49,342
and kicked me
to the curb.

641
00:31:49,342 --> 00:31:50,717
God.

642
00:31:50,717 --> 00:31:53,717
Chase, you win!
I concede.

643
00:31:53,717 --> 00:32:00,883
Delivery guy came to
your door about
a month ago, little za.

644
00:32:01,592 --> 00:32:02,675
Za?

645
00:32:02,675 --> 00:32:05,717
Pizza?

646
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,550
Is this apartment
d3375?

647
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,633
Not even close.

648
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,342
Sleep!

649
00:32:15,842 --> 00:32:17,050
Relaxing, floating,

650
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,383
drifting, dreaming...

651
00:32:19,383 --> 00:32:21,717
Falling.

652
00:32:21,717 --> 00:32:24,008
So, what he did,
my little womb-mate,

653
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:28,008
is he downloaded all
your private information,

654
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:31,425
and my employer
had all he needed.

655
00:32:31,425 --> 00:32:32,758
Thanks.

656
00:32:32,758 --> 00:32:35,717
How did you know
how to find him?

657
00:32:35,717 --> 00:32:38,883
That's a very
good question, Atlas.
Okay.

658
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:59,883
Just follow the guards.
They'll take you to my boss.

659
00:33:03,383 --> 00:33:07,008
Been fun playing
this cat-and-mouse
with you, broski.

660
00:33:07,008 --> 00:33:08,967
Meow.

661
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:13,467
Have fun at the Sands.

662
00:33:16,717 --> 00:33:18,842
I am so, so, so sorry.

663
00:33:18,842 --> 00:33:23,008
Don't ever accuse me
of betraying us
again, okay?

664
00:33:35,425 --> 00:33:38,300
Do you guys ever think that
the Eye is watching this?

665
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,717
You know, that maybe this
is even what they want?

666
00:33:42,717 --> 00:33:44,508
And at the exact
right moment,

667
00:33:44,508 --> 00:33:46,717
they're gonna swoop in,
and we'll be like,

668
00:33:46,717 --> 00:33:48,717
"Yes! Thank God
you're here!

669
00:33:48,717 --> 00:33:51,300
"Thank God! Just in
the nick of time, Eye!"

670
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,967
And then we'll
just celebrate,

671
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:55,383
and it was all
worth it in the end?

672
00:33:59,425 --> 00:34:01,550
I don't even really
think that, either, so...

673
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,550
It's cool.

674
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,883
Ta-da!

675
00:34:22,508 --> 00:34:24,633
So happy to be
working with you.

676
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:26,383
Please, come in. Come in.

677
00:34:26,383 --> 00:34:28,550
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

678
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,550
Wait, sorry, how are you
working with us?

679
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,883
Well, as much as
a magician who pulls
a rabbit from a hat

680
00:34:32,883 --> 00:34:35,842
is working
with that rabbit.

681
00:34:35,842 --> 00:34:38,342
We'll be working
together. Yes.

682
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:42,425
Yeah, you're Walter Mabry.
You died a year ago.

683
00:34:42,425 --> 00:34:44,008
Yes. An idea I got
from you, Mr. Wilder.

684
00:34:44,008 --> 00:34:46,008
Fake your death,
the world puts
its guard down.

685
00:34:46,008 --> 00:34:48,050
I'm able to control
quite a few companies,

686
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,383
including my old partner,
Owen's,

687
00:34:50,383 --> 00:34:52,883
as a consortium of so-called
anonymous shareholders.

688
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:55,425
And that violates
how many SEC laws?

689
00:34:55,425 --> 00:34:56,717
I believe it
breaks all of them.

690
00:34:56,717 --> 00:34:58,300
All of them.

691
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,008
You see,
you all want an audience.

692
00:35:01,008 --> 00:35:03,300
Need one, desperately.

693
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,592
It's quite sad, really.

694
00:35:04,592 --> 00:35:06,717
Hence, my ability
to nab you.

695
00:35:06,717 --> 00:35:09,675
I, on the other hand,
want the opposite of that.

696
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:12,300
I just want to be, and I am

697
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,008
100% off the grid.

698
00:35:14,008 --> 00:35:15,550
You know why?

699
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,967
Yeah, because the grid
is for actual human beings.

700
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:20,550
No, because in a world
of total surveillance,

701
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,717
the only true freedom
lies in not being seen.

702
00:35:23,717 --> 00:35:25,967
You can't control the grid
from within the grid.

703
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:27,967
Follow me.
Yeah.

704
00:35:27,967 --> 00:35:29,842
Follow me.
Okay. All right.

705
00:35:29,842 --> 00:35:32,342
You pulled a hat
out of a rabbit.
That was very colorful.

706
00:35:32,342 --> 00:35:34,008
Almost eight and
a half years ago.

707
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:35,842
So, no need
to bring that up.

708
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,550
We can't all be held
accountable for our
adolescent personas.

709
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,717
Can we, Magicolio?

710
00:35:40,717 --> 00:35:43,300
Magicolio,
that was 15 years ago.

711
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:48,717
Like you, and many others who,
I suppose, were not getting
any sex in high school,

712
00:35:48,717 --> 00:35:50,633
I dabbled with it.

713
00:35:50,633 --> 00:35:52,800
But, unlike you,
I was able to
transition upward

714
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,925
towards actual magic.

715
00:35:54,925 --> 00:35:56,633
Science, you may
have heard it called.

716
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:03,967
would you like to know,
my friends,
just how I got you here?

717
00:36:03,967 --> 00:36:05,383
We know how you did it.

718
00:36:05,383 --> 00:36:07,425
No, you don't.
Yeah,

719
00:36:07,425 --> 00:36:09,383
you stole our files
for the show, then
obviously hypnotized us.

720
00:36:09,383 --> 00:36:13,342
The strobe was a combo
of binaural beats,
as well as...

721
00:36:13,342 --> 00:36:15,675
I said stop!

722
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:19,425
You might not be
having fun, but I am.

723
00:36:19,425 --> 00:36:21,508
You have an unusual
way of showing it.

724
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:23,050
So...

725
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,883
How did I do it?

726
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:30,050
You see, magicians
like to control other
people's perceptions.

727
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,717
In your heightened
state of agitation,

728
00:36:31,717 --> 00:36:34,050
<i>you saw the simplest cues.</i>
<i>Black tube, roof.</i>

729
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,675
<i>And your minds</i>
<i>filled in the rest.</i>

730
00:36:36,675 --> 00:36:39,550
<i>But the tube you</i>
<i>meant to go down</i>
<i>was 20 feet to your right.</i>

731
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,675
Go on, sit down.
There's no one
standing in your way.

732
00:36:41,675 --> 00:36:42,800
Don't mind if I do.

733
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:47,300
Anyway, once in the tube,
yes, you're right...

734
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,300
<i>Blah, blah, blah,</i>
<i>the strobe contained</i>

735
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,050
<i>UV letters pulsing</i>
<i>the word "sleep."</i>

736
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:56,967
<i>And that, combined with</i>
<i>the sound, put you into</i>
<i>an instant alpha pattern.</i>

737
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,842
<i>Sleep, sleep, sleep.</i>

738
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,592
And from then on,
it really was just fun.

739
00:37:01,592 --> 00:37:02,842
And I can assure you,

740
00:37:02,842 --> 00:37:04,967
you don't know
what happened.

741
00:37:09,717 --> 00:37:10,842
That's really creepy.

742
00:37:10,842 --> 00:37:12,717
Really, really creepy.

743
00:37:15,383 --> 00:37:16,800
That's not cool.

744
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,508
Yep, easy stuff, magic,

745
00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:21,300
if you put your mind to it.

746
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,342
All right, that's enough.
So why are we here, then?

747
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:25,967
Besides you getting
to show off how
adorably clever you are.

748
00:37:25,967 --> 00:37:28,883
Well, to start with,
the man you stole from
last year,

749
00:37:28,883 --> 00:37:30,342
turns out I had invested

750
00:37:30,342 --> 00:37:31,717
quite a lot of money
in some of his companies,

751
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:34,967
so a lot of what you
stole was, in fact, mine.

752
00:37:34,967 --> 00:37:37,842
Good news is,
it's very easy for you
to pay me back.

753
00:37:37,842 --> 00:37:40,717
I just need your skills.

754
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:43,592
Owen and I were
like the Beatles,
if the Beatles had been...

755
00:37:43,592 --> 00:37:44,717
Elfin?

756
00:37:44,717 --> 00:37:46,050
...geniuses.

757
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,842
Pretty sure the Beatles
were geniuses.

758
00:37:47,842 --> 00:37:49,383
And like them,
we had a dream.

759
00:37:50,967 --> 00:37:54,800
Could we create actual,
genuine magic?

760
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,300
And I'm guessing one of you
achieved that dream,
and it wasn't you?

761
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,467
That is what he
would like you to think.

762
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:06,675
was a perfect blend
of elegance and technology.

763
00:38:06,675 --> 00:38:08,967
But Owen
wanted it for himself
so he humiliated me

764
00:38:08,967 --> 00:38:12,383
by exposing my private files
to the board of directors

765
00:38:12,383 --> 00:38:13,800
and convinced them
that I am unstable.

766
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,967
Did you take
a picture of him
while he was sleeping?

767
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:17,550
He had me kicked out of
my own company,

768
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:21,717
taking credit for a chip
that's not just
the key to one computer,

769
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:24,842
but every computer
system on the planet.

770
00:38:24,842 --> 00:38:27,967
It can un-encrypt anything,
crack the defense firewall,

771
00:38:27,967 --> 00:38:30,842
manipulate markets,
and spy on anyone.

772
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,717
And now it's being sold
to the highest bidder.

773
00:38:32,717 --> 00:38:34,425
If you're so rich,
why don't you just buy it?

774
00:38:34,425 --> 00:38:35,842
So he gets the money?

775
00:38:35,842 --> 00:38:38,050
And the pleasure? No.

776
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,550
why would I buy it
when I could have you
steal it for me?

777
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,383
It's being previewed tomorrow
to the various suitors,

778
00:38:45,383 --> 00:38:46,883
which will
include your targets,

779
00:38:46,883 --> 00:38:48,550
a crew lead by
a South African gangster.

780
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:51,800
Yes. How your team
gets past security,
that's up to you.

781
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,800
But once you do, you just need
to inspect it and steal it.

782
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,925
Come on, this is
perfect for you, isn't it?

783
00:38:57,925 --> 00:38:59,717
You're magicians and thieves.

784
00:38:59,717 --> 00:39:01,883
What makes you think
we would even
consider doing this?

785
00:39:01,883 --> 00:39:05,383
Um, wait, I had a reason.
What was it? Yes.

786
00:39:05,383 --> 00:39:06,925
You see, back home,
you're wanted criminals.

787
00:39:06,925 --> 00:39:10,383
But here,
I control the police,
the casinos, the media.

788
00:39:10,383 --> 00:39:13,633
I can give you a new life,
out of hiding.

789
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:17,008
And if you don't,
I'll have you killed.

790
00:39:18,967 --> 00:39:20,050
You know what?

791
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,717
I'm not stealing
a thing for you.

792
00:39:21,717 --> 00:39:23,550
Not unless Dylan
tells me it's okay.

793
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,717
Really?
Dylan is where,
exactly?

794
00:39:25,717 --> 00:39:28,883
Yeah, I'm with him.
So you can go
ahead and kill us

795
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:30,925
because I'm not
gonna steal anything
for you either.

796
00:39:30,925 --> 00:39:34,675
Strikes me
that a consensus seems
to be forming, Walter,

797
00:39:34,675 --> 00:39:36,383
and we're calling
your bluff.

798
00:39:37,883 --> 00:39:39,967
Actually,
we'll do it.
What?

799
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:42,842
We're in Macau.
The oldest magic store
in the world is here.

800
00:39:42,842 --> 00:39:46,383
We'll get
the supplies we need,
and we'll do it.

801
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,800
Thank you.

802
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,508
Chase will take you
to the magic shop
in the morning.

803
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,592
<i>Badge.</i>

804
00:40:03,342 --> 00:40:04,550
Really?

805
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,925
Thanks.

806
00:40:07,925 --> 00:40:09,008
Agent Cowan.

807
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,550
Your ID.

808
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,967
Yeah. Thanks.

809
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:20,592
It appears Mr. Bradley's
still at dinner.

810
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:23,425
Yeah? Tell him
recess is over.

811
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,342
What?

812
00:40:50,467 --> 00:40:54,008
Where are they?
I don't have time
for bullshit.

813
00:40:54,008 --> 00:40:56,675
I have all the time
in the world, thanks to you.

814
00:40:56,675 --> 00:40:58,425
And I didn't get to
finish my lobster,

815
00:40:58,425 --> 00:40:59,925
which makes me very grumpy.

816
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:02,883
Okay, let's cut the crap.
What do you want?

817
00:41:02,883 --> 00:41:06,300
You can dispense
with the tough guy act
to begin with.

818
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,758
You're too desperate
for it to be believable.

819
00:41:10,842 --> 00:41:13,550
I said,
what do you want?

820
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,883
You used
a form 219 warrant

821
00:41:15,883 --> 00:41:19,883
You found a connection
between me
and the Four Horsemen.

822
00:41:19,883 --> 00:41:22,008
Which means

823
00:41:22,008 --> 00:41:24,592
you can take me
out of here
on a 24-hour leave.

824
00:41:24,592 --> 00:41:25,883
You want me
to break you out?

825
00:41:27,008 --> 00:41:29,592
I want you
to take me out.

826
00:41:29,592 --> 00:41:31,883
All you need is
an extradition order,

827
00:41:31,883 --> 00:41:33,842
which you'll find in
that tray by my printer.

828
00:41:35,717 --> 00:41:41,008
I had nothing to do
with the Horsemen's
disappearance.

829
00:41:41,008 --> 00:41:43,717
You were lured
into a trap.

830
00:41:43,717 --> 00:41:46,758
And like Dorothy did
when she landed in Oz,

831
00:41:46,758 --> 00:41:48,967
you're beginning
to realize

832
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:51,633
that the only way out

833
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:53,008
is through.

834
00:41:53,008 --> 00:41:55,633
And I'm the only one
who can get you there.

835
00:41:56,967 --> 00:41:58,425
You got this place wired.

836
00:41:58,425 --> 00:42:00,592
You don't need me
to get out of here.

837
00:42:00,592 --> 00:42:02,633
This is all about payback.

838
00:42:02,633 --> 00:42:04,967
I believe in
an eye for an eye.

839
00:42:04,967 --> 00:42:06,550
So you're out
to destroy me?

840
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:09,050
You think I'm still gonna
play your little game?

841
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,842
I know you will.

842
00:42:10,842 --> 00:42:12,883
Because no matter
how hard you try

843
00:42:12,883 --> 00:42:14,883
to find a culprit
behind all this,

844
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:17,467
you're going to blame
only yourself.

845
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:22,050
When your little vendetta
ended with you putting me
in jail 18 months ago,

846
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:25,883
you got tired,
you got sloppy. You
stopped paying attention.

847
00:42:25,883 --> 00:42:27,967
And that's where you lost.

848
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,717
So,

849
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,717
you can save yourself,

850
00:42:36,425 --> 00:42:38,717
or you can make
a deal with me,

851
00:42:38,717 --> 00:42:40,883
and save the Four Horsemen,

852
00:42:40,883 --> 00:42:44,342
and stop wasting
both of our time.

853
00:42:46,467 --> 00:42:48,883
<i>Steal something</i>

854
00:42:48,883 --> 00:42:51,842
for this narcissistic
little man boy?
I don't like it.

855
00:42:51,842 --> 00:42:53,800
But what I like less
is you deciding for us.

856
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,717
Yeah? Do you like that
we're the laughing stocks
of the magic world,

857
00:42:56,717 --> 00:42:58,592
and the fugitives
of the actual world?

858
00:42:58,592 --> 00:43:00,425
Walter is right.
We have nowhere to go.

859
00:43:00,425 --> 00:43:01,717
But we can fix that.

860
00:43:01,717 --> 00:43:02,967
We can fix it?
Yeah.

861
00:43:02,967 --> 00:43:04,592
So you're officially
part of the team now?

862
00:43:04,592 --> 00:43:06,508
Excuse me?
I'm sure this
is what Dylan

863
00:43:06,508 --> 00:43:08,633
meant when he said
we should all work
as a single organism.

864
00:43:08,633 --> 00:43:11,883
Yeah, that is a fairytale
that Dylan tells himself,
and tells us.

865
00:43:11,883 --> 00:43:14,717
Look, even if
we get this stick,
he'll never let us go.

866
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,050
We can't trust Walter, okay?

867
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,842
The Eye has
a history in Macau.

868
00:43:18,842 --> 00:43:19,883
They're the only
ones we can trust.

869
00:43:19,883 --> 00:43:21,842
Now, if we can
get it to them,

870
00:43:21,842 --> 00:43:23,300
they can clear our names
and get us
the hell out of here.

871
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,800
It's a bad plan, man.

872
00:43:32,883 --> 00:43:33,967
Hey.

873
00:43:34,883 --> 00:43:36,342
Hi, how are you?

874
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:38,425
Um, we need some
things custom-made.

875
00:43:38,425 --> 00:43:39,967
Actually, by tomorrow.
We're kind of in a rush.

876
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:41,717
And...

877
00:43:41,717 --> 00:43:43,467
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

878
00:43:49,883 --> 00:43:53,342
Welcome to Iong's.
My name's Li. Not Bruce Lee.

879
00:43:53,342 --> 00:43:54,592
What?
Got you.

880
00:43:54,592 --> 00:43:55,717
Okay.
Look.

881
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,008
And now it's
by my head. How fun.

882
00:44:03,008 --> 00:44:04,717
$20.
$20?

883
00:44:04,717 --> 00:44:06,717
No, thank you.
We're kind of in a rush.

884
00:44:06,717 --> 00:44:08,967
$10.
No.

885
00:44:08,967 --> 00:44:11,967
Okay, all right.
Just give us
the thumbs. Yeah?

886
00:44:11,967 --> 00:44:14,425
Okay. Thanks a lot,
Jack. Please take these.

887
00:44:14,425 --> 00:44:17,050
So, we need
a Keplinger holdout,

888
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:20,425
and we also need
roughing fluid,
a Sanada gimmick,

889
00:44:20,425 --> 00:44:23,300
sleeves, tracks.
This is all in plastic,
though, if you can.

890
00:44:27,717 --> 00:44:28,758
What?

891
00:44:30,883 --> 00:44:35,717
My grandmother
wants to know why plastic?
Plastic is cheap.

892
00:44:35,717 --> 00:44:38,050
Sorry. Yeah, we need plastic
because we're...

893
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:41,717
We're going through
a very sensitive
metal detector, okay?

894
00:44:41,717 --> 00:44:44,633
So plastic, nothing.
Metal...

895
00:44:46,675 --> 00:44:47,883
It detects.

896
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,008
What did she say?

897
00:44:55,008 --> 00:44:57,717
She said just because
you're talking slowly
and moving your hands

898
00:44:57,717 --> 00:44:59,717
doesn't mean
she can suddenly
understand English.

899
00:44:59,717 --> 00:45:00,800
Yeah.

900
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,592
So sorry. He's racist.

901
00:45:02,592 --> 00:45:06,842
Listen, I know that
the only thing
that we agree on

902
00:45:06,842 --> 00:45:10,717
is that our mom and dad
had one too many children.

903
00:45:10,717 --> 00:45:13,883
So why don't we just let
the kids play with their toys

904
00:45:13,883 --> 00:45:15,508
and go get
a little drinkey-poo?

905
00:45:15,508 --> 00:45:16,967
If it's free, it's me.

906
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:18,425
Great.

907
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:20,842
Guys, we'll be right back.

908
00:45:20,842 --> 00:45:24,633
Okay, kiddies,
the chaperones
are watching you.

909
00:45:24,633 --> 00:45:26,883
Don't do anything
I wouldn't enjoy.

910
00:45:27,883 --> 00:45:30,008
Okay.
Have fun, you two.

911
00:45:32,425 --> 00:45:33,883
Hey.

912
00:45:33,883 --> 00:45:35,842
Can I use your phone?
It's kind of important.

913
00:45:35,842 --> 00:45:38,008
Sure.

914
00:45:38,008 --> 00:45:39,758
On the house.
Thanks.

915
00:45:41,425 --> 00:45:44,008
I'm arranging
to hand over the stick.

916
00:45:44,008 --> 00:45:45,883
So that's how we've been
contacting the Eye?

917
00:45:45,883 --> 00:45:47,342
You've been doing it
on your own?

918
00:45:47,342 --> 00:45:48,508
Maybe.

919
00:45:48,508 --> 00:45:50,883
God.
Dylan's not
gonna like this.

920
00:45:50,883 --> 00:45:52,508
I'm not really concerned
with what Dylan likes.

921
00:45:52,508 --> 00:45:54,467
Okay?
I'm doing this for us.

922
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,967
What is wrong
with this thing?

923
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:00,342
Hey, relax,
it's just a kid's toy.

924
00:46:00,342 --> 00:46:01,675
Yeah, that's
what I thought.

925
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,008
Okay. Let me just...

926
00:46:03,008 --> 00:46:05,633
Sorry, sorry. Jesus.

927
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:09,967
Hey, can you get this?

928
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,592
It's like birth,
you know.

929
00:46:16,592 --> 00:46:18,800
One person
enters the hospital,

930
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,050
two people come out.

931
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:21,675
Walk and talk.

932
00:46:21,675 --> 00:46:23,967
I'll tell you
on the plane.

933
00:46:23,967 --> 00:46:26,300
What plane?

934
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,342
My sources tell me
your Horsemen
are in Macau.

935
00:46:29,925 --> 00:46:31,050
What's the look?

936
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:32,383
It's none of your business.

937
00:46:32,383 --> 00:46:33,633
Who are your sources?

938
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,383
Just some old friends.

939
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:48,300
When we have the card,
where do I go?

940
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,675
And 0 for 52.

941
00:46:50,717 --> 00:46:53,758
Well, it's perfect.
It's a perfect score.

942
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,675
Then what about girls?

943
00:46:57,675 --> 00:46:59,550
Like, relationships?

944
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,758
What?

945
00:47:04,592 --> 00:47:08,300
Look, it's not
something I'm proud of,

946
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,883
but every girl
I get close to,

947
00:47:11,883 --> 00:47:14,383
I end up
taking their trust.

948
00:47:14,383 --> 00:47:16,883
And then their wallet.

949
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:18,633
So...

950
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:22,550
You take their wallets?

951
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:23,633
Yeah.

952
00:47:25,758 --> 00:47:27,925
You ever take
their belts?

953
00:47:29,425 --> 00:47:30,592
Or how about

954
00:47:30,592 --> 00:47:33,842
some peanuts
from the hotel bar?

955
00:47:33,842 --> 00:47:36,842
Not sure why
you took those.

956
00:47:36,842 --> 00:47:40,008
I'm sorry, did you think
that I was like
those other girls?

957
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:43,467
Jack.

958
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:51,383
Okay. So there's
a marketplace
down the street.

959
00:47:51,383 --> 00:47:53,550
And I'm meeting
a man with a blue hat.

960
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:56,383
He'll get the stick
to the right people
and get us home.

961
00:47:56,383 --> 00:47:58,425
You go grab Merritt, okay?
We got a lot to do.

962
00:47:58,425 --> 00:48:00,300
And, hey,
put your belt on.

963
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,008
No, it's not...
She took it off me and...

964
00:48:04,008 --> 00:48:06,967
You know,
the most heartbreaking
moment of my life

965
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,300
was when I discovered

966
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:11,800
that you had stolen
all my money and split.

967
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,967
I didn't realize until now

968
00:48:13,967 --> 00:48:16,550
how much of that money
you put into your face.

969
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:21,300
Seriously, is it weird
to have more hair in your
nose than on your head?

970
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,842
Speaking of, next time
you get a hair transplant,

971
00:48:23,842 --> 00:48:26,633
you might wanna
consider requesting

972
00:48:26,633 --> 00:48:29,550
something other
than old man pubes.

973
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:33,675
You know what?
You are such a buffoon,
Mer-Bear.

974
00:48:33,675 --> 00:48:35,675
And this little ploy
you have

975
00:48:35,675 --> 00:48:39,842
of stalling me
while your friends
screw over my employer?

976
00:48:39,842 --> 00:48:41,550
Not gonna work.

977
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,675
Chase!
As you stare
into my eyes,

978
00:48:45,675 --> 00:48:48,050
you will find
that you wanna sleep.

979
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,592
When you wake, you will beg
for Merritt's forgiveness

980
00:48:50,592 --> 00:48:54,050
and realize that
you will never be
half the man that he is.

981
00:48:56,008 --> 00:48:57,300
Merritt,

982
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:02,717
I am so, so
very, very sorry

983
00:49:02,717 --> 00:49:05,550
about how pathetic
your pupil is.

984
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,800
Hey, a little hint
on your technique
of surprise.

985
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,592
It lacks that all-essential
little element of surprise.

986
00:49:13,675 --> 00:49:15,925
Hey, this has been fun,
Mer-Bear.

987
00:49:15,925 --> 00:49:18,008
Let's do it again
sometime.

988
00:49:21,467 --> 00:49:22,967
Well,

989
00:49:22,967 --> 00:49:26,508
I've had ample time to do
some research, and you know,

990
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:31,342
I think the Eye
might actually be real.

991
00:49:31,342 --> 00:49:32,800
Thought you didn't
buy into all that.

992
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,842
I'd be lying if I
said I didn't think

993
00:49:34,842 --> 00:49:38,383
that this road would lead
to the great wizard
behind the curtain

994
00:49:38,383 --> 00:49:40,883
and, in the end,
I might get to see his face.

995
00:49:40,883 --> 00:49:43,842
Even if the fate of
the Horsemen depends on it?

996
00:49:43,842 --> 00:49:45,342
Listen to me.
I broke you out of there.

997
00:49:45,342 --> 00:49:46,592
We're not
changing the terms now.

998
00:49:46,592 --> 00:49:47,842
You put me there!
Yeah,

999
00:49:47,842 --> 00:49:49,425
because you deserve
to be there.

1000
00:49:49,425 --> 00:49:52,050
Listen, I did not
kill your father.

1001
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:55,967
All right, all right,
let's just cut the bullshit.

1002
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,425
I know who you are,

1003
00:49:58,425 --> 00:49:59,675
Shrike.

1004
00:50:00,883 --> 00:50:02,967
I know you blame me
for your father's death.

1005
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:07,008
I know you think
I goaded him into performing
a trick he couldn't pull off.

1006
00:50:07,008 --> 00:50:09,425
I know the time in
jail was a result

1007
00:50:09,425 --> 00:50:11,592
of a 30-year revenge plot
against me.

1008
00:50:11,592 --> 00:50:14,300
Supposing that's all true,
you think I'd tell you now?

1009
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,508
Man.

1010
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,425
30 years.

1011
00:50:18,883 --> 00:50:24,592
and the greatest long game
magic trick ever created.

1012
00:50:24,592 --> 00:50:26,967
Just to put me
behind bars.

1013
00:50:26,967 --> 00:50:28,342
Okay.

1014
00:50:29,925 --> 00:50:31,883
So how did it feel,
seeing me there?

1015
00:50:32,842 --> 00:50:34,675
Was it all you hoped?

1016
00:50:34,717 --> 00:50:35,883
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1017
00:50:35,883 --> 00:50:37,050
You're lying.

1018
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:40,425
It was an empty experience.

1019
00:50:40,425 --> 00:50:42,508
And you wanna know
how I know?

1020
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:46,425
I know because you know.

1021
00:50:47,592 --> 00:50:50,842
There's always, always more

1022
00:50:50,842 --> 00:50:52,675
than what's on the surface.
So what,

1023
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:54,300
the past didn't happen,
and you're not
who I think you are?

1024
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:55,883
Now, don't tell me
in 30 years

1025
00:50:55,883 --> 00:50:58,758
that's the first time you've
asked yourself that question.

1026
00:50:59,425 --> 00:51:00,925
I am not my father.

1027
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:02,758
You're not getting
in my head, okay?

1028
00:51:02,758 --> 00:51:05,425
You think you're
luring me into a trap?
You're not.

1029
00:51:05,425 --> 00:51:08,008
Now, I am desperate,
which means I'm dangerous.

1030
00:51:08,008 --> 00:51:11,633
My only concern is
the health and well-being
of the Horsemen.

1031
00:51:11,633 --> 00:51:14,425
And you're gonna
lead me to them.
And if you don't,

1032
00:51:14,425 --> 00:51:16,425
I promise you,
you're gonna end up
far worse

1033
00:51:16,425 --> 00:51:19,008
than in some cushy
jail cell somewhere.

1034
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:36,050
What if the Horsemen
don't actually
need you to save them?

1035
00:51:40,633 --> 00:51:43,342
All right.
So the lab is made up
of two distinct layers,

1036
00:51:43,342 --> 00:51:44,633
the security perimeter

1037
00:51:44,633 --> 00:51:46,633
and the clean room.

1038
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:48,675
The stick we're looking for
should be in this core.

1039
00:51:48,717 --> 00:51:50,717
So we're gonna have to
get underneath, extract it,

1040
00:51:50,717 --> 00:51:52,633
and replace it with a decoy.

1041
00:51:52,633 --> 00:51:58,592
Luckily, it's similar
in weight and size
to a playing card,

1042
00:51:58,592 --> 00:52:00,550
so we're gonna have to
brush up on our card-istry.

1043
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:03,675
Whoa, whoa!

1044
00:52:07,967 --> 00:52:09,342
That's no good.

1045
00:52:18,717 --> 00:52:20,967
So how do we get in?
Hannes Pike.

1046
00:52:20,967 --> 00:52:22,842
He's the son of
a South African gangster.

1047
00:52:22,842 --> 00:52:24,800
<i>He's RSVP'd with</i>
<i>what looks like</i>

1048
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,675
<i>a couple of members</i>
<i>of his security detail.</i>

1049
00:52:26,717 --> 00:52:29,717
<i>A doctor, to vet it, I guess,</i>
<i>and somebody named Buffy.</i>

1050
00:52:29,717 --> 00:52:33,508
<i>Yeah, apparently,</i>
<i>he travels with a different</i>
<i>bimbo every week. </i>

1051
00:52:33,508 --> 00:52:35,550
I wonder which one of us
gets to play the bimbo.

1052
00:52:44,717 --> 00:52:46,675
Hey, can I get in?

1053
00:52:48,425 --> 00:52:49,925
At the soothing
sound of the slots

1054
00:52:49,925 --> 00:52:53,508
you slip into a serene state
of slumber and sleep.

1055
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:59,300
<i>they will think you're Hannes,</i>
<i>so lead them out</i>
<i>and keep them busy.</i>

1056
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,508
You trust your
people implicitly.

1057
00:53:01,508 --> 00:53:03,550
You will have them
take care of everything,

1058
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:04,967
and you will wait
in the car.

1059
00:53:04,967 --> 00:53:08,675
And eyes open,
wide awake. Go.

1060
00:53:08,717 --> 00:53:10,592
Excuse me.
These people
are following me.

1061
00:53:10,592 --> 00:53:11,842
You might wanna
check their pockets.

1062
00:53:15,842 --> 00:53:17,633
<i>Then our time is</i>
<i>ticking to infiltrate the lab</i>

1063
00:53:17,633 --> 00:53:19,008
<i>and get the card</i>
<i>to the market,</i>

1064
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:20,508
<i>where I'll hand it off</i>
<i>to the Eye,</i>

1065
00:53:20,508 --> 00:53:21,508
<i>so we can all</i>
<i>get the hell home.</i>

1066
00:53:40,883 --> 00:53:42,717
Hannes, my old friend.

1067
00:53:42,717 --> 00:53:44,425
So glad
you could make it.

1068
00:53:44,425 --> 00:53:47,550
I knew you had
a soft spot for
an old-school bidding war.

1069
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:48,675
How have you been?

1070
00:53:48,717 --> 00:53:50,842
I trust my people
implicitly.

1071
00:53:50,842 --> 00:53:55,592
Certainly. But I'm sure
you'd like to see
it for yourself.

1072
00:53:55,592 --> 00:53:58,425
Hold it in your hands,
check the build quality.

1073
00:54:00,717 --> 00:54:03,425
Or not. Also fine.

1074
00:54:03,425 --> 00:54:05,508
Well, if you'd like
to follow me.

1075
00:54:08,883 --> 00:54:11,508
You'll have to
remove all your metal.

1076
00:54:11,508 --> 00:54:12,717
Watches, rings, etc.

1077
00:54:12,717 --> 00:54:13,967
Yeah, of course.

1078
00:54:13,967 --> 00:54:15,842
Excuse me for asking...

1079
00:54:15,842 --> 00:54:17,758
Where might I
have seen you before?

1080
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:21,508
I don't know, probably
one of my many symposiums.

1081
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,675
The book jacket!

1082
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,342
I have to say,
Dr. Michaelakis,

1083
00:54:24,383 --> 00:54:25,592
I'm a huge fan.

1084
00:54:25,592 --> 00:54:27,550
thank you so much.

1085
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:31,008
Which book?
There have been so many.

1086
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:33,883
Does Hannes' chippy
always talk for you, Doctor?

1087
00:54:35,717 --> 00:54:36,758
Doctor?

1088
00:54:39,508 --> 00:54:43,342
Sorry, when you say "chippy,"
you are referring
to Buffy here, yeah?

1089
00:54:43,342 --> 00:54:44,508
Of course.

1090
00:54:46,425 --> 00:54:48,550
Hannes prefers
the term "floozy"

1091
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:50,842
for all his boy toys.

1092
00:54:50,842 --> 00:54:53,883
Yeah. He does.
That's good.
Noted.

1093
00:54:53,883 --> 00:54:56,008
By the way,
I got your email,
Dr. Michaelakis.

1094
00:54:56,008 --> 00:54:57,633
You had a query
about our ability

1095
00:54:57,633 --> 00:54:59,758
to maintain quantum coherence
at room temperature

1096
00:54:59,758 --> 00:55:01,675
without the use of dilution,
refrigerators,

1097
00:55:01,717 --> 00:55:04,425
or error correction.

1098
00:55:04,425 --> 00:55:06,008
Do you care
to elucidate?

1099
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:07,550
Right.
Yeah.

1100
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:09,550
Yes, I did send that email.

1101
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,342
The other day, I saw you.
I did, I sent it.

1102
00:55:11,383 --> 00:55:12,592
So what gives?

1103
00:55:12,592 --> 00:55:14,008
I'm sorry, what gives...

1104
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,675
I think what
she's trying to say...

1105
00:55:15,717 --> 00:55:17,717
Actually, the grown-ups
are having a meeting, Buffy.

1106
00:55:17,717 --> 00:55:19,008
Okay.

1107
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,467
If you'll hold on to that.

1108
00:55:20,467 --> 00:55:22,300
Yeah, sure, Doctor.
Thank you.

1109
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,717
Now, every seventh grader,
even the dumb ones,

1110
00:55:24,717 --> 00:55:26,842
know the second law
of thermodynamics.

1111
00:55:26,883 --> 00:55:28,842
"All ordered systems
tend toward disorder."

1112
00:55:28,842 --> 00:55:30,633
Disorder!

1113
00:55:30,633 --> 00:55:34,508
So I'm going to ask you one
more time, sir, what gives?

1114
00:55:40,967 --> 00:55:44,342
Well, it's actually
topological quantum order.

1115
00:55:44,342 --> 00:55:47,425
The emergence of
quantum effects
on a macroscopic level.

1116
00:55:47,425 --> 00:55:50,383
So that is,
in fact, what gives.

1117
00:55:55,383 --> 00:55:56,467
Thank you.

1118
00:56:02,842 --> 00:56:06,967
You know,
Buffy is not a bad
name for you.

1119
00:56:06,967 --> 00:56:10,675
You know,
buff, firm, taut.

1120
00:56:10,717 --> 00:56:12,592
That's good.
Did you just find
a thesaurus somewhere?

1121
00:56:12,592 --> 00:56:13,883
Nubile.

1122
00:56:13,883 --> 00:56:15,633
- That's good.
- Thank you. Okay.

1123
00:56:15,633 --> 00:56:17,050
There we go.

1124
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:29,050
Sorry, sorry.

1125
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:38,508
The stick's metal.
How are we going
to get it out?

1126
00:56:38,508 --> 00:56:39,717
Yeah. I don't know.

1127
00:56:40,842 --> 00:56:42,717
This is the housing.

1128
00:56:42,717 --> 00:56:46,758
820 million qubit miles
of digi-synaptic resonance.

1129
00:56:52,717 --> 00:56:55,300
But of course, what sets us
apart from anything
else on the planet

1130
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,842
is the processor,

1131
00:56:56,842 --> 00:56:59,842
which we playfully refer to
as the Magic Broomstick.

1132
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:00,967
The Broomstick?

1133
00:57:00,967 --> 00:57:02,425
Has the power to
clear the contents

1134
00:57:02,425 --> 00:57:04,758
of any computing
system on the planet

1135
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:07,550
and then magically
sweep them into your bin.

1136
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:10,300
Broomstick.
That's funny.

1137
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,967
Take a look,
vet it however you'd like,

1138
00:57:12,967 --> 00:57:15,508
and tell Hannes we'll be
taking bids on Monday.

1139
00:57:15,508 --> 00:57:16,717
Thank you.

1140
00:57:18,717 --> 00:57:21,550
My God.
I must be allergic
to something in here.

1141
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:23,342
What could you possibly be
allergic to in here?

1142
00:57:23,342 --> 00:57:24,383
This room is
hermetically sealed.

1143
00:57:24,883 --> 00:57:26,717
That's it.

1144
00:57:26,717 --> 00:57:30,550
If we could get him away
from the computer, please.

1145
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:31,967
That's the one thing.

1146
00:57:31,967 --> 00:57:33,342
Just until
he's recovered.

1147
00:57:33,342 --> 00:57:34,842
We're gonna need
some anti-bacterial...

1148
00:57:35,883 --> 00:57:37,758
Do we have
alcohol wipes?

1149
00:57:37,758 --> 00:57:40,300
Your hands need to be
sterile if you intend
to get any closer.

1150
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,508
Do I make myself clear?

1151
00:57:44,008 --> 00:57:45,592
Sorry. We couldn't...

1152
00:57:45,592 --> 00:57:46,883
No, I'm fine.

1153
00:57:46,883 --> 00:57:48,342
...take his medicine
into the country.

1154
00:57:48,342 --> 00:57:49,508
Yeah.

1155
00:57:52,842 --> 00:57:55,425
Can't risk
any contamination.

1156
00:57:55,425 --> 00:57:58,008
You're gonna have to stay away
from the inner workings.

1157
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:59,550
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1158
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:01,342
All right.
If you're done...
Here you go.

1159
00:58:01,342 --> 00:58:02,967
Sorry about this.
Okay. I'm okay.

1160
00:58:02,967 --> 00:58:05,008
This happens to him
sometimes. It'll pass.
Allergies.

1161
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:07,342
Allergies.
Nothing you can do.

1162
00:58:07,342 --> 00:58:09,342
Well, something
you could do, Doctor.

1163
00:58:29,342 --> 00:58:30,425
Okay?

1164
00:58:37,425 --> 00:58:38,467
Search him, please.

1165
00:58:38,467 --> 00:58:39,842
Didn't we
just do that?

1166
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:42,842
Okay. I wanna run
full diagnostics
on the system.

1167
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,050
This is completely
unnecessary.

1168
00:59:16,592 --> 00:59:17,842
Up, up.

1169
00:59:17,842 --> 00:59:19,008
Okay.

1170
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,675
Hey! I can walk on my own.

1171
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:50,800
Whoa!

1172
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:53,508
Sorry.

1173
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,425
Hey!

1174
01:00:12,425 --> 01:00:14,425
I can do that myself.

1175
01:00:14,425 --> 01:00:16,675
We just met, man.

1176
01:00:16,717 --> 01:00:18,008
Handsy, handsy, handsy.

1177
01:00:30,342 --> 01:00:31,383
Hey!

1178
01:00:32,467 --> 01:00:34,967
My eyes are up here, man.

1179
01:00:34,967 --> 01:00:36,508
How do you like it?

1180
01:00:58,883 --> 01:01:00,008
Hey, I'm good.

1181
01:01:01,717 --> 01:01:02,758
Turn around.

1182
01:01:20,842 --> 01:01:22,300
Do you have anything?

1183
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,883
I don't know.
Can't trust anybody.

1184
01:01:25,425 --> 01:01:26,592
I'm good.

1185
01:01:26,592 --> 01:01:27,675
They're clean.

1186
01:01:29,008 --> 01:01:31,008
Do your final checks
and get them out of here.

1187
01:01:31,008 --> 01:01:33,508
We're walking
this way again. Yay.

1188
01:01:38,883 --> 01:01:42,633
I don't speak
the language.

1189
01:01:48,883 --> 01:01:50,425
See?

1190
01:01:50,425 --> 01:01:52,342
What did I tell you, man?
We didn't have anything.

1191
01:01:53,342 --> 01:01:55,800
Thanks, pal. Appreciate that.

1192
01:02:11,717 --> 01:02:14,342
Something about
a big white dance floor,

1193
01:02:14,342 --> 01:02:15,550
makes me wanna boogie.

1194
01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:17,008
Hey, thanks for having us.

1195
01:02:18,425 --> 01:02:20,425
That's great stuff.

1196
01:02:26,425 --> 01:02:30,342
You guys are pretty serious
about your security?

1197
01:02:33,633 --> 01:02:35,342
Okay.

1198
01:02:35,383 --> 01:02:37,842
Do I have all my things?
I feel like I came in

1199
01:02:37,842 --> 01:02:39,508
with more stuff.
Did I come in
with more stuff?

1200
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:42,675
You don't think so?

1201
01:02:45,842 --> 01:02:48,550
Sir, I think you
still have my wallet.

1202
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:51,342
Remember, I, gave it
to you when I came in?

1203
01:02:51,342 --> 01:02:53,508
It would be nice
to leave with it.

1204
01:02:58,300 --> 01:02:59,342
Wallet coming through.

1205
01:03:06,967 --> 01:03:08,675
Sorry, my belt.

1206
01:03:15,883 --> 01:03:17,967
I guess that's
everything, right?

1207
01:03:17,967 --> 01:03:19,300
Thank you.

1208
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,758
That is not a toy,
Buffy.
Sorry.

1209
01:03:26,883 --> 01:03:28,633
Go, go, go!

1210
01:03:35,008 --> 01:03:36,967
All right. Now,
drop me off at the market

1211
01:03:36,967 --> 01:03:42,342
You asked me to call you when
they started running around
like headless chickens.

1212
01:03:43,342 --> 01:03:44,675
Well, that's
what's happening.

1213
01:03:59,425 --> 01:04:01,967
This is where your sources
told you they'd be?

1214
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:05,883
No, this is where
my sources said
we might find an answer.

1215
01:04:16,967 --> 01:04:18,842
She must be familiar
with your work.

1216
01:04:18,842 --> 01:04:20,467
Excuse me.

1217
01:04:20,467 --> 01:04:22,800
Miss, have you seen
these people?

1218
01:04:34,342 --> 01:04:36,675
She says her grandson
spoke to their leader.

1219
01:04:36,717 --> 01:04:37,883
He's in the back.

1220
01:04:38,592 --> 01:04:39,842
What?

1221
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:41,800
No "Wow,
you speak Mandarin"?

1222
01:05:13,425 --> 01:05:15,592
The Coffin
to the Beyond.

1223
01:05:16,883 --> 01:05:19,425
It was always a flap,

1224
01:05:19,425 --> 01:05:21,633
or a trap or mirrors.

1225
01:05:22,717 --> 01:05:25,633
The audience thought
he'd just disappeared.

1226
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:30,300
But he was always
hidden somewhere inside.

1227
01:05:41,758 --> 01:05:46,592
I believe that's
the prototype for the one
your father had made.

1228
01:05:46,592 --> 01:05:47,842
He, like many others
over the years,

1229
01:05:47,842 --> 01:05:49,050
ordered his supplies
from here.

1230
01:05:52,008 --> 01:05:53,842
Of course.

1231
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:55,717
That's why
you gave me the look

1232
01:05:55,717 --> 01:05:57,675
when I said
they were in Macau.

1233
01:05:57,675 --> 01:05:59,842
Your father
used to come here
when you were young.

1234
01:05:59,842 --> 01:06:01,717
Can I please get
some space here?

1235
01:06:07,008 --> 01:06:09,633
You think you're
the only one who'd
wondered for 30 years

1236
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,425
what happened?

1237
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:13,008
You're not.

1238
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,550
Lionel was
a master magician.

1239
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:17,008
Either he gamed the hinges,

1240
01:06:17,008 --> 01:06:20,675
so he could kick the door
and they would pop out,

1241
01:06:20,717 --> 01:06:23,300
or he had access
to the lock
from the inside

1242
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:24,592
so he could pick it.

1243
01:06:24,592 --> 01:06:26,300
Word is

1244
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:29,425
the safe was made
from cheap metal,
and it bowed.

1245
01:06:29,425 --> 01:06:34,967
Still, he always had
something up his sleeve.

1246
01:06:34,967 --> 01:06:39,008
Unless he'd
reached the limit
of his capabilities

1247
01:06:39,050 --> 01:06:41,758
and his clock ran out.

1248
01:06:46,425 --> 01:06:48,300
Excuse me.

1249
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:50,633
My grandmother
has something
you might want.

1250
01:06:54,758 --> 01:06:56,967
This was your father's.

1251
01:06:56,967 --> 01:06:59,383
He had several
of these made.

1252
01:07:18,633 --> 01:07:19,675
And the Horsemen?

1253
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:23,425
I overheard
them talking.

1254
01:07:23,425 --> 01:07:26,342
One of them, Atlas,
he's meeting someone

1255
01:07:26,383 --> 01:07:27,842
at the market nearby.

1256
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:46,758
As for
former Agent Rhodes,

1257
01:07:46,758 --> 01:07:49,508
his location is now
your number one priority.

1258
01:07:49,508 --> 01:07:51,675
We're putting out
an international APB.

1259
01:07:51,717 --> 01:07:54,008
including cooperation
from local authorities.

1260
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:55,842
Agent Cowan.

1261
01:07:55,842 --> 01:07:57,675
I'm assuming it was
actually not you

1262
01:07:57,717 --> 01:07:59,508
who walked into
Newburgh Federal Prison,

1263
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:02,508
then walked out
30 minutes later
with Thaddeus Bradley?

1264
01:08:02,508 --> 01:08:04,508
What?
He used your ID.

1265
01:08:08,508 --> 01:08:10,550
What are you doing,
Rhodes?

1266
01:08:37,842 --> 01:08:39,967
Atlas, hey.
Dylan.

1267
01:08:39,967 --> 01:08:41,633
I blew it, I'm sorry.
What are you doing here?

1268
01:08:41,633 --> 01:08:42,842
I'm here to help now.

1269
01:08:42,883 --> 01:08:44,383
Okay, we definitely
don't need your help.

1270
01:08:44,383 --> 01:08:45,675
I know I messed up,
all right?

1271
01:08:45,717 --> 01:08:47,300
Yeah, you put everybody's
lives in danger.

1272
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:49,675
Where is everybody?
Where is everybody?

1273
01:08:49,717 --> 01:08:51,425
I can't be seen
with you actually,
right now.

1274
01:08:51,425 --> 01:08:53,008
I got it now, okay?
I appreciate you taking

1275
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:54,342
the time to take control
for a little while.

1276
01:08:54,383 --> 01:08:55,550
Hey, I'm actually...
Yeah?

1277
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:57,300
Yeah, but I got it now,
all right? Yeah.

1278
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,967
You do?
You look like you can
get some rest, buddy.

1279
01:08:58,967 --> 01:09:00,508
Who you meeting here?

1280
01:09:00,508 --> 01:09:01,883
I'm not meeting anybody.

1281
01:09:01,883 --> 01:09:03,508
They told me at Iong's
you were meeting somebody.

1282
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:05,508
At Iong's?

1283
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:07,342
Okay, yeah,
no, I am, um...

1284
01:09:08,425 --> 01:09:10,842
I'm meeting somebody
from the Eye.

1285
01:09:10,842 --> 01:09:15,342
to exchange
this computer chip
for our lives back.

1286
01:09:15,342 --> 01:09:18,508
I hope you're happy
with the situation
you've put us in.

1287
01:09:18,508 --> 01:09:19,967
You're talking
to the Eye?

1288
01:09:19,967 --> 01:09:21,300
Yeah.

1289
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:23,008
Why are you talking
to the Eye?

1290
01:09:23,967 --> 01:09:25,550
Atlas.

1291
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:26,967
Atlas,
give me the stick.

1292
01:09:26,967 --> 01:09:29,508
Dylan, you're not our
leader anymore, okay?

1293
01:09:29,508 --> 01:09:30,842
You're not our hero.

1294
01:09:30,842 --> 01:09:32,300
You're not FBI.

1295
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,633
You're not
a magician.

1296
01:09:33,633 --> 01:09:35,300
You're not
really anything.

1297
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:37,967
And we trusted you
for a year.

1298
01:09:37,967 --> 01:09:40,633
So if you really
wanna help us...

1299
01:09:40,633 --> 01:09:43,383
If you really
wanna help us,
you would leave.

1300
01:09:51,675 --> 01:09:53,842
I get it. Cool.

1301
01:09:53,842 --> 01:09:54,883
Bye.

1302
01:10:12,633 --> 01:10:16,342
Yeah, that was me you called
at the magic shop.

1303
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,800
So much fun though,

1304
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,342
knowing you'd
be scurrying away
from me at the lab

1305
01:10:20,342 --> 01:10:21,633
just to bring it
to me here.

1306
01:10:21,633 --> 01:10:23,508
Did you actually
think I'd let you go?

1307
01:10:23,508 --> 01:10:24,675
How did you do that?

1308
01:10:24,717 --> 01:10:26,300
Everyone has their button.

1309
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:27,675
You push it
and they go blind.

1310
01:10:27,717 --> 01:10:29,758
And yours,
obviously, is ego.

1311
01:10:30,508 --> 01:10:31,842
"Stay the course.

1312
01:10:31,842 --> 01:10:34,675
<i>"Great changes</i>
<i>are in store.</i>

1313
01:10:34,717 --> 01:10:37,342
<i>"Trust that</i>
<i>your unique talents</i>

1314
01:10:37,383 --> 01:10:38,883
"will not go
unrecognized."

1315
01:10:40,008 --> 01:10:41,675
That was you.
Yeah.

1316
01:10:41,675 --> 01:10:43,300
Merritt downloaded
all the files,

1317
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,967
but how do you think
we were able to find him?

1318
01:10:48,967 --> 01:10:51,008
I asked to see the face
behind all of this.

1319
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:53,967
What you actually
put your phone on
was a bi-wave siphon pad.

1320
01:10:55,675 --> 01:10:57,842
<i>Once again,</i>

1321
01:10:57,842 --> 01:11:00,425
science beats magic.

1322
01:11:00,425 --> 01:11:02,758
So, the stick?
No.

1323
01:11:05,758 --> 01:11:06,842
I got it!

1324
01:11:06,842 --> 01:11:08,425
I got it. I got it.

1325
01:11:10,383 --> 01:11:12,342
Fuck, Dylan!
Wait, leave them!

1326
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,842
You really think
I'm gonna walk away
from you?

1327
01:11:13,842 --> 01:11:15,967
Give me the stick!

1328
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:19,008
All right. Don't ever
question me again.

1329
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:20,300
Beat it!

1330
01:11:31,508 --> 01:11:33,633
So, the stick.
Go to hell.

1331
01:11:34,425 --> 01:11:35,467
Boys.

1332
01:11:47,758 --> 01:11:49,758
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1333
01:12:05,883 --> 01:12:07,508
There's like 10 of you.

1334
01:12:07,508 --> 01:12:09,383
Come on,
he's just doing tricks.

1335
01:12:09,383 --> 01:12:11,342
He's there!
Go!

1336
01:13:34,717 --> 01:13:38,758
Dylan, watch
the pretty birdies fly.
And sleep.

1337
01:13:39,842 --> 01:13:40,925
Doesn't work on me.

1338
01:13:40,925 --> 01:13:43,342
Not even
as a distraction?

1339
01:13:45,842 --> 01:13:48,550
Good job.
Nice to be involved.

1340
01:13:56,675 --> 01:13:58,800
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

1341
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,425
I just saw Dylan.
Um, something happened.

1342
01:14:00,425 --> 01:14:01,550
What do you mean
you just saw Dylan?

1343
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:03,633
Dylan's here?
What happened?

1344
01:14:03,633 --> 01:14:06,050
- Atlas.
- I don't know.

1345
01:14:10,883 --> 01:14:12,300
What are they doing?

1346
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,675
Those are Walter's men.

1347
01:14:14,717 --> 01:14:17,842
This is what they want.

1348
01:14:17,842 --> 01:14:20,050
What the hell?
How do you
still have that?

1349
01:14:24,967 --> 01:14:26,842
Whoa. That's
Lionel Shrike's safe.

1350
01:14:26,842 --> 01:14:29,508
What the hell
do they want with that?

1351
01:14:29,508 --> 01:14:31,342
Okay, we gotta
follow that truck.

1352
01:14:31,342 --> 01:14:34,675
They must have Dylan.
We don't have much time.

1353
01:14:38,967 --> 01:14:40,425
What do you want?

1354
01:14:40,425 --> 01:14:44,008
You to understand something
very important.

1355
01:14:44,967 --> 01:14:46,633
We

1356
01:14:46,633 --> 01:14:48,425
are mirror images.

1357
01:14:48,425 --> 01:14:52,008
I share
a very deep connection
with my father.

1358
01:14:53,467 --> 01:14:55,967
And like you,
I'll stop at nothing

1359
01:14:55,967 --> 01:14:58,467
to avenge any wrongs
done to him.

1360
01:15:02,925 --> 01:15:06,633
You know the only difference
between your father and mine?

1361
01:15:06,633 --> 01:15:08,592
Mine's still alive.

1362
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,508
Get him up.

1363
01:15:23,842 --> 01:15:25,550
So,

1364
01:15:25,550 --> 01:15:28,383
this is the man

1365
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:31,508
who spent a lifetime
plotting against me.

1366
01:15:33,508 --> 01:15:35,800
I wouldn't have
known your face

1367
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:39,467
if it had been on a billboard
outside my bedroom window.

1368
01:15:39,467 --> 01:15:41,675
But you have spent,
what, 30 years

1369
01:15:41,717 --> 01:15:43,050
thinking about mine?

1370
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:44,675
When my father died,

1371
01:15:44,717 --> 01:15:46,675
your insurance company
denied my mother her claims.

1372
01:15:46,717 --> 01:15:48,008
I wouldn't
even have known...
She died a pauper!

1373
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:49,967
...who your mother was.

1374
01:15:49,967 --> 01:15:51,008
She was a digit,

1375
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:54,675
a nanobyte
in a stream of data.

1376
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:56,675
Because nothing
is personal to you

1377
01:15:56,675 --> 01:15:58,925
and everyone and everything
is just a number,
isn't that so?

1378
01:15:58,925 --> 01:16:01,675
That is where
you are wrong,
Mr. Rhodes.

1379
01:16:01,717 --> 01:16:06,675
Once you made yourself known
it became very personal.

1380
01:16:07,842 --> 01:16:09,758
My son...
Yeah, the sociopath.

1381
01:16:09,758 --> 01:16:11,300
Funny thing is,

1382
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,550
I have seven so-called
legitimate children.

1383
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:16,050
Sniveling, snobbish,

1384
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:17,967
stupid runts.

1385
01:16:17,967 --> 01:16:21,550
I have one illegitimate child
who is a lot like me.

1386
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:23,925
The point is,
he wants something,

1387
01:16:23,925 --> 01:16:25,633
and like any good parent,

1388
01:16:25,633 --> 01:16:28,008
I will stop at nothing

1389
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:29,342
to get it for him.

1390
01:16:29,342 --> 01:16:31,008
Your Horsemen have it.

1391
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:33,550
You will turn it and them

1392
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:35,508
over to us, now.

1393
01:16:35,508 --> 01:16:36,675
No.

1394
01:16:40,383 --> 01:16:42,967
Dylan, I would
like you to really
take this moment

1395
01:16:42,967 --> 01:16:44,675
because this is
the consequence

1396
01:16:44,717 --> 01:16:46,675
of your personal
vendetta come to life

1397
01:16:46,675 --> 01:16:48,550
and staring you
in the face.

1398
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:50,300
I want you to know
that when you're gone,

1399
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:53,675
We're gonna destroy
everything you believe in,

1400
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:55,842
starting with the Horsemen,
and ending with the Eye.

1401
01:16:55,842 --> 01:16:57,758
Now then,
cast your mind back

1402
01:16:57,758 --> 01:17:00,925
to standing by
the banks of the river
watching your father descend,

1403
01:17:00,925 --> 01:17:02,967
disgraced and discredited.

1404
01:17:02,967 --> 01:17:05,842
The horrid psychic pain
as you have relived for years.

1405
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:08,675
I felt that same thing

1406
01:17:08,717 --> 01:17:11,550
as you drained not
just my father's fortune,

1407
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:13,633
but his dignity!

1408
01:17:13,633 --> 01:17:15,675
And yet you took
pleasure from it.

1409
01:17:18,508 --> 01:17:21,008
This should bring back
some childhood memories.

1410
01:17:48,467 --> 01:17:50,425
Would you like
some tea?
Thank you.

1411
01:18:05,842 --> 01:18:08,342
You ready?
Over to you.

1412
01:18:15,342 --> 01:18:16,425
Splash!

1413
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,342
Job done!

1414
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,842
Hell is going
to seem like
a day at the spa

1415
01:18:39,842 --> 01:18:42,800
by the time we're through
with these Horsemen.

1416
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,592
- Wouldn't you say?
- You had me at "hell."

1417
01:19:02,425 --> 01:19:04,800
<i>I love you so much.</i>

1418
01:19:07,383 --> 01:19:09,758
Always keep something
up my sleeve.

1419
01:20:28,550 --> 01:20:31,675
I wish I could dredge
from the muck of my soul

1420
01:20:31,675 --> 01:20:33,842
one speck of remorse,

1421
01:20:33,842 --> 01:20:35,800
but I can't.

1422
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:39,050
So I'll stick to
the business at hand

1423
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:41,633
and try not to smile
too broadly.

1424
01:20:42,383 --> 01:20:45,300
And, thank you

1425
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:47,675
for delivering
Mr. Dylan Rhodes.

1426
01:20:48,467 --> 01:20:50,342
I take it it's done.

1427
01:20:51,508 --> 01:20:53,550
Literally hit
the bottom.

1428
01:20:53,967 --> 01:20:55,008
Now,

1429
01:20:55,967 --> 01:20:57,758
where are the Horsemen?

1430
01:20:57,758 --> 01:20:59,758
They're performers.

1431
01:20:59,758 --> 01:21:02,008
Their pride, their ego...

1432
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:05,508
Their need to be adored
are all too powerful

1433
01:21:05,508 --> 01:21:07,425
to keep them out of
the limelight for long.

1434
01:21:07,425 --> 01:21:10,633
If they don't make
themselves known,

1435
01:21:10,633 --> 01:21:12,925
you will find yourself

1436
01:21:12,925 --> 01:21:15,425
in a very similar position

1437
01:21:15,425 --> 01:21:16,967
to Mr. Rhodes.

1438
01:21:16,967 --> 01:21:18,800
Are we clear about that?

1439
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,883
As clear as the water
he's under.

1440
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:30,050
You'll have the rest

1441
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:31,925
when I have the Horsemen.

1442
01:22:04,008 --> 01:22:05,342
Dylan!

1443
01:22:06,633 --> 01:22:08,967
Dylan, come on,
buddy, breathe!

1444
01:22:08,967 --> 01:22:10,425
- Dylan.
- Dylan?

1445
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,550
Dylan, come on!

1446
01:22:16,675 --> 01:22:19,508
You're okay.

1447
01:22:19,508 --> 01:22:22,342
Jesus! You scared
the hell out of us, man.

1448
01:22:22,342 --> 01:22:23,550
Are you all right, bro?

1449
01:22:23,842 --> 01:22:25,967
Okay!

1450
01:22:25,967 --> 01:22:27,967
Thank you!
This is the least
I could do.

1451
01:22:27,967 --> 01:22:29,967
No. There's a hell of a lot
less you could've done.

1452
01:22:29,967 --> 01:22:31,467
That was not an option.

1453
01:22:31,467 --> 01:22:33,425
You took a bullet
for us, it was huge.

1454
01:22:33,425 --> 01:22:34,717
You really did, man.

1455
01:22:37,967 --> 01:22:39,758
Thanks for
pulling me out.
Seriously.

1456
01:22:40,675 --> 01:22:42,008
Yeah.

1457
01:22:42,008 --> 01:22:44,342
You got yourself out.
We did the easy part.

1458
01:22:44,342 --> 01:22:45,967
Literally, in my case,

1459
01:22:45,967 --> 01:22:47,342
I was just standing
on the shore while
Atlas jumped down

1460
01:22:47,342 --> 01:22:48,425
and got you.

1461
01:22:48,425 --> 01:22:50,008
I'm serious.

1462
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:51,967
Hey, you guys.
Something's not right.

1463
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,425
- What's wrong?
- What?

1464
01:22:55,425 --> 01:22:56,508
It's fake.

1465
01:22:56,508 --> 01:22:57,758
What?

1466
01:22:59,467 --> 01:23:00,967
No, I had the stick.

1467
01:23:00,967 --> 01:23:03,050
The actual stick.
I swear, it was in my hand.

1468
01:23:03,050 --> 01:23:05,675
In the lab.
And then I put it in
the little case thing.

1469
01:23:05,675 --> 01:23:06,842
And I gave it to Atlas.

1470
01:23:06,842 --> 01:23:10,842
Is there any
chance you've possibly
misplaced it at any point?

1471
01:23:10,842 --> 01:23:14,842
I took it from you
and then slipped it
back in your coat

1472
01:23:14,842 --> 01:23:16,842
when I pushed you out.

1473
01:23:16,842 --> 01:23:19,675
Either way, we're
left holding a whole
sack full of nada.

1474
01:23:19,675 --> 01:23:22,425
Yeah, but they're gonna
come after us as if
we do have something.

1475
01:23:22,425 --> 01:23:24,675
No. Okay.
I agree that somebody
got the better of us.

1476
01:23:24,675 --> 01:23:28,383
But I don't agree
that we have a sack
full of nada.

1477
01:23:28,383 --> 01:23:29,592
Because we're all here.

1478
01:23:29,592 --> 01:23:31,592
That's a sack
full of something.

1479
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:39,342
We all know that Walter
is not going to stop
until he gets that chip.

1480
01:23:39,342 --> 01:23:42,842
And we're the only ones that
even know that he's alive.

1481
01:23:42,842 --> 01:23:45,550
We can't just walk away.

1482
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:47,592
That's not what
the Horsemen do.

1483
01:23:50,342 --> 01:23:52,050
There's a quote. Um...

1484
01:23:52,050 --> 01:23:53,675
It's actually
by the magician

1485
01:23:53,675 --> 01:23:55,467
that made me wanna do this
in the first place.

1486
01:23:55,467 --> 01:23:57,467
It's...

1487
01:23:57,467 --> 01:24:01,800
"A magician's greatest power
lies forever shrouded

1488
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,050
"in his empty fist."

1489
01:24:04,050 --> 01:24:06,592
"And the very idea
that he can convince
the world

1490
01:24:06,592 --> 01:24:09,758
"that he is, in fact,
carrying with him a secret."

1491
01:24:09,758 --> 01:24:11,425
That's Lionel Shrike.

1492
01:24:11,425 --> 01:24:12,508
Right.

1493
01:24:13,842 --> 01:24:17,758
That we should pretend like
we have something we don't?

1494
01:24:21,383 --> 01:24:22,883
What is Walter's
greatest fear?

1495
01:24:23,508 --> 01:24:25,342
Being seen.

1496
01:24:25,342 --> 01:24:26,550
And what does
the stick do?

1497
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:28,842
The stick can
unencode anything.

1498
01:24:28,842 --> 01:24:32,300
It can open up a back door
into any computer

1499
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:33,842
on the planet.

1500
01:24:33,842 --> 01:24:35,675
Including his.
Yeah.

1501
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:39,967
Right, we not only make him
think that we have it,

1502
01:24:39,967 --> 01:24:44,300
but that we're going to use it
to expose and destroy him.

1503
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:45,425
We need a plan.

1504
01:24:45,425 --> 01:24:47,675
But we don't have time.

1505
01:24:47,675 --> 01:24:51,300
We have each other and
there are five of us.

1506
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:54,342
But we also
need supplies, right?
And resources.

1507
01:24:54,342 --> 01:24:57,550
And probably more
than five people.

1508
01:24:57,550 --> 01:25:01,508
Do you really think
you don't have help?

1509
01:25:01,508 --> 01:25:04,383
She speaks English.
Of course. Yeah.

1510
01:25:04,383 --> 01:25:09,800
Do you know why
the Fool is the most
powerful card in the tarot?

1511
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:13,550
Not because the person
who draws him is a fool.

1512
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:15,050
He's a fool

1513
01:25:15,050 --> 01:25:17,967
because he's a clean slate,

1514
01:25:17,967 --> 01:25:20,508
and, therefore, can become

1515
01:25:20,508 --> 01:25:21,967
anything.

1516
01:25:21,967 --> 01:25:23,467
You were chosen.

1517
01:25:24,008 --> 01:25:25,925
All of you.

1518
01:25:25,925 --> 01:25:28,508
Not because of
who you are,

1519
01:25:28,508 --> 01:25:31,342
but because of who
you might become.

1520
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,008
When you say "chosen"...

1521
01:25:34,008 --> 01:25:36,675
Are you part of
the Eye?

1522
01:25:36,675 --> 01:25:37,842
Yes.

1523
01:25:37,842 --> 01:25:40,842
We are part of
the Eye.

1524
01:25:40,842 --> 01:25:44,050
You've each
doubted our existence.

1525
01:25:44,842 --> 01:25:46,717
Wondering

1526
01:25:46,717 --> 01:25:49,342
if we, indeed,
were watching.

1527
01:25:52,842 --> 01:25:54,383
We are.

1528
01:25:54,383 --> 01:25:56,508
We always have been.

1529
01:25:56,508 --> 01:25:59,008
This is the best
magic shop in the world.

1530
01:25:59,008 --> 01:26:00,300
You know what
she's saying, right?

1531
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:01,425
Yes.

1532
01:26:01,425 --> 01:26:03,758
That now we have
resources and help.

1533
01:26:05,592 --> 01:26:06,925
Thank you.

1534
01:26:09,425 --> 01:26:11,050
So, who's in?

1535
01:26:14,842 --> 01:26:16,300
I'm in.

1536
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,592
Yeah, I'm in.

1537
01:26:20,383 --> 01:26:21,467
Let's do this.

1538
01:26:38,967 --> 01:26:40,758
No, no, no.

1539
01:26:43,425 --> 01:26:45,550
<i>Not long ago,</i>
<i>we were tricked.</i>

1540
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:48,592
<i>I was exposed</i>
<i>and brought back</i>
<i>from the dead.</i>

1541
01:26:48,592 --> 01:26:51,467
<i>So we thought</i>
<i>it was only fitting</i>
<i>that we do the same thing</i>

1542
01:26:51,467 --> 01:26:53,383
<i>to the person</i>
<i>who did it to us.</i>

1543
01:26:53,383 --> 01:26:55,842
<i>Midnight, New Year's Eve.</i>
<i>London.</i>

1544
01:26:55,842 --> 01:26:57,592
<i>We will be performing</i>
<i>a series of shows</i>

1545
01:26:57,592 --> 01:26:59,300
<i>that all connect</i>
<i>to our big finale,</i>

1546
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:01,467
<i>so pay close attention</i>
<i>to each trick.</i>

1547
01:27:01,467 --> 01:27:02,633
Get my father.

1548
01:27:04,675 --> 01:27:09,008
I want Interpol,
Scotland Yard,
whoever we have in London.

1549
01:27:09,008 --> 01:27:10,467
What do we know
about Rhodes?

1550
01:27:10,467 --> 01:27:12,425
Wherever the Horsemen are,
that's where he is.

1551
01:27:12,425 --> 01:27:19,300
<i>because we, too, will bring</i>
<i>someone back from the dead.</i>

1552
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,967
Let's move, everyone!

1553
01:27:20,967 --> 01:27:22,967
<i>In front of</i>
<i>the largest stage</i>
<i>in the world...</i>

1554
01:27:22,967 --> 01:27:24,967
<i>The actual world.</i>

1555
01:27:24,967 --> 01:27:27,008
You know they're
playing you, right?

1556
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:28,842
Leading you into a trap?

1557
01:27:28,842 --> 01:27:30,717
Yeah, but the threat
is real.

1558
01:27:30,717 --> 01:27:33,383
This card can hack into
any system on the planet,
including ours.

1559
01:27:33,383 --> 01:27:35,675
They have it, why wouldn't
they use it to expose us?

1560
01:27:35,675 --> 01:27:37,342
Me. Everything we've done.

1561
01:27:37,342 --> 01:27:39,425
Is it real,
Mr. McKinney?

1562
01:27:46,675 --> 01:27:47,925
The threat is real.

1563
01:27:47,925 --> 01:27:50,383
So, how do we stay
ahead of them?

1564
01:27:50,383 --> 01:27:52,758
We need to get
to London by midnight.

1565
01:28:01,425 --> 01:28:05,550
<i>on this New Year's Eve, and</i>
<i>the crowds are out in force.</i>

1566
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:06,967
<i>Locals and tourists alike</i>

1567
01:28:06,967 --> 01:28:09,342
<i>getting ready for</i>
<i>the party of the year.</i>

1568
01:28:09,342 --> 01:28:11,342
<i>A video gone viral</i>
<i>from the infamous</i>

1569
01:28:11,342 --> 01:28:13,300
<i>Horsemen magicians</i>
<i>has surfaced.</i>

1570
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:18,050
<i>But will</i>
<i>it end in their arrest</i>
<i>on national television?</i>

1571
01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:19,842
<i>Or some sort of vindication?</i>

1572
01:28:19,842 --> 01:28:25,883
<i>But we do</i>
<i>know, wherever, whenever that</i>
<i>is, people will be watching.</i>

1573
01:28:28,425 --> 01:28:30,675
Yeah, texts, tweets,
Instagrams.

1574
01:28:30,675 --> 01:28:33,425
Anything that says
"Horsemen," brags about
seeing the Horsemen,

1575
01:28:33,425 --> 01:28:35,050
tag them and bundle them.

1576
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:37,592
Dad, who do we have
security-wise on this?
Your guys?

1577
01:28:37,592 --> 01:28:40,425
Well, we want all of them
and all their friends.

1578
01:28:40,425 --> 01:28:44,800
stationed throughout the city,
so they can be anywhere
in 60 seconds.

1579
01:28:58,925 --> 01:29:01,383
Hello! Hey!

1580
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:05,800
My name's Jack Wilder.

1581
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,842
Goddamn,
it feels good
to be back.

1582
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:10,342
All right,
gather around.

1583
01:29:10,342 --> 01:29:14,300
I wanna talk to you about
something real quick.

1584
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:17,758
You all know Three Card Monte,
also known as "Find the Lady"?

1585
01:29:17,758 --> 01:29:22,050
Trick performed by street
hustlers all over the world.
And why street hustlers?

1586
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:24,675
Because as soon as you walk up
to the table, you lose.

1587
01:29:24,675 --> 01:29:26,800
Every time.
Let me demonstrate.

1588
01:29:27,883 --> 01:29:33,717
While we're at it,
let's find ourselves
a life-sized Queen.

1589
01:29:33,717 --> 01:29:35,758
Ma'am, would you
mind being my Queen?

1590
01:29:38,967 --> 01:29:40,925
Don't worry.
I promise you

1591
01:29:40,925 --> 01:29:42,800
there's a 50% chance
you'll get her back
after the show.

1592
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,675
Head over there.
Thank you very much.

1593
01:29:44,675 --> 01:29:48,342
All right. Let's find
ourselves some Jacks
to serve our Queen!

1594
01:29:48,342 --> 01:29:49,633
<i>Trust me, gentlemen.</i>

1595
01:29:49,633 --> 01:29:51,842
I know how
these guys work now.

1596
01:29:51,842 --> 01:29:53,508
They're gonna start
with a tease.

1597
01:29:53,508 --> 01:29:55,550
A few little pop-ups.

1598
01:29:55,550 --> 01:29:58,508
<i>Something to</i>
<i>lure you in. Like...</i>

1599
01:29:58,508 --> 01:30:02,675
Well, you know...
Like Three Card Monte,
where the guy goes,

1600
01:30:02,675 --> 01:30:05,383
"Looky here,
but no, no, looky here!"

1601
01:30:05,383 --> 01:30:09,383
<i>Except when all these</i>
<i>little tricks are done,</i>

1602
01:30:09,383 --> 01:30:11,508
<i>the only thing</i>
<i>you're gonna be looking at</i>

1603
01:30:11,508 --> 01:30:15,592
is the inside of your own
colon, with the words

1604
01:30:15,592 --> 01:30:18,592
<i>"Horsemen"</i>
<i>written all over it.</i>

1605
01:30:19,342 --> 01:30:20,842
In blood.

1606
01:30:20,842 --> 01:30:24,467
We get the picture,
Mr. McKinney.

1607
01:30:24,467 --> 01:30:26,842
And get out
of my chair.

1608
01:30:26,842 --> 01:30:28,800
<i>Hello, everybody!</i>

1609
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,842
<i>Come close, come on!</i>

1610
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:32,842
All right,
all right, so listen.

1611
01:30:32,842 --> 01:30:36,633
Tonight, I am going
to make something fly

1612
01:30:36,633 --> 01:30:38,467
using actual magic.

1613
01:30:38,467 --> 01:30:40,342
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

1614
01:30:40,342 --> 01:30:43,425
I'm going to take
a very large vessel,

1615
01:30:43,425 --> 01:30:47,675
I'm gonna make
it fly over there
and land on the Thames.

1616
01:30:47,675 --> 01:30:49,675
Can you handle that?

1617
01:30:49,675 --> 01:30:51,383
Same rules
apply as before.

1618
01:30:51,383 --> 01:30:53,508
All you need to do is
keep your eye on the Queen.

1619
01:30:53,508 --> 01:30:54,842
It's as simple as that.

1620
01:30:54,842 --> 01:30:56,675
- Are you guys ready?
- Yeah!

1621
01:30:56,675 --> 01:30:59,508
Dad, look at this.

1622
01:30:59,508 --> 01:31:02,675
Near the river. Looks like
the shows are starting.

1623
01:31:02,675 --> 01:31:04,675
But we're not the only ones
who found them.

1624
01:31:04,675 --> 01:31:06,383
What do you mean?
It's on Channel One.

1625
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:15,842
- Let's go to 2.
- Here we go.

1626
01:31:15,842 --> 01:31:18,550
Got him.
We have a location.

1627
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:20,550
It's Jack Wilder.
Here come the Horsemen.

1628
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:22,592
Okay, we're moving.
Let's go, let's go.

1629
01:31:26,008 --> 01:31:28,758
Turn around.
Hide yourselves
with the cards.

1630
01:31:29,425 --> 01:31:31,550
And here we go.

1631
01:31:33,967 --> 01:31:35,383
You guys still
have your eye on her?

1632
01:31:35,383 --> 01:31:36,383
You want me to
go back and do it?

1633
01:31:36,383 --> 01:31:37,842
Okay, all right.
I'm moving on.

1634
01:31:37,842 --> 01:31:39,508
And switch.

1635
01:31:41,425 --> 01:31:42,508
Where is she?

1636
01:31:43,717 --> 01:31:45,842
Down at the end?
You sure?

1637
01:31:45,842 --> 01:31:48,717
All right,
can I get a drumroll
from my man in the back?

1638
01:31:48,717 --> 01:31:50,342
Thank you very much.

1639
01:31:56,550 --> 01:31:59,008
There's my girl.

1640
01:31:59,008 --> 01:32:01,508
Not my girl.
100% your girl.

1641
01:32:01,508 --> 01:32:03,300
But just
in this situation.

1642
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:05,842
Okay, but I gotta warm up
a little bit first. Okay?

1643
01:32:05,842 --> 01:32:09,842
So, let me just
make something small
fly, like...

1644
01:32:09,842 --> 01:32:11,967
Fly, fly, fly!

1645
01:32:11,967 --> 01:32:13,800
Wow, right?
Look at that!

1646
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,592
Aw. Come on, people.

1647
01:32:15,592 --> 01:32:18,550
Tough crowd. You, fly!

1648
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:19,758
Me?
Check your fly.

1649
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:24,842
You like that?

1650
01:32:24,842 --> 01:32:26,842
You support
that relationship?

1651
01:32:26,842 --> 01:32:29,800
That guy had
a bird in his pants.
That's disgusting.

1652
01:32:33,467 --> 01:32:35,550
<i>Copy that. We've got</i>
<i>two sightings reported.</i>

1653
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:38,550
<i>Heading to Greenwich Market.</i>
<i>Get me Thaddeus.</i>

1654
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:40,842
<i>Thaddeus, the FBI are here.</i>
<i>They're moving.</i>

1655
01:32:40,842 --> 01:32:42,592
<i>Let 'em move.</i>

1656
01:32:42,592 --> 01:32:45,800
Well, what if they
get there first?
That can't happen.

1657
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:47,967
<i>I guarantee you, they won't.</i>

1658
01:32:47,967 --> 01:32:49,383
Find the pattern.

1659
01:32:50,300 --> 01:32:51,592
You do that,

1660
01:32:51,592 --> 01:32:53,675
and you'll be able
to cut them off

1661
01:32:53,675 --> 01:32:55,675
<i>before they get to</i>
<i>their final trick.</i>

1662
01:32:55,675 --> 01:32:57,342
If it makes you feel better,

1663
01:32:57,342 --> 01:32:59,508
I'll take care of the FBI.

1664
01:33:13,675 --> 01:33:15,300
I guess you found me!

1665
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:16,800
We've got a third spot.

1666
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,467
Okay, everybody,
we're getting a pattern.

1667
01:33:21,675 --> 01:33:23,675
Um... Give me 2,

1668
01:33:24,925 --> 01:33:26,800
13 and 21.

1669
01:33:27,842 --> 01:33:28,883
What the hell is that?

1670
01:33:29,675 --> 01:33:30,758
Freeze that and zoom in.

1671
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,675
How the hell
did this happen?

1672
01:33:35,675 --> 01:33:38,883
He's dead.
We watched him drown.
How the hell did this happen?

1673
01:33:38,883 --> 01:33:41,300
Given that it did happen,
the pertinent question is,

1674
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:42,550
what are we
gonna do about it?

1675
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:43,967
We're gonna stop him, Dad.
We'll stop him.

1676
01:33:43,967 --> 01:33:45,633
Where's my coat?

1677
01:33:45,633 --> 01:33:48,467
Walter, for the record,
I never loved the safe idea.

1678
01:33:48,467 --> 01:33:49,967
I know
where they're going.

1679
01:33:49,967 --> 01:33:52,675
The next show is Merritt's
and it's by the river.

1680
01:33:52,675 --> 01:33:56,300
so we can find the Horsemen's
entry point for the finale.

1681
01:34:01,842 --> 01:34:03,425
<i>I've a confession to make.</i>

1682
01:34:03,425 --> 01:34:05,675
I've been told I have
some control issues.

1683
01:34:05,675 --> 01:34:09,008
I've learned that it's really,
really hard to control people,

1684
01:34:09,008 --> 01:34:11,008
so I'm gonna try
to control something

1685
01:34:11,008 --> 01:34:13,008
that's a lot
easier than people.

1686
01:34:13,008 --> 01:34:14,550
I'm gonna try to
control the weather.

1687
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:16,717
Yeah, rain, um...

1688
01:34:18,842 --> 01:34:20,592
It'd be a little difficult
to make it rain, right?

1689
01:34:20,592 --> 01:34:23,508
That would be something
that only God can do, right?

1690
01:34:23,508 --> 01:34:25,800
I'm gonna do something
that God can't do.

1691
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:28,717
I'm not just gonna
make it clear up.
No, no, no.

1692
01:34:28,717 --> 01:34:30,883
I'm gonna make
it actually stop.

1693
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:45,467
And can God do that?

1694
01:34:45,467 --> 01:34:47,467
No, I don't think so.

1695
01:34:47,467 --> 01:34:49,800
Or what about make it go up?

1696
01:34:57,467 --> 01:34:59,508
<i>Are you still with me?</i>

1697
01:34:59,508 --> 01:35:01,425
Watch the Queen on the left.
Let's do it.

1698
01:35:01,425 --> 01:35:02,633
Turn around.

1699
01:35:05,842 --> 01:35:07,008
Switch!

1700
01:35:10,717 --> 01:35:11,925
Show me the lady.

1701
01:35:11,925 --> 01:35:14,842
Show me the lady!

1702
01:35:14,842 --> 01:35:16,008
The end? End?

1703
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:20,633
You know what?
I'm actually starting
to feel kinda bad.

1704
01:35:21,675 --> 01:35:23,342
It's just because
I can actually feel

1705
01:35:23,342 --> 01:35:24,800
that you guys are
paying attention.

1706
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:29,300
You know, it's unfortunate
that it's the wrong
kind of attention.

1707
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:33,717
Yeah, we need a fresher bird.

1708
01:35:34,842 --> 01:35:38,008
He's so cute. He's so cute!

1709
01:35:38,008 --> 01:35:40,842
Let's kill him, right?

1710
01:35:40,842 --> 01:35:42,925
Merritt,
move into position.

1711
01:35:42,925 --> 01:35:44,883
Got it, Dylan.

1712
01:35:44,883 --> 01:35:46,675
I'm on my way.
I'll see you there.

1713
01:35:46,675 --> 01:35:49,050
Lula, stand by, all right?

1714
01:35:49,050 --> 01:35:51,592
Or, what about just go,
I don't know, just go insane?

1715
01:36:00,925 --> 01:36:03,342
<i>Reports are coming in</i>
<i>from all over London</i>

1716
01:36:03,342 --> 01:36:07,050
<i>as the Horsemen</i>
<i>appear to have taken over</i>
<i>the whole city for their show.</i>

1717
01:36:10,050 --> 01:36:13,842
Hey, broski-whaddya-knowski?
Where you headed?

1718
01:36:13,842 --> 01:36:15,342
Please, bro, don't do this.
Where are you headed?

1719
01:36:15,342 --> 01:36:17,050
North, south, east?

1720
01:36:17,925 --> 01:36:19,550
East. Tower of London?

1721
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:22,425
Tower Bridge?
Near Tower Bridge?
The Thames!

1722
01:36:22,425 --> 01:36:25,675
You're going to
the Thamesy-Whemsy!

1723
01:36:25,675 --> 01:36:27,508
You're so easy!

1724
01:36:27,508 --> 01:36:29,675
Bro,
if there's any chance of us
ever having a relationship...

1725
01:36:29,675 --> 01:36:32,300
There's not.
Where's your entry?

1726
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:34,508
South Bank? Greenwich?

1727
01:36:34,508 --> 01:36:35,967
Greenwich.

1728
01:36:35,967 --> 01:36:39,008
I know where
you're going. I know where...

1729
01:36:40,967 --> 01:36:42,508
Watch it, hobo.

1730
01:36:45,383 --> 01:36:47,842
Hey, Merritt. Come on.
Tell me you're kidding. How?

1731
01:36:49,592 --> 01:36:50,967
When?

1732
01:36:50,967 --> 01:36:53,717
Shit. All right.
All right, I got it.

1733
01:36:53,717 --> 01:36:55,842
Don't worry about it.
I'll warn the others.

1734
01:36:58,717 --> 01:37:00,508
Sorry. Just...

1735
01:37:03,008 --> 01:37:04,300
What? I just told you...

1736
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:05,342
Phone call.

1737
01:37:06,675 --> 01:37:07,800
- Hello?
<i>- Lula.</i>

1738
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,050
Dylan. Yeah.

1739
01:37:09,050 --> 01:37:11,342
Kind of in the middle
of something right now.

1740
01:37:11,342 --> 01:37:13,467
<i>Wrap it up.</i>
<i>Meet me at</i>
<i>the rendezvous point now.</i>

1741
01:37:13,467 --> 01:37:14,508
What?
<i>Now!</i>

1742
01:37:15,842 --> 01:37:17,842
Was that an act of God?

1743
01:37:17,842 --> 01:37:21,008
No. No, no, no,
that was an act of me

1744
01:37:21,008 --> 01:37:22,508
and the strobe lights

1745
01:37:22,508 --> 01:37:24,383
and rain machines.

1746
01:37:24,383 --> 01:37:26,383
And I hope you guys
were paying attention.

1747
01:37:26,383 --> 01:37:28,550
Because you're
gonna need to know
all of that for the final.

1748
01:37:32,008 --> 01:37:33,800
<i>So how did I do it?</i>

1749
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,300
Did I use a Barry Trap?

1750
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:36,925
Maybe some switches
or a few duplicates?

1751
01:37:36,925 --> 01:37:38,342
<i>Jack, go now!</i>

1752
01:37:38,342 --> 01:37:39,842
You know what?
I hate to say it.

1753
01:37:39,842 --> 01:37:41,675
You're gonna have
to wait to find out.
I know.

1754
01:37:41,675 --> 01:37:43,592
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I love you all.

1755
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:48,675
<i>Lula, go!</i>

1756
01:37:48,675 --> 01:37:50,842
I have to go.

1757
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:11,633
<i>Out of the way, FBI!</i>

1758
01:38:11,633 --> 01:38:13,842
Move, move, move! Go!

1759
01:38:13,842 --> 01:38:15,675
Get some men in that park!

1760
01:38:15,675 --> 01:38:19,008
You gonna
fill up on appetizers?

1761
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:21,800
Or save room for
the main course?

1762
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:23,675
Where the hell
are the Horsemen?

1763
01:38:23,675 --> 01:38:27,592
you're just gonna wind up
holding your own tails.

1764
01:38:28,550 --> 01:38:31,425
Or, you can let them
come to you.

1765
01:38:31,425 --> 01:38:32,967
So, what's it gonna be?

1766
01:38:32,967 --> 01:38:34,342
Chase them?

1767
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:36,633
Or make a deal with me?

1768
01:38:42,925 --> 01:38:44,842
Again? How did we
get found out again?

1769
01:38:44,842 --> 01:38:46,675
It's fine, it's fine.
We'll just cut to the finale.

1770
01:38:46,675 --> 01:38:48,383
Where's Merritt?
Fine. I don't know.

1771
01:38:48,383 --> 01:38:49,425
I'm here.

1772
01:38:49,425 --> 01:38:51,342
Where's Lula?
I'm right here!

1773
01:38:51,342 --> 01:38:53,300
What the hell happened?

1774
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:55,008
My goddamn brother happened.
Don't worry about it.

1775
01:38:55,008 --> 01:38:56,342
We just gotta get
to the destination.

1776
01:38:56,342 --> 01:38:57,425
Lula, can you
handle that thing?

1777
01:38:57,425 --> 01:38:58,883
I can ride it.

1778
01:38:58,883 --> 01:39:00,342
Have you asked the guys
that question, or just me?

1779
01:39:00,342 --> 01:39:01,425
Yeah, good point.

1780
01:39:01,425 --> 01:39:02,842
Let's go!
No, Jack.

1781
01:39:07,842 --> 01:39:08,883
Shit!

1782
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:13,342
Jack's down.
We gotta get him.

1783
01:39:16,592 --> 01:39:17,717
Come on, move!

1784
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:25,467
- Jack! Go, go!
- That's the brake.

1785
01:39:25,467 --> 01:39:27,008
That's the gas.
You'll figure it out.

1786
01:39:27,008 --> 01:39:28,842
Come on, follow me!

1787
01:39:29,967 --> 01:39:31,008
That's it?

1788
01:39:47,675 --> 01:39:49,467
Hey, ready?
Yeah!

1789
01:39:56,050 --> 01:39:57,592
Get on.

1790
01:40:00,842 --> 01:40:01,925
Yeah!

1791
01:40:01,925 --> 01:40:04,467
Okay, guys, I'm coming!
Whoa!

1792
01:40:04,467 --> 01:40:05,842
Jesus!

1793
01:40:07,342 --> 01:40:09,008
I'm coming!

1794
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:19,008
Get up! Come on!
Okay.

1795
01:40:20,425 --> 01:40:21,675
You got me.

1796
01:40:21,675 --> 01:40:23,883
Those things are
really dangerous!

1797
01:40:25,592 --> 01:40:27,342
- Come on!
- Go!

1798
01:40:29,592 --> 01:40:31,800
Get him in! Move it!

1799
01:40:36,300 --> 01:40:37,925
What is happening?

1800
01:40:37,925 --> 01:40:40,342
Where are they?

1801
01:40:40,342 --> 01:40:42,383
They should be
arriving any second.

1802
01:40:43,550 --> 01:40:46,008
That is, if they're gonna
get here by midnight.

1803
01:40:58,342 --> 01:41:00,008
Okay, feeling fear.

1804
01:41:00,925 --> 01:41:02,050
Fear.

1805
01:41:02,050 --> 01:41:03,342
Anger, anger.

1806
01:41:04,425 --> 01:41:05,758
Full house!

1807
01:41:05,758 --> 01:41:07,508
That's enough.

1808
01:41:08,925 --> 01:41:10,508
I was done.

1809
01:41:11,383 --> 01:41:15,508
So nice to see you all again.

1810
01:41:15,508 --> 01:41:18,633
But since we're
such old friends,

1811
01:41:18,633 --> 01:41:21,008
let's skip the formalities.

1812
01:41:21,925 --> 01:41:23,550
One of you

1813
01:41:23,550 --> 01:41:26,800
has something we require.

1814
01:41:28,467 --> 01:41:30,008
So give it over.

1815
01:41:38,425 --> 01:41:40,633
Nothing at all?

1816
01:41:41,758 --> 01:41:42,842
Really?

1817
01:41:45,967 --> 01:41:47,925
Sit down!

1818
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:56,008
Let's go, let's go!

1819
01:41:57,300 --> 01:42:01,342
Hurry up and move them quickly
before they can do anything.

1820
01:42:01,342 --> 01:42:02,592
Get those lights off me!

1821
01:42:08,342 --> 01:42:09,842
Get on the plane!

1822
01:42:11,842 --> 01:42:14,008
Hey!

1823
01:42:16,633 --> 01:42:17,675
Get on the plane!

1824
01:42:27,342 --> 01:42:28,633
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, hey!

1825
01:42:28,633 --> 01:42:30,633
Yeah, 
take off immediately.

1826
01:42:33,842 --> 01:42:36,633
You know, you make it
almost too easy?

1827
01:42:36,633 --> 01:42:38,508
I mean,
even your hilarious attempts

1828
01:42:38,508 --> 01:42:40,425
to make
yourselves unpredictable,

1829
01:42:40,425 --> 01:42:42,383
just follow
the same pattern
each time.

1830
01:42:42,383 --> 01:42:44,425
Set up, set up, set up.

1831
01:42:44,425 --> 01:42:48,300
Which tonight was going
to be stroke of midnight,

1832
01:42:48,300 --> 01:42:50,883
middle of the Thames?
Tell me if I'm warm.

1833
01:42:55,717 --> 01:42:59,633
Well, there will be
a big reveal, and
it will come now.

1834
01:43:01,383 --> 01:43:03,758
The stick, dear boy.

1835
01:43:04,925 --> 01:43:06,342
- No.
- Fine.

1836
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:09,008
Start with her.

1837
01:43:09,008 --> 01:43:11,508
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey!

1838
01:43:13,633 --> 01:43:17,008
Give it to him.
Danny, give him the card.

1839
01:43:17,008 --> 01:43:18,883
- Just give it to him.
- Danny, come on.

1840
01:43:28,883 --> 01:43:30,008
We'll have a closer look.

1841
01:43:38,592 --> 01:43:40,633
Okay, I owe you an apology.

1842
01:43:40,633 --> 01:43:42,467
Leader, you should have
planned an escape, okay?

1843
01:43:42,467 --> 01:43:44,633
This is the both of us.
Okay, it's the both of us.

1844
01:43:44,633 --> 01:43:46,300
Guys, come on!
Come on, stop!

1845
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:48,008
You, to save your
little girlfriend!

1846
01:43:48,008 --> 01:43:50,008
To save my...
He had a knife
to her head!

1847
01:43:50,008 --> 01:43:51,508
I'm a Horseman, you dick!

1848
01:43:51,508 --> 01:43:52,800
All right, you know what?
This is not the time!

1849
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,383
And you,
what's your deal, man?

1850
01:43:54,383 --> 01:43:55,633
Look, they're not
gonna get blood

1851
01:43:55,633 --> 01:43:57,967
They're probably gonna
throw us out of the plane.

1852
01:43:57,967 --> 01:43:59,675
Really?
I'm sorry to interrupt,

1853
01:43:59,675 --> 01:44:01,842
but I just have to
say congratulations.

1854
01:44:01,842 --> 01:44:03,050
And thank you!

1855
01:44:04,675 --> 01:44:05,883
It's real.

1856
01:44:05,883 --> 01:44:07,508
What?

1857
01:44:07,508 --> 01:44:08,967
It's real?

1858
01:44:10,675 --> 01:44:11,758
Bring them through.

1859
01:44:11,758 --> 01:44:12,925
Did you say it's real?

1860
01:44:12,925 --> 01:44:13,967
What is
he talking about?

1861
01:44:13,967 --> 01:44:15,383
Move!

1862
01:44:15,383 --> 01:44:16,842
Well done, my boy.

1863
01:44:20,717 --> 01:44:23,342
Cote Du Marisule champagne.

1864
01:44:23,342 --> 01:44:25,967
It's the most
expensive bottle

1865
01:44:25,967 --> 01:44:27,467
on Earth.

1866
01:44:28,342 --> 01:44:30,508
$1.2 million.

1867
01:44:30,508 --> 01:44:34,550
And I saved it just
for this occasion.

1868
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:38,383
Honestly, same bottle,
Liquor Shack, 700K.

1869
01:44:38,842 --> 01:44:40,633
Hey.

1870
01:44:40,633 --> 01:44:41,967
You got what you wanted.

1871
01:44:41,967 --> 01:44:44,675
So, does this mean
you're letting us go?

1872
01:44:44,675 --> 01:44:47,675
Knowing what you
know about us? No.

1873
01:44:47,675 --> 01:44:48,842
You sure?

1874
01:44:48,842 --> 01:44:50,842
Chase, what shall we do?

1875
01:44:53,008 --> 01:44:55,383
Toss them out.

1876
01:44:55,383 --> 01:44:57,633
Get your last words
in quickly, everybody!

1877
01:44:59,842 --> 01:45:01,842
No! Come on! No!

1878
01:45:01,842 --> 01:45:02,883
Farewell.

1879
01:45:03,675 --> 01:45:05,883
God! No!

1880
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:09,592
Wait! I just wanna say.

1881
01:45:09,592 --> 01:45:11,842
I came into the world
with the wrong family,

1882
01:45:11,842 --> 01:45:13,925
but I'm leaving
with the right one.

1883
01:45:13,925 --> 01:45:15,633
I love you guys!

1884
01:45:15,633 --> 01:45:16,717
No!
No, no, no!

1885
01:45:18,508 --> 01:45:20,925
This is how I kicked
you out of the womb.

1886
01:45:20,925 --> 01:45:22,050
No!

1887
01:45:23,633 --> 01:45:24,925
Who's next?

1888
01:45:31,008 --> 01:45:32,967
No, wait! Let me go!

1889
01:45:32,967 --> 01:45:35,467
Let go of me!

1890
01:45:35,467 --> 01:45:36,883
No, no, no!

1891
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:39,342
Let me go!
Toss her!

1892
01:45:43,633 --> 01:45:44,883
God!

1893
01:45:44,883 --> 01:45:46,342
Hurry up and
shut that door!

1894
01:45:46,342 --> 01:45:47,967
It's getting
cold in here.

1895
01:45:47,967 --> 01:45:49,967
Okay, hit the road, Jack!

1896
01:45:55,508 --> 01:45:56,675
No, no, no!

1897
01:45:57,967 --> 01:46:00,425
A lot of brain,
but not enough brawn.

1898
01:46:04,008 --> 01:46:05,050
That was fun!

1899
01:46:07,883 --> 01:46:09,550
Cheers!

1900
01:46:09,550 --> 01:46:10,967
Well done, my boy.

1901
01:46:15,508 --> 01:46:16,842
Um...

1902
01:46:16,842 --> 01:46:19,050
No, is it supposed
to taste like that?

1903
01:46:19,050 --> 01:46:20,717
No, it is not.

1904
01:46:40,508 --> 01:46:42,008
What the hell
is going on?

1905
01:46:51,967 --> 01:46:53,675
Okay,
come pick them up!

1906
01:46:54,842 --> 01:46:56,675
- Come on.
- Come on out.

1907
01:47:09,925 --> 01:47:11,633
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1908
01:47:11,633 --> 01:47:13,842
<i>The Horsemen!</i>

1909
01:47:34,008 --> 01:47:36,508
<i>No, you should feel pretty</i>
<i>good about yourself, man.</i>

1910
01:47:36,508 --> 01:47:37,800
<i>You predicted it correctly.</i>

1911
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:40,050
<i>The Thames,</i>
<i>stroke of midnight.</i>

1912
01:47:40,050 --> 01:47:41,967
<i>New Year's Eve.</i>
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

1913
01:47:48,925 --> 01:47:51,675
We are moving now.
The whole thing just changed.

1914
01:47:51,675 --> 01:47:54,508
All backup into position stat!
We're on the move.

1915
01:47:55,842 --> 01:47:56,967
You're staying here!

1916
01:47:56,967 --> 01:47:58,008
Of course.

1917
01:48:05,425 --> 01:48:07,467
Move! Move!
Out of the way!

1918
01:48:07,467 --> 01:48:09,675
<i>Wow!</i>
<i>Thank you very much, London!</i>

1919
01:48:09,675 --> 01:48:12,592
<i>We would like to acknowledge</i>
<i>not just our old friend</i>

1920
01:48:12,592 --> 01:48:16,675
<i>But his young and very</i>
<i>brilliant son, Walter Mabry.</i>

1921
01:48:16,675 --> 01:48:19,342
<i>Who has performed one of the</i>
<i>greatest feats of illusion</i>

1922
01:48:19,342 --> 01:48:20,883
<i>even we have ever seen.</i>

1923
01:48:20,883 --> 01:48:25,300
<i>He has, amazingly, brought</i>
<i>himself back from the dead!</i>

1924
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:27,883
<i>But before he did that,</i>

1925
01:48:27,883 --> 01:48:29,425
<i>he revealed someone.</i>

1926
01:48:29,425 --> 01:48:32,342
<i>And we think it</i>
<i>only right to give him</i>

1927
01:48:32,342 --> 01:48:34,592
<i>a proper introduction.</i>

1928
01:48:34,592 --> 01:48:37,467
<i>He is our friend</i>
<i>and he is our leader.</i>

1929
01:48:37,467 --> 01:48:38,675
<i>Dylan Shrike!</i>

1930
01:48:38,675 --> 01:48:40,675
<i>- Get over here!</i>
<i>- Yeah!</i>

1931
01:48:46,550 --> 01:48:48,675
<i>So, normally</i>

1932
01:48:48,675 --> 01:48:53,508
<i>only the magician,</i>
<i>his assistant, and</i>
<i>a few trusted stage hands</i>

1933
01:48:53,508 --> 01:48:55,675
<i>know the secret</i>
<i>of a trick.</i>

1934
01:48:55,675 --> 01:48:58,758
<i>But tonight,</i>
<i>however, in this effect,</i>

1935
01:48:58,758 --> 01:49:01,883
<i>all of you people</i>
<i>around the Thames here.</i>

1936
01:49:01,883 --> 01:49:03,967
<i>And since we're</i>
<i>streaming live,</i>

1937
01:49:03,967 --> 01:49:06,675
<i>everyone around the world</i>

1938
01:49:06,675 --> 01:49:09,342
<i>already knows everything.</i>

1939
01:49:09,342 --> 01:49:13,467
<i>And only these fellows</i>
<i>here are the ones</i>
<i>left in the dark.</i>

1940
01:49:13,467 --> 01:49:16,467
<i>So let's see how closely</i>
<i>you were watching our shows.</i>

1941
01:49:16,467 --> 01:49:19,592
<i>Remember when we were</i>
<i>playing "Find the Lady."</i>

1942
01:49:19,592 --> 01:49:21,675
<i>I said that we</i>
<i>used a Barry Trap.</i>

1943
01:49:22,842 --> 01:49:26,592
<i>Some classic switches</i>
<i>and a few duplicates?</i>

1944
01:49:26,592 --> 01:49:30,050
<i>Well, that's how we switched</i>
<i>the driver of the truck.</i>

1945
01:49:33,050 --> 01:49:35,467
<i>Which took us to</i>
<i>a duplicate hangar</i>

1946
01:49:35,467 --> 01:49:37,758
<i>where we used</i>
<i>your need to rush,</i>

1947
01:49:37,758 --> 01:49:41,342
<i>and your fear of being seen</i>
<i>let you do the work for us.</i>

1948
01:49:41,342 --> 01:49:42,633
<i>Get those lights off me!</i>

1949
01:49:44,383 --> 01:49:46,467
<i>So, the airplane.</i>

1950
01:49:46,467 --> 01:49:48,050
<i>How did we get it to fly?</i>

1951
01:49:49,675 --> 01:49:51,675
<i>Well, we used fans,</i>

1952
01:49:51,675 --> 01:49:54,550
<i>and lights and rain machines.</i>

1953
01:49:59,675 --> 01:50:04,467
<i>Obviously, all of this was</i>
<i>reliant on us getting caught.</i>

1954
01:50:04,467 --> 01:50:07,883
<i>that you would do exactly</i>
<i>what we needed you to do</i>

1955
01:50:07,883 --> 01:50:09,508
<i>once you did catch us.</i>

1956
01:50:09,508 --> 01:50:11,383
<i>My brother Chase,</i>

1957
01:50:11,383 --> 01:50:15,675
<i>who was technical adviser</i>
<i>to the losing team.</i>

1958
01:50:15,675 --> 01:50:18,467
<i>He taught us that it's</i>
<i>all about blind spots.</i>

1959
01:50:18,467 --> 01:50:20,008
I know where you're going!

1960
01:50:20,008 --> 01:50:23,717
<i>And, surprises.</i>

1961
01:50:25,508 --> 01:50:26,967
Watch it, hobo.

1962
01:50:26,967 --> 01:50:28,717
Why don't you watch
the watch I'm wearing,

1963
01:50:28,717 --> 01:50:31,592
the where of where
you're watching, and sleep!

1964
01:50:31,592 --> 01:50:33,633
It's going to be your idea
to throw the Horsemen

1965
01:50:33,633 --> 01:50:34,967
out of the plane.

1966
01:50:34,967 --> 01:50:37,300
If all of this is
kind of confusing to you,

1967
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:39,592
I can maybe catch
you up on it later.

1968
01:50:39,592 --> 01:50:42,008
Probably see you what,
three to five?

1969
01:50:43,050 --> 01:50:45,300
Come on, put it there.

1970
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:46,758
Hey! Tit for tat, bro!

1971
01:50:48,008 --> 01:50:51,008
<i>Basically,</i>
<i>we showed them everything.</i>

1972
01:50:51,008 --> 01:50:56,508
<i>to steal the very thing that</i>
<i>is in your pocket right now.</i>

1973
01:50:58,550 --> 01:50:59,883
<i>Whoops!</i>

1974
01:51:03,592 --> 01:51:06,050
<i>You know,</i>
<i>this thing here,</i>

1975
01:51:06,050 --> 01:51:09,425
<i>which you said</i>
<i>you could use</i>
<i>to adjust markets,</i>

1976
01:51:09,425 --> 01:51:11,008
<i>manipulate governments,</i>

1977
01:51:11,008 --> 01:51:17,967
<i>Also, you could, as you</i>
<i>said control the public</i>
<i>from outside the grid.</i>

1978
01:51:19,508 --> 01:51:24,800
<i>These men destroy</i>
<i>people's lives.</i>

1979
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:28,842
<i>Spying on the world,</i>
<i>robbing you of your</i>
<i>right to privacy.</i>

1980
01:51:28,842 --> 01:51:32,342
<i>And they do that</i>
<i>by hiding in the dark.</i>

1981
01:51:32,342 --> 01:51:36,842
<i>So, in the Horsemen tradition,</i>
<i>we're here to expose them.</i>

1982
01:51:36,842 --> 01:51:38,800
<i>Tonight, they,</i>

1983
01:51:39,675 --> 01:51:41,967
<i>like all of us,</i>

1984
01:51:41,967 --> 01:51:44,842
<i>are finally stepping</i>
<i>into the light.</i>

1985
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:52,633
<i>We are the Horsemen</i>
<i>and we will be back very soon!</i>

1986
01:51:55,342 --> 01:51:57,717
Five, four, three,

1987
01:51:57,717 --> 01:51:59,425
two, one!

1988
01:52:16,008 --> 01:52:18,758
Hey, we're on the clock.
Get a move on.

1989
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:25,050
There's more inside.
Don't you bloody touch me!

1990
01:52:25,050 --> 01:52:26,842
The Horsemen are
over on the...

1991
01:52:29,633 --> 01:52:31,050
Shit!

1992
01:52:31,717 --> 01:52:33,633
Stay with them!

1993
01:52:33,633 --> 01:52:35,675
Everybody spread out!

1994
01:52:35,675 --> 01:52:37,633
Nobody leaves this barge!

1995
01:52:39,508 --> 01:52:42,633
Rhodes,
hold it right there!
Do not move!

1996
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:49,883
This contains everything.

1997
01:52:49,883 --> 01:52:53,008
Not just Walter and Tressler,
but all their dealings.

1998
01:52:53,008 --> 01:52:56,050
All their contacts,
the entire network.

1999
01:52:56,050 --> 01:52:58,467
And why on Earth
would I believe you?

2000
01:52:58,467 --> 01:53:00,300
I told you.

2001
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:02,300
I'm the same man
I've always been.

2002
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:04,717
Move it! Come on!
Let's go, go, go!

2003
01:53:04,717 --> 01:53:07,550
I'm not part of this
organization! I'm Merritt.

2004
01:53:07,550 --> 01:53:09,842
I'm a patsy!
I'm a patsy!

2005
01:53:11,717 --> 01:53:12,967
10 minutes.

2006
01:53:15,467 --> 01:53:17,592
Now you're playing
the long game.

2007
01:53:31,425 --> 01:53:33,675
Dad, I promise
you I will fix this.

2008
01:53:33,675 --> 01:53:36,008
You can't.
Stop calling me dad.

2009
01:53:36,008 --> 01:53:40,050
There were so many women,
I have no idea
whose bastard you are.

2010
01:53:40,050 --> 01:53:43,717
What happened?
Thin air, gone.
Come with me.

2011
01:53:43,717 --> 01:53:45,550
What're you talking
about, gone?

2012
01:53:45,550 --> 01:53:47,508
People don't
just disappear.

2013
01:53:47,508 --> 01:53:50,342
You realize that
he doesn't actually
have magical powers!

2014
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:31,383
Hey, guys.
Hey!

2015
01:54:31,383 --> 01:54:33,758
Good to see you all.
Good to see you, Li.

2016
01:54:34,842 --> 01:54:36,008
Come on in.

2017
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:40,633
Good morning.

2018
01:54:40,967 --> 01:54:42,050
Welcome.

2019
01:54:44,550 --> 01:54:46,467
I'm proud of you.

2020
01:54:46,467 --> 01:54:48,008
All of you.

2021
01:54:48,008 --> 01:54:50,508
I have a lot to show you.

2022
01:54:50,508 --> 01:54:51,717
Come.

2023
01:54:52,842 --> 01:54:54,050
Come.

2024
01:55:05,508 --> 01:55:06,717
Dad.

2025
01:55:24,008 --> 01:55:25,758
Yes.

2026
01:55:25,758 --> 01:55:28,633
Your father and I
were partners.

2027
01:55:28,633 --> 01:55:31,800
Our act was
that of rivals.

2028
01:55:32,883 --> 01:55:35,842
I was the
hard-eyed realist.

2029
01:55:35,842 --> 01:55:38,675
He was the
dreamy-eyed idealist.

2030
01:55:38,675 --> 01:55:41,508
We thought it was
the perfect misdirect.

2031
01:55:42,508 --> 01:55:46,342
Yes, in public,
I did goad him.

2032
01:55:46,342 --> 01:55:48,300
The only thing
we didn't count on

2033
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:50,925
was it going so wrong.

2034
01:55:54,967 --> 01:55:56,842
Why?

2035
01:55:56,842 --> 01:55:58,758
Why didn't you ever
say anything to me?

2036
01:55:58,758 --> 01:56:00,425
I don't know.

2037
01:56:01,467 --> 01:56:02,800
Give it a name.

2038
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,842
Shame, guilt.

2039
01:56:04,842 --> 01:56:06,342
Regret.

2040
01:56:09,925 --> 01:56:12,925
Hey, guys, 
you might wanna come
take a look at this.

2041
01:56:17,050 --> 01:56:18,508
Look.

2042
01:56:18,508 --> 01:56:20,342
<i>I put you</i>
<i>in jail, man.</i>

2043
01:56:20,342 --> 01:56:22,717
Why didn't you
say something then?

2044
01:56:22,717 --> 01:56:25,842
Well, you know,
I was going to.

2045
01:56:25,842 --> 01:56:29,842
But then, you were
so quick to show your
personal motivations that...

2046
01:56:31,717 --> 01:56:33,508
Well, quite frankly

2047
01:56:33,508 --> 01:56:35,300
it spoiled
the trick for me.

2048
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:36,633
I showed my weakness.

2049
01:56:36,633 --> 01:56:39,508
Well, it showed
you weren't ready.

2050
01:56:39,508 --> 01:56:42,300
But when you came
back to my cell,

2051
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:46,342
you had let go of your
30-year vendetta against me

2052
01:56:47,592 --> 01:56:48,967
for your Horsemen.

2053
01:56:50,633 --> 01:56:53,342
<i>And I said to myself,</i>

2054
01:56:53,342 --> 01:56:55,425
<i>"That's Lionel's boy."</i>

2055
01:56:56,050 --> 01:56:58,675
<i>And I knew it was my job</i>

2056
01:56:58,675 --> 01:57:03,508
<i>to see to it that</i>
<i>he became the magician</i>
<i>he was born to be.</i>

2057
01:57:03,508 --> 01:57:05,842
All that was
left then was...

2058
01:57:07,633 --> 01:57:08,883
For me to hit bottom.

2059
01:57:09,675 --> 01:57:10,967
So the safe,

2060
01:57:10,967 --> 01:57:12,925
my father's wristwatch,

2061
01:57:12,925 --> 01:57:14,592
that was all you?

2062
01:57:17,342 --> 01:57:20,675
<i>Walter and Tressler,</i>
<i>were they in on it too?</i>

2063
01:57:20,675 --> 01:57:23,633
<i>We knew</i>
<i>Walter was in hiding.</i>

2064
01:57:23,633 --> 01:57:27,467
<i>The Octa show was a setup</i>
<i>to expose him to the public.</i>

2065
01:57:30,633 --> 01:57:32,758
<i>And you were right</i>
<i>about the Horsemen.</i>

2066
01:57:32,758 --> 01:57:37,675
<i>They needed to learn</i>
<i>to work together like</i>
<i>a single organism.</i>

2067
01:57:45,383 --> 01:57:47,967
Now I know why
you look so familiar.

2068
01:57:47,967 --> 01:57:49,550
You're the Horsemen,
aren't you?

2069
01:57:57,342 --> 01:58:00,967
<i>But that can't be</i>
<i>what all this is about.</i>

2070
01:58:00,967 --> 01:58:02,967
You know,
the best tricks

2071
01:58:02,967 --> 01:58:05,508
work on many levels.

2072
01:58:05,508 --> 01:58:07,425
And the deepest one,

2073
01:58:07,425 --> 01:58:09,550
for me, at least,

2074
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:12,425
is this moment
right here.

2075
01:58:15,842 --> 01:58:17,508
I'm sorry, Dylan.

2076
01:58:18,008 --> 01:58:20,675
I miss your father.

2077
01:58:20,675 --> 01:58:24,383
30 years is a long time
to drag something
around, isn't it?

2078
01:58:24,383 --> 01:58:25,967
Yes, it is.

2079
01:58:35,842 --> 01:58:37,342
So, now what?

2080
01:58:39,633 --> 01:58:42,592
Now I'm about
out of moves....

2081
01:58:42,592 --> 01:58:46,425
Come on, you're the one
who said that you
believe that this road

2082
01:58:46,425 --> 01:58:48,342
lead to the great wizard
behind the curtain.

2083
01:58:48,342 --> 01:58:52,592
And that you'd finally
get to look him in the eyes.

2084
01:58:53,008 --> 01:58:54,758
I am.

2085
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:03,008
It's your game now.

2086
01:59:03,008 --> 01:59:05,758
You play it however
you see fit.

2087
01:59:06,883 --> 01:59:09,342
My suggestion, however,

2088
01:59:09,342 --> 01:59:12,842
is that you find
yourself a successor.

2089
01:59:12,842 --> 01:59:14,800
Hi. Okay, so, um...

2090
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,967
Well, obviously,
we have a few questions.

2091
01:59:16,967 --> 01:59:18,925
Right?

2092
01:59:18,925 --> 01:59:20,758
... By "a few,"
I think he means,
like, five million.

2093
01:59:20,758 --> 01:59:22,467
Yeah.
Well.

2094
01:59:22,467 --> 01:59:24,383
Good luck to you all.

2095
01:59:24,383 --> 01:59:25,967
What!
Okay. See,
that's not fair.

2096
01:59:25,967 --> 01:59:27,300
Come on.
That's not right.

2097
01:59:27,300 --> 01:59:28,550
That's gonna make
me really angry!

2098
01:59:28,550 --> 01:59:29,800
Not right now.

2099
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:31,550
Um,
by the way...

2100
01:59:33,675 --> 01:59:36,342
Pay no attention
to the curtain.

2101
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:40,508
There is a curtain.

2102
01:59:40,508 --> 01:59:41,883
Go, go, go.

2103
01:59:51,300 --> 01:59:53,842
<i>Seeing is believing.</i>

2104
01:59:53,842 --> 01:59:55,758
<i>But is it truth?</i>

2105
01:59:55,758 --> 01:59:58,508
<i>Depends on your point of view.</i>

2106
01:59:58,508 --> 02:00:01,008
<i>Are you listening, Horsemen?</i>

2107
02:00:01,008 --> 02:00:03,050
<i>When you emerge,</i>

2108
02:00:03,050 --> 02:00:05,508
<i>and you will,</i>

2109
02:00:05,508 --> 02:00:08,675
<i>I will be there waiting.</i>

2110
02:00:08,675 --> 02:00:11,383
<i>Because mark my words,</i>

2111
02:00:11,383 --> 02:00:14,425
<i>you will get</i>
<i>what's coming to you</i>

2112
02:00:14,425 --> 02:00:17,008
<i>in ways you can't expect.</i>

2113
02:00:17,842 --> 02:00:20,633
<i>But very much deserve.</i>

2114
02:00:20,633 --> 02:00:23,842
<i>Because one thing I believe in</i>

2115
02:00:23,842 --> 02:00:25,883
<i>is an eye</i>

2116
02:00:25,883 --> 02:00:27,800
<i>for an eye.</i>
