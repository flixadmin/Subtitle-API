00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,196
Now, there's magic.

00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,036
An unknown number of

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,416
What did you do to me?

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,510
A lobotomy of sorts.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,794
Your shapeshifting days are over,
sweetheart.

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,031
- No!
- She definitely isn't Amaya.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,040
- Did you just hear that?
- Judy, relax.

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,520
There's nothing out here.

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,717
Tonight, it's just you and me. Okay?

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,000
Wait a second.

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,637
Don't tell me that
the fearless Ms. Lance is scared

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
of a little horror film?

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,389
No, I love horror movies

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,437
and I watched them obsessively
as a kid.

19
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,830
So how could I have missed this gem?

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,117
<i>"Swamp Thaaaang."</i> Never heard of it.

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,873
And what's with all the "A's"?

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,634
Okay, let me look.

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,720
Okay, <i>Swamp Thaaaang.</i>

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,997
Apparently, there are
four "A's" in the name

25
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,037
because it's the fourth film
in the franchise.

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,555
The AV Club gave it a D-plus,
saying, "The production design

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,552
"is as lazy as the action staging."

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,279
- Harsh.
- Yeah.

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,512
"Based on real life, tragic events
that occurred at Camp Ogawa, Maine,

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,080
"in the summer of 1995"?

31
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,830
Gideon.

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,115
We're in my room, babe.

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,159
Right.

34
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,670
Speak of the devil.

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,736
<i>Sorry to interrupt, Captain,</i>

36
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,434
<i>but I've detected
new magical events in the timeline.</i>

37
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,354
<i>It seems that a number of children
went missing from a summer camp.</i>

38
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,557
Let me guess, Camp Ogawa, Maine.

39
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,676
<i>Precisely.</i>

40
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,752
Looks like the handiwork
of one of our fugitives.

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,797
<i>Shall I plot a course to 1995, then?</i>

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,276
While you're at it,
fabricate a mess of bug spray.

43
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,360
I'm on my way.

44
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,716
Well, how about that.

45
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,714
We almost got to spend two whole
uninterrupted hours together.

46
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,709
How about you come with me?

47
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,438
Summer camp? As in bug bites,
bunk beds and mean girls?

48
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,796
No. Summer camp as in campfires,

49
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,349
sing-alongs,
and friendship bracelets.

50
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,195
Camp's the best. You'll love it.
Pinky swear.

51
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,316
What are you doing?

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,176
It's something you do when
you're a kid. It's like a promise.

53
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,475
What?

54
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,713
Come on. No, pinky.

55
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,839
- Yes.
- You're weird.

56
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,560
This will be a great way for us
to spend some more time together

57
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,878
and plus, we get to make sure
that doesn't happen in real life.

58
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,416
I talked to Nate, and
he's got things covered at the Bureau.

59
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,696
He and Gary have their hands full

60
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,136
with all the magical creatures
popping up.

61
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,117
Nate and Gary are in charge.

62
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,352
Well, anyways,
I'm glad that he's there

63
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,036
because we've got something
I really don't want him to see.

64
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,480
What's that?

65
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,953
Amaya.

66
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,039
It just looks like her.

67
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,438
- Did you say "it"?
- She's a shapeshifter.

68
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,317
We found her in London, 1977.

69
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,358
Hmm. Hello.

70
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,674
Not much of a talker, I see.

71
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,200
Oh, she talks.

72
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Go to hell!

73
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,794
Just her way of saying "hello."

74
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,349
Oh, let me out of here, you bastards!

75
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,079
She's still adjusting
to her new home.

76
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
Maybe it's the food.

77
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,833
But Constantine
sent the other fugitives

78
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,274
you encountered to hell, so...

79
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,750
She's not exactly
a bloodthirsty unicorn.

80
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,718
Or an evil fairy godmother.

81
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,031
But you decided to keep
the shapeshifter because...

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh...

83
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,153
To exploit her for information

84
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,416
about the interdimensional prison
that she's been trapped in

85
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,999
to help us track down
other fugitives.

86
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,358
That is exactly what we are doing.

87
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,394
One hundred percent.
Isn't that right, Zari?

88
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,470
Yeah. Um, I'm gathering that intel

89
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,710
- as we speak.
- Mmm.

90
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,200
I love the initiative, team.

91
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,470
Yeah.

92
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,517
- Gentlemen.
- Oh, Director Sharpe.

93
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,035
Joining us, are we?

94
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,077
- Is that a problem?
- Not for me, love.

95
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,193
Good. Because we are headed
back to the '90s

96
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,192
to infiltrate a place called
Camp Ogawa.

97
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,477
Whoa, sneaking into a military facility,
are we?

98
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,359
Actually,
it's a summer camp for kids.

99
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,558
Oh, I love summer camp. Everyone used
to call me Kid Counselor.

100
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,776
Bet you took that as a compliment,
too, didn't you, mate?

101
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,235
Well, because of my
leadership skills obviously.

102
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,913
- Right? That's why...
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

103
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,590
So, uh, any idea what kind of foul beast
we're up against, then?

104
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,876
Well, based on... Research.

105
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,196
Sara and I have been doing,

106
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,954
we could be looking for
a swampy monster thing.

107
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,600
According to the timeline,

108
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,195
before the end of summer,
several kids went missing,

109
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,670
never to be seen again.

110
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,513
Well, I happen to know a Swamp Thing.

111
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,389
But then again, Maine is
way too far north for that muppet.

112
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,439
Well, we used to use the buddy system
to make sure everyone was safe.

113
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,755
And this is where Nate would say,
"I'm your buddy,"

114
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,480
and we'd do a fist bump
or a silly jig or...

115
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,311
Well, we are shorthanded, so...

116
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,159
I need you to partner up with John.

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,198
Oh, don't worry, dreamboat. I've had
stranger bedfellows than you.

118
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,536
But just so you know, I'm not one

119
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,677
to get all gussied up
for a gig, all right?

120
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,720
Huh, you may take my coat,
but you will never take...

121
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,234
Nope. And lose the tie.

122
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,113
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

123
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,436
Fine. One time.

124
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,560
But it's only for the kids.

125
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,832
Yeah. That's the camp spirit.

126
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,677
Are these outfits really necessary?

127
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,796
Girl!

128
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,112
Come on. Gideon made us official
Camp Ogawa counselor uniforms

129
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,477
using archival photos
so that we could fit in.

130
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,518
What are you guys doing
just standing around?

131
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,640
Hi. We are the new camp counselors.

132
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,760
Sorry to show up unannounced.

133
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,480
Well, freckles,
the name's Paula Cooper.

134
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,080
I'm the director here.

135
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,680
Welcome to Camp Ogawa.

136
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,954
My right-hand man, Chad Stevens,
will show you around. Chad.

137
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,150
Get over here.

138
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,878
- S'up!
- Chad, you marbled cut of prime beef,

139
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,032
give these new counselors the tour.

140
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
Cool. All right.

141
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,776
Hey, let's bounce over this way.

142
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,598
I'll give you the 411
on this place, huh?

143
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Yeah.

144
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,080
What we need are snipers
on that ridge line,

145
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,753
spotters on the ground
and an exfil site

146
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,115
for when we bag the creature.

147
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,680
Not a bad plan, Sharpie.

148
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,080
I'll put a protection spell

149
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,072
around the perimeter
to keep out the nasties.

150
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,119
Best offense is a strong defense.

151
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,836
- Mmm.
- Hmm.

152
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,513
So, as you can see,

153
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,398
Camp Ogawa is a miserable place,

154
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,399
and Paula runs it like a POW camp.

155
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,400
Not!

156
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,110
Oh, God, another '90's "not" joke.

157
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,635
Oh, it's like comic comfort food.

158
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,031
I'm sorry. I couldn't help
but admire your lanyard.

159
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,440
Did you make that yourself?

160
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,869
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

161
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,596
Yeah, along with
the 21 required merit badges,

162
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,832
I also went on to get certification
in Nuclear Science and Dentistry.

163
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,396
Oh, snap!
I've got some serious competition

164
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,296
for "Coolest Counselor"
this summer, huh?

165
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
Ah.

166
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,112
What about you?
You got any special skills?

167
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Martial arts.

168
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,117
Sorry. That's so fresh.

169
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,400
Jackie Chan, you know.

170
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,273
I prefer knives and swords.

171
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,153
Right, yeah. Point taken.

172
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,991
- Point taken.
- Good one, bro.

173
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,275
Anyway, let's head over here.

174
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,113
All right,
I'm gonna assign you your cabins.

175
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,554
It's gonna be a heck of a summer.

176
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,316
He'll grow on you.

177
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,433
Greetings, members of Newton Cabin.

178
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,079
I am Counselor Ray

179
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,755
and the mysterious gentlemen
behind you is Counselor John.

180
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,880
Cheers, lads.

181
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,159
Well, today's subject
is wilderness survival,

182
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,835
which includes
Tracking and Orienteering.

183
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
Who's excited?

184
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,274
Well, you will be, okay?

185
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,352
Two words to remember when tracking.

186
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,272
Displacement and direction.

187
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,439
Now, Counselor John will demonstrate
the kind of inadvertent markers

188
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,354
people leave behind
while walking in the woods.

189
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,836
And Counselor John
is missing already.

190
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,200
See how easy it is
to get lost in the woods, gentlemen?

191
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,911
What's up, Franklin Cabin?

192
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,759
We are in the house,
I am Sara and this is Ava.

193
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,952
We are your camp counselors.

194
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,956
Now, I was thinking
we need a secret handshake.

195
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Yeah.

196
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,434
Something really cool
that only we know.

197
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
- Yeah.
- So cool.

198
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,633
- What are you doing?
- Bonding.

199
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,576
How's that supposed to keep them safe
from what's in the woods?

200
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,160
It allows us to form
a meaningful connection

201
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,072
and them to feel like
they're part of a team.

202
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,936
They're not gonna be a part
of anything if they're dead.

203
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,760
- Ava...
- We can go back to the fun and games

204
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,393
once we catch the creature. Yes?

205
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,673
All right, ladies. Change in plan.

206
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,936
Today, we're gonna celebrate
your first day of camp

207
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,713
by using safety and discipline.

208
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,315
Got it? Now,

209
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,000
when I blow this whistle,
you are to run, not walk,

210
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,958
to your respective beds.

211
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,790
But it's still daytime.

212
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,475
It will feel like nighttime
when your eyes are closed. Now, move.

213
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
Very nice.

214
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
What are you doing?

215
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,995
I'm creating a protective barrier
to catch monsters.

216
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,714
- Monsters?
- Yeah.

217
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,840
You know, the kind that slice
your stomach open

218
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,798
and then eat your intestines
for supper.

219
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,516
Getting those kids to bed was
a lot easier than I expected.

220
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,800
You know, I'm really glad I came.

221
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,910
I just feel bad.
We're ruining camp for these kids.

222
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,600
It's such an important time.

223
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,918
Well, didn't realize you were so
gung ho about this whole camp thing.

224
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,311
I was even Color Captain one year.

225
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
Mmm?

226
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,319
Summer after eighth grade.

227
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,756
I really stuck it to Suzy Smith
and the Green Team that year.

228
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,356
That sounds magical.

229
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,760
It was.

230
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,189
Unfortunately, we're here
to stop magic, my love.

231
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,470
Well, with us guarding their cabin
and Constantine's perimeter,

232
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,270
at least no swampy monster
is getting into this camp tonight.

233
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,389
Who's there?

234
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,878
Relax, Lenise. It's just me.

235
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,155
Zack.

236
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,520
So, what do you want to do?

237
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,512
Have you ever kissed anyone before?

238
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,636
Zack?

239
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,720
Beautiful morning.

240
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,798
Yeah, sorry to burst your
summer-loving bubble, mate,

241
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,599
but we're missing one
of our young charges.

242
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,592
His name is Zack or something.

243
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,599
Well, are you sure you counted right?

244
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,976
Because based on
your whiskey cologne,

245
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,080
I think you're still drunk.

246
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
No, he's right.

247
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,959
Yeah. A girl's missing
from our cabin, too.

248
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,679
Even after I put
the fear of God in them.

249
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,040
Obviously, there's something wrong
with Constantine's booby trap.

250
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,640
Yeah, are you off your trolley, mate?

251
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,196
My spell was designed to keep
the monsters from getting in,

252
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,078
not children getting out.

253
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,056
They must have snuck out
in the middle of the night.

254
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,912
Snuck out? Why would they sneak out?

255
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,480
To make out, duh.

256
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,155
Well, I suppose we should notify
the camp director.

257
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
Okay, guys, so...

258
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,797
Oh, don't worry about those kids,
they're gonna be just fine.

259
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,517
- Uh, shouldn't we mount a search party...
- They couldn't have gotten too far.

260
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,360
Look, freckles,
this happens every year.

261
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,951
Kids under the influence
of their hormones

262
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,713
go off into the woods at night.

263
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
Just watch.

264
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,517
They'll eventually get hungry
and tired, and they'll come back.

265
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,753
Now, go out there
and do some counseling.

266
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,871
Well, someone gives
precisely zero craps

267
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,553
about the safety of her campers.

268
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,830
I guarantee you one of these kids
knows where the other two went.

269
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,190
How can you be so sure?

270
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,640
Because when I was in camp,

271
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,951
we used to hide stuff from
the counselors all the time.

272
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
We just need to figure out
how to get them to talk.

273
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,154
The Circle of Trust creates
a safe space

274
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,709
for us to share our secrets
without judgement.

275
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,759
Now, take each other's hands.

276
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,635
- Now, I want you to...
- Uh...

277
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,360
Sorry to butt in, lads,

278
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,995
but can I have
a word with you for a second?

279
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,559
I want you to meditate on the word
"openness" and I'll be right back.

280
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,754
You're interrupt...
You're interrupting the flow.

281
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,880
Yeah, well, apologies
to you and your flow

282
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,480
but all of your psychobabble,

283
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,656
it ain't gonna cut the mustard
with the young ones, mate.

284
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,909
Let me show you how it's done.

285
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,839
Right then,
which one of you whippersnappers

286
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,560
wants to be hypnotized?

287
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,040
- Me, me, me.
- Pick me!

288
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,679
Me first.

289
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,672
Alexis, you and Lenise
are besties, right?

290
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,797
We were partners
in last year's talent show.

291
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,376
She didn't show up at roll call
this morning. I'm worried.

292
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,914
Do you know
where she might have gone?

293
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,033
All right, ladies! On your feet.

294
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,430
Report to the front of your beds,
arms by your sides, now!

295
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,795
What is with the police lineup?

296
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,837
This is summer camp,
not boot camp, remember?

297
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,314
You are too soft on these kids.

298
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,632
Children crave authority.
Besides, my way will be quicker.

299
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,276
That's it.

300
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,029
Look at my watch.

301
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,120
Now, where did your mate Zack
run off to last night?

302
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,995
He didn't say.

303
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,517
But I hope he didn't go
near the outdoor showers.

304
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
Why?

305
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,520
What's by the outdoor showers?

306
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,711
That's where I hid
my Victoria's Secret catalog.

307
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
Huh.

308
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,479
Your friend Lenise snuck out
of the cabin last night.

309
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,756
And no one's going anywhere
until I find out where she went.

310
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,318
But the ice cream social
is in, like, five minutes.

311
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,476
Well, then you better, like,
start talking, Kiana,

312
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,256
or you're gonna have to scrape
the bottom of the carton

313
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
for what's left.

314
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,593
Last night, Zack said something about
meeting someone in the woods.

315
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,994
Where in the woods exactly?

316
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,233
A baseball field, only there's
no baseball field out there.

317
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,399
Oh, that's all right. Keep digging.

318
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,032
He kept talking about
making it to first base with a girl.

319
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,473
But who plays baseball in the dark?

320
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,711
She probably went to the same place
your style went.

321
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,840
You could use a makeover.
Like, head to toe.

322
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,435
<i>Ms. Tomaz,
the prisoner is growing quite unruly.</i>

323
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,680
Tell her to knock herself out.

324
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,955
I take that back.

325
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,792
Damn it. Not on my watch.

326
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,119
Okay. I feel like we got off
on the wrong foot.

327
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,791
It's just that you're wearing
my friend's face

328
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,999
and that's a little unsettling,
given your general demeanor.

329
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,116
Look, I didn't love it at first
when I got here,

330
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,830
but I found my place.

331
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
You can, too.

332
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,760
Take a look
in the mirror, sweetheart.

333
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,912
It's not my face
that should be unsettling.

334
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,040
You're the one putting things
in cages.

335
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,078
So, how many girls has
the missus made cry so far

336
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,376
or have you lost count?

337
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,234
Ava's interrogation techniques
aren't gonna work on them.

338
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,394
They'd rather take their secrets
to the grave than squeal.

339
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,836
Anything with the boys?

340
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,718
Oh, those boys aren't hiding a thing.

341
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,776
They're open books,
if those books were written

342
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,632
by hapless fools, that is.

343
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,876
If I could just become one of them,

344
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,079
another 12-year-old camper, I could
get these girls to talk like that.

345
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,233
I do believe that you've just sparked
an idea there, Ms. Lance.

346
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,760
End of the road, kid.

347
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,030
In your cage.

348
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,631
Bloke like you doesn't strike me
as a jailer.

349
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,233
I believe we're more alike
than you think.

350
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,616
You look like
you've been on the inside.

351
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
That's right.

352
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,994
Then how do you sleep at night

353
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,318
hanging out with
these jailer mates of yours?

354
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,110
Alcohol.

355
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,234
Oh, I've made an additional list
of suspects I want questioned.

356
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,320
- Ava...
- Look,

357
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,296
I know that you just want them
to have fun, all right?

358
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,630
But the fact of the matter is
there is a monster out there

359
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,110
hunting down these kids
and these girls are stonewalling us.

360
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,600
Okay?

361
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Counselor Ava?

362
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,830
Yes?

363
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,196
I'm ready to tell you
what's really going on.

364
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,394
Go on, honey. Spill the beans.

365
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,478
It won't stop
unless you do something.

366
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,630
What won't stop?

367
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,518
The monster
that lives under the dock.

368
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,040
The Lake Beast.

369
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,236
Who's the Lake Beast?

370
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,516
Years ago, at this very camp,

371
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,598
some mean kids played a prank
on a boy

372
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,114
and he drowned in the lake.

373
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,194
And now, every year he returns
to get his revenge.

374
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,560
And so you think
the Lake Beast took your friends?

375
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,117
They say the only way
to make him appear

376
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,320
is to go to the dock alone
and call his name three times.

377
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,275
Sweetie, you are so brave.

378
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,816
And I promise you,
the Lake Beast won't be

379
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,115
getting anyone tonight, okay?

380
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,470
Guys!

381
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,157
Guys, I think I see
a Northern Saw-whet owl.

382
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,913
Ray! Focus.

383
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,799
Fine. I'll save it
for my bird-watching journal.

384
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,276
Okay, you're in the clear, Ava.

385
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,830
Stupid bird.

386
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,360
Okay, let's get this over with.

387
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,958
Lake Beast. Lake Beast. Lake Beast.

388
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,639
Guys, this feels like a bust to me.

389
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,435
Oh, it was just a bloody prank.

390
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,080
- Let's go!
- Go, go, go!

391
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,390
You okay?

392
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,472
Nice night for a swim though,
eh, Sharpie.

393
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,113
Those girls are monsters!

394
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,760
After we left the lake last night,

395
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,400
another one of our campers
went missing.

396
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,960
Another one of ours is missing, too.

397
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,270
That makes four in total.

398
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,536
They must have snuck out
to meet up with each other

399
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,755
and never made it back.

400
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,616
Yeah, well, I don't know
about you lot,

401
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,154
but I'm not just sitting around here

402
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,516
and waiting for the monster
to go and get another kid.

403
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,816
We better split up.

404
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,040
All right. You two check the woods
for the missing kids.

405
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,673
Ava and I will stay and watch here.

406
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,320
Hey, wait. Buddy system.

407
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,356
I heard about last night.

408
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,475
It's majorly uncool.

409
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,075
Who knew kids could be so mean?

410
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,520
They've been calling me "Lake Beast"
behind my back all day.

411
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,677
Excuse me, Lake Beast.

412
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,760
And to my face.

413
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
Okay. Hey.

414
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,829
That is enough, ladies.
The joke is over.

415
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,376
It's time for you to behave
or else your cabin will be banned

416
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,834
from the July Jamboree.

417
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,360
The only way we are gonna get
any information from these girls

418
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,715
is to infiltrate their clique.

419
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,640
How are we supposed to do that?
We're not kids.

420
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,275
Funny you should say that.

421
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,113
Constantine gave me a potion

422
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,393
that would turn us into kids
only temporarily.

423
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
You're kidding, right?

424
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
Wh...

425
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,200
Even if it worked, Sara, I wouldn't
have any idea how to act like a kid

426
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,296
because I've never been one.

427
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,471
All my childhood memories
are fake, remember?

428
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,576
How are we gonna find the kids
with that dangly thing?

429
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,512
You know,
this ritual usually works best

430
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,069
when someone isn't yammering
in my earlobe.

431
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,656
Well, if you want to find the kids,

432
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,239
we got to do it
the old-fashioned way.

433
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,795
Study their tracks.

434
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,096
It's a good thing I came prepared,

435
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,077
because one step
in the wrong direction here

436
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,416
and you'll be traveling for miles
in the wrong direction.

437
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,673
Damn it, you namby-pamby,
I said I need silence.

438
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,281
Oh, you meant right now.
I'm sorry, I thought you meant...

439
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,516
Why are you being such a jerk?

440
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,976
Because you shouldn't even be
out here chasing a magical creature.

441
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
All right?

442
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,680
It's too dangerous.

443
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,434
Too dangerous?

444
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,000
You're lucky you're out here with me,

445
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,231
because I can keep us alive
on bugs and berries alone.

446
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,399
You know, this has nothing to do
with survival in the wild,

447
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,631
and everything to do with surviving
magical creatures

448
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,552
and those who dabble
in the dark arts.

449
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,950
I'll have you know I am no stranger
to the world of magic.

450
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,271
Yeah. Oh, don't think I haven't heard

451
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,070
how Nora Darhk had you eating out of
the palm of her wicked little hand.

452
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,393
Oh, I bet she didn't even have to ask
for the time stone, did she?

453
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,237
No, you just gave it away
like biscuits at tea time.

454
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,517
Nora and I have
a mutual respect for each other.

455
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,480
It's not like I was tripping
over myself...

456
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,560
What is that?

457
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
Huh.

458
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,070
No doubt left behind
by the magical beast.

459
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,677
Who sheds its skin
after it eats the kids?

460
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,514
What are we looking for?
Some sort of snake monster?

461
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,114
No, the answer is in this book.

462
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,680
Is that a magical Audubon guide?

463
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,430
Neato.

464
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Mmm.

465
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,199
It's good. What is it?

466
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,071
Hooch. I spent a little time
in a Siberian gulag.

467
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,720
Got a taste for it.

468
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,840
Where I was,
it felt like 500 years.

469
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,239
Time worked differently
in that realm.

470
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,914
Oh, I've been in a lot of cages,

471
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,909
but not a magical one.

472
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
What was it like?

473
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,470
The inside of my cage
was a constant battle

474
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,313
between creatures
from your worst nightmare.

475
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,074
I got to know some of them better
than I wanted to.

476
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,552
It was a dismal and a dark dimension

477
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,074
like nothing here on Earth.

478
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,911
And I'll be damned
if I'm ever going back.

479
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,960
Well, cheers to that.

480
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Friendship bracelet?

481
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,391
No, it's an "I'm sorry" bracelet.

482
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,800
I shouldn't have run off like that.

483
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,759
It's just that,
you know I'm not normal

484
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,376
and I think you hit a nerve
or something.

485
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,153
No, I'm sorry.

486
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,760
I never even thought about the fact
that you've never been a kid.

487
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,678
- Yeah.
- But this is really good.

488
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,512
I confiscated it from Alexis.

489
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,436
See? I'm weird.

490
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,276
Do you know that those two actors
who are my parents,

491
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,591
I keep a picture of them
on my desk in my office

492
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,558
just so I can try to feel
a little bit normal.

493
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,712
Yeah. That is anything but normal.

494
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,155
- Yeah.
<i>- Guys.</i>

495
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,754
<i>I think we've ID'd our monster.</i>

496
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,954
Constantine and I found a skin suit
shed by something called a shtriga.

497
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,913
- Come again?
<i>- A shtriga.</i>

498
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,760
It's a vampiric witch that feeds off
the life force of children.

499
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,271
Bloody brilliant setting up shop
at summer camp.

500
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,914
There's some good news, sort of.

501
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,635
It says here the shtriga feeds slowly
off its prey,

502
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,956
draining its life energy
over a course of days.

503
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,631
Which means the missing kids
could still be alive.

504
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,274
Then it's on you guys to find them.

505
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
Aye.

506
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,872
Look, and it's on us
to protect these girls.

507
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,560
Now, I know you think I'm crazy,

508
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,552
but what if the best way
to protect them

509
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,199
is by becoming one of them?

510
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,951
We'll lure the creature out.
We'll be the bait.

511
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,040
What if Constantine's potion
doesn't work on me?

512
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,720
There is only one way to find out.

513
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,470
And if does, I'll be with you
every step of the way.

514
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,956
I'll show you the ropes,
teach you how to be a kid.

515
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,070
Pinky swear?

516
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,750
Pinky swear.

517
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,400
All right, lights out, everyone.

518
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,776
And that means you, too,
Hopper Cabin.

519
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,120
Don't make me come in there.

520
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,791
You feel anything yet?

521
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,680
Um...

522
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,640
No. Maybe it doesn't work.

523
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,516
The pretty lights tell me otherwise.

524
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,952
Hey, what are you two doing in here?

525
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,155
Oh, snap!

526
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,798
Where'd you guys come from
out of the blue?

527
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,400
Got kicked out of Clarke Cabin

528
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,630
for putting a frog

529
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,916
under Christi Donovan's pillow.

530
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,240
You should've heard her scream.

531
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,876
Cool. And you?

532
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,755
I was kicked out because I was
caught reading after lights out.

533
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,999
Reading? Lame.

534
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,436
Uh, her counselors only thought
she was reading,

535
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,194
but really she was writing a letter
to her boyfriend.

536
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,720
He lives in France.

537
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,233
This year's counselors are the worst.

538
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,999
Especially Lake Beast.

539
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,954
Yeah, I heard she smells bad.

540
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,080
Hey!

541
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,070
Um, yeah, I heard she looked really
funny when she fell into the water.

542
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,040
But you're lucky
she didn't catch pneumonia.

543
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,232
That's a very serious illness.

544
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,758
Uh, sure.

545
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,275
You must have had balls
to survive that hellhole.

546
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,836
Did what I had to.

547
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,154
Shapeshifted into whatever monster
would keep the others off my back.

548
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,113
But you know exactly what it's like.

549
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,196
Pretending to be something
worse than you are to survive.

550
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,156
Well, there's that.

551
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,357
And there's finding
someone you trust.

552
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,836
I did time in supermax
with my old partner.

553
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,997
It's hard to plot against a team.

554
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,112
I spent all my time
shapeshifting and running.

555
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,560
I never stuck around
in one place long enough

556
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,438
to find anyone that I could trust.

557
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,320
Well, you gotta start somewhere.

558
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,118
Hey, it's me, Sara.

559
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,560
- You guys still out there?
<i>- Sara.</i>

560
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,400
The potion actually worked.

561
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,279
You didn't know if it was gonna work
before you gave us the potion?

562
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,680
Of course I didn't. I've never
tested it on humans, have I?

563
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,830
Damn it, John.

564
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,673
<i>Well, just see it like this.</i>

565
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,594
You two have now turned yourselves
into irresistible shtriga bait.

566
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,319
So, any suggestions on

567
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,677
how a couple of kids can take on
a magical, child-eating hag?

568
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,990
Mmm...

569
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,390
Well, if you're in a pinch,
you can always try

570
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,359
<i>capsicum annuum,</i> more commonly
known as cayenne pepper.

571
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
Witches hate the stuff,

572
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,176
but you'll be fine. Cheers, love.

573
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,397
Great. But where are we
gonna get cayenne pepper?

574
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,910
Follow my lead.

575
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,191
The shtriga's lair
can't be far now.

576
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,678
Look. A camper must have tried
to hide from the shtriga here.

577
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,656
What are you doing?

578
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,592
- Oh, a spell?
- Yup.

579
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,635
A will-of-the-wisp.

580
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,430
Little bugger will lead us
to whoever owns that shirt.

581
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,999
Oh, go on, then. Light the way.

582
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,430
Look at us,
a pair of magical detectives.

583
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,056
Oh, and I was beginning to think
you were all right,

584
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,160
and you went and said that.

585
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,275
You know, there are other dabblers
of the dark arts out there

586
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,520
who think that I'm all right.

587
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,313
Referring to Nora Darhk, are we?

588
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,376
You best stay away
from that witch, mate.

589
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,039
Not even your big heart
can keep you safe

590
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,112
from someone who's wrestled
with literal demons.

591
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,955
What about you?
You're one of us now.

592
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,952
You even dressed up
for a little while.

593
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,072
You've wrestled with demons
and you're good...

594
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,276
Listen to me, all right.

595
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,149
You know, I had a friend like you.

596
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,595
Someone good, someone who trusted me.

597
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,639
Be smarter than him, all right?

598
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,915
Save yourself, Ray Palmer.

599
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,912
Because people like
me and Nora Darhk,

600
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,032
we're bloody hell
for people like you.

601
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,080
Truth or dare?

602
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
Truth.

603
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,351
I think you meant dare?

604
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,236
Dare?

605
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,000
Dare, I mean dare.

606
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,274
I dare you to sneak out of the cabin
and break into the mess hall.

607
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,718
But to prove
that you didn't chicken out,

608
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,277
you have to bring us something
back from the kitchen.

609
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,520
Ooh...

610
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,273
This must be the place.

611
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,752
Alexis, who would you rather
have babies with?

612
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,432
Jonathan Taylor Thomas
or Mario Lopez?

613
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,275
I ran into some trouble.

614
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,113
I knew it, she chickened out.

615
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,720
I tried to carry more, but I could
only sneak out with two of these.

616
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,280
I know you missed
the ice cream social, so...

617
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,000
Ice cream social is coming to you.

618
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,034
Rocky road and mint chocolate chip,

619
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,270
you are the best ever.

620
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,031
And I have something just for us.

621
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,990
That's my girl.

622
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,509
Oh, I've seen enough
horror movie trailers

623
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,795
to know this won't end well.

624
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,096
Oh, those films are nothing compared
to the horrors you might see

625
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,395
in real life.

626
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,630
Are... Are we too late?

627
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,997
I'll need an incantation,
a crystal and a conduit

628
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,037
to draw the pilfered life force
from the shtriga

629
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,236
and back into their bodies.

630
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,439
Now just follow my lead
and do everything I say.

631
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,389
We really needed this.

632
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,080
Camp's been kind of rough this year.

633
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,436
What do you mean?

634
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,754
It's okay, you can talk to us.

635
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,672
We're super worried about
Lenise and Meredith.

636
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,471
We didn't want to say anything
for the longest time.

637
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,031
We thought we'd get in trouble
and ruin everything.

638
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,516
Ruin what?

639
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,790
The midnight meetup.

640
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,240
It's a tradition.

641
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,440
Every summer, girls take turns
choosing guys they like

642
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,680
to meet up with in the woods.

643
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,231
<i>There's a string
that starts near the flag pole</i>

644
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,879
and it leads out
into the meeting spot.

645
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,435
It changes every year.

646
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,516
So, they meet up
and what's supposed to happen next?

647
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,912
Well, you're supposed to have
your first kiss and come back.

648
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,875
<i>But Lenise and Meredith
never came back.</i>

649
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,358
We got to be getting close, right?

650
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,916
What was that?

651
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,751
It's way past lights out.

652
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,149
What punishment should I cook up
for you?

653
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,039
Come here, you two.

654
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,433
Get off me, you crusty old witch!

655
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,559
My eyes!

656
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,629
Is she dead?

657
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,400
All right, our team's dealing with
something called a shtriga.

658
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,736
Do you know anything
that could help them fight it?

659
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,993
Oh, a shtriga?
Very intelligent and very deadly.

660
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,829
If you want my help,
it's gonna cost you.

661
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,800
Great. Will that come
in the form of another haiku,

662
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,917
or can we expect something
a little more detailed?

663
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,913
What's that? What's that eye thing?

664
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,953
According to legend,
shtrigas are nasty old women.

665
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,758
But the one that I met in prison,
the one that you're looking for,

666
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,678
is beautiful. And he's a bloke.

667
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,759
Hmm.

668
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,515
What the hell are you doing?

669
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,392
Hey, you don't have
another bathroom break for...

670
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,761
Oh, that's right, never,
since you tried to break my face.

671
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,078
It is now or never.

672
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,916
Fine. Whatever.

673
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,430
Guys, this shtriga thing
is not an old woman.

674
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,920
What's going on out here?

675
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,034
<i>You are looking for
a young, handsome dude.</i>

676
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,600
All right,
you ready, big man?

677
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,470
On with the show, then.

678
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,776
What did you guys do to her?

679
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,280
We didn't do anything.

680
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,033
Look, it's not safe
for you guys out here.

681
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,273
Okay? You're coming with me.

682
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,160
We can take care of ourselves.

683
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,757
You're coming with me
whether you like it or not.

684
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,256
You think you're so tough?

685
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,192
I don't think it... I know it!

686
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,360
It's working.

687
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,434
It worked.

688
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,155
Ooh, that was worse than a hangover.

689
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,356
Oh, no.

690
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,600
No, no, no. Come on, lad, wake up.

691
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,512
Wake up, lad! Wake up, come on, son!

692
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,710
Damn it.

693
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,480
Bollocks!

694
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,240
I'm not losing another kid.

695
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,520
What are you doing?

696
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,040
John!

697
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,636
John.

698
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,431
John, John. John.

699
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,230
Damn it.

700
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,396
Hey.

701
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,555
Any of you got a light?

702
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,950
What happened?

703
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,918
You saved him. You saved Randall.

704
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,960
Well, that's good.

705
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,394
I'll get you back to the ship.

706
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,320
I'm not sure how I'm gonna get
the rest of you out.

707
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,360
Found you guys! We got worried
when you didn't show up for dinner.

708
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,874
Those kids look famished. Get them
water and electrolytes, stat.

709
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,720
And that gurney we just made out of
rope and wood, bring it in.

710
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,359
Had a hunch it would come in handy.

711
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,630
How did you find us?

712
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,593
Displacement and direction.

713
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,800
Just like you taught us.

714
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,917
Good job, Tobey.

715
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,636
John's potion will
be wearing off soon.

716
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,511
And it's back to our normal lives

717
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,071
where we are only responsible
for babysitting Rory and Gary.

718
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,200
I'd like to thank you for giving me
real childhood memories.

719
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,989
To be honest, these memories
have been kind of awful,

720
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,398
mostly awkward, but totally awesome.

721
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,117
I mean, it wouldn't be childhood
without all the above.

722
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,556
I'm happy it was with you.

723
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,160
And considering all the trouble
those kids went through for a kiss,

724
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,794
I'm guessing no childhood
would be complete without one.

725
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,076
Couldn't help but notice
our magical friend

726
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,157
is not where she's supposed to be.

727
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,800
Oh, she's not?

728
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,318
Rory, do you know
anything about that?

729
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:00,038
You don't pay me enough
to be a stinking prison guard.

730
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,554
I don't pay you anything.

731
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,591
Well, I let the fake Amaya go.

732
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,399
Why would you do that?

733
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,550
Oh, in order to...

734
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,197
Have an extreme makeover.

735
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,760
Thanks for the shtriga tip.

736
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,390
Well, if you had
your hands full with a shtriga,

737
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,235
I figured you'd need my help
with whatever you plebs face next.

738
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,631
Sounds like
a mutually-beneficial partnership.

739
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,516
One condition, though.

740
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,350
I never set foot in that cage
ever again.

741
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,630
Got it?

742
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,554
Mr. Constantine's body
is rejecting my treatments.

743
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,154
His odds of survival are bleak.

744
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,357
John, what you did out there
was pretty selfless.

745
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,750
I told you you were good.

746
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,669
That's not good for you.

747
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,590
Get some rest, John.

748
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,680
Gideon, give him the good stuff.

749
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,600
Oh, Gideon.

750
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,838
That was nice, love,
we should party more...

751
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,155
He's getting worse.

752
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,074
The magic he used to save
that camper was pretty powerful.

753
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,038
Well, if magic has him
on death's door,

754
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,998
then maybe magic can save him.

755
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,960
I think I know someone who can help.

756
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,393
But I have no idea how to find her.

757
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,799
Just one final ingredient.

758
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,429
I trust you'll find
that my potion is magical.

759
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,995
Ugh!

760
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,509
You call that soup?

761
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,397
Oh, I... I can start over.

762
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,472
The Ren fair opens in an hour.

763
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,116
You know what? Forget it.

764
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,520
It's not like folks come to this tent
for the food anyways.

765
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,680
I'm sorry?

766
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,272
They come for the lusty wenches.

767
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,594
I'm...

768
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,720
I'm a witch.

769
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,750
Okay. Well, as long as
it's a lusty witch, okay?
