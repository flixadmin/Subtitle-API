1
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:13,166
<i>Professor!
Professor! Professor!</i>

2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,875
Professor! Professor!

3
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:15,750
Tell me where you put the gold.

4
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:19,958
I don't know.

5
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,250
Asshole.

6
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,375
I knew you would say that.

7
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:29,791
Take a look.

8
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,083
This is what you achieved.

9
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,250
Look the kid in the eye!

10
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:44,333
And tell him that,
on top of his countless list of crimes,

11
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,625
now he's added the death of five soldiers.

12
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:48,708
A life sentence. Tell him.

13
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,625
Kid, how old are you?

14
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,041
Twenty-three.

15
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:55,833
Twenty-three years as a free man,
but not a single day more. Get used to it.

16
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,125
All thanks to this guy.

17
00:01:58,083 --> 00:02:00,291
Same for Stockholm, huh? Look at her.

18
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,375
Look at her, you piece of shit!

19
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:06,541
By the time she gets out,
her son will be a 45-year-old man.

20
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:11,708
Do you enjoy causing all that suffering,
you son of a bitch? You enjoy it?

21
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,166
And there's Denver.
What are you gonna say to him?

22
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,708
Tell him that he lost his son,
just like he lost his father?

23
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:21,333
And both times
the same person was responsible, you!

24
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,083
Did you actually love her?

25
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:26,500
Well, look at her.

26
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:30,125
Because I want you to remember that face
every single day you're in prison,

27
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,958
thinking that if you'd only
just stayed away from her,

28
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:38,125
she would still have a life,
a mother, a daughter.

29
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,916
But now she's got nothing!

30
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,125
And I don't give a shit what you're
planning to do with the fucking gold.

31
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,083
Because I won't even try to find it.

32
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,500
One of them will tell me where it is.

33
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,166
Do you know why?

34
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,958
Because whoever tells me
is gonna get a completely new life.

35
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,500
Prison for life

36
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,458
or life restored.

37
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:17,791
One of you is gonna make today
the happiest day of your life.

38
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,666
And of my life!

39
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,703
I'm really glad you're so happy right now,
because the storm clouds are coming.

40
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:31,208
You don't get it, Tamayo.

41
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,625
What you believe to be
the end of the game...

42
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,458
is actually only just the beginning.

43
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,583
On your knees.

44
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,083
<i>The Professor was playing
the biggest poker game in history.</i>

45
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,625

<i>Even though he didn't have any cards,</i>

PALAWAN, PHILIPPINES

57
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,291
TWO MONTHS AFTER THE FIRST HEIST

58
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,750
<i>After the heist
at the Royal Mint of Spain,</i>

59
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:40,875
<i>the Professor spent his days haunted
by the guilt of his brother's death.</i>

60
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,916
<i>He felt like he'd pushed Berlin away
from the Bank of Spain heist</i>

61
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,750
<i>so he could pull his own job.</i>

62
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:49,875
<i>And now he was dead.</i>

63
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,875
<i>So, after sleepless nights,</i>

64
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,083
<i>he found solace in an obsession,</i>

65
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:00,166
<i>figuring out the impossible heist
at the Bank of Spain.</i>

66
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,250
<i>Maybe Berlin and Palermo
knew how to get the gold out.</i>

67
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,458
<i>But the real impossible challenge</i>

68
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,750
<i>was something else.</i>

69
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,916
<i>We know
how to get the gold out.</i>

70
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,208
But how do you get out

71
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,000
without handcuffs?

72
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,125
For a long period of time,
I've studied this.

73
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,125
And the starting point is very simple.
Step one...

74
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,541
we tell them the truth.

75
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:33,625
We'll show them
how we got the gold out, with videos.

76
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,708
And we'll do it from Pakistan.

77
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,500
Shakir.

78
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
In eight minutes,

79
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,583
the show begins.

80
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,125
STATEMENT FROM THE GANG

81
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,666
<i>To all of our passionate amigos
and fellow lovers of the heist genre</i>

82
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,000
<i>as well as any curious onlookers, welcome.</i>

83
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,458
<i>We're gonna explain to you</i>

84
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,958
<i>how to get the gold out
of a state's national reserve.</i>

85
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,500
<i>In this instance, Spain.</i>

86
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:11,750
<i>So we invite you to come with us
as we dive into the fascinating journey</i>

87
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,041
<i>through the heart
of the biggest heist of all time.</i>

88
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,041
Hundreds of servers are transmitting
that signal simultaneously.

89
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,291
It's gone viral.
TV stations are already streaming it live.

90
00:07:20,375 --> 00:07:21,375
<i>Breaking news.</i>

91
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:24,041
<i>The robbers say they emptied
the gold vault of the Bank of Spain,</i>

92
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,958
<i>and they're about to show us live
exactly how they did it.</i>

93
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,083
<i>Spain may have lost its national reserve,</i>

94
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,333
<i>which could lead to
unimaginable repercussions...</i>

95
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:34,333
<i>...is that the vault would be
flooded with water. What's the solution?</i>

96
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,666
<i>We weld this steel pipe to the vault
so that a diver can get in.</i>

97
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,791
They made it easy...
so everyone in Spain gets it.

98
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:43,875
<i>...one of the greatest heroes
of this heist. Bogotá, how are you?</i>

99
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:46,375
<i>Do you have any idea
how many ingots you got out?</i>

100
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,541
<i>Yes, I do... 7,258.</i>

101
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,458
<i>Twelve kilos and a half.
600,000 euros each.</i>

102
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,416
<i>That's about 4 billion, 355 million euros.</i>

103
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,100
<i>- Lots of dough.
- Anything else you wanna say?</i>

104
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,708
<i>- I'd like to say "hi" to my kids.
- Take it away, big guy.</i>

105
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:05,000
<i>My incredible kids, Emilio in Venezuela,
Julián in Mexico City,</i>

106
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,541
<i>Erik in Iceland. Hanna in Finland...</i>

107
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,625
Now it's airing on CNN.

108
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:17,291
<i>...Ivanna in Odessa. A kiss to all of you
from your papa.</i>

109
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,666
<i>That was very moving.</i>

110
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,958
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

111
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,708
<i>if you wanna know how we managed to get
90 tons of gold out of the Bank of Spain,</i>

112
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:27,416
<i>don't touch that dial.
New video coming up soon.</i>

113
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,333
NEW INSTALLMENTS COMING SOON

114
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,291
This could be very bad for us.

115
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,500
<i>They managed to bypass
every security measure in place.</i>

116
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:37,166
<i>Why are they telling us how they did it?</i>

117
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,583
<i>Why now?
To pressure the Spanish government?</i>

118
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,875
You think I don't know what you're doing?

119
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,875
You're trying to provoke
a financial crisis,

120
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,083
get the country against the ropes,
and then blackmail me with all of that.

121
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:49,958
Well, bad news for you, because I'm backed

122
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,500
by the Bank of Central Europe.
They'll inject cash or buy debt if needed.

123
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:56,333
And I can also completely halt
stock exchange trading.

124
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,708
What do you think of that?

125
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:02,541
You can take your little financial storm
and shove it up your ass.

126
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,708
And step two?

127
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,958
2. THE CASINO

128
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:15,333
See, financial markets are pretty much
like a gigantic gambling house.

129
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:16,708
You can bet on anything.

130
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,041
On the New York Stock Exchange rising,
on wheat dropping,

131
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,750
or on a country collapsing.

132
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:25,000
You can place your bet and win
so much money, and it's perfectly legal.

133
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:28,250
And what are we going to give
to all those funds

134
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:32,166
and all those corporations desperately
in search of a victim to profit from?

135
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,291
Assurance.

136
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,666
When we tell them
the gold is outside of the bank,

137
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,208
betting against Spain
will become the market's winning horse.

138
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,750
And at the same time,
all that panic will drive the investors

139
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,125
to massively sell out
Spanish debt and shares,

140
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,333
which will then cause...

141
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,291
the stock market to plummet,
and even more significantly,

142
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,916
the risk premium
will skyrocket over 800 points.

143
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,208
And what does that mean?

144
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:08,625
That in a matter of hours, Spain won't
be able to get funds from the markets.

145
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,708
It'll become insolvent
and therefore bankrupt.

146
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:11,791
Exactly.

147
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,375
It'll be like a domino effect,

148
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,791
which will generate colossal pressure
on the government.

149
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,541
And then we will be the only ones

150
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,958
able to stop all of that
with a single gesture...

151
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,041
giving back the gold.

152
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,333
Uh, what?

153
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:38,375
Uh, just making sure I got this all right.

154
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:42,416
Are you telling me that my life depends
on placing a fucking bet, Professor?

155
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,809
On the market tumbling or not tumbling?
What if it doesn't?

156
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,708
It always happens this way, Denver.
Like it did in Greece.

157
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:52,291
It's the very nature of the system.
It's designed to do that automatically.

158
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:54,416
And it's predictable.

159
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,540
You know what's predictable?
Going through a tunnel.

160
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,958
Because you get in one side
and you get out the other.

161
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,250
That's predictable.
But this is beyond our control.

162
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,416
- Denver, stop...
- No, don't "Denver, stop" me.

163
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,208
He can't play with our lives like that.
Let me tell you something.

164
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,041
It's not gonna work, okay?

165
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,708
You came in here
to make sure no one would talk

166
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,750
so that you could keep blackmailing me.

167
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,541
Great, now that we all know

168
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:20,125
that this economic scheme
is nothing but a fucking hoax,

169
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,416
do you know what I'm gonna do?

170
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,125
I'm going to question all of you
one by one.

171
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,750
And whoever doesn't tell me anything,

172
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,125
they're gonna go out
through that fucking door,

173
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,416
directly to a new life in a prison cell.

174
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,041
Barefaced,

175
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:40,125
with all those TV cameras on you,
so that there's no going back.

176
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,833
Each one you take out,

177
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,375
each person, I swear to you,

178
00:11:43,458 --> 00:11:46,208
equals ten tons of gold
you'll never recover.

179
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,375
Son of a bitch.

180
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,375
I told you that was a game
you couldn't play.

181
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,958
- Denver, shut up. The game is on.
- "Shut up"?

182
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,708
- Denver.
- What?

183
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:00,791
Shut up.

184
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,125
Shut up? Shut up?

185
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:05,541
We're all here right now,
all on our knees,

186
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,625
with a fucking rifle against our necks!

187
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,625
- Because we listened to this psycho!
- Shut up!

188
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:12,541
- I won't shut up!
- Denver, shut the fuck up!

189
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,041
Take those two and separate them
from the rest of the gang.

190
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,250
Denver, you're going to be the first one.

191
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,333
Denver. Remember what I said!

192
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:35,375
Someone stole the gold.
If anyone finds out, it's over.

193
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:39,000
I swear on our son
that I'll get you out of here.

194
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,708
Denver, don't do anything.

195
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:42,958
Denver, listen to me.

196
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:46,083
Denver, remember what I told you!

197
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,875
<i>And while the gang
was up against the ropes...</i>

198
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,541
This pump is used
to suck aggregate from the sea bottom.

199
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:00,208
With this much driving force,
they could send all the gold upstream.

200
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,291
<i>...Ángel thought he'd finally found
the right thread to pull.</i>

201
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:05,958
We've been looking
in the wrong direction the entire time.

202
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,291
<i>But that was just part
of Plan Tom Thumb.</i>

203
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,583
I need eight men at the door,
immediately, now. We're leaving.

204
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,541
Where the fuck do you hide
90 tons of gold, Benjamín?

205
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,250
In a... In a forest.

206
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:22,125
Or in the desert.
Or an abandoned place no one knows about.

207
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:26,125
We need to think like them,
like an engineer, a graduate of MIT.

208
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,208
Minimize the risks.

209
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:33,208
And to minimize the risks,
you have to make sure that no moron

210
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:36,583
will come around looking for coins
with a metal detector someday.

211
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,291
And there's only one way to do that,

212
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:39,625
limiting the access...

213
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,708
A private property.

214
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,291
Exactly.

215
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:47,041
A private property, which by the way needs
to be close enough to the stormwater tank.

216
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,208
These people knew the plan perfectly,

217
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,791
but with Berlin dead,

218
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,208
they didn't even imagine
the heist would ever take place, though.

219
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,208
Holy shit!

220
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:01,458
They started to act
the moment the heist began.

221
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,458
We have to look for any land
that was bought in the last five days.

222
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,916
All roads will lead to the same place.

223
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,291
The land property records.

224
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,333
Then we need to go in fully armed.

225
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,125
This could be your new identity, Denver.

226
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,583
And there's more.

227
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:29,333
Three million euros for a new start,
financial freedom.

228
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:32,916
You could buy a house with a jacuzzi,
throw some nice little parties...

229
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,833
In the country of your choosing.

230
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,708
And also a lifetime allowance
of 25,000 euros a month

231
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:41,000
at the expense of the Government of Spain.

232
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,666
A premium pension.

233
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
What do you think?

234
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,958
And, uh, what happens to my family?

235
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,375
We can make an exception.
Two for one.

236
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,416
If you tell me where the gold is,

237
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,166
Stockholm, you, and your kid,
who's hiding out there somewhere,

238
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,375
will be able to start from zero.

239
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,416
Okay, but I don't know
where to find the gold.

240
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,500
It's the truth. I don't know.

241
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,750
Look, Denver, you know something,
and I need an informer

242
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,583
who can give me
all the details of the plan.

243
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:23,666
I'll find the gold later,
but you'll get your freedom anyway.

244
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,416
I know it's fucking tough,

245
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,333
but you don't even have to
say it out loud if you don't want to.

246
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,541
All you have to do

247
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,708
is write down what it is

248
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,916
that Raquel Murillo
doesn't want you to say.

249
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,000
Just a simple answer

250
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,375
for a life of freedom.

251
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,208
Hm. A fucking life of freedom.

252
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:24,541
"Add the fingers on your hand
to the toes on your feet..."

253
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,166
"Plus your cock and your balls,
it adds up to 23."

254
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,500
You can
just stick that in your GPS

255
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,416
and it'll take you directly to the gold.

256
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,750
- Get out of here.
- Fine by me.

257
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:38,833
That was three million. Make sure
it's cash. I don't like going to the ATM.

258
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:39,791
Get him out!

259
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,333
I want a house
in the Dominican Republic! Got it?!

260
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:44,000
I love you.

261
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,041
Come on.

262
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,583
This will be your fate.

263
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,625
I'll give you a moment to picture it
and I'll come back for the next person.

264
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,291
MADRID, FIVE YEARS EARLIER

265
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,375
Sergio, I don't understand.
Why are you planning a heist?

266
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,750
My dad I can understand,
you know?

267
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,553
But you, with all that
knowledge you have...

268
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,125
- Thank you.
- Thanks so much.

269
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:13,750
Why does it suit me?

270
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,625
You're a textbook hedonist.

271
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:21,208
You need your time to, uh,
to enjoy art, uh, love,

272
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,583
traveling... with all that,
you wouldn't have time to work.

273
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,541
Enjoying life doesn't suit me. I get it.

274
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:31,041
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What we do is far more than just work.

275
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:34,416
It's a tradition in our family.
It's our heritage.

276
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,250
It's, uh, really important
that you never forget that.

277
00:19:40,916 --> 00:19:43,791
There are families of doctors, right?
Families of lawyers.

278
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,916
Families who honor a profession.

279
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,708
Your grandfather
inaugurated our family line.

280
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,250
How did it go in Denmark?

281
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,750
The exchange was exquisite.

282
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,083
Where were you when Grandpa was killed?

283
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,333
In the kitchen.

284
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:11,708
They said on the radio
that a robber, uh, had been shot down.

285
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,333
Your grandma froze.

286
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,875
She left the fridge door completely open.

287
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,416
Suddenly,

288
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,583
she came and hugged me.

289
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,208
That's when I knew
my papa was that robber.

290
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,291
Then, the fridge started to beep.

291
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,583
Did you find out like that as well?

292
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:43,208
No.

293
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,708
Well, sure you did, Sergio.
You were there.

294
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,166
You'd just been discharged.

295
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,333
In fact, it was one of the few times
you weren't in the hospital.

296
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,583
I was there, but I already knew.

297
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,166
What?

298
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,125
A noise woke me up that morning.

299
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:03,541
<i>I jumped out of bed,
in my pajamas.</i>

300
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:07,166
<i>I went to the window, the one that was
facing the courtyard, and I saw Papa.</i>

301
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,208
He was loading the trunk.
I thought, "It's the fishing gear."

302
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:15,375
Remember he promised,
when I got out of the hospital,

303
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,458
that we'd go fishing?

304
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,875
<i>So I got dressed and chased after him.</i>

305
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,625
<i>I ran down the stairs.</i>

306
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:25,708
Papa!

307
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,250
<i>I missed him by three seconds.</i>

308
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,291
By three seconds!

309
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,125
So then I grabbed your bicycle.

310
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,375
And I began pedaling as fast as I could.

311
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:50,458
Papa!

312
00:21:50,916 --> 00:21:53,434
<i>I saw the car in the distance.
I was getting closer.</i>

313
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:57,041
He stopped at a traffic light,
but as I was about to reach him,

314
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,333
<i>the light turned green.</i>

315
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,500
Papa!

316
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,625
He kept escaping me.

317
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,541
<i>And I saw him in the distance.</i>

318
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,500
He was changing cars.

319
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,041
<i>And after five, six minutes...</i>

320
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,083
<i>I saw the car parked without him in it.</i>

321
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,208
<i>And then...</i>

322
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,083
<i>...I heard two gunshots.</i>

323
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:41,958
<i>I was scared to death.</i>

324
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:47,416
<i>And then I saw Papa
coming out of the bank.</i>

325
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:49,083
- Don't move!
- Freeze!

326
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,083
On the ground, now!

327
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:52,875
<i>And he saw me.</i>

328
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:05,125
Then they started yelling at him,
"On your knees!"

329
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:07,333
- On your knees!
<i>- "On your knees."</i>

330
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:09,916
On your knees!
Get on the ground right now!

331
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,291
Right now! On the ground!

332
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,541
He didn't do it, Andrés.

333
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,958
Because he was looking at me.

334
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:26,916
And...

335
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:54,125
BANK OF SPAIN

336
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,416
That's how I found out.

337
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:17,208
And what did you do?

338
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,208
Nothing. I just... went home.

339
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,333
Sergio, I... I was there when you got home.

340
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:24,416
Yeah.

341
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,625
Why didn't you say anything?

342
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,916
Well, because for me, it was like a movie.

343
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,250
Papa would always tell stories about...

344
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,791
about heists and all that
as if they were a movie.

345
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,500
And, uh,

346
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,708
while I was pedaling
on the way home, I thought...

347
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,750
"This is just a movie."

348
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:47,416
"And if I don't say anything,

349
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:50,041
it'll always be."

350
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,416
And it worked. It worked,

351
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,041
until I heard the radio.

352
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,750
So when you ask me
why I choose to plan the heists,

353
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:04,875
the answer is simple.

354
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:06,833
To talk to him.

355
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:14,791
The night before, he told me
about his dream to rob the Royal Mint.

356
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:18,208
And we both
laughed our asses off.

357
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:22,416
"Can you imagine
a machine that can make money?"

358
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:28,958
Now I'm the one who's narrating movies.

359
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:31,934
I ask him, "Papa, what do you think?
How's this or that part of the plan?"

360
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:34,625
Um... "Do you see any weak points?"

361
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:39,833
We talk a lot.

362
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:50,291
More often than I talk
to any other living person.

363
00:26:11,666 --> 00:26:14,208
- Tell me.
<i>- We found the Professor's base.</i>

364
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:17,708
No sign of the gold.
They burned everything before escaping.

365
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:19,708
Fuck, Ángel.
Can you give me some good news?

366
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:22,166
Looks like they melted the gold
back into ingots

367
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,416
maybe so it's easier to carry.

368
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,666
And Colonel, we can
probably trace those trucks.

369
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,000
Go talk to Interpol.

370
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,723
We need to issue an international warrant

371
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,550
and get all those
European satellites looking.

372
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,000
<i>We're going to find them, Ángel.</i>

373
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:36,083
Okay.

374
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:39,291
PASAIA PORT, 3:07 A.M.

375
00:26:39,791 --> 00:26:43,916
<i>Those trucks were the breadcrumbs
Marseille was leaving on his path.</i>

376
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,458
<i>Traces on a road that wasn't taken.
Of a loot that wasn't there</i>

377
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:50,208
<i>whose only purpose
was to drive the police crazy.</i>

378
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:18,291
And so?

379
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,625
We don't have the backing
of the Bank of Central Europe.

380
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:31,250
They're very skeptical...

381
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:35,333
about how to manage the crisis.

382
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:39,083
And what does... does that mean?

383
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,166
Minister?

384
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,666
They'll let us fall apart.

385
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,708
The stock market
plummeting 14% today in three hours

386
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:52,500
will be a joke

387
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:55,875
compared to what will happen
at nine in the morning

388
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,375
when the markets open.

389
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:02,000
You've got the mastermind
of the operation in there,

390
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:04,583
on his knees, beaten, and handcuffed.

391
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:06,666
Tell me what the fuck
you're doing in here!

392
00:28:15,708 --> 00:28:17,125
You, get out of here.

393
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:21,916
You son of a bitch!

394
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:23,625
No!

395
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:25,875
You know, you're wrong about me.

396
00:28:25,958 --> 00:28:29,291
Tamayo, if you cross that red line,
there's no turning back.

397
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:32,041
You're saying that to me?

398
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:33,458
Watch this.

399
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:41,375
I need you to understand one thing,
or I'll smash that little head of yours.

400
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:43,250
You won't have an autopsy.

401
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:46,291
I'll tear you apart, punch after punch
in front of your girlfriend.

402
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:50,291
And I won't stop until you tell me
where the gold is or until you die

403
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:52,250
because either I win or no one does.

404
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:54,583
Stop!

405
00:29:00,416 --> 00:29:02,833
And what if you're wrong
about what it means to "win"?

406
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:08,250
Picture yourself
a few months from now, at home,

407
00:29:08,833 --> 00:29:11,625
listening to the unemployment figures,
the debt maturities.

408
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,208
The whole country

409
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:17,333
plunging into bankruptcy,
into an unprecedented crisis,

410
00:29:17,416 --> 00:29:19,000
into absolute chaos.

411
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,458
Which Tamayo would have won more?

412
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:26,791
The one who arrested us?
The one who killed us and lost the gold?

413
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,541
Or the one who got it back and stopped
the biggest financial collapse in history?

414
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:36,541
Listen to me.

415
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:39,208
Tamayo...

416
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:42,708
I know you'll struggle to grasp this.
I really do.

417
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:47,166
But in this moment,
we both only have one option.

418
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:48,833
Just one.

419
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:51,166
Either we both win...

420
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,458
or we both lose.

421
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:08,208
I don't know where the gold is.
I don't know.

422
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:12,333
I don't. Lisbon doesn't.
No one in the gang does.

423
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:15,583
What did you expect?

424
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:18,083
You think I'd be here
with that information?

425
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:19,291
I'd never do that.

426
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:21,916
Tamayo, you bury people in the desert.

427
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:26,916
Sooner or later, you would've
squeezed it out of one of us.

428
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:32,500
I couldn't let anyone into the bank
with that information, not even myself.

429
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:38,041
That's our firewall.

430
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:42,666
The gold is already out.

431
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:48,833
It's on the move.

432
00:30:57,166 --> 00:31:00,708
So this is the grand finale,
the last abracadabra, huh?

433
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:05,041
Ninety tons of gold somewhere out there...

434
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:08,750
dancing gracefully.

435
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,208
But you are still right about one thing.

436
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,750
I don't really know how I can win.

437
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:38,333
So maybe both of us have to lose.

438
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,791
Tamayo, you and I are insignificant

439
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:45,916
compared to the impending
economic tsunami.

440
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,541
Absolutely insignificant.

441
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,041
Tamayo, you know there's only one way out.

442
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,125
I know you do.

443
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:09,541
LAND REGISTRY, 6:50 A.M.

444
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:21,541
<i>Buenos días.</i>

445
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,958
<i>The auction has begun.</i>

446
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:24,875
BACK IN 2 HOURS

447
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:27,833
Who's been working here
for longer than 15 years?

448
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:29,791
Longer than 20?

449
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:32,000
Twenty-two?

450
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And sold.

451
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:44,625
Would you come with me?

452
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,416
Today you'll be able to enjoy

453
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,708
the kind of thing
you've been hearing all over the news,

454
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:50,333
cooperation with an armed group.

455
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:53,000
You won't be charged though
because we're forcing you.

456
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,166
Thrilling, huh?

457
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,250
Oh. Yeah.

458
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:59,625
<i>Everyone was after the gold,
like a scavenger hunt.</i>

459
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:03,250
<i>Sierra knew that the gold was
the only way she could avoid jail.</i>

460
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,250
It's here.

461
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,958
<i>And Ángel was scrambling.</i>

462
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:10,750
<i>He took the bait so hard
the fishhook was almost in his stomach.</i>

463
00:33:11,916 --> 00:33:12,916
Tell me!

464
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:16,208
Colonel, we've tracked down the trucks.
They're heading north, on Route 1.

465
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,708
They're at the Pasaia port.

466
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:19,958
The fucking Professor
won't say a word, Ángel.

467
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,416
Get your ass there right now.

468
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,625
I'm getting on a helicopter.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

469
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:33,208
<i>Sergio.</i>

470
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,750
Sergio.

471
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:39,291
Does it hurt?

472
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:40,375
What?

473
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:44,583
- Does it hurt? You're bleeding.
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm fine. I'm fine.

474
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:47,000
I'm... I'm really good. Really good.

475
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,708
I took a couple of punches, but...

476
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:51,500
you should see the other guy.

477
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:55,125
If he stayed here
for two more minutes, I mean...

478
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:57,083
- You'd kick his ass.
- I'd kick his ass.

479
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:01,708
I have no doubt.

480
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm glad to hear that.

481
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,333
If I'm not wrong, the last time we talked,
you called me a coward or something.

482
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:18,041
You yelled at me to shut up.

483
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:19,666
Yeah, I did.

484
00:34:20,916 --> 00:34:22,500
We argue a lot during heists.

485
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:24,125
Mm. Mm-hmm.

486
00:34:24,916 --> 00:34:26,333
Maybe we should give it up.

487
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:31,875
Mm-mm. It's not like canceling
your library membership. No, no, no.

488
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:34,458
You need money.

489
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:37,916
<i>Not to be on the most wanted list
in 130 countries...</i>

490
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,458
Oh, and a new identity.

491
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:42,291
And right now, my face

492
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:45,416
is in no condition for a passport picture.

493
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:50,500
More importantly, you don't want to stop.

494
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:54,708
Let me ask you...

495
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,958
After the Royal Mint of Spain heist,

496
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:00,791
how long did it take you
to start thinking of this one?

497
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:05,958
Hm.

498
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:09,000
Forty-eight hours.

499
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:14,166
Maybe 24.

500
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:19,708
I owed it to my brother.

501
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:22,833
Sure, sure, of course, yeah.

502
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:24,791
Your tribute to dead relatives.

503
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:28,750
Some people throw ashes into the sea,

504
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:31,833
others bring flowers to the cemetery...

505
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:35,791
You rob the national reserve.

506
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:38,291
But you know what?

507
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:40,916
You don't do it for your father

508
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:43,750
or for your brother.

509
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:47,291
You do it for you.

510
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:02,458
Um, no, it's my way
of communicating with them.

511
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:05,625
I mean, how? A Ouija board?

512
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:07,625
No.

513
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:12,083
That's just what you tell yourself.

514
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:15,291
It's easier to say
than to take off your mask.

515
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:18,833
Because I know you love masks.

516
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:24,458
You're always...

517
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,333
playing the role of the nerd,

518
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:31,541
with your glasses, origami...

519
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:33,875
And in reality...

520
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:36,500
In reality, you...

521
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,416
walked into the bank with the confidence

522
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,666
of someone that's about to
arm-wrestle the government.

523
00:36:45,791 --> 00:36:49,291
You are the magic trick, Sergio.

524
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,125
Dressed like Clark Kent.

525
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,208
But it's about time you take it off

526
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:01,583
and accept who you really are.

527
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:03,000
Will you marry me?

528
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,041
Was it a better proposal this time?

529
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:10,625
- Fuck. I did it again, I...
- No...

530
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,508
I suddenly spit it out
like at the motor home.

531
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:14,791
- I just... I can't believe it...
- No. No.

532
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:16,250
It was good. Yeah.

533
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:23,083
And?

534
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:27,125
I will.

535
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:28,583
I'll do it.

536
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,208
Let's win this.

537
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:59,500
No matter how tough things get,
they still love each other.

538
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:07,583
A total of 612 purchases
have gone through in the last five days.

539
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:12,541
Mr. Anselmo Bueno Gutiérrez...
He sold an urban plot...

540
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:15,291
Wait, hold on a sec. Let's keep it short.

541
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:19,083
Give me just the ones bought in cash,
no mortgage.

542
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:21,125
That does narrow down my search.

543
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:22,791
But would you please...

544
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:25,291
would you please
stop pointing a gun at me?

545
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:27,583
- Benjamín...
- Oops, sorry.

546
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:36,083
Here, Doña María Flores González
purchased a lot in Robledo de Chavela.

547
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:40,958
The seller is Rosario Pineda Hernández,
the lot comprising an area of 3,189...

548
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:45,416
<i>While Alicia Sierra realized she
was running out of time to find the gold,</i>

549
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,041
<i>the police were about to have an epiphany.</i>

550
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,625
PLAN TOM THUMB

551
00:38:49,708 --> 00:38:53,625
Our man in the shadows
will scatter breadcrumbs along his path.

552
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:58,041
Marseille, go to the stormwater tank.
When you get there, launch Plan Tom Thumb.

553
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:02,125
<i>At 23:07 on the previous night,</i>

554
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:05,000
<i>they prepared a crime scene
worthy of an Oscar.</i>

555
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,750
<i>The red trucks then
transported their fake loot.</i>

556
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,916
<i>And at 8:10 in the morning,</i>

557
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,750
<i>Ángel thought he found
something extraordinary.</i>

558
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:17,166
Colonel, I've got some footage
of a group of guys

559
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,250
loading pallets from trucks
onto a fishing boat.

560
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:21,833
- What? A fishing boat?
<i>- Breadcrumbs in the sea.</i>

561
00:39:21,916 --> 00:39:24,291
In order to follow them,
they'll need satellites,

562
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,833
so they'll reach out
to NATO for help, to Interpol.

563
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:29,875
They'll scan all the traffic cameras
in Spain. And all that...

564
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:32,708
will make them confident.

565
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:34,250
Could you zoom in?

566
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,291
Zoom in here, on the main screen.

567
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:37,958
Bastards.

568
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:41,500
They're loading the gold onto a boat.

569
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:43,833
Because the harder it is
to follow something

570
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:45,625
and the more it takes to reach it,

571
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:49,333
the more you believe
that what you're going after is real.

572
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:01,500
<i>That's why Tamayo didn't hesitate.</i>

573
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:05,083
<i>The cornerstone of the investigation
was the Virgen del Carmen IV,</i>

574
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:09,208
<i>a vessel used for anchovy fishing
in the Cantabrian Sea.</i>

575
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:12,791
Ángel, where the fuck did that boat go?

576
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:15,666
I don't know, Colonel.
We lost their GPS signal.

577
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,833
<i>Once they have
absolutely no idea where we're going,</i>

578
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,333
<i>they'll discover another turn of events.</i>

579
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:24,416
A random kidnapping at sea.

580
00:40:25,666 --> 00:40:28,833
Colonel, the boat showed up in Cantabria,
100 miles away.

581
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:31,208
The captain and the crew
were tied up in the cabins.

582
00:40:31,291 --> 00:40:32,833
I'm on my way there on the helicopter.

583
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:35,041
What? What do you mean, "tied up"?

584
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:38,000
Because we have to make sure
lots of things are happening

585
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:40,208
<i>so that they won't have any time to think.</i>

586
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:43,750
Okay, then, tell me what happened.

587
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:47,541
Well, uh, we were out there sailing
for about three or four hours.

588
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:50,708
After that, we heard
some noises on the, uh, on the deck.

589
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:52,958
As if someone was working.

590
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:53,875
What kind of noises?

591
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,541
The fishing crane.

592
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:57,958
Like maybe the cargo was being emptied.

593
00:40:58,541 --> 00:40:59,666
Where did they empty it?

594
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:03,041
The ocean. They were throwing
something into the ocean.

595
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:05,958
Oh, fuck off, Ángel. It makes no sense.

596
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:08,375
Why wouldn't they just transfer
the cargo to another boat?

597
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:11,958
- <i>Why would they throw it into the sea?</i>
- I don't know. They had some reason.

598
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:13,625
And that question...

599
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,208
the most important one...

600
00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:20,625
will be answered by forensics.

601
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,250
They burned everything.

602
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:30,041
The few things we were able to restore
are pieces of nautical cartography.

603
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:33,958
They show the Bay of Biscay,
and it's a very wide radius.

604
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:36,583
- How wide?
- Thirty, forty miles.

605
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:40,291
- But there's something else too.
- What's that?

606
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,916
It's a diagram for a depth buoy.

607
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,250
It shows a marking
at 70 meters below the water's surface.

608
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:50,125
It could be a beacon for something
anchored to the sea bottom.

609
00:41:57,625 --> 00:41:58,500
<i>And then,</i>

610
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:01,375
<i>once all that information
is spread out on the table,</i>

611
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:04,208
what had seemed crazy
will suddenly make sense.

612
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:07,791
Because where is the only place

613
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:10,958
you're able to leave
tons of gold for centuries

614
00:42:11,041 --> 00:42:12,583
without anyone finding it?

615
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:19,125
Where can you find
all the lost treasure of Spanish galleons?

616
00:42:19,625 --> 00:42:21,208
The bottom of the ocean.

617
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:24,750
The bottom of the ocean.

618
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:26,500
There's that fucking buoy.

619
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:28,708
We need to mobilize the Navy.

620
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:30,833
I want frigates,
battleships, aircraft carriers,

621
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:32,791
every goddamn fucking thing!

622
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:35,666
We're going to comb the Cantabrian Sea.

623
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,000
CANTABRIAN SEA, 11:54 A.M.

624
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:38,500
<i>We're changing directions.</i>

625
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:41,291
<i>New course, the Bay of Biscay.
Tracking service.</i>

626
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:45,791
<i>Tamayo was desperately trying
to hide that the gold had left the bank.</i>

627
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:50,625
<i>He thought the best way to do this
was to pretend the war wasn't over.</i>

628
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:51,916
Fire at will!

629
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:02,708
We can hear several gunshots
coming from inside the Bank of Spain.

630
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:04,583
<i>Apparently hostilities are continuing,</i>

631
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:06,833
<i>although we still don't have
any more information.</i>

632
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:10,458
Gunshots?

633
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:16,625
Yes, God damn it. Yes!

634
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:18,508
- Hey, can you hear that?
- Shut up!

635
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:20,642
- Know what that means?
- Get down!

636
00:43:24,416 --> 00:43:26,083
It's just a fucking smoke screen.

637
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:30,166
A smoke screen
or they just executed the Professor.

638
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:33,416
We gotta be hopeful.

639
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,791
If the Professor's here,
then we'll be able to leave.

640
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:38,916
Maybe you think too high of the Professor.

641
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,375
We have to think positive.

642
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:43,875
Here we go,
the classic positivity of idiots.

643
00:43:43,958 --> 00:43:45,500
Take a look around you, Rio.

644
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,583
How many clips do you guys have?

645
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,458
I mean, if you wanna think positive,

646
00:43:51,541 --> 00:43:54,833
I guess we can try to take them down
with some good old kung fu,

647
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:57,500
then we escape and catch a train home.

648
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:02,166
Positive thinking is
the downfall of civilization.

649
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,250
I could even kick your ass right now.
I'm that optimistic.

650
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:07,125
And do you know why?

651
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:09,333
Because I was
inside a fucking tomb in Algeria.

652
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:13,125
And all I could think about
was getting out of there, and here I am.

653
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:16,000
You are here
because I got involved in all this.

654
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,291
And this guy here.

655
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:20,625
And that guy there.

656
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:22,208
Understood?

657
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:23,791
Well, I'm with Rio.

658
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:26,750
My whole life I've been in fucking wars.

659
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:28,791
Now I want peace.

660
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,291
So I think about the future,

661
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:33,125
a positive one.

662
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:35,833
I, uh...

663
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:38,291
No one has ever loved me.

664
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:41,208
I've never had a serious relationship.

665
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:44,416
I think it's finally my moment.

666
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,500
Are we in jail by any chance,
formally arrested,

667
00:44:47,583 --> 00:44:49,083
waiting to be judged?

668
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:53,083
Or are we dead inside a plastic bag?
No, right?

669
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:55,583
And why is that?

670
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:00,375
What do you know that I don't?

671
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:06,708
I'm just paying attention
to the signs, my friends.

672
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:10,333
We've been detained for 24 hours
and we're still alive.

673
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:12,500
Denver is out there.

674
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,291
He's arrested.

675
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,625
That's the sign that I see.

676
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:20,208
And it's irreversible.

677
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,166
This guy knows something.

678
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:29,083
You should try a little
positive thinking, my friends.

679
00:45:32,416 --> 00:45:34,250
<i>The last thing Tamayo needed</i>

680
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:37,625
<i>was a video that showed the world
everything he was trying to hide.</i>

681
00:45:37,708 --> 00:45:39,708
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
as promised,</i>

682
00:45:39,791 --> 00:45:42,375
<i>the answer to the question
"How did we get the gold out of here?"</i>

683
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:44,125
<i>It was thanks to this baby.</i>

684
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:49,041
<i>This extraction pump propelled the gold
over a distance of 18 kilometers,</i>

685
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:52,500
<i>to a location where our team outside
collected the nuggets,</i>

686
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,666
<i>melted it down again,</i>

687
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,250
<i>and turned it into gold ingots.</i>

688
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:56,958
That's the blatant proof now

689
00:45:58,166 --> 00:45:59,916
that we don't have the gold.

690
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,916
<i>...the gold has already left
the Bank of Spain.</i>

691
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,791
In today's treasury auction,

692
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:07,500
we're going to lose
billions and billions of euros,

693
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:10,333
week after week,

694
00:46:10,416 --> 00:46:13,000
until we're unable to get any financing.

695
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:17,125
And after that,
the country will go bankrupt.

696
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:19,916
I said to stop the exchange.

697
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,875
I don't care if it's been open
for three minutes. Cut off the trading!

698
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:24,375
The Professor was right.

699
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,458
This is a total shitstorm.

700
00:46:28,541 --> 00:46:31,291
<i>And just when everyone
thought the Spanish economy</i>

701
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:33,166
<i>couldn't be more discredited...</i>

702
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:36,000
- Look at this!
- <i>...came the cherry on top.</i>

703
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:38,583
<i>You could argue that we were lying.</i>

704
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:41,875
<i>But seeing the Navy combing
the sea in search of the gold</i>

705
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:44,791
<i>was inarguable proof
of the success of our heist.</i>

706
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:46,916
Come on, who the fuck
tipped off the press?

707
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,791
Everything I just told you,
multiply it by ten.

708
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:55,708
That is how we close Plan Tom Thumb.

709
00:46:57,166 --> 00:46:58,416
<i>And then finally...</i>

710
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:02,041
finally we'll be
in a position to negotiate.

711
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:10,083
Nothing's been moved around for a while.
The garden is well kept.

712
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:12,500
How many left?

713
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:15,708
One. It's seven kilometers away.

714
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:16,625
Let's go.

715
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,916
It's a stone house built in 1926.
It's rustic.

716
00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:28,041
This one's prefabricated, right?

717
00:47:58,291 --> 00:47:59,708
Check the lawn.

718
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:53,791
Now what do we do?

719
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:58,250
Should we go, "One, two, three,"
then we all kill each other?

720
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,166
Very well.

721
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:23,000
No one can hear us.

722
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:27,875
- I imagine you've got a plan.
- You're going to give a press conference.

723
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:31,208
You'll say that after investigation,
the police...

724
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:33,875
have found the gold.

725
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:41,166
If I do that, then you'd have me
with my pants down.

726
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,208
If I betray you on this,
you'll stop trusting me.

727
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:48,166
- That's not good.
- It shouldn't be a matter of trust.

728
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,458
It should be a matter of life and death.

729
00:49:50,541 --> 00:49:52,333
Suárez, Cañizo, proceed.

730
00:49:53,041 --> 00:49:54,041
On your feet!

731
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:05,041
What the fuck is happening?

732
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:06,416
No fucking clue, Manila.

733
00:50:07,625 --> 00:50:09,791
Trick me, Professor,

734
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:12,000
and you'll watch your friends be executed.

735
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,375
- Suárez, you hear me?
- Copy, Colonel.

736
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:17,958
Now that you know
the game we're playing,

737
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:21,666
do you really want me to go out there
and have a word with the press? Hm?

738
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:25,250
I told you, "Either we both win...

739
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:28,666
or we both lose."

740
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:33,041
I know the plan of how to steal
the gold from the Bank of Spain.

741
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:35,666
The little I don't know, I assume.

742
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:39,041
You wanna give them back the gold
as a bargaining chip, isn't that right?

743
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:40,916
But I won't let that happen.

744
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:44,458
Because the true miracle
was to get it out.

745
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,666
And that part is done.

746
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:49,416
You must be the nephew, right?

747
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,500
Rafael.

748
00:50:59,458 --> 00:51:01,125
Your uncle wrote this for you.

749
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:12,291
Good morning.

750
00:51:12,708 --> 00:51:15,166
I regret to call you here
on such short notice,

751
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,166
but I have an important announcement.

752
00:51:19,958 --> 00:51:22,416
The investigation by the police
has moved forward.

753
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,125
We've intercepted two trucks carrying
the gold reserve of the Bank of Spain.

754
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,000
Please.

755
00:51:28,083 --> 00:51:29,750
And you'll tell them something else.

756
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:31,125
That I came into the bank

757
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:35,875
so I could negotiate the gang's surrender
to prevent any greater harm.

758
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:38,416
On that matter,
he went down to the bank's basement,

759
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,750
48 meters deep,

760
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:42,458
where the other robbers
are still entrenched,

761
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:45,666
fending off the attacks
of the State Security Forces.

762
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:49,291
And you'll conclude
with a message of trust and transparency.

763
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:53,000
As soon as you show up on TV, those trucks
will make their way to the bank.

764
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:55,416
You can escort them along the AP1 North.

765
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:58,375
And how exactly will you give that order
arrested and handcuffed?

766
00:51:58,458 --> 00:51:59,666
It won't be me.

767
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,125
The order is you.

768
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:05,291
Your announcement on TV is the signal.

769
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:08,125
<i>It's all part of the plan.</i>

770
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:11,208
You'll have won,
and the whole world will see it.

771
00:52:36,541 --> 00:52:38,125
<i>A dramatic turn of events.</i>

772
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:40,208
<i>The gold returns to the Bank of Spain,</i>

773
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:42,500
<i>in turn de-escalating
the stock market turmoil.</i>

774
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:47,958
<i>The government and the economists agree
the debt crisis is now under control</i>

775
00:52:48,041 --> 00:52:50,958
<i>and it can be recovered
as fast as its downfall.</i>

776
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:53,416
<i>Right this moment,
civil servants from the Bank of Spain</i>

777
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,000
<i>and the State Security Forces
are unloading the gold</i>

778
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:58,833
<i>from the trucks to get them
all back into the bank's vault.</i>

779
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:02,166
What trucks are those?

780
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:05,125
It's part of the plan.

781
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:06,791
A part of the plan I don't know?

782
00:53:06,875 --> 00:53:10,875
Not <i>every</i> secret should be told in bed.

783
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:12,916
- What the fuck are you saying?
- Relax.

784
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,916
I can't relax, because I don't know
what's happening right now.

785
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:18,375
It was necessary.

786
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:24,416
Maybe you can fool everyone else,
but not me, Sergio.

787
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:28,208
I don't understand.

788
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:34,250
You would never go into the Bank of Spain
to later return the gold. Never.

789
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:36,875
Of course not. I'm doing it to save Rio.

790
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:39,041
Yeah, yeah, sure.
He's a real fantastic kid.

791
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:41,666
Why don't you tell me
the last part of the plan?

792
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,583
No one who's going into the bank
can know the last part of the plan.

793
00:53:47,666 --> 00:53:49,125
Well, I can understand that.

794
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,583
However, in that case, I'm out.

795
00:53:58,458 --> 00:53:59,458
Martín.

796
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,208
What is a country's gold?

797
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:09,958
Its wealth?

798
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:11,041
No.

799
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:15,708
It's... an illusion.

800
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:20,375
<i>It's an illusion.</i>

801
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,833
It's useless.

802
00:54:23,916 --> 00:54:26,583
<i>Spain doesn't pay
for anything with that gold.</i>

803
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:28,583
<i>Not one transaction. Nothing.</i>

804
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:30,583
It's...

805
00:54:30,666 --> 00:54:32,458
It's merely psychological.

806
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,625
<i>Gold for brass.</i>

807
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:51,833
So you'll do to the Bank of Spain
what Berlin did with the Viking treasure?

808
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:54,833
The exchange was exquisite.

809
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:14,041
Get out!

810
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:24,083
The ingots that came in those trucks
are gold-coated brass.

811
00:55:24,166 --> 00:55:25,875
Just gold-coated brass.

812
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:28,416
I warned you.

813
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,083
- Suárez, Cañizo, weapons ready!
- Raise weapons!

814
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:36,583
Tamayo, wait a minute.

815
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:40,833
Those bars have stopped the debt crisis.

816
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,666
Didn't you portray yourself
as a Robin Hood?

817
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:50,500
Now you want to steal
the gold of an entire country?

818
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:02,750
I'm a thief.

819
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:05,541
Son of a thief.

820
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:08,791
Brother of a thief.

821
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,458
I hope someday
to be the father of a thief.

822
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:24,708
No one can reject their nature, Tamayo.

823
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:27,416
I'm leaving you an honorable way out.

824
00:56:28,958 --> 00:56:30,375
Think about it, Colonel.

825
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:34,625
It's almost funny.

826
00:56:35,166 --> 00:56:37,958
You know perfectly well
it fits with the Spanish tradition.

827
00:56:38,458 --> 00:56:42,083
Which other country could have
a national reserve of fake gold

828
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:47,250
and still be one of the most
important economies in the world?

829
00:56:48,583 --> 00:56:50,750
It's the Spanish picaresque.

830
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:54,750
The <i>Lazarillo de Tormes,</i>
it wasn't written in English.

831
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:56,375
Isn't that right?

832
00:56:56,958 --> 00:56:57,958
Tamayo,

833
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,583
you will be a hero.

834
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:02,708
A hero.

835
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:05,041
And this small difference of metals

836
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,083
will be just another state secret.

837
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:12,458
It'll pass down from president
to president for the next 50,

838
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,333
60, 70 years, but at the core...

839
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:19,791
nothing is going to change.

840
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:23,291
- Load them.
- Load!

841
00:57:24,666 --> 00:57:26,416
No, Tamayo. No!

842
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:30,416
Did you really think
you'd get out of here that easily,

843
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,375
leaving me a national reserve
made of brass?

844
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:35,250
Tell me where to find the gold.

845
00:57:35,333 --> 00:57:36,458
- Ten.
- Ten!

846
00:57:38,916 --> 00:57:41,625
The brass reserve is the best
of your options right now, Tamayo.

847
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,708
- Nine!
- You can't do this, Colonel.

848
00:57:43,791 --> 00:57:45,041
You can't do this.

849
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:46,250
- Eight!
- Eight!

850
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:50,500
If they shoot, I'll prove that all you
have out there is nothing more than junk!

851
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:53,583
- Seven.
- I've got videos, I've got documents.

852
00:57:53,666 --> 00:57:55,625
- Everything will go public at once.
- Six.

853
00:57:55,708 --> 00:57:58,250
Do you know what that means?
The debt will skyrocket.

854
00:57:58,333 --> 00:57:59,708
The stock market will plummet.

855
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:01,250
- The country will be broke.
- Five!

856
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:03,375
It'll be total bankruptcy.
You won't have a plan B!

857
00:58:03,458 --> 00:58:04,666
- Four!
- Four!

858
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,791
That brass will be
the best of both worlds! Tamayo!

859
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:08,125
- Three!
- Three!

860
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:09,208
Sergio!

861
00:58:11,708 --> 00:58:13,541
Accept it. All the markets accepted it.

862
00:58:13,625 --> 00:58:16,375
The rest of the world accepted it.
Only you have to accept it.

863
00:58:16,458 --> 00:58:17,666
- It's your only option.
- Two.

864
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:18,910
Two!

865
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:21,958
You'll never get the gold, you hear me?

866
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:24,333
It's not even up to me.
The plan carries on.

867
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:28,250
The gold is our protection,
the ones inside and the ones outside.

868
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:30,125
- It'll never be returned.
- One!

869
00:58:31,166 --> 00:58:34,166
If you shoot, you'll only have
the dead bodies and bankruptcy.

870
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,250
I told you and I'll say it again,

871
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:38,875
either we both win or we both lose!

872
00:58:42,875 --> 00:58:43,875
Colonel,

873
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:47,083
it's time for you to face it.

874
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,583
This is checkmate.

875
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:07,708
Good morning.

876
00:59:11,166 --> 00:59:12,916
The heist is officially over.

877
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,875
The Army's Special Forces
have managed to gain access

878
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:19,458
to the bank's basement
with the use of explosives,

879
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:21,583
releasing the final hostages.

During the operation,
due to strong resistance,

885
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:50,416
the following gang members
have been taken down.

886
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:55,750
Aníbal Cortés, alias Rio.

<i>"What happened to the real gold?"</i>

924

He'd have wanted this.

01:03:46,541 --> 01:03:48,666
Are you sure
he'll give you your share?

926
01:03:49,166 --> 01:03:50,166
Yeah.

927
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,583
It's a matter of family.

928
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:05,458
24 HOURS LATER

929
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,541
We actually made it.

01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,000
- You gotta believe, brother.
- Always.

931

Thank you.

932
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,625
I almost blew it, huh?

933
01:06:21,958 --> 01:06:23,916
This man always has a double twist, right?

934
01:06:25,041 --> 01:06:26,041
You fuckers.

935
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:28,708
I didn't say a word,
by the way.

936
01:06:37,791 --> 01:06:41,000
It didn't all work out the way we wanted.

937
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:47,666
We're not all here.

938

939
01:06:54,916 --> 01:06:56,750
Well, we did achieve something.

01:08:09,708 --> 01:08:11,666
Professor, you have something for me.

942
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:21,875
Lucía?

943
01:08:24,875 --> 01:08:26,083
And Victoria.

944
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:49,375
And the gold?

945
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:53,708
The gold's already in Portugal.

946
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:56,000
It's in a little house.

947
01:08:57,208 --> 01:08:58,583
The little treasure house.

948
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,041
<i>Nobody could've imagined
when this story began</i>

949
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:36,333
<i>that we'd end up being escorted
to safety by an elite military team.</i>

950
01:09:37,166 --> 01:09:40,875
<i>And that we'd fly into our new life
without anyone knowing the truth.</i>

951
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:44,708
<i>A new life, a free life,</i>

952
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:47,041
<i>filled with gold.</i>

953
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:52,291
<i>So that no one in the gang
would ever have to rob a bank again.</i>

954
01:11:30,583 --> 01:11:34,791
<i>♪ I don't care at all ♪</i>

955
01:11:46,291 --> 01:11:49,791
<i>♪ I don't care at all ♪</i>

956
01:12:06,916 --> 01:12:10,625
<i>♪ If I stay with you
If I'm choosing wrong ♪</i>

957
01:12:10,708 --> 01:12:12,833
<i>♪ I don't care at all ♪</i>

958
01:12:14,958 --> 01:12:18,958
<i>♪ If I'm losing now
But I'm winning late ♪</i>

959
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:21,625
<i>♪ That's all I want ♪</i>

960
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:27,208
<i>♪ I don't care at all ♪</i>

961
01:12:30,416 --> 01:12:33,375
<i>♪ I don't care at all ♪</i>

962
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:52,583
