And then you controlled
every single minute of it.

You woke me up at 5:00 a.m.

because he lost all of our savings.

189

He agreed to all of it.

190
00:10:08,913 --> 00:10:13,375
And then, one day, he... he didn't,

191
00:10:13,376 --> 00:10:15,378
so he walked out on us.

I mean, you must have some
rock-solid proof, right?

996
00:59:04,346 --> 00:59:08,349
That it was actually
me who killed your wife.

You must have that,
right? So what is it?

i-is based on fucking feelings?

You and Vogelbaum should have
got your stories straight.

1011
00:59:59,317 --> 01:00:01,318
They were so close.

1012
01:00:01,319 --> 01:00:04,863
So fucking close, but there
was a few little details

1013
01:00:04,864 --> 01:00:07,408
that were different.

1014
01:00:07,409 --> 01:00:09,618
So I went back to Vogelbaum,

1015
01:00:09,619 --> 01:00:13,205
and I managed to squeeze
the truth out of him.
