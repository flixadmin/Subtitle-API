1
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,865
Nitrogen bonds to oxygen,
which in turn...

2
00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:51,827
You do know what a bond is?

3
00:03:54,914 --> 00:03:58,250
A strong force of attraction.

4
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:01,629
Covalent bonds, ionic bonds.

5
00:04:01,837 --> 00:04:06,217
The coming together of atoms
and molecules to form compounds.

6
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:07,885
No?

7
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:14,099
Chemical bonds
are what make matter matter.

8
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:18,395
Bonds are what hold
the physical world together.

9
00:04:18,604 --> 00:04:22,858
- What hold us together.
- Yeah. Yeah. No, I got it.

10
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:24,068
Bonds.

11
00:04:24,985 --> 00:04:28,906
Your test score says otherwise.
It tells me you don't get it at all.

12
00:04:30,282 --> 00:04:33,327
Yeah, but, I mean, 58. I was close.

13
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,918
What is "close"?

14
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:43,087
There's no "close" in science, Barry.

15
00:04:43,295 --> 00:04:46,215
There are right answers
and wrong answers.

16
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:48,676
"Close" didn't put men on the moon.

17
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:52,930
Yeah, but I'm just saying, Mr. White,
two points?

18
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:57,239
Look, if I don't pass chemistry,
I have to go to summer school.

19
00:04:58,686 --> 00:05:02,940
And, I mean, I really studied.
Like, really, really studied.

20
00:05:03,148 --> 00:05:05,943
Like, all night, hard.

21
00:05:06,151 --> 00:05:10,447
And, I mean, I'm so into chemistry
for, like, the concepts.

22
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:16,495
I just think I might have, you know,
the attention deficit...

23
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:19,081
Couldn't you please just let this slide?

24
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:31,302
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

25
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:37,933
The answer is no.
Next time, apply yourself.

26
00:06:21,769 --> 00:06:24,522
<i>Yo. If I know you, leave a message.</i>

27
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,318
Are you ducking me, or what?
This makes the third time.

28
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:34,865
Look, I will be leaving this phone on
for another 15 minutes, so call me.

29
00:06:35,074 --> 00:06:39,995
Oh, and by the way,
that thing we talked about, the...

30
00:06:40,204 --> 00:06:42,873
When I said, "Handle it."

31
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:47,211
Well, don't. Just let it go.

32
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:48,921
All right.

33
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:09,900
Come on.

34
00:07:10,109 --> 00:07:13,112
Jesse, open the door.

35
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,075
I know you're home. Your car is here.
Come on. Hey.

36
00:07:23,831 --> 00:07:25,207
Can I help you?

37
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:27,877
No. Thank you.

38
00:07:28,961 --> 00:07:32,381
Well, I'm the manager, so can we stop
with the pounding, please?

39
00:07:33,382 --> 00:07:34,925
You're the manager?

40
00:07:35,134 --> 00:07:37,595
Yes. Yes, you can help me.
Absolutely.

41
00:07:39,054 --> 00:07:42,683
I very much need to get inside here,
so if you have a master key...

42
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:46,562
- You have a key, right?
- Yeah, I have a key.

43
00:07:49,106 --> 00:07:52,067
Look, the person who lives here

44
00:07:52,276 --> 00:07:55,196
it's just very important
for me to see him.

45
00:07:55,404 --> 00:07:58,282
- And you knocked, right?
- Yeah.

46
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,492
He didn't answer?

47
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:03,037
Which means...?

48
00:08:06,665 --> 00:08:10,711
- Look, I'm his father, all right?
- You're Mr. Jackson?

49
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:15,466
Yes. That's me. Walt Jackson.

50
00:08:15,674 --> 00:08:16,675
And you are...?

51
00:08:17,843 --> 00:08:20,262
- Jane.
- Jane. Very nice to meet you, Jane.

52
00:08:20,471 --> 00:08:22,431
Now, if you wouldn't mind...

53
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,476
Mr. Jackson,
I'm happy to let you use my phone.

54
00:08:25,684 --> 00:08:28,646
- Wanna call him?
- No.

55
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:31,524
No. I...

56
00:08:31,732 --> 00:08:35,194
As I said, I would like
if you let me inside here,

57
00:08:35,402 --> 00:08:38,864
so that I can check on
my son's well-being.

58
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:40,658
You understand?

59
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:43,994
Look, whatever's going on
between the two of you is family.

60
00:08:44,203 --> 00:08:45,996
I don't get involved in family.

61
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:48,605
Jesse doesn't want you in,
you're not getting in.

62
00:08:48,707 --> 00:08:49,708
Period.

63
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:51,627
Sorry.

64
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:59,885
Come on in, Dad.

65
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:06,308
- Thanks.
- You okay?

66
00:09:07,768 --> 00:09:09,311
Yeah.

67
00:09:16,068 --> 00:09:18,112
"Jesse Jackson"?

68
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,072
Do you even...?

69
00:09:21,991 --> 00:09:25,077
Oh, I see you have a telephone, at least.

70
00:09:25,286 --> 00:09:28,622
You know, that blinking thing
I've been calling you on?

71
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,958
Whatever, man.

72
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:36,589
- Hey, give me my... Give...
- I will break this. I will break this!

73
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,467
Damned druggie idiot.
Is this what you've been doing

74
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:42,844
the whole time
I've been trying to reach you?

75
00:09:42,928 --> 00:09:46,724
- No. I've been taking care of business.
- What business?

76
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:48,434
What business?

77
00:09:48,642 --> 00:09:53,314
The business you put me on, asshole.
What, you already forgot?

78
00:09:59,945 --> 00:10:02,072
This business.

79
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:08,412
Does that jog your memory?
Son of a bitch.

80
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,710
- You didn't actually...?
- Hey, you said...

81
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:18,171
You said, "Handle it,"
so, you know, I handled it.

82
00:10:18,255 --> 00:10:21,217
When I said, "Handle it,"
I meant fear and intimidation.

83
00:10:21,425 --> 00:10:23,510
I meant get your money back.
I never meant...

84
00:10:23,594 --> 00:10:25,679
- Oh, didn't mean to kill somebody?
- No!

85
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:28,849
Well, too late, yo, because dude's dead.

86
00:10:29,058 --> 00:10:30,935
- Oh, God.
- All right? Way dead.

87
00:10:31,143 --> 00:10:35,272
- Oh, God.
- Oh, and, hey, hey, hey. Here.

88
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:37,399
Here's your money.

89
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,405
Yeah, 4660 bucks. Your half.

90
00:10:44,156 --> 00:10:49,119
Spend it in good health,
you miserable son of a bitch.

91
00:11:17,565 --> 00:11:20,818
I didn't say I killed him.

92
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:24,655
Tell me what happened.

93
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,494
Dude's wife crushed his head
with an ATM machine.

94
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:33,998
- Crushed his...?
- Crushed his head

95
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:37,251
with an ATM machine right in front of me.

96
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:39,503
I mean, crushed it like...

97
00:11:40,462 --> 00:11:44,175
Oh, my God, the sound

98
00:11:44,383 --> 00:11:46,135
it's still in my ears.

99
00:11:46,343 --> 00:11:49,054
You know, and the blood,
like, everywhere.

100
00:11:49,263 --> 00:11:54,518
Like, there was so much,
you would not believe.

101
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:59,690
Man, will you just please give me...?
Just give me my weed, all right?

102
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:02,359
It helps with my nausea.

103
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:05,946
So

104
00:12:06,614 --> 00:12:09,200
You did not kill anyone?

105
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,037
Does anybody think
that you killed anybody?

106
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:15,080
I called the cops.

107
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:17,541
You called the cops?

108
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,253
Yeah. You know, I called,
and I split, you know?

109
00:12:21,462 --> 00:12:23,547
And then they came in and busted her.

110
00:12:24,256 --> 00:12:28,219
God, she was...
She was so zapped out of her mind.

111
00:12:28,427 --> 00:12:31,805
You know? It's...
She did it for, like, nothing.

112
00:12:32,014 --> 00:12:35,518
I mean, he told her she was a skank,
but, yo, I mean, she was a skank.

113
00:12:35,726 --> 00:12:41,065
Can this person identify you?
Can she identify you being there?

114
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:45,986
She couldn't identify her left ass cheek.

115
00:12:46,195 --> 00:12:48,489
She was so zonked.

116
00:12:49,823 --> 00:12:52,076
And she had this...

117
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:54,370
God, she had this kid.

118
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,998
Listen, I'm a little fuzzy
on the mechanics here,

119
00:12:58,207 --> 00:13:03,170
but could you not stop this woman
from killing this man?

120
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:07,174
Look, she had a gun on me, all right?

121
00:13:13,848 --> 00:13:16,559
Yeah, my gun, okay? Mine.

122
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:18,602
Go ahead, say it. Say it.

123
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:22,815
No, I ain't no Tuco or Krazy-8.
I can't run a crew.

124
00:13:23,023 --> 00:13:26,735
Come on. Come on. Point made, man.
Point made. Yes.

125
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:36,245
<i>Yo. If I know you, leave a message.</i>

126
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:39,456
<i>- Hey, it's Badger, man.
- What are you doing?</i>

127
00:13:39,665 --> 00:13:43,460
<i>- Don't use your real name.
- What? That isn't my real name.</i>

128
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,713
<i>Okay.</i>

129
00:13:46,338 --> 00:13:51,260
<i>Yo, we got those pants you wanted.
Thirty-two large, right?</i>

130
00:13:51,468 --> 00:13:53,971
<i>We got them just for you, jefe.</i>

131
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,640
<i>Let's do some business, yo.</i>

132
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:07,151
So are you gonna
get back up on that horse?

133
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,488
No.

134
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:14,617
You get on. All right?

135
00:14:14,825 --> 00:14:17,786
I just want to forget. I just...

136
00:14:27,296 --> 00:14:28,631
Sorry.

137
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,728
Hey.

138
00:14:42,937 --> 00:14:45,147
Hey, what's up with that?

139
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,860
Jesus Malverde,
patron saint of Mexican drug dealers.

140
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:52,696
Well, yeah, hell, I know who it is, okay?

141
00:14:52,905 --> 00:14:55,491
Scumbags kneeling down praying to him:

142
00:14:55,699 --> 00:15:00,871
"Please, Señor Saint.
No DEA, please."

143
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:12,091
I'm just... I'm just saying,
why's he on your desk?

144
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,011
Going after neo-Nazis,
you don't wear swastikas, right?

145
00:15:18,848 --> 00:15:21,642
- Sun Tzu.
- Son who?

146
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:24,645
<i>Sixth-century Chinese general.
Wrote The Art of War.</i>

147
00:15:25,604 --> 00:15:27,565
"If you know your enemy as yourself

148
00:15:27,773 --> 00:15:30,317
you'll fight without danger
in many battles."

149
00:15:34,113 --> 00:15:35,739
Right on.

150
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,914
- Agent Schrader.
- Sir.

151
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,350
- Glad to have you on board.
- Thanks.

152
00:15:48,502 --> 00:15:52,381
- Everybody getting you settled in?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Great group of guys.

153
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,926
And gals. And gals.
Guys... Guys and gals.

154
00:15:56,135 --> 00:15:58,846
Good. You couldn't have
picked a better time to arrive.

155
00:15:59,054 --> 00:16:01,848
We're about to put a big dent
in the cartel. Right, Vanco?

156
00:16:01,932 --> 00:16:03,559
Yes, sir.

157
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:35,341
Yo, bro, check it out.
It's a satellite picture of you farting.

158
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:39,303
"Fat Man and Little Boy."
Sounds like you two.

159
00:16:39,512 --> 00:16:43,140
I got your fat man in my pants, bitch.

160
00:16:47,436 --> 00:16:50,481
- Hey, watch it.
- It ain't real, dumb-ass.

161
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:51,815
Just watch it, is all.

162
00:16:52,024 --> 00:16:53,817
You watch it.

163
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:05,663
I'm Heisenberg.

164
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,332
You're Heisenberg?

165
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:10,584
Yeah, I remember you.
You were the cook.

166
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:13,087
Let's get this over with.

167
00:17:13,295 --> 00:17:14,922
Where's Jesse?

168
00:17:15,673 --> 00:17:18,259
- Busy.
- Hey, that's cool.

169
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:19,885
Real cool.

170
00:17:20,094 --> 00:17:21,637
Totally cool.

171
00:17:21,846 --> 00:17:23,305
Hey, hey...

172
00:17:23,514 --> 00:17:28,060
It's all there, man. Every dollar.
Case you wanna, like, count it.

173
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:31,438
- Here?
- I'm just saying...

174
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,482
Just saying, like, we cool, yo.

175
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:35,941
Ain't got no confusions
and interpretations

176
00:17:36,026 --> 00:17:37,319
as to who we work for.

177
00:17:37,528 --> 00:17:40,739
And that's church, yo. For real.

178
00:17:45,703 --> 00:17:47,496
What have you heard?

179
00:17:49,707 --> 00:17:52,418
Did Jesse really...?

180
00:17:53,377 --> 00:17:56,088
I mean, did he really...

181
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:01,135
squash that dude's head
with an ATM machine?

182
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,678
Word.

183
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,185
Who's saying that?

184
00:18:09,393 --> 00:18:13,439
Damn, man, it's all over town.
Everybody's like, "Whoa, snap."

185
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:16,317
Usually I gotta chase dudes down
for their money,

186
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:18,277
but today everybody's paying up.

187
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:21,405
True that. Serious.

188
00:18:21,614 --> 00:18:23,490
But, like...

189
00:18:24,783 --> 00:18:26,368
He really did it?

190
00:18:36,253 --> 00:18:38,672
You didn't hear that from me.

191
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:08,483
Big lunch.

192
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:19,911
Thank you.

193
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,002
- Here you go.
- Very good, Ms. White.

194
00:19:28,211 --> 00:19:30,922
We'll consider your application
and let you know.

195
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,423
Thank you.

196
00:19:32,632 --> 00:19:35,677
I'd just like to mention
that I have worked here before.

197
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:37,011
Really?

198
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,097
When are you due?

199
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:44,310
- Several months.
- Congratulations.

200
00:19:44,644 --> 00:19:49,273
I see. Accounting Department.
You left us four years ago?

201
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:50,900
Family.

202
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:55,113
We'll definitely let you know.
Thank you for coming by.

203
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:04,789
Actually, may I see Ted Beneke?
I... I think he'll remember me.

204
00:20:04,998 --> 00:20:07,792
Mr. Beneke's very busy today,
unfortunately.

205
00:20:08,001 --> 00:20:10,294
You know, if it's okay, I'll just...

206
00:20:12,422 --> 00:20:13,965
Ma'am...

207
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:30,773
Skyler. Oh, my God, look at you.

208
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:32,483
Hey, Ted.

209
00:20:32,692 --> 00:20:34,986
- Come in, come in.
- Okay.

210
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:37,822
No calls, Margaret, thanks.

211
00:20:38,031 --> 00:20:39,532
Come on, sit down right here.

212
00:20:39,741 --> 00:20:41,993
Okay. Thank you.

213
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,833
- You look great.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

214
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,400
Boy or girl?
Or are you keeping it a secret?

215
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:53,838
Oh, it's a little girl.
We're very excited.

216
00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:56,799
I'll bet. One of each.

217
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,260
How's Walt Jr.?

218
00:20:59,469 --> 00:21:03,097
Oh, 10th grade,
and he's just growing like a weed.

219
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:05,006
He's... He's taller than I am now.

220
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:10,897
Yeah. I'm betting 6'3 ", 6'4"
by the time he's finished.

221
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:13,649
And, wow, handsome. Oh, my God.

222
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:15,443
Good genes.

223
00:21:19,072 --> 00:21:23,326
Speaking of movie stars,
those can't be the twins.

224
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:25,703
Oh, yeah. Yep. That's them.

225
00:21:25,912 --> 00:21:28,039
- They're gorgeous.
- Yes, they are.

226
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:30,875
And they know it.

227
00:21:31,084 --> 00:21:32,877
I'm in real trouble there, huh?

228
00:21:33,086 --> 00:21:34,754
Yeah.

229
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:39,092
So the big office, huh?

230
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,010
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

231
00:21:41,219 --> 00:21:43,179
Weird, isn't it?

232
00:21:43,388 --> 00:21:45,723
I still think of it as my dad's.

233
00:21:45,932 --> 00:21:47,266
I miss him.

234
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:49,018
Me too.

235
00:21:49,894 --> 00:21:55,066
I'd like to think he'd be proud.
Last year was our best year yet.

236
00:21:55,525 --> 00:21:57,402
Yeah, he'd be proud.

237
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,114
Walt? How's he doing?

238
00:22:01,322 --> 00:22:06,285
Oh, he's... He is doing great.
Yeah. He's plugging away.

239
00:22:06,494 --> 00:22:09,914
- Great. He's still teaching?
- Yeah.

240
00:22:10,123 --> 00:22:14,919
- You tell him I said hello.
- I will definitely do that.

241
00:22:19,007 --> 00:22:24,053
To be honest, Ted,
I didn't just stop by to say hello. I...

242
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:28,558
I was applying for the data-entry job.

243
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:31,602
You're kidding.

244
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:34,105
Skyler, you were, like,
our go-to bookkeeper.

245
00:22:34,313 --> 00:22:36,774
Yeah. Well

246
00:22:36,983 --> 00:22:39,444
the economy, you know, so...

247
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:43,197
Well, you, data entry?
That'd be a mistake.

248
00:22:47,118 --> 00:22:48,911
How about

249
00:22:50,496 --> 00:22:51,914
get your old job back?

250
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:57,962
We're expanding, and, well,
between you and me

251
00:22:58,171 --> 00:23:00,521
the whole department's
pretty much of a mess.

252
00:23:00,965 --> 00:23:03,384
Your work would be cut out for you,

253
00:23:04,344 --> 00:23:06,304
but we could use your help.

254
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:13,811
Okay.

255
00:23:16,064 --> 00:23:19,817
All right. Now, this is our territory,
right? Currently.

256
00:23:20,026 --> 00:23:21,319
Hey. Hello.

257
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:23,988
- Yeah, man. Current. Whatever.
- Now, look at this.

258
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:25,990
Here, here, here and here.

259
00:23:27,325 --> 00:23:29,285
What does that look like to you?

260
00:23:30,662 --> 00:23:33,915
Opportunities. Golden ones.
That's what that looks like.

261
00:23:34,874 --> 00:23:37,710
No, look.
Look, it's an entire city full of buyers.

262
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,671
Now, why aren't we exploiting that?

263
00:23:39,879 --> 00:23:43,341
- Because it's not our territory?
- Because we lack initiative.

264
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:44,842
- Initiative.
- Yes.

265
00:23:45,051 --> 00:23:47,011
You need to employ more dealers.

266
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,555
Double, triple your crew.
Those three I met?

267
00:23:49,764 --> 00:23:54,018
They should each have three, six, nine
sub-dealers working for them.

268
00:23:54,227 --> 00:23:56,270
Exponential growth, that's the key here.

269
00:23:56,479 --> 00:24:02,235
It's not our territory, man.
Yo, you follow me here, huh?

270
00:24:02,443 --> 00:24:05,113
We go rolling into these neighbourhoods

271
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:08,157
other crews ain't gonna take kindly,
you understand?

272
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:11,035
Sure, they won't like it,

273
00:24:11,244 --> 00:24:14,122
but I say they're not gonna
do a thing about it.

274
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,290
- No. Listen, Jesse...
- No.

275
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:18,126
Jesse.

276
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:25,341
The game has changed.
The word is out that you are a killer.

277
00:24:26,092 --> 00:24:29,345
- What are you talking about?
- Apparently, it's all over town.

278
00:24:29,554 --> 00:24:32,056
Somebody crossed you, you got angry

279
00:24:32,265 --> 00:24:35,351
you crushed their skull
with an ATM machine.

280
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,686
- That's not how it happened.
- Who cares

281
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:41,170
as long as it's our competitors
who believe it and not the police?

282
00:24:41,274 --> 00:24:44,569
- Oh, my...
- No, don't you see how great this is?

283
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:48,865
Look, you... You are a...

284
00:24:52,118 --> 00:24:53,870
Jesse, look at me.

285
00:24:54,537 --> 00:24:57,665
You are a blowfish.

286
00:24:57,874 --> 00:25:00,084
- What?
- A blowfish. Think about it.

287
00:25:00,293 --> 00:25:04,422
Small in stature, not swift, not cunning.

288
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,930
Easy prey for predators,

289
00:25:06,132 --> 00:25:08,426
but the blowfish has a secret weapon

290
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:10,970
doesn't he? Doesn't he?

291
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:15,099
What does the blowfish do, Jesse?
What does the blowfish do?

292
00:25:17,894 --> 00:25:20,062
- I don't even know...
- The blowfish puffs up.

293
00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:23,983
The blowfish puffs himself up
four, five times larger than normal.

294
00:25:24,192 --> 00:25:26,778
And why? Why does he do that?

295
00:25:26,986 --> 00:25:29,656
So that it makes him intimidating,
that's why.

296
00:25:29,864 --> 00:25:30,865
Intimidating.

297
00:25:31,074 --> 00:25:34,285
So that the other scarier fish
are scared off.

298
00:25:34,494 --> 00:25:37,246
And that's you. You are a blowfish.

299
00:25:37,455 --> 00:25:40,416
You see, it's just all an illusion.

300
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:43,628
You see, it's nothing but air.

301
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:46,631
Now

302
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:49,967
who messes with the blowfish, Jesse?

303
00:25:50,885 --> 00:25:53,596
- Nobody.
- You're damn right.

304
00:25:54,764 --> 00:25:57,850
- I'm a blowfish.
- You are a blowfish.

305
00:25:58,059 --> 00:25:59,659
- Say it again.
- I'm a blowfish.

306
00:25:59,769 --> 00:26:01,770
- Say it like you mean it.
- I'm a blowfish.

307
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:04,732
- You're a blowfish. That's right.
- Yeah!

308
00:26:04,941 --> 00:26:07,819
Blowfishing this up.

309
00:26:45,565 --> 00:26:46,858
Hello?

310
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:49,986
<i>The SkyMall.
Give me the SkyMall, would you?</i>

311
00:26:55,742 --> 00:26:57,160
Vanco

312
00:26:57,368 --> 00:27:00,913
new guy don't speak Spanish.
What's up?

313
00:27:01,998 --> 00:27:05,793
Hey, white boy,
better learn Español, huh?

314
00:27:06,002 --> 00:27:09,297
This ain't Branson, Missouri,
know what I'm talking about?

315
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:13,009
You know what? I'll teach you.

316
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:20,058
It means, "Let's make a deal."

317
00:27:20,266 --> 00:27:22,560
So go ahead. We're waiting.

318
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,855
Okay.

319
00:27:28,024 --> 00:27:29,400
Right here.

320
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:32,320
"Item SS4G:

321
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:37,075
Yankee Stadium final season
commemorative baseball

322
00:27:37,283 --> 00:27:39,077
hand-signed by Derek Jeter."

323
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:41,871
Vanco, write this down.

324
00:27:42,622 --> 00:27:44,457
Oh, man, watch out.

325
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:49,921
"66100ZBG: Large-size floor runner."

326
00:27:50,129 --> 00:27:53,341
Look at that, huh?
It's a rug you put on the floor

327
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:56,427
except for it looks like
a hundred-dollar bill.

328
00:27:56,636 --> 00:28:00,890
<i>I love them. Get me 20 of them.
I'm gonna put them all over my casa.</i>

329
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:02,266
We'll get you three.

330
00:28:02,475 --> 00:28:04,519
- No, you give me 10.
- Five.

331
00:28:06,604 --> 00:28:09,899
Hey. How about you stop
jerking us off here?

332
00:28:14,153 --> 00:28:17,240
Where's the meet?
When's it going down?

333
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,076
White boy don't like
let's make a deal, huh?

334
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,079
White boy's gonna kick your ass,
you don't stop wasting time.

335
00:28:24,163 --> 00:28:25,206
Schrader...

336
00:28:25,415 --> 00:28:31,879
Hey, white boy. My name's Tortuga.
You know what that means?

337
00:28:32,088 --> 00:28:36,551
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd say that's Spanish for "asshole."

338
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:41,347
Tortuga means "turtle." That's me.

339
00:28:44,392 --> 00:28:48,479
I take my time, but I always win.

340
00:28:52,025 --> 00:28:53,735
Oh, wait. That reminds me.

341
00:28:53,943 --> 00:28:56,446
I seen this earlier. Lookit.

342
00:28:57,363 --> 00:29:00,575
This is awesome, homes.
Right there, look at that.

343
00:29:00,783 --> 00:29:03,870
"The tranquil tortoise
garden sculpture."

344
00:29:04,078 --> 00:29:05,747
Definitely two of those, huh?

345
00:29:06,372 --> 00:29:09,500
Check it out, huh? Good likeness.

346
00:29:10,877 --> 00:29:13,379
Hank's doing great down there.
He's making inroads.

347
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:16,132
I'm sure he is. He's a hero, after all.

348
00:29:16,341 --> 00:29:19,427
So you gonna go down to El Paso?

349
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:22,096
Please. It's Third World enough
around here.

350
00:29:22,305 --> 00:29:23,905
They keep him busy every second.

351
00:29:24,098 --> 00:29:26,148
He's already got some
big operation going.

352
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:28,686
Some hush-hush deal
he couldn't tell me about

353
00:29:28,895 --> 00:29:31,230
except it's on the other side
of the border.

354
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:33,024
Wow, that sounds exciting.

355
00:29:33,775 --> 00:29:35,777
He's being safe, right?

356
00:29:35,985 --> 00:29:38,071
Yeah.
He says he's mostly riding a desk.

357
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:41,282
Which, between you and me,
is just the way I want it.

358
00:29:42,033 --> 00:29:44,869
Speaking of riding desks

359
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,038
got myself a job today.

360
00:29:48,873 --> 00:29:49,874
You did not.

361
00:29:52,627 --> 00:29:55,171
As big as you are?

362
00:29:56,756 --> 00:30:00,885
- Thank you.
- You know I just mean...

363
00:30:01,094 --> 00:30:02,720
Where? With who?

364
00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:06,641
Well, someone willing
to work around that, apparently.

365
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:07,850
Beneke.

366
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:11,729
You did not.
Is Mr. Grabby-Hands still there?

367
00:30:11,938 --> 00:30:14,188
Marie, that was one time
at a Christmas party.

368
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:19,237
And he was so drunk,
he was practically slurring his words.

369
00:30:19,445 --> 00:30:22,795
- Just what you want in an executive.
- And he apologised profusely.

370
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:26,577
Plus he's married with a family.
I'm sure he doesn't wanna get sued.

371
00:30:26,786 --> 00:30:29,497
It will not happen again.

372
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:34,043
Is money that tight?

373
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:38,589
Yeah.

374
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:41,801
You know we can always help out.

375
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:44,470
No, Marie.

376
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:46,437
You know Walt. He would just...

377
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:53,187
- Speak of the devil.
- Hey. Hi, Marie.

378
00:30:53,396 --> 00:30:55,106
How are you? What's up?

379
00:30:56,315 --> 00:30:58,067
Nothing much.
How's things with you?

380
00:30:58,568 --> 00:30:59,944
- Good. Good.
- Hi, honey.

381
00:31:00,153 --> 00:31:02,905
- Dinner will be about an hour and...
- Oh, thanks, sweetie.

382
00:31:02,989 --> 00:31:06,659
- Everything okay?
- Everything's perfect.

383
00:31:27,514 --> 00:31:31,601
This is Raisin Bran,
not Raisin Bran Crunch.

384
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,812
So? Same thing.

385
00:31:34,021 --> 00:31:35,564
Not the same thing.

386
00:31:35,772 --> 00:31:38,622
I'll tell you what, why don't you
do the grocery shopping?

387
00:31:39,026 --> 00:31:43,030
And then you can get
whatever you want. Great.

388
00:31:43,238 --> 00:31:48,327
It's... It's not that hard, Mom.
It says "crunch" on the box.

389
00:31:48,535 --> 00:31:49,745
You're pushing it.

390
00:31:49,953 --> 00:31:52,706
- Morning.
- Morning, honey.

391
00:31:52,914 --> 00:31:54,958
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

392
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:58,253
Dad, notice anything?

393
00:32:00,297 --> 00:32:01,923
Is there a funeral today?

394
00:32:02,132 --> 00:32:03,182
- A funeral?
- Well...

395
00:32:03,342 --> 00:32:05,593
- Oh, Christ, do I look that bad?
- No, no, no.

396
00:32:05,677 --> 00:32:07,763
Mom got a job.

397
00:32:07,971 --> 00:32:09,389
A job? Why?

398
00:32:09,598 --> 00:32:12,267
Well, do I need to get out
the chequebook and show you?

399
00:32:12,351 --> 00:32:15,479
No, I... Do you think it's a good idea
in your condition?

400
00:32:15,687 --> 00:32:18,523
No, no. The doctor said I can work
up until I go into labour.

401
00:32:18,607 --> 00:32:21,985
And it's just an office job.
I'm just sitting on my butt.

402
00:32:23,654 --> 00:32:24,863
Where?

403
00:32:25,864 --> 00:32:27,282
Beneke.

404
00:32:27,491 --> 00:32:30,077
I'm back working
in the Accounting Department.

405
00:32:30,285 --> 00:32:33,956
Skyler, what about the welding fumes?
Isn't that why you had to quit

406
00:32:34,164 --> 00:32:37,167
- in the first place?
- They've gone green since then.

407
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:41,046
They have some kind of
green welding or something.

408
00:32:41,254 --> 00:32:44,007
I didn't smell anything
when I was in there.

409
00:32:46,134 --> 00:32:48,095
Didn't Mr. Beneke pass away?

410
00:32:48,303 --> 00:32:49,429
Yeah.

411
00:32:49,638 --> 00:32:50,688
Who's running things?

412
00:32:50,889 --> 00:32:53,141
Ted. The son.

413
00:32:55,227 --> 00:32:58,689
Anyway, I have got to go.

414
00:32:58,897 --> 00:33:02,484
I don't wanna be late my first day back.

415
00:33:02,693 --> 00:33:04,444
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

416
00:33:04,653 --> 00:33:06,446
- Bye.
- Bye.

417
00:33:06,655 --> 00:33:08,073
Okay.

418
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:11,660
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

419
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:16,039
Bye.

420
00:33:27,926 --> 00:33:29,428
Hey.

421
00:33:31,013 --> 00:33:33,015
You left your cave.

422
00:33:33,515 --> 00:33:35,225
Yeah.

423
00:33:35,434 --> 00:33:38,061
I was... I'm missing my TV.

424
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,770
Thinking maybe I'd hit Costco.

425
00:33:39,855 --> 00:33:42,399
You know, snag a big-ass wide-screen.

426
00:33:43,317 --> 00:33:44,860
So...

427
00:33:45,277 --> 00:33:46,778
Yeah.

428
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,114
What you drawing?

429
00:33:52,034 --> 00:33:53,035
Damn.

430
00:33:53,243 --> 00:33:54,620
That's good.

431
00:33:54,828 --> 00:33:56,496
Make a hell of a tat.

432
00:33:56,705 --> 00:33:57,831
That's the plan.

433
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,207
Really?

434
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:02,252
I work part-time, down at ABQ Ink.

435
00:34:02,461 --> 00:34:03,545
Right on.

436
00:34:04,588 --> 00:34:08,258
Yo, you're a real good drawer.

437
00:34:08,842 --> 00:34:11,053
I used to do a little of that.

438
00:34:12,846 --> 00:34:15,641
You used to be a drawer too, huh?

439
00:34:18,602 --> 00:34:20,270
What stopped you?

440
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,609
You know, just...

441
00:34:25,817 --> 00:34:27,736
So tell me something.

442
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:32,324
What kind of tattoo artist
has no tattoos?

443
00:34:34,117 --> 00:34:36,453
That's way too big a commitment.

444
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,882
Hey, man. You're Pinkman.

445
00:34:51,134 --> 00:34:53,595
You're the man!
Everybody's been talking about you.

446
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,138
Yeah.

447
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:57,724
Right on, man. Keep it real.

448
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,358
"Pinkman," huh?

449
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:07,985
Yeah.

450
00:35:08,277 --> 00:35:10,445
I thought your name was "Jackson."

451
00:35:26,169 --> 00:35:28,839
Well, your snitch
is really earning his nickname.

452
00:35:29,256 --> 00:35:30,299
Are we...?

453
00:35:30,507 --> 00:35:32,009
Are we just on mañana time?

454
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:33,552
They'll show.

455
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,513
Yeah? Why is that?

456
00:35:36,763 --> 00:35:39,641
You got more catalogues
for him to clean out?

457
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:43,520
Maybe a little Sharper Image
or Pottery Barn?

458
00:36:08,795 --> 00:36:11,006
Hey, something I need to know about?

459
00:36:11,214 --> 00:36:13,592
What? Oh, that? No, man.

460
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,762
We were just singing your praises.

461
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,263
Glad to have you.

462
00:36:18,472 --> 00:36:20,223
Welcome aboard.

463
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:42,329
Hey, is that your guy?

464
00:36:43,872 --> 00:36:46,166
Hey, I think that's your guy.

465
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:49,586
What the hell is he doing down there?

466
00:37:56,612 --> 00:37:58,238
Schrader, where you going?

467
00:37:59,406 --> 00:38:03,160
We need an evidence bag, right?
A pretty big one.

468
00:38:05,078 --> 00:38:07,428
What's the matter?
You act like you never saw

469
00:38:07,539 --> 00:38:09,833
a severed human head
on a tortoise before.

470
00:38:21,303 --> 00:38:23,847
Hey, welcome to...

471
00:38:49,498 --> 00:38:50,999
My leg.

472
00:39:09,808 --> 00:39:13,854
<i>Headed by Werner Heisenberg,
were also undertaken during the war.</i>

473
00:39:14,063 --> 00:39:16,482
The game has changed, yo.

474
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:19,485
This is our city, all right?

475
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:22,237
All of it. The whole damn place.

476
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:24,490
Our territory.

477
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:26,492
We're staking our claim

478
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,454
that we sell when we want, where we want.

479
00:39:30,662 --> 00:39:33,415
Now, we're gonna be kings, understand?

480
00:39:33,624 --> 00:39:35,167
Well, I'm gonna be king.

481
00:39:35,376 --> 00:39:37,836
You guys will be princes
or dukes or something.

482
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:40,672
- I wanna be a knight.
- But first things first.

483
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:42,966
We gotta get more dealers.

484
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:45,677
You know, foot soldiers, right?

485
00:39:45,886 --> 00:39:47,679
Now, they'll be working for you.

486
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:50,974
You're working for me,
and they're working for you.

487
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,268
You follow me?

488
00:39:53,477 --> 00:39:55,270
Layered, like nachos.

489
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:57,189
Exponential growth.

490
00:39:57,398 --> 00:40:00,984
Now, that's success with a capital S.

491
00:40:01,193 --> 00:40:02,736
Straight up, straight up.

492
00:40:02,945 --> 00:40:03,946
For shizzle.

493
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:05,197
Frigging awesome.

494
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:18,752
Well, we're set.

495
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:22,464
Our boys are ready.
Gonna be some mad cheddar, yo.

496
00:40:23,424 --> 00:40:24,758
Cheddar, Mr. White.

497
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:29,179
Fat stacks, dead presidents, cash money.

498
00:40:30,806 --> 00:40:32,474
Gonna own this city.

499
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:34,727
We're not charging enough.

500
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:37,354
What?

501
00:40:38,147 --> 00:40:40,691
You corner the market,
then raise the price.

502
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:43,527
Simple economics.

503
00:41:04,048 --> 00:41:06,425
Oh, hey, Ted. Come on in.

504
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:09,553
- Looks like they got you all set up.
- Yeah. It's perfect.

505
00:41:09,762 --> 00:41:12,889
I am close enough to the bathroom
that I don't have to waddle far.

506
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:14,023
And that's very nice.

507
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:16,583
- I figured that might be a deal-breaker.
- Yeah.

508
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:19,355
Listen, I...

509
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:23,567
I wanted to thank you for having me back.

510
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:26,612
You don't have to thank me.
I need you.

511
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:33,952
Wow, Ted, it's a little early
for wine, isn't it?

512
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:35,788
Oh, damn. It's grape juice.

513
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:38,296
Been making the girls
breakfast in the morning.

514
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:39,958
Hey, how is Denise doing?

515
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:42,961
We split up, about a year ago.

516
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:46,465
I'm sorry.

517
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:50,135
She's definitely happier now.
I guess I am too, most days.

518
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:52,805
- Together since high school.
- Yeah.

519
00:41:53,013 --> 00:41:54,973
- I remember that.
- Anyway...

520
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,060
I don't know, people change.

521
00:41:58,352 --> 00:41:59,353
Yes.

522
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:02,147
Anyway, I just wanted to welcome you.

523
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:04,858
Welcome you back. And...

524
00:42:05,067 --> 00:42:07,569
I'll see you around the vending machines.

525
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,279
Okay.

526
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:14,368
We should have lunch one day.

527
00:42:14,576 --> 00:42:15,828
Like old times.

528
00:42:16,704 --> 00:42:18,163
Sure.

529
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:52,591
Oh, hey.

530
00:43:53,425 --> 00:43:55,135
Hey, yourself.

531
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,101
So listen. My...

532
00:44:02,643 --> 00:44:05,354
My name is not really Jesse Jackson.

533
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:10,192
It's Jesse Pinkman.

534
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:13,278
And that guy you met

535
00:44:13,612 --> 00:44:18,200
he's not my dad.

536
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:30,921
You're not gonna kick me out, are you?

537
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:33,966
Because I actually really like it here.

538
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:38,262
I don't make it my business what you do.

539
00:44:39,096 --> 00:44:41,390
So long as you don't do it here.

540
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:51,942
So, hey, I got this kick-ass
new flat-screen.

541
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:57,448
Wanna see?

542
00:45:24,725 --> 00:45:27,186
It's got that thing where the blacks

543
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:31,523
are, like, you know,
really, really, really black.

544
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:37,071
And the Dolby six-point-whatever.

545
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:41,408
So it'll really rock the house.

546
00:45:42,368 --> 00:45:44,078
But I'll, you know...

547
00:45:44,286 --> 00:45:49,541
I'll keep it way down, of course.

548
00:45:59,593 --> 00:46:02,721
I don't know what the hell
is taking so long.

549
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:08,894
Come on, come on.
