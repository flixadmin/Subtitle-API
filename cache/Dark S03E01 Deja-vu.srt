<i>If we knew</i>

3
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,625
<i>how things would end...</i>

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,160
<i>where our journey would take us...</i>

5
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:37,555
<i>would we still make the same decisions?</i>

6
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:43,015
<i>Or would we choose a different path?</i>

7
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:49,626
<i>Could we even escape our fate?</i>

8
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:58,664
<i>Or would what is deep within us</i>

9
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,998
<i>lead us to the same end,</i>

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,080
<i>like an invisible hand?</i>

11
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,164
<i>Does it matter which path we choose</i>

12
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:15,636
<i>if we end up</i>

13
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:19,008
<i>facing ourselves again and again?</i>

14
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,956
Wait. Martha, that's not possible, I...

15
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,368
- I don't understand.
- We don't have time.

16
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:40,383
What time are you from?

17
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,280
The question isn't from what time,

18
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,703
but from what world.

19
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,891
How did we get here?

20
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,988
I asked how we got here!

21
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,321
You're not Martha.

22
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,675
Who are you?

23
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,870
Today's the day it all began.

24
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,448
The day we first met.

25
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,901
What's that supposed to mean?

26
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,625
That you and I...

27
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,965
your world and my world...

28
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:49,576
form a knot that is
inextricably intertwined.

29
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,355
Your world?

30
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,685
What do you mean, your world?

31
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,956
I'll make it right.

32
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,418
- I promise.
- Wait! Where are you going?

33
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,650
Why am I here?

34

4 NOVEMBER 2019

35
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,914
Mikkel, put that away.

36
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,956
- Morning.
- No wonder you can't sleep at night.

37
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,350
What's up with him?

38
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,648
The same nightmare he always has.

39
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,623
Mikkel, that's enough.

40
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,645
Maybe it wasn't a dream.

41
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:29,664
But the here and now is one.
And none of us are real.

42
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:31,466
Ever thought about that?

43
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,443
Ha-ha! Very funny.

44
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,745
Oh, the damn electricity!

45
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:43,388
Pass the butter.

46
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:47,205
Come on, Mikkel. Go get ready now.

47
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,326
The bowl!

48
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,296
Is Magnus up yet?

49
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,498
- Martha, is Magnus up yet?
- No idea.

50
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,414
- Are you nuts?
- I just wanted to see if you were real.

51
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,826
Magnus!

52
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:09,873
Magnus!

53
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,285
You're going to be late!

54
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:14,791
Hello!

55
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,676
Magnus, either you get
down here or I'm coming up!

56
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,080
I'll be down in a sec.

57
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,498
- Arsehole!
- Race you to school. Morning, Mum.

58
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,930
- Idiot.
- Morning.

59
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,235
Shall I give you a ride?

60
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,706
It's supposed to rain later.

61
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,498
No, I'll be home late
today. Play rehearsal.

62
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,290
Don't forget, starting tomorrow
you guys are at your father's place.

63
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,700
Man, Mum, that sucks.

64
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,143
Good morning, sleepy head.

65
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,881
I was awake half the night again.

66
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,039
Why did it take so long?

67
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:58,748
First day back at school.
Long line at the baker's.

68
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,460
The apocalypse is coming.

69
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,658
Stay awhile.

70
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,405
I'm running late.

71
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,998
I'll see you this evening, okay?

72
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Ulrich?

73
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,083
I love you.

74
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,431

78
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,956
Welcome back to hell.

79
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,688
Just because you're too pea-brained

80
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,956
to see education is the
only way out of this dump

81
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,623
doesn't mean we all share
your retarded opinion.

82
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,998
- Don't forget to breathe.
- Don't forget to think.

83
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,290
- Hey.
- Hey.

84
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,039
- Have you seen Kilian?
- Nope.

85
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,748
Why all the effort?

86
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,914
We all die in the end.

87
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:58,456
Are you sure you're not adopted?

88
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,809
Are you sure you don't
have a stick up your arse

89
00:15:00,811 --> 00:15:02,581
that needs surgical removal?

90
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,289
- Dumbarse!
- Dumbarse yourself!

91
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,331
- Hey, Martha.
- Kilian.

92
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,218
Is there any news about Erik?

93
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:13,916
No.

94
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,461
It's all pretty creepy.

It'll be about your brother.

98
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,748
It's been two weeks already.
He's never been away this long.

99
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,164
He'd always send me a message

100
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:33,789
whenever he couldn't
stand it at home anymore.

101
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,921
But this time, nothing.

102

<i>Erik Obendorf has been
missing since 22 October.</i>

127
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,373
That's almost two weeks
now. No traces, no witnesses.

128
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,999
Questioning the neighbours

129
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:49,075
didn't bring any new
evidence to light either.

130
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,808
So, do you have any ideas?

131
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,916
We still haven't got the shift
schedules from the nuclear power plant.

132
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,581
All right, then follow up
on that. Go see Tiedemann.

133
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,498
- Wöller, look into the tyre treads.
- Yes.

134
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,748
- Jankowski, talk to the Obendorfs again.
- Okay.

135
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,600
Maybe he just took off.

136
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,485
It wouldn't be the first time.

137
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,963
<i>Well, a black hole...</i>

138
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:30,164
<i>forms when a central region
collapses in upon itself.</i>

139
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,914
And it contains neutrons.

140
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:32,931
WORMHOLE

141
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:35,206
Well, more like neutron matter.

142
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,164
But not enough of it.

143
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,956
So when the light of a star three
times the mass of the sun goes out,

144
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,873
then it explodes.

145
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,706
No, it implodes.

146
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,331
And that is a black hole.

147
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,533
And...

148
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,590
Can I help you?

149
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,814
Hello?

150
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,316
Are you new?

151
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,416
I'm Jonas.

152
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,425
Are you sure this is your class?

153
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,666
I wasn't notified of any new students.

154
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,630
A signature was missing.

155
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,251
Okay.

156
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,289
Bartosz, please continue.

157
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,291
Mm-hm.

158
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,914
So then we have a black hole.

159
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,289
And it has a huge gravitational pull.

160
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:38,415
Everything flying around the hole

161
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:40,881
is drawn to it and
somehow dragged inside.

162
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,291
Other stars, planets, and even light.

163
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:48,462
The gravitational force is so strong,

164
00:21:48,464 --> 00:21:50,376
that even light is pulled into it.

165
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,423
Nothing can escape once it's inside.

166
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:58,289
Basically, no one
knows what's behind it.

167
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:01,789
Maybe nothing. Or maybe a new world.

168
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,831
A world in which nothing
is as it is in ours.

169
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:11,706
All I'm asking is to review
your employees' shift schedules.

170
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,956
Erik was last seen on the forest road.

171
00:22:15,958 --> 00:22:17,498
The schedules

172
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,290
will allow us to check employee
vehicles with the tyre treads we found.

173
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,018
Do you have a court order?

174
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,475
This is a request.

175
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,481
Not an order.

176
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,188
I'll have someone search them out.

177
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,625
How are you?

178
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:54,991
Holding up.

179
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:58,783
Okay, then.

180
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,648
I was wondering...

181
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:12,165
do you think Erik could have
made his way onto the grounds?

182
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:16,581
The caves are partly located
under the nuclear power plant.

183
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,123
That's impossible.

184
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,746
The access points were
sealed up years ago.

185
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:25,611
No one can get in that way.

186
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:29,906
Okay, then.

187
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:44,456
<i>A quick reminder that
all afternoon activities</i>

188
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:47,789
<i>after four o'clock are cancelled
due to the parents' meeting.</i>

189
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:50,123
<i>Except theatre, which
will go on as planned</i>

190
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,539
<i>but vacate the auditorium
an hour earlier.</i>

191
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,623
<i>The school newspaper will
meet in the youth café today</i>

192
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,495
<i>under the supervision of Mr. Hopf.</i>

193
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:10,916
Katharina.

194
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,560
What are you doing here?

195
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,226
- I wanted to see you.
- Uh-huh.

196
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,835
I don't know...

197
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:32,591
I know you and Ulrich...

198
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:35,846
Ulrich and the kids...
I know they're part of him.

199
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:40,611
And I want you to know I
won't stand in the way of that.

200
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:44,495
That's very generous of you.

201
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,595
Did Ulrich stop at
your place this morning?

202
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,320
He wanted to bring something by.

203
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,039
Bring what by?

204
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,531
I don't know.

205
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:05,576
Something for school. For the kids.

206
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:12,541
No.

207
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,871
Then maybe he forgot.

208
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:45,331
Please don't forget to turn in
your presentations next week.

209
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:46,873
No exceptions!

210
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:57,358
Something up?

211
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,615
You didn't tell me why I'm here.

212
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,920
Do we know each other?

213
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,443
You have no idea who I am.

214
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:15,116
You coming?

215
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:34,326
ARIADNE
A PLAY

216
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:38,166
Jonas, right?

217
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,930
Everything okay?

218
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:46,933
What day is it today?

219
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,281
4 November.

220
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,450
What year?

221
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:55,498
2019.

222
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,150
I don't understand...

223
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:16,833
Mum?

224
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:18,916
Pardon?

225
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:23,656
Are you okay?

226
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:28,595
Can I help you?

227
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:51,648
POLICE

228
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,033
Charlotte?

229
00:28:23,916 --> 00:28:25,756
We have to stop this.

230
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,643
That's not what you
were saying this morning.

231
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:38,533
Ulrich, not here.

232
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:43,456
Oh... I'm sorry.

233
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:44,658
What is it?

234
00:28:46,541 --> 00:28:48,664
Um... the...

235
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:50,164
the tyre treads.

236
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:52,623
47 cars and 2 trucks.

237
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:55,539
In Winden alone there are
21,000 registered vehicles.

238
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:58,289
Yes. What do you want
me to do with that?

239
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:59,491
I...

240
00:29:00,483 --> 00:29:01,498
No idea.

241
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,380
I got the power plant shift
schedules. We can run a check.

242
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,325
Wöller.

243
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,873
<i>From then on, I knew
that nothing changes.</i>

244
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:24,998
<i>That all things remain.</i>

245
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,331
The spinning wheel turns.

246
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,713
Round and round, in a circle.

247
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:33,039
One fate tied to the next.

248
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,839
A thread,

249
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,748
red like blood,

250
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,280
that connects all our deeds.

251
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,706
One cannot unravel the knots.

252
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:44,708
But they can be severed.

253
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:47,456
He severed ours

254
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:49,288
with the sharpest blade.

255
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:54,706
And yet, something remains
behind that cannot be severed.

256
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:56,478
An invisible bond.

257
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,831
On many a night, he tugs at it.

258
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:05,831
And then I wake with a start,
knowing that nothing ceases to be.

259
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:07,433
That all remains.

260
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:16,168
And because their eyes
and hearts were blind,

261
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:20,456
they were punished for
their sins. Here and now.

262
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:22,498
And what flew plummeted to Earth.

263
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,956
And what was on Earth changed its shape.

264
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:27,123
Revealed its grotesque face,

265
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,035
which was nothing but
blasphemy made flesh.

266
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:38,914
Great. We'll stop here.

267
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:41,581
Unfortunately, we have
to finish early today.

268
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:45,543
Please put everything away for the
parents' meeting tonight. Thanks.

269
00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:51,278
9 o'clock tonight by
the bridge. Don't forget.

270
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:03,581
Martha.

271
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:08,290
I have no idea
what you want from me,

272
00:31:08,292 --> 00:31:10,321
but I want nothing from you, okay?

273
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,090
So get lost.

274
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:17,998
Please listen to me. Maybe
you don't know who I am.

275
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,750
- But today is 4 November and Mikkel...
- What? Mikkel?

276
00:31:23,625 --> 00:31:26,289
Michael Kahnwald, Hannah's
husband. He's not who you think...

277
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:28,461
Hannah's husband? Are you joking?

278
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:33,155
I don't know any Michael Kahnwald.

279
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,430
Hannah's husband is my
dad and his name is Ulrich.

280
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:40,871
I don't know what your deal is,
but just fuck off already, okay?

281
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:56,961
Wait. Not so fast.

282
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:52,248
I...

283
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,860
love you.

284
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,930
I love you.

285
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:18,916
It will happen again.

286
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,958
It will...

287
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,381
happen again.

288
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:27,376
It will happen again.

289
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,789
Mum?

290
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:32,831
Dad?

291
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:34,673
It will happen again.

292
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:37,038
It will...

293
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,428
happen again.

294
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,670
Tick, tock.

295
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,373
Tick, tock.

296
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,081
- Grandpa, is everything okay?
- Tick, tock.

297
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,293
Tick, tock.

298
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:55,081
The beginning is the end.

299
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:57,753
And the end is the beginning.

300
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:06,541
Tick, tock.

301
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,580
Tick, tock.

302
00:35:28,708 --> 00:35:32,328
TIEDEMANN, REGINA
1.8.1971 - 2.9.2019

303
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:38,565
Can I help you?

304
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:53,563
Are you looking for
something in particular?

305
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:57,418
I wanted to know if
someone was buried here.

306
00:35:58,208 --> 00:35:59,208
Who?

307
00:36:02,541 --> 00:36:03,831
Kahnwald,

308
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:06,283
Michael Kahnwald.

309
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,325
No, we have a Daniel Kahnwald,
died in '64,

310
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:13,661
but no Michael Kahnwald.

311
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:19,468
Maybe that's why I'm here.

312
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:24,498
So that it doesn't happen.

313
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:27,045
What happens?

314
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:30,031
Do I know you?

315
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:34,628
I feel like I've seen you
somewhere before.

316
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:46,666
Hey, wait!

317
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,491
What's your name?

318
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:20,286
21 SEPTEMBER 1987

319
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:36,583
Hello?

320
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:49,168
Can I help you? You must be lost.

321
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,308
The master key.

322
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:06,998
For the nuclear power plant.

323
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,600
Is this a joke?

324
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:10,773
You kept it.

325
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,228
Do you think this is funny?

326
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:35,423
If you don't leave,
I'll call the police.

327
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:00,366
<i>Police...</i>

328
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:17,151
What do you want from me?

329
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:30,243
Nothing is in vain.

330
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:33,333
No breath.

331
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,750
No step.

332
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,275
No word.

333
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,250
No pain.

334
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:46,790
An everlasting miracle...

335
00:39:47,625 --> 00:39:49,206
of the One.

336
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:51,268
Who the hell are you?

337
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:43,238
The police were here today.

338
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:46,113
You know what you've got to do.

339
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:02,956
Kilian?

340
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:08,363
Stop screwing around, okay?

341
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:22,775
What is this?

342
00:42:25,666 --> 00:42:27,623
What do you want here?

343
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:29,625
I don't want to scare you.

344
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:34,248
- Why did you say we know each other?
- We do know each other.

345
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,300
Not now, but in another time.

346
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:41,031
What does that mean?

347
00:42:56,916 --> 00:42:58,926
You've seen all this before.

348
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:00,973
The light.

349
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,300
The forest. Me.

350
00:43:08,416 --> 00:43:09,846
It's déjà vu.

351
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:13,135
Or a glitch in the matrix.

352
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,558
What?

353
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:21,855
I think I know why I'm here now.

354
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:24,698
Why you came to get me.

355
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:27,385
So that I change it.

356
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,470
Change what?

357
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:39,608
Who is he?

358
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,373
- Where's Mikkel?
- Mikkel?

359
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:45,331
Mikkel isn't with you?

360
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:47,003
Are you blind or what?

361
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:51,525
What's he doing here?

362
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:54,393
Did you bring him along?

363
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:56,691
What is this?

364
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:00,873
- How do you know my brother?
- This can't be.

365
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:04,206
You took him with you.
Heide, the babysitter, is sick.

366
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:07,078
And he didn't want to stay
home alone, so he came along.

367
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,956
No idea what the fuck this is,

368
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:14,588
but Mikkel is old enough
to look after himself.

369
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:16,871
Now, you'd better fuck off.

370
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:19,295
Get lost, freak.

371
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:26,458
Come on.

372
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,833
Martha.

373
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,720
POLICE

374
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:56,331
Charlotte? I'm going
to the parents' meeting.

375
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:58,503
I can give you a ride if you like.

376
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:01,908
All right.

377
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,530
- Will you carry on with this?
- Mm-mm.

378
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:57,183
Why did he act like he knew you?

379
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:02,164
- Do you know him?
- No.

380
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:03,366
Who knows.

381
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:10,748
Did you know Nostradamus predicted
the world would end this year?

382
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,380
What a load of crap.

383
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,373
No. Really.

384
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:17,775
The apocalypse is
practically around the corner.

385
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,990
Glad I got myself a girlfriend
with her own bunker.

386
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:23,273
What?

387
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:25,081
Nothing.

388
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,098
Ow!

389
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,340
What?

390
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:09,123
And you think you'll
find something here?

391
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:11,535
Erik sometimes spent
nights here in summer.

392
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:16,915
Maybe the police overlooked something.

393
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,873
Have you heard the story
of the cave monster?

394
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:24,705
- Spare us the bullshit, man.
- It's not bullshit.

395
00:47:25,791 --> 00:47:27,289
Some 100 years ago,

396
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:30,581
just after World War I, they
did experiments in there.

397
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:32,383
What kind of experiments?

398
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,530
- What was that?
- What?

399
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,731
Shit.

400
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:46,373
What's in the cave?

401
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:48,206
- What is it?
- Oh, shit!

402
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:49,873
- Fuck!
- What is that?

403
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:51,581
- Fuck! What's going on?
- Go! Run!

404
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:53,498
- What's with the flashlights?
- Go!

405
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,706
- Out of here! Out of here!
- Martha!

406
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:57,248
- Martha, come on.
- Out of here!

407
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,480
Run! Run!

408
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:16,041
Kilian?

409
00:48:21,458 --> 00:48:22,538
Kilian?

410
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:29,415
Martha.

411
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:30,576
- Is it over?
- I think so.

412
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:36,623
What...

413
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:38,265
What... what is that?

414
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:40,790
Oh, God!

415
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:45,463
Fuck!

416
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,250
Shit!

417
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:50,331
Oh, shit. Shit!

418
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:51,583
Fuck.

419
00:51:56,791 --> 00:51:58,998
- Is he dead?
- Fuck.

420
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,956
Yes, I think so.

421
00:52:00,958 --> 00:52:03,378
Who... who is that?

422
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,670
STUDENT CARD
MADS NIELSEN, 4 DECEMBER 1973

423
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:15,678
Mads Nielsen.

424
00:52:53,916 --> 00:52:56,586
I've waited for this moment
for so long.

425
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,881
For you to come back.

426
00:53:04,083 --> 00:53:05,513
Who are you?

427
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:17,791
Mikkel.

428
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,810
He didn't travel back.

429
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:23,748
He won't become your father.

430
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,373
And you...

431
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,765
will never be born in this world.

432
00:53:28,666 --> 00:53:31,316
A world without you.

433
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:35,315
Isn't that what you wanted?

434
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:40,076
Yet, despite that,

435
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:44,415
this world is doomed
to the same fate as yours.

436
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:48,426
Everything will fall apart.

437
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:51,575
In this world, just as it will in yours.

438
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:54,748
Again.

439
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,150
And again.

440
00:53:57,708 --> 00:53:59,288
Because of you.

441
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:08,505
And because of me.

442
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Martha.

443
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:50,003
21 SEPTEMBER 1888

444
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:28,083
Jonas?

445
00:56:16,458 --> 00:56:17,978
You're alive.

446
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:23,825
You're alive!

447
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,315
I'm not Martha.

448
00:56:44,416 --> 00:56:46,046
Not your Martha.

449
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,550
What does that mean?

450
00:57:01,041 --> 00:57:03,461
I'm here to help you find the origin.

451
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,630
The one thing...

452
00:57:08,583 --> 00:57:11,073
that's the beginning of everything.

453
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:13,858
In your world...

454
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,880
and in mine.
