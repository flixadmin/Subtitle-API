1
00:01:45,752 --> 00:01:47,419
Watch where you're going!

2
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:02,075
Hey.

3
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:03,591
Hey.

4
00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:08,514
What's up?

5
00:02:09,052 --> 00:02:10,052
Neh...

6
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:11,498
Not much.

7
00:02:22,265 --> 00:02:23,983
Is Mahdi still mad at me?

8
00:02:25,155 --> 00:02:26,429
No one's mad at you, man.

9
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:29,671
You sure?

10
00:02:29,936 --> 00:02:30,936
Yeah.

11
00:02:37,796 --> 00:02:39,108
We're just worried, man.

12
00:02:40,484 --> 00:02:42,179
We don't really get what your thing is.

13
00:02:42,515 --> 00:02:43,211
My thing?

14
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:44,429
Yeah!

15
00:02:44,492 --> 00:02:45,492
You've been...

16
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:47,070
Acting so strange.

17
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,479
Oh, yeah.

18
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,940
Yeah.

19
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:53,261
I'm sorry about that. It's just...
A lot is happening right now.

20
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:55,417
Lately.
Family and stuff as well.

21
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,876
And I can't sleep, so...

22
00:02:58,142 --> 00:03:00,908
I lose my temper like, so damn quickly.

23
00:03:01,623 --> 00:03:03,029
But I'm sorry about that.

24
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:07,521
Okay...

25
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:11,139
But... Let me know,

26
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,026
If you want to talk about it.

27
00:03:27,743 --> 00:03:30,143
I don't know, but there's...

28
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:35,392
That's what I'm thinking as well. That...

29
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:38,264
Yeah.

30
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:43,412
When you're in love...

31
00:03:44,343 --> 00:03:48,233
You think love is just like in the movies.

32
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:50,046
But...

33
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,585
That's not how it works.

34
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:54,726
I...

35
00:03:54,753 --> 00:04:01,588
I mean, I seriously thought William and
I would be together forever.

36
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,732
It ends where it ends, you know...

37
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:10,685
No one lives happily ever after.

38
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:13,889
You know, because in...

39
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,490
Real life...

40
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:17,924
Like, in the end...

41
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:25,682
No one's willing to sacrifice anything
for love in 2016.

42
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:30,980
Did I wake you?

43
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:34,027
What are you doing here?

44
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,019
No, just... Uh, Eskild
brought a guy home.

45
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:39,073
So, I just moved here.

46
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:42,706
The walls are pretty thin in the
living room, to put it that way.

47
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:45,456
Yeah, well the walls aren't so fucking
thick here either, though?!

48
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:46,838
I, I need to sleep!

49
00:04:46,863 --> 00:04:49,926
And I can't sleep when you lie here and...
talk a lot of shit!

50
00:04:50,026 --> 00:04:51,979
It's 2 AM! Have some respect!

51
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:53,526
Okay...?

52
00:04:57,144 --> 00:04:58,644
Yeah. I'm sorry, but...

53
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:00,832
I have to sleep!

54
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:04,605
Yeah, I get that.

55
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:06,566
I...

56
00:05:08,026 --> 00:05:11,175
Of course, I can...
I can talk to Eva tomorrow.

57
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,104
Yeah...

58
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,370
Say hi, though.

59
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:17,151
I'll do that.

60
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:26,479
And...

61
00:05:27,448 --> 00:05:28,651
William is an...

62
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:32,495
an idiot if he gives up on
the two of you.

63
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,104
Good night, Isak.

64
00:05:36,635 --> 00:05:37,932
G'night, Noora.

65
00:05:44,623 --> 00:05:45,732
That'll be 22.

66
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:47,412
Thank you.

67
00:05:48,784 --> 00:05:51,268
Thanks a lot. Bye!

68
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,504
Do you have more cheese sandwiches?

69
00:05:55,557 --> 00:05:56,753
I can heat one up.

70
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,644
Can you heat one up for me as well?

71
00:05:58,824 --> 00:05:59,824
Yes!

72
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:06,340
That'll be 25.

73
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:20,909
Uh, I think there's one crown missing.

74
00:06:31,638 --> 00:06:32,739
There you go.

75
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:34,317
Thank you.

76
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:00,056
Thank you.

77
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:08,672
Hey.

78
00:07:09,172 --> 00:07:10,172
Hey.

79
00:07:15,932 --> 00:07:18,143
No... cardamom?

80
00:07:26,057 --> 00:07:27,151
Cardamom.

81
00:07:31,768 --> 00:07:32,768
No, so...

82
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:40,091
- But, uh...
- I think I gotta go.

83
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:49,129
The urine just kept
running out of her?

84
00:07:49,154 --> 00:07:50,715
Yeah.
It was just running out, you know.

85
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,208
She had started working out,
and so it just kept running down

86
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:55,848
her pants, and into her shoes.
She was very upset, though.

87
00:07:56,114 --> 00:07:57,520
I see. But, uh...

88
00:07:57,737 --> 00:08:00,393
I mean, it does get very loose
if you don't squeeze at all.

89
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:02,346
Didn't she squeeze at all, then, or?

90
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,924
You know what, I asked
if she had taken that test.

91
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:06,885
I mean, I said
"Have you put your finger inside?"

92
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,955
And then squeeze real good.

93
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,346
And you know what she said then?
She didn't feel a thing...!

94
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:11,979
No...

95
00:08:12,104 --> 00:08:13,917
Isak Valtersen.

96
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:17,409
She was almost on her way
over to Aleris.

97
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:19,611
You know, start having surgery and such.

98
00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:21,878
Yes.

99
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,397
Just have a seat.

100
00:08:25,843 --> 00:08:26,843
Thanks.

101
00:08:33,315 --> 00:08:35,447
You're...
You're the school doctor?

102
00:08:36,346 --> 00:08:40,104
Yeah, I mean, not exactly a doctor.
Yeah, kinda.

103
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:42,948
It said... It said doctor on...

104
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:45,972
Mhm. Well, that sign is from 1962.

105
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:47,441
What can I do for you?

106
00:08:52,026 --> 00:08:54,222
I'm having trouble sleeping lately.

107
00:08:57,293 --> 00:09:00,332
Yeah, I've had a lot of
trouble sleeping lately.

108
00:09:00,357 --> 00:09:02,120
And it's starting to affect
school and stuff.

109
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:04,847
That's shitty.

110
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:06,966
Yeah.

111
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,309
So, I was wondering if I could
get some pills or something.

112
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:13,919
Because, yeah...

113
00:09:14,557 --> 00:09:17,424
Even though, even though
my problem isn't the worst...

114
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:20,862
Sleep deprivation is very serious.

115
00:09:22,151 --> 00:09:26,378
You have to think about how many
accidents could've been prevented

116
00:09:26,403 --> 00:09:29,135
If people hadn't fallen asleep
behind the wheel, for example.

117
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,553
I don't... I don't drive a car, though.

118
00:09:33,803 --> 00:09:36,287
No. But you're moving around in traffic...

119
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,826
Yeah.

120
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,717
And that's one inattentive moment, and then

121
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:44,450
'Bam!', you slam into a
semi truck, break your

122
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:46,941
neck, and get paralyzed
from the neck down.

123
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:48,706
You'll go straight into a wheelchair.

124
00:09:48,731 --> 00:09:51,057
It happened to a friend of mine,
she's still in that chair.

125
00:09:51,284 --> 00:09:52,284
Isak.

126
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:56,081
For how long have you had trouble sleeping?

127
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:00,057
It's been a while, really.

128
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:02,620
But it's been worse over
the past couple of weeks.

129
00:10:03,073 --> 00:10:04,073
Like...

130
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:06,620
Last night I slept for maybe...

131
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:09,208
One hour.

132
00:10:09,895 --> 00:10:10,895
Yeah.

133
00:10:11,052 --> 00:10:14,395
We'll refer you to BUP then.
(= Child and youth psychiatric polyclinic)

134
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,067
What does that mean?

135
00:10:17,135 --> 00:10:20,674
It means that you'll
get to talk to someone

136
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:23,448
who can help sort out some of
the thoughts in your head.

137
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,245
No. I'm not doing any of that.

138
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:27,409
No.

139
00:10:28,112 --> 00:10:29,253
No, it's not like that...

140
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:33,135
No. I'm not going to do that. Then...

141
00:10:33,244 --> 00:10:35,526
I'm completely serious, I'm not
doing something like that.

142
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,980
Isak.

143
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:44,691
Do you like other people?

144
00:10:47,903 --> 00:10:49,153
Sure, yeah?

145
00:10:50,395 --> 00:10:50,841
Mhm.

146
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,966
Because you see...

147
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:57,293
Every person is an island. ("Kvart mennske
er ei øy", a poem by Tarjei Vesaas)

148
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,416
And the only bridge across to others

149
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:01,862
Is through words.

150
00:11:02,846 --> 00:11:04,901
And as long as we don't talk to each other

151
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:07,572
We end up becoming lonely little islands

152
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:10,948
That are high on pills. Just like Ibiza,
do you get what I'm saying?

153
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:13,221
No.

154
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:14,307
No...

155
00:11:14,495 --> 00:11:18,346
I understand that, because I mixed
in a poem by Inger Hagrup

156
00:11:18,371 --> 00:11:20,236
So it didn't make total sense

157
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:21,542
But the point is

158
00:11:22,674 --> 00:11:24,518
That you can't keep isolating yourself.

159
00:11:25,222 --> 00:11:27,066
Everything is harder on your own.

160
00:11:28,176 --> 00:11:29,176
Hey.

161
00:11:31,183 --> 00:11:33,152
Don't you have someone you can talk to?

162
00:12:04,772 --> 00:12:05,382
Hey.

163
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:06,741
Hey.

164
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:12,046
Do you have any plans for tonight, or...?

165
00:12:12,977 --> 00:12:15,422
Nah, I don't really know.
I was just thinking I'd...

166
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,219
Go home and watch a movie or something.

167
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay.

168
00:12:19,492 --> 00:12:20,750
What are you doing now, though?

169
00:12:20,963 --> 00:12:22,487
Now...

170
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:25,416
Now I was just thinking of going home.
What about you?

171
00:12:29,003 --> 00:12:31,073
Will you join me for a Kebab?

172
00:12:31,347 --> 00:12:32,347
I've got money.

173
00:12:32,511 --> 00:12:33,511
Yeah.

174
00:12:34,277 --> 00:12:35,347
Yeah, sure.

175
00:12:35,448 --> 00:12:36,839
Who would say no to Kebab.

176
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:39,745
No one.

177
00:12:53,682 --> 00:12:56,034
- Can you hold...
- Yeah!

178
00:12:58,408 --> 00:13:00,533
Where should we...
Where should we go?

179
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,792
Over there.

180
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:02,987
Not over there?

181
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:05,674
No, not over there, because...

182
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,479
Dressed. And he was like...

183
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:12,370
Wearing a shirt and everything.

184
00:13:12,588 --> 00:13:14,908
And I saw that he was flirting with a girl

185
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:16,393
And I thought like, "Alright."

186
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:17,667
And then...

187
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:22,268
And I saw that he was standing with
that girl, then he leaned forward

188
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:24,268
And then he started vomiting...

189
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:25,838
Like crazy.

190
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:29,135
On, like, on her feet.

191
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,745
And he just kept vomiting.

192
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,018
And then he stopped for a few seconds.

193
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:37,042
And then she had time to start
yelling, like, "What the fuck?!"

194
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:38,792
And then he started vomiting even more.

195
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,510
It came out like a pressure washer,
and it was absolutely awful.

196
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,409
I was laughing so much!

197
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,096
The ones who vomit are always
the ones you'd least expect.

198
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,331
Yeah!

199
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,167
And... Yeah, I felt really bad for him.

200
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:52,401
Yeah.

201
00:14:13,707 --> 00:14:15,121
You know...

202
00:14:16,386 --> 00:14:18,753
You know that thing about me
being a little weird lately...?

203
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:20,293
Mhm?

204
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:30,673
It's...

205
00:14:31,088 --> 00:14:32,893
It's because of a person I like.

206
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:37,440
That, uh... Emma?

207
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:41,206
No, not Emma.

208
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:45,128
Take a guess.

209
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:46,307
A guess?

210
00:14:47,057 --> 00:14:48,362
I can't guess...

211
00:14:52,105 --> 00:14:53,105
Try.

212
00:14:58,863 --> 00:14:59,965
Is it Vilde?

213
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:01,879
Vilde?!

214
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,222
Who do you think I am?! Vilde?!

215
00:15:04,247 --> 00:15:05,652
Yeah, I don't fucking know! What...

216
00:15:05,677 --> 00:15:06,379
No...

217
00:15:06,543 --> 00:15:07,840
Can't you just tell me?

218
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:13,645
I'll give you a hint.

219
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:16,981
A hint?

220
00:15:22,565 --> 00:15:23,776
It's not a girl.

221
00:15:27,338 --> 00:15:28,338
Hmm.

222
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:39,482
Is it me?

223
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:40,967
No!

224
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,857
You?!

225
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:43,041
No, no, no!

226
00:15:43,596 --> 00:15:44,346
What the fuck?

227
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:46,198
Yeah, I don't fucking know.
Just tell me then.

228
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:50,503
"No, no, no!"
What, am I completely unattractive or what?

229
00:15:50,528 --> 00:15:52,057
No, not like that, but...

230
00:15:52,237 --> 00:15:53,526
No, it's not you.

231
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:01,085
Is it that...

232
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:05,526
Is it that guy from Vilde's revue group?

233
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,166
Yeah.

234
00:16:10,245 --> 00:16:11,245
What's his name?

235
00:16:11,518 --> 00:16:12,518
Even.

236
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:22,128
Good...

237
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,784
Good-looking guy, though.

238
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:24,932
What?

239
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:28,159
Yeah? What else am I supposed to say?

240
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:29,760
I don't even know myself.

241
00:16:33,605 --> 00:16:34,824
But...

242
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:37,933
What's the thing between the two of you?

243
00:16:39,652 --> 00:16:40,652
Nah...

244
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:45,018
Nah, I'm not actually sure, right now...

245
00:16:45,182 --> 00:16:48,214
I don't understand shit, because he's a
really back and forth kind of guy

246
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:49,276
And...

247
00:16:49,823 --> 00:16:50,893
And he has a girlfriend.

248
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:52,253
Oh, I see.

249
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:08,854
I think it's mine.

250
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,760
Hey.

251
00:17:18,457 --> 00:17:20,472
Nah, I'm eating a Kebab is all.

252
00:17:22,902 --> 00:17:23,902
Tomorrow?

253
00:17:25,808 --> 00:17:26,816
Okay. Where?

254
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,410
I'm not sure I can be bothered going
that far just for a party...

255
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:34,941
(Cheese toastie without cardamom.) (Meanwhile in
another universe: Cheese toastie with cardamom.)

256
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:36,206
Okay, I'll see you there, then.

257
00:17:36,713 --> 00:17:38,971
Maybe... Okay, bye.

258
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:43,682
What's that?

259
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,690
It's from Even.

260
00:17:56,277 --> 00:17:58,159
Like, he's got to break up
with his girlfriend.
