Better than ever. Ready to take down
Diaz anytime, anywhere.

We haven't been able to find him

using our usual tracking methods.

44
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,852
That's probably because Diaz
is controlling the entire city,

45
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,520
including police and cameras.

46
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,857
I just hacked a new thermal sensing
program from the NSA,

47
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,108
so maybe that gets us somewhere.

48
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,902
Point is, now, us is back to full

That's right.

50
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:39,075
Ricardo Diaz is working with
SCPD Captain Kimberly Hill,

and former Bratva <i>Pakhan</i>
named Anatoly Knyazev.

53
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,167
But that is just the tip
of the iceberg.

54
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,460
Ricardo Diaz has members
of Star City's

entire governmental infrastructure
either bought or compromised.

56
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,883
So how are we supposed to find him?

57
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,929
24/7 surveillance on all of Diaz's
known locations and subordinates

58
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,765
until either he or someone
he is working with makes a mistake.

but it doesn't look it.

it looks like you've been doing this

00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,287

Talking might be a bit
of an exaggeration.

71

Maldivian phone lines
aren't exactly the best.

72

73
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,464
I got something
that might help with Diaz.

74
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,549
Lydia Cassamento.

of her family business.

76
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,221
Now she runs weapons
for the Quadrant.

77
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,722
The Quadrant?

78
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,807
High-end cartel, ruled
by moneyed families

79
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,351
with ties to all things black market.

80
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:50,188
Guns, cryptocurrency, drugs, humans.

81
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,233
KH-11 picked up Cassamento
coming into Star City.

82
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,860
And you think Diaz is looking
to restock his firepower.

83
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,237
And if she's making
the trip personally

84
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,530
that means the deal she is working
on is big.

85
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,491
I got a tact team ready
to take her out.

No, belay that order.

she may lead us right to him.

{\an8}Hey, I don't want the basic cut.

93

Leave a little room for the guns.

00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,890
And don't forget, the muscles
are getting bigger.

00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,080
So you two are friends now?

161
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,292
I thought you wanted back in
with the Bratva, Anatoly.

162
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,294
So I delivered that to you.

163
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,004
And I thank you.

164
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,133
But over past year,
I see things a little more clearly.

165
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,890
I devote my whole life to brothers,

166
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,643
I even become their <i>Pakhan,</i>

167
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,897
and for a setback, they cast me out.

168
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,775
Well, Diaz is gonna do far worse
than cast you out.

169
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,611
If I betray him, yes,
but why would I do that?

170
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,280
[Anatoly chuckling]

171
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:37,368
Diaz is going to make me
a very rich man.

172
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:42,582
Bratva took 100 years to go
from prison into government,

173
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,001
Diaz did same thing in months.

174
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,752
I'm still gonna take him down.

175
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,629
Not alone, you cannot.

176
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:53,009
My mission was always supposed
to be solitary.

177
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:59,140
Put me with a team, fill it
with people that I care about,

178
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,311
it splits my focus.

179
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,730
Was that why you think Diaz
was able to beat you?

180
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,274
He took over the city
while I was distracted.

181
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,697
If you seriously believe that,

182
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,074
then you are even bigger fool
than I thought.

183
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,411
That is saying something.

184
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,916
Damn, it is good to be back.

185
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,170
[Curtis] Guess it's true what they say,
"There's no place like bunker."

186
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,422
I bet you really miss Curtis'
dad jokes.

187
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,799
You know what, I did, a little.

188
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,260
I missed this baby more.

189
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,555
Well, good. Because you are gonna be
wearing it plenty.

190
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,641
We are the only vigilante team
left standing.

191
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,059
What do you mean?

192
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,269
John got into a huge fight with
Oliver and joined A.R.G.U.S.

193
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,229
Then Oliver kicked Felicity
out of the bunker.

194
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,439
So now he's gone solo.

195
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,817
Oh. So Oliver finally
drove them all away.

196
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,362
Can't say I'm surprised.

197
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,072
Or that I care.

198
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,367
Taking down Diaz was always gonna
come down to the three of us.

199
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,993
So what's the plan?

200
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,871
Well, we can wait until
my NSA lead pans out.

201
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,206
Until then, we are kind of
dead in the water.

202
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,583
The city's dying. We just can't sit
around here picking our noses.

203
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,669
No, you're absolutely right. And we
need to go at this some way

204
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,337
that does not depend on finding Diaz.

205
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,922
Even if that means grasping
at straws.

206
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,091
Look, forget grasping at straws.

207
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,884
What if we grasp at his wallet?

208
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,346
The best way to get to Diaz
is to go after his operation.

209
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,806
What operation?

210
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,225
He was really deep
into pushing Vertigo.

211
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,476
Was?

212
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,603
John and Oliver took out
his operation three weeks ago.

213
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:31,107
Well, then that means Diaz has to be
in the market for a new supplier.

214
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,567
Or an old one.

215
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,278
Before Diaz went to prison,
he led the Scorpions.

216
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,988
That is Star City's biggest supplier.

217
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,156
That feels like a leap.

218
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,699
It may be, but it's all we got.

219
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,743
And even if it doesn't lead to Diaz,

220
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,162
we still take down a drug operation.
That's a win-win.

221
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,832
You know, but the problem is,
with me boxed out of the SCPD,

222
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,834
it's gonna be a lot harder
to get intel on the Scorpions.

223
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,460
Maybe not.

224
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,255
Diaz isn't the only person
who grew up in the Glades.

225
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,299
[Quentin] Well, I was pretty surprised
to get your invite.

226
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,634
Especially to this place.

227
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,178
You remember what I said about
coming here with my girls, huh?

228
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,513
[chuckling]

229
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,807
And the new location got an upgrade.

230
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,976
Not fancy enough for the new mayor?

231
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,812
It's perfect.

232
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,817
You okay?

233
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,695
I'm really sorry.

234
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,363
What are you talking about?

235
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,323
Mr. Mayor.

236
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,201
I've been meaning
to congratulate you.

237
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,329
I thought I'd come down here
in person.

238
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,500
I mean, you are the mayor of my city.

239
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,548
And we have a lot in common.

240
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,969
What the hell do you want?

241
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,805
Straight to business. I love it.

242
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,808
Here's an executive order

243
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:51,061
for a certain piece
of municipal real estate

244
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,938
to be sold privately.

245
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,983
Now, the good news, it's a bargain.

246
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,403
Well, I'm not signing this.
I'm not signing anything for you.

247
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,864
I would reconsider your position.

248
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,199
Really?

249
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,533
I bet

250
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,205
she'd give you that same advice.

251
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,083
I'm telling you right now,
if anything happens to her...

252
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,377
Why would I wanna hurt Laurel?

253
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,671
Hmm?

254
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,257
She's with me now.

255
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:27,640
And she is
such a smart, little thing.

256
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,018
[sighs]

257
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,187
She knows how to pick
the winning side.

258
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,941
I hope it runs in the family.

259
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,027
Let's go, baby.

260
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,614
Come on.

261
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,961
Behind that glass door is where
the Scorpions do their business.

-The problem is, it's sound proof.
-But not laser proof.

-You sure this is gonna work?
-Absolutely.

264
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,345
The CIA would kill to get a laser
microphone with this capacity.

265
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,638
How long is this gonna take?

266
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,019
Just trying to find a signal.

267
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,980
All right, well, let's hurry it up.
I didn't get a severance.

268
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,147
I really shouldn't be gambling.

269
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,191
Got something. [clears throat]

Huge deal going down tonight.

New buyer.

273

Is trying to get some product
to tide them over for the short-term.

274
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,536
Could be our friend.

275
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,288
They say when it's going down?

276
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,040
No, no, no. I lost the signal.

277
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,837
The big guy is blocking my laser.

278

Yo, man. You think I didn't see that?

You trying to copy my bets, hoss?

282
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,179
You trying to ruin my odds?

283
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,181
What the hell are you talking about?

284
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,268
[scoffs] So we lying now?
That's what we're doing?

Oh, damn.

Uh, you know what, I'm sorry.
I was wrong.

288
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,572
Here you go, man. That's yours.

289
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:10,075
I just get a little crazy
when I lose. Everybody, chill.

290

-Got it.

Well, let's ruin Diaz's next party.

[Mr. Terrific] What if we're wrong?

And those crates are filled with
something other than narcotics.

295
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:30,346
Like lollipops,
or I don't know, puppies.

296
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,641
[Black Canary] I counted a dozen
more guys out front, strapped up.

297
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,392
I'm guessing it's not puppies.

298
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,477
[Wild Dog] Look, we got to get this done

299

before the group outside
notices we're here.

300
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,481
And before Diaz's crew shows.

301
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,690
Let's do this.

-Or drugs.

the Scorpions are moving is M4s.

Yeah. Definitely.

-[men groaning]

319
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,795
Back door. Over there.

320
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:49,925
[gun cocks]

321
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,472
-[screeching]
-[men groaning]

322
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,228
[gunfire continues]

323
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,440
We're trapped.

324
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,816
-[radio beeps]
-Blow them all to hell.

325
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,621
Let's go, now!

326
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,506
{\an8}The Quadrant.

327
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,633
You know, I heard about these guys
when I was working undercover.

328
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,635
I never could get anyone to confirm
their existence.

329
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,263
Yeah, well, they are real.
Very, very, real.

330
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,974
We're tracking this one. Cassamento.
Hoping she will lead us to Diaz.

331
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,560
Yeah, well, we were hoping the
Scorpions would lead us to Diaz, too.

332
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,771
Got some intel they were planning
a huge thing tonight.

333
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,857
We just figured it was drugs.
Turns out it was an ambush.

334
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,442
Quadrant wanted the Scorpions dead.

335
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,735
They wanted us dead, too.

336
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,862
It's a good thing you guys showed up
when you did.

337
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,697
You probably want a thank you
or something, huh?

338
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:54,865
[scoffs]

339
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,118
What I want is to apologize, Rene.

340
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,790
My feelings on how you guys
conducted yourselves aside,

341
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,249
[sighs]

342
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,793
things got really out of hand.

343
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,754
And I'm sorry for the part
that I played in it.

344
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,923
Thanks, hoss.

345
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,550
Let's get back to work.

346
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,261
Everyone who thinks the Quadrant
showing up

347
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,639
when Diaz gets control of the city
is a coincidence

348
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,765
raise your hands.

349
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,851
The muscle that they brought in
yesterday were Diaz's guys.

350
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,687
The question is, what are they doing
working with the Quadrant?

351
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,148
A.R.G.U.S. think Cassamento is
planning to move a huge shipment

352
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,484
of weapons into the city.
Kasnian weapons.

353
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,277
Military grade. Much worse than
what we saw tonight.

354
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,403
[door opens]

355
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,572
We think Diaz may be helping her
with that operation.

356
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,243
Wasn't expecting to see you here.

357
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,411
Wasn't expecting to see you either.
Everything all right?

358
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,914
Not really.
Diaz just paid me a visit.

359
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:47,417
He wants me to sign over a piece
of city property to him. A building.

360
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,336
So why are you here instead
of talking to your boy?

361
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,630
Because I couldn't get in touch
with Oliver.

362
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,423
[sighs]

363
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,592
{\an8}The Quadrant. What is that?

364
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,929
Just a super powerful,
monolithic, secret organization.

365
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,222
No big deal.

366
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,557
Diaz was wearing that ring.

367
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,603
So Diaz isn't just working
with Cassamento. He...

368
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,313
He joined the Quadrant.

369
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,817
The attack on the Scorpions
was to take out the competition. His.

370
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,111
And I'm guessing
that that city property

371
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,572
will be a really nice place
to store all that foreign ordnance

372
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,448
that Cassamento is planning on
bringing into the city.

373
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,159
This city building that Diaz wants,

374
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,203
where is it?

375
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,291
My men have woken up
from tranquilizer dart.

376
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,377
Time to go see Diaz.

377
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,129
You think he'll give you a reward?

378
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,047
A man can dream.

379
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,134
But I settle for satisfaction.

380
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,136
Enjoy it while it lasts.

381
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,390
Because, Anatoly,
when you are no longer useful,

382
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,893
he'll cut you loose.

383
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,937
Just like Cayden James.

384
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:52,232
Cayden James made fatal mistake.

385
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,735
Underestimating Diaz.

386
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,862
I do not.

387
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,239
I see him for who he is.

388
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,158
I understand his code.

389
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,618
Diaz doesn't have a code.

390
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,662
He doesn't have honor.

391
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,625
But you working with him,

392
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:16,006
you are betraying everything
that you've ever believed in.

393
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,220
No need to be gentle with this one.

394
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,139
[Oliver grunts]

395
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,563
[John] It's pretty quiet around here.

396
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,026
You're really quiet, too.
Should I be taking that personally?

397
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,238
No, hoss. We're good.

398
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,990
That apology you made,

399
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:43,867
you got fiber, John.

400
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,953
What's on your mind?

401
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,123
I can't stop thinking about dying.

402
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,376
Hmm.

403
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,545
In the middle of the fight,
I just froze.

404
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,174
PTSD, fritz out... I mean...

405
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,886
Actually, it wasn't just so much
about dying as it was about...

406
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,596
Leaving Zoe without a father.

407
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,306
Yeah, you get it.

408
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,103
You got a kid younger than Zoe.
How do you deal with it?

409
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,647
I don't, man. Not out here.

410
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,774
When I put this holster on,

411
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,110
I leave daddy home.

412
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:22,239
I put the walls of
compartmentalizing up hard, Rene.

413
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,450
You've been out of the game
for a month, over a month.

414
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,994
It'll come back to you.

415
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,122
Just give it some time.

416
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,253
Yo, take a look at that.

417
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,467
[beeping]

418
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,808
[Rene] If Diaz's plan is
to store the weapons,

419
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,935
why are they bringing the crates
to the truck?

420
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,396
Cassamento's not looking
to move guns into the city.

421
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,024
She and Diaz are using the city
to ship them out.

422
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,359
Turning Star City into a way station.

423
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,653
Curtis, Dinah,
we've seen all we need to see.

424
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,572
Let's regroup at A.R.G.U.S.

425
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,952
-[knocking at door]
-[Quentin] You still here, Becky?

426
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:13,915
Nope.

427
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,877
Sorry. Not Becky.

428
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,881
Or Laurel. At least not my Laurel.

429
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,841
She wouldn't choose a guy like

430
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,010
Diaz.

431
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,803
You think he gives anyone a choice?

432
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,264
Do you?

433
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,142
That's why I'm here.

434
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,686
To tell you
that you don't have a choice.

435
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,021
You have to sign this.

436
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,564
Whatever Diaz wants you to sign.

437
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,651
Don't pretend like you give a crap
about me, all right.

438
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:46,156
You proud of yourself for turning
a father's grief against him?

439
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,035
As far as I'm concerned,
you're worse than Diaz.

440
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,912
You have no idea
what he is capable of.

441
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:55,123
I know what you're capable of.
You can bring walls smashing down.

442
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,249
You really expect me to believe

443
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,126
that you are scared
of a thug like Diaz?

444
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,004
So much more than just a thug.
And, yes.

445
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,175
Yes, I am scared.

446
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,969
And you should be scared, too.

447
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,806
So just sign the damn paper.

448
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,269
[exhales sharply] God damn it!

449
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,188
I made this so easy for you,
didn't I?

450
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,023
I let you into my home,
set you up,

451
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,983
the law books, everything.
I bet you and Diaz,

452
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,027
you must have just loved that.

453
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,449
Hate me all you want.
I'm sure I deserve it.

454
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,910
But I need you to sign this
or he's gonna kill you.

455
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,872
Now that the daughter act is shot,

456
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,461
there's no need for you
to be in my home,

457
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,797
is there?

458
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,759
All right, so when I get home
tonight, please,

459
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:51,638
I expect you to be gone, all right?
Please just be gone.

460
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,932
-Quentin...
-Please get out of here, now!

461
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,310
Now!

462
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,030
[John] Those Kasnian weapons
Cassamento imported

463
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,575
are shipping out tonight
for the Eastern Seaboard.

464
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,452
But even with A.R.G.U.S. backing
us up there's no way

465
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,413
we can stop all that ordnance.

466
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:19,207
-So what's the play?
-The play is we destroy it.

467
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,002
Tag the trucks. Let A.R.G.U.S.
attack them separately.

468
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,171
If Diaz is there,
we're taking him out.

469
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,589
That's the plan, right?

470
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:26,923
That is still the plan.

471
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:37,893
I won't let anyone split us up
ever again. I promise.

472
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,025
Rene.

473
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,027
You good?

474
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,695
I don't think so.

475
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:52,157
That compartmentalizing you talked

But what I do know is,
if I go out there like this,

479
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:00,916
I'm no good to anyone.

480

Sorry, but I think I might have to
sit this one out.

Just a tough reentry, that's all.

I've never heard you sound so scared.

489
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,418
It made me realize, you were serious.

490
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,714
Diaz is a monster.

491
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,177
And you can't even imagine
what it's been like.

492
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,179
Okay, back on the Earth you're from,

493
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,682
you got a guy named Damien Darhk,
real son of a bitch?

494

-Yeah.
-Well, I worked for him.

495
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,313
I'd do whatever he wanted

496
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,066
to keep my Laurel safe.

497
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,653
And then when I betrayed him...

498
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,534
He killed her.

499
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,913
What I'm trying to say is,

500
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:26,084
I know what it's like
to do a bad thing for a good reason.

501
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,551

You let me help you get away
from this guy.

-That's not possible.
-Come on.

505
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,603
I've known a lot of bad men,

506
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:50,900
and they've been filled with anger
and with hate, but not Diaz.

507
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:54,112
He's not filled with anger inside

508
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,197
because he's not even human inside.

509
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:03,204
I watched him burn a man alive
over a childhood grudge.

510
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,207
If I cross him,

511
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,127
what is he gonna do to me?

512
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,546
Well, I'm not gonna let him do
anything to you, all right?

513
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:14,257
Yeah, you're gonna protect me
because you're the mayor.

514
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,843
You're not the mayor of anything.

515

Okay, listen, I'm gonna protect you,

516
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:21,306
because I refuse to let
what happened to my Laurel

517
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:22,724
happen a second time.

518
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,312
Okay.

-You may be right.

Last year when I trusted you
to bring me into city.

you betray me first.

If Diaz and the Quadrant ship even
one of those crates...

638
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,656
you guys are gonna have to
open up bakery or something.

639
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,408
Yeah, this is her biology homework.
I'm letting her sleep in.

640
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:27,620
She crashed hard after finishing her
leftover mitochondria.

641
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,830
Gummy Worms. Good choice.

642
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,041
What are you doing here, hoss?

643
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,459
[sighs]

644
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,044
Just checking up on you.

645
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,798
Seeing if there is anything I can do
to speed up that

646
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,633
compartmentalizing you were
talking about.

647
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,677
It's been half a day, hoss.

648
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,264
Plus, you guys had a big win
without me yesterday.

649
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,183
It was just a small win, really.

650
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,689
Seriously, with Diaz working
with the Quadrant now,

651
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,274
things are only gonna get worse.

652
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,068
If we're gonna have a chance in hell
of stopping him,

653
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,861
we're gonna need all the help
we can get.

654
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,614
We're gonna need you.

655
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,659
Look, man,

656
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,538
every time I think about
going out there again,

657
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,416
all I can think of is Zoe.

658
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,669
What's gonna happen to her
if something happens to me?

659
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,879
I'll be fine, Dad.

660
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,009
Uncle Curtis and I were just
talking about...

661
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,094
How you both wear masks and go
and fight bad guys?

662
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:26,929
It's way obvious.

663
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,181
And you and Dinah talk way louder
than you think you do.

664
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,850
Really? [softly] Really?

665
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,435
Oh, I can actually hear it.
It's pretty loud.

666
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,312
[softly]
Sweetheart, come here. Sit down.

667
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,900
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

668
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,614
I don't need to be Wild Dog anymore.

669
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,825
Dad, this is my home.

670
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,535
And I want you to fight for it.

671
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,038
You know, I've been hurt in the past
year twice already.

672
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,331
I know.

673
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,333
And that was scary.

674
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,710
But you taught me to be brave,

675
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,420
and face up
to the things that scare me.

676
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,424
Come here. Come here.

677
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,385
I'll be brave
just like my little girl.

678
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,220
Okay?

679
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,556
Okay.

680
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,894
[sighs impatiently]

681
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,729
Now, who we planning on whacking?

682
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,982
That's what I've been thinking of.

683
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,526
Maybe your daddy.

684
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,154
Which is why I came to see you.

685
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,865
Mazel tov.

686
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:33,579
This is good.

687
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,790
What do you care about
owning this property legally?

688
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,541
It's not about legality.

689
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,795
It's about this.

690
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,050
I needed to know if I could trust
the new mayor.

691
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,718
And what if he didn't sign it?

692
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,181
What if?

693
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,907
We had an agreement if I recall.

694
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,910
I put you on the floor,

695
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,788
you leave the city.

696
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,415
That assumed a fair fight.

697
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,916
Potato, patato.

698
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:24,171
But I have a certain pang
of conscience.

699
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,759
I changed my mind.

700
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,594
You could stay in this city.

701
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,681
For 25 to life.

702
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,980
I'm thinking about moving up
your trial.

703
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,398
[groaning]

704
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,402
How's next week for you?

705
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,486
[handcuffs clicking]

706
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,323
Don't even think about getting bail.

707
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,827
I got a lot of friends

708
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,788
at the courthouse.
