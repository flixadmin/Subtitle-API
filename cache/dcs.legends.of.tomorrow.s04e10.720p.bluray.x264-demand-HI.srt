1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,016
[Sara] <i>Previously on</i>
Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,554
I have to keep you safe. Go!

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,456
[Agent Sharpe] <i>You've had Mona
in custody this whole time?</i>

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,630
You have the Kaupe, too?

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,360
Sara, you need to bring in that fugitive
before someone gets hurt.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,360
- [gunshot]
- [groans]

7
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:12,371
[agent] Step away
from the creature, miss.

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,400
You murdered him!

9
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,234
[growling]

10
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,576
Today, I asked you for one thing.

11
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,159
- Ava, don't do this.
- Just go.

12
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,096
[Zari] <i>So, I'll head to the Bureau
and do some digging.</i>

13
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,430
Hank is torturing prisoners off-site.

14
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,079
Keep digging.
I wanna know everything.

15
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,072
What do you mean
you couldn't capture the asset?

16
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,436
[agent] <i>Blame it on your son's
time-traveling pals, sir.</i>

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,311
<i>Now, let me just say this.</i>

18
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,835
<i>And I wanna say this
for the television audience.</i>

19
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,959
The people have a right to know,

20
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,436
whether or not
their President is a crook.

21
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,114
Well, I am a crook.

22
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,954
It actually felt good
to get that off my chest.

23
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,236
What other secrets
have I been holding back...

24
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,597
Oh, yes. Despite the constant
reassurances of my wife,

25
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,320
I know that I'm certainly
only an adequate lover.

26
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,856
- [reporter 1] <i>Mr. President?</i>
- [reporter 2] <i>Mr. President?</i>

27
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,176
<i>The President won't be taking
any more questions at this time.</i>

28
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,398
That is more about Tricky Dick
than I ever needed to know.

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,536
[Gideon] <i>And it's more than
the public needed to know.</i>

30
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,176
<i>In the days following
the news conference,</i>

31
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,591
<i>Nixon found himself unable to
tell a lie, resulting in global chaos.</i>

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,993
Nixon's blathering fouled up ongoing
peace talks and trade agreements...

33
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,357
Without the release of
<i>All the President's Men,</i>

34
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,113
Robert Redford's career floundered.

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,671
What? No Redford?
No Sundance. No indie film.

36
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,076
No artful nudity? We have to fix this!

37
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,710
The only thing nastier
than a politician lying,

38
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,519
is when he says how he really feels.

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,056
Now, there's no way he'd tell the truth
without a magical assist.

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,753
I hope the Watergate has vacancies,

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,992
because we need to make sure
that Nixon still cheats the press.

42
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,958
Captain's orders and all,

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,555
but you think it's really the best time
to be back on mission?

44
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,109
Yeah, I mean,
might do well to take a beat.

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,113
I appreciate your concern,
but I'll be fine.

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,476
Just because Ava and I
had a disagreement,

47
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,040
doesn't mean that I can't do my job.

48
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,839
I was actually talking about the fact

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,758
that we're on the outs
with the Time Bureau.

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,519
Yeah, and I was talking about Mona.

51
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,672
I mean, Hank's gonna be after us since
her boyfriend offed that agent, and...

52
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,480
Well, we can't
just stash her away forever.

53
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,350
Right.

54
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,231
Well, it has been eventful, but things
are gonna blow over with the Bureau.

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,392
We'll find a safe place for Mona,
and in the meantime,

56
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,957
I feel like we should be doing
what we do best.

57
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,759
- Am I right?
- Right.

58
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,309
Save Redford and independent film!

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,673
That's the spirit!

60
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,037
- Done it for worse reasons.
- Why not?

61
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,871
Director Sharpe, you look terrible.
What happened?

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,310
Joke acknowledged, Nathaniel,
but tighten up.

63
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,296
Director Sharpe is taking a leave of
absence to get her priorities straight.

64
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,118
I'll be acting as
Director of the Bureau.

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,590
[stammers] Wait, so, you're gonna be
in charge from now on?

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,955
- That's... It's great.
- Great.

67
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,656
Looking forward to working with you,
Director Heywood.

68
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,353
Glad to have you on board, Agent Tomaz.

69
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,109
Though my first job is a sensitive one.

70
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,439
I need to catch the Legends.

71
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,234
This is the last time
they will thumb their nose at authority,

72
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,879
and get away with it.

73
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,552
I know they are your friends.
So, you wanna sit this one out?

74
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,440
No, no, Dad. You know what?
We have your back.

75
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,393
Agreed. I stand by the Time Bureau,
and by my man.

76
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,914
Thank you, babe.

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,116
[Hank] Glad to hear it.

78
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,432
We'll pinpoint the location
of the <i>Waverider,</i> and pay it a visit.

79
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,794
We'll meet in the situation room, 0900.

80
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,678
Yes, sir, copy that.

81
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,276
We need to expose what Hank's up to
before he drops a hammer on the Legends.

82
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,471
Did you just call me "babe"?

83
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,280
Yeah, I was riffing,
I was trying to keep this thing afloat.

84
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,194
[clears throat] Anyway,
now that we are stuck with Hank,

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,636
we can't go through his phone ourselves.

86
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,918
With Ava gone,
there's no one here left to trust.

87
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,755
Well, there's one person we can trust.

88
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,357
Gary, we need to talk.

89
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,397
Is this about what happened
between Sara and Ava?

90
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,631
Wait. You're working at the Bureau?

91
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,716
Yes, and...
I need you to do something for me.

92
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,840
And you're my boss! Which is great.
You know, I'm happy for you.

93
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,992
- No one deserves it more.
- Damn it, Gary, focus.

94
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,231
Hank is causing total chaos here.

95
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,471
Did you notice him
using Director Sharpe's mug, too?

96
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,837
- I was gonna say something.
- It goes much deeper than that.

97
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,436
Mona was right.
Hank is running some secret project.

98
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,797
Now that he's in charge of the Bureau,
he's trying to shut down the Legends.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,275
Nate and I cloned his phone.

100
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,456
We're going to keep him busy.
You need to go through his activity,

101
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,976
find out what he's been up to
so we can end his time with the Bureau.

102
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,118
Use this to stay in touch
without being monitored, okay?

103
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,159
I've always wanted
to untangle a conspiracy.

104
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,776
I'll need a bulletin board, index cards,

105
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,696
I already have yarn,
I've been getting into crochet.

106
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,360
- Yeah, me, too.
- We should start a club.

107
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,920
We'll talk.

108
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
Okay.

109
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,994
[sighs]

110
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,190
[Mona] <i>Konane! No!</i>

111
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,749
[growling]

112
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,756
[growls]

113
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,829
- [Mick] Kid, you okay in there?
- [gasps]

114
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,792
Sorry, I never used a future
tech toilet before. So many buttons.

115
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,960
Hmm.

116
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,316
Give it time.
You'll learn to live with it.

117
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,476
Oh, uh...

118
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,789
Don't touch the red button.

119
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,956
[Mona] Oh, Captain,
I wanted to talk to you.

120
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,394
Good. I need to talk to you, too.

121
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,496
So, as far as the Bureau is concerned,
you're a fugitive.

122
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,536
I need you to stay on the ship,
and not draw any attention.

123
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,233
It's not just that. Um...

124
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,556
- When we were in Mexico...
- When we were in Mexico,

125
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,400
a man got murdered by Konane
because you said we could trust him.

126
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,392
No, Konane didn't...

127
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,639
He didn't mean to.

128
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,351
Look, Mona, whatever it is,
it's in the past.

129
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,836
Now it's on to the next problem.
That's how this works.

130
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,496
Mick, Nixon's supposed to give his
"I'm not a crook" speech tomorrow.

131
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,671
We need him back
to his lying self by then.

132
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,831
You and John stay on the ship,
look after Mona,

133
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,176
and make sure
she doesn't get into any trouble.

134
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,080
And make sure
she doesn't touch that red button.

135
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,751
I'm telling you I'm not crazy.

136
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,036
In fact,
I've never felt better in my life.

137
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,953
And that's the truth!

138
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,398
Hear that? "The truth." Something
is very wrong with the President.

139
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,836
And he's supposed to be
at Disney's Contemporary Hotel

140
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,037
to address the entire
American press corps tomorrow.

141
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,395
We'll take care of it.

142
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,039
[agent] I'll update the VP.

143
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,954
All right, sir.
We'll start off with a little sedative.

144
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,716
[groans]

145
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,630
[groans]

146
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,916
I don't know why you lot
are relying on my powers.

147
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,639
They're still all mucked up.

148
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,790
[Sara] It'll be fine.

149
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,759
We'll get him to the ship, fix what's
wrong, and we'll be right back.

150
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,516
[sigh] Now, let's see
your Nixon impression.

151
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,395
[sighs]

152
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,680
[sighs]

153
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:43,673
- [chuckles]

154
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,432
We got the cargo. We're on our way.

Let's figure out what loosed his tongue
and get the hell out of here, shall we?

00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,400
Listen, you guys can't be here.
The Bureau's on to you.

157
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,159
Good, time for a pig roast.

158
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,336
No one's roasting anyone,
and it's not just the Bureau,

159
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,536
it's my dad, and he's got backup. Go!

160
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,676
No, not again.

161
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,797
Guys, we're working on
stopping Hank for good.

162
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,216
In the meantime, you need to find
the team and stay ahead of him.

163
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,560
On it.

164

00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,680

167

Oh, they think of everything.

177

Nicely done.

I want our men watching every time jump,

There. There's our getaway.

That's a bit on the nose, no?

00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,716
- [siren blaring]
- Who called the cops?

314
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,029
Cops?

315
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,355
I've never been pulled over before.
What do I do?

316
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,312
You just pull over.

317
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,319
[Ray sighs and clears his throat]

318
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,631
All right, just be cool, you got this.

319
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,230
[grunts]

320
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,390
Good afternoon...

321
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,200
Good afternoon, Officer.

322
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,480
I watched you drivin'.

323
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,359
- You're havin' a fine afternoon.
- Yeah.

324
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,920
What is it? Drinkin'?

325
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
Drugs?

326
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:08,799
No, sir. No, sir, we're just, uh...

327
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,196
Just driving and having
a little steering-wheel problem.

328
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,056
Tell me some more about
this steering-wheel trouble.

329
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,719
Well, it's a real doozy.

330
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,589
So, I'm here with my family,
and we're on our way to North Carolina

331
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,876
to see the largest chest of drawers.

332
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
Ray!

333
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,271
So, the steering wheel was a little
loose, and so, I turned to my wife,

334
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,876
Claire, and I said...

335
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,074
[swallows]

336
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,151
My friends and I here
are time travelers.

337
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,800
We've kidnapped Nixon,
and we're headed to Disney World.

338
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,956
[sighs]

339
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,600
Like I thought.

340
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,877
You're high as a Goodyear blimp.
I'm calling this in.

341
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,951
[chuckles] Get this out of me!

342
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,793
[chanting]

343
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,280
How'd it even...

344
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
Mona!

345
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,754
[officer] <i>I'm at Exit 244.</i>

346
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,958
<i>I got an RV full of hopheads
who claim they're from the future.</i>

347
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
See?

348
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,439
[chuckles] Come on, son, let's go grab
our guys the old-fashioned way.

349
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,440
Mmm-hmm.

350
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:16,319
Wait, Nate. I tuned this to a frequency
Hank can't read.

351
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,471
And I think I know a way
to contact the team.

352
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,280
It's a little old-school,
but it should work.

353
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,200
I'll be in touch.

354
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,176
[sighs] I can't have a ticket
on my record.

355
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,714
I can't have a ticket on my record!

356
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,016
Nabbin' Nixon is gonna give you
more than a bloody ticket, mate.

357
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,633
Gun it! I'm bored.

358
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
He's right. Gun it.

359
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,240
- But then we'll become fugitives!
- We're already fugitives.

360
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,033
- Move.
- Hey!

361
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,354
You come back here!

362
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,795
Officer, we heard
your report from up high.

363
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,030
Where are the offenders?

364
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,998
[officer]
Uh... I was fixing to call it in.

365
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,152
You let them get away?

366
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,114
You're gonna have to find another
way home because that's my car now.

367
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,636
There's a new sheriff in town.

368
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,834
Let's ride.

369
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,589
[laughter]

370
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,433
Nice moves, Palmer.

371
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,715
[siren blaring]

372
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,956
They're gaining.

373
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,158
Yeah, I don't think
that's the cops on us, mate.

374
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,271
Whoa! Hank! This car has no airbags
or traction control.

375
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,754
[laughs] Exactly!

376
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,917
Nothin' but pure V8 power!

377
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,800
- [engine revving]
- Whoa! Okay.

378
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,154
We gotta lose Hank.
You got something for this, John?

379
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,954
I might. But I'll need you
to get us off the road quick, squire.

380
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,432
[chanting]

381
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,556
Where the hell did they go?

382
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,149
[radio static]

383
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,152
What is with the radio?

384
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,596
[Zari] <i>The heat's heavy
on the highway tonight,</i>

385
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,036
<i>and that's no weather report.</i>

386
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,396
<i>But lucky for you, you're not alone,</i>

387
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,633
<i>because you've got DJ Z to guide you
past those bad vibes.</i>

388
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,632
"DJ Z." That sounds like Zari.

389
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,713
Right now, the beat on the street
is to lay low.

390
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,032
But while you park it,
here's a hit to keep you safe.

391
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,591
All right, you heard her.
We should keep a low profile.

392
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,576
If we leave by night,
we should be able to make it.

393
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,276
In the meantime, no drawing attention,
and no altering the timeline.

394
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,829
Well, we best keep that bug
bottled then, eh?

395
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,920
The only way to keep it contained is
for everyone to stay completely honest.

396
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,672
What the hell is going on here?

397
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,996
Checkers!

398
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,790
Maybe it's best if
we all just don't talk.

399
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,958
Now, we just enter a command line
to a mirror site...

400
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,551
And we can get into his email.

401
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,075
His email's linked to a private server.

402
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,674
Must be where he's got his dirt.

403
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,991
We need a password.

404
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,596
Uh... Or we can reset it.
I forget my passwords all the time.

405
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,990
Those memory flashers
have a lot of side effects.

406
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,230
Password reset question.

407
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,117
We'll need some personal info from Hank.

408
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,079
[tablet beeps]

409
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,070
What's the word?

410
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
Sorry.

411
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,919
Gary, what's the word?

412
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,832
I'll need some scoop on Hank.

413
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
[Zari] <i>Stand by, Gary.</i>

414
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
[sighs]

415
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,839
<i>Hey, Nate, we need to know the name
of your dad's childhood pet.</i>

416
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,471
<i>And whatever you do,
keep your dad off the FM.</i>

417
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,994
I'm on it, Z.

418
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
[Hank groans]

419
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,277
That's a pretty cool trick.

420
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,035
You drink a lot of Cokes
when you were a kid?

421
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
Yeah.

422
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,273
Mom used to give me a quarter

423
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,536
for the corner store,
let me pick out whatever I wanted.

424
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,096
With her raising me on her own,
a quarter was more than I even knew.

425
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,430
You never really talked
about your childhood much.

426
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,598
Like, I'm not sure I know
where you were born.

427
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,832
Hackensack. In New Jersey.

428
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,958
Like the Billy Joel song.
We should turn on the radio.

429
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,952
1973, great year for music.

430
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,636
Actually, why don't we, uh, talk?
You know, get to know each other.

431
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,595
[chuckles]

432
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,912
- You're right, Nathaniel.
- You could call me "Nate."

433
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,680
You have a dog?

434
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,680
[scoffs] A lab.

435
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,638
You know, named him Silver.

436
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,633
- After the Lone Ranger...
- Lone Ranger's horse, yes.

437
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,359
Yes, yes, yes.

438
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,397
You used to show me old episodes.

439
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,753
Well, at least I taught you something.

440
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,956
Huh.

441
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,034
[Hank clears throat]

442
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,998
You know, my mom used to take me
on road trips, stop for ice cream...

443
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,193
Without Dad around,
she really had to play both roles.

444
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,591
She didn't know how to be a father,
but... She did her best.

445
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,158
Guess I could say the same for myself.

446
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,473
[clears throat] Well, it's nice we get
to make up for some lost time. Huh?

447
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,191
But we should get back to the ship.
See if Zari's back online.

448
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,430
Actually, um,

449
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,354
why don't we forget the Legends
for a minute and go get some ice cream?

450
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,400
Fine idea, Nathaniel.

451
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,389
Nate.

452
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,600
[engine starts]

453
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:35,241
[Zari]
<i>Hey, Gary, the answer is "Silver."</i>

454
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,753
- "Silver." I'm in!
- [beeps]

455
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,395
Hackers do say that in real life.

456
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,080
[Nora] What is this?

457
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,912
Property deed in Hank's name from 1912?

458
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,633
It's a shipment for dwarf-star alloy...
From 1837?

459
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,315
He's using time travel
for personal gain?

460
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,230
That is against Bureau creed.
I have a copy in my wallet.

461
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,456
- [footsteps approaching]
- [shushes]

462
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,960
Somebody's coming!

463
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,757
[eerie indistinct voices]

464
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,838
[eerie indistinct voices continue]

465
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,151
- [sighs]
- Who was that?

466
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,874
Are you okay?

467
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,470
You have to take this to Zari,
and stop digging.

468
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,918
I'll go back to my cell.

469
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,400
And, Gary...

470
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,916
Be careful.

471
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,396

[phone ringing]

473
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,637
I got an alert that someone recovered
your password from the Time Bureau,

474
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,359
and they're accessing your accounts.

475
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,116
But who would...
How would they even...

476
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,560
Thanks.

477
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,199
It won't happen again.

478
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,240
[music playing on stereo]

479
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,320
You know, I was just thinking that
even though we've had some setbacks,

480
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,353
that this road trip has really been
a great bonding experience.

481
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,432
I think you're an idiot.

482
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,956
[hissing]

483
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,040
[Ray drumming]

484
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,759
Well, look,
we've dealt with a lot lately,

485
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,356
and I think this is a very needed chance

486
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,114
for us to sit,
and really talk about how we feel.

487
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,079
Well, I'm glad you're happy.
No, wait, I mean... [gasps]

488
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,416
I don't give a damn if you're happy,
and I certainly don't trust you lot

489
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,296
in helping me face Neron, no matter
how many go-team prep talks you give.

490
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,391
Well, you can't keep me down.

491
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,718
[Ray] Actually, ever since I met you,

492
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,156
I sometimes lie awake at night,

493
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,836
staring into the dark thinking,
"I am it, and it is me."

494
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,520
Also, I don't think Han shot first.

495
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,960
I'm gonna go sit up front.

496
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,256
[Ray] Also, I used the strategy guide

497
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,160
to beat the Water Temple
in <i>The Legend of Zelda.</i>

498
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,515
I think it's a cool look, but the whole
loosened tie is a little try-hard...

499
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,758
Yeah, well, it's not like
I went and loosened it myself.

500
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,496
Yeah, well, at least
I don't go and make up

501
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,319
my own silly superhero names
like Atom and Heat Wave.

502
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,480
Like I care what you think.

503
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,156
[gasps]

504
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,389
I wanna grow my hair out
to look like Fabio.

505
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,994
Right, I think that'd be good.

506
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,318
So, honestly,
even as much as I trust Sara,

507
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,551
this has been
one disaster after another,

508
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,109
and I really think that this time,
we are totally screwed.

509
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,240
[Sara sighs]

510
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:58,151
Captain, we're okay, right?

511
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,835
I mean, we just
have to focus on the mission.

512
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,718
Yeah, Mona, we're gonna be fine.

513
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
[gasps]

514
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,400
[groans]

515
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,437
Of course we're not fine, Mona!

516
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,514
Nothing is fine,
and I am definitely not fine.

517
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,717
Ava and I didn't just
get into an argument.

518
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,430
She asked me to leave, and she
hasn't answered any of my calls since.

519
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,753
And she was my one chance,
my one chance, Mona, at something real.

520
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,912
And now, I don't have a ship,
I don't have a girlfriend,

521
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,756
and I am the captain of an RV,
and it is all your fault!

522
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,477
Well, I won't be your problem anymore.

523
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,278
- [door opens]
- [sighs]

524
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,792
Mona! Mona, wait!

525
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,992
Mona, come back!

526
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,159
Mona, come back!

527
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,712
Look, I meant everything I said,
but if you stay here in 1973,

528
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,314
you'll never survive!

529
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,397
John, get this thing out of me!

530
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,430
[chanting]

531
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,273
[spits]

532
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,871
All right, you guys
get Nixon to Florida.

533
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,576
If you leave now,
there'll be time to spare.

534
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
What about you?

535
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:25,161
Mona's out there alone,
and we don't leave our people behind,

536
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,232
no matter how much
they bug the crap out of us.

537
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,471
I'd say no pun intended,
but that would be a lie.

538
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,576
- Here you go, mate. Hold that, will you?
- What? Where are you going?

539
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,069
I just need to stretch my legs, squire.

540
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,075
You all right, Dad?
You didn't finish your ice cream.

541
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,676
- Put on your seat belt.
- What's the hurry?

542
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,238
The Legends' RVwas spotted
just outside Richmond.

543
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,075
My men are setting up a blockade.
They won't get away this time.

544
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,479
That's great. That's great!

545
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,789
[whooping]

546
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,275
This is what I dreamed about
when I joined the Bureau.

547
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,360
Stealing a cop car?

548
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,277
You and me working together.

549
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
Uh, yeah, well... Ooh.

550
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,479
You know what, Dad,
that ice cream is not agreeing with me.

551
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,598
Can you, uh... [clears throat]
Can you pull over?

552
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,478
[exhales heavily]

[Nate] <i>Z? Z, can you hear me?</i>

554
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,960
Nate, is that you?

555
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,872
Hey, listen, I need you
to warn the team.

556
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,310
Hank's got a blockade on the highway
north of Richmond.

557
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,040
They gotta find another route.
You got it?

558
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,480
Roger. Over and out.

559
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,312
There you go, hon.

00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,016
- [agent 1] All right, what do you want?
- [agent 2] Whatever's fast and cheap.

561
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,759
[Mona] Oh, no, please, no.

562
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,635
Can I get six Daphne House burgers
and a round of sodas?

563
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,550
[waitress] Comin' up.

564
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,119
Sara, hold up. Hey!

565
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,797
How do you even know where she went?

566
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,270
Bike treads went this way,
we passed a diner a while back,

567
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,397
- she's probably headed there.
- Hmm.

568
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,750
Go ahead.

569
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,118
I know you've been dying to say,
"I told you so," so, just do it.

570
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,591
It was quite the opposite, actually.
I wanted to see how you're holdin' up.

571
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,040
[sighs] Honestly, I'm freaking out.

572
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,910
With the Kaupe dead and Mona in
the wind, and then there's Ava, and...

573
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,240
[sighs]

574
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,714
What happened?

575
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,678
I went to go talk to her and...

576
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,440
And I thought everything was
gonna be fine, 'cause it's always fine,

577
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,240
and... It was bad, John.

578
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,594
I don't know how to convince everybody

579
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,235
that everything's okay
when I'm not okay.

580
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,936
Well, you know, if we were
in each other's shoes right now,

581
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,270
then you'd be giving me
some rubbish speech

582
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,636
about how you don't have to
shoulder the burden myself,

583
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,076
when I have friends around me
to help me carry it.

584
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,279
Not that I believe you for a second,
but that doesn't mean it's not true.

585
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,040
Thanks.

586
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,200
Even if you're just lying
to make me feel better.

587
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,840
No, I definitely am.
Hope it worked, though.

588
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,120
- You all right there?
- Yeah. I'm great.

I don't recognize her... Or him.

- Yeah, but we're going the wrong way!
- No. We're right on target.

Wait. I remember you.

You're the one Director Heywood fired.

00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,671
I'll do it. I'll shoot!

625
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,513
The Kaupe must have scratched her.

626
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,155
She tried to tell me...

627
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,674
And I didn't listen.

628
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,434
- Mona, put him down!
- Come on, love, this isn't you.

[Ray] What are we gonna do?

632
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,656
- We can't drive through 'em.
- Kill 'em.

633
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,600
- What?
- Kill 'em all.

634
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:11,520

[siren wiling]

638
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,635
Nate's here.
I'm sure we can talk this all out.

639
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,999
You wanna do the honors, son?

640
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,120
Damn right, Dad.

641
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,154
All right. Don't worry, buddy,
I'll get you out of this.

642
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,957
Hey, Mr. Heywood,
if we could just talk about this,

643
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,636
I'm sure we can explain and show you how
this is just one big misunderstanding...

644
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,119
How's that
for a misunderstanding, you pig!

645
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,119
By the power vested to me
by the United States government,

646
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,591
I hereby arrest both of you
on five charges of treason,

647
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,831
- two of conspiracy, and...
- [agent] Uh... Sir?

648
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,593
Mr. President, are you all right?

649
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
No!

650
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,758
These two men and their
co-conspirators kidnapped me.

651
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,476
They've besmirched my good name
and I've done nothing to deserve it.

652
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,560
Uh-oh!

653
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,316
[hissing]

[gulps]

655
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,710
Well, actually, there is nothing good
about my name.

656
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,639
If you were born with
the name "Dick Milhous,"

657
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,275
you'd grow up to be a bastard, too.

What the hell?

660
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,438
Listen to me, Mona.
No one else needs to get hurt.

00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,600
I'm sorry about that, love.

664
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Bloody hell!

665
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,000
[Mona growling]

666
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,037
Mona, can you hear me?

667
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,434
Come on, I know you're in there!
Look, it's me! It's Sara.

668
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,238
I know it's you, Sara.
I remember everything.

669
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,471
You pretended to be a friend.

670
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,875
- I looked up to you!
- Mona...

671
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,320
It was all lies.

672
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,079
Mr. President, what is going on?

673
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,949
I don't know! I'm supposed
to be in Florida, lying to the press.

674
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,111
He ingested a truth bug.

675
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,955
See, these blunders are the exact reason
why we should lock up the Legends.

676
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,752
Nathaniel, are you all right?

677
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,431
No, I'm not.
I've been keeping secrets from you.

678
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,910
You think I don't know that?

679
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,670
But it's more than
your secret Pentagon side project.

680
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,896
It's always been like this, Dad.

681
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,594
The lying,
and the hiding of the feelings...

682
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,336
Now that I'm getting to be honest,

683
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,398
I just wanna tell you I love you,
but you just make it so damn hard.

684
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,840
Look, son, you don't understand.

685
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,896
And I like working with you
at the Time Bureau, side by side.

686
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,673
I've never felt closer to you.

687
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,436
But now, I'm having like a hard time
even looking in your face.

688
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,236
Just tell me why.
Why are you doing all this?

689
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,154
Why are you pretending
that we are on the same side?

690
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,434
I can't.

691
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,878
But everything I've done
has been for you.

692
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,912
And the fact that it's hurting you,
Nate, it's killing me.

693
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,434
But I wanna make this right.

694
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,720
Okay.

695
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,631
You let the Legends walk.

696
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,712
That, or you lock me up, too.

697
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,277
Because if you don't trust them,
then you and I are not on the same side.

698
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,077
Stand down!
The Legends are free to go.

699
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,229
From now on, we work together.
No more lies.

Watch yourself, love.
She's not in her right mind.

No, that's the problem.

704
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,075
She is.

705
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,637
Mona, look, please stop.

706
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,797
I should've never blamed you
for everything.

707
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,556
Look, Ava, the ship, Konane,
none of it was your fault.

708
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,998
And I am so sorry
that I told you to ignore your feelings.

709
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,878
It was because I thought...

710
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,496
Look, I thought that if I could
forget the way that I was feeling,

711
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,239
then maybe, it wouldn't hurt so bad.

712
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,795
Look, Mona, I was wrong. I was so wrong.

713
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,760
And you don't have to
bury your feelings.

714
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,479
You can let them out.

You promise?

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,032
I promise.

I told my dad I love him.

couldn't even get me to do that.

- I love you so big.

agree with you, but, uh...

If Nathaniel trusts you, then so do I.

you can get that ship of yours working.

Nope, it was Zari the whole time.

781
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,758
I mean no disrespect.

782
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,354
I value the work that we've done,

783
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,239
and I understand why it needs
to remain top-secret.

784
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,392
But I have a new partner now.

785
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,874
My son.

786
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,156
And I can't let anything
come between us.

787
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,475
What are you saying, Henry?

788
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,958
I'm saying that
I don't need you anymore.

789
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,680
If that's the case,
I don't need you anymore, either.

790
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,160
[gasps] No!

791
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,519
You're gonna have to let me
out of here.

792
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,517
You need to let me out of here! Gary!

793
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,194
Anybody!

794
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,080
[Hank] No! No!

[Hank] Please, no! No.

798
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,319
Somebody help me.

799

802
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,470
No! No, no, no!

803
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,755
[Nate] Dad?

804
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,390
Nate!

805
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,519
- What did you do?
- I didn't...

806
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,516
What did you do?

807
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,960
[sighs]

808
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,231
Nate. Listen... Listen to me.

809
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,390
She's right there.

810
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,280
I'm sorry.
