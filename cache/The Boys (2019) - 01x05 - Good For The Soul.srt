1
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:18,407
Hey, baby.

2
00:00:18,448 --> 00:00:19,884
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:19,908 --> 00:00:22,035
Where have you been?
It's been days.

4
00:00:22,077 --> 00:00:23,912
Yeah. I've been
handling business.

5
00:00:23,954 --> 00:00:25,247
It's okay now, it's okay.

6
00:00:25,288 --> 00:00:27,916
You said I had to hide, you said
we were in trouble and...

7
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:30,419
You know, I think, I think
I got it worked out.

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,463
I think I have
some-some good news.

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,966
Good news?

10
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:40,303
Stillwell. She's open
to us going public.

11
00:00:40,345 --> 00:00:42,764
Don't you lie to me.

12
00:00:42,806 --> 00:00:44,599
Hand on a Bible.

13
00:00:46,893 --> 00:00:50,188
Yeah. But, listen,

14
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,817
for us to go public,
you have to come clean with me.

15
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:56,486
Like, I have to know
who you told about Compound V.

16
00:01:02,284 --> 00:01:03,535
Hey, come on.

17
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:09,166
This is, this is you and me.

18
00:01:09,207 --> 00:01:12,836
I mean, we're Bonnie and Clyde.

19
00:01:12,878 --> 00:01:15,672
Ride or die, right?

20
00:01:18,258 --> 00:01:21,136
I...

21
00:01:21,178 --> 00:01:23,013
Oh, shit.

22
00:01:26,683 --> 00:01:29,936
I told these guys,

23
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:33,565
you were running the V
down near the Noodle Palace.

24
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:36,943
I'm so sorry, baby.

25
00:01:36,985 --> 00:01:38,278
I had to. I...

26
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,821
Why?

27
00:01:41,823 --> 00:01:43,408
What do they have on you?

28
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,036
I don't know their names,

29
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:48,497
but there was this British guy,

30
00:01:48,538 --> 00:01:51,333
dark hair, real smug asshole.

31
00:01:51,374 --> 00:01:53,752
Buzz cut French guy,
big black guy with a goatee,

32
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:55,170
and a skinny white kid.

33
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:58,757
I think they were all
working together. Mm-hmm.

34
00:02:02,177 --> 00:02:04,638
- I'm so sorry, baby.
- Nah.

35
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:05,972
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay.

36
00:02:06,014 --> 00:02:07,682
- I fucked up so bad.
- It's all right.

37
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:11,186
You know what I was
thinking about

38
00:02:11,228 --> 00:02:12,395
on my run over here?

39
00:02:14,397 --> 00:02:16,441
Our first date.

40
00:02:19,694 --> 00:02:21,071
Most first dates

41
00:02:21,113 --> 00:02:24,074
order, like, a scallop

42
00:02:24,116 --> 00:02:26,118
and a bottle of water.

43
00:02:28,203 --> 00:02:30,038
But you...

44
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,085
got a dark beer,

45
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:36,753
a New York strip,

46
00:02:36,795 --> 00:02:41,007
and chocolate chip cheesecake.

47
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:42,843
I remember thinking,

48
00:02:42,884 --> 00:02:44,970
"Here's someone

49
00:02:45,011 --> 00:02:47,472
who isn't afraid to be happy."

50
00:02:50,725 --> 00:02:53,478
And I fell for you,
right then and there.

51
00:02:57,023 --> 00:02:58,900
I love you.

52
00:03:00,652 --> 00:03:02,904
I love you, too.

53
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:19,588
Why?

54
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:42,611
Well?

55
00:03:42,652 --> 00:03:45,864
Heroin overdose.

56
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:50,827
I'm sorry to hear that.

57
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:52,037
And the V?

58
00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:54,039
- She told some guys about it.
- No, no.

59
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,082
I mean you.

60
00:03:57,542 --> 00:04:00,921
Come on, A-Train.

61
00:04:00,962 --> 00:04:02,923
You've been shooting it up
for weeks.

62
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:04,716
You really think
I wouldn't notice?

63
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:07,886
I'm done, man.

64
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:09,679
Nah, I'm fucking,
I'm fucking done.

65
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:11,514
- Cold turkey.
- Really?

66
00:04:11,556 --> 00:04:12,933
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

67
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:15,310
Good.

68
00:04:15,352 --> 00:04:18,313
Yeah.

69
00:04:18,355 --> 00:04:20,690
You know,

70
00:04:20,732 --> 00:04:23,193
you really screwed up, kiddo.

71
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:27,364
But you did the right thing
coming to me,

72
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:28,698
and I'm proud of you.

73
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,909
Thanks, Homelander,

74
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:33,662
for giving me the chance.

75
00:04:33,703 --> 00:04:35,538
I appreciate it.

76
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,585
Hey. Come on.

77
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:45,382
I love you.

78
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:46,758
We're family.

79
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,512
I'll always be
watching over you.

80
00:04:52,597 --> 00:04:54,140
Always.

81
00:04:56,142 --> 00:04:57,978
Attaboy.

82
00:04:58,019 --> 00:04:59,854
Oh, and the misplaced
Asian girl?

83
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:01,106
I'll find her.

84
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,652
Fuck.

85
00:05:18,248 --> 00:05:19,916
Le poulet.

86
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:22,460
Massage the bird with olive oil,

87
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:24,587
then a sprinkle
of salt and pepper,

88
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:26,548
then I bake.

89
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:30,302
Basting every 20 minutes
to keep it from drying out

90
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:32,637
is very important.

91
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:37,934
Till it's crisp,
but not too crunchy.

92
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:44,232
And voilà.

93
00:05:50,113 --> 00:05:52,991
I think you understand me.

94
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:54,409
It's in your eyes.

95
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:58,038
Can you speak?

96
00:06:00,832 --> 00:06:02,917
Tell me what you know,
mon coeur.

97
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,129
So we can find these fuckers

98
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:08,923
who did this to you,

99
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:11,051
so I can get you back home.

I like this outfit.
You know, the other one had...

112
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:50,840
Oh, my God.

113
00:06:50,882 --> 00:06:52,675
The other one had kind of
like a, you know,

114
00:06:52,717 --> 00:06:54,511
a Nikki Minaj thing going on.

115
00:06:54,552 --> 00:06:56,304
Oh, yeah, the other one sucks.

116
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:58,014
They're only letting me
wear this one

117
00:06:58,056 --> 00:07:00,850
because, apparently,
it's family friendly.

118
00:07:00,892 --> 00:07:02,977
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

119
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:04,854
You know,
I'm surprised you came.

120
00:07:04,896 --> 00:07:07,774
I seem to remember
you inviting me?

121
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:09,692
No, I mean,
I'm-I'm glad you came.

122
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:11,736
You just... I don't know,

123
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:15,615
you don't really strike me
as the religious type.

124
00:07:15,657 --> 00:07:19,202
Well, yeah, lapsed, but I served
my time in Sunday school.

125
00:07:19,244 --> 00:07:21,454
- Hmm.
- Hey, Starlight.

126
00:07:21,496 --> 00:07:22,622
Hi.

127
00:07:22,664 --> 00:07:25,208
Okay, so, do you know
everybody here,

128
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,876
or just, like, 99.9%?

129
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:28,962
No. My mom and I, um,

130
00:07:29,003 --> 00:07:32,674
we would drive coast to coast
in her brown Honda Civic,

131
00:07:32,715 --> 00:07:34,592
just doing the whole
Christian Circuit thing.

132
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:37,637
You know, Power Fest,
Capes for Christ,

133
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:38,763
Believe Expo.

134
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:41,474
We wore

135
00:07:41,516 --> 00:07:44,310
the tires off of that car.
These people are like

136
00:07:44,352 --> 00:07:45,937
family to me.

137
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:49,315
After everything
that's happened,

138
00:07:49,357 --> 00:07:51,609
it's actually...

139
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:53,695
it's really nice
to see them again.

140
00:07:55,238 --> 00:07:57,949
- Sweetheart.
- Mom! Hi.

141
00:07:57,991 --> 00:07:59,075
Mm.

142
00:07:59,117 --> 00:08:00,511
- How was your flight?
- Oh, it was a nightmare.

143
00:08:00,535 --> 00:08:02,996
I think we sat on the runway
for 45 minutes,

144
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:05,415
and then there was all the,
you know, Flight 37 stuff.

145
00:08:05,457 --> 00:08:08,835
But a Xanax and a couple
of Pinot Grigio later,

146
00:08:08,877 --> 00:08:10,920
here I am.

147
00:08:10,962 --> 00:08:13,339
Oh, hello. Uh, do you want
a autograph?

148
00:08:13,381 --> 00:08:14,966
H-Honey, give him an autograph.

149
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:17,260
Oh, no, no. We...
I mean, I know her.

150
00:08:17,302 --> 00:08:18,761
- I mean, I don't...
- Yeah.

151
00:08:18,803 --> 00:08:20,156
- We know each other. Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

152
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,598
- Yeah.
- Oh. Do you work at Vought?

153
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,807
No. No, no, no.

154
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:24,559
Mom, this is, this is Hughie.

155
00:08:24,601 --> 00:08:28,188
He's... uh, he's a friend.

156
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:31,858
- Hi.
- Uh, how nice.

157
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,152
Starlight. You hydrating?

158
00:08:34,194 --> 00:08:36,154
Hey, Donna.

159
00:08:36,196 --> 00:08:38,215
- How was your flight?
- Oh, it-it was perfect in every w...

160
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:41,242
You have that "Teen Roundtable"
in about 15, are you ready?

161
00:08:41,284 --> 00:08:42,595
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, she was born ready.

162
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:43,870
I should know, I was there.

163
00:08:43,912 --> 00:08:45,246
Great.

164
00:08:45,288 --> 00:08:48,124
Um, do you want to come?

165
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,460
Uh... You know what?
I'll let you go ahead.

166
00:08:50,502 --> 00:08:52,629
Go, uh, go roundtable
those teens.

167
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,838
- Mm.
- We'll catch up later?

168
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,882
Yeah, sure.

169
00:09:01,971 --> 00:09:03,681
So, Jesus...

170
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:06,017
Jesus said, "Hey, bro."

171
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:08,394
"Hey, bro, bring it in.

172
00:09:08,436 --> 00:09:11,189
"You shouldn't need proof.

173
00:09:11,231 --> 00:09:13,566
"You should just

174
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:15,902
"believe because I say so,

175
00:09:15,944 --> 00:09:17,987
"because you have

176
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:20,073
faith."

177
00:09:20,114 --> 00:09:22,617
"People who have faith,

178
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:25,370
those are my peeps, y'all."
That's what Jesus said.

179
00:09:27,497 --> 00:09:29,415
But I am gonna ask you
one question...

180
00:09:29,457 --> 00:09:31,376
Two twats at every entrance,

181
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:34,379
armed to holy hell. In church.

182
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,797
Well, that's America for you,

183
00:09:35,838 --> 00:09:37,090
isn't it?

184
00:09:37,131 --> 00:09:39,133
And God's watching
from up above.

185
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:40,927
Right there.

186
00:09:40,969 --> 00:09:42,637
Over there.

187
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,805
Yeah.

188
00:09:43,846 --> 00:09:47,350
Security's tighter
than a choir boy's asshole.

189
00:09:47,392 --> 00:09:49,352
So let me ask you something:

190
00:09:49,394 --> 00:09:52,438
Why could Jesus walk on water?

191
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,149
Why does Homelander fly?

192
00:09:56,818 --> 00:10:00,488
How about A-Train, why does he
get to run the way he runs?

193
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:10,623
Or how do I get to hold
the whole world

194
00:10:10,665 --> 00:10:13,543
in my loving embrace?

195
00:10:13,585 --> 00:10:16,713
Why were we chosen?

196
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:19,674
Because of the Lord.

197
00:10:19,716 --> 00:10:23,595
Because we were born
with his power.

198
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:26,055
Because we believe!

199
00:10:29,434 --> 00:10:31,603
- We believe.
- $15,000

200
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:34,147
for an exclusive
VIP experience with Ezekiel.

201
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:35,356
Seriously?

202
00:10:35,398 --> 00:10:38,067
There's not an easier,
cheaper way

203
00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:40,653
for us to get to him?

204
00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:44,032
We ain't getting to Ezekiel.
You are.

205
00:10:44,073 --> 00:10:46,075
- I am?
- Whoa, whoa, wait. What?

206
00:10:46,117 --> 00:10:48,053
- Well, Starlight's one of the headliners, right?
- Wait.

207
00:10:48,077 --> 00:10:49,537
- She'll get you in.
- Whoa.

208
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:52,707
Look, we've only been on, like,
a date and a half, okay?

209
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:54,792
I can't just ask her
for a Diamond Club Pass.

210
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:57,170
What's the matter? You worried

211
00:10:57,211 --> 00:10:59,231
your fake Supe girlfriend's
gonna think you're using her?

212
00:10:59,255 --> 00:11:01,257
Okay, then what?

213
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:03,760
I just go up to Ezekiel,
"Hey, man. What's up with you

214
00:11:03,801 --> 00:11:05,601
smuggling blue dope
into Chinatown basements?"

215
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:07,930
Yeah, pretty much.
Once you show him this.

216
00:11:09,724 --> 00:11:11,517
Jesus.

217
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:15,438
This is from that club
you took me to?

218
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,499
You remembered our first
night together. I'm touched.

219
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:19,984
Okay, why is this the first time
I'm hearing about this plan?

220
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:21,903
This kid needs
to be trained up, Butcher.

221
00:11:21,944 --> 00:11:24,405
Yeah. Yeah, what he said.

222
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:26,282
I-I don't know how
to blackmail anybody.

223
00:11:26,324 --> 00:11:29,118
Hughie, you've done a murder.

224
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,788
Comparatively speaking,
this will be a piece of cake.

225
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:39,545
I know. I know.

226
00:11:39,587 --> 00:11:40,963
We're here today

227
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:42,715
to remember the victims

228
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:45,009
of Trans-Oceanic Flight 37.

229
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:48,930
123 brave souls lost
in an instant,

230
00:11:48,971 --> 00:11:51,474
in a senseless act of violence.

231
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:56,729
Carolyn Kozinsky,

232
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:59,816
a preschool teacher from Skokie.

233
00:11:59,857 --> 00:12:01,984
Dr. Julien Barro,

234
00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:04,779
an esteemed French neurosurgeon.

235
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:12,829
Susan Lopez from Evanston

236
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,248
and her daughter Maya.

237
00:12:19,752 --> 00:12:23,548
Samuel Brown,
a teacher of physics

238
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:25,758
from Los Angeles.

239
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:31,931
We are all truly sorry
for your loss.

240
00:12:35,643 --> 00:12:38,187
Where'd you go?

241
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:40,773
The only thing I hate more
than blubbering people

242
00:12:40,815 --> 00:12:43,735
- are boring speeches.
- Right.

243
00:12:43,776 --> 00:12:45,820
You remember that nutjob

244
00:12:45,862 --> 00:12:48,573
in Albany last year?

245
00:12:48,614 --> 00:12:52,368
Killed his wife,
and he-he came out of the house

246
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,954
with a gun at his
daughter's head.

247
00:12:54,996 --> 00:12:56,372
Remember that?

248
00:12:56,414 --> 00:13:00,001
Cops pissing their pants,
didn't know what to do.

249
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:03,629
And then you, you...

250
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:06,007
you step up, very calmly,

251
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:08,926
ask for the sergeant's Bic pen
and fling it

252
00:13:08,968 --> 00:13:12,722
26 yards,

253
00:13:12,764 --> 00:13:15,433
right into
the asshole's eyeball.

254
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:19,562
- Dead shot, dead shooter.
- What's your point?

255
00:13:19,604 --> 00:13:22,190
My point is that
you took action.

256
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:26,068
That's what I love
about you, Maeve.

257
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:31,991
Look, Maeve, nobody wanted

258
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:35,453
that airplane to go down
the way it did, of course not.

259
00:13:35,495 --> 00:13:39,040
And now...

260
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:41,501
we got to make the best of it.

261
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:43,377
Otherwise...

262
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:48,841
Well, otherwise,
it was all for nothing.

263
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:55,807
What did I tell you
about boring speeches?

264
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:06,859
Mom, when did that happen?

265
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:08,981
What are you talking about?
That's always been there.

266
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,664
I know what you're all thinking,

267
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:23,376
"Holy mackerel, Starlight?
From The Seven? Here with us?"

268
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:25,545
Well, I knew her
when she was still

269
00:14:25,586 --> 00:14:27,088
in pigtails and braces

270
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:28,923
and she'd sit right
where you're sitting.

271
00:14:28,965 --> 00:14:30,132
So don't be shy.

272
00:14:30,174 --> 00:14:31,384
You ask what's on your mind.

273
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:33,135
Starlight is here for you.

274
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:36,305
Yeah?

275
00:14:36,347 --> 00:14:39,475
I have this friend
from my soccer team, Sunji,

276
00:14:39,517 --> 00:14:41,060
she's Hindu.

277
00:14:41,102 --> 00:14:44,814
I know it's kind of
my responsibility, I guess,

278
00:14:44,856 --> 00:14:46,232
to get her to accept Jesus,

279
00:14:46,274 --> 00:14:49,569
but it feels weird to me.

280
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,737
Well, Jesus also says

281
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,198
to love your neighbor.

282
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,200
But if you love your neighbor,

283
00:14:56,242 --> 00:14:58,119
don't you want to save them
from damnation?

284
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,454
You have to look at it
as good news.

285
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:02,665
You have a chance
to help your friend

286
00:15:02,707 --> 00:15:05,543
find eternal life, right?

287
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:07,837
Oh, yes.

288
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:10,172
Have you ever had a boyfriend?

289
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:11,257
Well, yeah.

290
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:13,009
Yeah, I was with Drummer Boy
for a while,

291
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,093
for almost a year.

292
00:15:15,595 --> 00:15:16,846
Yeah?

293
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:20,057
Um...

294
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:22,977
Did you have...

295
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:24,937
sex with him?

296
00:15:27,148 --> 00:15:29,775
Well, I...

297
00:15:31,861 --> 00:15:33,988
you know, I think,
I think everyone hopes

298
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,407
that their first is the one.

299
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:39,368
And... it's private, but...

300
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:46,208
I'm a virgin.

301
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,669
Yeah, I'm...

302
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:53,507
saving myself for my
future husband.

303
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:56,052
See? Hebrews 13:4.

304
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:58,012
"Let the bed be undefiled,

305
00:15:58,054 --> 00:16:00,556
for God will judge
the sexually immoral."

306
00:16:00,598 --> 00:16:02,350
Okay.

307
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:05,895
I think we have time
for a few more.

308
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:07,855
I'm-I'm not really sure what
you're saying, son.

309
00:16:07,897 --> 00:16:10,107
I'm saying if there is some
geezer up there

310
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:11,317
with a big white beard,

311
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:13,110
he's a world heavyweight cunt.

312
00:16:13,152 --> 00:16:15,196
- What?
- I-I'm sorry, did you

313
00:16:15,237 --> 00:16:17,490
just call God a C-word?

314
00:16:17,531 --> 00:16:18,967
Yeah. He's got a hard-on
for mass murder

315
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:21,202
and giving kids cancer,
and his big old answer

316
00:16:21,243 --> 00:16:23,913
to the existential clusterfuck
that is humanity

317
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:26,290
is to nail his own
bleeding son to a plank.

318
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:27,541
That is a cunt move.

319
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,019
Come on, even you got to agree
with me there.

320
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,312
- Hey, hey, hey, please...
- We should lob

321
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:32,147
a fucking nuke at him,
get it over and done with.

322
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:35,633
- You know what I'm saying?
- We're sorry, sir. We apologize. My man...

323
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:37,110
All right.
Good talk. Think about it.

324
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:39,428
- I'm here all day, all right?
- You mind

325
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,781
piping it down
just a little bit? Huh?

326
00:16:40,805 --> 00:16:42,157
Oh, I'm sorry.
Didn't mean to offend

327
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:44,433
your inner black Baptist mum
shouting "Praise the Lord."

328
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:46,060
Fuck you, I'm Episcopalian.

329
00:16:46,102 --> 00:16:47,704
And there's nothing wrong
with having a little church

330
00:16:47,728 --> 00:16:49,271
up in you, you know?

331
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:51,691
Said the bishop to the nun.
What about you, Hughie?

332
00:16:51,732 --> 00:16:54,110
You believe in God?

333
00:16:54,151 --> 00:16:55,361
I mean, I don't know.

334
00:16:55,403 --> 00:16:57,822
- What? Come off it.
- Yeah, I don't know.

335
00:16:57,863 --> 00:16:59,925
I don't think it's Morgan
Freeman up there or anything,

336
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:02,368
but it can't all be
random chaos.

337
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,971
So you think that
what happened to Robert

338
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:05,347
was some kind of
divine intervention?

339
00:17:05,371 --> 00:17:08,082
- Is that what you're saying?
- Come on, Butcher.

340
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,713
Hang about. Hello?

341
00:17:13,754 --> 00:17:15,715
So what were you
supposed to say?

342
00:17:15,756 --> 00:17:18,300
"Yes, I've had premarital sex,
go nuts."

343
00:17:18,342 --> 00:17:22,513
Well, I'm pretty sure I wasn't
supposed to lie to them, Mom.

344
00:17:22,555 --> 00:17:24,306
Aw, baby.

345
00:17:24,348 --> 00:17:27,018
You're Starlight of The Seven.

346
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,770
Millions of kids are looking up
to you now.

347
00:17:29,812 --> 00:17:31,731
You're a shining light to them.

348
00:17:31,772 --> 00:17:33,607
How am I supposed
to live up to that?

349
00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:36,652
Because that's the way
God made you.

350
00:17:36,694 --> 00:17:39,405
You're a miracle.
You're my miracle.

351
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:43,659
Hey... hey, you two.
How's it going?

352
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:45,995
You know what?
I'll, I'll catch up.

353
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:48,289
You sure?
Don't worry, I'll be right there.

354
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,957
Mm-hmm.

355
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:52,293
Keep an eye on the lad,
all right?

356
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:55,379
Where the fuck are you going?

357
00:17:55,421 --> 00:17:57,048
Just do it.

358
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:58,257
Yeah.

359
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:02,261
- You okay?
- Fine.

360
00:18:02,303 --> 00:18:05,681
It's just... this place isn't
what I remember.

361
00:18:08,225 --> 00:18:09,769
Hey...

362
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:21,238
Hughie?

363
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,617
Hey, can I ask you something?

364
00:18:24,658 --> 00:18:27,495
Anything.

365
00:18:27,536 --> 00:18:30,164
Is there any way you could
hook me up with one of those.

366
00:18:30,206 --> 00:18:31,999
Diamond Club Passes?

367
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,001
You know, to-to see Ezekiel?

368
00:18:34,043 --> 00:18:36,629
I mean, I couldn't get one
unless I robbed a bank.

369
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,464
But... you know.

370
00:18:38,506 --> 00:18:40,341
Ezekiel?

371
00:18:40,382 --> 00:18:43,302
Yeah. Yeah. Um, okay.

372
00:18:43,344 --> 00:18:46,597
Confession time. My dad is,
like, Ezekiel's number one fan.

373
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:49,225
Hmm.

374
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:51,560
So what do you think?

375
00:18:51,602 --> 00:18:53,562
Pull a few strings, you know?

376
00:18:53,604 --> 00:18:55,272
Hook me up with some tickets?

377
00:18:58,359 --> 00:19:00,694
Yeah, yeah.

378
00:19:00,736 --> 00:19:03,781
Sure, of course.

379
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:07,827
- It's the least I can do.
- Thank you.

380
00:19:12,957 --> 00:19:16,168
Good to see you!

381
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,797
Thanks, guys. Oh!
How are you, girls?

382
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,382
Hey, pal, how are you?
How are you?

383
00:19:21,423 --> 00:19:23,259
Great, thanks for coming along.

384
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,136
- God bless you guys!
- Thanks!

385
00:19:25,177 --> 00:19:27,805
God bless you one and all!

386
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:31,433
Take care now.
Keep believing, ha-ha.

387
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:32,893
Grab Madelyn.

388
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:34,996
I need to talk to her about
these fucking talking points.

389
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,065
Um... uh...

390
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:40,418
Ms. Stillwell isn't here today.
I thought that you knew that.

391
00:19:40,442 --> 00:19:42,153
But I'm here to help you
with anything,

392
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:44,196
I'll go through the talk...

393
00:19:46,407 --> 00:19:48,075
Ashley?

394
00:19:51,287 --> 00:19:53,622
Where is she?

395
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:06,427
What are you doing here?

396
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:07,428
Skipping work now?

397
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:11,015
I am taking Teddy
to the pediatrician.

398
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:12,308
Maybe reschedule it.

399
00:20:12,349 --> 00:20:14,685
I've already rescheduled
three times.

400
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:16,061
What is the emergency?

401
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:18,147
My speech.

402
00:20:18,189 --> 00:20:19,481
- Your speech?
- Yes. My speech.

403
00:20:19,523 --> 00:20:21,275
It reads like corporate
fucking mayonnaise.

404
00:20:21,317 --> 00:20:25,696
We're talking Believe here.
These are my people.

405
00:20:25,738 --> 00:20:27,823
But you're not just
talking to them.

406
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:30,242
Every dove and Democrat
in Congress

407
00:20:30,284 --> 00:20:32,244
is going to be
watching you on CNN.

408
00:20:32,286 --> 00:20:33,680
- You need to appear moderate...
- No.

409
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:34,955
- Humble.
- No!

410
00:20:34,997 --> 00:20:38,292
You... There is
an opportunity here.

411
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:41,754
People are scared.
They don't trust Washington

412
00:20:41,795 --> 00:20:45,049
or the coastal elite,
and they hate foreigners.

413
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,303
What they want is a little
John Wayne frontier justice.

414
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:52,223
And that is what I do.

415
00:20:55,226 --> 00:21:00,481
Don't forget... it was me that
saved that Flight 37 thing.

416
00:21:00,522 --> 00:21:03,317
I turned that into a win.
For us.

417
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,612
You're really gonna talk to me
about "saving" Flight 37? Ha-ha.

418
00:21:06,654 --> 00:21:09,365
Well, why wouldn't I?

419
00:21:09,406 --> 00:21:12,493
Look, can I please just
talk to you later?

420
00:21:12,534 --> 00:21:13,702
The speech is perfect.

421
00:21:13,744 --> 00:21:15,829
- Trust me.
- Trust you.

422
00:21:15,871 --> 00:21:17,790
Okay.
That's what you always say.

423
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:19,309
- Come here.
- You're not even fucking listening to me.

424
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,459
You're so full of shit!

425
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:22,253
You say you want my input,

426
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:23,337
but you don't.

427
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:25,339
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

428
00:21:25,381 --> 00:21:29,218
- And you never did.
- I do. Can we please just talk later?

429
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:34,515
Why? You gonna run off
and play "strong single mom"?

430
00:21:34,556 --> 00:21:37,559
Please...

431
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:39,937
That baby is an accessory.

432
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:45,025
We need boundaries.

433
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:10,175
Hey, Billy.

434
00:22:12,094 --> 00:22:13,762
Rachel.

435
00:22:18,726 --> 00:22:22,021
Just took a lovely little stroll
around St. John's.

436
00:22:22,062 --> 00:22:25,482
And you'll never guess
what I happened across.

437
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:30,029
Who told you?

438
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,614
Well, I'll tell you who didn't
fucking tell me.

439
00:22:32,656 --> 00:22:34,199
Me own fucking sister-in-law.

440
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:36,577
Would you like some tea?

441
00:22:36,618 --> 00:22:39,288
I got the English stuff.

442
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,043
When'd you do it?

443
00:22:44,084 --> 00:22:47,421
Last Sunday.

444
00:22:47,463 --> 00:22:48,714
We used your last name.

445
00:22:48,756 --> 00:22:50,132
We said "beloved wife."

446
00:22:50,174 --> 00:22:52,301
You buried an empty
fucking coffin?

447
00:22:52,343 --> 00:22:55,554
We didn't bury anything.
Just, um, a headstone.

448
00:22:55,596 --> 00:22:57,324
Well, that's a sick fucking joke
then, isn't it?

449
00:22:57,348 --> 00:23:00,601
And you're wondering why we
didn't tell you.

450
00:23:00,642 --> 00:23:02,728
Look...

451
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:05,522
my mom's getting old.

452
00:23:05,564 --> 00:23:07,566
She just wants a place to talk
to her daughter.

453
00:23:07,608 --> 00:23:09,610
Yeah, well, she's talking
to dirt, isn't she?

454
00:23:09,651 --> 00:23:11,820
- It's something.
- No.

455
00:23:11,862 --> 00:23:13,238
It's fucking nothing.

456
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,033
It's nothing, 'cause there's
nothing fucking down there.

457
00:23:16,075 --> 00:23:18,869
And for all you know, Rebecca's
still out there somewhere,

458
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:20,704
and you put up
a fucking headstone.

459
00:23:20,746 --> 00:23:21,705
Stop!

460
00:23:21,747 --> 00:23:23,999
You need to stop.

461
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:26,919
It has been eight years since
she's been missing.

462
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,423
The cops never found anything.
You never found anything.

463
00:23:31,465 --> 00:23:33,926
She's not alive.

464
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:37,179
She got killed
or she killed herself.

465
00:23:37,221 --> 00:23:38,889
You watch your fucking mouth.

466
00:23:38,931 --> 00:23:43,060
You're not the only one
whose life was ruined.

467
00:23:43,102 --> 00:23:46,271
She is my sister,
and I love her.

468
00:23:46,313 --> 00:23:47,481
But she's gone.

469
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:52,736
We need this to be over.

470
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,335
Ah!

471
00:24:10,921 --> 00:24:12,172
Oh, Popclaw.

472
00:24:12,214 --> 00:24:15,759
You got the right
to remain silent, bitch.

473
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:18,679
I did not kill your partner.

474
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,181
And I did not kill Dr. Robinson.

475
00:24:21,223 --> 00:24:22,307
I wouldn't lie to you.

476
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:24,143
I love you, baby.

477
00:24:24,184 --> 00:24:26,770
Love is just another lie,
Donovan.

478
00:24:26,812 --> 00:24:30,274
- You must think I'm stupid.
- No.

479
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:33,402
But as you can see,

480
00:24:33,444 --> 00:24:36,697
I'm pretty sharp.

481
00:24:36,738 --> 00:24:41,201
Y-Yeah, you've got talent.

482
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,626
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

483
00:24:56,592 --> 00:24:59,219
Oh! Yeah, say it.

484
00:24:59,261 --> 00:25:03,307
You're a filthy pig
who likes to eat ass.

485
00:25:03,348 --> 00:25:07,936
I'm a filthy pig...

486
00:25:09,813 --> 00:25:12,065
Hold up. Easy.

487
00:25:12,107 --> 00:25:14,151
Easy does it.
We ain't here to hurt you.

488
00:25:15,903 --> 00:25:17,196
Who are you?

489
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:32,419
This guy's got 34 addresses

490
00:25:32,461 --> 00:25:35,422
and at least a dozen aliases.

491
00:25:35,464 --> 00:25:37,674
So, who the hell is he?

492
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:40,761
Something we're running down
on our own.

493
00:25:40,802 --> 00:25:43,722
Uh, since when do you guys
run down stuff alone?

494
00:25:43,764 --> 00:25:44,890
- Trevor...
- Yeah?

495
00:25:44,932 --> 00:25:46,350
Shut up.

496
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:57,444
- Excuse me.
- Hughie.

497
00:25:58,695 --> 00:26:00,113
Right?
You're Starlight's friend.

498
00:26:00,155 --> 00:26:01,240
She got you in here.

499
00:26:01,281 --> 00:26:03,700
- Yeah.
- There you go.

500
00:26:03,742 --> 00:26:06,537
Good to meet you, pal.

501
00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:08,956
Good to meet you.

502
00:26:08,997 --> 00:26:11,083
How do you know Starlight?

503
00:26:11,124 --> 00:26:14,753
Uh, you know, we met, um,
like, a few weeks ago, actually.

504
00:26:14,795 --> 00:26:16,630
- Really?
- Yeah.

505
00:26:16,672 --> 00:26:19,925
- And she got you in here?
- Yeah, I guess she did.

506
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:21,885
Oh, this is a
pricey ticket, Hughie.

507
00:26:23,887 --> 00:26:25,847
You must be a special guy.

508
00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:28,016
I... no. No, I'm not...

509
00:26:28,058 --> 00:26:29,685
I just feel lucky
to be here. Really.

510
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:32,145
Um, ladies and gentlemen,

511
00:26:32,187 --> 00:26:34,940
uh, I would like to welcome you
one and all.

512
00:26:34,982 --> 00:26:38,694
And I would very much like to
welcome... Homelander,

513
00:26:38,735 --> 00:26:39,736
our special guest.

514
00:26:45,701 --> 00:26:49,454
So, without further ado,

515
00:26:49,496 --> 00:26:51,707
if you would follow me.

516
00:26:56,503 --> 00:26:57,963
Gather round, everybody.

517
00:26:58,005 --> 00:27:00,632
Now, as many of you
may already know,

518
00:27:00,674 --> 00:27:05,512
Homelander is an ordained
minister in Samaritan's Embrace.

519
00:27:05,554 --> 00:27:11,602
Together, we will be rebaptizing
you, my most loyal followers.

520
00:27:15,272 --> 00:27:17,316
Do you accept the Lord,
our Father, as your Savior,

521
00:27:17,357 --> 00:27:20,611
- and Jesus Christ his son?
- Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

522
00:27:20,652 --> 00:27:23,363
Then I baptize you
in the name of the Father,

523
00:27:23,405 --> 00:27:25,574
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

524
00:27:28,994 --> 00:27:30,954
- Oh!
- Your sins have been purged.

525
00:27:30,996 --> 00:27:34,207
Christ be with you.

526
00:27:34,249 --> 00:27:39,129
On this blessed day,
you will be reborn a Christian.

527
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:42,132
You will be washed clean
of all your sins.

528
00:27:48,722 --> 00:27:50,682
Something wrong, Hughie?

529
00:27:50,724 --> 00:27:55,395
No. No, I'm-I'm
totally comfortable.

530
00:27:55,437 --> 00:27:56,897
Why-why would you ask that?

531
00:27:56,938 --> 00:28:00,776
Well, your blood pressure's
150/90. It's a bit high.

532
00:28:00,817 --> 00:28:03,320
Yeah, sorry. Just, um...

533
00:28:03,362 --> 00:28:04,529
I'm afraid of water.

534
00:28:04,571 --> 00:28:07,991
Don't panic.

535
00:28:08,033 --> 00:28:09,910
I got you.

536
00:28:09,951 --> 00:28:14,039
Do you accept the Lord,
our Father, as your Savior,

537
00:28:14,081 --> 00:28:16,583
and Jesus...

538
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:18,043
as his son?

539
00:28:20,462 --> 00:28:21,963
Yes.

540
00:28:22,005 --> 00:28:26,385
Hmm. Then I baptize you
in the name of the Father,

541
00:28:26,426 --> 00:28:27,678
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

542
00:28:47,364 --> 00:28:49,324
God bless.

543
00:28:49,366 --> 00:28:51,827
Thank you all once again
for allowing me to be a part

544
00:28:51,868 --> 00:28:53,578
of this beautiful occasion.

545
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,331
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Good night.

546
00:28:56,373 --> 00:28:57,749
See you, friend.

547
00:28:57,791 --> 00:28:59,376
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

548
00:28:59,418 --> 00:29:02,963
May the light of God
shine in your lives.

549
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,299
Excuse me, sir.

550
00:29:06,341 --> 00:29:08,093
Uh, may I speak with you
just for a moment?

551
00:29:08,135 --> 00:29:10,896
- Sorry, son, I got a packed schedule.
- All right, I understand, sir,

552
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:12,889
but it's just,
I need your guidance.

553
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:14,391
I need Christ's guidance.

554
00:29:15,434 --> 00:29:16,977
What is it?

555
00:29:17,018 --> 00:29:19,354
Just hold on... one second.

556
00:29:19,396 --> 00:29:20,939
Let me just show you something.

557
00:29:28,697 --> 00:29:31,241
What's wrong?

558
00:29:31,283 --> 00:29:32,284
Uh...

559
00:29:35,746 --> 00:29:36,705
You fucked me.

560
00:29:36,747 --> 00:29:38,832
What?

561
00:29:38,874 --> 00:29:40,292
Yeah, in a private Supe club.

562
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,836
You know the one on East 29th?
Secret Lair,

563
00:29:42,878 --> 00:29:44,522
- I think it's called?
- Don't know it. Nope.

564
00:29:44,546 --> 00:29:46,190
- There were three of us?
- You've got nothing...

565
00:29:46,214 --> 00:29:48,133
- Oiled up, and you...
- This...

566
00:29:48,175 --> 00:29:50,319
wrapped your stretchy arms
around me, and it was, it was

567
00:29:50,343 --> 00:29:54,389
so fucking hot, and...
your dick was so... perfect.

568
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:57,517
And long and... stretchy.

569
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:00,729
And you... you played
my butt like jazz.

570
00:30:00,771 --> 00:30:05,442
With poise and skill and...
willingness to improvise.

571
00:30:17,162 --> 00:30:19,581
You come in here.

572
00:30:19,623 --> 00:30:21,208
You try to talk to me?

573
00:30:21,249 --> 00:30:23,502
Like this?

574
00:30:23,543 --> 00:30:26,296
You are a filthy, filthy liar.

575
00:30:26,338 --> 00:30:28,465
- You are unclean.
- I have a video.

576
00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:30,091
- I have a video.
- What?

577
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:32,677
I have a video
of the three of us...

578
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:34,095
sucking and fucking.

579
00:30:34,137 --> 00:30:36,014
And if you don't let me go,

580
00:30:36,056 --> 00:30:37,766
my friend puts the video online.

581
00:30:37,808 --> 00:30:39,142
Like that.

582
00:30:44,648 --> 00:30:46,375
What do you want?
You want a little bit of money?

583
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,692
Are you here for money?

584
00:30:47,734 --> 00:30:50,153
You ship boxes labeled
as polio vaccine

585
00:30:50,195 --> 00:30:52,364
but they're not really
polio vaccine, are they?

586
00:30:52,405 --> 00:30:54,282
They're Compound V.

587
00:30:56,618 --> 00:30:59,496
- Who the hell are you?
- I want to know everything about 'em.

588
00:30:59,538 --> 00:31:01,915
Okay? You tell me, you tell me
where they're going.

589
00:31:01,957 --> 00:31:04,125
And you tell me
how many boxes you ship.

590
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:05,919
No.

591
00:31:05,961 --> 00:31:07,879
No, they will destroy me.

592
00:31:07,921 --> 00:31:09,631
Who's "they"? Vought?

593
00:31:11,716 --> 00:31:13,885
Here's how this is gonna go.

594
00:31:13,927 --> 00:31:15,762
You're gonna tell me,

595
00:31:15,804 --> 00:31:17,764
or that video...

596
00:31:17,806 --> 00:31:19,432
trends, number one on Twitter.

597
00:31:19,474 --> 00:31:20,934
Tonight.

598
00:31:20,976 --> 00:31:23,395
And you're also gonna stop

599
00:31:23,436 --> 00:31:25,981
the fucking
"pray the gay away" shit.

600
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:29,860
Anyway, it's your choice.

601
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:37,492
Hello?

602
00:31:37,534 --> 00:31:40,662
Hey, um, so that wasn't
a piece of cake.

603
00:31:40,704 --> 00:31:42,122
Hughie, that you? You all right?

604
00:31:42,163 --> 00:31:43,915
Yeah. Yeah, it's me, sorry.

605
00:31:43,957 --> 00:31:46,251
I had to, had to borrow a phone.
Thanks again.

606
00:31:46,293 --> 00:31:48,295
I got baptized.

607
00:31:48,336 --> 00:31:50,797
Yeah. It's a long story.

608
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:53,383
Blackmailing somebody
is not cake, okay?

609
00:31:53,425 --> 00:31:55,969
It is weird, it's scary,
you wind up

610
00:31:56,011 --> 00:31:57,446
- just saying shit.
- Okay, but did you

611
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,656
get him to talk? What'd he say?

612
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,890
Uh, yeah, yeah.

613
00:31:59,931 --> 00:32:01,450
I mean, you-you know
that charity of his?

614
00:32:01,474 --> 00:32:02,976
Samaritan's Embrace?

615
00:32:03,018 --> 00:32:04,436
- Right.
- All right.

616
00:32:04,477 --> 00:32:07,147
So what they do is they take
boxes full of that stuff

617
00:32:07,188 --> 00:32:09,316
and they ship it to hospitals
all across the country.

618
00:32:09,357 --> 00:32:10,734
And apparently the latest one

619
00:32:10,775 --> 00:32:12,736
is going to the NICU
at Mercer Hospital.

620
00:32:12,777 --> 00:32:15,238
It's, uh,
I-it's midtown, I think.

621
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,908
You are a natural, kid.
You're like the fucking...

622
00:32:17,949 --> 00:32:19,451
Rain Man of fucking people over.

623
00:32:19,492 --> 00:32:21,494
Not a compliment.

624
00:32:56,905 --> 00:32:58,907
- Hey!
- Cool your jets, guv.

625
00:32:58,949 --> 00:33:01,785
It's not a hate crime.

626
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:06,122
M.M.? All right.

627
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:10,543
Fucking brilliant.

628
00:33:10,585 --> 00:33:13,171
I'll meet you at the hospital
in half an hour.

629
00:33:14,673 --> 00:33:16,174
Let's hear it for Jesus.

630
00:33:16,216 --> 00:33:18,593
Yes!

631
00:33:18,635 --> 00:33:22,013
One more for the guy upstairs!

632
00:33:23,807 --> 00:33:25,809
Oh, I love you guys.
Let me tell you something.

633
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,519
I am so thrilled to be here.

634
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,187
Truthfully. Are you?

635
00:33:29,229 --> 00:33:30,814
Yeah?

636
00:33:30,855 --> 00:33:34,401
A terrible tragedy
befell our nation this week.

637
00:33:34,442 --> 00:33:36,027
Terrible.

638
00:33:36,069 --> 00:33:38,029
And let's not mince words
about this.

639
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:42,325
We... were... attacked.

640
00:33:43,743 --> 00:33:45,996
America was attacked.

641
00:33:47,998 --> 00:33:49,666
Some people...

642
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:52,711
they want me to come out here

643
00:33:52,752 --> 00:33:55,255
and speak empty platitudes
to you all.

644
00:33:55,296 --> 00:33:57,465
A little bit of corporate talk.

645
00:33:57,507 --> 00:33:59,968
But I don't want to do that.

646
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,845
I can't do that.

647
00:34:01,886 --> 00:34:03,263
You want to know why?

648
00:34:03,304 --> 00:34:04,597
Why?

649
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:08,935
Because I believe
that what God wants me to do

650
00:34:08,977 --> 00:34:11,354
is get on over there,
find the filthy bastards

651
00:34:11,396 --> 00:34:13,857
that masterminded this...
Whatever cave they're in...

652
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:17,235
And introduce them to a little
thing called God's judgment!

653
00:34:17,277 --> 00:34:19,279
That's what I think!

654
00:34:21,614 --> 00:34:23,992
Sounds like
the American thing to do!

655
00:34:24,034 --> 00:34:26,870
Sounds like
the right thing to do.

656
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:29,831
But no. No, no, no, no, no.

657
00:34:29,873 --> 00:34:34,169
Apparently, I got to wait
for Congress to say it's okay.

658
00:34:36,212 --> 00:34:37,547
Right?

659
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:40,717
I say I answer to a higher law.

660
00:34:40,759 --> 00:34:45,221
Wasn't I chosen to save you?

661
00:34:45,263 --> 00:34:48,767
Is it not my God-given purpose

662
00:34:48,808 --> 00:34:51,436
to protect the United States
of America?

663
00:34:56,483 --> 00:34:58,651
Homelander! Homelander!

664
00:34:58,693 --> 00:35:01,404
- Homelander! Homelander!
- Psalm!

665
00:35:01,446 --> 00:35:03,323
58:10!

666
00:35:03,364 --> 00:35:05,825
"The righteous shall rejoice

667
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:08,620
"when he sees the vengeance

668
00:35:08,661 --> 00:35:10,038
"and he will bathe his feet

669
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,793
in the blood of the wicked."

670
00:35:16,377 --> 00:35:18,922
Homelander!

671
00:35:18,963 --> 00:35:22,342
Homelander! Homelander!

672
00:35:25,095 --> 00:35:27,055
Motherfucker.

673
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,530
Hey.

674
00:35:43,571 --> 00:35:45,657
Maeve, what, uh...

675
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:49,911
- Sorry, what are you...?
- I was, um, stopping a mugging

676
00:35:49,953 --> 00:35:52,664
nearby and I...

677
00:35:57,043 --> 00:35:58,419
It's good to see you.

678
00:36:00,713 --> 00:36:03,133
Can I come in?

679
00:36:03,174 --> 00:36:06,177
Uh... okay.

680
00:36:12,267 --> 00:36:14,769
Where's Freckles?

681
00:36:14,811 --> 00:36:17,689
Freckles died two years ago.

682
00:36:19,774 --> 00:36:21,901
Look, uh, I'm kind of busy,

683
00:36:21,943 --> 00:36:24,195
so, um, maybe give me a call,

684
00:36:24,237 --> 00:36:25,738
call first, next time?

685
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,032
Elena, you don't
have to be like this.

686
00:36:28,074 --> 00:36:29,701
Well, you show up out of nowhere

687
00:36:29,742 --> 00:36:31,452
asking about
the goddamn cat, so...

688
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:35,999
You've been drinking.

689
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,959
No.

690
00:36:38,001 --> 00:36:40,086
You're not going
to meetings anymore.

691
00:36:40,128 --> 00:36:41,671
Uh, listen...

692
00:36:41,713 --> 00:36:43,298
Water under the bridge.

693
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,304
I miss you.

694
00:36:49,345 --> 00:36:52,098
You don't get to say that to me.

695
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,017
Leave, please.

696
00:36:54,058 --> 00:36:57,270
Elena, I haven't seen you
in years.

697
00:36:57,312 --> 00:36:58,730
I mean...

698
00:36:58,771 --> 00:37:02,025
- wouldn't it be nice...
- I see you every day.

699
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:03,943
Every time I walk through
Times Square

700
00:37:03,985 --> 00:37:06,487
or turn on the fucking TV.

701
00:37:06,529 --> 00:37:08,448
I'm out of your life.

702
00:37:08,489 --> 00:37:10,074
You never left mine.

703
00:37:15,121 --> 00:37:17,832
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm really sorry.

704
00:37:17,874 --> 00:37:20,877
- I didn't mean...
- I don't want your apology, okay?

705
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:23,129
I want you to get out.

706
00:37:23,171 --> 00:37:25,965
Okay? I want you to go back
to your ivory penthouse

707
00:37:26,007 --> 00:37:29,510
where you can drink
and fuck whoever you want.

708
00:37:29,552 --> 00:37:31,512
Go back to Homelander.

709
00:37:40,772 --> 00:37:42,732
I can't go back.

710
00:37:45,944 --> 00:37:47,737
Oh...

711
00:37:47,779 --> 00:37:50,615
- Oh...
- Maeve?

712
00:37:50,657 --> 00:37:52,242
It's too hard.

713
00:37:54,244 --> 00:37:56,913
- What happened?
- It's just too hard.

714
00:37:56,955 --> 00:37:59,082
Tell me what happened.

715
00:37:59,123 --> 00:38:02,126
I keep thinking about all...

716
00:38:02,168 --> 00:38:04,420
- all those people.
- It's okay. You'll figure it out.

717
00:38:04,462 --> 00:38:06,464
Okay? You'll figure it out.

718
00:38:06,506 --> 00:38:08,466
You always know what to do.

719
00:38:08,508 --> 00:38:10,551
You always know
what to do, okay?

720
00:38:10,593 --> 00:38:14,013
- I don't know. They don't...
- So just tell me what happened.

721
00:38:15,515 --> 00:38:16,933
Tell me what happened.

722
00:38:20,979 --> 00:38:22,563
Uh...

723
00:38:22,605 --> 00:38:24,524
I don't know, Maeve,
if this is...

724
00:38:24,565 --> 00:38:26,567
- Come on.
- No. No, this is...

725
00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:30,446
You're obviously...
No, I said stop it.

726
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:41,416
All right, just...

727
00:38:41,457 --> 00:38:44,377
just talk to me.

728
00:38:44,419 --> 00:38:46,838
Okay? Just tell me
what happened.

729
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:52,844
Yeah, this, um...

730
00:38:52,885 --> 00:38:54,679
this was a mistake.

731
00:38:54,721 --> 00:38:57,348
No, just talk to me.
Just tell me what...

732
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:00,560
If you...

733
00:39:13,614 --> 00:39:15,825
- Allo?
- They're coming.

734
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:16,909
They're on to you, babe.

735
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:18,995
Black Noir was outside
my apartment.

736
00:39:19,037 --> 00:39:21,164
What location?

737
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:23,041
Which addresses do they have?

738
00:39:23,082 --> 00:39:24,375
If they got to my place,

739
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:25,752
all of them.

740
00:39:38,306 --> 00:39:39,640
So, you want to pay me

741
00:39:39,682 --> 00:39:41,684
the professional courtesy
and tell me

742
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:44,395
where the hell
you disappeared to before?

743
00:39:44,437 --> 00:39:46,272
I just had to pop down
to the shop.

744
00:39:46,314 --> 00:39:49,400
I was running a bit low on
mind your own fucking business.

745
00:39:55,615 --> 00:39:57,075
This better be good.

746
00:39:57,116 --> 00:39:58,368
I'm burned.

747
00:39:58,409 --> 00:40:00,119
What? Fucking hell,
Frenchie. How?

748
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:01,454
I don't know.

749
00:40:01,496 --> 00:40:02,830
What about the rest of us?

750
00:40:02,872 --> 00:40:04,874
Your concern for me
is very sweet.

751
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:06,501
Maybe, maybe not.

752
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:08,669
So far, they only seem to be

753
00:40:08,711 --> 00:40:11,255
hitting my places.
I'm taking off.

754
00:40:11,297 --> 00:40:13,508
- What about the girl?
- Fucking leave her.

755
00:40:16,094 --> 00:40:17,637
God knows
what they'll do to her.

756
00:40:17,678 --> 00:40:19,764
Supe-on-Supe violence
ain't our concern, mate.

757
00:40:19,806 --> 00:40:21,307
Butcher.

758
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:23,267
I said fucking leave her.

759
00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:25,186
Merde.

760
00:40:26,396 --> 00:40:27,688
Burnt.

761
00:40:39,909 --> 00:40:44,163
It was the Heartland Beauties
"Luck of the Irish" pageant.

762
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:46,207
The lights went out on stage

763
00:40:46,249 --> 00:40:49,168
and this one lit up the room
with the glow from her hands.

764
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:52,130
The show must go on. Hmm?

765
00:40:52,171 --> 00:40:53,714
That's so sweet.

766
00:40:53,756 --> 00:40:56,175
- 15 minutes, Starlight.
- I'm sorry, could you, could you

767
00:40:56,217 --> 00:40:57,844
just give us one minute, please?

768
00:40:57,885 --> 00:41:00,096
Starlight will begin shortly.

769
00:41:00,138 --> 00:41:01,931
Please go to the main stage.

770
00:41:03,975 --> 00:41:06,936
Mom, I can't do this.

771
00:41:06,978 --> 00:41:08,521
A-Are you sick? What's wrong?

772
00:41:08,563 --> 00:41:10,398
No, it just doesn't feel right.

773
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,733
- What does that mean?
- Honestly...

774
00:41:12,775 --> 00:41:15,319
I really thought that being here
would feel like it used to,

775
00:41:15,361 --> 00:41:16,946
but it doesn't.

776
00:41:16,988 --> 00:41:18,906
It's changed,
or maybe I've changed.

777
00:41:18,948 --> 00:41:20,700
But...

778
00:41:22,702 --> 00:41:26,122
Mom, these past few months...

779
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,919
Mm-mm.

780
00:41:31,961 --> 00:41:35,423
No, tell them I'm not going on.

781
00:41:35,465 --> 00:41:37,091
Honey.

782
00:41:39,093 --> 00:41:41,471
I've waited 23 years for this.

783
00:41:42,513 --> 00:41:44,223
This isn't...

784
00:41:44,265 --> 00:41:45,892
this isn't about you.

785
00:41:45,933 --> 00:41:47,643
Isn't it?

786
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:49,562
I mean, I-I kept your secret,

787
00:41:49,604 --> 00:41:51,814
scrimped by selling houses,

788
00:41:51,856 --> 00:41:54,025
took you to all the Supe events.

789
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,945
Please.

790
00:41:57,987 --> 00:42:00,865
All my friends
are gonna be watching on TV.

791
00:42:00,907 --> 00:42:02,700
Please?

792
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:10,333
They're coming for me,
mon coeur.

793
00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:14,086
The Supes.

794
00:42:14,128 --> 00:42:16,756
I've been ordered to leave you
here for them to find.

795
00:42:16,797 --> 00:42:19,050
And Monsieur Charcuter,
you know,

796
00:42:19,091 --> 00:42:22,261
he knows I'll comply,
that's how he sees me.

797
00:42:22,303 --> 00:42:24,347
Like this mad bastard,

798
00:42:24,388 --> 00:42:26,390
only good for hurting
or killing, you know?

799
00:42:26,432 --> 00:42:28,142
Like a gun, he takes me,

800
00:42:28,184 --> 00:42:31,062
points me in a direction
and fires.

801
00:42:31,103 --> 00:42:33,397
It's not who I am.

802
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:36,734
It's not who you are, either.

803
00:42:36,776 --> 00:42:39,070
We're the same, you and I.
Like eggs.

804
00:42:39,111 --> 00:42:42,031
Hard outside, soft inside...
Or pineapples, perhaps.

805
00:42:43,115 --> 00:42:45,701
Whatever those bastards
got planned for you,

806
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:48,079
you don't deserve it, mon coeur.

807
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:36,210
The Deep finds himself

808
00:43:36,252 --> 00:43:38,838
in hot water following
a harebrained attempt

809
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,757
to free a dolphin
from Oceanland.

810
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:44,051
Insiders say when police
tried to intercept

811
00:43:44,093 --> 00:43:46,220
the hijacked van,
Deep lost control

812
00:43:46,262 --> 00:43:48,431
of the vehicle and crashed,

813
00:43:48,472 --> 00:43:51,309
catapulting the dolphin
through the front windshield

814
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:53,894
onto the road,
where it was run over

815
00:43:53,936 --> 00:43:56,314
- by an 18...
- Hello there, Believe Expo!

816
00:44:01,152 --> 00:44:05,197
I am so honored
to be here tonight.

817
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:07,867
Did you know
that my first public appearance

818
00:44:07,908 --> 00:44:11,412
was right here
on this very stage

819
00:44:11,454 --> 00:44:13,623
with Ezekiel
and the rest of the family?

820
00:44:20,296 --> 00:44:22,965
Today, I wanted
to share with you

821
00:44:23,007 --> 00:44:25,676
how I accepted Christ...

822
00:44:25,718 --> 00:44:28,387
as my personal savior.

823
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:36,187
How His way is the only way...

824
00:44:45,738 --> 00:44:48,032
Uh...

825
00:44:48,074 --> 00:44:49,533
Just...

826
00:44:49,575 --> 00:44:52,620
just please stop the music.

827
00:44:52,662 --> 00:44:54,455
Please stop.

828
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,634
You want me to just suck it up
and do this for you?

829
00:45:07,802 --> 00:45:09,512
Hmm?

830
00:45:09,553 --> 00:45:11,681
You have no idea
what you're really asking.

831
00:45:13,808 --> 00:45:17,895
You have no idea
what I've been through.

832
00:45:24,402 --> 00:45:29,031
Every single word that I say up
here, I'm reading from a script.

833
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:31,409
I didn't write
any of these words.

834
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:33,536
I don't even know
if I believe in them.

835
00:45:33,577 --> 00:45:37,289
I mean, I believe in God,
I love God so much, but...

836
00:45:38,999 --> 00:45:44,588
Honestly, it's...
it's just how goddamn certain

837
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:47,633
everyone is around here.

838
00:45:47,675 --> 00:45:50,177
I mean, tickets start at,
what, 170 bucks,

839
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:54,890
so that these people can tell
you how to get to heaven?

840
00:45:54,932 --> 00:45:57,560
How do they know?
How does anybody know?

841
00:45:57,601 --> 00:46:02,022
When the Bible was written, life
expectancy was 30 years old.

842
00:46:02,064 --> 00:46:06,360
I mean, I'm not so sure you're
supposed to take it literally.

843
00:46:06,402 --> 00:46:09,447
It also says
that it's a sin to eat shrimp.

844
00:46:09,488 --> 00:46:11,907
What, if you're gay
or if you're Gandhi,

845
00:46:11,949 --> 00:46:14,702
you're going to hell? I mean...

846
00:46:14,744 --> 00:46:16,912
And if you have sex
before marriage,

847
00:46:16,954 --> 00:46:19,707
that's, that's not immoral.

848
00:46:19,749 --> 00:46:21,375
That's human.

849
00:46:22,835 --> 00:46:25,004
What's immoral

850
00:46:25,045 --> 00:46:29,175
is the guy who shoved
his dick in my face.

851
00:46:31,385 --> 00:46:33,846
- Shit.
- Shit.

852
00:46:44,982 --> 00:46:46,609
Here's the truth.

853
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:51,280
Anyone who tells you they know
the answers is lying.

854
00:46:51,322 --> 00:46:53,240
And I know, I know,
I'm supposed to be

855
00:46:53,282 --> 00:46:56,368
this hero-idol-symbol-whatever,

856
00:46:56,410 --> 00:47:00,790
but I don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

857
00:47:00,831 --> 00:47:05,669
I'm just as scared and confused
as the rest of you.

858
00:47:05,711 --> 00:47:09,340
I'm done pretending,

859
00:47:09,381 --> 00:47:13,052
and I'm done
taking any more shit.

860
00:47:18,098 --> 00:47:20,142
Thank you.

861
00:47:30,444 --> 00:47:31,862
Excuse me.

862
00:47:44,959 --> 00:47:47,086
Jackpot.

863
00:47:47,127 --> 00:47:50,965
Compound V?
Oh, yeah, and lots of it.

864
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:56,512
Oh, my God.

865
00:48:00,057 --> 00:48:02,142
Jesus.

866
00:48:02,184 --> 00:48:04,311
That's a fucking baby Supe.

867
00:48:09,942 --> 00:48:12,319
Chosen by God, my ass.

868
00:48:12,361 --> 00:48:14,989
These cunts are made
in a fucking lab.

869
00:48:21,203 --> 00:48:23,163
Hey.

870
00:48:23,205 --> 00:48:24,415
Hey, easy.

871
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:28,419
That-that was a great speech.

872
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,379
I mean, come on... I mean,

873
00:48:30,421 --> 00:48:32,214
know your audience,
but that was, like,

874
00:48:32,256 --> 00:48:35,509
that was Joel at the Garden.
That was...

875
00:48:35,551 --> 00:48:39,305
I am so glad you enjoyed it.

876
00:48:39,346 --> 00:48:43,809
I'm so glad. How was your
quality time with Ezekiel? Huh?

877
00:48:43,851 --> 00:48:46,478
Any more VIP tickets
I can get for you?

878
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,899
Because I'm so here for you.

879
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,483
- It's not like that.
- You sure?

880
00:48:51,525 --> 00:48:53,611
'Cause I can get you
a commemorative cup.

881
00:48:53,652 --> 00:48:55,946
Or I can get you
an Ezekiel figurine,

882
00:48:55,988 --> 00:48:59,199
- or a goodie bag.
- My girlfriend died.

883
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:03,037
What?

884
00:49:04,038 --> 00:49:05,456
Happened not too long ago,

885
00:49:05,497 --> 00:49:07,291
and I came here
looking for a way

886
00:49:07,333 --> 00:49:09,585
to get out of the shit
that I'm in right now.

887
00:49:09,627 --> 00:49:13,255
And that wasn't fair to you,
and I'm so sorry.

888
00:49:19,178 --> 00:49:20,930
I really don't think
there's anything

889
00:49:20,971 --> 00:49:24,934
that can help it anymore
or fix it...

890
00:49:24,975 --> 00:49:27,394
or make it better.

891
00:49:29,813 --> 00:49:33,484
And everything I heard here?

892
00:49:33,525 --> 00:49:36,362
Well, that helped
a total of jack shit.

893
00:49:39,657 --> 00:49:41,450
Except for what you said.

894
00:49:41,492 --> 00:49:45,746
I mean, you're right,
there's... nobody knows.

895
00:49:45,788 --> 00:49:47,766
And that's the only fucking
thing I've heard all day

896
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:50,751
that's made any sense at all,

897
00:49:50,793 --> 00:49:53,629
and that is
the God's honest truth.

898
00:50:05,724 --> 00:50:08,310
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no.

899
00:50:08,352 --> 00:50:10,354
I'm sorry.

900
00:50:28,831 --> 00:50:30,517
- Okay, easy with that.
- You get some air in there,

901
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:32,001
you could kill the kid.

902
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:34,086
Well, wouldn't that
be a crying shame?

903
00:50:34,128 --> 00:50:36,463
All right.

904
00:50:36,505 --> 00:50:38,090
Let's bugger off.

905
00:50:38,132 --> 00:50:40,134
All right.

906
00:50:41,927 --> 00:50:43,429
Hey!

907
00:50:51,395 --> 00:50:54,023
Hey, keep them busy.

908
00:51:02,698 --> 00:51:05,159
Watch and learn, son.

909
00:51:16,837 --> 00:51:18,255
Hey.

910
00:51:18,297 --> 00:51:19,798
Hey.

911
00:51:21,759 --> 00:51:25,429
Holy fuck.

912
00:51:25,471 --> 00:51:28,432
That was diabolical.

913
00:51:30,642 --> 00:51:33,937
You little fucking beauty.

914
00:51:39,234 --> 00:51:40,652
You done good, lad.

915
00:51:42,863 --> 00:51:45,449
- Come on, Butcher, it's time to go.
- Yeah.

916
00:51:48,118 --> 00:51:50,079
Now, you keep
your nose clean, sunshine,

917
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,623
or I'll come back and stomp you.

918
00:51:55,209 --> 00:51:58,253
Holy smokes, Starlight shocking
the Christian community

919
00:51:58,295 --> 00:52:00,672
during her address
at Believe Expo,

920
00:52:00,714 --> 00:52:02,508
when she questioned
her faith in...

921
00:52:12,184 --> 00:52:13,560
I see you.

922
00:52:14,937 --> 00:52:16,647
I know you're watching me.

923
00:52:16,688 --> 00:52:19,691
You've been out there
quite a lot lately.

924
00:52:20,943 --> 00:52:23,654
Always watching.

925
00:52:23,695 --> 00:52:26,448
So why don't you
just come on inside?

926
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,035
You afraid of me?

927
00:52:39,795 --> 00:52:41,630
Come in.

928
00:52:53,142 --> 00:52:55,936
Have I not been paying
enough attention to you?

929
00:52:57,187 --> 00:52:59,148
Are you lonely?

930
00:52:59,189 --> 00:53:02,734
It must be hard,
feeling so alone.

931
00:53:05,404 --> 00:53:07,781
I'm sorry...

932
00:53:09,992 --> 00:53:14,788
but you cannot
give a speech like that.

933
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:18,250
You cannot be bad.

934
00:53:49,031 --> 00:53:50,616
Come here.

935
00:54:17,976 --> 00:54:20,479
You have to be good.

936
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,482
And you have to listen to me.

937
00:54:23,523 --> 00:54:27,277
And then we both
can get what we want.

938
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:39,248
That's good.

939
00:54:43,377 --> 00:54:45,379
