00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,132
- At home you behave as if...
- [Screams]

321
00:19:59,222 --> 00:20:00,417
...you'll die without me.

322
00:20:01,582 --> 00:20:03,667
And you're running
this business outside.

323
00:20:06,932 --> 00:20:07,982
I used to see.

324
00:20:08,964 --> 00:20:11,373
I used to see the marks
and scratches on your body.

325
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:14,269
But I am an idiot
for I did nothing.

326
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,829
Don't I satisfy you?

327
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:20,568
[Breathing heavily] Huh?

328
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:24,532
Don't I satisfy you?

329
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:30,452
So what could I do?

330
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:35,284
Die in your memory?

331
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,475
Or go beg on the streets?

332
00:20:41,214 --> 00:20:43,159
Did you leave
behind a treasure for me?

333
00:20:45,213 --> 00:20:46,514
I wasn't getting salary.

334
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,598
My family told me to leave you

335
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:55,250
if I needed any help.

336
00:20:56,282 --> 00:20:58,224
So what should I have done?
Left you?

337
00:20:58,314 --> 00:20:59,249
Tell me.

338
00:21:00,736 --> 00:21:02,384
Yes. I took money.

339
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:05,793
But not for myself.

340
00:21:07,525 --> 00:21:08,739
[Crying] Not for myself.

341
00:21:10,665 --> 00:21:13,317
Do you know how much
the lawyers charge every month?

342
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:17,094
Ever since you've come,
I have told you a thousand times.

343
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,751
Free me from this job.

344
00:21:20,557 --> 00:21:25,025
And you get sloshed every day.

345
00:21:27,415 --> 00:21:28,544
How have I been arranging money

346
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:30,047
for your booze
since the last three months?

347
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:32,504
Have you ever asked?

348
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:38,442
This salary isn't sufficient
even for food.

349
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:45,596
That man will take something
in return for all that help.

350
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:50,562
I don't have money on me.

351
00:21:51,867 --> 00:21:54,487
He is using me.

352
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:32,943
- Hello.
- [Rudra] <i>I will do your job.</i>

353
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:35,888
But now the ransom
will be 2 crores.

354
00:22:37,196 --> 00:22:38,693
I'll take one crore 30 lakhs.

355
00:22:39,502 --> 00:22:40,377
Agree?

356
00:22:42,957 --> 00:22:43,932
Agree.

357
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:52,454
[Rudra] <i>This was the biggest mistake
of my life.</i>

358
00:23:12,646 --> 00:23:15,643
