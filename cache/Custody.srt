1
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:34,751
Yes?

2
00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:36,709
Hello.

3
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:38,334
- I'm going down.
- Me too.

4
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:50,084
CUSTODY

5
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:25,834
I'll read Julien's statement.

6
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:28,792
This hearing was postponed to take it.

7
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,334
A word about his statement.

8
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:35,501
When we send children
to family mediation services

9
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:38,459
- I'll explain if you don't know -

10
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:43,667
we tell them that what they say
will be shared with their parents.

11
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:47,876
If they don't want something shared,
they mustn't say it.

12
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,167
It's a matter of due process.

13
00:02:50,334 --> 00:02:53,084
Everyone must be fully informed.

14
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:58,876
Julien is 11. He's in 6th grade
at Monod Junior High in Saint-Dumont.

15
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:00,292
He said:

16
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:04,209
"My parents separated a year ago.
I live with Mom and my sister.

17
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:07,459
"There's a party
for my sister's 18th birthday.

18
00:03:07,626 --> 00:03:10,209
"We live with Papy and Nana
except my father.

19
00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:13,917
"Mom doesn't help with homework.
I'm a good student.

20
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:17,417
"I have lots of friends
and get by fine."

21
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,709
Where was I?

22
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,251
"...lots of friends and get by fine.

23
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:30,584
"I can't play outside.
We're scared that man will come.

24
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:33,626
"Papy screams. It's not good for him.

25
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:37,042
"When he comes, I worry about Mom.
All he wants

26
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:38,542
"is to harass her."

27
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,626
Listen to what I'm saying.

28
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:43,959
You can speak to your lawyer later.

29
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:49,292
"I worry about Mom.
He wants to hurt her.

30
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:52,209
"He's no father.
I'm glad they're divorcing.

31
00:03:52,376 --> 00:03:56,001
"I can't leave my mom and sister alone."
Bad reason.

32
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:00,584
"Josephine dislikes him
but she's old enough to not see him.

33
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:02,584
"I won't see him either

34
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:05,709
"or be forced to
every other week

35
00:04:05,876 --> 00:04:06,876
"or weekend.

36
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,209
"I won't see him again.
That's all."

37
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:11,126
Counselor, you may speak.

38
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,709
So...

39
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:15,584
Mrs. Besson receives...

40
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:19,126
an unemployment check
of 981 euros a month.

41
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:24,542
She's married to Antoine Besson,
who's in charge of fire safety

42
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:26,501
at Lecorney hospital.

43
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:29,792
He makes 2,200 euros a month.

44
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:31,792
They have two children.

45
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:36,084
Josephine will be 18,
so custody doesn't concern her.

46
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:40,042
But we have to establish
a new life for Julien.

47
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:42,501
It's why we took his statement.

48
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:46,959
We don't agree
with the other side's request.

49
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:52,084
Mr. Besson wants joint custody
once he moves to the area,

50
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,834
now that he was transferred here.

51
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,626
But as we can clearly observe,

52
00:04:57,792 --> 00:05:01,042
the children don't want
to see their father again.

53
00:05:01,626 --> 00:05:03,001
It's true that...

54
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:06,959
Julien expresses this desire
a bit forcefully.

55
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:09,126
He rejects his father.

56
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:13,376
His statement indicates tension
between the spouses,

57
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:16,084
but also extreme insecurity.

58
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:17,667
His own.

59
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:21,209
The case shows
why these children feel unsafe.

60
00:05:21,376 --> 00:05:24,542
I provided
Josephine's medical certificate,

61
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:27,584
which shows the violence
she was subjected to

62
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:28,876
by her father.

63
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:33,959
So we ask that the children
reside permanently with their mother.

64
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,334
Josephine is almost an adult.

65
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:40,417
She can visit her father
as she wishes.

66
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:43,584
But we also ask
the same thing for Julien.

67
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:45,751
Until things calm down

68
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:49,042
and until he wants
to see his father again.

69
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:51,292
All this increases stress.

70
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:55,292
My client withdrew her complaint
to be conciliatory.

71
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:58,876
He threatened her
to make her withdraw it.

72
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:03,126
He'd call, go to her parents' house,
sleep in his car.

73
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:05,001
Do you have proof?

74
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:08,417
Her parents testified that he came...

75
00:06:08,584 --> 00:06:10,667
I mean proof of threats.

76
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:14,834
No witnesses of course.
No messages saved.

77
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:17,042
She changed numbers repeatedly.

78
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:19,751
So, to be conciliatory yet again,

79
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:23,417
my client is not asking for alimony.

80
00:06:24,126 --> 00:06:27,251
However, she is living with her parents.

81
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:31,917
She left everything she owned
personally and jointly

82
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:33,626
in their former home.

83
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:37,376
She must start from scratch.
She has no savings.

84
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:39,584
Yes, she's at her parents',

85
00:06:39,751 --> 00:06:44,917
but she pays rent, helps out
and bears the cost of the children.

86
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:49,042
She has immediate
and essential expenses

87
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,959
to find a place to live.

88
00:06:51,126 --> 00:06:53,251
So she requests an advance

89
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:56,417
of 5,000 euros
on her share of common property.

90
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:02,084
We request that you obligate
her husband to pay this.

91
00:07:03,584 --> 00:07:05,834
Otherwise, we agree

92
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:10,126
to child support
totaling 110 per month, per child.

93
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:13,959
That's all I have on behalf of...

94
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:18,084
both the children and their mother.

95
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:21,084
Your turn, Counselor.

96
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:23,417
Thank you, Your Honor.

97
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:28,209
Julien said certain things
against his father,

98
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:32,792
but much has been read
into his statement.

99
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,042
I don't understand
the point of this hearing.

100
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:39,251
Nothing here is black and white.

101
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:43,542
Education is the responsibility
of both parents.

102
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:46,709
I'm shocked by what I just heard.

103
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:50,917
Mr. Besson was transferred
and requests joint custody

104
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:54,084
only to be accused of harassment,

105
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:57,542
of threats,
of violence against his daughter,

106
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:00,876
with a note from a school nurse
as proof?

107
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:03,376
I find it stupefying

108
00:08:03,542 --> 00:08:06,042
and extremely inappropriate.

109
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:09,751
In my file,
you'll find several affidavits.

110
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:14,584
My client's parents,
also victims of her whims,

111
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:17,709
deprived of their grandkids
since the separation.

112
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:20,751
His colleagues, who describe him

113
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:25,501
as an excellent team leader,
well-balanced, calm, even-tempered.

114
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:29,042
Affidavits from members
of his hunting club,

115
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:35,792
describing him as generous, obliging,
a nature lover who doesn't drink.

116
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:37,709
A normal man,

117
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:40,876
who bears no resemblance

118
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:44,792
to the violent, threatening boor
portrayed here.

119
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:48,292
If Mrs. Besson has proof of threats,

120
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:51,917
let her show them
and the police can investigate.

121
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:55,584
But "harassment" and "threats"
don't describe

122
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:58,834
a hurt father reaching out
to his kids.

123
00:08:59,584 --> 00:09:02,209
And I'm measuring my words.

124
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,626
Mrs. Besson severed all ties
with my client overnight.

125
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:08,501
And since then,

126
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:12,167
she's refused to let him
talk to his children.

127
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:14,709
Her parents' number is now unlisted.

128
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:17,376
Yes, it's true.

129
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:20,834
Mr. Besson did indeed sleep in his car

130
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:24,417
in front of her parents' house.
It's true.

131
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:30,334
Hoping to see his children,
not for the fun of sleeping in a car.

132
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:33,751
I can assure you that Mr. Besson is...

133
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:36,917
astounded to hear what Julien thinks.

134
00:09:37,084 --> 00:09:41,334
His son's words don't reflect
their time together.

135
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:46,042
Given the context,
we can suspect they're someone else's.

136
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:48,917
This is what Mr. Besson says now:

137
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:51,167
"My daughter is an adult.

138
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:54,917
"She'll make up her mind
about seeing me.

139
00:09:55,084 --> 00:09:57,126
"But I won't abandon my son.

140
00:09:57,417 --> 00:10:00,459
"I love him. He loves me.
And he needs me.

141
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,334
"I'm leaving my job,
colleagues, friends.

142
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:06,376
"I'm selling my house to be near my son,

143
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:09,167
"to keep enjoying time together."

144
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:14,792
Mrs. Besson can't take that away.
It's a child's basic right.

145
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:17,959
She claims he wasn't a good husband

146
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:21,251
but it doesn't mean he's a bad father.

147
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:25,501
The law doesn't allow us
to break the father-son bond.

148
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,626
So we still request the same thing.

149
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:31,334
A standard visitation schedule.

150
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:35,334
Every other weekend,
from noon Saturday to Sunday at 6 pm.

151
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,459
And when my client lives in the area,

152
00:10:38,626 --> 00:10:41,167
joint physical custody:

153
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:44,334
every other week and shared vacations.

154
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:46,959
So we need her future address.

155
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:50,709
Unless she leaves on a whim again.

156
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:55,084
This is all to make
Julien's new life easier.

157
00:10:55,251 --> 00:10:59,084
Otherwise, we agree to their request
for child support.

158
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:02,084
But we ask that you rule, Your Honor,

159
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:05,042
on paragraph 7 of article 255:

160
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:08,376
"A spouse may receive an advance

161
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:12,667
on the liquidation of marriage property
if necessary."

162
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:16,334
I'd like to know
if it's necessary or not.

163
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:20,584
One spouse worked full-time
and is now unemployed,

164
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:24,876
but it was her choice
to leave and come here.

165
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:28,709
Each time my client asked
to see his children,

166
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:31,667
he was told
they left for the weekend.

167
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:35,417
She claims she's broke,
just 900 a month,

168
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:39,501
yet takes weekend trips
and plans a big birthday party.

169
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:43,542
The situation
doesn't justify this advance.

170
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:47,084
- Did you provide a balance sheet?
- Yes, Your Honor.

171
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:48,376
All right.

172
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:07,876
Let's begin
with Josephine's medical certificate.

173
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:09,876
What happened?

174
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:12,834
She was in 9th grade.

175
00:12:13,292 --> 00:12:16,542
He kept an eye on her,
wouldn't let her date.

176
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:20,001
He saw her kissing Samuel
at the Conservatory.

177
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:23,626
She plays piano since she's 6.
Samuel is her boyfriend.

178
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:27,792
That day she skipped school
to go see him.

179
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,084
He caught them by surprise.

180
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:34,959
He waited till she got home that night
and he hit her.

181
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:39,709
I was at work and he called,
threatening to break her hands...

182
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:43,167
if I didn't go straight home.
And so...

183
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:46,334
she was in pain, and...

184
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:49,126
The next day she saw the nurse

185
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:52,251
to tell her about the problems at home.

186
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:54,459
All right.

187
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,167
Sir?

188
00:12:56,834 --> 00:13:00,126
She sprained her wrist at the gym.
What can I say?

189
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:03,334
Which of you is the bigger liar?

190
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:10,417
Look at the certificate, Your Honor.
3 years later.

191
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:12,834
"I, Stephanie Bossel,

192
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:17,376
"examined Josephine Besson
on October 12, 2013.

193
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:21,792
"She had pain in the left wrist,
resulting in limited movement.

194
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,959
"Pressure on the scaphoid
and 5th metacarpal

195
00:13:25,126 --> 00:13:28,626
"caused pain and a bruise
on the inside of the wrist.

196
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:31,501
"She mentioned problems
with her father.

197
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:34,751
"After discussion,
she decided not to use this note,

198
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:37,959
"written at her request
and sent by mail."

199
00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:40,626
Mrs. Besson's former boss
also testified

200
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:44,042
that he often spied on her
at her workplace.

201
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:47,042
- Unbelievable!
- Please.

202
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:58,459
Your children have turned against you.
Can you explain?

203
00:13:59,251 --> 00:14:00,417
No.

204
00:14:00,584 --> 00:14:02,292
I'd like to understand.

205
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:04,834
I don't know what they're told.

206
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:30,584
We can see
Julien is not ready to see his father.

207
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:32,292
It's too stressful.

208
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,959
- You make things worse.
- Stop, Counselor.

209
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:38,876
You're the only person
losing your temper.

210
00:14:43,084 --> 00:14:45,459
Mr. Besson bought Julien a phone

211
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:48,959
and yet he still has no contact.

212
00:14:49,126 --> 00:14:50,376
Julien won't answer.

213
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:53,959
He tells Julien to put me on.
Julien stopped answering.

214
00:14:54,917 --> 00:14:56,542
We just want peace.

215
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,584
I just want news of my kids.

216
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:04,126
Who just wants peace?

217
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:05,126
Excuse me?

218
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:07,501
"We just want peace."
Who's "we"?

219
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:10,792
Julien...

220
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:14,501
me, my daughter too.
Ask her, you'll see.

221
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,084
"Ask your daughter".

222
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:20,167
Your children seem to be on your side.
That's unfortunate.

223
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:24,292
Julien asked to give a statement

224
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:27,001
when he learned
his father was moving here.

225
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:29,834
I just want everything to go well.

226
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:31,876
I think of my kids' well-being.

227
00:15:32,334 --> 00:15:33,751
May I speak?

228
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:38,334
Sir?

229
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:41,167
I think of his well-being too.

230
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:46,042
He needs supervision.
Taking away his father won't help.

231
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:02,501
Your lawyers will receive my decision
on May 29th.

232
00:16:03,126 --> 00:16:04,251
Goodbye.

233
00:16:12,126 --> 00:16:13,209
Thank you.

234
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:22,626
Hearings like this are always grueling.

235
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:25,459
I'll call you once I have her decision.

236
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:28,876
I'm confident.
She understands how the children feel...

237
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:34,792
Antoine!

238
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,584
- So?
- What a jerk.

239
00:16:36,751 --> 00:16:38,792
I'll be contacting you.
Goodbye.

240
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,042
It went well.

241
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,417
Miriam!

242
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:46,334
For the kids.

243
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,584
It's up to the judge now.

244
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:52,459
- When will we know?
- A week.

245
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,834
- Go on. She'll kill you.
- I don't care.

246
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:33,417
<i>- I'm at the Conservatory.</i>
- I'm coming, Mom.

247
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:37,376
We got out early so I saw Samuel off.

248
00:17:37,542 --> 00:17:41,084
<i>Stop lying.
Your teacher said you never came.</i>

249
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:45,584
<i>Fifth time in 2 months.
Each time Samuel comes.</i>

250
00:17:45,751 --> 00:17:47,959
<i>Why do I pay for your classes?</i>

251
00:17:48,126 --> 00:17:51,459
- I've had enough.
<i>- I don't trust you anymore.</i>

252
00:17:51,626 --> 00:17:54,417
<i>We'll have a serious discussion,
believe me.</i>

253
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,751
It's over here.

254
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:25,042
Come in...

255
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:29,126
So, there are three bedrooms.

256
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:31,834
About 840 square feet.

257
00:18:32,751 --> 00:18:36,001
This is the foyer.
A separate toilet there.

258
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:40,417
In the foyer, the intercom,
an electricity meter.

259
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:42,209
Separate toilet.

260
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:46,251
Wardrobe, closet... and the living room.

261
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:21,042
This is my room.
I'll have a double bed.

262
00:19:21,209 --> 00:19:22,667
You sleep together?

263
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:25,626
What the hell do you care?

264
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:31,876
Is it him?

265
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:34,584
So?

266
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:37,042
- This is my room.
- Dream on!

267
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,876
Samuel can't come over,
so why a big bed?

268
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:42,376
Just like that man.

269
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:44,292
Don't start up.

270
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:46,042
Auntie?

271
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:49,334
- Who's he?
- Cyril, a colleague at City Hall.

272
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:52,542
He found this apartment for you.

273
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:58,459
- What is it?
- I won't make it.

274
00:19:58,626 --> 00:20:01,251
You'll see him soon.
At your birthday.

275
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:04,626
- She's so unfair.
- You need to concentrate.

276
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:07,001
I promised I'd stop skipping class.

277
00:20:07,626 --> 00:20:08,459
Come on.

278
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:10,167
I don't see myself here.

279
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:14,209
Come on, you'll fix up your room.
It'll be fine.

280
00:20:14,376 --> 00:20:15,376
Come.

281
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:17,417
You can go have a look.

282
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,584
You're only 10 minutes from downtown.

283
00:20:21,751 --> 00:20:24,334
There's a bus station below...

284
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:25,501
Excuse me.

285
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:28,334
- It's available?
- First of the month.

286
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:29,542
Hello, Counselor.

287
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:31,542
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

288
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,334
Yes, Counselor?

289
00:20:45,626 --> 00:20:46,876
Really?

290
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:50,126
Why?

291
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:18,376
<i>Miriam?</i>

292
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:23,209
<i>- What's going on?</i>
- He doesn't feel well. He can't come.

293
00:21:24,542 --> 00:21:25,792
<i>Come out to talk.</i>

294
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:29,084
- He has a stomach ache.
<i>- I'll take him to the doctor.</i>

295
00:21:29,251 --> 00:21:31,792
- But...
<i>- Come give me the address.</i>

296
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,292
I don't want trouble.

297
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,959
<i>No trouble.
The judge ruled, period.</i>

298
00:21:38,876 --> 00:21:40,834
Antoine, he's really sick.

299
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:42,876
<i>Come out and we'll talk.</i>

300
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:46,376
No, I won't come out.

301
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:51,251
<i>I have him this weekend.
If he doesn't come...</i>

302
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:53,292
<i>I'll file a complaint.</i>

303
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:56,167
<i>Am I being clear?</i>

304
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:03,917
What did he say?

305
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:29,376
Bye-bye, Juju.

306
00:23:02,709 --> 00:23:04,084
Hello, sweetie.

307
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:08,792
Hello.

308
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:32,001
So I hear you're sick?

309
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:37,626
Your mom said you were sick.

310
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:41,626
Do you have any medicine?

311
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:50,167
Talk to me.

312
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:21,626
Put on your seatbelt.

313
00:24:30,084 --> 00:24:32,459
- You're a growing boy!
- You barely ate.

314
00:24:33,126 --> 00:24:35,417
We're going hunting early.

315
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:39,251
No, next time.
He's not feeling well.

316
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:42,042
Then there's no use insisting.

317
00:24:42,626 --> 00:24:44,584
Bring us our coffee.

318
00:24:44,834 --> 00:24:47,542
Blandine asked about her wedding again.

319
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:49,542
- When is it?
- Next Saturday.

320
00:24:49,709 --> 00:24:52,959
I don't have Juju.
I can't drive another 600 miles.

321
00:24:53,126 --> 00:24:54,917
Answer her.
So she can plan.

322
00:24:57,501 --> 00:24:59,209
We can switch weekends.

323
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:00,709
You see?

324
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:03,542
She'd love to see you two.

325
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:06,376
I made a surprise for you.

326
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:09,834
Dad?

327
00:25:10,126 --> 00:25:11,876
Let's switch weekends.

328
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:18,626
I'd like to go to Josephine's party
the weekend after.

329
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:24,126
You want to?

330
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:13,709
We have an hour.

331
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:19,917
Because I picked you up an hour late.

332
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,459
Who calls me "that man"?

333
00:27:58,417 --> 00:27:59,667
Me.

334
00:28:03,084 --> 00:28:04,917
Does your mother say it too?

335
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:09,626
No, just me.

336
00:28:12,626 --> 00:28:14,042
And your sister?

337
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:28,626
Want to go to her party?

338
00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:40,501
Why is your mother using you to ask me?

339
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:42,292
She can't ask me?

340
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:47,417
With a normal mom,
we can discuss things, don't you think?

341
00:28:49,334 --> 00:28:51,709
She should ask.
Why doesn't she?

342
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,584
She has no cell phone.

343
00:29:09,084 --> 00:29:10,917
Give me your notebook.

344
00:29:15,042 --> 00:29:16,501
Give it to me.

345
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:20,376
Her number doesn't work.

346
00:29:21,501 --> 00:29:23,334
Give me your notebook.

347
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:30,959
Julien, your notebook.

348
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:08,084
<i>- Hello?</i>
- It's that man.

349
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:12,751
<i>- Is Julien with you?</i>
- Yeah, he's here.

350
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:17,042
He asked to switch weekends
so he can go to the party

351
00:30:17,209 --> 00:30:18,751
in two weeks.

352
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,626
<i>- Where did you get my number?</i>
- Answer me.

353
00:30:23,001 --> 00:30:25,209
<i>It would be nice if he could go.</i>

354
00:30:25,376 --> 00:30:28,709
Don't you think
you should ask me yourself?

355
00:30:28,876 --> 00:30:31,542
<i>- Listen...</i>
- It's not that hard.

356
00:30:32,542 --> 00:30:35,126
<i>Can we switch weekends
so he can go?</i>

357
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:36,501
Please.

358
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:38,834
<i>Please.</i>

359
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:42,667
I'm on my way. We'll discuss it.

360
00:31:41,251 --> 00:31:43,501
Hey, Juju. How are you?

361
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:48,334
- He won't switch weekends.
- He said so?

362
00:31:48,501 --> 00:31:50,417
- Because of his job.
- Fuck!

363
00:31:50,584 --> 00:31:51,417
Asshole!

364
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:52,667
Why is he still there?

365
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:55,126
- Relax!
- Must I go outside?

366
00:31:55,292 --> 00:31:58,251
I forgot my bag. I'll go get it.

367
00:32:12,376 --> 00:32:13,584
She's not home.

368
00:32:27,584 --> 00:32:29,834
<i>You've reached 06 14 87...</i>

369
00:32:34,709 --> 00:32:36,792
Didn't I say she's not normal?

370
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:40,584
- She's not home.
- Where is she?

371
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,501
Can I get my bag?
I forgot it.

372
00:32:46,209 --> 00:32:48,792
You won't go to the party thanks to her.

373
00:32:49,251 --> 00:32:50,251
You'll be with me.

374
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:22,959
<i>Tell me once you've done it.</i>

375
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:28,376
<i>Okay. I love you.</i>

376
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,084
<i>Erase contact "Mom"?</i>

377
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:57,917
Hey sweetie, how are you?

378
00:37:01,376 --> 00:37:03,417
Can you get your mother, please?

379
00:37:04,584 --> 00:37:05,584
Julien?

380
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:20,084
I'll let you go to the party tonight.

381
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:24,459
She needs to tell me
when to drop you off.

382
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:27,292
She's not home.

383
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:30,751
Yes, she is.

384
00:37:31,209 --> 00:37:32,876
She's not home!

385
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:46,376
Then where is she?

386
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:54,292
Where is she?

387
00:37:58,167 --> 00:37:59,167
Where is she?

388
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:01,876
Up your ass!

389
00:38:35,126 --> 00:38:37,751
- Can you help?
- I'm going to drop my bags.

390
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:40,209
Hello, my boy.

391
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:51,876
- How long are you leaving this?
- Until I get the keys.

392
00:38:53,709 --> 00:38:55,667
Your mother made you rabbit.

393
00:39:03,126 --> 00:39:05,001
So where is your apartment?

394
00:39:06,917 --> 00:39:09,834
10 minutes from the new hospital.
It's nice.

395
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:12,251
A balcony, a room for Julien.

396
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:15,584
When does the hospital open?

397
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:20,626
I already told you. September.
And I'll start then.

398
00:39:22,667 --> 00:39:24,751
Will you still come visit?

399
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:39,876
The Dutrieuxs say hi.
We saw them at the wedding.

400
00:39:41,334 --> 00:39:43,126
Are they doing okay?

401
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:47,376
We saw Laetitia too. My God...

402
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:52,376
She won't find a guy like that.

403
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:55,959
Last time we saw her
was two years ago.

404
00:39:57,751 --> 00:39:59,792
Regis' birthday party.

405
00:40:00,334 --> 00:40:02,501
God knows how much she weighs.

406
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,334
She let herself go.

407
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:07,417
She doesn't have an easy life.

408
00:40:08,209 --> 00:40:09,834
She lives all alone.

409
00:40:11,167 --> 00:40:13,251
- No excuse.
- Works nights.

410
00:40:13,417 --> 00:40:16,876
When she gets home,
it must be... 7am.

411
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,167
She said she saw you.

412
00:40:21,334 --> 00:40:24,292
On her way home, with Josephine.

413
00:40:25,126 --> 00:40:27,209
- Where does she live?
- The projects.

414
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:29,167
Why were you there?

415
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:30,751
Remember Laetitia?

416
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:34,501
It wasn't us.

417
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:36,917
You got in a bus.

418
00:40:37,251 --> 00:40:38,584
Why were you there?

419
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:43,292
- What were you doing?
- No big deal.

420
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:45,167
Why where you there?

421
00:40:46,501 --> 00:40:48,709
To see Josephine's friend.

422
00:40:49,626 --> 00:40:51,917
But you got in a bus.

423
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:55,042
We were leaving her place.

424
00:40:55,209 --> 00:40:56,501
To go where?

425
00:40:57,042 --> 00:40:59,584
- Stop, Antoine.
- To go where?

426
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:00,876
School.

427
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,084
- Stop, Antoine.
- Shut up.

428
00:41:03,251 --> 00:41:06,001
You saw her friend before school?

429
00:41:06,917 --> 00:41:08,251
Answer me!

430
00:41:09,001 --> 00:41:10,001
Stop it!

431
00:41:12,292 --> 00:41:14,709
You always have to fuck things up!

432
00:41:14,876 --> 00:41:17,751
Stupid idiot! You spoil everything!

433
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:21,667
It could have been nice.
You make it impossible!

434
00:41:21,834 --> 00:41:24,501
Why must this happen each time?

435
00:41:24,667 --> 00:41:29,084
It's no surprise
that your kids won't see you!

436
00:41:29,376 --> 00:41:30,959
What'll you do now?

437
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:38,001
- What are you doing?
- Get your stuff.

438
00:41:39,626 --> 00:41:42,834
Don't you ever set foot here again!

439
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:45,292
Julien!

440
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:35,626
Are you happy now?

441
00:42:44,626 --> 00:42:46,584
Do you think I'm a fool?

442
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:56,376
You live in the projects?

443
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:58,709
No.

444
00:43:09,376 --> 00:43:11,751
You're as big a liar as your mom.

445
00:43:13,209 --> 00:43:15,667
You're no dumber than before, are you?

446
00:43:17,626 --> 00:43:19,501
Look at me when I talk.

447
00:43:21,001 --> 00:43:22,751
Is it her boyfriend's place?

448
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:31,917
She's holding a bomb
that'll blow up in her face.

449
00:43:34,501 --> 00:43:37,084
She's not allowed to do any of this!

450
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:38,667
Understand?

451
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:44,001
She'll pay for it big-time
if she keeps playing me for a fool!

452
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:47,542
I'm your father!
I need to know where you live!

453
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:52,084
Look at me when I talk!
Look at me!

454
00:43:56,959 --> 00:43:58,334
Where is it?

455
00:44:01,917 --> 00:44:03,417
Straight ahead.

456
00:44:24,459 --> 00:44:25,542
And now?

457
00:44:26,001 --> 00:44:27,376
Straight.

458
00:44:34,542 --> 00:44:35,917
Left.

459
00:44:42,417 --> 00:44:44,001
What floor are you on?

460
00:44:45,334 --> 00:44:46,667
Second.

461
00:44:53,167 --> 00:44:54,376
Right.

462
00:44:58,292 --> 00:44:59,501
Left.

463
00:45:06,834 --> 00:45:08,167
Right.

464
00:45:15,626 --> 00:45:17,292
It's her boyfriend's place?

465
00:45:18,542 --> 00:45:20,251
She has no boyfriend.

466
00:45:32,126 --> 00:45:33,584
Over there.

467
00:45:35,376 --> 00:45:37,459
That one? There?

468
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:41,501
This one?

469
00:45:47,126 --> 00:45:48,459
Give me your keys.

470
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:52,709
Give me your keys.

471
00:46:12,959 --> 00:46:14,542
Come with me.

472
00:46:15,626 --> 00:46:17,501
Leave your bags. Come.

473
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,167
<i>Entrance refused.</i>

474
00:46:37,417 --> 00:46:38,417
Wait!

475
00:46:39,709 --> 00:46:40,709
Stop!

476
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:47,667
Stop!

477
00:48:18,001 --> 00:48:19,251
Come on.

478
00:48:21,626 --> 00:48:23,084
I'm driving you back.

479
00:48:25,584 --> 00:48:28,917
Sweetie, I don't want trouble
every weekend.

480
00:48:31,001 --> 00:48:32,251
Get in!

481
00:48:34,876 --> 00:48:36,417
Come on, get in.

482
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:38,876
Where are we going?

483
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:42,501
Didn't you want to go
to your sister's party?

484
00:49:20,084 --> 00:49:21,751
Can I have my keys?

485
00:50:01,334 --> 00:50:02,917
Can I have my keys?

486
00:50:35,459 --> 00:50:37,292
I just called Laetitia.

487
00:50:39,292 --> 00:50:41,542
She said she saw you here.

488
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:45,001
I don't want you to hit Mom.

489
00:50:53,501 --> 00:50:55,376
I'll find it by myself.

490
00:51:11,209 --> 00:51:12,751
What floor are you on?

491
00:51:14,209 --> 00:51:15,334
Eighth.

492
00:51:21,876 --> 00:51:23,209
Hello, ma'am.

493
00:52:17,042 --> 00:52:18,709
I'm not interrupting?

494
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,501
What do you want?

495
00:53:11,459 --> 00:53:13,459
To see where my kids live.

496
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:22,042
I have to go now.

497
00:54:01,084 --> 00:54:04,126
- Where's my daughter?
- At the reception hall.

498
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:22,292
I've changed.

499
00:55:50,042 --> 00:55:51,626
I've changed.

500
00:56:41,459 --> 00:56:42,959
I have to go.

501
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:13,834
I'll pick him up tomorrow.

502
00:57:15,376 --> 00:57:16,667
No problem.

503
00:57:31,417 --> 00:57:33,459
What time should I come?

504
00:57:34,042 --> 00:57:36,167
We're sleeping at my parents'.

505
00:57:38,584 --> 00:57:39,959
11 o'clock?

506
00:57:40,751 --> 00:57:41,876
All right.

507
00:58:08,834 --> 00:58:10,542
Don't say he came.

508
00:58:10,917 --> 00:58:13,001
Say I bumped into you in town.

509
00:58:35,501 --> 00:58:38,542
- What's that?
- You don't make the law here.

510
00:58:53,292 --> 00:58:54,626
Where's Julien?

511
00:58:59,667 --> 00:59:02,626
At his mom's.
I'll pick him up tomorrow.

512
00:59:04,501 --> 00:59:06,001
Staying for dinner?

513
00:59:13,251 --> 00:59:15,209
It seems I'm not welcome.

514
00:59:22,709 --> 00:59:23,792
Do as you please.

515
00:59:56,792 --> 00:59:59,209
What did you and Josephine decide?

516
01:00:00,626 --> 01:00:03,167
A song before or after the cake?

517
01:00:03,334 --> 01:00:04,501
After.

518
01:00:04,959 --> 01:00:06,542
Can we serve it now?

519
01:00:06,709 --> 01:00:08,542
She wants to wait for Manon.

520
01:00:09,917 --> 01:00:11,292
Where's Manon?

521
01:00:11,792 --> 01:00:14,751
She'll call
when she gets off the highway.

522
01:00:16,876 --> 01:00:19,417
You can't drive 300 miles tonight.

523
01:00:19,709 --> 01:00:21,459
It's fine. I can drive.

524
01:00:21,626 --> 01:00:23,667
You can stay at Nana's.

525
01:00:23,834 --> 01:00:26,834
Don't worry. It's kind of you.

526
01:00:27,001 --> 01:00:29,292
I prefer to drive. I planned on it.

527
01:00:34,084 --> 01:00:36,376
You two can see each other,

528
01:00:36,542 --> 01:00:38,459
but she can't skip classes.

529
01:00:38,834 --> 01:00:41,042
She has to graduate.

530
01:00:41,667 --> 01:00:42,876
You understand?

531
01:00:43,501 --> 01:00:44,959
Yes, of course.

532
01:00:47,042 --> 01:00:48,501
So we'll wait for Manon.

533
01:04:07,251 --> 01:04:08,917
What are you doing, Miriam?

534
01:04:09,084 --> 01:04:10,626
Have you seen Julien?

535
01:04:10,792 --> 01:04:12,542
He must be inside.

536
01:05:26,334 --> 01:05:28,959
Come on,
Josephine is going to sing!

537
01:07:20,626 --> 01:07:23,126
Why are you here?
My dad mustn't see you.

538
01:07:23,292 --> 01:07:25,376
I have a gift for Josephine.

539
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:27,917
I'll give it to her.

540
01:07:28,084 --> 01:07:30,001
I left it in my car.

541
01:07:31,001 --> 01:07:34,042
Give it to her tomorrow
when you get Julien?

542
01:07:34,834 --> 01:07:37,751
Isn't it humiliating enough
for me to be here?

543
01:08:52,001 --> 01:08:53,501
What am I?

544
01:08:57,084 --> 01:08:58,834
What's that stare?

545
01:09:01,292 --> 01:09:02,834
What am I to you?

546
01:09:03,959 --> 01:09:05,334
I can't reach you.

547
01:09:05,501 --> 01:09:08,542
You change numbers.
You run away from me.

548
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:11,042
Who am I for you?

549
01:09:11,209 --> 01:09:13,917
I won't talk about the same old stuff...

550
01:09:14,084 --> 01:09:16,626
You will, because we had two kids!

551
01:09:17,126 --> 01:09:20,417
When you vanish, you hurt me.
You know it.

552
01:09:22,126 --> 01:09:23,292
You need help.

553
01:09:23,501 --> 01:09:26,584
The nerve of you!
You're the one who needs help!

554
01:09:28,709 --> 01:09:29,709
Coming!

555
01:09:29,876 --> 01:09:31,042
Who's he?

556
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,042
My sister's friend.
I'm coming.

557
01:09:34,459 --> 01:09:36,542
Why is he at my daughter's party?

558
01:09:36,709 --> 01:09:38,459
I'll deal with the cake.

559
01:09:39,667 --> 01:09:41,792
Cyril... Nice to meet you.

560
01:09:42,792 --> 01:09:44,626
I'm talking to my wife.

561
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:50,209
- Have a nice evening.
- I'm coming.

562
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:30,959
Give me Josephine's present.

563
01:10:33,626 --> 01:10:35,376
You're such a tease.

564
01:10:36,334 --> 01:10:37,334
Let go of me!

565
01:10:37,501 --> 01:10:38,501
Who is he?

566
01:10:38,876 --> 01:10:40,459
- Who is he?
- Stop it.

567
01:10:40,626 --> 01:10:42,501
Have you fucked him?

568
01:10:42,667 --> 01:10:44,084
- Stop.
- Tell me.

569
01:10:44,251 --> 01:10:45,251
Let go of her!

570
01:10:47,667 --> 01:10:49,209
We're just talking.

571
01:10:50,376 --> 01:10:52,376
Leave her alone! Fuck off!

572
01:10:52,542 --> 01:10:54,042
I'm very calm.

573
01:10:54,417 --> 01:10:55,792
Beat it, prick.

574
01:10:55,959 --> 01:10:58,542
Touch her again and I'll kill you!

575
01:11:01,167 --> 01:11:03,417
- Kiss the kids for me.
- Fuck off!

576
01:11:03,584 --> 01:11:05,126
I'm not talking to you.

577
01:11:05,292 --> 01:11:07,876
Fuck off
or I'll call the cops, asshole!

578
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:21,334
What a loser.

579
01:11:28,209 --> 01:11:31,542
- The prick left. He hit you.
- I'm fine.

580
01:11:31,709 --> 01:11:33,334
- File a complaint.
- What for?

581
01:11:33,501 --> 01:11:36,292
I'll come with you.
This has to end.

582
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:37,876
Come on...

583
01:11:42,417 --> 01:11:44,542
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

584
01:11:53,834 --> 01:11:56,292
Maybe I shouldn't come over tonight.

585
01:11:58,042 --> 01:12:00,917
Hi, ma'am.
What a pain to find this place.

586
01:12:01,459 --> 01:12:03,959
- Hey, Manon. Hungry?
- Starving.

587
01:12:04,126 --> 01:12:06,042
There's plenty to eat.

588
01:12:08,292 --> 01:12:09,917
It's up to you.

589
01:12:52,709 --> 01:12:53,751
My granddaughter!

590
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:01,126
What is it now?

591
01:13:01,292 --> 01:13:03,126
I just don't want to.

592
01:13:04,209 --> 01:13:06,251
Let's say goodbye to your sister.

593
01:13:09,209 --> 01:13:10,542
See you tomorrow.

594
01:13:13,084 --> 01:13:15,292
- Can I drop you off?
- Cyril will.

595
01:13:15,459 --> 01:13:18,167
Julien's staying with you?
Pick you up at 10.

596
01:13:18,334 --> 01:13:19,501
You'll be okay?

597
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:20,917
Goodnight.

598
01:13:23,584 --> 01:13:26,626
- He's not coming to Nana's?
- Not anymore.

599
01:13:26,917 --> 01:13:29,251
Go to sleep. I'll clean up tomorrow.

600
01:13:29,417 --> 01:13:33,209
I'll just straighten up the equipment,
the cables...

601
01:13:33,376 --> 01:13:36,167
- Don't keep Papy up.
- We have a key.

602
01:13:36,334 --> 01:13:38,126
Sleep well, kids.

603
01:13:38,417 --> 01:13:39,751
Goodnight, Mom.

604
01:13:40,292 --> 01:13:41,334
Goodnight.

605
01:13:42,209 --> 01:13:43,417
See you tomorrow.

606
01:16:01,584 --> 01:16:03,834
- Is it him?
- What do you think?

607
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:49,209
- Go to sleep.
- Can I sleep with you?

608
01:16:49,376 --> 01:16:50,542
Come.

609
01:17:32,084 --> 01:17:35,376
When he gets fed up, he'll leave.

610
01:18:21,001 --> 01:18:22,584
Did he leave?

611
01:18:24,459 --> 01:18:25,834
I think so.

612
01:20:09,792 --> 01:20:10,876
Mom...

613
01:20:53,959 --> 01:20:55,959
Our conversation isn't over.

614
01:21:08,042 --> 01:21:09,376
Open up!

615
01:21:14,751 --> 01:21:15,751
Open!

616
01:21:17,126 --> 01:21:18,501
Open the door!

617
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:25,334
B-O-U-H-A-D-D-I.

618
01:21:25,501 --> 01:21:27,876
- Bouhaddi.
<i>- We're on the way.</i>

619
01:21:31,292 --> 01:21:34,167
TN-821 for 71...

620
01:21:37,542 --> 01:21:38,376
<i>Yes?</i>

621
01:21:38,501 --> 01:21:41,126
Saint-Dumont, 9 rue Winston Churchill.

622
01:21:41,292 --> 01:21:43,459
I repeat: Saint-Dumont,

623
01:21:43,626 --> 01:21:45,501
9 rue Winston Churchill.

624
01:21:45,792 --> 01:21:48,334
Someone is forcing open a door.

625
01:21:48,501 --> 01:21:51,542
The neighbor says he has a large weapon,

626
01:21:51,709 --> 01:21:53,376
like a hunting rifle.

627
01:21:53,542 --> 01:21:57,334
It's taking place on the 8th floor.

628
01:21:58,084 --> 01:22:00,876
Use the intercom to enter the building.

629
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:03,501
The name is "Bouhaddi".

630
01:22:03,667 --> 01:22:06,459
Bravo-Oscar-Uniform...

631
01:22:06,626 --> 01:22:07,709
Dad, stop!

632
01:22:07,876 --> 01:22:10,459
Antoine, please stop!

633
01:22:11,209 --> 01:22:13,167
- Open up!
- Antoine, stop!

634
01:22:20,126 --> 01:22:22,292
Mommy, I can't hear anything!

635
01:22:29,751 --> 01:22:31,792
I can't hear anything, Mommy!

636
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:38,876
<i>- What's the emergency?</i>
- He fired!

637
01:22:39,042 --> 01:22:40,584
What's the address?

638
01:22:41,542 --> 01:22:43,042
<i>He'll kill us!</i>

639
01:22:43,209 --> 01:22:44,792
Where are you?

640
01:22:45,501 --> 01:22:46,876
<i>He shot at the door!</i>

641
01:22:47,042 --> 01:22:49,501
I need your address. What address?

642
01:22:49,834 --> 01:22:52,167
- Antoine, stop!
- Open up!

643
01:22:53,417 --> 01:22:54,709
<i>I need your address.</i>

644
01:22:54,876 --> 01:22:57,501
9 rue Winston Churchill.

645
01:22:57,667 --> 01:22:58,917
<i>A car is coming.</i>

646
01:22:59,084 --> 01:23:00,917
Do you know who fired?

647
01:23:01,084 --> 01:23:02,251
My husband.

648
01:23:02,834 --> 01:23:05,251
<i>- You're not alone?</i>
- With my son.

649
01:23:12,834 --> 01:23:13,834
Antoine, stop!

650
01:23:16,209 --> 01:23:17,209
Keep calm.

651
01:23:17,251 --> 01:23:19,334
Do you have a room that locks?

652
01:23:19,917 --> 01:23:20,751
<i>Yes.</i>

653
01:23:20,876 --> 01:23:22,959
Go lock yourselves inside.

654
01:23:23,126 --> 01:23:24,334
Open up!

655
01:23:26,917 --> 01:23:28,751
<i>Help is on the way.</i>

656
01:23:36,959 --> 01:23:38,209
<i>Where are you?</i>

657
01:23:38,376 --> 01:23:39,792
In the bathroom.

658
01:23:39,959 --> 01:23:41,459
Did you lock the door?

659
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:45,584
Can you block the door?

660
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:09,001
He's inside.

661
01:24:09,167 --> 01:24:11,001
Listen to me, ma'am.

662
01:24:11,167 --> 01:24:12,917
Do you have a bathtub?

663
01:24:13,876 --> 01:24:15,834
Lie down in it with your son.

664
01:24:16,001 --> 01:24:17,042
Take cover.

665
01:24:17,209 --> 01:24:19,584
Get inside. Hurry up...

666
01:24:21,209 --> 01:24:22,667
Get down.

667
01:24:23,542 --> 01:24:24,751
More, more.

668
01:24:28,417 --> 01:24:29,917
<i>Stay on the phone.</i>

669
01:24:30,084 --> 01:24:32,001
<i>You're not alone. I'm with you.</i>

670
01:24:40,417 --> 01:24:42,376
I'm with you. Don't worry.

671
01:24:42,542 --> 01:24:43,584
A car is coming.

672
01:24:44,167 --> 01:24:46,584
<i>Just a few seconds. It's almost over.</i>

673
01:25:00,001 --> 01:25:02,709
<i>Stay in the tub. Don't come out.</i>

674
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:32,334
Open up.

675
01:25:43,417 --> 01:25:45,209
Police! Drop your weapon!

676
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:51,917
<i>Stay put. The police are there.</i>

677
01:25:52,667 --> 01:25:55,626
<i>You're in a safe place.
Don't move, okay?</i>

678
01:25:56,459 --> 01:25:58,917
You're under arrest. Calm down!

679
01:25:59,084 --> 01:26:00,126
Don't move!

680
01:26:00,876 --> 01:26:02,126
<i>It's over, ma'am.</i>

681
01:26:05,542 --> 01:26:07,209
<i>Stay on the phone with me.</i>

682
01:26:10,084 --> 01:26:12,209
She's my wife!

683
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:14,584
Don't let them do this to me!

684
01:26:18,209 --> 01:26:20,042
Get him out of here!

685
01:26:34,626 --> 01:26:36,167
It's over, ma'am.

686
01:26:38,792 --> 01:26:39,792
<i>Hear me?</i>

687
01:26:41,334 --> 01:26:42,667
It's over.

688
01:26:45,584 --> 01:26:46,959
It's over.

689
01:26:48,292 --> 01:26:51,417
<i>I'll hang up.
The officer will take care of you.</i>

690
01:26:52,084 --> 01:26:53,084
<i>All right?</i>

691
01:27:21,542 --> 01:27:23,334
Ma'am, can you hear me?

692
01:27:27,834 --> 01:27:29,834
Ma'am, can you hear me?

693
01:27:38,209 --> 01:27:40,126
Can you please open the door?

694
01:27:51,751 --> 01:27:53,834
It's over. You can come out.

695
01:28:21,251 --> 01:28:23,584
Are you okay? Are you wounded?

696
01:28:23,751 --> 01:28:26,001
Call an ambulance. Come...

697
01:29:01,251 --> 01:29:04,626
We've secured the premises.
Two victims.

698
01:29:04,959 --> 01:29:06,417
One is wounded.

699
01:29:06,584 --> 01:29:08,959
Send us an ambulance. Thanks.
