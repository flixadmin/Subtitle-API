00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,535
Skyler, I'm so...

3
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:42,531
Marie. Oh, Christ, Marie. How...?

4
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:47,289
Oh, God. Oh, thank God.

5
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:49,756
Is she beautiful?

6
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:57,558
Yeah, I'm staring at brake lights
on the 40.

7
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,344
Some accident up ahead.

8
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,476
Christ! Today of all days, huh?

9
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:07,646
No, no, no. Let her rest.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

10
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:09,725
Thank you.

11
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,579
Excuse me. Skyler White?

12
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,251
- 307.
- Thank you.

13
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,056
Skyler, I'm so sorry. I'm just...

14
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,930
Are you okay?

15
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,439
Meet your daughter.

16
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,953
Hi there, girl. Hi there, Holly.

17
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,124
Congratulations, Walt.

18
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:13,122
Oh, Ted, I'm sorry,
I didn't see you here.

19
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,915
Oh, Ted drove me here. Thank God.

20
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:20,679
I mean, this little bundle of joy
of ours was practically on rails.

21
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,429
Halfway here I thought
he was gonna have to pull over...

22
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,470
...and deliver her himself.

23
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:31,642
Well, that...
I'm glad it didn't come to that.

24
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,726
Yeah. Thanks, Ted.

25
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,278
No problem at all.

26
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,279
Well, let me get out of your way here
so you two can...

27
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,447
You three can be alone, okay?

28
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,284
Listen, take it easy, Sky.

29
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:49,166
- I really can't begin to thank you.
- Don't think anything of it.

30
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,335
It's my pleasure.
Congratulations again.

31
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:52,957
- Thank you.
- She's beautiful.

32
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,667
Okay. I'll talk to you soon.

33
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,164
Okay. Take care.

34
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,630
Bye.

35
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,683
Are you okay?

36
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,724
- Is everything okay?
- Everything is okay.

37
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:14,357
I just wish you'd been here.

38
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:20,522
- Where's everyone else?
- Downstairs.

39
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,402
Hank and Marie
took Junior for dinner.

40
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,831
He has been such a trouper.
He even changed his first diaper.

41
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,950
- No.
- Yeah.

42
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,539
Did he?

43
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,456
Honey, is there anything
that I can do for you?

44
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,001
- Anything at all?
- Actually, yes.

45
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,794
I left my overnight bag
at home this morning.

46
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,719
I just think you get it in your head,
C-section. You know?

47
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,718
But I'm just so glad,
the way it all worked out.

48
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,268
Doing it natural instead.

49
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,724
It just couldn't have gone any better.

50
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,437
Good.

51
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:03,902
Let me go get your things.

52
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:08,487
And I'll get my stuff too, okay?

53
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,249
- I'll spend the night.
- Okay.

54
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,596
Dad.

55
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,427
I was in the shower, hey.

56
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,510
I overslept.

57
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,470
I'm running late, but I'll be there.

58
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,226
Yeah.

59
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,607
Baby, I gotta go.

60
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,117
Okay.

61
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,467
Somebody broke in.

62
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,255
Okay.

63
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,235
Oh, no. No, no, no!

64
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,776
Come on.

65
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,867
Damn.

66
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,282
Oh, God.

67
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,582
Oh, Christ.

68
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:04,877
This week was tough.

69
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,503
Toughest yet.

70
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,885
You know why?
I knew this day was coming.

71
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,469
- My birthday.
- Your re-birthday?

72
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,675
Yeah. As it got closer, it got worse.

73
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,720
I was scared shitless
I wouldn't make it.

74
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:18,348
I really didn't think I would.

75
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,889
Called in sick three days in a row.

76
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,065
I know my boss was pissed.

77
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:26,278
I guess I don't really care.
I just didn't wanna see anybody.

78
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,603
You guys know how that is.

79
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,734
All it would take is one friend...

80
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,619
...and I'd be out
ripping and running again.

81
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,951
But I made it. I really made it.

82
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,117
I got one year clean to the day.

83
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,811
You look tired.
Your eyes are kind of red.

84
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:06,109
- You getting enough sleep?
- Actually, no.

85
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,820
I'm working on this
really complex new tat.

86
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:12,487
- Yeah?
- A guy wants his whole back done up.

87
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,274
Him on his chopper with, like,
flames all around.

88
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,947
I keep showing him the design,
he keeps asking for changes, like:

89
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,158
"Give me more muscles.
Give me more flames."

90
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,330
And I'm like, "A:
This ain't the Sistine Chapel.

91
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:28,758
And B: I have enough trouble
working around your zits."

92
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,418
I really wish you wouldn't
work at that place.

93
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:33,510
You need to avoid
those type of people.

94
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,676
I know and I do.

95
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,136
It's mostly college kids
and airmen from Kirtland.

96
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,182
It's actually really corporate.

97
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,269
Thank you.

98
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,114
So how's your job?

99
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,199
Oh, you know. Same old, same old.

100
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,699
Doing backup training
on my days off.

101
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:01,697
God, they're hiring anybody now.
I mean, no experience at all. It's scary.

102
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,289
You seeing anyone?

103
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,969
No.

104
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,335
You?

105
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,136
What about that guy next door?

106
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,677
What do you mean?

107
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,217
Well, he seemed to have
some expectation...

108
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,014
...of you introducing me to him.

109
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,306
He knows you own the place.

110
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,149
Yeah.

111
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,682
Dad, he's our tenant.

112
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,725
End of story.

113
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,855
Why would I get involved
with a tenant?

114
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,981
Okay.

115
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,743
There you go.

116
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,083
Oh, yes.

117
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,375
Oh, isn't she beautiful?

118
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:55,084
I just think she's the most
beautiful baby ever.

119
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:57,676
Yeah. And why not?

120
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,633
Good stock.

121
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,103
I'll get it.

122
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:05,593
Yeah. Yeah.

123
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,601
Hello. Hello?

124
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:11,985
Nobody's there.

125
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,773
Oh, well.

126
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,574
Beat you.

127
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,118
- Hello.
- Hey, man.

128
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,787
Oh, hi, Carmen.

129
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,529
Just Carmen.

130
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:27,367
- Come on. Hurry up.
- So you heard, huh? Yes, yes.

131
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,958
Good news.
Oh, she's just so beautiful.

132
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,548
Well, Holly.

133
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,585
Seven pounds, 3 ounces.

134
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,339
Everybody is doing just fine.

135
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,306
You junkie imbecile.
What are you calling this number for?

136
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:42,638
I am trying to tell you, man.

137
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,769
Last night,
somebody broke in my place, yo.

138
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,438
- I got robbed.
- What?

139
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:52,144
Yeah. Somebody,
they got all of our stuff. Okay?

140
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:54,069
All of it.

141
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,273
You get me, Mr. White?

142
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,568
The blue stuff. It's, like, uncanny.

143
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,992
They knew exactly where to look.

144
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:06,824
I mean, say something, man, all right?
Yell at me or something! Come on!

145
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,328
Mr. White.

146
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:12,957
God!

147
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,626
Oh, no.

148
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:21,838
Okay. Okay. Okay.

149
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,149
Hank, come on.
People are starving to death out here.

150
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,398
All right. I just had to get a beer.

151
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,152
Finally.

152
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,940
All right, guys. Here we go.

153
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,939
We got mild, medium
and muy caliente.

154
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,367
I got dibs on the breast.

155
00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:46,698
- Los Pollos Hermanos?
- Oh, yeah, seriously. You gotta try it.

156
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:50,201
I think this joint gives KFC
a run for their money.

157
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,454
That baby is hungry.

158
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,046
Give me that baby.

159
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:56,379
Oh, sweetie, yes.

160
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:58,216
Do you have any coleslaw in there?

161
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,051
Oh, no, no, no. Come on. Jeez, Sky.

162
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:04,547
- Not at the table. We're eating.
- Hank, it's only a breast.

163
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,851
- It's my sister-in-law's breast.
- Oh, you are so provincial.

164
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,472
Hank, remember the day...

165
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,978
...when you were talking to me
about childproofing?

166
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,223
Yeah.

167
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:16,898
Yeah, yeah. What are you thinking?
A fence or a cover?

168
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:20,861
Yeah. No, well, actually, I was
thinking more of an alarm system.

169
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:25,024
They've got these new systems that
are now sonar systems that would...

170
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,452
Anything falls into it,
it sets the alarm off.

171
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:28,660
Oh, nice.

172
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:31,709
- Wow, that sounds expensive.
- Well, yeah.

173
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,581
- But for the baby, I mean...
- Well, why don't...

174
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,756
Why don't you let Marie and I
get that for you?

175
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,376
- Absolutely.
- No, no. Thank you.

176
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:45,087
No, no, please.
I'll be back at work soon.

177
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:46,967
We'll take care of it.

178
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,058
Back at work soon?

179
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:51,810
Since you're scheduled
for surgery...

180
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:56,269
...I just thought it might be a good
idea to have some money coming in.

181
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:02,980
Well, Skyler, we need to think
about what's best for the baby.

182
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,280
And I think having her mother around
for at least the first few years...

183
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:12,541
Money-wise, we'll manage.
I promise you that.

184
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:16,369
What? You guys got, like, a printing
press in the garage churning out 50s?

185
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:17,619
I wish.

186
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,832
Mom's even talking
about me getting a job.

187
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,633
That's right. Everybody pitches in.

188
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,087
Why don't we ever get Chinese?

189
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,398
I'll get her.

190
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,650
I'll get her.

191
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,490
Yes. Good girl.

192
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:53,031
That's a good girl.

193
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,492
My little girl, huh?

194
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,924
Hey, do you wanna see something?

195
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,805
Come here.

196
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,810
Oh, I know, I know.

197
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,862
Yeah.

198
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,037
Hey.

199
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,868
You wanna see what
your daddy did for you?

200
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:38,871
Let me show you.

201
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,919
Here. Come here.

202
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,004
Wanna see?

203
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:03,277
That's right. Daddy did that.

204
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,610
Daddy did that for you.

205
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:25,590
This place looks exactly the same.

206
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:29,134
Why don't you have computers
and shit? It's the 20th century.

207
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,840
What the hell are you doing here?

208
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,049
- Get out.
- No. You took the stash.

209
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,224
I heard all those messages,
figured it out.

210
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,389
You figured it out, huh?
Well, congratulations, Einstein.

211
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:42,354
You left me to freak out all day long
like I dropped the ball or something...

212
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:46,102
- ...and you were the one who took it!
- Shut up.

213
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,939
You lower your voice.

214
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:55,785
"Like you dropped the ball"?

215
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:59,746
When have you ever
not dropped the ball, Jesse?

216
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,451
Blasted out of your mind
on whatever the hell that was.

217
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:05,874
What was that, heroin?

218
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:08,922
Jesus.

219
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:11,800
I was on my day off, man.
What I do on my day off...

220
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,302
"Day off"?
We were on call, you junkie.

221
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,592
On call for the biggest deal
of our lives.

222
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,179
I just managed to pull it off by the
skin of my teeth, no thanks to you.

223
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:24,477
And you made me miss
the birth of my daughter.

224
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:28,190
Son of a bitch.

225
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,398
How much?

226
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:37,367
- How much what?
- How much did you get for the deal?

227
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,957
One-point-two million.

228
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,587
Six hundred thousand each.

229
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,589
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

230
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,338
Saul's cut is 20 percent.

231
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:54,219
All right.
So where's my money?

232
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:56,926
What?

233
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,011
You are joking, right?

234
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:05,098
If I gave you that money...

235
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:07,475
...you would be dead
inside of a week.

236
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:12,275
Man, look, I'm off the heroin.

237
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:15,860
I didn't even like it anyway.
It made me sick.

238
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,987
And the... And the meth.

239
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:21,539
You know, I could take it or leave it.

240
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,323
I'm clean, Mr. White.

241
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:26,122
For real.

242
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,554
Prove it. Pee in that.

243
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,604
- How gay are you, seriously?
- Pee in it.

244
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:46,139
They're selling testing kits
at the drugstores.

245
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:49,692
If you are clean,
I will give you every last dime.

246
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,186
No, huh?

247
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:55,903
Well, I guess, until then
you'll just have to depend...

248
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:59,072
...on the kindness of strangers
to get high.

249
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:02,075
That and your little junkie girlfriend.

250
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,437
Not on her tummy, Walt.

251
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:34,405
I'm not putting her on her tummy.

252
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:37,236
I'll put her on her side.
Do you wanna hold her back?

253
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,194
- Yeah.
- Right there.

254
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,902
Just in case she decides
to do a little spit-up...

255
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:46,867
...I'm gonna roll up a nice clean towel
like this and put it under.

256
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,161
Hammacher Schlemmer
makes a proper one of those.

257
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,788
- It's hypoallergenic.
- Oh, yeah?

258
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:55,300
Well, I think a towel will do.

259
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:00,889
Skyler, what is it?

260
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:06,139
Your son. He is just unbelievable.
Come see what he did.

261
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:15,565
- I told you it's not ready yet.
- Honey, just show it to them.

262
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,541
My God, son. That's wonderful.

263
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,172
Flynn.

264
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:41,760
This is beautiful.

265
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:45,345
SaveWalterWhite.com.

266
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,766
Well, I, for one,
am telling everybody.

267
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:54,266
Wait a minute. You're not asking
for money, are you, son?

268
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:56,443
Yeah. That's the whole idea.

269
00:19:56,655 --> 00:19:59,775
Louis helped me set up
a PayPal account and everything.

270
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:03,779
- See?
- But we can't ask for money.

271
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:06,909
Walt.

272
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,078
Okay.

273
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:14,331
I appreciate it. I really do.

274
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,046
Show me what else you put on.

275
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:23,175
This was all his idea.
He worked so hard on it.

276
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,383
- Just let him help.
- Skyler.

277
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:29,468
It's... You can't ask him
to take it down.

278
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:33,602
- It'll crush him.
- Skyler, it's charity.

279
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:40,903
Why do you say that
like it's some sort of dirty word?

280
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,583
This is insane.

281
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,917
I have so much cash on hand...

282
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,001
...that I actually count it
by weighing it on my bathroom scale.

283
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:01,586
And yet, I can't spend it.
I can't tell my family about it.

284
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:04,639
All of whom think that I am
right on the edge of bankruptcy.

285
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,342
I mean, it's...

286
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:08,173
It's insane.

287
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:11,433
Well, I guess that's why
gangsters had molls.

288
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,220
What?

289
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:14,929
Gun molls.

290
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,107
Haven't you ever seen White Heat?

291
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:19,772
Yeah, I've seen White Heat...

292
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:22,906
- ...but I don't see how that pertains.
- Maybe you need a moll...

293
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,786
...more than a wife
who you can't trust with your secrets.

294
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,536
- Just...
- What good is money...

295
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:30,284
...that doesn't spend?
The tree falls in the forest...

296
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:34,034
You know, you get the point.
So communicating is out?

297
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:36,617
Out.

298
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,214
Let's see. What else is there?

299
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:40,712
There's always,
"Hey, I found a big bag of money...

300
00:21:40,926 --> 00:21:42,669
...down by the rail road tracks."

301
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,424
No? No? Works for me.

302
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,421
Uncle Murray.

303
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:49,720
Oh, yeah.

304
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,435
Yeah,
"Oh, many is the happy memory...

305
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,555
...of Uncle Murray
bouncing me on his knee.

306
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:57,442
We lost track of
the old pervert years ago...

307
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,854
- ...but he kicked it, left me millions."
- No, no.

308
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:06,314
It cannot be blind luck or some
imaginary relative who saves us.

309
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:09,073
No, I earned that money, me.

310
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:11,781
And now my son created
his own website...

311
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:15,996
...SaveWalterWhite.com,
soliciting anonymous donations.

312
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:19,876
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

313
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:27,171
Yeah, look at that.
It's got PayPal and everything.

314
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:30,675
Cyber-begging. That's all that is.

315
00:22:30,893 --> 00:22:34,012
Just rattling a little tin cup
to the entire world.

316
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,803
Yeah, there's no deep-seated
issues there.

317
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:40,190
Walter, I'm looking at the answer here.
It's staring me in the face.

318
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:43,189
- Do I have to spell it out for you?
- I know. I know.

319
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:45,694
You're thinking that I should be
funneling money...

320
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:48,031
...into my son's website,
but absolutely not.

321
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:50,865
I am not going to have
my family think that some...

322
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:53,238
...mystery benefactor saved us.

323
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:56,411
Not some mystery benefactor,
singular.

324
00:22:56,627 --> 00:22:58,952
That would raise too many questions.
However...

325
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:01,210
Stay with me here.

326
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:02,965
...zombies.

327
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:07,962
I got a guy, who knows this guy,
who knows this Rain Man-type.

328
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,549
He lives with his mother
in her basement in Belarus, all right?

329
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:14,684
So good luck extraditing
his fat Russian ass.

330
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:18,311
Wait. He's a hacker-cracker
extraordinaire.

331
00:23:18,524 --> 00:23:21,145
This guy can hijack
random desktops...

332
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,025
...all around the world, turn them
into zombies that do his bidding.

333
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:29,699
For instance, he can make it
so 20- or 30,000...

334
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,243
...little donations come in
from all over the U.S. and Canada.

335
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:35,495
Ten, 20, 50 bucks a pop...

336
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:38,957
...all paid in full, nice and neat,
untraceable...

337
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:43,084
...from the good-hearted people
of the world to Mr. Walter H. White...

338
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,421
...cancer saint.

339
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:49,299
I'm getting a warm and fuzzy feeling
just thinking about it.

340
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:57,766
He's an asshole, that's what.
Always judging me.

341
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:00,273
Not too much.

342
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:02,938
I mean, like, who is he, right?

343
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,856
I mean, first off, I taught him.

344
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:09,107
Always acting like
I'm his indentured servant.

345
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:21,710
Now the cotton.

346
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:28,624
Needle?

347
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:33,966
- I don't understand why you need him.
- Exactly.

348
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:38,808
My point exactly.

349
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:51,320
Flat against your skin
so it doesn't wiggle around too much.

350
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,286
How much does he owe you, anyway?

351
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,992
Four hundred and eighty.

352
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:05,538
Oh, hell, I'd be mad too
if somebody owed me 500 bucks.

353
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:07,962
No, no.

354
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:10,508
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

355
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:13,508
What?

356
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,010
What?

357
00:25:17,518 --> 00:25:19,261
Thousand.

358
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:23,188
Not on your back,
in case you throw up.

359
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:26,684
On your side. Sleep on your side.

360
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:38,110
And she's all like:

361
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,865
"Don't preach to me." And I'm like,
"Baby, I'm not preaching to you.

362
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:44,753
I'm talking about basic survival,
you know?

363
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:47,797
I'm conversing
about life and death."

364
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:50,711
I mean, this here,
what we've been doing...

365
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:52,965
...hell, Becky knows.

366
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,178
Dad?

367
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:02,552
I overslept. I'm on my way.

368
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:18,411
Dad?

369
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:21,410
Dad, wait.

370
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:24,079
Dad, it's not what it looks like.

371
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:26,419
Dad.

372
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:30,959
Dad, will just wait? Let me...
Just talk to you for one second.

373
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:32,254
No, Dad.

374
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:34,756
Dad, come on.

375
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,765
Dad?

376
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:44,269
Dad, no. No, stop it!
Don't touch him, Dad!

377
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,805
- Dad, stop. Dad, let him go!
- Son of a bitch.

378
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:51,602
Dad, no. Stop it!
Stop it, Dad! Stop it!

379
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,655
- Get away from me, man. Back off.
- Jesse.

380
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:55,896
- Jesse, no!
- Back off!

381
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:58,821
- Okay, everybody just calm down!
- What's with you, yo?

382
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:02,321
- Because I'll seriously bust you up.
- You miserable little smackhead.

383
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:04,615
- Get the hell out!
- Hey, I pay my rent, bitch!

384
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,292
All right? I got civil rights.

385
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:08,246
Dad, no! Okay!

386
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:10,953
Jesse, come on.
Please, no. Come on.

387
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,962
I pay my rent.

388
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:18,127
You're going back to rehab.
Today. Now.

389
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:20,719
Look, as it so happens,
we were just...

390
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:22,557
We were just talking
about that now.

391
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:24,974
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I was gonna tell you, okay?

392
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:27,642
- If you would just let me.
- Eighteen months.

393
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:31,272
You have been clean for 18 months,
Jane. Why? Why do you do it?

394
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:34,653
I backslid, okay?

395
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:36,602
Like, what?

396
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:38,816
What, you think I'm proud of this?

397
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:40,861
Like I do it on purpose?

398
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:42,489
Lying to me...

399
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:45,658
...shacking up and using
with this scumbag, this loser.

400
00:27:45,874 --> 00:27:47,037
It takes one to know one.

401
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:50,168
His name is Jesse. You don't know
the first thing about him.

402
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:53,000
We talk about rehab every night.
It's his idea.

403
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:56,085
You talk about rehab?
Well, gee, isn't that wonderful?

404
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:01,179
Thank you for not being judgmental
24 hours a day.

405
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:05,257
Because that's exactly what I need,
to be judged all the time!

406
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:08,344
Okay.

407
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:10,889
You know what you need?
I'll tell you what you need.

408
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:12,139
What are you doing?

409
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,980
- What are you doing?
- I am calling the police.

410
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:18,981
- Dad. Dad, no, don't.
- Come on. Come on!

411
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:21,239
- Dad, no. Don't.
- I have tried 10 years...

412
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:22,946
...of love and understanding.

413
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:26,281
Maybe what it takes
is you drying out in a jail cell.

414
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:27,873
Dad, no.

415
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:31,452
Yes, I would like to report drug use
in a building that I own.

416
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,920
- Dad. Daddy, no.
- No. It's ongoing. It's illegal activity.

417
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:36,875
- I'd like to talk to somebody.
- Daddy.

418
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,713
- Would you connect me, please?
- Fine, we'll go to rehab.

419
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:41,968
I could care less
about him going to rehab.

420
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:44,588
- I want you in rehab.
- I'll go first thing tomorrow.

421
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,516
Not tomorrow. Today.

422
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:49,977
I have to call into work.
I have to stop the newspaper.

423
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:54,138
The last time I went, my houseplants
died because you didn't water them.

424
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:59,731
Daddy, please?

425
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,146
I'll go.

426
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:03,904
Albuquerque Police.
How may I direct your call?

427
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:06,406
Tomorrow.

428
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,284
Hello?

429
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:12,120
Hello?

430
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:14,086
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

431
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:20,749
Tomorrow.

432
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:41,106
You meant all that?

433
00:29:42,908 --> 00:29:44,486
I don't know.

434
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:48,115
I just think
if we had enough money...

435
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:51,619
...nobody could make us
do anything.

436
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:22,482
Oh, just let it ring.

437
00:30:22,698 --> 00:30:25,153
No, I'm gonna go see who it is.

438
00:30:27,286 --> 00:30:29,077
It's okay, Holly.

439
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:31,494
It's okay, sweetie.

440
00:30:32,207 --> 00:30:33,405
Good luck with that.

441
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:37,160
But I'm sure he'd be glad to,
you know, write some...

442
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:42,088
You know, actually, here he is
right now. So hold on a second.

443
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:44,419
- What?
- It's one of your...

444
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:48,634
One of your old students
wants a letter of recommendation.

445
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:52,183
Oh, okay. Thanks.

446
00:30:52,394 --> 00:30:55,514
Oh, honey,
I think the baby is getting hungry.

447
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,940
- This is Walter White.
- Hello, Walter White.

448
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:06,522
I'm sorry.
I'm having a little trouble recalling...

449
00:31:06,742 --> 00:31:08,236
It's Jane.

450
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:10,361
You know, of Jesse and Jane.

451
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:11,824
Jesse's "junkie girlfriend."

452
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:17,080
Oh, yes, yes. Of course.
It really has been a long time.

453
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:18,836
Get somewhere where you can talk.

454
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:23,708
Sure. Yes.
I am looking into that as we speak.

455
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,720
How the hell did you get this number?
Did Jesse give it to you?

456
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:32,683
All Jesse wants
is what's coming to him.

457
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:34,387
No more, no less.

458
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:36,062
What are you talking about?

459
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:37,896
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

460
00:31:41,944 --> 00:31:45,692
- He told you about the money.
- He told me everything.

461
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:52,911
So, what is this?

462
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:56,746
What, some kind of blackmail
or something?

463
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:58,916
This is me telling you
to do right by Jesse.

464
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:00,586
Bring him what you owe him.

465
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:02,207
I don't call that blackmail.

466
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:05,589
I call that you getting off your ass,
and being a decent human being.

467
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:07,343
Well, I call it blackmail.

468
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:11,301
Dialing my number.
Talking to my wife.

469
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:13,558
And what's your end of this?

470
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:17,101
How much heroin
does a half a million dollars buy?

471
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:21,275
For your information,
I am holding Jesse's money for him...

472
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:23,606
...and he will receive
every last dollar of it.

473
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:25,278
He will, not you...

474
00:32:25,487 --> 00:32:27,112
...at a time when I see fit.

475
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:29,778
But I will not contribute
to his overdose.

476
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:32,692
Now you tell him, if he gets clean...

477
00:32:32,911 --> 00:32:34,904
- if you both get clean...
- You know what?

478
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:36,782
I take that back. This is blackmail.

479
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:39,371
Because what I know about you,
high-school teacher...

480
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:42,206
...turned drug dealer,
with a brother-in-law in the DEA...

481
00:32:42,421 --> 00:32:45,624
...that would make one hell of a story.
National news, I'll bet.

482
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:51,591
Do right by Jesse tonight
or I will burn you to the ground.

483
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:00,678
Shit.

484
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:07,319
He's a high-school teacher. What's
he gonna do, give you a B-minus?

485
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:10,151
Send you outside
to clap the erasers?

486
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:16,113
You wouldn't really go to the cops,
would you?

487
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:18,495
We won't have to. He'll pay.

488
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,078
And what if he doesn't?

489
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:23,167
Jesse, it's your money.

490
00:33:23,378 --> 00:33:27,839
You're in the right here. He's in
the wrong. He's not stupid. He'll pay.

491
00:33:32,387 --> 00:33:34,179
What is it, really?

492
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:36,762
You don't want
your half a million dollars?

493
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:40,510
You wanna renounce your earthly
possessions and become a monk?

494
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:46,229
No, it's just,
I'm not the kind of dude who rolls.

495
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:49,693
And by extension, you know,
neither are you.

496
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,694
I mean, he's my partner.

497
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,659
I'm your partner.

498
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:13,044
The largest land animal
in all the planet...

499
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:15,931
...lives in a tightly knit
matriarchal society...

500
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,216
...led by the eldest female
in the herd.

501
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:23,222
Close your eyes and go to sleep.

502
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:19,530
She is finally asleep.

503
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:27,122
What you doing,
learning about elephants?

504
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:42,140
Oh, honey, we're out of diapers.
Would you mind going out?

505
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:20,965
Jesse.

506
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:23,176
Not you.

507
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:39,148
Nice job wearing the pants.

508
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:48,538
How do I know she'll keep quiet?

509
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:51,124
I guess you don't.

510
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:56,674
You'll never hear
from either of us again.

511
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:02,680
You're not seeing straight, Jesse.

512
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:04,843
You are making a mistake.

513
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:23,576
- Do you know what this is?
- It's a whole lot of cheddar.

514
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:25,363
This is freedom.

515
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:28,414
This is saying,
"I can go anywhere I want.

516
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:30,912
I can be anybody."

517
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,585
Who do you wanna be?

518
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:35,914
Where do you wanna go?
South America? Europe? Australia?

519
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:39,417
- Is New Zealand part of Australia?
- New Zealand is New Zealand.

520
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:40,714
Right on.

521
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:44,094
New Zealand. That's where
they made Lord of the Rings.

522
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:47,177
I say we just move there, yo.
I mean, you can do your art.

523
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,144
Right? Like, you can paint, like,
the local castles and shit.

524
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:52,430
And I can be a bush pilot.

525
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:55,221
Yeah. New Zealand.
I can get behind that.

526
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:59,522
But I guess I'm good anywhere
as long as it's the two of us.

527
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:08,447
But first, we gotta get clean.

528
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:10,621
And not because
anybody is telling us to.

529
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:15,744
- We do this for us, right?
- Yeah. Absolutely. For us.

530
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:18,917
All this here, we're not gonna
just shoot this up our arms, Jesse.

531
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:20,164
We're not.

532
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:22,875
Hell, no. No, no, no.
We're better than that.

533
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:25,716
We're way better than that. I say...

534
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:29,763
I say we flush what we've got left
and we start tonight.

535
00:38:33,272 --> 00:38:35,181
Yeah, we can do that.

536
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:37,482
Definitely.

537
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,488
Excuse me.

538
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:53,832
What can I get you?

539
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:58,038
Give me a Fat Tire draft, please.

540
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:05,797
Damn it.

541
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:10,342
Hey, honey.

542
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:13,218
No. I don't know what to tell you.

543
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:17,731
Three stores I've been to so far,
and not one of them have it in stock.

544
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:21,644
Well, do they have
to be diapers for newborns?

545
00:39:21,862 --> 00:39:24,732
What if we went up a size
and just kind of...

546
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:27,567
All right, all right. No, I understand.

547
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:30,785
All right. No, I'll just keep looking.

548
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:34,661
I'm pulling into Wal-Mart now, so...

549
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:37,621
Yeah. Okay. Love you.

550
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:39,461
Thank you.

551
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:41,707
God.

552
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:44,918
Well played.

553
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:56,804
They found water on Mars.

554
00:39:58,148 --> 00:39:59,227
They have indeed.

555
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:01,893
Don't know what to do
with that information...

556
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,566
...but, hey, God bless them,
they found it.

557
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:09,029
Oh, well, actually...

558
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:13,951
...they theoretically can separate
the hydrogen from the oxygen...

559
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:18,376
...and process that into providing
fuel for manned space flights.

560
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:22,915
Ostensibly, turning Mars into
a giant gas station.

561
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:24,923
So it's a...

562
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:29,757
Yeah. We live in an amazing time.

563
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:34,884
- To water on Mars.
- To water on Mars.

564
00:40:37,938 --> 00:40:41,058
So, what did you have? Girl or boy?

565
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:44,607
- Little girl.
- That's nice.

566
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,018
- Thanks.
- Congratulations.

567
00:40:46,238 --> 00:40:47,269
Thank you.

568
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:49,945
- I have a daughter.
- Yeah?

569
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,778
How old?

570
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:53,452
Old enough to know better.

571
00:40:54,204 --> 00:40:56,280
Twenty-seven next month.

572
00:40:58,792 --> 00:41:02,078
- You have other kids?
- Just the one.

573
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:07,758
I've got a 16-year-old boy.
Well, he's almost 16.

574
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:12,092
Jeez. Oh, there's a spread, huh?

575
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:14,675
But he helps out, though.

576
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:17,762
He's even changing some diapers
now, so...

577
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:21,181
It's more than I managed to do
when I was his age.

578
00:41:22,191 --> 00:41:24,978
Kids today grow up faster, I think.

579
00:41:25,527 --> 00:41:28,445
Oh, yeah. Yeah, maybe so.

580
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:32,025
So, any advice?

581
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:35,869
Having a daughter. Any advice?

582
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:39,659
No, not really. Just love them.

583
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:41,499
Just... Yeah.

584
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:45,245
I mean, they are who they are.

585
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:48,501
Yeah.

586
00:41:49,593 --> 00:41:53,804
I've got this nephew.

587
00:41:56,683 --> 00:42:00,099
This nephew who is...
I mean, he's an adult.

588
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:06,645
But you can't infantilize them,
you can't live their life for them.

589
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:10,729
But still, I mean,
there is that frustration.

590
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:12,442
You know, that...

591
00:42:12,658 --> 00:42:16,027
God, that frustration
that goes along with, you know:

592
00:42:16,245 --> 00:42:20,289
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know
what is best for you, so listen."

593
00:42:22,501 --> 00:42:24,577
But of course, they don't.

594
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:29,370
I mean, what do you do
with someone like that?

595
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,461
Family?

596
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:37,845
Yeah. Family.

597
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,050
You can't give up on them. Never.

598
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:44,306
I mean, what else is there?

599
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:33,149
Jesse, it's me.

600
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:42,410
Jesse, I just wanna talk.

601
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:21,867
Jesus.

602
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,762
Jesse.

603
00:44:44,893 --> 00:44:46,352
Jesse.

604
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:50,639
Jesse, wake up.

605
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:53,479
Jesse, wake up.

606
00:45:22,431 --> 00:45:24,222
No, no, no.

607
