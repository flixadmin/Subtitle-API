1
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,522
Dusty!

2
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,181
Dusty, how was it?

3
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,607
How was what?

4
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:30,062
"How was what?"
The greatest night of the year, of course.

5
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:33,739
Oh. Oh, yeah, it was...
It was, uh, tubular.

6
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,532
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

7
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,702
- Did something happen?
- No. What? No.

8
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,199
Are you constipated again?

9
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,496
No. Mom!

10
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,789
Okay, you're acting weird.

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,366
I am not acting weird!

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,460
- Whoa!
- Ah!

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,669
Awesome, right? Yeah...
I rigged the trap with, uh,

14
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,342
a motor to make it look like
I caught a ghost.

15
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,589
Just like the movie.

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,172
- Oh, Dusty.
- Yeah.

17
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:04,680
Funny. Look at that. Look at that.

18
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,278
I told you to keep quiet.

19
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:16,529
All you had to do was stay still
for one minute.

20
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,904
One minute.

21
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,579
Sorry, Yertle.

22
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,327
Temporary eviction, buddy.

23
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,002
What are you, little guy?

24
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,258
What were you doing in my trash?

25
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,727
You hungry?

26
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,828
Nougat.

27
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,287
Go on, eat.

28
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,626
Too hot?

29
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,328
Sorry about that, little guy.

30
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:16,050
You like nougat, too, huh?

31
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,797
You're pretty cute, you know that?

32
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,053
I'm glad I found you.

33
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,228
D'Artagnan.

34
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,766
I'm gonna call you d'Artagnan.

35
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,689
Rise and shine.

36
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,072
So that's it, huh?
You're still not talking?

37
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:29,829
All right.

38
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,915
I guess I'm just gonna have to, uh...

39
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,334
enjoy this triple-decker
Eggo extravaganza on my own.

40
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,433
Mmm!

41
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,471
Mmm!

42
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,562
Good, right?

43
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,563
Know the great thing about it?
It's only 8,000 calories.

44
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,858
You visited him again last night?

45
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,705
He says he needs me.

46
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,331
Want me to go check on him?

47
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,402
I know that you miss him, all right?

48
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,126
But it's too dangerous.

49
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,218
You're the last thing he needs right now.

50
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,883
You're gonna see him. Soon.

51
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:34,138
And not just in that head of yours.
You're gonna see him in real life.

52
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,811
I feel like I'm making progress
with these people.

53
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,599
Friends don't lie.

54
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:41,692
What?

55
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,068
You say "soon" on day 21.

56
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:47,443
You say "soon" on day 205.

57
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,652
- You now say "soon" on day 326?
- What is this?

58
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,225
You're counting the days now
like you're some kind of prisoner?

59
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,281
When is "soon"?

60
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,081
"Soon" is when...

61
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,664
it's not dangerous anymore.

62
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,086
When?

63
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,920
- I don't know.
- On day 500?

64
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,342
- I don't know.
- On day 600?

65
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,169
- I don't know.
- Day 700?

66
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,629
- On day 800?
- No!

67
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,403
- I need to see him. Tell me!
- I said I...

68
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,093
Oh! Shit! Shit!

69
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,605
Friends don't lie!

70
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,818
Jesus. Have you seen them?

71
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,367
- We're looking, Mom.
- Yeah, we're... we're looking.

72
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,070
- A-ha! Found 'em.
- Oh!

73
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,004
Hiding under some jeans,
sneaky little buggers.

74
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,746
Thank you. Thank you.
You're a life saver.

75
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,373
Can you take Will to school today?
I cannot be late again.

76
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,627
- He's staying over now?
- Can you just take Will, please?

77
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,002
I can take him.

78
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,545
- Will you make sure he gets in okay?
- Yeah, of course.

79
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,118
What do you say, big guy?
Wanna go for a ride in the Bobmobile?

80
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,289
Mr. Henderson, you know the rules.
Five at a time.

81
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,378
Yep.

82
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,626
One, two, three, four and five.

83
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:29,717
Ten.

84
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,922
You already have five books checked out.

85
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,219
My mistake.

86
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,966
However...

87
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,725
I am on a curiosity voyage,
and I need my paddles to travel.

88
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,473
These books...

89
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,184
These books are my paddles.

90
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,059
Five at a time.

91
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,315
- Are you shitting me?
- Excuse me?

92
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,188
What the hell is...

93
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,033
- Mr. Henderson!
- I need my paddles!

94
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,254
Was that you I heard milling around
last night, or was that a ghost?

95
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,501
Yeah. Me, probably.

96
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:15,716
- Another nightmare?
- Um... no.

97
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,349
Did I ever tell you about Mr. Baldo?

98
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,103
- Mr. Baldo?
- Yeah.

99
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,521
I was a little younger than you,

100
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,191
standing in line for the Ferris wheel
at the Roane County fair.

101
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,018
- Mmm-hmm.
- And suddenly,

102
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,820
I feel this fat white glove
tap me on the shoulder.

103
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:36,149
I spin around, and there he is.

104
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,743
Mr. Baldo.

105
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,366
"Hey, kiddo, would you like a balloon?"

106
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,448
Go ahead, laugh. It's funny.

107
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,955
It wasn't funny back then,
I can tell you that.

108
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,379
I couldn't get him out of my head.

109
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:53,458
Every night, he would come
to me in my dreams.

110
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,167
And every night when he came to me...

111
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:56,804
I ran.

112
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:02,057
It got so bad that I made
my mom stay in the room with me

113
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,135
until I could fall asleep every night.

114
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,391
- Really?
- Really.

115
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,893
It went on like that for months.

116
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,317
And then one day,
the nightmares suddenly stopped.

117
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,026
- Wanna know how?
- How?

118
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,157
Well, I fell asleep...

119
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,367
and just like always,
Mr. Baldo came to me.

120
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,661
Only this time, I didn't run.

121
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,668
This time, I stood my ground.

122
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,497
I just looked at Mr. Baldo

123
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,924
in his stupid face, and I said,
"Go away. Go away!"

124
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,551
Just like that, he was gone.

125
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,514
Never saw him again.

126
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,477
Easy-peasy, right?

127
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:49,639
Easy-peasy.

128
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,939
Just like that.

129
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,148
I still don't get why
they call him zombie boy.

130
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,878
I mean, I get it. He got lost in the woods
for a week or something,

131
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,275
but why is he a zombie?
Because everyone thought he was dead?

132
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,908
Yeah. I mean, we had a funeral
for him and everything.

133
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,580
After a week?

134
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,955
Well, see,
some other kid drowned at the quarry.

135
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,707
We thought it was Will
because his body was super decomposed.

136
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,797
What?

137
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,422
Okay, that's not funny.

138
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,591
It's not a joke, all right?
It's public knowledge.

139
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,088
You can ask anybody.

140
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,887
Except Will,
because he is really sensitive about it.

141
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:22,973
All right?

142
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,850
Okay.

143
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,643
Have a great day, kiddo.

144
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,304
<i>The case of Phineas Gage</i>

145
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,950
<i>is one of the great medical curiosities
of all time.</i>

146
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:49,157
<i>Phineas was a railroad worker in 1848
who had a nightmarish accident.</i>

147
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,869
A large iron rod was driven
completely through his head.

148
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:57,957
Phineas miraculously survived.
He seemed fine.

149
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,384
And physically, yes, he was.

150
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:04,346
But his injury resulted
in a complete change to his personality.

151
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,471
So much so that friends that knew him

152
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,894
started referring to him
as "No longer Gage."

153
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,848
At the time, this was known
as the American Crowbar Case.

154
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,274
Although it wasn't a...

155
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,602
I am so sorry, Mr. Clarke.

156
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,654
Really, I'm so sorry.
Please continue with the class.

157
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,776
Don't mind me.

158
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,074
Really, continue, please. Thanks.

159
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:28,537
Although it wasn't a crowbar,
it was a rod, as I said.

160
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:32,207
We have to meet. All of us.
At lunch, AV Club.

161
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,204
Why?

162
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,128
I have something that you won't believe.

163
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,465
AV Club. Lunch.

164
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,381
- Dustin!
- Yes, my lord?

165
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,804
- Would you care to join the class now?
- Please, yes.

166
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,847
- The case of Phineas Gage.
- Phineas Gage.

167
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,768
- Page 104.
- 104. 104.

168
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,186
- Focus.
- Focusing. Focusing.

169
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,063
AV Club.

170
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,568
And he began to curse,
using terrible words

171
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,488
that I don't dare repeat here.

172
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,579
And we found
some more by Gilbert's farm.

173
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,247
Some real nasty stuff.

174
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,370
- It was sticky.
- All right. Where else?

175
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:17,874
That was it, Chief.

176
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:19,671
That was it,
or you get tired of looking?

177
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,842
- It was getting dark.
- I mean, it was really dark.

178
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,885
They're called flashlights, you dipshits.

179
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,932
Oh, okay. Someone woke up
on the wrong side of the bed this morning.

180
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,225
More lady problems, Chief?

181
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,789
Hey, Chief! Where you going?

182
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,663
You want us to go back out there?

183
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,086
- Why's he gotta kick the door?
- Hey, Chief!

184
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,110
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

185
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,833
My granddad used to live here.

186
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,642
Long time ago.

187
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,274
I mainly just use it for storage now.

188
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,192
Lot of history here.

189
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:21,877
So, uh... what do you think?

190
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,293
It's a work-in-progress.
You know, it's, uh...

191
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,426
It takes a little imagination, but, uh...

192
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,504
once we fix it up,
it's gonna be nice.

193
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,348
Real nice.

194
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,676
This is your new home.

195
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,399
Home.

196
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,780
Oh, yeah.

197
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,449
Yeah, yeah.

198
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,119
All right, this...

199
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,154
this is music.

200
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,885
All right.
Let's get to work.

201
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,714
Give me those.

202
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,267
Okay.

203
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,682
Now, this is called a trip wire.

204
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,764
It's like an alarm.

205
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,985
You, uh, set it up like this.

206
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,109
And then, anybody gets close,

207
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:59,193
it's gonna make a loud noise
like, uh, gunfire.

208
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,028
Bang!

209
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,749
Those bad men aren't gonna find ya.

210
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,706
All right? Not way the hell out here.

211
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,671
We'll take some precautions.

212
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,546
There's gonna be a couple ground rules.

213
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,346
Rule number one:

214
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,927
always keep the curtains drawn.

215
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,677
Rule number two:

216
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,980
only open the door
if you hear my secret knock.

217
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,525
<i>And rule number three:</i>

218
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,901
don't ever go out alone,
especially not in the daylight.

219
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,833
<i>That's it. Three rules.</i>

220
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,956
I call 'em the, uh...

221
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,546
Don't Be Stupid Rules.

222
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,004
<i>'Cause we're not stupid.</i>

223
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,720
<i>Right?</i>

224
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:00,713
Not stupid.

225
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,906
Harrington, right?

226
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,954
I heard you used to run this school.
That true?

227
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,327
King Steve, they used to call you, huh?

228
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,207
Then you turned bitch.

229
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,575
Hey, maybe you should just shut up
and just play the game.

230
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:39,636
Whoo!

231
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:43,555
That's what I'm talking about! Whoo!

232
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:44,641
Steve?

233
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,931
- What are you doing here?
- What do you think?

234
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,559
Where were you this morning?
I missed first period.

235
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,015
I figured Jonathan would take you.

236
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,896
Wha... What are you talking about?

237
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,399
Jesus,
you really can't handle your alcohol.

238
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,489
Uh...

239
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,904
You remember going
to Tina's party last night, right?

240
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,780
- Yes.
- And then what?

241
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,863
I remember dancing, and...

242
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,831
spilling some punch.

243
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,534
You got mad at me because I was drunk...

244
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,828
and then you took me home.

245
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,209
No, see, that's where
your mind gets a little bit fuzzy.

246
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,042
That was your other boyfriend.
That was... That was Jonathan.

247
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,674
- I don't understand.
- It's pretty simple, Nancy.

248
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,675
- You were just telling it like it is.
- What?

249
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,765
Uh...

250
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,966
apparently, uh...

251
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:32,771
we killed Barb and I don't care,
'cause I'm bullshit...

252
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:36,476
and our whole... our whole relationship
is bullshit, and...

253
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,249
I mean, pretty much everything
is just bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

254
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,488
Oh, yeah, also, you don't love me.

255
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,567
I was drunk, Steve.
I don't remember any of that.

256
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,528
So that makes everything that you said...
It's what? Just bullshit, too?

257
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,953
- Yes.
- Well, then tell me.

258
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,371
Tell you what?

259
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:51,991
You love me.

260
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,543
Really?

261
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,629
Harrington!

262
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,377
Dude, we need you, man.
That douchebag's killing us. Let's go!

263
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,708
- All right!
- Come on!

264
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:09,891
I think that you're bullshit.

265
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,234
His name is d'Artagnan.

266
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,203
Cute, right?

267
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:31,113
- D'Artagnan?
- Dart for short.

268
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:35,041
- And he was in your trash?
- Foraging for food.

269
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,543
- You wanna hold him?
- No, no.

270
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,149
- He doesn't bite.
- I don't want to...

271
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,630
Oh, God, he's slimy!

272
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,625
Ugh, he's like a living booger.

273
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,460
Ugh, oh, God!

274
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,140
What is he?

275
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,968
My question exactly.

276
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,605
At first, I thought
it was some type of pollywog.

277
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,650
- Pollywog?
- It's another word for tadpole.

278
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,497
- A tadpole is the larval stage of a toad.
- I know what a tadpole is.

279
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:06,865
All right, then you know
that most tadpoles are aquatic, right?

280
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,908
Well, Dart, he isn't.
He doesn't need water.

281
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,111
Yeah, but aren't there
nonaquatic pollywogs?

282
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:14,369
Terrestrial pollywogs?
Yep. Two to be exact.

283
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,915
<i>Indirana semipalmata.</i>

284
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,660
And the <i>Adenomera andreae.</i>

285
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,167
One's from India,
one's from South America.

286
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,964
So how did one end up in my trash?

287
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,508
Maybe some scientists brought it here,
and it escaped?

288
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,926
Do you guys see that?

289
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,345
Looks like something
is moving inside of it.

290
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,683
Whoa.

291
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,889
It's okay. It's okay.

292
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:41,145
I got you, little guy.

293
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,898
I know you don't like that. It's okay.

294
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,195
And there's another thing.

295
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,898
Reptiles, they're cold-blooded.
Ectothermic, right?

296
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:51,235
They love heat, the sun.
Dart hates it. It hurts him.

297
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,036
So, if he's not a pollywog or a reptile...

298
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:56,080
Then I've discovered a new species.

299
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,092
We gotta show him to Mr. Clarke.

300
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,956
- What if he steals my discovery?
- He's not gonna steal your discovery.

301
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,893
You know, I'm thinking about calling it
<i>Dustonious pollywogus.</i>

302
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:23,145
- What do you think?
- I think you're an idiot.

303
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,075
When I become
rich and famous for this one day,

304
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,474
don't come crawling back, saying,

305
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,450
"Oh, my God, Dustin, I'm so sorry
for being mean to you back in 8th grade.

306
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,491
Oh, my God."

307
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,494
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

308
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,462
Baloney?

309
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,791
Mmm.

310
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,792
- Last night was fun.
- Mmm-hmm.

311
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:52,345
I'm sorry if I overstepped anything.

312
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,593
No! No, you didn't.

313
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:56,976
Okay.

314
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:58,895
I mean...

315
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,679
I... I like you so much.

316
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,604
Not just you,
everything that comes with you.

317
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,485
Your family, your boys.

318
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,958
And I hope it's not
wishful thinking, but...

319
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,657
I kinda feel like
I'm breaking through with them.

320
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:15,076
Not so much Jonathan.
He's a tough cookie to crack, but...

321
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,073
Yeah.

322
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:20,032
With Will, I don't know,
I feel like we're connecting.

323
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,457
He likes you, too.

324
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,784
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

325
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,164
I can tell.

326
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,254
Good.

327
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,834
Oh, there was...
something else I was gonna mention, but...

328
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,169
It's not a big deal at all, but...

329
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:37,557
I just noticed this morning that my JVC
was a little dinged up.

330
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:40,844
- Your what?
- The video camera.

331
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:42,930
- Oh.
- Yeah.

332
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,140
It still works fine and everything.
I just...

333
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,021
I went back and watched the tape...

334
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:51,029
and there were some older kids
picking on Will.

335
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,314
- What?
- They scared him.

336
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:56,026
Who were they?
Were they the Zimmerman brothers again?

337
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,327
Um, I don't know.

338
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,293
They were wearing masks
or sort of makeup and...

339
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,830
Maybe. They were the right age.

340
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,327
I'll kill them.

341
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:05,502
I swear to God, I will...
I will kill them.

342
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,079
That's what I love about you.
You punch back.

343
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,383
I was never really one
to put up a fight.

344
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,596
I struggled a lot like Will
when I was a kid.

345
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,218
With bullies.

346
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,472
It's the ones like us,
that don't punch back,

347
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,519
that people really take
advantage of, you know?

348
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,018
They rub your nose in it,
just a little bit more.

349
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,267
I don't know why they do that.

350
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,363
Maybe it makes them feel powerful.

351
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,575
I don't know.

352
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,324
But, hey, look at me now.

353
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,331
I get to date Joyce Byers. Ha!

354
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:46,034
Are you kidding me? I get to date...

355
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,578
It all works out in the end,
doesn't it?

356
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,004
Yes, it does.

357
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,015
Grass, crops, trees.

358
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,468
Everything in this area
is either dead or dying,

359
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,770
and that's a radius of over three miles.

360
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:07,563
And it all leads back to here.

361
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:12,485
See, these patterns here
are really pretty. I like the design.

362
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:14,483
It's almost psychedelic.

363
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:18,237
- This is a joke to you, huh?
- No, it's not a joke. I just...

364
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,819
I don't understand what this
has to do with me, Chief Hopper.

365
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:25,123
Whatever is happening is spreading
from this place, from this lab.

366
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:29,123
That's impossible. It's...
The last burn was two days ago.

367
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,499
It's contained.

368
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,548
- What if there's a leak?
- A leak?

369
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:36,342
- I don't know, man. You're the scientist.
- Exactly.

370
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,886
And I'm telling you
there's nothing to worry about.

371
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:40,675
- Convince me.
- Convince you?

372
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:44,058
Yeah. You and your egghead friends

373
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,603
go out there to every area on this map
and you run your tests,

374
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:51,524
or whatever the hell it is you do,
and you see if anything comes up.

375
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,734
All right, so...

376
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:56,279
So you're... you're giving me orders now?

377
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,157
No.

378
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,950
- I keep things nice and quiet for you...
- Mmm-hmm.

379
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,404
...and you keep your shit out of my town.

380
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:05,784
That is the deal.

381
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,958
I have done my part, now you do yours.

382
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,755
Convince me.

383
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,377
So, he asked you to take me home?

384
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:21,097
Yeah.

385
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,048
Yeah, he was upset.

386
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,680
I mean, he was... He was really upset.

387
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,346
But he was still worried about you.

388
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,901
Hey.

389
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:36,311
You need to cut yourself some slack, okay?

390
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,447
People say stupid things
when they're wasted.

391
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:40,774
Things they don't mean.

392
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,359
Yeah, but that's the thing.

393
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:44,448
What if I did mean it?

394
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:48,908
All this time, I've been trying
so hard to pretend like everything's fine,

395
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,993
but it's not.

396
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,794
I... I feel like there's this...

397
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,543
I don't know, like this...

398
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,421
Like there's this weight
you're carrying around with you.

399
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,711
All the time.

400
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:02,966
I feel it, too.

401
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,468
Yeah, but it's different for you.

402
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,310
Will came home.

403
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,394
Yeah.

404
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:09,937
Yeah, he did.

405
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,601
But he's not the same.

406
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:17,151
I try to be there for him,
you know, to help him, but...

407
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,945
I don't know.

408
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,317
I mean, maybe...

409
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:27,574
maybe things just can't go back
to the way they were.

410
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,161
Doesn't that make you mad?

411
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:32,950
Mad?

412
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:36,004
Yeah, that those...
those people who did this,

413
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,002
who ruined so many lives,
they just get away with it.

414
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,004
The people responsible for this...

415
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,594
- they're dead.
- Do you really believe that?

416
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,475
Your mom's boyfriend.

417
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,732
- He works at RadioShack, right?
- Yeah.

418
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:01,989
Why?

419
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,278
What are you thinking?

420
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,287
Do you wanna skip fourth period?

421
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:12,491
Isn't this fun?

422
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,681
Pump your feet.

423
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,684
<i>"I would feel so sad if I thought
I was a disappointment to her...</i>

424
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,395
because she didn't live
very long after that, you see.

425
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,857
She died of a fever
when I was just three months old.

426
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:50,662
I do wish she'd lived long enough for me
to remember calling her mother.

427
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,579
I think it would be so sweet
to say 'mother."'

428
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,328
Do I have a mother?

429
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,164
Yeah, of course you have a mother.

430
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,750
You couldn't really be born without one.

431
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,086
Where is she?

432
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,337
She...

433
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:08,971
She's not around anymore.

434
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,600
Gone?

435
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,020
Yeah.

436
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,271
I'm sorry about that, kid.

437
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:33,078
"And, uh, father died
four days afterwards from fever, too.

438
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,532
That left me an orphan
and folks were at their wits' end,

439
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,584
so Mrs. Thomas said to me,
what to do with me.

440
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,208
You see, nobody wanted me even then.

441
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:43,039
<i>It seems to be my fate."</i>

442
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,045
Is your mom here?

443
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:46,969
Sweetie?

444
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,681
School.

445
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,304
Where is school?

446
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,728
The school? It's, uh...
it's about a mile that way.

447
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,398
At least.

448
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,566
Where are your parents?

449
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,112
Look, Mommy, look.

450
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,522
RadioShack, Bob Newby speaking.
How can I help ya?

451
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,233
Bob, it's Joyce.

452
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,817
Hey, Joyce, how ya doing?

453
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,824
Hey, um... I'm trying
to watch your video thingy,

454
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,373
and the tape, it's... it's tiny.
It's like it's shrunk.

455
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,247
That's 'cause it's a VHS-C,
not a VHS.

456
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,875
You gotta find the RF-P1U
with coaxial cable

457
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,002
so you can connect the video ins and outs.

458
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,833
Bob, English.

459
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,884
Right. Sorry. Um...

460
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:16,181
No, yeah, I did the coaxial things
in the back, so I...

461
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,726
This one just goes into the camera itself?

462
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,930
<i>- Yeah. Yeah, exactly.</i>
- It's blue. I think it's working.

463
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,251
I was thinking maybe tonight...

464
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,732
Joyce?

465
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:32,152
<i>So you hit T to zoom in,
and Wzooms back out.</i>

466
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,528
<i>See? Easy-peasy.</i>

467
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,390
<i>Watch it, zombie boy.</i>

468
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,142
<i>Trick or treat, freak.</i>

469
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,149
<i>Boo!</i>

470
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:08,101
<i>Loser.</i>

471
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,983
<i>Mike! Mike!</i>

472
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,374
Will, you coming?
Let's go show Mr. Clarke.

473
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,882
What?

474
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,753
What?

475
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,797
It's about d'Artagnan.

476
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,470
This is the reason I was late for class.

477
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,053
Pretty neat. These doors function?

478
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,509
Well, yeah, obviously.
But it's not about the trap.

479
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,810
It's what's inside.

480
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,934
Now, this very well may change
your perception of the world.

481
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,144
Consider my interest piqued.

482
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:32,310
All right, first,
let's just clarify that...

483
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,646
this is my discovery, not yours.

484
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,071
Dustin, Jesus! Just show him!

485
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,757
- I'm just trying to clarify...
- Dustin!

486
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:38,987
Okay, fine.

487
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,077
Stop!

488
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,198
I'm sorry, Mr. Clarke.
It was just a stupid prank.

489
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,517
- What are you doing?
- I told him to stop. We need to go.

490
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,373
- Mike!
- Right now. Right now!

491
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,792
So, your sister coming or what?

492
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:56,342
Screw it. That little shit can skate home.

493
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,925
- And don't call her that.
- What?

494
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,177
Sister. She's not my sister.

495
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,441
Hello? Hello?

496
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,773
- Guys, come on. Can I come in yet?
- No!

497
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:22,159
- I don't understand.
- What do you not understand?

498
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,079
Will saw something
that looked like Dart last year?

499
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:27,122
Kind of, but there was no tail.

500
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,291
But then he heard it yesterday.
The exact same sound.

501
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,414
- Why didn't you tell us before?
- I wasn't sure.

502
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,790
- A coincidence.
- Or not.

503
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,747
What if when Will was stuck
in the Upside Down,

504
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,423
he somehow acquired True Sight?

505
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,420
True Sight?

506
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,672
It gives you the power
to see into the ethereal plane.

507
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,379
Elaborate.

508
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:44,932
Maybe these episodes that Will keeps
having aren't really flashbacks at all.

509
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,259
Maybe they're real.

510
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:48,686
Maybe Will can somehow see
into the Upside Down.

511
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:51,264
- So that would mean...
- Dart is from the Upside Down.

512
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:53,771
- We have to take him to Hopper.
- I agree.

513
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,022
No way. If we take him to Hopper,
Dart's good as dead.

514
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,944
- Maybe he should be.
- How can you say that?

515
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,711
How can you not?
He's from the Upside Down.

516
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:02,617
Maybe. But even if he is, it doesn't
automatically mean that he's bad.

517
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,102
That's like saying just because
someone's from the Death Star

518
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,803
- doesn't make them bad.
- We have a bond.

519
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,331
A bond? Just because he likes nougat?

520
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,578
No, because he trusts me!

521
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,955
He trusts you?

522
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:13,707
Yes, I promised
I would take care of him.

523
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,217
Guys, what's going on? Come on.

524
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,709
- Don't hurt him.
- Only if he attacks.

525
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,144
Just open it already.

526
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:43,073
Holy shit!

527
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,790
Oh, shit!

528
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,329
No!

529
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,467
What the...

530
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,338
Oh, shit!

531
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:05,133
Where'd he go?

532
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,304
- What was that?
- Dart!

533
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,848
- What?
- You let him escape!

534
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,891
- Why did you attack him?
- Come on.

535
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:12,140
Don't hurt him. Don't you hurt him!

536
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,444
Jonathan?

537
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,522
Uh... Mrs. Wheeler.

538
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,652
- What a pleasant surprise.
- Yeah.

539
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,902
- Uh, we have a test tomorrow.
- Hmm.

540
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:32,373
- Oh, did you go shopping?
- Oh, uh, yeah. My Walkman broke.

541
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,870
- Aw!
- Bummer.

542
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,720
Anyway, we should go.
It's a really big test.

543
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,127
- Yeah.
- So...

544
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,670
- Stressful.
- Very.

545
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:42,007
- Bye, Mrs. Wheeler.
- Bye! It's good to see you.

546
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,382
Okay, are you sure about this?

547
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:46,472
No.

548
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,517
Hello. Marsha speaking.

549
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,361
Hello?

550
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,107
<i>Hello?</i>

551
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:07,317
Mrs. Holland. Hi, it's, um... it's Nancy.

552
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:08,947
Nancy?

553
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,037
I, uh...

554
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:14,745
I need to tell you something.
Something about Barb.

555
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:16,917
<i>About that night. I, uh...</i>

556
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,791
I, uh... I haven't been honest with you.

557
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,584
But I can't tell you here on the phone.

558
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,841
<i>Meet me tomorrow,
Forrest Hills Park, 9:00 a.m.</i>

559
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,047
<i>Don't tell anyone.</i>

560
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,507
<i>And don't call me back here.
It's dangerous.</i>

561
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:32,933
<i>Nancy, what is this?</i>

562
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,352
<i>I just need you
to trust me. Please.</i>

563
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:52,070
Well, you were right
about these pumpkins.

564
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,870
Some nasty stuff.

565
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,074
And the smell...
Gee, mother of God.

566
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,727
What exactly do you think
is going on...

567
00:38:57,794 --> 00:38:59,956
Well, I told you what I think.

568
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,709
But we'll run the tests,
and we'll see what comes up.

569
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:06,376
In the meantime, I just need you
to keep the area clear for us.

570
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,426
I don't think it'll be
more than a day or two.

571
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,254
What do you want me to tell people?

572
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,344
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

573
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,352
- <i>Hey, Chief, you copy?</i>
- Yeah.

574
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:21,057
Do you remember that Russian girl
Murray was going on about the other day?

575
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:24,606
Yeah, well, now I'm thinking
he's not so crazy after all.

576
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,281
Stay where you are. Do not move.

577
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,455
East is clear. No sign of Dart.

578
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,545
Where'd you go, you little bastard?

579
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,151
West is clear, too. Will?

580
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,521
South is clear. Lucas?

581
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,074
<i>Anything?</i>

582
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,947
Excuse me! Mr. Sinclair!

583
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,654
Sorry,
I was looking for study hall.

584
00:40:58,748 --> 00:40:59,748
Bye.

585
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,291
Nothing here, man.

586
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,837
- What the hell are you doing?
- What are you doing?

587
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,530
- Why are you in here?
- Looking for Dart.

588
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:55,994
- This is the boys' room.
- Yeah, so?

589
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,591
So you should go home.

590
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,805
- Why do you hate me so much?
- I don't hate you.

591
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,916
- How can I hate you? I don't know you.
- But you don't want me in your party.

592
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,940
- Correct.
- Why not?

593
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:10,067
Because you're annoying.
Also, we don't need another party member.

594
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:14,113
I'm our paladin, Will's our cleric,
Dustin's our bard, Lucas is our ranger,

595
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,609
and El is our mage.

596
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,864
- El? Who's El?
- Someone. No one.

597
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,114
Someone or no one?

598
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,447
She was in our party a long time ago.
She moved away, okay?

599
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:25,908
She was a mage?

600
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,537
Well, what could she do?
Like, magic tricks or something?

601
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,417
Well, I could be your zoomer.

602
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,840
- That's not even a real thing.
- It could be.

603
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,090
- See? Zoomer.
- Mind-blowing.

604
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,968
Come on, you know you're impressed.

605
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,615
I don't see any tricks.
You're just going around in a circle.

606
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,680
If it's so easy, you try it.

607
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:49,310
- No.
- Why not?

608
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,436
I don't know how.

609
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,643
So, then you admit
it's kind of impressive.

610
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:55,855
I think if I spent, like,
all day practicing, I could do that.

611
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,565
I would give you a million bucks
if you could.

612
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,696
Okay, you're making me dizzy.

613
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:03,245
- Please just stop.
- I'll stop when I join your party.

614
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:06,950
- Come on, just stop.
- It's a simple question. Am I in or out?

615
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,676
Jesus! Are you all right?

616
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,803
Yeah, yeah. I think so.

617
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:26,306
- What happened?
- I don't know.

618
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:29,183
It was like a magnet or something
pulling on my board.

619
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,559
I know that sounds crazy.

620
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,584
Come on, come on, come on!

621
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,755
Hawkins Middle. May I help you?

622
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,508
<i>Yes. Hi, Doris. It's Joyce.</i>

623
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,213
<i>- Uh, Joyce Byers.</i>
- Joyce.

624
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,926
<i>Uh, Will has AV Club today.
Could you transfer me to Mr. Clarke?</i>

625
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,557
- Mr. Clarke? Huh. You know what?
<i>- What?</i>

626
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,731
I just saw him leave for the day.
Maybe AVwas canceled?

627
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:14,649
<i>- What?</i>
- Would you like me to...

628
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,110
Guys...

629
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,271
- I found him.
<i>- Where?</i>

630
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,733
In the bathroom by Mr. Salerno's.

631
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:05,863
<i>Copy that.</i>

632
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,497
It's okay.

633
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:11,740
I'm not gonna hurt you.

634
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,046
Hey, buddy.

635
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:08,714
Come here. You know I won't hurt you.

636
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,926
It's okay. It's just me.

637
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:14,062
You're okay.

638
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,308
- Let's go. Down here.
- We're coming!

639
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,818
Stay low. Keep quiet.

640
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,314
Where's Dart?

641
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:27,195
- I don't know. Not here.
- What?

642
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:30,699
- He said by Salerno's, right?
- Yeah, maybe Will has him.

643
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:33,496
Where is Will?

644
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:43,708
Only this time, I didn't run.

645
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,724
This time, I stood my ground.

646
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,403
I said, "Go away. Go away!"

647
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,284
Go away!

648
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,498
Go away!

649
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:20,585
Go away!

650
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:24,624
Go away! Go away!

651
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,834
Go away!

652
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:38,262
Easy-peasy, right?

653
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,932
Easy-peasy.

654
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,860
Just like that.

655
00:47:45,884 --> 00:47:53,884
