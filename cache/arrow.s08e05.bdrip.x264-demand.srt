1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,269
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,914
H-how is this real?

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,356
- This is Novu?
- How do we stop a god?

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,555
I'm working on it.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,917
Hello, bunker! So why'd
you call in the big guns?

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,671
Earth-2 was destroyed
by a wave of energy.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,516
So it's probably powerful
enough to stop a god.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,557
Yes, Curtis?
Whatever it is, it is

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,438
possible to replicate,
but there's a catch.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,069
It is super illegal because
it requires plutonium.

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,639
Luckily, there's a
guy, a military general.

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,313
-Ok. Where is he? ‘Russia.

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,629
You can bring back my Earth?

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,239
The recovery of your universe

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,550
will require a single task.

16
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,070
You must betray Oliver Queen.

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,472
So that's the
secret? A tennis ball.

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,194
You know how you
use a honing steel

19
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,998
to keep the edge
on a chef's knife?

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,150
I don't really cook.

21
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,790
That makes sense.

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,189
All right.

23
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,799
This keeps you sharp.

24
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,229
Only a direct, precise
hit will pin the ball.

25
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,277
If you are off
just a little bit...

26
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,150
it deflects.

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,670
Ready?

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,870
Toss it.

29
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,595
Thought this was
supposed to be hard.

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,069
This is the warm-up.

31
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,430
Ready.

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,279
So specialty arrows,

33
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,029
and each one has
a specific purpose.

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,470
What does this one do?

35
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,598
Explosive arrow,
lighter payload,

36
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,319
meant to divert and disable.

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,795
Acidic arrow, meant
to breach covertly

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,274
or weaken structurally.

39
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,440
Bolo arrow-- to
secure and subdue.

40
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,110
These are just tools.

41
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,553
If you rely on them too
much, they become crutches.

42
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,709
Then why have them?

43
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,118
To get out of a fight

44
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,352
or to end one before it begins.

45
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,750
Not bad.

46
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,750
So what's next?

47
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,670
Hyah!

48
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,510
Nyssa taught you well.

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,954
Mom made sure of it.

50
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,150
How did you do that?

51
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,350
Variable acceleration.

52
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,358
All right? It's
all about timing.

53
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,477
You keep practicing,
you keep flowing,

54
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,675
it just becomes second nature.

55
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,672
All right. Again.

56
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,319
You don't want a break maybe?

57
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,240
She's a machine, Dad.
They don't need breaks.

58
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,073
And speaking of machines, I
have something to show you guys.

59
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,993
I created a facial
recognition algorithm

60
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,992
to find that general
that Curtis told us about,

61
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,197
which was a lot
harder than it sounds,

62
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,033
because no offense to Felicity,

63
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,157
but these computers are,
like, a million years old.

64
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,754
And Russia is a
very big country.

65
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,479
William, Right. Sorry.

66
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,037
His name is General Alexi Burov,

67
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,315
and he's in Moscow.

68
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,874
Curtis said that

69
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,678
the energy wave
that destroyed Earth-2

70
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,956
can be replicated, which
means we can weaponize it.

71
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,674
And right before
he went off the grid,

72
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,797
Burov was working on
plans for a weapon called

73
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,190
the pulse wave generator.

74
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,714
All right, We need those plans.

75
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,518
We also need plutonium.

76
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,398
It's the only thing that can
power Burov's machine.

77
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,074
Wait. Plutonium as
in a nuclear bomb?

78
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,038
“Mm-hmm, “Where
are we gonna get that?

79
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,635
Bialya. There's a
facility near the border

80
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,440
where all kinds of
radioactive material is stored.

81
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,032
I'm thinking a two-man fire
team can get the job done.

82
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,998
Okay. Want to take Connor?
-No, no.

83
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,958
Actually, he wanted
to check in on Sandra.

84
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,440
And he promised
to stay out of sight.

85
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,710
I have someone
else in mind to help.

86
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,712
Okay. I'd like the two of you

87
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,757
to accompany me
and Laurel to Russia.

88
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,270
Okay?

89
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,515
Yeah.

90
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,193
Okay. We'll wheels up at dawn.

91
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,879
Well, better go buy a parka.

92
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,391
Is it really that
cold in Russia?

93
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,631
Oh, oh! You are
so not ready for this.

94
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,672
Things seem to be going
pretty well with the kids.

95
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,109
Never thought I'd
get to know them.

96
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,590
Not like this.

97
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,080
Is that why you invited
them to go with you?

98
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,753
Well, I mean, I promised Mia

99
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,633
that I would keep training her.

100
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,713
And I think it's very valuable
for them to keep seeing

101
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,672
how we operate in the field.

102
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,871
And you're sure Russia's a
good place for a tutorial, Oliver?

103
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,951
That was a very
dark time for you.

104
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,713
It was a long time ago, though.

105
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,558
I'm a better man.
I'm a different man.

106
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,550
I think that I can
teach them good

107
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,119
without showing them the bad.

108
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,749
Hope so.

109
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,680
What the hell are
you doing here?

110
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,479
Our mutual friend sent me.

111
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,592
You're working with
the Monitor. Why?

112
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,159
-It's complicated. Really?

113
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,958
Because he destroyed
my entire Earth.

114
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,440
That seems pretty
straightforward to me.

115
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,795
He didn't.

116
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,555
Mar Novu is trying
to save worlds,

117
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,875
not destroy them.

118
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,438
All that stuff about grief,

119
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,636
you pretending like you
were trying to help me.

120
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,870
I should've known better.

121
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,189
I wasn't pretending.

122
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,916
It's a little hard to believe,
Lyla, after all the lying.

123
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,716
It doesn't matter
what you believe.

124
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,911
You're here just
the same as I am.

125
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,317
Now, do you want to get
your Earth back or not?

126
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,110
What does he want me to do?

127
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,714
Oliver's going to Russia

128
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,038
to retrieve plans
to build a weapon.

129
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,830
You need to get them first.

130
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,713
I thought Oliver
was your friend.

131
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,275
He is, but this is
bigger than him,

132
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,475
bigger than any of us.

133
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,392
Well, whatever the
Monitor offered you must be

134
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,278
really something for
you to be able to betray

135
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,919
everyone that you care about.

136
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,438
I am doing this for
them, to protect them.

137
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,069
Are you going to help me?

138
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,870
Yeah.

139
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,030
1 will.

140
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,599
Contact me when it's done.

141
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,950
And here I thought I was
supposed to be the bad guy.

142
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,590
Help you?

143
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,159
Yeah. I was looking for Jason.

144
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,279
Yo, Jason! You got a visitor.

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,230
How you doing, Jason?

146
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,150
How'd you find me?

147
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,557
Oliver's son--
William. He found you.

148
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,198
Oliver's son.
Isn't he, like, 13?

149
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,994
Heh! Yeah, well,
it's a long story.

150
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,675
I have a feeling you
didn't come all this way

151
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,239
just to catch me up to speed.

152
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,034
I didn't. I need your help, Roy.

153
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,994
Whatever you're about to
ask me to do, I can't. 'm sorry.

154
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,559
You haven't even heard
what I have to say, man.

155
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,633
‘Cause I don't need
to. You know what I did.

156
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,439
I'm not a hero anymore, John,

157
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,157
not with my condition.

158
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,390
So you're just gonna
walk out on me,

159
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,515
same way you did Thea?

160
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,670
No.

161
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,269
Thea told Oliver that you left,
man, without even saying good-bye.

162
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,239
It was for the best
for the both of us.

163
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,710
I needed a fresh start,
which is what I'm doing now.

164
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,235
Ok, it was...

165
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,433
it was good to see you, John.

166
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,790
Roy...

167
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,710
look, man,

168
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,112
I know earlier this year
was a struggle for you,

169
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,551
but this crisis is a
threat that's bigger

170
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,358
than anything we've ever faced.

171
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,749
I wouldn't be here, man,
if we did not need you.

172
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,390
If 1 decide to help you,
it'll be a one-time thing.

173
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,630
That's all I'm asking.

174
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,515
I hope you don't
mind, but, uh...

175
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,679
I brought you a
change of clothes.

176
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,279
So this is Russia.

177
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,114
Not what you were expecting?

178
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,876
I just thought there'd
be a lot less dirt.

179
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,198
Is very rude to insult
man's homeland.

180
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,350
Hello, Anatoly.

181
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,309
Oliver Queen...

182
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,270
my brother.

183
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,517
Oh, you think maybe
I punch you again?

184
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,954
Never even crossed my mind.

185
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,710
Welcome to Russia,
my favorite American.

186
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,630
Now, I have seen some
very crazy things in my life,

187
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,478
but adult children of Oliver
Queen sitting in my bar.

188
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,118
I hope you do not
think badly of me.

189
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,271
Last time we met,
you were little,

190
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,353
and I was on wrong
side of history.

191
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,955
I like this one already.

192
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,077
I was surprised to learn
that you were in Russia.

193
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,119
I thought the Maldives
would be permanent.

194
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,709
Oh, with Diaz dead,
50 reason to stay away.

195
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,995
You got bored.

196
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,750
I miss borscht.

197
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,273
So I reinvent myself.
Bar owner. Hm.

198
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,430
But I got inspired, too.

199
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,671
1 got really good
recipe for pifia colada.

200
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,955
You should try. It's delicious.

201
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,554
Who wouldn't want to
be reminded of the tropics

202
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,836
in these cold Russian winters?

203
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,673
Well, apparently, his customers.

204
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,954
Nice to see this
one's still charmer.

205
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,597
How's the search
going for General Burov?

206
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,029
Well, it's not very easy.

207
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,953
But I do have
friends I can call.

208
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,794
I know, but I--I don't
want them involved in this.

209
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,520
Why not?

210
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,189
If he has friends
that can help, it-

211
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,714
Because, Mia, with due respect,

212
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,996
the people that
Anatoly is describing...

213
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,434
aren't really friends.

214
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,319
Let's just keep this
one in the family, ok?

215
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,950
All right.

216
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,153
1 work to find Burov hard way.

217
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,470
You really think
an energy weapon's

218
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,119
gonna stop this Monitor guy?

219
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,715
Yeah well, that's the hope.

220
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,915
Why this place?

221
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,194
The military stores all
its excess plutonium here.

222
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,116
The problem is
it's impenetrable.

223
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,677
Which is why you
asked me to come.

224
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,959
You need a B and E
expert to get inside?

225
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,235
Yeah. Well, actually, it's
more of a smash and grab.

226
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,038
There's a shipment
coming in tonight.

227
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,436
We are gonna steal the plutonium

228
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,869
before it gets inside.

229
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,030
Go. Go. Go.

230
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,037
Why not bring Dinah or Rene?

231
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,077
They have their
hands full in Star City.

232
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,949
Must be weird, right?

233
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,109
Oliver meeting his future son.

234
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,872
Yeah. Well, he's
not the only one.

235
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,317
In the future, I adopt
Ben Turner's son, Connor.

236
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,515
He's an agent in Knightwatch,

237
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,829
future version of AR.G.US.

238
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,239
Well, it sounds like he
would've been a great candidate

239
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,475
for this mission.

240
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,877
You didn't need
me for this, John.

241
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,433
So what are we
really doing here?

242
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,474
You said you wanted to atone.

243
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,997
Well, you can't do
that by fixing cars.

244
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,198
You do that by
rejoining the team.

245
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,355
I know you think you
can't control your bloodlust.

246
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,790
That's only because you haven't
figured out a way that works.

247
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,473
Because there is no way.

248
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,115
So whatever you're about to say,

249
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,429
I don't want to hear it.

250
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,116
Look, we're already here,
so I'm gonna help you.

251
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,313
But once we're done,
I'm going to disappear

252
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,436
to a place where even
William can't find me.

253
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,236
I have classic bad
news/good news.

254
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,434
I find general Burov.

255
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,718
Is that the bad news? I'm
confused about the order.

256
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,837
Bad news is, is he is
man who likes betting

257
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,232
and blood, which means
only place to find him,

258
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,310
Krovavaya Banya.

259
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,879
"The Bloodbath."

260
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,951
Oh. Heh. Doesn't
that sound lovely?

261
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,511
It's not lovely.
It's a fight club.

262
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,475
Oh. That sounds
like where I met her.

263
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,915
He met you where?

264
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,070
Well, when I first left home,

265
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,469
I had to find a way
to make money.

266
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,110
So I fought, and I won,

267
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,357
Like father, like
daughter, eh, tovarisch?

268
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,911
You, me, and Laurel

269
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,639
will go to the
club to find Burov.

270
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,635
You two are gonna stay here.

271
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,473
Did you not hear
what I just said?

272
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,080
1 grew up in fight clubs.

273
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,560
You did not grow
up in fight clubs

274
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,710
that were run by the Bratva.

275
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,320
Then why did you
bring us on this mission

276
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,595
if you're not gonna let us help?

277
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,274
This is not a regular
mission. This is the Bratva.

278
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,478
They are terrible people,
and you guys are my kids.

279
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,630
Yes, but we're not children.

280
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,513
Well, you are when Ilook at you.

281
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,912
And I'm sorry, but this
is how it's gonna be.

282
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,550
Okay.

283
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,552
So this is what the
Russians do for fun.

284
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,912
I assume that we want to
have our chat with the general

285
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,599
without crossing the Bratva.

286
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,149
We want to move quickly
and keep our heads low.

287
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,310
There is General.

288
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,151
Damn it. So boring.

289
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,719
General Burov...

290
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,195
I am Anatoly
Knyazev, Danik's friend.

291
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,914
Danik has big mouth.

292
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,510
What do you want?

293
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,750
Your expertise...

294
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,195
with something sensitive.

295
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,313
Lucky for you,
this fight is boring.

296
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,075
Let us go talk.

297
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,673
I abandoned this pulse
wave generator project.

298
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,554
Too unpredictable, bad business.

299
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,950
So...

300
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,717
why should I give to you,

301
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,950
Kapiushon?

302
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,073
Maybe you should've kept
your secret identity secret?

303
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,910
So this means that

304
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,277
you won't be giving
us the plans willingly.

305
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,319
No need for unpleasantness.
1 am willing to make deal.

306
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,959
Good. What do you want?

307
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,790
A fighter,

308
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,751
someone to upset the favorite

309
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,593
so I cannot be bored.

310
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,556
Should be easy for
you, Kapiushon, no?

311
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,677
So I win, and then
you give us the plans.

312
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,670
Done deal.

313
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,679
Excellent. 1 will go make it so.

314
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,311
You saw that goliath, right?

315
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,879
He is twice your size.

316
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,553
So I give him half a chance.

317
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,315
You got a problem?

318
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,355
Nyet.

319
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,515
Oliver seems to think
you are hero now.

320
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,870
I'm not so sure.

321
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,992
I think you may be
like snow leopard

322
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,875
who cannot change spots.

323
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,235
You changed yours.

324
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,671
Worry less about me and more
about your friend over there.

325
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,114
I'll sweep the perimeter.

326
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,870
Wow.

327
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,360
Impressive, no?

328
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,758
Anatoly, let's
get the car ready.

329
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,516
Very good! I don't think you
have many fans here, though.

330
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,238
But I am man of my word.

331
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,910
Not so fast.

332
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,480
This one needs to
learn not to put nose

333
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,553
in other people's business.

334
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,717
Oleg, wha--what a pleasure,

335
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,837
Did you really think you
could conduct business

336
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,718
on Bratva territory
without me knowing?

337
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,520
Of course not. This simply
fighter collecting his winnings.

338
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,115
He's no mere fighter,
are you, Oliver Queen?

339
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,595
How does he know who you are?

340
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,110
Everyone in Russia
knows Kapiushon.

341
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,237
We have no fight
with you or the Bratva,

342
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,319
That is what we came for.

343
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,357
When we have it, we're gone.

344
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,394
The general only operates
here because we say he can.

345
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,515
And we did not say.

346
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,753
No!

347
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,390
Mia.

348
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,150
You okay?

349
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,989
Yeah, I'm fine.

350
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,274
“Where are we? Um.

351
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,639
Yeah, probably
some Bratva hideout.

352
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,120
I told you to stay put, Mia.
What were you thinking?

353
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,270
That we needed
to finish the mission.

354
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,158
You understand that I
had it handled, correct?

355
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,879
Uh, apparently not, considering

356
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,838
we are tied up in
a creepy basement.

357
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,792
Why did he call you "Kapiushon"?

358
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,114
Kapiushon is a nickname
that the Bratva gave me.

359
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,635
It means "hood."

360
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,078
You were a member of the Bratva.

361
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,630
You should've told me.

362
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,751
1 didn't want you or
William involved in this.

363
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,480
- can handle myself.
-That is not what this is about.

364
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,715
Then what is it about?

365
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,509
Ugh. Damn it.

366
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,279
We tied your thumbs.

367
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,557
You went to a lot
of trouble to get this.

368
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,710
Even we couldn't crack
its security encryptions.

369
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,953
Must be worth a great deal.

370
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,270
Tell me what it is.

371
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,430
No.

372
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,796
I will only ask once more.

373
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,914
You have 5 seconds.

374
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,553
5... Don't tell him anything.

375
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,189
4.3...

376
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,429
2...

377
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,230
They're plans...

378
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,110
For a weapon that
Burov's building.

379
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,955
Was that so hard?

380
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,151
Now we can move
on to next phase.

381
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,918
Ok, what are the chances
that my father and sister

382
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,038
are in the clutches of the Russian
mob but aren't already dead?

383
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,678
Slim and getting slimmer every
second we do not find them.

384
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,356
Ok, their phones aren't online.
Why aren't their phones online?

385
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,592
Will have been destroyed
so as not to trace them.

386
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,634
Aren't the people in your family

387
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,997
constantly injecting each
other with tracking devices?

388
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,238
Normally, I would
say, "God, I hope not,"

389
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,676
but now I guess I can
see the advantages.

390
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,913
Have you ever hacked
a CCTV camera?

391
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,479
-No. Well, congratulations.

392
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,670
You're about to
learn the only upside

393
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,239
of a Russian surveillance state.

394
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,674
Okay.

395
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,239
The shipment
should be here soon.

396
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,791
What made you wait till
now to give me your big pitch?

397
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,958
I'm guessing Connor told you
something bad about me in the future.

398
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,000
Not just about you.

399
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,070
Tell me.

400
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,992
William finds you on Lian Yu

401
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,955
after being there for years,

402
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,713
apparently, in some
self-imposed exile.

403
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,274
I never get rid of my bloodlust?

404
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,669
You knew all that, and you still
thought you could come save me?

405
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,274
Because there's
more to your story.

406
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,794
You may have started
on Lian Yu, Roy,

407
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,189
but that's not where you ended.

408
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,674
Felicity sent William
to that island to find you

409
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,989
because she believed in you.

410
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,358
You go back to Star City,
man. You work with the kids.

411
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,954
You help them
save the city, Roy.

412
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,435
How is that possible?

413
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,319
Because you found the
way to control your bloodlust.

414
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,596
You found that it was
by being part of a team.

415
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,717
You kept your distance because
you believed that you were a danger

416
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,190
to everyone around
you, but the real danger

417
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,593
was believing that you can
deal with your past alone.

418
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,395
It's pretty ballsy

419
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,278
thinking you can give me
the answer 20 years earlier.

420
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,034
Yeah, well, hopefully, this time,
you don't have to wait that long.

421
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,994
Don't touch her.

422
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,079
Itold you everything
that I know!

423
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,270
We will see.

424
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,110
On the line.

425
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,390
No.

426
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,435
Mia, no.

427
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,916
Mi--Mi--Mia!

428
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,430
Ring the bell.

429
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,319
You have 60 seconds.

430
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,630
Begin.

431
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,194
Time is up.

432
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,594
I needed to make sure

433
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,078
you weren't lying
about the drive.

434
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,680
Got it. CCTV footage of
Mia and Dad being taken

435
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,717
into a warehouse on
the east side of town.

436
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,680
Thank you, illegal
Russian satellites.

437
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,717
Great. Well, let's go save day.

438
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,030
Are you ok?

439
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,474
I should've been able to do it.

440
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,993
Oh, I should have
enough slack now.

441
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,430
To do what?

442
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,310
Aah! Uh!

443
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,550
What the hell?

444
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,800
I can dislocate my thumbs.

445
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,317
It's a useful technique
if getting tied to a chair

446
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,595
is gonna become a habit.

447
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,592
You have got to teach
me how to do that.

448
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,234
So you not ring bell.

449
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,395
Still, very impressive
to, uh, not die.

450
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,191
You shouldn't have told
them what was on the drive.

451
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,274
They would've
killed you if I didn't.

452
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,350
Or we would've been
able to escape without you

453
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,749
~giving up the information. Mia.

454
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,719
Okay, can we please just
save the family squabble

455
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,149
until after we have the plans?

456
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,072
Oleg's bound to figure
out how much they're worth.

457
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,390
Well, he's smart businessman.

458
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,480
He will figure
out way to sell it.

459
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,194
We need to figure
out when and where

460
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,112
the sale is happening, and
then we go recover the drive.

461
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,680
Let me guess.

462
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,391
Me and William get
to stay at the bar, right?

463
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,354
You're going home, both of you.

464
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,910
No.

465
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,433
I have a feeling there's
less drama out here.

466
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,590
Yeah.

467
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,750
What do you mean, "no"?

468
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,838
I'm sorry, Dad, but
we just saved you

469
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,673
from being murdered
by a bunch of gangsters.

470
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,989
I'm on team Mia here.

471
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,589
Yeah, but Mia just got
kidnapped by the Bratva.

472
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,953
-So did you.
-I'm your father, all right?

473
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,676
It is my primary
job in the world

474
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,870
to protect you.

475
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,394
We don't need that.

476
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,836
In the future, we're the
ones that are saving the city.

477
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,274
Well, this isn't the future!

478
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,158
This is months after

479
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,237
I was heartbroken
right before I left...

480
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,993
that I couldn't get
you on the phone

481
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,480
at your grandparents'.

482
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,390
So I walked into your room
to look at you one last time,

483
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,995
and you looked back
at me from your crib.

484
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,038
And because you made
the choice to protect us,

485
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,992
I had to spend my
whole life alone.

486
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,316
I didn't have a chance
to get to know my brother,

487
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,515
to get to know you.

488
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,273
I'm sorry that it
worked out that way.

489
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,951
And both of you can decide
on your own how much--

490
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,315
how much you want to hate me

491
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,312
and how much blame
you want to assign.

492
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,836
But I made a promise to
your mother to keep you safe.

493
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,877
And there--there is no world,

494
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,792
there is no universe,
there's no past,

495
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,356
present, or future
where I break it.

496
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,270
Fine.

497
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,070
You ready?

498
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,670
As I'll ever be.

499
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,110
Let's go!

500
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,469
Must be some kind
of tamper alarm.

501
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,837
I'll get the payload.
-['ll keep watch.

502
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,272
Hey, hey! Hey.

503
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,117
Hey, Roy. Roy, look at me, man.

504
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,355
Look at me!

505
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,189
Roy, you're all right.

506
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,111
Y--you got it?

507
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,679
Ido. It's right here.

508
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,120
Let's get the hell out of here.

509
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,709
-Any word from your contact?
-Nyet.

510
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,752
Oh, these things take time.

511
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,233
I don't know about you, but

512
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,193
I could handle drink
without umbrella.

513
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,349
I'm good, thank you.

514
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,912
If by good, you mean--
how you say--moody,

515
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,999
yes, you are.

516
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,911
Is this because you
ruin family vacation?

517
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,157
I have to send them
home for their protection.

518
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,589
Do you not think
they can handle it?

519
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,629
They can handle it. I just--

520
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,436
I want to keep them
away from the Bratva.

521
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,274
You mean keep them
away from your Bratva past.

522
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,155
Dark time for me.

523
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,919
That is understandable.

524
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,510
You are ashamed.

525
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,310
You have truly done
some terrible things.

526
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,269
Thank you for the reminder.

527
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,997
But you also have
done some good things.

528
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,479
It's important that
the kids see both.

529
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,878
Right, but why would I
want to share some of the...

530
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,639
worst mistakes of my
entire life with my children?

531
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,358
That is the thing
about teaching.

532
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,633
It's not about what
you want to say.

533
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,196
It's about what
they need to hear.

534
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,674
Remember first
thing I taught you?

535
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,633
Living is not for the weak.

536
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,395
Your children are
not weak, Oliver.

537
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,033
They're also not children.

538
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,358
Whatever it is you have to say,

539
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,400
they can handle it.

540
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,356
If you do not, they will
never learn to be heroes.

541
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,960
Oof. It would suck
to be that door.

542
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,833
If you're here to give me
a pep talk or whatever,

543
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,035
just don't.

544
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,349
Don't flatter yourself,

545
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,470
I just couldn't stand the
smell of that stale bar anymore.

546
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,840
It smells like cabbage.

547
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,190
That's one more thing I
won't miss about this place.

548
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,199
So you're actually going home.

549
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,629
Why wouldn't I? Dad
doesn't want me here.

550
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,991
Oh, God. I can't
stand pity parties.

551
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,719
Easy for you to say.

552
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,275
And why is that?

553
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,519
You're the Black Canary.

554
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,953
All I've ever heard are stories
about how great you are.

555
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,757
In the future, you
even save me once

556
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,593
like it was nothing.

557
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,958
Are you sure that's actually
me you're talking about?

558
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,911
Okay, you can cut
the false modesty.

559
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,836
Some people are
cut out to be heroes,

560
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,680
others not so much.

561
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,353
Is this really all because you
didn't ring some stupid bell?

562
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,431
Well, I couldn't
save Zoe either.

563
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,275
Every time I try and
live up to my dad

564
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,269
or to prove that I can
do what it is you all do,

565
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,000
1-l fail.

566
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,435
Do you think your
father is any better?

567
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,589
If you're trying to
live up to us, don't.

568
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,909
We are just as flawed as anyone,

569
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,910
especially me.

570
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,671
All you can do is
live up to yourself.

571
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,669
What does that even mean?

572
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,356
Are you really the type of
person that just gives up?

573
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,830
Oh, good.

574
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,997
Do we have time for one
more fight before we leave?

575
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,915
I'm not looking for a fight.

576
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,195
Then stop trying
to send us home.

577
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,390
We're not leaving.

578
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,474
Good because I need your help.

579
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,590
Oleg is selling drive
during bloodbath tonight.

580
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,194
And how are we
supposed to get in?

581
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,110
They know our faces.

582
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,953
Right. We use that
to our advantage.

583
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,753
You and I are going in
the ring together as a team.

584
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,993
You would be helping us get in.

585
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,832
Sorry. I did not have
time to get it dry cleaned.

586
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,957
I'm really more of a behind
the screen kind of guy,

587
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,878
but wow. That is
a nice suit. Huh.

588
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,913
What exactly will
Anatoly and I be doing

589
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,033
while you two are playing
father/daughter fight club moment?

590
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,033
When Oleg realizes that
it's the two of us in the ring,

591
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,679
that'll cause a distraction.

592
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,029
You guys go and steal the drive.

593
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,590
What do you say?

594
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,310
Well, I'm in.

595
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,869
Fancy rich guy is the
role Iwas born to play.

596
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,590
You?

597
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,035
Why the hell not?

598
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,950
Suit up.

599
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,313
Now I see why they
call it the bloodbath.

600
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,515
You sure about this?

601
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,717
Just get us in, please.

602
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,190
Not from you, American.

603
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,509
Well, if it's not about money,

604
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,194
then how about stakes?

605
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,159
Has anyone survived
6 men before?

606
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,470
Nyet.

607
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,278
My guys will fight 6.

608
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,599
You fight next.

609
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,869
Do we really need to be
setting records tonight?

610
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,391
You like a challenge,
right? Just please don't die.

611
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,355
Anatoly, you guys set?

612
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,838
Da. But no sign of high rollers.

613
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,230
Now is good time to strike.

614
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,990
How much time do we have?

615
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,389
Five minutes give or take.

616
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,353
Well, this is gonna be fun,

617
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,550
I've seen what
you can do in there,

618
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,759
so just trust your
instincts, okay? I do.

619
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,235
Nyet..

620
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,875
That's our cue.

621
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,392
Pakhan will still be protected.

622
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,518
I'll deal with the muscle.

623
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,478
You just watch my back.

624
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,077
Tick-tock. You guys
have the plans yet?

625
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,232
Don't move or I'll shoot.

626
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,198
You said watch back.

627
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,272
I got it. Let's move.

628
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,118
I could actually
get used to this.

629
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,998
Congratulations. Now
you my favorite American.

630
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,595
Hey, don't get too excited. He
has a lot of favorite Americans.

631
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,550
Did you talk to John?

632
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,600
1 did. He got the plutonium
with an assist from Roy.

633
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,393
All we have to do is
whip up an energy wave

634
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,200
to destroy an all-knowing
space being. Easy.

635
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,238
Before that, I would
like to propose a toast

636
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,040
to Mia and William.

637
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,200
Couldn't have done
this without you.

638
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,235
Vashe zdorovie.

639
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,273
Actually, here we say prochnost.

640
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,990
Prochnost?

641
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,993
Prochnost. It means strength.

642
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,554
It means a lot more than that.

643
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,231
Um, would you mind
giving me a minute

644
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,390
with these two, please?

645
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,595
- Yes.
- Sure.

646
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,035
Ah. Leave the bottle.

647
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,591
I know that I haven't really
spoken to the two of you

648
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,513
about my time in Russia.

649
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,556
And that is because there
are some things that I did here

650
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,674
that I'm not very proud of.

651
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,389
As I'm coming to grips with the
fact that the two of you are grown up,

652
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,920
I'm realizing that

653
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,193
shielding you from the bad

654
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,429
isn't going to do our
relationships any good.

655
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,759
From this point forward,
whatever you want to know,

656
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,630
whatever you might want
to ask me is fair game, okay?

657
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,430
Like dislocating your thumbs?

658
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,749
‘Cause I can't
believe I missed that.

659
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,672
Maybe something
a little less painful.

660
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,311
What about that
island you were on?

661
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,478
It's Lian Yu.

662
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,434
It's Mandarin for "purgatory."

663
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,115
You think that'll be enough?

664
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,557
Yeah, well, this
should do the trick.

665
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,834
Roy, thanks for your help, man.

666
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,713
It was good having
you back, even if it was

667
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,598
just for one last mission.

668
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,719
I think I'm gonna stick
around for a while.

669
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,993
If you're gonna be
taking on a space god,

670
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,071
I figure you might need
all the help you can get.

671
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,795
I'm glad you changed your mind.

672
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,438
You know, when
I first met Oliver,

673
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,311
he gave me a purpose,

674
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,437
but he also gave me all of you.

675
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,679
It makes sense
that having a team is

676
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,229
what helps me in the
future, so why wait?

677
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,079
Besides, you know, 1
kind of miss this place.

678
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,274
Welcome back, Roy.

679
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,153
Don't forget to send me that
picture of my dad with that haircut.

680
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,551
Don't forget to ask
about Bratva tattoo.

681
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,869
We have matching.

682
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,519
Used to. Used to, actually.

683
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,718
Oh, ho. I'm gonna need to
hear that story immediately.

684
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,395
Thank you.

685
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,994
I always seem to
end up in your debt.

686
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,634
We are beyond keeping score.

687
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,200
We have been friends,
we have been enemies.

688
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,438
From now on, let
us just be brothers.

689
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,590
Not the Bratva kind.

690
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,833
No! Real family, like
the one you have now.

691
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,592
I can be the fun uncle.

692
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,993
Being father really suits you.

693
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,555
Good-bye, brother.

694
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,677
Thank you. Good-bye, Oliver.

695
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,478
All right. Let's go.

696
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,871
Oh, Laurel, uh...

697
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,678
there's something I want to say.

698
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,470
What? One last hilarious
Russian joke for the road?

699
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,869
Sorry to doubt you,

700
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,789
I guess leopards
really can change spots.

701
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,991
Or in your case, bird, feather.

702
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,033
I thought you said you
weren't sentimental.

703
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,999
Maybe I change, too, like you.

704
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,591
Did you bring the plans?

705
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,274
About that.

706
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,559
I have decided not to join you

707
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,472
and your cosmic fashion tragedy

708
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,994
that you're in cahoots with.

709
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,833
Then you won't
get your Earth back.

710
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,514
If saving it means going back
to the person that I used to be,

711
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,432
then what the hell is the point?

712
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,553
You really have changed.

713
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,632
Look, I'm new to this whole
doing the right thing game,

714
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,792
but you should really
tell your family the truth.

715
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,590
Not yet.

716
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,918
Then this is gonna
be a little awkward.

717
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,239
1 didn't want to believe it.

718
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,030
I'm sorry.

719
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,832
Lyla, what have you--
what have you done?

720
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,794
Greg, move your head.
