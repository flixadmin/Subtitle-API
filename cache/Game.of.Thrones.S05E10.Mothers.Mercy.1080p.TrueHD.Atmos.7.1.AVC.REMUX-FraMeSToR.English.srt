330
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,618
Just as long as he promises
not to kill me in my sleep.

331
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:17,996
If I ever kill you, your eyes will be wide open.

332

DAARIO: Forgive me,
but why would we bring you?

333
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,502
Pardon me?

334
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,504
Have you ever tracked
animals in the wilderness?

335
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,507
Not precisely,
but I have other skills that would be useful.

336
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,091
Can you fight?

337
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,010
I have fought.

338
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,678
I don't claim to be a great warrior.

339
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,971
Are you good on a horse?

340
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,265
Middling.

341
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,600
So mainly you talk.

342
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:41,853
And drink. I've survived so far.

343
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:45,774
Which I respect,
but you would not help us on this expedition.

344
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,902
You would help us here in Meereen, though.

345
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,198
None of us have experience
governing a city except for him.

346
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,535
You want to prove your value to the queen?
Prove it right here in Meereen.

347
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:59,204
He's a foreign dwarf
that barely speaks the language.

348
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,830
Why would the Meereenese listen to him?

349
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,415
They wouldn't.

350
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,584
They will listen to Grey Worm.

351
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,336
I'll come with you.

352
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,338
I'll find our queen.

353
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,840
- You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
- I am.

354
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,260
He is. He's the toughest man
with no balls I ever met.

355
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,804
But you still can't go.

The people believe in you.

357
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,975
They know you speak for the queen.

358
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:21,810
It's true.

359
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,979
Only the Unsullied
can keep the peace in Meereen.

360
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:27,399
If you leave,
half this city will consume the other half.

361
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,900
And Missandei.

362
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,695
Our queen trusts no one
more than Missandei.

363
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,573
Certainly not me.

364
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,409
The queen's closest confidante,

365
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,828
the commander of the Unsullied,

366

Try not to ruin her.

Looks like it's you and me, Jorah the Andal.

378
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:52,651
They tell me you've already found favor
with the Mother of Dragons.

379
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:55,487
Well, she didn't execute me,

380
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,739
so that's a promising start.

381
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:01,159
Now the heroes are off to find her,

382
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,536
and I'm stuck here

383

trying to placate a city
on the brink of civil war.
