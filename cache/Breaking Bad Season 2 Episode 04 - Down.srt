2
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:52,727
Hey, Captain America.

3
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,071
- What's up, brother?
- Hey, bro.

4
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,335
This is stupid.

5
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:21,425
- You got a better idea?
- Okay, fun. Whatever.

6
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,761
- So when do we, you know?
- We don't, for now.

7
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,185
No cooking until things settle down.

8
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:31,265
Settle down? I thought you're the one
that said nothing's changed.

9
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,608
Look, I just put my family
through an ordeal...

10
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,281
...that they're just now
starting to accept, okay? I can't...

11
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,073
That's too expensive.

12
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,120
Look, I can't leave my house...

13
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,712
...for more than 20 minutes
without my wife worrying.

14
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,753
I need time to mend fences.

15
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,802
Okay, so while you're fixing fences,
what about me, huh?

16
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,634
Your A-hole brother-in-law
took all my money.

17
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,573
That's $600.

18
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,157
Okay, what about the rest?

19
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,823
- Rest of what?
- Half your money's mine.

20
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,245
Fifty-fifty partners.
That's our business motto.

21
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,624
Meaning what, exactly?
That I suffer for your carelessness?

22
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,793
You're the one who wanted
to work with Tuco.

23
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,875
Okay. If it weren't for that,
none of this would've happened.

24
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,509
Just be cool.
We'll talk about this later, okay?

25
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:49,434
As for now, no contact. Understood?

26
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,019
Where are you going?

27
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,027
I leave first.

28
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:17,294
- Walt!
- In the kitchen.

29
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:33,976
Hey.

30
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:38,316
Hey. I didn't know
you were allowed to touch the stove.

31
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:41,814
Hilarious, Groucho.
Go on, grab a seat.

32
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,574
Juice is on the table.

33
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,117
What?

34
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,126
- Good morning, honey.
- Hey, Mom.

35
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,874
Dad's cooking breakfast.

36
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,924
But don't worry.
I'm also doing all the dishes.

37
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,384
Nice? Follow me.

38
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,597
There's also orange juice
and grapefruit juice...

39
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,762
...which, personally, as you know,
I've never been a fan of.

40
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:15,106
But considering all the polyphenols
and the limonoids, can't hurt.

41
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:19,099
Walt, you didn't have to do this.

42
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,649
I wanted to.

43
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,826
- Grapefruit juice?
- Yes, please. Thanks.

44
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,576
There you go. Honey?

45
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,115
No, I'll stick with orange, thank you.

46
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:39,830
All right. Dig in, dig in.
Pancakes are not getting hotter.

47
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,584
- Yeah.
- There you go.

48
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,291
All right. Got one. Steely Dan.

49
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,465
- No.
- Yes, absolutely.

50
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,254
No, in terms of pure musicianship...

51
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,311
...I would put them up against
any current band you can name.

52
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,058
You wouldn't know
any current bands.

53
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,390
- That's besides the point.
- Have a good day, honey.

54
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,152
You too.

55
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,649
- Boz Scaggs. There's another one.
- Boz Scaggs.

56
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,365
Whoever they are.
Bye. Thanks for breakfast.

57
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:10,574
- Bye.
- You're welcome.

58
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,365
Tell Louis to drive carefully.

59
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,992
All right.

60
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,287
Our son doesn't know
who Boz Scaggs is.

61
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,747
We have failed as parents.

62
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,463
Come to think of it...

63
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,298
- ...I barely know who Boz Scaggs is.
- Stop it.

64
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:30,679
Give me your plate.
No, no. I'll get it. I'll get it. Yeah.

65
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,302
Thank you.

66
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,929
Hey, listen...

67
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,353
...in the calendar section...

68
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:41,017
...all week long...

69
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,567
...there's a fiction writer's seminar
at UNM.

70
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:49,150
And, you know, probably talking
about how to get published...

71
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,859
- ...and that sort of thing.
- Yeah?

72
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:57,906
Yeah, so, anyway,
I thought maybe you might...

73
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,953
I mean, I'll go with you if you like.

74
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,508
Oh, and...

75
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:18,643
...you know, I was thinking about
what you asked me the other night.

76
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,181
You were wondering
if I had a second cell phone.

77
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,891
And, well, I've been
thinking about that a lot...

78
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:29,236
...and I think what you heard
was my cell phone alarm going off.

79
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:35,906
I've been using it a lot
as a medication reminder...

80
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:39,250
...to, well, remind me
to take my medication.

81
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:43,415
And, well, the weird thing is that...

82
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,414
...the alarm sound
is almost exactly the same...

83
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,754
...as the regular phone ring
which is really a poor design...

84
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,589
...if you ask me.
But I think that was probably it.

85
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,928
I tried to go in
and change it to a different sound...

86
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,434
...other than the phone ring, but...

87
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,815
They so overcomplicate
these things.

88
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:09,444
Anyway, it was probably
just as well that I lost it.

89
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,815
There's gotta be a new one
on the market by now.

90
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:16,867
You know, if we do this thing
at UNM, maybe on the way home...

91
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,117
...we can stop by,
and I can get a new cell phone.

92
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,171
Skyler?

93
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,472
Skyler?

94
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,486
- Ready?
- Yo, for what, might help.

95
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,208
Not another intervention.

96
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,502
Jesse Bruce Pinkman...

97
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,555
...pursuant to Section 47-8-13...

98
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,722
...of the New Mexico
Real Property Code...

99
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,842
...you are hereby
given notice to vacate...

100
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,603
...the premises listed as 9809 Margo,
Albuquerque, 87104.

101
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:10,065
Wait. What? You're kicking me
out of my own house?

102
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,685
- It's your aunt Ginny's house.
- And she gave it to me.

103
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:14,399
She never gave it to you, Jesse.

104
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,366
You were allowed
residentiary privileges.

105
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:20,826
Your parents have always
been the property owners.

106
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:24,738
Look, we talked about this, okay?
I'd sell the house, we'd split it fifty-fifty.

107
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,366
That was the deal.
What the hell happened?

108
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:30,255
What happened is
you're a speed manufacturer.

109
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,753
No, I'm not. What?

110
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,549
A DEA agent came
looking for you, Jesse.

111
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:39,051
He came to our front door.

112
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:46,093
Okay, because I've actually
been helping them...

113
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:50,097
...which I could get into
a lot of trouble for telling you...

114
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,274
...so you're welcome.

115
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,644
I saw your basement.

116
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:56,770
Oh, yeah.

117
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,858
I was worried, so I went
over there and I let myself in...

118
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:05,455
...and I found your laboratory.

119
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,452
You guys have your own key?

120
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:20,420
Manufacture of a Schedule ll
controlled substance...

121
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,381
...is a second degree felony.

122
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,846
Under federal asset seizure...

123
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:30,229
...the government can take
the entire house.

124
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:34,107
It's not even there anymore.
I cleaned it all out.

125
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,810
Son, we can't stop you
from ruining your life...

126
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,446
...but you will not drag us down
with you.

127
00:11:40,868 --> 00:11:43,619
Vacate the house in 72 hours.

128
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,821
Otherwise,
your parents have authorized me...

129
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,455
...to contact the authorities.
Is that clear?

130
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,250
Do you have any questions for us?

131
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,341
Three days, Mr. Pinkman.

132
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,715
Come on.

133
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,971
- Hi.
- Hey.

134
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:55,556
- I fixed the garage door.
- Great.

135
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,187
Yeah.

136
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,072
One track was bent.
That's why it was bouncing.

137
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,822
Okay.

138
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:06,744
- Where were you today?
- Out.

139
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,459
Is everything okay?

140
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,470
Yeah, everything's fine.

141
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:44,609
Hey, for what it's worth, I was thinking
about going back to those meetings...

142
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,699
...the cancer support group.

143
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,737
I think that that's good.

144
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:51,617
Yeah.

145
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,741
Yeah, that's good.

146
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,915
You were right
on the money about that.

147
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:00,414
It's good to, you know...

148
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,381
...talk about things.

149
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:06,010
I think that's great.

150
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,725
Yeah.

151
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,081
Jesse.

152
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:45,165
Jesse. Hey, Jesse.

153
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,876
You don't answer your phone?

154
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:51,465
Yeah, no, I've just been...

155
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,305
...pretty busy. How'd you...?

156
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,268
Oh, right, you have that key.

157
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,813
Hey, listen.

158
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,231
So I've been thinking
a lot about our conversation...

159
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:08,859
...we had the other day,
and I completely get why...

160
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:12,409
...Dad totally tweaked off on me
like that and...

161
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:16,322
- It's not just your father, Jesse.
- No, I know. I know. I know.

162
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:21,749
I'm just saying it was a really,
really big wake-up call for me...

163
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:24,918
...which is why I wanted to talk
to you. You know, I've been...

164
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,549
...thinking real seriously
about business school, actually.

165
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,218
You can do the whole thing
from your computer now...

166
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,931
No, Mom, Mom.
Hey, hey, this is good.

167
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:38,892
You know, we're talking,
starting a dialogue.

168
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:42,439
The time for talking
has passed, Jesse.

169
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,853
Hey. Hey.

170
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,446
What the hell, yo?

171
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:50,823
- I thought it was just a wake-up call.
- We are putting it in storage.

172
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,241
When you decide to grow up,
you can have it back.

173
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,742
Why don't you grow up, Mom?

174
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:59,076
Ginny wanted me here.
I was the one who took care of her.

175
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:02,578
I took her to her appointments
and made her lunch every day.

176
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,041
I earned this.

177
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:06,581
You did not make
her lunch every day.

178
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,544
What did you do, huh?

179
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,430
She's lying there dying,
and where the hell are you?

180
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,927
- Don't start with me.
- Now what?

181
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:17,426
You've decided to, I don't know,
make your eldest son homeless?

182
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,887
Great family, Mom.

183
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,023
Why are you like this? Why?

184
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:39,529
You have two sets of keys
and the padlock to the garage.

185
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,573
Leave them on the kitchen counter
when you leave.

186
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:44,170
No, Mom, Mom, Mom.

187
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,464
Hey, where am I supposed to go?

188
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,965
I don't know, sweetheart.

189
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:57,463
But please turn your life around.

190
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:02,806
Yeah, this is gonna help
bigtime with that. Bitch!

191
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,934
Jeez.

192
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,487
Oh, hey, Mr. White.

193
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,459
Hey, well, that's the way.
Don't just sit out there honking.

194
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:24,997
Come in and say hello.

195
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:28,082
Hey, we've got omelettes.
You want an omelette?

196
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,336
No, I'm good.

197
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,504
New Mexican Christmas style,
red and green chillies.

198
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,593
No. Thank you, though.

199
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,514
Flynn and me gotta get going.

200
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,516
- Who's Flynn?
- Flynn.

201
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,685
He's your...

202
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,726
- Flynn?
- Yeah.

203
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:50,522
So?

204
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,612
So? Nothing.

205
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,441
- You ready?
- Like it.

206
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,368
- Bye, Mr. White.
- Okay.

207
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:01,747
Bye.

208
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,080
Flynn? You know about this
Flynn thing?

209
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:20,130
Okay. Flynn. Yeah.
As in what, Errol?

210
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,600
I don't know. It's what he likes
to be called these days.

211
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,686
What's wrong with Walter Jr.?

212
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:27,890
Don't take it personally.

213
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:31,065
He wants his own identity.

214
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:39,152
You think he told Louis about me?

215
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:42,821
- About the blackout?
- Louis is his friend, Walt...

216
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,613
...and your disappearance
upset him.

217
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:53,123
Hey, I made omelettes.

218
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,880
I'm going out, but thanks, though.

219
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:57,637
Where you going?

220
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:01,220
Can you get the phone, please?

221
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:06,100
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

222
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:14,268
- White residence.
- Yo, it's me. Is this a good time?

223
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:18,648
What part of "no contact"
didn't you understand?

224
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,987
- I know, but there's a problem.
- I don't care. We agreed.

225
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:25,288
No amount of pay-per-view channels
is gonna make any difference.

226
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,788
Honey, we're happy
with our cable provider, right?

227
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,874
Yeah, we're happy.

228
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,958
Skyler? Sky?

229
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:42,302
Where are you going?
Can you at least tell me that?

230
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:43,927
Out.

231
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:49,017
Should probably get that, Walt.
I'll be back in a few hours.

232
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,225
Skyler.

233
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,739
- What?
- Yo, I get I shouldn't call...

234
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,406
...but I'm in a situation here,
and I need my money.

235
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,327
I just gave you $600.

236
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:05,818
And thanks, Daddy Warbucks...

237
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,115
...but that was
before my housing situation...

238
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,456
...went completely
testicular on me, okay?

239
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:12,662
You smoked the entire 600,
didn't you?

240
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,160
- What? No.
- Yes.

241
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,460
- No.
- Look, Jesse...

242
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:17,216
...your problems are just that:

243
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,086
Your problems.

244
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:22,007
No contact. Do not call here ever.

245
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:26,090
- When the moment is right, I will call.
- Mr. White, you're not listening.

246
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,516
They're kicking me out of my house.

247
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:41,692
You son of a bitch.

248
00:20:46,205 --> 00:20:48,411
Son of a bitch.

249
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,367
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much.

250
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:55,540
Thanks, man. Hey, guy!
You forgot something! Yeah!

251
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:59,374
You forgot your ice trays!
You're gonna need the ice trays!

252
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:02,962
Hey, you forgot something here!
Take this!

253
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:44,840
Hold on, buddy.

254
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:48,258
Yo, we should get Twaughthammer
up and running again, yo. I'm serious.

255
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,598
I know. That sounded tight.

256
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:52,638
Hey, thanks again, P.

257
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:56,852
I made sure this stucknut exterminator,
you know, put me on his speed dial.

258
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:58,182
Two nights tops.

259
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,809
No, you still staying
at your aunt's on Margo?

260
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,520
Yeah. I'm thinking of moving.
Nob Hill, probably.

261
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:07,075
Jess-a-matic. Living the dream.

262
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,366
Yeah.

263
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,746
Okay, buddy. You're gonna eat your
carrots like we talked about, right?

264
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:13,954
Too hot.

265
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:17,204
No, no, buddy. Remember. Okay?
Come on, yes.

266
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:18,832
Listen, hey, talk to me, man.

267
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,538
Are you still having
mad relations out there?

268
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:23,881
You can talk to me.
I won't hate a player.

269
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:28,886
I can't lie. It's pretty hectic
out there, female-wise.

270
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:32,305
Damn. I'm hating, man.

271
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,437
That's why we need to get the Hammer
up and running, you know?

272
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:39,230
- Get you out of the house.
- How awesome would that be?

273
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:41,103
Come on. Look. What?

274
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:44,820
I cut all the green parts off like you...
Just eat them. Please?

275
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:48,614
We should do this. Track down
Cheevo and Anthony and demo up.

276
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:49,942
Get back in the scene.

277
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,993
I'm sorry, man.
Just hold on one second, all right?

278
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:56,291
Okay, listen. How about
you take a bite of your sandwich...

279
00:22:56,502 --> 00:22:58,161
...and then you take...

280
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:00,960
Mommy's home.

281
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,046
- Hi.
- Hello.

282
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,667
Hey, honey, you remember
Jesse Pinkman?

283
00:23:07,596 --> 00:23:10,680
His house is getting bug bombed.
I said he could crash a few nights.

284
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,800
- Hey, Jesse.
- Hey.

285
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:15,509
Paul, could you help me
in the bedroom with these?

286
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:20,108
Sure. Yeah.

287
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,712
Yeah, I used to not like carrots, too.

288
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:51,761
Hey, Hen, I think
it's someone's nap time. Come on.

289
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:04,525
Man, dude, you're gonna kill me.

290
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:09,363
I totally spaced that the in-laws
are crashing this weekend.

291
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:10,985
You got other people to call?

292
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:13,573
No, that's cool.
I got tons of people. Yeah.

293
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,910
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

294
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,581
Yo, in-laws?

295
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:23,577
- Sucks to be you, P.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know, huh?

296
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:26,298
Here.

297
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:27,919
See you, man.

298
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,127
It's good to see you.

299
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:35,424
Look, I'm asking to crash three,
maybe four nights, and...

300
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:38,596
Look, I already called Badger,
all right? I called everyone.

301
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:41,268
I need a solid here, bro.

302
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:43,935
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

303
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:49,104
All right. All right.
Hey, how about this?

304
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:52,022
What if it's just for tonight?

305
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:12,797
Wait. No, you cannot be serious.

306
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:16,097
- You cannot be serious.
- Hey.

307
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:19,466
Someone took your bike, man.

308
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,679
Not cool.

309
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:38,668
- Morning.
- Oh, hey.

310
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:40,261
Morning.

311
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:43,591
Where did...? Where did Mom go?

312
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:47,100
Out.

313
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:55,558
Where's breakfast?

314
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:00,853
Hey.

315
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:03,902
Let's go do something.

316
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,780
Like what?

317
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:09,824
Something fun.

318
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,628
All right, ready? Let's put it in gear.

319
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:18,883
- Is your foot on the... Okay. Good.
- Yeah. I got it.

320
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:23,258
Good.

321
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:27,090
Yes. Nice and smooth. Good.
Just like that.

322
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:30,888
Good. I like the hands at 10 and 2.
Very nice.

323
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,393
Okay, let's slow down here...

324
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:36,727
...to a stop in preparation
for a left-hand turn. Okay.

325
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:39,861
All right. You might wanna
go easier on the brake.

326
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:42,777
- Sorry about that.
- That's all right. You're doing fine.

327
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:46,906
- Much better than last time, huh?
- Oh, yeah, Louis has been helping me.

328
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:49,413
Has he?

329
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:51,948
Good. Good. Okay.

330
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,207
Don't forget the turn indic... Good.

331
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,827
I'll stop talking.
You know what you're doing.

332
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:59,882
And let's make that left-hand turn.

333
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,798
Nice and smooth. Very nice.

334
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,639
Right hand.

335
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:09,679
Good. Good. Okay.

336
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:16,144
- Are you using both feet?
- Yeah.

337
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:18,516
No. Wait. Wait. No, Walt.
You can't do that.

338
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,858
You can't use one foot
on each pedal.

339
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:23,776
- Why not?
- Because you can't. Stop, Walt. Okay.

340
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:28,736
- Just stop, please. Right. All right.
- Dad, this is way easier.

341
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:32,164
There's the easy way,
and then there's the right way, right?

342
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:35,458
So let's just try it again,
right foot only.

343
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:37,377
- All right.
- Okay?

344
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:45,383
Okay, just... You don't have to...
Okay. All right. That's fine.

345
00:30:45,596 --> 00:30:48,466
Just... That's okay. That's okay.
Just try it again.

346
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:52,466
Here we go.
Let's just, just try it again.

347
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,931
Okay.

348
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:58,516
Don't... Just easy.
Okay, okay, good. Great.

349
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:01,225
That was better. See?
Right? Better? Right.

350
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:03,153
The gas, the brake,
the gas, the brake.

351
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:04,822
I can't do this.

352
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,198
My legs don't work that way.

353
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:10,244
Your legs are fine.
You just have to stick with it.

354
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:13,371
Don't set limits for yourself, Walt.
You're all right.

355
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:16,998
All right. We'll get this. I promise.
Now let's just try again. All right?

356
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:19,369
- All right.
- Here we go. Here we go.

357
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:24,461
Okay, well, you don't need to,
you know, just take off.

358
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:27,428
But all right, here we go.
Slow it down just a little bit.

359
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:32,300
All right, we have a turn coming up
here, so prepare to apply the brakes.

360
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:34,843
Prepare, Walt, for the brakes.
Brakes, the brakes.

361
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:36,853
- Braking.
- You're using both feet again.

362
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:39,352
- It's not stopping.
- That's the gas. Use the brake.

363
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:41,358
The break. Brake, brake, brake!

364
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,865
Okay.

365
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:50,283
That's one way to stop.

366
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,030
I told you.

367
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:54,705
Flynn.

368
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:06,776
- Hands up, asshole!
- Yo, yo, it's cool.

369
00:33:06,987 --> 00:33:08,612
So help me, I will spread you.

370
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:11,906
No, please, no, all right?
It's me, okay? It's Jesse.

371
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:14,949
All right? Look, this is my RV.

372
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:17,783
You towed it.
Your cousin Badger, remember?

373
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:19,907
What the hell you doing here?

374
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:24,118
- You smell like shit.
- It's a long story.

375
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:26,829
So I fixed up your felonious
rolling laboratory here...

376
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:28,247
...750 for the repair.

377
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:31,670
Make it a grand, counting the toilet
plus the 500 you already owe me...

378
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:36,632
...and you're good to drive on out of
here to someplace far away. Upwind.

379
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,261
Okay.

380
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:40,555
Here's the thing.

381
00:33:40,771 --> 00:33:42,146
I can't pay you today.

382
00:33:42,356 --> 00:33:44,728
But I can pay you this week,
all right?

383
00:33:44,942 --> 00:33:50,944
Seventeen fifty? We'll make it 1750,
for, like, you know, interest.

384
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:54,074
- I thought your word was your bond.
- It totally is.

385
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:57,902
Definitely. I just don't have
the money at this particular moment.

386
00:33:58,163 --> 00:34:01,449
But I will, soon.

387
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:03,874
Here's my counteroffer.

388
00:34:04,086 --> 00:34:07,206
I kick you out.
I take payment from your inventory.

389
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:10,044
I know a guy that'll pay
premium for this kind of crap.

390
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:13,758
All right. Two grand. Okay?

391
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:17,505
Two days, two grand.
That's totally fair.

392
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:22,185
Just don't take my cook stuff.
All right? That's all I got left.

393
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:24,721
Please, all right? I really...

394
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:30,729
God, I really need a break here.
Okay?

395
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,698
Clovis, come on.

396
00:34:54,678 --> 00:34:57,845
I don't know.
There's a bunch of stuff in there.

397
00:34:58,056 --> 00:35:00,761
There's something called
methylamine. Me... Meth...

398
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:03,384
However the hell you pronounce it.
Methylamine.

399
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:06,854
I don't know. I banged on it.
It sounds pretty full to me.

400
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:15,897
Holy shit. How much?

401
00:35:22,915 --> 00:35:24,243
Hey! Hey!

402
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:00,606
Skyler.

403
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:09,450
Louis took Walt to school.

404
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,539
I was thinking maybe...

405
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:16,214
...this would be a good time to talk.

406
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:43,155
I dreamt that I owned
an antique bicycle repair shop.

407
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:46,746
In Ireland.

408
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:51,455
Weird.

409
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:55,672
Sounds weird.

410
00:37:09,146 --> 00:37:11,601
I wanted to apologise...

411
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:13,810
...for everything.

412
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:17,153
My...

413
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:20,687
...desire for privacy.

414
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:24,534
My emotional...

415
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:27,118
...unavailability.

416
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:31,833
Having cancer
doesn't excuse all that.

417
00:37:34,588 --> 00:37:36,331
I haven't been
a good partner to you...

418
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:40,216
...and for that...

419
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:42,963
...I'm very sorry.

420
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:46,891
I love you.

421
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:50,636
And I love this family.

422
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:54,064
And I just...

423
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,441
...want to make sure that...

424
00:37:57,444 --> 00:37:59,567
...we don't lose contact.

425
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:09,032
Thank you.

426
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,915
Okay.

427
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:17,672
I agree.

428
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:34,772
Is that it?

429
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:37,389
God.

430
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:39,768
God, how long are
you gonna do this?

431
00:38:40,362 --> 00:38:42,520
- Do what?
- This.

432
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:44,531
Not talking to me.

433
00:38:45,117 --> 00:38:48,237
Going out all day
and refusing to tell me where.

434
00:38:48,453 --> 00:38:50,695
You are obviously angry with me
about something...

435
00:38:50,914 --> 00:38:53,037
...so let's talk about it.

436
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:03,009
Oh, God.

437
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:08,260
I feel like you're upset with me
because you think...

438
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:11,759
...that I'm up to something.

439
00:39:13,729 --> 00:39:16,895
- Like what?
- I have no idea, Skyler.

440
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:20,310
What, that I'm having an affair?
Is that it? Is that what you think?

441
00:39:20,527 --> 00:39:22,567
Is that why you asked me
about the...

442
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:26,148
Some other phone? Because you think
that I'm being unfaithful?

443
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:30,194
- I don't know.
- Okay.

444
00:39:30,412 --> 00:39:32,286
So ask me.

445
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,249
Why?

446
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:38,787
- Would you even tell me?
- Yes. I would.

447
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:40,831
Of course, I would.

448
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:46,290
And no. I'm not.
I'm not having an affair, okay?

449
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:49,181
Now, what do I do
to prove that to you?

450
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:52,841
Swear an oath? My right hand
to God. I'm not having an affair.

451
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,851
I heard you, Walt.

452
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,179
You're not having an affair.

453
00:39:57,773 --> 00:39:59,018
Congratulations.

454
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:01,640
No, you know what?
Congratulations to you, Skyler.

455
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,939
Great job.

456
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:04,861
What is this? What do I have to do?

457
00:40:05,072 --> 00:40:08,986
- I'm trying to talk to you, and you...
- Okay, so talk, Walt.

458
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:13,822
Shut up and say something
that isn't complete bullshit.

459
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:17,997
You want to know
what you have to do?

460
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:22,255
You have to tell me
what's really going on right now.

461
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:25,299
Today. No more excuses.

462
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:29,507
No more apologies.
No more of these... These obvious...

463
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:32,295
...desperate breakfasts.

464
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:36,803
You don't wanna lose
contact with me, Walt?

465
00:40:37,104 --> 00:40:38,563
Good.

466
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:40,646
Then tell me.

467
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,728
Now.

468
00:40:55,163 --> 00:40:56,907
Tell you what?

469
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:04,462
Skyler.

470
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:10,586
What is it you want me to tell you?
I don't know.

471
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:23,096
We're not done here. Skyler.

472
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:26,774
Do you know what
I've done for this family?

473
00:41:32,451 --> 00:41:33,993
What the...?

474
00:41:48,926 --> 00:41:53,089
- Yo, I'm really sorry, okay?
- What is wrong with you?

475
00:41:53,305 --> 00:41:55,796
Why are you blue? Jesus.

476
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:59,432
I'm sorry. Let's just say it starts
with my parents being greedy...

477
00:41:59,645 --> 00:42:03,429
- ...kleptomaniac douche bags.
- Are you actually this stupid?

478
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:05,440
No, look. I know this isn't a optimal...

479
00:42:05,651 --> 00:42:09,779
To come to my house and park
on my street, driving this vehicle.

480
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:14,200
I mean, what the hell is wrong
with you? I'm really asking.

481
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:17,371
- Nothing. I'm sorry. I just...
- What if Skyler had seen you?

482
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:20,450
What then? What was the plan then,
genius, huh?

483
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:22,991
- I don't know.
- You know why you don't know?

484
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,368
Because you don't think. That's why.

485
00:42:25,587 --> 00:42:28,292
You don't think.
You never figured out how to think.

486
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:32,172
I said I was sorry. I just need
my half of the money, and I will go.

487
00:42:33,387 --> 00:42:34,798
Your half?

488
00:42:35,013 --> 00:42:37,504
There is no your half of the money.

489
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:40,262
There is only my all of it.
Do you understand?

490
00:42:40,477 --> 00:42:43,763
Why should I be penalized
because of your sloppiness?

491
00:42:43,981 --> 00:42:45,938
Look, that is completely uncool,
all right?

492
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:47,941
We agreed, fifty-fifty partners.

493
00:42:48,151 --> 00:42:51,188
Partners in what?
What exactly do you do here?

494
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:54,608
I've been meaning to ask,
because I'm the producer, right?

495
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:59,036
I cook. But from what I can tell,
you are just a drug addict.

496
00:42:59,246 --> 00:43:04,453
You are a pathetic junkie,
too stupid to understand and follow...

497
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:08,203
...simple rudimentary instructions.
Too stupid to re...

498
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:30,318
Do it.

499
00:43:57,888 --> 00:44:02,016
Try not to touch anything.

500
00:45:18,844 --> 00:45:20,671
Want some breakfast?

501
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,241
