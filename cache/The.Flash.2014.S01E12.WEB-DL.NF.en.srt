Honey. Honey.

2
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:13,514
Dana. Oh, God. Someone...

3
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,682
DANA: Help!
MAN: Please help us.

4
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,854
-Help!
DANA: Help us, please!

5
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:27,110
Get the power to that line shut down.
You guys, lay down the hose line.

6
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,571
DANA: Help! Help!
MAN: Help us.

7
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,532
FIREMAN: We're wasting time.
DANA: Help!

8
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,116

Hold on.

9
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,040
Stay here, all right?

10
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,416
I got you.

Hey.

12
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:48,382
No.

13
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,425
My wife!

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,431
Dana!

15
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,061
FIREMAN:
Everyone, back away.

16
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,027
How did...?

17
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,822
I love you.

18
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,951
Thank you, Flash.

19
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,254
Dude, that was insane.

20
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:31,925
I mean, even I'm having a hard time
getting mad at you for dirtying up my suit.

21
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:34,011
When are we gonna consider it my suit?

22
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,347
-I'd be comfortable calling it our suit.
-Okay. Our suit.

23
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,267
Tonight was the fastest you've ever run.

24
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,521
Yes, your training is paying off.
That couple is alive tonight because of you.

25
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,648
I can still get faster. I know I can.

26
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:52,362
And you will one day. But for today,
I'd say you fulfilled your saved quota.

27
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:55,574
Proper rest is what you need, as do we all.

28
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,911
Better yet, what we all need is
a proper drink. Who's up for a round?

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,292
Dude, it's movie night with Joe. I can't.
But I'll see you guys tomorrow, all right?

30
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,002
-Bye.
BARRY: Night.

31
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,630
What about you? Drinks on me?

32
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,548
CAITLIN:
I think I'll pass.

33
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,509
You okay?

34
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:20,515
I was looking for my tablet
at your workstation, and I found this.

35
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:27,230
You said we should stop looking for
Ronnie, so I didn't stop looking for Ronnie.

36
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,607
Why?

37
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,818
Hartley, he said he knew
what happened to Ronnie.

38
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,196
Hartley Rathaway?
Who is currently locked up...

39
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,032
...in our villain jail for going psycho
with sound waves?

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,826
Yeah, he's made some poor choices.
No argument there.

41
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,205
-But I looked into what he was saying and...
-Cisco, Ronnie's gone.

42
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,999
And it's time for me to move on with my life.

43
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,211
Doesn't seem like it.

44
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,214
What's that supposed to mean?

45
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:56,009
Look, I'm not an expert on love.

46
00:02:56,218 --> 00:03:00,055
But I think in order to move on
from Ronnie...

47
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,308
...you actually have to move on.

48
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,192
Breach, level two.

49
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,361
[ALARM BLARING]

50
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,531
GUARD:
Hold it right there!

51
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:06,913
Shawna?

52
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,540
GUARD:
There she is. Get her.

53
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,421
-Crazy cool, right?
-How did you do that?

54
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,672
Grab my hand.

55
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,229
-How the hell, Shawna?
-So you like?

56
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:32,939
Oh, I love.

57
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,947
Whoo!

58
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,913
Hey.

59
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,916
The security cameras
in half the prison are shut down.

60
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:57,005
Then Clay Parker, according to this log, who
was locked in his cell, somehow vanishes.

61
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,924
Not completely.

62
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:04,012
-What's that?
-It's a kind of organic particulate residual.

63
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:08,475
I found it on the floor in here,
just outside the cell, out in the hallway.

64
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,727
The trail led me all the way outside.

65
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,941
Dad.

66
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:32,582
So word around here is
Parker pulled a <i>Shawshank?</i>

67
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:37,295
Yep. And none of the other prisoners
heard or saw anything.

68
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,965
They wouldn't talk to you about it.

69
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,134
Leaves us with not a lot to go on.

70
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:48,139
Well, if there's anyone who could figure out
how Parker got out of here, it's you, son.

71
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:52,561
GUARD: Come on, Allen. Let's go.
-Duty calls.

72
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,698
So my dad just happened to come by?

73
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,908
The guard owed me a favor.

74
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,161
Thank you.

75
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:21,047
Thanks for getting me out of that hell hole.

76
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,049
You would have done the same, right?

77
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,968
So...

78
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:30,307
-...how the hell did this happen to you?
-Don't know.

79
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,894
After you got locked up,
I started not feeling right.

80
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:37,772
I was passing out for no reason.
Waking up in odd places.

81
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,734
Took me a while before I could control it.

82
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,778
As soon as I could...

83
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:47,824
...I came for you.

84
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,745
So you can just jump wherever you want?

85
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:55,624
If I can see where I'm going.
We got a second chance, Clay.

86
00:06:55,832 --> 00:07:00,629
We can leave Central City.
Do all the things we talked about.

87
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,883
I can't leave yet, baby.

88
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,303
I owe Marcus a lot of money.

89
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,723
I skip town before paying him back,
he'll find us.

90
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,018
But with what you can do...

91
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,438
...we can pay off that debt.

92
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,859
Then we'll be free
and we can go anywhere in the world.

93
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,903
Together.

94
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,664
Not even Barry's cells move this fast.
I've never seen anything like it.

95
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,624
So Clay Parker is a metahuman?

96
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:42,045
Not so fast.
The particulate residue that Barry gathered...

97
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:47,217
...at Iron Heights does contain Clay Parker's
DNA but also DNA of a woman.

98
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,929
BARRY: Run her DNA against the C.C.P.D.
criminal database. See if you get a match.

99
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,186
Yahtzee. Her name's Shawna Baez.

100
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:02,065
Mostly petty crimes,
and this girl likes to party, apparently.

101
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,359
A long list of disorderly conducts at bars.

102
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,820
So I'm guessing we find her,
we find Clay Parker.

103
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,488
-Barry?
-Yeah.

104
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,950
In the meantime, let's track
these particulates and see how they work.

105
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,078
I'll be right with you guys.

106
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:24,421
I have had the biggest craving for Thai food.

107
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,965
You said you knew
what happened to Ronnie.

108
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,967
And how he was still alive.

109
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:33,221
And you said Professor Stein was at
S.T.A.R. Labs the night of the explosion.

110
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,849
Yes, he was.

111
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,476
Why?

112
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:46,317
The mystery isn't why Stein
went to S.T.A.R. Labs that night.

113
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,820
It's why he didn't leave.

114
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,825
-Tell me.
-Can't. Have to show you.

115
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,577
[SCOFFS]

116
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,955
You are not getting out of this cell.

117
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,792
Fair enough. But I know you, Cisco.

118
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,422
I know how much you looked up to Ronnie.
He was like family.

119
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,842
The family you built for yourself here.

120
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,928
I know how much
you wanna see that family healed.

121
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,680
Let me help you.

122
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,974
I don't believe you.

123
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,686
I'm telling you the truth, Cisco.

124
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:26,399
When you are ready,
you know where to find me.

125
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,123
What's that smile about?

126
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,042
I saw my dad today.

127
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:48,296
No glass. No phones. Just me
and him face-to-face. Joe arranged it.

128
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:52,092
-That must have been amazing, Barry.
-Yeah. I really needed it.

129
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,803
I'm sure he needed it too.

130
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,680
Were you there investigating the breakout?

131
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,560
-Mm-hm.
-That is a big story which I am not a part of.

132
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:06,022
My editor wants me writing
about the Flash and only the Flash.

133
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,857
-Is that a bad thing?
-I don't know.

134
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,902
I would like to be thought of
as more than the Flash PR flack.

135
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,823
I mean, if I don't write something soon,
I think I might lose my job.

136
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:19,452
Hey, we will find you a great story
to write about. Together.

137
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,539
Okay? You know I'm always here for you.

138
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,459
I know.

139
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,510
I didn't know you enjoyed
a bit of rough trade.

140
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:39,264
If I'm gonna let you out,
I'm not taking any chances.

141
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:45,520
Curiosity's a maddening thing, is it not?

142
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,693
BARRY: What do you mean,
you've been asking around?

143
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,445
Do you know a Marcus Stockheimer?

144
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,909
Sure. He's some midlevel gangster.
Works mainly on the south side.

145
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,787
Word is Clay Parker
was a runner for Marcus.

146
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:07,584
When Clay got pinched, Marcus lost a lot of
money. Marcus doesn't like losing money.

147
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,713
So Parker can't leave Central City
until he's paid off his debt?

148
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,717
From what I'm told, if you're a member
of the Stockheimer crew, you get out...

149
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:20,305
...first thing you do is pay them a visit
or suffer the consequences.

150
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,892
All right. No more playing cop.

151
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,936
Promise me.

152
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,063
I hear you.

153
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,191
All right.

154
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,950
You were gonna show me what happened
to Ronnie. Ronnie died inside the building.

155
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,495
-What are we doing out here?
-What do you see?

156
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,706
