1
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,480
Five, four, three...

2
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,275
...two, one.

3
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,859
Ready or not, here I come.

4
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,895
Hey, Dad?

5
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,231
Dad!

6
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,089
You'll stay with Aunt May
and Uncle Ben for a little while.

7
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,466
- I wanna go with you.
- No.

8
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,973
Doesn't like crust
on his sandwiches...

9
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,392
...and he likes to sleep
with a little light on.

10
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,686
- Mary. Come on, come on.
- Oh, God.

11
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,400
Dad.

12
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,944
Be good.

13
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,548
- Sorry.
- Morning, Flash.

14
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,595
Good morning, Parker.

15
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,936
Hey. It's Peter, right?

16
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,231
I really like your photos.

17
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,192
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

18
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,569
Listen, are you busy Friday night?

19
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:46,119
Cool. Can you take pictures
of my boyfriend's car?

20
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,581
You know, I really wanna frame
a good one for his birthday.

21
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:53,210
That's really nice of you.
Wow, that's such a nice thought.

22
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,295
Yeah, I'll have a look at the old...

23
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,214
- The old schedule.
- Okay.

24
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,508
Parker.

25
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,718
- Yes, sir?
- You want to keep that skateboard?

26
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,386
- Yeah.
- Keep it off the ground.

27
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,888
- Sure. Yeah.
- Wheels up.

28
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,181
Like that?

29
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,058
- That's it.
- Okay.

30
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,627
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

31
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,170
Eat it! Eat it!

32
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,840
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

33
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,425
Eat your vegetables, Gordon. Come on!

34
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,052
Come on!

35
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,428
Hey, Parker, come on.

36
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,972
Get a picture of this.

37
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:50,267
No, I'm not gonna take a picture of it.
Put him down, man.

38
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,394
- Come on.
- Gordon, don't eat it.

39
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:53,603
Take the picture.

40
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,230
Put him down, Flash.

41
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,982
Take the picture.

42
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,734
Put him down, Eugene!

43
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,322
Hey, man.

44
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,409
Come on! Get up, Parker!

45
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,706
Get up! Come on! Come on!

46
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,416
Get up!

47
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,794
Still not taking the picture.

48
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,629
Stay down, Parker!

49
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,631
Who wants one more?

50
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,383
- One more!
- Flash!

51
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,218
Flash...

52
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,304
...we still on for after school today?

53
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,597
My house, 3:30?

54
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,973
I hope you did homework.

55
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,600
Last time, I was...

56
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,435
...disappointed in you.

57
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,687
- Okay, move.
- No, how about we go to class?

58
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,063
How about it?

59
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,443
Whatever.

60
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,386
I thought that was great
what you did.

61
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,182
It was stupid, but it was great.

62
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,977
You should go to the nurse.
You might have a concussion.

63
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,690
- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?

64
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,901
No, I know your name.

65
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,736
I want to know
if you know your name.

66
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,031
Peter.

67
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,242
- Parker. Peter Parker.
- Okay. Okay, good.

68
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,543
I'd still go to the nurse though.

69
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,962
You're Gwen, right?

70
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,254
Gwen Stacy.

71
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,340
All right.

72
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,259
Hey.

73
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,221
I'm making
spaghetti and meatballs tonight.

74
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,057
You're serious?
Spaghetti and meatballs.

75
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,936
Since when don't you like
spaghetti and meatballs, huh?

76
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,146
- Oh, my God.
- What's up?

77
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,898
What happened to your face?

78
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,401
I'm all right. Just-- I fell, skating.

79
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,111
It's all right.

80
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,863
Ben Parker, don't you even...

81
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,992
...think about leaving
that filthy box in my kitchen.

82
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,911
- My bowling trophies.
- Oh, well, then, by all means...

83
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,579
...leave that box in my kitchen.

84
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,206
- What happened to you?
- He fell.

85
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:21,167
Why you kids ride those things,
I'll never know.

86
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,086
Because it's stupid and dangerous.

87
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,880
- Remember when we were stupid?
- No.

88
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,174
- Trust me, we were.
- All right. Good to know.

89
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,927
- Where's the flood?
- Follow me. I'll show you.

90
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,303
- You serious?
- Yes.

91
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,639
All right.

92
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,559
It's the condenser tray.

93
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:40,687
Too much water for the condenser tray
or the heat exchange tubing.

94
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,772
This has got to be the fill line.

95
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,316
That's the only thing
that makes any sense.

96
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,818
Can you fix it?

97
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,238
No, not tonight.
I'll go by the hardware store tomorrow.

98
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,116
Good deal. And meanwhile,
put this on your face.

99
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,494
How's the other guy look?

100
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,249
Come on.
I know a right cross when I see one.

101
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,336
Yes or no?
Do I have to call somebody's father?

102
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,922
- No, no.
- All right.

103
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,592
Well, I wouldn't tell your Aunt May.

104
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,845
I pity the poor kid
who'd have to suffer her wrath.

105
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,890
Before you come up, see if...

106
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,434
- ...there's anything else worth saving.
- Yeah.

107
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,620
- Plumbers don't fix appliances.
- Yes, they do.

108
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,371
They fix pipes and pump things.

109
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,373
If you ask them to--

110
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,381
I forgot all about that thing.
It was your dad's.

111
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,383
- Yeah.
- He asked us to keep it safe.

112
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,350
He saw it in the window
of that leather shop over on 9th Avenue.

113
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,603
He was 19. What does a 19-year-old kid
need with a briefcase?

114
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,605
And guess who sold it to him.

115
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,482
- I don't know.
- Your mother.

116
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:08,691
That's how they met.

117
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,779
He asked you to keep this safe?
There's nothing in here.

118
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,697
Have you looked?
There's nothing here.

119
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,991
Your father was
a very secretive man, Peter.

120
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,619
Yeah, I know.

121
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,378
Who's that?
Do you know who that is?

122
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,131
Some guy who worked with your dad,
I guess.

123
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,971
Just take this off the table, all right?

124
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,182
We're gonna eat. Off.
And wash your hands.

125
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,226
- Now.
- All right.

126
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,394
Go on.

127
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,639
I need you to be a good boy.

128
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,057
Where are you going?

129
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,394
There's something
your mom and I have to do.

130
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,370
What is this?

131
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,041
"Zero, zero, decay rate algorithm."

132
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,420
Yeah, one sec, one sec.

133
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,180
Come in.

134
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,100
- You okay?
- Yeah. What's up?

135
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,644
Oh, my God. You look just like him.

136
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,605
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

137
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,945
Listen...

138
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,571
...I don't have much education.

139
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,490
You know that, Peter.

140
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:06,077
Hell, I stopped being able to help
with your homework when you were 10.

141
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,788
What I'm trying to say is...

142
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,708
...I know it's been rough
for you without your dad.

143
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,043
And I know
we don't talk much about them.

144
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,672
- Yeah, it's all right.
- No, it is not all right.

145
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,467
I wish I could change it, but I can't.

146
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,595
Curt Connors.

147
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,016
That's the name of the guy
in the picture with your dad.

148
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,518
They worked together for years
and they were close.

149
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,521
But after that night,
we never saw him again.

150
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,566
He never even called. Not once.

151
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,695
Go figure.

152
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,200
She's pretty.

153
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,166
- Uncle Ben.
- What?

154
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,294
You're a pretty great dad, all right?

155
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,559
- Excuse me.
- What?

156
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,311
Can I help you?

157
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,146
I don't know. I'm here to see...

158
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,773
- ...Dr. Connors.
- Right.

159
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,150
You'll find yourself to the left.

160
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,362
You are here for the internship?

161
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,697
Yeah. Yeah.

162
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,951
Okay. You'll find your badge to the left.

163
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,501
- Having trouble finding yourself?
- No. Yeah, I got it.

164
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,923
Okay, Mr. Guevara.

165
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,137
Welcome to Oscorp.

166
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,140
Born from the mind of our founder,
Norman Osborn...

167
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:36,144
...the Oscorp Tower houses
108 floors of innovation.

168
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,314
Our scientific minds are pushing
the boundaries of defense, biomedical...

169
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:44,110
...and chemical technologies.
The future lies within.

170
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,570
Welcome to Oscorp.

171
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:49,657
I'm Gwen Stacy, a senior at Midtown
Science and head intern to Dr. Connors.

172
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,993
I'll be with you
for the duration of your visit.

173
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,870
Where I go, you go.

174
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,705
That's the rule. Remember that...

175
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,331
- ...all will be fine.
- Come on!

176
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,875
- If you forget that--
- Listen!

177
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,711
Look, listen.
Tell them Rodrigo Guevara is here.

178
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,172
Just tell them
Rodrigo Guevara is here!

179
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,506
My name's Rodrigo!

180
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,509
I guess I don't need to tell you
what happens if you forget.

181
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,887
Shall we?

182
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,687
Come around this way.

183
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,152
- Good afternoon, Gwen.
- Dr. Connors.

184
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:31,115
Welcome.
My name is Dr. Curtis Connors.

185
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,451
Yes, in case you're wondering,
I'm a southpaw.

186
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,828
I'm not a cripple, I'm a scientist...

187
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,414
...and the world's foremost authority
on herpetology.

188
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,334
That's reptiles,
for those of you who don't know.

189
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,960
Like the Parkinson's patient...

190
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,838
...who watches on in horror
as her body...

191
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,425
...slowly betrays her, or the man
with macular degeneration...

192
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,471
...whose eyes grow dimmer each day,
I long to fix myself.

193
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:57,475
I want to create a world
without weakness.

194
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:00,561
Anyone care
to venture a guess just how?

195
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:03,064
- Yes.
- Stem cells?

196
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:07,735
Promising. But the solution
I'm thinking of is more radical.

197
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,907
- No one?
- Cross-species genetics.

198
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,082
Person gets Parkinson's...

199
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,626
...when the brain cells
that produce dopamine...

200
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,795
...start to disappear.

201
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:30,091
But a zebra fish has the ability
to regenerate cells on command.

202
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,093
If you could give this ability...

203
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,137
...to the woman you're talking about,
that's that. She's...

204
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,473
She's curing herself.

205
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,310
Yeah, you just have to look past
the gills on her neck.

206
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,231
And you are...?

207
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,360
He's one of Midtown Science's...

208
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,070
- ...best and brightest.
- Really?

209
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,197
He's second in his class.

210
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,157
- Second?
- Yeah.

211
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,785
- Sure about that?
- I'm pretty sure.

212
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:05,167
I'm afraid duty calls. I'll leave you in the
more-than-capable hands of Miss Stacy.

213
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,211
Nice meeting you all.

214
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,841
If you'd like to gather round.

215
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,010
Welcome to Oscorp's tree of life.

216
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,597
Our planet's tree of life is immense.

217
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,183
- At Oscorp's cross-Species Division...
- Hi.

218
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,062
...we endeavor to explore
exciting new methods...

219
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,981
What are you doing, "Rodrigo"?

220
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,277
Oh, yeah.

221
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,030
- What are you doing here?
- I work here. I don't.

222
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,781
I was gonna say I work here...

223
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,160
...but it seems like you do work here.
So you know that I don't.

224
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,829
- You following me?
- No, I'm not following you, no.

225
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,874
- I had no idea you worked here.
- Why would you be here?

226
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,876
I just snuck in because...

227
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,461
I love science.

228
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,421
- You love it.
- I'm passionate about it.

229
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,214
So you snuck in--?

230
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,550
- I have to lead this tour group.
- I know.

231
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,637
I'll ask you more about this later.
Do not get me in trouble.

232
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,097
- I promise you I won't.
- Stay with the group.

233
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:04,393
All right, guys? I'm gonna take you
to the bio reactor room now.

234
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,482
Sorry. Yo.

235
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,984
Sorry.

236
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:39,006
We received the results
from the mRNA sequences this morning.

237
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,967
They were disappointing.

238
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,392
- So define "disappointing."
- Another dead end.

239
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,228
It's the decay rate algorithm.

240
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,897
- And this is to be expected.
- Expected?

241
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,440
You said you were close.

242
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,734
We are close,
but it's gonna take time.

243
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:02,571
He doesn't have time.
Norman Osborn is dying, Dr. Connors.

244
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,281
Save him.

245
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,994
Or we'll both lose our heads.

246
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,389
All right, give me the badge.

247
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,892
Give it to me.

248
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,939
Sorry.

249
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,210
Disgusting. Now I smell like beer.

250
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:42,963
I didn't mean to do that.

251
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,590
I didn't mean to...

252
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,508
I didn't-- I didn't--

253
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,846
- Get your hand off her!
- I'm trying to get my...

254
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,393
- Are you kidding?
- I'm sorry.

255
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,770
Are you kidding me?

256
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,064
- Hey, get him, Rudy!
- Hey!

257
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,778
Man, I'm sorry!
Man, are you all right?

258
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,240
- Take him down!
- Come on.

259
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,453
Get him, man! Get him!

260
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,959
No, man, no. Not my board.
Please, dude, don't--

261
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,962
Sorry!

262
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,967
Sorry. Sorry.

263
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,468
I'm so sorry.

264
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,891
Coney Island, next stop.

265
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,644
Next and final stop, Coney Island.

266
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,699
Hey.

267
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,200
Hey. Hey.

268
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,576
Sorry. I'm late.

269
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,412
- I got--
- We've been so worried.

270
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:59,206
I know. I'm sorry. Watch out!

271
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,464
That's a fly, Peter.

272
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,178
Yeah.

273
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,978
I'm so sorry I kept you guys up.

274
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:24,481
I'm insensitive, I'm irresponsible...

275
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,442
...and I'm hungry.

276
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,823
Meat loaf.

277
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:37,494
- Drinking?
- What's this?

278
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,079
I don't think so.

279
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,873
This is your meat loaf.

280
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,377
This beats all other meat loafs.

281
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,422
Something is very wrong.

282
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:52,301
Yeah. Nobody likes your meat loaf.

283
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,975
I got it.

284
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,356
He took the frozen macaroni and cheese.

285
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,816
I noticed that.

286
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,653
Why didn't you tell me
you didn't like my meat loaf?

287
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,073
You could have said that to me
37 years ago.

288
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,909
How many meat loafs
have I made for you?

289
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,498
Peter.

290
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,333
What are you doing?

291
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,001
I'm...

292
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,797
- Homework.
- Be careful.

293
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,548
Sure.

294
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,142
Dr. Connors.

295
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,106
- You don't remember me. I--
- The intern from the other day.

296
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,358
Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah.

297
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,819
I'm sure you're very nice,
but this is a home.

298
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,321
I ask you to make an appointment
with my office.

299
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,823
I'm Richard Parker's son.

300
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,290
Peter?

301
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,669
I'm afraid I can't help you much.

302
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:58,964
I don't know why they left
or where they were going.

303
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:03,260
Good reflexes.

304
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,803
Thank you.

305
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,935
- Thank you.
- I read your book.

306
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:13,395
Yeah.

307
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:14,855
It's something, you know.

308
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,815
So you really think...

309
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,693
- ...it's possible, cross-species genetics?
- Yes, of course.

310
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,321
Your father and I were mocked
for our theories.

311
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,240
Not just in the community at large,
but at Oscorp, as well.

312
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,492
They called us mad scientists.

313
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:31,038
And then your father bred the spiders...

314
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,581
...and everything changed.

315
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,416
The results were
beyond encouraging.

316
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,543
They were spectacular.

317
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,673
We were gonna change
the lives of millions.

318
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,800
Including my own.

319
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,886
Then it was over.

320
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,681
He was gone.

321
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,351
Took his research with him.

322
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:56,021
And I knew without him, I...

323
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,197
I...

324
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,950
I was angry.

325
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:15,290
So I stayed away from you
and your family.

326
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,834
And for that, I'm truly sorry.

327
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,386
Say...

328
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,137
Say it worked.

329
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,473
Say you got it to work.

330
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,936
Like, how much would
the foreign species take over?

331
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,356
What could the side effects be?

332
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,737
It's hard to say,
considering no subject survived.

333
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:49,116
- The problem was always--
- The decay rate algorithm?

334
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,578
- Right.
- Right.

335
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,999
- Can I...?
- Of course.

336
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,315
Extraordinary.

337
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,401
How did you come up with this?

338
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,618
Peter, how about coming
to see me at the Tower...

339
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,662
- ...one day after school?
- Yeah.

340
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,666
Thank you.

341
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,397
Number one, Reggie.
Run it, buddy.

342
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,149
Let's go, Reggie.

343
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,196
Rejected!

344
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,657
You did that on purpose, Flash!

345
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,910
I should've.
You better watch your back.

346
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,540
Hey.

347
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,960
All right?

348
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,801
Give it up, Parker.

349
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,474
Come on, man.

350
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,393
One sec.

351
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,233
- Come on, man.
- Why don't you take it from me?

352
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,613
That's right. Take it.

353
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,406
Go ahead. Take it.

354
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,971
Just take it.

355
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,808
All right, how about this?

356
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,727
All right? How about that?

357
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,067
- Come on, Flash.
- Flash, stop playing, man.

358
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,403
- Take it from him!
- Come on, Flash. Take it.

359
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,904
Yo, Flash, let's go.

360
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,614
- Let's go!
- Do it, Flash.

361
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,491
- Stop playing, man.
- Let's go, Flash.

362
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,577
- What are you doing?
- What's up?

363
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,913
What you doing, man?

364
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,959
All right, bring it!
Come on, Parker! Come on!

365
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,891
Peter's behavior is just unacceptable.

366
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,184
They won't make us pay...

367
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,187
- ...for the backboard.
- I don't care about the backboard.

368
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,064
- Was that true?
- What?

369
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,025
What I heard in there just now.

370
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,153
Did you humiliate that boy?

371
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,572
Yeah, I did.

372
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,365
- But--
- But what?

373
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,992
- This guy deserved it.
- Did he?

374
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,869
- Yeah.
- Is he the kid that hit you?

375
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,456
Is he?

376
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,458
Yeah, yeah, but...

377
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,044
So all this is about getting even.

378
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,589
If so, I guess you must feel pretty good
about yourself now, right?

379
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:33,882
Am I right or wrong?

380
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,927
Yeah, I thought so.

381
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,430
Well, thanks
to this little escapade of yours...

382
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,557
...I had to change shifts at work...

383
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:46,394
...So you have to pick up Aunt May
tonight at 9:00. Understood?

384
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,355
- Is that understood?
- Yeah.

385
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,231
Okay, good.

386
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,610
She looks familiar.

387
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,697
The girl on your computer.

388
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,532
Yeah.

389
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,661
He's got you on his computer.
I'm his probation officer.

390
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,372
Don't forget Aunt May.

391
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,585
Okay.

392
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:17,342
He's a character. That's my uncle.

393
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:21,096
He's a pathological liar.
He thought you were someone else.

394
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,765
Oh, man, you don't have me
on your computer?

395
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:27,060
I took a photo of the debate team,
and you're in the debate team.

396
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,896
- Right.
- So he must have seen--

397
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,107
I was touching up stuff.

398
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,775
- Touching up stuff?
- Come on.

399
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,569
I was... I'm not gonna answer that.

400
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,199
- Did you get expelled?
- No, no.

401
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,535
I didn't get expelled.
I got community service.

402
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,833
So you want to-- I don't know...?

403
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,003
- Want to what?
- I don't know.

404
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,880
Just...

405
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,596
I don't know-- We could...

406
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,558
We could do something else,
or we could--

407
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,185
- If you don't feel like, we could--
- Yeah.

408
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,895
- Yeah?
- Yeah, either one.

409
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,441
- Really?
- Sure.

410
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,778
- Okay. All right, good. Sounds good.
- Cool.

411
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,864
Okay.

412
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,324
- I can't right now, I can't right now.
- Yeah, no.

413
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,827
- I'm so busy right now.
- I know, me too.

414
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,331
But maybe...

415
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,168
- Yeah, just, you know...
- Some other...

416
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,003
- Time, all right.
- Okay.

417
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,796
- Bye.
- All right.

418
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:07,470
We have protein structure, rDNA...

419
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,681
...chromatography,
transgenics testing...

420
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:13,434
...that's x-ray video. That's the only one
on the planet. We have...

421
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,145
- Human line testing over--
- I remember that.

422
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,981
I've seen that before.

423
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,399
The Ganali device.

424
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:22,318
Yeah, I remember a picture of that
in my dad's office.

425
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,946
The idea was so simple.
You load it with an antigen.

426
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:28,575
It creates a cloud which can be dispersed
over a neighborhood, even a city.

427
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:32,078
Theoretically, you could cure polio
in an afternoon.

428
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,289
That's incredible.

429
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,709
Well, others disagreed. What if
the device were loaded with a toxin?

430
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,878
What if you wanted to opt out?
You can't...

431
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,423
...run away from a cloud after all,
so here it lies, gathering dust.

432
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,926
What you see here
is a computer model of a lizard.

433
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,305
Many of these wonderful creatures
have so brilliantly adapted...

434
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,974
...that they can regenerate
entire limbs at will.

435
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,976
You can imagine my envy.

436
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,061
We're trying to harness
this capability...

437
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,480
...and transfer it
into our host subject:

438
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,900
Freddy the three-legged mouse.

439
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,111
Enter the algorithm now.

440
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,366
You need to take that?

441
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,832
System ready for gene insertion.

442
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,626
Okay.

443
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,544
Check.

444
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,631
See what I'm trying to do?

445
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,674
- Preempt the proteins.
- The immune response.

446
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,009
Beginning trials.

447
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,762
Pending. Pending.

448
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,430
Failed. Subject deceased.

449
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,599
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Pending.

450
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,851
Failed. Pending. Failed.

451
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,227

Subject deceased. Pending.

453
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,941
Peptide algorithm accepted.

454
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,233
Regrowth complete.

455
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,902
- Hey.
- Vitals normal.

456
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,655
Blood pressure normal.

457
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,699
Limb regeneration successful.

458
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,660
Extraordinary.

459
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,707
And thank you.

460
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:04,337
Meet Fred and Wilma,
our three-legged mice.

461
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,466
Here you go.

462
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,970
Hey, buddy, I got you.

463
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,849
Okay. Careful, don't want to stick you
by mistake.

464
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,893
Human trials aren't until next week.

465
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,272
There.

466
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,823
Hey.

467
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,367
Hey, I thought you...

468
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,703
Didn't you forget something?

469
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,371
What?

470
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:42,375
Now, don't answer that,
but I'm glad to know it's working.

471
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:47,338
You owe your aunt
an apology big-time.

472
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:52,218
Be a man.
Get in there and apologize.

473
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,181
I'm sorry, Aunt May, I...

474
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,393
Honestly, you don't have
to apologize to me. It's your--

475
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,353
- The hell he doesn't.
- Ben.

476
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,106
Look, I'm sorry, I got distracted.

477
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,191
- Oh, he got distracted.
- Yeah.

478
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,486
Your aunt, my wife,
had to walk 12 blocks alone...

479
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:14,115
...in the middle of the night and then wait
in a deserted subway station...

480
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:17,368
- ...because you got distracted.
- Ben, sweetheart, honestly...

481
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,579
...I am completely capable
of walking home--

482
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:21,789
You will not defend this boy!

483
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,249
- I'm not defending--
- You are!

484
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,918
- Listen to me, son.
- Yeah, go ahead.

485
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,628
You're a lot like your father.

486
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,298
You really are, Peter,
and that's a good thing...

487
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:33,593
...but your father lived by a philosophy,
a principle, really.

488
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,096
He believed that if you could do
good things for other people...

489
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,724
...you had a moral obligation
to do those things.

490
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,517
That's what's at stake here.

491
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,935
Not choice.

492
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,979
Responsibility.

493
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,484
That is nice. That's great.

494
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,612
That's all well and good.
So where is he?

495
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,698
- What?
- Where is he?

496
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,867
Where's my dad?

497
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:01,496
He didn't think it was his responsibility
to be here to tell me himself?

498
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,957
- Oh, come on, how dare you?
- How dare I? How dare you?

499
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,799
Where you going?
Peter, come back here, please.

500
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:25,228
Ben, leave him alone for a little while.
He'll be all right.

501
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:39,117
Peter!

502
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,371
Peter?

503
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,378
Peter!

504
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,135
It's 2.07.

505
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:02,473
- It's 2.07.
- Yeah. No, I know.

506
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,476
Yeah, you're holding up the line. No.

507
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,146
You can leave a penny,
you can't take a penny.

508
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,273
- What?
- You can leave...

509
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:13,109
...a penny anytime,
you have to spend 10 dollars...

510
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:15,153
...to take a penny.
It's store policy.

511
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,738
- You're holding up my line.
- I don't have 2 cents.

512
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,574
You can't afford milk, step aside.

513
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,993
Daddy didn't give you
enough milk money today?

514
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,704
- We're talking about 2 cents.
- Just step aside, kid.

515
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:32,587
Really?

516
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,351
Yo, not cool, bro.

517
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,899
Hey, man, stop!
Somebody stop that guy!

518
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:56,277
- Hey, kid, little help?
- Not my policy.

519
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:57,570
Somebody stop that dude!

520
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,698
Hey! Hey, stop!

521
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,826
Somebody stop that dude!

522
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,878
Hey!

523
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,534
Oh, God. Oh, God.

524
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,161
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

525
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,497
Call an ambulance!

526
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:52,041
Someone call an ambulance!
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

527
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,335
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

528
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,715
Oh, God.

529
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,470
No.

530
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,599
Oh, Jesus.

531
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,607
Witnesses gave a description to the
sketch artist. I need you to take a look.

532
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,989
No, I don't know him.

533
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:26,409
I didn't expect you would, ma'am.
Homicide detectives...

534
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,536
...are on it.
We'll see what they turn up.

535
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,371
Okay.

536
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,336
Can I have that?

537
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,879
Sure.

538
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,175
There's one other thing.
He has a star...

539
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:45,511
...tattooed on his left hand.

540
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:17,501
Peter, I know things
have been difficult lately...

541
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,920
...and I'm sorry about that.

542
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,757
I think I know what you're feeling.

543
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,399
Hey, Parker.

544
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,486
- Not today.
- Come on, I just want to talk.

545
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,618
It feels better, right?

546
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,120
Look, your uncle died.

547
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:55,247
I'm sorry.

548
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,874
I get it.

549
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,834
I'm sorry.

550
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,795
Okay?

551
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:08,302
Peter.

552
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,055
Stay away from him.

553
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:54,223
- You understand?
- Hey!

554
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,766
- Stay away from Joey.
- Hey!

555
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,311
You like beating on girls?

556
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,021
You like beating on old men?

557
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,815
Hey, pal, keep walking.

558
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:05,401
- You're in the wrong place.
- When were you in Queens?

559
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,278
I asked you a question.

560
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,238
- Nicky, no!
- That the gun?

561
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:10,448
You gonna kill me too?

562
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,576
Hey! Stop it!

563
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,870
Hey, get off!

564
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:17,830
Wait, oh, don't hit Nicky!

565
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,498
Back up!

566
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,001
This guy is crazy!

567
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,878
Get him!

568
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:30,634
Get back here, man! Get him!

569
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,018
Follow him!

570
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,606
- Go around, man!
- I'll follow you!

571
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,450
Go, go, go!

572
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,285
There he is!

573
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:58,037
Can't get away!

574
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:15,763
He has a star tattooed
on his left hand.

575
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,693
Oh, yeah? Come on!

576
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,744
I know what you look like!

577
00:50:38,911 --> 00:50:40,621
You hear me?

578
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,415
I've seen your face!

579
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,830
Is that all you got?

580
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,000
Just take it, take it.

581
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,216
Engineered
from genetically enhanced spiders...

582
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:38,762
...Oscorp's BioCable tensile strength
is unparalleled. We're just beginning...

583
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:42,683
...to understand all the potential
industrial applications.

584
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:46,353
A single pellet can safely store
several hundred meters...

585
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,355
...of the lightweight cable.

586
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:58,115
Mother...

587
00:52:55,631 --> 00:53:00,302
Attention, all units in the confines
of Precinct 13, receiving a 10-30...

588
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:02,763
...on West 19th Street and Broadway.

589
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,683
Assailant is Caucasian male, mid-30s...

590
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:10,187
...170 to 180 pounds,
shoulder-length blond hair.

591
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:13,107
Last seen on foot
heading eastbound on 19th Street.

592
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,002
Hey.

593
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,179
- You got a description?
- Well, no, he wears a mask.

594
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:45,973
A mask?

595
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,307
Most of his victims...

596
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:50,853
...are suspects with serious rap sheets.
They're calling him a vigilante.

597
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,397
Okay, he's not a vigilante,
he's an anarchist.

598
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,233
Help me, somebody! Arrest me!

599
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,318
Get me out of here!

600
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,195
Hey, look!

601
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,333
Spandex. Spandex.

602
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:16,211
Everything spandex.

603
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:18,630
Extraordinary velocity vector
is a function...

604
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,674
...of both mass and acceleration.

605
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:22,634
Come on,
you know better than anyone...

606
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,262
...the weight on any pendulum
has no effect on speed.

607
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:29,349
It doesn't affect frequency,
but it's totally a factor in momentum.

608
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,262
Hey, Aunt May.

609
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,515
Yeah. Eggs?

610
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,808
Organic, got it.

611
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:47,803
In the future, if you're gonna steal cars,
don't dress like a car thief, man.

612
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,513
What are you? You a cop?

613
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:54,601
Really? You seriously think I'm a cop?
Cop in a skin-tight red-and-blue suit?

614
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,854
You know, you're...

615
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,023
You've got a mind
of the true scholar, sir.

616
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,609
I was going more for the guys
who do the luge.

617
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,988
Good thinking.
Get out the window.

618
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,031
There you go. You got it.

619
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,249
Crotch!

620
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:22,462
- Just let me go.
- Is that a real knife?

621
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,797
Yes, it's a real knife.

622
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,465
My weakness, it's small knives.

623
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:28,176
- Just let me go.
- Anything but knives!

624
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,888
- Oh, it's so simple. That was cool.
- What is this?

625
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,682
Webbing I developed.
I don't think you want to know.

626
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:35,350
Let me go!

627
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:38,145
Okay, one second.
Hold on, one second.

628
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:40,522
Knock it off, man. No!

629
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:42,983
Come on, let me go. Stop it!

630
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:44,860
That isn't funny.

631
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:46,486
- It is kind of funny.
- Help!

632
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,832
This could've gone a lot worse.

633
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,959
Now hold still.

634
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:07,841
Boys in blue here.

635
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:10,510
- Yo, I got him.
- Freeze!

636
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,512
- He's not going anywhere.
- Don't move.

637
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:15,015
- You serious?
- Who are you?

638
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,142
No one grasps
the concept of the mask.

639
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:18,727
Freeze!

640
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,689
I just did 80 percent of your job.

641
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,067
And that?
That's how you repay me?

642
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,780
Hold it right there!

643
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:51,927
Well, that was fun.

644
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,013
Bus! Hey there, everybody.

645
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:00,102
What are you doing?

646
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,067
Hey, watch out.
I'm swinging here.

647
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:08,735
I'm swinging here.

648
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:27,004
So 38 of New York's finest...

649
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:30,340
...versus one guy in a unitard.

650
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,384
Am I correct?

651
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,649
You don't have to wait up for me.

652
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:49,109
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

653
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:50,318
Yes, I do.

654
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:51,778
- Okay.
- Where were you?

655
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:52,988
I was out.

656
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:55,115
Did you get the eggs?

657
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:58,160
Nope. Forgot the eggs.

658
00:58:58,326 --> 00:58:59,536
I'm gonna get them now.

659
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,288
No, you most certainly will not.

660
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,457
Not at this hour.

661
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,169
Look at me, Peter.

662
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,548
Take off the damn hood
and look at me.

663
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:22,350
Peter. Where do you go?

664
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:23,935
Who does this to you?

665
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,855
- Please go to sleep, Aunt May.
- Please tell me.

666
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:30,275
Aunt May, please,
please, please go to sleep.

667
00:59:30,442 --> 00:59:33,487
I can't sleep.
Don't you understand? I can't sleep.

668
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:47,501
Peter, listen to me.

669
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:51,129
Secrets have a cost.
They're not for free.

670
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,507
Not now, not ever.

671
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,141
Cross-species genetics
is finally working.

672
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,686
I've used the lizard DNA
to help Freddy regrow that limb.

673
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,480
It's a miracle.

674
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:10,190
No, it's hard work and promise.

675
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:14,569
- It's a step closer to the primate lab.
- He doesn't have time for every little step.

676
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:17,114
- Little?
- I just mean he can't wait.

677
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,907
Well, he'll have to.

678
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:20,992
Unless he wants to be a lab rat.

679
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,036
That's not what I'm saying.

680
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,371
So, what are you saying?

681
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,874
You have to start human trials.

682
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,169
- Now.
- No, I don't, and, no, I won't.

683
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:33,255
- Well, then he's going to die.
- People die.

684
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,508
Even Norman Osborn.

685
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:39,386
- We are not finished.
- Human trials?

686
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:42,139
Where are you gonna find
the people to volunteer?

687
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,891
As far as anyone's concerned,
it's for a flu shot.

688
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,936
I might think the Veterans Hospital
is a place to start.

689
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:49,437
You've gotta be kidding me.

690
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:51,606
I don't think I am.

691
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:00,407
It's a little late
for shock and indignation.

692
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:01,783
About 15 years late.

693
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,743
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

694
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,495
Richard Parker wore it well.

695
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,456
On you, it's a cheap suit,
as it was then.

696
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,041
I had nothing to do with that.

697
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,751
Is that what you told his son?

698
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,717
I don't know what you're saying.

699
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:21,428
You don't know,
or you don't wanna know?

700
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:25,265
I'll remind you what happened.

701
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:28,894
Richard Parker said just about the same
thing then that you are saying now.

702
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:34,399
The clock is ticking, Dr. Connors.

703
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:37,194
I...

704
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,661
I won't.

705
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,290
Fine.

706
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:57,672
The formula is ours now anyway.

707
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,593
Say goodbye to that arm
you have dreamed of.

708
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,261
I'm shutting you down.

709
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:06,348
Have your office cleared out
by the morning.

710
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:10,018
Your toys can be taken away too,
you know.

711
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,897
Right, Freddy?

712
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:29,496
-Hey.

713
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:32,082
- How's it going?
- Where you headed?

714
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:35,710
- Monday, B track.
- Oh, it's Thursday.

715
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,504
- It's Thursday?
- What happened?

716
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,339
- What?
- Your eye, it looks bruised.

717
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:40,757
Oh, yeah, no, I don't...

718
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:42,550
Maybe I got a rash or...

719
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,469
It's bad.
Have you gone to the nurse?

720
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:48,431
Do you like branzino?

721
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:50,850
Like, a fish.

722
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,894
No, no. I know. I know.

723
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:55,230
Well, if you want...

724
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:59,901
...you can come to this address
at 8:00 tonight.

725
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,362
My mom's making branzino.

726
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,322
So...

727
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:07,826
It's apartment 2016.
I didn't write that part down.

728
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:09,327
I don't know why I...

729
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,329
- I'll remember it.
- Oh, okay.

730
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,248
Twenty-sixteen.

731
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:22,275
Hi.

732
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:24,819
How did you get out there?

733
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:27,280
The fire escape.

734
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:30,492
Your doorman's intimidating.

735
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,494
It's 20 stories.

736
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,245
Yeah. It's all right.

737
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:40,502
- This is your room.
- Yes, this is my room.

738
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:42,337
Books.

739
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:43,922
Shoes.

740
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:46,091
Oh, hey...

741
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:50,095
I got your mom these.

742
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,304
Oh, lovely.

743
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:53,139
- Beautiful, right?
- Beautiful.

744
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,682
They were nice.

745
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,684
- No, they're beautiful.
- I'm sorry.

746
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:59,562
No, it's impressive.
They actually held together very well.

747
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,231
I'm gonna keep these.

748
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:03,483
You have your suit in there?

749
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:08,196
My suit?

750
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:10,740
It's for dinner. Are you gonna--?

751
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,033
Are you gonna wear that?

752
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,327
- That's--
- Hey, hon.

753
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:21,751
- You must be Peter.
- Dad, this is Peter.

754
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:25,547
Nice to meet you, sir.

755
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:27,924
Nice to meet you.

756
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:29,634
Dinner's ready.

757
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:31,845
Hope you like branzino.

758
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:33,555
Who doesn't?

759
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,324
Emma, it's Curt.

760
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:37,368
- Is he there?
- I'm afraid not, doctor.

761
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:40,371
The car is taking him
to the Veterans Hospital in Brooklyn.

762
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:41,748
No. He can't, Emma.

763
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:44,209
You have to stop him. He--

764
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,794
I would, but I always lose him
on the bridge.

765
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:49,923
I'll make sure Dr. Ratha returns your call
as soon as possible.

766
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:03,269
I'm going to Holton Avenue,
across the river. I'm in a hurry.

767
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,480
You want me to take
the tunnel or the bridge?

768
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:06,898
Bridge! Take the bridge.

769
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:08,399
All right, we'll do that.

770
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:10,485
Hey, you all right back there?

771
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,530
Are you tweaking, man?

772
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,282
Just drive.

773
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,076
Okay.

774
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:25,833
You're having trouble there?

775
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,752
The head goes on the other--

776
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:30,755
- Help Gwen's friend with his fish.
- Oh, I...

777
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:32,257
I got no idea.

778
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:33,800
First time.

779
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,468
- Branzino.
- George.

780
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,388
- Tell us about your day.
- Did you catch that spider guy yet?

781
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:40,181
No, we didn't catch him yet.

782
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:42,225
But we will. He's an amateur...

783
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:45,061
...who's assaulting civilians
in the dead of night.

784
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,146
He's clumsy, he leaves clues...

785
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:48,690
...but he's still dangerous.

786
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:50,942
He's assaulting people?

787
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:53,820
I'm not sure.

788
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:55,488
I mean, I saw that video...

789
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:57,657
...with him and the car thief, and...

790
01:07:57,824 --> 01:08:00,868
I think most people
would say that he was...

791
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:02,996
...providing a public service.

792
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:05,999
Most people would be wrong.

793
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:10,461
If I wanted the car thief off the street,
he'd already be off the street.

794
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:11,879
So why wasn't he then?

795
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:16,884
Let me illuminate you.

796
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:19,721
The car thief was leading us
to the people who run...

797
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:22,056
...the operation.
It's a six-month-long sting.

798
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:25,226
It's called strategy.
I'm sure you're aware of the term?

799
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:26,978
You've heard about that in school?

800
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:28,938
- Yeah.
- Good.

801
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,356
I know.

802
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:33,234
- He didn't know you had a plan.
- You seem to know...

803
01:08:33,401 --> 01:08:35,278
...a lot about this.
Know something we don't?

804
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:37,572
- Whose side are you on?
- I'm not on anyone's side.

805
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:40,825
- I saw a video on the Internet--
- You saw the video on the Internet.

806
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:43,202
- Well, then the case is closed.
- Well, no.

807
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,955
If you watch the video--
Maybe send you a link?

808
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,790
It looks like he's trying to help.

809
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,835
On the Internet he's being made out
to look like a hero.

810
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:53,588
No, no. I'm not saying he's a hero.

811
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:56,049
- What are you trying to say?
- He's trying to help.

812
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:57,693
He's trying to do something
the police can't.

813
01:08:57,717 --> 01:08:59,093
Something the police can't?

814
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,900
- I don't know.
- What do you think we do?

815
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:04,474
Sit around eating doughnuts
with our thumbs planted up our asses?

816
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:06,726
- George. George.
- Daddy.

817
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:07,935
- Up your what?
- Howard.

818
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:11,314
He stands for what you stand for:
Protecting innocent people from bad guys.

819
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:13,608
I stand for law and order.
That's what I stand for.

820
01:09:13,775 --> 01:09:15,318
Okay? I wear a badge.

821
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:18,529
This guy wears a mask like an outlaw.

822
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:21,240
He's hunting down criminals
that all look the same...

823
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,576
...like he's got some sort
of personal vendetta.

824
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:26,746
But he's not protecting
innocent people, Mr. Parker.

825
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:29,040
Let's get some air, Peter.

826
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:31,584
- Dad, we need to talk.
- Yes, we do.

827
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,755
Thank you for having me. I'm sorry...

828
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:38,216
...if I insulted you.
It was not my intention.

829
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:41,678
- You're welcome.
- Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy.

830
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,097
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

831
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,226
- Dad.
- Yeah?

832
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,984
Well, that was something.

833
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:01,406
I'm sorry. I thought he was going
to arrest me at one point.

834
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:04,200
No, I wouldn't have let him arrest you.

835
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,958
- What happened to your face?
- I wanna tell you something.

836
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:14,961
Okay.

837
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,634
I've been bitten...

838
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:27,265
So have.

839
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:33,187
Okay.

840
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:37,233
Okay, okay, okay.
I gotta tell you this one thing.

841
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,235
I gotta tell you this one thing about...

842
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:42,196
- ...the vigilante and the car thief.
- Oh, okay.

843
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,073
What?

844
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,492
- No, no, no.
- I don't want to talk about that.

845
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,327
Forget that.
I won't talk about that.

846
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:50,747
- I'm gonna talk about me, okay?
- What about you?

847
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:54,751
It's impo-- I wish I could just--

848
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,378
- I can't. It's hard to say.
- Just say it.

849
01:10:57,545 --> 01:10:59,714
- I don't know.
- Say it.

850
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:03,760
What? What?

851
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:08,931
What?

852
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,937
Okay, then forget it.

853
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:24,447
You...?

854
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,500
- You're Spider-Man.
- Shut up.

855
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:41,714
Gwen?

856
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,300
Gwen...

857
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:47,220
Your father wants you to come inside.

858
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:48,888
Okay.

859
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,807
- Okay?
- Yeah.

860
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:55,728
- Gwen.
- I'm coming.

861
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,886
Oh, I'm in trouble.

862
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:55,413
Will you please go
and find out what is going on, Alfred?

863
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,668
Get out of the way!

864
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,714
Excellent.

865
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:08,426
Hey!

866
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:12,179
Hey! What is that?

867
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,223
- Oh, look out!
- I don't know!

868
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,766
Get back in the car!

869
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:22,273
Help!

870
01:13:23,774 --> 01:13:24,817
Help!

871
01:14:05,024 --> 01:14:07,151
Incoming!

872
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:31,342
Somebody help!
Help me! My kid is trapped!

873
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,311
I want my dad!

874
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:43,688
Dad!

875
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,231
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Help!

876
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:47,400
- Hey, buddy. It's okay.
- Get away.

877
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:49,485
- Help!
- Hey, look.

878
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:52,905
Just a normal guy, all right?

879
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:56,283
Wanna hold this?

880
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:59,537
Hold my mask. All right.

881
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:02,540
What's your name?

882
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:04,291
Jack?

883
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:06,085
- Yes.
- Let's get you out of here.

884
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:09,213
Okay, stay very still.

885
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:11,632
- All right.
- Okay, I got you.

886
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:18,514
Okay, look.
I'll undo the belt. You hold on...

887
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:20,766
...to that seat in front of you.
On three?

888
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:23,602
- All right.
- Okay, one, two, three.

889
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:27,940
See how easy that was?
You did a great job.

890
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:29,817
All right, okay.

891
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:44,790
Jack, climb now.

892
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,792
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

893
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:53,966
Put it on, the mask.

894
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:55,551
It's gonna make you strong.

895
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:58,596
Jack, trust me. Put it on.

896
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:02,016
There you go. That's it.
That's it, buddy.

897
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:04,477
Okay, now, climb. Come on, Jack.

898
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,608
Do me a favor.
A little faster, okay, bud?

899
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:13,194
You're doing great, buddy.
You're doing great.

900
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,403
That's it. Keep coming.

901
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,198
Keep it coming. Keep coming.

902
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:19,450
No!

903
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,800
Jack. Oh, God.

904
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:37,468
Thank God.

905
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:40,513
You okay?

906
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:44,975
My son. My son.

907
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:48,896
Oh, my son. My son.

908
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:54,360
Who are you?

909
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:58,614
Spider-Man.

910
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:47,413
Beautiful.

911
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:57,464
Settle down, guys.

912
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,300
Settle down, boys. Settle down.

913
01:17:59,466 --> 01:18:01,635
- Come on.
- Listen. At approximately...

914
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:05,222
...9 p.m. last night, an incident took place
on the Williamsburg Bridge.

915
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:07,600
Much of what occurred
is speculation...

916
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:10,561
...at this point.
However, several eyewitnesses...

917
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:14,148
...to the crime, as well
as our own preliminary findings, have...

918
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:17,276
...positively placed
one individual at the scene.

919
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:18,861
Which is why, this morning...

920
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:20,487
...I am issuing a warrant...

921
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:23,949
...for the masked vigilante
known as Spider-Man.

922
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:33,626
And lastly, city council members met
with homeowners and airport officials...

923
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:35,461
...In the first of four meetings...

924
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:46,138
- It's so beautiful.
- Knows how to bite though.

925
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:48,057
Who else knows about this?

926
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:50,476
- Just you.
- Really?

927
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:54,897
Hey, you don't...

928
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:58,192
You don't believe
what the police are saying, do you?

929
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:00,611
Of course not.

930
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,031
Does it scare you?

931
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:05,991
What you can do?

932
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:09,828
No.

933
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:12,039
No.

934
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,167
What did that thing
on the bridge look like?

935
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:18,087
It was real big.
Too big to be human.

936
01:19:18,629 --> 01:19:20,631
You gotta lay low.

937
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:22,258
No, can't do that.

938
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:24,218
You've got to.

939
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:26,470
I mean, why...?

940
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:29,098
Because of last night.

941
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:31,100
Those people on the bridge.

942
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:35,396
Whatever was attacking them
would have killed them.

943
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:39,608
So I gotta go after it.

944
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:42,111
That's not your job.

945
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:45,155
Maybe it is.

946
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,704
I really liked kissing you.

947
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:56,417
You're an amazing kisser.

948
01:19:58,544 --> 01:19:59,753
Well, you know, it was--

949
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,089
It was good for me too.

950
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:06,176
Yeah?

951
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:16,687
Who did that?

952
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:39,460
Hello!

953
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:51,305
It's not nice to snoop.

954
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:56,101
I gave everyone the week off.

955
01:20:58,354 --> 01:20:59,813
Yeah.

956
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:01,607
Shouldn't you be at school?

957
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:07,488
No, I got a free track.
I wanted to ask you a question.

958
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,783
How would a predator track a reptile?

959
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:13,827
Oh, they don't.
Most reptiles are at the top...

960
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:15,204
...of their food chain.

961
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:16,872
Kings of their domain.

962
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:18,540
They gotta have vulnerabilities.

963
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:21,210
Why the sudden interest
in the cold-blooded?

964
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:26,090
Just asking a question.

965
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:29,093
I got school stuff.

966
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:31,261
Biology profiles to do.

967
01:21:31,678 --> 01:21:36,058
So because of the cold blood, would
they react to changes in temperatures?

968
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:37,518
You'd have to catch one first.

969
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:41,772
Did you know there's a rumor
of a new species in New York?

970
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:43,399
Beautiful and quite large.

971
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:46,568
What do you know about it?
You seen it?

972
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:48,654
No, it's not yet classified.

973
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:53,784
But it can be aggressive...

974
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:56,495
...if threatened.

975
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:04,545
Doc, you all right?

976
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:07,339
Never been better, Peter.
Never been better.

977
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,049
Now, if you'll excuse me.

978
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:11,969
Afraid I have to ask you to leave.
I have a new project...

979
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:14,555
...I'm working on.
I need to be alone.

980
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,474
Good. Good, good.

981
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:19,852
Good.

982
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:23,355
Don't worry, Mr. Parker. I'll be back.

983
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,608
Wonderful things are coming.

984
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:29,528
Wonderful things.

985
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:45,461
Fred?

986
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:52,384
Mr. Mayor,
if there was a giant dinosaur...

987
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:55,095
...running around,
you would be the first to know.

988
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:57,764
So tell your son
he can rest easy, all right?

989
01:22:57,931 --> 01:22:59,975
Yeah. You and me both, sir.

990
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:02,352
Okay. Bye-bye.

991
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:04,438
Mr. Parker, why are you...

992
01:23:04,605 --> 01:23:06,398
- ...not in school?
- Got a free track.

993
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:09,234
Okay, well, I do not.
So make your point quickly.

994
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:11,778
Fine, there may not be
a dinosaur running around.

995
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:14,239
There is something more dangerous,
and I know who.

996
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:15,991
- You know who?
- Dr. Curtis Connors.

997
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:17,534
- He's a biochemist.
- Of Oscorp?

998
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:19,203
- That's right.
- Dr. Connors...

999
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:21,371
...who's my daughter's mentor.
Is that who?

1000
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:22,748
- That's the one.
- Okay.

1001
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:26,210
Recently, Dr. Connors gave Gwen
a glowing college recommendation.

1002
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:28,420
It was beautiful.
When I read it, I cried.

1003
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:30,797
You would have me believe that he...

1004
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:33,133
...is running around dressed up
like a dinosaur?

1005
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:36,970
Not dressing up and not a dinosaur.
He has transformed himself into a lizard.

1006
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:41,767
Let me ask you a question.

1007
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:45,062
Do I look like the mayor
of Tokyo to you?

1008
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:47,564
I'm telling you the absolute truth.

1009
01:23:47,731 --> 01:23:50,901
This man has worked for his whole life
on cross-species genetics.

1010
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:54,613
He lost an arm, he tried to grow it back,
but the equation was imbalanced.

1011
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:57,241
He has turned into a lizard.
He's using lizard DNA.

1012
01:23:57,407 --> 01:24:01,119
He is dangerous, and he is planning
something horrific. I know. I know.

1013
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:03,747
Okay. All right, I get it.

1014
01:24:04,623 --> 01:24:05,666
Here's what we'll do.

1015
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:08,919
You'll go back to hanging out
with the citizens of Tokyo.

1016
01:24:09,086 --> 01:24:11,296
I'm gonna go back
to protecting the citizens...

1017
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,507
...of this fine, fair city of ours.

1018
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:15,968
Sergeant Butler,
please escort Mr. Parker...

1019
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:19,096
- ...back to school.
- Captain Stacy, I'm not messing around.

1020
01:24:19,263 --> 01:24:22,266
Just bring him in. Just call him in.
You have to call him in.

1021
01:24:22,432 --> 01:24:24,059
He is a danger to everybody.

1022
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:26,478
- Just, please, listen to me.
- Let's go.

1023
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:32,359
Jimmy.

1024
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,238
Get me everything we have
on Dr. Curtis Connors.

1025
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:38,824
- Okay? Right away.
- Yeah.

1026
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:06,310
Subject: Dr. Curtis Connors.

1027
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:08,020
Current temperature: 89.7.

1028
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:09,646
Steady for 48 hours.

1029
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:12,316
Blood panels reveal
lymphocyte and monocyte readings...

1030
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:14,151
...consistent with subject's past.

1031
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:21,575
Clotting rate vastly improved.

1032
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:23,243
Marked enhancement...

1033
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:24,745
...in muscle response...

1034
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:26,455
...strength and elasticity.

1035
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:36,214
Eyesight similarly improved.

1036
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:39,051
Subject no longer requires
corrective lenses.

1037
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:46,141
This is no longer about curing ills.

1038
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:49,478
This is about finding perfection.

1039
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:00,656
In attempt to redress
regenerative relapse...

1040
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:04,785
...dosage has been increased
to 200 milligrams.

1041
01:27:39,421 --> 01:27:41,089
You stopped me once.

1042
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:44,718
You won't stop me again.

1043
01:27:46,344 --> 01:27:49,347
I'm getting stronger every day!

1044
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:30,388
Oh, that sucked.

1045
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:43,026
Peter Parker.

1046
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:01,962
Come in.

1047
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:07,717
You should maybe
consider coming in through the lobby.

1048
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:12,472
Also, my father is under
the impression...

1049
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:15,475
- ...that you require psychiatric attention.
- Oh, really?

1050
01:29:15,642 --> 01:29:17,269
Peter.

1051
01:29:17,894 --> 01:29:20,272
- What happened?
- You should see the other guy.

1052
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:26,528
The other guy, in this instance,
being a giant mutant lizard.

1053
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:28,822
Hey, Gwen, honey.
Do you want cocoa?

1054
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:30,073
Howard's making some.

1055
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:36,121
No, Dad, I do not want cocoa.

1056
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:38,957
- Honestly, I'm 17 years old.
- Okay.

1057
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:43,169
I remembered somebody saying her
fantasy was to live in a chocolate house.

1058
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:44,796
Well, that's impractical.

1059
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:46,381
And fattening.

1060
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:50,719
Chocolate house.

1061
01:29:53,471 --> 01:29:55,390
- Sorry, Dad.
- It's good.

1062
01:29:55,557 --> 01:29:58,351
I can't have cocoa right now
because I'm work--

1063
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:01,605
I'm doing this...

1064
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:03,356
I have cramps.

1065
01:30:04,274 --> 01:30:06,318
I feel kind of pukey and just sort of...

1066
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:08,778
- Like, emotional. I keep crying.
- It's okay. Good.

1067
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:10,655
- Good.
- It's brutal.

1068
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:12,866
You don't want to know.

1069
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:14,200
- It's, like, bad.
- Got it.

1070
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:16,703
- Thanks, Daddy.
- All right.

1071
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:43,855
Easy, Bug Boy.

1072
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:46,149
What'd you call me?

1073
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:52,948
I'm going to be all right.

1074
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:55,825
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

1075
01:30:57,202 --> 01:30:59,704
I know what this is.

1076
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:01,164
What is it?

1077
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:05,293
Every day, for as long
as I can remember, my father...

1078
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,920
...has left every morning...

1079
01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:09,756
...and he's put a badge on his chest...

1080
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:12,342
...and strapped a gun to his hip.

1081
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:17,263
And every day,
for as long as I can remember...

1082
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:20,141
... haven't known
if he was gonna make it home.

1083
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:31,277
I got you.

1084
01:31:32,529 --> 01:31:33,780
Okay?

1085
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:37,575
Okay?

1086
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:41,079
I gotta stop him, though.

1087
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:44,624
I have to, because I created him.

1088
01:31:47,961 --> 01:31:49,629
What do you mean?

1089
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:52,924
I gave him an equation...

1090
01:31:55,468 --> 01:31:57,721
...that made all of this possible.

1091
01:32:05,228 --> 01:32:08,106
Something my father
had been working on, you know.

1092
01:32:08,273 --> 01:32:11,276
Secretly. Now I realize
why he kept it a secret.

1093
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:16,489
Point is, this is my responsibility.

1094
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:22,037
I have to fix it.

1095
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:26,791
Peter.

1096
01:32:27,834 --> 01:32:29,544
Hey.

1097
01:32:32,839 --> 01:32:34,966
Let's get out of here.

1098
01:32:35,133 --> 01:32:36,926
Let's just get out of here.

1099
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:39,054
Just for a minute. Can we?

1100
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:41,473
- No. No.
- Yeah. Yes.

1101
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:42,807
- Yes.
- No.

1102
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:44,225
Yes.

1103
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:46,811
If my parents see me leaving,
I'm dead.

1104
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:53,651
Your parents aren't
gonna see you leaving.

1105
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,458
Peter Parker.

1106
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:10,502
Spider-Man.

1107
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:13,922
I'm not the one who needs help.

1108
01:33:14,089 --> 01:33:17,383
There will be no more loneliness,
no more outcasts.

1109
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:21,304
Species-wide distribution
could enhance...

1110
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:24,140
...humanity on an evolutionary scale.

1111
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:26,851
One has to adapt to survive.

1112
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:32,732
"That, changing like the snake,
I might be free...

1113
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:36,528
...to cast off flesh
wherein I dwell confined."

1114
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:40,990
Would you give it all up
after all you know you can do?

1115
01:33:41,157 --> 01:33:43,785
All the power you feel.

1116
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:49,791
I can save them!

1117
01:33:56,339 --> 01:34:00,802
You won't get in the way of my plan,
Peter Parker!

1118
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:28,121
Go. Go!

1119
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:06,492
Nowhere to hide, Peter.

1120
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:26,512
All these souls lost and alone.

1121
01:35:26,679 --> 01:35:29,307
I can save them.
I can cure them.

1122
01:35:29,474 --> 01:35:32,393
There's no need to stop me, Peter.

1123
01:35:41,694 --> 01:35:43,947
You're not thinking straight, doc.

1124
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:49,327
Stop this. This isn't you.

1125
01:35:54,249 --> 01:35:55,792
Let's talk this out.

1126
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:57,794
Doc!

1127
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:04,259
Oh, boy.

1128
01:36:09,847 --> 01:36:11,557
So you don't want to talk?

1129
01:36:11,724 --> 01:36:13,268
There you go.

1130
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,106
Don't...

1131
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:20,483
...make me...

1132
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:23,069
...have to hurt you!

1133
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:32,370
That is disgusting.

1134
01:36:42,255 --> 01:36:43,840
Gwen.

1135
01:37:07,697 --> 01:37:09,866
- I'm gonna throw you out the window.
- What?

1136
01:37:23,129 --> 01:37:26,007
Somebody's been a bad lizard.

1137
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:14,972
This is Lieutenant Williams
from the New York City...

1138
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:18,518
...Police Department.
We've got this building surrounded.

1139
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:29,779
Alpha, let's move ahead. Go!

1140
01:38:41,374 --> 01:38:42,708
- Hey.
- Where are you?

1141
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:45,253
I'm fine. I'm okay.
I'm in the sewer, tracking him.

1142
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:47,338
I gotta stop him before anyone gets hurt.

1143
01:38:47,505 --> 01:38:48,631
But we need an antidote.

1144
01:38:48,798 --> 01:38:51,384
- Do you know how to run a serum?
- I do it all the time.

1145
01:38:51,551 --> 01:38:53,970
Okay, great.
Okay, I need you to go to Oscorp.

1146
01:38:54,137 --> 01:38:57,140
I need you to access
the cross-species file. It's a blue serum.

1147
01:38:57,306 --> 01:38:59,434
File 12389.

1148
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,643
Okay, got it.

1149
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:02,603
On my way.

1150
01:39:34,093 --> 01:39:37,722
I spent my life as a scientist trying
to create a world without weakness...

1151
01:39:37,889 --> 01:39:40,057
...without outcasts.

1152
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:42,768
I sought to create
a stronger human being...

1153
01:39:42,935 --> 01:39:44,854
...but there's no such thing.

1154
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:50,109
Human beings are weak,
pathetic, feeble-minded creatures.

1155
01:39:50,276 --> 01:39:54,155
Why be human at all
when we can be so much more?

1156
01:39:54,322 --> 01:39:56,616
Faster. Stronger.

1157
01:39:56,782 --> 01:39:58,242
Smarter.

1158
01:39:58,409 --> 01:40:01,204
This is my gift to you.

1159
01:40:09,754 --> 01:40:11,380
Oscorp.

1160
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:14,759
- Captain Stacy!
- What?

1161
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:17,386
We have a confirmed sighting, sir.
The Lizard's headed...

1162
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:19,764
- ...toward Canal Street.
- What about Spider-Man?

1163
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:23,226
- Inside the high school.
- I want that Spider-Man off the street.

1164
01:42:09,999 --> 01:42:12,710
The lizard creature
has released a biological agent.

1165
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:14,670
All efforts to stop him have failed...

1166
01:42:14,837 --> 01:42:18,132
...and he is now proceeding
north on 7th Avenue. Over.

1167
01:42:21,844 --> 01:42:22,928
- Hi.
- Where are you?

1168
01:42:23,095 --> 01:42:24,388
Peter, hi. I'm at Oscorp.

1169
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:26,307
You have to get out of there now.

1170
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:28,851
- The antidote is cooking.
- No, no, no.

1171
01:42:29,018 --> 01:42:31,479
Connors is on the way.
He's coming to you right now.

1172
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:34,190
He needs the device.
He's gonna infect the whole city!

1173
01:42:34,357 --> 01:42:35,524
Eight minutes left.

1174
01:42:35,691 --> 01:42:38,235
You're gonna wait eight minutes
after what I told you?

1175
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:39,737
You leave right now.

1176
01:42:39,904 --> 01:42:42,198
- That is an order, okay?
- I'll get everybody out.

1177
01:42:42,365 --> 01:42:43,866
Did you hear wh--?

1178
01:42:44,033 --> 01:42:47,119
Gwen! Gwen! You Mother Hubbard.
Are you serious?

1179
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:04,762
He's heading south.

1180
01:43:15,564 --> 01:43:17,525
Stand down now, or we will open fire.

1181
01:43:17,692 --> 01:43:20,945
You are surrounded.
There is ho escape.

1182
01:43:21,404 --> 01:43:22,822
Go, go!

1183
01:44:24,759 --> 01:44:26,135
Clear!

1184
01:44:26,302 --> 01:44:27,386
Clear up top!

1185
01:44:29,263 --> 01:44:30,514
Clear, sir!

1186
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:31,849
All clear here, sir!

1187
01:44:57,124 --> 01:44:58,876
Freeze!

1188
01:44:59,543 --> 01:45:00,711
Down on the ground.

1189
01:45:00,878 --> 01:45:02,338
Your hands behind your head.

1190
01:45:02,505 --> 01:45:04,131
Now!

1191
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:08,969
Parker.

1192
01:45:10,846 --> 01:45:14,391
It's headed to Oscorp!
And your daughter's there right now.

1193
01:45:27,154 --> 01:45:28,447
You gotta let me go.

1194
01:45:43,045 --> 01:45:44,255
Hold your fire!

1195
01:45:50,886 --> 01:45:53,389
Well, Paul, if I didn't see it,
I wouldn't believe it.

1196
01:45:53,556 --> 01:45:55,975
I won't venture to say
what it is crawling up...

1197
01:45:56,141 --> 01:45:58,060
...the north side
of the Oscorp Tower...

1198
01:45:58,227 --> 01:46:01,480
...but clearly it is not human
and it is very, very strong.

1199
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:19,748
Time remaining: one minute.

1200
01:47:32,738 --> 01:47:34,949
Antidote complete.

1201
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:49,380
Oh, man.

1202
01:47:49,546 --> 01:47:52,216
We're getting the latest details.
This is just coming in.

1203
01:47:52,383 --> 01:47:56,220
The New York Police Department
has called for a city-wide evacuation...

1204
01:47:56,387 --> 01:47:58,514
...everything south of 54th Street.

1205
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:00,975
If you are south of 54th Street...

1206
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:04,228
...you have to move out
of the area immediately.

1207
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:15,656
Spider-Man appears
to be heading towards Oscorp.

1208
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:19,702
He looks injured and it's really not clear
if he's gonna make it.

1209
01:48:19,868 --> 01:48:20,953
That's the guy who...

1210
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,496
...saved my boy on the bridge.

1211
01:48:22,663 --> 01:48:26,625
Troy, they're clearing us out.
Something bad's going down in Midtown.

1212
01:48:26,792 --> 01:48:29,378
Still friends with Matthews,
that crane operator on 6th?

1213
01:48:29,545 --> 01:48:31,463
- Yeah.
- Get him on the phone for me.

1214
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:33,716
The cops are evacuating everybody.
Who cares?

1215
01:48:33,882 --> 01:48:35,926
Get him on the phone for me.

1216
01:48:53,694 --> 01:48:56,321
Hey, Charlie, get me Enriquez
on 54th Street!

1217
01:48:56,488 --> 01:48:58,574
- You got it.
- Angelo, get your mug over here.

1218
01:48:58,741 --> 01:49:01,076
Wolski! You're getting some overtime!

1219
01:49:02,453 --> 01:49:04,413
All tower cranes on 6th...

1220
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:08,292
...swing your jib arms over the avenue.
Boom angles at 90 degrees.

1221
01:49:08,459 --> 01:49:10,794
Spider-Man needs
those big boys high and lined up.

1222
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:13,297
Let's give him a clear approach. Over.

1223
01:49:46,747 --> 01:49:48,415
Come on, Parker.

1224
01:51:44,156 --> 01:51:46,241
- Hey.
- Dad!

1225
01:51:46,408 --> 01:51:48,577
- I have to get this to Spider-Man.
- Get in.

1226
01:51:48,744 --> 01:51:50,579
- It can stop the Lizard.
- Get in the car.

1227
01:51:50,746 --> 01:51:53,624
- You don't understand!
- Yes, I do.

1228
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:56,043
Your boyfriend
is a man of many masks.

1229
01:51:56,210 --> 01:51:58,670
I get it. Give me this.

1230
01:51:58,837 --> 01:52:00,631
Get in the car.

1231
01:52:04,218 --> 01:52:06,261
Please make sure he's okay.

1232
01:52:18,815 --> 01:52:21,818
Initializing Ganali device.

1233
01:52:21,985 --> 01:52:24,947
Detonation in T-minus two minutes.

1234
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:49,823
Poor Peter Parker.

1235
01:53:50,949 --> 01:53:54,745
No mother, no father...

1236
01:53:55,871 --> 01:53:57,622
...no uncle.

1237
01:53:58,790 --> 01:54:00,667
All alone.

1238
01:54:01,918 --> 01:54:03,670
He's not alone.

1239
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:25,317
Detonation in T-minus 45 seconds.

1240
01:54:33,450 --> 01:54:35,160
Hey! Gift from Gwen.

1241
01:54:37,662 --> 01:54:39,122
I got this, Peter! Go!

1242
01:54:45,045 --> 01:54:48,131
T-minus 30 seconds.

1243
01:55:05,899 --> 01:55:09,236
Detonation in T-minus 10 seconds.

1244
01:55:09,694 --> 01:55:10,737
Nine.

1245
01:55:11,905 --> 01:55:13,448
Eight.

1246
01:55:13,615 --> 01:55:14,991
Seven.

1247
01:55:15,450 --> 01:55:16,785
Six.

1248
01:55:17,577 --> 01:55:18,870
Five.

1249
01:55:19,579 --> 01:55:20,872
Four.

1250
01:55:21,248 --> 01:55:22,541
Three.

1251
01:55:24,084 --> 01:55:25,252
Two.

1252
01:55:26,461 --> 01:55:27,796
One.

1253
01:55:53,113 --> 01:55:54,739
No.

1254
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:58,201
No!

1255
01:57:09,105 --> 01:57:10,190
The captain.

1256
01:57:11,775 --> 01:57:13,276
Captain!

1257
01:57:15,946 --> 01:57:18,240
- The Lizard.
- It's okay.

1258
01:57:18,406 --> 01:57:19,574
We stopped him.

1259
01:57:20,283 --> 01:57:23,495
- Okay.
- Let's get you out of here. Come on.

1260
01:57:24,829 --> 01:57:26,164
Okay, okay, okay.

1261
01:57:26,331 --> 01:57:27,791
Look at me. Stay with me.

1262
01:57:27,958 --> 01:57:30,043
- Help's on the way, okay?
- You need to...

1263
01:57:30,210 --> 01:57:33,713
You need to be gone
when they get here.

1264
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:35,215
Okay?

1265
01:57:35,382 --> 01:57:36,675
I'm not going anywhere.

1266
01:57:37,259 --> 01:57:39,678
I was wrong about you, Peter.

1267
01:57:40,387 --> 01:57:42,305
This city needs you.

1268
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:46,851
Here. You're gonna need this.

1269
01:57:51,273 --> 01:57:53,316
You're gonna make enemies.

1270
01:57:55,652 --> 01:57:57,571
People will get hurt.

1271
01:57:59,072 --> 01:58:01,408
Sometimes the people closest to you.

1272
01:58:04,911 --> 01:58:06,913
So I want you
to promise me something, okay?

1273
01:58:08,873 --> 01:58:12,627
Leave Gwen out of it.

1274
01:58:15,297 --> 01:58:17,215
Promise me that.

1275
01:58:22,429 --> 01:58:24,097
You promise me.

1276
01:59:37,796 --> 01:59:41,091
An eerie calm has set in
over New York City.

1277
01:59:41,257 --> 01:59:42,717
Apparently, some sort of...

1278
01:59:42,884 --> 01:59:45,887
...aerosolized antidote
was launched from...

1279
01:59:46,054 --> 01:59:49,307
...Oscorp Tower, which seems
to have counteracted the bio toxins.

1280
01:59:49,474 --> 01:59:52,394
Residents of Lower Manhattan
can rest peacefully...

1281
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:54,562
...knowing that the alleged mastermind...

1282
01:59:54,729 --> 01:59:58,650
...of this terror plot,
Dr. Curtis Connors, is behind bars.

1283
01:59:58,817 --> 02:00:02,487
We've got John Niles on the street
for a report in Lower Manhattan.

1284
02:00:02,654 --> 02:00:05,073
John, what do you see?

1285
02:00:37,564 --> 02:00:39,607
Sweetheart, it's all right.

1286
02:00:41,776 --> 02:00:43,653
It's all right.

1287
02:00:44,738 --> 02:00:46,239
It's all right.

1288
02:00:46,656 --> 02:00:48,324
Rough night.

1289
02:00:49,534 --> 02:00:51,369
It's gonna be all right.

1290
02:01:45,131 --> 02:01:46,800
Where have you been?

1291
02:01:49,844 --> 02:01:51,429
Hi.

1292
02:01:56,267 --> 02:01:58,061
My father died.

1293
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:03,608
There was a funeral.

1294
02:02:05,068 --> 02:02:06,319
They shot off...

1295
02:02:08,404 --> 02:02:11,282
...rifles, and they made speeches.

1296
02:02:14,702 --> 02:02:16,913
Two of my teachers showed up.

1297
02:02:18,081 --> 02:02:19,457
And Flash showed up.

1298
02:02:24,379 --> 02:02:27,006
Everyone was there but you.

1299
02:02:41,604 --> 02:02:43,982
Can't do this. Can't do this.

1300
02:02:45,984 --> 02:02:48,027
I'm sorry. I can't...

1301
02:02:48,194 --> 02:02:49,654
What are you saying?

1302
02:02:49,821 --> 02:02:51,865
I can't see you anymore.

1303
02:02:53,575 --> 02:02:55,118
I can't.

1304
02:03:20,643 --> 02:03:22,896
He made you promise, didn't he?

1305
02:03:26,649 --> 02:03:30,737
To stay away from me, so I'd be safe.

1306
02:03:57,013 --> 02:03:58,890
What a pretty girl.

1307
02:03:59,057 --> 02:04:00,224
Yeah.

1308
02:04:00,391 --> 02:04:02,393
That's what Uncle Ben said.

1309
02:04:03,227 --> 02:04:04,979
Did you ask her out?

1310
02:04:08,608 --> 02:04:09,984
Why?

1311
02:04:10,985 --> 02:04:12,528
Can't.

1312
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:15,198
Why?

1313
02:04:17,659 --> 02:04:19,661
I'm just no good for her.

1314
02:04:22,664 --> 02:04:26,125
Peter Parker, if there's one thing you are,
it's good.

1315
02:04:27,168 --> 02:04:30,213
Anyone has a problem with that
can talk to me.

1316
02:04:47,939 --> 02:04:52,360
Peter, I know
things have been difficult lately...

1317
02:04:52,527 --> 02:04:54,570
...and I'm sorry about that.

1318
02:04:55,029 --> 02:04:58,032
I think I know what you're feeling.

1319
02:04:58,199 --> 02:05:00,618
Ever since you were a little boy...

1320
02:05:00,785 --> 02:05:05,331
...you've been living
with so many unresolved things.

1321
02:05:06,541 --> 02:05:09,043
Well, take it from an old man:

1322
02:05:09,419 --> 02:05:12,505
Those things send us down a road.

1323
02:05:12,672 --> 02:05:15,049
They make us who we are.

1324
02:05:15,216 --> 02:05:20,513
And if anyone's destined for greatness,
it's you, son.

1325
02:05:21,097 --> 02:05:23,516
You owe the world your gifts.

1326
02:05:24,100 --> 02:05:26,978
You just have to figure out
how to use them.

1327
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:30,857
And know that wherever
they take you...

1328
02:05:31,024 --> 02:05:33,317
...we'll always be here.

1329
02:05:34,152 --> 02:05:36,738
So come on home, Peter.

1330
02:05:37,655 --> 02:05:39,449
You're my hero.

1331
02:05:39,615 --> 02:05:41,284
And I love you.

1332
02:05:49,542 --> 02:05:51,252
- What's up, Parker?
- What's up?

1333
02:05:51,419 --> 02:05:52,879
Hey. How's it going?

1334
02:05:53,046 --> 02:05:55,214
You coming along, man?

1335
02:05:56,799 --> 02:05:58,342
Cool shirt.

1336
02:05:59,510 --> 02:06:00,636
Yeah.

1337
02:06:00,803 --> 02:06:02,305
Dude's crazy.

1338
02:06:02,472 --> 02:06:03,806
But chicks dig him.

1339
02:06:06,642 --> 02:06:09,353
Come on, guys, you heard the bell.
Get to class.

1340
02:06:18,821 --> 02:06:21,699
I had a professor once
who liked to tell his students...

1341
02:06:21,866 --> 02:06:25,369
...that there were only 10 different plots
in all of fiction.

1342
02:06:26,245 --> 02:06:28,164
Well, I'm here to tell you
he was wrong.

1343
02:06:28,331 --> 02:06:29,707
There is only one:

1344
02:06:30,666 --> 02:06:32,168
"Who am I"?

1345
02:06:32,877 --> 02:06:34,754
Mr. Parker.

1346
02:06:34,921 --> 02:06:35,963
Tardy again.

1347
02:06:37,924 --> 02:06:39,759
At least we can always count on you.

1348
02:06:39,926 --> 02:06:42,720
Sorry, Miss Ritter,
won't happen again, I promise.

1349
02:06:42,887 --> 02:06:44,931
Don't make promises you can't keep.

1350
02:06:47,183 --> 02:06:49,352
Yeah, but those are the best kind.

1351
02:06:49,519 --> 02:06:51,354
Okay, class, open your books.

1352
02:06:51,521 --> 02:06:53,981
Let's begin on page one.

1353
02:09:48,990 --> 02:09:51,367
Hello, doctor.

1354
02:09:51,534 --> 02:09:52,868
Did you tell the boy?

1355
02:09:53,035 --> 02:09:54,078
Tell him what?

1356
02:09:54,245 --> 02:09:58,249
Did you tell the boy
the truth about his father?

1357
02:09:59,667 --> 02:10:02,461
- No.
- Well, that's very good.

1358
02:10:02,628 --> 02:10:04,839
So we'll let him be for now.

1359
02:10:05,881 --> 02:10:08,217
You should leave him alone!
