1
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,042
This tale began with the birth
of a mentally challenged bay, Rohit.

2
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:19,311
As years went by, his physical
growth continued unhindered...

3
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:22,639
but his mental age
remained that of a child.

4
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:27,067
The way he spoke,
his habits, everything...

5
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,407
But he had to pay a
price for his Innocence.

6
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,201
Everyone makes fun of me.

7
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:38,311
If you don't help me, then who will?

8
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:41,268
You are so powerful.

9
00:02:43,432 --> 00:02:48,433
Please God, please can you
give me a little bit of your power?

10
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:53,572
And, one night,
a space-ship landed In Kasauli.

11
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:56,540
Rohit found Jaadu...

12
00:02:56,632 --> 00:02:58,337
and his life turned Into bliss.

13
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,338
Jaadu blessed Rohit
with amazing powers...

14
00:03:00,432 --> 00:03:02,308
...and that transformed
him completely.

15
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:05,177
Rohit's fame spread far and wide.

16
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:07,541
One clay he received
a special invitation...

17
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:09,076
...to visit Singapore
for some research.

18
00:03:09,166 --> 00:03:12,042
The invitation was sent
by the famous Dr. Siddhant Arya.

19
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:15,474
Mr. Rohit Mehra,
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

20
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:18,201
Unfortunately Sonia
Mehra lost both her...

21
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,073
son Rohit and daughter-In-law
Nisha forever...

22
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:24,339
and her grandson Krishna
became her reason to live-.

23
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:30,041
But, she was so scared by
Krishna's baffling super powers that

24
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:33,168
she took him away to
a remote and unknown location.

25
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:36,135
But Destiny chose the path of love...

26
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:38,266
Krishna followed his love,
Priya, to Singapore...

27
00:03:38,632 --> 00:03:42,202
where he learnt the
shocking truth that...

28
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,299
his father Dr. Rohit Mehra was alive.

29
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:48,144
And was being held captive by Dr-
Siddhant Arya since many years.

30
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,001
Time saw Krishna
create a new history.

31
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:53,775
With a broken piece of a mask-..

32
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,913
...that he donned in
the midst of a circus fire.

33
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:57,476
And, this led to the birth of..

34
00:03:57,566 --> 00:04:00,669
a protector, a friend, a superhero

35
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,400
Krrish!

36
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:32,707
Kaal's experiment ls a success.

37
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:37,575
Now, this virus...

38
00:05:38,566 --> 00:05:40,407
Will mark the beginning...

39
00:05:41,165 --> 00:05:43,700
of the end of humanity.

40
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:57,067
Thank you, Jaadu.

41
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,008
I have now understood your secret
of harnessing the power of sunlight.

42
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:04,540
If this experiment is successful...

43
00:07:05,332 --> 00:07:06,732
It will usher in a new beginning...

44
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:10,302
for this world, for all mankind.

45
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,074
Just 10 more minutes.

46
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:27,066
Papa? What happened?

47
00:07:27,165 --> 00:07:28,370
Is everything alright?

48
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:29,307
Of course.

49
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,172
I am also fine!

50
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:31,386
And everything is also fine!

51
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,274
In fact, I am so excited that...

52
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:34,275
Papa?

53
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:37,067
Oh, sorry for waking you up.

54
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,234
But, It's just 9 minutes to sunrise.

55
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,638
Come on,
you have to come up to the lab.

56
00:07:42,265 --> 00:07:43,572
- Come on!
- Yes, papa.

57
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:45,140
<i>Imam!</i>

58
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,539
It should all work today!

59
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:49,566
I have tweaked the
formation to perfection.

60
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,007
My calculations should
not go wrong today.

61
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:04,075
Wow, papa!

62
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:05,265
What's all this?

63
00:08:06,532 --> 00:08:07,703
My years of hardwork...

64
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,502
and endeavor.

65
00:08:11,632 --> 00:08:14,075
Because life originates in light.

66
00:08:14,532 --> 00:08:16,134
Light gives life.

67
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:18,106
And, I think I have finally...

68
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,040
managed to create the
perfect combination...

69
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:22,175
to multiply the energy of light...

70
00:08:22,265 --> 00:08:23,766
by using mirrors to reflect it.

71
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,705
This magical combination
is naturally present in nature.

72
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:29,043
But, unfortunately we cannot see It.

73
00:08:29,532 --> 00:08:34,033
Hence, I have invented this pen...

74
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:36,103
which is actually
an electronic device.

75
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,769
Whenever It's in the presence
of such a combination...

76
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:43,342
It gets activated
and starts beeping...

77
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,673
And then,
it consolidates and multiples...

78
00:08:48,032 --> 00:08:49,442
all the light beams and
concentrates it on a subject.

79
00:08:49,532 --> 00:08:53,271
And, manifests the life
giving properties of light.

80
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,369
You mean, the rays of the sun will...

81
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:57,102
revive this dead plant?

82
00:08:57,999 --> 00:08:58,773
What?

83
00:08:59,065 --> 00:09:00,509
But that's impossible!

84
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:03,099
What do you mean?
Of course it's possible!

85
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:04,336
It will, I am certain.

86
00:09:04,432 --> 00:09:07,035
Fingers crossed, cross them!

87
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:12,009
Papa, the sun...

88
00:09:31,466 --> 00:09:32,547
The pen has been activated.

89
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,476
This means... the placement
of all the mirrors is correct.

90
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:37,168
The formation ls absolutely right.

91
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:11,108
The power of the
energy ls far too much.

92
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:14,074
I have ta think of something.

93
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:15,670
I must do something.

94
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:18,512
Perhaps, we need to build a filter...

95
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:22,134
that passes just the
right amount of radiance...

96
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:25,506
and absorbs the rest of the energy.

97
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:27,076
You mean...

98
00:11:27,165 --> 00:11:29,473
a filter with a brain, papa?

99
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,234
Correct-A filter with a brain!

100
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:38,208
Easy, I will build It.

101
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:39,341
And then you'll see.

102
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,772
This experiment will
change face of solar energy-.

103
00:11:45,632 --> 00:11:47,632
What are you staring at?
Don't you have work today?

104
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,720
Corrie on, time to get to office!

105
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:53,742
A filter with a brain.

106
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:55,237
Easy, I'll do It.

107
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,536
Krishna!

108
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:10,033
Ready, Papa.

109
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:13,635
Hmm... smart you're looking.

110
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:14,736
Thank you.

111
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:18,203
Did you fix the tyre that
someone punctured yesterday?

112
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:19,136
Yeah, no...

113
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:20,403
the thing is-..

114
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:21,459
Where the hell ls Priya?

115
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:22,466
Priya!

116
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:24,033
I am coming!

117
00:12:26,132 --> 00:12:27,610
Ready, Papa.

118
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:29,072
Sure.

119
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,472
Get dressed, first.

120
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:31,635
I am ready.

121
00:12:31,765 --> 00:12:33,038
Are you sure?

122
00:12:34,032 --> 00:12:35,032
I was only touching up...

123
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:36,339
I will finish it up In the car.

124
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:45,766
Puncture!

125
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,738
Look.

126
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:55,174
Yeah.

127
00:12:56,632 --> 00:12:58,007
Wow.

128
00:13:00,132 --> 00:13:02,474
Now you look perfectly ready!

129
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:03,566
I am also ready.

130
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:07,510
Okay, since we are all ready,
let's go paint the town red-.

131
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,240
Red?

132
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:11,640
Don't you have to go
work at the TV channel today?

133
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:12,708
I have to.

134
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:15,409
But, after a quick
visit to the parlour.

135
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:22,136
Alright Krishna.

136
00:13:22,232 --> 00:13:23,301
Your office ls here.

137
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:27,326
Oh, actually my new
office ls a little ahead.

138
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,433
If you take the next right...

139
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:29,532
then again the right
after the first left...

140
00:13:29,632 --> 00:13:31,873
You will reach the security agency,
that's my new office.

141
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:33,276
Even the Air India job?

142
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:35,037
Hurry up! I am getting late!

143
00:13:37,332 --> 00:13:38,571
Don't change the topic.

144
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:39,768
What happened this time?

145
00:13:42,065 --> 00:13:43,168
I know what happened.

146
00:13:43,332 --> 00:13:44,241
What?

147
00:13:44,332 --> 00:13:46,207
When the clients must be
coming to book their air tickets...

148
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:47,776
he must have been in the air!

149
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:49,169
Hence, the airline
authorities mu st have...

150
00:13:49,265 --> 00:13:50,538
permanently grounded him.

151
00:13:50,698 --> 00:13:52,767
And told him to take off for good.

152
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:53,635
Correct?

153
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:54,437
Right. Papa.

154
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:55,732
That is exactly what happened.

155
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:57,075
Very good.

156
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,468
I'm proud of you.

157
00:13:59,432 --> 00:14:01,000
That's it. Right there-Step.

158
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:02,438
This is my new office.

159
00:14:03,065 --> 00:14:04,099
You work at SIS?

160
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:07,040
Oh husband, come here.

161
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:09,704
Yes, wife?

162
00:14:10,265 --> 00:14:12,641
I am going to leave
the studio at 4:30 pm.

163
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:15,475
You have to meet me at 5:00 pm sharp.

164
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:16,305
I hope you haven't forgotten.

165
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:17,203
Yes.

166
00:14:18,032 --> 00:14:20,203
If you are late again, Mr. Mehra...

167
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:23,140
maybe you'll get fired
from being a husband too...

168
00:14:23,532 --> 00:14:25,510
I know. Bye.

169
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,134
Bye.

170
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:30,703
Alright, papa-

171
00:14:31,065 --> 00:14:32,407
Where should I drop you off?

172
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:33,509
What do you mean?

173
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,404
I haven't been sacked, yet.

174
00:14:35,698 --> 00:14:37,301
Drop me off at the lab as always.

175
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:41,277
We shall overcome...

176
00:14:41,532 --> 00:14:43,373
We shall overcome...

177
00:14:45,032 --> 00:14:48,771
Krishna...
Kripal... You both have been fired.

178
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:50,508
Here's your termination letter...

179
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:52,309
and here's you rs.

180
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:08,736
What's wrong?

181
00:15:09,332 --> 00:15:12,707
Shrunk from a football
to a tennis ball?

182
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:16,473
Yesterday, when those four robbers
broke into the jewellery store..

183
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:21,569
You disappeared!

184
00:15:21,665 --> 00:15:23,266
Are you really surprised
they fl red you?

185
00:15:23,566 --> 00:15:24,127
But, you also?

186
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:25,676
Well, even Iran.

187
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:28,369
But I ran away, so I could come back.

188
00:15:28,566 --> 00:15:29,702
What do you mean?

189
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:30,738
I mean...

190
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:34,409
what are you all staring at?

191
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:35,379
We have been sacked...

192
00:15:35,432 --> 00:15:37,034
but you still have jobs to do.

193
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:38,576
- Get going.
- Okay.

194
00:15:38,665 --> 00:15:40,143
You don't understand.

195
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,702
Yesterday, after I ran off.

196
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:45,068
I mean, left...

197
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:49,101
who entered the store?

198
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:50,533
Who?

199
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:51,700
Who entered?

200
00:15:52,032 --> 00:15:52,442
Krrish!

201
00:15:52,532 --> 00:15:53,305
Correct!

202
00:15:58,132 --> 00:15:59,700
Understood the secret?

203
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:06,171
What's my full name'?

204
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:07,540
Kripal Sharma.

205
00:16:07,631 --> 00:16:09,405
Yes, take the Kri of Kripal.

206
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:10,169
Kri.

207
00:16:10,265 --> 00:16:11,242
And the Sh of Shanna.

208
00:16:11,332 --> 00:16:11,638
Sh.

209
00:16:11,732 --> 00:16:13,132
Put them together, what do you get?

210
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,074
Krrish.

211
00:16:15,032 --> 00:16:15,668
You?

212
00:16:18,631 --> 00:16:19,473
Not so loud.

213
00:16:19,565 --> 00:16:21,202
If anyone hears, a crowd will gather.

214
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:23,460
People will ask for autographs,
you know what I mean...

215
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:28,067
You still think I am wrong.

216
00:16:28,165 --> 00:16:29,108
Right?

217
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:30,375
Height!

218
00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:32,201
Krrish is <i>quite ta</i>.

219
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:34,004
And you are...

220
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:36,699
One has to adjust things, my friend.

221
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:38,033
Tall, when a fight is an.

222
00:16:38,099 --> 00:16:39,441
But I like to be small on duty.

223
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,731
Never mind, you won't get it-.

224
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:43,475
That's the style of us supermen.

225
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:45,142
And, you are a mere common man.

226
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:48,233
Go ahead and find a jab
that you might be good at.

227
00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:49,173
Correct?

228
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,104
Breaking news from Mumbai.

229
00:16:52,366 --> 00:16:55,173
The front landing
gear of flight AKA 101...

230
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:57,243
coming In from Delhi
to Mumbai ls jammed.

231
00:16:57,332 --> 00:17:00,367
All the attempts of the pilot
to extend It have been futile.

232
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:05,442
Failure to lock down the landing
gear can cause a crash landing.

233
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:07,634
This can prove fatal
to all the passengers...

234
00:17:07,732 --> 00:17:10,040
...and the crew present
In the aircraft.

235
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:12,068
See? Duty calls. I must go.

236
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:15,075
Where did he go?

237
00:17:19,332 --> 00:17:21,241
Mumbai Control. AKA 101...

238
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,241
waiting for Instructions.

239
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,207
AKA 101

240
00:17:24,531 --> 00:17:28,475
we have cleared runway
2-7 for emergency landing...

241
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,076
you are cleared to land.

242
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:32,074
Best of Luck.

243
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:35,641
Sir, landing without an
extended nose landing gear...

244
00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:37,473
can cause the plane to skid...

245
00:17:37,631 --> 00:17:38,665
It can even explode.

246
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:40,572
We don't have any other option.

247
00:17:40,665 --> 00:17:42,007
We have run out of fuel.

248
00:17:42,366 --> 00:17:43,487
We have to take this chance.

249
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,575
Pay Attention, please keep
your seat belts fastened...

250
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:49,609
and take brace position for landing.

251
00:17:49,698 --> 00:17:51,005
What did he say?

252
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:52,138
What's happening?

253
00:17:52,232 --> 00:17:54,267
Looks like something ls really wrong.

254
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,531
What's going on?

255
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:04,772
Mom, we are going ta be-fine?

256
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:16,105
God, Please help us. Please...

257
00:20:40,298 --> 00:20:41,435
Bravo, Krrish.

258
00:21:19,231 --> 00:21:21,039
Super job, Krrish.

259
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:29,304
We have safely landed.

260
00:21:37,264 --> 00:21:38,106
Krrish!

261
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:40,574
- Look mum, Krrish!
- What? Where?

262
00:21:47,565 --> 00:21:51,135
An epidemic of an unknown
virus has broken out in Namibia.

263
00:21:51,231 --> 00:21:53,334
Disturbing images of
the virus outbreak have..

264
00:21:53,431 --> 00:21:56,103
Just come in from
the city of Gobabis.

265
00:22:17,631 --> 00:22:20,041
Our correspondent ls currently
at the local office...

266
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:21,733
...of the International
Health Council...

267
00:22:22,065 --> 00:22:24,542
waiting for a statement from
Dr. Varun Shetty...

268
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:27,041
...Regional Director of the WHO.

269
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,572
On my return from
Namibia this morning...

270
00:22:29,665 --> 00:22:33,199
I have immediately briefed
senior members of the IHC...

271
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:35,537
about the current
state of this outbreak.

272
00:22:36,065 --> 00:22:39,134
This virus needs to be
contained as soon as possible.

273
00:22:39,765 --> 00:22:43,208
Otherwise the consequences would be,
would be catastrophic.

274
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:46,231
Infected samples of blood have
been dispatched to distinguished...

275
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:48,208
Scientists and doctors
In all parts of the world.

276
00:22:48,565 --> 00:22:50,474
We need,
we need all the help possible...

277
00:22:50,565 --> 00:22:52,201
...In coming out with an antidote.

278
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:56,732
It is now quite clear that
the Namibia crisis is escalating.

279
00:22:57,032 --> 00:22:59,134
Our channel has set
up a toll free emergency...

280
00:22:59,231 --> 00:23:01,368
...help line for any
virus related information-.

281
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:03,670
Hello, Yes, Dr. Shetty?

282
00:23:03,765 --> 00:23:06,107
Dr. Mehra, I am sure you must have...

283
00:23:06,198 --> 00:23:08,176
heard about the
life threatening virus...

284
00:23:09,698 --> 00:23:11,141
that is creating panic in Namibia-.

285
00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:13,038
Yes, we just saw It on TV...

286
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:16,100
Dr. Shetty, how long does It take-fer
the symptoms of this virus to show?

287
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:18,176
What ls the Incubation period?

288
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:22,408
People start exhibiting
the symptoms within...

289
00:23:22,732 --> 00:23:25,266
...5 seconds to 5 minutes of contact.

290
00:23:26,398 --> 00:23:28,740
This virus is spreading
rapidly through air and water-.

291
00:23:29,398 --> 00:23:31,035
We have sent the
blood samples of the...

292
00:23:31,098 --> 00:23:32,474
...infected people
to several labs worldwide.

293
00:23:32,565 --> 00:23:33,770
You will receive It too.

294
00:23:34,098 --> 00:23:35,378
And, I am really hopeful that...

295
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:37,705
you will be successful
In coming up with a solution.

296
00:23:37,732 --> 00:23:40,539
That's why,
you are my last hope, Dr. Mehra.

297
00:23:40,665 --> 00:23:42,007
Please, do something.

298
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:45,632
I will give it my all, Dr Shetty.
I'll try my best.

299
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:53,372
Hello.

300
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,133
Hello, Dr. Shetty?

301
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:56,432
Yes, who's this?

302
00:23:57,665 --> 00:24:02,041
Hello sir, this is Alok Sen,
Dr. Alok Sen.

303
00:24:02,098 --> 00:24:04,303
Sir, I have to meet you right: now.

304
00:24:04,598 --> 00:24:06,405
It's very urgent sir. Please, sir.

305
00:24:06,498 --> 00:24:07,441
Regarding what?

306
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:08,634
Sir...

307
00:24:08,732 --> 00:24:10,471
I have some shocking
information about...

308
00:24:10,565 --> 00:24:13,509
the virus outbreak in
Namibia and its antidote.

309
00:24:13,631 --> 00:24:14,574
What!

310
00:24:14,665 --> 00:24:16,466
I wlll tell you everything
when we meet, sir.

311
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:20,465
That's why I am calling from
a pay phone, sir-Please, sir.

312
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:22,131
Okay... calm down, Dr. Sen.

313
00:24:22,431 --> 00:24:25,068
I am heading to my office.
Why don't you come there?

314
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:26,107
The address ls...

315
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,158
Yes, sir-I know where it: is,
I'll be there soon.

316
00:24:33,164 --> 00:24:34,437
Good evening, sir.

317
00:24:34,531 --> 00:24:35,372
Good evening.

318
00:24:35,465 --> 00:24:36,408
I am expecting someone.

319
00:24:36,498 --> 00:24:37,635
- Okay, sir.
- Thanks.

320
00:24:45,698 --> 00:24:46,539
Who are you?

321
00:24:47,198 --> 00:24:50,665
Unique, Unusual, Unparalleled.

322
00:24:51,665 --> 00:24:53,768
Because, I have no history...

323
00:24:54,498 --> 00:24:55,737
no past.

324
00:24:57,064 --> 00:24:58,337
Just the present.

325
00:24:58,698 --> 00:24:59,767
Su surprised?

326
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:02,445
Whoever you are, you have
clearly come to the wrong place.

327
00:25:02,565 --> 00:25:05,668
The place is also right,
and so is the time.

328
00:25:06,665 --> 00:25:08,301
The same can't be said
about my Intentions though...

329
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:10,398
What nonsense! Please leave!

330
00:25:14,465 --> 00:25:16,306
At least get to kn ow me-first.

331
00:25:17,631 --> 00:25:20,700
I am the answer
to all your questions.

332
00:25:20,998 --> 00:25:22,374
- Look...
- You look...

333
00:25:23,631 --> 00:25:25,165
into my eyes..

334
00:25:25,765 --> 00:25:27,071
to find yourself.

335
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:34,071
What the hell do
you think you are doing?

336
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,138
Sir, there ls a Dr.
Sen here to see you...

337
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:09,138
Send him in.

338
00:26:09,231 --> 00:26:10,174
Right, sir.

339
00:26:12,131 --> 00:26:14,541
Dr. Shetty? I'm Dr. Sen.

340
00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:17,999
Thank you for meeting me.

341
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:22,300
You said you wanted to tell
me something about the virus?

342
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:24,569
Yes, sir-Here...

343
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:30,299
This contains a sample of the virus,
and it's antidote.

344
00:26:32,264 --> 00:26:34,435
I work for Kaal Pharmaceuticals.

345
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:38,433
This company experiments
with the fusion of DNA...

346
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:42,304
Of different species to
create antidotes for viruses.

347
00:26:43,064 --> 00:26:44,098
But sir...

348
00:26:44,498 --> 00:26:46,100
I recently discovered that...

349
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:50,437
before they can formulate
the antidote, they create the virus.

350
00:26:51,498 --> 00:26:53,635
They have laboratories
all over the world.

351
00:26:53,732 --> 00:26:57,107
Sir, I've collected
all evidence against them...

352
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,540
...and saved it in this pen drive.

353
00:27:02,698 --> 00:27:08,165
You were assigned
charge of Lab no. 3.

354
00:27:09,431 --> 00:27:15,239
Where you had to put together
the DNA of various species...

355
00:27:17,631 --> 00:27:20,632
but instead you put
together these files?

356
00:27:21,565 --> 00:27:22,702
How do you know?

357
00:27:24,765 --> 00:27:27,368
I know!

358
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:41,635
You've made a grave
mistake by cheating him.

359
00:27:42,431 --> 00:27:44,431
He can't stand traitors.

360
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:07,236
This is Kaya.

361
00:28:07,331 --> 00:28:09,002
A miracle of science.

362
00:28:09,298 --> 00:28:12,071
Created by the one,
who ls creating...

363
00:28:12,164 --> 00:28:16,074
his own, new and
extraordinary world on Earth.

364
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:23,709
This is Kaal.

365
00:28:24,765 --> 00:28:29,175
He believes that he is the
master of his awn life and destiny.

366
00:28:29,398 --> 00:28:31,034
An enigma.

367
00:28:32,164 --> 00:28:34,506
A scientific genius.

368
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:41,068
His research of many years
is now capable of changing the world-.

369
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:50,536
But he began every experiment
with the aim of changing himself.

370
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,734
It ls rather ironic that...

371
00:28:55,998 --> 00:29:02,432
a brain so sharp ls housed In a body
that ls paralyzed below the neck...

372
00:29:04,164 --> 00:29:06,767
except for two of his fingers.

373
00:29:08,198 --> 00:29:10,676
Unbelievable as It ls,
but It ls true...

374
00:29:11,031 --> 00:29:17,203
that Kaal can conjure up the power
of his mind Into these two fingers...

375
00:29:17,732 --> 00:29:21,335
to lift things, make them fly, or
destroy them, through telekinesis.

376
00:29:23,064 --> 00:29:27,668
Yet, he has been attempting
to obtain the bone marrow...

377
00:29:27,764 --> 00:29:29,640
which would rejuvenate him.

378
00:29:31,431 --> 00:29:35,170
But when Kaal,
with his unusual DNA...

379
00:29:35,264 --> 00:29:37,606
could not find his
cure among humans...

380
00:29:38,665 --> 00:29:42,199
he began experimenting on animals.

381
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:45,608
Fusing together his DNA and
blood with that of the animals'...

382
00:29:45,698 --> 00:29:47,471
Kaal created creatures
as one creates test tube babies.

383
00:29:47,565 --> 00:29:50,702
In this process,
Kaal made such amazing creatures...

384
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,275
whose mind and soul were Kaal's.

385
00:29:53,398 --> 00:29:58,035
Human in appearance but
beastly In nature and strength.

386
00:29:58,498 --> 00:30:00,498
Kaal has named them...

387
00:30:01,264 --> 00:30:02,537
Manimals!

388
00:30:02,631 --> 00:30:08,507
But despite all efforts Kaal
hasn't found the bone marrow yet.

389
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:12,042
His search still continues.

390
00:30:13,098 --> 00:30:14,303
Initiate!

391
00:30:44,431 --> 00:30:46,067
Start Deliquidation!

392
00:32:06,998 --> 00:32:09,203
Fusion ls the future!

393
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:12,775
Begin the final test.

394
00:32:49,198 --> 00:32:52,005
Kaal... - Let it learn
to survive In this environment...

395
00:32:53,465 --> 00:32:57,170
and, continue your research.

396
00:32:58,597 --> 00:33:00,405
I am sure you will
find that bone marrow.

397
00:33:00,498 --> 00:33:02,600
And success will be yours soon.

398
00:33:02,697 --> 00:33:05,471
I am successful even today.

399
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:10,537
You may have noticed the lethal
strike of my new manimal, Striker.

400
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,441
Success was Kaal's...

401
00:33:15,231 --> 00:33:16,708
even when he made you.

402
00:33:17,597 --> 00:33:20,371
Fusing my blood with
that of a chameleon's.

403
00:33:20,497 --> 00:33:23,737
That's the reason you
can change your form and shape.

404
00:33:23,998 --> 00:33:26,237
Wherever, whenever.

405
00:33:27,998 --> 00:33:31,306
Let's find out how many lives
the virus has claimed in Namibia-.

406
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:40,603
These red dots Indicate
that more than...

407
00:33:40,697 --> 00:33:44,039
40%of Namibia's population
has been Infected by the virus.

408
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,470
This has thrown many genius
scientists off their keel.

409
00:33:48,731 --> 00:33:52,266
Our scientists want to know
when we should send our antidote.

410
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:56,602
Let sortie more people die.

411
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:00,433
Let there be more fear.

412
00:34:01,597 --> 00:34:03,632
It's simple science, Kaya.

413
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:11,439
Our profit will rise
as people's hopes fall.

414
00:34:16,998 --> 00:34:19,374
This virus ls not natural...

415
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,006
It was created.

416
00:34:22,464 --> 00:34:25,499
But, sir... who would do such a thing?

417
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:28,041
A madman.

418
00:34:28,597 --> 00:34:31,700
Dr. Mehra,
an antidote has been successfully...

419
00:34:31,998 --> 00:34:34,101
...made for the virus
outbreak In Namibia.

420
00:34:35,164 --> 00:34:38,370
This breakthrough was achieved by a
company called Kaal Pharmaceuticals.

421
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:42,200
The antidote has reached Namibia
and the situation ls under control.

422
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,108
Thank God!

423
00:34:45,664 --> 00:34:48,006
This antidote has
proved yet again that...

424
00:34:48,497 --> 00:34:52,306
there are more kind hearted
people than evil ones.

425
00:34:57,298 --> 00:34:58,673
Krrish.

426
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:00,431
Krrish.

427
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:03,369
Al Sabah 13th floor, Millat Nagar.

428
00:35:04,164 --> 00:35:07,074
Help! Help me!

429
00:35:07,365 --> 00:35:08,433
Mummy!

430
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,006
Somebody, help!

431
00:35:10,098 --> 00:35:11,269
Vicky!

432
00:35:11,464 --> 00:35:13,738
Help! Help me!

433
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,669
Help me.

434
00:35:31,731 --> 00:35:35,470
There's no need to be scared anymore,
you are safe now.

435
00:35:35,998 --> 00:35:37,305
Okay?

436
00:35:38,298 --> 00:35:40,207
In fact, we're both safe.

437
00:35:42,231 --> 00:35:44,004
But tell me something...

438
00:35:44,597 --> 00:35:47,632
what were you doing up there?

439
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:53,368
I was doing my homework, when
I saw a pigeon stuck In the wires..-...

440
00:35:53,564 --> 00:35:55,008
struggling to break free.

441
00:35:55,098 --> 00:35:57,735
So I went up to the
roof to set It free.

442
00:35:57,998 --> 00:36:00,306
Though I have small hands...

443
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:03,406
I managed to set the pigeon free.

444
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:05,372
But I got trapped.

445
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,497
Mother, help me. Mother.

446
00:36:08,664 --> 00:36:10,733
But you saved me, Krrish.

447
00:36:11,064 --> 00:36:12,336
Thank you, Krrish.

448
00:36:14,164 --> 00:36:15,505
Thank you...

449
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,330
Krrish.

450
00:36:18,064 --> 00:36:18,700
Me?

451
00:36:18,998 --> 00:36:20,305
You saved the pigeon's life.

452
00:36:21,731 --> 00:36:26,176
Anyone who takes away tears
and spreads happiness is Krrish!

453
00:36:26,364 --> 00:36:28,172
Wow, even I am Krrish!

454
00:36:28,397 --> 00:36:29,670
Yes.

455
00:36:29,764 --> 00:36:33,606
But, Krrish,
yea have a mask, a suit...

456
00:36:33,998 --> 00:36:35,373
and super powers.

457
00:36:36,064 --> 00:36:37,167
What do I have?

458
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:43,265
You have an Innocence which
has taught me a lesson today-.

459
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,997
That, age doesn't matter,
courage does.

460
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:58,502
Here's a small gift,
from Krrish, to little Krrish.

461
00:37:00,297 --> 00:37:04,208
This ls now the symbol of
your honesty and righteousness.

462
00:37:06,164 --> 00:37:07,368
Welcome to the team.

463
00:37:08,198 --> 00:37:10,539
Team? I am a part
of your team, Krrish?

464
00:37:11,464 --> 00:37:13,204
Yes, but you must promise me that...

465
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:16,064
you won't try to imitate me by...

466
00:37:16,164 --> 00:37:18,664
...climbing,
jumping and leaping off buildings.

467
00:37:19,098 --> 00:37:20,575
- Promise?
- I promise, Krrish.

468
00:37:32,764 --> 00:37:34,003
Gone.

469
00:37:34,564 --> 00:37:37,008
Sir... yes, sir?

470
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,605
Welcome!

471
00:37:40,597 --> 00:37:42,075
How nice of you to make It an time!

472
00:37:42,731 --> 00:37:45,039
Might as well have
come after we closed.

473
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,371
By the way,
may I ask you what took you so long?

474
00:37:48,564 --> 00:37:50,167
I had to go, sir.

475
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,001
You had to go?

476
00:37:51,064 --> 00:37:51,564
Yes, sir.

477
00:37:51,664 --> 00:37:53,335
It was more Important than your job?

478
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,271
No.

479
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,669
The guests were waiting
for Chinese food...

480
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,674
and they left with a mouthful
of Indian abuses... Breaking news!

481
00:37:58,764 --> 00:37:59,366
Do you get It?

482
00:37:59,464 --> 00:38:02,136
Eternal savior,
Krrish, rescued another kid and...

483
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,504
safely reunited him with his family.

484
00:38:04,764 --> 00:38:08,469
Proving yet again, where
there's crisis, there is Krrish.

485
00:38:09,764 --> 00:38:13,174
On one hand there's Krrish.

486
00:38:13,464 --> 00:38:16,772
He flies like the wind,
winning over hopeless situations.

487
00:38:17,131 --> 00:38:18,611
Yes. - And,
on the other, there's you.

488
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,267
You run like the wind
from situations which need ye...

489
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,910
You could learn
something from Krrish.

490
00:38:23,197 --> 00:38:25,505
Perhaps,
If you'd been more like him...

491
00:38:25,697 --> 00:38:27,504
I wouldn't have to sack you.

492
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,503
You are fired!

493
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,469

Today ls a very happy day for us.

568
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:44,669
When kids grow up...

569
00:45:44,763 --> 00:45:46,673
they start treating elders like kids.

570
00:45:47,097 --> 00:45:50,098
I know It's Krishna's birthday today.

571
00:45:51,097 --> 00:45:53,439
I've even got him a gift.

572
00:45:56,263 --> 00:45:58,241
There's some other good news.

573
00:45:58,497 --> 00:46:01,770
And Mr. Balgopal will
tell you what It ls, himself.

574
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:05,569
Some other good news?

575
00:46:06,664 --> 00:46:10,198
And, who ls Mr. Balgopal?

576
00:46:12,564 --> 00:46:14,564
I don't think I even
have any friends by this name.

577
00:46:15,697 --> 00:46:17,140
Actually, I may just.

578
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:19,910
One can't even recall all
the names of his friends at this age.

579
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:31,030
Balgopal?

580
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:35,531
That's your name tool

581
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:43,630
You are going to be a grandpa.

582
00:46:47,997 --> 00:46:49,100
Grandpa?

583
00:46:52,464 --> 00:46:53,339
Really?

584
00:46:53,464 --> 00:46:54,305
Yes, Papa-

585
00:47:20,997 --> 00:47:24,498
Every father wants
to see his kids grow up.

586
00:47:25,263 --> 00:47:27,366
Wants to play with them,
fool around with them...

587
00:47:28,197 --> 00:47:30,300
But that joy was taken away from me.

588
00:47:31,597 --> 00:47:35,632
I could not see the number
of times you fell dawn...

589
00:47:36,297 --> 00:47:38,536
the number of times you
got back up on year feet-..

590
00:47:39,497 --> 00:47:41,338
All the times you came
home covered in mu ck.

591
00:47:42,464 --> 00:47:44,702
I still regret net being
able to witness all of that-.

592
00:47:45,997 --> 00:47:47,633
But, now, I have no regrets.

593
00:47:48,564 --> 00:47:49,734
No complaints.

594
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:52,274
So what If I couldn't
be there as a father.

595
00:47:52,497 --> 00:47:55,600
I will be there now, as a grandpa.

596
00:47:56,197 --> 00:47:57,765
I will live up your childhood...

597
00:47:58,763 --> 00:48:00,105
through your child.

598
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:08,532
Thank you, Priya,
for completing our small family.

599
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:10,430
And yes.

600
00:48:13,297 --> 00:48:14,740
Happy birthday, Krishna.

601
00:48:15,696 --> 00:48:19,231
Here's a small gift for you-..
for both of ye...

602
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:20,602
Okay, Pa Pa-

603
00:48:22,464 --> 00:48:25,237
And I will distribute these
sweets among my colleagues.

604
00:48:25,497 --> 00:48:26,566
Everyone will be thrilled.

605
00:48:26,663 --> 00:48:27,606
It will be a fun day.

606
00:49:20,464 --> 00:49:22,237
What are you doing, Kaal?

607
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:26,201
If only I had the use
of all of my fingers...

608
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,701
my whole hand...

609
00:49:30,097 --> 00:49:32,473
my entire body-.

610
00:49:35,364 --> 00:49:40,433
You have no idea what
I would be capable of.

611
00:49:41,629 --> 00:49:43,335
I am still amazed...

612
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,563
how you manage to do, what you do.

613
00:49:45,763 --> 00:49:47,604
How did you get these powers?

614
00:49:48,263 --> 00:49:49,468
What ls the secret behind It?

615
00:49:49,997 --> 00:49:51,997
In spite of being so powerful,
why Is...

616
00:49:52,097 --> 00:49:54,234
...your body still
wheelchair bound, Kaal?

617
00:49:58,596 --> 00:50:00,540
Kaal, you are choking me.

618
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:02,269
It hurts.

619
00:50:02,364 --> 00:50:04,000
And It should.

620
00:50:04,563 --> 00:50:07,303
Because, you have hurt me.

621
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,138
By asking me the question...

622
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:14,301
for which I don't have an answer.

623
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:20,004
And I am still searching for it.

624
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,601
What are you doing, son?

625
00:50:28,596 --> 00:50:31,268
Don't misuse your powers.

626
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:34,766
Don't use your powers
for destruction.

627
00:50:35,596 --> 00:50:38,506
How many times have I told you, Kaal?

628
00:50:38,629 --> 00:50:40,698
And haw many times
have I asked you, dad?

629
00:50:41,364 --> 00:50:43,239
How did I get these powers?

630
00:50:43,596 --> 00:50:44,733
Why am I like this?

631
00:50:45,397 --> 00:50:46,465
I don't know that.

632
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:48,730
You have been lying all this while.

633
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:51,003
You are lying new too.

634
00:50:51,097 --> 00:50:53,132
Trust me, I am telling you the truth.

635
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:55,602
Stop It, Kaal.

636
00:51:05,364 --> 00:51:06,398
Kaal...

637
00:51:12,496 --> 00:51:14,236
I didn't find an answer then.

638
00:51:15,463 --> 00:51:18,771
Even after all this research,
all these experiments...

639
00:51:20,097 --> 00:51:21,540
I still haven't found the answer-.

640
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:26,099
But, I know science has the answer.

641
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:29,239
And, therein lies my cure-.

642
00:51:30,997 --> 00:51:33,202
My cu re lies in that answer-.

643
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:40,035
I have spent millions.

644
00:51:40,596 --> 00:51:42,540
I will spend billions.

645
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:49,701
Doctors, how much have we earned
from the antidote sales In Namibia?

646
00:51:51,696 --> 00:51:54,606
320 million dollars and counting.

647
00:51:54,696 --> 00:51:57,731
A little fear and
320 million dollars.

648
00:51:57,997 --> 00:51:59,406
And still counting!

649
00:52:00,496 --> 00:52:02,236
The business of fear...

650
00:52:02,496 --> 00:52:04,440
ls the best business.

651
00:52:05,364 --> 00:52:09,398
But now millions are net enough,
we need to earn in billions.

652
00:52:10,063 --> 00:52:14,370
It ls now time,
to plant the virus In a country...

653
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:16,135
that has a population of billions.

654
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:35,304
India? Or, China'?

655
00:52:36,097 --> 00:52:38,472
China's population surpasses
that of India, Kaal.

656
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:42,304
But a million Gods rule over India.

657
00:52:42,696 --> 00:52:45,333
And people have
immense faith in them.

658
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:50,640
Let's find out If
any one of their Gods...

659
00:52:51,263 --> 00:52:56,468
can save them from our virus.

660
00:54:28,329 --> 00:54:29,529
Krishna, let's have Ice cream?

661
00:54:30,296 --> 00:54:31,239
Ice cream?

662
00:54:31,763 --> 00:54:33,365
But I heard, during pregnancy...

663
00:54:33,463 --> 00:54:34,703
women like to have sour things.

664
00:54:35,463 --> 00:54:36,566
But I am craving for sweet things.
- Really?

665
00:54:36,663 --> 00:54:40,005
Because I want our baby
to turn out sweet, like you.

666
00:54:40,563 --> 00:54:41,540
Okay.

667
00:54:43,262 --> 00:54:44,535
Let's go and sit there.

668
00:54:46,229 --> 00:54:48,229
Stop licking the Ice cream like that!

669
00:54:51,763 --> 00:54:54,002
You ate up my ice cream'?

670
00:54:54,262 --> 00:54:56,240
I thought you got it for me!

671
00:55:01,696 --> 00:55:02,639
I couldn't eat my own!

672
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:03,764
How could I eat yours?

673
00:55:04,063 --> 00:55:06,098
- Let's get another one.
- Let's go.

674
00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:09,273
Kri pal, what's up?

675
00:55:09,529 --> 00:55:10,529
I am quite worked up.

676
00:55:10,696 --> 00:55:13,230
I am trying to control my anger.

677
00:55:13,329 --> 00:55:15,637
Because I was just accused
of being an Ice cream thief.

678
00:55:19,063 --> 00:55:21,233
We'd like to have same flavor again.
- Okay, sir.

679
00:55:21,329 --> 00:55:22,671
So, what will you have?

680
00:55:30,463 --> 00:55:32,771
So, you are handing
over empty cones to us!

681
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:33,970
Sir, I had filled it.

682
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:34,770
If it was full, why is it empty now?

683
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:36,507
Sir, you can see while
I fill the scoop again.

684
00:55:36,596 --> 00:55:38,006
Yes, do It In front of me.

685
00:55:40,097 --> 00:55:41,438
Two choco blocks, please.

686
00:55:43,629 --> 00:55:45,436
Sir, you saw It for yourself!
I had filled It!

687
00:55:45,529 --> 00:55:48,007
Yeah, he filled
It and yet It's empty.

688
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:50,032
Mummy, my Ice cream?

689
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:51,574
I just got you one.

690
00:55:53,196 --> 00:55:54,538
Where's my Ice cream gone?

691
00:55:54,629 --> 00:55:56,073
Where ls my Ice cream?

692
00:55:56,196 --> 00:55:57,640
Mummy, my Ice cream?

693
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,708
Can you fill It once more please?
- Yes. Sir.

694
00:56:19,229 --> 00:56:20,003
What ls It?

695
00:56:22,162 --> 00:56:23,139
I'll be right back.

696
00:56:23,396 --> 00:56:24,271
But...

697
00:57:43,463 --> 00:57:44,497
Yes, Kaya.

698
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:49,435
Kaal, Mumbai's pulse
ls about to change.

699
00:57:57,129 --> 00:58:00,006
Nerve wracking reports coming
In from several parts of Mumbai.

700
00:58:00,062 --> 00:58:03,097
This virus ls spreading
across Mumbai city.

701
00:58:03,196 --> 00:58:06,004
The whole of Mumbai has been engulfed
by a horrifying, unknown disease.

702
00:58:06,096 --> 00:58:07,574
First report came in
from 'CST Railway Station'

703
00:58:07,663 --> 00:58:11,300
In no time, a perilous
virus has taken over Mumbai.

704
00:58:11,396 --> 00:58:14,636
On roads, offices and from
every where same reports are coming

705
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,639
Similar kind If reports
are started coming from"

706
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:18,332
"other parts of city as well.

707
00:58:22,996 --> 00:58:23,531
As you can see...

708
00:58:23,629 --> 00:58:26,300
fear and horror have
spread everywhere.

709
00:58:26,396 --> 00:58:29,465
Every hospital ls facing
a similar or worse situation.

710
00:58:29,563 --> 00:58:34,200
Countless people are critical.

711
00:58:34,296 --> 00:58:38,638
And, 117 people have lest their
lives to the rapidly spreading virus.

712
00:58:39,629 --> 00:58:42,106
Someone call a crane
to move this truck.

713
00:58:42,296 --> 00:58:43,467
Dad, get up!

714
00:58:43,563 --> 00:58:45,302
Wake up, dad, please!

715
00:58:49,363 --> 00:58:51,637
Krrish, please help.

716
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:53,366
My wife's in a bad condition.

717
00:59:20,496 --> 00:59:28,305
Krrish..- my dad...

718
00:59:32,596 --> 00:59:35,335
Krrish, save my child

719
00:59:35,763 --> 00:59:37,206
Krrish, my children...

720
00:59:39,129 --> 00:59:42,403
Krrish, please save my wife...

721
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:44,440
Save my father.

722
00:59:55,763 --> 01:00:01,366
Krrish, please help!
- Krrish, please help!

723
01:00:22,596 --> 01:00:24,301
My fear has come true.

724
01:00:25,396 --> 01:00:26,635
It's the same virus that...

725
01:00:27,463 --> 01:00:31,066
claimed thousands
of lives In Namibia-.

726
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:33,566
Oh my God!

727
01:00:34,429 --> 01:00:36,407
But there ls an
antidote for this virus.

728
01:00:36,496 --> 01:00:38,474
Contact Kaal
Pharmaceuticals Immediately.

729
01:00:48,529 --> 01:00:50,404
Kaal, after what
happened with Striker...

730
01:00:51,029 --> 01:00:53,268
we should be wary of Krrish.

731
01:00:53,363 --> 01:00:57,705
Our virus will test him too.

732
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:02,640
The Indian government has
weakened due to this virus, Kaal.

733
01:01:03,262 --> 01:01:06,433
They are contacting
our dealers repeatedly.

734
01:01:13,463 --> 01:01:16,339
Kaal, the key component
of the antidote ls ready.

735
01:01:16,429 --> 01:01:19,270
We must start working on
the antidote as soon as possible.

736
01:01:19,396 --> 01:01:22,340
How long will It take
for our scientists to make It?

737
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:24,005
10 days!

738
01:01:26,196 --> 01:01:27,765
The city will be dead In 10 days!

739
01:01:29,596 --> 01:01:33,062
People are dying In front of me,
In my arms.

740
01:01:33,262 --> 01:01:34,763
I can hear their screams...

741
01:01:35,529 --> 01:01:37,063
and, I am helpless.

742
01:01:37,596 --> 01:01:39,301
I am helpless, papa.

743
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:42,035
What is the point of me being Krrish?

744
01:01:44,196 --> 01:01:45,367
There ls a palm.

745
01:01:48,029 --> 01:01:49,063
There ls.

746
01:01:49,663 --> 01:01:53,505
In spite of being around infected
people, you are net affected-.

747
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:59,300
And neither ls Priya,
as she ls carrying your baby.

748
01:02:01,463 --> 01:02:05,373
All my colleagues have
fallen prey to this virus.

749
01:02:06,463 --> 01:02:07,532
All except me.

750
01:02:09,429 --> 01:02:13,134
That means,
we are Immune to this virus.

751
01:02:15,329 --> 01:02:17,307
Perhaps, our blood
has something that ls...

752
01:02:18,062 --> 01:02:21,404
shielding us, protecting us.

753
01:02:24,463 --> 01:02:25,304
What are you doing?

754
01:02:25,396 --> 01:02:26,796
If I remain Immune to this virus...

755
01:02:26,996 --> 01:02:28,440
...even after It ls
Infused In my blood then...

756
01:02:28,663 --> 01:02:31,197
my blood can be used to
make an antidote for this virus.

757
01:02:31,296 --> 01:02:32,569
No, Papa-.

758
01:02:32,996 --> 01:02:34,338
I won't let you do this-.

759
01:02:34,762 --> 01:02:37,604
Krishna, this ls the only
way to find a cure for the virus.

760
01:02:37,696 --> 01:02:39,401
Then, Inject It In my blood.

761
01:02:41,463 --> 01:02:44,031
No, that's toe risky.

762
01:02:44,696 --> 01:02:47,537
I could put you under risk...

763
01:02:48,363 --> 01:02:49,738
But, not the people's hope.

764
01:02:50,096 --> 01:02:52,700
Right now,
you are everyone's last hope, papa...

765
01:02:54,262 --> 01:02:55,739
not me!

766
01:02:57,196 --> 01:02:58,606
Test It on me.

767
01:03:02,463 --> 01:03:02,997
But.

768
01:03:03,062 --> 01:03:04,096
Please, papa.

769
01:03:43,363 --> 01:03:44,568
Krishna.

770
01:03:46,429 --> 01:03:47,532
Krishna!

771
01:04:02,762 --> 01:04:04,240
I am okay.

772
01:04:08,429 --> 01:04:10,065
I am okay.

773
01:04:13,695 --> 01:04:16,572
This means, I can make
an antidote from your blood.

774
01:04:17,596 --> 01:04:19,505
Now, we will be able to save people.

775
01:04:19,596 --> 01:04:22,472
It should take only a few hours...

776
01:04:24,096 --> 01:04:25,005
But...

777
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:31,005
How can we provide the anticode
to so many In so little time?

778
01:04:33,296 --> 01:04:34,603
How will we do that?

779
01:05:48,595 --> 01:05:51,005
Kaal, there's a problem.

780
01:05:51,695 --> 01:05:52,469
I don't know how...

781
01:05:52,562 --> 01:05:55,597
but, the effect of our
virus ls wearing off In Mumbai.

782
01:06:01,296 --> 01:06:04,671
One of you has betrayed me.

783
01:06:05,429 --> 01:06:07,429
You have cheated Kaal.

784
01:06:08,329 --> 01:06:13,398
I warned you that the antidote should
not reach India until after 10 days.

785
01:06:14,329 --> 01:06:16,136
How, then?

786
01:06:18,363 --> 01:06:20,102
Who did It?

787
01:06:20,429 --> 01:06:21,997
No one, Kaal.

788
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:24,006
We are still making our antidote!

789
01:06:24,329 --> 01:06:28,000
Rumor has It, that a scientist from
a research institute In Mumbai...

790
01:06:28,062 --> 01:06:30,040
has managed to create
the antidote to our virus.

791
01:06:30,196 --> 01:06:31,435
What?

792
01:06:31,528 --> 01:06:33,200
What nonsense?

793
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:37,636
How can a measly
scientist manage to...

794
01:06:37,996 --> 01:06:40,997
find an antidote for Kaal's virus?

795
01:06:44,296 --> 01:06:48,069
The antidote can
only be prepared from...

796
01:06:48,363 --> 01:06:49,738
my DNA..

797
01:06:51,029 --> 01:06:52,506
My blood.

798
01:06:53,662 --> 01:06:59,300
And how can anyone get It?
From where?

799
01:07:00,196 --> 01:07:01,230
How?

800
01:07:04,363 --> 01:07:12,035
How can my blood be coursing
through someone else's veins?

801
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:15,197
How?

802
01:07:41,662 --> 01:07:43,640
<i>Mumbai has once again proved...</i>

803
01:07:43,695 --> 01:07:51,504
to be unstoppable, unafraid, invincible
by vanquishing this virus.

804
01:07:51,762 --> 01:07:55,366
I salute the courage of this city-.

805
01:07:56,129 --> 01:07:57,572
The spirit of Its citizens...

806
01:07:57,996 --> 01:08:02,099
and more importantly
the real hero of this victory.

807
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:04,372
A friend ta the kids-..

808
01:08:04,528 --> 01:08:05,767
A hope for the grown-ups...

809
01:08:06,296 --> 01:08:08,035
and, the support to the elders...

810
01:08:08,428 --> 01:08:10,338
our very own, Krrish.

811
01:08:11,262 --> 01:08:12,671
If you are present here...

812
01:08:13,096 --> 01:08:14,505
or wherever you are...

813
01:08:15,062 --> 01:08:18,040
please know that words
aren't enough to thank you.

814
01:08:18,729 --> 01:08:22,264
Yet, we have attempted In
our small way to felicitate you

815
01:08:22,395 --> 01:08:25,067
and, this shall be the
new Identity of the city.

816
01:08:25,662 --> 01:08:27,731
And, to present to you all,
this new Identity...

817
01:08:28,428 --> 01:08:30,599
I would like to call upon stage..-...

818
01:08:31,428 --> 01:08:32,667
the man, without whom...

819
01:08:32,729 --> 01:08:35,003
even Krrish's efforts
would have been futile...

820
01:08:35,329 --> 01:08:36,738
<i>Dr. Rohit Mehra.</i>

821
01:08:39,996 --> 01:08:41,564
Please come, sir.

822
01:09:03,362 --> 01:09:06,341
Thank you for all your love.

823
01:09:06,762 --> 01:09:08,172
Thank you so much.

824
01:09:09,595 --> 01:09:12,436
But, I am sure if
you were in my place...

825
01:09:12,528 --> 01:09:14,302
you would have done the same.

826
01:09:15,096 --> 01:09:16,596
I was merely a medium.

827
01:09:17,462 --> 01:09:18,667
Our effort has been successful...

828
01:09:18,729 --> 01:09:20,604
"because of your
prayers and well wishes.

829
01:09:26,628 --> 01:09:29,731
I would also like
to thank Krrish...

830
01:09:30,129 --> 01:09:33,572
For making our nights safer and
gifting us a promise of a new day.

831
01:09:40,662 --> 01:09:43,503
Sir, do you know Krrish?

832
01:09:49,328 --> 01:09:50,772
I believe in Krrish.

833
01:09:52,162 --> 01:09:53,468
I believe that...

834
01:09:53,762 --> 01:09:55,433
we all have the essence
of Krrish In us.

835
01:09:56,129 --> 01:10:01,300
Every person, who uses
their abilities to help others...

836
01:10:01,562 --> 01:10:02,767
who extends a helping
hand selflessly...

837
01:10:03,062 --> 01:10:04,562
who stands by those In need...

838
01:10:04,628 --> 01:10:06,197
ls, Indeed Krrish.

839
01:10:07,029 --> 01:10:08,268
We all have Krrish In us.

840
01:10:08,462 --> 01:10:09,701
Even I am Krrish.

841
01:10:09,762 --> 01:10:11,104
Krrish told

842
01:10:11,162 --> 01:10:13,231
when leaved a pigeon.

843
01:10:13,295 --> 01:10:15,001
He also gave me this symbol.

844
01:10:15,029 --> 01:10:16,063
Even I have one.

845
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:17,401
Me too.

846
01:10:21,196 --> 01:10:22,537
I have one mo!

847
01:11:09,362 --> 01:11:11,567
"The Almighty"

848
01:11:11,662 --> 01:11:14,299

01:11:28,528 --> 01:11:31,006
"Who has come on this earth"

852
01:11:31,062 --> 01:11:32,767
“To execute His plan"

853
01:11:37,662 --> 01:11:40,299
"He ls a friend's friend"

854
01:11:40,528 --> 01:11:42,665
"A best friend"

855
01:11:43,029 --> 01:11:47,495
"The evil ones fear his very name"

856
01:11:47,695 --> 01:11:50,139
"The Almighty"

857
01:11:50,195 --> 01:11:52,537
"Created man"

01:12:35,428 --> 01:12:40,100
“Till yesterday he steed alone"

"I have decided to walk on His path“

860
01:12:49,762 --> 01:12:54,365
“Till yesterday he steed alone"

861
01:12:54,628 --> 01:12:59,265
"I have decided to walk on His path“

862

world a beautiful place"

"We will bring the dawn of love"

864
01:13:09,328 --> 01:13:13,773
"Together we make this
world a beautiful place"

865
01:13:14,195 --> 01:13:18,072
"We will bring the dawn of love"

866
01:13:18,595 --> 01:13:21,300

01:13:40,462 --> 01:13:42,565
"Created man"

873
01:14:49,428 --> 01:14:50,997
Looks like Krishna's here.

874
01:14:51,061 --> 01:14:52,403
I'll check, papa.

875
01:15:05,362 --> 01:15:06,998
What's the matter, Priya?
Who is It?

876
01:15:07,061 --> 01:15:08,562
No one, papa.

877
01:15:20,695 --> 01:15:22,138
Priya!

878
01:15:22,362 --> 01:15:24,067
Priya!

879
01:15:25,695 --> 01:15:27,468
Priya.

880
01:18:37,729 --> 01:18:39,400
What's her blood group?

881
01:18:39,729 --> 01:18:41,604
O positive.

882
01:18:43,028 --> 01:18:45,472
Any medical history, any allergies?

883
01:18:46,061 --> 01:18:47,266
No.

884
01:18:47,328 --> 01:18:50,135
But, Priya ls pregnant.

885
01:19:00,195 --> 01:19:03,173
Krishna, howls Priya?

886
01:19:04,328 --> 01:19:06,135
I don't know anything yet, papa.

887
01:19:06,528 --> 01:19:08,062
They have taken
her In for a check-up.

888
01:19:09,595 --> 01:19:11,095
What's going on, Palm?

889
01:19:11,695 --> 01:19:12,695
Don't worry.

890
01:19:12,761 --> 01:19:14,171
We'll soon find out.

891
01:19:14,228 --> 01:19:16,672
Thanks to you one of the
attackers ls In our custody.

892
01:19:17,562 --> 01:19:19,267
I just hope... Mr. Mehra...

893
01:19:20,061 --> 01:19:21,539
your wife ls alright now.

894
01:19:22,095 --> 01:19:24,073
But, I am sorry to say,
we couldn't save the baby.

895
01:20:12,362 --> 01:20:14,362
Papa.

896
01:20:17,995 --> 01:20:19,337
It's going to be alright...

897
01:20:19,662 --> 01:20:21,640
It's going to be fine.

898
01:20:23,428 --> 01:20:25,303
We don't need tears right now.

899
01:20:26,528 --> 01:20:30,301
Because Priya needs you, Krishna.

900
01:20:30,728 --> 01:20:32,468
You must make her smile again.

901
01:20:33,095 --> 01:20:34,575
You must teach her
how to live again-.

902
01:20:35,128 --> 01:20:37,470
And, only you can do It.

903
01:20:38,661 --> 01:20:40,333
Only you, Krishna.

904
01:21:42,261 --> 01:21:45,102
Welcome, Mrs. Priya Mehra.

905
01:21:45,395 --> 01:21:50,339
I hope you had a pleasant journey.

906
01:21:51,395 --> 01:21:52,498
Who are you?

907
01:21:52,562 --> 01:21:57,131
I know strange places
can be frightening.

908
01:21:57,428 --> 01:21:59,337
You are In Kaal's world.

909
01:22:18,728 --> 01:22:21,070
Here, I am trying to have
a conversation with you...

910
01:22:21,128 --> 01:22:23,367
and you are trying to run from

911
01:22:23,528 --> 01:22:25,130
trying to attack me.

912
01:22:26,195 --> 01:22:34,195
It's not safe to be running
In your condition, for both of you.

913
01:22:37,095 --> 01:22:40,073
So, please, sit clown-.

914
01:22:44,328 --> 01:22:45,771
Sit!

915
01:22:59,627 --> 01:23:02,105
Who ls Krrish?

916
01:23:02,527 --> 01:23:04,130
Who Is he?

917
01:23:05,761 --> 01:23:07,205
I... I don't know.

918
01:23:08,428 --> 01:23:10,030
But you do know...

919
01:23:10,095 --> 01:23:11,300
that the antidote for my virus...

920
01:23:11,362 --> 01:23:15,101
was created by your father-In-law,
Rohit Mehra.

921
01:23:15,362 --> 01:23:19,329
I'm sure you know how.

922
01:23:20,627 --> 01:23:22,196
I don't know that.

923
01:23:22,261 --> 01:23:24,738
But, I do knew that...

924
01:23:25,095 --> 01:23:29,130
only you have the answers
to all my questions.

925
01:23:29,694 --> 01:23:32,332
Look, please...

926
01:23:32,494 --> 01:23:34,995
my family... my husband...

927
01:23:35,061 --> 01:23:37,471
They must be searching for
And If they...

928
01:23:37,527 --> 01:23:40,301
We search for things
that are missing.

929
01:23:40,728 --> 01:23:42,728
But you are not missing, Priya.

930
01:23:44,028 --> 01:23:45,528
You are here.

931
01:23:45,761 --> 01:23:47,568
And there tool

932
01:23:49,395 --> 01:23:51,304
Yes, two seats please.

933
01:24:00,995 --> 01:24:02,631
Priya, all set!

934
01:24:04,627 --> 01:24:06,299
First day, first shew-.

935
01:24:06,661 --> 01:24:08,139
Shall we go?

936
01:24:21,761 --> 01:24:24,399
Where are you lost?

937
01:24:25,261 --> 01:24:26,602
I am right here.

938
01:24:27,261 --> 01:24:28,398
In from of you.

939
01:24:29,694 --> 01:24:31,195
You are In front of

940
01:24:31,594 --> 01:24:33,095
but not with me.

941
01:24:33,228 --> 01:24:34,262
What?

942
01:24:34,328 --> 01:24:36,737
If you were really here...

943
01:24:37,028 --> 01:24:39,063
you'd have sensed
that I have changed.

944
01:24:41,527 --> 01:24:44,131
Yes, ma'am,
starting today, I'm all you rs.

945
01:24:44,261 --> 01:24:47,704
Just like your channel
entertains 24/7...

946
01:24:47,995 --> 01:24:50,269
I am here at your service,
to entertain you.

947
01:24:50,328 --> 01:24:51,566
48114.

948
01:24:51,694 --> 01:24:52,694
I have the list ready for each day.

949
01:24:52,761 --> 01:24:54,034
From Sunday to Monday.

950
01:24:54,095 --> 01:24:55,504
From shopping to cinema.

951
01:24:55,694 --> 01:24:57,104
And, I won't ask for any leaves.

952
01:24:57,161 --> 01:24:58,195
Nor any promotions.

953
01:24:58,261 --> 01:24:59,397
I only want my salary.

954
01:24:59,461 --> 01:25:01,269
Which would be...

955
01:25:02,594 --> 01:25:04,300
A few thousand smiles.

956
01:25:05,228 --> 01:25:06,728
A few million hugs-.

957
01:25:07,494 --> 01:25:08,767
A few billion kisses.

958
01:25:09,728 --> 01:25:11,365
That's all I want.

959
01:25:12,494 --> 01:25:14,733
So, where do we start?

960
01:25:16,427 --> 01:25:18,167
You've read my mind.

961
01:25:18,594 --> 01:25:20,197
Where do we start?

962
01:25:22,594 --> 01:25:27,663
We start by letting go of the past.

963
01:25:52,995 --> 01:25:54,370
This ls really strange.

964
01:25:55,061 --> 01:25:58,436
His heart is beating
only once every two minutes-.

965
01:25:58,661 --> 01:26:02,071
This means, he ls hibernating.

966
01:26:02,394 --> 01:26:06,032
In this suspended state,
along with this heart rate...

967
01:26:06,195 --> 01:26:08,695
he can stay alive
for as long as he wants.

968
01:26:09,361 --> 01:26:12,272
But, human beings can't do that.

969
01:26:12,995 --> 01:26:15,598
But some animals can.

970
01:26:16,394 --> 01:26:18,736
They hibernate underground...

971
01:26:19,128 --> 01:26:21,469
and resurface only when
the weather ls favorable.

972
01:26:23,295 --> 01:26:26,273
Perhaps,
he also has that very ability.

973
01:26:27,594 --> 01:26:31,095
He ls as much an animal,
as he ls human.

974
01:26:32,728 --> 01:26:36,229
I guess, he can be called a mutant.

975
01:26:37,128 --> 01:26:38,503
Mutant?

976
01:26:39,295 --> 01:26:40,499
Yes, Krishna.

977
01:26:40,661 --> 01:26:43,139
Ancient mythology like Mahabharata
and Ramayana had such creatures.

978
01:26:43,294 --> 01:26:45,363
Shurpnakha could
even change her form.

979
01:27:21,228 --> 01:27:23,206
- Hello!
- Priya, are you okay?

980
01:27:23,327 --> 01:27:25,669
- Yes, why?
- I will be late in coming home-.

981
01:27:26,327 --> 01:27:30,238
Because one of the attackers
ls coming back to consciousness.

982
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:43,205
Once he ls awake perhaps
he can help us and we can help him.

983
01:27:45,128 --> 01:27:47,628
And, he can tell
us who It Is that ls...

984
01:27:47,694 --> 01:27:50,763
trying to attempt such a dangerous
subversion of laws of nature.

985
01:27:54,061 --> 01:27:55,436
Priya!

986
01:27:57,294 --> 01:27:58,670
Priya, why did you come here?

987
01:27:59,128 --> 01:28:00,503
I was getting scared.

988
01:28:00,728 --> 01:28:02,763
No need to be afraid.

989
01:28:07,161 --> 01:28:09,105
Krishna, I am afraid.

990
01:28:09,161 --> 01:28:10,729
He will kill me.
He will kill us.

991
01:28:11,028 --> 01:28:12,266
Do something, Krishna.

992
01:28:12,327 --> 01:28:13,600
Get a sedative, Immediately.

993
01:28:13,661 --> 01:28:14,782
Papa, you have to kill him-.

994
01:28:15,028 --> 01:28:17,388
No, no, you have to kill him,
Krishna. It'll be fine, Priya.

995
01:28:19,394 --> 01:28:21,031
- Priya.
- Kill him!

996
01:28:21,527 --> 01:28:23,130
Father.

997
01:28:23,194 --> 01:28:24,399
Father.

998
01:28:47,394 --> 01:28:48,599
That thing..-...

999
01:28:48,661 --> 01:28:50,570
he tried to kill me.

1000
01:28:51,194 --> 01:28:52,467
You saw It, didn't you?

1001
01:28:52,761 --> 01:28:55,000
If you weren't there to save me...

1002
01:28:56,494 --> 01:28:58,097
What did lever do to them?

1003
01:28:58,527 --> 01:28:59,561
Who are these people?

1004
01:28:59,627 --> 01:29:01,468
What do they want from us?

1005
01:29:02,227 --> 01:29:03,637
Priya, I can imagine
you are disturbed.

1006
01:29:03,694 --> 01:29:06,604
But, please, calm down.

1007
01:29:08,327 --> 01:29:10,202
Perhaps we would
have got some answers...

1008
01:29:10,995 --> 01:29:12,495
if he had been alive for longer.

1009
01:29:14,095 --> 01:29:15,367
But, who are they?

1010
01:29:15,594 --> 01:29:17,095
And, why are they attacking us?

1011
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:18,602
Attacking papa?

1012
01:29:19,061 --> 01:29:20,367
You think It could be because...

1013
01:29:20,494 --> 01:29:22,438
papa made an antidote
for the virus?

1014
01:29:25,095 --> 01:29:26,401
Yes, I think so too.

1015
01:29:26,561 --> 01:29:28,300
You are on the right track.

1016
01:29:29,461 --> 01:29:31,370
We can't be sure...

1017
01:29:32,361 --> 01:29:38,102
but, the attack seems to be linked
with the virus and the antidote.

1018
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:40,034
It seems very probable.

1019
01:29:41,427 --> 01:29:43,371
That means, they can come back.

1020
01:29:44,260 --> 01:29:46,135
They can spread the virus again.

1021
01:29:46,561 --> 01:29:48,630
We'd still be able to save people.

1022
01:29:49,294 --> 01:29:50,601
But, how?

1023
01:29:50,661 --> 01:29:52,297
They have burned the lab down.

1024
01:29:52,561 --> 01:29:54,163
Yes.

1025
01:29:56,461 --> 01:29:58,302
But we still have the antidote.

1026
01:29:58,427 --> 01:30:00,769
And If needed,
we can make more of It.

1027
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:08,729
How?

1028
01:30:09,694 --> 01:30:11,194
How... papa?

1029
01:30:11,394 --> 01:30:12,633
Because, Priya, we have...

1030
01:30:12,694 --> 01:30:16,036
Papa, I think,
her questions won't stop until...

1031
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:18,699
you make the antidote
In front of her eyes.

1032
01:30:20,561 --> 01:30:22,266
Because, she Isn't Priya.

1033
01:30:28,661 --> 01:30:33,435
She ls just a journalist right now.

1034
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:36,163
Yes.

1035
01:30:36,227 --> 01:30:39,728
She is indeed interrogating
like a journalist.

1036
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:42,638
Because she hasn't
been to work for so long...

1037
01:30:43,127 --> 01:30:45,037
the journalist In
her ls trying to surface.

1038
01:30:45,728 --> 01:30:48,706
That's why, you should
resume work from tomorrow, Priya.

1039
01:30:49,028 --> 01:30:50,699
And right now,
you are going to bed.

1040
01:30:50,761 --> 01:30:52,363
- But, papa...
- Let's go.

1041
01:30:52,427 --> 01:30:55,371
Krishna, let papa tell us.

1042
01:30:55,427 --> 01:30:56,996
We should know this.

1043
01:30:57,028 --> 01:30:59,471
There's no telling
when we might need it.

1044
01:30:59,561 --> 01:31:02,095
Father. Listen to me, Krishna.

1045
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:04,661
If we come to know how
papa makes the antidote...

1046
01:31:04,761 --> 01:31:06,500
we could help him.

1047
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:08,638
This ls very Important.

1048
01:31:09,027 --> 01:31:11,130
Why don't you understand?

1049
01:31:22,594 --> 01:31:24,367
I love you.

1050
01:31:44,494 --> 01:31:47,267
Mr. Mehra,
here's your appointment letter.

1051
01:31:48,227 --> 01:31:49,308
You can join from tomorrow.

1052
01:31:49,361 --> 01:31:51,498
Thank you, sir.
- Ladles and gentleman...

1053
01:31:51,561 --> 01:31:54,061
It ls now time to announce
the names of this week's...

1054
01:31:54,127 --> 01:31:56,571

01:32:04,494 --> 01:32:09,370
And our second place winner is
Mr. Pooja Mishra.

1058
01:32:09,594 --> 01:32:14,663
And today's jackpot winner, who
has won Rs. 100,000... - Thank you.

1059
01:32:14,761 --> 01:32:16,204
Mrs. Avi Shah.

1060
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:19,670
Hey! That's me.

1061
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:25,663
Hell?-

1062
01:32:48,594 --> 01:32:49,594
My baby!

1063
01:32:49,661 --> 01:32:53,264
MY baby, my baby!

1064
01:32:55,294 --> 01:32:56,636
Thank you.

1065
01:32:56,761 --> 01:32:57,999
Thank you.

1066
01:32:58,060 --> 01:32:59,663
My baby!

1067
01:33:04,394 --> 01:33:05,996
Thank you!

1068
01:33:06,361 --> 01:33:08,100
This ls from all of us.

1069
01:33:09,761 --> 01:33:11,295
What's this?

1070
01:33:11,361 --> 01:33:12,737
The symbol of Krrish.

1071
01:33:12,994 --> 01:33:15,632
Anyone who steps up to help another
person, ls rewarded with this.

1072
01:33:16,761 --> 01:33:18,534
Where can I meet Krrish?

1073
01:33:19,027 --> 01:33:20,699
I do not know that.

1074
01:33:21,094 --> 01:33:23,436
I just know that
he ls always present...

1075
01:33:23,494 --> 01:33:25,699
...at the right place,
at the right time.

1076
01:33:26,227 --> 01:33:27,671
And, when he Isn't...

1077
01:33:28,027 --> 01:33:32,631
kind people like you,
take his place.

1078
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,536
But, what did I do?

1079
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:36,299
You did.

1080
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:39,498
You have done what
any kind person would do.

1081
01:33:43,394 --> 01:33:46,270
Your good human Instincts
saved a child's life...

1082
01:33:46,661 --> 01:33:49,537
...and her mother's as well.

1083
01:33:58,461 --> 01:34:00,302
You don't understand, Krishna.

1084
01:34:09,361 --> 01:34:11,134
I love you.

1085
01:34:15,561 --> 01:34:17,061
"On heart"

1086
01:34:19,094 --> 01:34:21,698
"Tell me"

1087
01:34:23,527 --> 01:34:26,528
"Where have you been hiding"

1088
01:34:28,561 --> 01:34:30,732
"Why, today, for the first time"

1089
01:34:30,761 --> 01:34:35,569
"Have I felt you beat inside"

1090
01:34:38,327 --> 01:34:40,202
"on heart"

1091
01:34:41,627 --> 01:34:44,161
"Tell me"

1092
01:34:46,194 --> 01:34:48,570
"Where have you been hiding"

1093
01:34:51,294 --> 01:34:53,465
"Why, today, for the first time"

1094
01:34:53,527 --> 01:34:57,232
"Have I felt you beat inside"

1095
01:35:00,994 --> 01:35:03,472
"Yes"

1096
01:35:04,327 --> 01:35:08,328
"You're my heart"

1097
01:35:08,661 --> 01:35:13,105
"Has heard your"

1098
01:35:13,327 --> 01:35:18,738
"Heart's call"

1099
01:35:19,027 --> 01:35:20,528
"on heart"

1100
01:35:22,361 --> 01:35:24,737
"Tell me"

1101
01:35:26,761 --> 01:35:29,762
"Where have you been hiding"

1102
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:34,129
"Why, today, for the first time"

1103
01:35:34,294 --> 01:35:38,261
"Have I felt you beat inside"

1104
01:36:15,094 --> 01:36:19,698
"The world around
me seems to be a lie"

1105
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:28,195
"The world around
me seems to be a lie"

1106
01:36:28,461 --> 01:36:33,064
"On my dreams I now rely"

1107
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:37,627
"Lost In your embrace"

1108
01:36:37,994 --> 01:36:42,132
"The world seems a better place"

1109
01:36:42,594 --> 01:36:45,333
"This love ls"

1110
01:36:46,194 --> 01:36:48,694
"Like that gust of wind"

1111
01:36:50,627 --> 01:36:53,195
"Like that tidal wave“

1112
01:36:55,661 --> 01:37:01,469
"That sweeps away
everything In Its path"

1113
01:37:05,327 --> 01:37:07,498
"I too have been swept away"

1114
01:37:07,594 --> 01:37:09,435
"And have said"

1115
01:37:09,994 --> 01:37:13,302
"Everything I wanted to say"

1116
01:37:14,427 --> 01:37:16,530
"I too have been swept away"

1117
01:37:16,627 --> 01:37:18,263
"And have said"

1118
01:37:19,027 --> 01:37:22,301
"Everything I wanted to say"

1119
01:37:22,361 --> 01:37:27,356
"My heart has heard
your heart's call"

1120
01:37:54,594 --> 01:37:58,470
"The sky ls within my reach"

1121
01:38:03,660 --> 01:38:07,503
"The sky ls within my reach"

1122
01:38:08,294 --> 01:38:12,170
"And Earth feels like paradise"

1123
01:38:12,693 --> 01:38:17,263
"Does this happen In love"

1124
01:38:17,494 --> 01:38:21,495
"To me, new everything feels nice"

1125
01:38:22,361 --> 01:38:23,702
"on heart"

1126
01:38:25,727 --> 01:38:27,762
"Tell me"

1127
01:38:30,294 --> 01:38:33,204
"Where have you been hiding"

1128
01:38:35,394 --> 01:38:37,463
"Why, today, for the first time"

1129
01:38:37,626 --> 01:38:42,037
"Have I felt you beat inside"

1130
01:38:45,094 --> 01:38:47,402
"Yes u

1131
01:38:48,427 --> 01:38:51,303
"My heart"

1132
01:38:52,994 --> 01:38:55,665
"Has heard"

1133
01:38:57,461 --> 01:39:04,030
"Your heart's call"

1134
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:14,164
Who am talking to?
Priya, or my Kaya?

1135
01:39:14,593 --> 01:39:16,299
I need some more time, Kaal.

1136
01:39:18,227 --> 01:39:20,398
I do not have time.

1137
01:39:22,394 --> 01:39:27,202
Bring me the information
by tomorrow or...

1138
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:34,661
Kaal will obtain
It by his own means.

1139
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:50,261
Doctor, are all
the parameters normal?

1140
01:39:51,127 --> 01:39:52,570
Parameters are normal.

1141
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:54,738
The fetus ls healthy
and In the right position.

1142
01:39:55,094 --> 01:39:57,054
Then what ls It still
doing In It's mother's womb?

1143
01:39:58,526 --> 01:40:00,300
Get It out.

1144
01:40:01,327 --> 01:40:02,633
Right away.

1145
01:40:02,693 --> 01:40:05,137
But why, Kaal?

1146
01:40:05,626 --> 01:40:12,730
I want to try Injecting my DNA
In Its DNA at this fetal stage...

1147
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:16,636
and see what generates.

1148
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:23,555
Because, we have not yet conducted any
experiments with human fetuses.

1149
01:40:29,194 --> 01:40:30,535
That's right, Kaal.

1150
01:40:30,593 --> 01:40:32,094
But, It's too early.

1151
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:35,465
Pulling the fetus
out right now ls dangerous.

1152
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:36,765
It will die.

1153
01:40:37,227 --> 01:40:39,568
Until the fetus
ls three months old...

1154
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:42,067
we cannot take It out.

1155
01:40:42,493 --> 01:40:44,562
Nor, can we conduct
any experiments.

1156
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:47,560
In fact,
we cannot even do a DNA test.

1157
01:40:49,361 --> 01:40:50,736
How much longer?

1158
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:52,397
At least a week, Kaal.

1159
01:40:54,460 --> 01:40:56,336
Only another seven days.

1160
01:40:58,493 --> 01:41:02,437
And your nine month long
ordeal will come to an end.

1161
01:41:04,327 --> 01:41:09,203
And perhaps get answers
to all my questions.

1162
01:41:19,426 --> 01:41:21,371
Krishna, where are you?

1163
01:41:23,227 --> 01:41:26,205
Some startling facts
have been revealed, Krishna.

1164
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:28,501
At first, we discovered that...

1165
01:41:29,094 --> 01:41:31,628
the DNA of the antidote supplied
by Kaal Pharmaceuticals...

1166
01:41:32,094 --> 01:41:36,595
is a match to the DNA
of the mutant In our custody.

1167
01:41:40,027 --> 01:41:44,335
Even more alarming
truth ls the fact that...

1168
01:41:46,094 --> 01:41:49,765
the DNA of the antidote
created by us...

1169
01:41:50,660 --> 01:41:53,570
is also more or less the same.

1170
01:41:55,294 --> 01:41:57,430
I did several tests to confirm.

1171
01:41:58,127 --> 01:42:00,764
Every single time,
I get the same result.

1172
01:42:01,426 --> 01:42:02,631
But, how Is that possible?

1173
01:42:03,393 --> 01:42:05,099
Because we made
that antidote from...

1174
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:13,763
- I guess Priya has woken up.
- Yes.

1175
01:42:13,994 --> 01:42:15,471
- About the antidote...
- How Is she?

1176
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:18,195
She is fine.

1177
01:42:18,260 --> 01:42:20,067
- The antidote...
- Listen...

1178
01:42:21,493 --> 01:42:23,028
I am leaving for
Singapore tomorrow.

1179
01:42:23,094 --> 01:42:24,231
Take care of yourself and Priya.

1180
01:42:24,327 --> 01:42:25,429
You are going to Singapore?

1181
01:42:26,593 --> 01:42:28,299
Why?

1182
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:30,431
Because...

1183
01:42:31,493 --> 01:42:35,528
Singapore, Dr.
Arya. And his cruel Intentions...

1184
01:42:37,094 --> 01:42:39,197
are all an Important
part of my past.

1185
01:42:41,526 --> 01:42:45,629
And, the facts that have surfaced
have raised many questions.

1186
01:42:46,693 --> 01:42:52,297
Perhaps, I can only find
the answers by revisiting my past-.

1187
01:43:06,027 --> 01:43:07,732
- There you are.
- What happened?

1188
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:09,204
Are you alright?

1189
01:43:09,260 --> 01:43:11,033
Yes, why?

1190
01:43:11,493 --> 01:43:13,096
I don't know.

1191
01:43:13,326 --> 01:43:15,487
I felt like you were calling
out to me from a distance.

1192
01:43:16,426 --> 01:43:20,700
I am right here with you-
Why would I call out to you'?

1193
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:22,566
True.

1194
01:43:23,326 --> 01:43:26,463
Papa had asked for some coffee.

1195
01:43:26,727 --> 01:43:28,329
He ls still working.

1196
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:30,294
But, it's quite late-.

1197
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:32,637
Let me go check on him.

1198
01:43:32,693 --> 01:43:34,000
No.

1199
01:43:34,060 --> 01:43:37,266
He said he ls working
on some Important research.

1200
01:43:37,493 --> 01:43:39,493
We shouldn't disturb
him until morning.

1201
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:41,635
Come with me. Come on.

1202
01:43:41,693 --> 01:43:43,262
Okay, let's go.

1203
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:15,466
What's the matter?

1204
01:44:16,127 --> 01:44:17,502
No.

1205
01:44:18,227 --> 01:44:20,227
Now, I cannot break
Krishna's trust.

1206
01:44:21,660 --> 01:44:23,195
And...

1207
01:44:23,259 --> 01:44:24,669
what about Kaal's trust?

1208
01:44:27,194 --> 01:44:35,071
I will ask him to wait until
Rohit Mehra returns from Singapore.

1209
01:45:17,727 --> 01:45:18,466
Hello.

1210
01:45:18,526 --> 01:45:21,061
I have found all the answers
I was looking for, Krishna.

1211
01:45:21,226 --> 01:45:24,103
Coming to Singapore
was a good move.

1212
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:25,995
Singapore?

1213
01:45:26,326 --> 01:45:27,736
You're In Singapore?

1214
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:29,067
When did you leave?

1215
01:45:29,127 --> 01:45:30,729
Why didn't you tell me?

1216
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:32,237
Of course, I did.

1217
01:45:32,493 --> 01:45:34,062
I told you last night...

1218
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:35,569
when you came down to the lab.

1219
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:38,362
Last night?

1220
01:45:39,159 --> 01:45:40,603
When?

1221
01:45:48,526 --> 01:45:50,197
And I was going to
share some more details...

1222
01:45:50,259 --> 01:45:51,635
but, Priya woke up.

1223
01:45:51,994 --> 01:45:53,471
Remember?

1224
01:45:58,727 --> 01:45:59,727
There you are.

1225
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:01,328
What happened?

1226
01:46:02,226 --> 01:46:03,465
You're here with me.

1227
01:46:03,526 --> 01:46:04,765
But not really here.

1228
01:46:04,994 --> 01:46:06,994
Shurpnakha could
even change her form.

1229
01:46:09,159 --> 01:46:12,036
If we find out how papa
made the antidote for the virus.

1230
01:46:14,126 --> 01:46:16,105
Krishna, yea have to kill him.

1231
01:46:17,293 --> 01:46:21,135
She is indeed interrogating
like a journalist.

1232
01:46:43,093 --> 01:46:44,571
Krishna...

1233
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:47,029
Krishna...

1234
01:46:49,226 --> 01:46:50,602
Who are you?

1235
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:54,260
Priya.

1236
01:46:54,593 --> 01:46:56,093
I am Priya Mehra.

1237
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:57,733
You are not Priya.

1238
01:46:58,193 --> 01:46:59,330
Yes, I am.

1239
01:46:59,393 --> 01:47:01,462
I am Priya-.. Krishna!

1240
01:47:04,660 --> 01:47:06,535
You aren't Priya.

1241
01:47:08,326 --> 01:47:10,032
If you were...

1242
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:15,034
you would know the truth
about Krishna and Krrish.

1243
01:47:18,326 --> 01:47:19,770
Tell me who you are!

1244
01:47:24,727 --> 01:47:26,432
Where's my Priya?

1245
01:47:27,126 --> 01:47:28,229
Your Priya?

1246
01:47:28,293 --> 01:47:29,737
Yes.

1247
01:47:35,126 --> 01:47:36,570
Krishna?

1248
01:47:37,393 --> 01:47:38,769
Yes, Krishna.

1249
01:47:47,259 --> 01:47:50,032
Your tears might influence Krishna.

1250
01:47:52,259 --> 01:47:53,566
But, they won't fool Krrish.

1251
01:47:58,326 --> 01:47:59,531
Where's my Priya?

1252
01:48:01,059 --> 01:48:03,537
She ls In a safe place.

1253
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,265
Priya and...

1254
01:48:07,693 --> 01:48:09,193
your child, too.

1255
01:48:26,093 --> 01:48:29,230
Believe me,
I am telling the truth...

1256
01:48:29,293 --> 01:48:30,771
to both Krishna and Krrish.

1257
01:48:35,727 --> 01:48:37,204
Where Is she?

1258
01:48:38,193 --> 01:48:44,263
Welcome to the world of Kaal, Dr.
Rohit Mehra.

1259
01:48:45,093 --> 01:48:47,196
And, I am sorry...

1260
01:48:47,326 --> 01:48:50,031
I had to bring you
here without your consent.

1261
01:48:52,026 --> 01:48:56,437
You went to Singapore
looking for some answers.

1262
01:48:57,626 --> 01:49:01,536
Tell me, what did you find?

1263
01:49:02,493 --> 01:49:08,768
That man should
never try to be God.

1264
01:49:11,193 --> 01:49:16,228
Many years ago, Dr. Arya
had held me captive In Singapore.

1265
01:49:18,526 --> 01:49:20,299
And during that period...

1266
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:23,601
he conducted a strange
experiment on me.

1267
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:27,770
Dr. Mathur...

1268
01:49:29,126 --> 01:49:32,366
If this experiment ls successful...

1269
01:49:34,226 --> 01:49:37,033
I will have created
a new Rohit Mehra-.

1270
01:49:38,326 --> 01:49:40,634
From his own blood, his own DNA.

1271
01:49:42,493 --> 01:49:48,733
With all of Rohit's mental
and physical powers...

1272
01:49:50,660 --> 01:49:56,661
but, controlled entirely by me.

1273
01:49:57,226 --> 01:50:01,762
Dr. Arya did manage ta
create a child using my DNA.

1274
01:50:03,626 --> 01:50:06,331
But the child turned
out to be handicapped.

1275
01:50:07,126 --> 01:50:11,093
Dr. Arya. Instructed Dr.
Mathur to dispose of the baby.

1276
01:50:12,193 --> 01:50:14,330
But Dr. Mathur couldn't do so.

1277
01:50:15,126 --> 01:50:18,127
He left the baby
In an orphanage Instead.

1278
01:50:18,460 --> 01:50:20,267
- And...
- And then...

1279
01:50:23,093 --> 01:50:27,663
A rich man adopted
the handicapped child.

1280
01:50:29,426 --> 01:50:31,665
And raised him as his own.

1281
01:50:32,059 --> 01:50:36,526
That means, the one I
always regarded as my father...

1282
01:50:38,226 --> 01:50:39,670
was not really my father.

1283
01:50:42,393 --> 01:50:47,633
Because, that handicapped
child ls none other than me.

1284
01:50:49,059 --> 01:50:52,469
And you... You are my father-.

1285
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:01,765
I like It.

1286
01:51:03,626 --> 01:51:06,103
Everything's going
to be alright now.

1287
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:10,228
I found you and with you...

1288
01:51:10,326 --> 01:51:13,167
I found the answers
to all my questions.

1289
01:51:14,093 --> 01:51:18,094
Now I'll find a cure
for my condition as well.

1290
01:51:19,393 --> 01:51:24,531
I just need a little help from you.

1291
01:51:25,593 --> 01:51:27,298
What help?

1292
01:51:30,226 --> 01:51:32,568
I need your bone marrow.

1293
01:51:35,460 --> 01:51:37,028
Bone marrow?

1294
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:43,037
You can have It.

1295
01:51:44,326 --> 01:51:45,770
I will help you.

1296
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:51,404
You will have to put
an end to what you are doing.

1297
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:57,161
You must destroy this
little universe you've created.

1298
01:51:58,193 --> 01:51:59,535
Dad...

1299
01:52:00,660 --> 01:52:02,331
can I call you dad?

1300
01:52:03,093 --> 01:52:04,628
Of course I can...

1301
01:52:05,460 --> 01:52:07,233
yea are my clad indeed-.

1302
01:52:08,193 --> 01:52:10,034
Dad...

1303
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:12,338
no terms and conditions.

1304
01:52:13,193 --> 01:52:15,193
Doing that will cause you...

1305
01:52:16,193 --> 01:52:18,034
a lot of grief-.

1306
01:52:19,059 --> 01:52:20,332
Because then...

1307
01:52:21,126 --> 01:52:22,729
I will be forced to take the DNA...

1308
01:52:22,759 --> 01:52:26,101
from the bone marrow
of the baby that...

1309
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:28,401
Priya ls carrying.

1310
01:52:29,493 --> 01:52:31,198
Your grandchild.

1311
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:35,060
My grandchild?

1312
01:52:37,259 --> 01:52:38,736
But I thought...

1313
01:52:40,059 --> 01:52:42,367
- even before she could give...
- No...

1314
01:52:43,093 --> 01:52:44,628
the baby is alive.

1315
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:49,304
Because, Priya is In my custody.

1316
01:52:50,426 --> 01:52:52,165
Do you want to see her?

1317
01:53:02,226 --> 01:53:03,499
But...

1318
01:53:04,259 --> 01:53:06,237
Priya ls... there...

1319
01:53:07,493 --> 01:53:10,528
That ls not Priya.

1320
01:53:11,526 --> 01:53:13,561
She ls one of my mutants.

1321
01:53:14,226 --> 01:53:16,170
Masquerading as Priya.

1322
01:53:16,693 --> 01:53:19,170
The real Priya ls
here and she's safe.

1323
01:53:19,526 --> 01:53:21,333
Her baby ls healthy.

1324
01:53:22,526 --> 01:53:24,401
And sols baby's bone marrow.

1325
01:53:25,226 --> 01:53:28,136
You may feel that we
are all alone right now.

1326
01:53:29,393 --> 01:53:32,496
And hence,
you may torture us all you want.

1327
01:53:34,626 --> 01:53:40,195
But, you don't know the
power of a father's tears.

1328
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:47,361
That ls why you
cannot see him coming.

1329
01:53:52,326 --> 01:53:54,201
He ls our strength.

1330
01:53:55,493 --> 01:53:58,027
And he ls the end of you.

1331
01:54:04,626 --> 01:54:06,467
My real son...

1332
01:54:08,126 --> 01:54:09,536
Krrish!

1333
01:56:32,625 --> 01:56:34,160
Are you okay?

1334
01:56:34,226 --> 01:56:35,601
Yes.

1335
01:56:42,393 --> 01:56:43,563
Krishna...

1336
01:56:43,625 --> 01:56:45,001
Kaal is not In this facility.

1337
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,031
Come In, dad.

1338
01:57:33,726 --> 01:57:36,330
Look, I have found my feet.

1339
01:57:38,993 --> 01:57:41,369
- Whereas you...
- How do you feel, Kaal?

1340
01:57:44,525 --> 01:57:48,129
I was talking to my dad.

1341
01:58:12,726 --> 01:58:15,364
This ls just the beginning.

1342
01:58:16,525 --> 01:58:20,401
A lot of blood ls yet to be shed.

1343
01:58:24,492 --> 01:58:30,267
- Yes, Kaal?
- Kaya, thank you so much.

1344
01:58:32,726 --> 01:58:37,534
Because of you,
Rohit Mehra ls with me.

1345
01:58:40,159 --> 01:58:44,603
Come back here,
from wherever you are.

1346
01:58:45,993 --> 01:58:48,028
Come to the facility
where I created you-.

1347
01:59:33,226 --> 01:59:38,000
Aren't you glad to
be back In your world?

1348
01:59:38,293 --> 01:59:39,634
Kaya?

1349
01:59:42,126 --> 01:59:43,330
Kaal?!

1350
01:59:43,392 --> 01:59:49,269
Kaya, now you shall bear
witness to Kaal's powers.

1351
01:59:49,759 --> 01:59:51,600
I'm going to destroy humanity...

1352
01:59:51,659 --> 01:59:54,297
and create a race
of powerful creatures.

1353
01:59:54,525 --> 01:59:56,628
This world belongs to me now.

1354
01:59:58,559 --> 02:00:00,265
It could have been ours...

1355
02:00:01,625 --> 02:00:05,433
but, you chose a different path.

1356
02:00:07,359 --> 02:00:09,201
By betraying me.

1357
02:00:16,759 --> 02:00:24,261
I knew you would bring Krrish here.

1358
02:00:27,259 --> 02:00:30,169
And that ls exactly
what I wanted you to do.

1359
02:01:11,659 --> 02:01:13,194
Krrish!

1360
02:01:16,659 --> 02:01:19,569
You are going to need your tears.

1361
02:01:21,292 --> 02:01:23,395
Save them...

1362
02:01:25,592 --> 02:01:27,695
for your father.

1363
02:01:29,993 --> 02:01:32,732
Sorry, for our father.

1364
02:01:34,726 --> 02:01:38,068
Yes, we are brothers.

1365
02:01:39,093 --> 02:01:42,071
Two sons of the same father.

1366
02:01:42,759 --> 02:01:44,737
The only difference Is that...

1367
02:01:44,759 --> 02:01:47,760
you are the child
born out of love...

1368
02:01:48,325 --> 02:01:52,701
and, I am the child born out of 
Dr. Arya's insanity.

1369
02:01:53,459 --> 02:01:57,131
Ask him, If you don't believe me.

1370
02:02:01,359 --> 02:02:02,632
Papa?

1371
02:02:02,692 --> 02:02:06,295
I have only taken his bone marrow.

1372
02:02:08,492 --> 02:02:10,231
If he survives...

1373
02:02:10,625 --> 02:02:12,330
the world will end, Krishna.

1374
02:02:12,525 --> 02:02:17,663
Dad, you are asking one
son to kill your ether son'?

1375
02:02:20,993 --> 02:02:22,402
I like It.

1376
02:02:22,625 --> 02:02:26,569
I will gladly fulfill your wish.

1377
02:04:23,359 --> 02:04:26,132
Krrish, my victory
will be marked by death.

1378
02:04:26,192 --> 02:04:30,193
Your and your child's death.

1379
02:04:38,258 --> 02:04:42,430
No member of your
family will survive.

1380
02:05:06,125 --> 02:05:07,660
Krishna!

1381
02:05:11,325 --> 02:05:13,064
Krishna.

1382
02:05:14,525 --> 02:05:19,629
Look dad,
I made your wish come true.

1383
02:05:23,092 --> 02:05:27,366
Now, I do not even
need to kill ye...

1384
02:05:28,025 --> 02:05:31,697
Because the death
of your real son...

1385
02:05:32,225 --> 02:05:36,499
will finish you too, Rohit Mehra.

1386
02:05:55,659 --> 02:05:56,762
Krishna...

1387
02:05:57,759 --> 02:05:59,430
Krishna, get up.

1388
02:06:00,392 --> 02:06:01,665
Krishna...

1389
02:06:06,092 --> 02:06:07,365
Krishna!

1390
02:07:00,125 --> 02:07:01,762
Who are you?

1391
02:07:13,092 --> 02:07:15,092
Hey, did you get that?

1392
02:07:31,726 --> 02:07:35,192
The one that you
all pin your hopes on.

1393
02:07:35,992 --> 02:07:37,698
That you depend on.

1394
02:07:38,158 --> 02:07:40,500
Kaal has destroyed him.

1395
02:07:41,125 --> 02:07:44,035
I have killed Krrish!

1396
02:07:44,092 --> 02:07:45,434
What?!

1397
02:07:48,292 --> 02:07:49,997
Oh my God!

1398
02:07:52,559 --> 02:07:58,231
Yes, I have made Krrish a martyr-.

1399
02:07:58,659 --> 02:08:02,569
Now, It's Priya Mehra's turn.

1400
02:08:03,258 --> 02:08:04,600
So bring her to me.

1401
02:08:11,692 --> 02:08:16,033
The longer she takes to reach me...

1402
02:08:16,759 --> 02:08:22,431
the more I will torture you all.

1403
02:10:06,559 --> 02:10:08,695
A filter with a brain.

1404
02:10:12,125 --> 02:10:13,660
A filter with a brain.

1405
02:10:18,992 --> 02:10:20,629
A filter with a brain.

1406
02:10:28,392 --> 02:10:30,063
Please God.

1407
02:10:31,225 --> 02:10:35,169
Please God.

1408
02:11:17,025 --> 02:11:22,129
Krishna, never think you are alone.

1409
02:11:23,492 --> 02:11:25,730
Because no one ever really dies.

1410
02:11:26,658 --> 02:11:29,500
The soul... the energy...

1411
02:11:29,725 --> 02:11:32,499
It only gets transferred
from one body to another.

1412
02:11:33,292 --> 02:11:36,361
Old lives end but
return as new lives.

1413
02:11:37,758 --> 02:11:41,225
Look, Krishna...

1414
02:11:42,125 --> 02:11:44,535
I am coming back
to life within you.

1415
02:11:44,758 --> 02:11:47,100
Our powers are uniting.

1416
02:11:47,559 --> 02:11:49,503
We'll always be together.

1417
02:11:50,758 --> 02:11:52,498
I'll stay alive in you.

1418
02:11:52,691 --> 02:11:54,669
And In your memories.

1419
02:11:57,359 --> 02:12:01,201
And you will forever
be In my blessings.

1420
02:12:51,558 --> 02:12:54,093
What are you doing, Vicky?
Vicky, where are you going'?

1421
02:12:54,225 --> 02:12:55,566
Vicky!

1422
02:13:16,524 --> 02:13:18,661
Emotional fools.

1423
02:13:19,425 --> 02:13:22,403
All you silly and helpless
people are like Insects to me.

1424
02:13:22,691 --> 02:13:24,033
An inferior race.

1425
02:13:24,092 --> 02:13:26,400
One that I can crush anytime.

1426
02:13:27,359 --> 02:13:30,337
How will you save her?

1427
02:13:30,392 --> 02:13:32,233
We'll give our lives for her-.

1428
02:13:32,292 --> 02:13:33,633
No!

1429
02:13:34,192 --> 02:13:36,170
We'll take his life.

1430
02:13:36,624 --> 02:13:38,159
I like It.

1431
02:13:38,691 --> 02:13:41,635
You have quite an attitude
for someone so small.

1432
02:13:41,691 --> 02:13:43,328
So what If I am small?

1433
02:13:43,624 --> 02:13:45,296
One's courage should be undeterred.

1434
02:13:45,591 --> 02:13:46,728
Krrish said so.

1435
02:13:46,758 --> 02:13:49,236
Krrish... ls no more!

1436
02:13:49,292 --> 02:13:50,769
This ls the era of Kaal

1437
02:13:51,325 --> 02:13:53,495
Krrish ls the courage within us.

1438
02:13:54,458 --> 02:13:56,595
And cannot be killed by any Kaal.

1439
02:13:59,092 --> 02:14:04,298
Krrish will remain alive
until the last one cf us is alive.

1440
02:15:04,992 --> 02:15:06,129
What's the matter, Kaal?

1441
02:15:06,192 --> 02:15:07,601
Scared?

1442
02:20:26,458 --> 02:20:28,129
Krishna!

1443
02:20:29,624 --> 02:20:37,624
Such a wonderful family reunion.

1444
02:20:40,458 --> 02:20:43,402
Who do I kill first?

1445
02:20:44,992 --> 02:20:46,333
Father?

1446
02:20:46,992 --> 02:20:49,697
Or son?

1447
02:20:55,257 --> 02:20:56,758
Look at yourself.

1448
02:20:57,725 --> 02:21:01,430
You are just an
ordinary human being.

1449
02:21:02,524 --> 02:21:04,468
An ordinary son.

1450
02:21:05,291 --> 02:21:07,462
A weak father.

1451
02:21:16,024 --> 02:21:18,229
Being human is not a weakness...

1452
02:21:18,758 --> 02:21:20,429
It ls my strength.

1453
02:21:21,191 --> 02:21:24,169
Because I have the
blessing of every father...

1454
02:21:24,224 --> 02:21:26,031
and the love of every child.

1455
02:23:00,524 --> 02:23:02,229
Krishna...

1456
02:23:12,157 --> 02:23:14,499
Surprise!

1457
02:23:23,424 --> 02:23:25,299
Krishna, get up.

1458
02:23:26,091 --> 02:23:27,660
Krishna.

1459
02:23:30,257 --> 02:23:34,360
Only those who are born can die.

1460
02:23:35,124 --> 02:23:37,124
I was never born.

1461
02:23:38,024 --> 02:23:41,525
So, lean never die.

1462
02:25:10,524 --> 02:25:13,001
No matter haw powerful evil is-..

1463
02:25:13,257 --> 02:25:18,201
Good will always triumph over It.

1464
02:25:37,358 --> 02:25:42,325
Krishna, never think you are alone.

1465
02:25:44,024 --> 02:25:45,696
Because no one ever really dies.

1466
02:25:47,558 --> 02:25:49,433
We'll always be together.

1467
02:25:50,725 --> 02:25:52,225
I'll stay alive in you-.

1468
02:25:52,624 --> 02:25:54,602
And In your memories.

1469
02:25:55,558 --> 02:25:59,627
And you will forever
be In my blessings.

1470
02:26:15,391 --> 02:26:17,130
Mr. Krishna...

1471
02:26:21,991 --> 02:26:23,435
Mr. Krishna.

1472
02:26:23,658 --> 02:26:25,135
Congratulations.

1473
02:26:25,191 --> 02:26:26,225
It's a boy.

1474
02:26:26,291 --> 02:26:27,530
You can go In now.

1475
02:27:14,724 --> 02:27:16,464
I wish papa were here.

1476
02:27:19,591 --> 02:27:21,091
