1
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:45,198
<i>Let's break it down.</i>

2
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:49,660
Hydrogen. What does that give us?

3
00:00:49,827 --> 00:00:52,663
By mole, we're looking at 63 percent.

4
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,957
Sixty-three?

5
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:56,584
That is a big bite.

6
00:00:56,751 --> 00:00:59,921
<i>- My next step's gotta be oxygen.
- Oxygen, 26 percent.</i>

7
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:02,298
Twenty-six.
There you have your water.

8
00:01:02,465 --> 00:01:05,885
- Carbon, 9 percent.
- Carbon, 9.

9
00:01:06,052 --> 00:01:09,013
- For a total of 98 percent.
- Right.

10
00:01:09,222 --> 00:01:13,476
<i>- Nitrogen, 1.25 percent.
- One-point-two-five.</i>

11
00:01:13,643 --> 00:01:15,978
<i>That brings you to 99 and a quarter.</i>

12
00:01:16,145 --> 00:01:19,148
Which only leaves you
with the trace elements

13
00:01:19,315 --> 00:01:21,901
down where the magic happens.

14
00:01:22,068 --> 00:01:25,863
Oh, wait a minute. What about calcium?
Calcium's not a trace.

15
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:27,865
<i>Got a whole skeleton to account for.</i>

16
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:29,742
<i>- You would think, right?
- Right.</i>

17
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,496
<i>Calcium.
Calcium's only 0.25 percent.</i>

18
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:38,417
What? That low? Seriously?

19
00:01:38,584 --> 00:01:40,384
Damn, I never would've thought that.

20
00:01:40,503 --> 00:01:45,341
- Okay, so where does iron fit in?
- Iron.

21
00:01:45,508 --> 00:01:52,390
Wow, okay, 0.00004 percent.

22
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:56,477
What? You can't have
hemoglobin without iron.

23
00:01:56,644 --> 00:01:59,522
- Apparently, it don't take much.
- No doubt. Go figure.

24
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:03,568
<i>- Sodium.
- Sodium, 0.04.</i>

25
00:02:05,528 --> 00:02:10,491
- Phosphorus, 0.19.
- Point-one-nine.

26
00:02:11,158 --> 00:02:12,618
There we go.

27
00:02:13,077 --> 00:02:16,622
So the whole thing

28
00:02:16,789 --> 00:02:23,296
adds up to 99.888042 percent.

29
00:02:25,923 --> 00:02:31,304
We are 0.111958 percent

30
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:33,639
shy.

31
00:02:33,806 --> 00:02:37,476
- Supposedly, that's everything.
- Yeah?

32
00:02:39,228 --> 00:02:40,646
I don't know, it just...

33
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:42,064
It just...

34
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:44,481
It seems like something's missing,
doesn't it?

35
00:02:46,902 --> 00:02:50,656
<i>There's got to be more
to a human being than that.</i>

36
00:03:21,354 --> 00:03:23,022
I hate these shoes.

37
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:25,941
Shoes make me look like
I should be changing bedpans

38
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:28,099
like I should be squeaking around

39
00:03:28,194 --> 00:03:30,780
bringing soup to some
disgusting old person

40
00:03:30,946 --> 00:03:32,948
{\an8}then take the bus home to my 16 cats.

41
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:35,368
{\an8}Then why are you wearing them?

42
00:03:36,452 --> 00:03:39,872
I like the support. My arches
happen to be extremely archy.

43
00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:48,714
Yo, what's up? Hey, can you call me,
like, in two minutes? Thanks, bye.

44
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:52,760
{\an8}I gotta go take this.

45
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,471
{\an8}Female?

46
00:03:56,806 --> 00:03:58,724
{\an8}Louis.

47
00:03:58,891 --> 00:04:02,395
{\an8}Not like it's any
of your business, though.

48
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:04,563
- Just be quick about it.
- No.

49
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:09,151
{\an8}Oh, and please don't say, "Yo."

50
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:12,113
{\an8}You can't know how much I hate that.

51
00:04:17,243 --> 00:04:20,913
{\an8}You missed a spot, right there.

52
00:04:21,414 --> 00:04:22,864
{\an8}Should you be on that ladder?

53
00:04:22,957 --> 00:04:25,542
{\an8}You're more than welcome
to take over for me up here.

54
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:27,920
I don't see why you don't get
Walt to do it.

55
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:31,298
Yeah, there's an idea.

56
00:04:33,342 --> 00:04:36,303
{\an8}So I'm working on this new short story,

57
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,100
{\an8}and there's this stoner character in it
and I'm trying to...

58
00:04:42,351 --> 00:04:44,520
{\an8}Well, you know, actually, let me back up.

59
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:50,276
{\an8}You smoked your fair share of pot
in college, didn't you?

60
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:55,030
I mean, you at least tried it.

61
00:04:57,032 --> 00:04:58,951
Come on.

62
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,957
{\an8}I perhaps tried it. Why?

63
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:07,524
{\an8}Do you remember it
having an effect on your mood?

64
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:09,795
Like, changing it in any major way?

65
00:05:10,337 --> 00:05:12,631
It made me more serious.

66
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:14,467
{\an8}Really?

67
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:19,972
{\an8}Because I mostly remember it made me
light-headed, that's about it.

68
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:24,977
{\an8}I was just wondering if it maybe could...

69
00:05:27,813 --> 00:05:32,318
{\an8}You know, it's just a character thing
I'm stuck on. Never mind.

70
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:35,571
{\an8}- Walter Jr.'s on pot?
- What? No.

71
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,490
No. No.

72
00:05:37,656 --> 00:05:40,283
- What would make you even...?
- Where's he getting it?

73
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:43,871
- Marie.
- Seriously. Is it this Louis person?

74
00:05:44,287 --> 00:05:48,417
- What are you gonna do about this?
- Marie, you need to look me in the eye.

75
00:05:48,584 --> 00:05:52,505
I am strictly asking about a story
that I'm writing, that's all.

76
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:57,259
{\an8}Right hand to God,
Walter Jr. is not on pot

77
00:05:57,426 --> 00:06:00,346
{\an8}certainly not as far as I know.

78
00:06:01,013 --> 00:06:03,015
{\an8}Not as far as you know?

79
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:05,059
Marie.

80
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,126
Hey, look at me.

81
00:07:55,711 --> 00:07:57,922
Hey, turn around and look at me.

82
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:06,305
This... This here.

83
00:08:06,931 --> 00:08:09,475
I wouldn't do this to my worst enemy.

84
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,479
This is degrading.

85
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,860
I'm sorry.

86
00:08:20,736 --> 00:08:23,948
You hope I'll make it easy
and just drop dead, don't you?

87
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:27,201
But I won't.

88
00:08:27,368 --> 00:08:29,828
So either kill me, or let me go.

89
00:08:31,163 --> 00:08:33,666
You don't have it in you, Walter.

90
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,463
How do you know my name?

91
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:45,010
Jesse. He told Emilio and me.

92
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:48,347
I came by to sell you meth.

93
00:08:49,682 --> 00:08:53,018
So, what, did you threaten him, huh?
Did you beat it out of him?

94
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:55,187
Not even close.

95
00:08:58,857 --> 00:09:00,985
What else did he tell you?

96
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:05,072
Pretty much everything he could think of.

97
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:07,533
You were his high school teacher.

98
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,800
One time you taught about carbon dioxide

99
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,538
by making grape soda in class.

100
00:09:13,205 --> 00:09:17,001
You have a son who's retarded,
or in a wheelchair or something.

101
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,423
It shouldn't come across
as some news flash.

102
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:24,800
That partner of yours

103
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:26,209
he's got a big mouth.

104
00:09:28,012 --> 00:09:29,722
Walter

105
00:09:29,888 --> 00:09:32,391
I don't know what you think
you're doing here,

106
00:09:32,558 --> 00:09:34,226
but trust me

107
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:37,563
this line of work doesn't suit you.

108
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,901
So I should just let you go, then.

109
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:47,614
Just unlock you and... adios, huh?

110
00:09:48,073 --> 00:09:50,576
I don't see what real choice you have.

111
00:09:50,743 --> 00:09:53,620
It's between that
and cold-blooded murder.

112
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:55,914
Besides

113
00:09:57,082 --> 00:09:59,084
your real problem's sitting upstairs.

114
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:20,105
Occupied.

115
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:23,317
Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one off
in here.

116
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:25,611
Just give me some privacy, would you?

117
00:10:28,864 --> 00:10:31,492
- Okay.
- What the hell, man?

118
00:10:32,576 --> 00:10:34,369
What are you doing, man?

119
00:10:34,578 --> 00:10:36,878
- You asshole. What...?
- You told him my name.

120
00:10:36,997 --> 00:10:39,124
- Says who, him?
- My name, where I work.

121
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,791
- You told him about my son.
- Hey, don't touch me.

122
00:10:41,877 --> 00:10:44,505
- You damn junkie.
- No, give me that. That's mine.

123
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:46,840
This is going down the toilet.
Watch it go.

124
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:48,633
No, that's worth 40 grand, you...

125
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:51,470
It's worth nothing when you smoke it all.

126
00:10:51,637 --> 00:10:53,639
Get off the toilet.

127
00:10:53,806 --> 00:10:55,641
- Get off the toilet!
- No.

128
00:10:57,684 --> 00:11:00,813
Get off the toilet.

129
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:03,232
Stop it.

130
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,986
No. No way.

131
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:43,772
No.

132
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:45,941
No, no, no.

133
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,694
Jesse, where the hell do you think
you're going?

134
00:11:48,861 --> 00:11:50,237
Back off, man, Jesus.

135
00:11:50,404 --> 00:11:51,988
- We've got work to do.
- No, no.

136
00:11:52,072 --> 00:11:54,616
You got work to do. I did my part.

137
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:57,286
You mean that obscenity
I spent hours cleaning up?

138
00:11:57,452 --> 00:12:00,372
- That is your contribution?
- Kiss my pink ass, man.

139
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:03,958
I didn't ask for any of this. How am I
supposed to live here now, huh?

140
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:06,742
My whole house smells like
toe cheese and dry cleaning.

141
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,965
Because you didn't follow
my instructions.

142
00:12:10,174 --> 00:12:11,884
Oh, well, <i>Heil</i> Hitler, bitch.

143
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,386
And let me tell you something else.

144
00:12:14,553 --> 00:12:17,389
We flipped a coin, okay?

145
00:12:17,556 --> 00:12:20,100
You and me. You and me.

146
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:22,603
Coin flip is sacred.

147
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:35,407
Your job is waiting for you
in that basement

148
00:12:35,574 --> 00:12:37,826
as per the coin.

149
00:12:37,993 --> 00:12:39,578
Fucking do it, already.

150
00:12:53,258 --> 00:12:56,261
That's what she said. Yeah.

151
00:12:57,262 --> 00:12:59,640
Yeah. Yeah, I think
we have some of those.

152
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:02,433
- Yeah, you'll have to try them on.
- Hello?

153
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:05,061
- Seven and a half, maybe. I don't know.
- Excuse me.

154
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:06,605
Do you have these in black?

155
00:13:09,024 --> 00:13:10,776
Anyways, so like I was saying

156
00:13:10,943 --> 00:13:14,321
I went to the party the other night.
Yeah, Tony was there.

157
00:13:18,116 --> 00:13:19,451
Whatever.

158
00:13:19,618 --> 00:13:22,287
Hey, where have you been?
I called you two hours ago.

159
00:13:22,454 --> 00:13:24,957
<i>Sorry, baby, I'm kind of busy here.
What's up?</i>

160
00:13:25,123 --> 00:13:29,419
Well, kind of a lot, actually,
and it's a delicate subject.

161
00:13:29,586 --> 00:13:34,424
- So I need you to focus, and...
<i>- Hey, sit down! Sit down!</i>

162
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,759
Damn it, Hank.

163
00:13:36,927 --> 00:13:39,762
I'm sorry, babe, I'm just in the middle
of something here.

164
00:13:39,846 --> 00:13:41,764
Get down. Get down.

165
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:45,644
Sit down! Sit your ass down,
<i>comprende? </i>You too, sit down!

166
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:50,065
Shit.

167
00:13:50,941 --> 00:13:53,110
I'm back, babe. What's up?

168
00:13:53,277 --> 00:13:56,655
- Walter Jr.
<i>- Yeah, what about him?</i>

169
00:13:57,155 --> 00:14:00,450
- Marijuana. He's smoking it.
<i>- Bullshit.</i>

170
00:14:00,617 --> 00:14:02,828
<i>Excuse me, his own mother
seems to think so.</i>

171
00:14:02,995 --> 00:14:05,038
- Skyler told you that?
<i>- She inferred it.</i>

172
00:14:05,122 --> 00:14:06,456
She inferred it, huh?

173
00:14:07,457 --> 00:14:09,459
She strongly inferred it.

174
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:15,215
Like, "Doctor, my friend suffers
from erectile dysfunction."

175
00:14:15,382 --> 00:14:16,967
<i>- Please, come on.</i>
- All right.

176
00:14:17,134 --> 00:14:19,303
- Talk to him.
<i>- Walt should talk to him.</i>

177
00:14:19,469 --> 00:14:21,471
Skyler, better yet.
She'll kick his butt.

178
00:14:21,638 --> 00:14:23,807
<i>I think it ought to be you.</i>

179
00:14:23,974 --> 00:14:25,976
You know, tell him some horror stories.

180
00:14:26,143 --> 00:14:28,895
Maybe show him some autopsy pictures.

181
00:14:29,104 --> 00:14:30,981
An autopsy of a pot overdose?
Come on.

182
00:14:31,231 --> 00:14:33,531
I don't know, baby,
it's just that, you know

183
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,900
I figure his dad should be the one
doing this, don't you think?

184
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:39,323
Hank, he respects you.

185
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:46,580
Yeah, all right. Well, listen, I mean,
I'll swing by their place after work.

186
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:49,499
- Good. Scare him straight.
<i>- Yeah, yeah.</i>

187
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,335
Hey, where's my sugar?

188
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:57,758
Excuse me, ma'am.

189
00:14:58,175 --> 00:15:01,225
Ma'am, you need to be wearing footies
before you try those on.

190
00:15:01,678 --> 00:15:03,347
I'm extremely clean.

191
00:15:03,513 --> 00:15:06,516
Yeah, well, I'd really appreciate it.

192
00:15:08,018 --> 00:15:11,521
Hey, sorry about that.
Yeah, I'll check.

193
00:15:12,397 --> 00:15:14,947
You know, I hid a pair for you
last week, gray ones.

194
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,903
My manager found them
and we put them back on the floor.

195
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,780
I know.

196
00:16:05,909 --> 00:16:09,079
- What do you think?
- About what?

197
00:16:10,247 --> 00:16:11,647
This look like a nice place?

198
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:14,584
No, not really.

199
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:16,795
Think you'd like to live here?

200
00:16:17,254 --> 00:16:18,797
No.

201
00:16:18,964 --> 00:16:21,925
- Sure about that?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

202
00:16:22,092 --> 00:16:25,178
I thought we were going to
Cold Stone Creamery.

203
00:16:25,345 --> 00:16:27,931
Yeah, yeah, well,
we took a little detour.

204
00:16:28,098 --> 00:16:31,184
Figure we'll come over
and check out how the other half lives.

205
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:33,937
This here is what we call
the Crystal Palace.

206
00:16:34,104 --> 00:16:36,857
You know who lives in the palace?
Meth-heads.

207
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:39,860
Nasty, skeevy meth-heads

208
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:44,030
who'd sell their grandma's coochie
for a hit.

209
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:46,783
Oh, you think that's funny?
That's funny, huh? Yeah.

210
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:49,217
Let me tell you something.
Every one of these

211
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:53,707
miserable wastes of skin got started how?

212
00:16:53,874 --> 00:16:56,209
- How do you think they started?
- I don't know.

213
00:16:56,293 --> 00:16:59,143
What do you think they were doing
before they graduated

214
00:16:59,296 --> 00:17:02,007
to shooting meth in their dicks?

215
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:05,469
A gateway drug.

216
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:07,387
That's what we call it.

217
00:17:07,554 --> 00:17:09,973
Dollars to doughnuts, and I shit you not

218
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,019
that gateway drug was marijuana,
every time.

219
00:17:14,186 --> 00:17:16,229
- You understand?
- Yeah.

220
00:17:16,396 --> 00:17:19,483
So why are you telling me this?

221
00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:22,319
Because I love you, you little bastard.

222
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:25,655
And, hey, I was young once, you know.

223
00:17:26,531 --> 00:17:29,409
The world's a messed up place, you know.

224
00:17:29,576 --> 00:17:32,996
You know, just this one time, you know...

225
00:17:33,163 --> 00:17:36,166
Hey! Hey! Hey, you!

226
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:40,295
Yeah, you, princess. Get over here.

227
00:17:42,714 --> 00:17:45,509
Hey, don't make me get out of the car.

228
00:17:49,846 --> 00:17:51,181
Check this out.

229
00:17:51,348 --> 00:17:53,433
What I'm talking about.

230
00:17:54,518 --> 00:17:57,019
- I ain't holding, okay?
- Did I say open your mouth?

231
00:17:57,103 --> 00:17:59,022
And hands off the car.

232
00:17:59,731 --> 00:18:03,109
Other side. Go around the other side,
talk to my friend here.

233
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:08,198
What's your name, sweetheart?

234
00:18:09,407 --> 00:18:11,201
- Wendy.
- Wendy, huh?

235
00:18:11,368 --> 00:18:13,537
How much you charge for a windy, Wendy?

236
00:18:13,954 --> 00:18:16,998
- I ain't doing him, he's a kid.
- Jesus, was that my question?

237
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:19,876
Don't think so hard,
it's gonna hurt your brain.

238
00:18:20,043 --> 00:18:22,963
- Are you on the pipe or on the needle?
- Nothing. Neither.

239
00:18:23,129 --> 00:18:25,382
Yeah, yeah.
Show us your teeth, huh?

240
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:28,426
Come on, Wendy,
let's see those pearly whites.

241
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,099
Oh, God. See that? Pipe, definitely.

242
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:35,934
Big-time, big-time on the pipe.

243
00:18:36,101 --> 00:18:38,228
You got something you wanna ask Wendy?

244
00:18:38,395 --> 00:18:40,063
No, not really.

245
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,399
You ever smoke anything else, Wendy?

246
00:18:42,857 --> 00:18:45,110
Sausages don't count.

247
00:18:46,486 --> 00:18:49,739
Seriously, tell my friend here
how you got started.

248
00:18:49,906 --> 00:18:53,743
Probably used to be, what? Like a
Girl Scout, or sang in the church choir.

249
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,956
- What are you, like, handicapped?
- He broke his leg playing football.

250
00:18:58,123 --> 00:19:01,876
He's a QB. Got an arm like a howitzer.

251
00:19:03,253 --> 00:19:06,089
So tell me, Wendy, you smoke pot?

252
00:19:06,256 --> 00:19:07,424
Why, you got some?

253
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:10,260
All right, hoof it, get lost.
Get out of here.

254
00:19:10,427 --> 00:19:13,680
Hey, fair warning, next time
I'm gonna bust you.

255
00:19:21,146 --> 00:19:22,480
So, what do you think?

256
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:25,775
Cool.

257
00:19:35,118 --> 00:19:38,705
Shut the door. Shut the door.
Lock it. Lock it, lock it.

258
00:19:39,664 --> 00:19:40,790
Who the hell was that?

259
00:19:40,957 --> 00:19:43,710
Cop and some football player
messing with me.

260
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:46,171
They ask about me, huh?

261
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:48,923
No, I think they just wanted pot.

262
00:20:02,854 --> 00:20:04,481
Right there.

263
00:20:05,857 --> 00:20:08,193
Shit, I left my root beer.

264
00:20:57,367 --> 00:21:00,453
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, sweetie, it's me.

265
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,455
Listen, I'm so sorry.

266
00:21:02,622 --> 00:21:07,877
Time, it just completely got away
from me. I'm just...

267
00:21:09,045 --> 00:21:12,882
My fault, my fault.
Bogdan just kept me here late

268
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:15,635
you know, doing some inventory,

269
00:21:15,802 --> 00:21:18,430
and I should've just...

270
00:21:18,596 --> 00:21:23,768
You know, you're right.
I gotta learn to say, you know, "No."

271
00:21:23,935 --> 00:21:26,020
But...

272
00:21:27,313 --> 00:21:29,774
Sky? You there?

273
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:33,278
<i>You're at the car wash?</i>

274
00:21:34,237 --> 00:21:35,905
Yeah.

275
00:21:36,614 --> 00:21:41,661
I seriously doubt that,
since you quit two weeks ago.

276
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:51,171
I called Bogdan, looking for you.

277
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:53,798
Quite an earful he gave me.

278
00:21:55,925 --> 00:21:57,677
Listen...

279
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:01,604
Listen, I'll come home
and we'll talk about it.

280
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:05,602
- I don't think so, Walt.
<i>- Honey...</i>

281
00:22:05,769 --> 00:22:07,771
Wherever you are

282
00:22:08,813 --> 00:22:10,857
why don't you just stay there tonight?

283
00:22:11,065 --> 00:22:14,194
<i>Skyler? Skyler?</i>

284
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:17,781
Skyler?

285
00:22:19,491 --> 00:22:21,576
Walter?

286
00:22:21,868 --> 00:22:23,369
Hello?

287
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:26,372
Hey, I'm kind of hungry down here.

288
00:24:04,762 --> 00:24:06,388
Come on.

289
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:29,829
Damn.

290
00:24:30,288 --> 00:24:32,665
I didn't think you were coming back.

291
00:24:47,013 --> 00:24:48,598
How long was I out?

292
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:51,517
Ten, 15 minutes?

293
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,190
I've never seen someone knock
themselves out just by coughing.

294
00:24:57,357 --> 00:24:59,507
You breathe in the same shit
you used on me?

295
00:25:08,368 --> 00:25:09,827
I've got lung cancer.

296
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,063
I'll make you another sandwich.

297
00:26:13,933 --> 00:26:15,768
It's safe.

298
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:18,771
There's no poison.

299
00:26:21,941 --> 00:26:24,110
Because that would be the way to do it

300
00:26:24,777 --> 00:26:26,821
if you're gonna do it.

301
00:26:28,114 --> 00:26:30,324
I suppose it would.

302
00:26:30,532 --> 00:26:31,951
I mean

303
00:26:32,118 --> 00:26:34,704
you being a chemist and all.

304
00:26:51,846 --> 00:26:55,808
So that name

305
00:26:56,184 --> 00:26:58,436
Krazy-8.

306
00:26:58,644 --> 00:27:00,813
Do I really have to call you that?

307
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,649
I mean, no offense, but

308
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,152
don't you have a real name?

309
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,155
Domingo.

310
00:27:10,156 --> 00:27:11,866
Domingo.

311
00:27:12,033 --> 00:27:14,827
That's "Sunday," right?

312
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:21,167
I'd rather call you that,
if you don't mind.

313
00:27:22,168 --> 00:27:23,669
Whatever.

314
00:27:23,836 --> 00:27:26,506
I can't say I ever liked it much.

315
00:27:29,591 --> 00:27:32,720
So, Domingo

316
00:27:32,887 --> 00:27:36,766
you from around town here
or someplace else?

317
00:27:37,058 --> 00:27:39,185
Hey, Walter?
You getting to know me

318
00:27:39,352 --> 00:27:42,396
is not gonna make it easier
for you to kill me.

319
00:27:42,897 --> 00:27:44,690
Not that I mind, you understand?

320
00:27:47,235 --> 00:27:50,780
You know, you keep telling me
that I don't have it in me.

321
00:27:50,988 --> 00:27:52,698
Well, maybe.

322
00:27:53,116 --> 00:27:55,034
But maybe not.

323
00:27:58,204 --> 00:28:00,915
I sure as hell am looking for
any reason not to.

324
00:28:01,082 --> 00:28:04,544
I mean, any good reason at all.

325
00:28:10,716 --> 00:28:12,802
Sell me.

326
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,054
Tell me what it is.

327
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,140
I'd start off by promising
that if you let me go

328
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:24,646
I won't come after you,
that you'd be safe.

329
00:28:24,814 --> 00:28:26,914
I guess I'd say what happened between us

330
00:28:27,942 --> 00:28:29,235
never happened.

331
00:28:29,402 --> 00:28:33,072
And what's best for both parties
is we forget all about it.

332
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:37,451
But you know anybody in my situation
would make promises like that.

333
00:28:37,618 --> 00:28:40,079
And, in my case, they happen to be true.

334
00:28:40,246 --> 00:28:41,747
You'll never know for sure.

335
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:47,920
So, what else can I tell you?

336
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:55,678
I don't know.

337
00:28:57,054 --> 00:28:59,599
But you've gotta convince me.

338
00:29:00,433 --> 00:29:04,437
And you're going nowhere until you do.

339
00:29:05,605 --> 00:29:07,940
Hey, yeah. Yeah.

340
00:29:08,191 --> 00:29:10,443
I'm from here in town, man.

341
00:29:11,152 --> 00:29:13,779
ABQ, born and bred.

342
00:29:13,946 --> 00:29:15,865
Never left.

343
00:29:16,449 --> 00:29:19,785
Studied Business Administration
over at UNM

344
00:29:19,952 --> 00:29:21,162
got my degree.

345
00:29:22,371 --> 00:29:24,123
Really?

346
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:30,296
Does that come in handy
in the drug trade?

347
00:29:30,463 --> 00:29:32,298
Doesn't hurt.

348
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,843
I was gonna study music originally.

349
00:29:36,302 --> 00:29:39,055
Maybe even try out
for Oberlin and Berklee.

350
00:29:39,222 --> 00:29:42,516
My pops talked me out of it.

351
00:29:42,683 --> 00:29:46,646
Said there was no money in it unless
I wind up some bullshit rock star,

352
00:29:46,812 --> 00:29:49,815
and I hadn't a snowball chance
at that one.

353
00:29:50,816 --> 00:29:52,985
What does your dad do?

354
00:29:53,986 --> 00:29:57,323
He owns Tampico Furniture over on Menaul.

355
00:29:58,366 --> 00:30:00,993
Wait a minute, I know that place.

356
00:30:03,496 --> 00:30:05,414
Wait a minute. That's...

357
00:30:05,623 --> 00:30:08,000
That's that...

358
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:10,586
They used to have those late-night...

359
00:30:10,753 --> 00:30:13,103
- The stupid commercials.
- That they had, yeah.

360
00:30:13,214 --> 00:30:16,384
Yeah, that's him.
Been doing them for over 30 years.

361
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:20,263
Wait a minute.
How did it go? It was...

362
00:30:20,554 --> 00:30:23,349
Wait, wait, wait. It was...

363
00:30:24,517 --> 00:30:29,063
<i>Don't let shopping Strain your brain-o</i>

364
00:30:29,355 --> 00:30:33,025
<i>Just sing this short refrain-o</i>

365
00:30:33,192 --> 00:30:36,362
<i>-Our furniture is </i>bueno
<i>-Our furniture is</i> bueno

366
00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:40,199
<i>-Tampico is the name-o
-Tampico is the name-o</i>

367
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,754
Pretty moronic. But what can you do?

368
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:57,717
Well, it did tend to stick in your head.

369
00:30:57,883 --> 00:31:01,637
Did you write that?
Being the musician in the family.

370
00:31:01,804 --> 00:31:05,808
Hell, no, man.
It was my crazy uncle Alex.

371
00:31:05,975 --> 00:31:08,325
He sings it at bars,
trying to pick up on women.

372
00:31:09,812 --> 00:31:13,816
His mind, it's like saying,
"Hey, I wrote 'Stairway to Heaven.'"

373
00:31:15,985 --> 00:31:19,071
Yeah, but at Tampico Furniture, I...

374
00:31:19,572 --> 00:31:24,410
I think when my son was born
that we bought his bassinet there.

375
00:31:24,577 --> 00:31:27,788
We don't sell bassinets there.
It's more of a specialty item.

376
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:29,248
We did use to sell cribs.

377
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:34,003
A crib, then, okay. A crib.

378
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:36,339
Yeah. No, I remember that.

379
00:31:36,505 --> 00:31:42,595
In fact, I remember recognizing
your dad from those commercials.

380
00:31:42,762 --> 00:31:46,265
Although, he wasn't anywhere near
as friendly in real life.

381
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,351
Yeah. No shit.

382
00:31:48,517 --> 00:31:51,103
Did he try selling you
that extended warranty?

383
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,522
Yeah, he probably did.

384
00:31:53,731 --> 00:31:56,108
And I was probably dumb enough to buy it.

385
00:31:56,275 --> 00:31:58,277
Yeah, that was his big thing.

386
00:31:58,444 --> 00:32:00,194
You ask him for a glass of water

387
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:03,282
he'd tell you you need
an extended warranty on the ice.

388
00:32:07,244 --> 00:32:09,663
- Did you work there too?
- Only my whole life.

389
00:32:10,164 --> 00:32:12,792
Up until the day I said,
"Fuck you," and quit.

390
00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:18,881
So

391
00:32:20,633 --> 00:32:23,469
16 years ago,
how old would you have been?

392
00:32:24,804 --> 00:32:27,807
If it was after school,
trust me, I was there.

393
00:32:27,973 --> 00:32:30,017
Might have even helped ring you up.

394
00:32:30,184 --> 00:32:33,979
You and your extended warranty
on the crib.

395
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,657
Small world.

396
00:32:45,908 --> 00:32:47,868
It is.

397
00:32:49,203 --> 00:32:51,831
The paths we take, huh?

398
00:33:17,356 --> 00:33:19,859
Jesse know you've got cancer?

399
00:33:22,736 --> 00:33:24,864
No one but you.

400
00:33:26,323 --> 00:33:29,076
- Not your family?
- No.

401
00:33:30,911 --> 00:33:32,538
Why not?

402
00:33:36,208 --> 00:33:41,130
Not a conversation
that I'm even remotely ready to have.

403
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,468
That's why you're cooking meth?

404
00:33:46,343 --> 00:33:48,762
You wanna leave money for your family.

405
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,558
Hell.

406
00:33:52,725 --> 00:33:55,561
I'll write you a check right now
if you let me go.

407
00:34:01,108 --> 00:34:03,402
Like I said, Walter

408
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:06,989
if this line of work doesn't suit you...

409
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,996
get out before it's too late.

410
00:34:20,252 --> 00:34:22,796
I don't know what to do.

411
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:32,389
Yeah.

412
00:34:32,973 --> 00:34:34,183
You do.

413
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:55,538
I'll get the key.

414
00:36:37,222 --> 00:36:39,224
No.

415
00:36:39,642 --> 00:36:41,310
No.

416
00:36:41,644 --> 00:36:44,229
Oh, no, no, no.

417
00:36:54,907 --> 00:36:58,285
No. No. No, don't do this.

418
00:36:58,452 --> 00:37:01,747
Don't do this.
Why are you doing this?

419
00:37:02,414 --> 00:37:05,084
Why are you doing this?

420
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,452
You're doing the right thing, Walter.

421
00:37:41,787 --> 00:37:43,288
Yeah?

422
00:37:47,459 --> 00:37:49,378
Do you wanna...?

423
00:38:04,184 --> 00:38:08,021
So you're not angry?

424
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,023
What do you mean?

425
00:38:10,607 --> 00:38:12,526
Angry at you?

426
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,653
No.

427
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,156
Live and let live, man.

428
00:38:19,324 --> 00:38:21,493
That's very understanding.

429
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,537
Whatever, man.

430
00:38:23,704 --> 00:38:25,873
I just wanna go home.

431
00:38:29,501 --> 00:38:30,919
Yeah.

432
00:38:31,754 --> 00:38:33,547
Me too.

433
00:38:41,346 --> 00:38:43,432
Unlock me, Walter.

434
00:38:59,031 --> 00:39:01,366
The moment I do

435
00:39:02,868 --> 00:39:05,871
are you gonna stick me
with that broken piece of plate?

436
00:39:34,733 --> 00:39:36,485
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

437
00:39:36,693 --> 00:39:38,593
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

438
00:39:39,196 --> 00:39:40,739
I'm so sorry.

439
00:39:40,948 --> 00:39:42,574
I'm sorry.

440
00:39:49,456 --> 00:39:51,500
I'm sorry.

441
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,002
I'm so sorry.

442
00:41:21,715 --> 00:41:23,550
Hello?

443
00:41:24,468 --> 00:41:26,887
Anybody down here?

444
00:42:34,246 --> 00:42:36,331
Everybody

445
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,960
I need you all to take your seats.

446
00:42:40,127 --> 00:42:42,963
Settle down, please. Thank you.

447
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,882
I understand
that Mr. White is feeling

448
00:42:46,049 --> 00:42:48,677
a little under the weather this morning.

449
00:42:48,844 --> 00:42:53,849
So you folks are going to have
to be making do with me today.

450
00:42:54,016 --> 00:42:58,311
And we are going to be watching
a very interesting video

451
00:42:58,478 --> 00:43:01,982
on carbon.

452
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,483
Very important stuff.

453
00:43:06,903 --> 00:43:10,532
- So, what do you think?
- It's a cook site. Gotta be.

454
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:13,994
Nobody came way the hell out here
just to buy.

455
00:43:14,161 --> 00:43:16,997
Fire there could have started
by accident.

456
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:19,666
I don't think that was meant
to destroy evidence.

457
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:23,712
Got a couple of Dooley tracks
headed away, towards the road.

458
00:43:23,879 --> 00:43:27,174
So, what, they're in
some sort of camper-slash-lab?

459
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,427
They accidentally start a fire
and everybody FOs?

460
00:43:30,594 --> 00:43:32,345
Yeah. Why not?

461
00:43:32,512 --> 00:43:35,599
So why did that little hair-gelled shit
leave his car?

462
00:43:38,894 --> 00:43:43,857
- Gomey, it's a culture in decline.
- It's a rich and vibrant culture.

463
00:43:44,024 --> 00:43:46,359
It's a car that jumps up and down.

464
00:43:46,735 --> 00:43:48,028
What the hell?

465
00:43:48,195 --> 00:43:51,364
You people used to be conquistadors,
for chrissake.

466
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:55,619
Smells like a Drakkar Noir
factory in here.

467
00:43:56,036 --> 00:43:57,579
I already searched it.

468
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,915
Yeah.

469
00:44:00,832 --> 00:44:02,876
You're wasting your time.

470
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,760
Give it up. If this here's a trap car,
it's gonna take more

471
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,549
- than your dumb white ass to find it.
- Oh, yeah?

472
00:44:09,716 --> 00:44:13,720
You are talking to the trap-car master,
my friend.

473
00:44:13,887 --> 00:44:16,223
I'm Rain Man counting his toothpicks.

474
00:44:16,723 --> 00:44:19,351
Yeah, you're like Rain Man. Retarded.

475
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,401
Yeah, baby.

476
00:44:32,572 --> 00:44:35,117
- Hello, zippy.
- Asshole.

477
00:44:35,951 --> 00:44:39,871
Sort of looks like meth,
but it's too damn white.

478
00:44:42,374 --> 00:44:44,126
You know what I'm thinking, Gomey?

479
00:44:44,292 --> 00:44:47,087
Yep. Somebody croaked our snitch.

480
00:44:47,254 --> 00:44:48,755
Hey, agents.

481
00:44:48,922 --> 00:44:50,757
You got something?

482
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:28,003
<i>I don't know. It just...</i>

483
00:45:28,336 --> 00:45:30,797
It just... Doesn't it seem like

484
00:45:30,964 --> 00:45:33,633
something's missing?

485
00:45:33,842 --> 00:45:35,969
What about the soul?

486
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,858
The soul.

487
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:00,243
There's nothing but chemistry here.

488
00:47:05,267 --> 00:47:07,227
Skyler?

489
00:47:16,945 --> 00:47:19,614
There's something I have to tell you.
