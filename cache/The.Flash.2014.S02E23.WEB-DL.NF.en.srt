See, Barry, there could be two of you.

You just have to be willing

{\an8}He lost his wife, Nora, and he lost Barry.

{\an8}He suffered guilt,

{\an8}and everything that comes with
being blamed for a crime he didn't commit.

{\an8}Henry Allen was proof

{\an8}We need to come up with a plan.

{\an8}The man can crack open
breaches to Earth-2.

{\an8}<i>I mean, if he can do that,</i>

00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,372
{\an8}what else can he do
that we don't know about?

67
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,874
{\an8}Right after he killed his Time Remnant,

68
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,292
<i>he told me I was "almost ready."</i>

-"Almost ready" for what?
-I don't know.

Yep, classic psychopath.

71
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,049
Why can't they ever just say
what they want to do?

72
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,385
<i>We also have to figure out</i>

73
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,012
why I keep vibing
Earth-2 being ripped to shreds.

74
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:47,179
Seriously.

75
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,974
It's like I'm watching <i>Transformers,</i>
in 4D,

76
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,935
but, like, 10 times more realistic.

77
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,771
And with much better acting.

78
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:57,482
Look, if you can vibe the future,

79
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,901
{\an8}we need to stop Zoom before that happens.

80
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,861
{\an8}I'm gonna get some air, all right?

81
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,365
{\an8}I got it.

82
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:28,054
When I was in the Speed Force,

83
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:33,768
I felt like I'd finally come to grips
with her death.

84
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:38,022
With not saving her when I went back.

85
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,652
And then, the moment

86
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,864
where I'm finally at the place
I could move on,

87
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,076
my father's taken from me.

88
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:55,206
How am I ever supposed to
find peace with that?

89
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,500
I don't know, Barry.

90
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,251
But you're gonna have to
find a way to do that

91
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,420
or it's gonna tear you apart.

92
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,511
I just miss him so much already.

93
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,312

94
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,481
Barry, no!

-This ends now.
-Not yet.

100

There's always more to take, Barry.

101
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,205
You're gonna stay away from them.

102
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,708
-That's completely up to you.
-What?

103
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,959
When we first met,

104
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,629
I told you that
Zoom needed to be the best.

105
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,633
You just didn't realize
I was talking about myself.

106
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,635
Is that what this is about?

107
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,429
A race, Barry, between you and me,

108
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,932
to see who's the fastest.

109
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,560
You win, this is over,
and you get to be the hero.

110
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,145
I'm not racing you.

111
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,731
Then your father
won't be the only person you love

112
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,315
that I'll take from you.

113
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,610
Think about it, Flash,

114
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,780
all I want to know is
who's the fastest man alive,

115
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,865
<i>on either world.</i>

116
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:12,825
I'll be waiting.

117
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:20,457
IRIS: <i>So, Zoom wants to race you?</i>

118
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,502
He's obsessed with being the best.

119
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,795
Why would we trust him?

120
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,713
He just wants to race.

121
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,507
You know, it actually makes sense

122
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,009
in a completely off-your-rocker
sort of way.

123
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,511
That can't be everything he wants.

124
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,012
It isn't.

125
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,641
This Magnetar that's being developed
by Mercury Labs,

126
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,018
turns out it can act as a pulsar.

127
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:40,227
Whoa.

128
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,271
What is a pulsar?

129
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,190
HARRISON: <i>It's a power amplifier</i>

130
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:46,901
<i>with a highly magnetized,
dense rotating core</i>

131
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:49,278
<i>that could be easily weaponized.</i>

132
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,698
Nah, that's not dangerous at all.

133
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,867
That's what happens to Earth-2.

134
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,328
What happens in my vibes
is because of this machine.

135
00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:59,622
That thing is powerful enough
to destroy a planet?

136
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,542
Well, more than just a planet
if it has the right power source.

137
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,419
-JESSE: <i>Like what?</i>
-Like me.

138
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,046
<i>That's why he wants to race.</i>

139
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:10,424
He wants to siphon the energy
I create when I run.

140
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,426
He wants to siphon the energy
off both of you.

141
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,970
CAITLIN: <i>When Jay captured me,</i>

142
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,847
he said that
he used to measure his success

143
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,015
by counting the number of victims he had.

144
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,642
But now, he was gonna measure it

145
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,519
by counting the number of Earths
he conquered instead.

146
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,772
He doesn't want to just destroy Earth-2,

147
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,692
he wants to take out
every other planet in the multi-verse.

148
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,194
-How many are there?
-Infinite.

149
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,071
Well, can he do that?

150
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,741
If he can create a breach to Earth-2
all on his own...

151
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,158
He can get to all of 'em.

152
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,494
One pulse to destroy them all.

153
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,705
I guess I don't have a choice.

154
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:44,291
I have to race him.

155
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,294
I have to win.

156
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,886
Barr.

157
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,388
Don't race him.

158
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,767
-It's not that easy.
<i>-Yes, it is, you just say "no."</i>

159
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,770
We find another way to stop him, together,
like we always do.

160
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,688
And do what, Joe?

161
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,650
Just sit around,
and wait for him to kill somebody else?

Of course, I wanna kill him, Joe!

I wanna do a hell of a lot more
than just kill him,

I'm sorry, but I'm racing him,

that's gonna be the hard part.

Okay. Caitlin will distract Jay

00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,022
Ah!

323
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,777
Dad! (GASPS)

(GROANS)

326
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,795
Did you see my dad?

327
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:51,172
No, the vibe keeps changing.

328
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,924
It's like my brain is
channel surfing or something.

329
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,801
They must be on the move,
that's why the vibe's in flux.

330
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,844
Keep trying?

331
00:18:58,804 --> 00:18:59,971
Hey, did you turn off the Magnetar?

332
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,265
No, there's no messing with that thing.

333
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:04,268
Whatever he did to it,
we try and touch it, we try and move it,

334
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:05,894
this planet's done for.

335
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,314
WALLY: <i>Iris.</i>

336
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,234
What's wrong?

337
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,823
Zoom took Dad.

338
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,991
What? How?

339
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,035
We tried to stop Zoom
by pushing him through the breach,

340
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,371
but he took Joe with him.

341
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,998
Well, where's Barry? Did he go after him?

342
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,209
He's not with us.

343
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,043
-He's in a cell in the intake...
-(CLEARS THROAT)

344
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,256
Wait, you... You tried to stop Zoom alone?

345
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:36,842
Long story.

346
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:42,806
Well, we have to get him back.

347
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:45,851
Wally, before Zoom took Dad,

348
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:48,562
we all agreed
that if we got him off this Earth,

349
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,938
we would close the breaches for good

350
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:53,359
and we would never open them again,

351
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,903
under any circumstances.

352
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,866
Why would you do that?

353
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,870
No. No way, that's not gonna happen.

354
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:06,205
He made us all agree to it.

355
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,457
-Well, guess what? I didn't agree to that!
-Wally.

356
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:13,003
Iris, I already lost my mom.
If Dad... (VOICE BREAKING)

357
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:15,422
I...

358
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,894
(GROANING)

359
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:37,403
I will say, if anything, Barry sure has
an ample number of fathers to kill.

360
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:41,448
If you're gonna kill me, kill me.

361
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:45,536
It doesn't matter,
you're not racing anybody.

362
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,622
Come on, Joe, you know Barry
better than that, you raised him.

363
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,749
He'll say yes
if he thinks he can save you.

364
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,251
Not this time.

365
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,295
I made sure of it.

366
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,214
Who is that?

367
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,133
It would just confuse you.

368
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,802
Try me.

369
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,349
I got my speed the same way Barry did.

370
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,601
<i>When I got struck
by the dark matter and electricity,</i>

371
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,062
<i>I became Zoom, the fastest man alive.</i>

372
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,106
<i>It wasn't long
before I had this Earth on its knees.</i>

373
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,775
<i>But it wasn't enough.</i>

374
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,319
I wanted more.

375
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,946
I wanted to be faster.

376
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,657
<i>So I created a speed drug.</i>

377
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,075
Velocity Nine.

378
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:27,536
It made me faster
than I ever thought possible.

379
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,162
<i>Fast enough
to break the dimensional barrier,</i>

380
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,291
<i>fast enough to run to other universes,
other Earths.</i>

381
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:36,127
And then one day,
on one of those other Earths,

382
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,546
<i>I discovered him.</i>

383
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,298
He's another speedster?

384
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,342
Yeah, you could say that.

385
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,010
<i>That was right about the time
I discovered something else, too.</i>

386
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,680
<i>All that V-Nine
I'd been injecting into my system</i>

387
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,765
<i>had a little side effect.</i>

388
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,351
It was killing you.

389
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,438
I searched for a cure. I tried everything.

390
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,815
I even tried
to manipulate the Speed Force.

391
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,817
But let me tell you, the Speed Force...

392
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,027
The Speed Force does not like
its rules being broken.

393
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,990
<i>Now it's been sending
its enforcers after me ever since.</i>

394
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,327
So, you brought him here
to steal his speed.

395
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,330
I tried, but it wouldn't take.

396
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:14,541
<i>But then the skies parted and I saw Barry.</i>

397
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,668
<i>And then I stole his speed.</i>

398
00:22:17,043 --> 00:22:18,086
<i>-I won.</i>
-(SCREAMS)

399
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,339
I beat the rules of the Speed Force.

400
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,633
Then why keep him here?

401
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,260
A trophy.

402
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,972
And a little idea I had for fun.

403
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:33,685
You see,
I got so tired of being the villain.

404
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,021
<i>So, I decided to be the hero, too.</i>

405
00:22:37,063 --> 00:22:39,149
I even borrowed his name.

406
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,528
Jay Garrick.

407
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,031
(TAPPING)

408
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,158
You know what's gonna be great, Detective?

409
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,743
After I beat Barry in the race

410
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,328
<i>and prove that
I'm the fastest man alive on any Earth,</i>

411
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:56,207
he's gonna rot in a cage
just like the one Jay's in now.

412
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:01,505
And then I'll have a Flash from two worlds
to keep me company.

413
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,011
(DOOR BEEPING, OPENING)

414
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,520
Look, everyone's gonna freak
when they find out I did this,

415
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,396
but I don't care.

416
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,231
We need your help, Barry.

(ALARM BEEPING)

418
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:29,825
Uh... Hey, guys, Barry's not...

419
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,660
-In his cell anymore.
-Wally!

420
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,787
Well, I wasn't just gonna stand here
and let this happen.

421
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,665
You let him take Joe?
What the hell were you thinking?

422
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,542
Allen, Allen,
there was nothing we could do.

423
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:39,793
You could have let me race him!

424
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,920
Allen, you're not racing Zoom!

425
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,880
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna tranq me again?

426
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,466
Don't tempt me.

427
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,759
Look, I know you guys made a pact
to keep Zoom on Earth-2,

428
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,928
but you did that without me and Wally.

429
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,597
All right? You don't get to do that!

430
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,682
Barry, look at yourself right now.
You're not okay.

431
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,767
Cisco, my dad was just killed
in front of me!

432
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,143
Do you have any idea how that feels?

433
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,896
Watching someone you love die? Yes, I do.

434
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,232
-Cait...
-Look, Barry,

435
00:24:02,398 --> 00:24:06,945
I know how cold and angry
and distant that can make you.

436
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,448
But when this happened to me,
you were the one who kept me in check.

437
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,033
You told me to stop and take a breath.

438
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,369
<i>And that's all
we're telling you to do now.</i>

439
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,829
I'm telling you, I'm good.

440
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,581
HARRISON: <i>Really? You're good?</i>

441
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,583
Because it seems to me
you wanna do more than stop Zoom.

442
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,459
It seems to me you want revenge.

443
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:25,255
If that's why you're doing this, Allen,
you will lose.

444
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,635
Look, you guys, I...

445
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,302
You may not think I can do this.

446
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:35,390
You may think I'm too angry,
but we're running out of time.

447
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,769
I have to beat him, and I'm going to,

448
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,771
<i>whether I have your help or not.</i>

449
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,856
So, which one is it?

450
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:45,984
BARRY: <i>So, how does this work?</i>

451
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,403
It's the same way we took Iris
into the Speed Force.

452
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,490
Harry does his best Frankenstein,
you hold my hand, and I vibe you there.

453
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,450
All right, let's do it.

454
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,837
<i>I'll do it.</i>

455
00:25:06,212 --> 00:25:08,173
Say when and where, I'll be there.

456
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:10,967
Cisco's learned
how to bring people into his vibes.

457
00:25:11,342 --> 00:25:14,345
There's one condition. You bring Joe back.

458
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:18,183
But if he's harmed in any way, it's off.

459
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:19,350
I'll bring him.

460
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,394
<i>But I won't release him
until after we race.</i>

461
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:22,938
Deal?

462
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,356
Deal.

463
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:39,204
I tell you, Jay might be crazy pants,
but he can pick a venue.

464
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,293
Brought the whole crew with you, huh?

465
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,379
Can't say I blame you.

466
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:49,923
-Dad!
-IRIS: <i>Wally.</i>

467
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,675
JAY: <i>It's gonna be one hell of a show.</i>

468
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:52,968
Let him go.

469
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,386
After we race.

470
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:58,348
Cut the crap.
We know you plan to power up the Magnetar

471
00:25:58,514 --> 00:26:00,726
so you can destroy the multi-verse.

472
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,311
Bravo, you've figured it out.

473
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:04,855
<i>Almost.</i>

474
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,732
I don't want to destroy all of it.

475
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,317
This Earth is at the center
of the multi-verse.

476
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:12,654
It's the access point
to every other Earth in existence.

477

How generous of you.

Need to have some place to hang my cowl.

481
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:27,252
You might wanna say your goodbyes.

482
00:26:35,426 --> 00:26:37,888
Don't worry, I'm gonna save your dad.

483
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,182
No, you're gonna save our dad.

484
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,977
Get back to S.T.A.R. Labs, it's safer.

00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,372
kick his ass.

492
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,213
What are the rules?

493
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,132
One lap around the inside of this loop

494
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,426
will produce about one gigawatt of energy.

495
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:20,346
And I need 500-plus to
power the Magnetar enough to do the job.

<i>Once it's full, I win.</i>

497
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,935
Because there is no stopping it.

498
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,980
So, all I have to do to beat you
is stop you before that happens.

499
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,357
Yep, it's that simple.

500

you don't want to race anymore,

They're not my fan club,

00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,205
they're the reason that I'm running.

505

What's the Time Remnant doing?

522
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,436
He's creating his own pulse.

523
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,771
Why would he do that?

524
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:38,026
Because if that's out of phase,
it'll counteract that one.

525
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,153
Wait, his body can't handle that!

526
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:41,612
Then what's gonna happen?

527
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,490
He'll die.

Well, uh... Basically, yeah.

543
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,539
It's called a Time Remnant.

It's not something
that I can do every day,

545
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:22,172
but I needed a way to draw
the Time Wraiths out of the Speed Force,

Is that what I look like
when they start talking about science?

00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,055
Pretty much.

550

Don't worry, Wally,
it'll get easier to understand.

Well, how does that even work?

Hey, uh, don't be surprised
if I project myself over to Earth-2

throw your stuff across the office.

I'll miss you, too, Cisco.

So, I guess I can't text you
from another Earth, huh?

642
00:36:23,013 --> 00:36:24,182
Yeah, I guess not.

643
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:26,309
It's too bad.

644
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,191
Thank you, guys, seriously,

645
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,109
-for saving our home.
-Mmm-hmm.

646

Ready?

Yeah.

652
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,965
Can't stop thinking
about my dad's doppelgänger,

653
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,593
seeing him, knowing that he's out there,

654
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,345
that should've made it easier.

655

<i>Doesn't.</i>

656
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:48,474
Just made me miss him even more.

657
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,894
I can't even imagine
how hard that must've been.

658
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:56,274
We just won. We just beat Zoom.

659
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,610
Why does it feel like I just lost?

660
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:06,284
Because you've lost a lot in your life,
Barry, more than most.

661
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,079
But...

662
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:17,670
Maybe you and me,
seeing where this thing goes,

663
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:21,341
maybe that can give you something
for a change.

664
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,096
That's all I ever wanted to hear you say.

665
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:32,310
And I wish that I was in a place
where I could try that with you,

666
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,481
<i>but I feel so hollowed out inside
right now.</i>

I feel more broken
than I've ever felt in my life.

I need to fix what's wrong with me.

00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:51,036
I need to find some... Some peace.

671
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,167
Barry, listen to me,

672
00:38:58,168 --> 00:39:00,796
you waited for me for years.

673
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,298
You let me get to a place
where this was possible.

674
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:08,929
So, I am telling you,
I am gonna do the same thing for you.

And when you get back, I'll be here.

Okay.
