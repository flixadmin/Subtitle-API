1
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:03,041
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:03,043 --> 00:00:06,144
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,146 --> 00:00:09,247
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:09,249 --> 00:00:12,216
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:15,686
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:17,722
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

7
00:00:17,724 --> 00:00:21,092
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:21,094 --> 00:00:24,495
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,497 --> 00:00:27,331
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,933
<i>Previously on "The Flash"ù...</i>

11
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:30,535
Zoom wants me dead.

12
00:00:30,537 --> 00:00:32,336
The meta-humans that he's
sending from Earth-2,

13
00:00:32,338 --> 00:00:33,805
they don't care how many
innocent people get in the way.

14
00:00:33,807 --> 00:00:35,173
I have to go.

15
00:00:35,175 --> 00:00:37,542
I need you to tell me that it's okay.

16
00:00:37,544 --> 00:00:39,010
- Ah!
- Barry.

17
00:00:39,012 --> 00:00:44,048
Is this the face of your hero, Central City?

18
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,286
- Ah!
- Ah!

19
00:00:48,288 --> 00:00:49,987
Seriously got your ass kicked.

20
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:51,756
I can't feel my legs.

21
00:01:00,066 --> 00:01:01,065
All right, I got you.

22
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:03,367
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

23
00:01:09,843 --> 00:01:11,409
I can't do it right now, all right?

24
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:14,979
- Oh, yes you can, Barry.
- No, no, no.

25
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:16,614
We've been making so much progress.

26
00:01:16,616 --> 00:01:17,648
Yep, six whole steps.

27
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,150
Someone get me a Bozo button.

28
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:20,651
Hey, give yourself some credit.

29
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:22,220
You just broke your back.

30
00:01:22,222 --> 00:01:23,788
Yeah, a normal person
would've been paralyzed

31
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,189
the rest of his life.

32
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:27,425
How long until I'm fully healed?

33
00:01:27,427 --> 00:01:29,127
The initial MRI I took a week ago

34
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:32,897
showed a complete dislocation
at the T12-L1 interspace

35
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:34,999
of the thoracolumbar junction.

36
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:37,668
But this is the MRI I took this morning.

37
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,404
It's remarkable, but you're
almost completely healed.

38
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:42,039
I'm still having trouble breathing.

39
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:44,642
That's totally normal with a spinal injury.

40
00:01:44,644 --> 00:01:47,111
It should clear up soon.

41
00:01:48,715 --> 00:01:50,815
We're going to get you
back in that suit, Barry.

42
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:53,584
Real quick, trust me.

43
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:55,953
What are we gonna do about Zoom?

44
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:58,789
No sign of him since Cisco
nailed him with that tranq dart.

45
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,725
And I haven't vibed since then.

46
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:05,029
- Maybe Zoom's not coming back.
- I highly doubt that.

47
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:06,964
Which is why I'm gonna go do
something about it.

48
00:02:06,966 --> 00:02:09,033
What do you mean, go do something about it?

49
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:12,436
I need access to your breach
room and your speed cannon.

50
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:13,905
Why is that?

51
00:02:13,907 --> 00:02:17,341
Because, Barry, it's time to go home.

52
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:21,292

53
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:26,951
So, you show up on our Earth,
you screw everything up,

54
00:02:26,953 --> 00:02:28,519
and now you want to go home?

55
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:30,354
Sounds very familiar.

56
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:33,457
Again, that wasn't me.

57
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:36,727
I need to go take care of Zoom
once and for all

58
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:38,196
before anyone else gets killed.

59
00:02:38,198 --> 00:02:39,363
How do you plan on doing that?

60
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:40,932
I'll think of something.

61
00:02:40,934 --> 00:02:42,600
Ramon, if you'll escort me
to the speed cannon.

62
00:02:42,602 --> 00:02:44,035
No, no, you can't go through the breach.

63
00:02:44,037 --> 00:02:45,169
Yeah, he can.

64
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:46,237
Jay taught us how to send people.

65
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,638
That's not what I mean.

66
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,273
Look, if you can figure out how to stop Zoom

67
00:02:49,275 --> 00:02:51,809
on your Earth, you can
figure out how to do it here.

68
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:56,080
We need you to stay here until
we defeat Zoom, Dr. Wells.

69
00:02:56,082 --> 00:03:00,251
What I need, Dr. Snow, is to return home.

70
00:03:00,253 --> 00:03:04,422
And I'm going to that with
or without your assistance.

71
00:03:06,492 --> 00:03:10,161
What are you doing?
If Harry wants to go...bye.

72
00:03:10,163 --> 00:03:12,630
Look, like it or not, Cisco,
we need his help.

73
00:03:12,632 --> 00:03:15,666
I'm not sure another plan
from Wells is what we need.

74
00:03:15,668 --> 00:03:17,501
Yeah, I mean, the last bright idea he had

75
00:03:17,503 --> 00:03:18,603
nearly got Barry killed.

76
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:20,504
I know, but Jay's gone,

77
00:03:20,506 --> 00:03:22,773
and Dr. Wells knows Zoom better than anyone,

78
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:26,410
so until Barry is back on his feet again,

79
00:03:26,412 --> 00:03:29,347
we need to keep Wells around
in case Zoom returns.

80
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,150
Caitlin, if he doesn't want to be here,

81
00:03:32,152 --> 00:03:33,318
then we're better off without him.

82
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,485
Let him go.

83
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:37,355
I can't do that. Not yet.

84
00:03:40,026 --> 00:03:42,227
Oh, snap, meta-human attack.

85
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:47,465
Nope, nope, my bad, that is
just an alert for me.

86
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:50,468
- For what?
- Oh, it's just a reminder.

87
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,837
I have a date in an hour, so...

88
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:54,772
Oh, with who?

89
00:03:54,774 --> 00:03:57,041
With the lovely Kendra Saunders,

90
00:03:57,043 --> 00:03:58,509
the barista at Jitters.

91
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:00,311
Oh, she makes a mean latte.

92
00:04:00,313 --> 00:04:02,380
I think we're gonna go out
for dinner and a movie,

93
00:04:02,382 --> 00:04:04,382
and then, I don't know,
maybe some breakfast.

94
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:06,718
Wait, breakfast?

95
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,253
Why breakfast? I don't...

96
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:11,956
Yeah...

97
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,726
'Cause, you know, you go home...

98
00:04:14,728 --> 00:04:16,027
- Cisco.
- And...

99
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,362
- He's messing with you.
- Go.

100
00:04:17,364 --> 00:04:19,564
Oh.

101
00:04:25,105 --> 00:04:27,772
Patty.

102
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:37,415
- Patty, hey.
- Hey. I hear you're still sick.

103
00:04:37,417 --> 00:04:40,285
Yeah, yeah, it's a... Nasty bug.

104
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:42,854
Well, I make a mean chicken
noodle soup from scratch.

105
00:04:42,856 --> 00:04:44,923
I could bring some by later if you'd like.

106
00:04:44,925 --> 00:04:47,358
No, that's sweet, I just...
I'd feel terrible

107
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,660
if you caught any of this.

108
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:51,429
Besides, I love the canned stuff.

109
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:53,898
Okay, well, try to stay off your feet.

110
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,002
Oh, yeah, believe me, I am.

111
00:04:58,004 --> 00:05:00,238
You sure you're okay?

112
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,340
You sound like something's up.

113
00:05:02,342 --> 00:05:04,108
Yeah, no, no, no, no. I'm fine.

114
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,078
I'm just not myself right now.

115
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,414
Okay, well, I hope to see you soon,

116
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,982
and, uh, feel better.

117
00:05:10,984 --> 00:05:13,318
- Thanks.
- Bye.

118
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,520
Bye.

119
00:05:24,931 --> 00:05:27,432
You should stay away from the cheese curds.

120
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:28,633
They're addicting.

121
00:05:29,836 --> 00:05:31,469
I'm going to take a wild stab

122
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:32,770
and guess that you're here
without the consent

123
00:05:32,772 --> 00:05:35,106
of the rest of your fabulous team.

124
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:37,308
It's been difficult, having you here.

125
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,876
For all of us.

126
00:05:38,878 --> 00:05:40,378
You don't have to worry about that anymore

127
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,413
because I'm leaving.

128
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:45,450
We can help you save your daughter.

129
00:05:45,452 --> 00:05:49,721
I know that's why you want to go home.

130
00:05:49,723 --> 00:05:58,129
Look, I made a big mistake coming here.

131
00:05:58,131 --> 00:06:00,531
and use that help to stop Zoom,
and my plan failed.

132
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,100
I don't have another plan,

133
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:06,371
except to go back home and face Zoom myself.

134
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:08,139
So let's say you go back to your Earth,

135
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:09,841
and you fight Zoom.

136
00:06:09,843 --> 00:06:11,476
He will kill you.

137
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:14,946
And then, how does that help your daughter?

138
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:17,749
Look, the best way to save Jesse

139
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:21,686
is for you to stay here,
and work with us as a team.

140
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:24,255
No.

141
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:26,124
Now, please leave me alone, while I discover

142
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:29,794
which one of these breaches
is gonna get me home.

143
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:31,629
You know, you're lucky
Cisco and Professor Stein

144
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:33,631
never figured out how to close
all the breaches,

145
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:37,835
'cause then you'd be stuck here.

146
00:06:37,837 --> 00:06:41,239
Wait.

147
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:44,609
We close the breaches.

148
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:46,044
All of them, except one,

149
00:06:46,046 --> 00:06:50,214
so Zoom only has one way
to get to this world.

150
00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:56,888
- The breach at S.T.A.R. Labs.
- Exactly.

151
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,790
And then we set a trap.

152
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:03,027
It's got fencing, fighting,
torture, revenge,

153
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:07,765
giants, monsters, chases, escapes,

154
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:11,536
true love, miracles, and,

155
00:07:11,538 --> 00:07:14,872
it's ranked as one of the best
date movies of all time.

156
00:07:14,874 --> 00:07:19,043
Well, let's see if that's true.

157
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:28,619
Cisco?

158
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:31,422
Are you okay?

159
00:07:31,424 --> 00:07:33,324
I gotta go.

160
00:07:33,326 --> 00:07:35,393
What? Why?

161
00:07:35,395 --> 00:07:40,064
I am so sorry that
this is happening right now.

162
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:42,900
I am so, so sorry.

163
00:07:42,902 --> 00:07:46,771
Um, I have to go.

164
00:07:46,773 --> 00:07:48,973
I'll call you, okay?

165
00:07:48,975 --> 00:07:52,343
I'll call you, I swear.

166
00:07:52,345 --> 00:07:54,612
Mm!

167
00:07:59,552 --> 00:08:02,820
Okay, Brian, let that sit overnight,

168
00:08:02,822 --> 00:08:05,389
and then we'll assay in the morning.

169
00:08:10,163 --> 00:08:13,197
Dr. Shore?

170
00:08:18,972 --> 00:08:21,506
You okay?

171
00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:26,844
What are you doing?

172
00:08:26,846 --> 00:08:28,713
You can't take that out of here.

173
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:30,515
Ah!

174
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:43,895
What happened to me?

175
00:08:48,835 --> 00:08:49,934
What are you?

176
00:08:49,936 --> 00:08:52,737
Ah!

177
00:08:55,642 --> 00:08:58,442
Foolish Human...

178
00:08:58,444 --> 00:09:01,679
I am Grodd.

179
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:12,784
Patty.

180
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,386
What'd you find?

181
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,989
Found these weird-looking
hairs all over the street.

182
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:18,290
I'm gonna run 'em against the database

183
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,658
and see what I can find.

184
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,593
Uh, here, our victim.

185
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,662
His name's Dr. Jeffrey Shore.

186
00:09:23,736 --> 00:09:26,370
He's a biochemistry engineer
here at Vaughan Pharmaceuticals.

187
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:28,773
This is the second dead
lab tech in two weeks.

188
00:09:28,775 --> 00:09:29,974
That ain't a coincidence.

189
00:09:29,976 --> 00:09:31,609
Yeah, and like the other tech,

190
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:34,178
he had just stolen a serum
from their storage cooler.

191
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,180
- Really? What kind of serum?
- It's called Cortexin.

192
00:09:36,182 --> 00:09:37,848
It's used to treat encephalopathy,

193
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,850
a blood disease in the brain.

194
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:42,286
The serum's missing, but
his colleagues found him here

195
00:09:42,288 --> 00:09:43,487
a couple of minutes later, dead.

196
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:44,955
He didn't get far.

197
00:09:44,957 --> 00:09:47,024
He died from blunt force trauma to the head.

198
00:09:47,026 --> 00:09:49,427
Ugh, and apparently a lot of it.

199
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:52,296
Yeah, check this out.

200
00:09:52,298 --> 00:09:55,066
- Is that his blood?
- Point of impact.

201
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:56,734
Okay.

202
00:09:56,736 --> 00:09:59,337
Can you run through what you told me to her

203
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:00,638
and see if you can get anything else,

204
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,872
and if the cases are linked?

205
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:04,342
Sure thing.

206
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:05,943
- Hi.
- Some of the evidence.

207
00:10:05,945 --> 00:10:08,979
I'll be right with you. Uh, Detective?

208
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:11,048
How's Barry feeling?

209
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,017
Oh, heading to see him right now.

210
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,285
He asked me to bring him

211
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:16,354
some of my homemade chicken noodle soup.

212
00:10:16,356 --> 00:10:19,523
He hates that canned stuff.

213
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:22,560
Don't we all.

214
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:31,902
Faster, Barry!

215
00:10:33,506 --> 00:10:35,806
There you go.

216
00:10:41,314 --> 00:10:43,614
Push yourself!

217
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:53,824
- [grunts
- Barry!

218
00:10:53,826 --> 00:10:55,760
Are you okay?

219
00:10:55,762 --> 00:10:57,995
Oh, yeah, you know, I'm not great right now.

220
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:01,432
What happened?

221
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:02,666
It's nothing. I'm good, all right?

222
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:04,335
- Just forget it.
- Barry.

223
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:05,836
Talk to us. We can help you.

224
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:07,605
No, you can't help me.

225
00:11:07,607 --> 00:11:10,775
Not this time. I'm sorry.

226
00:11:10,777 --> 00:11:13,811
You just... you wouldn't understand.

227
00:11:25,158 --> 00:11:28,426
What up, Barry?

228
00:11:29,862 --> 00:11:33,230
Zoom destroyed me.

229
00:11:33,232 --> 00:11:35,533
He showed everyone in
Central City what he could do,

230
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:38,002
and that I'm powerless to stop him.

231
00:11:38,004 --> 00:11:39,637
They gave me a key to this city, Joe.

232
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,272
I'm supposed to be their hero.

233
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:44,175
I'm supposed to be the guy
that can protect them

234
00:11:44,177 --> 00:11:46,277
from something as evil as that, and I failed

235
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:49,680
in front of all of them.

236
00:12:03,596 --> 00:12:05,663
When they think of the Flash,
all they see now

237
00:12:05,665 --> 00:12:09,266
is someone not strong enough
to protect them.

238
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:14,271
- Hey.
- I'm good.

239
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:23,314
Oh, hey, I know I keep asking,

240
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:27,051
but have you read any reports
or anything recently

241
00:12:27,053 --> 00:12:29,787
about a Birdman attacking anywhere?

242
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:31,889
There's no such thing as a Birdman, Cisco.

243
00:12:31,891 --> 00:12:35,059
Okay, like that's a stretch. In this city?

244
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:37,027
Look, I know what I vibed.

245
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:41,565
It was a man with these big, wide wings.

246
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:45,002
It was crazy.

247
00:12:45,004 --> 00:12:47,238
What if it was an angel?

248
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:53,410
It was an angel.

249
00:12:53,412 --> 00:12:55,646
Caitlin?

250
00:12:55,648 --> 00:13:00,718
Okay, come on, like that's a crazy idea.

251
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,152
Ah!

252
00:13:04,423 --> 00:13:07,157
What is wrong with you?

253
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,093
Just don't know what to do about Barry.

254
00:13:09,095 --> 00:13:11,795
I mean, all the test results say he's fine,

255
00:13:11,797 --> 00:13:14,298
but it's like there's
something holding him back.

256
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,535
I keep trying to talk to him,
but I can't get through.

257
00:13:17,537 --> 00:13:19,703
Then maybe we should get the person who can.

258
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:23,173
We can talk about that
when I see you at home.

259
00:13:23,175 --> 00:13:24,241
I gotta take this, okay? Okay.

260
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:25,576
- Bye, baby.
- Bye.

261
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:27,111
Patty, what's up?

262
00:13:27,113 --> 00:13:28,979
Turns out our dead scientist
cases are linked.

263
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:30,548
Okay, hit me.

264
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,816
Well, the other scientist
stole a large quantity

265
00:13:32,818 --> 00:13:34,251
of a racetam drug,

266
00:13:34,253 --> 00:13:36,086
typically used to treat
patients with Vertigo.

267
00:13:36,088 --> 00:13:37,821
Okay, so we got two stolen drugs,

268
00:13:37,823 --> 00:13:39,623
one for blood disorders of the brain,

269
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,825
and the other one for Vertigo.
What's the connection?

270
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:43,794
Well, they are both nootropic drugs,

271
00:13:43,796 --> 00:13:45,429
used to enhance intelligence.

272
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:47,598
Hey, did you get results
from the hairs you found?

273
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,733
Yes, I did.

274
00:13:49,735 --> 00:13:52,836
Uh, apparently they were all
over the other crime scene too.

275
00:13:52,838 --> 00:13:55,873
The weird thing is, they're not human hairs.

276
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:59,810
Uh, they're hairs from a... From a gorilla.

277
00:13:59,812 --> 00:14:02,546
- How... How did you know?
- Patty, I gotta go.

278
00:14:02,548 --> 00:14:05,182
But... Uh...

279
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:14,291
Did Caitlin come through here?

280
00:14:14,293 --> 00:14:15,726
No.

281
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:18,996
She just hit me in the face and ran away.

282
00:14:18,998 --> 00:14:20,898
Yo!

283
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,633
- Grodd!
- What?

284
00:14:22,635 --> 00:14:24,802
- Grodd's back.
- Caitlin.

285
00:14:24,804 --> 00:14:26,003
That must be why she was acting like that.

286
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:28,606
She was being mind-controlled.

287
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,600
I'm continually amazed by the similarity

288
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:53,361
between our two worlds.

289
00:14:53,363 --> 00:14:55,396
You got talking gorillas on your Earth, too?

290
00:14:55,398 --> 00:14:57,765
- Oh, yeah.
- Remind me never to go there.

291
00:14:57,767 --> 00:15:02,503
Ramon, why would this Grodd abduct Dr. Snow?

292
00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:04,472
I don't know. It doesn't make any sense.

293
00:15:04,474 --> 00:15:06,207
She was always so nice to him.

294
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:08,075
He mind-controlled two lab technicians

295
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:09,977
to steal chemicals
that enhance intelligence.

296
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:11,779
He wants her for something.

297
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:14,582
Well, looks like he left
his bachelor pad in the sewers.

298
00:15:14,584 --> 00:15:16,317
Grodd's a big-ass gorilla.

299
00:15:16,319 --> 00:15:18,185
He can't just waltz through downtown

300
00:15:18,187 --> 00:15:20,021
in the middle of the day
without anybody noticing.

301
00:15:20,023 --> 00:15:21,522
Right, and if there's been sightings,

302
00:15:21,524 --> 00:15:23,891
then we might be able to
approximate his location.

303
00:15:23,893 --> 00:15:25,092
I can call CCPD.

304
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:26,560
They can access the tip hotline,

305
00:15:26,562 --> 00:15:28,262
send over files of Grodd's recent attacks.

306
00:15:28,264 --> 00:15:30,264
Good.

307
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:32,333
We gotta get her back.

308
00:15:32,335 --> 00:15:35,803
We will.

309
00:15:35,805 --> 00:15:38,039
Barry.

310
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:40,007
- Barry!
- Yeah?

311
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:41,742
You can't blame yourself for this.

312
00:15:41,744 --> 00:15:44,178
There's nothing you could've done.

313
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,613
I still don't have my speed.

314
00:15:45,615 --> 00:15:48,115
How are we supposed to save her from Grodd?

315
00:15:48,117 --> 00:15:50,685
You may not have your legs just yet,

316
00:15:50,687 --> 00:15:52,386
but you still got that brain.

317
00:15:52,388 --> 00:15:55,890
Use it. Help us figure that out.

318
00:16:05,435 --> 00:16:08,502
Where are you?

319
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:41,502
Caitlin.

320
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:44,105
Grodd?

321
00:16:44,107 --> 00:16:47,174
You... Remember me?

322
00:16:58,121 --> 00:17:02,446
Caitlin... always... kind...

323
00:17:07,997 --> 00:17:10,464
Why did you bring me here?

324
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:13,334
Need help.

325
00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:17,138
I... I don't understand.

326
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,875
How did I become Grodd?

327
00:17:20,877 --> 00:17:22,476
Oh.

328
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,679
That's a long story, Grodd.

329
00:17:25,681 --> 00:17:27,882
Um...

330
00:17:27,884 --> 00:17:29,750
The dark matter

331
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:33,187
from the particle accelerator explosion?

332
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:36,157
That's how this happened.

333
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:39,360
Repeat.

334
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:40,728
Repeat?

335
00:17:45,635 --> 00:17:50,571
Need to repeat Grodd.

336
00:17:50,573 --> 00:17:55,042
You want me to make more like you?

337
00:17:55,044 --> 00:17:58,546
I don't know how to do that.

338
00:17:58,548 --> 00:18:01,749
Learn.

339
00:18:19,302 --> 00:18:23,037
Keep that chin down, slugger.

340
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,072
Dad.

341
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:31,445
Yeah.

342
00:18:39,856 --> 00:18:44,792
That was a hell of an idea
you had, bringing Henry here.

343
00:18:44,794 --> 00:18:46,293
Well, he may not have his mother,

344
00:18:46,295 --> 00:18:48,629
but he's got two amazing fathers.

345
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:49,797
Seemed like he needed both.

346
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,800
Hmm.

347
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:55,569
- Good girl.
- Mm.

348
00:18:57,573 --> 00:18:59,874
So how did Grodd become sentient?

349
00:18:59,876 --> 00:19:02,009
A few years ago, S.T.A.R. Labs
had this contract

350
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:04,078
with the military to research and awaken

351
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,815
latent mind-reading capabilities
for interrogation purposes.

352
00:19:07,817 --> 00:19:10,217
And I'm guessing Grodd is
one of the test subjects?

353
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:12,253
Right, but then Dr. Wells
shut down the program,

354
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,021
and we all thought it was to save Grodd

355
00:19:14,023 --> 00:19:17,558
from all the crazy mind-control experiments,

356
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,060
but it was really so that
Dr. Wells could use

357
00:19:20,062 --> 00:19:21,462
the accelerator explosion to create

358
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:23,430
a 1,500-pound mind-controlling gorilla

359
00:19:23,432 --> 00:19:26,200
that he could manipulate.

360
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,570
What kind of algorithm is that?

361
00:19:29,572 --> 00:19:32,072
It's an algorithm meant to
extrapolate Grodd's location

362
00:19:32,074 --> 00:19:35,709
from places we know he's already been.

363
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:41,348
Hello.

364
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,017
There we have it.

365
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:44,985
No spinal cord edema.

366
00:19:44,987 --> 00:19:46,921
I don't see any subacute hemorrhaging.

367
00:19:46,923 --> 00:19:51,458
Bone fused beautifully.
You're all good, Barry.

368
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,927
I'd give you some physical therapy,

369
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:56,530
but you don't need it.

370
00:19:56,532 --> 00:19:57,898
I'm really glad you're here, Dad.

371
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,667
Me too.

372
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:01,769
You know, I tried to call,
but you can't a cell

373
00:20:01,771 --> 00:20:03,804
in Granite Peak National Park, so...

374
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:05,172
Granite Peak... what are you...

375
00:20:05,174 --> 00:20:06,941
You went camping by yourself?

376
00:20:06,943 --> 00:20:09,977
Yeah, yeah, I got a tent.
I went fishing every day.

377
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:13,480
I have had my fill of
largemouth bass for a while.

378
00:20:16,552 --> 00:20:21,121
Sometimes you just have to slow down

379
00:20:21,123 --> 00:20:24,792
to get back to where you want to be.

380
00:20:24,794 --> 00:20:28,162
- Yeah. Look, Dad...
- Hey, guys.

381
00:20:28,164 --> 00:20:29,997
I think we've found them.

382
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:31,498
Yeah?

383
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,301
Grodd has to be in one of
these three bell towers.

384
00:20:34,303 --> 00:20:35,769
The only reason we couldn't find him

385
00:20:35,771 --> 00:20:37,571
on any cameras underneath the city before is

386
00:20:37,573 --> 00:20:39,239
'cause he upgraded from a bachelor pad

387
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:41,342
to a penthouse, like a baller.

388
00:20:41,344 --> 00:20:42,676
Okay, so we know where he is.

389
00:20:42,678 --> 00:20:44,144
We still don't know how to get her.

390
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:46,080
- We got a plan for you.
- What's the plan?

391
00:20:46,082 --> 00:20:47,915
We use me.

392
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:52,219
That's Harry! That's the other Wells!

393
00:20:52,221 --> 00:20:53,988
- Barry.
- Let him go.

394
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,690
Let him go.

395
00:20:56,692 --> 00:20:58,058
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

396
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,727
We found another suit in the Time Vault.

397
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:01,328
- I thought he was dead.
- He's dead.

398
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,098
This is... this is Harrison Wells
from Earth-2.

399
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,799
- Earth-2?
- I'll explain later.

400
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:07,501
If we can get Harry to convince Grodd

401
00:21:07,503 --> 00:21:09,770
that he's Wells, that he's his father,

402
00:21:09,772 --> 00:21:13,107
maybe we can convince him to let Caitlin go.

403
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:19,146
I'm not gonna be able to help
if anything goes wrong.

404
00:21:19,148 --> 00:21:22,416
That's a chance I'm willing to take.

405
00:21:27,249 --> 00:21:29,628
Looks like we're 0 for 2 on
the bell towers, huh?

406
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:31,182
I like to think of it more as,

407
00:21:31,184 --> 00:21:33,518
now we know exactly where they are.

408
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,119
Okay, let's do this again.
Gimme your best Wells.

409
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:36,521
I'm not doing the Wells again, Ramon.

410
00:21:36,523 --> 00:21:38,022
- I told you...
- Look.

411
00:21:38,024 --> 00:21:40,525
I just made these
anti-mind-control ear buds.

412
00:21:40,527 --> 00:21:42,827
They could fail, and
if they do, you're toast,

413
00:21:42,829 --> 00:21:44,662
so you're gonna need to nail it
if you want to live.

414
00:21:44,664 --> 00:21:48,099
Ramon.

415
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:51,936
- Cisco.
- Cisco.

416
00:21:51,938 --> 00:21:56,307
In many ways, you've shown me
what it's like to have a son.

417
00:21:57,243 --> 00:21:58,743
What?

418
00:21:58,745 --> 00:22:02,146
Okay, let's... Let's just try it again.

419
00:22:02,148 --> 00:22:05,350
This time, up the creep
factor, like, a lot more,

420
00:22:05,352 --> 00:22:08,620
and make it a little more sincere.

421
00:22:08,622 --> 00:22:10,088
Like you really love me,

422
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,791
but you're gonna have to kill me anyway.

423
00:22:13,793 --> 00:22:16,961
Cisco.

424
00:22:16,963 --> 00:22:18,896
In many ways,

425
00:22:18,898 --> 00:22:23,801
you've shown me what
it's like to have a son.

426
00:22:23,803 --> 00:22:27,271
Yup, that's the one. Here you go.

427
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:31,009
Yo.

428
00:22:31,011 --> 00:22:33,011
Yeah, we're moving on to the third location.

429
00:22:33,013 --> 00:22:35,313
Copy that.

430
00:22:35,315 --> 00:22:37,448
Now we wait.

431
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,417
So this is what it's like

432
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:42,387
every time you go after
one of those meta-humans?

433
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:44,355
Uh, pretty much.

434
00:22:44,357 --> 00:22:46,457
Only, Cisco and Caitlin are
normally the ones in here

435
00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:48,026
and I'm the one out there.

436
00:22:48,028 --> 00:22:50,695
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't be.

437
00:22:50,697 --> 00:22:53,798
Iris showed me what happened.

438
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,467
With Zoom?

439
00:22:56,469 --> 00:22:58,202
That was hard to watch.

440
00:22:58,204 --> 00:23:02,073
I can only imagine what that
must have been like for you.

441
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,677
He showed everyone in Central City

442
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,681
that their hero wasn't
good enough to stop him.

443
00:23:09,683 --> 00:23:12,383
Well, that's certainly what it looked like.

444
00:23:12,385 --> 00:23:13,651
Was he right?

445
00:23:14,921 --> 00:23:16,487
Your body's healed, Barry,

446
00:23:16,489 --> 00:23:19,757
and yet here you are,

447
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:22,894
feeling the shame of losing.

448
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,963
I can't stop him.

449
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:28,633
I know it. He knows it.

450
00:23:28,635 --> 00:23:32,770
And now everyone in this city knows it too.

451
00:23:32,772 --> 00:23:35,239
They don't believe in me anymore, Dad.

452
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:36,941
At my trial for your mother's death,

453
00:23:36,943 --> 00:23:39,444
a lot of our family and friends
were in the courtroom.

454
00:23:39,446 --> 00:23:43,648
They heard awful things about
what I had done to your mother.

455
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,817
It didn't matter that it wasn't true.

456
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:47,652
Every day, I could see it on their faces,

457
00:23:47,654 --> 00:23:49,987
the moment when I lost them,

458
00:23:49,989 --> 00:23:53,758
until everybody had stopped believing in me.

459
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,560
Well, that was my reality.

460
00:23:55,562 --> 00:23:57,695
You know, I was gonna serve a life sentence

461
00:23:57,697 --> 00:24:00,331
for a crime I didn't commit,
but worse than that,

462
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,966
every time I looked at someone in the eye

463
00:24:01,968 --> 00:24:03,334
from that moment forward,
they were gonna believe

464
00:24:03,336 --> 00:24:07,605
that I had killed the woman I loved

465
00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:13,010
in front of our son.

466
00:24:13,012 --> 00:24:16,414
So yeah, I do know what it's like

467
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:22,019
being destroyed.

468
00:24:22,021 --> 00:24:25,256
How did you get past that?

469
00:24:25,258 --> 00:24:27,158
I embraced it.

470
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:32,296
Accepting it was the only way
that I could move forward,

471
00:24:32,298 --> 00:24:36,234
but I know that if I could survive that,

472
00:24:36,236 --> 00:24:38,236
and learn to believe in myself again,

473
00:24:38,238 --> 00:24:42,240
then I could survive anything.

474
00:24:42,242 --> 00:24:45,143
You know what lit that belief in me, Barry?

475
00:24:45,145 --> 00:24:47,979
You.

476
00:24:47,981 --> 00:24:50,248
11-year-old you, running around,
believing in me,

477
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,584
gave me that hope.

478
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:01,392
And now I'm giving it back to you, son.

479
00:25:01,394 --> 00:25:05,429
No more monsters can take that from us.

480
00:25:12,238 --> 00:25:14,572
So, one of the main differences

481
00:25:14,574 --> 00:25:17,475
between ape and human brains

482
00:25:17,477 --> 00:25:20,511
is the white matter and
connectivity in the brain cells.

483
00:25:21,915 --> 00:25:23,581
The chemicals that you were treated with

484
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:26,217
as an infant were meant
to overcome those differences

485
00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:29,287
and cause an explosive growth of both,

486
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:30,755
similar to what humans experience

487
00:25:30,757 --> 00:25:33,124
in their first few years of life.

488
00:25:33,126 --> 00:25:35,026
Maybe these chemicals can be used

489
00:25:35,028 --> 00:25:37,195
to duplicate that growth,
and then we won't need

490
00:25:37,197 --> 00:25:39,363
a particle accelerator explosion.

491
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,607
Hey, buddy.

492
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:53,344
Easy, buddy. It's me.

493
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:56,080
I'm back.

494
00:25:56,082 --> 00:25:59,483
Father, you died.

495
00:25:59,485 --> 00:26:02,053
No.

496
00:26:02,055 --> 00:26:05,122
No, buddy, I didn't die.

497
00:26:05,124 --> 00:26:07,458
I just went away for a while.

498
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,729
All right, that's great,
Wells, keep talking.

499
00:26:11,731 --> 00:26:16,100
But now that I'm back,

500
00:26:16,102 --> 00:26:20,738
we don't need Caitlin anymore, do we, buddy?

501
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,340
So you can let her go.

502
00:26:24,911 --> 00:26:27,912
Come on, buddy.

503
00:26:29,182 --> 00:26:32,884
Let me get her out of here.

504
00:26:32,886 --> 00:26:35,686
Please.

505
00:26:35,688 --> 00:26:40,892
Father never ask. Father take.

506
00:26:40,894 --> 00:26:42,326
Run.

507
00:26:44,631 --> 00:26:47,498
Who are you?

508
00:26:48,701 --> 00:26:51,369
Cisco, you gotta get in there, man.

509
00:26:53,773 --> 00:26:55,106
Oh, Cisco, thank God.

510
00:26:55,108 --> 00:26:56,741
Okay, you guys gotta get out of there.

511
00:26:56,743 --> 00:26:58,075
Harry's trapped. We can't leave him here.

512
00:26:58,077 --> 00:27:00,811
What do we do?

513
00:27:00,813 --> 00:27:03,514
The drugs. The drugs that Grodd stole.

514
00:27:03,516 --> 00:27:05,917
Wells... an overdose of those
drugs will shock his brain.

515
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,452
Okay, just hit him with as much as you can.

516
00:27:08,454 --> 00:27:12,156
You are not him! You are not Father!

517
00:27:12,158 --> 00:27:15,626
I am father.

518
00:27:15,628 --> 00:27:20,364
And you hit father.

519
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:22,934
Grodd.

520
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,574
Look at me.

521
00:27:30,576 --> 00:27:34,078
Look at me!

522
00:27:36,716 --> 00:27:40,651
I would never leave you here alone.

523
00:27:40,653 --> 00:27:44,155
Grodd, I made you a promise.

524
00:27:46,426 --> 00:27:52,196
I have bigger plans for you. Remember?

525
00:27:52,198 --> 00:27:57,435
One day, this city will be yours.

526
00:27:57,437 --> 00:28:00,805
I promised you.

527
00:28:00,807 --> 00:28:03,474
I intend to honor that promise.

528
00:28:08,681 --> 00:28:11,415
Go!

529
00:28:16,923 --> 00:28:19,290
Come on.

530
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:32,276
- Thank you.
- Thank you for rescuing me.

531
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:35,779
Well, we're a team, right?

532
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:39,054
I'm impressed. I think we all are.

533
00:28:39,056 --> 00:28:41,489
Yeah, well, we need to do
something about Grodd.

534
00:28:41,491 --> 00:28:44,292
- Like what?
- Like get rid of him for good.

535
00:28:44,294 --> 00:28:45,527
You want to kill him?

536
00:28:45,528 --> 00:28:47,595
Considering how many
people he's killed, yeah.

537
00:28:47,596 --> 00:28:49,229
This isn't Grodd's fault.

538
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:51,531
He's only like this because
Wells made him this way.

539
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:54,100
Yes, but, Catie, he kidnapped
you and you could have died.

540
00:28:54,102 --> 00:28:56,303
You didn't see what I saw.

541
00:28:56,305 --> 00:28:58,605
Grodd's getting smarter.

542
00:28:58,607 --> 00:29:00,674
He's lonely and sad.

543
00:29:00,676 --> 00:29:02,209
He wan more apes like him.

544
00:29:02,211 --> 00:29:03,977
What are you saying? He wants kids?

545
00:29:03,979 --> 00:29:06,012
'Cause I'm pretty sure
one telepathic Grape Ape

546
00:29:06,014 --> 00:29:08,715
is more than enough for this city.

547
00:29:08,717 --> 00:29:10,717
I know somewhere we could send him.

548
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:12,486
What are you talking about?

549
00:29:12,488 --> 00:29:15,288
When the singularity exploded
and I discovered the breach

550
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,458
in S.T.A.R. Labs, I ran similar tests

551
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,362
and discovered the same thing,
51 additional breaches.

552
00:29:22,364 --> 00:29:24,631
The difference being
the breaches in Central City

553
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:26,299
are scattered all throughout the city

554
00:29:26,301 --> 00:29:29,169
whereas counterparts in my world
most definitely are not.

555
00:29:29,171 --> 00:29:30,737
And you know where they lead?

556
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:33,573
Well, I was in the process
of figuring all that out

557
00:29:33,575 --> 00:29:36,109
when Dr. Snow so gallantly
convinced me to stay,

558
00:29:36,111 --> 00:29:39,846
but if I am correct,
this breach is gonna get Grodd

559
00:29:39,848 --> 00:29:42,315
as close to home as he's ever likely to get.

560
00:29:42,317 --> 00:29:45,452
Okay, even if you're right,

561
00:29:45,454 --> 00:29:49,022
how do we bait Grodd to go through it?

562
00:29:49,024 --> 00:29:51,691
My son'll do it.

563
00:29:51,693 --> 00:29:54,160
Won't you, Flash?

564
00:30:03,338 --> 00:30:05,872
Grodd?

565
00:30:07,342 --> 00:30:10,043
Caitlin.

566
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:20,186
Flash.

567
00:30:20,188 --> 00:30:21,688
You want Caitlin, Grodd,

568
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:26,059
you're gonna have to catch me first.

569
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:45,712
So Barry's gonna lure Grodd
in front of the breach?

570
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:47,681
Yep, and once he gets him to the right spot,

571
00:30:47,683 --> 00:30:50,450
Cisco's gonna blast him into
Earth-2 with his thingamajig.

572
00:30:50,452 --> 00:30:52,852
- Speed cannon.
- Exactly.

573
00:30:52,854 --> 00:30:55,822
Well, things have gotten
a lot more complicated

574
00:30:55,824 --> 00:30:57,457
since I got out of prison.

575
00:30:57,459 --> 00:30:59,793
- Mm-hmm.
- Man, you have no idea.

576
00:30:59,795 --> 00:31:02,228
Cisco, almost there. Are you ready?

577
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,730
I'm in position.

578
00:31:03,732 --> 00:31:05,966
Now, once you turn on the speed cannon,

579
00:31:05,968 --> 00:31:07,534
the quark matter will stabilize,

580
00:31:07,536 --> 00:31:09,035
stretching the breach about so big,

581
00:31:09,037 --> 00:31:13,206
so anywhere within this circle will suffice.

582
00:31:20,282 --> 00:31:24,250
Right on time.

583
00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:25,852
Okay, come on.

584
00:31:25,854 --> 00:31:30,457
I don't have eyes on Grodd.
Does anyone see him?

585
00:31:34,096 --> 00:31:36,062
That is a big gorilla.

586
00:31:36,064 --> 00:31:39,633
Where is Caitlin?

587
00:31:41,036 --> 00:31:43,937
Ah!

588
00:31:45,273 --> 00:31:46,806
- Oh, my God.
- Get up, Barry.

589
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:49,776
Ah!

590
00:31:49,778 --> 00:31:52,746
Where is Caitlin, Flash?

591
00:31:54,116 --> 00:31:55,315
Right here.

592
00:31:55,317 --> 00:31:57,517
No. No, no, no.

593
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,519
You need to let him go, Grodd.

594
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:01,755
Flash is my enemy.

595
00:32:01,757 --> 00:32:05,525
Now you, too. No.

596
00:32:05,527 --> 00:32:08,762
He was trying to save me from you.

597
00:32:08,764 --> 00:32:10,397
We didn't understand what you wanted,

598
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,666
but now we do.

599
00:32:14,603 --> 00:32:19,105
I can give you what you want.
I can give you a home.

600
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:22,175
You just have to trust me.

601
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:30,316
All right, here he comes.

602
00:32:36,825 --> 00:32:40,960
Ready to flip the switch.

603
00:32:40,962 --> 00:32:43,096
Now, Barry.

604
00:32:55,143 --> 00:32:57,210
- Full power.
- It is.

605
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:11,591
Barry, you can't let Grodd get free.

606
00:33:11,593 --> 00:33:15,061
Conquer your fears, son.
Believe in yourself.

607
00:33:36,184 --> 00:33:38,852
Come on, come on, come on.

608
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:04,201
Welcome back, Flash.

609
00:34:06,051 --> 00:34:07,668
Thanks, bro.

610
00:34:15,213 --> 00:34:18,414
I can't believe something good
finally came from that suit.

611
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:19,916
First and the last time.

612
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,684
That thing still gives me the creeps.

613
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:23,286
We should destroy it.

614
00:34:23,288 --> 00:34:25,355
Let's do that, but see if you can figure out

615
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:26,990
how to get it back in this ring first.

616
00:34:26,992 --> 00:34:28,591
Might be nice to have something like that

617
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:30,093
instead of carrying around
a bag all the time.

618
00:34:30,095 --> 00:34:33,396
I can help you with that.

619
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:34,864
What?

620
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:36,733
I know a thing or two
about micro-technology.

621
00:34:36,735 --> 00:34:39,135
Yeah, you know a thing or two
about a lot of things.

622
00:34:39,137 --> 00:34:41,204
Well, as long as what he knows keeps my son

623
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:44,707
and these good people safe,
the more you know, the better.

624
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:47,677
Pleasure to meet you, Harrison. Again.

625
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,146
Dr. Allen.

626
00:34:50,148 --> 00:34:52,882
Good to see you. Cisco.

627
00:34:52,884 --> 00:34:55,685
- Let's go.
- Take care.

628
00:34:55,687 --> 00:34:57,854
So, Dr. Wells, this place on your Earth

629
00:34:57,856 --> 00:35:01,624
that we've sent Grodd, what is it exactly?

630
00:35:01,626 --> 00:35:06,529
It's a refuge where gorillas
subjected to lab experiments,

631
00:35:06,531 --> 00:35:11,267
like Grodd,

632
00:35:11,269 --> 00:35:14,237
can roam freely.

633
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,438
I know it's for the best,

634
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,240
but I still feel like I betrayed him.

635
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:21,177
No, don't say that. You didn't betray him.

636
00:35:21,179 --> 00:35:24,414
You gave him a better life.

637
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,916
I still don't understand, though, I...

638
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:29,252
Why do the breaches on our Earth

639
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:31,387
lead to different places on yours?

640
00:35:31,389 --> 00:35:34,991
I don't know yet, Ramon,

641
00:35:34,993 --> 00:35:37,226
but I do know we have to close them all,

642
00:35:37,228 --> 00:35:38,695
and I don't know how to do that.

643
00:35:38,697 --> 00:35:40,997
You don't have to do it alone anymore.

644
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:42,699
Any of it.

645
00:35:42,701 --> 00:35:46,669
Together, we defeated Grodd,
and if we stay that way,

646
00:35:46,671 --> 00:35:48,805
we will figure out
how to close the breaches,

647
00:35:48,807 --> 00:35:52,408
get Zoom, and get you your daughter back.

648
00:35:53,978 --> 00:35:56,479
Thank you.

649
00:35:58,817 --> 00:36:02,452
Oh, this one is definitely a keeper.

650
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:04,454
Oh, yeah.

651
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:07,590
He could've done your standard
vinegar and baking soda volcano,

652
00:36:07,592 --> 00:36:11,360
but no, Barry wanted to do
a molecular structure

653
00:36:11,362 --> 00:36:12,995
of chocolate and nougat.

654
00:36:12,997 --> 00:36:15,064
- Mm-hmm.
- That's my favorite candy bar.

655
00:36:15,066 --> 00:36:16,232
Who does that in the sixth grade?

656
00:36:16,234 --> 00:36:19,569
Why, a true science nerd.

657
00:36:19,571 --> 00:36:23,139
Like father, like son, I suppose.

658
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:24,774
All right, Dad, we should get going.

659
00:36:24,776 --> 00:36:26,676
Yeah. Uh, Joe, can I have...

660
00:36:26,678 --> 00:36:29,612
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

661
00:36:29,614 --> 00:36:32,982
Iris, thank you so much
for reaching out to me.

662
00:36:32,984 --> 00:36:37,887
I am so glad you did. Me, too.

663
00:36:37,889 --> 00:36:41,624
Joe, there are no words, man.

664
00:36:44,095 --> 00:36:45,795
Thanks.

665
00:36:45,797 --> 00:36:48,498
All right, I'm gonna swing by
my lab before I come home.

666
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,768
Which reminds me... Patty?
She's a smart girl.

667
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:54,036
She's not buying your whole sick story, FYI.

668
00:36:54,038 --> 00:36:55,872
- All right.
- Patty?

669
00:36:55,874 --> 00:36:58,074
Would this be a new girlfriend?

670
00:36:58,076 --> 00:37:01,043
Uh, yeah, something like that, yeah.

671
00:37:01,045 --> 00:37:03,546
We'll talk about it on the way
to the bus station.

672
00:37:03,548 --> 00:37:05,581
Come on.

673
00:37:07,085 --> 00:37:09,585
- Bye.
- See ya.

674
00:37:14,626 --> 00:37:17,026
You okay?

675
00:37:17,028 --> 00:37:20,329
It's embarrassing. I... I love Barry

676
00:37:20,331 --> 00:37:24,967
like he's my own son, but
when I'm reminded that he isn't,

677
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:26,869
I start to wonder what it would've been like

678
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:29,071
if, you know...

679
00:37:29,073 --> 00:37:30,773
Dad, you would've been just as amazing

680
00:37:30,775 --> 00:37:34,777
with your own son, just like
you were with me and Barry.

681
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:49,859
I hear you've been spending
a lot of time up here.

682
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:53,129
Well, you know what they say.

683
00:37:53,131 --> 00:37:55,765
When the CSI's away...

684
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:58,367
It's good to see you on your feet again.

685
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:01,270
Must've been all that canned soup you had.

686
00:38:01,272 --> 00:38:06,108
Or maybe the homemade stuff Joe brought you?

687
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,978
It... yeah, I wasn't actually sick, Patty.

688
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,614
Yeah, I figured that out.

689
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,588
Why did you lie to me?

690
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,989
My dad was in town.

691
00:38:19,991 --> 00:38:22,158
I needed to spend some time with him.

692
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,595
And you couldn't just tell me that?

693
00:38:25,597 --> 00:38:30,433
You gotta understand, Patty,
my dad was convicted of murder.

694
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:32,735
When someone's image has been
tarnished like that,

695
00:38:32,737 --> 00:38:36,072
it's hard for some people to see past it.

696
00:38:36,074 --> 00:38:38,441
And you seriously think
I'm one of those people?

697
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:41,377
No, I know, I should've
given you more credit.

698
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:44,447
No, you should've given
yourself more credit.

699
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:46,282
This isn't about your father, Barry.

700
00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:49,252
This is about you.

701
00:38:49,254 --> 00:38:54,056
I need to know that I can trust
you if we're gonna do this.

702
00:38:55,393 --> 00:38:59,695
- Okay.
- I'm serious.

703
00:38:59,697 --> 00:39:01,430
I can tell.

704
00:39:01,432 --> 00:39:04,667
You cannot always be a smart ass.

705
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:26,122
- Hi.
- Hi.

706
00:39:26,124 --> 00:39:28,691
I didn't know if you liked
flowers or chocolate,

707
00:39:28,693 --> 00:39:32,128
so... I got you both.

708
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,297
Well, I'm allergic to chocolate,

709
00:39:34,299 --> 00:39:38,000
and I think that flowers
are a waste of money.

710
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:41,737
Um... I have lollipops in my car?

711
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:44,774
- Cisco, I'm joking.
- Oh, God.

712
00:39:44,776 --> 00:39:48,010
This is great. Thank you.

713
00:39:48,012 --> 00:39:50,813
Listen, I wanted to come over here

714
00:39:50,815 --> 00:39:55,084
and say I'm sorry for
bailing the other night.

715
00:39:55,086 --> 00:39:59,021
I... I'm a liaison with the CCPD
and there was an emergency,

716
00:39:59,023 --> 00:39:59,989
and I had to be there.

717
00:39:59,991 --> 00:40:02,158
- The CCPD?
- Yeah.

718
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,228
Wow, that's really cool. And very brave.

719
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,596
Thank you.

720
00:40:07,598 --> 00:40:12,568
And this is very, very sweet, Cisco.

721
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:15,471
Um, what is this?

722
00:40:15,473 --> 00:40:17,173
- Well, see, that right there.
- Mm-hmm?

723
00:40:17,175 --> 00:40:19,475
That's a digital movie projector.

724
00:40:19,477 --> 00:40:22,345
I loaded all of "Princess Bride" on there.

725
00:40:22,347 --> 00:40:24,046
Mm-hmm, that's right.

726
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:26,649
So, all we need is a wall, or, you know,

727
00:40:26,651 --> 00:40:31,687
some place where we can pick up
our date where we left off.

728
00:40:31,689 --> 00:40:37,493
Well, if we're gonna pick up
right where we left it...

729
00:40:53,778 --> 00:40:55,878
Whoa.

730
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,281
Whoa what? What's wrong?

731
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,054
Nothing.

732
00:41:05,056 --> 00:41:08,724
You're just a really amazing kisser.

733
00:41:08,726 --> 00:41:11,727
Okay.

734
00:41:12,997 --> 00:41:16,866
- Let's go watch "Princess Bride."
- Let's.

735
00:41:16,868 --> 00:41:19,135
There's a great wall up on the roof.
