1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:08,440
He's the most unsympathetic, selfish
person I've ever met.

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,740
I would never touch him.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,260
I told you I won't
have sex before I get married, right?

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,600
Jesus!

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,600
My brother is a complete psychopath.

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,020
Psychopath?

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,480
Tell me you didn't sleep with my brother.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,080
I don't know.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,140
You didn't sleep with Nico.
-But he took pictures of me. Naked pictures.

10
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,160
I reported him.

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,860
What's the plan?

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,820
Are you gonna go around London
being an asshole because your brother is mean?

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,300
Because your girl lied to you?

14
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,200
We should just lie here today.

15
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,220
Okay.

16
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,020
What's wrong?

17
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,980
Don't stop.

18
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,380
I need some space, okay?

19
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,300
You don't need space.

20
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,040
Dead serious.

21
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,440
I respect you.

22
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,740
Now you have to respect me.

23
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:18,260
I had.. sex when I was thirteen.

24
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:40,800
And the guy I had sex with
behaved really shitty afterwards.

25
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:57,160
So in the spring..
It was not just because of that.

26
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,420
Lots of stuff.

27
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,560
But then I got kind of..

28
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,300
.. sick.

29
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,920
So I'm probably just..

30
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:35,400
.. scared that something
like that will happen again.

31
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,740
Hey you..

32
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,860
I'm really damn sorry..

33
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,180
.. for what Nico has done.

34
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,780
But it wasn't your fault.

35
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,460
Nothing serious happened,
and he'll be convicted.

36
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,000
Isn't that good?

37
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,080
We have a legal system in Norway.

38
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:30,940
We just have to trust 
that the legal system is fair.

39
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,020
So you don't have to kill him.

40
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,160
You didn't kill him, did you?

41
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,440
I haven't seen him.

42
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,480
I went to London.

43
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,220
Is he in Oslo?

44
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,060
Don't know.

45
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,480
I haven't been to the apartment.

46
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:38,400
Is it you who has
been living in our basement?

47
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,800
There really is someone
who's living in our basement.

48
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,760
So damn creepy.

49
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,300
I know!

50
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,300
I stayed with Chris.
I'll continue to stay wiht Chris.

51
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,740
You can live here, too.

52
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,940
But you have to..

53
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,060
.. go back to the apartment sometime.

54
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,960
I can't meet Nico.

55
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,600
I can come with you.

56
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,180
I'm not scared of him.

57
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,740
Hello?

58
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,100
He's not here.

59
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,020
What do you wanna do now?

60
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,960
Leave again.

61
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,340
Don't you want to be here for awhile?
-Why should I?

62
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,220
You have to take back your apartment.

63
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,900
I can't live here.

64
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,700
You..

65
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:36,220
You need to give in now. You can't
run from your brother for the rest of your life.

66
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,940
You just have to face him.

67
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:47,000
You have to look him in the eye
and tell him he's a fucking loser.

68
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,180
Be done with it.

69
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,560
That's not how it works.

70
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,180
I don't know what I
would have done if I had met him now.

71
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,140
Where will you move to?

72
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,440
I'll buy a new apartment.

73
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,380
You have money for that?

74
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,980
It'll work itself out.

75
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:40,080
So your solution
is to buy a new apartment?

76
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,020
Yes.

77
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,680
Do you want to move in with me?

78
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,320
Say yes.

79
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,040
William..

80
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:43,280
Can you not for once stop giving a damn about 
what's wright and wrong, and just do what you want?

81
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,560
Okay.

82
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,500
We'll move in together!

83
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,720
We'll move in together.

84
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,600
Don't stop.

85
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,180
You don't need to.

86
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,920
What's that?

87
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,300
William!

88
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,920
Summon for interrogation. 
Friday, 3rd of June. At 3 o' clock.

89
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,640
Why?

90
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:59,360
Because I smashed a bottle on that 
guy's head. There's a video of it.

91
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,880
Why did you guys stop
talking when I came?

92
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,780
Have you received a letter from the police?

93
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,480
No.

94
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,020
Have you?

95
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:16,220
We've been summoned for questioning about the 
fight on the night of the bus party. They called our parents.

96
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,380
Mom snapped completely.
-Mine too.

97
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,860
Why was I not summoned?

98
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,940
Probably because you left
before the police arrived. They took our names.

99
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,660
They came across the video on the internet.
The police has reported the case themselves.

100
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,180
But it's good that you weren't summoned.
It prevents you from having to testify against William.

101
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:58,420
Will you guys testify against William?

102
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,920
What should we do?
We can't lie to the police.

103
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,060
We can refuse to say anything.

104
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeah, we have the right to remain silent.

105
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:18,020
They can't convict him based
on just that video anyway.

106
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:26,020
The quality is bad and it's unfocused.

107
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:34,240
We really have to think this through carefully. 
He could go to prison for six months. I googled it.

108
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,140
This all started when William did something good.
-How so?

109
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,300
In the winter William beat up a Yakuza guy 
for calling Iben, Chris' ex-girlfiriend, a cheap whore.

110
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:50,260
To avenge himself he beat up three 
Penetrator guys. And William did nothing.

111
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:56,040
They beat up Jonas. Then Chris and Isak 
planned to beat up Yakuza on the night of the bus party.

112
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,360
William didn't know anything about it.

113
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,680
But he ended up having to take it.

114
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,280
Can't we tell them this story?

115
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:15,640
I don't think that's how it works. They're only interested
in who threw the bottle at someone's head.

116
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,220
Why did William
smash that bottle, Noora?

117
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,660
Why?
-Yes.

118
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:44,520
He smashed it because
he felt it was his fault.

119
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:52,080
That Yakuza beat
up his best friend.

120
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:59,820
He's extremely loyal
to the ones he loves.

121
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,180
So he did it because..

122
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:12,860
He doesn't entrust this responsibility 
with adult people, because..

123
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:21,520
There has never been an 
adult who has taken responsibility of him.

124
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,760
He also has a little trouble controlling his mind.

125
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,600
It'd be great if you said that, too.

126
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,980
I say we shut our
mouths at the questioning.

127
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,040
I agree.

128
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,340
Okay, let's do it.

129
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,380
Do you think Isak
and Jonas will say anything?

130
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,300
No, it was William who helped them.

131
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,240
Jonas doesn't even like the police.

132
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,720
The only thing that could fuck 
up everything, is if Yakuza testifies against him.

133
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,660
Eskild?

134
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,500
Eskild!

135
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,740
What?

136
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,660
I don't know who you've got
living down in our basement..

137
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:08,720
But it has to stop. We've gotten
complaints from our downstairs neighbors.

138
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,460
I don't know anything about it.
It's not me.

139
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:22,300
Is it Tito?
Or Nito?

140
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,740
I don't know anything about it.
It could be Linn.

141
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,240
It's your bedding.

142
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,740
No, it's not.

143
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:46,800
You know what bedding is mine? Stalker.

144
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,540
Eskild, I'm the only
one who washes bedding in this house.

145
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:59,800
Had it not been for me,
your bedding would be full of stiff, old cum.

146
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,560
What's this?

147
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,280
Did you just say
stiff, old cum?

148
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,480
Wow!

149
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,600
Way to go, girl!

150
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,240
Dirty.

151
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,100
Eskild, don't change the subject now!

152
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,380
It's because of William.

153
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,340
No, it's not because of William!

154
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,960
Yes, it is. I can see it in you.
You think in a more sexual way.

155
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,120
Good job, William. Applause!
From one guy to another.

156
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,960
He got them juices flowin', Willy!

157
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,760
Fuck, Eskild. Shut up!

158
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,860
Did you guys have sex?

159
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,760
No!

160
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:53,860
You're gonna have it now! 
You're so horny now, help!

161
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,740
Didn't you see the video?

162
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,740
Are you kidding me now?

163
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,040
"Skogtur". On Google. Search for "Skogtur".

164
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:07,500
You can watch it with William. Foreplay. 
-Bye, Eskild.

165
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,020
Stop having people live in the basement.

166
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,940
Eskild!

167
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,400
Yes? "Skogtur"

168
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,840
Say hi to Tito and tell
him to find himself a new place to live.

169
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,060
Yeah.

170
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:40,060
But let me know if you're going to watch
that video. It's been a long time since I've seen it.

171
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,500
It's quite cool to watch it together.
-Bye!

172
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:19,760
<i>[Who did you get the number from?]</i>

173
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:41,540
<i>[Eva got it from Iben who got it from the guy's ex.]</i>

174
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:56,980
<i>[Okay. Wish me luck.]</i>

175
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,340
Hey you..
-Hm?

176
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,180
Why do you actually
write Noora with two O's?

177
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,520
No one else does it.

178
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,280
Eh, you know Vilde..

179
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,700
Yes. I know Vilde..

180
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,420
Yeah..

181
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:40,520
She just sent me the
number of the Yakuza guy.

182
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,580
Okay, what are going to do with it?

183
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,920
No, I just thought that..

184
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,040
.. maybe you could call him.

185
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,820
Why should I?

186
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:19,780
So that you could've asked him if
he couldn't say anything in the interrogation.

187
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,220
No.

188
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,040
William!

189
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,060
Seriously!

190
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,100
Please.

191
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,100
Forget it.

192
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,320
Yeah but listen!

193
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,220
Everyone is keeping their mouth shut.

194
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,520
Your guys, Isak and Jonas, and my friends. Everyone!

195
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:59,980
If you don't say anything about all that they did,
they won't say anything about what you did either.

196
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,640
Noora..

197
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,140
No.

198
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,260
Forget it.

199
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,620
Done.

200
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:39,820
He refuses to call, so that's fucked.

201
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:59,560
<i>[Seriously? Guys are such idiots. Why doe he have to be so proud? 
We're talking about six months in prison.]</i>

202
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,880
<i>[Ik] I know?</i>

203
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:17,060
<i>[But you can call him..]</i>

204
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,700
Do you want to read to me?

205
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,500
Ibsen?

206
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,160
Please?

207
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,340
Why?

208
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:41,200
Because I'm excited
to hear Ibsen's story.

209
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,980
Story? The story of Ibsen?

210
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,500
Yes.
-The Ibsen of the story?

211
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,120
There's nothing here.
-There's lots of pages here.

212
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
Just read 'em.

213
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,120
Read 'em words?

214
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,580
A Doll's House.

215
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,880
A Doll's House?

216
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,560
<i>[Insert Norwegian puns that I don't understand.]</i>

217
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,960
Who cares?

218
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,980
Three-act play.
-1879.

219
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,820
No..

220
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,100
You're cute.

221
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,560
Yeah, that's true.

222
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:38,780
<i>[Hi. You don't know me, but I was there during the fight on the 29th of April. 
I just wanted to say that none of the Riot guys or anyone else who was there
will say anything about what happened. As long as you don't say anything.]</i>

223
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:58,000
<i>[Hi. You don't know me, but I was there during the fight on the 29th of April.

224
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,820
<i>[We won't say anything.]</i>

225
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,640
Hello.

226
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,500
How did it go?

227
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,180
It went fine.

228
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:50,880
Yeah, but you were there for four hours.
What did they say?

229
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:56,420
Did you get the impression
they have a lot of evidence against you?

230
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,400
I confessed.

231
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:08,820
Why did you.. You can't..
Why did you do that?

232
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,840
Hell, do I know?
Maybe it's because of what you said.

233
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:21,660
What I said?! I said you shouldn't say shit.
That's what I said.

234
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:42,080
The stuff about Nico. That we should
believe in and trust that we have a fair legal system.

235
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,940
I chose to trust it.

236
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,520
Alternatively..

237
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,100
I could have chosen to not trust it..

238
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,880
.. and just kept my mouth shut about it.

239
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,000
But then I'd nearly killed Nico.

240
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,280
If you get what I mean.

241
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,300
But what will happen now?

242
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,620
I have to go to court in a few weeks.

243
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,600
I might have to go to prison.

244
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,080
What do you want to do now?
While you're still free?

245
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,880
What do I want to do now?

246
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,300
I know what I want to do.
-What?

247
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,000
What I want to do now, 
is to have a really big party..

248
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,140
.. where we get completely wasted.

249
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,620
We'll just crawl around.

250
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,060
Okay.

251
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,200
Yeah.
-Yeah.

252
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,280
Where do you think that's gonna happen?
At my place?

253
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,240
We may as well go
back to that damn apartment.

254
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:19,120
I'm ready to order. If there's someone else
who wants to..

255
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,900
Eva!

256
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,780
You have to meet Isak!
-Hi! Eskild. -Isak.

257
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,260
And Jonas.
-Hi! Eskild.

258
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,460
I live with him.

259
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,780
We live together.
-No we live in a house with roommates.

260
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,780
We live together.

261
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,320
[Jonas talking about Noora's story of the BJ action.]

262
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,920
Huh?
-Yes!

263
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,040
What BJ action?

264
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,860
What day? On Saturday?

265
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:05,900
No! It was a really long time ago.

266
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,360
I can't remember 
everytime I get sucked off.

267
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:23,000
It's true. If we have fun,
I won't think about it anymore the day after.

268
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,400
Isn't that a good philosophy?

269
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,880
Do your thing!
-Yeah!

270
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,540
Speaking of that jacket..
I know she..

271
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:39,000
I know she's not the one 
who created it, but she sews at the factory.

272
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,800
I met her when I was in Asia.

273
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,220
You look so cool!
-Thank you.

274
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,920
<i>[I like that you're standing there looking at me.]</i>

275
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,640
<i>[You actually hate parties, don't you?]</i>

276
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,560
<i>[I don't HATE it.]</i>

277
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,740
<i>[We don't have to be here.]</i>

278
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,620
<i>[Go to your house and chill?]</i>

279
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,940
<i>[No. That's not what I want.]</i>

280
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:45,160
<i>[What do you want?]</i>

281
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,780
Chris. Out.

282
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,080
Are you serious now?

283
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,260
Out. Now.

284
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,980
Bro!

285
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,360
I know I should ask you
if you're ready, but I don't care now.

286
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,380
So shut up.

287
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,500
Oh my god!
Kasper!

288
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,280
Kasper!

289
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,520
Is there no life here?!

290
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,100
I think I did something stupid.

291
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,660
What do you mean?

292
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:32,520
I sent a message to the Yakuza guy.

293
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:42,000
I knew you were going to do it.

294
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,620
You're not mad?

295
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,340
I would have done the same.

296
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,860
What will Eskild and Linn
say when you tell them you're moving out?

297
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,540
I'm scared to say it.
You have to say it.

298
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,800
Okay.

299
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,720
My god, it'll go well for sure.

300
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,880
They just have to find
someone else who can live in the room.

301
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,880
Oh, cool belt!

302
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,340
Is it?

303
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:15,300
Are you taking the credit for that belt?

304
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,360
Is it yours?
-Yes, it's Isak's.

305
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,000
Ah, I see.

306
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,340
All his coolest clothes are actually mine.

307
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
SKAM LOVES YOU
