My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

When I was a child I saw my
mother killed by something impossible.

3

My father went to prison for her murder.

Then an accident made me the impossible.

To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

00:00:20,073 --> 00:00:22,903
but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime

7
00:00:22,905 --> 00:00:24,839
and find others like me.

8
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:27,276
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

Mom!

10
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:28,873

The kind I have to keep.

18

Before the lightning bolt, if I
wasn't still at the crime lab,

00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:04,921
I'd be at home chilling,

The lightning didn't just give me speed.

00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:51,017
When I was a kid, my grandfather used to

163
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:54,656
take my sister and me
to this diner, the motorcar.

164
00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:57,828
Food was for crap, but the view was great,

165
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,166
right across from
the Central City precinct.

166
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:03,634
I still go there. I listen to their radios.

167
00:08:03,636 --> 00:08:06,334
I learn their response times.

168
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:08,170
There are 40 banks in Central City,

169
00:08:08,172 --> 00:08:10,974
each of them within 60 seconds
of police response.

170
00:08:10,976 --> 00:08:15,076
That's the advantage
of hitting a moving target.

171
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,978
Once the armored car called 911,

172
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,085
we had 182 seconds before
any cop could be on the scene.

173
00:08:21,087 --> 00:08:25,323
No one could have gotten there
fast enough to stop us.

174
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:29,194
But something did,

175
00:08:29,196 --> 00:08:31,994
and you lost your cool.

177

unless it's the only option.

00:15:02,914 --> 00:15:05,484
Uh, yum.

325
00:15:05,486 --> 00:15:06,954
You know what, I'm gonna go call work,

326
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:08,856
check in, make sure everything's okay.

327
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:12,860
I'll be back in a second.

328
00:15:12,862 --> 00:15:14,729
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

329
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:16,130
The trivia night with you and Eddie,

330
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:18,069
forcing this whole double date thing.

331
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:20,272
Because that girl is great,

332
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:23,043
and she happens to come
from your very rare species

333
00:15:23,045 --> 00:15:25,445
of adorable nerds.

334
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:27,717
Why didn't you tell me more about her?

335
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,219
There's nothing to tell.

336
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:30,722
She's just a friend.

337
00:15:30,724 --> 00:15:32,894
Barry, girls don't just hop on trains

338
00:15:32,896 --> 00:15:34,230
and travel hundreds of miles

339
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:36,397
to see someone that they don't like.

340
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,730
See, this is why you need my help.

341
00:15:38,732 --> 00:15:39,965
Bring her tonight.

342
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:42,733
We'll have fun.

343
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:45,471
Yeah, fun.

344
00:15:49,778 --> 00:15:51,443
You wanted state of the art, Snart.

345
00:15:51,445 --> 00:15:53,545
I bring you state of the art, my good sir.

346
00:15:53,547 --> 00:15:56,047
- What's this?
- It might not look like much,

347
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:58,547
but never judge a book
by its cover, you know?

348
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:01,585
Fires highly concentrated,
combustible liquid fuel

349
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,722
that ignites on contact with the air.

350
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:05,757
I don't need to heat things up.

351
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,996
I need to slow them down.

352
00:16:09,998 --> 00:16:11,163
That's the one, then.

353
00:16:11,165 --> 00:16:12,965
You were drawn right to it.

354
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:16,437
Stolen from S.T.A.R. Labs
after the incident,

355
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:18,339
and with nothing
but a skeleton security crew

356
00:16:18,341 --> 00:16:20,673
to guard the tech inside.

357

I'm not sure what it is.

358
00:16:23,814 --> 00:16:27,184
Like a white flame,
but it's not hot, it's cold.

359
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,718

of the same tech.

360
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,288
What are they for?

361
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,390
The glare. You'll see.

362
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,726
Who else knows you took this?

363
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,731
Just us.

364
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:41,035
No, just me.

365
00:16:41,037 --> 00:16:43,036
Sorry, pal.

366
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,670
Party people, who's ready
to get their trivia on?

[Applause and cheering]

368
00:16:57,471 --> 00:16:59,272
Okay, everybody, welcome.
We've got some new challengers.

369
00:16:59,274 --> 00:17:04,278
Please, welcome e=mc Hammer.

370
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:07,347
No, you see, I did it because E=mc squared

371
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:10,185
is Einstein's formula
for kinetic energy, right?

372
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:12,455
And, you know, <i>can't touch this.</i>

373
00:17:12,457 --> 00:17:14,392
That's great, Barry.

374
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:16,462
So where is Felicity?

375
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:17,831
I'm not sure.

376
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,002
I told her it started at...

377
00:17:23,606 --> 00:17:25,509
Feel free to buy yourself that dress.

378
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,348
[Laughs] I totally overdressed
for trivia night.

379
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,184
No, you look amazing.

380
00:17:32,186 --> 00:17:35,156

That's funny.

383
00:17:39,328 --> 00:17:42,763
See?

384
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:44,998
It wasn't until 1852,

385
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,635
when the transcontinental
railroad laid their tracks

386
00:17:47,637 --> 00:17:49,373
through this thriving cattle town,

387
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,775
that we became officially incorporated.

388
00:17:51,777 --> 00:17:55,315
That same year, the worst flood
this area's ever seen hit.

389
00:17:55,317 --> 00:17:59,455
But from that disaster rose
Central City's greatest hero,

390
00:17:59,457 --> 00:18:03,093
cattle rancher Bobby “Bovine” McFeely.

391
00:18:03,095 --> 00:18:07,198
Bovine McFeely saved 17 cows
from the great flood.

392
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,470
Hey, kid. Gum?

393
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:20,645
And now, for the exhibit

394
00:18:20,647 --> 00:18:22,849
I'm sure you've all come here to see,

395
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:26,851
the historic Kahndaq dynasty diamond.

396
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:28,455
Be careful. Get too close

397
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:30,925
and you'll set off the proximity alarms.

398
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:33,227
Wouldn't want to do that.

- Mm-mm.

00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:49,375
Three is Erdel, and four is Pasteur.

404
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:51,778
- Right.
- Five?

405
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,812
Both: Descartes.

406
00:18:52,814 --> 00:18:54,844
Are they even speaking English?

407
00:18:54,846 --> 00:19:00,617
And the points go to E=mc Hammer.

408
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:03,752
I knew you two would make a good team.

409
00:19:03,754 --> 00:19:05,620
So, Felicity, what do you do?

410
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:06,922
I work in computer sciences

411
00:19:06,924 --> 00:19:09,222
- at Queen Consolidated.
- Really?

412
00:19:09,224 --> 00:19:12,726
Do you have a boyfriend in Starling City?

413
00:19:12,728 --> 00:19:16,497
No, no, there is no one.

414
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:17,830
I'll get us some more drinks.

415
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:19,430
And I had too many of those first ones,

416
00:19:19,432 --> 00:19:21,600
so I will be right back.

417
00:19:29,776 --> 00:19:31,477
- What?
- Dude.

418
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:33,412
Dude? Wha...

419
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:35,848
Are you still gonna tell me
that she's not into you?

420
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,885
Look at that dress.

421
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:39,454
And when I asked her
the boyfriend question,

422
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:40,957
she froze.

423
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:43,359
Yeah, you were
particularly sly with that one.

424
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:46,894
Felicity is smart, nice, and pretty.

425
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:49,097
And most importantly, she is the first girl

She's perfect for you,

so what are you waiting for, Barry?

431
00:20:04,648 --> 00:20:06,916
How long has it been missing?

432
00:20:06,918 --> 00:20:10,621
I don't know.

433
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,623
I'm gonna ask you again, Cisco.

434
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,389
But when I do,

435
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:18,395
I expect a more specific answer
than “I don't know.”

436
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:23,870
Now, how long has this weapon been gone?

437
00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:26,509
A day, maybe two.

438

show up for work this morning.

He was probably the one who took it.

I didn't think that...

You didn't think,

442
00:20:36,657 --> 00:20:40,027
because if you had, you would
have discussed with me

something that could,

You know how I feel about weapons, Cisco.

- You okay?
- Ahh, aah, it burns.

489
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:31,013
Time for a test run.

490
00:23:31,015 --> 00:23:33,949
Let's see how fast you are.

491
00:23:38,756 --> 00:23:39,922
Gah!

No!

494
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:09,592
No.

495
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,816
It's still numb.

496
00:24:22,818 --> 00:24:24,686
It's presenting itself
like third degree frostbite.

497
00:24:24,688 --> 00:24:26,190
I thought he had hyper healing.

498
00:24:26,192 --> 00:24:27,728
It's been slowed.

499
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,296
If your cells weren't
regenerating at the rate

500
00:24:29,298 --> 00:24:31,798
they are, your blood vessels
would have frozen solid

501
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,769
and the nerve damage
would have been permanent.

502
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:35,105
You're lucky to be alive.

503
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:37,240
Snart wasn't another meta-human.

504
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,474
He has some kind of gun.

505
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,909
It froze things, slowed me down...

506
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:44,279
Enough that I wasn't in time
to save someone.

507
00:24:44,281 --> 00:24:45,815
According to his record,

508
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,449
Snart didn't even bother
to finish high school,

509
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:51,152
so how did he build a handheld
high tech snow machine?

510
00:24:51,154 --> 00:24:53,354
S.T.A.R. Labs built the cold gun.

511
00:24:53,356 --> 00:24:58,157
Dr. Wells and Caitlin
had nothing to do with this.

512
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,160
I built the gun.

513
00:25:02,162 --> 00:25:04,497
You did?

514
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:05,732
Why?

515
00:25:05,734 --> 00:25:08,870
Because speed and cold are opposites.

516
00:25:08,872 --> 00:25:10,437
Temperature is measured

517
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:12,572
by how quickly the atoms
of something are oscillating.

518
00:25:12,574 --> 00:25:14,441
The faster they are, the hotter it is,

519
00:25:14,443 --> 00:25:17,143
and when then are cold, they're
slower on the atomic level.

520
00:25:17,145 --> 00:25:19,448
When there's no movement at all,
it's called...

521
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,951
Absolute zero.

522
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,617
Yeah.

523
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:29,293
I designed a compact cryo engine
to achieve absolute zero.

524
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:31,527
I built it to stop you.

525
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,665
I didn't know who you were then, Barry.

526
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:37,434
I mean, what if you turned out
to be some psycho,

527
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:38,668
like Mardon or Nimbus?

528
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,237
But I didn't. Did I?

529
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:45,241
We built the entire structure
you're standing in to do good,

530
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,708
and it blew up.

531
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,944
In the wake of that,
you can understand why Cisco

532
00:25:48,946 --> 00:25:50,746
would want to be prepared for the worst.

533
00:25:50,748 --> 00:25:53,050
I can understand that,
but what I can't understand

534
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,920
is why you didn't tell me what you did.

535
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:57,455
I mean, after all we've been through,

536
00:25:57,457 --> 00:25:58,822
I thought you trusted me.

537
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:00,856
- I thought we were friends.
- We are, Barry.

538
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:02,693
I mean, if you would have just told me,

539
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:04,562
I could have been prepared.

540
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:06,764
But instead, someone died tonight.

541
00:26:09,336 --> 00:26:11,705
And I have to live with that.

542
00:26:11,707 --> 00:26:15,911
No, Cisco. We all do.

00:26:37,905 --> 00:26:40,037
Yes, now.

552
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,840
You did the same thing
when I tried to sign up

553
00:26:41,842 --> 00:26:43,776
for the police academy without telling you.

554
00:26:43,778 --> 00:26:45,578
You didn't speak to me for weeks...

555
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,548
Not until I withdrew my application.

556
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,087
Well, I am not withdrawing this time, dad.

557
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:52,524
I am dating Eddie
whether you like it or not.

558
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:54,326
- Eddie's my partner.
- I know.

559
00:26:54,328 --> 00:26:55,895
But you don't. You're not a cop.

560
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:58,396
You don't know what having a partner means.

561
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:01,334
Wherever I go, he goes,

562
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:04,605
and where I go isn't always safe, Iris.

563
00:27:04,607 --> 00:27:08,243
I need to be 100% focused.

564
00:27:08,245 --> 00:27:11,651
Now, there's a part
of me that isn't focused,

565
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:13,619
that doesn't see Eddie as my partner,

566
00:27:13,621 --> 00:27:15,887
but as your boyfriend.

567
00:27:15,889 --> 00:27:19,389
So if he gets hurt or worse,

568
00:27:19,391 --> 00:27:21,392
and I'm there,

569
00:27:21,394 --> 00:27:23,496
how am I gonna look at you?

570
00:27:23,498 --> 00:27:26,566
How you gonna look at me?

571
00:27:26,568 --> 00:27:29,269
Now, I'm not mad at you,

572
00:27:29,271 --> 00:27:34,174
but that's why this is so hard for me.

573
00:27:34,176 --> 00:27:36,209
Do you understand?

574
00:27:40,048 --> 00:27:41,548
We're going back tonight.

575
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,982
- Back where?
- To the museum.

576
00:27:42,984 --> 00:27:45,019
That diamond isn't going to steal itself.

Super gun freeze your brain, Snart?

578
00:27:47,126 --> 00:27:48,992
The museum's gonna
be crawling with police by now,

579
00:27:48,994 --> 00:27:50,826
- and The Streak.
- This can stop The Streak.

580
00:27:50,828 --> 00:27:53,498
It hurt him, and I know his real weakness.

581
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,500
So we go, unless you want out.

582
00:27:56,502 --> 00:28:00,038
We both want out... Alive.

583
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,905
So you thought ahead and made a plan.

584
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:06,578
Least I taught you something.

585
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,348
So what are you waiting for?

586
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,318
Shoot me.

587
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,554
You better put a bullet
in my brain right now,

588
00:28:13,556 --> 00:28:15,356
because if you don't,

589
00:28:15,358 --> 00:28:17,957
if I ever see either one of you again...

590
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:20,256
You don't get it, do you?

591
00:28:20,258 --> 00:28:22,592
This blur is out there,

592
00:28:22,594 --> 00:28:25,725
and Central City ain't
your playground anymore.

593
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:33,161
Sure, it is.

00:28:42,535 --> 00:28:45,834
Barry.

596
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:48,806
What? What are you doing?

597
00:28:48,808 --> 00:28:51,074
You should go back to your hotel.

598
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:53,612
- Get some sleep.
- You should too.

599
00:28:53,614 --> 00:28:56,848
Not go back to my hotel...
I meant get some sleep.

600
00:29:00,755 --> 00:29:02,487
I can't.

601
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:04,955
Every time I close my eyes,
I see that man's face.

602
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,697
I watched him die.

603
00:29:12,766 --> 00:29:15,969
I have to go faster.

604
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:18,839
Barry, it's not your fault.

605
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:20,407
And it's not Cisco's, either.

606
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:21,943
Barry, I know you're upset,

607
00:29:21,945 --> 00:29:25,382
but you have to look at this
from his point of view.

608
00:29:25,384 --> 00:29:27,318
No, I get it.

609
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,019
He didn't trust me.

610
00:29:29,021 --> 00:29:32,091
Barry, when you met us...
Me, Oliver, and Dig...

611
00:29:32,093 --> 00:29:35,130
We were this well-oiled archery machine.

612
00:29:35,132 --> 00:29:37,401
But it didn't start out that way.

613
00:29:37,403 --> 00:29:39,639
And unlike you guys, we weren't
tossed together overnight.

614
00:29:39,641 --> 00:29:42,710
We came together one at a time.

615
00:29:42,712 --> 00:29:44,481
Believe me, it took much more
than watching Oliver

616
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:47,219
do the salmon ladder to make me trust him.

617

[Scoffs]

618
00:29:59,268 --> 00:30:04,869
I've seen firsthand
what this life can do to people.

619
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:06,840
It's a lonely path.

620
00:30:06,842 --> 00:30:10,673
Don't make it any
lonelier than it has to be.

621

622

You want to end up like that door?

623
00:30:35,421 --> 00:30:38,057
Hi there.

624
00:30:39,862 --> 00:30:42,032
I figured out a way to track Captain Cold.

625
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:43,901
You gotta stop naming these guys.

626
00:30:43,903 --> 00:30:47,404
- Barry, listen to him.
- How?

627
00:30:47,406 --> 00:30:50,509
The cold gun is powered
by an engine control unit,

628
00:30:50,511 --> 00:30:52,949
a microcomputer that regulates
air-to-fuel ratios

629
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,250
so the sub-cooled fluid

630
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,287
in the chambers don't overflow and...

631
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:58,021
- Explode.
- Right.

632
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:01,390
This E.C.U. was receiving updates
wirelessly from my tablet.

633
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:04,260
If I boost the signal
using Central City's network

634
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,527
and send a false update,

635
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:06,960
we'll get a ping back, and then...

636
00:31:06,962 --> 00:31:09,528
We can locate Snart.

637
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,029
How long will it take?

638
00:31:11,031 --> 00:31:12,698
First I have to hack
into the City's network,

639
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,667
so I don't know, 30 minutes, maybe?

640
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:16,368
I can do it in less than one.

641
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,369
When it comes to hacking,
I'm the fastest woman alive.

642
00:31:18,371 --> 00:31:22,141
Ow! That was not as badass as I pictured.

643
00:31:24,446 --> 00:31:25,781
All right, I'm in.

644
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,115
Are you kidding?

645
00:31:27,117 --> 00:31:29,884
All right, I'm sending the updates.

646
00:31:29,886 --> 00:31:31,218
We're connected.

Network is triangulating the location.

We got him. He's heading west on Nelson

649
00:31:35,522 --> 00:31:37,286
toward the train station.

650
00:31:37,288 --> 00:31:39,822
If he's leaving, it appears
Mr. Snart may have gotten

651
00:31:39,824 --> 00:31:42,760
what he came for.

652
00:31:42,762 --> 00:31:44,529
When we put our minds to it,

653
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:46,964
dude, nothing can stop us.

654
00:31:46,966 --> 00:31:48,967
Oh, you turned your ear piece off.

655
00:31:48,969 --> 00:31:51,138
How are we gonna talk to each other?

656
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,675
I don't feel like talking right now.

We got Snart.

659
00:32:05,697 --> 00:32:08,466
- Wait here for back up.
- Wait for back up? No way.

660
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,235
That's an order.

661
00:32:12,672 --> 00:32:15,541
- You should go after Barry.
- You heard him, Felicity.

662
00:32:15,543 --> 00:32:16,976
He wants to do this alone.

663
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,377
Of course, he said that.

664
00:32:18,379 --> 00:32:19,612
He's hurt.

665
00:32:19,614 --> 00:32:21,347
You're his team and his friends.

If I had a nickel for every time
The Arrow told me to back off,

667
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,616
I would be as rich as Oliver Queen,

who I mention because he's
the richest person I know,

or used to be.

670
00:32:30,056 --> 00:32:32,593
The point is,

671
00:32:32,595 --> 00:32:35,127
you have your partner's back

672
00:32:35,129 --> 00:32:39,033
no matter what.

673
00:32:39,035 --> 00:32:42,536
I have something that might help.

[Gunshot]

I'm your partner, not your assistant.

00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:14,901
There's nowhere to run.

677
00:33:14,903 --> 00:33:16,569
I didn't see you before.

678
00:33:16,571 --> 00:33:19,875
Your mom know you're out past your bedtime?

679
00:33:19,877 --> 00:33:22,079
If you wanted to get away
you should've taken something

680
00:33:22,081 --> 00:33:23,682
faster than a train.

681
00:33:23,684 --> 00:33:26,449
That's if I wanted to get away.

682
00:33:26,451 --> 00:33:29,385
I've seen your weakness at the armored car,

683
00:33:29,387 --> 00:33:31,021
then at the theater.

684
00:33:31,023 --> 00:33:33,723
See, while you're busy saving everybody,

685
00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:36,327
I'll be saving myself.

686
00:33:49,913 --> 00:33:52,382
Good luck with that.

00:34:31,062 --> 00:34:32,496
Ahh!

00:34:32,864 --> 00:34:35,632
Pretty fast, kid,

689
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:38,236
but not fast enough.

690

Thank you.

691
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,966
For what?

692
00:34:47,968 --> 00:34:50,170
You forced me to up my game,

00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:51,372
not only with this gun,

694
00:34:51,374 --> 00:34:53,973
but with how I think about the job.

695
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:55,574
It's been educational.

I was wondering who you were talking to.

Hey, unless you want a taste

I'd back the hell up.

We'll find him, Cisco, together.

You have a great team here, Barry.

Speaking of teams, I should
probably get back to mine.

but maybe that's not such a bad thing.

What is wrong with us?

776
00:40:14,785 --> 00:40:18,084
We are perfectly perfect for each other.

Yet we're sitting here,
pining for people we can't have.

778
00:40:22,124 --> 00:40:24,956
I guess what they say is true.

779

Opposites do attract.

but I will still come.

Whoo-hoo!

I know it's been a while
since we pulled that job.

788
00:41:22,678 --> 00:41:25,410
I know it didn't go so well for you,

789
00:41:25,412 --> 00:41:27,146
and I know I said we were finished.

790
00:41:27,148 --> 00:41:28,748
But things have changed.

791
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,549
If I want to keep working in Central City,

792
00:41:30,551 --> 00:41:33,254
I'm gonna need a new kind of crew.

You're tolerant of extremes.

795
00:41:37,426 --> 00:41:40,025
You have certain skills.

796
00:41:40,027 --> 00:41:44,366
You just need some direction.

00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:47,567
And I can give that to you.

798
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:50,173
You still like playing with fire?
