1
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:16,935
I thought we had a truce.

2
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,355
I thought as much.

3
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:23,733
Your bravery strengthened
by the reassurance you gain

4
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:24,984
from enhanced healing.

5
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:27,153
Oh, it doesn't mean it hurts any less.

6
00:00:27,654 --> 00:00:31,866
Pain is the debt we pay for change,
and I'm here to change the future.

7
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:34,160
Thanks to this experiment,

8
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:37,413
I now know the force required
to kill you when the time comes.

9
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:38,705
Oh.

10
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:40,833
I've seen your destiny, Flash.

11
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:45,129
I've watched you use your power
to destroy everything and everyone.

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:49,467
You still haven't told me
why I would do this. Huh?

13
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:54,138
What would cause me to turn my back
on everything I've sworn to protect?

14
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:55,974
Madness.

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,353
Many times in the past,

16
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:02,730
the pain you suffered
nearly crushed you.

17
00:01:03,356 --> 00:01:05,650
But soon, a new despair will befall you

18
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:10,238
and it will create
an unbroken chain of sorrow so great,

19
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:13,157
your mind will crack.

20
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:16,411
And with it, the world ends.

21
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:22,709
You see, your power
has recently accelerated,

22
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:26,713
but so too has your ability
to descend into madness.

23
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:29,841
Tragedy is coming for you, Flash.

24
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:34,012
What remains to be seen
isn't whether or not you break,

25
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:35,138
it's when.

26
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:36,973
I have seven days.

27
00:01:37,557 --> 00:01:40,393
I'd worry more about tomorrow,
if I were you.

28
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,937
I don't know the details
of what will happen,

29
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:46,107
but I know tomorrow
is the beginning of the end.

30
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:48,151
Your end.

31
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:52,196
I've granted you a chance
to defy destiny.

32
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:55,158
But I'll be staying close by.

33
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:59,704
As soon as I sense
your mind turning mad,

34
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:02,290
I'll find you.

35
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:07,253
Good luck fighting fate, Flash.

36
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:14,761
<i>I'll be watching.</i>

37
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,346
<i>I'll be watching.</i>

38
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:17,804
<i>I'll be watching.</i>

39
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:19,891
<i>I'll be watching.</i>

40
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:50,129
<i>Okay. Uplink to the Tower
mainframe is secure.</i>

41
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:52,382
<i>You now have access
to our alien database...</i>

42
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:55,218
<i>...including any intel
we have on this Despero.</i>

43
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:56,761
We appreciate you helping, Alex.

44
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:58,554
How long will it take to download?

45
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:00,407
<i>Well, this new algorithm
works at light speed.</i>

46
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:01,599
<i>In fact, Caitlin,</i>

47
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:03,768
<i>that guy, Marcus,
that I connected you with,</i>

48
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:05,351
<i>he designed it.</i>

49
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:08,231
If the world's still here in a week,
I'll be sure and give him a call.

50
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:12,652
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, guys, I'll keep digging
and see what I can find out.</i>

51
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:16,155
<i>But if this Despero
has managed to stay off of our grid,</i>

52
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,492
<i>then he is a greater threat
than any alien we faced.</i>

53
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:20,951
<i>Keep your guard up.</i>

54
00:03:21,494 --> 00:03:24,706
Well, you heard her.
We have to protect Barry.

55
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,833
There's no way
he would destroy the world.

56
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:28,084
What if he's right?

57
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:30,545
I mean, look, we all saw

58
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,628
how a massive boost of speed
affected Barry before.

59
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:35,508
Oh, crap. You're right.
Remember the ASF?

60
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:38,845
He gained speed thinking
but as a result...

61
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:40,179
I turned on the people I love.

62
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:45,560
Look, uh...
that's not gonna happen this time.

63
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:49,522
But, Barry, what if you
just leveled up too much, too fast?

64
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:51,524
Barry isn't a threat to us.

65
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:54,360
Despero is and his story doesn't add up.

66
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:56,529
I mean, come on.
Doesn't anyone else think it's weird

67
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:59,073
that an alien cares so much about Earth?

68
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:00,616
He's not even from here.

69
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,077
Wherever he's from, here's what we know.

70
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:06,706
I ran a bio scan on Despero
the minute he entered S.T.A.R. Labs.

71
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:09,333
His anatomy is unlike anything
I've ever studied before.

72
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:13,087
He has strength and invulnerability
that rivals Kryptonians.

73
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:16,299
How are we gonna stop him
from killing you?

74
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,382
Prove him wrong.

75
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:20,762
Despero says tomorrow,
my mind starts to break.

76
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:24,390
So all we have to do
is make it through the next 24 hours

77
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:27,226
without that happening,
and he'll have to back down.

78
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:28,811
I like that plan.

79
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:30,646
Let's get some rest.

80
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,375
Tomorrow, we'll need
to be on the lookout for anything.

81
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:37,862
And if something does happen,
then we need to be ready to stop it.

82
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,865
Protecting this city
is still our top priority.

83
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,283
Even from you?

84
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,289
It won't come to that. I promise.

85
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,336
These are the bio scans
Caity did on Despero's brain.

86
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:55,630
Study them and let's
figure out a way to stop him.

87
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:56,671
Oh, I heard that.

88
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,842
I was already planning
on pulling an all-nighter.

89
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:00,027
You know, I was thinking maybe

90
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:02,428
we can find a way to restrain him or...

91
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:05,181
I'm not talking about restraining him.

92
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,311
Look, we need to level up our offense.

93
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:12,355
And I'm not talking about
some containment unit

94
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:16,400
like we did with Bloodwork
or taking out his lair with an EMP.

95
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:20,154
We need to hit him hard.

96
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:24,659
You're... You're asking me
to build a weapon.

97
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:30,540
Frost, I've never built something
to hurt someone before.

98
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,210
Think of it this way.

99
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:38,548
You're gonna help save Barry's life
whatever it takes.

100
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:58,216
Couldn't sleep, either?

101
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:01,737
Something bad
is supposed to happen today.

102
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:04,073
All I keep thinking about is you.

103
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,490
I'll be fine.

104
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:07,785
We can't take any chances.

105
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:11,956
I promise I have a very safe
and boring day planned.

106
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,935
Cecile's working on a big case.

107
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,628
So, after some work, I'm gonna
stop by and help her with Jenna.

108
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:21,215
They both have been having
a pretty hard time lately.

109
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:25,803
Iris, if anything happens to you...

110
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:28,472
Hey, baby, we're gonna be okay.

111
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,894
Look, how many times
in how many timelines

112
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:34,270
have we found each other?

113
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:37,148
Doesn't matter what
anybody says about your fate.

114
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,818
Our destiny is to be together.

115
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:57,585
C.C.P.D.

116
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,300
Allen, just in time.

117
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,550
How bad is it?

118
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,971
Just your typical "makes no sense"
bank robbery in Central City.

119
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:11,474
No one's hurt,
but the on-duty security guard

120
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:14,268
is being hospitalized
for some sort of breakdown.

121
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:15,937
Wait. Like a mental breakdown?

122
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,772
The witnesses said
the guy lost his mind,

123
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,106
and started babbling nonsense.

124
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,945
Then he fired his weapon into the air
and everyone ran out.

125
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,405
By the time anyone got back inside,

126
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:28,950
the vault was empty
and the guard was stark raving mad.

127
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:31,077
It took four officers to restrain him.

128
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:32,912
I'm on it.

129
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:36,707
Allen, I need you to stand down.

130
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:39,853
What, is Gibson working the case?
I'll... I'll just help him investigate.

131
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,296
I need you to turn in your badge.
You've been suspended.

132
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:46,217
- What?
- I just came from the mayor's office.

133
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,220
You're under investigation
for federal crimes.

134
00:07:51,973 --> 00:07:53,683
Your badge, Allen, now.

135
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:17,873
<i>You're
under investigation for federal crimes.</i>

136
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:19,583
<i>Your badge, Allen.</i>

137
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,188
Allen, I know this must be a shock.

138
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:43,733
Captain, hold on.
What... What am I supposed to have done?

139
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:46,569
Two years ago, Joseph Carver

140
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,988
had a mole
manipulating evidence at C.C.P.D.

141
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,657
Yeah. Millie Rawlins aka Sunshine.
We caught her.

142
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:59,498
And the DA was reviewing her case
as a part of an internal audit.

143
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:03,044
Now, I don't know what exactly,
but he also found new evidence

144
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:06,922
that points to Carver
having a second inside man. You.

145
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,011
That's crazy.

146
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:13,846
I mean, why would I help Joseph Carver?

147
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,473
That's for the DA to suss out.

148
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:19,560
I'm sorry. It's above my pay grade.
Now please leave the scene.

149
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,437
I have to find out what happened here.

150
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:24,273
I mean, I think you'd have
other concerns right now.

151
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:25,356
I just...

152
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,235
Korber said a guard lost his mind.

153
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,380
What if that happens to
somebody else?

154
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:30,445
People could get hurt.

155
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,866
Look, Captain,
I know you only have my word,

156
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,577
but you got to believe me,
I'm innocent.

157
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,246
So, please, just let me do my job.

158
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:42,583
If Joe were here right now,

159
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,252
he'd say I should learn
from last year and keep an open mind.

160
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,550
Which is why I promise you,
I will get to the bottom of this

161
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:52,802
and find out the truth.

162
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:57,014
But until I do, I'm sorry, Allen,
you have to leave.

163
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,566
This is insane.
Your C.C.P.D. record is stellar.

164
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,069
Everyone knows that Rawlins
was nothing but Carver's lackey.

165
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,279
Can you find out what evidence
they have against me?

166
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:14,615
Oh, Barry, I'm gonna do
a hell a lot more than that.

167
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,283
I am about to slap C.C.P.D.

168
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:19,161
with the biggest wrongful termination
lawsuit this city has ever seen.

169
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:22,164
I am gonna bleed them dry
for doing this to you.

170
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,959
Are you feeling all right?

171
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:30,171
No.

172
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:37,805
I'm sorry. It's just been hard lately.

173
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,183
I mean, you know why.

174
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:50,733
What's wrong?

175
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:53,821
We're not alone in here.

176
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,450
I can feel another presence
in this room.

177
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,668
Why are you here?

178
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:08,836
I'm not.

179
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:12,423
This is a psychic manifestation
of my consciousness.

180
00:11:13,215 --> 00:11:14,383
Appearing only to you

181
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:17,595
in order to assess
your mental stability.

182
00:11:18,596 --> 00:11:21,515
Barry, who are you talking to?

183
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:27,938
There's nothing wrong with my mind.

184
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,066
That's him, isn't it? Despero?

185
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,236
Your mind is suffering
due to this tragedy.

186
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:36,487
But, no,

187
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,574
it hasn't broken...

188
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:41,826
yet.

189
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:52,546
His energy...
his energy, it felt like...

190
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:58,219
the whole room was flooded
and we were both drowning.

191
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,679
Well, Despero's watching me now,

192
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,265
waiting for the proof
he needs to kill me.

193
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,268
Are you sure he is not
what drives you insane?

194
00:12:06,352 --> 00:12:08,145
No. I'm not.

195
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:12,733
But I do think there's another
explanation for what's happening.

196
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:17,321
Korber said a security guard
at this morning's robbery lost his mind.

197
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:19,240
That can't be a coincidence. Not today.

198
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:20,741
No. It has to be connected

199
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,952
to what Despero said
happens in the future.

200
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,037
I need to talk to that guard.

201
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:58,570
Xotar.

202
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:05,744
Xotar. Xotar. Xotar.

203
00:13:07,705 --> 00:13:08,747
Xotar!

204
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:15,254
Xotar.

205
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,214
Xotar.

206
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,195
Caitlin, hey, good timing.
I think I've got a clue

207
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,155
to run through the S.T.A.R. Labs
search satellites.

208
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,307
<i>Barry, we need you here right now.</i>

209
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,684
The city is shutting down S.T.A.R. Labs.

210
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:32,938
Okay, lock this place down.
I want that radiation leak found.

211
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,690
Get here fast.

212
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:37,358
Xotar.

213
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:43,282
Xotar. Xotar. Xotar.

214
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:54,251
You can't just come in here
and kick us out of our own offices.

215
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,628
Public Safety Act?

216
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:57,796
Passed four years ago

217
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,007
after the meta fallout
nearly took out the city.

218
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,760
Means we can do whatever
we have to do for the greater good.

219
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,595
Post teams at every entrance.

220
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,972
- No one gets in without clearance.
- Right away.

221
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,475
Excuse me. I'm Barry Allen.

222
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:10,851
I own this facility.

223
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:13,354
Mr. Allen, we've detected
dangerous levels

224
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,647
of radiation within your facility.

225
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:18,442
This lab's a day away from a meltdown.

226
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,568
That's impossible.

227
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,612
We would have noticed
if things were that bad.

228
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,113
Uh, maybe not.

229
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,240
I just checked out the safety logs.

230
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:28,077
Our radiation scanners
haven't updated in over a week.

231
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,954
It doesn't make any sense.

232
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What happened?

233
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,795
This is part of our
early detection array

234
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,963
that monitors radiation levels
inside the place.

235
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:41,423
But it's corroding.

236
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,442
It hasn't been functioning for a while.

237
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:46,136
Sensors in the subterranean power core

238
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,555
currently read over a thousand rads.

239
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,308
Consider yourselves lucky.

240
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:55,145
Another day, you'd all be in ICU.
Seal off that power core.

241
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,145
Yes, sir.

242
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,958
And get an external
containment team, stat.

243
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,149
What kind of containment?

244
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,944
We need to construct
a concrete and steel encasement

245
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:03,487
around this entire facility

246
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,656
in order to contain
the radioactive material.

247
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,199
Then we'll demolish S.T.A.R. Labs

248
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,576
and move the debris
to a nuclear waste site.

249
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,120
You're gonna demolish it?

250
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:14,748
Safety board makes the final call.
This looks pretty bad.

251
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,419
Now, gather your people and say goodbye.

252
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:21,505
You got five minutes
to make like a banana and split.

253
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,550
Fan out and search all levels
for additional leaks.

254
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:26,259
Excuse me.

255
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:31,432
Okay. This place is already
swarming with city workers.

256
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:32,875
If they get to the inner levels...

257
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,393
They'll find out it's Flash HQ.

258
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,186
Aka our home base.

259
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,789
That's why I need you to grab
what you're able to,

260
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:41,275
conceal the lab's critical areas
and get out as fast as you can.

261
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,121
Hello, Barry Allen.

262
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:57,082
Gideon, can you pull up the controls
for the holographic emitters

263
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,333
and set them to manual?

264
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:00,377
Understood. Preparing task.

265
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,254
What do you need, Ches P?

266
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,096
Where are you?

267
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:13,640
Yes.

268
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:16,810
Instruction set received.
Holographic emitters reconfigured.

269
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:17,894
Initiate.

270
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,069
Must be old plans.

271
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,347
All clear.

272
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,589
Okay, let's head back.

273
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:06,610
<i>Sequence complete.</i>

274
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,571
However, Team Flash data
on internal servers

275
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,907
will compromise your identity
if discovered.

276
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,326
Standing by for emergency data wipe.

277
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,911
Gideon, is there any other way?

278
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,412
No, Barry Allen.

279
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:19,289
All information within S.T.A.R. Labs

280
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,542
must be erased
in order to assure your safety.

281
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,126
This includes myself.

282
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,962
This is the best option.

283
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:27,422
I'm so sorry, Gideon.

284
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:31,134
It has been an honor working
with you, Barry Allen. Farewell.

285
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:46,149
It has been an honor
working with you, Barry Allen. Farewell.

286
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:58,263
Frost ice-bridged a bunch of stuff
out of here.

287
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:00,007
- She's gonna bring it to Caitlin's.
- Okay.

288
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,038
It's time to go.

289
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:02,874
I can't believe this is happening.

290
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:06,962
This was our home.

291
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,428
This...

292
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:16,847
This is so unreal.

293
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,767
I've spent more time in that lab
than anywhere I've ever lived.

294
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:25,063
Guys, I know how much this hurts,

295
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:28,317
and I know what you're thinking.

296
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,527
But these setbacks aren't proof

297
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,195
that Despero's right about the future.

298
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,990
They're not proof he isn't either.

299
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:37,826
I know, but, I mean,
we gotta have faith.

300
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:41,121
Not just in me, but in each other.

301
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:46,877
Barry, we're with you.

302
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:48,626
I think we all just wished

303
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,590
that there was some other explanation
for all this.

304
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:53,759
I think there is.

305
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,054
Something caused a security guard

306
00:18:57,137 --> 00:19:00,432
to lose his mind
at a bank robbery this morning.

307
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:04,353
Uh, you mean, exactly like what
Despero said would happen to you?

308
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:05,896
This has to be related.

309
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:09,316
I was going to use the S.T.A.R. Labs
satellites to follow a lead.

310
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,568
But luckily, we have someone on our team

311
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:13,779
who is an expert at exposing the truth.

312
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,660
- The Xotar story is priority one.
- Got it.

313
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:23,413
Okay, the word's out.

314
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:26,041
If there's anything
to this "Xotar" lead,

315
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,417
my people will find it.

316
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,213
Despero said I'm gonna
destroy the world.

317
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:37,969
If that's true, I'm the reason
everyone I love is gonna die.

318
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:40,239
Barry, do you remember the last time

319
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:44,393
that something messed with your head
when you had speed thinking?

320
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,688
It was like I was on auto-pilot,
my mind just took over.

321
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,231
Yeah, but you snapped out of it

322
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:51,709
because you saw
that your friends were in danger.

323
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,944
I mean, you could never really hurt us.

324
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:57,572
Even so, if something
does happen to someone I love

325
00:19:57,656 --> 00:20:00,617
because of my leveled up speed,

326
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,578
I don't know how I'd react.

327
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:08,457
It's Taylor.

328
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,711
She found out that "Xotar"

329
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,674
is the name of a meta criminal
in National City.

330
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:13,712
Xotar's a meta?

331
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,340
A psychic meta who controls

332
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:18,343
her victims' minds
and drives them crazy.

333
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,803
You know what this means.

334
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,222
Xotar could be the real reason
I lose my mind today.

335
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,224
And catching her will prevent it.

336
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:25,851
All I have to do is find her.

337
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,066
Xotar...

338
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:36,194
Xotar...

339
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,325
Flash, you found me.

340
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,410
Yes.

341
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,120
Let me guess. You're psychic, too.

342
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:47,164
Not psychic, just patient.

343
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,058
I knew if I ran around the city
long enough,

344
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,322
eventually you'd show yourself.

345
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,919
How very underwhelming and basic of you.

346
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:56,256
So what's next? We fight?

347
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:57,548
How passé.

348
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:00,385
Actually, what do you say we take
a quick trip to Iron Heights?

349
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:13,231
What the hell
is wrong with you?

350
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,275
What's going on?

351
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:23,575
You zooped in out of nowhere
and started destroying the place.

352
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:27,245
- What? No, I...
- You almost lightning-blasted Chuck.

353
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:30,999
I...

354
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:36,505
I don't remember doing any of that.

355
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:54,815
Okay, listen. Hey, I don't know what
just happened, but I didn't do this.

356
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,650
And I'm... I'm not going insane.

357
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:59,027
- Barry, we saw you.
- No way, I...

358
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,589
Dude, she's right. You came in here
all lathered up out of control.

359
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,990
- Allegra had to blast you, man.
- Okay.

360
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:08,203
All right, look, whatever happened,
I can prove I'm myself now.

361
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,497
Or at least Caitlin can.

362
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,044
Cover me.

363
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:30,058
Your amygdala activity
and cortisol levels are elevated.

364
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:33,603
But within normal parameters.

365
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:43,071
Even if you're really you again,

366
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:44,799
it doesn't explain what just happened.

367
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:46,616
Now I know who's responsible for this.

368
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,788
Right before it happened,
I intercepted a meta called Xotar.

369
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:53,540
She controls her victims' minds.

370
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:57,210
What are the odds a meta who commits
telepathic assaults on people

371
00:22:57,294 --> 00:23:00,422
shows up the same day Despero claims
I'm going to lose my mind?

372
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,841
It does make a lot more sense.

373
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:05,844
Okay. We need to find Xotar
and stop this from happening.

374
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:08,096
And keep Despero from killing you.

375
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:11,224
Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, you could scan
for Xotar's energy signature

376
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:14,936
and find her,
but those satellites are blind.

377
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,229
I can search the city.

378
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,398
I found her once, I can find her again.

379
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,861
Frost needs help setting up
a portable med lab at the apartment.

380
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:26,990
Me and Allegra can set up
a comms/Cortex type sitch in my garage.

381
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,868
All right, do it. And look, guys,

382
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:34,539
I know today started with a loss,
but we can end it with a win.

383
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:36,707
We got this.

384
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:53,558
Sorry.

385
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:54,684
Sorry. It's all right.

386
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,145
Search for Xotar all you want.

387
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,941
The answer you're looking for
has been with you all along.

388
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:02,232
Enough.

389
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,945
No more cryptic prophecies.
No more games.

390
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,113
Why do you care so much?

391
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,325
You said yourself,
this isn't your world.

392
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,077
You're hiding something from me.

393
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:15,830
What do you have to gain?

394
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:18,457
A home.

395
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:23,755
I saw my planet, Kalanor,
overrun by evil.

396
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:26,633
I was forced to see the people I love

397
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:28,969
suffer and die
under the fist of a despot.

398
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:33,682
Then I was chosen to lead
a band of rebels attempting a coup.

399
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,395
Both sides suffered heavy losses.

400
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:40,772
But we were triumphant.

401
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:45,110
However, when the time came
to cut the head off the snake...

402
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,698
I chose to spare the oppressor's life.

403
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,537
But my mercy was misguided...

404
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,833
because it allowed
that madman to rise again

405
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,669
and rain down horrors
a thousand times worse.

406
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:06,464
I was spared...

407
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:11,136
because he knew for me,
the only fate worse than death

408
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:13,763
would be losing my home world.

409
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:17,934
So he banished me here.

410
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:21,396
That's how I came to adopt Earth
as my new home,

411
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:23,773
only to watch you destroy it.

412
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:26,901
I've been through a crisis before.

413
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:30,989
Whatever's coming, I can handle it.

414
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,492
Crisis and tragedy
are like fires, Flash.

415
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,704
Some are strong enough to endure them.

416
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:40,915
But others are destined
to be consumed by them.

417
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:44,961
Soon, we'll find out who you are.

418
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:57,223
Okay.

419
00:25:58,099 --> 00:25:59,768
This is the last of your...

420
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,644
Whatever this stuff is.

421
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:03,480
What's this thing?

422
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,230
Uh, nothing.

423
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:11,112
It's just a... a project for Frost.
That's all.

424
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:12,738
Uh-huh.

425
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:16,034
Chuck, you know how we've been
spending more time together lately?

426
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:20,121
Oh, yeah. Our weekend <i>D&D</i> sessions
are like my new favorite thing.

427
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:21,915
Why?

428
00:26:22,874 --> 00:26:25,919
Well, and I can't believe
I'm saying this,

429
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:28,713
but the way you just said "nothing,"

430
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:32,717
is exactly how you sounded
right before the raid on Shavak's tomb.

431
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:35,220
And we all knew
you were bluffing then, too.

432
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,014
Yeah. Okay. Uh...

433
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,144
Frost asked me to build...

434
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:49,067
a weapon to hurt Despero.

435
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,444
But you're...

436
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:55,031
A pacifist. Yeah, I know.

437
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:58,827
How do you feel about doing this?

438
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:00,244
Allegra.

439
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:05,291
You know, I still remember
the exact moment

440
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,836
that I decided to be a pacifist.

441
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:11,673
I was ten.

442
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:17,345
I had just seen
Marvin the Martian's ray gun

443
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:19,848
on the Saturday morning cartoons.

444
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:25,895
So I decided to make one of my own.

445
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:32,777
When I demoed it for my best friend,

446
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:38,074
it malfunctioned and...

447
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:43,496
I burned his parents' house down.

448
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,835
Him and his family
barely made it out alive.

449
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:55,842
After that, I made a vow.

450
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:58,720
No more weapons, no matter what.

451
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:02,974
So, by going back on that vow now,

452
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:06,978
I feel like by building this,
I'm not just going to hurt Despero,

453
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:10,440
I'm gonna hurt myself, too.

454
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:19,574
Look, I know you want to
do right by Barry and by the team,

455
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:24,037
but you can't do that
if you don't do right by yourself.

456
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,415
It's not your job to make weapons.

457
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:32,337
It's to find a way to protect Barry

458
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:35,298
and stay true to yourself.

459
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,597
Yeah. Yeah.

460
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:45,934
- What's that?
- Uh...

461
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:48,728
Okay, I built a temporary comms system

462
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,605
by piggybacking off of cell towers.

463
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:54,984
I'm also using it to scan for C.C.P.D.
chatter about criminal activity.

464
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:56,110
- Right?
- Right.

465
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:59,030
Okay, okay, uh...

466
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:02,283
Flash, we got trouble.

467
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:05,245
Chester, what's happening?

468
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:26,849
Miss, step aside.

469
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:29,477
But if I did that, then how would I grab

470
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,938
all the priceless art
you're transporting?

471
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,109
Officer, you sound insane.

472
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:46,953
Xotar. Xotar.

473
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:50,373
Xotar. Xotar.

474
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:54,252
Central City Museum, you shouldn't have.

475
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:55,878
It's like you read my mind.

476
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:04,947
You're done messing with
other people's minds, Xotar.

477
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,014
Including mine.

478
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:15,398
If it makes you feel
like less of a failure,

479
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:18,860
I dug my claws into your mind
long before you even arrived.

480
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:28,828
Apologies for not mentioning
the telekinesis.

481
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:30,872
Didn't take a crystal ball to know

482
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:33,333
I'd eventually have to catch you
by surprise.

483
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:38,796
You know, back in the day,
my specialty was bending spoons.

484
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:58,483
Okay, uh, guys,
now C.C.P.D. is reporting

485
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,651
that the Flash is getting
his butt kicked downtown

486
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:03,488
by some meta magician
that's got him suspended in midair.

487
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:05,156
It's got to be Xotar.

488
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:06,532
Barry, Frost is on her way.

489
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:09,136
But she's all the way across town.
She'll never make it in time.

490
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:10,912
<i>No, I can stop Xotar!</i>

491
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:13,831
I just need to generate
enough lightning.

492
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:15,583
But, Barry, you need friction

493
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:17,227
to build up that kind of kinetic energy.

494
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:21,756
If you can't run,
you can't throw lightning. Barry?

495
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:24,424
Barry?

496
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:40,775
It sounds like
Barry is generating lightning.

497
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:42,026
How is that possible?

498
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:44,237
Holy Granville T. Woods.

499
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,074
Okay, if he's vibrating his cells
on a microscopic level,

500
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:51,786
that might be enough movement
to... to build up an electrical charge.

501
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:53,329
How would he throw lightning then?

502
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:55,581
I don't think he's going to.

503
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:59,836
My guess is he's letting it build up
inside of him on purpose.

504
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:04,048
Caitlin, what happens if his body
can't hold in his lightning anymore?

505
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:05,967
I think we're about to find out.

506
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:50,052
That was the hospital.
The guard that Xotar attacked

507
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:52,263
recovered as soon as
she was meta-cuffed.

508
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:53,931
So did everyone else she attacked.

509
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:55,433
How you feeling, Barry?

510
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,352
Like it's barely past lunchtime,

511
00:32:58,436 --> 00:33:00,521
it already feels like
the longest day of my life.

512
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:02,416
But it also feels like
it's going to be a good one.

513
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,084
Now that we've gotten Xotar,
we don't have to worry about

514
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:06,611
the rest of the day
or you losing your sanity.

515
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:10,072
Well, in that case, I don't know
about you guys, but I'm starving.

516
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:11,491
Oh, yeah.

517
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:13,677
Why don't we meet up with Iris
at Joe and Cecile's?

518
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:15,304
Let's see if we can talk Joe
into whipping us up

519
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:16,746
a pot of his famous jambalaya?

520
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:22,668
That's not funny, Barry.

521
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:25,796
Okay, ask him to grill
some burgers instead.

522
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:27,798
Why are you doing that?

523
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:30,426
Doing what?

524
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:32,512
Acting like Joe's still alive.

525
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:39,769
What are you talking about?

526
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,104
You don't remember?

527
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,817
Barry, Joe died six months ago.

528
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,903
You know that.

529
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:51,321
What?

530
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:55,618
No, I don't believe you.

531
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:58,871
Barry, look,

532
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:04,085
maybe you're still processing this
or something? I don't know.

533
00:34:04,877 --> 00:34:06,546
But we'll... we'll figure it out.

534
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:09,757
Okay? Why don't you just sit down

535
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:14,095
and let Caitlin take a look
at the ol' noggin?

536
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:32,572
- Where is he?
- Barry, you're scaring me.

537
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:33,698
- Where is he?
- Who?

538
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:34,782
Joe!

539
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,756
You gave the eulogy at his funeral.

540
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,049
No, I...

541
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,555
No, this is wrong.
Iris, this is wrong.

542
00:34:57,638 --> 00:34:58,596
We have to investigate this.

543
00:34:58,598 --> 00:34:59,908
We have to find out
what really happened to him.

544
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:01,601
He's not dead. He can't be.

545
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:03,059
Damn it, Barry.

546
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:06,188
Joe is gone.

547
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:09,567
Why can't you just accept that?

548
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:28,711
Cecile.

549
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:31,130
Barry, why are you saying
all these things all of a sudden?

550
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:32,590
It's like the last six months,

551
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:35,384
this living nightmare,
never even happened.

552
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:36,468
Six months.

553
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:38,847
What are you doing?
I can't do this with you.

554
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,181
Barry, I can't do it.

555
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:42,475
Cecile, listen to me.
Joe's not dead.

556
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:43,558
Yes.

557
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:46,145
Yes, he is.

558
00:35:47,021 --> 00:35:50,316
He's dead and I'm trying to move on.

559
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:52,610
- Why won't you let me do that?
- Cecile, please.

560
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:53,694
Barry.

561
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:56,530
You're all over the news.

562
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,450
- What?
- What did you do?

563
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:01,077
Nothing...

564
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:06,290
<i>After apprehending
a criminal earlier today,</i>

565
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:10,419
<i>the Flash, for reasons unknown,
committed a crime of his own.</i>

566
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:14,006
<i>Warning. This footage
may be disturbing to some viewers.</i>

567
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:25,434
<i>Our camerawoman was barely able
to escape with her life.</i>

568
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:27,436
<i>Luckily, there were no deaths today,</i>

569
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:31,482
<i>despite what city officials estimate
are millions of dollars in damage.</i>

570
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:32,817
<i>But other members of our crew,</i>

571
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,653
<i>along with dozens of innocent civilians,</i>

572
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:38,406
<i>were injured
in the Flash's brazen attack.</i>

573
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:41,117
<i>Once again, our top story,</i>

574
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:43,994
<i>the hero who has saved our city
countless times</i>

575
00:36:44,078 --> 00:36:45,913
<i>has turned against us.</i>

576
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:48,916
<i>More on this unprecedented
breaking development,</i>

577
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:51,168
<i>as we head to our reporter
on the ground.</i>

578
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:55,005
I don't remember doing that.

579
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:57,633
Caitlin said you didn't remember
destroying the loft

580
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,261
or almost killing her
and Chester either.

581
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:05,141
Barry, we can blame Xotar for the loft.

582
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:08,602
But she was in meta-cuffs
when you destroyed City Hall.

583
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:10,771
Do you see?

584
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:15,234
It's been you all along, Flash.

585
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:17,778
- Now do you believe me?
- No.

586
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:20,239
This is one of your illusions.
That's it.

587
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,217
Iris, Cecile, you have to believe me.

588
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:23,241
Enough!

589
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:25,327
This ends now.

590
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:33,794
Barry!

591
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:37,631
It's fitting that I end your life

592
00:37:37,715 --> 00:37:40,301
with the undying fire of my home world.

593
00:37:40,384 --> 00:37:42,261
The Flame of Py'tar.

594
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,306
Get out of my house.

595
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:55,441
The empath.

596
00:37:56,776 --> 00:38:00,070
Well, your power's no match for me,
so for now...

597
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:02,238
<i>Sleep.</i>

598
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,620
Stop!

599
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:11,373
If it's me you want, get it over with.

600
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:12,500
Gladly.

601
00:38:23,803 --> 00:38:25,513
That's all I got. Barry, run.

602
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:27,556
Good move, Chuck.

603
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:30,476
What's wrong with you people?

604
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:33,938
You saw the destruction he'll bring
to the world with your own eyes.

605
00:38:34,021 --> 00:38:36,482
Why am I fighting this threat alone?

606
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:46,826
Stand in my way again, any of you,
and suffer the consequences.

607
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:51,205
I will find the Flash and end him...

608
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:54,416
before he brings about Armageddon.

609
00:39:07,513 --> 00:39:08,931
<i>So is Barry going to be all right?</i>

610
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:11,392
Honestly, we don't know.

611
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:16,105
Can you tell us anything else about
Despero's planet or his freaky flame?

612
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:19,441
<i>Well, actually, the pieces
are starting to come together.</i>

613
00:39:19,525 --> 00:39:22,570
<i>For years, we had heard
rumors and whispers</i>

614
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:26,198
<i>from the dark corners of the galaxy
about the Flame of Py'tar,</i>

615
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:28,701
<i>which is an energy source
that was supposedly</i>

616
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:30,703
<i>the sentient heart
of the planet Kalanor.</i>

617
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:32,055
<i>Butjust when we started to think</i>

618
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,582
<i>that this was a pan-galactic
urban legend,</i>

619
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:38,669
<i>you guys are the first to meet
an actual Kalanorian.</i>

620
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:41,922
Lucky us.

621
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,966
<i>Yeah, but thanks to you guys,</i>

622
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:46,135
<i>we've opened an official file
on Despero.</i>

623
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,012
<i>Kara and J'onn, they're off-world.</i>

624
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:50,890
<i>But we'll keep investigating,
and I'll call if we find anything</i>

625
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:52,266
<i>that can help take him down.</i>

626
00:39:52,975 --> 00:39:54,268
<i>You guys stay safe, okay?</i>

627
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:56,520
Yeah. Thanks. You too, Alex.

628
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,900
We may not be the Tower
or have access to S.T.A.R. Labs,

629
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,943
but Chester P.
can still roll up his sleeves

630
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:06,238
and see what I can come up with
to help track down Barry.

631
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:09,116
Assuming he wants to be found.

632
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:12,721
If you and Allegra hadn't shown up
when you did...

633
00:40:12,745 --> 00:40:17,082
Hey, hey. It's all good. Okay?
We'll figure this out. We always do.

634
00:40:18,626 --> 00:40:19,752
We'll get Barry back.

635
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:22,046
Yeah. But what will he be like
when we do?

636
00:40:58,415 --> 00:40:59,875
You look like death warmed over.

637
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:01,794
I need your help.

638
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:04,880
Barry, what the hell is going on?

639
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:07,925
Injustice.
