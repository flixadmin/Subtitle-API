1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,960
Is William home?

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,740
Girls believe he's good deep down.
That he's going to be better for them.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,260
You're standing here. While he's out there
somewhere sleeping with someone else.

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,380
<i>[Fuck I lost my phone between the bus seats yesterday, and 
only found it today. I'm in Lillehammer but it's shit and I miss 
you so much. Can we please be done with the space stuff soon?]</i>

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,500
My brother is a complete psychopath.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,340
Psychopath?

7
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:31,300
<i>[Want to pop out to Bygdøy and take the first swim of the year? 
No, it's not too cold, come on. I'll make cocoa and pick you up in 30.]</i>

8
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:50,260
<i>[Don't you have Russ stuff today?]</i>

9
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:57,680
<i>[..?]</i>

10
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:21,760
<i>[I just mean that you have to remember to have fun
the last few days! You're only a Russ once in your life.]</i>

11
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:31,780
<i>[I want to be with you.]</i>

12
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:58,440
<i>[But I'm sick. I think I have a fever.]</i>

13
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:10,440
<i>[Okay. Do you need anything?]</i>

14
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:23,080
<i>[No thanks. I'm fine.]</i>

15
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,320
I'm sleeping.

16
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,820
Ah good, you're awake!

17
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,800
What is it?

18
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,420
We've made breakfast in bed for you..

19
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:55,020
.. to show you that we love you and 
to apologise for always leeching off of you.

20
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,520
I'm not hungry.

21
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,560
Yeah but you can just a eat a little bit.

22
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,300
Eskild, I said I wasn't hungry!

23
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,860
I'm gonna lie down again.

24
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,720
What's wrong?

25
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,200
Is it William?

26
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,180
I just have the flu.

27
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,280
You know you don't have
to face everything in the world on your own?

28
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,660
It's just a fever.

29
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,560
It'll pass.

30
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,240
Okay.

31
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,200
I'll give you two days.

32
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:54,720
[Why do you never answer in the chat? You're coming to the 17th of 
May (Norway's Constitution Day) breakfast at my place tomorrow, right?

33
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:46,600
<i>[I have to know what happened last Friday.]</i>

34
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:07,580
<i>[Noora! You were so quiet! Meet me.
Then we'll drink beer and talk about it. My treat.]</i>

35
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:39,140
<i>[Ok. At a public café in one hour.]</i>

36
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,020
<i>[Public café? All cafés are public.]</i>

37
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,740
Please don't hate me..

38
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,580
What are you doing here?

39
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,900
I'm trying to find out why you've 
locked yourself inside for three days.

40
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,620
I'm sick.

41
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm sick.

42
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,220
Why don't you want to talk to me?

43
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,020
Because it's just.. there's just
a few hours of your Russ time left.

44
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,560
You have to.. I want
you to go out and celebrate and..

45
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,920
.. to have fun with your friends.

46
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,440
You don't have to
waste your time on me.

47
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,100
What's this fuss about Russ time?

48
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,520
Fuck that.

49
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,320
It's not that important.

50
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,920
It's just once in your
life that you're a Russ.

51
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,280
If you don't want to be with me..

52
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,800
.. then you need to
have the fucking guts to say it.

53
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,160
I do want to be with you!

54
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,500
But I have to write an article..

55
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,440
.. which I should have handed in yesterday.

56
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:13,940
I can't write it, because I can't think.
Because I can't sleep!

57
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,900
Do you understand? It's just
because my heart is jumping out of my chest.

58
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,360
No, but I can't breathe!
It feels as if I'm going to die.

59
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,060
You're not gonna die.

60
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,700
I promise.

61
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,820
You're just anxious.

62
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,200
We just have to get
you to relax a little, okay?

63
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,060
No, but I can't relax. Don't you see?

64
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,200
That article is really important.

65
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,780
I have to hand it in.

66
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,160
Noora, you don't have to do anything.

67
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,340
Don't look at me
while I'm sleeping.

68
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,220
Good reply.

69
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,700
You slept for 15 hours.

70
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,800
How do you feel?

71
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,140
NOORA

72
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,860
Okay, world's ... person..

73
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,940
You should be at Eva's 17th of
May breakfast in 30 minutes. I'll drive you.

74
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,120
I can't bear that now.

75
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,180
You're not better of lying here.
You have to go out with your friends.

76
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,420
I found a dress for you.

77
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,460
I can't go in that one.

78
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,320
I wore it to a Christmas ball in eighth grade.

79
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,460
It's really ugly.

80
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,020
Huh?

81
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,940
No, it's really nice.

82
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,700
Call me if something happens, okay?

83
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,080
You promise?

84
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,640
There's some stuff..

85
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,960
.. that I have to find out.

86
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,800
Before I can tell you.

87
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,320
Just tell me when you're ready.

88
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,620
Love you.

89
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,340
I love you too.

90
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,520
Happy Constitution Day!

91
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,720
Happy Constitution Day.

92
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,480
New dress?

93
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,840
Cheers again!
Oh my god.

94
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,740
The 17th of May is my favorite day!

95
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:02,680
You start the day with alcohol,
you end the day with alcohol.

96
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,140
You spend the entire day with alcohol.

97
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,220
How much ice cream
do you eat during the 17th of May? 

98
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,640
How much ice cream?

99
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,280
Ice cream or sausages.
-I eat 15.

100
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,400
15?!
-At least!

101
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,820
I'm not kidding. We have to eat ice cream.
-Krone ice cream?

102
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,200
How many did you eat today?
-Five.

103
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,100
You ate five ice creams?
-Yeah.

104
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,040
The Russ parade is 
in like two hours.

105
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,640
I'll wave to many.

106
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,640
Oh! Oh!

107
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,700
Cheers to you.
-Yeah, cheers to you!

108
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,080
Finish that glass.

109
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,140
Should I hand you some food?

110
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,980
No, thanks. I have a
bit of a stomach ache today.

111
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,300
It's so nice that you could all
come to my 17th of May breakfast today.

112
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,440
I love you all. You know that,
that's not why I'm giving a speech.

113
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,580
I want to say, Noora..

114
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,840
Fucking hell, how clever you are.

115
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,000
I thought I should read your article.

116
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,920
As some kind of speech for today.

117
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,380
Youthful freedom and responsibility.

118
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,960
By Noora Amalie Saætre. 17 years old.

119
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:55,680
Norwegian youth spend more than four hours a day
on social media, according to a study.

120
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,780
Some believe it's a waste of time,
but I understand why we do it very well.

121
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,760
Society is straightforward on social media.

122
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,000
Where you can just log off,
or block everything you don't like.

123
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,060
Today, we celebrate our constitution.

124
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:20,920
It says that everyone has equal rights,
 and that humas are born free and shall remain free. 

125
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,480
Free to be on social media for four hours.

126
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:29,280
Free to get wasted and fuck around.

127
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,860
Free to use 900.000 for a Russ bus.

128
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,920
Norway isn't the same country as it 
was when the Constitution was written.

129
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,060
Norwegian society is constantly developing.

130
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:48,240
Today, thousands of refugees are 
coming intoEurope in search of a place to live.

131
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,660
Those are people from a different culture than us.

132
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:56,700
People whose values we may disagree with.

133
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,520
Some are afraid they
will threaten our Norwegian values.

134
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,120
It would have been best
to have the Facebook function to just block them.

135
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,340
But that's not how it goes.

136
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:14,060
So, on this day when we celebrate our Constitution..

137
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,060
.. we shall remember what we celebrate.

138
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,340
If we believe in the values it is based on..

139
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:27,120
If we agree with the idea that all people
should be free and have equal rights..

140
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:34,360
.. it's not our responsibility to
fight to persevere the values for all people.

141
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,080
It's not there to open doors to
strangers who want to threaten our values..

142
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:44,260
But it's there to not open the doors for them.

143
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,520
We live in a society because we need each other.

144
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,740
People need people.

145
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:59,860
It can be tiring to deal with others..
Especially the ones you disagree with.

146
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,800
Those who think differently from you.

147
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:10,540
Whether some are from another culture, or a girl who's
 a lame Facebook friend from elementary school.

148
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:17,980
In a peaceful society with equal rights, we have
to manage to listen to, and try to understand each other.

149
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:27,300
Perhaps it's easier to understand if we focus on what
we have in common, rather than the differences.

150
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,680
Look for what we agree with,
instead of what we disagree with.

151
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:39,780
Maybe if we see the worst in others,
it is exactly that what they will show us.

152
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:47,640
We have the right to waste
four hours on social media every day.

153
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,540
Because some before us have
fought for the freedom to do so.

154
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,720
Soon it's us who will take over this country.

155
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,300
It's up to us which
values we live by in the future.

156
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:09,760
I hope equal rights and freedom for all the people
of this world is a battle we are ready to take on.

157
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,340
Completely serious..

158
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:19,560
If not we, who are raised in the
 world's most free and richest country..

159
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:24,960
If not we choose generosity,
 patience, and openness..

160
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,440
If not we choose to look for and 
believe in the good in each other..

161
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,540
If not we can fight for righteousness..

162
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,740
Then who would be able to do it?

163
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,700
What's wrong?

164
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,240
I think I was raped by William's brother.

165
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,580
Huh?

166
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,600
I don't know.. it's possible that 
I had sex with him willingly, but..

167
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,720
I don't remember anything.

168
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,200
Did you ask him?

169
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,060
What does he say?

170
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,640
Fucking hell, that asshole!

171
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,020
I swear to God,
if he raped you.

172
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,380
We have to report him.

173
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,900
What is there to report?

174
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,180
I can't report anything
I know nothing about.

175
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,680
I don't know what happened.

176
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,840
Does it feel as if 
you've had sex with him?

177
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,460
How would I feel that?

178
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,240
You're a virgin.
You would have noticed it.

179
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,160
I'm not a virgin.

180
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,820
I had sex when I was thirteen.

181
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,020
Thirteen?!

182
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,280
I had a boyfriend who was fifteen.

183
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,940
So, I thought I was ready for it.

184
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,640
Then he dumped me days later.

185
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,660
End of story.

186
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,220
What happened with William's brother?

187
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,900
Tell everything from the start.

188
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,480
I had to talk to William.

189
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,920
Eva and Chris.. you don't know this.

190
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,660
Everyone knows of you and William, Noora.

191
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,020
I went to William,
but he wasn't home.

192
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,020
His brother was there.

193
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,760
I went inside to charge my phone.

194
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:59,780
I ended up talking to him.

195
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:07,500
He just told me lots of shit about William.

196
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,800
I felt really sad.

197
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,280
I drank a glass of wine.

198
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,280
Then I remember nothing.

199
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,200
You were drugged?

200
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:45,600
I don't know. I never drink alcohol, because I can't 
take it. I either feel really bad or I black out.

201
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,820
But, after one glass of wine?

202
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,440
I think I drank a shot, too.

203
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:14,160
But is there no one else you can ask?
Someone at the party, some witnesses?

204
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:26,580
Yeah there was a
girl who goes to our school. Mari.

205
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,900
Do you know who she is?

206
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,720
What year?

207
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,020
I don't know, but..

208
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,880
I can't ask her, because..

209
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,700
She seems like a bit of a bitch.

210
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,800
How so?

211
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,360
We have to go to the emergency room.

212
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,160
Huh, no.

213
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:59,720
They can help us. You
shoul've gone there long ago.

214
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,720
It's the first place you go!

215
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,080
They can help us find evidence
we can use against him.

216
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,000
Everyone knows that.

217
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:15,280
You go to the doctor. It's the first place you go. Before 
showering, before changing your clothes, you just go to the doctor.

218
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,100
I don't understand
how you didn't know that.

219
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,960
I don't even know if I was raped.

220
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,180
There's no evidence left now.

221
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:46,580
And there's nothing the doctor,
the police, or the law can do now.

222
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:59,720
In this free, democratic country we have to believe there are 
laws and rules that protect us against assholes like him.

223
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,920
We must believe in justice.

224
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,300
We must believe that the good wins.

225
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,580
Dead serious.

226
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,100
If we don't believe in it..

227
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,740
Who will believe in it then?

228
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,980
Hello!

229
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,160
Hi.

230
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,700
Can we have two beer?

231
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,660
I'm under 18.

232
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,040
So nice to see you!

233
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,420
Thought you were chickening out.

234
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,840
It seemed like you
had some paranoia in that chat.

235
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,580
I remember very little of that night.

236
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:15,280
So I'm nervous about what happened.

237
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,500
You blacked out completely.

238
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,140
Yes.

239
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,020
What did I actually drink?

240
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,680
Relax, it was just white wine.

241
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,580
Or tequila? Didn't we drink tequila?

242
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,600
Cheers.

243
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:55,620
I'm not here to drink beer with you.
I just want to know what happened.

244
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,920
You can have one beer with me, though.

245
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:09,080
If you never intended to tell me what happened,
I'm just gonna go.

246
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,820
Isn't that a little presumptuous? 

247
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,000
It's pretty ballsy to be rude to
someone who has naked pictures of you.

248
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,320
Was that a threat?

249
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,660
Did it sound like a threat?

250
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,900
Yes.
-Yeah well, then it was a threat.

251
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,940
What are you studying in Stockholm?

252
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,080
Eh, international finance.

253
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,960
You should have chosen law.

254
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,180
Okay?

255
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:14,140
Yeah then perhaps you wouldn't
have been in the situation you are in now.

256
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,480
And what situation am I in now, Noora?

257
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,040
You're in a situation where you'll
be convicted for child pornography.

258
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:42,300
According to the penal code, paragraph 204a..

259
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:51,940
.. the penalty for producing and possessing an image that sexualises
a child, is imprisonment for up to three years.

260
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:02,020
I am under 18, and therefore according
to the Norwegian law, I am still a child.

261
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:12,760
So those naked pictures you have of me, 
that you have taken without my consent..

262
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:20,300
Not only is it illegal that you took them,
but also that you stored them in your phone.

263
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,440
So if I were you, I'd be really
careful about spreading them.

264
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,520
Before it enters another paragraph.

265
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,300
Are you serious now?

266
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,700
Does it look like I'm kidding?

267
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,460
Child pornography?

268
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,040
That's completely foolish.

269
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,460
Say that to the judge.

270
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,760
You've also threatened me just now.

271
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:15,200
According to the law about threats..

272
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:21,300
Paragraph 263, and coercion paragraph 251..

273
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,200
.. it's punishable by imprisonment 
of up to two years.

274
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,040
Then we're up to five years.

275
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,180
But relax..

276
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:39,040
They thend to merge verdicts. So we're
talking about maybe two years in reality.

277
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:43,740
But if you have a good lawyer,
which surely you have..

278
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,300
Then we come to the violations of
the Alcohol Act, paragraph 1 to 5.

279
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,940
Serving alcohol to minors,
on top of it all.

280
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,460
That's something to have on your CV, right?

281
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,520
However, I think the child pornography..

282
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,040
That one has to be the worst.

283
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:30,240
You know what happens to people in
prison who were convicted of child pornography?

284
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,720
I wouldn't pick up soap
in the shower if I were you.

285
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,380
To put it like that.

286
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,500
She's your last hope.

287
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:11,680
Why didn't you talk to her before?

288
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,500
Move on, or talk to her.

289
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,960
What's the worst thing that could happen?

290
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,160
That she says I had sex with her, as well.

291
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,740
It's nothing to be embarrassed
about. I made out with Eva.

292
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,420
The feelings that arise don't
necessarily mean you're lesbian.

293
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,260
It's a message from Nico.
-What does it say?

294
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,060
Open it.

295
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:58,580
<i>[Nice to see you yesterday. I hope you and 
William become happy together.]</i>

296
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,020
He told William.

297
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,900
Tell me you didn't sleep with my brother.

298
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,620
I will explain everything.

299
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,640
You didn't sleep with him?

300
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,320
I don't know.
