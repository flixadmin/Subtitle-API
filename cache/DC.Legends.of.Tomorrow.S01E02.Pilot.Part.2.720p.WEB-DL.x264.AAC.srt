00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:05,004
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

3
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:07,639
<i>conquered the world and
murdered my wife and child.</i>

4
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:10,476
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

5
00:00:10,478 --> 00:00:12,277
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

6
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,213
<i>Unfortunately,
my plan is opposed</i>

7
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:16,348
<i>by the body I'd sworn
my allegiance to:</i>

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,017
<i>The Time Masters.</i>

9
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,719
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,087
<i>but if we succeed,</i>

11
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:25,324
<i>they will be remembered
as legends.</i>

12
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:29,161
<i>Previously, on
"Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

13
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:31,397
Savage has kept his movements
hidden throughout history,

14
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,500
But Professor Aldus Boardman
is the world's leading expert.

15
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:37,403
- Savage was an Egyptian priest.
- Kendra and I reincarnate.

16
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:39,538
And every time he kills you,
it passes to him.

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,307
That's what maintains
his immortality.

18
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,642
<i>Professor Boardman
has sustained</i>

19
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:45,110
<i>severe internal injuries.</i>

20
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:46,612
100 years from now,
your lives

21
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:48,480
have minimal effect
on the recorded timeline.

22
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,182
You lied to us.

23
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:51,650
I don't give a damn
about being a legend

24
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,952
as long as we end Savage
once and for all.

25
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:55,988
So how do we find this guy?

26
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,729
And we've arrived.

27
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,564
Gideon, if you wouldn't mind
camouflaging us

28
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,266
as an alpine meadow, perhaps?

29
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:08,634
What are you
complaining about now?

30
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,002
It's not like we time-jumped.

31
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:12,204
I hate flying,
especially in...

32
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:14,006
whatever this thing is.

33
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:15,474
Where exactly are we?

34
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:18,043
- We're still in 1975, right?
- Indeed.

35
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:20,679
October 1975 on the fjords
of northern Norway.

36
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,481
Sounds like a vacation.

37
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:24,383
Which we can take
as soon as the threat of Savage

38
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:26,018
has been neutralized, Mr. Snart.

39
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,286
That's Aldus's notebook.

40
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:29,221
Now he theorized
that Savage might

41
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:30,622
Be here, and if he's right,

42
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,357
And if we can capture Savage,
then at least

43
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,293
Professor Boardman didn't
die in vain.

44
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:36,795
Can't we just go back
and save Aldus?

45
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,263
He was our son.

46
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,165
Look, I'm sorry.

47
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,468
We can't go back and change
events in which we participated.

48
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,104
Time would fold in on itself,
creating a temporal vortex.

49
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:46,538
Which sounds way cooler
than it is.

50
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,507
Forgetting physics
for a second,

51
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,310
Shouldn't we figure out
what Savage is doing in Norway?

52
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:53,212
According to Gideon,
there is a large meeting

53
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:55,814
Of terrorists and fringe groups
looking to buy illegal arms.

54
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,083
Now that sounds
like a vacation.

55
00:01:58,085 --> 00:01:59,485
Arms dealers and terrorists

56
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:01,453
Aren't exactly
our kind of people,

57
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,489
But they're the next best thing.

58
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,057
Well, looks like you
and your lapdog

59
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,425
Get to earn your keep.

60
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:08,527
I'm no one's lapdog,
bird-man.

61
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,496
So what exactly does one wear

62
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:12,331
To a black market arms bazaar,
anyway?

63
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:13,832
The Waverider has
a fabrication room

64
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,667
which can fashion
temporally-indigenous,

65
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,469
uh, fashion.

66
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,538
You've got a room
that makes clothing?

67
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,540
Doesn't everyone?

68
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,075
All right, first thing
we need to do

69
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:24,209
is work up a plan.

70
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,444
Got a lot of experience

71
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:27,279
infiltrating criminal
gatherings?

72
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,181
Didn't think so.
I'm calling the shots.

73
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:30,349
Actually, I'm in charge,

74
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:31,617
in case any of you
have forgotten.

75
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:34,153
No, I remember.
I just don't care.

76
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:36,155
Do I need to remind any of you
that I'm a time master?

77
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:37,856
Making discrete alterations
to the timeline

78
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:40,225
Is what I do, so we're not
just gonna charge into the past

79
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,360
Like a bull into a china shop...

80
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:42,694
Half of what you've told us

81
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,796
About the mission turned out
to be lies.

82
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,632
None of you
have ever encountered

83
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,467
Vandal Savage before.

84
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,602
I have,
and I'm telling you now,

85
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,604
you are making a big mistake.

86
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:55,874
Already did that
when we trusted you.

87
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:58,410
Back soon, Captain.

88
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,455
Looks like
they're checking credentials.

89
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:11,557
And we don't have any.

90
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:14,593
We got this.
Trust us.

91
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:17,696
Excuse you.

92
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,831
IDs.

93
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:26,638
You don't look like an
Amhad Ahmed Izz-al-din.

94
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,341
I'm Arab.
On my mother's side.

95
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:32,678
Is there a problem?

96
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,147
I don't like delays.

97
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:36,915
Do you know who we are?

98
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:40,519
My associates and I are the
operational arm of "scimitar".

99
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:43,222
The Lombardo square
bombing, 1963.

100
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:46,358
Murder of Henri Tyran,
Canada, 1970.

101
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,328
Konig airport massacre, 1971.

102
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,464
Bottom line?

103
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:55,968
You don't want to doubt me.

104
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:03,242
You're a special
kind of crazy.

105
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,544
I like it.

106
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,913
We're in.

107
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:13,652
So why don't I get
to play terrorist?

108
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,254
<i>This is just a kidnapping.</i>

109
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:18,190
<i>No need for your
nuclear fireworks.</i>

110
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:19,691
Savage'll be one of the buyers.

111
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,893
Once we get eyes on, hang back.

112
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:25,297
We'll boost him
once this is all over.

113
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,867
Any sign of him?

114
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:31,370
- No.
- He's not here, boss.

115
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:33,605
Let's get Ginger and
the Professor and move out.

116
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,641
If I could have
your attention.

117
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:37,676
Thank you all for coming.

118
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:40,746
I promise, it will be
well worth your time.

119
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:44,349
Seems we were wrong
about Savage.

120
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:47,786
He's not one of the buyers.

121
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,321
He's the seller.

122
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:52,591
This is a variable-yield
nuclear warhead,

123
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,993
Capable of producing a blast

124
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:59,498
Equivalent to
one megaton of TNT.

125
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,368
Shall we begin our bidding at
$100 million?

126
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,671
$100 million.

127
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:07,939
Do I hear $105 million?

128
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,342
$110 million?

129
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:13,011
$115 million?

130
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:16,281
Is everything all right, sir?

131
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:17,916
They're here.

132
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,621
That group.

133
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:24,289
Where are they from?

134
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,358
It appears we've drawn
some unwanted attention.

135
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,427
We need to bid.
Fire your gun in the air.

136
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:30,729
That's $125 million.

137
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,798
- Um, what's happening?
- Going once...

138
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,733
It's what's not happening
that is the concern.

139
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,535
- Going twice...
- Nobody else is bidding.

140
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,637
- Sold!
- Congratulations, Professor.

141
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,373
You just bought yourself
a nuclear weapon.

142
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,474
Well, well.

143
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:44,476
We seem to have a new player.

144
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:45,677
But you seem a bit academic.

145
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,713
How did you get in here
and who are you?

146
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:49,348
As of a few seconds ago,

147
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,416
I'm a nuclear power.

148
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,452
Yet I don't know you
or your organization,

149
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:54,820
And I know everyone.

150
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:57,689
- Hey. Back off.
- Watch your tone.

151
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,658
Is there some sort
of problem here?

152
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,661
Yeah, the master race here
is starting to bug me.

153
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:04,396
We're just gonna get
our nuclear warhead

154
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:05,597
And be on our way.

155
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,532
Not without paying first.

156
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,469
Once we've validated
that the warhead's operational.

157
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:12,404
Personally, I find it
highly unlikely

158
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:13,972
That you were able to accumulate

159
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:16,808
Enough fissionable material
in this era

160
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,812
To fashion
a workable nuclear device.

161
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,081
This era?

162
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:27,552
Figure of speech.

163
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,054
I got a feeling
you guys might want to get

164
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,156
Those helmets of yours on.

165
00:06:32,526 --> 00:06:34,659
Change of plans.

166
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:37,629
I'll provide a 25% discount

167
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,931
To the organization
which brings me

168
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,534
The heads of these men.

169
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,369
Can I burn some stuff now?

170
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:47,571
I wish you would.

171
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:00,511
- Now would be a good time...
- Yeah, to kill you.

172
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:03,451
I wasn't talking to you.

173
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,424
Oh!

174
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:06,925
Aah!

175
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,871
Aah!

176
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,417
Savage.

177
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,519
Prince Khufu.

178
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,688
As always, the fashion plate...

179
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,724
And your better half.

180
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,593
This ends here and now,
Savage.

181
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:15,827
You're coming with us.

182
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,762
I doubt you can
apprehend me...

183
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:20,031
And stop a nuclear explosion.

184
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,082
You screwed that up
pretty good.

185
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:38,517
I had it handled.

186
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,086
I like how you
actually believe that.

187
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,125
Aah!
Ugh!

188
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:50,295
Um, we got
a nuclear bomb here.

189
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,935
Ray!
What did you do?

190
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,805
I didn't do anything.
It must have a fail-safe.

191
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:04,009
Professor, Jax, we need you!

192
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:14,553
<i>You have to get
to a minimum safe distance.</i>

193
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,556
Okay, what now?

194
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,190
<i>We wait for the warhead
to go off,</i>

195
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:21,893
<i>At which point you're going to
have .06 seconds</i>

196
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,195
<i>To absorb the massive release
of atomic energy.</i>

197
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,997
Your plan sucks.
You know that, right?

198
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:28,633
<i>Concentrate, Jefferson.</i>

199
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:36,241
Aah!

200
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,162
Well, I'm really glad you were
the one calling the shots.

201
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:59,130
I had it under control
until the Professor

202
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,800
Started picking fights
with the PLO.

203
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,802
You let your ego endanger
our entire mission.

204
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,904
No, Mr. Rory's temper got
completely out of control...

205
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:07,766
I thought we were friends,
Professor.

206
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,774
At least there's one less
nuclear bomb on the planet.

207
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,100
Hear, hear.

208
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,180
Now you all deserve
a hearty congratulations.

209
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,746
Not only did you fail
to capture Savage,

210
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,852
you exposed yourselves
and your powers to him,

211
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,500
giving away the element of
surprise for now and all time.

212
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:24,906
Well done, team.

213
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,590
We don't need
the element of surprise.

214
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,192
We know he's in Norway,
so let's find him...

215
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,428
Unfortunately, we now have
larger problems than Savage.

216
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,829
If only you'd have
listened to me

217
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,464
About the dangers
of upsetting the timeline.

218
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,732
What are you talking about?

219
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,434
While you were busy
saving Norway

220
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,396
- ...from nuclear annihilation...
- you're welcome, Norway.

221
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,660
Savage sent one of his cronies

222
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,970
back to the site
of the arms sale.

223
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,042
Anyone care to guess
what he found?

224
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,114
Whoops.

225
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:51,216
<i>I am unversed in modern
American colloquialisms.</i>

226
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:52,317
<i>Is "whoops" slang for "oh"...</i>

227
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,019
Yes, Dr. Palmer seems to have

228
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:56,921
thrown a spanner in the works
for the entire timeline.

229
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,590
Come again?

230
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:00,225
Armed with Dr. Palmer's
future technology,

231
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,893
Savage's engineers
develop a weapon

232
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,928
Far more destructive than
anything here in 1975.

233
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,598
This is Central City in 2016.
At least it was.

234
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,233
I'm not sure what
the neo-fascists

235
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:11,269
Who took control of it
are calling it these days.

236
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:18,109
There must be a way
to correct this somehow.

237
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,211
Fortunately, Gideon is just
showing us a forecast

238
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,180
Of the future
you've all created.

239
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,615
Time is like cement.

240
00:11:23,617 --> 00:11:26,618
It takes time
to become permanent.

241
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,219
In this case,
until Savage's team

242
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,321
Have worked out the mystery
of your future technology

243
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:33,792
And molded it to their own ends.

244
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:36,094
And when they do,

245
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:38,163
What you see here is
no longer just a forecast.

246
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,265
This...

247
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:45,370
This is history.

248
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,287
Where is he?

249
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:05,256
His body, I mean.

250
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:08,026
There's cryo-storage
in the medbay.

251
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,162
I promise we'll get our son
a proper burial

252
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:12,764
Once we have a chance.

253
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:15,767
It's still so weird
to hear you call him that.

254
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,105
But even though
it was in a past life,

255
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,373
It feels like
something's missing.

256
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,709
I know.

257
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,945
What's that?

258
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,215
I found it in his pocket.

259
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:33,752
I've seen this knife before.

260
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,957
This is the knife
that Savage used to kill us.

261
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,060
In our first life.

262
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:44,896
So thanks to Raymond leaving
a piece of his suit in the past,

263
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:48,099
The rest of us don't have
a future to go back to?

264
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,136
Unless we do something to
change this course of events,

265
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:53,471
The future will
become immutable.

266
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,373
Exactly how much time
do we have?

267
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,443
Until Savage's weapons team
reverse-engineer your tech.

268
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:00,745
We're talking 1970s terrorists

269
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,247
With 21st-century weapons.

270
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:04,048
And since we don't know
where Savage went...

271
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,117
We don't have to find Savage.

272
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,319
We just have to find
the other piece of my suit.

273
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,088
Which shrinks because
it's made of an alloy

274
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,290
Which mimics intra-molecular
compression of dwarf star,

275
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,892
Thus emitting alpha particles.

276
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:16,060
So we just need
to be able to track them.

277
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,263
Fortunately, alpha particles
are highly trackable.

278
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:20,165
Yet unheard of in the 1970s.

279
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,100
It's like we're trapped
in the stone age.

280
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:24,302
I'll have you know that I was
researching alpha particles

281
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,070
When you were eating crayons.

282
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,439
So to track that piece of
Raymond's super-suit,

283
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,308
We just need to talk to...

284
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,442
Me.

285
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,478
25-year-old me, rather.

286
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,079
You two are just in time.

287
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,815
Show them, Kendra.

288
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,783
Aldus was carrying this
when he was killed.

289
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,119
It's a newspaper article about
an Egyptian dagger.

290
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,921
The one Savage used
to kill us.

291
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,989
In Central City, we learned
that objects associated

292
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,792
With the night of our deaths
can also be used to kill Savage.

293
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:50,028
According to Aldus's notes,
the dagger needs to be wielded

294
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,497
In conjunction with
an incantation inscribed on it.

295
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,767
What does
this incantation say?

296
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:58,503
I don't know.
I can't read the language.

297
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,505
It's okay.
I'll help you remember.

298
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,907
Splendid.
Now, as for the dagger...

299
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,475
- You need someone to steal it.
- Okay, fine.

300
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,978
Whatever.
I'll do it.

301
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,414
Article says it was purchased by
some rich Russian douche bag

302
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,050
Named Sasha Mahnovski.

303
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,818
- I'll go with you.
- I already got a partner.

304
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,220
Who I trust
even less than you.

305
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:17,088
Look, you're more than welcome
to go with them.

306
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,258
Just don't take along
any of your future tech.

307
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,461
Oy!
Where do you think you're going?

308
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:25,129
To break into my old lab
and bring us back

309
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,164
The particle tracker.

310
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,432
Fine, but perhaps,

311
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,267
You should take Jefferson
and Sara with you

312
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,169
To act as your intermediaries.

313
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:33,338
Look, interacting with yourself
in the past

314
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,374
Can have catastrophic effects
upon the future.

315
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,543
Fascinating.
Let's go.

316
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,379
<i>Setting a course

00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,023
People actually
wore this crap?

320
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,458
People smoked a lot of pot
in the '70s.

321
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,993
It clearly had
a deleterious effect

322
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,594
On the fashion of the era.

323
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:58,596
Let's just hurry up
and get that particle tracker

324
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,398
So I can get the hell
out of these go-go boots.

325
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,433
Remember, when we meet
my former self,

326
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,036
It is imperative that we don't
let on we're from the future,

327
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:08,439
So let's just be cool.

328
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,343
Oh, my god.

329
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,178
Look.

330
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,416
I'd forgotten
how handsome I was.

331
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:22,420
My hair, it's so thick
and silky.

332
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,861
Do I know you?

333
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,229
No. No.

334
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:34,465
- I'm Professor Musk. Elon Musk.
- Mm.

335
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,634
And these are my two
lab assistants.

336
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,002
Hi.

337
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:40,271
I'm Marty.

338
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,640
Are you sure
we haven't met before?

339
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:45,410
Uh, that's
a very interesting question.

340
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,278
Um, suffice it to say,

341
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,314
I am familiar with your work.

342
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:50,615
That's actually
why we're here.

343
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,150
To see you.

344
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,919
You're a leading expert
in alpha particles?

345
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:58,156
No, I'm<i> the</i> leading expert.

346
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:00,091
Well, we were hoping
to pick your brain

347
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,160
About your area of expertise.

348
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,227
- Physics?
- Mm-hmm.

349
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,329
Which are you interested in,

350
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,030
Applied or theoretical?

351
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:07,932
That is just the thing.

352
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,501
I can't decide.

353
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,071
I love them both.

354
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:14,906
Cool.

355
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,341
Well, let's go spark a doobie

356
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:19,477
And rap about physics.

357
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,714
Lead the way, Marty.

358
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:31,155
Uh, are you sure
that's actually you?

359
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,391
Oh, man.

360
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,260
Concentrate, Kendra.

361
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,162
You know how to
read the inscription.

362
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,530
At least, you used to know.

363
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,666
Yeah, well, my hieroglyphic is
a little rusty.

364
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,368
<i>Lapidary hieratic, actually.</i>

365
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,936
<i>An ancient language
lost to the ages.</i>

366
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:46,404
Don't you know how to read it?

367
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:48,172
It was a language known
only to the clergy.

368
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,474
<i>If we only had
a Rosetta stone,</i>

369
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:50,608
<i>I might be able to...</i>

370
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,312
Well, you are
our Rosetta stone.

371
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,414
Just close your eyes.

372
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,615
Think of it as meditation.

373
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,584
I need you to relax

374
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:01,786
And open your mind.

375
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,623
In order for you to remember
how to kill Savage,

376
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,426
I need you
to let your mind float

377
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:12,330
Back through your hundreds
of previous lives.

378
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:19,404
Your name is Chay-Ara,

379
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:22,407
And you are a priestess
in the temple of Horus.

380
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,016
What?
What is it?

381
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,652
Us.

382
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:36,621
We were together.

383
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,689
Like, together-together.

384
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,558
Well, I have been telling you

385
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,093
That you and I should be
destined...

386
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:43,461
What are you doing?

387
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:46,230
What part of "destiny"
do you not understand?

388
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:50,101
The part where I have to stop
thinking for myself.

389
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:01,512
The group that disrupted
the arms auction.

390
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:02,780
Any idea who they were?

391
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,649
A man in a robotic suit,

392
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,551
Weapons that shoot ice and fire.

393
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:08,719
Suffice it to say,
they're not from around here.

394
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,755
I would assume the future.

395
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,791
- That's impossible.
- So is immortality.

396
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,726
Besides, how else
do you explain technology

397
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:18,196
Beyond anything we have seen?

398
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,768
What can you tell me about it?

399
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,204
It contains a miniaturized
missile-guidance system

400
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:29,607
Capable of delivering
high-explosive ordnance.

401
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,343
You have 24 hours
to reverse-engineer it.

402
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,112
It could take weeks,

403
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:37,115
Months to figure out
the circuitry.

404
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:43,688
It looks simple enough to me.

405
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,824
You just press this button here.

406
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,593
Aah!
Ugh!

407
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:54,799
I said 24 hours.

408
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:58,136
Suggest you all get to work.

409
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:05,743
I'm seeing motion detectors
on the ground floor.

410
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,179
Hardware on the doors
looks standard issue.

411
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:10,615
- I can't see any smoke alarms.
- Just stay close.

412
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,317
I saw at least three
armed guards on the perimeter.

413
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,352
Right, boss.

414
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:15,486
What the hell are you...

415
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,787
I recognize
the security system.

416
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:19,724
My parents had the exact one.

417
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,160
I'll have the access code
cracked and security disabled

418
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,828
Before you could say
"breaking and entering".

419
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,830
There.
We're in.

420
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,431
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

421
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,766
Why's that?

422
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,701
Because you just tapped into
a dummy box,

423
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,737
Which means those guards
are gonna be here...

424
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:35,339
Quicker than you can say
"rookie mistake".

425
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,841
Hands up.

426
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:43,481
Ha.

427
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:49,754
- So, who wants a hit?
- Yeah, man...

428
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:52,156
I believe you told me
you were trying to quit.

429
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,691
Oh, none for you, silver top?

430
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:54,792
I...

431
00:19:56,629 --> 00:20:00,431
I don't partake in cannabis.

432
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,901
Anymore, that is.

433
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:06,204
In fact, perhaps you should
take it easy.

434
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:09,173
Ah, it helps me think better.

435
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,741
Dad.

436
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,444
Yes, but what about the
long-term health consequences?

437
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,246
Speaking of which,
you might want to lay off

438
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,715
The saturated fats.

439
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,518
So, uh...

440
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,453
Alpha particles.
Oof.

441
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,188
Exciting stuff.

442
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,391
Too bad detection is
at least a decade away.

443
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,527
Mm, more like two decades.

444
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,896
But I've worked up
a little something.

445
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,365
Science is all about
the future, right?

446
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,334
I've developed a prototype
particle tracker.

447
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:37,602
Cutting edge.

448
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:40,571
Probably gonna mint me
$1,000,000.

449
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,640
Wow.
A whole million.

450
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,542
Mm, be right back.

451
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:47,311
I think I've got some chocolate
chip cookie dough in the fridge.

452
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:55,553
I cannot believe that
that is you.

453
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:58,456
Seriously, I had no idea
you were ever cool.

454
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,359
I wasn't cool.
I was an arrogant little snot.

455
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:02,360
Was?

456
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:03,928
What are you doing?

457
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,331
Looking for my younger self's
particle tracker.

458
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,333
Keep an eye on the door,
and when I get back,

459
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:10,635
Stop flirting with me.

460
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:12,503
You were the one
flirting with me.

461
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:13,904
Look, what's the big deal?

462
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:15,573
I mean, younger you
isn't married yet,

463
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:19,310
So technically
it's not cheating.

464
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:21,946
October 1975.

465
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:25,249
This is right when I meet
my future wife, Clarissa.

466
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:28,219
So obviously, we wouldn't want
my former self

467
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:30,921
Tempted by a sexy assassin
from the future.

468
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,524
Aw, you think I'm sex...

469
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:36,527
Do not finish that sentence.

470
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:42,333
Found it.

471
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:47,772
Is there a trick
to opening the case?

472
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,647
- Ah.
- What are you doing?

473
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,249
Let's grab the dagger
and let's go.

474
00:21:58,251 --> 00:21:59,950
Raymond, you don't
break into a candy store

475
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:01,752
And steal one gumball.

476
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:04,388
You guys grab the goodies.

477
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,425
I'll find the safe.

478
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:08,659
What do you think
you're doing?

479
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,261
This is what we came here for.

480
00:22:10,263 --> 00:22:13,731
No, it's what you
came here for.

481
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,566
Take your hand off me.

482
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:17,568
I'm not gonna let you
jeopardize another mission.

483
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,604
I'm done asking politely.

484
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,373
This is my mission.

485
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,674
And I'm gonna listen to a guy

486
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,676
Who's spent half of his life
in prison?

487
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:28,546
Oh!

488
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:32,783
Great.

489
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:35,853
Now we're both going to prison.

490
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:40,991
Eureka.

491
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:42,693
I remember building this.

492
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,730
It's... It's like déjà vu
all over again.

493
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:48,032
Put that down.

494
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,067
Excellent job
watching the door.

495
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,602
What are you doing?

496
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:52,937
Oh, just, uh...

497
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,538
What is this?

498
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,941
Something you shouldn't be
fooling around with.

499
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:59,443
It's very interesting-looking.

500
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:01,479
How about you cut the crap?

501
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:02,980
To which crap
are you referring?

502
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:06,884
I hold two PhDs,
and I'm working on a third.

503
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:10,888
I'm a five-time winner
of the Carlin award.

504
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,357
My point being,
is I don't believe

505
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,059
Either of those kids
you're hanging around with

506
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:16,761
Can even spell "physics".

507
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:18,729
You know, I'm beginning
to like the younger gray

508
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,064
Less and less.

509
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,833
Either you tell me
what the hell is going on,

510
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,335
Or I'm calling campus police.

511
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:26,103
I'm not supposed to tell you.

512
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:28,906
It could cause... well, trouble.

513
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,609
We're here to interview you
for a profile

514
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:34,645
In next month's "Wells Journal".

515
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:37,715
The "Wells" only profiles
Nobel candidates.

516
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:39,617
An exception is being made

517
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:42,086
In light of
your obvious brilliance.

518
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:44,088
I know a photograph of this
device would make

519
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,591
A spectacular cover if we could
just borrow it for a few hours.

520
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,527
Thanks, but that's

521
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:52,463
Two years of my life.

522
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:54,131
I'm not letting you
walk away with it.

523
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,167
Stay back!

524
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:00,971
That was taking too long.

525
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,474
You just knocked me out.

526
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:06,410
That beautiful brain,
struck unconscious.

527
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:09,814
The only way to shut you up.

528
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:11,415
What are you doing?
We have to go.

529
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,716
I have to make sure
I wake up in time

530
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:14,785
To go to this
faculty mixer tonight.

531
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,788
One of the Professors
is bringing his niece,

532
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,124
Aka my future wife.

533
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,226
Let's go!

534
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:30,901
What the hell happened?

535
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:32,937
- It was this idiot's fault.
- Your partner's fault.

536
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:34,672
I told you we shouldn't
have brought him.

537
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:36,040
Agreed, but we got
bigger problems.

538
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:37,541
I need you to find
the fuse box and...

539
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:40,077
Trigger a system default.

540
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,947
This ain't over.

541
00:24:50,423 --> 00:24:51,989
How did you know
how to do that?

542
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,625
When I was a kid, my dad
brought me along on jobs.

543
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:55,759
I had little hands.

544
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:57,461
I could get into tiny spaces,

545
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:58,796
Do whatever he needed me to do,

546
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,833
Like... Rewiring
a security system.

547
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,102
In another life, you could've
been an electrical engineer.

548
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:08,038
Guess I dodged a bullet.

549
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,774
You think I want to be like you?

550
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:12,076
You make being
a tech billionaire

551
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:13,811
Sound like a bad thing.

552
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:16,514
You spend all your time and
money inventing a super-suit,

553
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,082
And what do you do with it?

554
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:20,751
Fly around like some incredible
shrinking schmuck

555
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:23,554
Trying to save the world.

556
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:26,190
Robbing banks for a living... I
suppose that's more important?

557
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,459
It's sure as hell
more satisfying.

558
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:30,461
Thinking like that is what
makes you a criminal.

559
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:32,530
No, it makes me a survivor.

560
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:33,864
And there's gonna come a day

561
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:37,234
When you wish you were too.

562
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:42,106
Here.

563
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,911
You flip the solenoid,

564
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:49,847
Saves you the trouble
of rewiring it.

565
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:52,016
I take it back, Raymond.

566
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:55,953
You're not completely useless
after all.

567
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:04,595
I wanted to apologize.

568
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:06,730
I'm not afraid of my past.

569
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,065
I'm just

570
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,968
Unwilling to believe that
you're my future.

571
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,169
And the more you keep repeating

572
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:14,505
That we're destined
to be together,

573
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:16,707
The more I want
to prove you wrong.

574
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:18,275
And maybe that makes me
childish, and I'm...

575
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:21,512
No.
It doesn't.

576
00:26:21,514 --> 00:26:23,914
Not at all.

577
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:27,217
Look, 4,000 years
is a long time,

578
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,086
And maybe I've been
taking us for granted,

579
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,055
Expecting you
to fall in love with me

580
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:33,824
Because that's what you've done
the last 206 lifetimes,

581
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:36,093
But you're right.

582
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,862
Does not make us destiny.

583
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:42,333
More like... Probability.

584
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,203
Look, Kendra.

585
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:49,306
You don't have to love me
in this lifetime.

586
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:52,276
As many lifetimes as it takes.

587
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:55,145
I know you're worth the wait.

588
00:26:56,716 --> 00:26:58,148
All right, well, uh,

589
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,784
Let's try this again.

590
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:05,856
You know what to do.

591
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:09,960
Your name is Chay-Ara,

592
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:13,362
And you're a priestess
in the temple of Horus.

593
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:20,863
You're giving me a knife...
as a present?

594
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:22,106
Your conceptions of romance

595
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:24,274
Require some adjustment,
I think.

596
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:25,776
It's sacred.

597
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:27,144
I was told that
only a high priestess

598
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,746
could read the inscription.

599
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:30,914
It's a...
a poem.

600
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:33,150
"And though my soul
departs the Earth,

601
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,653
"I count my days
till my rebirth.

602
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:38,255
"I will wait across eternity

603
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:42,026
For my love to come back to me."

604
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:54,905
The knife.

605
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,140
You gave it to me,

606
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:57,808
and the inscription,

607
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,309
it was a poem... a love poem

608
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,078
Which promises...

609
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,980
Promises what?

610
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:06,817
That we'd be together forever.

611
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:11,321
Perhaps I really am a genius.

612
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:14,892
My younger self's tracker led us
straight to Savage's lab.

613
00:28:14,894 --> 00:28:18,262
Reading's at 96.6%
it's definitely down there.

614
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:20,798
- Be right back.
- Whoa... wait, wait, wait.

615
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,032
Shouldn't we handle this?

616
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,034
I mean, you're pretty stoned.

617
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,803
I could be unconscious
and still be able

618
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:29,273
To kick the ass of a few
rent-a-thugs from 1975.

619
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:31,835
Hey!

620
00:28:38,918 --> 00:28:41,918
I do see why I found her
so attractive.

621
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,221
Lookin' for this.

622
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,455
Yeah.

623
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,925
And y'all have
a lovely evening.

624
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:51,061
Huh.

625
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,730
Looks like Rory found
the fuse box.

626
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:54,164
We got a slight problem.

627
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,766
The owner just came home.

628
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:58,402
You're not gonna believe
who it is.

629
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,838
We meet again.

630
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,774
Oh, I'm grateful
for another opportunity

631
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:06,176
To kill you.

632
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,149
I've never
saved the world before.

633
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:13,951
Feels good.

634
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:16,820
We should've picked up some
donuts on the way back.

635
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:18,155
Oh, my god.

636
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:19,823
My ring.

637
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:21,825
When you knocked me out,
I must not have woken up,

638
00:29:21,827 --> 00:29:24,461
Or did, and decided not
to go to the mixer.

639
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:26,063
Clarissa.

640
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:27,865
Holy crap.

641
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:30,300
Now, do you want to tell me
who you are

642
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:33,537
And where you're from?

643
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,945
Stop struggling.

644
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,248
I've had 4,000 years of training

645
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,785
In every hold and
pressure point known.

646
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:50,254
But you already know that,
don't you?

647
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:52,055
That I'm immortal.

648
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:54,024
I'm gonna kill you anyway.

649
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:55,325
That's a promise.

650
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:58,262
Oh, what have I done
to deserve such enmity?

651
00:29:58,264 --> 00:30:00,130
No, let me rephrase that.

652
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,167
What have I done to you?

653
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:04,501
Perhaps you have targeted me

654
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:07,037
For something I've yet to do.

655
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,207
You traveled here from
some point in the future.

656
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:12,075
Catches on fast, this guy.

657
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:15,813
Visitors from another time.

658
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:17,815
Oh!

659
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:19,950
You won't be so happy when
the rest of the team shows up

660
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:22,052
And knocks that smug grin
off your face.

661
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:25,289
Oh, why wait?

662
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:30,260
A communications device
of some sort,

663
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:32,963
I imagine.

664
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:34,164
Please.

665
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,933
Contact your friends.

666
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:37,301
I'm looking forward to seeing

667
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:40,170
At least two of them again.

668
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,906
Un-believable!

669
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,441
Is that a tachyon manifold?

670
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,176
Hey, how did you find us, man?

671
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,845
You think I couldn't
build something

672
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:49,246
To track my own tracker?

673
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:50,914
Do you have any idea
what you have done?

674
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:52,449
What I've done?

675
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:54,318
You guys knocked me out.

676
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,320
Which we wouldn't have had
to do in the first place

677
00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:58,155
If you weren't
such a monumental jerk!

678
00:30:58,157 --> 00:31:01,257
Okay, uh, can I just... yeah.

679
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,294
Watch him, Sara.

680
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:06,029
Yo, you need to calm down

681
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,965
And you need to stop
yelling at yourself.

682
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:10,133
- His arrogant curiosity...
- Yeah.

683
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:12,970
He's curious and too smart
for his own good,

684
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:14,872
But I'm sure you can relate.

685
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:17,107
You're just pissed you didn't
see it coming sooner, and...

686
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:18,809
That's not it.

687
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:21,311
Although you are correct
in observing

688
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:24,348
My ire is self-directed.

689
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,316
It's a rude awakening
when one realizes

690
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:28,819
That despite decades of
what one thought

691
00:31:28,821 --> 00:31:31,421
Was maturation and experience,

692
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:35,058
You haven't really
changed at all.

693
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,494
That same arrogance I derided

694
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:39,363
In my younger self

695
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,932
Was on full display
at the weapons bazaar.

696
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:43,567
Over 60 years on this planet,

697
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,269
And I have learned nothing.

698
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:48,005
I think you're being a little
too hard on yourself.

699
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:50,474
Which makes a nice change from
you always being hard on me,

700
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:52,476
But yeah,

701
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:54,444
You're arrogant.

702
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:56,280
But you're also smart,

703
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:58,215
And kind, and selfless.

704
00:31:58,217 --> 00:32:00,150
I mean, you want
to make the world a better place

705
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:03,153
And you're willing to risk
everything to make that happen.

706
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:05,022
That?

707
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:07,124
That is not a bad guy.

708
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:10,527
And neither is this one.

709
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:13,297
Meeting Clarissa was one of
the great moments of my life,

710
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:16,934
And meeting you was another.

711
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:20,003
You are a fine young man,

712
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:21,972
Mr. Jackson.

713
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:23,173
Hey.

714
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,976
Come on.

715
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:28,912
Can someone please tell me
what's going on?

716
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,314
You didn't say
anything to him?

717
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:32,015
I figured we screwed up
the '70s enough.

718
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:33,383
Hey, w... what are you
talking about?

719
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:35,018
A... are you saying that you're...

720
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,220
Don't say another word.
Don't even think it.

721
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:39,389
You are to get off this ship,
post haste.

722
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,658
Oh, wonderful.
Another unauthorized passenger.

723
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,427
That worked out so splendidly
last time.

724
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:44,995
It's all right.
He was just leaving.

725
00:32:44,997 --> 00:32:45,996
I'll show you out.

726
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:49,933
So, have we met before?

727
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:52,469
In a manner of speaking.

728
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:56,039
Ha... have a wonderful life,
Martin.

729
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:59,109
I mean that sincerely.

730
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:04,147
I'm not even going to ask.

731
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:07,050
<i>Captain Hunter, we're getting
an incoming communiqué.</i>

732
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:09,052
<i>Mr. Snart on Mr. Rory's
comm unit.</i>

733
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:10,220
On speaker.

734
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:11,488
<i>I'll make this short.</i>

735
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,657
The owner of
the mansion we burgled

736
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,993
Is Vandal Savage.

737
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:18,061
He's really interested
in meeting you guys,

738
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:21,198
Especially our
feathered friends.

739
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,332
They have the dagger.

740
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,600
And Savage has them.

741
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:25,002
Doesn't matter.

742
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:26,303
Just get me close enough,

743
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:28,005
And I'll do
what needs to be done.

744
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:30,007
<i>I have the coordinates.</i>

745
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:32,576
Let's do this.

746
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:34,444
Your friends are cowards.

747
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:37,114
They'll be here.

748
00:33:37,116 --> 00:33:38,448
They're taking too long.

749
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,684
They need an incentive...

750
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:45,022
Oh.

751
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:46,690
The burning man.

752
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:49,426
I don't just burn, pal.

753
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:51,128
Aah!

754
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:57,567
I blast things too.

755
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:58,635
Hey, you okay?

756
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,537
I'm pissed.

757
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,406
Stand back.

758
00:34:05,144 --> 00:34:06,643
It's all good.
Savage is down.

759
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:09,179
Savage is not defeated
by earthly means.

760
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:10,547
Well, I hit him
with a nuclear blast,

761
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:13,116
So, you know, not that earthly.

762
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:19,056
Go get that son of a bitch.

763
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:21,258
Are you ready to end this?

764
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,761
We've only been waiting
4,000 years.

765
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:28,765
We got company.

766
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:30,400
Friends of Savage.

767
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,069
You'll be needing this.

768
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:35,439
Don't leave any pieces of it
behind this time.

769
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:51,054
The Aman dagger.

770
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:55,325
Of all the knives I've collected
across the centuries,

771
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:58,462
That one is my favorite.

772
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:18,682
And though my soul
departs the Earth...

773
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:19,683
Aah!

774
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:21,051
Aah!

775
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:28,725
Such a beautiful poem.

776
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:32,129
I remember it well.

777
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:33,830
Though, as you can see,

778
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:37,801
I can make the dagger
do its work without it.

779
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:39,169
Aah!

780
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:40,570
Carter!

781
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:45,075
Aah!

782
00:35:45,077 --> 00:35:47,077
This was your lover's blade.

783
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:50,347
It must be her hand
that wields it.

784
00:35:55,621 --> 00:35:58,855
Something to consider
in your next life.

785
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:02,325
Aah!

786
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:07,130
Carter.

787
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:08,665
Aah.

788
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,133
It's okay.

789
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:11,768
You're gonna be okay.

790
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,770
I will wait

791
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:15,605
Through eternity.

792
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:18,241
Please, just
save your strength.

793
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:21,478
Come back to me.

794
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,447
No...

795
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,419
Murderer.

796
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:03,887
Aah!

797
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,596
I am not a murderer.

798
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:14,197
I'm a force of nature.

799
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:17,334
A servant of fate.
I enable destiny.

800
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:19,803
Aah!

801
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:23,240
I love you, Chay-Ara.

802
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:25,475
I always will.

803
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:30,947
But we are both tortured

804
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:34,951
By this circle of death
we are imprisoned by.

805
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:43,226
Carter.

806
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:44,327
He's lost.

807
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:45,729
Get Kendra
before Savage recovers.

808
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:47,664
Come on, we can still
kill this bastard.

809
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:49,332
Kendra is
the only one who can.

810
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:51,534
We gotta go.
Kendra needs medical attention.

811
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,473
Gideon, get us underway

812
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:59,375
As soon as Firestorm and
the A.T.O.M. are onboard.

813
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:01,444
Get her to the medbay now.

814
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:05,348
I assure you, Dr. Palmer,

815
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,349
There's nothing more
you can do for her.

816
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:07,350
You can't let her die.

817
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:08,818
I don't intend to.

818
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,953
<i>Sharp force injury
resulting in rupture</i>

819
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,688
<i>Of several major blood vessels.</i>

820
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,957
<i>Her pressure is currently
82 over 30 and stable.</i>

821
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,925
<i>I will begin by
irrigating the wound</i>

822
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:18,295
<i>And cauterizing it to prevent
any further hemorrhaging.</i>

823
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:19,329
Thank you, Gideon.

824
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:20,397
Carter...

825
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:22,332
Carter... Carter...

826
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:24,664
Gideon, if you wouldn't mind
administering a mild sedative.

827
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,337
No!
Carter!

828
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:28,905
I didn't get to tell him.

829
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,807
I didn't get to tell him
it came back to me.

830
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:34,244
I finally remembered how I felt
about him in our past lives

831
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:36,646
And I didn't get to tell him!

832
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:37,981
- Shh...
- I didn't get to tell him...

833
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,783
- It's okay.
- I felt the same way.

834
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:41,351
Shh, shh...

835
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:54,764
How is she?

836
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,599
Stable, I think.

837
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:58,835
Sara told me about
what's happening with your wife.

838
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:00,770
I'm sorry.

839
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:04,040
I was so seduced by
the prospect of

840
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:06,309
Time travel, of adventure,

841
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:08,378
I never stopped to consider

842
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,814
The consequences of
what we were undertaking.

843
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:12,048
Gideon has managed to
stabilize

844
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,783
Miss Saunders's condition,

845
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:17,587
But another time jump could
aggravate her injuries.

846
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,422
So we're stuck in '75?

847
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:21,658
For the time being, yes.

848
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,427
Given that, can I have a moment
of your time, Martin?

849
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:27,430
There's something that
I would like to show you.

850
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:29,699
Of course.

851
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,005
Apparently it's true that

852
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:38,007
The guilty return
to the scene of the crime.

853
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:41,344
Oh, don't be so maudlin.
Look at your hand.

854
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:42,445
How...

855
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:43,847
I contacted your younger self

856
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:46,616
And encouraged him to attend
the faculty mixer.

857
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:49,819
Turns out one of the Professors
brought along his niece.

858
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:54,090
You risked the timeline
for me.

859
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:56,393
Hardly seemed fair
for you to sacrifice your wife

860
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:58,661
In order to save mine
from Savage's future.

861
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:00,096
One thing
that time travel teaches you

862
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:03,066
Is that time changes,

863
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,667
People don't.

864
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:08,471
A painful realization
I've recently come to.

865
00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:10,407
I have traveled countless ages
into the future.

866
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:13,009
We're still asking ourselves
the same question:

867
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:15,044
Why are we here?

868
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:18,982
I believe that we're here
to learn, Martin.

869
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:21,918
Be glad that you still can.

870
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,854
Thank you, Mr. Hunter.

871
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,029
How's Kendra?

872
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:34,531
The same.

873
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:36,499
So what now?

874
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:38,635
Now?

875
00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:39,636
Now it's up to you.

876
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:41,504
To do what, Rip?

877
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:43,406
Last I checked, every time
we try to do anything,

878
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:44,707
It all goes to crap.

879
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:46,709
Oh, once again
I must disagree with you.

880
00:40:46,711 --> 00:40:48,845
Thanks to Miss Lance,
Dr. Palmer's future technology

881
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:50,613
Is no longer in the hands
of Vandal Savage's

882
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,649
Black market weapons designers.

883
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:55,552
But it didn't do anything to
change the fate of your world.

884
00:40:55,554 --> 00:40:57,120
No.

885
00:40:57,122 --> 00:41:00,557
Vandal Savage will still rise to
power in the year 2166.

886
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:03,460
And your family
will still die?

887
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,395
So what you're
really asking is,

888
00:41:05,397 --> 00:41:07,897
Do we want to fish or cut bait?

889
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:10,934
Return to 2016 and live out
the rest of our lives

890
00:41:10,936 --> 00:41:13,536
As insignificant losers or...

891
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:15,071
Make another play
at becoming legends.

892
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:17,640
Figure out how to end Savage
and save the world.

893
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:21,077
Preferably, without causing
any more nuclear explosions.

894
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,712
Savage has my attention.

895
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:24,681
Look, we didn't know
Carter from Adam,

896
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:26,616
But if you take out
one of my crew,

897
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:29,953
You better pay the price.

898
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:33,857
Surely Captain Hunter
has a sound plan.

899
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:35,058
What about you?

900
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,993
You're asking me?

901
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,863
I didn't give you much of
a choice the first time, did I?

902
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:42,632
Well, I say
we kick Savage's ass.

903
00:41:42,634 --> 00:41:43,900
For Carter.

904
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:47,070
For Carter.

905
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:48,872
So, Captain.

906
00:41:48,874 --> 00:41:51,474
Where are we going next?

907
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:22,205
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
