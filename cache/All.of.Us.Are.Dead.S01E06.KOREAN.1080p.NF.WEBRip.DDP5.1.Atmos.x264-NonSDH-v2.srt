1
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,823
Hans Jonas discussed
the responsibilities

2
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,575
of life-related technologies.

3
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,496
I thus named the Jonas Virus
after this philosopher.

4
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,500
It's also my responsibility
to create an antidote.

5
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:45,754
I refuse to fail.

6
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:26,336
I'M SO SEXY

7
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,569
Hey, hey, hey! Help me!

8
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,699
Shit.

9
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,079
Let's go.

10
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,176
Ji-min!

11
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,636
-Stop her! Hey!
-What are you doing?

12
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,054
-Let go.
-What's with you?

13
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,222
I said let go of me!

14
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,473
Please come down.

15
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:29,435
-I want to die! Leave me alone!
-Don't be like this.

16
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,729
I don't wanna live!

17
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,732
-Ji-min. Come on.
-I want to die!

18
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,735
Please leave me alone! Please!

19
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,862
Let go of me!

20
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:44,867
Please let me go!

21
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,954
My mom and dad died.

22
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,959
What am I supposed to do alone?

23
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,590
Why would you die, you idiot?

24
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,884
What's the use in living?

25
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,928
Still, you should live, anyway.

26
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,055
I have nobody.

27
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,977
I don't have a mom or a dad.

28
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,106
I have nowhere to go
and no one waiting for me.

29
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,736
No one to scold me or praise me.

30
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,488
Do you know what that's like?

31
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,868
No, I don't.

32
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,996
Then don't act like you know everything.

33
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,206
Don't tell me what to do.

34
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,001
You don't know what it's like being me.

35
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,669
-No.
-Exactly.

36
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,088
So just leave me alone.

37
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,177
Every exam, I'm always last.

38
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,056
Well, not completely last.

39
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,144
Whenever I get my report card, my dad says

40
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,105
that my grades won't get me
into Seoul University,

41
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,149
so I shouldn't even bother having hope.

42
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,528
He says to make sure
I don't get hurt or sick.

43
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,948
To just stay healthy.

44
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:07,742
No offense.

45
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,161
I don't care about your dad.

46
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,538
I didn't believe him.

47
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,501
I'm sure he'd love it if I got into Seoul.

48
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,504
He was only saying that.

49
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,965
But…

50
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,387
He would also say to me…

51
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,185
if anything ever happens,

52
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,483
he would be the first one there for me.

53
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,944
But he's not.

54
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:46,948
He's not.

55
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,494
Who knows?

56
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,872
Maybe he can't come.

57
00:06:58,709 --> 00:06:59,836
What if my…

58
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,879
my dad died?

59
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,259
At least you can have hope.

60
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,054
My hope is dead.

61
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,434
Is there hope?

62
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,316
Is it stupid of me to wait for him?

63
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,070
Or should I run away? Give up?

64
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,157
I don't know anything.

65
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,077
Both I-sak and Gyeong-su are killed.

66
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,249
I don't want any of my friends to die.

67
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,712
Why are you crying?

68
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,630
Don't die, Ji-min.

69
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,470
I don't want my friends to keep dying.

70
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,472
No one.

71
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,230
I gotta go.

72
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,526
I feel like I'm going crazy in here.

73
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,237
Okay, then.

74
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:11,908
So let's leave.

75
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,203
I really hate it here.

76
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,458
<i>But how do we get out?</i>

77
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,961
<i>We have nowhere to go, anyway.</i>

78
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,517
Ji-min. The mic went off in there.

79
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,782
Ugh, stay!

80
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,160
Can't you people smell? It stinks.

81
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,828
Breathe through your mouth.

82
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:58,913
What is it?

83
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,543
I think I have a plan to escape.

84
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,714
This is where we are.
This is where Cheong-san is.

85
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:13,219
If we turn our music only on this speaker,
the zombies will go left.

86
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,221
Then we'll take the stairs on the right,

87
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,599
get Cheong-san, and go to the roof
using the center stairs.

88
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,018
But why the roof?

89
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,812
Choppers keep flying around.

90
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,898
If we light a roof fire,
they might come save us.

91
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:29,777
Speakers. Will the zombies really go
towards the sound?

92
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,780
I think she's right.
They're drawn to sound.

93
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,950
That's right. They come running
whenever they hear us.

94
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,911
Can we turn on only the speakers we need?

95
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,123
Yes. The ones in the cafeteria,
yard, and library, too.

96
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,708
And draw them there.

97
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,794
Nam-ra, you were
in the broadcasting club, right?

98
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,797
Uh, yeah, my mom made me.

99
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,424
That's all good, and all.

100
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,010
Where do we get music?

101
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,679
There's no internet,
so we can't stream it.

102
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,850
Right there.

103
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,396
That thing?

104
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,650
This is ancient.
Will it even work?

105
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,221
That's good.

106
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:42,975
Anyone?

107
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,479
I've never done it before.

108
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,398
<i>Somebody do it. Dae-su?</i>

109
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,692
Here goes nothing.

110
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,822
Uh, mic test. One, two. One, two.

111
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,032
Cheong-san, are you there?

112
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,618
-<i>We--</i>
-<i>What are you doing?</i>

113
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,119
<i>H-- Hey.</i>

114
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,579
Cheong-san, do you hear us?

115
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,456
It's Su-hyeok.

116
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,669
We'll come to you, so stay put.

117
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,920
<i>Got it?</i>

118
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,006
Don't come, moron. You're gonna get bit.

119
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,384
I know what you'll say,

120
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,137
but we can't hear you here.

121
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,847
What the hell are you doing, Bare-su?

122
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,017
<i>So don't go anywhere.</i>
<i>Wait for us.</i>

123
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,480
<i>You really can't go anywhere, okay?</i>

124
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,651
We'll come now.

125
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,903
All good.

126
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,155
Anyway, let's go.

127
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,740
The smell of shit makes me wanna hurl.

128
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,283
Dude, it's your shit.

129
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,911
-It's not just mine.
-Yes, it is.

130
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,038
-<i>Really?</i>
-<i>Yes.</i>

131
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,248
This can't end well.

132
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,756
<i>Cheong-san.</i>

133
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,388
<i>Please stay still.</i>

134
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,183
I know you never listen to me,
but please do it this time.

135
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,665
What's wrong?

136
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,126
-Why isn't it working?
-Beats me.

137
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,048
<i>Time for meditation.</i>

138
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,014
<i>Once again,</i>
<i>another fun day at school.</i>

139
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,772
<i>Everyone, close your eyes…</i>

140
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,733
<i>…and calm your hearts.</i>

141
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,234
Okay.

142
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,445
Broadcasting room.

143
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,412
Nam-ra, turn off the right
and middle speakers.

144
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,414
BUILDING CENTER, RIGHT, LEFT

145
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,754
Sound's distant.

146
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,298
Uh-huh. I hear it on the left.

147
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,845
-The speakers are working.
-Really?

148
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,515
It worked.

149
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,237
ONE HEART

150
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,335
Dae-su.

151
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,253
We're good.

152
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,550
-Hold on.
-Why? What?

153
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,434
There's one more.

154
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,727
Huh?

155
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,587
I'm going now.

156
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,007
<i> You must keep moving forward…</i>

157
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:43,924
Let's go.

158
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,217
Come on.

159
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,014
Check the left.

160
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,692
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

161
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:02,818
Close it. Close it.

162
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,112
Close it.

163
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,575
I could've totally died.

164
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,327
You said it was fine, you idiot.

165
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,871
-What? Where?
-There's one right outside.

166
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,290
Look right.

167
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,639
What do we do?

168
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,349
You think there's
something wrong with him?

169
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,642
Not any more than you.

170
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,644
-Rude as hell.
-Sorry.

171
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,855
Everyone else followed the sound,
but he's still there by himself.

172
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,440
Maybe he's deaf.

173
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,860
How the fuck could he hear
when the fucker's dead, huh?

174
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,655
What about the other zombies?
They all respond to sound.

175
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,157
Shit. Beats me.

176
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,159
Damn it.

177
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,286
How do we get out?

178
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,454
Hold on.

179
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,331
Let's wait a little bit.

180
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,918
I'll look.

181
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,628
Let's wait.

182
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,529
We can't be waiting.

183
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:32,658
Take the others and walk past him
as carefully as possible.

184
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,827
I'll do what I can from here.

185
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,415
All right.

186
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,461
Let's go.

187
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:52,678
<i>…will never perish</i>
<i>even when all else withers and dies.</i>

188
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,305
Hold on tight.

189
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,599
And don't let go.

190
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,857
BROADCASTING ROOM

191
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,088
Go!

192
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,368
Lee Cheong-san.

193
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,918
ROOFTOP

194
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,133
You moron.

195
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,803
Total loser, huh?

196
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,310
Thank you.

197
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,896
Of course. I saved your ass.

198
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,649
-I'm looking for Cheong-san?
-Cheong-san?

199
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,109
For what?

200
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,028
Death.

201
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,988
What do you mean?

202
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,534
I'm killing him.

203
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,336
You're badly hurt.

204
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,379
Are you okay?

205
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:17,841
I'm great.

206
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,510
I'm so fucking great.

207
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,679
So Cheong-san?

208
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:24,848
That's not funny.

209
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,812
You were always like that.

210
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,565
Isn't that right?

211
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,110
"Do this."

212
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,154
"Don't do that."

213
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,365
Always ordering me around.

214
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,701
It's okay, though.

215
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,746
You fought better than I did.

216
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,708
But you can't do that anymore.

217
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,055
You're nothing special.

218
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,380
You're scared?

219
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,506
That's okay.

220
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:41,925
Hey.

221
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,386
Aren't you scared?

222
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,681
Crazy asshole.

223
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,727
Weak asshole.

224
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,909
You little shithead.

225
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,202
Leave her alone!

226
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,014
Let's go.

227
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,270
Hurry up.

228
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,649
Here comes one. Run!

229
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,823
Shit, what's the code?

230
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,786
-Three-two-one-zero!
-Three-two-two-zero?

231
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,412
Three-two-one-zero!

232
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,706
Shit. Three, two…

233
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,293
What is it again?

234
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,669
Three-two-one-zero!

235
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,630
Three, two…

236
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,641
It worked! It's open!

237
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,642
Hey! Hurry!

238
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,564
Hurry! Joon-seong!

239
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,942
Help me!

240
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,610
Come on!

241
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,029
What are you waiting for? Hurry!

242
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,323
Hurry!

243
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,158
Get in here!

244
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,585
I'm tired as shit.

245
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,631
-Shit.
-You're crying?

246
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,884
You're crying?

247
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,095
Embarrassing.

248
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,723
Oh, god!

249
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,100
What happened to you, huh?

250
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,477
How do I fix it?

251
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,478
Let me see.

252
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,439
Wait. You're stabbed?

253
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,234
Why are you getting stabbed and shit?

254
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,698
Get the first aid kit.
I said get the first aid kit!

255
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,741
Where is the kit?

256
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,621
Oh, shit.

257
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,957
Where were you?

258
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:20,876
Cheong-san.

259
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:22,919
Where's On-jo?

260
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,590
On-jo!

261
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,010
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

262
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,761
Hurt as hell.

263
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,348
How did you guys know I was here?

264
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,433
Aah!

265
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,478
I told you not to go.

266
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,271
Why don't you ever listen to me?

267
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,690
Hey, save the lovers' quarrel for later.

268
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,525
-Huh?
-Let's go.

269
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,320
-Where?
-We have to get to the roof

270
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,739
-before the meditation music ends.
-Let's go. Hurry.

271
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:51,656
Wait.

272
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,950
Where's Su-hyeok? Su-hyeok isn't here.

273
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,496
-Where are you going?
-Hey! Hey! Hey!

274
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,145
Are you crazy? Don't go by yourself.

275
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,481
-Go in! Go inside!
-They're coming.

276
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,733
Hurry!

277
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,071
The curtains. Come on.

278
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,497
There's a zombie there.

279
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,833
It's caught under a piano,
so it can't go anywhere.

280
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:55,845
We can't…

281
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,015
go to the roof?

282
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,978
We're trapped again, aren't we?

283
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,356
There are zombies out there, so…

284
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,484
Let's just think a little.

285
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,485
This is so annoying.

286
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:20,996
Hey.

287
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:22,747
Hey, Nam-ra.

288
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,334
What happened to your arm?

289
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,212
That's a bite mark, isn't it?

290
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,329
I can't eat pork. Is there anything else?

291
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,831
Take it and go!

292
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,249
-Hold on.
-Go on. Get out of here.

293
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,334
I can't eat pork!

294
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:10,211
-Come on, we're all waiting.
-That's enough!

295
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,477
I'm good.

296
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,354
Are the cell phones working in here?

297
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:31,024
No. There won't be service here.

298
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,235
So you're telling me…

299
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,822
a politician can't talk
a way out of here?

300
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,326
It's true.

301
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,453
I've never been treated this way before.

302
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:46,289
There's nothing politicians
can't do in our country, right?

303
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,624
Don't be sarcastic.

304
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,251
I've never done anything illegal.

305
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,796
Never did anything improper my whole life.

306
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,589
Then can't you do it just this one time?

307
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,424
I really need to leave.

308
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:58,802
Wait a little.

309
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,513
I'll get you a helicopter
after we're tested,

310
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,348
and send you to your daughter's school.

311
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,641
The test isn't the problem.

312
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,977
Even if we test negative,
we'll still have to quarantine here.

313
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,939
It was nine days for MERS,
two weeks for Covid-19,

314
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,816
and even three weeks for Ebola.

315
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,567
And then what?

316
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,986
Are you saying we have to stay here
even after we get tested?

317
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,572
It depends what they consider
the incubation period is.

318
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,166
Please eat as much as possible,

319
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,544
and leave your empty food containers
by the door.

320
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,129
Hold on.

321
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,007
Special Mission?

322
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,176
I was a Master Sergeant when I left.

323
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,887
Are you our senior officer?

324
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,265
He was also Special Mission Unit.

325
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,433
Nice to meet you.

326
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,728
Sorry. I'd buy you a drink
if we had met outside.

327
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,020
It's fine.

328
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:54,107
Tell me, how long are they considering
for quarantine?

329
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,483
We don't know, sir.

330
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,693
Sure you do.

331
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:57,694
It's true.

332
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,989
They don't know what this virus is,
so they don't know the incubation period.

333
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,409
From what I hear, they're thinking
a minimum of, I don't know, four weeks.

334
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:07,245
What? That means we have
to be here for at least a month!

335
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,997
Wait until you get tested.

336
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,998
Wait a minute.

337
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,501
-Yes, sir.
-Well…

338
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,795
I'm sorry,

339
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,382
but I have to get out of here
much sooner than that.

340
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:21,885
Sir.

341
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:25,597
Even judges and prosecutors
are standing by and waiting.

342
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,015
Connections don't work here.

343
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,893
I know. And I'm very sorry.

344
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,771
-I sincerely apologize.
-For what?

345
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,905
What good do you think that's gonna do?

346
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,744
Why are you doing this?

347
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,211
Ma'am, I'm really sorry.
I have to get to the school.

348
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,963
I already said I'd follow protocol
and help you.

349
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,467
Those protocols kept me
from saving too many lives.

350
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,682
I'm leaving.

351
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,894
Please help them out,
so they are not punished,

352
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,813
not too severely at least.

353
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,733
You create this mess,
but you want me to clean it up?

354
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,282
I know you're a mother as well.

355
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,701
I'm a father.

356
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,254
Hey.

357
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,421
Why did you do that?

358
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,007
What? He… He tried to get up.

359
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:45,718
So what now?

360
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,971
Don't even think about coming with me.

361
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,890
You want me to stay here
after what I've done?

362
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,633
We can't go that way.

363
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,941
There are no kids
in school uniforms.

364
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,194
No one got out.

365
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,780
No one saved them.

366
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,784
No.

367
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,161
That's not it.

368
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,412
Move. Step back, Su-hyeok.

369
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,164
That's not it, asshole.

370
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,625
Tell him.

371
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,710
You weren't bitten by a zombie.

372
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,136
Say something.

373
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,096
Gwi-nam.

374
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,974
He bit her. It wasn't zombies.

375
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,100
Who?

376
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,394
Gwi-nam. The bully.

377
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,313
-Yoon Gwi-nam?
-Yeah.

378
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,233
Nam-ra. Did Gwi-nam really bite you?

379
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,196
Say it clearly.

380
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,781
It's true.

381
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,578
Gwi-nam was bitten by zombies.

382
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,376
Bullshit.

383
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,086
I saw him get bit.

384
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,838
If you get bitten by zombies,
you turn into one.

385
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,715
-So if Gwi-nam bit her--
-He's not one of them.

386
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,306
Gwi-nam wasn't a zombie.

387
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,685
He wasn't.

388
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,187
He literally talked to me.

389
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,816
You saw him. He wasn't a zombie at all.

390
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,071
Are you sure he was bitten by a zombie?

391
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,406
Yeah.

392
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,409
So I'll turn into a zombie.

393
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,619
You won't.

394
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,206
I…

395
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,293
Never mind. So be it.

396
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,963
Su-hyeok, thank you.

397
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,174
Hold on, prez.

398
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,516
I wonder why you never called me
by my name.

399
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,526
You won't.

400
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,408
She won't turn into one.

401
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,118
Don't you trust me?

402
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,580
I saw when Gwi-nam got bitten.

403
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,959
-It happened after fighting with me.
-I fought him, too. Believe me.

404
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,586
I know.

405
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,896
You see?

406
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,859
If she turns, I'll throw her
out the window, so she can't attack you.

407
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,237
So back off.

408
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,449
-Su-hyeok.
-Back off, asshole.

409
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,869
You shouldn't do this.

410
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,914
I owe it to you.

411
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,090
Don't come closer.

412
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,343
I'm warning you.

413
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,012
Screw you.

414
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,348
I warned you first.

415
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,225
Get lost.

416
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,476
Gyeong-su was enough.

417
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,479
I won't lose any more friends.

418
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,943
Get out of my way.

419
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:14,904
I said to stop it--

420
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,197
Get out of my way!

421
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,740
Stop it, both of you!

422
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,800
If I feel strange in any way…

423
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,180
I'll just end it quickly.

424
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:44,767
Sorry, but--

425
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,227
No need to be sorry.

426
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,523
I'm actually not sorry, not at all.

427
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,152
Sorry.

428
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,696
Su-hyeok.

429
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,574
Kill me if I turn.

430
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:02,869
Hey! Hey!

431
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,264
That's enough.

432
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,308
She should've turned by now.

433
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,393
Not yet.

434
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,606
She was bitten by Gwi-nam,
so she should be fine.

435
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,941
He was bitten by zombies.

436
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,694
Su-hyeok says he wasn't.

437
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,530
I saw it with my own eyes.

438
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,824
Su-hyeok has no reason to lie.

439
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,993
And you're telling me that I do?

440
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,703
Su-hyeok was saying--

441
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,705
I know you like him, but…

442
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,916
This is a little more important,
don't you think?

443
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,629
Why would you bring that up?

444
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,049
Because you always take his side.

445
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,011
I don't do that.

446
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,304
Yes, you do.

447
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,702
Does it hurt a lot?

448
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,039
I said we shouldn't come out!

449
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,167
I said we would all die!

450
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,127
We stopped the bleeding
and sterilized the wound.

451
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,587
So you'll be fine
once you get to a hospital.

452
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,423
How can I go to a hospital right now?

453
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,675
What a joke.

454
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,510
Stop complaining. You'll be fine.

455
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,554
It's all your fault.
It's your fault.

456
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,891
Just stop crying. Fuck!

457
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,105
Hey. Anything?

458
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,070
Of course, it's broken.
I said it wouldn't work, didn't I?

459
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,823
How annoying can you be? You won't die!

460
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,725
<i>Su-hyeok.</i>

461
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,269
<i>Su-hyeok.</i>

462
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,106
<i>I feel weird. I'm hungry.</i>

463
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:42,987
<i>Su-hyeok.</i>

464
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,907
<i>Why do you smell so good?</i>

465
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:58,377
Nam-ra.

466
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,464
Su-hyeok!

467
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,821
Get out of the way!

468
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,865
-Stop it.
-Get back now!

469
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,244
I said to stop it!

470
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,371
Stupid asshole!

471
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,670
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Cut it out.
Stop it already!

472
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,631
-Let go! Let go of me!
-They're going to come in!

473
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,508
Don't do it!

474
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,843
Get out of my way! Let go of me!

475
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:51,013
Stop it. Are you blind? Look at Nam-ra.

476
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,016
She would have blood
on her mouth if she bit him.

477
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,690
Does she?

478
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,402
And he's not bleeding, right?

479
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,404
It's true. There's no wound.

480
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,698
But if Gwi-nam bit her--

481
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,700
She's still fine,
which means you'll be fine.

482
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,957
Come on, put that down.

483
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:20,960
Stop being stubborn.

484
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,551
Let go.

485
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,470
I got it. Let go. Fuck.

486
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,599
Why won't you drop that?

487
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,477
That's my business.

488
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:54,827
Are you okay?

489
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,289
-Why do you care?
-What?

490
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:00,666
It's weird.

491
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,169
You've always hated me.

492
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,008
Sometimes, I still do.

493
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,928
What's wrong is wrong, though.

494
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:23,314
She seems fine. Let's…

495
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,316
She would've definitely turned by now.

496
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:26,775
No.

497
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:34,783
I'm not okay. I wanted to bite Su-hyeok.

498
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,076
That's not true.

499
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,120
Stop that.

500
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,955
I really did.

501
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,791
I wanted to bite him.

502
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,668
Wait, what do you mean by that?

503
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,337
I mean…

504
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,591
I wanted to bite him.

505
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:00,017
I shouldn't stay with you any longer.

506
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,520
If I hadn't come to my senses,
I would've bitten him.

507
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,314
Hey, come on, stop that.
What's wrong with you?

508
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,193
I'll go.

509
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,569
Please wait.

510
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,199
You saw Gwi-nam get bitten by zombies?

511
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,700
I told you a hundred times, yes.

512
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,452
And you saw Gwi-nam turn?

513
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,871
No, I didn't.

514
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,498
I was busy running away.

515
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,670
Su-hyeok, you definitely fought Gwi-nam?

516
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,214
Yes, I did.

517
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,510
There's no reason for either to lie.

518
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,555
Maybe Gwi-nam was bitten,
but was not affected.

519
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,891
In the movies, there are always people
who are immune, remember?

520
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,852
Still, she tried to bite him.

521
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,855
She could have bitten him for real.

522
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,733
Regardless, she isn't normal.

523
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:51,944
So I'm not going with her.

524
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,070
Ji-min, stop.

525
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,072
What? Are you saying that I'm wrong?

526
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,243
Maybe.

527
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,205
I really don't know what we should do.

528
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,332
We can't pretend she's fine.

529
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,834
Enough.

530
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,715
Please don't fight.

531
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,514
Leaving will solve everything.

532
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,646
Don't go. Where would you go?

533
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,356
Stop it.

534
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,274
Please.

535
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,779
I don't want anyone dying.

536
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:44,830
Hyeon-ju and I-sak…

537
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,750
They're hands were very cold
before they turned.

538
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,630
Nam-ra's hands are warm.

539
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,381
She isn't a zombie.

540
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,343
So cut it out,
and let's talk how to get to the roof.

541
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,136
-No.
-Ji-min!

542
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,304
No way!

543
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:03,390
She may be fine now,
but who knows what's gonna happen

544
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,475
when she turns?

545
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:08,270
Guys, say something. This is wrong.

546
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,606
She said herself
that she wanted to bite him.

547
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:13,025
She has zombie blood in her veins.

548
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,361
Zombies killed my mom and dad.

549
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,113
My mom.

550
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,588
Hey.

551
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,508
Give me your hand.

552
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,636
-What are you doing?
-Tying a knot.

553
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,682
Stop it. Stop.

554
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:48,560
Hold still.

555
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,618
Happy? This way,
she can't get to you if she turns.

556
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,288
I'll get bitten instead.

557
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,729
What are you going to do?

558
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:32,855
I have to go.

559
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,441
Be back in a minute.

560
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,658
It's probably not gonna start, you know?

561
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,786
Why are you so damn pessimistic, huh?

562
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,914
The earlier one was in an accident.
That's obviously fine.

563
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,500
How are we gonna fit two people
on that thing?

564
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,669
Try three.

565
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,798
You wanna take the baby with you?

566
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:03,385
If we leave the baby here,
it won't survive.

567
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,269
Here.

568
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:15,564
Sit in the back and kill anyone
who gets too close. Okay?

569
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,817
Oh, I can't go. There's no way.

570
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,570
You coward.
You wanna be reported for desertion?

571
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,615
Fine, go ahead.

572
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,826
Given the situation I'm currently in,
the court will agree

573
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,369
these were extenuating circumstances.

574
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,746
-Court?
-Yeah.

575
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,122
-Circumstances?
-Yeah.

576
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,583
You're smart.

577
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,794
Yes, I am. I go to Seoul University.

578
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,463
Okay, then, I'll break
all the windows on my way out,

579
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:40,881
so that they can get in.

580
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,427
Oh! All right!
All right! I'll go. I'll go.

581
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,351
Seriously?

582
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,396
A person should use his head.

583
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,525
We need to stay alive
to tell anyone about the laptop.

584
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:00,901
CHEONG-SAN CHICKEN

585
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,908
What's going on?

586
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,118
Hey. Hey.

587
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,995
Come here!

588
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:28,512
You said we were going,
so we should've just gone.

589
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,473
Are you going to save
everyone in the world?

590
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,308
-Are you the spirit of God?
-Police officer.

591
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,060
Damn it.

592
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,274
-Take the baby.
-Okay.

593
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:43,026
The baby.

594
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,486
Are you okay?

595
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,321
Are you hurt anywhere?

596
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:48,991
Mommy.

597
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:54,246
-Mommy is over there.
-Where?

598
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:55,873
Where's Mama?

599
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,294
Is…

600
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,795
Is that your mom?

601
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,047
The one in red?

602
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:13,724
Sir. I don't know how to hold babies.

603
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:16,351
This baby keeps smiling.

604
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,228
-What do I do? What do I do?
-Wait a minute.

605
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,648
Stay still for one minute.

606
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,337
What is wrong with this world?

607
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,489
It will be okay.

608
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:14,826
If Nam-ra's immune,
does that mean she's okay

609
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:16,995
even if she gets bitten?

610
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,539
-Probably.
-Oh, shit.

611
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,999
That's not fair.

612
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,044
She still has zombie blood in her veins.

613
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,421
She isn't completely a zombie.

614
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,007
A half-bie?

615
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,217
What's half-bie?

616
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,510
Short for half zombie?

617
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:32,469
Really?

618
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,929
It's like half and half.

619
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,806
Like half spicy, half fried… Oh!

620
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,308
-I want chicken.
-That's enough, Dae-su.

621
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,686
We haven't had water for two days.

622
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,605
Is it true we'll die
if we don't have water for three days?

623
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,359
I don't know.
Please don't talk to me. I'm too hungry.

624
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:51,863
Dae-su, don't you want that soda
we had on our way to school?

625
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,657
Oh!

626
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,409
-Don't you want it so bad?
-Yes.

627
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,621
I want Hot Six with Pocari.

628
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:02,624
I'll see your soda,
Hot Six, and Pocari,

629
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,210
and raise you an iced vanilla latte.

630
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:07,587
How could you think about food
with a zombie here?

631
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,048
Stop it. Nam-ra isn't a zombie.

632
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,008
Half-bie.

633
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,217
Close enough.

634
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,011
Let's not do this to ourselves.

635
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,388
We're all we've got now.

636
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:20,517
She's right.
Nam-ra is better than Na-yeon.

637
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,311
Don't even say her name.
She's subhuman.

638
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:26,606
Gyeong-su died, because of her,
and Miss Park…

639
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,691
That's true.

640
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:32,320
If it weren't for Na-yeon,
they'd be here with us right now.

641
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,489
Wait a sec.

642
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:37,868
The PTA asked the parents
to send some stuff before the competition,

643
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,037
and asked my mom to send some chicken.

644
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,038
Chicken?

645
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,249
We would've seen it
if it were here.

646
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,834
I don't see anything.

647
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:48,754
Hold on.

648
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:52,716
Shit. Maybe it's in there.

649
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,134
Hey, hey.

650
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,927
-What?
-We don't know what's in there.

651
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,096
We need to eat and survive first.

652
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:03,018
-Damn it. It's locked.
-It's locked, goddamn it.

653
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:07,314
Let's open it.

654
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,900
Find something
to pick the lock with.

655
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,194
Look for something. Hurry.

656
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,332
What do you think?

657
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:28,335
-That wall is our only way out, right?
-Yes. That's our best option.

658
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,838
Security is insane.
We're completely trapped.

659
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,382
-Let's go over it.
-Are you sure?

660
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:37,761
-We'll be seen for sure.
-That's the only way.

661
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:44,851
RESTRICTED AREA
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

662
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,468
The line.

663
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,430
Drop me a line.

664
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:29,187
-U-sin.
-Yes?

665
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,189
Just…

666
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,400
Stay alive.

667
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:36,319
Are you insane? Take me with you, please.

668
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,531
Captain! Captain!

669
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,034
Captain!

670
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,665
Freeze.

671
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:50,375
Freeze!

672
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,752
What are you doing?

673
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,590
Stop right there.

674
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,258
What the hell?

675
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,093
I said to freeze.

676
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,512
I'm on patrol, moron.

677
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,725
Which unit are you with?

678
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:09,144
-Sorry.
-Pardon?

679
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,039
Nothing?

680
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,541
Should we knock it down?

681
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,547
Damn it.

682
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,926
PTA DONATIONS

683
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,058
Hey. Take it easy.

684
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:58,735
Hey. Keep it down! You gotta be quiet.

685
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,072
Hey.

686
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,240
Hey, stop doing that.

687
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,454
It won't work.

688
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:10,789
What a waste of energy.

689
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,425
And please, no music.

690
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,951
My mom and dad…

691
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,747
They came to the school to save me.

692
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,126
The police…

693
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,171
and firefighters never came.

694
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:05,510
If anybody is watching this after,

695
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,429
punish them.

696
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,889
All involved.

697
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:13,852
They abandoned us.

698
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,021
All of them.

699
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,233
I'll make you pay.

700
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,163
Hi, Mom.

701
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,333
Hi, Dad.

702
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,630
I'll stay alive and get revenge.

703
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,719
I'll kill all the zombies…

704
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,848
and anyone else.

705
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:19,250
Mom.

706
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,336
And Dad.

707
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,338
Hello.

708
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,927
I'm here with some of my classmates
and they're really good to me.

709
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,555
Let me just show you. This is them.

710
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:41,773
Uh…

711
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,609
Um…

712
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:45,819
Mom, Dad…

713
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,073
I miss you.

714
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,243
I miss you both.

715
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,538
And, um…

716
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,458
I'm so sorry.

717
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,344
Um, give it to me.

718
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:23,231
Hey, Mom.

719
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,483
I want a raise in allowance.

720
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,280
-Is it ready to go?
-Yes.

721
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:36,369
Music and lyrics
by intergalactic superstar Yang Dae-su.

722
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,413
Beat.

723
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:57,599
Cheong-san?

724
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:14,365
Mom.

725
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:17,452
It's me.

726
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,871
Dad, you're okay too, right?

727
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:23,333
I'm…

728
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:26,586
I'm good.

729
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:53,738
Hi, Dad.

730
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:55,865
I miss you.

731
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,786
You're not here,
but I waited for you all night,

732
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,538
and we're holding on together.

733
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,085
You always say being healthy
is better than getting good grades.

734
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,721
You said you'd be the first to come
if anything ever happened.

735
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,184
And you're okay, right?

736
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,945
You have to be okay, Dad.

737
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,614
You don't have to come save me, but…

738
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,914
But still, I wish you'd come.

739
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:53,047
I really thought you would be here by now.

740
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:11,899
But I'm okay.

741
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,949
Usually, I save this for my allowance.

742
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,495
But I'll say it for free here.

743
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:27,915
Dad, I…

744
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:30,543
I love you.

745
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,257
<i>I love you.</i>

746
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:41,512
I really love you.

747
