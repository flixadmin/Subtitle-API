Yup. Just when I forgot how awkward it was
to walk in on you two.

You can get used to it again.

-It's Ronnie.

-Yeah, if I was the one holding the controller.
-Meaning?

83
00:04:55,742 --> 00:04:58,203
Meaning you weren't
the most conscientious body-mate.

84
00:04:58,536 --> 00:05:02,373 X1:0
So you do not consider keeping you alive
to be conscientious?

85
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,043 X1:0
Alive? We were living under a bridge
eating garbage.

that would dominate our existence...

...but thank God it was.

88
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:16,471
I could feel your fear and panic, emotions
that would have gotten us killed in that state.

89
00:05:16,638 --> 00:05:20,308 X1:0
You kept me buried down.
You kept me from her.

90
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:23,728 X1:0
Which is likely why she's still alive.

00:05:24,145 --> 00:05:26,898 X1:0

133

No, Barry, not that you. This you.

137
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,072
Cisco had the samples analyzed...

138
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,075
...and the proteins in the blood
were that of an adult...

139

...not a child.

140
00:08:40,996 --> 00:08:42,080

Time travel.

00:08:57,553 --> 00:09:02,224
If the last five months have proven anything,
it's that anything can exist.

146
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:04,268
But to actually travel through time?

147
00:09:04,435 --> 00:09:06,937 X1:0
Well, the greatest minds in human history...

148
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,939 X1:0
...put their collective genius towards
solving that puzzle.

149
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:12,108
So is it possible?

150
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:14,110
Yes, it's possible.

151
00:09:14,277 --> 00:09:16,446
But problematic. I mean...

152
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:20,742
...assuming you could create the conditions
necessary to take that journey...

153
00:09:20,908 --> 00:09:23,536
...that journey would be fraught
with potential pitfalls.

for example--

155
00:09:26,414 --> 00:09:27,622
Wait, the what now?

156
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:30,166 X1:0
If you travel back in time
to change something...

157
00:09:30,374 --> 00:09:34,503 X1:0
...then you end up being
the causal factor of that event.

00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:36,714
-Like <i>Terminator.</i>
-Ah.

159
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:39,592
Or is time plastic? Is it mutable...

160
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:43,429
...whereby any changes to the continuum
could create an alternate timeline?

161
00:09:44,138 --> 00:09:45,848
<i>-Back to the Future.</i>
-Oh.

00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:50,603
-I saw that one too.
-"Doc Brown." Tremendous picture.

163
00:09:51,187 --> 00:09:53,564
Right. So, what's the answer?

164
00:09:54,106 --> 00:09:57,443
I might be a clever guy, but if you're
asking me to give you a theory...

165
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,779
...on how to travel through time,
I'm afraid I just can't do that.

Why do you have a blueprint
of the S.T.A.R. Labs' particle accelerator?

-Do you know anything about physics?
-Not a thing. Might as well be in Dothraki.

170
00:10:20,757 --> 00:10:23,802
So, what more is there
with the S.T.A.R. Labs story?

171
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,348
The only new information is Wells admitted
he was warned of a potential disaster.

172
00:10:28,807 --> 00:10:29,849
Yeah.

173
00:10:30,058 --> 00:10:31,934
Why do you think he did that?

174
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:34,853
Because he's a good person?

175
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,188
-Is he?
-Yes.

176
00:10:37,022 --> 00:10:38,690
He saved my friend's life.

177
00:10:38,857 --> 00:10:42,444
He was struck by lightning
and Dr. Wells and his team kept him alive.

178
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:46,698
So your friend wouldn't need saving
if Wells hadn't zapped him in the first place.

-It was an accident.

the particle accelerator to explode?

-Don't know what goes on in that building.

A few?

211
00:12:29,128 --> 00:12:32,173
See, I believe that space-time...

212
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:37,178
...is a free-flowing highway
that intersects the physical world.

We live in the moments
between the on and off ramps.

214
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:43,226
Theoretically, to travel through time...

215
00:12:43,434 --> 00:12:46,479
...one merely needs to find a way
onto the highway.

216
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:51,359
Okay. So you're saying that this is actually
possible, to travel into the future?

217
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:53,151
Undoubtedly.

Yes.

220
00:12:56,111 --> 00:13:00,658
My own personal choice
would be the Chicago World's Fair, 1893.

221
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:04,370
I think Nikola Tesla and I,
we'd have some wonderful arguments.

in taking a trip into history?

you actually move so fast...

...that the resulting kinetic energy buildup...

232
