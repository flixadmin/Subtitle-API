1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,789
More.

2
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,429
Another.

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,874
Careful, señor.

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,311
Hot day like today...

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,550
...too much oil in the machine...

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,151
...can cause it to blow a gasket.

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,991
There are two kinds of men
in this world.

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,749
Those who drink...

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,751
...and those who pour.

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,797
Shut up and fill my glass.

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,715
Hey, you two.

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,269
Yes, you.

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,918
I used to be just like you.

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,312
Worked dirt for the man
till my hands bled.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,109
But no more.

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,553
Because I learned that a man
can never drink his fill...

17
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,712
...by waiting in line for the tap.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,389
Listen to him.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,199
He can teach you something!

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,635
Hey, how you doing, boss?

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,558
Good to see you, my friend.

22
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,755
You know, I never pegged you
for such a deep thinker.

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,952
I keep thinking I should write a book.

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,111
Maybe, maybe...

25
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,078
So, what brings you to this
burro's asshole of a town?

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,436
I knew I would find you here.

27
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,190
Don't you have something to deliver?

28
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,273
Cutting it close, aren't you?

29
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,876
Lots of time.

30
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,150
Tortuga may be slow out of the gate,
but he always...

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,554
Finishes first.

32
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,916
Yes, I know.
Just like your namesake.

33
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,278
I like the way you talk, Tortuga.

34
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,112
Yeah?

35
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,669
You've got such a way with words.

36
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,868
They flow like a waterfall.

37
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,674
I like that about you.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,471
I'm so stupid.
I missed your birthday.

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,519
No, I feel terrible.

40
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,070
So bad I came all the way here
to this burro's asshole...

41
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,793
...to give you your present.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,989
Present?

43
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,958
Come on, boss.
No need to go through the trouble.

44
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,276
Forget it, I wanted to.

45
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,239
I have it for you in the back.

46
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,950
- Back there?
- Yes. Come. Follow me.

47
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,398
It's perfect!

48
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,239
Do you really like it?

49
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,037
I love it!

50
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,316
What a great pet it will make.

51
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,794
Thank you, boss!

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,319
Excellent.

53
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,836
Let me sign it for you.

54
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,469
Let me sign it...

55
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,390
..."For the big talker."

56
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,599
Gentlemen. Welcome.

57
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,833
Thank you for coming.

58
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,277
Any difficulty at the border?

59
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,637
The day I can't get across the border
is the day I retire.

60
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,393
Please, come in.

61
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,155
I apologise that it's not
wheelchair accessible.

62
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,595
My apologies, Gustavo.

63
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,916
Of course,
you should have been advised.

64
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,072
It's your territory,
you had a right to bless the order.

65
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,428
We had no reason to believe
the man was of concern to you.

66
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,995
Indeed, he is.

67
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,240
So you're in business with
this Heisenberg.

68
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,995
I don't know him by that name, but yes.

69
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,071
I've made no secret of the fact that...

70
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,392
...I have always done business
with certain local manufacturers.

71
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,077
You and I,
we still make money together.

72
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,113
It's never affected our relationship.

73
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,432
Don Salamanca had a
nephew named Tuco.

74
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,949
Yes, I knew of him.

75
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,074
Then perhaps you know Don Salamanca
mentored him in the business.

76
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,234
Thought of Tuco as a son.

77
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,429
When Don Salamanca was no longer
able, Tuco took over for his uncle.

78
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,677
He was a key man in our
organisation north of the border.

79
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,919
He was loyal.

80
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,631
This Heisenberg, Walter White...

81
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,269
...he was one of Tuco's local suppliers.

82
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,477
Until he betrayed Tuco.

83
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,632
So now you see,
blood must be repaid by blood.

84
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,438
Tuco's cousins here...

85
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,238
...they have the right
to exact vengeance.

86
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,909
The Salamanca family, the cartel...

87
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,878
...everyone stands shoulder
to shoulder on this.

88
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,749
Don Salamanca.

89
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,839
Gentlemen.

90
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,230
I feel your loss deeply.

91
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,831
Please accept my condolences.

92
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,036
I have no issue with
your right to vengeance.

93
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,754
But I am presently engaged in
business with this man.

94
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,999
When our business is done...

95
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,831
...he will no longer be
of any concern to me.

96
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,433
Until then...

97
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,469
...I need him alive.

98
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,917
Excuse us.

99
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,234
I don't tell you how to
fry your chickens, Gustavo.

100
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,796
You should really leave matters
of my organisation's politics to me.

101
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,231
Do I not run my own territory?

102
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,753
Of course you do.

103
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,878
And I will advise them to be patient.

104
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,237
But I recommend you finish your
business with the man quickly.

105
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,114
Or you risk losing the
good graces of the cartel.

106
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,318
That would not be wise.

107
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,669
And those boys inside...

108
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,350
...I cannot guarantee
that they will listen.

109
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,839
They are not like you and I.
