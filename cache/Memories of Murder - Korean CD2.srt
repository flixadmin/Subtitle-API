1
00:00:55,335 --> 00:00:56,324
Stop there!

2
00:00:58,304 --> 00:00:59,293
Hey, you!

3
00:01:21,394 --> 00:01:22,725
It's getting narrow!

4
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:24,194
Single file!

5
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:51,417
Miss, did a strange man
just run past here?

6
00:01:51,524 --> 00:01:54,322
No.

7
00:01:54,427 --> 00:01:56,861
- It's that policeman.
- What?

8
00:01:56,963 --> 00:01:59,898
- At the guard post.
- You know him?

9
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,468
Damn, he's a
fast little bastard.

10
00:02:05,905 --> 00:02:07,304
He's not there?

11
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:14,507
Did you check the
alleys properly?

12
00:02:14,614 --> 00:02:16,673
You think you
know this village?

13
00:02:17,683 --> 00:02:19,310
You stepped on a
stick back there.

14
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:21,910
A stick or a shit pile, who cares?

15
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:24,012
He stepped on it.

16
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,357
What?

17
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:34,460
Over there... Hey, you!

18
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:54,246
Stop!

19
00:02:54,353 --> 00:02:57,447
Jesus, not again.

20
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:01,082
Hey, over there.

21
00:03:28,855 --> 00:03:31,517
Black clothes, black clothes...

22
00:03:32,024 --> 00:03:33,992
Everyone's in black except you.

23
00:03:45,538 --> 00:03:47,301
Everybody stop!

24
00:03:50,676 --> 00:03:52,906
Don't move an inch!

25
00:04:16,903 --> 00:04:18,666
- Inspector Jo!
- Yes?

26
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,629
Gather them together.

27
00:04:25,177 --> 00:04:26,804
Hey, stop.

28
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:28,744
Gather together.

29
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:30,973
Lift up your heads.

30
00:04:31,884 --> 00:04:33,181
Everyone stand in line.

31
00:04:50,236 --> 00:04:53,637
Look in my eyes.

32
00:04:55,308 --> 00:04:56,502
Give me that.

33
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:11,248
What is it?

34
00:05:14,193 --> 00:05:15,626
You bastard!

35
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:17,753
- Give me your hands!
- What are you doing?

36
00:05:17,863 --> 00:05:22,232
You ran away from us?

37
00:05:44,357 --> 00:05:45,949
But...

38
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:49,859
Is jerking off a crime?

39
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:52,294
It's not a crime.

40
00:05:52,398 --> 00:05:54,798
Why'd you run away?

41
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:58,894
Someone jumped out
of the woods and ran at me,

42
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:00,996
so I panicked.

43
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:05,601
Sure, but why'd you go
all the way out there to do it?

44
00:06:05,712 --> 00:06:09,170
There are kids at home,

45
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:12,774
and the air's nice in the woods.

46
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:17,447
Or did you go back to
fantasize about the dead girls?

47
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:24,824
Your husband likes
to go out at night, huh?

48
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:28,627
What's this?

49
00:06:29,702 --> 00:06:30,634
Gimme that.

50
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,770
What did you make these with?

51
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:55,085
These days, you know,

52
00:06:55,194 --> 00:07:00,962
real events in our town are
stronger than the magazines.

53
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:03,865
When I read the newspaper,

54
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,268
I start fantasizing.

55
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:08,499
I ask myself why I do this,

56
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:15,172
but when will this
chance come again?

57
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:17,806
According to neighbors,

58
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:20,715
he looks diligently
after his sick wife,

59
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,913
never misses a week at church,

60
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:25,923
that he's honest.

61
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,453
All perverts are like that.

62
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:31,530
Nice on the outside.

63
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:34,623
But my eyes can't be fooled.

64
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:36,565
One look, and I know.

65
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,270
Honey,

66
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:44,309
I put socks in here.
Change them after dinner.

67
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,968
Don't forget, or they'll smell.

68
00:07:46,078 --> 00:07:49,070
I'll take care of it.
Go feed the kids.

69
00:07:49,982 --> 00:07:52,041
Watch out for protesters.

70
00:07:54,153 --> 00:07:57,680
Release Jo Byung-soon!

71
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,552
What now?

72
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:00,683
I heard Byung-soon
confessed last night.

73
00:08:00,793 --> 00:08:02,055
Who says so?

74
00:08:02,161 --> 00:08:04,356
Oh, Chief!

75
00:08:08,468 --> 00:08:10,402
When will you make
an announcement?

76
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:13,563
We know nothing.
Just wait a bit more.

77
00:08:13,673 --> 00:08:16,233
You've held him 4 days
without a warrant.

78
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:19,209
People are saying he's
detained illegally.

79
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:24,507
This time be realistic,
like in a movie.

80
00:08:25,585 --> 00:08:26,574
Go!

81
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,315
You did a good job just now.

82
00:08:29,422 --> 00:08:30,446
Yong-ku?

83
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,662
So, you were hiding
behind the outhouse,

84
00:08:38,764 --> 00:08:40,391
and you saw
Park Myung-ja

85
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,163
coming towards you
with a flashlight, right?

86
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,001
Yes, yes, yes. It seems so.

87
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:52,002
Not it seems,
you bastard, be precise!

88
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,474
I think I dreamed it that way.

89
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:05,146
Anyway, I snuck up behind her,

90
00:09:05,258 --> 00:09:13,529
and I must have chopped
the back of her neck?

91
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:15,464
With my hand like this.

92
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:16,466
Next?

93
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:22,435
Myung-ja cried out, and I
guess she collapsed?

94
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:29,243
So I laid her on the ground,
and was about to take her,

95
00:09:29,348 --> 00:09:32,613
Hey, it didn't
happen there, it was...

96
00:09:32,718 --> 00:09:37,781
The pine grove!
I took her there.

97
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,620
It was from the rice paddies
to the pine grove.

98
00:09:40,726 --> 00:09:44,662
According to the news, more
than 200 meters, right?

99
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:46,391
That's so far!

100
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:50,697
So the rain was pouring, and I
dragged her through the mud.

101
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:52,202
And then?

102
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:56,036
So I threw her down
in the pine grove.

103
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:58,667
Then I strangled her.

104
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:01,110
- With what?
- The bag strap.

105
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:02,646
Really?

106
00:10:02,748 --> 00:10:04,716
Her stocking!

107
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:08,717
Right.

108
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:12,587
Brassiere. A Venus brassiere.

109
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:20,098
I wrapped it around
her throat like this,

110
00:10:20,199 --> 00:10:21,894
So the woman,

111
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:27,234
she took a rock and
clocked me in the head.

112
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,967
Where'd she hit you?

113
00:10:29,075 --> 00:10:33,910
Right here, next to my eye.

114
00:10:34,013 --> 00:10:38,780
It still hurts, even if
it was just a dream.

115
00:10:49,962 --> 00:10:54,296
Byung-soon, are you gonna
keep saying it was a dream?

116
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,096
That's enough.
Turn your head.

117
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:00,932
So this bruise is from the rock?

118
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,600
- No, this guy here...
- Shut up! Look here.

119
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,214
You've done well,
now let's finish this.

120
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:16,221
So...

121
00:11:16,322 --> 00:11:19,883
Since she hit me
like this with the rock,

122
00:11:19,992 --> 00:11:22,722
I must have lost consciousness?

123
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:28,130
And after lying there a while,
I woke up, and looking around...

124
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:29,531
And?

125
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:34,629
I was in the bottom
of an outhouse! A shithouse!

126
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,177
And maggots were
creeping all over the place!

127
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:42,873
Not the outhouse again.
So after brushing them off,

128
00:11:42,982 --> 00:11:47,419
I grabbed some straw,
and pulled myself up.

129
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,717
Even in a dream, it's hard.

130
00:11:50,823 --> 00:11:52,484
But then I saw,

131
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:57,290
this wasn't someone's home,
it was a school toilet.

132
00:11:57,396 --> 00:11:59,887
Walking to the playground,

133
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:03,594
I saw huge swarms of girls,

134
00:12:03,703 --> 00:12:07,537
so many, and the smell...

135
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,868
Wait! Over here.

136
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:15,146
Where did you hear about
that school outhouse?

137
00:12:16,148 --> 00:12:19,584
Everyone knows that story.

138
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:22,313
I saw it in a dream.

139
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:28,125
From below the gas attack,
run in a direction...

140
00:12:28,227 --> 00:12:30,661
...perpendicular to the wind.

141
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:33,027
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

142
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:35,261
Put it down. Hey!

143
00:12:46,011 --> 00:12:46,909
Pretend you're dead!

144
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:55,248
Last time, who told you that
story about the outhouse?

145
00:12:55,354 --> 00:12:57,185
You came because of that?

146
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:03,289
What's wrong?

147
00:13:03,395 --> 00:13:05,522
I hurt myself in the chute.

148
00:13:05,631 --> 00:13:07,599
There was a pebble in there.

149
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:11,369
Where's the nurse?

150
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:14,334
I'll put it on for you.

151
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:16,571
I'II do it.

152
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:19,902
Shy? You're just a kid.

153
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:20,910
Sit down.

154
00:13:25,818 --> 00:13:26,614
Give it to me.

155
00:13:29,488 --> 00:13:30,853
Lift up your shirt.

156
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:35,623
Think about what I asked you.

157
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:42,626
The murderer in the outhouse,
coming out at night...

158
00:13:42,735 --> 00:13:46,501
Who might have
told that story first...

159
00:13:46,605 --> 00:13:47,936
How would I know?

160
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:54,912
It's like asking who
made up the elephant jokes.

161
00:13:55,014 --> 00:13:57,812
Why don't you go to
the outhouse yourself?

162
00:13:58,317 --> 00:14:01,115
Do I look like
I have time for that?

163
00:14:52,137 --> 00:14:53,866
Even still...

164
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:57,033
Some kids talk, so you
snoop around the outhouse?

165
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:58,507
You got that much time?

166
00:14:59,111 --> 00:15:00,305
Giving me a heart attack.

167
00:15:00,412 --> 00:15:01,743
Investigating...

168
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:05,715
Is investigating such a dirty job?

169
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,252
Ah! Is that why they
made up the rumor?

170
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:16,889
I saw her myself
once or twice.

171
00:15:16,996 --> 00:15:17,985
That woman.

172
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:19,530
Who?

173
00:15:20,232 --> 00:15:21,494
A crying woman.

174
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:23,960
When was it?

175
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,701
I was in the outhouse then too,

176
00:15:28,807 --> 00:15:31,435
when I heard a woman crying.

177
00:15:32,044 --> 00:15:34,308
When I came out,

178
00:15:34,413 --> 00:15:37,974
there was a woman
working on that hill,

179
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:39,948
who kept crying.

180
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,881
A woman was crying?

181
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:45,020
Yes.

182
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:48,091
She kept crying on that hill.

183
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:50,956
It just seemed strange.

184
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:12,045
Hello?

185
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:16,084
Excuse me.

186
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:20,688
Are you the person
who lives here?

187
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:24,229
Who are you?

188
00:16:26,498 --> 00:16:29,194
I'd like to ask something.
I heard that...

189
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:33,794
Wait!

190
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:36,401
Look here.

191
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,503
- I'm a policeman.
- Really?

192
00:16:40,546 --> 00:16:44,209
You can't stay there.
Someone might see.

193
00:16:46,151 --> 00:16:47,584
There's no one here.

194
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:53,523
Go, please.

195
00:16:54,326 --> 00:16:55,315
I beg you.

196
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,273
Be assured this will
remain a secret.

197
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:15,644
As we're both women,

198
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:19,411
tell me everything
comfortably and in detail.

199
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:25,053
That night,

200
00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:33,228
a light rain was falling.

201
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:35,325
When was it?

202
00:17:37,936 --> 00:17:39,494
It was...

203
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:45,209
last September.

204
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:59,451
I had read all the articles...

205
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:01,753
...about the women killed.

206
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:09,192
The methods he used
were exactly the same.

207
00:18:10,702 --> 00:18:16,766
It was the same with me.

208
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:24,448
You saw his face?

209
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,844
I tried not to on purpose,

210
00:18:27,953 --> 00:18:30,046
keeping my chin down.

211
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,548
My panties covered my head,

212
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,694
but I closed my eyes tight.

213
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,629
If I saw him,
he'd have killed me.

214
00:18:44,636 --> 00:18:48,595
I don't know about the rest,
but one thing I remember.

215
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:51,543
His hands were very soft.

216
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:55,043
The hand over my mouth,

217
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:57,479
was delicate,

218
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:58,914
just like a woman's.

219
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:35,977
We're done. Let's get
ourselves some sleep.

220
00:19:36,889 --> 00:19:39,221
Once we get
your seal, it's done.

221
00:19:40,826 --> 00:19:42,726
It's all as you said.

222
00:19:44,062 --> 00:19:45,290
Sound good?

223
00:19:46,431 --> 00:19:48,592
Yes, of course.

224
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:51,935
Oh, it's finally over, right?

225
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:53,431
Please let me down. Please.

226
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,746
Let him go.
He's not the murderer.

227
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:03,177
What?

228
00:20:04,449 --> 00:20:06,747
Byung-soon, are
you the murderer?

229
00:20:06,852 --> 00:20:08,843
Yes, sir, yes...

230
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:11,150
Shut up.
No you're not.

231
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:13,115
I think I am...

232
00:20:13,225 --> 00:20:14,522
Let him go!

233
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:18,820
Write down everything she said...

234
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:19,761
Hey!

235
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:21,799
You toying with me?

236
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:23,928
Are you having fun?

237
00:20:24,636 --> 00:20:27,036
I caught the murderer, OK?

238
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:29,369
What do you mean,
you caught him?

239
00:20:33,512 --> 00:20:36,072
Did you hang him
from the ceiling?

240
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:37,876
Well, he kept lying, and...

241
00:20:37,983 --> 00:20:40,747
Get hold of yourself.
Those journalists...

242
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:42,683
- Chief!
- Those goddamned bastards!

243
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,987
Stop!

244
00:20:51,997 --> 00:20:52,895
Listen.

245
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:56,763
What is that?

246
00:20:58,437 --> 00:21:00,928
- Is it live?
- It's being broadcast now?

247
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,438
Yes, it's live.

248
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,542
First, declare a
state of emergency.

249
00:21:15,654 --> 00:21:18,953
And send me two
garrisons of men.

250
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:22,451
Because our
intelligence says so!

251
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:26,229
Tonight. There'll
be a murder tonight.

252
00:21:26,732 --> 00:21:29,132
Hello, I need to
speak to producer Im...

253
00:21:29,901 --> 00:21:31,027
What? He quit?

254
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,367
Get me the A.D. Now.

255
00:21:33,972 --> 00:21:37,806
The song that was just
played, "Sad Letter".

256
00:21:38,143 --> 00:21:40,338
Read the name and
address of the requester.

257
00:21:40,812 --> 00:21:42,609
You must have the postcard.

258
00:21:43,749 --> 00:21:44,943
What? Prank call?

259
00:21:45,584 --> 00:21:48,417
It's the police, bastard!
Hello?

260
00:21:48,854 --> 00:21:49,752
I'll go myself.

261
00:21:50,555 --> 00:21:52,716
Are the garrisons coming?

262
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,218
They don't even have
one man available.

263
00:21:56,728 --> 00:22:00,926
They went to suppress
a demonstration in Suwon city.

264
00:22:33,398 --> 00:22:36,834
Name: Ahn Mi-seon, age 28.

265
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:43,935
Estimated time of death, last
night between 7:30 and 8:00.

266
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:51,182
When the two of you were
fighting like madmen. Right?

267
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,046
Wait a minute.

268
00:22:57,356 --> 00:22:59,551
There's something
in the vagina.

269
00:23:12,404 --> 00:23:14,736
Looks like a peach.

270
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,199
Nine pieces.

271
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:55,344
Do you see this kind of
thing in Seoul often?

272
00:23:57,783 --> 00:23:59,683
Never.

273
00:24:02,654 --> 00:24:04,144
You were right.

274
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:06,952
What?

275
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:13,321
These guys were a waste
of time from the start.

276
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:16,791
Hey!

277
00:24:17,736 --> 00:24:19,294
A call from the radio station.

278
00:24:19,871 --> 00:24:22,635
I think she found the postcard.

279
00:24:24,776 --> 00:24:27,040
I've got the postcard.
It has an address.

280
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:29,145
Can you write it down?

281
00:24:30,182 --> 00:24:32,207
Jinan 1-ri, Terung District

282
00:24:32,317 --> 00:24:34,979
#32. Park Hyun-gyu.

283
00:25:09,955 --> 00:25:10,717
Who are you?

284
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:15,851
We're policemen.
Where has Park Hyun-gyu gone?

285
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:20,727
He works at the
factory at this time.

286
00:25:46,124 --> 00:25:46,886
Hey, Hyun-gyu.

287
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,224
Park Hyun-gyu!

288
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:52,396
Park Hyun-gyu!

289
00:26:22,294 --> 00:26:23,261
Show me your hands.

290
00:26:33,138 --> 00:26:34,935
They're quite smooth.

291
00:26:37,442 --> 00:26:39,637
How long have you
worked in the factory office?

292
00:26:43,582 --> 00:26:45,174
From September last year.

293
00:26:46,851 --> 00:26:51,311
A little before the first murder.

294
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:00,295
So after doing your military
service, you came to this town,

295
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:03,834
and the murders all
began taking place.

296
00:27:03,935 --> 00:27:05,402
Right?

297
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:08,395
Park Hyun-gyu.

298
00:27:09,441 --> 00:27:11,966
You sent this postcard
to the station.

299
00:27:12,077 --> 00:27:12,941
Yes.

300
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:15,411
You sent several others too.

301
00:27:15,513 --> 00:27:16,377
Yes.

302
00:27:17,582 --> 00:27:20,574
You asked it to be
played on rainy days.

303
00:27:20,685 --> 00:27:21,413
Yes.

304
00:27:23,822 --> 00:27:27,883
"Sad Letter" You know that
each time this song played,

305
00:27:27,993 --> 00:27:30,223
a woman was murdered?

306
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:33,996
No.

307
00:27:36,768 --> 00:27:39,032
Look at the broadcast records.

308
00:27:42,007 --> 00:27:42,905
Okay.

309
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:48,743
The song played yesterday?
"Sad Letter".

310
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,808
Yes.

311
00:27:50,148 --> 00:27:52,082
You listened to the program?

312
00:27:52,183 --> 00:27:52,774
Yes.

313
00:27:52,884 --> 00:27:56,911
Your song played at 7:08, and
the program finished at 8pm.

314
00:27:57,022 --> 00:27:58,421
- You listened to the end?
- Yes.

315
00:27:58,523 --> 00:28:00,354
- Continuously?
- Yes.

316
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:03,325
- What was the final song?
- I don't know.

317
00:28:03,428 --> 00:28:05,419
- It was yesterday!
- I don't remember.

318
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,157
Because you went out!

319
00:28:07,265 --> 00:28:08,357
I was home!

320
00:28:08,466 --> 00:28:11,924
She was killed
between 7:30 and 8pm.

321
00:28:12,037 --> 00:28:14,198
You weren't listening,
you went out!

322
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:15,469
Don't make me laugh.

323
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:19,306
You motherfucker.
Are you joking?

324
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:21,379
- Let go of him now!
- Hey!

325
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:26,272
Get back here!

326
00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:37,089
Even kids in this town know
you torture innocent people.

327
00:28:37,195 --> 00:28:38,719
Shut up, you!

328
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,854
Get back here!

329
00:28:43,835 --> 00:28:45,427
Anyway, I won't be one of them.

330
00:28:47,472 --> 00:28:48,905
Never.

331
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,342
Okay. Park Hyun-gyu.

332
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:58,906
You say you listened
at home to the end?

333
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:03,382
But you couldn't have
forgotten the last song.

334
00:29:03,488 --> 00:29:07,515
Because the DJ introduced it

335
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:09,593
with some very striking words.

336
00:29:10,228 --> 00:29:14,528
She mentioned you, and
the many postcards you sent.

337
00:29:14,632 --> 00:29:18,932
If you heard it,
you couldn't have forgotten.

338
00:29:19,037 --> 00:29:22,131
Tell me! If you really
listened to the end.

339
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:25,272
I don't remember.

340
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,934
You don't remember?

341
00:29:27,946 --> 00:29:29,675
Should I explain it for you?

342
00:29:33,651 --> 00:29:35,915
This is the recording of
yesterday's program.

343
00:29:37,956 --> 00:29:41,448
Last night, you sat
listening to this song.

344
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,858
Outside the rain was
pelting down, you listened,

345
00:29:49,033 --> 00:29:51,695
and soon you started
itching with excitement.

346
00:29:52,704 --> 00:29:56,663
There's something you always
do when you hear this song.

347
00:29:57,776 --> 00:30:03,180
You heard a TV program playing
in the room of your landlady,

348
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:08,184
you left the lights on in your
own room and crept outside.

349
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:14,788
And in the pitch dark,
you wandered here and there.

350
00:30:14,893 --> 00:30:18,351
Who will it be today?

351
00:30:19,497 --> 00:30:20,395
Right?

352
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:26,631
You hid in a reed field,
waiting for a woman to pass.

353
00:30:26,871 --> 00:30:28,463
The rain drenching you.

354
00:30:28,573 --> 00:30:31,201
But you find all this pleasurable.

355
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:32,799
Stimulating, right?

356
00:30:33,444 --> 00:30:36,709
So yesterday you stuffed
this in that woman's body!

357
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:43,177
You remember how
many pieces it was?

358
00:30:43,288 --> 00:30:45,119
One piece,

359
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:45,952
two...

360
00:30:46,057 --> 00:30:47,854
- Three pieces...
- Shut up!

361
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:49,483
Four, five...

362
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:50,754
six, seven, eight...

363
00:30:50,862 --> 00:30:52,352
Shut the fuck up!

364
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:58,425
Yong-gu!

365
00:30:59,871 --> 00:31:02,601
I told you not to hit him.

366
00:31:02,707 --> 00:31:06,234
Didn't I?

367
00:31:06,711 --> 00:31:08,406
I warned you.

368
00:31:08,513 --> 00:31:11,311
You know why
journalists snoop around here.

369
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:13,046
You stupid bastard.

370
00:31:16,287 --> 00:31:20,781
Don't even think about coming
into the interrogation room again.

371
00:31:34,772 --> 00:31:36,364
I'm going crazy.

372
00:31:39,944 --> 00:31:42,777
No eyewitnesses,

373
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:44,746
not one piece of evidence.

374
00:31:46,251 --> 00:31:48,685
We need something, shit.

375
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:53,253
Shit, we don't need
any damn witnesses.

376
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:55,189
Just a confession will do.

377
00:31:55,927 --> 00:31:59,055
Just need to beat that
bastard to an inch of his life.

378
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,627
You've changed.

379
00:32:06,237 --> 00:32:11,265
Try it and, you'll be disgraced.
Like with Kwang-ho.

380
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:17,547
Retarded Kwang-ho...

381
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,610
I always wanted to ask you.

382
00:32:24,188 --> 00:32:26,952
When you dragged
him up the mountain,

383
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:33,463
he talked about Hyang-sook's
death in so much detail.

384
00:32:34,265 --> 00:32:35,129
So?

385
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:40,702
Did you really not rehearse
that dialogue with him?

386
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:43,672
I told you I didn't!

387
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:48,942
But how did he know the
way she was strangled...

388
00:32:49,047 --> 00:32:50,275
That's my point!

389
00:32:53,718 --> 00:32:56,812
The tape... Where's the tape
from the mountain?

390
00:32:56,921 --> 00:32:58,855
Miss Kwon? Gui-ok.

391
00:32:59,824 --> 00:33:03,692
Then, Hyang-sook's body shook a bit.

392
00:33:03,795 --> 00:33:06,457
She looked completely dead.

393
00:33:06,564 --> 00:33:08,498
Listen to how he speaks here.

394
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:13,502
Covered up Hyang-sook's head.

395
00:33:13,604 --> 00:33:14,195
With what?

396
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,568
Her panties.

397
00:33:16,674 --> 00:33:21,270
Her head was covered
with her panties.

398
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:24,280
He's talking like
it was someone else.

399
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:25,610
And then?

400
00:33:25,717 --> 00:33:30,711
He's describing what he saw.

401
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:35,252
Kwang-ho is the witness.

402
00:33:47,572 --> 00:33:48,664
Where did Kwang-ho go?

403
00:33:50,274 --> 00:33:51,764
Kwang-ho...

404
00:33:53,077 --> 00:33:54,442
No, no. We came for a drink.

405
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:56,774
Some meat, please.

406
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,881
What are you doing here?

407
00:34:09,994 --> 00:34:11,427
Control yourself, huh?

408
00:34:12,663 --> 00:34:15,154
He's not in his room.
I'll check outside.

409
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:17,797
Try the game arcade.

410
00:34:20,138 --> 00:34:21,969
How long have you been here?

411
00:34:22,907 --> 00:34:27,003
Have you seen Kwang-ho?

412
00:34:37,522 --> 00:34:40,457
It is now 23 months since
the incident first surfaced.

413
00:34:40,558 --> 00:34:43,891
Before interrogating
Detective Moon...

414
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:47,596
They should cut off
all detective's dicks!

415
00:34:47,698 --> 00:34:49,427
Nah, it's not worth it.

416
00:34:49,534 --> 00:34:52,401
They are stupid bastards.

417
00:34:52,503 --> 00:34:53,333
Be quiet.

418
00:35:06,284 --> 00:35:09,185
The trial of detective Moon,
suspected of police torture

419
00:35:09,287 --> 00:35:13,383
and sexual assault,
opened today.

420
00:35:34,245 --> 00:35:36,372
You fucked your professor,
didn't you, bitch!

421
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:39,382
Your parents pay good money...

422
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,352
Hey, Yong-gu!

423
00:36:18,055 --> 00:36:19,784
Kwang-ho!

424
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:24,283
Kwang-ho!
Don't run away!

425
00:36:24,395 --> 00:36:25,384
Hey, Kwang-ho!

426
00:36:26,197 --> 00:36:28,859
Kwang-ho!

427
00:36:35,673 --> 00:36:37,766
Kwang-ho!

428
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:40,475
I'm sorry...

429
00:36:40,578 --> 00:36:41,772
What's wrong with you?

430
00:36:41,879 --> 00:36:44,006
We're not here to catch you.

431
00:36:44,115 --> 00:36:45,343
Come down.

432
00:36:46,617 --> 00:36:49,085
You're gonna kill me?

433
00:36:49,187 --> 00:36:52,918
We'll forget that any of
that happened.

434
00:36:53,024 --> 00:36:55,322
If a fight breaks out,
that can happen.

435
00:36:55,426 --> 00:36:57,758
It's okay,

436
00:36:57,862 --> 00:36:59,557
just come down, huh?

437
00:36:59,664 --> 00:37:02,064
If I do, you'll kill me?

438
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:03,394
I know it.

439
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:06,368
We won't kill you,
just come down.

440
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:09,837
Okay, just stay there for now.
We've something to ask you.

441
00:37:09,941 --> 00:37:12,876
You...

442
00:37:12,977 --> 00:37:14,274
You remember Hyang-sook?

443
00:37:14,378 --> 00:37:16,972
The girl that died.

444
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:19,879
Hyang-sook is pretty.

445
00:37:20,818 --> 00:37:23,787
That's right. You used
to follow after her.

446
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:26,516
But that night,

447
00:37:26,624 --> 00:37:30,754
when it rained,
you saw her killed, huh?

448
00:37:31,462 --> 00:37:34,226
That? I told you already.

449
00:37:34,332 --> 00:37:38,530
In the forest.
I told you already...

450
00:37:38,636 --> 00:37:42,538
You saw when Hyang-sook was
murdered, didn't you? Here?

451
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,972
Yeah, here.

452
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:48,802
The paddy next to
the train tracks.

453
00:37:52,149 --> 00:37:53,548
That night,

454
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:56,711
did you see the killer's face?

455
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:59,483
- Yeah.
- Really?

456
00:38:00,491 --> 00:38:02,152
Lightning, ka-rang!

457
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:08,660
I saw everything
from inside here.

458
00:38:08,766 --> 00:38:12,827
So you saw his face?

459
00:38:12,937 --> 00:38:14,666
Three times.

460
00:38:16,007 --> 00:38:18,874
Do you remember him in detail?

461
00:38:19,744 --> 00:38:21,109
He was handsome.

462
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:24,373
More than me.

463
00:38:29,854 --> 00:38:32,152
Was this the face you saw?

464
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:36,221
Look at the picture.

465
00:38:46,137 --> 00:38:48,571
You know how hot
that fire was?

466
00:38:48,673 --> 00:38:50,504
Look at the photo!

467
00:38:51,142 --> 00:38:53,201
It was so hot!

468
00:38:53,311 --> 00:38:55,370
Snap out of it!

469
00:38:55,813 --> 00:38:58,213
Here, look closely.

470
00:38:58,316 --> 00:39:00,876
Hot hot hot hot!

471
00:39:00,985 --> 00:39:03,078
Look at the photo!

472
00:39:03,187 --> 00:39:04,950
Hey. Kwang-ho.

473
00:39:05,056 --> 00:39:06,956
When I was young,

474
00:39:07,058 --> 00:39:10,516
he threw me in the fire.
That man.

475
00:39:10,628 --> 00:39:12,493
- Kwang-ho!
- You bastards!

476
00:39:12,596 --> 00:39:13,620
What the hell!

477
00:39:13,731 --> 00:39:17,724
Please forgive him.

478
00:39:17,802 --> 00:39:23,365
What are you students doing?

479
00:39:23,474 --> 00:39:24,998
We're police!

480
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:27,077
Bullshit!
Then we're the F.B.I.!

481
00:39:42,426 --> 00:39:43,586
Hey, Kwang-ho!

482
00:39:44,328 --> 00:39:46,592
We're looking for you.

483
00:39:47,665 --> 00:39:48,461
Hey!

484
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:51,562
A train's coming!
Come here!

485
00:39:58,042 --> 00:39:59,737
Out of the way, quick!

486
00:40:01,145 --> 00:40:02,510
It's dangerous there.

487
00:40:02,947 --> 00:40:05,415
Out of the way! You idiot!

488
00:40:05,516 --> 00:40:08,314
Stay away. Go...

489
00:40:48,025 --> 00:40:51,552
It's okay for you to be here?
They'll be looking for you.

490
00:41:27,731 --> 00:41:29,221
Yes, yes.

491
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:33,030
Journalists tend
to be like that.

492
00:41:33,504 --> 00:41:37,031
Sir, as I said last time...

493
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:39,008
Hello?

494
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,242
Hello?

495
00:41:40,978 --> 00:41:43,208
Assholes!

496
00:41:43,314 --> 00:41:45,339
High-ranking bastards...

497
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,781
- Chief!
- What?

498
00:41:48,285 --> 00:41:51,914
It's Investigative Crimes.
They found semen.

499
00:41:52,189 --> 00:41:53,213
They found what?

500
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:54,814
Take a look.

501
00:41:54,925 --> 00:41:57,826
The semen was found
on the victim's clothing.

502
00:41:57,928 --> 00:42:02,194
Maybe he masturbated
on the corpse,

503
00:42:02,299 --> 00:42:04,164
and semen fell on her clothes.

504
00:42:04,268 --> 00:42:05,599
Wait.

505
00:42:05,703 --> 00:42:07,398
So...

506
00:42:07,505 --> 00:42:10,633
...if the DNA in this semen

507
00:42:10,741 --> 00:42:13,539
is confirmed to match
that of Park Hyun-gyu,

508
00:42:13,644 --> 00:42:19,776
then the game's over, isn't it?

509
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:23,217
Yes, that would be quite
strong evidence.

510
00:42:23,587 --> 00:42:28,388
The problem is, we don't have
the technology in Korea

511
00:42:28,492 --> 00:42:30,619
to carry out such tests.

512
00:42:30,928 --> 00:42:32,953
It must be sent to America.

513
00:42:33,063 --> 00:42:35,156
There's no other way.

514
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,029
Once the test's complete,
the results will be released.

515
00:42:40,137 --> 00:42:43,573
So we just have to wait for
the documents from America?

516
00:42:43,674 --> 00:42:44,641
That's right.

517
00:42:46,043 --> 00:42:49,308
You sent people to
watch over Park Hyun-gyu?

518
00:42:49,413 --> 00:42:53,372
Yes! They're watching
him 24 hours a day.

519
00:42:54,118 --> 00:42:56,279
Once the result
comes in from America,

520
00:42:56,387 --> 00:42:59,845
wait until we get our
hands on that bastard.

521
00:43:16,106 --> 00:43:19,769
What's wrong with your leg?

522
00:43:19,877 --> 00:43:21,071
Why?

523
00:43:21,378 --> 00:43:22,504
Did you go to the hospital?

524
00:43:22,613 --> 00:43:25,275
For this little scratch?
Come here.

525
00:43:25,382 --> 00:43:27,816
It's okay.
I put on some medicine.

526
00:43:28,586 --> 00:43:34,718
- What is that?
- Oh, that night...

527
00:43:34,825 --> 00:43:36,190
It keeps swelling.

528
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,257
Come on, let's go.

529
00:43:38,362 --> 00:43:39,294
Just get in.

530
00:43:40,364 --> 00:43:43,492
So, you have to amputate?

531
00:43:43,601 --> 00:43:45,967
Should I explain it again?

532
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:48,868
It was pierced, but why
cut off a healthy leg?

533
00:43:48,973 --> 00:43:51,965
If you don't, he'll die.

534
00:43:52,242 --> 00:43:55,734
Tetanous is a brutal thing.

535
00:43:55,846 --> 00:43:58,872
For rusty nails, you need
to see a doctor fast.

536
00:43:58,983 --> 00:44:01,451
Bunch of dim-witted boneheads.

537
00:44:02,419 --> 00:44:06,981
Be grateful it's under the knee.

538
00:44:08,325 --> 00:44:09,883
Crazy bastards.

539
00:44:09,994 --> 00:44:10,892
Let's go.

540
00:44:14,431 --> 00:44:15,329
Are you family?

541
00:44:15,432 --> 00:44:18,026
He doesn't have any,
but I'm like his brother...

542
00:44:18,135 --> 00:44:19,932
Anyway, you came together, right?

543
00:44:20,037 --> 00:44:24,064
The authorization for surgery.
Read it, then sign.

544
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:43,890
You fucker...

545
00:44:59,109 --> 00:45:00,201
Hello, post office?

546
00:45:01,245 --> 00:45:03,270
It's Suh Tae-yoon,
Investigative Crimes.

547
00:45:04,782 --> 00:45:06,943
Have the documents
from America arrived?

548
00:45:09,987 --> 00:45:11,545
Have you checked 100%?

549
00:45:13,023 --> 00:45:16,015
I keep calling because
it's important!

550
00:45:16,994 --> 00:45:21,590
Since it's so important, please
call as soon as it comes.

551
00:45:25,302 --> 00:45:26,269
Hello?

552
00:45:30,007 --> 00:45:30,996
Uh, now?

553
00:45:32,776 --> 00:45:34,801
Why'd you call me out?

554
00:45:34,912 --> 00:45:37,574
Why?
Can't I do that sometimes?

555
00:45:38,582 --> 00:45:40,550
Your face looks worn,

556
00:45:40,651 --> 00:45:41,709
Are you sleeping well?

557
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:46,189
What kind of
detective sleeps well?

558
00:45:48,592 --> 00:45:49,923
What's wrong with you?

559
00:45:50,027 --> 00:45:52,518
Fishing? Damn free-riders.

560
00:45:57,134 --> 00:45:59,193
Why'd you call out a busy man?

561
00:46:03,941 --> 00:46:06,171
You look like a corpse.

562
00:46:09,646 --> 00:46:12,547
It may be no use asking,

563
00:46:12,649 --> 00:46:14,173
but can you do anything else?

564
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:18,182
Can you quit your job?

565
00:47:39,903 --> 00:47:40,597
Violent Crimes Dept!

566
00:47:41,638 --> 00:47:42,605
Violent Crimes!

567
00:47:43,207 --> 00:47:45,573
How many visits in one night?

568
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:47,769
Is money that important?

569
00:47:50,314 --> 00:47:53,408
Bo-kyung's grandmother
collapsed again. I have to go.

570
00:47:53,951 --> 00:47:57,387
You deserve a medal.

571
00:47:57,487 --> 00:47:59,785
Get one from
the Health Ministry.

572
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:10,993
Chief!

573
00:48:11,101 --> 00:48:13,262
Park Hyun-gyu hasn't
come home for 2 hours.

574
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:16,703
It's only six stops from
there to his house.

575
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,031
So he must have gotten off.

576
00:48:19,142 --> 00:48:21,667
Would a man under
investigation act so wild?

577
00:48:21,778 --> 00:48:24,804
He's capable of it.

578
00:48:24,915 --> 00:48:29,284
- He's instinctively crazy.
- You seem like the crazy one!

579
00:48:29,386 --> 00:48:35,382
Once the DNA tests arrive,
he's through. Stop it.

580
00:48:35,792 --> 00:48:38,317
I let him go...

581
00:48:38,428 --> 00:48:41,158
Don't get so upset!

582
00:50:22,299 --> 00:50:23,698
Citizens,

583
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,894
this is a civil defense drill.

584
00:50:27,004 --> 00:50:33,910
A blackout is called for
in all buildings and houses...

585
00:51:45,949 --> 00:51:49,612
Will you make any special
investigation into this incident?

586
00:52:05,068 --> 00:52:07,866
A razor wound in the breast...

587
00:52:10,707 --> 00:52:11,935
What the hell?

588
00:52:13,743 --> 00:52:16,075
Something is stuck
inside of the vagina.

589
00:52:17,647 --> 00:52:21,139
Huh?
Looks like a ball point pen,

590
00:52:21,618 --> 00:52:22,949
and a spoon.

591
00:52:24,754 --> 00:52:25,743
Jesus...

592
00:52:29,092 --> 00:52:31,686
Look inside, closely.

593
00:52:39,202 --> 00:52:41,227
Wait, what's that?

594
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:43,230
An old band-aid.

595
00:52:57,888 --> 00:53:00,083
What are you doing?

596
00:53:01,892 --> 00:53:04,156
Why are you touching a corpse?

597
00:53:29,486 --> 00:53:30,180
What?

598
00:53:34,024 --> 00:53:35,082
Get up, you bastard!

599
00:53:42,832 --> 00:53:44,766
You fucker!

600
00:53:48,505 --> 00:53:49,733
Get up, you fucker.

601
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:55,409
Are you human?

602
00:54:08,525 --> 00:54:12,586
Nobody will care if I kill you.

603
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:24,199
Tell me!

604
00:54:25,842 --> 00:54:27,400
Tell me you killed them!

605
00:54:30,213 --> 00:54:31,441
Tell me!

606
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:35,182
You killed all those women!

607
00:54:55,238 --> 00:54:57,001
Yeah.

608
00:54:57,107 --> 00:55:00,634
I killed them.

609
00:55:00,744 --> 00:55:02,371
I killed them all.

610
00:55:06,716 --> 00:55:08,581
That's what you want
to hear, right?

611
00:55:09,953 --> 00:55:11,113
Right?

612
00:55:12,555 --> 00:55:15,023
You feel better?

613
00:55:19,329 --> 00:55:21,854
Inspector Suh!

614
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:25,192
The papers from America!

615
00:55:25,969 --> 00:55:26,833
Read them!

616
00:55:28,538 --> 00:55:29,869
You asshole.

617
00:55:32,242 --> 00:55:33,038
You fucker!

618
00:55:34,744 --> 00:55:35,904
You mocked us, didn't you!

619
00:55:36,012 --> 00:55:37,673
You bastard!

620
00:55:39,616 --> 00:55:40,947
You mocked us!

621
00:55:58,468 --> 00:55:59,298
What's wrong?

622
00:56:31,768 --> 00:56:35,169
There's a mistake.

623
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,640
This document is a lie.
I don't need it.

624
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:02,962
What does it say, huh?

625
00:57:11,241 --> 00:57:12,503
It really wasn't you?

626
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:22,244
Look in my eyes.

627
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:55,347
Look in my eyes!

628
00:58:10,366 --> 00:58:11,924
Fuck, I don't know.

629
00:58:19,442 --> 00:58:21,171
Do you get up each morning too?

630
00:58:25,782 --> 00:58:26,714
Go!

631
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:31,453
Just go, fucker!

632
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:36,950
Bastard.

633
00:59:46,529 --> 00:59:48,087
That's enough.

634
01:00:28,838 --> 01:00:31,204
Chi-hyuk.

635
01:00:31,307 --> 01:00:33,468
You played computer
games all night, right?

636
01:00:35,011 --> 01:00:37,844
Did you or didn't you?

637
01:00:42,652 --> 01:00:44,279
Look in my eyes, son.

638
01:00:45,455 --> 01:00:46,945
Eyes all bloodshot.

639
01:00:48,157 --> 01:00:49,818
Do you play well?

640
01:00:49,926 --> 01:00:50,790
Yeah!

641
01:00:51,094 --> 01:00:54,154
You don't study, might as
well be good at games.

642
01:00:55,698 --> 01:00:59,759
If you won't study,
go get some exercise.

643
01:00:59,869 --> 01:01:02,429
Sitting in front
of the computer...

644
01:01:02,538 --> 01:01:04,062
I really didn't!

645
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,137
What do you mean you didn't?

646
01:01:06,242 --> 01:01:08,369
Think you can fool my eyes?

647
01:01:09,712 --> 01:01:12,408
He said he didn't.
Believe him.

648
01:01:12,515 --> 01:01:18,784
No, two days ago Manager Oh
called my company.

649
01:01:18,888 --> 01:01:23,154
He kept saying you can't do
this to people, it's not fair.

650
01:01:23,626 --> 01:01:26,993
You can't believe him.

651
01:01:27,664 --> 01:01:30,929
Did I do anything wrong?

652
01:01:31,034 --> 01:01:35,403
I'm on the road now
with our product.

653
01:01:37,073 --> 01:01:42,010
Sure, let's have dinner
with Manager Oh.

654
01:01:42,779 --> 01:01:44,542
It's been a while.

655
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:50,512
Chul-yong!
Pull over a minute!

656
01:03:28,818 --> 01:03:30,342
Is something in there?

657
01:03:32,221 --> 01:03:33,654
Is anything in there?

658
01:03:35,158 --> 01:03:36,523
No...

659
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:39,487
Then why are you looking?

660
01:03:41,798 --> 01:03:43,459
I'm just looking.

661
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:46,267
That's so weird.

662
01:03:48,004 --> 01:03:49,028
What is?

663
01:03:50,873 --> 01:03:52,431
A while back,

664
01:03:52,542 --> 01:03:56,672
a man was here
looking into that hole.

665
01:04:00,483 --> 01:04:03,475
I asked him the same question.

666
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:06,045
Why he was looking there.

667
01:04:06,155 --> 01:04:07,349
What did he say?

668
01:04:08,658 --> 01:04:10,421
What was it?

669
01:04:10,526 --> 01:04:12,187
Right...

670
01:04:12,295 --> 01:04:16,561
He remembered doing
something here long ago,

671
01:04:16,666 --> 01:04:20,363

to take a look.

Did you see his face?

673

What did he look like?

674
01:04:44,794 --> 01:04:45,954
Well...

675
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:49,397
Kind of plain.

676
01:04:51,901 --> 01:04:52,799
In what way?

677
01:04:56,072 --> 01:04:57,334
Just...

678
01:04:59,642 --> 01:05:01,405
ordinary.
