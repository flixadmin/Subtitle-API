your bone density's for shit.

165
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:53,689
That Compound V shit is killing you.

Hey. Don't even say
it out loud, all right?

You don't know shit
about it, you understand?

168
00:09:56,568 --> 00:09:58,610
I don't want to know.

169
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:01,780
And you're done, okay?
No more fucking around.

Sioux City's got a fucking
faster runner than me.

Then no more club openings
and commercial shoots.

Okay? None of that shit. We train.

Back to the basics.

Nobody gets it back at my age.

176
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:18,797
I'm gonna be a freak
show like Ben Johnson,

felt like we were overdue

187
00:10:57,295 --> 00:10:59,880
a little heart-to-heart.

188
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:03,133
A rap session, maybe
a little tough love.

Got to keep your eye on the ball, guys.

I don't understand. Who is this guy?

He and Starlight are going steady.

211

He's also one of the guys
who killed Translucent.

It's just, he's not...

I-I remember now, I-I've seen
him outside of Popclaw's place.

He was all in my face.

- S... Okay, slow down.

I don't know what's going on,

but Hughie is not capable
of anything close to this.

236
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:24,900
Well, that is true,
actually. That's very true.

237
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:27,027
He is just a man, and,

00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:29,154
(LAUGHS): by the looks
of it, not much of one.

00:13:38,247 --> 00:13:39,873
I don't know,

243
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:41,958
got him in to see Ezekiel

244
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:44,753
and got rid of the Deep.

245
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:47,088
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.

Keep those hands down
by your sides, missy.

Sit down.

248
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:06,274
Now... I know

249
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:08,944
that you want to make
this whole Deep thing

00:14:12,657 --> 00:14:15,492
But really, what you've done

253
00:14:15,493 --> 00:14:18,537
is pulled off every
criminal's wet dream.

254
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:22,249
I mean, The Seven is down by two.

255
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,001
I just can't help noticing
that it all started

256
00:14:25,002 --> 00:14:28,004
when you came along,
which makes me wonder,

257
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:30,841
which one of us is next, hmm?

258
00:14:30,842 --> 00:14:32,384
You bitch.

fucking mud people

264
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:48,275

Shut your fucking mouth, young lady.

266
00:14:53,531 --> 00:14:55,700
If you were in my position...

267
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,787
... what would you do to you?

268
00:15:00,788 --> 00:15:02,372
(CRYING)

269
00:15:02,373 --> 00:15:04,291
Homelander, that's enough.

270
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:06,294
You got something to add, Maeve?

271
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:10,630
She didn't know.

272
00:15:10,631 --> 00:15:13,466
Well, she stinks of adrenaline

273
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:15,600
and her heart's beating
like a little rabbit.

274
00:15:15,601 --> 00:15:18,638
The only thing she's guilty
of is being fucking stupid.

275
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,892
She obviously fell for
this Hugh Campbell guy

276
00:15:21,893 --> 00:15:24,019
and he's pumping her for information,

277
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,522
so back off, leave her alone.

278
00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:34,654
Wow.

279
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,823
Starlight,

280
00:15:36,824 --> 00:15:39,075
you must be something special.

281
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:40,911
Hmm?

282
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:44,539
I can't remember the last
time Maeve gave a shit ab...

283
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,166
Well, gave a shit about anyone,

284
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:48,169
really.

285
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,972
And if I say no?

286
00:16:02,016 --> 00:16:04,976
Come on.

287
00:16:04,977 --> 00:16:07,103
(WHISPERING): I got this.

288
00:16:07,104 --> 00:16:09,856
It's you and me,

289
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:12,151
remember?

290
00:16:17,448 --> 00:16:20,117
(WHISPERING): Don't say I
never do anything for you.

291
00:16:23,496 --> 00:16:25,914
All right.

292
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:28,917
You want her, you got her.
She's your responsibility now.

293
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:31,294
I just hope you're right about her,

294
00:16:31,295 --> 00:16:33,297
for both your sakes.

295
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,425
Class dismissed.

296
00:16:49,105 --> 00:16:50,730
Look at this.

297
00:16:50,731 --> 00:16:52,816
Oh, no. You don't stir,

298
00:16:52,817 --> 00:16:54,735
you fold. Like this.

299
00:16:56,779 --> 00:16:59,531
Now that's what makes them spongy.

300
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:01,866
Here you go.

301
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:03,202
(DOOR OPENS)

302
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:10,792
She wants to know where you were.

303
00:17:10,793 --> 00:17:13,921
That's a compelling fucking question.

304
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:18,008
Hey, can we talk?

305
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:19,426
That's what we're doing, innit?

306
00:17:19,427 --> 00:17:21,219
No, I mean...

307
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,264
There ain't no secrets
here, son. Spit it out.

308
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:26,725
Stop being an asshole,
just talk to the guy.

309
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:28,519
Hughie doesn't mind. Do you, Hughie?

310
00:17:32,314 --> 00:17:36,152
Okay, fine. I don't think
I can do this anymore.

311
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:41,197
- Do what?
- This.

312
00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:43,658
I mean, Vought, whatever with Kimiko,

313
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:46,036
it's-it's awful, and you got to stop it,

314
00:17:46,037 --> 00:17:48,496
- but I can't.
- Right.

315
00:17:48,497 --> 00:17:51,124
You just want to kick
back, drink a few Mai Tais,

316
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,168
and let us do all the work, is that it?

317
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:54,836
You know, I managed to go my whole life

318
00:17:54,837 --> 00:17:56,254
without seeing someone die horribly,

319
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:57,964
and now I'm up to about a half dozen,

320
00:17:57,965 --> 00:17:59,382
- so I think I'm good.
- Please.

321
00:17:59,383 --> 00:18:01,718
You're a fucking killer, Hughie,

322
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:04,512
just like the rest of us.

323
00:18:04,513 --> 00:18:06,806
Now, why don't you stop pissing around

324
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:09,684
and tell everybody what
this is really all about?

325
00:18:09,685 --> 00:18:12,103
- Yeah?
- Fine.

326
00:18:12,104 --> 00:18:13,772
Annie.

327
00:18:13,773 --> 00:18:14,939
- Fuck.
- HUGHIE: Okay?

328
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,817
It's about Annie.

329
00:18:19,904 --> 00:18:21,113
Fucking finally.

330
00:18:22,747 --> 00:18:26,284
He's been sneaking off to
give her one at Lincoln Grand.

331
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:28,495
- You've been following me?
- Like you gave me a choice.

332
00:18:28,496 --> 00:18:31,206
She doesn't know anything, okay?
I'm not gonna tell her anything.

333
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:32,570
- All right? We'll just...
- Just what?

334
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:34,459
Fuck off to Epcot? The Hamptons?

335
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,919
Maybe pump out a few flying babies?

336
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,712
No. I... I don't know.

337
00:18:37,713 --> 00:18:39,881
No, you don't know
'cause you ain't thinking,

338
00:18:39,882 --> 00:18:42,509
- except with your dick.
- You're wrong about her.

339
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,637
That bitch is fucking playing you,

340
00:18:45,638 --> 00:18:47,305
and you're too fucking blind to see it.

341
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:49,349
Right, so better to be
loyal to a dead woman

342
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,767
who doesn't know and doesn't care?

343
00:18:50,768 --> 00:18:52,770
How's that working out for you?

- MAN (ON PHONE): Hey, Hughie.

346
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:17,043
Long time no talk.

347
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:19,087
You know, I've been thinking
about you a lot lately.

348
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:20,380
Who's this?

349
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:22,006
I thought you would recognize my voice.

350
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:24,175
You spend so much time
obsessing about me, am I right?

351
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:28,096
- Say hi to your baby boy, Dad.
- Oh. H-Hey, hey, hey, Hughie.

352
00:19:28,097 --> 00:19:30,223
Why is he here? He says
you're in some kind of trouble.

353
00:19:30,224 --> 00:19:31,433
Dad, are you okay?

354
00:19:32,643 --> 00:19:34,310
Oh, o-okay.

355
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:36,855
He's fine. Remington Steele's almost on.

356
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:38,815
A-Train, listen to me.

00:19:38,816 --> 00:19:41,943
Oh, shit, if he's
burned, then I'm fucked.

358
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:43,361
HUGHIE: He's on fucking Medicaid.

359
00:19:43,362 --> 00:19:44,696
He's harmless. Let him go.

360
00:19:44,697 --> 00:19:46,823
My place is burned. They've got me.

361

Oh, my God.

362

Get your ass over here in 20 minutes,

363

or I'm gonna burst through
him like a fucking piñata,

364
00:19:53,414 --> 00:19:55,957
do you understand me? Just
like I did your girlfriend.

365
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:57,333
- Yeah. Got it.
- And, Hughie,

366
00:19:57,334 --> 00:19:59,836
alone. If I catch a whiff,

- I got it.

listen, when you get this,

371
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:12,473
leave the house immediately.
Lay low and call me.

372
00:20:12,474 --> 00:20:14,601
- Well, I hope she was fucking worth it.
- It's not Annie.

00:20:14,602 --> 00:20:16,102
- She doesn't know.
- It doesn't matter.

374
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:18,479
- I'm gonna fucking do her in.
- The hell you will!

375
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,815
Hey, hold on a second. She
doesn't know. It wasn't her.

376
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:22,233
She's never seen me before.

377
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:25,321
Not once, not ever. So
how did I get burned?

Mesmer. You fucking idiots

379
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:32,994
had to go to Mesmer.

380
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:34,622
Fuck me.

381
00:20:37,374 --> 00:20:39,918
Thank you.

382
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,588
That was not smart, to sleep with her.

383
00:20:52,681 --> 00:20:54,767
- Hughie.
- Dad.

384

(WHISPERING): He's acting strange.

385

You know, real jumpy.

386
00:21:00,064 --> 00:21:02,690
- Where is he?
- I don't know, he...

Right here, sport. (LAUGHS)

Look what I got.

389
00:21:10,324 --> 00:21:13,284
Special 2016 Comic-Con edition?

390
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:15,286
What, did they make, like,
a few hundred of these?

391

- Watch out, A-Train's coming.

You were a fan!

You were a fan, and
not, like, a dabbler, no,

00:21:22,962 --> 00:21:25,171
you were super fan 99.

Excuse me, sir.

396
00:21:26,382 --> 00:21:27,966
- W-What is this about?
- Shut the fuck up.

397
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:30,510
Dad, it's gonna be okay. Hey.

398
00:21:30,511 --> 00:21:33,054
I came alone.

399
00:21:33,055 --> 00:21:35,224
You let him go.

400
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:38,309
Alone, huh?

401
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,228
- Wow.
- Ah!

402
00:21:40,229 --> 00:21:41,938
You really did come alone.

403
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:44,315
Next time... there's not gonna
be a next time, but next time...

404
00:21:44,316 --> 00:21:47,902
have at least a few
cards up your sleeve.

405
00:21:47,903 --> 00:21:51,740
Okay. You mean, um, you mean, like this?

406
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:57,453
- Jonesing for a little jet fuel?
- W-What is that?

407
00:21:57,454 --> 00:21:59,414
I don't know what that shit is.

408
00:21:59,415 --> 00:22:01,082
Oh, you don't?

409
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:03,876
So you don't mind if I do this.

410
00:22:03,877 --> 00:22:04,877
- No, fuck!
- What?

411
00:22:04,878 --> 00:22:06,254
What the fuck is wrong with you?

412
00:22:06,255 --> 00:22:07,422
I have a bigger dose.

413
00:22:07,423 --> 00:22:09,007
I have a real dose
hidden somewhere outside.

414
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:10,591
Let him go, I hand it over,

415
00:22:10,592 --> 00:22:12,969
then you can do whatever
you want with me.

416
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,722
Now tell me what's better,
the rush or knowing that,

417
00:22:15,723 --> 00:22:17,891
as long as you take it,
you'll be the fastest?

418

If you try anything,

419
00:22:28,736 --> 00:22:31,446
I can catch up to dear
old daddy in a millisecond.

420
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:33,323
- Dad, time to go.
- Not without you.

421
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:34,699
I'll be right behind you.

422
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,326
I am not leaving you
with him, all right?

I'll be all right.

I got this.

427
00:22:46,503 --> 00:22:48,514

through a human being for.

Oh, my God, man, that was an accident.

00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,233
- Where the fuck is the V?
- That accident had a name.

She had a name, too.

in my life is gone now.

What is this, man? I kill your
girlfriend and you kill mine?

439
00:23:22,664 --> 00:23:24,082
I didn't kill your girlfriend.

440
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,750
You used her.

441
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:27,668
You put her in danger,

442
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:30,506
and then you threw her out
like she was fucking garbage.

How does this not all
start with you, Hughie?

444

The only difference between you and me

445
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:38,221
is that I made a mistake.

446

that you were done with Billy Butcher.

458

I know, I get it.
Everything Butcher touches

- turns to flaming hot shit.
- No, I ain't blaming him.

Last I checked, you're a grown-ass man.

It's my fault, okay?

462
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:16,509
But we can't do this right now.

463

thinking twice, Marvin.

Oh, my goodness, this is beautiful.

gonna take us on a sleepover.

Can you help Mommy pack your toys?

- Good girl.
- Baby, we're running late.

We don't have time to pack toys.

474

We got to go.

I knew you'd vote your
conscience, Senator.
