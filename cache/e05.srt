<i>If I trusted which I didn't at all.</i>

326
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,791
<i>On the fact that
my luck can change.</i>

327
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:20,855
<i>If you get used to getting
kicked around by life,</i>

328
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:24,285
<i>you start to fear
the beautiful smile of life.</i>

329
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:30,164
<i>But on this day, I thanked
the God after a long time.</i>

330
00:24:30,791 --> 00:24:35,295
<i>Indeed. He delays but never denies.</i>

331
00:25:20,204 --> 00:25:23,180
