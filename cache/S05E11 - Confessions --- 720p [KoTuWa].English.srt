1
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,310
Hey, Mr. White. It's me. Um,

2
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,190
I know you're probably

3
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,190
real busy with retirement

4
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,080
but I got some news I think

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,080
you should maybe know about.

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,470
Me and Declan had some

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,470
differences of opinion

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,270
and it got a little...

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,870
messy. Um...

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,110
It's all straightened out now

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,390
but just a heads-up, there's been

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,390
a kind of change in management.

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,790
Anyway, just thought

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,790
you should know.

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,470
Feel free to give me a call

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,470
if you want the details

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,790
but, you know, it's cool,

18
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,790
so whatever.

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,630
Okay, then. Thanks. Bye.

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,790
Right, so there I am,

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,790
I'm on top of the train,

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,350
pumping the water in,

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,350
he's watching to make sure

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,350
we put in

25
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,830
exactly what he'd calculated.

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,350
We gotta be real precise

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,350
because water and methylene

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,350
weigh different

29
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,040
and he figured it all out

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,590
to, like, milliliter.

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,590
I'm up there with my hose,

32
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,470
we're going as fast as we can.

33
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,470
We only got a few minutes.

34
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,790
At the crossing, we got this guy

35
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,790
who's smooth-talking the engineer.

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,510
And it's all just going great

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,350
until this other dude shows up

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,350
in this monster truck

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,070
so we're pretty much screwed,

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,070
because he can just push

41
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,710
the entire dump truck off the tracks,

42
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,710
which, you know, is what he does.

43
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,200
Wait. What's your guy doing?

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,910
You can't stop him?

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,910
Yeah, but what's he gonna say?

46
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,670
"Thanks anyway, sir, but my friends

47
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,670
are still stealing cargo back there."

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,480
So I'm looking all around,

49
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,480
because I know we're not done,

50
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,590
but the gallons

51
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,590
are slowly ticking away.

52
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,590
And finally Mr. White

53
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,590
tells me to cut it.

54
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,950
So I fling the hose,

55
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,950
I'm grabbing the cap,

56
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,950
I'm screwing in the bolts.

57
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,110
Just, like, busting ass, you know?

58
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,590
And then I feel the train

59
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,590
start moving and I'm--

60
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,510
You're...

61
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,510
I'm on top.

62
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,150
Did you piss your pants?

63
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,150
Yeah, right?

64
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,630
So the thing starts speeding up,

65
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,630
so I jump off the moving train.

66
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,070
Like, total stuntman stuff.

67
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,590
It's like Hooper.

68
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,590
You ever see Hooper?

69
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,550
Oh, hey, man, Burt Reynolds.

70
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,550
Good movie.

71
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,550
He jumped out of a helicopter,

72
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,550
not a train.

73
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,150
Whatever, man.

74
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,150
It's a good movie.

75
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,990
This guy Jesse, he's underneath,

76
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,990
and the train just drives right over him.

77
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,510
And luckily

78
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,510
he's this skinny little guy.

79
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,630
Damn.

80
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,630
That's a tight operation.

81
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,390
It was perfect.

82
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,710
No one even knew

83
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,710
they got robbed,

84
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,710
just like we planned.

85
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,630
Mr. White told me it was, like,

86
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,630
the biggest train heist ever,

87
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,630
like, potential money-wise.

88
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,990
So that's how that happened.

89
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,990
Ha, ha.

90
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,590
Can I get you anything else?

91
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,870
Nope. Thanks, darling.

92
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,070
I'm ready for the check.

93
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,240
You feeling good

94
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,240
about cooking?

95
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,870
Yeah.

96
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,870
You'll be able to

97
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,870
run your own lab?

98
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,830
Do it up right?

99
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,830
Yeah. For sure. I got this.

100
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,950
All right.

101
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,480
Let's make some money, then.

102
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,480
I gotta hit the head.

103
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,990
Ever been on a plane

104
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,990
and find yourself

105
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,350
looking down at the armrest

106
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,350
next to you,

107
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,560
looking at the little plug

108
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,560
where the ashtray used to go?

109
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,270
I look at that and I say,

110
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,270
"What the hell happened

111
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,270
to this country?"

112
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,790
Nanny state.

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,830
I see a kid with

114
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,830
a bicycle helmet on,

115
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,550
I wanna smack the shit out of him,

116
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,550
like, for his own good.

Mr. Pinkman.

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,030
How are you today?

129
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,270
Not so good, huh?

130
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,190
Of course, I might be able

131
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,190
to help you out.

132
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,590
I wanna talk to you about

133
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,590
your partner, Heisenberg.

134
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,550
See, I know

135
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,550
he's my brother-in-law, Walt.

136
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,830
Oh, yeah. That's the look.

137
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,430
Lucky for you,

138
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,430
I'm more interested in him.

139
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,830
So I got an offer.

140
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,990
If you help me out here,

141
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,550
tell me all about you and him

142
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,550
and your little meth business,

143
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,550
maybe I talk to my friends

144
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,550
at the A.P.D.

145
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,750
and make all this go away.

146
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,080
I know he's the mastermind here.

147
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,310
Plus...

148
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,870
I'm thinking,

149
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,870
based on your recent activities,

150
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,430
that maybe there's

151
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,430
a little trouble in paradise?

152
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,350
Maybe you guys aren't

153
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,350
getting along so good?

154
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,910
I'm right, aren't I?

155
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,630
Eat me.

156
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,150
Sure that's how

157
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,150
you want to play this?

158
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,120
Why don't you try

159
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,120
and beat it out of me?

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,590
That's your thing, right?

161
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,590
He really did a number on you,

162
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,590
didn't he?

163
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,990
I don't know,

164
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,950
but happy people

165
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,950
usually don't go around

166
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,710
throwing millions of dollars away.

167
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,310
I don't think

168
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,230
Walt's gonna be patting you

169
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,230
on the back for that.

170
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,910
But maybe that's the point.

171
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,150
But, you see, I get that.

172
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,870
My own brother-in-law,

173
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,150
lying to me for over a year.

174
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,270
Using me.

175
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,990
Maybe you understand

176
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,990
that feeling.

177
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,350
Help me out here, Jesse...

178
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,790
and we can put him away.

179
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,590
I know you want that.

180
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,870
I think you wanna talk.

181
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,150
Not to you.

182
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,150
Agent Schrader,

183
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,150
beat any good suspects lately?

184
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,070
Tall and taller, ask him

185
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,070
about his history with my client.

186
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,070
He knocked the poor kid

187
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,070
unconscious last time

188
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,070
they were alone.

189
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,310
So, what'll it be, a civil rights

190
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,310
lawsuit the size of Montana?

191
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,030
Because I'll oblige you.

192
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,230
Oh. So long, Rocky.

193
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,230
Keep your left up.

194
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,350
Detectives,

195
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,350
I'm inviting you to leave.

196
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,750
I'm gonna try to remain calm,

197
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,470
but will you do me a favor

198
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,470
and tell me what is up with you?

199
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,790
My guys are busting their asses

200
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,390
trying to hide Walt's money

201
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,390
from the feds

202
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,710
and you're tossing yours

203
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,710
out a window?

204
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,350
And I have to hear about

205
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,350
your little act of philanthropy

206
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,350
on the news?

207
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,310
Did you hit your head

208
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,310
or something?

209
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,200
Why didn't you call me

210
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,200
the second you got arrested?

211
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,070
What did you say

212
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,070
to Schrader?

213
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,150
Nothing. Jesus. Just chill out.

214
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,880
Chill out? No.

215
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,880
No, I don't chill out right now

216
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,470
because things

217
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,470
have gone nuclear.

218
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,190
I imagine Schrader shared

219
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,190
with you his recent discovery.

220
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,430
Okay, well, then you get

221
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,430
my complete lack of chill.

222
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,360
Just use the money

223
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,360
that I gave you.

224
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,310
No, Saul. Saul, I--

225
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,510
Stop-- Saul.

226
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,030
Stop talking. I don't care.

227
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,710
Just-- Just make it happen.

228
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,710
Work your magic.

229
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,990
And call me when he's out.

230
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,870
Hey, Dad, I'm home.

231
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,600
Oh, okay. I'll be right out.

232
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,750
Hey, you going to work today?

233
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,750
You were out late last night.

234
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,070
Huh? I-- Well, I, uh...

235
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,230
Yeah, I guess I just lost track of time.

236
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,470
Dad.

237
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,470
Huh?

238
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,470
I'm gonna head out, okay?

239
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,710
Where you going?

240
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,710
Uh, Aunt Marie just called.

241
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,070
She wants me to help her

242
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,070
with some computer thing

243
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,270
and asked me to stay for dinner.

244
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,990
That cool?

245
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,390
Uh... I guess that--

246
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,750
Cool. All right, see you later.

247
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,310
Wait, uh, son?

248
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,350
Junior. Hang on a second.

249
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,350
Yeah?

250
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,470
Oh, good. Come on back inside.

251
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,470
What happened?

252
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,990
Oh, this? Nothing.

253
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,990
No, I'm fine. It's fine.

254
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,070
Really. I do wanna talk to you, though.

255
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,070
Okay. Are you okay?

256
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,350
Yeah. Here.

257
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,350
Sit down a second.

258
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,790
I just don't wanna keep things

259
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,790
from you, okay?

260
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,110
I mean, you deserve to know

261
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,110
what's happening.

262
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,310
Yesterday, I passed out.

263
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,550
Briefly. Very, very briefly.

264
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,790
And I did this.

265
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,710
Why did you pass out?

266
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,150
Well, my latest scans

267
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,390
show a little shadow on my lung.

268
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,030
But my doctor put me right on

269
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,030
a new round of chemo,

270
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,310
which is why

271
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,310
I've been so tired lately.

272
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,230
But I was pushing myself too hard.

273
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,390
I know it.

274
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,390
I just don't want you to worry.

275
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,590
I learned my lesson.

276
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,230
Well, um, what's the...?

277
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,160
What now?

278
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,790
What now is that we go on,

279
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,790
like always. Right?

280
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,880
Hey, don't worry about this,

281
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,880
okay?

282
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,030
I know that's hard,

283
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,030
but I beat this once.

284
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,110
There's no reason to think

285
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,110
I won't again.

286
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,550
And my doctor says

287
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,550
I'm doing great.

288
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,470
I'm responding really well

289
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,470
to the treatment.

290
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,350
And I'm...

291
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,030
I'm feeling very--

292
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,030
Very good about this, all right?

293
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,800
And what would really

294
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,800
help me out

295
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,070
is if we all stayed positive.

296
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,710
Can we do that?

297
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,990
Yeah?

298
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,550
Hm?

299
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,630
Okay.

300
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,350
So why don't you go

301
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,350
and help your Aunt Marie

302
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,510
and we'll talk about this later?

303
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,510
No. No. No way.

304
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,390
I'm staying. I'm not leaving.

305
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,910
Flynn is not with you, is he?

306
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,910
No.

307
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,910
No. Why would he be?

308
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,750
How'd it go?

309
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,790
That bad, huh?

310
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,750
How bad are we talking, Hank?

311
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,230
I didn't tell them.

312
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,950
Why not?

313
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,430
It's just not time yet.

314
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,430
No, it's past time.

315
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,100
Way past time.

316
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,100
We talked about this.

317
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,630
You've got to tell them now.

318
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,630
It's gonna be worse

319
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,710
if they find out that

320
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,710
you've kept this from them.

321
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,110
Look, it's just

322
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,110
I've got some things

323
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,110
I gotta chase down.

324
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,070
What? What things?

325
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,990
Leads, you know.

326
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,990
What leads? What? Something new?

327
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,920
I'm not keeping anything

328
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,920
from anybody, Marie, okay?

329
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,920
Jesus.

330
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,230
Don't tell me how to do my job.

331
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,150
Walt.

332
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,710
Are you sure about this?

333
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,590
It's the only way.

334
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,430
Okay.

335
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,630
I'm ready.

336
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,710
My name is Walter Hartwell White.

337
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,310
I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,

338
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,230
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.

339
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,790
This is my confession.

340
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,550
They're here.

341
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,270
Thank you for coming.

342
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,830
Okay, I'll start.

343
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,670
Skyler and I--

344
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,670
Welcome to Garduño's.

345
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,030
My name is Trent.

346
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,030
I'll be taking care of you.

347
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,110
Can I start anybody off

348
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,110
with some beverages?

349
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,110
Margarita?

350
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,670
How about some of

351
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,670
our tableside guacamole?

352
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,750
I think we're fine.

353
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,750
We need some time

354
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,750
with the menu.

355
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,310
No worries.

356
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,310
Be right back with some water.

357
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,430
So you here to confess?

358
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,900
There's nothing to confess.

359
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,150
We're here to talk about Walter, Jr.

360
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,990
Flynn and Holly should be

361
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,990
living with us. End of story.

362
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,910
And while

363
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,910
we respect your opinion,

364
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,260
we think that your concern

365
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,260
is misplaced.

366
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,470
Skyler and I feel,

367
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,470
due to Marie's attempt

368
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,270
to lure him to your house--

369
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,670
I wasn't trying to lure him.

370
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,950
Regardless

371
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,950
of what you might call it,

372
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,900
Skyler and I

373
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,900
would like to ask you

374
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,350
to please leave

375
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,350
our children out of this.

376
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,430
Junior has been through

377
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,430
a lot already this year.

378
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,710
You are just...

379
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,030
This investigation, Hank,

380
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,870
do you realize

381
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,870
what this will do to him?

382
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,230
Hearing these things?

383
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,590
He's gonna hear it when I kick in

384
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,590
your front door and arrest you.

385
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,470
If that day ever comes,

386
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,470
so be it.

387
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,030
You have no evidence

388
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,030
to support your claims.

389
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,550
Why tear this family apart?

390
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,670
So how about that guacamole?

391
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,910
We make it right here

392
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,910
at the table.

393
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,280
I'll just give you guys

394
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,280
a few more minutes.

395
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,830
How can you sit there

396
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,830
and listen to this?

397
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,670
All we want is for those kids

398
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,670
to be safe.

399
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,150
You're putting them in danger,

400
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,150
keeping them under the same roof--

401
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,150
They are safe, Marie.

402
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,430
You yourself sent them out of the house.

403
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,430
And I brought them back.

404
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,230
Look, whatever you think he did,

405
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,960
this is not an ongoing situation.

406
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,310
Skyler.

407
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,310
No.

408
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,390
They need to understand.

409
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,390
It's in the past.

410
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,830
It's over.

411
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,830
There is nothing to go after here.

412
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,440
There's nothing to accomplish.

413
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,230
How can we believe

414
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,230
anything you say?

415
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,150
There's no telling

416
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,150
where the lies begin and end.

417
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,710
That affair of yours,

418
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,710
did that even happen?

419
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,920
Please. Look,

420
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,920
Junior just found out

421
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,920
that my cancer is back.

422
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,070
He's already facing the idea

423
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,070
of living without his father.

424
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,630
To put this on top of that?

425
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,920
It's just not right.

426
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,800
I swear to God,

427
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,800
you start throwing

428
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,800
the word "right" at me--

429
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,270
What I mean--

430
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,270
Was it right to run a drug empire?

431
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,310
There is no drug empire.

432
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,110
Lying to your son,

433
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,110
to all of us, is that right?

434
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,390
What do I have to do

435
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,390
to make you believe me?

436
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,510
Why don't you kill yourself,

437
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,510
Walt?

438
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,150
- What?

439
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,150
- Just kill yourself.

440
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,230
This whole thing dies with you.

441
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,230
That's what you're saying here?

442
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,230
Is that Hank should just let it go

443
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,230
and wait for you to die.

444
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,790
Well, maybe you should just

445
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,790
go ahead and die, then.

446
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,190
That is not a solution.

447
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,190
No, it's not a solution.

448
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,630
He's not getting off that easy.

449
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,630
Jesus, Hank.

450
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,750
And the same goes for you

451
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,750
if you stick with him.

452
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,350
Both of you think you're

453
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,350
just gonna walk away

454
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,350
from this thing?

455
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,390
Never gonna happen.

456
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,950
That is not what we're saying.

457
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,950
Enough with the bullshit.

458
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,710
You're not gonna negotiate

459
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,710
your way out of this thing.

460
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,840
There's only one solution: Step up,

461
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,840
be a man and admit what you've done.

462
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,150
That's it. There is no other option.

463
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,710
Let's go.

464
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,780
My name is Walter Hartwell White.

465
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,640
I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,

466
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,470
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.

467
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,390
This is my confession.

468
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,990
If you're watching this tape,

469
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,350
I'm probably dead,

470
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,350
murdered by my brother-in-law,

471
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,350
Hank Schrader.

472
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,190
Hank has been building

473
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,190
a meth empire

474
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,150
for over a year now

475
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,150
and using me as his chemist.

476
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,030
Shortly after my 50th birthday,

477
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,550
he asked that I use

478
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,550
my chemistry knowledge

479
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,870
to cook methamphetamine,

480
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,870
which he would then sell

481
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,950
using connections that he made

482
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,950
through his career with the DEA.

483
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,150
I was astounded. I...

484
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,750
I always thought Hank

485
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,750
was a very moral man

486
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,950
and I was particularly

487
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,950
vulnerable at the time,

488
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,670
something he knew

489
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,990
and took advantage of.

490
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,760
I was reeling

491
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,760
from a cancer diagnosis

492
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,630
that was poised

493
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,630
to bankrupt my family.

494
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,790
Hank took me on a ride-along

495
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,790
and showed me just how much money

496
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,790
even a small meth operation

497
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,790
could make.

498
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,150
And I was weak.

499
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,550
I didn't want my family

500
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,550
to go into financial ruin,

501
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,310
so I agreed.

502
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,950
Hank had a partner, a businessman

503
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,950
named Gustavo Fring.

504
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,230
Hank sold me into servitude

505
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,230
to this man,

506
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,790
and when I tried to quit,

507
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,790
Fring threatened my family.

508
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,950
I didn't know where to turn.

509
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,070
Eventually, Hank and Fring

510
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,070
had a falling out

511
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,270
and things escalated.

512
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,230
Fring was able to arrange...

513
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,500
Uh, I guess--

514
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,500
I guess you call it a hit on Hank.

515
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,590
It failed,

516
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,590
but Hank was seriously injured

517
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,030
and I wound up

518
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,030
paying his medical bills,

519
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,310
which amounted

520
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,310
to a little over $1 77,000.

521
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,710
Upon recovery,

522
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,710
Hank was bent on revenge.

523
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,790
Working with a man

524
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,790
named Hector Salamanca,

525
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,870
he plotted to kill Fring.

526
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,820
The bomb that he used

527
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,820
was built by me.

528
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,800
He gave me no option in that.

529
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,870
I have often contemplated suicide,

530
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,270
but I'm a coward.

531
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,070
I wanted to go to the police...

532
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,230
but I was frightened.

533
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,190
Hank had risen to become the head

534
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,190
of the Albuquerque DEA.

535
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,590
To keep me in line,

536
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,590
he took my children.

537
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,400
For three months he kept them.

538
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,070
My wife had no idea

539
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,070
of my criminal activities,

540
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,150
was horrified to learn

541
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,150
what I had done.

542
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,870
I was in hell.

543
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,310
I hated myself for what

544
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,310
I had brought upon my family.

545
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,910
Recently, I tried once again to quit,

546
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,150
and in response, he gave me this.

547
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,870
I can't take this anymore.

548
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,240
I live in fear every day

549
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,240
that Hank will kill me

550
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,510
or worse, hurt my family.

551
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:19,030
All I could think to do

552
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:19,030
was to make this video

553
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,670
and hope that the world

554
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,670
will finally see this man

555
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,630
for what he really is.

556
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,470
Who do you think

557
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,470
he's shown this to?

558
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,550
No one. It's a threat.

559
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,430
It's what he will do

560
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,430
if I don't back off.

561
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,230
I think you should

562
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,230
show this to Ramey.

563
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,470
Just get ahead of it.

564
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,460
That video is a bunch of lies, Hank.

565
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,460
Anybody who knows you will know.

566
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,870
A hundred and seventy-seven

567
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,870
thousand dollars?

568
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,750
Hell is he talking about?

569
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,230
Marie?

570
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,110
They told me

571
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,110
it was gambling money.

572
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,550
What was gambling money?

573
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,350
Oh, Jesus Christ, Marie.

574
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,110
Oh, God, no.

575
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,110
How was I supposed to know?

576
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,150
How was I to know

577
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,150
where it came from?

578
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,270
Why were they paying for my bills?

579
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,270
What about my insurance?

580
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,350
Insurance wouldn't have covered

581
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,350
the treatment you needed, and I...

582
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,110
I wanted the best for you.

583
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,110
Why didn't you tell me?

584
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,590
Because I knew that

585
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,590
you would refuse it

586
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,990
and without it, you may never

587
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,990
have been able to walk again.

588
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,750
Oh, Christ, Marie.

589
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,750
You killed me here.

590
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,950
I mean, it's the-- It's the last nail.

591
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,590
That's the last nail in the coffin.

592
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,670
What do we do?

593
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,280
If I were you,

594
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,280
I'd be more nervous.

595
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,590
Ugh. Jesus.

596
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,270
It's always the desert.

597
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,270
Uh, I already checked it.

598
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,390
It's clean. I wouldn't have

599
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,390
driven it here if it wasn't.

600
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,750
Get one of these,

601
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,750
by the way.

602
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,110
Reads radio signals.

603
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,110
Much easier.

604
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,880
What does he know?

605
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,790
I mean, he knows you're Heisenberg.

606
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,950
But I figure not much else,

607
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,270
otherwise, you know,

608
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,270
you'd be locked up.

609
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,150
What did he say exactly?

610
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,470
He wants me

611
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,470
to inform on you for him.

612
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,630
Tell him everything we did.

613
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,990
Anything else?

614
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,630
I don't think he's told

615
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,630
the rest of the DEA.

616
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,070
Why do you say that?

617
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,990
Just him being there all by himself

618
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,750
and, plus,

619
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,750
he was acting kind of shady.

620
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,430
Seemed like

621
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,430
he didn't want the other cops

622
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,270
hearing what he had to say.

623
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,270
Mm.

624
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,270
Are we gonna talk about

625
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,270
the rain of caca the kid

626
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,270
brought down upon us?

627
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,270
Want to hazard a guess

628
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,270
what his little charity drive cost you?

629
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,510
Why don't you go

630
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,510
take a walk, Saul?

631
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,350
Jesse, will you let me help you?

632
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,390
I don't like to see you

633
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,390
hurting like this.

634
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,630
Maybe it's time for a change.

635
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,990
What kind of change?

636
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,270
I don't know.

637
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,670
I don't know, maybe...

638
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,630
Maybe it's time

639
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,630
for you to just

640
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,960
leave all of this behind.

641
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,870
Just get out of town.

642
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,830
Don't look back.

643
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,950
Saul knows a man.

644
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,350
He specializes in giving people

645
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,350
new identities.

646
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,150
He would move you

647
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,150
someplace far away

648
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,150
and set you up

649
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,150
with a whole new life.

650
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,270
Yeah, I know,

651
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,270
sounds a little extreme.

652
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,590
But maybe it's exactly

653
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,590
what you need.

654
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,830
You know, I really think

655
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,830
that would be good for you.

656
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,750
A clean slate.

657
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,580
All right, just think about it.

658
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,270
You get a job, something

659
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,270
legitimate, something you like.

660
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,790
Meet a girl,

661
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,790
start a family, even.

662
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,310
Hell, you're still

663
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,310
so damn young. Heh.

664
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,310
And what's here

665
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,310
for you now anyway?

666
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,710
I tell you, if I could,

667
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,710
I'd trade places.

668
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,150
A whole lifetime

669
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,150
ahead of you

670
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,230
with a chance to hit

671
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,230
the reset button.

672
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,710
In a few years,

673
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,990
this might all feel like

674
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,990
nothing more than a bad dream.

675
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,950
Would you just, for once,

676
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,390
stop working me?

677
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,270
What are you talking about?

678
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,030
Can you just stop

679
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,030
working me for, like,

680
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,030
10 seconds straight?

681
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,350
Huh? Stop jerking me around?

682
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,420
Jesse, I am not working you.

683
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,990
Yes. Yes, you are.

684
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,070
All right, just drop the whole

685
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,070
concerned-dad thing

686
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,470
and tell me the truth.

687
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,070
I mean, you're acting like

688
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,700
me leaving town

689
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,700
is all about me

690
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:52,470
and turning over a new leaf,

691
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:52,470
but it's really-- It's really about you.

692
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,710
I mean, you need me gone

693
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,870
because your dickhead brother-in-law

694
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,870
is never gonna let up.

695
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,990
Just say so.

696
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,720
Just ask me for a favor.

697
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,470
Just tell me you don't

698
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,470
give a shit about me

699
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,390
and it's either this...

700
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:15,550
It's either this or you'll kill me

701
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:15,550
the same way you killed Mike.

702
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,750
I mean, isn't that

703
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,750
what this is all about?

704
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,230
Us meeting

705
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,230
way the hell out here.

706
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,520
In case I say no.

707
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,510
Come on.

708
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,630
Just tell me you need this.

709
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,190
Your change.

710
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,710
If you'll hand this

711
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,710
to your car wash professional

712
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,950
and have an A-1 day.

713
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,990
Skyler?

714
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,390
Skyler, I've got my chemo

715
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,390
in about 45 minutes.

716
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,470
Can you take over

717
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,470
the register for me?

718
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,670
Skyler?

719
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,270
It worked

720
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,190
and we're fine.

721
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,710
Okay?

722
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,470
We're fine.

723
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,070
So Palmer and Castanares

724
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,740
are sitting on that jerkoff

725
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,740
Saul Goodman's office,

726
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,750
keeping an eye on Jesse Pinkman.

727
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,750
Yeah, I put them on it.

728
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,830
You wanna explain that

729
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,830
to me?

730
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,150
Yeah. Right.

731
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,990
Why the hell should I know anything?

732
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,990
They're just my guys, after all.

733
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,590
You gotta tell me what's going on.

734
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,590
Pinkman is A.P.D.'s problem,

735
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,590
not ours.

736
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,310
You got a history with this kid.

737
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,590
If he catches wind

738
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,590
that you're trailing him

739
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,670
and this explodes,

740
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,670
he could sue.

741
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,950
Look, if I can't explain this

742
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,950
to Ramey, I gotta pull my guys.

743
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,430
Fine. Take them off.

744
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,510
I said, take them off.

745
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,510
What else you want?

746
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,750
I'm going out for a while.

747
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,150
You have that 3:00.

748
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,990
Will you be back?

749
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,710
You know what, it's gonna have

750
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,710
to be another day. Reschedule it.

751
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,070
Last chance.

752
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,070
You sure there's nobody

753
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,070
you wanna say bye to?

754
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,030
Nobody at all?

755
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,710
No.

756
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,630
This is it. Once I make the call,

757
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,630
there's no take-backs.

758
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,800
Uh, I need a new dust filter

759
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,390
for my Hoover Max Extract

760
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,390
Pressure Pro, model 60.

761
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,790
Can you help me with that?

762
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,150
Yeah, pickup.

763
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,430
He's hot. Um, not "hot" hot,

764
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,430
just a little hot.

765
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,510
Currently out on bail.

766
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,510
Yeah, he knows the rules.

767
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,830
One hour.

768
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,830
Okay, he'll be there.

769
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,830
And done.

770
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,600
Okay,

771
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,190
this guy's fee is 125.

772
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,510
Your benefactor

773
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,320
asked me to send you out

774
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,320
with something extra.

775
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,910
Get you started, you know?

776
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,870
Keep you sitting pretty

777
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,870
until you get into the groove

778
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,870
of your new life.

779
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,040
Provided, of course, you don't

780
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,040
toss it out the window on the way.

781
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,110
Seriously, this is the last of it

782
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,150
so you might wanna think

783
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,150
about making a budget.

784
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,720
Hey, whoa, whoa,

785
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,720
what are you doing?

786
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,670
You can't fire up a doob

787
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,670
in here. Put that out.

788
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,750
I mean it. Put it out.

789
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,150
Look, Mr. Natural, I'm not

790
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,150
gonna let you sabotage this thing.

791
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,350
This guy is not gonna take you

792
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,350
if you show up high,

793
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,910
so stop screwing around,

794
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,910
or it's both our asses.

795
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,670
Right. Well, that's a start.

796
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,670
Now, give with the dope.

797
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,750
Christ.

798
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,070
Some people are immune

799
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,070
to good advice.

800
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,070
I'm gonna get a bag

801
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,070
for this cash.

802
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,390
Don't even think

803
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,390
about lighting up again.

804
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,950
Francesca,

805
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,950
we got any bags?

806
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,840
For money.

807
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,840
Money-sized bags.

808
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,750
Huell will drop you

809
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,750
at the pickup spot,

810
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,030
then he's gonna get

811
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,030
the hell out of there.

812
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,830
You got that?

813
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,990
Guy won't pick up the kid

814
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,990
if he's got company.

815
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,070
You got a phone?

816
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,840
Cops took it.

817
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,390
All right, in case

818
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,390
something goes wrong,

819
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,790
guy doesn't show, whatever,

820
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,790
you give me a call.

821
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,150
Seriously? Hello Kitty?

822
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,830
Seriously, it's free.

823
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,430
We got a beggars-choosers situation

824
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,430
here, so stop busting my balls.

825
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,150
Corner of Juan Tabo and Osuna.

826
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,030
You, you're gonna sit and wait.

827
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,030
This guy's punctual with a capital P.

828
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,070
Okay? So don't move.

829
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,070
Don't get up and get an ice cream.

830
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,430
Just stay put like a good boy.

831
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,430
He'll pick you up, you pay him.

832
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,830
He'll take your ID,

833
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,830
he'll give you a new one.

834
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,270
Goodbye, Jesse Pinkman.

835
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,270
Hello, Mr. Credit to Society.

836
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,870
So do I get to pick where I go?

837
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,350
Well, it's your life.

838
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,350
I imagine you get a say.

839
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,470
Want a suggestion?

840
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,470
How about Florida?

841
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,430
You get a tan,

842
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,430
meet the Swedish bikini team,

843
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,310
you know,

844
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,310
swim with the dolphins.

845
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,150
What about Alaska?

846
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,270
Alaska. Okay, well,

847
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,270
that's a different vibe.

848
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,630
I never figured you

849
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,630
for a moose lover,

850
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,310
but whatever floats your boat.

851
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,310
Alaska.

852
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,390
Alaska's good.

853
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,000
Anywhere you can get

854
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,000
a fresh start is gonna be good.

855
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,510
You ready?

856
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,470
Yeah.

857
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,470
Take care, Jesse.

858
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,910
All right.

859
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,680
Excuse me.

860
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,270
Hey, man, you can't go in there!

861
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,550
He a no-show?

862
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,550
Why didn't you call?

863
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,150
Why didn't you--?

864
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,310
Stop! Unh!

865
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,590
Code red!

866
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,950
Huell!

867
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,950
No! Hey!

868
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,390
Hey!

869
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,390
Get in here!

870
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,190
Back off!

871
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,990
You, stay where you are.

872
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,030
What? I don't know what

873
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,030
happened here. What did I do?

874
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,830
You stole it off me.

875
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,510
You and him, you took it

876
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,510
out of my pocket, didn't you?

877
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,190
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

878
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,190
Calm down. Yes. Okay.

879
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,190
I had Huell lift your dope.

880
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,790
I told you I couldn't risk

881
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,790
the guy not taking you.

882
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,510
No! Before. The cigarette.

883
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,320
You stole the cigarette.

884
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,350
What?

885
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,350
The ricin cigarette!

886
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,830
You had him steal it off of me!

887
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,430
And all for that asshole

888
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,430
Mr. White!

889
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,750
He poisoned Brock!

890
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,630
He poisoned Brock, and you--

891
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,630
You helped him!

892
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,910
Okay, Jesse, calm down.

893
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,910
Say it again!

894
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,510
Tell me one more time

895
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,510
to calm down! Come on!

896
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,550
I'm sorry. Yes. Okay.

897
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,320
I had Huell lift your cigarette,

898
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,320
but Walt made me.

899
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,550
He told me he was helping you,

900
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,550
he was saving you.

901
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,670
I never would've agreed to it

902
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,670
if I'd known what he was gonna do.

903
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,510
Jesse, you gotta believe me.

904
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,510
I didn't want any of this!

905
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,550
Back up!

906
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,150
Get off me!

907
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,150
What do I pay you for?

908
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:41,310
Hey, it's me. We got a big problem.

909
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,990
--eighteen, 19 and 20.

910
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,750
Actually, you gave me a 5,

911
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,750
not a 1.

912
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,790
Oh, I-- I did. I'm-- I'm so sorry.

913
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,030
Um, here you go.

914
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,750
Thank you for your honesty.

915
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,150
Oh, and please give this

916
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,150
to your car wash professional.

917
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,390
Have an A-1 day.

918
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,190
God.

919
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,240
Hey.

920
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,240
Hi.

921
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,590
What's going on?

922
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,590
Not much.

923
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,750
Yeah? Nothing?

924
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,750
Nope. Things are fine.

925
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,830
Good.

926
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,830
Why?

927
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,830
Oh, no reason.

928
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,270
You know what I found the other day

929
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,430
is that the-- The-- The latch

930
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,430
on the soda machine wasn't...

931
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,190
latching.

932
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,550
It's-- It's catching every time

933
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,550
that I stock that darn thing.

934
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,990
So I thought I'd check it out.

935
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,430
Great.

936
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,800
Thank you.

937
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,830
Oh. Exact change. I like that.

938
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,830
Thank you very much.

939
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,600
Okay.

940
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,950
And...

941
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,590
please give this

942
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,590
to your car-care professional

943
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,310
and have an A-1 day. Thank you.

944
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,310
Thank you.

945
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,270
I just remembered

946
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,270
they gave me a prescription

947
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,350
to go pick up, so... I forgot.

948
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,350
I'm gonna go

949
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,430
head on over

950
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,430
to the drugstore, okay?

951
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,790
Yeah, okay.

952
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,790
All right.
