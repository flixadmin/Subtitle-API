1
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:13,912
Jackie: Please! You must
let me have the talisman.

2
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:15,414
It is only
a matter of time

3
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:18,150
before the dark hand
tries to steal it.

4
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:20,285
We do so appreciate
the warning,

5
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,087
Mr., uh, chan,
was it?

6
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,589
However,
the museum security

7
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,090
has recently
been upgraded

8
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:26,759
to ensure the safety

9
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:29,428
of the world-famous
pink puma diamond.

10
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,570
If we can be
trusted to guard

11
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,839
a gem of
- such enormous value,

12
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,841
I'm sure that
your dark hand

13
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:44,610
will present
no serious threat.

14
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:45,744
Ugh!

15
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:48,881
Ohh!

16
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:51,583
I'm so sorry!
I broke your spy camera--

17
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:53,752
spy camera?!

18
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,075
Chan?!
- You!

19
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,810
Uh, dark hand guy!

20
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,829
Ow! Hey, I'm
walking here!

21
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,976
Whoa!

22
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,444
You're planning
a heist, aren't you?

23
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:26,879
When is it?

24
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,452
(Gasps)

25
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,755
(Cell phone ringing)
Aah!

26
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,393
(Using deep voice)
Uh, yeah?

27
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:44,296
Valmont: Is reconnaissance
complete, ratso?

28
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,065
Uh...Yeah!

29
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,968
Excellent. Then hit
the museum at midnight.

30
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,036
Tonight?!

31
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,504
Is there a problem?

32
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,873
Uh--ahem! No, boss!

33
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,977
(Sighs)
No problem at all.

34
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,849
Jackie: We can't let him
take the talisman.

35
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,918
The magic--

36
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,419
so, what you
gonna do?

37
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,421
Sneak into
the museum before
the bad guys do

38
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,023
and steal
the talisman
yourself?

39
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:14,026
Huh?! Steal?
What?! Ohh!

40
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,494
That's crazy, Jade.

41
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:17,462
You're crazy!

42
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:19,398
You totally <i> are</i>
gonna steal it!

43
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,266
Can I come
with you, Jackie?

44
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,367
No.

45
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,305
(Whining)
Jackie, please!

46
00:03:26,307 --> 00:03:28,240
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving!

47
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:29,641
It's Thanksgiving Eve.

48
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,543
Where's your
Turkey day spirit?

49
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,246
Jade, I really
want to spend
time with you,

50
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:35,447
but remember,

51
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,715
you came
into my life

52
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,784
the same day
as section 13

53
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:40,519
<i>and</i> the dark hand.

54
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:42,321
Things
have been hectic.

55
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:44,456
Now, you can't come
with me tonight,

56
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,258
but I promise
I'll take you

57
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,126
to the parade
tomorrow.

58
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,528
All right.

59
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,238
Humph!

60
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,743
Hmm. I said
I wouldn't come with.

61
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,945
Didn't say
I wouldn't follow.

62
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,094
11:00.

63
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:24,363
One hour till
company arrives.

64
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,621
Mmm! Wintergreen!

65
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,418
Oh, come on!

66
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,822
Oh! Ohh! Ah! Whoo!

67
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,861
Ah! Ohh! Whoo!

68
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:32,898
(Sighs heavily)

69
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,076
Hi, Jackie!
Aah!

70
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,279
No parade for you.

71
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,781
You got in!
You are so cool!

72
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:52,484
I'm not cool!
I'm breaking the law.

73
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,653
Uh-huh.

74
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:57,122
The clock
is ticking.

75
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:59,157
Uh, make
yourself useful.

76
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,057
I think this mirror
is broken.

77
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:08,860
Hyah!

78
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,379
Wow! She rules!

79
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,582
Uh, I mean...
Go, Jackie.

80
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,953
Hyah!
(Gasps)

81
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,889
(Both sigh)

82
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,297
You guys are
20 minutes early!

83
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,632
What guys?
I'm an independent.

84
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,935
You're not with
the dark hand?

85
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:52,304
Name's viper.

86
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,806
Both: Someone else
is after the talisman?!

87
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,476
Talisman? I just
nicked the pink puma.

88
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,911
Wow! When I grow up,

89
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:01,646
I wanna be
just like her!

90
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,315
(Gasps)
A criminal?!

91
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,717
A female
Jackie chan.

92
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,186
(Sputtering)
She is nothing
like me!

93
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,454
Uh, what's
with the minor?

94
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,356
Some kind of youth
outreach program?

95
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:12,591
Stay out this!

96
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:15,060
In fact, you are
under arrest!

97
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:18,430
You do realize we'd
both go to jail, right?

98
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:19,865
I am not
a crook!

99
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,867
I am an
archaeologist!

100
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:24,336
(Alarm going off)
Both: Way to go.

101
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,483
Viper!

102
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,585
Ok, no more
"follow the viper".

103
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,020
No problem!

104
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,724
(Sirens approaching)

105
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,727
Whoa! Jackie,
we're rich!

106
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,998
Ah! The puma?
Ohh! The talisman!

107
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,333
Viper! Come back!

108
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:57,002
Viper!

109
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,139
Don't go anywhere!

110
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,311
(Gasps)
Officer: Freeze!
Hands in the air!

111
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,929
Let's rock 'n' roll!

112
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:26,197
These saps
won't know what--

113
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:27,499
hit 'em?

114
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,415
Jackie chan?
A thief?

115
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,117
Well, perhaps there's
hope for him after all.

116
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:47,419
And what
a thief!

117
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,287
I mean,
the pink puma.

118
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,890
And the talisman.

119
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,895
Go directly
to jail, ratso.

120
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,830
If chan has the talisman,

121
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,899
this will lead you to it.

122
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,135
Uncle on phone:
Jackie...

123
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,504
Why did you steal
the pink puma?

124
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,373
There is no puma

125
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,241
in the Chinese
zodiac.

126
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,910
It has no magic!

127
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,347
I know, uncle.
It's complicated.

128
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:19,751
One more thing...
You are a criminal!

129
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,988
You are
- a very bad influence
on Jade!

130
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,590
I know!
That's why I need you

131
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:27,092
to take the next
flight here and--

132
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,793
one more thing--

133
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,696
oh, wait.
I am getting
another call.

134
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,565
Oh! No, no,
no, no, uncle!

135
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:34,866
You don't know
how to do that!

136
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:37,168
I--I am only allowed
one phone call!

137
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,472
Hello!
Uncle's rare finds.

138
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,107
May I help you?

139
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,541
(Dial tone)

140
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,678
Oh!

141
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,647
Officer: Chan, visitor.

142
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,550
Happy Thanksgiving, Jackie!

143
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:54,052
Jade, are you ok?

144
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:56,254
The "big meow"
is comfy cozy.

145
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,156
What?

146
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,125
"The cat"
is in the bag.

147
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,227
What?!

148
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:04,829
I have the pink puma!

149
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,499
Slipped it in my pocket
when you weren't looking.

150
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,734
Guess I sorta...
Pulled a viper.

151
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:12,370
Well, don't pull
any more vipers!

152
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:14,372
She's
a bad influence.

153
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,074
In fact,
hand the puma over

154
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:17,475
to the police
right now.

155
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:20,111
Tsk! Like I was gonna
bring it in here!

156
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,313
Besides, we need to get
the talisman back.

157
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:23,648
Said so yourself.

158
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,450
I was thinking
I could track down viper

159
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:26,718
and arrange a trade.

160
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,453
We'll meet
under a rusty bridge!

161
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:31,523
Betcha New York
has tons of really cool
rusty old Bridges!

162
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,324
Jade, captain black
should be here

163
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,393
anytime to clear up
this whole mess.

164
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,728
Once I'm
out of jail,

165
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,496
<i>i</i> will find viper.

166
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:41,566
Ohh! You get to do
all the fun stuff!

167
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,401
This is
serious, Jade.

168
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:44,736
I still don't know
what power

169
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,671
the snake talisman
possesses.

170
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,606
Viper or
the entire city

171
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,408
could be in danger.

172
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,646
Baby face returned

173
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:56,181
to the scene
of the crime?

174
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,149
(Laughs) Why on earth

175
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,484
would he do
something so--

176
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:00,752
stupid.

177
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,523
What am I supposed
to do with this?

178
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:08,960
(Gasps)

179
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,732
Whoa!

180
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:15,533
(Viper's footsteps)

181
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,537
Now you see me.

182
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,807
Now you don't.

183
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,677
Hello, bro.

184
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,078
What do you want?

185
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,781
What rock is
the legless reptile under?

186
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,317
What?

187
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:35,820
Tell me where
the serpent sleeps.

188
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,590
What are you
talking about?

189
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,859
Where's
the snake talisman?!

190
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,794
Don't you read
the newspaper?

191
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,629
I took
the pink puma.

192
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,868
See? No talisman,
like the gizmo says.

193
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,669
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

194
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,472
my delicious
prison food
is getting cold.

195
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:57,342
I'll find it, chan!
Just a matter of time!

196
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,616
Huh?

197
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,050
(Footsteps)

198
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,329
(Screams)
A ghost!

199
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,331
Viper: Hey, there,
baby face. It's me!

200
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,300
Viper?
- The one and only.

201
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,903
And I discovered
your little trinket's
secret power.

202
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,638
Oh, really?
What does it--

203
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,306
d'oh! Never mind.

204
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:30,642
Enough chitchat.
Let's bust you
out of here.

205
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,043
What?! No!

206
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,179
I don't want
to be busted out!

207
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:35,914
You do if you want
your doohickey back.

208
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:36,981
Or should I just
sell the snake

209
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,850
to the highest
bidder?

210
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,120
Hey!

211
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:43,988
Viper: I got it.

212
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,890
Unh! Ohh! Whoa!

213
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:46,991
Viper: Follow me!

214
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,927
I can't see you--
whoa!

215
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,640
Jade: Psst! Psst!

216
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,577
Did you bring
the goods?

217
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,846
(Chuckles)
Who are you people?

218
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,015
Uh, this is not
a good idea.

219
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,317
This is
a felony!

220
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:15,119
You do want
your tchotcke back,
don't you?

221
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,324
Ohh! Just hurry

222
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,526
before
the dark hand
finds us.

223
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,831
You're all right,
Jade.

224
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,566
You got a sharp
criminal mind.

225
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:29,901
I do?!

226
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:32,871
No! Jade has a lousy
criminal mind! Come on!

227
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,039
Hey, viper!
Wanna come

228
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,841
to the parade
with us?
- Jade!

229
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:39,777
We're not going
to socialize
with a criminal.

230
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,347
Maybe another time.
Stay sharp, kid.

231
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,186
Jackie, you should
ask viper out on a date!

232
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,255
She'd be
such a cool aunt!

233
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,390
What the--

234
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,425
(gasps)
It's counterfeit!

235
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,131
Now she has the gem
<i>and</i> the talisman!

236
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:02,066
Viper
pulled a viper...

237
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:03,902
On me?

238
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,004
Old proverb...

239
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,940
"There is no honor
among thieves."

240
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:10,541
Let's find her.

241
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,210
Let's!

242
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,150
(Gasps)

243
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,285
Tea?

244
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,122
How'd you get past
my security system?

245
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,990
The talisman, please.

246
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,993
It's not for sale.

247
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,602
(Chuckles) Oh, I didn't
plan on buying it.

248
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,512
Fellas,
secure the talisman.

249
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,380
Viper: Can't have
what you can't see,
sugar.

250
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,382
And you can't hide

251
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,184
from the dark hand.

252
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:56,654
Let me go!

253
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,162
(Window opens)

254
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,268
The ledge! And while
you're at it,

255
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,370
pilfer the puma,
<i>por favor.</i>

256
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,080
Ugh! We lost her.

257
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,548
They didn't!

258
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,617
Look, Jade!

259
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,886
You get to watch
the parade after all!

260
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:31,489
Uh, wait here.
I'll get you a soda.

261
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,623
Grr!

262
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,994
I'm sorry!
I'll bring it back!
Thank you!

263
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,463
Hey!
- Look out!

264
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,531
Watch it!
Excuse me!
Sorry!

265
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,435
Jade: Unh!

266
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,772
Whoa! Heads up!

267
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,540
Ohh!

268
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,115
Jackie!

269
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,916
Hey, sorry about
the double cross.

270
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:01,319
But can you blame me?
It's my sign!

271
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,187
Snake. Viper. Get it?

272
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,156
(Sighs)

273
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,392
Here!

274
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:10,361
Jade: Make sure it's real
this time, Jackie.

275
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,930
And where's my soda?

276
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,332
D'oh! Ack!

277
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,268
(Gasps)
Company!

278
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,371
Whoa!

279
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,451
Whoa!
- Check it out!
Wow!

280
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,824
Jackie: Ha ha!
I'm here!

281
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:40,892
No, I'm here!

282
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,361
Or could I be here?
Or maybe here?

283
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,931
Ha ha! Perhaps
I'm over here!

284
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,100
Or maybe I'm
nowhere at all!

285
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,603
Oh.

286
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,273
(Screams)

287
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,850
Alley-oop!

288
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,087
Nice move.

289
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,856
Please! I do not socialize
with criminals.

290
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,666
Ow! Ugh! Aah! Unh!

291
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,002
Ooh!

292
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,179
Green is totally
your color.

293
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,448
Mine!

294
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:39,984
Aah!

295
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,456
(All screaming)

296
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,429
All: Whoa!

297
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,272
Well, I am getting
to see the sights.

298
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,350
What sights?

299
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,589
It just vanished!
Where'd it go?

300
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,929
(Sirens approaching)
That would be my cue.

301
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,697
Sorry I
let you down, kid.

302
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,633
Yeah, whatever.

303
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:31,035
And thanks for the save
back there, baby face.

304
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,603
I owe you one.

305
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,306
Then give me back
the puma!

306
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,440
I have to return it.

307
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,943
The police think
I took it. Please!

308
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,646
Uh, Jackie?

309
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:42,713
I know you told me

310
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:45,216
never to pull a viper
again, but...

311
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,152
She owed you one.

312
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,556
But how--
- officers: Freeze!

313
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,126
It's ok! I have it!
It's yours!

314
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:00,798
Real good. Now,
tell us what you did

315
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,900
with the statue
of Liberty.

316
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,543
Ernie: Hey, Jackie?
Yes?

317
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,745
Do you ever get scared
doing a stunt?

318
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:15,913
Yes, of course.

319
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:17,081
Every time when
I'm doing a stunt,

320
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,816
my heart just, like,
beating--boom-boom!

321
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,751
Chasing,
jump over the building,

322
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,687
across the motorcycle,

323
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:25,690
uh, into the car,
outside the car
in one shot.

324
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,793
I'm crazy,
but I'm not stupid.

325
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:29,894
I know how far
I can jump,

326
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,096
how high I can go.
Boom-boom!

327
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,564
Of course I'm afraid.
I'm not a Superman.

328
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,966
I just like to do it.

329
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:36,033
Especially
