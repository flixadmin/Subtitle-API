1
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,310
- Come on.
- Mm-mm.

2
00:00:43,349 --> 00:00:45,139
- Just come with.
- Nuh-uh.

3
00:00:45,184 --> 00:00:48,274
- Please?
- No fucking way.

4
00:00:48,312 --> 00:00:51,322
This may be
their last reunion tour ever.

5
00:00:51,357 --> 00:00:53,567
Yeah, I fucking hope so.

6
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:54,859
They're the best band.

7
00:00:54,902 --> 00:00:56,652
Oh, come off it.

8
00:00:56,696 --> 00:00:59,066
Look, I ain't stopping you.
If you really want to go,

9
00:00:59,115 --> 00:01:01,235
I'll buy you front row seats.
You can take Rachel.

10
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:03,084
I don't want to take Rachel.

11
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:05,579
I want you to come with me.

12
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:07,751
I would be forced to chop
my fucking ears off.

13
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,518
- I'll make a mess everywhere.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

14
00:01:09,542 --> 00:01:11,132
Then I would just have
to clean it up.

15
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,798
- You would?
- Yeah.

16
00:01:12,837 --> 00:01:14,797
Smart-ass.

17
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:16,469
You love it.

18
00:01:16,507 --> 00:01:18,467
- Do I?
- Yeah, you do.

19
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:19,969
Yeah.

20
00:03:04,615 --> 00:03:06,945
- Hi.
- Good morning.

21
00:03:10,538 --> 00:03:12,208
Morning, Deputy Director.

22
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:18,589
How did you get in here?

23
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:20,629
You're like the fucking mold

24
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:22,173
on my laundry room tiles.

25
00:03:22,216 --> 00:03:25,176
You scrape it off,
comes right back.

26
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:29,469
Sounds like you got a little bit
of a moisture problem, luv.

27
00:03:29,515 --> 00:03:31,635
Security, please.

28
00:03:31,684 --> 00:03:34,104
I can stop 'em getting Supes
in the military.

29
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:36,105
What makes you think I care?

30
00:03:36,147 --> 00:03:39,227
Personally, I can't wait
until they're in Syria.

31
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:41,525
Yeah, I'll bet.

32
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,110
Last week.

33
00:03:44,155 --> 00:03:46,315
A-Train, mainlining

34
00:03:46,365 --> 00:03:47,945
before the big race.
His fuck buddy,

35
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:49,372
Popclaw,

36
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,910
pinning the same stuff.

37
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:53,714
They call it Compound V.
It's some kind of

38
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:55,457
booster or steroid for Supes.

39
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:56,669
Jacks 'em right up.

40
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:58,749
Now, word gets out that Supes

41
00:03:58,794 --> 00:04:00,504
are nothing but a bunch
of juice junkies,

42
00:04:00,546 --> 00:04:03,166
no one's gonna want 'em
in national defense.

43
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:04,425
Mm-hmm.

44
00:04:04,467 --> 00:04:06,467
Got a sample?

45
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,260
Not yet.

46
00:04:08,304 --> 00:04:09,264
Mm.

47
00:04:09,305 --> 00:04:10,755
This could be heroin.

48
00:04:10,806 --> 00:04:12,476
It could be anything.

49
00:04:12,516 --> 00:04:13,806
You don't trust me.

50
00:04:13,851 --> 00:04:15,851
Susan, I am shocked and saddened
by that.

51
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:16,845
Really?

52
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:18,016
I'm sure.

53
00:04:18,063 --> 00:04:19,653
Speaking of which,

54
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,150
I haven't seen Translucent
around anywhere.

55
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:25,743
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

56
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:27,159
Cunt's invisible.

57
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:28,988
He could be standing
in that fucking corner,

58
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:31,243
plugging one out right now,
for all we know.

59
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:35,535
Look, you think Supes
are cunts now?

60
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:37,751
You just wait till
they're wearing camo.

61
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,501
I mean, what's to stop
Sergeant Homelander

62
00:04:39,543 --> 00:04:41,753
from killing a couple
of hundred thousand Chinese?

63
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:43,915
How are you gonna try him
for war crimes?

64
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:45,358
He's gonna murder
the bloody lot of us

65
00:04:45,382 --> 00:04:47,182
before he steps one foot
in The Hague.

66
00:04:47,218 --> 00:04:49,468
I mean, you might as well
hand the bloody launch keys

67
00:04:49,512 --> 00:04:50,932
over to Vought right now.

68
00:04:55,684 --> 00:04:57,904
You're really working
this one, huh?

69
00:04:57,937 --> 00:05:01,067
Just being
an upstanding citizen, luv.

70
00:05:01,106 --> 00:05:03,276
Oh, I know.

71
00:05:03,317 --> 00:05:06,277
Okay.

72
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,570
You get me some hard proof,

73
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:11,704
something actionable
that I can use,

74
00:05:11,742 --> 00:05:15,662
and maybe I'll throw you
a few bucks.

75
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:17,794
For your operating costs.

76
00:05:22,461 --> 00:05:24,671
But if you fuck me on this,

77
00:05:24,713 --> 00:05:27,553
for the rest of your life,
you'll be drinking your own piss

78
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:30,391
at a black site.

79
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:32,807
Say you understand.

80
00:05:32,846 --> 00:05:37,766
See, now, Susan, this is why
it never went anywhere with us.

81
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,440
You can't have two alpha males,
'cause inevitably someone's...

82
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,649
Say you fucking understand.

83
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:48,742
I understand.

84
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:51,029
Remind me, what was our deal?

85
00:05:51,073 --> 00:05:53,993
- What?
- What was our fucking deal?

86
00:05:54,034 --> 00:05:57,664
Go to hell. I already told you,
A-Train runs the Compound...

87
00:05:57,705 --> 00:06:00,245
Yeah, runs the Compound V to
the noodle shop up on Division.

88
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,041
We've been up on it all week
and we ain't seen fuck all.

89
00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:05,205
Well, wherever he's going,
it's around there,

90
00:06:05,254 --> 00:06:07,094
because every time
he leaves with the V,

91
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:09,359
he comes back with the sesame
noodles. That's all I know.

92
00:06:09,383 --> 00:06:11,093
Well, you'd better
be right, love,

93
00:06:11,135 --> 00:06:13,635
or you and your dearly
departed landlord

94
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:15,429
are gonna find yourselves
on Pornhub

95
00:06:15,472 --> 00:06:17,312
in the Fatal Cunnilingus
section.

96
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:19,599
You son of a bitch,
if you even...

97
00:06:23,355 --> 00:06:25,765
Sorry, baby, just, work's

98
00:06:25,816 --> 00:06:27,646
just been a motherfucker lately.

99
00:06:27,693 --> 00:06:29,629
You know I'd much rather be
at home, rubbing on them toes

100
00:06:29,653 --> 00:06:31,089
than out here breaking up
yard fights,

101
00:06:31,113 --> 00:06:33,453
but you know, a brother
got to get paid, right?

102
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,990
Oh, most definitely.

103
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:37,454
Payday comes, we gonna be
all up in Kay Jewelers,

104
00:06:37,494 --> 00:06:39,254
tearing it down.

105
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:40,828
Champagne showers.

106
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,535
I know, I know,
I'm just kidding.

107
00:06:45,586 --> 00:06:47,706
All right, sweetheart.
Talk to you.

108
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,049
Say something.

109
00:06:56,722 --> 00:06:58,682
Well, you know,
Jean-Paul Sartre said

110
00:06:58,724 --> 00:07:02,774
marriage stifles
our essential male urges.

111
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:05,771
Jean-Paul Sartre also died
a old, lonely motherfucker.

112
00:07:05,814 --> 00:07:07,484
Not to mention his girl

113
00:07:07,524 --> 00:07:09,074
was shacking up
with some other dude.

114
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:11,149
Uh, oui.
They were free to explore.

115
00:07:11,195 --> 00:07:13,445
Explore what? Gonorrhea?

116
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:15,449
Come on, Frenchie.

117
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:17,831
Why work so motherfucking hard
if you don't have somebody

118
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:19,868
to go home to and sleep
next to at night?

119
00:07:19,912 --> 00:07:22,712
Well, I go to sleep next to
someone different every night.

120
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:24,601
Yeah, and that's 'cause you're
an old, lonely fucker, too.

121
00:07:24,625 --> 00:07:26,625
- And you're gonna die by yourself.
- Mm.

122
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:28,629
Well, if you and Monique
have something so pure,

123
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:31,671
why are you lying to her
about where you are?

124
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,100
Noodle Guy. He's packing.

125
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:46,564
About time we see something.

126
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:29,312
We got to go in there, don't we?

127
00:08:29,356 --> 00:08:31,226
Don't be scared, petit Hughie.

128
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:34,525
Will you stop calling me that?
I'm, like, six feet tall.

129
00:09:29,124 --> 00:09:31,019
Let's hurry up, let's go.

130
00:09:31,043 --> 00:09:33,423
Check those boxes.

131
00:09:39,134 --> 00:09:41,144
Frenchie, look for the V.

132
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,940
Frenchie, come on, let's go,

133
00:09:49,978 --> 00:09:51,978
Check these boxes.

134
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:58,861
Come on, Frenchie,
what are you doing?

135
00:09:58,904 --> 00:10:00,994
Are you deaf?

136
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:05,043
Jesus.

137
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,961
Who's that?

138
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:14,961
I think we should let her go.

139
00:10:15,003 --> 00:10:18,053
No, no, no, no, no, uh-uh. We're
here for the V, and we get out.

140
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,760
This isn't a rescue.

141
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
You sound like Butcher.

142
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:24,144
I sound like a motherfucker
that wants to be breathing.

143
00:10:27,015 --> 00:10:29,555
Goddamn it, Frenchie,
what the...

144
00:10:31,395 --> 00:10:32,895
Hey! Don't set her free!

145
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:41,777
Oh, my God!

146
00:10:54,793 --> 00:10:56,303
Oh, fuck.

147
00:10:56,336 --> 00:10:58,336
Hughie, let's go!
Let's go, Hughie!

148
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,510
Come on!

149
00:11:23,322 --> 00:11:26,532
Couple weeks ago,
we were all getting...

150
00:11:26,575 --> 00:11:28,575
we were all getting wasted
in the common room.

151
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:30,999
It was, like,
Super Bowl, I think.

152
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,790
And I don't know.
Maybe I was just drunk, but...

153
00:11:38,462 --> 00:11:40,462
...you know, I tried.

154
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,180
I-I really tried...

155
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:47,298
to talk to the guys.

156
00:11:47,346 --> 00:11:49,306
About...?

157
00:11:49,348 --> 00:11:52,098
Dolphins.

158
00:11:52,142 --> 00:11:54,232
Did you know, in Japan,
that they

159
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:56,769
hunt down and slaughter
20,000 dolphins a year?

160
00:11:56,813 --> 00:11:58,773
Intelligent animals.

161
00:11:58,815 --> 00:12:02,105
Yeah,
that have regional accents, and

162
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:04,362
a great sense of humor.
I mean, they're...

163
00:12:04,404 --> 00:12:06,374
They're hilarious.

164
00:12:06,406 --> 00:12:09,366
Yeah.

165
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:12,289
And that night, A-Train

166
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:17,749
thought it'd be funny to stick
a blow-up dolphin in my bed.

167
00:12:17,793 --> 00:12:20,253
With lipstick on its blowhole.

168
00:12:20,295 --> 00:12:22,545
Yeah, real creative pricks.

169
00:12:26,051 --> 00:12:28,011
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:28,053 --> 00:12:30,183
That must have hurt.

171
00:12:32,432 --> 00:12:35,692
Yeah, I'm-I'm...
I'm the diversity hire.

172
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:38,057
I'm a joke.

173
00:12:40,065 --> 00:12:44,025
I mean, yeah,
I can talk to fish. So what?

174
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:48,369
How often do you need to be
saved by a school of salmon?

175
00:12:48,407 --> 00:12:51,487
Kevin, that's just not true.

176
00:12:51,535 --> 00:12:55,205
Where would that Carnival
cruise ship be without you?

177
00:12:55,247 --> 00:12:59,167
Yeah. I know.

178
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:05,671
Okay, I need to...
self-actualize,

179
00:13:05,716 --> 00:13:06,926
show more confidence.

180
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:10,217
After all, who are you?

181
00:13:10,262 --> 00:13:12,392
I'm one of The Seven.

182
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:14,021
And what does that mean?

183
00:13:14,057 --> 00:13:15,677
I can do anything
I set my mind to.

184
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:18,556
What do you want
to set your mind to?

185
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:48,223
What a mess.

186
00:13:48,258 --> 00:13:51,548
You all right?

187
00:13:51,595 --> 00:13:52,845
I mean, just when you think

188
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:54,282
this shit can't get
any more horrible...

189
00:13:54,306 --> 00:13:55,676
Nah, don't worry.

190
00:13:55,724 --> 00:13:58,894
It can get a lot more horrible.

191
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:20,327
Butcher, come check this out.

192
00:14:24,628 --> 00:14:26,958
Take a look.

193
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:30,799
V.

194
00:14:33,303 --> 00:14:34,853
So, A-Train's running it here,

195
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:37,218
and these blokes are dosing
the Asian bird with it.

196
00:14:37,265 --> 00:14:38,534
Yeah, back when
they had eyeballs.

197
00:14:38,558 --> 00:14:40,808
Yeah, but why?

198
00:14:40,852 --> 00:14:43,442
Is it a Vought thing or,
like, a side hustle?

199
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,190
Came gift-wrapped in this.

200
00:14:48,527 --> 00:14:50,647
Find out where it came from.

201
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:52,775
I'll shake a few trees.

202
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:55,779
Why the hell were they
dosing her?

203
00:14:55,826 --> 00:14:57,986
Why don't we ask
foie gras over here?

204
00:14:58,036 --> 00:14:59,996
He's the one that let her out.

205
00:15:00,038 --> 00:15:02,078
- She looked innocent.
- Innocent?

206
00:15:02,124 --> 00:15:05,634
She's locked up
in a cage, underground,

207
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:07,129
with two armed guards?

208
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,800
I had a feeling about her.

209
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:11,089
Nah, Frenchie,
you just didn't follow the plan.

210
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,513
You never follow the plan, man.

211
00:15:12,551 --> 00:15:14,301
You need to unclench
your asshole.

212
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:15,804
You need to eat
my clenched asshole,

213
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:17,532
- how 'bout that?
- Why are you two carrying on

214
00:15:17,556 --> 00:15:19,636
like a bunch of fucking twats?

215
00:15:19,683 --> 00:15:21,035
We're sniffing down
a shit sandwich

216
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:22,439
the size of Watergate.

217
00:15:22,477 --> 00:15:25,397
Vought and the Supes are both
gonna be looking for her.

218
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:28,568
All we got to do is
find the female first.

219
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:35,994
Keep looking.

220
00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:40,412
Who's that, then, eh?

221
00:15:40,453 --> 00:15:42,333
It's nobody.

222
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:50,551
"Annie?" Starlight?

223
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:52,608
Yeah, it's nothing.
I mean, we were supposed to

224
00:15:52,632 --> 00:15:53,842
go on a date.

225
00:15:53,884 --> 00:15:56,054
Not a date, just, she asked me

226
00:15:56,094 --> 00:15:58,054
if I wanted to ask her
for her number,

227
00:15:58,096 --> 00:15:59,323
and then we just
kind of platonically

228
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:00,616
exchanged information,
but the...

229
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,020
the word "date" was
never mentioned.

230
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:05,059
Call her back right now.
You're fucking going.

231
00:16:05,103 --> 00:16:09,573
As a rule, I don't usually
go out after a gory massacre.

232
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:11,398
Listen, here's the job.

233
00:16:11,443 --> 00:16:12,863
You're gonna hot mic her phone.

234
00:16:12,903 --> 00:16:15,203
From now on, we hear
everything she says.

235
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:17,568
I mean,
this is a golden opportunity.

236
00:16:17,616 --> 00:16:20,946
And after all you done,
piece of cake.

237
00:16:20,994 --> 00:16:25,004
Yeah, she's not a...
She's not a bad person.

238
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,665
She's a Supe, Hughie.

239
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:32,261
Just like the fucking rest
of them.

240
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:39,113
Okay, we are not gonna
be able to cover this up forever.

241
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:41,507
Translucent does not
show his face soon,

242
00:16:41,556 --> 00:16:42,926
people are gonna start
to notice.

243
00:16:42,974 --> 00:16:44,202
What if we just
get in front of it?

244
00:16:44,226 --> 00:16:46,136
Tell the world
he died tragically

245
00:16:46,186 --> 00:16:47,646
in the service of his country.

246
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:50,147
We could have an amazing
funeral, bigger than Kennedy's.

247
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,440
I don't know, admit that
one of our unkillable

248
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:54,114
superheroes just got killed?

249
00:16:54,152 --> 00:16:55,862
Kiss that military bill
good-bye.

250
00:16:55,904 --> 00:16:57,414
Let's not overthink it.

251
00:16:57,447 --> 00:16:59,317
We just say he's on
a classified mission.

252
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:03,196
We can't say where, in the
interest of national security.

253
00:17:03,245 --> 00:17:04,639
All we can say is
he's fighting MS-13.

254
00:17:04,663 --> 00:17:05,913
Ooh, yes. That's good.

255
00:17:05,956 --> 00:17:07,456
Simple. Done. Boom.

256
00:17:07,499 --> 00:17:09,579
MS-13. I like it.

257
00:17:09,626 --> 00:17:11,996
Hello?

258
00:17:13,755 --> 00:17:17,175
What? When?

259
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:21,805
How many people know?

260
00:17:21,846 --> 00:17:23,466
Seven minutes ago,

261
00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:25,845
Trans-Oceanic Flight 37
from Paris to Chicago

262
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:28,062
was hijacked mid-air.

263
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:29,483
- Seven minutes ago?
- Yeah.

264
00:17:29,521 --> 00:17:31,151
A source from NORAD
gave us a heads up.

265
00:17:31,189 --> 00:17:32,399
How many hijackers?

266
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,501
Well, looks like three.

267
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:35,275
Did they scramble F-16's?

268
00:17:35,318 --> 00:17:36,988
Yep, as we speak.

269
00:17:37,028 --> 00:17:39,738
But you can get there quicker.

270
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:42,721
Can I please have the room?

271
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,597
Oh, middle of the Atlantic.

272
00:17:46,621 --> 00:17:49,001
- Yep.
- No-man's-land.

273
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,960
You can't operate
on foreign soil,

274
00:17:51,001 --> 00:17:53,211
but a plane hijacked
over international waters...

275
00:17:53,253 --> 00:17:56,013
If you intercept,
no one will protest.

276
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:59,507
If you bring those passengers
back alive,

277
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,761
not one congressman
will have the balls

278
00:18:01,803 --> 00:18:03,723
to vote against our bill.

279
00:18:03,763 --> 00:18:05,683
Mm-hmm.

280
00:18:09,936 --> 00:18:12,396
This is our chance.

281
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:15,689
More important than Translucent.

282
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:18,574
More important than anything.

283
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:23,699
Concentrated halothane.

284
00:18:25,744 --> 00:18:28,204
It's not a guarantee,

285
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:30,536
but it should knock out
your girl.

286
00:18:30,582 --> 00:18:32,462
Merci, pumpkin.

287
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,460
I must go; this girl,
she's got a head start.

288
00:18:34,502 --> 00:18:38,212
Hey, I miss you.

289
00:18:38,256 --> 00:18:40,586
I got us a pied-á-terre
on the Bowery.

290
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:43,965
When will you be coming by?

291
00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:48,022
As soon as I can.

292
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:49,018
Promise.

293
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:50,059
- Promise?
- Mm-hmm.

294
00:18:53,313 --> 00:18:55,773
Don't make me use
that gas on you,

295
00:18:55,815 --> 00:18:57,645
huh, pumpkin?

296
00:18:57,692 --> 00:18:59,282
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

297
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:01,529
- Okay.
- Mm. Oh...

298
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:03,571
Mm.

299
00:19:28,264 --> 00:19:29,854
Fuck!

300
00:19:32,185 --> 00:19:35,605
When will they intercept?

301
00:19:35,647 --> 00:19:37,647
Corporal, I don't care
who is in the room with you,

302
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:40,400
I need a goddamn update.

303
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:42,323
Jesus.

304
00:19:42,362 --> 00:19:44,322
Hey. Do you have a second?

305
00:19:44,364 --> 00:19:46,034
It is not really a good time.

306
00:19:46,074 --> 00:19:48,334
I'd really appreciate it.
Super quick.

307
00:19:48,368 --> 00:19:50,908
- Pretty please? Thank you.
- No... Oh, okay.

308
00:19:50,954 --> 00:19:54,874
So... I found a mission.

309
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,076
Uh-huh.

310
00:19:56,126 --> 00:19:59,916
And I think
it's really important.

311
00:19:59,963 --> 00:20:02,553
And I'd like to do it,
with your permission, of course.

312
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,880
What? Where?

313
00:20:04,926 --> 00:20:07,966
- Oceanland.
- Oceanland?

314
00:20:08,012 --> 00:20:12,602
Yeah. So, get this,
the dolphins there,

315
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:16,982
I mean, they are really underfed
and abused.

316
00:20:17,021 --> 00:20:20,821
To be quite honest,
they're really frustrated.

317
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:23,649
And I'd like to, you know,
just shine a light on it.

318
00:20:23,695 --> 00:20:25,985
I think people would
really respond to that.

319
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,740
You do realize that you are
at the centerpiece

320
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:32,044
of the Oceanland fall campaign?

321
00:20:32,078 --> 00:20:34,248
Yeah, well, I mean, we could
just bail on that, right?

322
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:35,749
The deal sucks anyways.

323
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,290
No, we can't.

324
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,883
Listen, I'd just like to,
you know,

325
00:20:38,918 --> 00:20:41,838
maybe do something
with a little more substance.

326
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,800
Okay.

327
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,970
- Yeah?
- I hear you. Yes.

328
00:20:45,008 --> 00:20:46,048
- Okay?
- Uh-huh.

329
00:20:46,092 --> 00:20:49,142
Deep...

330
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:50,429
play to your strengths.

331
00:21:05,653 --> 00:21:08,203
Hey. baby.

332
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:10,119
Hey...

333
00:21:15,747 --> 00:21:17,367
What'd you do?

334
00:21:17,415 --> 00:21:20,125
What the hell are you
talking about?

335
00:21:20,168 --> 00:21:22,548
Who did you tell about
Compound V?

336
00:21:23,588 --> 00:21:26,298
Nobody. Why? What...

337
00:21:26,341 --> 00:21:29,301
Because you're the only
person who knew, other than me,

338
00:21:29,344 --> 00:21:32,764
that I had it...
where I was taking it.

339
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:36,425
I-I didn't tell anyone anything.

340
00:21:36,476 --> 00:21:37,766
You're being paranoid.

341
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,810
Who else did you fucking tell?!

342
00:21:45,568 --> 00:21:47,028
Don't yell at me.

343
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,530
Listen to me.

344
00:21:50,573 --> 00:21:51,573
Sit down.

345
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:06,341
Look, I love you.
You know I do.

346
00:22:06,381 --> 00:22:08,881
I've loved you since
the first time that we met.

347
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:12,045
Oh, really?
I heard you at the race.

348
00:22:12,095 --> 00:22:15,005
No girlfriend.
Open to offers.

349
00:22:15,056 --> 00:22:16,926
Come on, I have to say
those things.

350
00:22:16,975 --> 00:22:20,225
You know this.
They make me.

351
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,770
It's my brand.

352
00:22:25,817 --> 00:22:27,147
Come here.

353
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:30,655
Come here.

354
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,749
You remember when you relapsed?

355
00:22:37,787 --> 00:22:39,157
Yes.

356
00:22:39,205 --> 00:22:41,535
And I stayed and I rubbed
your back.

357
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,883
Cleaned up your puke.

358
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:48,841
I'm there for you, always.

359
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:55,514
I know, baby.

360
00:22:56,973 --> 00:23:00,233
Please,

361
00:23:00,268 --> 00:23:03,018
tell me who you told.

362
00:23:03,062 --> 00:23:05,692
'Cause we're in trouble.
We're in a lot of trouble.

363
00:23:12,572 --> 00:23:16,282
I didn't tell anyone.

364
00:23:31,716 --> 00:23:33,676
Either way, you're gonna
have to pack a bag,

365
00:23:33,718 --> 00:23:36,218
so get everything that you need.

366
00:23:36,262 --> 00:23:38,352
Why? Where are we going?

367
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:40,389
I'm gonna take care of this,

368
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:42,393
but until I do,
I got to get you somewhere safe,

369
00:23:42,435 --> 00:23:44,435
before Homelander finds out.

370
00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:48,727
I love you.

371
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,700
I love you, too.

372
00:24:22,225 --> 00:24:25,515
Mani? Pedi? Special deal.

373
00:24:31,651 --> 00:24:34,321
The hilarious
Dolphins Ahoy Extravaganza,

374
00:24:34,362 --> 00:24:36,952
starring these two knuckleheads.

375
00:24:36,989 --> 00:24:41,039
So this fall, remember, go Deep.
Go Oceanland.

376
00:24:41,077 --> 00:24:43,617
All right, let's see
what you got.

377
00:24:57,427 --> 00:25:00,347
You said you, uh,
you bowled before?

378
00:25:00,388 --> 00:25:02,968
Yeah, I'm just a little rusty.

379
00:25:03,015 --> 00:25:06,305
- You?
- Uh, yeah. Here, actually.

380
00:25:06,352 --> 00:25:07,982
My whole life.

381
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,650
I had my first kiss
with Amy Seeler

382
00:25:09,689 --> 00:25:11,359
in the men's bathroom
when I was 14.

383
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:14,359
- It was really romantic.
- Yeah.

384
00:25:14,402 --> 00:25:17,412
I'm sure that's exactly how
she pictured her first kiss.

385
00:25:17,447 --> 00:25:19,317
Excuse me.
Where was your first kiss?

386
00:25:19,365 --> 00:25:20,315
Prom.

387
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:23,076
It was amazing.

388
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:26,249
Wait, senior prom?

389
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:28,249
So your first kiss
was when you were 18?

390
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:30,081
Mm-hmm.

391
00:25:30,126 --> 00:25:31,706
Which you're not joking about,

392
00:25:31,753 --> 00:25:33,713
and that's fine, that's great.

393
00:25:33,755 --> 00:25:36,755
Yeah, I had a very
Jesus-centric childhood.

394
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:43,765
Yeah!

395
00:25:46,976 --> 00:25:48,596
He never asked me out again.

396
00:25:48,644 --> 00:25:51,404
Sorry. Um, what were you saying?

397
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:54,319
No, just about prom.

398
00:25:54,358 --> 00:25:56,738
- What was it... what about...
- Nothing.

399
00:25:56,778 --> 00:25:58,068
It's-it's stupid.

400
00:25:58,112 --> 00:26:02,702
Um, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna throw one.

401
00:26:03,826 --> 00:26:08,076
Ah! Ah.

402
00:26:08,122 --> 00:26:10,462
So what's, uh,
what's Translucent like?

403
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,880
That's a conversational
left turn.

404
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,630
Yes, it was.
I'm sorry about that.

405
00:26:15,671 --> 00:26:17,301
Sorry. Yeah, it just
popped into my head.

406
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,050
As a kid, he was my favorite.

407
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:21,801
You said the other ones
were dicks; is he a dick, too?

408
00:26:21,844 --> 00:26:26,724
Well, I mean, he's not great
with privacy or boundaries,

409
00:26:26,766 --> 00:26:28,766
I will say that.

410
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,560
But otherwise,
he seems like a loner.

411
00:26:31,604 --> 00:26:34,024
He spends most of his free time
with his son.

412
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:40,487
- He's got a son?
- Yeah. Early divorce, I think.

413
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,410
He's about ten.

414
00:26:42,448 --> 00:26:45,368
Hunter or Maverick
or something like that.

415
00:27:13,688 --> 00:27:14,978
It's okay.

416
00:27:52,268 --> 00:27:53,638
All right, everyone,
it's all over.

417
00:27:53,686 --> 00:27:58,016
It's all safe.
You're all gonna be fine.

418
00:27:59,692 --> 00:28:01,492
Thank you, Homelander!

419
00:28:01,527 --> 00:28:05,157
Oh, no, no.

420
00:28:05,197 --> 00:28:07,697
Come on, now. You guys.

421
00:28:07,742 --> 00:28:09,702
You guys made it.

422
00:28:09,744 --> 00:28:11,584
- You okay, sweetheart?
- Yeah.

423
00:28:11,621 --> 00:28:12,791
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

424
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,790
Good for you.

425
00:28:13,831 --> 00:28:16,131
You guys are amazing, fantastic.

426
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:17,167
Go, Maeve!

427
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:18,749
Hey, let's get
a round of applause

428
00:28:18,794 --> 00:28:20,134
for Queen Maeve.

429
00:28:20,171 --> 00:28:21,381
Yeah!

430
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:29,640
Captain?

431
00:28:31,057 --> 00:28:32,637
Stop. Stop.

432
00:28:32,683 --> 00:28:34,536
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, easy, fella.

433
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,100
Take it easy.

434
00:28:37,146 --> 00:28:39,226
There you go, just relax.

435
00:28:51,035 --> 00:28:53,285
ATC!

436
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:54,999
It's dead!

437
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,629
Can you fly a plane?

438
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,667
Wouldn't matter if I did!

439
00:29:03,255 --> 00:29:05,125
What do we do?

440
00:29:17,228 --> 00:29:18,898
All right, everyone,
remain calm.

441
00:29:18,938 --> 00:29:22,358
Stay in your seats.
Everything's under control.

442
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,240
You got to go out there,
lift the plane up.

443
00:29:25,277 --> 00:29:28,407
Lift the plane? How?
There's nothing to stand on.

444
00:29:28,447 --> 00:29:29,617
It's fucking air.

445
00:29:29,657 --> 00:29:31,407
I don't know, fly at it,
ram it straight.

446
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:35,540
No, that kind of speed, either
the plane goes ass over tit

447
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:37,539
or I'll punch straight
through the hull, or...

448
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:44,417
Whoa! Whoa, that was a big one!

449
00:29:44,463 --> 00:29:47,133
Everything's fine,
don't worry about it.

450
00:29:49,593 --> 00:29:53,063
Okay. Okay.

451
00:29:53,097 --> 00:29:55,727
You take everybody, one by one,
you fly them to the ground.

452
00:29:55,766 --> 00:29:59,556
And what?
Come back 123 times?

453
00:29:59,603 --> 00:30:01,613
Maeve, think.

454
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:06,855
We're done here.

455
00:30:06,902 --> 00:30:09,952
- Please.
- Everything's fine, guys.

456
00:30:09,989 --> 00:30:13,329
- Everything's fine. You're okay.
- Wait, you're leaving us?

457
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:15,747
No, no, no, no, no. I'm just
seeing something down the back.

458
00:30:17,496 --> 00:30:18,956
Oh, my God, you're leaving.

459
00:30:18,998 --> 00:30:20,708
- He's leaving us.
- I said I'm not...

460
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,420
Whoa!

461
00:30:23,461 --> 00:30:25,461
Homelander,
are you going to save us?

462
00:30:25,504 --> 00:30:28,424
Oh, sweetheart, of course
I'm gonna save you,

463
00:30:28,466 --> 00:30:30,086
you betcha.

464
00:30:30,134 --> 00:30:32,184
I'm gonna save everyone here,
don't worry about it.

465
00:30:32,219 --> 00:30:35,969
- Ma'am, relax, hands off me.
- It's okay. It's okay.

466
00:30:39,602 --> 00:30:41,522
Maeve!

467
00:31:01,707 --> 00:31:05,877
Okay, you two,
take off your masks. Come on.

468
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,670
Now!

469
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:13,839
- Take these two!
- No, no.

470
00:31:13,886 --> 00:31:15,447
- Just these two! Please!
- No! What, so they

471
00:31:15,471 --> 00:31:16,931
can tell the world that we left

472
00:31:16,972 --> 00:31:18,392
the rest of them to fucking die?

473
00:31:18,432 --> 00:31:21,522
- Come on!
- No, Maeve. No. You stay back!

474
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,850
All of you, stay back.

475
00:31:23,896 --> 00:31:26,766
You stay the fuck back
or I'll laser you, goddamn it!

476
00:31:26,816 --> 00:31:29,026
I will laser every
fucking one of you!

477
00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:31,398
Stay back!

478
00:31:31,445 --> 00:31:33,405
Let's go.

479
00:31:33,447 --> 00:31:36,487
No, Maeve, no!

480
00:31:36,534 --> 00:31:38,414
- Please stay!
- I'm sorry.

481
00:31:38,452 --> 00:31:39,582
- Take us!
- Maeve!

482
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,160
Please, don't leave us. Please!

483
00:31:42,206 --> 00:31:43,996
Maeve!

484
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:47,041
Don't die with them.

485
00:31:47,086 --> 00:31:48,876
Maeve.

486
00:31:48,921 --> 00:31:51,131
- What is wrong with you?
- Please, Maeve!

487
00:31:51,173 --> 00:31:54,393
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

488
00:31:54,426 --> 00:31:56,176
Please take her.

489
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,560
Take my daughter!

490
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,350
- Please! Please take her!
- Please.

491
00:32:03,394 --> 00:32:05,194
Take her!

492
00:32:33,883 --> 00:32:35,843
Oh, look at this.

493
00:32:35,885 --> 00:32:39,005
- Homicide.
- You got here fast.

494
00:32:39,054 --> 00:32:42,024
- Yeah, it was on the squawker.
- What's with the accent?

495
00:32:42,057 --> 00:32:43,477
What's with yours?

496
00:32:43,517 --> 00:32:46,647
You ever seen her here before?

497
00:32:46,687 --> 00:32:49,517
Maybe a year ago.

498
00:32:54,153 --> 00:32:55,573
It's a gang hit.

499
00:32:57,323 --> 00:32:59,283
A gang hit?

500
00:32:59,325 --> 00:33:03,075
- And who told you that, eh?
- I'm not arguing with him.

501
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,250
I'm looking into it.

502
00:33:06,582 --> 00:33:08,172
Excuse me.

503
00:33:10,544 --> 00:33:13,174
Cheers, mate.

504
00:33:30,564 --> 00:33:33,944
A-Train saw me
a fucking week ago.

505
00:33:33,984 --> 00:33:37,454
- What if he made me?
- He didn't see you.

506
00:33:37,488 --> 00:33:40,028
Listen, that's easy for you to
say, Butcher, but I got people.

507
00:33:40,074 --> 00:33:42,204
Oh? And I don't?

508
00:33:43,869 --> 00:33:48,709
Look, Vought don't send a Supe
to do a gang hit, all right?

509
00:33:48,749 --> 00:33:50,289
He was after the female.

510
00:33:50,334 --> 00:33:52,924
Hey, man, who was the woman?

511
00:33:52,962 --> 00:33:54,672
Roberta Cho, mother of four,

512
00:33:54,713 --> 00:33:58,223
loved Mexican food, and smuggled
in a ton of immigrants

513
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:01,349
- from all over the Pacific.
- Eh, like our girl.

514
00:34:01,387 --> 00:34:02,757
A-Train, can I get a selfie?

515
00:34:04,223 --> 00:34:06,353
I got it.

516
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:10,812
That wanker can cover
all of Manhattan in 30 minutes.

517
00:34:10,854 --> 00:34:12,824
He's gonna find her
before we do.

518
00:34:12,856 --> 00:34:14,936
No, he won't.
I know where she's going.

519
00:34:16,235 --> 00:34:18,485
Penn Station.

520
00:34:18,529 --> 00:34:21,699
She's working her way backwards.
She's trying to get home.

521
00:34:25,786 --> 00:34:30,036
I'm Ezekiel, and I want you
to join me at the BELIEVE EXPO,

522
00:34:30,082 --> 00:34:32,252
June 6 to 10
at the Fairgrounds.

523
00:34:32,293 --> 00:34:34,213
Sponsored
by Samaritan's Embrace.

524
00:34:34,253 --> 00:34:35,843
We're gonna have music,

525
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:38,549
we're gonna have worship,
food trucks and,

526
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:42,140
oh, yeah, Christ.

527
00:34:42,177 --> 00:34:45,847
Featuring Homelander
and Starlight from The Seven.

528
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:47,809
- Hey.
- I know.

529
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:50,270
Look, I'm not down to convert
the masses or anything,

530
00:34:50,311 --> 00:34:53,191
I'm just...
I'm doing a panel for teens.

531
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,770
And, uh, I'm donating
my appearance fee

532
00:34:55,816 --> 00:34:57,396
to the Covenant House.

533
00:34:57,443 --> 00:35:00,033
You are literally
the nicest person in the city.

534
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,740
No, seriously.

535
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:05,281
Every other nice person
can fuck off and go home.

536
00:35:05,326 --> 00:35:07,656
I mean, that's why I do it.

537
00:35:07,703 --> 00:35:11,673
Vindictive personal glory.

538
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:17,343
You okay?

539
00:35:17,379 --> 00:35:20,669
Yeah, yes. Yeah.

540
00:35:22,718 --> 00:35:25,888
You seem a little...

541
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:27,769
I don't know.

542
00:35:46,158 --> 00:35:48,158
Hmm.

543
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:51,959
Okay.

544
00:35:54,124 --> 00:35:56,094
I'll come clean.

545
00:35:56,126 --> 00:35:59,506
If I'm being honest...

546
00:35:59,546 --> 00:36:01,086
I'm a little suspicious of you.

547
00:36:01,131 --> 00:36:03,381
You are?

548
00:36:03,425 --> 00:36:06,755
Yeah. I mean,
you say you bowled a lot.

549
00:36:06,804 --> 00:36:10,274
And you know, you have,
like, superpowers,

550
00:36:10,307 --> 00:36:12,977
yet you are
a remarkably shitty bowler.

551
00:36:15,145 --> 00:36:17,105
You know what
I think is happening?

552
00:36:17,147 --> 00:36:19,857
I think you're holding back
for some weird,

553
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:24,530
"not gonna show me up
on a first date" reason.

554
00:36:24,571 --> 00:36:27,781
You want to quit stroking my ego
and show me what you really got?

555
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:38,753
Holy shit.

556
00:36:40,629 --> 00:36:43,009
Now that's a strike.

557
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,720
Yeah.

558
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,970
Yeah, that's great, man.

559
00:36:51,014 --> 00:36:52,814
Good looking out. Thanks.

560
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,810
Well? Don't leave us hanging.

561
00:36:54,852 --> 00:36:57,232
Okay, so Deshawn's a brother
that grew up on my block,

562
00:36:57,271 --> 00:36:58,651
but now he delivers packages.

563
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:00,189
Yeah, not the part
I'm interested in.

564
00:37:00,232 --> 00:37:02,072
He ran down the account number

565
00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:05,029
and the box containing the V
came from Samaritan's Embrace.

566
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,740
Ezekiel's Supe charity?

567
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,320
What the fuck's
that Jesus-thumping,

568
00:37:09,366 --> 00:37:11,576
elastic bastard
got to do with it?

569
00:37:11,618 --> 00:37:14,618
Maybe we find the girl,
we find out.

570
00:37:14,663 --> 00:37:16,623
Yeah. All right.

571
00:37:16,665 --> 00:37:19,585
Platforms, ground floor,
I'll take upstairs.

572
00:37:19,626 --> 00:37:21,521
Whoever pings her, get onto
Frenchie and stick with her

573
00:37:21,545 --> 00:37:22,785
till we use the gas, all right?

574
00:37:35,309 --> 00:37:37,269
If you're just tuning in,

575
00:37:37,311 --> 00:37:39,981
authorities have lost
all radar and satellite imagery

576
00:37:40,022 --> 00:37:43,982
of hijacked Flight 37
and fear the worst.

577
00:37:44,026 --> 00:37:45,936
Search planes have begun
to fan out

578
00:37:45,986 --> 00:37:47,776
over the flight path
off the Atlantic...

579
00:38:51,885 --> 00:38:53,345
Non, non.

580
00:38:56,974 --> 00:39:00,694
It's okay. It's gone.

581
00:39:00,727 --> 00:39:04,267
It's gone, you see?

582
00:39:04,314 --> 00:39:07,234
I'm not here to hurt you.

583
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,080
You like music, huh?

584
00:39:16,326 --> 00:39:18,826
Well, me, too.

585
00:39:20,414 --> 00:39:24,884
C-Can I tell you a secret
I never told anyone?

586
00:39:29,506 --> 00:39:32,796
When I was a boy,

587
00:39:32,843 --> 00:39:35,103
my father, he stole me
from Mamma.

588
00:39:35,137 --> 00:39:39,727
In Marseilles, middle of the
night, just broke in, took me.

589
00:39:39,766 --> 00:39:41,726
Kept me with him for years.

590
00:39:41,768 --> 00:39:43,768
Hotel after hotel.

591
00:39:43,812 --> 00:39:48,152
Every few nights,
take me out for a walk.

592
00:39:48,191 --> 00:39:52,701
Smoke a Gauloise,
tell me he loved me, then...

593
00:39:58,744 --> 00:40:02,214
I tried to run away
so many times.

594
00:40:06,543 --> 00:40:09,633
I jumped buses, trains.

595
00:40:09,671 --> 00:40:13,091
Anything to get back
to Marseilles.

596
00:40:13,133 --> 00:40:16,603
To Mamma.

597
00:40:16,637 --> 00:40:20,467
But every time, he find me.

598
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:26,940
So I know what it's like
to want to go home.

599
00:40:33,612 --> 00:40:36,622
You see, I know your secret.

600
00:40:38,825 --> 00:40:41,655
You're not a bad person.

601
00:40:42,704 --> 00:40:46,254
Just a scared one.

602
00:40:52,673 --> 00:40:54,883
Let me help you.

603
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:06,959
...reports of suspicious activity...

604
00:41:13,026 --> 00:41:14,186
Coming through.

605
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:22,116
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no...

606
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,910
Frenchie. Did you see her?
Which way did she go?

607
00:41:24,955 --> 00:41:26,349
- I don't know.
- Did you try to gas her?

608
00:41:26,373 --> 00:41:27,673
- No.
- Why not?

609
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:29,477
- It didn't seem right, huh?
- You went off plan

610
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:32,421
- because it didn't seem right?
- I'm sorry, okay?

611
00:41:35,298 --> 00:41:39,338
Ah, Sean Jakowski.
Cross-country team.

612
00:41:39,386 --> 00:41:42,676
- Mm.
- I had such a huge crush on him,

613
00:41:42,723 --> 00:41:45,063
and he finally asked me out
to this party.

614
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,230
My hair looked cute,
we held hands, it was perfect.

615
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,900
Then, all of a sudden,
this senior shoved Sean,

616
00:41:50,939 --> 00:41:52,319
and then he hit him.

617
00:41:52,357 --> 00:41:55,357
So I stepped in,
I kicked the guy's ass.

618
00:41:55,402 --> 00:41:57,202
- Good for you.
- Mm.

619
00:41:57,237 --> 00:41:58,907
Want to know
how Sean thanked me?

620
00:41:58,947 --> 00:42:00,987
- How?
- Never spoke to me again.

621
00:42:01,032 --> 00:42:02,992
Not one word.

622
00:42:03,034 --> 00:42:05,584
And that's when I learned,

623
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,670
never show your strength
to a boy you like.

624
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:11,876
Well, to be honest,

625
00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:14,628
Sean Jakowski had
a tiny little baby dick.

626
00:42:19,634 --> 00:42:22,804
It doesn't bother you that I
could whip your ass in bowling?

627
00:42:22,846 --> 00:42:26,216
And in everything?

628
00:42:26,266 --> 00:42:27,766
And bench-press you?

629
00:42:27,809 --> 00:42:29,939
Oh, my God, is that
a threat or a promise?

630
00:42:29,978 --> 00:42:33,818
- Hmm.
- And no. No. I-I...

631
00:42:33,857 --> 00:42:38,857
I really think it's awesome,
the real you.

632
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,910
Um, you got... ketchup.

633
00:42:45,952 --> 00:42:48,162
Mm? Oh.

634
00:42:48,205 --> 00:42:50,575
What? You don't like that?

635
00:42:50,624 --> 00:42:52,584
Doesn't work for you?

636
00:43:02,761 --> 00:43:05,721
Save my spot.
I'll be right back.

637
00:43:38,713 --> 00:43:42,093
- Hey.
- Hey.

638
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:47,639
So where's the girl, Frenchie?

639
00:43:47,681 --> 00:43:49,891
Since you're the psycho chick
whisperer all of a sudden.

640
00:43:49,933 --> 00:43:52,893
Maybe subway. Maybe she wants
to find a train, no?

641
00:43:52,936 --> 00:43:54,622
Oh, yeah? How deep up your ass
did you pull that out?

642
00:43:54,646 --> 00:43:56,165
Well, it depends.
How deep does your tongue go?

643
00:43:56,189 --> 00:43:57,789
Listen, you lost her, man.

644
00:43:57,816 --> 00:43:59,460
We had orders,
we're supposed to follow them.

645
00:43:59,484 --> 00:44:01,444
We're professionals
and we count on each other.

646
00:44:01,486 --> 00:44:04,986
But you're on some fucking
bohemian flaky drug shit.

647
00:44:05,031 --> 00:44:06,991
Even Hughie,
who's a fucking white Urkel,

648
00:44:07,033 --> 00:44:08,803
- is more professional than you.
- I understand it's hard

649
00:44:08,827 --> 00:44:10,787
for someone who's anally OCD
to understand.

650
00:44:10,829 --> 00:44:12,579
Okay, then help me
understand, Frenchie.

651
00:44:12,622 --> 00:44:14,100
What happened the night
that Mallory had you

652
00:44:14,124 --> 00:44:15,643
- tail Lamplighter?
- Oh, that's enough.

653
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:18,957
Mallory was our boss, man.
We had orders.

654
00:44:19,004 --> 00:44:20,594
And you were supposed
to follow him.

655
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,149
You were supposed
to follow Lamplighter,

656
00:44:22,173 --> 00:44:24,973
- tail him, but you let him go.
- I didn't know.

657
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:27,470
And Lamplighter goes
and torches Mallory's grandkids.

658
00:44:27,512 --> 00:44:29,512
- I didn't know.
- It doesn't matter.

659
00:44:29,556 --> 00:44:33,056
You didn't follow orders
and it costs some lives.

660
00:44:34,936 --> 00:44:36,976
Hey, hey. Knock it off.

661
00:44:37,022 --> 00:44:39,402
- Knock it off.
- You know what?

662
00:44:39,441 --> 00:44:41,321
Fuck this, Butcher.

663
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,859
And fuck you. I'm done!

664
00:44:43,904 --> 00:44:47,324
- Stupid fucker...
- M.M., wait.

665
00:44:47,365 --> 00:44:50,285
You said this time
would be different.

666
00:44:50,327 --> 00:44:53,747
But this motherfucker's still
here doing the same old shit.

667
00:44:53,788 --> 00:44:57,208
And we're all gonna
fucking end up like Mallory.

668
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:59,590
- Yeah, fuck off. Come on.
- Fuck this.

669
00:44:59,628 --> 00:45:01,208
Oi, both of you.

670
00:45:01,254 --> 00:45:03,474
- M.M.
- What?

671
00:45:03,506 --> 00:45:06,716
What's Sporty Spice up to?

672
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,680
Who?

673
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,010
Sporty fucking Spice.
What is she up to?

674
00:45:14,309 --> 00:45:15,889
I don't know.

675
00:45:15,936 --> 00:45:18,516
Exactly. How about Posh?

676
00:45:18,563 --> 00:45:20,693
- You know what she's doing?
- I don't understand.

677
00:45:20,732 --> 00:45:23,232
Making clothes
for anorexics. Right?

678
00:45:23,276 --> 00:45:25,026
Not exactly a growth market.

679
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:28,240
And Baby?
You know what she's doing?

680
00:45:28,281 --> 00:45:31,951
Fuck all. Not even page six
of the Daily Mail.

681
00:45:31,993 --> 00:45:34,373
And Scary Spice?

682
00:45:34,412 --> 00:45:37,462
Up to her eyeballs
in lawsuits and sex tapes.

683
00:45:37,499 --> 00:45:40,539
Ginger, on the other hand,
has released three albums.

684
00:45:40,585 --> 00:45:44,965
Passion, Schizophonic and
Scream If You Wanna Go Faster.

685
00:45:45,006 --> 00:45:48,546
They'll all make
your ears bleed.

686
00:45:48,593 --> 00:45:51,053
You see, when they're apart,

687
00:45:51,096 --> 00:45:53,056
they're absolute
fucking rubbish.

688
00:45:53,098 --> 00:45:58,188
But, you put them together,

689
00:45:58,228 --> 00:46:02,228
they're the goddamn
fucking Spice Girls.

690
00:46:06,861 --> 00:46:09,241
How do you know so much
about the Spice Girls?

691
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,790
Look, the point is,

692
00:46:13,827 --> 00:46:17,907
that we're all shite
by ourselves.

693
00:46:17,956 --> 00:46:19,786
We need each other.

694
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:23,383
We need each other, or we're
fucking dead in the water.

695
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:26,050
Now, you guys can beat
the living fucking shit

696
00:46:26,089 --> 00:46:28,049
out of each other,
I really don't care,

697
00:46:28,091 --> 00:46:30,551
it ain't gonna change the past.

698
00:46:36,016 --> 00:46:40,306
What do you say we go find
that dirty little bitch,

699
00:46:40,353 --> 00:46:43,903
gas her ass,
then get the fuck out of here?

700
00:46:48,445 --> 00:46:50,905
Jesus, he gives
the worst pep talks.

701
00:46:50,947 --> 00:46:52,617
He really, really does.

702
00:47:00,498 --> 00:47:02,288
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

703
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:04,133
That's right.

704
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:05,709
Next stop, the Atlantic Ocean.

705
00:47:05,754 --> 00:47:08,344
That's right. That's right.

706
00:47:10,925 --> 00:47:12,505
What?

707
00:47:12,552 --> 00:47:16,512
Okay. Okay, yeah.

708
00:47:16,556 --> 00:47:19,806
I mean, let's just focus on the
escape first and, uh, you know,

709
00:47:19,851 --> 00:47:21,981
we can talk about that
some other time.

710
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,110
Well, uh, I like you, too.

711
00:47:26,149 --> 00:47:27,779
You know that.

712
00:47:27,817 --> 00:47:30,107
But let's not, you know,
rush into anything too fast.

713
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:36,450
All right, seriously,
now is not the appropriate time.

714
00:47:36,493 --> 00:47:39,203
Plus, you're making things awkward.

715
00:47:39,245 --> 00:47:42,205
Okay, okay!

716
00:47:42,248 --> 00:47:44,208
If I just touch it,
will you shut up?

717
00:47:47,378 --> 00:47:50,298
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.

718
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,050
I made you a promise.

719
00:48:36,469 --> 00:48:37,759
Hey.

720
00:49:20,096 --> 00:49:21,596
Shit...

721
00:49:29,898 --> 00:49:31,818
- Let's go.
- No, Frenchie.

722
00:49:31,858 --> 00:49:33,478
Forget it, mate. She's fucked.

723
00:49:36,613 --> 00:49:38,203
A-Train!

724
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:40,529
Over here! Look, everybody!

725
00:49:40,575 --> 00:49:41,969
- It's A-Train right over here!
- A-Train's here?

726
00:49:41,993 --> 00:49:43,493
- No way.
- Look, it's A-Train!

727
00:49:45,496 --> 00:49:47,576
Hey.

728
00:49:47,624 --> 00:49:49,504
Cool, look who's here.

729
00:49:49,542 --> 00:49:52,092
Shit, what's up, A-Train?

730
00:49:53,379 --> 00:49:54,339
A-Train, hey.

731
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:55,800
Hey, can we take a selfie?

732
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,720
Oh, sure, absolutely.

733
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,509
I can take one or two.

734
00:49:59,552 --> 00:50:01,512
A-Train, over here.

735
00:50:26,621 --> 00:50:29,581
No. Let me talk to her.

736
00:50:29,624 --> 00:50:31,424
Don't be fucking stupid.

737
00:50:33,253 --> 00:50:36,843
What if she's a Spice Girl?

738
00:50:36,881 --> 00:50:39,341
Frenchie.

739
00:50:59,904 --> 00:51:02,324
Let me help you go home.

740
00:51:37,483 --> 00:51:41,363
She ain't no Spice Girl.

741
00:52:25,406 --> 00:52:26,816
Once again,
the horrific wreckage

742
00:52:26,866 --> 00:52:28,946
of Trans-Oceanic Flight 37

743
00:52:28,993 --> 00:52:31,003
just beginning to wash up
on shore.

744
00:52:31,037 --> 00:52:34,167
Every passenger on board
presumed dead.

745
00:52:36,417 --> 00:52:38,417
They didn't have to die.

746
00:52:40,046 --> 00:52:42,626
We have Homelander
and Queen Maeve on the scene.

747
00:52:42,673 --> 00:52:45,643
Do you have a comment?

748
00:52:45,676 --> 00:52:48,346
I said they didn't have to die.

749
00:52:48,388 --> 00:52:52,018
We arrived three minutes
after the plane went down.

750
00:52:52,058 --> 00:52:54,728
And why?

751
00:52:54,769 --> 00:52:57,309
Because we're not
in the chain of command.

752
00:52:57,355 --> 00:53:01,435
If NORAD called us
before they scrambled jets,

753
00:53:01,484 --> 00:53:03,284
then we could've saved them.

754
00:53:03,319 --> 00:53:07,279
123 men, women and children.

755
00:53:07,323 --> 00:53:09,333
Excuse me.

756
00:53:13,788 --> 00:53:18,288
But if they let us
into the military,

757
00:53:18,334 --> 00:53:21,304
then this will
never happen again.

758
00:53:21,337 --> 00:53:24,877
That is my solemn promise
to you.

759
00:53:24,924 --> 00:53:26,934
Right, Maeve?

760
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:31,430
Talk to your congressmen.

761
00:53:31,472 --> 00:53:33,222
Talk to them.
They'll listen to the people.

762
00:53:33,266 --> 00:53:35,726
And together,

763
00:53:35,768 --> 00:53:38,938
together, we will make sure
that this never happens

764
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:41,980
to our great nation ever again!

765
00:53:44,986 --> 00:53:47,356
God bless you.

766
00:53:47,405 --> 00:53:49,565
God bless America.

767
00:53:49,615 --> 00:53:51,427
We hear you, Homelander!

768
00:53:51,451 --> 00:53:54,621
And I hear you, brother!
I hear you!

769
00:53:54,662 --> 00:53:57,622
And the world hears you!

770
00:53:57,665 --> 00:54:01,535
And very, very soon, my friend,

771
00:54:01,586 --> 00:54:05,086
whoever did this to us
will hear from all of us!

772
00:54:05,131 --> 00:54:07,431
Homelander!

773
00:54:07,467 --> 00:54:10,597
Homelander! Homelander!

774
00:54:10,636 --> 00:54:15,016
Homelander! Homelander!
Homelander!

775
00:54:15,057 --> 00:54:18,477
Homelander! Homelander!

776
00:54:18,519 --> 00:54:23,149
Homelander! Homelander!
Homelander!

777
00:54:23,191 --> 00:54:26,071
Homelander! Homelander!

778
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:28,070
Homelander!
