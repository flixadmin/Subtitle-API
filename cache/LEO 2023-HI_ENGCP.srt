- Please don't leave us, Mrs. Salinas!
- Oh.

Agh! Down! Now! Down!

- [spray hissing]
- No hug! Sit!

305
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:32,667
In class, we sit up straight,
pay attention, and we are what? You!

306
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,750
What? Oh, my God. Um, we're quiet?

307
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,875
That's very good listening, Logan.
That's a heart for you.

00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,625
When you listen, you get knowledge,

Ew. What was that?

315
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:06,625
Peanut butter and ham. My dad overslept.

Okay, well, we're out of time,
so let's wish Mrs. Salinas well. Bye-bye.

318
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,167
- But, I... The class is...
- No, no. I know. Out we go.

319
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,750

one student has to take home a class pet.

00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,500
- What's this now?
- Uh, we don't do that here.

00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,792
Not anymore. No way.

In <i>my </i>classroom,
you will learn responsibility.

You will feed it properly

Do we have a volunteer?

00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:49,208
- Come on. Somebody raise your hand.
- What?

329
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:53,583
Remember what happens at the kids' houses?
They forget to feed you or abuse you.

Don't you get it? This is my shot.

339
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,208
So I go with one of these kids,
case the house for open windows,

340
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:20,583
then when I'm alone, zip! I escape.

00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:25,125

- I'm zipping. And then I really live.

Maybe climb a tree. Swim in a sewer.
See the Everglades.

The Everglades?
With those untamed animals? Are you nuts?

344
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:35,167
You know they don't even have names,
right? It's anarchy.

You think a rock potato like you
can survive there?

- [Ms. Malkin] Let's go.

347
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,375
Who's gonna take on some responsibility?

348
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:46,042
- Or do I have to pick?
- Well, if no one else will…

349
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,667
I don't want them to feel not wanted.
Everybody wants to fit in

350
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,625
and shouldn't be judged
on looks, species, foreheads.

00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,750
I have to go indoor skydiving tomorrow,

00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,167
but my father'll be home,
so if it's okay to...

remember to change your colors
and blend in!

except you can't get hurt.

Okay, we have a busy weekend.

Do I have to wear a dress to Grandma's?
It'll be pants weather on Sunday.

Jayda said the word "puke".
She said it wasn’t a curse word. Is it?

I feel bad leaving him.
Nobody wants him near the dinner table.

He's good with his water. Back soon!

People say you're nice to be nice,

you'll think they're cool...

I get it.

432
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,208
You say "I get it" a lot.

That's 'cause I understand things.
That's all. "I get it." I've been around.

- Oh. Wow.

No, more like, "Wow,
I didn't think you were that self-aware."

438

[exhales] I can tell. People are too nice
to say I talk too much,

that I'm talking too much.

Like, old people make this face.
And babies kind of look sleepy.

And the bus driver's face is like,
"Stop." But I can't stop and I…

I'm a talking turtle. I picked you 'cause…

"I like your style."

- I got this. Now, tell me your problems.

- What?
- I… I can fix your problems. I… I… I…

Ah-ha. Bully. I get it.

Come on. You're insecure, right?
Every class bully is.

No. I don't know.

1081

You're sad, you got something
tearing you up inside.

1082

Just say it. I'm a talking turtle.
I can't tell anyone else.

1083
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:30,708
Of course I'm a bully.
I don't know what else to do.

1084

- I'm just different. I'm not smart.
- Nah. Everyone's smart in some way.

1085
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:39,625
You're just afraid of trying
and <i>looking </i>not smart. That's textbook.

- What's a textbook?
- You know what? Never mind.

Perfect. That's very class bully.

on the mommy's back while she's swimming.

He reaches under the mommy
to find her cloaca.

1097
00:55:15,208 --> 00:55:17,250
This goes on for about 24 hours.

1098
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:21,708
Then the mommy comes ashore, makes a nest,
and deposits eggs in the sand.

1099
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:25,625
My mom made eggs in the sand?

1100
00:55:25,708 --> 00:55:28,042
Yes. So the fish don't eat 'em.

I crushed it.
Totally fixed the kid's problem.

So from here on, you'll be taking home…
[sighs] What's the turtle's name again?

1117
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,542
Squirtle. My name is Squirtle.

1118
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:31,458
I think it's Squirtle.

1119

Squirtle sucks.

1120

I beg your pardon? Why?

1121
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:36,708
I don't know. He just sucks.

1122

- The best.

What is so special about this reptile?

I like his skin.

His skin is like my grandma's elbows.

1127

Uh, same.
