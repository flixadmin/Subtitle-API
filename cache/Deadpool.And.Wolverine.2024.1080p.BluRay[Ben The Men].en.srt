1
00:00:35,473 --> 00:00:39,522
<i>That logo music just gets you pumped.
Right?</i>

2
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:42,402
<i>I'm sorry. I just, I'm excited
to be here. It's been a while.</i>

3
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:45,407
<i>You know, for a long time,
I wasn't sure I'd ever be back.</i>

4
00:00:45,574 --> 00:00:46,533
<i>Disney bought Fox...</i>

5
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:49,455
<i>there was a whole boring rights issue,
blabbity-blabbity-blah.</i>

6
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:52,376
<i>But then, it turned out, they wanted me.</i>

7
00:00:52,543 --> 00:00:54,964
<i>The one guy
who shouldn't even have his own movie...</i>

8
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,717
<i>much less a franchise.</i>

9
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:59,387
<i>Marvel's so stupid.</i>

10
00:01:00,139 --> 00:01:02,142
<i>Look, we know the title of this thing. So...</i>

11
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:03,644
<i>I know what you're wondering.</i>

12
00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:07,651
<i>How are we gonna do this
without dishonoring Logan's memory?</i>

13
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:09,488
<i>And I'll tell you how.</i>

14
00:01:10,615 --> 00:01:11,449
<i>We're not.</i>

15
00:01:13,452 --> 00:01:15,456
<i>I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.</i>

16
00:01:15,623 --> 00:01:17,877
<i>Wolverine is not dead.</i>

17
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:21,007
<i>Sure, it made for a perfect ending
to a very sad story.</i>

18
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:24,345
<i>But that's not how
regenerative healing factors work.</i>

19
00:01:24,513 --> 00:01:27,893
<i>You think I wanna be out here
in beautiful downtown North Dakota...</i>

20
00:01:28,059 --> 00:01:30,898
<i>digging up the one and only Wolverine?
No, thank you.</i>

21
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:33,694
<i>But the fate of my entire world is at stake.</i>

22
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:38,577
<i>He may not be living his best life,
but he sure as hell ain't dead.</i>

23
00:01:44,086 --> 00:01:45,087
Bingo.

24
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:46,882
Yahtzee.

25
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,059
Yes, yes, yes.

26
00:01:56,648 --> 00:01:57,650
Damn it!

27
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:01,364
Son of a bitch!

28
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,244
You...

29
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:09,962
Christ. Motherfucker!

30
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:11,673
My world is fuck...

31
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:14,135
That was weird.

32
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:16,013
I'm much calmer now.

33
00:02:17,265 --> 00:02:20,104
Look, I'm not a man of science.

34
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,899
But you seem incredibly passed away.

35
00:02:26,697 --> 00:02:28,242
But it's good to see ya.

36
00:02:28,408 --> 00:02:31,330
I gotta be honest,
I've always wanted to ride with you, Log.

37
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:36,463
You and me getting into it.
Deadpool and Wolverine just fuckin' shit up.

38
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:39,802
Can you imagine the fun, the chaos...

39
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:40,929
the residuals?

40
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,182
"G'day, mate.

41
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,019
"There's nothing that'll
bring me back to life faster...

42
00:02:45,186 --> 00:02:47,649
"than a big bag of Marvel cash."

43
00:02:49,443 --> 00:02:50,486
Me too, Hugh.

44
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:53,449
But, no. No, no, no.

45
00:02:55,036 --> 00:02:59,793
You had to get all noble and die for real.
Goddamn it!

46
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,591
I could really use your help right now.

47
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:15,527
Wait!

48
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,324
I'm warning you, I'm not alone.

49
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,951
Wade Winston Wilson...

50
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:23,415
you are under arrest
by the Time Variance Authority...

51
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:25,418
for too many crimes to list.

52
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:26,420
Come out...

53
00:03:26,587 --> 00:03:27,923
and we'll extend you the courtesy...

54
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,176
- of taking you in one piece.
- Death by day-player.

55
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,261
Last chance.

56
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:34,475
Throw out your weapons
and come out peacefully.

57
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:36,937
I'm not gonna give you my weapons...

58
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:39,149
but I promise not to use them.

59
00:03:40,193 --> 00:03:42,822
There are two hundred and six bones
in the human body.

60
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,159
Two hundred and seven
if I'm watching <i>Gossip Girl.</i>

61
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:48,081
Here we go. Maximum effort.

62
00:03:55,426 --> 00:03:58,180
Okay, peanut.
Guess we're getting that team up after all.

63
00:05:08,295 --> 00:05:10,132
Maradona from outside the box!

64
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:12,677
{\an8}Goal!

65
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,632
Come on, big fella.

66
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,200
I am soaking wet right now.

67
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:48,501
<i>To be clear, I'm not proud of any of this.</i>

68
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:52,549
<i>The wanton violence,
the whiff of necrophilia. It isn't who I am.</i>

69
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:54,052
<i>It isn't who I wanna be.</i>

70
00:06:54,218 --> 00:06:55,470
<i>Who I wanna be?</i>

71
00:06:55,637 --> 00:06:57,223
<i>Well, to help you understand that...</i>

72
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,434
<i>I've gotta take you back.</i>

73
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,189
<i>A little joyride I took
through space and time...</i>

74
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:03,901
<i>to the day that changed everything.</i>

75
00:07:16,046 --> 00:07:17,674
{\an8}I can't believe I'm finally here.

76
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:20,386
{\an8}I've waited for this moment for so long.

77
00:07:21,722 --> 00:07:23,851
Thank you, sir, for seeing me.

78
00:07:24,935 --> 00:07:26,813
I firmly believe...

79
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:28,274
that my services could be of...

80
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:31,196
great use to your organization.
Now I know...

81
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,658
I was caught smashturbating
in the lobby of Stark Tower...

82
00:07:33,825 --> 00:07:35,035
- but I can assure you that...
- Smashturbating?

83
00:07:35,202 --> 00:07:36,454
I'm sorry, what, what was that?

84
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,835
No, I'm sorry.
That, that's when you get those toy...

85
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:42,672
Hulk hands, right? And then you just,
you look down, and you just...

86
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:46,596
you brace yourself,
and you ravage the midsection.

87
00:07:46,763 --> 00:07:48,266
- Pinch the... Yeah. Okay.
- I get it. Okay, thank you.

88
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:50,310
- The picture's painted.
- You get the gist.

89
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:52,648
What exactly brings you here today?

90
00:07:52,814 --> 00:07:55,527
Why am I... Wow. Okay.

91
00:07:55,694 --> 00:07:57,572
I care.

92
00:07:57,822 --> 00:08:00,285
I know I turn everything into a joke,
but I...

93
00:08:02,372 --> 00:08:05,001
I care, and I, I wanna use that feeling...

94
00:08:06,045 --> 00:08:07,923
for something important.

95
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:09,676
I, I wanna matter.

96
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:14,308
I need to show my girl that I matter.

97
00:08:15,685 --> 00:08:16,687
And...

98
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,400
you know,
I feel like I'm wasting the good stuff here.

99
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,486
- Is the man not gonna be joining us?
- The man?

100
00:08:21,653 --> 00:08:23,782
Yeah. I should save this if he's gonna...

101
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:26,203
As, as far as you're concerned right now,
I'm the man.

102
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:27,496
- No.
- The man is me.

103
00:08:27,913 --> 00:08:30,876
I am the man in this circumstance.

104
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,673
He doesn't do this kind of thing anymore.

105
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,675
- Cameos?
- Meetings.

106
00:08:34,842 --> 00:08:36,384
- Meetings.
- Entry-level meetings.

107
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:37,346
Entry-level?

108
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:39,349
Aren't you the chauffeur...

109
00:08:39,514 --> 00:08:41,518
- maybe?
- I... Common misconception.

110
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:44,773
- Okay.
- I did begin my career as Mr. Stark's driver.

111
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:45,943
- Okay.
- Quickly pivoted to...

112
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,487
- Chauffeur.
- ...the Head of Security.

113
00:08:47,654 --> 00:08:49,491
The Head of... Of course, yes, yes, yes.

114
00:08:49,657 --> 00:08:52,537
And why I am vetting your résumé.

115
00:08:52,704 --> 00:08:54,790
You seem to have left out
whether or not you had...

116
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,460
any experience as a member of a team.

117
00:08:56,627 --> 00:08:58,839
Could you maybe
add a little bit of perspective there?

118
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:01,176
No, yes, of course. I was Special Forces...

119
00:09:01,343 --> 00:09:03,847
- Okay.
- but I was... Mainly, I was team leader...

120
00:09:04,015 --> 00:09:05,099
founder, really, of X-Force.

121
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:07,186
Sadly, they,
they all perished in action though.

122
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:08,647
How exactly did that happen?

123
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:10,691
Well, the police say gravity, but if...

124
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:11,693
Just between us...

125
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,446
- they didn't test well in the focus group.
- I see.

126
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:15,366
- Particularly Cable.
- X-Force.

127
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:17,411
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Look,
I can see this isn't going well.

128
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:18,955
Please stop writing. Look, I, I...

129
00:09:19,122 --> 00:09:20,958
I'm just... I wanna be an Avenger.

130
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:24,464
I wanna be an Avenger.

131
00:09:26,384 --> 00:09:27,761
Why do you wanna be an Avenger?

132
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:31,267
Look around you. I mean, they're the,
they're the best of the best.

133
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:33,228
And, and what they do matters.

134
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:35,649
I need to be an Avenger.

135
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:39,531
Sir, my girl has kinda had it with my shtick,
and I, if I don't, you know...

136
00:09:39,698 --> 00:09:42,327
turn things around
and do something with my gifts...

137
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:44,038
I don't think it's gonna
really work out for me...

138
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:45,457
and I wouldn't blame her.

139
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:50,882
Avengers are a very unique group
of superheroes...

140
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,259
that stand for something...

141
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:55,014
more than just fighting and wearing costumes.

142
00:09:55,181 --> 00:09:58,103
I mean, people look up to us.
Kids look up to us.

143
00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,480
- They...
- I'm sorry. "Us?"

144
00:09:59,647 --> 00:10:01,399
I wasn't aware that you were an Avenger.

145
00:10:02,193 --> 00:10:03,653
- Avengers-adjacent, technically.
- Oh, wow.

146
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,867
What's your superpower?
Is it parallel parking? I am so sorry.

147
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:08,620
That was cruel.

148
00:10:08,787 --> 00:10:10,915
I lash out when I'm nervous.
Won't happen again.

149
00:10:11,082 --> 00:10:12,376
- Let's cut to the chase.
- Please.

150
00:10:12,543 --> 00:10:13,879
You just said moments ago...

151
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:17,969
that you wanted to be an Avenger
because you need it.

152
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:19,721
Yes, sir, I do.

153
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:22,726
But the Avengers don't do the job because
they need it.

154
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:24,813
They do the job because people need them.

155
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:27,442
Do you see the distinction?

156
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:30,697
Yes, sir.

157
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:33,074
Please, Mr. Hogan.

158
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:36,491
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life
like an annoying one-trick pony.

159
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:40,366
All right.

160
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:42,991
Oh, my God, you're standing.

161
00:10:43,158 --> 00:10:44,491
Yeah, now's the time that we stand.

162
00:10:44,658 --> 00:10:45,491
Damn it.

163
00:10:45,658 --> 00:10:47,116
Now, the problem might be that you're...

164
00:10:47,283 --> 00:10:49,533
reaching a little, little too high.

165
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:52,116
Aim for the middle, and you'll never miss.

166
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:54,449
Right? I think you got a good heart.
I believe what you're saying.

167
00:10:55,366 --> 00:10:58,491
But not everybody's the world-saving type.
I'm not, and I'm happy.

168
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,908
Right? I found my place.

169
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:02,991
Find your place.

170
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:05,574
- All right? Get back out there.
- Mm-hmm.

171
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:09,158
- We'll keep an eye on you. Good luck.
- Okay.

172
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:14,616
Fetch the car. I wanna hit Shake Shack.

173
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,824
Rejection makes me hungy.

174
00:11:17,658 --> 00:11:19,199
- Really? No?
- No, no. Please.

175
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:21,949
- Yeah, no, no, no. Okay, thank you.
- Oh, okay.

176
00:11:24,158 --> 00:11:27,241
<i>You know what they say.
When one door closes...</i>

177
00:11:28,574 --> 00:11:29,616
<i>your locker at work opens.</i>

178
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,991
Now let's go sell some certified
pre-owned vehicles, motherfu...

179
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:48,408
Technically, the,
the Carnival's not a minivan.

180
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:50,658
It's an MPV.

181
00:11:50,824 --> 00:11:52,408
So how does the Kia compare to...

182
00:11:52,574 --> 00:11:53,866
- the Honda Odyssey?
- The Odyssey?

183
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:56,574
That's a great question.
It doesn't fucking suck.

184
00:11:57,241 --> 00:11:59,449
You know, you can answer
the question without swearing.

185
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:01,533
I'm sorry, Tammy, I don't, I don't have kids.

186
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:03,824
Not that I haven't dreamt of that...

187
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:06,033
but I don't have a lot of vaginal sex.

188
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:10,908
{\an8}You'll get 'em next time, pal.

189
00:12:11,074 --> 00:12:13,533
And look,
you can always go back to superhero-ing.

190
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,574
I mean,
I know I'd like to see you back in the suit.

191
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:18,699
I don't keep it in my locker
so that I can wear it.

192
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:21,616
I keep it in my locker in case
we need to saddle up again.

193
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,658
Hey, hey, hey. What?
What is that doing in there?

194
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:25,824
I'm done.

195
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:28,533
I'm done.

196
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:31,533
And I'm fine with being done.

197
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:33,199
Look, is sales the best match?

198
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:34,199
Probably not.

199
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:37,741
Is this the life that
I always imagined for myself? Fuck no.

200
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:41,324
But this is the right fit for me,
Sugar Bear, it is.

201
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:43,033
Okay, Mr. Wilson.

202
00:12:43,408 --> 00:12:47,158
I'm just saying, once a month,
we could go on a little mission.

203
00:12:47,324 --> 00:12:49,824
We're human beings. We crave purpose.

204
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:51,658
After all, we're Deadpool.

205
00:12:51,824 --> 00:12:55,783
Please stop saying that. We're not Deadpool.
I'm not even Deadpool anymore.

206
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:59,574
Well, if you're gonna have a midlife crisis,
go big.

207
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:00,741
A few years ago...

208
00:13:00,908 --> 00:13:03,908
a friend of mine got his nipples pierced
with a titanium chain...

209
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:07,033
that goes down
and attaches to his Van Johnson.

210
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:14,199
Are, are you feeling grumplestiltskin
'cause it's your birthday?

211
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:17,033
What?

212
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:18,866
No.

213
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:20,866
No.

214
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:26,241
Surprise!

215
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:28,908
Hey, you guys are lucky I'm not armed.

216
00:13:29,574 --> 00:13:30,741
Get in here.

217
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:33,158
If this were six years ago,
you'd all be dead.

218
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:36,116
So then, he gets out of the cab,
and you will not believe it.

219
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:38,616
- I turn around, and what do I find?
- AirPods.

220
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:40,074
- His AirPods. Come on.
- His AirPods!

221
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:41,158
Crazy story.

222
00:13:41,324 --> 00:13:43,699
- Every time. Come on.
- Every single time.

223
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,199
Make any sales today?

224
00:13:47,366 --> 00:13:48,741
You know I didn't.

225
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:52,033
Did you sell any dreamcatchers on Etsy
or whatever it is that you do?

226
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:53,658
Our rent's due in three days, Wade.

227
00:13:53,824 --> 00:13:55,074
I can't keep carrying you.

228
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:56,866
Relax. I have the money.

229
00:13:57,033 --> 00:14:00,449
I sold some old blood pressure medication
I found lying around.

230
00:14:00,824 --> 00:14:02,199
You tryin' to kill me, motherfucker?

231
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:04,491
I'm not the one dousing everything in salt, motherfucker.

232
00:14:04,658 --> 00:14:06,699
I pray every day that...

233
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:08,533
fire finds your body...

234
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:10,074
and finishes the job...

235
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:12,699
- God didn't have the nuts to do.
- That's hurtful.

236
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:15,699
If you could hear the look on my face,
you'd smell how sad I am.

237
00:14:15,866 --> 00:14:16,991
You watched anything good?

238
00:14:17,158 --> 00:14:18,741
<i>Great British Bake Off.</i>

239
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:20,199
Oh, goddamn.

240
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:22,699
That show stood between me and suicide
for ten years.

241
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:25,241
Those are my feelings
on abortion, religious freedom...

242
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:27,491
animal rights, privacy rights, vaccines...

243
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,866
free-market capitalism,
global climate change.

244
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:32,158
Yeah, duh-duh-duh.
No, no speaking lines, Buck.

245
00:14:32,741 --> 00:14:33,699
Hi, Yukio.

246
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:34,783
Hi, Wade.

247
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:36,658
Nice fake o'clock shadow.

248
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:40,907
It's a summer balayage. From the French.

249
00:14:41,073 --> 00:14:44,240
It's meant to mimic the
natural highlights of the sun.

250
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:46,115
- It's a toupée.
- It's a hair system.

251
00:14:46,282 --> 00:14:49,531
- I love your hair system, Wade.
- Thank you.

252
00:14:49,947 --> 00:14:51,531
Wanna do some cocaine?

253
00:14:51,697 --> 00:14:54,656
Hey, cocaine is the one thing
that Feige said is off limits.

254
00:14:54,822 --> 00:14:57,488
- What about Bolivian marching powder?
- They know all the slang terms.

255
00:14:57,655 --> 00:14:58,613
They have a list.

256
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,446
- Even snowboarding?
- Even disco dust.

257
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:02,198
- White girl interrupted?
- Even Forrest Bump.

258
00:15:02,365 --> 00:15:04,242
- Booger sugar?
- I wouldn't even try powdered gonuts.

259
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:07,871
- You wanna build a snowman?
- Yes. But I can't.

260
00:15:09,414 --> 00:15:10,248
Pull here.

261
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:11,917
- Here?
- Yeah.

262
00:15:13,294 --> 00:15:14,795
- What happened?
- That's the fun part.

263
00:15:16,213 --> 00:15:17,339
Thanks for coming.

264
00:15:17,506 --> 00:15:18,424
Yeah.

265
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,591
How's work?

266
00:15:19,884 --> 00:15:21,093
Oh, I got a promotion.

267
00:15:22,094 --> 00:15:22,970
No way.

268
00:15:23,137 --> 00:15:26,349
Yeah. It's mind-numbing middle management,
but I'm happy.

269
00:15:26,516 --> 00:15:27,559
That's great.

270
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,854
- You seeing anyone?
- How about you?

271
00:15:32,522 --> 00:15:33,356
Yeah.

272
00:15:33,857 --> 00:15:36,402
A guy from work. Dermot.

273
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:37,611
Dermot.

274
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:39,113
- He's kind.
- Good.

275
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,781
Likes to go hiking.

276
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:42,325
Hasn't gotten me shot yet.

277
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:44,619
Well, it's early days.

278
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,500
What about you? You seeing anyone?

279
00:15:51,543 --> 00:15:54,880
No, no, I live in a one-bedroom apartment.
I share a bed with Blind Al.

280
00:15:56,549 --> 00:15:59,802
- Okay. All right.
- All right.

281
00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:04,724
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

282
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:06,434
- Speech! Speech!
- Yes!

283
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:08,394
All right. Okay, okay, okay.

284
00:16:09,354 --> 00:16:10,356
Birthdays.

285
00:16:10,522 --> 00:16:13,192
Boy, every spin around the moon
is a new adventure indeed.

286
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:15,402
- Sun, dumbass.
- Okay, round-earther.

287
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:18,990
- Where was I?
- The adventure of life.

288
00:16:19,156 --> 00:16:20,157
Right.

289
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:21,784
It's been a challenging few years.

290
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:23,828
Haven't seen you guys in a while.

291
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:26,081
Been through a lot, change of life.

292
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:28,166
- Menopause?
- Bitch, are you improv-ing?

293
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,918
- Mm-mm.
- Sorry.

294
00:16:30,878 --> 00:16:32,254
I'm sorry that you had to see that, Yukio.

295
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:33,506
It's okay.

296
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:36,842
But I'm happy.

297
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,511
You know, and that's, that's...

298
00:16:38,677 --> 00:16:41,472
because of each and every one of you.

299
00:16:41,848 --> 00:16:43,307
I guess, what I'm trying to say is...

300
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:44,851
how proud I am, how grateful I am...

301
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:46,270
to be standing in a room...

302
00:16:46,436 --> 00:16:49,106
with every single person I love.

303
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:56,322
I'm the luckiest man alive.

304
00:16:58,824 --> 00:16:59,909
Make a wish, buddy.

305
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:01,411
Ten-four, good buddy.

306
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,747
Going down.

307
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,004
Wade Wilson?

308
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:14,091
Oh, yeah. Dancers.
Dopinder must have ordered you.

309
00:17:14,591 --> 00:17:15,926
Are those supposed to be cop costumes?

310
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,261
Never mind.

311
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:21,266
Take your clothes off but leave the helmets.
And this isn't <i>Pretty Woman.</i>

312
00:17:22,225 --> 00:17:23,518
We're kissing. All right?

313
00:17:23,684 --> 00:17:25,311
What song do you guys normally dance to?

314
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:29,525
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

315
00:17:29,817 --> 00:17:31,026
Is that supposed to be scary?

316
00:17:31,193 --> 00:17:34,822
Pegging isn't new for me, friendo.
But it is for Disney.

317
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:36,074
Ah, ta, ta, ta!

318
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:40,203
Okay, I've never been a natural bottom,
so we're gonna take things real slow.

319
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:42,246
And I want some crazy eye contact.

320
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:43,457
Not you.
You.

321
00:17:43,915 --> 00:17:45,709
Can't see your eyes through the mask,
but I can feel them.

322
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,461
We're gonna move on down the hallway...

323
00:17:47,627 --> 00:17:50,798
so we can spare a cleanup on aisle asshole.
How does everyone feel about this plan?

324
00:17:50,965 --> 00:17:53,926
- I don't like you.
- Yes. Let's hold on to that attitude.

325
00:17:54,093 --> 00:17:55,803
And we're gonna do it angry.

326
00:18:13,948 --> 00:18:15,116
Mr. Wilson...

327
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:19,912
you appear to have soiled yourself
while unconscious.

328
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:22,332
I wasn't unconscious. Who are you?

329
00:18:22,665 --> 00:18:24,459
I go by the name of Paradox.

330
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:28,046
Mr. Paradox.
And you're sitting here at the TVA.

331
00:18:28,213 --> 00:18:30,216
The Time Variance Authority.

332
00:18:30,383 --> 00:18:32,635
We're really a watchdog organization...

333
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:36,514
except we're more lighthearted
than that sounds with a sort of...

334
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:38,767
throwback, ironic twist.

335
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:43,147
And we're in charge of defending
what's known as the Sacred Timeline.

336
00:18:43,313 --> 00:18:46,483
Holy fuck. That is a shit-ton of exposition
for a threequel.

337
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,527
Is this because I used Cable's time machine?

338
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,321
Brought a couple of people back to life,
then I destroyed it.

339
00:18:51,489 --> 00:18:52,865
- That was a long time ago.
- Yes...

340
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:55,701
we're aware of your abuse of your timeline.

341
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,996
And you were so abusive of it.

342
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:00,666
No, it has nothing to do with that.

343
00:19:00,832 --> 00:19:01,917
Walk with me.

344
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:12,011
I brought you here, Mr. Wilson,
to tell you that you're special.

345
00:19:12,762 --> 00:19:15,640
In fact,
you've been chosen for a higher purpose...

346
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:17,517
a purpose unclear even to me.

347
00:19:17,934 --> 00:19:19,978
But one that could...

348
00:19:20,145 --> 00:19:23,065
save the entire Sacred Timeline...

349
00:19:23,231 --> 00:19:25,818
from a possibly grisly fate
sometime in the future...

350
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:30,281
which may very well need to be... avenged.

351
00:19:30,573 --> 00:19:31,950
This Sacred Timeline...

352
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:34,953
I assume I'm going to marvel...

353
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:36,496
at how...

354
00:19:37,163 --> 00:19:38,915
cinematic it feels?

355
00:19:39,082 --> 00:19:41,084
Gratuitous cameos...

356
00:19:41,251 --> 00:19:43,087
indiscriminate use of Variants,
the whole package?

357
00:19:43,253 --> 00:19:45,380
Well, you tell me.

358
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,013
Cap!

359
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:02,774
You are no longer lost, Wade.

360
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:05,402
You can be a hero among heroes.

361
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:08,114
We've been surveilling you for quite a while.

362
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,033
- Subway station.
- A TVA outpost, yes.

363
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:13,370
- And what is that?
- Hmm?

364
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:17,790
Is that me? Is that Thor?

365
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:20,502
Is he crying?

366
00:20:20,668 --> 00:20:22,461
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

367
00:20:22,628 --> 00:20:23,962
That happens in the distant future.

368
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:26,338
- Why is Thor crying? Quick! Tell me.
- Do not speak to her.

369
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:27,339
Stop that. Eyes on me.

370
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:29,715
I brought you here
to offer you an opportunity.

371
00:20:29,882 --> 00:20:33,134
The opportunity you sought years ago,
but for which you were not ready.

372
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,926
We believe you're ready now.

373
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:36,969
Ready for a chance to leave your timeline...

374
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:39,471
and join the greatest universe of all.

375
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,180
I am about to give you the thing
you've always wanted.

376
00:20:41,347 --> 00:20:42,890
Oh, I smell what you're steppin' in.

377
00:20:43,056 --> 00:20:45,474
The power in the Marvel Universe
is about to change forever.

378
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,518
I am the Messiah...

379
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,479
I am...

380
00:20:55,062 --> 00:20:56,313
Marvel Jesus.

381
00:20:57,731 --> 00:21:00,441
Can you excuse me for just a moment?
I'm just gonna go over here.

382
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,235
Suck it, Fox!

383
00:21:05,402 --> 00:21:06,694
I'm going to Disneyland.

384
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:08,112
Get fucked!

385
00:21:11,864 --> 00:21:13,823
- Where do I sign?
- Oh, there's no need for paperwork.

386
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,200
Good. Not to brag, but I do not read.

387
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:19,285
- Oh.
- There is one thing I will need, though.

388
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:25,872
Oh, fuck off!

389
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,998
Adorn me, Beardo.

390
00:21:48,635 --> 00:21:49,594
Fuckin' A!

391
00:21:50,636 --> 00:21:52,470
It's perfect! FYI...

392
00:21:52,637 --> 00:21:55,472
your tailor is a predator,
but I love it. Snug.

393
00:21:55,639 --> 00:22:00,017
No camel toe.
New car smell and adamantium katanas?

394
00:22:00,392 --> 00:22:01,851
You shouldn't have.

395
00:22:02,185 --> 00:22:04,311
Go ahead. Take it in.

396
00:22:04,477 --> 00:22:06,979
And yes, your underwear is getting tighter.

397
00:22:07,146 --> 00:22:08,772
That guy knows what I'm talking about.

398
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:10,440
His clothes says middle management...

399
00:22:10,606 --> 00:22:13,066
but his eyes say fuck-y fuck-y.

400
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:14,900
Yes. You look very nice.

401
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:18,110
"Nice?" Your buddy here is ready to
throw it all away for me.

402
00:22:18,277 --> 00:22:19,486
- You callin' your wife?
- HR.

403
00:22:19,653 --> 00:22:20,821
Does your wife work in HR?

404
00:22:20,987 --> 00:22:23,072
I'm really glad you're taking this so well.

405
00:22:23,405 --> 00:22:25,198
Oh. I'm taking it well.

406
00:22:25,364 --> 00:22:28,325
I have never had a problem
traveling for work. That said...

407
00:22:28,491 --> 00:22:29,659
we should talk vacation days.

408
00:22:30,034 --> 00:22:32,452
I'm more of a
one-week-on-one-week-off kind of guy.

409
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:33,953
I think it's what they do in Denmark.

410
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,580
You know, you'll never see a
Danish flag on the moon, but...

411
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:37,830
goddamn it, they're happy.

412
00:22:37,996 --> 00:22:40,498
Now, let's power up your little
Amazon Fire phone there...

413
00:22:40,665 --> 00:22:43,875
and zip me back home so I can let my friends
know that they've been upgraded...

414
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:45,084
to disciples.

415
00:22:45,251 --> 00:22:48,252
Yeah. I don't think you... quite understand.

416
00:22:49,087 --> 00:22:53,297
You will not be returning to your home
because there will be no home to return to.

417
00:22:53,464 --> 00:22:54,298
Come again?

418
00:22:54,465 --> 00:22:55,506
This time in my ears.

419
00:22:59,884 --> 00:23:02,803
This is your universe, Mr. Wilson.

420
00:23:03,428 --> 00:23:04,679
That...

421
00:23:04,846 --> 00:23:08,931
is what happens when a universe
loses their Anchor Being.

422
00:23:09,098 --> 00:23:11,182
See how it decays from the inside?

423
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:14,017
- This is how a reality dies.
- What's an Anchor Being?

424
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:17,519
An Anchor Being is an entity of
such vital importance that when they die...

425
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:21,188
their whole world
slowly withers out of existence.

426
00:23:21,355 --> 00:23:23,982
You've just won the lottery
because I didn't die.

427
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:25,858
It was just a little midlife crisis.
I'm better now.

428
00:23:26,024 --> 00:23:27,442
Oh, no, no, no.

429
00:23:32,152 --> 00:23:34,863
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, I love to laugh.

430
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:37,740
Can you imagine if you were the Anchor Being?

431
00:23:39,699 --> 00:23:42,200
- Yeah.
- No, it isn't you, Mr. Wilson.

432
00:23:43,034 --> 00:23:47,328
Your Anchor Being died
in an act of self-sacrifice so epic...

433
00:23:47,745 --> 00:23:49,871
that it sent shivers down the Timeline.

434
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:53,081
I am referring, of course, to...

435
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:58,209
Logan. The Wolverine.

436
00:24:01,753 --> 00:24:04,088
<i>Don't be what they made you.</i>

437
00:24:14,469 --> 00:24:16,637
<i>So this is what it feels like...</i>

438
00:24:18,471 --> 00:24:19,471
Logan.

439
00:24:20,389 --> 00:24:21,390
Of course.

440
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,973
Logan.

441
00:24:25,892 --> 00:24:27,184
Logan?

442
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:29,310
The guy with forks for hands?

443
00:24:29,477 --> 00:24:30,728
That Wolverine?

444
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:36,148
Yeah, I got it. You can turn your retro
graphics of death off now. Make it stop.

445
00:24:36,314 --> 00:24:38,774
We're not doing it, Mr. Wilson.
We certainly can't stop it.

446
00:24:41,192 --> 00:24:42,151
How long have we got?

447
00:24:42,317 --> 00:24:44,653
In most cases, couple thousand years.

448
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:46,820
- Well, sweet.
- Well, most cases aren't fast enough.

449
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:47,946
Not for me.

450
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,531
What does that mean?

451
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:51,782
It means that I have been tasked...

452
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,199
with overseeing the end of your universe.

453
00:24:54,366 --> 00:24:56,993
And regardless of what the
pencil pushers upstairs would prefer...

454
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,286
I will not...

455
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:02,038
waste my life watching it die slowly
of natural causes.

456
00:25:02,204 --> 00:25:04,372
We used to just prune these things. Simple.

457
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:06,248
Elegant. Efficient. But I'm told the TVA...

458
00:25:06,415 --> 00:25:08,667
doesn't like to do that anymore.
Well I do.

459
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:11,168
And no matter what my so-called
superiors say, the multiverse...

460
00:25:11,334 --> 00:25:13,002
does not need a babysitter.

461
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:14,961
We need a mercy killer.

462
00:25:15,128 --> 00:25:16,546
And in this instance...

463
00:25:16,712 --> 00:25:19,131
I am the mercy killer.

464
00:25:24,216 --> 00:25:26,135
What in the MacGuffin is that?

465
00:25:26,302 --> 00:25:28,469
That's a Time Ripper, Mr. Wilson.

466
00:25:28,636 --> 00:25:30,179
An accelerant.

467
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:34,933
Once completed, it will allow me to destroy
the spacetime matrix of your universe.

468
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:37,101
You see, I don't want to work for the TVA.

469
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:39,353
I want to be the TVA.

470
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,064
And the first step involves
showing this organization...

471
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,898
how much more efficient it can become.

472
00:25:44,065 --> 00:25:48,360
To wit, I will be giving your universe
a swift and compassionate end.

473
00:25:48,527 --> 00:25:49,945
And don't worry,
your friends won't feel a thing.

474
00:25:50,111 --> 00:25:51,905
It'll be over just like this.
"Oh, what's that?"

475
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:54,365
Trust me.

476
00:26:07,084 --> 00:26:09,252
You're gonna Old Yeller my fucking universe?

477
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,629
Mm... In your parlance, yes.

478
00:26:11,796 --> 00:26:12,838
Two in the heart, one in the head.

479
00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:15,215
Look, Mr. Wilson, you have two choices.

480
00:26:15,382 --> 00:26:18,593
You can either rejoin your loved ones
and collectively cease to exist in...

481
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:21,596
I'd say, seventy-two hours. Or...

482
00:26:21,762 --> 00:26:24,306
you join the Sacred Timeline.

483
00:26:24,473 --> 00:26:26,725
And you end your days of
insignificance...

484
00:26:26,891 --> 00:26:28,809
and mediocrity.

485
00:26:28,976 --> 00:26:29,893
Wade.

486
00:26:30,603 --> 00:26:32,312
Wade, you can finally...

487
00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:34,897
finally, matter.

488
00:26:44,655 --> 00:26:46,699
That's all I've ever really wanted.

489
00:26:46,866 --> 00:26:48,117
I know.

490
00:26:48,742 --> 00:26:49,743
I know.

491
00:26:50,702 --> 00:26:54,205
And you know I'm,
I'm nothing if not morally flexible.

492
00:26:56,707 --> 00:26:57,665
Yep, yep.

493
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:01,002
I'll do it.

494
00:27:01,168 --> 00:27:03,587
Wise choice.
The Sacred Timeline's happy to have you.

495
00:27:03,754 --> 00:27:05,589
I was actually talking about
finding the Wolverine...

496
00:27:05,756 --> 00:27:06,840
and breaking your fucking nose.

497
00:27:20,684 --> 00:27:23,020
Find him. Find him!

498
00:27:23,186 --> 00:27:24,937
<i>And boy, did he ever.</i>

499
00:27:26,814 --> 00:27:28,232
<i>Which brings us back to this.</i>

500
00:27:30,401 --> 00:27:32,360
<i>The desecration of the sacred corpse.</i>

501
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:37,907
Oh, my God!

502
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,951
Oh! My own fucking arm!

503
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,164
Now we're talkin'!

504
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:48,581
Not like this!

505
00:27:48,748 --> 00:27:50,708
No, dear God! No!

506
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:53,044
I'm sorry! Wolverine-ing is hard!

507
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,211
Make it stop!

508
00:27:54,378 --> 00:27:56,129
Mangold tried.

509
00:27:58,381 --> 00:28:00,341
You sick fuck!

510
00:28:00,508 --> 00:28:01,676
Logan was a hero.

511
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:04,761
And the only thing worth a shit
to ever come out of Canada.

512
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:17,021
Get my country's name
out of your fuckin' mouth.

513
00:28:18,147 --> 00:28:19,731
And my sword. Give me that.

514
00:28:23,193 --> 00:28:25,486
Oh, I gotta find me another Logan.

515
00:28:25,945 --> 00:28:27,237
An alive one.

516
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:29,656
Don't get up, guys. I'll see myself out.

517
00:28:37,245 --> 00:28:38,080
Logan!

518
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:43,459
I'm gonna need you to come with me.

519
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:45,752
Who's asking?

520
00:28:47,921 --> 00:28:49,965
Oh, look at this little Hairy Lou Retton.

521
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:51,716
Did you stick the landing, little guy?

522
00:28:52,383 --> 00:28:53,217
Yes, you did!

523
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:55,302
Comic accurate short king.

524
00:28:55,469 --> 00:28:57,554
Such a cute wittle Wolvie.

525
00:28:57,721 --> 00:28:59,430
Cue the fuckin' montage, baby.

526
00:29:00,056 --> 00:29:03,100
Ahoy! Everything seems to be on fire.

527
00:29:03,266 --> 00:29:04,351
You have a dragon?

528
00:29:05,102 --> 00:29:08,020
You have Anchor Being written all over...

529
00:29:17,362 --> 00:29:18,362
Patch!

530
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:21,656
Now we're talkin'.

531
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:23,575
Oh, yeah.

532
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,119
That's the whole goddamn package right there.

533
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,203
Howdy!

534
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,872
I'm just... I'm auditioning Anchor Beings.

535
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,583
Oh. Yeah, that's gonna need some coconut oil.

536
00:29:37,961 --> 00:29:39,796
What in the fuck?

537
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:41,714
Are you okay?

538
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:43,257
Oh, yes, yes.

539
00:29:43,424 --> 00:29:45,259
Classic John Byrne brown and tan.

540
00:29:45,425 --> 00:29:47,386
Now, you fought the Hulk in this outfit. No?

541
00:29:50,263 --> 00:29:51,972
I'm Marvel Jesus, you dull creature,
and I will not...

542
00:30:02,856 --> 00:30:05,400
It's not you. We're just going
in a different direction.

543
00:30:08,694 --> 00:30:10,821
You know, from behind,
you look a little bit like Henry...

544
00:30:10,988 --> 00:30:12,197
Oh, my fuck!

545
00:30:12,531 --> 00:30:15,241
The Cavillrine. The legends are true.

546
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:18,661
And may I say, sir,
on behalf of all humanity...

547
00:30:18,827 --> 00:30:20,537
this just feels right.

548
00:30:20,703 --> 00:30:23,790
We will treat you so much better
than those shit fucks down the street.

549
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:24,999
You were just leavin'.

550
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:27,334
No, sir.
Not while the fate of my universe is at...

551
00:30:32,213 --> 00:30:33,631
This one looks promising.

552
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:34,632
Down you go.

553
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:37,259
Again.

554
00:30:38,385 --> 00:30:40,344
I told you. You're not welcome here.

555
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:41,929
You're not welcome anywhere.

556
00:30:42,096 --> 00:30:43,306
Now get the fuck out of my bar.

557
00:30:43,472 --> 00:30:45,933
Just give me one more drink
and then I'll leave.

558
00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:47,725
That's not how it works.

559
00:30:47,892 --> 00:30:50,144
It does now. Leave the bottle.

560
00:30:50,311 --> 00:30:51,145
I know you, bub?

561
00:30:51,312 --> 00:30:53,397
Nope. But I know you.

562
00:30:53,814 --> 00:30:55,190
Everybody knows me.

563
00:30:56,774 --> 00:30:57,942
I'm the Wolverine.

564
00:30:58,108 --> 00:30:59,902
Yes, you are.

565
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:02,362
And I'm gonna need you
to come with me right now.

566
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,156
Look, lady, I'm not interested.

567
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:08,033
- Really gettin' into your cups here.
- Why would I go with you?

568
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,078
Because, unfortunately...

569
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,162
I need you...

570
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:16,416
and even more unfortunately,
my entire world needs you.

571
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,711
You two gonna fuck or fight?

572
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:23,882
You gonna take that from him?

573
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,092
Yep.

574
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:27,010
I can tell you have a sort of...

575
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:29,638
don't-get-too-close-I'll-only-
break-your-heart vibe going here...

576
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,057
but every other Wolverine
would've really hurt me by now.

577
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:35,103
And, I'm sort of on the tick-tick.
So upsy-daisy. Here we go.

578
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,480
- Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey!
- Up you go. I got you, big guy.

579
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,026
Whiskey dick of the claws.

580
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:44,653
- It's quite common in Wolverines over forty.
- You don't want this.

581
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:47,365
You're right. I don't.
And you don't want this.

582
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:50,159
Unless you wanna take a deep breath
through your fuckin' forehead...

583
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:52,203
I suggest you reconsider.

584
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,454
Let's go, peanut.

585
00:31:58,001 --> 00:31:59,836
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

586
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:01,380
Watch this.

587
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:04,549
All right. That... Whoa.

588
00:32:05,216 --> 00:32:06,050
Easy.

589
00:32:09,846 --> 00:32:10,680
Good God.

590
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:13,183
Thirsty little honey badger, aren't ya?

591
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:15,894
It's okay. Keep goin'.

592
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:17,897
Audiences are accustomed to long run times.

593
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:25,404
Guess you'll have to do.

594
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:26,864
Okay, here we...

595
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:30,409
Oh! Look at those jammies.

596
00:32:30,826 --> 00:32:34,079
That only took twenty fucking years.

597
00:32:34,497 --> 00:32:36,457
One Anchor Being coming right up!

598
00:32:36,624 --> 00:32:38,709
On your left, baby girl.

599
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:42,338
This Logan has the same
he-can-do-anything-even-musicals look.

600
00:32:42,505 --> 00:32:43,506
And bonus...

601
00:32:43,673 --> 00:32:44,965
he's actually wearing a costume...

602
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:46,842
like he's not embarrassed to be in
a superhero movie for once.

603
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:48,344
I don't understand.

604
00:32:48,511 --> 00:32:49,929
You said my universe is dying...

605
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:52,515
because this sack of nuts
got himself killed.

606
00:32:52,682 --> 00:32:55,226
- Well, problem solved.
- My God.

607
00:32:55,393 --> 00:32:59,397
You actually think
you can replace an Anchor Being...

608
00:32:59,564 --> 00:33:00,982
with this?

609
00:33:01,817 --> 00:33:04,861
I wouldn't have accepted any other Wolverine
BT dubs. But you...

610
00:33:05,028 --> 00:33:08,448
have outdone yourself
and brought me the worst Wolverine!

611
00:33:08,615 --> 00:33:09,575
What do you mean, the worst one?

612
00:33:09,741 --> 00:33:10,701
Mr. Wilson.

613
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:14,496
This Wolverine let down his entire world.

614
00:33:15,372 --> 00:33:17,249
He's the stuff of legend,
but not in a good way.

615
00:33:17,624 --> 00:33:18,917
And what he did...

616
00:33:19,084 --> 00:33:20,294
well...

617
00:33:20,461 --> 00:33:22,588
some things are just beyond forgiveness.

618
00:33:25,174 --> 00:33:26,008
Okay.

619
00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:28,844
How do I... How do I make this right?
I'll do anything.

620
00:33:29,345 --> 00:33:32,306
I gave you a chance at greatness.

621
00:33:32,473 --> 00:33:34,767
Because my superiors deemed you special.

622
00:33:34,934 --> 00:33:36,435
Clearly not special in a good way.

623
00:33:36,602 --> 00:33:39,438
Apparently you have some
important future purpose to serve.

624
00:33:39,605 --> 00:33:40,732
With Thor. He holds me.

625
00:33:40,898 --> 00:33:44,861
But, I did my duty.
I gave you the opportunity to be somebody.

626
00:33:45,027 --> 00:33:48,239
And instead of accepting my offering
with humility and gratitude...

627
00:33:48,406 --> 00:33:49,240
you broke my nose.

628
00:33:49,616 --> 00:33:52,159
- It looks great.
- And you decimated dozens of my men...

629
00:33:52,327 --> 00:33:53,953
with the exhumed corpse of a hero.

630
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,164
Dishonoring not only his remains
but his memory.

631
00:33:56,331 --> 00:33:57,374
What are you, the Internet?

632
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,709
Your world is dying!

633
00:33:59,876 --> 00:34:00,877
Thank you very much.

634
00:34:01,378 --> 00:34:02,504
And there's no stopping it.

635
00:34:04,797 --> 00:34:06,299
The humane thing to do...

636
00:34:06,466 --> 00:34:07,342
is to make it quick.

637
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:10,220
Is the thought of vaporizing my universe
making you peckish?

638
00:34:10,387 --> 00:34:11,429
I'm eating my feelings.

639
00:34:11,596 --> 00:34:14,642
I'm about to lose everything that I've
ever cared about because that hairy...

640
00:34:14,808 --> 00:34:16,559
thundercunt from down undercunt...

641
00:34:16,727 --> 00:34:19,772
finally dies
and he's standing right behind me, isn't he?

642
00:34:20,481 --> 00:34:21,774
Welcome to the MCU, by the way.

643
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,817
You're joining at a bit of a low point.

644
00:34:24,652 --> 00:34:26,570
As for you, I wanna talk to your boss.

645
00:34:26,737 --> 00:34:29,907
I want you to get him on the phone
and you tell him, her, or them...

646
00:34:30,073 --> 00:34:32,201
that Marvel H. Christ isn't playing.

647
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:38,541
Holy shit.

648
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:43,212
I just heard a symphony
of buttholes clenching all at once.

649
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:44,255
You're off grid.

650
00:34:44,422 --> 00:34:46,758
Your bosses don't know what you sick fucks
are doing down here.

651
00:34:46,925 --> 00:34:49,969
Well, I'll tell you what.
I have a black belt in Karen...

652
00:34:50,136 --> 00:34:51,429
And I'm gonna go upstairs...

653
00:34:51,595 --> 00:34:53,557
and I'm gonna tell 'em all about
you and your...

654
00:34:54,683 --> 00:34:56,309
Silence is nice, isn't it?

655
00:34:56,476 --> 00:34:57,477
Where the fuck did he go?

656
00:34:57,644 --> 00:34:59,353
To the trash heap. You'll fit right in.

657
00:35:02,607 --> 00:35:03,442
That was close.

658
00:35:24,964 --> 00:35:26,841
Don't just stand there, you ape.

659
00:35:27,466 --> 00:35:28,508
Give me a hand up.

660
00:35:30,302 --> 00:35:32,179
Nope. I'm actually okay.
Thank you very much...

661
00:35:34,724 --> 00:35:35,558
Where the hell are we?

662
00:35:35,725 --> 00:35:38,268
I don't know. Looks kind of Mad Max-y.

663
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,313
But that would be IP infringement, right?

664
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,647
Fucking jokes.

665
00:35:45,025 --> 00:35:46,402
Fuck! Fuck.

666
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:47,903
Were you even listening back there?

667
00:35:48,071 --> 00:35:50,740
If we don't make it back to that
Mr. Paradox asshole...

668
00:35:51,074 --> 00:35:52,242
everyone I know is gonna die.

669
00:35:52,408 --> 00:35:54,077
Not my fuckin' problem.

670
00:35:54,244 --> 00:35:55,453
Oh, is that all you got?

671
00:35:56,496 --> 00:35:58,498
Is that what you said
when your world went to shit?

672
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:01,793
Come again?

673
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,336
Yeah, I heard all about you.

674
00:36:03,879 --> 00:36:05,922
How you screwed up everything.

675
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:08,759
You should be thankin' me
for pulling you out of that bed you shit in.

676
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:11,177
You back-stabbing son of a bitch!

677
00:36:17,226 --> 00:36:18,644
Are you ready to be calm now?

678
00:36:25,776 --> 00:36:28,279
Rest in pieces, Fox.

679
00:36:43,044 --> 00:36:44,546
I don't want to fight you, peanut.

680
00:36:45,755 --> 00:36:47,214
Doesn't matter what you did.

681
00:36:47,507 --> 00:36:48,550
I just need your help.

682
00:36:50,427 --> 00:36:52,011
I don't fuckin' care.

683
00:36:54,431 --> 00:36:55,265
Uh-oh.

684
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:03,148
Fuck. This is gonna hurt.

685
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:08,653
All right.

686
00:37:08,987 --> 00:37:09,822
Fuck it.

687
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:12,615
Let's give the people what they came for.

688
00:37:13,408 --> 00:37:15,160
Let's fuckin' go.

689
00:37:16,328 --> 00:37:18,330
Get your special sock out, nerds.

690
00:37:18,496 --> 00:37:20,332
It's gonna get good.

691
00:38:13,387 --> 00:38:14,388
Gotcha!

692
00:38:20,978 --> 00:38:21,812
Baby Knife!

693
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:28,527
Let's see you grow your fuckin' head back.

694
00:38:28,694 --> 00:38:30,738
Wait, wait, wait! I can fix it! I can fix it.

695
00:38:30,905 --> 00:38:32,698
- Fix what?
- Whatever it is that you did.

696
00:38:33,616 --> 00:38:34,992
Whatever made you so bad.

697
00:38:35,493 --> 00:38:39,289
Those, those pricks in the TVA.
You heard him.

698
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,791
They have the power to end my universe...

699
00:38:41,957 --> 00:38:45,044
but they also have the power to change yours.

700
00:38:46,754 --> 00:38:47,838
We get back there...

701
00:38:48,005 --> 00:38:51,051
and we can fix your world. Together.

702
00:38:52,385 --> 00:38:53,469
I promise.

703
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:56,222
They can fix it.

704
00:38:57,348 --> 00:38:58,599
Hey!

705
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:00,769
We fight each other, we lose.

706
00:39:00,936 --> 00:39:02,187
Dear God, it's him.

707
00:39:02,353 --> 00:39:04,355
- Who?
- The one.

708
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:07,067
The superhero equivalent
to comfort food, or Molly.

709
00:39:07,651 --> 00:39:10,987
White guys' answer to all the
disappointments. And another A-lister.

710
00:39:11,655 --> 00:39:13,031
Fair warning, gorgeous.

711
00:39:13,198 --> 00:39:15,158
You're going to encounter
some indelicate language...

712
00:39:15,326 --> 00:39:17,661
a smidge of ass play,
but we've been prohibited...

713
00:39:17,828 --> 00:39:19,205
from using cocaine. On camera.

714
00:39:19,371 --> 00:39:20,206
They're coming.

715
00:39:20,456 --> 00:39:21,957
Who's "they?"

716
00:39:28,547 --> 00:39:29,966
Oh, they're driving angry.

717
00:39:35,805 --> 00:39:37,849
Now that's a superhero landing.

718
00:39:44,814 --> 00:39:46,065
I got this.

719
00:40:09,757 --> 00:40:10,590
Stay close.

720
00:40:11,216 --> 00:40:12,092
Aye, aye, Cap'n.

721
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:14,637
You got this.

722
00:40:16,972 --> 00:40:20,392
Cassandra is gonna be giddy
when she sees what we caught.

723
00:40:21,435 --> 00:40:22,436
You can't run.

724
00:40:22,603 --> 00:40:23,812
Everybody knows that.

725
00:40:23,979 --> 00:40:26,106
You see anyone runnin', dick for brains?

726
00:40:27,232 --> 00:40:28,901
You're not gonna love what happens next.

727
00:40:29,067 --> 00:40:30,528
Oh. Oh, my God.

728
00:40:30,986 --> 00:40:31,820
Oh, my God.

729
00:40:31,987 --> 00:40:34,198
- Oh, my God, he's gonna say it.
- Ah! Fuck.

730
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,492
- Oh, my God! He's gonna say it!
- Say what?

731
00:40:36,659 --> 00:40:37,660
Avengers, assemble...

732
00:40:37,826 --> 00:40:39,078
- Flame on!
- I'm sorry, what now?

733
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:03,061
Fuck!

734
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:08,983
We don't know that guy.

735
00:41:09,151 --> 00:41:10,026
We thought we did.

736
00:41:10,277 --> 00:41:11,695
I know you.

737
00:41:12,446 --> 00:41:13,280
Holy...

738
00:41:15,824 --> 00:41:16,866
Sabretooth.

739
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:18,410
Your brother.

740
00:41:19,328 --> 00:41:21,288
Ready to die?

741
00:41:21,455 --> 00:41:23,708
Wait, wait, wait!
Time!

742
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:25,960
You look ridiculous.

743
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:28,713
People have waited decades for this fight.

744
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:30,548
It's not gonna be easy.
Baby Knife.

745
00:41:30,715 --> 00:41:32,467
Shoot the double, you take him down.

746
00:41:32,633 --> 00:41:34,635
Side control, then full mount...

747
00:41:34,802 --> 00:41:37,763
and you ground and pound
till he makes no sound because he's dead.

748
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:38,764
Shut the fuck up!

749
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:39,890
Oh, my God!

750
00:41:40,057 --> 00:41:41,684
Okay. Good luck. I'm a huge fan.

751
00:41:54,739 --> 00:41:55,824
What is it, girl?

752
00:41:55,991 --> 00:41:57,117
Is there trouble at the well?

753
00:42:03,331 --> 00:42:04,249
Big trouble.

754
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,001
Behold!

755
00:42:06,167 --> 00:42:09,045
The head of your precious queen...

756
00:42:09,212 --> 00:42:10,213
Furiosa!

757
00:42:11,382 --> 00:42:13,049
I have the Wolverine!

758
00:42:13,216 --> 00:42:16,303
I alone control her!

759
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,389
You come for me...

760
00:42:18,889 --> 00:42:21,267
you come for her.

761
00:42:23,018 --> 00:42:26,647
So sorry. I know it's pronounced "him."
I'm gender blind. It's my cross to bear.

762
00:42:26,813 --> 00:42:27,773
Who's next?

763
00:42:28,149 --> 00:42:29,191
Toad!

764
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:30,234
You're up.

765
00:42:37,992 --> 00:42:40,036
- Uh-oh. Oh, holy...
- Fuck.

766
00:42:50,963 --> 00:42:52,924
God of Thunder.

767
00:42:56,844 --> 00:42:58,138
How long was I asleep?

768
00:42:58,305 --> 00:43:00,098
Not all of you was asleep.

769
00:43:00,265 --> 00:43:01,641
Don't bother.

770
00:43:01,808 --> 00:43:03,601
They're very thorough.

771
00:43:04,061 --> 00:43:06,104
If you know where we are, start talking.

772
00:43:06,855 --> 00:43:07,856
You're in The Void.

773
00:43:08,481 --> 00:43:09,775
Think of it as purgatory.

774
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:13,070
Reed called it a metaphysical junkyard.

775
00:43:13,236 --> 00:43:16,364
Where anything useless goes
before it gets annihilated forever.

776
00:43:16,907 --> 00:43:20,911
And where the TVA sends people that don't
play nice with the rest of the multiverse.

777
00:43:21,078 --> 00:43:22,496
- Like you?
- And you.

778
00:43:22,663 --> 00:43:24,039
What does the annihilating?

779
00:43:24,623 --> 00:43:25,458
Alioth.

780
00:43:25,624 --> 00:43:29,295
Alioth is in this thing?
From <i>Loki,</i> season one, episode five?

781
00:43:29,462 --> 00:43:31,380
Everyone here is on the run from Alioth.

782
00:43:32,047 --> 00:43:33,507
Most don't make it.

783
00:43:33,674 --> 00:43:34,967
There's a resistance, though.

784
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:38,512
Other people like us that managed to survive.

785
00:43:38,846 --> 00:43:42,683
They're hidin' out in the borderlands,
trying to find a way the fuck outta here.

786
00:43:42,851 --> 00:43:44,185
Then that's where we go.

787
00:43:44,352 --> 00:43:46,062
"We?" Us? A team?

788
00:43:46,229 --> 00:43:48,022
The answer is yes.
Shake on it.

789
00:43:48,773 --> 00:43:50,024
Fuck! You nicked it.

790
00:43:50,191 --> 00:43:52,026
Just got the tip with
your little steak knife.

791
00:43:52,193 --> 00:43:54,153
These "others" can help us
get back to the TVA.

792
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,238
Make 'em fix things.

793
00:43:57,532 --> 00:43:58,533
Something funny, bub?

794
00:43:59,158 --> 00:44:00,869
She might have somethin' to say about that.

795
00:44:01,035 --> 00:44:01,995
Who's "she?"

796
00:44:03,288 --> 00:44:04,373
In The Void...

797
00:44:04,623 --> 00:44:06,291
you're either food for Alioth...

798
00:44:07,083 --> 00:44:09,128
or you work for her.

799
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,495
Huh. Paul Rudd finally aged.

800
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:25,998
You must be this year's Juggernaut.

801
00:45:26,373 --> 00:45:27,917
- Thank you.
- I'd keep your voices down.

802
00:45:28,084 --> 00:45:29,210
She don't like the chatter.

803
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:30,627
She's gonna love you.

804
00:45:46,769 --> 00:45:48,187
Is it... Is that Charles?

805
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,648
Hey... Hey, Chuck! It's us!

806
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:51,983
That's not Chuck.

807
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:53,276
Ah, shit.

808
00:45:54,736 --> 00:45:56,196
Oh, ableism. Great.

809
00:45:56,363 --> 00:45:58,781
That's not gonna go over well
with the woke mob.

810
00:45:58,948 --> 00:46:00,408
A Wolverine.

811
00:46:00,908 --> 00:46:03,203
I wondered when I'd get one of you.

812
00:46:03,954 --> 00:46:05,122
You're one of Xavier's.

813
00:46:05,288 --> 00:46:06,748
You-You know him? You know Chuck?

814
00:46:06,915 --> 00:46:08,000
Oh, I knew him.

815
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:09,793
We shared a womb.

816
00:46:10,002 --> 00:46:13,505
Tried to strangle the sly little fellow
with my umbilical cord.

817
00:46:13,672 --> 00:46:16,675
Amen. I've never loved roommates.
Mine's blind.

818
00:46:17,009 --> 00:46:18,385
Except she can see cocaine.

819
00:46:18,636 --> 00:46:20,137
For some... reason.

820
00:46:20,303 --> 00:46:23,015
You want to chime in, Your Majesty?
I'm dying here.

821
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:24,307
Who are you?

822
00:46:24,475 --> 00:46:27,185
Charles Xavier's twin, Cassandra Nova.

823
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,896
- Bullshit!
- I was an anal birth.

824
00:46:29,772 --> 00:46:30,981
You two are cute.

825
00:46:31,899 --> 00:46:33,234
I have a good feeling about this.

826
00:46:36,279 --> 00:46:37,405
And I've been trying to catch...

827
00:46:37,571 --> 00:46:39,282
this little firefly for years.

828
00:46:40,074 --> 00:46:41,659
Haven't I, Johnny?

829
00:46:41,826 --> 00:46:45,038
Aw... You picked the wrong time
to make new friends.

830
00:46:45,204 --> 00:46:47,540
Oh, Johnny told us all about you.

831
00:46:47,707 --> 00:46:49,000
- Maybe shut up now.
- Yeah, maybe don't...

832
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:50,251
We're just talkin' here.

833
00:46:50,418 --> 00:46:53,588
Yeah, Johnny told us
you're a psychotic megalomaniacal asshole.

834
00:46:53,755 --> 00:46:54,506
His words, not mine.

835
00:46:54,673 --> 00:46:57,050
Hellbent on domination and pain.

836
00:46:58,259 --> 00:47:00,219
- You said all that about me?
- No!

837
00:47:00,387 --> 00:47:03,723
- No! I don't... I didn't say any of that!
- Sticks and stones, Johnny!

838
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:07,352
Don't let her intimidate you.

839
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,104
It's like you said in the convoy.

840
00:47:09,271 --> 00:47:12,107
This finger-lickin' dead-inside
pixie slab of...

841
00:47:12,274 --> 00:47:13,984
third rate dime-store nut-milk...

842
00:47:14,151 --> 00:47:15,945
can eat your delicious cinnamon ring...

843
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:18,113
- and kick rocks all the way to bald hell.
- Okay.

844
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,115
I have never said any of those words...

845
00:47:20,282 --> 00:47:22,326
- in my entire life!
- Ha! The modesty.

846
00:47:22,492 --> 00:47:25,370
People think I'm a shit talker.
But this guy...

847
00:47:25,746 --> 00:47:26,581
Next level.

848
00:47:26,747 --> 00:47:28,666
What? This... I... We...

849
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:30,250
I don't even know what half of that means!

850
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:32,920
- This... I... What? This...
- My hat's off to you, sir. Truly.

851
00:47:33,087 --> 00:47:34,296
I didn't... He's... That's...

852
00:47:35,089 --> 00:47:36,173
I don't...

853
00:47:41,721 --> 00:47:42,638
Not my favorite Chris.

854
00:47:42,805 --> 00:47:45,308
You stupid piece of shit.
You just got him fucking killed!

855
00:47:45,475 --> 00:47:47,227
Hey! We're all grieving!

856
00:47:47,393 --> 00:47:49,437
PS, do you know what
he was doing to the budget?

857
00:47:52,148 --> 00:47:53,984
Alioth is hungry.

858
00:47:54,901 --> 00:47:56,486
There's been some kind of mistake.

859
00:47:56,652 --> 00:47:58,363
Big yellow is a back up Anchor Being...

860
00:47:58,529 --> 00:48:00,949
and I'm Marvel Jesus. MJ, if you're nasty.

861
00:48:01,116 --> 00:48:02,158
This may be hard to hear...

862
00:48:02,325 --> 00:48:04,995
but there's another British villain
who's gonna destroy my universe...

863
00:48:05,161 --> 00:48:06,162
and I'm gonna stop him.

864
00:48:06,329 --> 00:48:09,207
Oh, honey, you don't really strike me as
the world-saving type.

865
00:48:11,752 --> 00:48:12,711
Did I hit a nerve?

866
00:48:13,795 --> 00:48:15,088
I didn't want it to come to this.

867
00:48:15,964 --> 00:48:16,882
Either you help us...

868
00:48:17,048 --> 00:48:20,010
or my friend here is gonna sing
the entire second act of <i>Music Man...</i>

869
00:48:20,177 --> 00:48:21,345
with zero warm-up.

870
00:48:22,221 --> 00:48:23,430
Where'd you get the chair?

871
00:48:23,597 --> 00:48:26,100
Well, once in a while,
I do get a Charles through here.

872
00:48:26,517 --> 00:48:27,894
Never mine, though.

873
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:31,230
No. He didn't care to find me.

874
00:48:32,398 --> 00:48:34,901
Gen Z and their trauma-bragging!

875
00:48:35,067 --> 00:48:37,612
Can't you just stuff it down,
turn it into accomplishment...

876
00:48:37,779 --> 00:48:39,405
or cancer like the rest of us?

877
00:48:39,572 --> 00:48:41,240
But I'm not like the rest of you.

878
00:48:41,407 --> 00:48:43,159
Except maybe the Wolverine.

879
00:48:43,325 --> 00:48:45,787
Now, we could be truly terrifying together.

880
00:48:45,953 --> 00:48:47,204
You're that scary, huh?

881
00:48:47,372 --> 00:48:49,206
The TVA certainly thought so.

882
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:51,918
They sent me here before I could walk.

883
00:48:52,377 --> 00:48:55,046
And you know, it's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

884
00:48:55,505 --> 00:48:56,423
I love it here.

885
00:48:56,589 --> 00:48:58,050
You live in a garbage dump.

886
00:48:58,216 --> 00:49:00,969
I think we both know who lives
in the garbage dump.

887
00:49:01,344 --> 00:49:02,804
The Void is a paradise.

888
00:49:03,138 --> 00:49:06,975
I can wield my power here without shame.

889
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:10,645
Unfortunately I had no Charles Xavier
to teach me temperance.

890
00:49:11,354 --> 00:49:13,190
What about your Charles?

891
00:49:13,356 --> 00:49:14,482
Did he protect you?

892
00:49:15,275 --> 00:49:17,360
Did he make you feel safe?

893
00:49:17,528 --> 00:49:19,447
We're mutants. We're never safe.

894
00:49:27,663 --> 00:49:29,748
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I don't... I don't want the smoke.

895
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:33,043
I don't have any beef with you.
I just want to save my friends.

896
00:49:33,211 --> 00:49:34,545
I just... I want to go home.

897
00:49:34,712 --> 00:49:36,380
Well, the thing is, I could get you home.

898
00:49:36,547 --> 00:49:38,132
- Good.
- But I don't want to.

899
00:49:38,299 --> 00:49:39,592
Not good.

900
00:49:42,761 --> 00:49:45,056
What do you want, Wade Wilson?

901
00:49:45,556 --> 00:49:48,935
Your... fingers are inside me,
but not in a good way.

902
00:49:49,102 --> 00:49:52,063
My brother could
enter one's mind with a thought.

903
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,566
I have to get my hands dirty.

904
00:49:57,444 --> 00:49:58,778
I've got you.

905
00:50:01,197 --> 00:50:02,324
<i>I've got you...</i>

906
00:50:04,951 --> 00:50:05,869
<i>What do you mean?</i>

907
00:50:08,037 --> 00:50:10,457
I can't, I can't reach you. You're not here.

908
00:50:10,624 --> 00:50:12,042
I'm right here.

909
00:50:12,501 --> 00:50:15,337
- No, you're not. I can't...
- I'm right here.

910
00:50:15,504 --> 00:50:17,506
Then show me. You got to do something.

911
00:50:18,924 --> 00:50:19,800
Show you what?

912
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:23,137
Show me you care about
something bigger than you.

913
00:50:24,263 --> 00:50:28,058
<i>Ever since they turned you down,
you took a knee.</i>

914
00:50:28,893 --> 00:50:30,853
Baby, you never got back up.

915
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:36,651
I know you're going through something.
Let me go through it with you.

916
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:40,070
- Your crazy matches my crazy.
- Your crazy matches my crazy.

917
00:50:43,699 --> 00:50:44,700
Where'd you go?

918
00:50:45,326 --> 00:50:46,661
Oh, my God.

919
00:50:49,664 --> 00:50:51,332
<i>You just say it. Okay?</i>

920
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:53,209
<i>Say, "I don't want you.</i>

921
00:50:53,376 --> 00:50:54,669
<i>"I don't want to be with you."</i>

922
00:50:55,837 --> 00:50:57,172
<i>Go ahead. Say it. Say, say, "I don't..."</i>

923
00:50:57,338 --> 00:50:58,423
Say it. You don't wanna be with me.

924
00:50:58,882 --> 00:51:01,217
<i>Tell me that and I'll walk away.
Say, "I don't want you."</i>

925
00:51:08,058 --> 00:51:08,892
Fuck...

926
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:11,603
You'll never fucking matter.

927
00:51:15,482 --> 00:51:17,193
What?

928
00:51:17,568 --> 00:51:20,321
- You'll never fucking matter.
- Fucking matter.

929
00:51:26,785 --> 00:51:28,662
- <i>You'll...</i>
- <i>You'll...</i>

930
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:30,206
- never...
- <i>never...</i>

931
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:31,958
- fucking...
- <i>fucking...</i>

932
00:51:32,124 --> 00:51:34,919
- matter.
- <i>matter...</i>

933
00:51:36,963 --> 00:51:38,339
She never said that.

934
00:51:38,505 --> 00:51:39,465
No.

935
00:51:39,632 --> 00:51:41,509
But I bet she thought it.

936
00:51:43,636 --> 00:51:45,262
You are so mean!

937
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:48,057
My brain could taste your fingers,
and they tasted like hate!

938
00:51:48,766 --> 00:51:51,269
And where in God's name
is the intimacy coordinator?

939
00:51:51,436 --> 00:51:53,688
You're so lost, Mr. Wilson.

940
00:51:54,231 --> 00:51:56,483
And long before you came here.

941
00:51:57,984 --> 00:52:00,403
This is Baby Knife.
She's gonna fuck you in the face now.

942
00:52:00,653 --> 00:52:03,615
If you want to kill me,
it's going to take more than a little blade.

943
00:52:03,907 --> 00:52:04,782
How about six?

944
00:52:06,785 --> 00:52:08,620
My boy's wicked strong.

945
00:52:09,121 --> 00:52:10,663
That's my big boy.

946
00:52:10,956 --> 00:52:12,290
Yes, you are.

947
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:19,715
Well, this has been fun.

948
00:52:20,132 --> 00:52:22,300
But the big guy needs to eat
and the rent is due.

949
00:52:25,721 --> 00:52:26,555
By the way...

950
00:52:26,722 --> 00:52:28,140
you're the rent.

951
00:52:48,327 --> 00:52:50,163
Come on! Fuck!

952
00:52:50,329 --> 00:52:51,414
You comin' or what?

953
00:52:51,581 --> 00:52:52,456
Coming!

954
00:53:12,686 --> 00:53:13,687
What you thinkin' 'bout?

955
00:53:13,853 --> 00:53:14,897
Get the fuck off of me!

956
00:53:15,439 --> 00:53:16,315
Almost done.

957
00:53:16,481 --> 00:53:17,566
Almost done what?

958
00:53:17,732 --> 00:53:20,110
Getting my knife out of your buttocks,
pervert!

959
00:53:20,277 --> 00:53:21,195
Fuck!

960
00:53:21,361 --> 00:53:23,072
Get your mind out of my pants!

961
00:53:23,238 --> 00:53:24,073
I'm telling Blake.

962
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:25,282
New rules.

963
00:53:25,825 --> 00:53:26,659
I talk now.

964
00:53:26,826 --> 00:53:30,245
- That's gonna be very hard on the audience.
- Shut the fuck up!

965
00:53:30,996 --> 00:53:31,872
Let me fuckin' think.

966
00:53:32,164 --> 00:53:33,999
Now we gotta get back to Paradox, right?

967
00:53:36,085 --> 00:53:36,919
Right?

968
00:53:38,796 --> 00:53:42,091
- Am I allowed to speak now or...
- Just nod, asshole.

969
00:53:43,718 --> 00:53:44,635
Right.

970
00:53:44,802 --> 00:53:47,638
Then we find the others that poor kid, Johnny
was talking about before you got him killed!

971
00:53:47,805 --> 00:53:49,432
"Poor kid." He's like fifty!

972
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,102
Yeah, if there's a chance they know
how to get out of here, we find 'em.

973
00:53:52,268 --> 00:53:55,646
And make those TVA fuckers fix my shit
like you fucking promised!

974
00:53:55,814 --> 00:53:57,023
I smell quest.

975
00:53:59,776 --> 00:54:00,777
I smell food.

976
00:54:04,197 --> 00:54:07,534
So what made you finally wear an
honest-to-God costume?

977
00:54:09,244 --> 00:54:11,330
Mine's red so they can't see me bleed.

978
00:54:11,497 --> 00:54:14,165
But I could see how
yellow would be useful too.

979
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:15,876
Have you been checked for ADHD?

980
00:54:16,042 --> 00:54:17,085
Mm-mm.

981
00:54:17,336 --> 00:54:19,463
But I've had several STDs, which...

982
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:21,340
were probably caused by ADHD.

983
00:54:21,507 --> 00:54:22,299
Fuck!

984
00:54:23,759 --> 00:54:24,718
What are you looking for?

985
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,013
Thank fuck.

986
00:54:28,055 --> 00:54:29,849
No, no, no. That's rubbing alcohol.

987
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,601
You don't want to drink...
Oh, yeah. There you go. Fuck that liver.

988
00:54:34,311 --> 00:54:36,022
Good. Okay.

989
00:54:37,064 --> 00:54:38,190
What the fuck are those?

990
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:42,654
Back in civilian life, I wear a toupee,
but nobody knows.

991
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,241
Everybody knows.

992
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,746
Wanna talk about what's haunting you, or...

993
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,831
should we wait for a third act flashback?

994
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:55,750
Go fuck yourself.

995
00:54:59,087 --> 00:54:59,921
You know...

996
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,216
in my world, you're...

997
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,511
You're well regarded.

998
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:08,096
Yeah, well, not in mine.

999
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,517
- They don't like me much in mine either.
- You don't say.

1000
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:14,394
I wanted to be something, you know. I...

1001
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,147
Shit, I wanted to be an Avenger.

1002
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:19,232
- Fuck the Avengers.
- Yeah.

1003
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,819
I didn't make the cut, though.
Same with the X-Men...

1004
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:24,947
When my girlfriend left me...

1005
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,240
- and then I just...
- You had a girlfriend?

1006
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:27,825
Yeah.

1007
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:29,160
Vanessa.

1008
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:31,245
When we met, she was a dancer.

1009
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:33,456
We had a whole life.

1010
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:35,749
It was good.

1011
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:37,919
But, oh, boy, I just...

1012
00:55:39,879 --> 00:55:41,380
Fucked that right up.

1013
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:43,299
But you.

1014
00:55:43,466 --> 00:55:44,592
You were an X-Man.

1015
00:55:44,926 --> 00:55:46,761
Fuck that. You were the X-Man. You...

1016
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,848
The Wolverine.

1017
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:53,768
He was a hero in my world.

1018
00:55:55,687 --> 00:55:56,521
Yeah, well...

1019
00:55:57,939 --> 00:55:59,107
he ain't shit in mine.

1020
00:56:04,654 --> 00:56:07,157
You said, "Logan was a hero."
What happened?

1021
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:08,867
He died.

1022
00:56:09,618 --> 00:56:10,452
How?

1023
00:56:11,328 --> 00:56:13,830
Well, technically,
you were chest-fucked by a tree, but...

1024
00:56:13,998 --> 00:56:16,583
really, you just ran out of batteries
trying to save someone.

1025
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:17,584
Who?

1026
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:21,255
The shitheels that grew her in a lab
called her "X-23." But...

1027
00:56:22,006 --> 00:56:23,132
she was just a kid.

1028
00:56:23,924 --> 00:56:27,344
A younger, daintier,
somehow meaner version of you.

1029
00:56:27,512 --> 00:56:28,888
You died trying to save her.

1030
00:56:29,263 --> 00:56:30,097
It was beautiful.

1031
00:56:30,848 --> 00:56:33,142
Look, <i>mijo,</i> I know you're hurtin'.

1032
00:56:33,893 --> 00:56:37,522
My blind, elderly, African-American roommate,
Blind Al, always says that...

1033
00:56:37,688 --> 00:56:39,357
pain teaches us who we are.

1034
00:56:39,524 --> 00:56:42,067
Sometimes we need to listen to that pain
instead of running from it.

1035
00:56:42,235 --> 00:56:43,903
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, she's wise.

1036
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:46,447
No, no, no. That's her name?
You call her "Blind Al?"

1037
00:56:46,614 --> 00:56:47,615
Well, she's blind.

1038
00:57:25,279 --> 00:57:26,530
Look at you!

1039
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:27,698
She's coming with us.

1040
00:57:27,865 --> 00:57:29,741
- No, she's not. Fuck no!
- Oh, yes, she is.

1041
00:57:29,909 --> 00:57:31,828
- Oh, yes...
- Sorry!

1042
00:57:32,203 --> 00:57:33,579
Sorry about that!

1043
00:57:33,996 --> 00:57:35,122
Come here, girl!

1044
00:57:36,082 --> 00:57:37,291
Who are you?

1045
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:38,751
Oh, I'm Deadpool.

1046
00:57:38,918 --> 00:57:40,211
And I guess you're Deadpool too.

1047
00:57:40,377 --> 00:57:42,379
But in here, everybody calls me "Nicepool."

1048
00:57:42,797 --> 00:57:45,758
Oh, my goodness. Wait till you see Ladypool.
She is gorgeous.

1049
00:57:45,925 --> 00:57:47,302
She just had a baby too. And...

1050
00:57:48,052 --> 00:57:48,886
Can't even tell.

1051
00:57:49,053 --> 00:57:50,388
I don't think you're supposed to say that.

1052
00:57:50,555 --> 00:57:51,389
That's okay.

1053
00:57:52,056 --> 00:57:53,558
I identify as a feminist.

1054
00:57:53,725 --> 00:57:54,601
Right.

1055
00:57:56,394 --> 00:57:59,397
Are those gold-plated,
...50 caliber Desert Eagle pistoleros?

1056
00:57:59,564 --> 00:58:00,690
'Course.

1057
00:58:01,066 --> 00:58:02,234
To match my ear huggie.

1058
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,276
Can I have 'em?

1059
00:58:04,236 --> 00:58:05,570
Over my dead body.

1060
00:58:05,904 --> 00:58:06,780
You're fun.

1061
00:58:06,947 --> 00:58:11,284
And I guess you've already met Mary Puppins.
AKA Dogpool.

1062
00:58:11,451 --> 00:58:12,494
Careful where you put your hands.

1063
00:58:12,661 --> 00:58:15,497
She's ninety percent g-spot,
and she'll let you know it.

1064
00:58:15,664 --> 00:58:19,084
You let this little flirt out of your sight
for one second and...

1065
00:58:19,251 --> 00:58:21,294
she starts shopping for a new papa.

1066
00:58:21,462 --> 00:58:25,924
If you can't be a responsible pet owner, then
maybe you don't deserve this little unicorn.

1067
00:58:26,217 --> 00:58:27,885
Guilty on all charges, Your Honor.

1068
00:58:28,427 --> 00:58:29,428
Shan't happen again.

1069
00:58:29,595 --> 00:58:30,929
Why are you so nice?

1070
00:58:31,097 --> 00:58:32,473
Oh, it costs nothing to be kind.

1071
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,392
Shutting the fuck up is also free.

1072
00:58:35,059 --> 00:58:35,935
This is Logan.

1073
00:58:36,102 --> 00:58:38,855
He's usually shirtless,
but he's let himself go since the divorce.

1074
00:58:40,189 --> 00:58:41,732
Where's your mask?

1075
00:58:44,443 --> 00:58:45,278
Come on, guys.

1076
00:58:46,946 --> 00:58:48,031
Ugh, this guy.

1077
00:58:48,197 --> 00:58:49,699
We're looking for a group of survivors.

1078
00:58:49,866 --> 00:58:50,700
Oh, they're out there.

1079
00:58:50,867 --> 00:58:54,245
Yeah, but merc to merc, you better hope
that you don't run into the Deadpool corps.

1080
00:58:54,412 --> 00:58:55,371
Yeah, they're crazy.

1081
00:58:55,539 --> 00:58:58,500
They will chop you up into a thousand pieces
and hide you all over The Void.

1082
00:58:58,667 --> 00:59:00,502
If they could only process
their childhood trauma...

1083
00:59:00,669 --> 00:59:02,254
they'd go on one heck of a healing journey.

1084
00:59:02,421 --> 00:59:03,422
Look, we're headed for the borderlands.

1085
00:59:03,588 --> 00:59:04,548
You know where it is?

1086
00:59:04,839 --> 00:59:09,053
Yeah, that... That's twelve klicks due west.
I can lend you my ride, if you like.

1087
00:59:09,219 --> 00:59:10,929
It would be my honor.

1088
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:16,643
No, no, no. Absolutely not.

1089
00:59:16,811 --> 00:59:18,687
Uh-uh. What the...
No! No!

1090
00:59:18,854 --> 00:59:19,772
Just get in the car.

1091
00:59:19,939 --> 00:59:21,023
This isn't a car.

1092
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,400
This is a Honda fuckin' Odyssey.

1093
00:59:23,567 --> 00:59:25,444
Throttle response sucks a cock.

1094
00:59:25,611 --> 00:59:26,737
Dated infotainment system.

1095
00:59:26,904 --> 00:59:29,532
When Honda saw that untreated chlamydia
was makin' a comeback...

1096
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:32,493
they invented the Honda Odyssey to compete.

1097
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:35,371
Get in the fucking car.

1098
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:37,498
She'll get you there safe and sound.

1099
00:59:37,665 --> 00:59:39,124
Old Betsy always does.

1100
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,919
You're gonna have to
give me my dog back, though.

1101
00:59:42,295 --> 00:59:44,797
I know. Listen. Yes, child.

1102
00:59:44,964 --> 00:59:47,425
If you ever wanna give her up,
or if she needs a new home...

1103
00:59:47,592 --> 00:59:49,469
or if something
should happen to you...

1104
00:59:49,635 --> 00:59:50,846
I'd love to be her papa.

1105
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:53,181
What would ever happen to me?

1106
00:59:53,348 --> 00:59:54,390
Lots of stuff.

1107
00:59:58,103 --> 01:00:00,355
- Jesus.
- No! We're running away.

1108
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:03,108
- Give me that.
- The corn was too dense, girl!

1109
01:00:03,274 --> 01:00:04,109
- There.
- Come here!

1110
01:00:04,275 --> 01:00:05,527
- Fuck!
- Hello!

1111
01:00:07,821 --> 01:00:08,822
Bye.

1112
01:00:34,641 --> 01:00:35,642
Okay, I'm just gonna ask...

1113
01:00:36,017 --> 01:00:37,184
What's with the suit?

1114
01:00:37,351 --> 01:00:38,811
First thing I did when I flamed out...

1115
01:00:38,978 --> 01:00:39,979
- I took mine off.
- Drop it.

1116
01:00:40,146 --> 01:00:41,105
It's not that ugly.

1117
01:00:41,272 --> 01:00:42,857
- Stop talking about my suit.
- Did you make it yourself?

1118
01:00:43,024 --> 01:00:44,442
- Been there.
- Quit. Now.

1119
01:00:44,609 --> 01:00:47,695
The X-Men make you wear it?
Those sons of fuckin' bitches.

1120
01:00:47,862 --> 01:00:49,364
They are not your friends,
I'll tell you that.

1121
01:00:49,531 --> 01:00:50,532
Friends don't let friends...

1122
01:00:50,698 --> 01:00:53,576
leave the house lookin' like they
fight crime for the Los Angeles Rams.

1123
01:00:53,743 --> 01:00:54,827
Shut the fuck up about this, or...

1124
01:00:54,994 --> 01:00:57,205
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Watch your frown lines, angel baby.

1125
01:00:57,372 --> 01:00:59,541
- I'm just trying to bond a little bit.
- Yeah, well, then talk about somethin' else.

1126
01:00:59,707 --> 01:01:00,625
Fine.

1127
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:08,842
Stop it.

1128
01:01:10,552 --> 01:01:11,386
If they can fix your world...

1129
01:01:11,553 --> 01:01:13,180
what's the first thing you're gonna do
when you get out of here?

1130
01:01:13,346 --> 01:01:16,475
Get some rubbing alcohol shots,
maybe a wiper fluid chaser?

1131
01:01:16,642 --> 01:01:17,560
What did you say?

1132
01:01:17,726 --> 01:01:19,352
I said when you get back,
what's the first thing you're gonna do?

1133
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,854
No, no, no. Before that.

1134
01:01:22,105 --> 01:01:23,774
If... they can fix your world?

1135
01:01:27,903 --> 01:01:29,363
What do you mean, "if?"

1136
01:01:30,198 --> 01:01:31,031
- I mean...
- You lied to me.

1137
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:33,742
You don't have a fucking clue
if they can help me fix things, do you?

1138
01:01:33,909 --> 01:01:34,994
No. I, I mean...

1139
01:01:35,661 --> 01:01:38,456
Fuck! Fuck! I didn't lie!

1140
01:01:38,622 --> 01:01:41,292
- You lied!
- No! I made an educated wish!

1141
01:01:43,169 --> 01:01:44,128
Because I need you.

1142
01:01:45,463 --> 01:01:48,466
This. This is why. Right here.

1143
01:01:49,508 --> 01:01:51,010
'Cause if we don't do something, they die.

1144
01:01:51,427 --> 01:01:53,346
I don't know anything about saving worlds.

1145
01:01:53,513 --> 01:01:55,056
And why would I even care?

1146
01:01:55,223 --> 01:01:58,142
Because my entire world
is right here in this picture.

1147
01:01:58,602 --> 01:02:00,604
It's only nine people...

1148
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:02,814
and I have no idea how to save it alone.

1149
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:06,025
I know how to fuck people up for money.
But you...

1150
01:02:06,193 --> 01:02:07,777
you know how to save 'em!

1151
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:10,239
At least the other Wolverine did.

1152
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:13,909
Fuck! I guess I'm stuck with the worst one.

1153
01:02:14,076 --> 01:02:16,328
Did you say you made...

1154
01:02:16,495 --> 01:02:19,790
an educated fucking wish?

1155
01:02:19,957 --> 01:02:22,084
They call me "The Merc with the Mouth."

1156
01:02:22,251 --> 01:02:26,130
They don't call me "Truthful Timmy,
the Blowjob Queen of Saskatoon."

1157
01:02:30,009 --> 01:02:30,926
One more word.

1158
01:02:32,219 --> 01:02:33,679
Please give me one.

1159
01:02:37,308 --> 01:02:38,476
Gubernatorial.

1160
01:02:39,227 --> 01:02:40,228
Oh, fuck!

1161
01:02:41,854 --> 01:02:43,273
You know what? You're a fucking joke.

1162
01:02:45,066 --> 01:02:46,484
No wonder the Avengers didn't take you.

1163
01:02:46,651 --> 01:02:48,778
Or the X-Men.
And they'll take fucking anyone.

1164
01:02:49,279 --> 01:02:50,655
I mean, you are...

1165
01:02:50,821 --> 01:02:54,367
a ridiculous, immature, half-wit moron.

1166
01:02:54,993 --> 01:02:56,703
I have never met...

1167
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:58,079
a sadder...

1168
01:02:58,246 --> 01:03:00,624
more attention-starved,
jabbering little prick...

1169
01:03:00,791 --> 01:03:04,210
in my entire life. And that says a lot,
'cause I've been alive...

1170
01:03:04,377 --> 01:03:08,214
for more than two hundred fuckin' years,
and I'll tell you...

1171
01:03:08,382 --> 01:03:12,594
that bald chick was right about one thing.
You will never save the world!

1172
01:03:12,761 --> 01:03:15,264
You couldn't even save a relationship...

1173
01:03:15,431 --> 01:03:17,308
with a goddamn stripper!

1174
01:03:17,474 --> 01:03:19,935
And motherfucker,
I wish I could say you'd die alone...

1175
01:03:20,102 --> 01:03:23,022
but it's one of God's best jokes
that you can't die...

1176
01:03:23,189 --> 01:03:24,690
except that's on all of us!

1177
01:03:28,778 --> 01:03:31,238
Oh, you got nothing to say, Mouth?

1178
01:03:39,914 --> 01:03:41,583
I'm gonna fight you now.

1179
01:03:43,793 --> 01:03:45,044
Oh, are you?

1180
01:03:55,763 --> 01:03:57,765
Mm. Not talkin' now, are ya?

1181
01:04:04,439 --> 01:04:05,482
You dirty bitch.

1182
01:04:21,206 --> 01:04:22,040
Whoo!

1183
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:39,851
No, no, no!

1184
01:04:58,703 --> 01:04:59,538
Baby Knife!

1185
01:05:03,292 --> 01:05:06,378
I take it all back.
The Honda Odyssey fucks hard.

1186
01:05:06,795 --> 01:05:08,255
Too bad you don't, needle dick.

1187
01:05:08,422 --> 01:05:09,631
Oh, we're just gettin' started, bub.

1188
01:05:14,219 --> 01:05:15,470
Oh, you... Fuck!

1189
01:06:08,442 --> 01:06:09,275
Thor!

1190
01:06:12,363 --> 01:06:13,280
Where are we?

1191
01:06:13,447 --> 01:06:16,074
No clue, but... I like it here.

1192
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,085
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1193
01:07:15,177 --> 01:07:16,094
Okay.

1194
01:07:17,012 --> 01:07:19,848
Look at you... all. You must be the others.

1195
01:07:20,558 --> 01:07:21,392
Terrific.

1196
01:07:21,725 --> 01:07:25,062
So just to refresh, you are...

1197
01:07:25,229 --> 01:07:27,606
- Wonder... Elektra? Yes. Who could forget?
- Elektra.

1198
01:07:28,441 --> 01:07:33,154
And you. I was not expecting to see you here.
I thought you were, you know...

1199
01:07:33,321 --> 01:07:34,280
retired.

1200
01:07:35,531 --> 01:07:36,365
Retarded?

1201
01:07:37,867 --> 01:07:38,827
"Retired."

1202
01:07:38,993 --> 01:07:41,204
I'm already in The Void.
I'm not trying to get canceled again.

1203
01:07:41,370 --> 01:07:42,121
I don't like you.

1204
01:07:42,288 --> 01:07:43,122
You never did.

1205
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:48,545
And who's this succulent reminder
of my own inadequacies?

1206
01:07:48,712 --> 01:07:49,796
Look at you.

1207
01:07:50,463 --> 01:07:52,549
You look like the
superhero version of Hawkeye.

1208
01:07:53,174 --> 01:07:55,969
The name's Remy LeBeau, <i>Le Diable Blanc.</i>

1209
01:07:56,678 --> 01:07:57,637
But you can call me the Gambit.

1210
01:07:57,804 --> 01:08:00,557
It's been a while since I've seen
<i>Sling Blade</i>. Hit me again.

1211
01:08:01,641 --> 01:08:02,601
They call me the Gambit.

1212
01:08:02,767 --> 01:08:05,229
Do they? Are you sure you didn't just
really, really want them to...

1213
01:08:05,395 --> 01:08:06,521
but it never quite worked out?

1214
01:08:09,399 --> 01:08:11,693
You know,
we never had a Wolverine up in here.

1215
01:08:12,486 --> 01:08:15,447
But I can tell you now,
it's just a common courtesy to ask...

1216
01:08:15,614 --> 01:08:17,282
before you drink up all of my liquor.

1217
01:08:17,574 --> 01:08:19,618
Well, it's a good thing I don't give a fuck.

1218
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:23,663
Fuck.

1219
01:08:26,791 --> 01:08:27,917
So embarrassing.

1220
01:08:30,129 --> 01:08:32,797
Well, now that that's settled, look,
we came a long way to find you three.

1221
01:08:32,965 --> 01:08:33,758
There's four of us.

1222
01:08:33,923 --> 01:08:35,800
There's four... Hey, wait. Is it Magneto?

1223
01:08:36,636 --> 01:08:38,971
Dear sweet God in heaven,
let it be Magneto...

1224
01:08:39,139 --> 01:08:40,014
- because with him...
- He's dead.

1225
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:42,057
Fuck!
Now Disney gets cheap?

1226
01:08:42,225 --> 01:08:45,353
It's like Pinocchio jammed his face in my ass
and started lying like crazy.

1227
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,604
Ooh, you nasty!

1228
01:08:48,773 --> 01:08:51,484
Not a single word. What do you do exactly?

1229
01:08:51,651 --> 01:08:54,237
Charge the playing cards
and make 'em go boom!

1230
01:08:54,404 --> 01:08:56,364
Your power's close up magic. That's good.

1231
01:08:56,531 --> 01:08:57,948
We're not totally fucked at all.

1232
01:08:58,116 --> 01:08:59,618
So who brought us here?

1233
01:08:59,785 --> 01:09:00,701
That would be me.

1234
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:11,880
Don't make me regret it.

1235
01:09:14,132 --> 01:09:17,052
Holy shit. Logan. That's her.
That's X-23.

1236
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:19,055
She's the one I told you about.

1237
01:09:23,599 --> 01:09:25,686
Hey, how did you all get stuck in The Void?

1238
01:09:25,852 --> 01:09:27,228
There was a knock at the door.

1239
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:29,315
- TVA sent me here.
- Me, too.

1240
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,650
Well, maybe I was born here.
It's, it's hard to know for sure.

1241
01:09:31,983 --> 01:09:34,195
TVA decided our universe was dying.

1242
01:09:35,486 --> 01:09:37,363
And I never even got a chance
to fight for it.

1243
01:09:40,201 --> 01:09:42,286
People like us don't go quietly.

1244
01:09:42,454 --> 01:09:44,288
TVA knows that, so they took us out.

1245
01:09:44,996 --> 01:09:46,998
The answer is yes. I'm in.

1246
01:09:47,166 --> 01:09:48,585
- In what?
- A team.

1247
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:51,128
Me, you, you, and me. All of us together.

1248
01:09:51,296 --> 01:09:52,379
Let's get the fuck out of this place.

1249
01:09:52,547 --> 01:09:55,967
- Don't listen to him. He's a fucking liar!
- It was an educated wish!

1250
01:09:57,009 --> 01:09:57,844
Look.

1251
01:09:59,387 --> 01:10:01,056
We've been inside Cassandra's lair.

1252
01:10:01,389 --> 01:10:03,934
The only way out of The Void
is through her.

1253
01:10:04,101 --> 01:10:05,853
She can get us home. She told us.

1254
01:10:06,019 --> 01:10:07,562
Wait a minute, you've been inside?

1255
01:10:08,355 --> 01:10:10,148
- And you made it out alive?
- Bullshit.

1256
01:10:10,315 --> 01:10:11,900
- Nobody's ever done that.
- We did.

1257
01:10:12,067 --> 01:10:14,319
Every time one of us
has gone up against her...

1258
01:10:14,737 --> 01:10:15,571
they die.

1259
01:10:16,029 --> 01:10:18,741
The Punisher, The Quicksilver, The Daredevil.

1260
01:10:18,907 --> 01:10:20,242
Daredevil? I'm so sorry.

1261
01:10:20,409 --> 01:10:21,577
- It's fine.
- Okay.

1262
01:10:23,871 --> 01:10:26,332
Even that sweet, baby angel, Johnny Storm.

1263
01:10:27,082 --> 01:10:28,626
He up and gone missing like...

1264
01:10:28,917 --> 01:10:29,918
what, two days ago?

1265
01:10:30,628 --> 01:10:32,338
Ugh. That's so sad.

1266
01:10:33,047 --> 01:10:35,799
Wherever this Johnny fella is,
I'm sure he's thriving.

1267
01:10:36,968 --> 01:10:40,054
Look, there's, there's strength in numbers.
All right? Us...

1268
01:10:40,221 --> 01:10:41,597
plus, you guys. We can put Cassandra...

1269
01:10:41,765 --> 01:10:43,892
over our knee and force her
to let us out of The Void.

1270
01:10:44,058 --> 01:10:45,644
I know what it means to feel self-doubt.

1271
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:47,228
- I don't feel that at all.
- I'm good.

1272
01:10:47,395 --> 01:10:49,313
Gnawing at your gut like a coked-up tapeworm.

1273
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,149
It's like you're
holding up a mirror to my soul.

1274
01:10:51,315 --> 01:10:53,943
You guys may not have been able to
save your universes.

1275
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:55,570
But you can avenge them.

1276
01:10:56,363 --> 01:10:57,739
It's what Johnny would have wanted.

1277
01:10:57,906 --> 01:11:00,575
Wait. You knew Johnny?

1278
01:11:01,576 --> 01:11:02,744
Oh, yeah.

1279
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:04,746
Dickhead here talked him into a team up...

1280
01:11:04,913 --> 01:11:07,291
and Johnny came down
with a little case of the deads.

1281
01:11:07,457 --> 01:11:08,708
No, no, no. We don't know that.

1282
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:11,003
It was just a flesh wound.
He may have survived.

1283
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:13,755
If he survived that, he is prayin' for death.

1284
01:11:13,923 --> 01:11:16,216
- Thank you, Doctor Wolverine!
- Spill it!

1285
01:11:16,383 --> 01:11:17,592
What'd you do to Johnny, huh?

1286
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:18,969
Talk or I'm gonna start dealin'.

1287
01:11:19,136 --> 01:11:20,345
Okay. Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

1288
01:11:21,013 --> 01:11:21,847
Look.

1289
01:11:22,014 --> 01:11:24,308
He ran his fat-ass mouth about Cassandra.

1290
01:11:24,474 --> 01:11:26,185
Then she zip-zapped his skin...

1291
01:11:26,351 --> 01:11:28,395
leaving his organs to
splash crudely onto the ground...

1292
01:11:28,563 --> 01:11:31,106
while the soil greedily drank his blood.
It was horrible.

1293
01:11:31,273 --> 01:11:32,608
He was like a brother to me.

1294
01:11:33,233 --> 01:11:36,237
Look, he died
before he could make a difference. But...

1295
01:11:36,404 --> 01:11:38,739
Look, maybe you couldn't save your worlds,
but...

1296
01:11:38,906 --> 01:11:41,451
but Jesus Christ, you can save mine!

1297
01:11:41,617 --> 01:11:44,079
I don't give a shit about your world, but...

1298
01:11:44,245 --> 01:11:47,165
if these two made it out of there alive,
maybe together...

1299
01:11:47,332 --> 01:11:48,959
we can get back in.
And take her down.

1300
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:51,669
Where I come from,
we call that suicide, <i>Chère.</i>

1301
01:11:52,128 --> 01:11:55,841
If we can block her psychic powers,
we can get a leg up. I know it.

1302
01:11:56,007 --> 01:11:57,550
Now I know Magneto's dead.

1303
01:11:58,093 --> 01:12:00,011
But I'd venture to guess that his helmet...

1304
01:12:00,178 --> 01:12:02,556
- is lying around here somewhere...
- Cassandra melted the helmet.

1305
01:12:02,723 --> 01:12:03,849
- Fuck!
- After she killed him.

1306
01:12:04,015 --> 01:12:04,933
Fuck!

1307
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:05,892
She don't play.

1308
01:12:06,059 --> 01:12:08,979
She knows that helmet was the only way
to protect anyone from her powers.

1309
01:12:09,145 --> 01:12:11,482
The only other helmet that strong is
Juggernaut's, but...

1310
01:12:11,648 --> 01:12:13,734
- he works for Cassandra.
- Juggernaut's helmet. That's it.

1311
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:15,444
Yeah, and we done be knowing
that lid ain't comin' off...

1312
01:12:15,611 --> 01:12:17,904
- without that dome gonna come off wit'it.
- I'm so sorry, beautiful.

1313
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:21,408
I want this to be gentle.
Who is your dialect coach? The Minions?

1314
01:12:21,575 --> 01:12:24,411
I feel like
we are missing critical exposition here.

1315
01:12:25,913 --> 01:12:28,624
I'm sick of this shit.
I'm sick of hiding.

1316
01:12:29,917 --> 01:12:31,836
Let's face it, our worlds forgot about us.

1317
01:12:32,003 --> 01:12:33,630
Or never learned about us.

1318
01:12:33,796 --> 01:12:35,089
The heroes we were.

1319
01:12:35,256 --> 01:12:36,382
Lives we saved.

1320
01:12:36,549 --> 01:12:38,009
Or wanted to save.

1321
01:12:38,175 --> 01:12:39,844
Maybe these two are our chance.

1322
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:42,555
To be remembered.

1323
01:12:43,014 --> 01:12:44,098
The way we deserve.

1324
01:12:45,266 --> 01:12:46,225
Yes.

1325
01:12:46,393 --> 01:12:47,310
An ending.

1326
01:12:48,185 --> 01:12:49,312
- Legacy.
- Yes!

1327
01:12:49,479 --> 01:12:51,063
Yes! Let this man cook.

1328
01:12:51,231 --> 01:12:52,482
This is what I'm talking about.

1329
01:12:52,649 --> 01:12:54,484
Big slow-motion fights, sad music.

1330
01:12:54,651 --> 01:12:57,612
Everybody working together. Who knows if you
live or die? That sorta thing.

1331
01:12:57,779 --> 01:12:59,781
- Who's ready?
- I was born ready.

1332
01:12:59,948 --> 01:13:00,949
Yes!
Gambit?

1333
01:13:01,116 --> 01:13:04,036
I ain't know my daddy,
but I'm sure I shot out of his dick ready.

1334
01:13:04,202 --> 01:13:05,954
Jesus Christ, that is graphic.

1335
01:13:06,121 --> 01:13:07,998
Yeah. He was layin' them buttery nuts
all up in my mama...

1336
01:13:08,165 --> 01:13:09,958
and I shot out there and I said,
"What's up, Doc?"

1337
01:13:10,793 --> 01:13:14,004
Johnny must have loved you.
X-23, what's it gonna be?

1338
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:15,881
The name's Laura.

1339
01:13:16,048 --> 01:13:18,926
- Let's fucking go.
- Let's fucking go!

1340
01:13:19,092 --> 01:13:20,719
- It's on like chicken and corn.
- Yeah!

1341
01:13:20,886 --> 01:13:22,805
- We're doing this.
- You're all fuckin' dead.

1342
01:13:22,971 --> 01:13:25,015
My God! Read the room.

1343
01:13:36,152 --> 01:13:39,072
Hey, hey. I'm not lookin' for company.
Get out of here.

1344
01:13:41,282 --> 01:13:42,325
You remind me of him.

1345
01:13:42,951 --> 01:13:44,410
Angry. Drunk. Mean...

1346
01:13:44,786 --> 01:13:46,746
- Sounds like a great guy...
- Wasn't finished.

1347
01:13:48,748 --> 01:13:50,249
Showed up when it mattered the most.

1348
01:13:52,544 --> 01:13:54,128
Couldn't help it.

1349
01:13:57,549 --> 01:13:58,508
You might not know it, but...

1350
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:01,094
you're a good man, Logan.

1351
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:06,141
You might not know it, but apparently,
I'm the worst Logan.

1352
01:14:08,352 --> 01:14:09,979
I got to have a life because of you.

1353
01:14:13,107 --> 01:14:14,524
I got to grow up because of you.

1354
01:14:16,777 --> 01:14:17,862
A lot of kids did.

1355
01:14:18,528 --> 01:14:20,447
A lot of kids didn't grow up because of me.

1356
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:24,201
Trust me, kid, I'm no hero.

1357
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:27,079
That suit says different.

1358
01:14:27,747 --> 01:14:28,998
Yeah. Do you like it?

1359
01:14:31,751 --> 01:14:33,378
Scott used to beg me to wear it.

1360
01:14:35,713 --> 01:14:38,216
So did Jean, Storm, Beast.

1361
01:14:40,343 --> 01:14:41,344
All of them.

1362
01:14:42,637 --> 01:14:45,848
They wanted me to be part of the team,
but I wouldn't.

1363
01:14:46,349 --> 01:14:49,477
Told 'em they all look fucking ridiculous.
I mean...

1364
01:14:51,521 --> 01:14:53,982
I couldn't have 'em thinkin'
I wanted to be there.

1365
01:14:59,821 --> 01:15:02,824
And then one day, while I was off on my own,
the humans came...

1366
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:04,993
and went mutant hunting.

1367
01:15:06,327 --> 01:15:07,413
I can guess the rest.

1368
01:15:07,579 --> 01:15:08,414
No, no, let me...

1369
01:15:10,123 --> 01:15:11,082
Let me say it. I...

1370
01:15:13,877 --> 01:15:14,836
I need to say it.

1371
01:15:17,714 --> 01:15:20,842
By the time I stumbled home
shitfaced from the bar, it was too late.

1372
01:15:25,472 --> 01:15:26,473
They were dead. Every...

1373
01:15:33,189 --> 01:15:36,150
This suit's all I got to remind me of
who they were.

1374
01:15:38,152 --> 01:15:39,028
And what I did.

1375
01:15:52,334 --> 01:15:53,793
We're headed to Cassandra's at sunup.

1376
01:15:54,836 --> 01:15:56,629
Have fun. Not my fight.

1377
01:16:00,133 --> 01:16:01,509
We won't pull this off without you.

1378
01:16:08,809 --> 01:16:11,937
Hey. Whoever you think I am,
you got the wrong guy.

1379
01:16:14,898 --> 01:16:16,024
You were always the wrong guy.

1380
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:43,094
What?

1381
01:16:43,261 --> 01:16:44,721
Alioth didn't get them.

1382
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,891
Cassandra wanted to
play with them herself first.

1383
01:16:48,057 --> 01:16:48,892
<i>They got away.</i>

1384
01:16:49,058 --> 01:16:50,685
- Did they find the others?
- No.

1385
01:16:50,852 --> 01:16:52,061
Good. All right. Phew.

1386
01:16:52,228 --> 01:16:53,271
<i>The others found them.</i>

1387
01:16:53,438 --> 01:16:56,065
Oh, very cute. Well done, Pyro.
Classic bait and switch.

1388
01:16:56,232 --> 01:16:57,692
- <i>You really got me there.</i>
- Relax.

1389
01:16:58,652 --> 01:17:00,945
If they come after Nova, she'll handle it.

1390
01:17:01,112 --> 01:17:03,157
Cassandra is a lunatic wild card.

1391
01:17:03,323 --> 01:17:04,949
Why do you think we put her there
in the first place?

1392
01:17:05,534 --> 01:17:07,494
Thank God she's never chosen
to leave The Void.

1393
01:17:07,661 --> 01:17:10,205
The Time Ripper is hours away
from completion.

1394
01:17:10,372 --> 01:17:11,498
I cannot take any chances.

1395
01:17:11,665 --> 01:17:12,707
Well, maybe not.

1396
01:17:12,875 --> 01:17:13,959
<i>But I can.</i>

1397
01:17:14,126 --> 01:17:15,085
For a price.

1398
01:17:15,252 --> 01:17:16,711
<i>Why do you have to
say it in that silly voice?</i>

1399
01:17:16,879 --> 01:17:17,963
It's so icky.

1400
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:18,964
<i>You want it done or not?</i>

1401
01:17:19,131 --> 01:17:19,965
All right. Your price.

1402
01:17:20,132 --> 01:17:21,383
<i>Take her out.</i>

1403
01:17:22,051 --> 01:17:23,594
Ugh. Mutants.

1404
01:17:45,825 --> 01:17:46,910
Ooh! Look at that there!

1405
01:17:47,077 --> 01:17:49,787
You see them biggum hands come closed.
Ain't not a wonna gettin' up inside there.

1406
01:17:49,955 --> 01:17:51,206
I think what Gambit's
trying to say is...

1407
01:17:51,372 --> 01:17:54,084
getting Juggernaut's helmet
ain't gonna be easy.

1408
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:55,877
I'm just making stuff up at this...

1409
01:17:56,044 --> 01:17:57,754
- Yeah. Tilt up to Blade.
- Gun!

1410
01:18:02,509 --> 01:18:03,719
Where'd he get that little beauty?

1411
01:18:04,177 --> 01:18:06,262
That's Punisher's AT4.

1412
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:08,432
Which Punisher?
There's been like five of them.

1413
01:18:08,599 --> 01:18:09,891
There's only been one Blade...

1414
01:18:10,476 --> 01:18:12,394
and there's only ever gonna be one Blade.

1415
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:17,608
Incoming!

1416
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:26,554
Ooh, this is gonna be good.

1417
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,972
You know how long I've been waiting for this?

1418
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:31,309
Whoo!
I'm about to make a name for myself here.

1419
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:33,311
I don't think you guys walk away from this.

1420
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:35,479
You just make sure
people know what happened here today.

1421
01:19:35,646 --> 01:19:37,606
And when you get out of here,
you have a drink for me, yeah?

1422
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:40,109
You just stay on our six and get inside.

1423
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:42,195
We'll make sure you get the package.

1424
01:19:42,696 --> 01:19:43,988
And we'll get our ending.

1425
01:20:54,185 --> 01:20:55,228
And boom!

1426
01:21:26,969 --> 01:21:29,096
Some motherfuckers still trying
to ice skate uphill.

1427
01:21:36,145 --> 01:21:38,064
You two escaping, I could live with.

1428
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:41,108
But coming back? Willingly?

1429
01:21:42,735 --> 01:21:44,487
Boys are so silly.

1430
01:21:44,654 --> 01:21:45,780
I just need to get home.

1431
01:21:45,947 --> 01:21:48,241
Well, that's not on the menu, I'm afraid.

1432
01:21:48,408 --> 01:21:51,661
It's death or enslavement.
À la carte, of course.

1433
01:21:51,828 --> 01:21:52,829
Upsy-daisy.

1434
01:21:58,668 --> 01:21:59,544
Finally...

1435
01:21:59,711 --> 01:22:01,588
it's nice to give someone else
a chance to talk.

1436
01:22:01,754 --> 01:22:03,173
Not my strong suit.

1437
01:22:21,484 --> 01:22:22,693
You shouldn't have done that.

1438
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:48,720
You are an interesting one, aren't you?

1439
01:22:49,303 --> 01:22:53,266
I do feel like
you get lost behind all of his...

1440
01:22:55,602 --> 01:22:58,104
Deadpools are
a dime a dozen here in The Void.

1441
01:22:59,063 --> 01:23:00,440
But you...

1442
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:03,943
What's going on in here?

1443
01:23:17,499 --> 01:23:18,625
Interesting...

1444
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:21,712
Not what I expected back here.

1445
01:23:22,797 --> 01:23:24,006
Behind the anger.

1446
01:23:28,135 --> 01:23:29,053
You're hiding.

1447
01:23:29,387 --> 01:23:30,220
From them.

1448
01:23:31,431 --> 01:23:33,098
From all the ones you let down.

1449
01:23:35,768 --> 01:23:36,977
So much pain.

1450
01:23:39,564 --> 01:23:40,440
I walked away.

1451
01:23:41,857 --> 01:23:43,401
They called after me and I...

1452
01:23:43,568 --> 01:23:45,361
I walked away.

1453
01:23:45,528 --> 01:23:47,155
I always do.

1454
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:49,032
- <i>Logan!</i>
- I know.

1455
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:51,743
That's not all you did.

1456
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:53,328
Is it?

1457
01:23:56,873 --> 01:23:58,249
You found them.

1458
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:00,251
The X-Men.

1459
01:24:05,674 --> 01:24:06,675
Dead.

1460
01:24:09,428 --> 01:24:10,637
Piled like wood.

1461
01:24:12,348 --> 01:24:13,515
<i>What did you do?</i>

1462
01:24:16,227 --> 01:24:17,436
I started killing.

1463
01:24:18,229 --> 01:24:20,731
And I couldn't stop. I didn't wanna stop.

1464
01:24:22,024 --> 01:24:24,861
<i>All those bad men.</i>

1465
01:24:28,614 --> 01:24:30,199
It's not just the bad ones.

1466
01:24:31,868 --> 01:24:33,035
My little animal.

1467
01:24:35,913 --> 01:24:38,708
And I turned the whole world
against the X-Men.

1468
01:24:39,083 --> 01:24:40,084
Blade!

1469
01:24:45,673 --> 01:24:46,883
Just once...

1470
01:24:48,843 --> 01:24:51,388
I wanna be the man
that Charles thought I was.

1471
01:24:52,597 --> 01:24:53,723
Logan...

1472
01:24:55,308 --> 01:24:58,979
in The Void you can be what you are.

1473
01:25:01,398 --> 01:25:02,858
I just wanna be free.

1474
01:25:03,650 --> 01:25:05,110
I can set you free.

1475
01:25:16,747 --> 01:25:21,877
I can silence all those voices.

1476
01:25:28,717 --> 01:25:29,718
I've got you.

1477
01:25:32,346 --> 01:25:33,347
I've got you.

1478
01:25:34,098 --> 01:25:34,933
No.

1479
01:25:36,392 --> 01:25:37,435
I got you.

1480
01:25:46,110 --> 01:25:47,737
Get it off!

1481
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:51,032
You're gonna send us home,
or I'm gonna twist your fucking head off.

1482
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:52,283
Why are you laughing?

1483
01:25:52,951 --> 01:25:56,746
I can't send you home
unless you get this thing off my head.

1484
01:25:57,331 --> 01:25:58,457
And as soon as you do that...

1485
01:25:58,623 --> 01:26:01,501
I'm going to boil your brains
on an atomic level whilst...

1486
01:26:01,668 --> 01:26:04,254
flicking my bean to the Enya box set.

1487
01:26:04,421 --> 01:26:05,464
There's an Enya box set?

1488
01:26:05,630 --> 01:26:06,881
Either you kill me...

1489
01:26:07,049 --> 01:26:08,175
or I kill you.

1490
01:26:09,259 --> 01:26:10,802
Both wonderful options.

1491
01:26:11,345 --> 01:26:12,179
You want me to do it?

1492
01:26:12,637 --> 01:26:13,513
No, I'll do it.

1493
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:15,725
I have her neck right here.
It's really no problem.

1494
01:26:15,891 --> 01:26:16,600
You'll screw it up.

1495
01:26:16,767 --> 01:26:19,311
Oh, come on, Mr. PG-13,
except the last one!

1496
01:26:20,187 --> 01:26:21,271
What the fuck?

1497
01:26:23,608 --> 01:26:25,860
You have no idea what it's like!

1498
01:26:26,026 --> 01:26:28,946
Day after day. Shovel the shit.

1499
01:26:29,113 --> 01:26:30,448
Fetch the meats.

1500
01:26:30,615 --> 01:26:32,575
I have spent my entire...

1501
01:26:35,578 --> 01:26:37,079
Not everyone gets a speech.

1502
01:26:39,039 --> 01:26:40,041
She's gonna die.

1503
01:26:40,208 --> 01:26:41,667
Okay. Hey, hey. If I take this helmet off...

1504
01:26:41,834 --> 01:26:43,628
- do you promise you won't kill us?
- Fuck!

1505
01:26:43,794 --> 01:26:44,629
I promise...

1506
01:26:44,795 --> 01:26:46,589
I will kill you first thing.

1507
01:26:46,756 --> 01:26:48,008
Why are you like this?

1508
01:26:48,174 --> 01:26:49,425
I wish I knew.

1509
01:26:49,592 --> 01:26:50,468
Take it off.

1510
01:26:50,635 --> 01:26:51,511
- What?
- Take it off.

1511
01:26:51,677 --> 01:26:52,512
- Why?
- Just take it off.

1512
01:26:52,679 --> 01:26:55,431
- This is our only chance to fix our shit!
- Take it off!

1513
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:58,602
I am wearing this suit.

1514
01:26:59,811 --> 01:27:01,938
And that means a lot of things,
but most of all...

1515
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,566
it means I'm an X-Man.

1516
01:27:05,692 --> 01:27:07,110
And I know your brother.

1517
01:27:09,446 --> 01:27:10,947
As much as I want to fucking kill you...

1518
01:27:11,114 --> 01:27:13,617
every bone in my body
wants to fucking kill you...

1519
01:27:13,784 --> 01:27:16,787
he would not let me stand here
and watch you die!

1520
01:27:19,248 --> 01:27:20,457
Take your hands off.

1521
01:27:22,126 --> 01:27:23,377
This is for him.

1522
01:27:25,296 --> 01:27:26,547
This is for Charles.

1523
01:27:37,183 --> 01:27:39,811
Hey, no, no, no!
Don't you dare do me like Johnny!

1524
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:47,235
My brother loved you.

1525
01:27:49,112 --> 01:27:50,197
He loved all of us.

1526
01:27:53,283 --> 01:27:54,367
Must be nice.

1527
01:27:55,493 --> 01:27:56,786
He would've loved you, too.

1528
01:27:59,664 --> 01:28:00,833
If he knew about you...

1529
01:28:02,625 --> 01:28:04,127
if he knew where you were...

1530
01:28:04,294 --> 01:28:07,339
he would've torn a hole in the fucking
universe to bring you home.

1531
01:28:11,176 --> 01:28:12,260
This is my home.

1532
01:28:13,345 --> 01:28:15,598
Well, then at least let us save his.

1533
01:28:19,768 --> 01:28:21,270
You want to hear something crazy?

1534
01:28:23,231 --> 01:28:26,109
An amateur magician
rolled through here a while back.

1535
01:28:27,025 --> 01:28:28,486
I killed him, of course.

1536
01:28:29,195 --> 01:28:31,447
Wore his skin around for four days.

1537
01:28:32,490 --> 01:28:33,324
But...

1538
01:28:33,491 --> 01:28:34,909
I found this...

1539
01:28:35,076 --> 01:28:36,911
little trinket...

1540
01:28:37,078 --> 01:28:39,205
on his lovely fingers.

1541
01:28:39,372 --> 01:28:40,539
Strange!

1542
01:28:43,627 --> 01:28:45,754
- Marvel sparkle circle.
- What is that?

1543
01:28:46,671 --> 01:28:48,590
This is your way home.

1544
01:28:48,757 --> 01:28:52,218
I do owe you for saving my life.
But let's keep things interesting.

1545
01:28:52,386 --> 01:28:55,680
I'd say you have about four seconds
before you're Alioth's food.

1546
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:01,395
Race ya.

1547
01:30:25,064 --> 01:30:26,648
{\an8}And as I said
we've got a standard three-year...

1548
01:30:26,816 --> 01:30:28,109
{\an8}bumper to bumper warranty.

1549
01:30:28,275 --> 01:30:30,027
Glad you gave us a second chance.

1550
01:30:30,194 --> 01:30:33,740
And don't worry. Wade and I are a team,
so I'll see he gets half the commission...

1551
01:30:36,325 --> 01:30:38,536
That feels like a Kia.

1552
01:30:38,703 --> 01:30:40,330
It's a fucking Kia Carnival, isn't it?

1553
01:30:42,206 --> 01:30:45,042
Holy shit. That's Deadpool.

1554
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:46,336
And that's Wolverine.

1555
01:30:46,503 --> 01:30:47,587
You're damn straight it is.

1556
01:30:47,754 --> 01:30:48,671
Fox killed him.

1557
01:30:48,838 --> 01:30:51,383
Disney brought him back. They're going
to make him do this 'til he's 90.

1558
01:30:51,924 --> 01:30:52,884
Let's go.

1559
01:30:53,676 --> 01:30:54,761
I'll clock you out!

1560
01:30:55,137 --> 01:30:56,346
Forever!

1561
01:30:57,055 --> 01:30:58,056
Forever.

1562
01:31:05,438 --> 01:31:06,649
Wakey-wakey.

1563
01:31:06,815 --> 01:31:07,816
God?

1564
01:31:09,568 --> 01:31:12,279
Now you put all these bullets in my belly...

1565
01:31:12,988 --> 01:31:14,532
and I'm gonna find out why.

1566
01:31:16,950 --> 01:31:18,327
I'll just say it.

1567
01:31:19,036 --> 01:31:20,829
You don't have to stick your fingers in me.

1568
01:31:20,996 --> 01:31:23,249
Jesus, just ask sometimes.

1569
01:31:23,624 --> 01:31:24,667
Fine.

1570
01:31:25,876 --> 01:31:26,877
Really?

1571
01:31:27,545 --> 01:31:28,796
Hands in pockets.

1572
01:31:30,339 --> 01:31:31,507
Guy named Paradox.

1573
01:31:32,425 --> 01:31:33,676
He said he'd get me out of The Void.

1574
01:31:33,843 --> 01:31:35,636
All I know is he works for the TVA.

1575
01:31:35,804 --> 01:31:36,805
The TVA.

1576
01:31:36,971 --> 01:31:38,014
We had an agreement.

1577
01:31:38,306 --> 01:31:39,849
I don't think this guy cares.

1578
01:31:41,142 --> 01:31:42,185
He will.

1579
01:31:42,686 --> 01:31:43,728
Hey, people!

1580
01:31:44,062 --> 01:31:46,189
How much longer
before the Time Ripper is active?

1581
01:31:46,355 --> 01:31:48,191
We're running the final safety checks.

1582
01:31:48,357 --> 01:31:50,318
Okay. All right.
Thanks for all your hard work, Ralph.

1583
01:31:50,485 --> 01:31:51,861
- Take your time.
- Really?

1584
01:31:52,028 --> 01:31:53,572
No, you drooling boob!

1585
01:31:53,738 --> 01:31:54,823
No! We have company.

1586
01:31:54,989 --> 01:31:57,992
Cancel the safety checks.
We need to be live now!

1587
01:31:58,327 --> 01:31:59,786
I hate you so much.

1588
01:32:01,996 --> 01:32:02,997
No! Stop!

1589
01:32:03,165 --> 01:32:04,749
Piss off! You're too late.

1590
01:32:04,916 --> 01:32:06,668
- You're fuckin' done.
- Why was Thor crying?

1591
01:32:06,835 --> 01:32:07,836
How dare you!

1592
01:32:08,003 --> 01:32:10,172
No one comes back from The Void.

1593
01:32:10,339 --> 01:32:11,799
Tell that to Cassandra Nova.

1594
01:32:20,641 --> 01:32:22,434
Paradox.
We have a problem.

1595
01:32:25,521 --> 01:32:26,731
Paradox.

1596
01:32:29,066 --> 01:32:31,527
Well, you are doughier than
you looked in Pyro's head.

1597
01:32:31,694 --> 01:32:32,862
You tried to kill me.

1598
01:32:33,028 --> 01:32:34,029
I literally have no...

1599
01:32:34,989 --> 01:32:38,659
<i>You come for the king,
you better kill the king.</i>

1600
01:32:39,577 --> 01:32:41,955
Welcome to the skull fuck club, Paradox.

1601
01:32:42,122 --> 01:32:44,249
You know she doesn't wash that hand.

1602
01:32:46,001 --> 01:32:47,127
What's this?

1603
01:32:48,461 --> 01:32:49,796
A Time Ripper?

1604
01:32:49,963 --> 01:32:51,673
- Naughty boy.
- Oh, no. We're on it.

1605
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,466
We're gonna head down
and dismantle that thing now.

1606
01:32:53,634 --> 01:32:55,927
We got ya, boo.
You just keep playing those keys.

1607
01:32:56,094 --> 01:32:57,596
I don't want to destroy it.

1608
01:32:58,263 --> 01:32:59,598
I want to use it.

1609
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:02,643
Now, shoo.
Mummy and Daddy are having a conversation.

1610
01:33:09,358 --> 01:33:11,152
You know, the funny thing is...

1611
01:33:11,318 --> 01:33:12,778
I was happy in The Void.

1612
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:16,740
You sent your trash to me.
Alioth and I cleaned it up.

1613
01:33:16,907 --> 01:33:18,867
Everyone was happy.

1614
01:33:19,743 --> 01:33:22,830
And then you had to go
and piss on my side of the fence.

1615
01:33:22,997 --> 01:33:25,166
And so now the fence must come down.

1616
01:33:25,875 --> 01:33:27,710
I'm going to use your little Time Ripper.

1617
01:33:27,877 --> 01:33:30,462
And I'm going to destroy this universe...

1618
01:33:30,630 --> 01:33:33,340
and the next and the next and the next...

1619
01:33:33,508 --> 01:33:37,094
until all that's left is The Void.

1620
01:33:37,261 --> 01:33:39,138
And I get to play God.

1621
01:33:39,681 --> 01:33:40,682
Come on.

1622
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:43,976
Now you're going to show me how
to use this fancy gadget of yours.

1623
01:33:44,143 --> 01:33:47,522
And don't worry, I've called some friends
to make sure we're not disturbed.

1624
01:33:51,109 --> 01:33:53,653
Sorry to bother, madam,
but there's something you need to see.

1625
01:33:54,196 --> 01:33:58,200
We're getting indications of an unsanctioned
Time Ripper activating on Earth-10005.

1626
01:34:00,493 --> 01:34:01,703
Whose district is that?

1627
01:34:02,079 --> 01:34:02,996
Paradox.

1628
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:17,260
Well, thank you so much
for your help, darling.

1629
01:34:17,428 --> 01:34:19,847
God. Good to get out of that head.

1630
01:34:20,013 --> 01:34:21,515
What a mess!

1631
01:34:28,856 --> 01:34:29,690
Stop!

1632
01:34:30,191 --> 01:34:32,193
Let's give it a beat for the extras to clear.

1633
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,403
Go, go, go!
Oh, my God!

1634
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:41,870
- Oh. My. God.
- Fuck.

1635
01:34:49,628 --> 01:34:51,004
It's her!

1636
01:34:52,255 --> 01:34:53,382
Come on, girl!

1637
01:35:00,805 --> 01:35:02,015
Come on, girl!

1638
01:35:16,781 --> 01:35:17,907
That's my girl!

1639
01:35:18,073 --> 01:35:21,368
We don't have to be apart ever, ever again.
Never, ever...

1640
01:35:21,536 --> 01:35:22,620
- Sorry!
- Fuck!

1641
01:35:23,746 --> 01:35:25,540
What's Café Gratitude doing here?

1642
01:35:25,706 --> 01:35:26,957
Sorry about that.

1643
01:35:27,124 --> 01:35:30,461
Tremble not, sweet Mary Puppins.
I'll handle him.

1644
01:35:31,086 --> 01:35:32,129
Come here, girl.
Papa's here.

1645
01:35:32,297 --> 01:35:34,715
Hey, do not insult
this animal's autonomy.

1646
01:35:35,425 --> 01:35:37,468
She can decide who her papa is.

1647
01:35:37,635 --> 01:35:38,678
What's it gonna be, girl, huh?

1648
01:35:38,844 --> 01:35:41,347
Original recipe or Van Milder here?

1649
01:35:41,973 --> 01:35:44,851
That's funny.
I can gently tap the fourth wall too.

1650
01:35:45,351 --> 01:35:46,519
<i>The Proposal.</i>

1651
01:35:48,271 --> 01:35:49,272
The fuck was that?

1652
01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:51,607
- Bitch, you think that's what I do?
- Both of you shut up.

1653
01:35:53,109 --> 01:35:54,110
You smell somethin'?

1654
01:35:54,277 --> 01:35:55,111
Yeah, you.

1655
01:35:55,987 --> 01:35:57,573
A lot of you.

1656
01:36:12,754 --> 01:36:15,006
Told you there were
a lot of Deadpools over there.

1657
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:27,729
That's bad.

1658
01:36:50,252 --> 01:36:51,419
I take it they're not friendly.

1659
01:36:51,586 --> 01:36:52,462
Goodness, no.

1660
01:36:52,629 --> 01:36:54,672
Sorry about this, boys.
Mission over.

1661
01:36:54,839 --> 01:36:57,509
Cause of death,
one hundred kill-thirsty Deadpools.

1662
01:36:57,675 --> 01:36:58,760
They're dumb.

1663
01:36:58,927 --> 01:37:00,678
But they can fight.
Not me, though.

1664
01:37:00,846 --> 01:37:03,056
Would love to get in the mix
but I have low bone density...

1665
01:37:03,223 --> 01:37:04,725
and I have to keep my face safe.

1666
01:37:05,684 --> 01:37:06,685
- Hold, please.
- Oh, God.

1667
01:37:06,852 --> 01:37:08,061
All right. Look.

1668
01:37:08,729 --> 01:37:09,730
Guys!

1669
01:37:10,939 --> 01:37:12,691
Deadpool Prime here.

1670
01:37:12,858 --> 01:37:14,317
- Our fight isn't with you...
- Hey!

1671
01:37:14,485 --> 01:37:18,113
When I want your opinion,
I'll take Wolverine's dick out of your mouth.

1672
01:37:18,281 --> 01:37:19,865
That's Kidpool.
She's the dirtiest.

1673
01:37:20,032 --> 01:37:21,284
Can we just be done?

1674
01:37:21,450 --> 01:37:22,993
We're just getting started.

1675
01:37:23,161 --> 01:37:26,455
No, no, no. With the whole multiverse thing.

1676
01:37:27,373 --> 01:37:28,374
It's not great.

1677
01:37:28,541 --> 01:37:30,001
It's just been miss...

1678
01:37:30,459 --> 01:37:31,961
after miss...

1679
01:37:32,128 --> 01:37:33,838
after miss.

1680
01:37:34,213 --> 01:37:36,549
Look, <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>
did the multiverse first...

1681
01:37:36,715 --> 01:37:39,010
and they did it best.
The gays knew it.

1682
01:37:39,468 --> 01:37:40,720
But we didn't listen.

1683
01:37:40,887 --> 01:37:43,640
Let's just take the L and move on.

1684
01:37:43,807 --> 01:37:46,142
I think it's been steadily great
since <i>Endgame.</i>

1685
01:37:46,309 --> 01:37:47,769
What are you talking about?

1686
01:37:47,936 --> 01:37:49,396
The multiverse is over.

1687
01:37:49,563 --> 01:37:52,441
Cassandy gonna destroy
the fuck outta every timeline.

1688
01:37:52,607 --> 01:37:54,901
- Y'all can't do shit about it.
- Do you not get it?

1689
01:37:55,068 --> 01:37:57,279
If we don't go down to the subway
and stop her, we all die.

1690
01:37:57,446 --> 01:37:59,698
Say, the boss lady don't want
no disturbances.

1691
01:37:59,864 --> 01:38:02,576
You wanna get down to the subway,
you gotta go through us.

1692
01:38:02,742 --> 01:38:03,702
Uzi time, baby.

1693
01:38:03,994 --> 01:38:04,995
Uzi time, baby.

1694
01:38:05,162 --> 01:38:06,163
Look alive!

1695
01:38:15,630 --> 01:38:17,299
- I think I'm hit.
- No shit.

1696
01:38:17,466 --> 01:38:18,383
You did that on purpose.

1697
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:20,094
I did no such thing!

1698
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:21,261
Listen to me, gorgeous.

1699
01:38:21,428 --> 01:38:22,680
How long does it take for you to regenerate?

1700
01:38:22,847 --> 01:38:24,098
Regenerate?

1701
01:38:30,313 --> 01:38:32,106
You really are God's perfect idiot,
aren't you?

1702
01:38:32,273 --> 01:38:33,649
- I'm okay.
- How dare you!

1703
01:38:33,816 --> 01:38:35,735
You insensitive son of a bitch!

1704
01:38:35,901 --> 01:38:37,820
How was I supposed to know
he doesn't regenerate?

1705
01:38:37,987 --> 01:38:39,114
I'm not a medicine woman.

1706
01:38:39,572 --> 01:38:40,823
Look. A donut cart.

1707
01:38:40,991 --> 01:38:42,075
- They're practically hospitals.
- What?

1708
01:38:42,242 --> 01:38:44,077
- They sell portable triage units.
- They don't.

1709
01:38:44,244 --> 01:38:45,786
- I'm gonna get you to safety.
- He's not.

1710
01:38:45,954 --> 01:38:47,122
Deep breath.

1711
01:38:55,505 --> 01:38:57,508
Hey, why are we stopping?

1712
01:38:57,674 --> 01:38:58,884
I'm just catching my breath.

1713
01:38:59,050 --> 01:39:01,637
What, are your legs on vacation?
You're dead weight!

1714
01:39:01,803 --> 01:39:03,389
That's because I'm paralyzed.

1715
01:39:03,555 --> 01:39:05,557
We all have problems.
Listen to me.

1716
01:39:05,724 --> 01:39:06,725
You're gonna live.

1717
01:39:07,851 --> 01:39:09,102
Look at me, Nicepool.

1718
01:39:13,065 --> 01:39:14,233
You're gonna live.

1719
01:39:14,941 --> 01:39:16,193
Say it!

1720
01:39:16,735 --> 01:39:18,070
I'm gonna live.

1721
01:39:18,362 --> 01:39:20,406
Say it with me.
You're gonna live.

1722
01:39:20,572 --> 01:39:22,741
I'm gonna live!

1723
01:39:24,076 --> 01:39:26,120
Say it louder!

1724
01:39:26,287 --> 01:39:27,454
I'm gonna live...

1725
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:37,382
Hold your fire!

1726
01:39:39,717 --> 01:39:41,010
Sweet little puppy.

1727
01:39:51,854 --> 01:39:54,316
God damn it!
I don't think he's gonna make it.

1728
01:39:54,482 --> 01:39:56,568
God, he loved his face.

1729
01:39:56,734 --> 01:39:59,112
I can taste his final thought.

1730
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:00,823
He was so afraid.

1731
01:40:00,989 --> 01:40:01,949
But he died a hero.

1732
01:40:02,115 --> 01:40:04,034
He died from murder, you dumb fuck.

1733
01:40:04,201 --> 01:40:05,994
And all I have to remember him by...

1734
01:40:06,912 --> 01:40:10,583
are these two gold-plated,
...50 caliber Desert Eagle pistoleros.

1735
01:40:11,041 --> 01:40:12,000
This is for him.

1736
01:40:12,626 --> 01:40:13,794
Are you ready?

1737
01:40:14,378 --> 01:40:16,129
I get to kill a hundred yous?

1738
01:40:16,297 --> 01:40:17,506
Fuck yeah, I'm ready.

1739
01:40:18,591 --> 01:40:19,883
Hey, you don't want to see this, bub.

1740
01:40:20,050 --> 01:40:21,344
That's a good girl.

1741
01:40:58,298 --> 01:40:59,674
Holy shit.

1742
01:40:59,841 --> 01:41:01,926
You save the good stuff
for special occasions?

1743
01:41:02,094 --> 01:41:03,345
Killing mostly.

1744
01:41:03,512 --> 01:41:05,847
What's the wind resistance
on those blowjob handles?

1745
01:41:07,141 --> 01:41:10,394
I'm sorry.
I'm just a catty bitch when I'm jealous.

1746
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:11,812
All right, let's do this.

1747
01:41:12,187 --> 01:41:13,397
Maximum effort.

1748
01:41:53,104 --> 01:41:54,189
You're dead.

1749
01:42:20,091 --> 01:42:21,342
Motherfucker.

1750
01:42:22,259 --> 01:42:23,886
I wish I were deaf.

1751
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:45,575
I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die.

1752
01:42:45,742 --> 01:42:46,784
I don't wanna...

1753
01:43:00,465 --> 01:43:01,633
Come on.

1754
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:02,801
I blew it.

1755
01:43:02,968 --> 01:43:05,012
After all that, the only thing
they're gonna remember...

1756
01:43:05,178 --> 01:43:06,889
is that God awful dismount!

1757
01:43:11,727 --> 01:43:13,228
What you laughing at,
you little fucker?

1758
01:43:13,562 --> 01:43:14,688
Uh-oh.

1759
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:15,898
Uh-oh.

1760
01:43:20,110 --> 01:43:21,695
I guess these ones regenerate.

1761
01:43:23,822 --> 01:43:26,200
Come on. We don't have time for this.

1762
01:43:26,367 --> 01:43:27,410
Deadpools!

1763
01:43:27,576 --> 01:43:28,661
Stand down.

1764
01:43:39,172 --> 01:43:40,674
This Deadpool's with me.

1765
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:42,050
Oh, no.

1766
01:43:42,216 --> 01:43:43,426
Holy shit.

1767
01:43:43,593 --> 01:43:44,803
That's fuckin' Peter!

1768
01:43:48,014 --> 01:43:49,849
Wait, you...
You guys know Peter?

1769
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:52,143
You kidding me? Every Deadpool has a Peter.

1770
01:43:52,311 --> 01:43:55,897
Shit. Peter's a goddamn legend
in every Deadpool's world.

1771
01:43:56,064 --> 01:43:57,149
Peter<i>-san.</i>

1772
01:44:05,532 --> 01:44:07,617
Peter. Peter. Peter.

1773
01:44:13,665 --> 01:44:15,209
Enjoy my Peter.

1774
01:44:42,778 --> 01:44:45,240
Oh, now you're here.
Oh, well, you're too late. It's all over.

1775
01:44:45,406 --> 01:44:46,241
Not yet, it's not.

1776
01:44:46,407 --> 01:44:48,076
Whoa. No, no, no. We're very close.

1777
01:44:48,243 --> 01:44:49,577
Homestretch, folks. Promise.

1778
01:44:49,745 --> 01:44:51,246
Quick, let's up the stakes.

1779
01:44:51,412 --> 01:44:52,748
If she steals the Time Ripper's energy...

1780
01:44:52,914 --> 01:44:55,375
she has the power to
shred the fabric of all realities...

1781
01:44:55,542 --> 01:44:57,168
until there is nothing left but The Void.

1782
01:44:57,335 --> 01:44:58,294
How do we shut it down?

1783
01:44:58,712 --> 01:44:59,630
I don't know.

1784
01:45:01,382 --> 01:45:02,466
How about now?

1785
01:45:02,633 --> 01:45:03,967
The mask is really intimidating, huh?

1786
01:45:04,134 --> 01:45:06,136
It's like Batman,
except he can move his neck.

1787
01:45:06,303 --> 01:45:07,721
Okay, look, look, look.

1788
01:45:09,181 --> 01:45:11,558
The Ripper is fed from
a secure chamber below ground.

1789
01:45:11,725 --> 01:45:15,854
It is powered by twin matter and anti-matter
feeds converging inside the device.

1790
01:45:16,022 --> 01:45:17,148
<i>Now, Cassandra Nova...</i>

1791
01:45:17,314 --> 01:45:19,483
<i>is redirecting the Ripper's power
to eliminate all timelines...</i>

1792
01:45:19,650 --> 01:45:20,651
starting with this one.

1793
01:45:20,818 --> 01:45:22,153
Theoretically, you could stop her...

1794
01:45:22,319 --> 01:45:24,155
by short-circuiting the feeds
in the chamber below.

1795
01:45:24,321 --> 01:45:26,699
One of you were to create a
circuit between the two feeds...

1796
01:45:26,866 --> 01:45:30,077
then the released power
would destroy the machine.

1797
01:45:30,244 --> 01:45:32,038
- But, well, but...
- Come on, man.

1798
01:45:32,204 --> 01:45:34,206
If you're not gonna swallow, spit it out.

1799
01:45:34,373 --> 01:45:37,419
Whoever formed the bridge
would be annihilated.

1800
01:45:37,585 --> 01:45:39,211
- I could live with that.
- Yeah, I could live with that, too, actually.

1801
01:45:39,379 --> 01:45:41,088
You know, we survive anything.
We're like cockroaches.

1802
01:45:41,256 --> 01:45:42,173
Not this time.

1803
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:45,009
This is matter and anti-matter.

1804
01:45:45,177 --> 01:45:47,095
They do not play nicely with each other.

1805
01:45:47,262 --> 01:45:50,015
When they mix in your body
you will be atomized.

1806
01:45:50,598 --> 01:45:52,600
Trust the laws of physics
if you don't trust me.

1807
01:45:52,767 --> 01:45:54,811
Even if you lived long enough to
make the circuit...

1808
01:45:54,978 --> 01:45:57,522
you will die down there.

1809
01:46:22,881 --> 01:46:24,217
Hold off. Hold.

1810
01:46:24,383 --> 01:46:25,884
You heard that asshole upstairs.

1811
01:46:26,052 --> 01:46:30,098
Even if we pull this off,
we're dead. Permanently.

1812
01:46:30,723 --> 01:46:31,765
That's why it's got to be me.

1813
01:46:31,933 --> 01:46:32,766
What?

1814
01:46:36,687 --> 01:46:37,521
Look, man...

1815
01:46:38,773 --> 01:46:40,524
you didn't ask for any of this.

1816
01:46:40,984 --> 01:46:42,110
You were right.

1817
01:46:42,443 --> 01:46:43,361
I lied.

1818
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:46,030
I lied right to your face...

1819
01:46:46,197 --> 01:46:48,074
just to get you to help me. And you did.

1820
01:46:48,992 --> 01:46:50,452
You didn't lie.

1821
01:46:52,454 --> 01:46:53,830
You made an educated wish.

1822
01:46:56,916 --> 01:46:57,751
Come on.

1823
01:46:59,169 --> 01:47:00,920
You got a whole world to go back to.

1824
01:47:02,589 --> 01:47:03,423
I got nothin'.

1825
01:47:05,759 --> 01:47:06,593
I got nothin'.

1826
01:47:11,849 --> 01:47:12,682
Give me this.

1827
01:47:19,857 --> 01:47:21,066
Hey.

1828
01:47:25,571 --> 01:47:27,407
I waited a long time for this team up.

1829
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:30,660
You know something?

1830
01:47:32,703 --> 01:47:34,205
You were the best Wolverine.

1831
01:47:43,089 --> 01:47:44,883
Say hi to your friends for me.

1832
01:47:56,978 --> 01:47:58,063
No!

1833
01:47:58,229 --> 01:47:59,189
Open the door!

1834
01:47:59,355 --> 01:48:01,983
I can't hear you over all the
noble sacrifice.

1835
01:48:02,150 --> 01:48:03,276
Why are you fucking doing this?

1836
01:48:03,444 --> 01:48:06,572
Because I'm Marvel Jesus.

1837
01:48:08,282 --> 01:48:09,283
Or Spock.

1838
01:48:10,534 --> 01:48:11,535
Hard to say.

1839
01:48:16,165 --> 01:48:16,999
Wade!

1840
01:48:17,749 --> 01:48:19,710
You fucking idiot!

1841
01:48:24,882 --> 01:48:26,008
Sorry, I'm just stalling.

1842
01:48:26,175 --> 01:48:28,469
I think I'm nervous about dying.

1843
01:48:29,303 --> 01:48:30,429
This should be me.

1844
01:48:31,138 --> 01:48:32,807
Say hi to my friends for me, peanut.

1845
01:48:32,974 --> 01:48:33,975
Wade!

1846
01:48:34,141 --> 01:48:36,185
You want to be an annoying prick,
do it this side!

1847
01:48:36,352 --> 01:48:38,396
You're gonna die in there,
you dumb fuck!

1848
01:48:45,403 --> 01:48:47,072
Hey! You don't need to do this.

1849
01:48:47,489 --> 01:48:49,116
I'm not doing it 'cause I need it.

1850
01:48:50,158 --> 01:48:52,160
I'm doing it because they do.

1851
01:49:03,130 --> 01:49:04,381
No!

1852
01:49:33,744 --> 01:49:35,246
He's not gonna make it.

1853
01:49:43,963 --> 01:49:45,048
It's over.

1854
01:50:52,576 --> 01:50:53,910
<i>The Wolverine.</i>

1855
01:50:54,995 --> 01:50:56,788
<i>He's a hero in my world.</i>

1856
01:50:59,082 --> 01:51:01,585
<i>Whoever you think I am,
you got the wrong guy.</i>

1857
01:51:03,128 --> 01:51:04,880
<i>You were always the wrong guy...</i>

1858
01:51:06,423 --> 01:51:08,049
<i>till you weren't.</i>

1859
01:51:10,094 --> 01:51:11,595
<i>Wade.</i>

1860
01:51:13,514 --> 01:51:18,102
<i>Wade. You can finally, finally, matter.</i>

1861
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:35,161
Vanessa.

1862
01:51:37,622 --> 01:51:39,457
<i>I wanna see Vanessa.</i>

1863
01:51:45,755 --> 01:51:49,968
For the first time in my life,
I am proud to wear this suit.

1864
01:51:51,178 --> 01:51:52,845
<i>It means I'm an X-Man.</i>

1865
01:51:55,348 --> 01:51:56,934
I am the X-Man.

1866
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:42,564
Paradox.

1867
01:52:44,398 --> 01:52:45,567
You've been busy.

1868
01:52:45,984 --> 01:52:47,026
Well, somebody had to be.

1869
01:52:47,193 --> 01:52:49,153
We had some
strange readings from this location.

1870
01:52:49,321 --> 01:52:52,115
You wouldn't know anything about an
unsanctioned Time Ripper, would you?

1871
01:52:53,157 --> 01:52:56,286
No. No. I wouldn't know anything about an
unsanctioned Time Ripper.

1872
01:52:56,453 --> 01:52:57,954
Maybe you should ask Cassandra Nova.

1873
01:52:58,122 --> 01:52:59,038
Because I was assured...

1874
01:52:59,206 --> 01:53:01,708
that she was safely held in The Void.
But no...

1875
01:53:01,875 --> 01:53:03,919
she was here.
And she fondled my brain.

1876
01:53:04,086 --> 01:53:05,004
How did you let this happen?

1877
01:53:05,170 --> 01:53:06,046
You weren't involved at all?

1878
01:53:06,213 --> 01:53:08,715
In stopping her, yes!
Yes. I was.

1879
01:53:08,883 --> 01:53:10,425
But, not nearly enough.

1880
01:53:10,592 --> 01:53:12,803
Not as much as the men
who went down there after her.

1881
01:53:13,470 --> 01:53:14,554
My men.

1882
01:53:15,305 --> 01:53:16,306
My friends.

1883
01:53:17,725 --> 01:53:18,684
I warned them.

1884
01:53:18,851 --> 01:53:22,021
That they would be completely obliterated
if they went. But they went anyway. Like...

1885
01:53:23,814 --> 01:53:24,899
Like heroes.

1886
01:53:27,026 --> 01:53:28,694
Because that's who they were.

1887
01:53:31,572 --> 01:53:32,990
They just did what they had to do.

1888
01:53:34,409 --> 01:53:35,993
With no concern for their own safety.

1889
01:53:39,247 --> 01:53:45,837
The fact that we are all still standing here
is a testament to their heroism.

1890
01:53:49,549 --> 01:53:51,927
Anyway, there's nothing you or I can do
to bring them back now.

1891
01:53:53,762 --> 01:53:55,764
He has risen, baby girl.

1892
01:53:55,931 --> 01:53:56,723
Fuck!

1893
01:54:16,243 --> 01:54:17,453
Found your new Anchor Being.

1894
01:54:17,954 --> 01:54:19,914
And we're doing just fine, you piece of shit.

1895
01:54:20,331 --> 01:54:21,415
Mm. Mm-hmm.

1896
01:54:21,791 --> 01:54:23,250
Fine indeed.

1897
01:54:23,417 --> 01:54:27,421
All right. Put your greasy tits away,
you preening slut.

1898
01:54:28,297 --> 01:54:29,674
I don't understand.

1899
01:54:29,841 --> 01:54:31,008
How are you two still alive?

1900
01:54:31,175 --> 01:54:33,260
You were right.
One of us would have been killed.

1901
01:54:33,428 --> 01:54:36,389
But you put
a Deadpool and a Wolverine together...

1902
01:54:36,556 --> 01:54:38,641
make 'em hold hands
while listening to Madonna...

1903
01:54:38,808 --> 01:54:40,893
indestructible, motherfucker.

1904
01:54:41,394 --> 01:54:43,605
Let's get this Deadpool Variant
back to The Void.

1905
01:54:43,771 --> 01:54:45,607
- Wait, hold on. What?
- Nope. Actually...

1906
01:54:45,773 --> 01:54:47,317
This one's homegrown, like me.

1907
01:54:47,484 --> 01:54:48,568
He belongs here.

1908
01:54:49,027 --> 01:54:49,944
And you are?

1909
01:54:50,112 --> 01:54:52,655
Peterpool. But you can call me Peter.

1910
01:54:54,282 --> 01:54:55,325
And I hope that you do.

1911
01:55:01,832 --> 01:55:03,250
What the fuck is happening here?

1912
01:55:03,416 --> 01:55:05,085
You are under judgment...

1913
01:55:05,252 --> 01:55:07,129
for operating an unsanctioned Time Ripper.

1914
01:55:07,295 --> 01:55:08,380
- Take him.
- I was just doing what...

1915
01:55:08,547 --> 01:55:09,923
you don't have the guts to do.

1916
01:55:10,716 --> 01:55:12,926
Get your insolent hands off me!

1917
01:55:13,093 --> 01:55:13,927
Get off!

1918
01:55:15,178 --> 01:55:16,847
I'm grateful, gentlemen.

1919
01:55:17,681 --> 01:55:18,766
Let's hold the bows.

1920
01:55:18,932 --> 01:55:21,352
You led an
Omega-level mutant to this timeline.

1921
01:55:21,519 --> 01:55:23,104
- You're welcome.
- And you...

1922
01:55:23,271 --> 01:55:25,148
- shouldn't even be near this timeline.
- He's welcome.

1923
01:55:25,439 --> 01:55:28,692
And you look damn good in that suit.

1924
01:55:28,859 --> 01:55:29,861
I'm so sorry.

1925
01:55:34,365 --> 01:55:37,994
I wanna show you something.
Something huge.

1926
01:55:38,161 --> 01:55:40,079
That's what Scoutmaster Kevin used to say.

1927
01:55:41,706 --> 01:55:42,707
Do you see that?

1928
01:55:43,457 --> 01:55:45,209
Your universe is regenerating.

1929
01:55:46,127 --> 01:55:47,462
Whatever you did here...

1930
01:55:47,879 --> 01:55:49,756
you not only saved your world.

1931
01:55:50,299 --> 01:55:52,676
You spared your timeline from extinction.

1932
01:55:54,511 --> 01:55:55,595
I'd rest up.

1933
01:55:55,970 --> 01:55:58,348
I have a feeling your work
is only just getting started.

1934
01:55:58,515 --> 01:56:00,059
Till you're 90.

1935
01:56:00,225 --> 01:56:01,060
Wait!

1936
01:56:02,519 --> 01:56:05,230
We couldn't have made it out of The Void
without some help...

1937
01:56:06,065 --> 01:56:09,944
from some people that the world
kind of forgot.

1938
01:56:10,444 --> 01:56:13,823
Is there any way that you could maybe find
a way to bring them home?

1939
01:56:15,908 --> 01:56:16,992
I'll see what I can do.

1940
01:56:17,743 --> 01:56:19,620
And I promised my friend here...

1941
01:56:20,037 --> 01:56:23,583
that the TVA could undo some
pretty awful shit in his timeline.

1942
01:56:23,749 --> 01:56:24,709
What would you say to that?

1943
01:56:25,042 --> 01:56:26,085
Change the past?

1944
01:56:26,711 --> 01:56:28,671
Well, he did help me save the world.

1945
01:56:29,004 --> 01:56:31,341
And his past made him the man who did it.

1946
01:56:32,425 --> 01:56:34,677
There's nothing to fix, Mr. Wilson.

1947
01:56:36,137 --> 01:56:37,180
Logan.

1948
01:56:40,683 --> 01:56:41,476
Shawarma?

1949
01:56:41,642 --> 01:56:42,477
- I could eat.
- Yeah.

1950
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:54,615
You know, the Avengers discovered shawarma.

1951
01:56:55,616 --> 01:56:57,242
They'd be lucky to have you.

1952
01:57:04,625 --> 01:57:06,627
- Oh.
- Oh, come on.

1953
01:57:06,793 --> 01:57:07,836
Fuck off!

1954
01:57:09,004 --> 01:57:13,717
Come here, my little cunchkin.
Yes, it's you. You're a survivor.

1955
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:16,929
Oh, all is right in the world.

1956
01:57:18,222 --> 01:57:19,223
Yes, it is.

1957
01:57:21,017 --> 01:57:22,184
So what are you gonna do next?

1958
01:57:23,811 --> 01:57:25,813
I'll figure it out. I always do.

1959
01:57:26,689 --> 01:57:27,523
All right.

1960
01:57:28,858 --> 01:57:30,109
So I'll probably see you around?

1961
01:57:35,156 --> 01:57:35,990
Probably not.

1962
01:57:39,494 --> 01:57:40,328
See you, bub.

1963
01:57:50,088 --> 01:57:51,089
Logan.

1964
01:57:57,679 --> 01:57:59,347
Al. I'm back.

1965
01:57:59,932 --> 01:58:01,183
About damn time.

1966
01:58:01,558 --> 01:58:02,392
You holdin'?

1967
01:58:02,559 --> 01:58:04,311
I'm all outta devil's dandruff...

1968
01:58:04,477 --> 01:58:07,189
- and I'm shaking like an angry vibrator.
- Thank you, Al.

1969
01:58:07,355 --> 01:58:08,231
We have company.

1970
01:58:09,107 --> 01:58:10,609
Althea, this is...

1971
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:12,403
This is Logan.

1972
01:58:12,570 --> 01:58:13,612
Nice to meet you, Logan.

1973
01:58:13,779 --> 01:58:14,613
Nice to meet you, too.

1974
01:58:14,780 --> 01:58:18,326
And this little ancient anal shit-knot is
Mary Puppins.

1975
01:58:18,492 --> 01:58:20,786
Or as I like to call her, Dogpool.

1976
01:58:20,953 --> 01:58:22,621
You want to treat yourself
to a little stroke?

1977
01:58:24,290 --> 01:58:27,335
- Get the tongue. There it is.
- Oh, my God! Motherfucker!

1978
01:58:27,501 --> 01:58:31,214
Right? It's like an armadillo
fucked a gremlin, angrily...

1979
01:58:31,380 --> 01:58:32,673
in a bed of gonorrhea...

1980
01:58:32,841 --> 01:58:35,218
- Wow.
- ...and didn't stop till the sun came up.

1981
01:58:36,510 --> 01:58:38,096
<i>Everyone wants to matter.</i>

1982
01:58:39,013 --> 01:58:41,641
<i>Turns out that
you don't need to be Marvel Jesus to do it.</i>

1983
01:58:42,476 --> 01:58:44,728
<i>You just need to
open your eyes and look around.</i>

1984
01:58:45,437 --> 01:58:46,438
<i>And if you're lucky...</i>

1985
01:58:47,439 --> 01:58:48,857
<i>you'll find a few friends.</i>

1986
01:58:49,316 --> 01:58:50,442
<i>Old friends...</i>

1987
01:58:51,443 --> 01:58:53,152
<i>and some new ones too.</i>

1988
01:58:57,866 --> 01:58:59,826
Give me the fucking dog. Talk to the girl.

1989
01:59:10,295 --> 01:59:11,421
Well, hi.

1990
01:59:11,588 --> 01:59:12,422
Hi.

1991
01:59:15,259 --> 01:59:16,260
You've been busy.

1992
01:59:19,346 --> 01:59:20,848
I did it for you.

1993
01:59:22,892 --> 01:59:25,185
And even if you don't want me,
I did it for you.

1994
01:59:34,612 --> 01:59:35,613
<i>It turns out...</i>

1995
01:59:36,322 --> 01:59:37,698
<i>I am the world-saving type.</i>

1996
01:59:38,658 --> 01:59:40,660
<i>Just look around this table
if you want proof.</i>

1997
01:59:41,661 --> 01:59:42,620
<i>And the best part?</i>

1998
01:59:43,579 --> 01:59:45,331
<i>Sometimes the people we save...</i>

1999
01:59:46,374 --> 01:59:48,543
<i>well, they save us right back.</i>

2000
02:00:28,042 --> 02:00:30,169
<i>You're not the only one with gifts.</i>

2001
02:00:30,336 --> 02:00:31,504
What is this place?

2002
02:01:00,533 --> 02:01:01,368
Nice suit.

2003
02:01:01,534 --> 02:01:02,410
Zip it, Stan Lee.

2004
02:01:11,337 --> 02:01:13,881
{\an8}I really like the,
the art in the Deadpool comics.

2005
02:01:14,047 --> 02:01:16,300
<i>You know, I just always felt a
kind of a kinship to him.</i>

2006
02:01:16,467 --> 02:01:19,178
And I just thought,
I'd like to play that guy someday.

2007
02:01:47,999 --> 02:01:50,502
I was there for three weeks
before I shot a single thing.

2008
02:01:50,919 --> 02:01:52,462
{\an8}At our first day of shooting...

2009
02:01:53,004 --> 02:01:54,506
<i>I was so nervous, man.</i>

2010
02:01:55,089 --> 02:01:57,176
Everyone was sort of going,
"Who's this guy?"

2011
02:01:57,342 --> 02:01:59,178
<i>You know, there was a lot of that and...</i>

2012
02:01:59,344 --> 02:02:02,806
you know, "Is he gonna deliver or not?"
You can feel all that kind of pressure.

2013
02:02:04,141 --> 02:02:07,394
It's always the suit's fault.
Never the actor.

2014
02:02:16,195 --> 02:02:17,572
- This is...
- The only way.

2015
02:02:26,997 --> 02:02:28,916
So this is what it feels like.

2016
02:02:31,461 --> 02:02:33,088
And there's the lights.

2017
02:02:33,254 --> 02:02:34,505
For medical research.

2018
02:02:35,131 --> 02:02:37,050
- Bye-bye, video.
- Bye.

2019
02:06:51,103 --> 02:06:54,982
I'm tired of these absolutely vile rumors
that I got Johnny killed.

2020
02:06:56,066 --> 02:06:57,109
Let's look at the tape.

2021
02:06:58,318 --> 02:06:59,527
<i>In The Void...</i>

2022
02:06:59,695 --> 02:07:01,488
<i>you're either food for Alioth...</i>

2023
02:07:01,655 --> 02:07:02,781
or you work for her.

2024
02:07:05,951 --> 02:07:06,869
Go on, Johnny.

2025
02:07:07,411 --> 02:07:08,537
And I'll tell you who "her" is.

2026
02:07:09,037 --> 02:07:09,913
Cassandra Nova.

2027
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:12,249
A megalomaniacal, psychotic asshole.

2028
02:07:12,416 --> 02:07:16,128
A finger licking dead-inside pixie slab of
third rate dime-store nut-milk.

2029
02:07:16,295 --> 02:07:17,838
- And I'll tell you what she can do.
- I'm listening.

2030
02:07:18,005 --> 02:07:21,550
She can lick my goddamn cinnamon ring clean
and kick rocks all the way to bald hell.

2031
02:07:21,717 --> 02:07:23,927
In fact, I don't give a shit if she removes
all my skin and...

2032
02:07:24,095 --> 02:07:25,972
pops me like some nightmarish blood balloon.

2033
02:07:26,139 --> 02:07:29,100
If the last thing I do in this godforsaken
cum-gutter existence...

2034
02:07:29,267 --> 02:07:32,020
is light that fuck-box on fire,
I still won't die happy.

2035
02:07:32,186 --> 02:07:33,938
Holy shit, girl. You crazy.

2036
02:07:34,105 --> 02:07:35,732
That's right, Wade.
I won't be happy until...

2037
02:07:35,899 --> 02:07:39,653
I've urinated on her freshly barbecued corpse
and husk-fucked the charred remains...

2038
02:07:39,819 --> 02:07:41,571
while gargling Juggernaut's juggernuts.

2039
02:07:41,738 --> 02:07:43,114
- Wow!
- And you can quote me.

2040
02:07:43,281 --> 02:07:44,115
'Kay.

2041
02:07:44,866 --> 02:07:46,159
Got you, fuckface.
