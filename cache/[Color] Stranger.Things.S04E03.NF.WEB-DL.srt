00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:40,206
<font color="#21ff11">Sam.</font>

2
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:16,200
<font color="#21ff11">There were no signs
of any attacker. No bruises.</font>

3
00:01:16,283 --> 00:01:17,993
<font color="#21ff11">No signs of any struggle.</font>

4
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,914
<font color="#21ff11">It's as if her attacker was a ghost.</font>

5
00:01:22,414 --> 00:01:24,084
<font color="#21ff11">Does this remind you of anything, Doctor?</font>

6
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,503
<font color="#21ff11">No, it doesn't.</font>

7
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,462
<font color="#21ff11">Are you sure?</font>

8
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:31,007
<font color="#21ff11">Why are you here?</font>

9
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,424
<font color="#21ff11">Really.</font>

10
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,634
<font color="#21ff11">I'd like your opinion.</font>

11
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:35,844
<font color="#21ff11">I was fired, in case you forgot.</font>

12
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:40,015
<font color="#21ff11">A foreign government invaded our country,
all under your watch.</font>

13
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,353
<font color="#21ff11">There had to be consequences.
Certainly you understand that.</font>

14
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:47,064
<font color="#21ff11">What I understand is that something…
something is going on in that town</font>

15
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:50,902
<font color="#21ff11">that nobody… nobody fully comprehends.</font>

16
00:01:50,984 --> 00:01:54,614
<font color="#21ff11">And I also understand
that military strength is not the answer.</font>

17
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,490
<font color="#21ff11">So what is the answer, Doctor?</font>

18
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,200
<font color="#21ff11">More scientists?</font>

19
00:01:58,283 --> 00:02:00,912
<font color="#21ff11">Because it was
men of science, men like you,</font>

20
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,664
<font color="#21ff11">who created this problem
in the first place.</font>

21
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,334
<font color="#21ff11">Everything that has happened in Hawkins</font>

22
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,419
<font color="#21ff11">can be traced back
to Brenner's little pet.</font>

23
00:02:10,003 --> 00:02:10,921
<font color="#21ff11">Wouldn't you agree?</font>

24
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:24,185
<font color="#21ff11">Dr. Brenner trained her
for this very thing.</font>

25
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,728
<font color="#21ff11">Remote assassinations.</font>

26
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,525
<font color="#21ff11">What you're suggesting is impossible.</font>

27
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,192
<font color="#21ff11">- Is it?
- Eleven is dead.</font>

28
00:02:32,276 --> 00:02:35,195
<font color="#21ff11">- I'm not convinced.
- So, where has she been all this time?</font>

29
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,781
<font color="#21ff11">There are rumors she's alive</font>

30
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,408
<font color="#21ff11">and receiving help
from someone on the inside.</font>

31
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:42,495
<font color="#21ff11">Are you saying I'm helping her?
Is that what you're saying?</font>

32
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,873
<font color="#21ff11">If I wanted to chat, Doctor,
I would've picked up the damn phone.</font>

33
00:02:46,832 --> 00:02:50,170
<font color="#21ff11">Now, you can make this easy
and tell us where she is, or…</font>

34
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:53,840
<font color="#21ff11">We can do this the hard way.</font>

35
00:02:58,468 --> 00:03:00,930
<font color="#21ff11">Not in here. Go! Go! Go!</font>

36
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,640
<font color="#21ff11">- Move!
- Nothing.</font>

37
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:10,147
<i><font color="#21ff11">Why are you taking that box?</font></i>

38
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,483
<font color="#21ff11">Those are Peter's old school projects.</font>

39
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,568
<font color="#21ff11">You do not need those. Hey!</font>

40
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:16,111
<font color="#21ff11">I'm talking to you!</font>

41
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:18,364
<font color="#21ff11">Sam, do something.</font>

42
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,425
<font color="#21ff11">I wanna know
everything he's done,</font>

43
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,093
<font color="#21ff11">everyone he's spoken to in the past year.</font>

44
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:41,346
<font color="#21ff11">And if we're lucky,</font>

45
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,014
<font color="#21ff11">he'll lead us right to the girl.</font>

46
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,425
<font color="#21ff11">Can you tell me your name?</font>

47
00:05:00,507 --> 00:05:03,011
<font color="#21ff11">- Um, Angela.
- Angela.</font>

48
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:05,053
<font color="#21ff11">Do you know where you are, Angela?</font>

49
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:08,432
<font color="#21ff11">- Um, Rink… Rink-O-Mania, I think?
- Rink-O-Mania. Very good.</font>

50
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,394
<font color="#21ff11">- Now, where does it hurt, sweetie?
- My head.</font>

51
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:12,603
<font color="#21ff11">Your head hurts?</font>

52
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,148
<font color="#21ff11">And my nose.</font>

53
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,608
<font color="#21ff11">I can't breathe.</font>

54
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:20,778
<font color="#21ff11">Just try to take some deep breaths.</font>

55
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,031
<font color="#21ff11">Breathe slow for me, okay? That's it.</font>

56
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,951
<font color="#21ff11">I know it's a lot of blood,
but you're going to be okay.</font>

57
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,536
<font color="#21ff11">- I don't think so.
- I promise.</font>

58
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,456
<font color="#21ff11">Just need you to answer
a few more questions, all right?</font>

59
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:33,832
<font color="#21ff11">Okay.</font>

60
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,880
<font color="#21ff11">No.</font>

61
00:05:42,716 --> 00:05:44,052

62
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:48,889
<i><font color="#21ff11">I know
this may be, like, upsetting and shit,</font></i>

63
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,975
<i><font color="#21ff11">but that future prom queen
is gonna be fine.</font></i>

64
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,978
<font color="#21ff11">It's just, like, rubber wheels.</font>

65
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,730
<font color="#21ff11">- Plastic.
- Oh.</font>

66
00:05:55,812 --> 00:05:57,606
<font color="#21ff11">Not like hard plastic. Just…</font>

67
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:01,151
<font color="#21ff11">- Just the soft kind.
- Totally.</font>

68
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:04,197
<font color="#21ff11">But you ever wonder
why the wheels aren't wood, man?</font>

69
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,615
<font color="#21ff11">Or metal?</font>

70
00:06:06,156 --> 00:06:09,535
<font color="#21ff11">So people don't get hurt
when they get shmacked.</font>

71
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,702
<font color="#21ff11">- Oh.
- Yeah.</font>

72
00:06:10,786 --> 00:06:13,497
<font color="#21ff11">Because it happens
more than you think, man.</font>

73
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,874
<font color="#21ff11">Roller-skate attacks.</font>

74
00:06:14,956 --> 00:06:18,002
<font color="#21ff11">Man. Hey, at least it wasn't an ice skate.</font>

75
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,879
<font color="#21ff11">That nose would've been
sliced clean off, man.</font>

76
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,802
<font color="#21ff11">- It could've been so much worse.
- So much worse.</font>

77
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,971
<font color="#21ff11">In the grand scheme of things,
it's just a little blip.</font>

78
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:31,598
<font color="#21ff11">That's a funny word, man.</font>

79
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,516
<font color="#21ff11">"Blip."</font>

80
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:34,476
<font color="#21ff11">- "Blip."
- "Blip."</font>

81
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,148
<font color="#21ff11">Blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip.</font>

82
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:00,336
<font color="#21ff11">Mom?</font>

83
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:07,343
<font color="#21ff11">Well, well! Aren't you lot
a sight for sore eyes, huh?</font>

84
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,595
<font color="#21ff11">- Hi, Murray.
- You kids like risotto?</font>

85
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,389
<font color="#21ff11">Yeah.</font>

86
00:07:13,473 --> 00:07:16,978
<font color="#21ff11">There I was, headed down the I-5,
going to see a client in Ventura.</font>

87
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,312
<font color="#21ff11">I'm looking for a motel
to stay for the night,</font>

88
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:22,149
<font color="#21ff11">and suddenly, bam, it hits me.</font>

89
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,485
<font color="#21ff11">"Didn't the Byers move here?"</font>

90
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,737
<font color="#21ff11">Small world, isn't it? It's a small world.</font>

91
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,865
<font color="#21ff11">So I thought,
"Hey, you know what?"</font>

92
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:31,533
<font color="#21ff11">"Why don't I drop in,
say hello to my old friends?"</font>

93
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,951
<font color="#21ff11">It's so sweet of you.</font>

94
00:07:33,034 --> 00:07:35,829
<font color="#21ff11">- Sweeter of you to let me stay.
- And he cooks.</font>

95
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,040
<font color="#21ff11">Mm, and cleans.
A regular little housewife.</font>

96
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,459
<font color="#21ff11">You should stay.</font>

97
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,713
<font color="#21ff11">I'd be tempted, Joyce,
except, you know, you have that, uh…</font>

98
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,132
<font color="#21ff11">Right, that business trip.</font>

99
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,925
<font color="#21ff11">Business trip? What business trip?</font>

100
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,887
<font color="#21ff11">Oh my gosh.
I almost forgot to tell you guys.</font>

101
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:54,264
<font color="#21ff11">- This thing came up at work…
- Can you pass me the olive oil?</font>

102
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,348
<font color="#21ff11">That's wine.</font>

103
00:07:55,432 --> 00:07:59,269
<font color="#21ff11">And it turns out I have to go
to a conference tomorrow. In Alaska.</font>

104
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,396
<font color="#21ff11">- Alaska?
- Tomorrow?</font>

105
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,521
<font color="#21ff11">Crazy, right?</font>

106
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:04,983
<font color="#21ff11">That's where they're based,
the Britannicas.</font>

107
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,737
<font color="#21ff11">Joan and Brian Britannica.</font>

108
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:09,529
<font color="#21ff11">Mm.</font>

109
00:08:10,363 --> 00:08:12,574
<font color="#21ff11">So do Eskimos, like,
still live in igloos,</font>

110
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:17,579
<font color="#21ff11">or, uh, are they, like, fully-blown,
like, living in the… in the suburbs now?</font>

111
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,206
<font color="#21ff11">Who is this?</font>

112
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,917
<font color="#21ff11">So, Jonathan,</font>

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,045
<font color="#21ff11">this means you're gonna have to,
you know, take charge while I'm gone.</font>

114
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:26,713
<font color="#21ff11">- Yeah.
- Wait.</font>

115
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,466
<font color="#21ff11">What?</font>

116
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:30,175
<font color="#21ff11">What's going on?</font>

117
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,385
<font color="#21ff11">- Oh my…
- Your mom's going to Alaska.</font>

118
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,846
<font color="#21ff11">You're going to Alaska?</font>

119
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:34,971
<font color="#21ff11">Mm-hmm.</font>

120
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,767
<font color="#21ff11">- What's going on in Alaska?
- The Britannicas are there.</font>

121
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,184
<font color="#21ff11">- The Britannicas?
- Mm-hmm.</font>

122
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,269
<font color="#21ff11">Jonathan, what is wrong with you?</font>

123
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,232
<font color="#21ff11">- I think I know what's wrong with him.
- We just had a super stressful day.</font>

124
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,192
<font color="#21ff11">Stress, huh?</font>

125
00:08:46,274 --> 00:08:49,028
<font color="#21ff11">This girl got shmacked
in the head today at the roller rink.</font>

126
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,114
<font color="#21ff11">- Shmacked?
- Yeah, one of those vicious skate attacks.</font>

127
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:55,201
<font color="#21ff11">- A skate attack?
- Yeah, but it wasn't an ice skate. It was…</font>

128
00:08:56,034 --> 00:08:59,163
<font color="#21ff11">- It was a plastic skate.
- No, it was, like, rubber.</font>

129
00:08:59,246 --> 00:09:00,206
<font color="#21ff11">Rubber. Rubber.</font>

130

she's gonna be fine.</font>

132
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,297
<font color="#21ff11">- She's totally fine.
- She didn't look fine.</font>

135
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,269
<font color="#21ff11">What is going on, you guys?</font>

136
00:09:22,352 --> 00:09:25,523
<font color="#21ff11">Okay, I, uh, I sense tension.</font>

137
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,442
<font color="#21ff11">Is it the risotto?
Everyone hates the risotto?</font>

138
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:30,528
<font color="#21ff11">- Absolutely not. No, it's incredible.
- Mm-mm.</font>

139
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:33,864
<font color="#21ff11">This risotto is shmackin', dude.</font>

143
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,764
<font color="#21ff11">Angela!</font>

145
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,731
<font color="#21ff11">What have you done?</font>

<font color="#21ff11">He sees all this? He sees us?</font>

147
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:33,650
<font color="#21ff11">He'll shit his pants and cry for Mommy.
This guy's no fighter.</font>

148
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,236
<font color="#21ff11">Hope he tries something.
Gives me a reason.</font>

149

<font color="#21ff11">Hell, yeah.</font>

150
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,948
<font color="#21ff11">Well, well, look who's decided to join.</font>

151
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,616
<font color="#21ff11">What are you guys doing?</font>

152
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,745
<font color="#21ff11">- We're gearing up.
- Preparing for the hunt.</font>

153
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,917
<font color="#21ff11">Hey, man. Relax.</font>

154
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,586
<font color="#21ff11">We're not killers like Eddie.</font>

155
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:54,212
<font color="#21ff11">We just wanna talk to him.</font>

156
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,673
<font color="#21ff11">Get him to admit his crime.</font>

157
00:11:55,755 --> 00:11:57,883
<font color="#21ff11">Yeah, a little friendly neighborhood chat.</font>

158
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:01,761
<font color="#21ff11">Hey.</font>

159
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,097
<font color="#21ff11">You didn't know Chris.</font>

160
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:08,436
<font color="#21ff11">If you're not up to this, you can go home.
There's no judgment.</font>

161
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,730
<font color="#21ff11">You'll still be one of us, all right?</font>

162
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,025
<font color="#21ff11">No.</font>

163
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,695
<font color="#21ff11">I'm good.</font>

164
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,615
<font color="#21ff11">I wanna help.</font>

165
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:24,994
<font color="#21ff11">All right.</font>

166
00:12:27,495 --> 00:12:28,706
<font color="#21ff11">Let's capture us a freak.</font>

167
00:12:39,048 --> 00:12:39,924
<font color="#21ff11">Shit.</font>

168
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,719
<font color="#21ff11">Oh shit.</font>

169
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,179
<font color="#21ff11">Jesus…</font>

170
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,765
<font color="#21ff11">Delivery service.</font>

171
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,566
<font color="#21ff11">So we got, uh, some good news
and some bad news.</font>

172
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:59,611
<font color="#21ff11">- How do you prefer it?
- Bad news first, always.</font>

173
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,821
<font color="#21ff11">All right. Bad news.</font>

174
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:03,407
<font color="#21ff11">We tapped into the Hawkins PD dispatch
with our Cerebro,</font>

175
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,576
<font color="#21ff11">and they're definitely looking for you.</font>

176
00:13:05,658 --> 00:13:07,952
<font color="#21ff11">Also, they're, uh, pretty convinced
you killed Chrissy.</font>

177
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,914
<font color="#21ff11">Like, 100% kind of convinced.</font>

178
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,542
<font color="#21ff11">- And the good news?
- Your name hasn't gone public yet.</font>

179
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:16,419
<font color="#21ff11">But if we found out about you,
it's a matter of time before others do.</font>

180
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,798
<font color="#21ff11">And once that gets out,
everyone and their shallow-minded mother</font>

181
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:21,174
<font color="#21ff11">is gonna be gunning for you.</font>

182
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,134
<font color="#21ff11">Hunt the freak, right?</font>

183
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,511
<font color="#21ff11">- Exactly.
- Shit.</font>

184
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,888
<font color="#21ff11">So, before that happens,</font>

185
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,599
<font color="#21ff11">we find Vecna, kill him,
and prove your innocence.</font>

186
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,558
<font color="#21ff11">That's all, Dustin? That's all?</font>

187
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,311
<font color="#21ff11">Yeah, no, that's pretty much it.</font>

188
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,645
<font color="#21ff11">Listen, Eddie,</font>

189
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,731
<font color="#21ff11">I know everything Dustin is saying
sounds totally delusional,</font>

190
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,025
<font color="#21ff11">but we've actually
been through this before.</font>

191
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,653
<font color="#21ff11">I mean, they have a… a few times,</font>

192
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:43,489
<font color="#21ff11">and… and I have once.</font>

193
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,783
<font color="#21ff11">Mine was more human-flesh-based,
theirs was more smoke-related,</font>

194
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:49,702
<font color="#21ff11">but bottom line is,
collectively, I really feel we got this.</font>

195
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,288
<font color="#21ff11">We usually rely on this girl
who has super powers.</font>

196
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:57,043
<font color="#21ff11">- But, uh, those went bye-bye, so…
- So we're technically in more of the...</font>

197
00:13:57,126 --> 00:13:58,629
<font color="#21ff11">- Kinda…
- Brainstorming phase.</font>

198
00:13:58,711 --> 00:13:59,672
<font color="#21ff11">Brainstorming.</font>

199
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:02,758
<font color="#21ff11">There… There's nothing to worry about.</font>

200
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:10,640
<font color="#21ff11">- Shit.
- Tarp.</font>

201
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,850
<font color="#21ff11">Tarp. Tarp.</font>

202
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,378
<font color="#21ff11">And after you talked to Wayne,
what happened?</font>

203
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,588
<font color="#21ff11">I heard barking from the dog,</font>

204
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,008
<font color="#21ff11">and then… he was just gone.</font>

205
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,052
<font color="#21ff11">See anyone lurking about?
Who looks like they shouldn't be there?</font>

206
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:51,139
<font color="#21ff11">No. No, no, there was nobody there.</font>

207
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:53,767
<font color="#21ff11">- "Nobody."
- I already told this to Officer Daniels.</font>

208
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:56,519
<font color="#21ff11">Did you look into Victor Creel?</font>

209
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,480
<font color="#21ff11">- Sorry, what's that?
- Victor Creel.</font>

210
00:14:58,563 --> 00:15:01,149
<font color="#21ff11">Wayne got it in her head
that the old nut did this.</font>

211
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:05,195
<font color="#21ff11">Victor's locked away.
Don't need to worry about him, all right?</font>

212
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,865
<font color="#21ff11">Now, you said last you saw Fred,</font>

213
00:15:08,948 --> 00:15:10,366
<font color="#21ff11">he was by the picnic tables.</font>

214
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,120
<font color="#21ff11">Do I have that right?</font>

215
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:14,621
<font color="#21ff11">Ms. Wheeler.</font>

216
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,042
<font color="#21ff11">He was by the picnic tables.
Is that correct?</font>

217
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,376
<font color="#21ff11">Ms. Wheeler?</font>

218
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:24,631
<font color="#21ff11">Does the picnic table ring a bell?</font>

219
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,472
<font color="#21ff11">Whoo!</font>

220
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,701
<font color="#21ff11">Hey, guys, there is a 4:00 p.m. showing
of <i>Police Academy 3.</font>

221
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,827
<font color="#21ff11">Could be fun.</font>

222
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,121
<font color="#21ff11">Maybe we just stay home today.</font>

223
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:00,250
<font color="#21ff11">What is this?
You guys just gonna mope around all break?</font>

224
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,419
<font color="#21ff11">No one's moping.
It's just the movie is supposed to suck.</font>

225
00:16:04,587 --> 00:16:05,714
<font color="#21ff11">It…</font>

226
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,356
<font color="#21ff11">Hey, El.</font>

227
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,150
<font color="#21ff11">I, uh, made you some Eggos,
but they're getting kinda cold.</font>

228
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,537
<font color="#21ff11">Hey, that's cool. Hop's cabin, right?</font>

229
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,630
<font color="#21ff11">So, um, are we just
not gonna talk about it?</font>

230
00:16:48,756 --> 00:16:50,174
<font color="#21ff11">About what?</font>

231
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,053
<font color="#21ff11">I don't know, just maybe,
like, about yesterday or…</font>

232
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,681
<font color="#21ff11">Everything.</font>

233
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:58,225
<font color="#21ff11">There's nothing to say.</font>

234
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:00,351
<font color="#21ff11">Yeah, I guess, um…</font>

235
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:02,812
<font color="#21ff11">I guess I'm just a little, uh…</font>

236
00:17:03,688 --> 00:17:05,315
<font color="#21ff11">Guess I don't really understand.</font>

237
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:08,027
<font color="#21ff11">Why didn't you tell me
what's going on here?</font>

238
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:12,614
<font color="#21ff11">I mean, you know I'm not exactly
Mr. Popularity back at home.</font>

239
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:17,118
<font color="#21ff11">I mean, you've seen it.
I've been bullied my entire life.</font>

240
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:19,078
<font color="#21ff11">I mean, I… I know what it's like.</font>

241
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:20,830
<font color="#21ff11">No.</font>

242
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:22,540
<font color="#21ff11">You don't.</font>

243
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,460
<font color="#21ff11">Okay.</font>

244
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:26,127
<font color="#21ff11">What don't I understand?</font>

245
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:31,174
<font color="#21ff11">I am different.</font>

246
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:36,305
<font color="#21ff11">I do not belong.</font>

247
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,098
<font color="#21ff11">You mean in Lenora?</font>

248
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,855
<font color="#21ff11">Anywhere.</font>

249
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,942
<font color="#21ff11">Come on,
you… you can't actually believe that.</font>

250
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:51,528
<font color="#21ff11">Everyone looks at me like…</font>

251
00:17:52,653 --> 00:17:53,989
<font color="#21ff11">like I'm a monster.</font>

252
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,907
<font color="#21ff11">They just don't know you.</font>

253
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:58,326
<font color="#21ff11">You think I'm a monster too.</font>

254
00:17:58,993 --> 00:17:59,827
<font color="#21ff11">What?</font>

255
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,747
<font color="#21ff11">Yesterday.</font>

256
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,165
<font color="#21ff11">The way you looked at me.</font>

257
00:18:04,665 --> 00:18:06,085
<font color="#21ff11">You… You were scared of me.</font>

258
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:09,546
<font color="#21ff11">No. No.
No, that's not… That's… That's not true.</font>

259
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,963

00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,384
<font color="#21ff11">That's the law. You're not gonna
change it complaining to me.</font>

519
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,094
<font color="#21ff11">You want to see Jane?</font>

520
00:32:51,176 --> 00:32:52,135
<font color="#21ff11">Find your mother.</font>

521
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,387
<font color="#21ff11">Thank you.</font>

522
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,935
<font color="#21ff11">It's bullshit. Such bullshit.
I mean, she wasn't even trying to help.</font>

523
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,729
<font color="#21ff11">- Then what do we do?
- I don't know.</font>

524
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,481
<font color="#21ff11">I guess we have to wait
for Mom to land in Alaska.</font>

525
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,401
<font color="#21ff11">Then she's gonna be in jail?</font>

526
00:33:06,483 --> 00:33:08,068
<font color="#21ff11">- Yeah, I don't know.
- Hey!</font>

527
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,695
<font color="#21ff11">- Hey!
- Hey, Mike!</font>

528
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:11,780
<font color="#21ff11">- Hey, stop the car!
- What are you doing?</font>

529
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:25,002
<font color="#21ff11">Oh no.</font>

530
00:33:25,502 --> 00:33:26,546
<font color="#21ff11">Oh no.</font>

531
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,025
<font color="#21ff11">All right. And here you go.</font>

532
00:33:47,107 --> 00:33:49,568
<font color="#21ff11">Thank you. Um, how much longer?</font>

533
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,363
<font color="#21ff11">Oh, just a few more hours. Almost there.</font>

534
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,698
<font color="#21ff11">Okay.</font>

535
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,200
<font color="#21ff11">You and your husband have exciting plans?</font>

536
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,744
<font color="#21ff11">Um, we're seeing an old friend.</font>

537
00:33:58,827 --> 00:33:59,996
<font color="#21ff11">How fun.</font>

538
00:34:18,597 --> 00:34:21,934
<font color="#21ff11">One person, one piece.
Don't you understand?!</font>

539
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:25,980
<font color="#21ff11">I said one piece per person!</font>

540
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:47,668
<font color="#21ff11">I am no fairy.</font>

541
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:48,878
<font color="#21ff11">No, no.</font>

542
00:34:49,628 --> 00:34:50,463
<font color="#21ff11">You…</font>

543
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,632
<font color="#21ff11">...hit.</font>

544
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:55,927
<font color="#21ff11">You…</font>

545
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,719
<font color="#21ff11">...hit.</font>

546
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,431
<font color="#21ff11">I give bread.</font>

547
00:35:06,186 --> 00:35:08,188
<font color="#21ff11">I will break your leg.</font>

548
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,068
<font color="#21ff11">You…</font>

549
00:35:13,568 --> 00:35:14,570
<font color="#21ff11">...hit.</font>

550
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,365
<font color="#21ff11">I give bread.</font>

551
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,452
<font color="#21ff11">And soup.</font>

552
00:35:33,922 --> 00:35:35,550
<font color="#21ff11">Crazy American.</font>

553
00:35:51,398 --> 00:35:52,315
<font color="#21ff11">Now.</font>

554
00:36:06,621 --> 00:36:08,206
<font color="#21ff11">Again.</font>

555
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,766
<font color="#21ff11">Help me get this straight.</font>

556
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,351
<font color="#21ff11">Eddie's uncle, Wayne,</font>

557
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,856
<font color="#21ff11">thinks that Victor Creel
escaped from Pennhurst Asylum</font>

558
00:36:31,938 --> 00:36:35,108
<font color="#21ff11">and that he's the one running around
committing these murders?</font>

559
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,318
<font color="#21ff11">Pretty much.</font>

560
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:40,947
<font color="#21ff11">But Victor committed the eyeball murders,
like, way back in the '50s.</font>

561
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,284
<font color="#21ff11">Well, '59.</font>

562
00:36:44,034 --> 00:36:48,664
<font color="#21ff11">So, that means these murders
predate Eleven in the Upside Down</font>

563
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:49,789
<font color="#21ff11">by about 30 years?</font>

564
00:36:49,873 --> 00:36:50,708
<font color="#21ff11">Yeah.</font>

565
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:54,378
<font color="#21ff11">Which makes spooky Victor Creel
like 70 years old.</font>

566
00:36:54,461 --> 00:36:55,795
<font color="#21ff11">Yep.</font>

567
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,300
<font color="#21ff11">So, he's a grandpa murderer</font>

568
00:36:59,382 --> 00:37:02,219
<font color="#21ff11">who can turn invisible
and lift people into the air.</font>

569
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:04,679
<font color="#21ff11">It doesn't make sense. I know.</font>

570
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,932
<font color="#21ff11">That's why I said
it was a shot in the dark.</font>

571
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:09,268
<font color="#21ff11">I know. I just thought
that by "shot in the dark,"</font>

572
00:37:09,351 --> 00:37:12,521
<font color="#21ff11">you were being modest or hiding
something super solid up your sleeve</font>

573
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,231
<font color="#21ff11">that you were gonna wow us with later.</font>

574
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,235
<font color="#21ff11">But this is
really, truly a shot in the dark.</font>

575
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,364
<font color="#21ff11">Like, we are snipers with blindfolds on
who've been spun around 50 times.</font>

576
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,534
<font color="#21ff11">Coming!</font>

577
00:37:25,617 --> 00:37:27,661
<font color="#21ff11">Hi. Sorry, we're in a bit of a rush.</font>

578
00:37:27,744 --> 00:37:30,121
<font color="#21ff11">Could we get the keys
to the basement archives?</font>

579
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,791
<font color="#21ff11">Of course. Give me one sec.</font>

580
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:35,378
<font color="#21ff11">Did I come off mean or condescending?</font>

581
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,170
<font color="#21ff11">- No.
- Right.</font>

582
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:41,592
<font color="#21ff11">Sorry. It's just, you seem annoyed.</font>

583
00:37:41,675 --> 00:37:42,885
<font color="#21ff11">You don't know me well.</font>

584
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:46,054
<font color="#21ff11">I don't really have a filter
or a strong grasp of social cues.</font>

585
00:37:46,137 --> 00:37:47,847
<font color="#21ff11">- Okay.
- If I say something that upsets you,</font>

586
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:51,768
<font color="#21ff11">just know that I know it's a flaw.
Believe me, my mother reminds me daily.</font>

587
00:37:51,851 --> 00:37:53,353
<font color="#21ff11">- Got it.
- All right, ladies.</font>

588
00:37:53,436 --> 00:37:55,940
<font color="#21ff11">Here you go. Have fun.</font>

589
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,900
<font color="#21ff11">Yep. We'll try.</font>

590
00:38:07,784 --> 00:38:09,119
<font color="#21ff11">Max. Hi.</font>

591
00:38:09,202 --> 00:38:11,746
<font color="#21ff11">Hi. I'm so sorry
to bother you over break,</font>

592
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,166
<font color="#21ff11">but… do you have a minute to talk?</font>

593
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:18,128
<font color="#21ff11">Um, yeah, of course. Of course.</font>

594
00:38:21,715 --> 00:38:23,634
<font color="#21ff11">Okay. She's in.</font>

595
00:38:24,217 --> 00:38:26,137
<font color="#21ff11">I'm missing collarbones, not eyes.</font>

596
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:29,681
<font color="#21ff11">So,</font>

597
00:38:30,932 --> 00:38:32,934
<font color="#21ff11">we gonna talk about… it?</font>

598
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,188
<font color="#21ff11">Huh? Sorry, talk about what?</font>

599
00:38:36,938 --> 00:38:39,483
<font color="#21ff11">Your temporary insanity earlier today</font>

600
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,985
<font color="#21ff11">when you basically
threw yourself at Nance?</font>

601
00:38:42,652 --> 00:38:45,489
<font color="#21ff11">- That's not what happened.
- Pretty sure that's what happened.</font>

602
00:38:45,572 --> 00:38:47,867
<font color="#21ff11">It was public.
There were a lot of witnesses.</font>

603
00:38:47,949 --> 00:38:50,036
<font color="#21ff11">You implying I still
have a thing for Nance?</font>

604
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,202
<font color="#21ff11">No. I'm not implying.</font>

605
00:38:51,286 --> 00:38:55,958
<font color="#21ff11">I'm stating. And, as it relates
to your steadfast refusal to date Robin,</font>

606
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:58,168
<font color="#21ff11">it's pretty much
the only logical explanation.</font>

607
00:38:58,251 --> 00:38:59,920
<font color="#21ff11">That's not the only one.</font>

608
00:39:00,003 --> 00:39:01,547
<font color="#21ff11">And as for Nance,</font>

609
00:39:02,297 --> 00:39:04,592
<font color="#21ff11">I was just trying to protect a friend.</font>

610
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:07,552
<font color="#21ff11">- A friend, Henderson. Okay?
- Okay.</font>

611
00:39:07,635 --> 00:39:10,264
<font color="#21ff11">Don't wanna find her
with her eyes sucked out of her skull</font>

612
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:11,514
<font color="#21ff11">by this Vecna creep.</font>

613
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,934
<font color="#21ff11">You're bright red
in the face right now.</font>

614
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,686
<font color="#21ff11">I'm not. I don't wanna talk about it.</font>

615
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:17,896
<font color="#21ff11">I'll punch you so hard
your teeth will fall back out.</font>

616
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,815
<font color="#21ff11">Whoa. Too far.</font>

617
00:39:22,275 --> 00:39:24,362
<font color="#21ff11">- Not cool. Sorry.
- Not cool. It's okay.</font>

618
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,329
<font color="#21ff11">It's just,
with everything that's happening,</font>

619
00:39:33,411 --> 00:39:34,496
<font color="#21ff11">with all the murders,</font>

620
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:37,583
<font color="#21ff11">it's… it's making everything worse again.</font>

621
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,918
<font color="#21ff11">You've experienced trauma, Max,</font>

622
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:44,757
<font color="#21ff11">and when you keep your feelings,
your pain, bottled up the way you do,</font>

623
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,467
<font color="#21ff11">it doesn't take much
to trigger them again.</font>

624
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,012
<font color="#21ff11">So now, when it rains, it storms.</font>

625
00:39:50,929 --> 00:39:52,139
<font color="#21ff11">Yeah, I know.</font>

626
00:39:54,057 --> 00:39:57,811
<font color="#21ff11">Do you think you're ready
to talk more about that night?</font>

627
00:40:03,733 --> 00:40:04,860
<font color="#21ff11">Billy!</font>

628
00:40:07,237 --> 00:40:08,989
<font color="#21ff11">I live next door to where it happened.</font>

629
00:40:09,072 --> 00:40:10,157
<font color="#21ff11">I'm sorry?</font>

630
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,492
<font color="#21ff11">To where Chrissy was murdered.</font>

631
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,786
<font color="#21ff11">The cops asked me a bunch of questions.</font>

632
00:40:15,954 --> 00:40:17,414
<font color="#21ff11">Did they talk to you?</font>

633
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,333
<font color="#21ff11">I mean, I know you were seeing Chrissy.</font>

634
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,503
<font color="#21ff11">Max, you know I can't talk about Chrissy</font>

635
00:40:22,585 --> 00:40:23,711
<font color="#21ff11">or any other student.</font>

636
00:40:23,795 --> 00:40:24,838
<font color="#21ff11">Yeah, but, I mean,</font>

637
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:28,175
<font color="#21ff11">what if there was a serial killer
on the loose in my neighborhood?</font>

638
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,969
<font color="#21ff11">Did Chrissy mention anything?</font>

639
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,097
<font color="#21ff11">Anything about who might have done this?</font>

640
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,559
<font color="#21ff11">Max, I'm… I'm sorry,
I… I really can't discuss this.</font>

641
00:40:36,641 --> 00:40:39,769
<font color="#21ff11">You wouldn't want me talking
to any other students about you, right?</font>

642
00:40:39,853 --> 00:40:43,398
<font color="#21ff11">If I were dead and it would
help catch the killer, then yeah,</font>

643
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:44,817
<font color="#21ff11">I most definitely would.</font>

644
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,445
<font color="#21ff11">Well, let's leave that up to the police,
shall we?</font>

645
00:40:49,737 --> 00:40:51,364
<font color="#21ff11">Yeah, you're right.</font>

646
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,994
<font color="#21ff11">The police totally
have this under control.</font>

647
