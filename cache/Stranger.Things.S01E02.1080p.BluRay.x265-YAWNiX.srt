1
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,757
Is there a number we can call
for your parents?

2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,933
Where's your hair?
Do you have cancer?

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,226
Did you run away?

4
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,224
- Are you in some kind of trouble?
- Is that blood?

5
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,106
- Stop it! You're freaking her out!
- She's freaking me out!

6
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,399
I bet she's deaf.

7
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:29,568
Not deaf.

8
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:32,944
All right, that's enough, all right?
She's just scared and cold.

9
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,413
Here, these are clean.
Okay?

10
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,376
No, no, no!

11
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,086
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

12
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,423
- See over there?
- That's the bathroom.

13
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,509
Privacy.
Get it?

14
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,903
You don't want it closed?

15
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,735
No.

16
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,913
Oh, so you can speak.

17
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,207
Okay, well...

18
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:28,287
Um, how about we just keep the door...

19
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,131
just like this.

20
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,342
- Is that better?
- Yes.

21
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:43,093
- This is mental.
- At least she can talk.

22
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,054
She said "no" and "yes."
Your three-year-old sister says more.

23
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,855
She tried to get naked.

24
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,557
There's something
seriously wrong with her.

25
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:53,144
- Like, wrong in the head.
- She just went like...

26
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,695
I bet she escaped from Pennhurst.

27
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,398
- From where?
- The nuthouse in Kerley County.

28
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,108
- You got a lot of family there?
- Bite me.

29
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,194
Seriously though, think about it.

30
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,326
That would explain her shaved hair
and why she's so crazy.

31
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,532
Why she went like...

32
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,414
She's an escapee is the point.
She's probably a psycho.

33
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,495
- Like Michael Myers.
- Exactly!

34
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,171
We should've never brought her here.

35
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,589
So you just wanted to leave her
out in that storm?

36
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,418
Yes! We went out to find Will,
not another problem.

37
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,218
- I think we should tell your mom.
- I second that.

38
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:20,262
- Who's crazy now?
- How is that crazy?

39
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,932
'Cause, we weren't supposed to be
out tonight, remember?

40
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,351
- So?
- So if I tell my mom

41
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,269
and she tells your mom
and your mom...

42
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,598
- Oh, man.
- Our houses become Alcatraz.

43
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,274
Exactly.
We'll never find Will.

44
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,567
All right, here's the plan.
She sleeps here tonight.

45
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,774
- You're letting a girl...
- Just listen!

46
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,824
In the morning,
she sneaks around my house,

47
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,948
goes to the front door
and rings my doorbell.

48
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,825
My mom will answer and know
exactly what to do.

49
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,157
She'll send her back to Pennhurst
or wherever she comes from.

50
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,366
We'll be totally in the clear.

51
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,247
And tomorrow night, we go back out.

52
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,704
And this time, we find Will.

53
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,336
There you go.
There's my sleeping bag.

54
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,716
You really think she's psycho?

55
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,389
Wouldn't want her in my house.

56
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,436
Mental.

57
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,770
Hey, um, I never asked your name.

58
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,484
Is that real?

59
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,574
Sorry, I've just... never seen
a kid with a tattoo before.

60
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,206
What's it mean?
Eleven?

61
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,665
That's your name?

62
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,839
Eleven. Okay.

63
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,263
Um, well, my name's Mike.
Short for Michael.

64
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,558
Maybe we can call you "El."
Short for Eleven.

65
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,017
Um, well, okay.

66
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,183
'Night, El.

67
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:58,732
'Night, Mike.

68
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,808
All right, Mom.
Breakfast is ready.

69
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,686
- What? No, be careful of the poster.
- Yeah, okay. All right.

70
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,642
- I can't eat.
- I just need you to eat, Mom.

71
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:05,150
Listen. Listen, the Xerox place
opens in, like, 30 minutes.

72
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,651
- Yeah.
- And I don't want you to go alone...

73
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,822
No, I know.
I told you, I got it.

74
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,322
So I'm gonna have Karen take you,
'cause I should be here.

75
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,779
- Okay.
- We need to make, what, 200, 300 copies?

76
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:13,989
- How much is a copy?
- Yeah, okay.

77
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,163
- Okay, Mom. Mom.
- 10 cents?

78
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,867
- If we... Ten cents...
- Mom. Mom. Mom!

79
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,203
You can't get like this, okay?

80
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,710
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

81
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,591
We've been waiting six hours.

82
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,387
I know.
I came as soon as I could.

83
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,055
Six hours.

84
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,259
A little bit of trust here, all right?

85
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,311
We've been searching all night.
Went all the way to Cartersville.

86
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,059
- And?
- Nothing.

87
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:40,560
God.

88
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,647
Flo says you got a phone call?

89
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,900
Oh, yeah.

90
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,821
Storm barbecued this pretty good.

91
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,329
- The storm?
- What else?

92
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,331
You're saying that that's not weird?

93
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,083
No, it's weird.

94
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,665
Can we, like, trace who made the call?
Contact the...

95
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,751
No, it doesn't work like that.

96
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,585
Now, uh, you're sure it was Will?

97
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,341
Because Flo said
you just heard some breathing.

98
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,469
No. It was him.
It was Will.

99
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:19,517
And he was scared.
And then something...

100
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,440
It was probably just a prank call.
It was somebody trying to scare you.

101
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,266
- Who would do that?
- Well, this thing's been on TV.

102
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,525
It brings out all the crazies, you know.
False leads, prank calls, uh...

103
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,607
No, Hopper, it was not a prank.
It was him.

104
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,317
- Joyce.
- Come on, how about a little trust here?

105
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,616
What, you think I'm... I'm making this up?

106
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,163
I'm not saying that you're making it up.

107
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,707
All I'm saying is
it's an emotional time for you.

108
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:44,083
And you think I don't know
my own son's breathing?

109
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,788
Wouldn't you know your own daughter's?

110
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,847
- You hear from, uh, Lonnie yet?
- No.

111
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,307
It's been long enough.
I'm having him checked out.

112
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,064
Oh, come on!

113
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,236
You're wasting your time.

114
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,940
Hey, Hopper.

115
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,196
Hopper.

116
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,527
Let me go.

117
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,951
- I'm sorry?
- To Lonnie's.

118
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,909
You know, if Will's there,
it means he ran away.

119
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,416
And if he sees the cops,
he'll think he's in trouble.

120
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,212
He'll... He'll hide.

121
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,005
- You know, he's good at hiding.
- Yeah?

122
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,418
Well, cops are good at finding.
Okay?

123
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,174
Stay here with your mom.

124
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,471
She needs you.

125
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,818
Slow down, Mike.
That's disgusting.

126
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,155
Do a lot of studying last night?

127
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,828
Yeah, actually, I did.

128
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,285
What was your test on again?
Human anatomy?

129
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,080
Hey, what's going on?

130
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,591
Nothing.

131
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,388
Hey, you found my supercomm.

132
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,643
Pretty cool, huh?

133
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,603
I talk to my friends with it.

134
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,559
Mostly Lucas,
'cause he lives so close.

135
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,734
Signal's pretty weak.

136
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,111
Got you breakfast.

137
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,661
So listen, this is gonna
sound a little weird,

138
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,080
but I just need you to go out there.

139
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,283
Then go to the front door
and ring the doorbell.

140
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,915
My mom will answer and you'll tell her
that you're lost and that you need help.

141
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:53,124
But whatever you do, you can't tell her
about last night or that you know me.

142
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,208
Understand?

143
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:56,711
Really, it's no big deal.

144
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,922
We'll just pretend
to meet each other again.

145
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,596
And my mom, she'll know who to call.

146
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,095
No.

147
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,514
No?

148
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,349
No.

149
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,775
No... you don't want my mom to get help?

150
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,115
You're in trouble, aren't you?

151
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:26,995
Who...

152
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,123
Who are you in trouble with?

153
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,418
Bad.

154
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,590
Bad?

155
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,755
Bad people?

156
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,469
They want to hurt you?

157
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,971
The bad people?

158
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,399
Understand?

159
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,982
Michael, where are you?
We're going to be late.

160
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,783
- Let's go!
- All right, I'll be back.

161
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,611
Just stay here, okay?
Stay here.

162
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,373
When was this?

163
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,079
Last night.
Less than two miles away.

164
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,961
- And the boy?
- Still missing.

165
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,756
<i>It was my son.
I know it.</i>

166
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,133
<i>And I... I heard something else.</i>

167
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,589
<i>Something else?</i>

168
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,302
<i>It was like, uh,
some kind of animal.</i>

169
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,889
<i>I don't know.
Just please tell Hop to hurry.</i>

170
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:34,896
Will! Will Byers!

171
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,644
Will Byers!

172
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,487
- Will!
- Will!

173
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,320
Hey!
Anything?

174
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,325
You?

175
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,533
No, nothing but a dead phone.

176
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:51,617
Joyce?

177
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,454
About one step from falling off the edge.

178
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,960
She's been a few steps
for a while now, hasn't she?

179
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,791
Kid's missing, man.

180
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,171
Show a little class.

181
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,671
All right. Come on, let's go!

182
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,007
We got a lot of ground to cover.

183
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,513
The chief and her,
they've screwed before, huh?

184
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,726
Will!

185
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,272
That a "yeah" or did they...

186
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,401
- Will!
- Will!

187
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:28,367
"When alpha particles go through
gold foil, they become..."

188
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,994
- Unoccupied space.
- "A molecule that can..."

189
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,165
- Hey!
- I don't know,

190
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,538
I think you've studied enough, Nance.

191
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,665
- Steve...
- I'm telling you, you know, you got this.

192
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,088
Don't worry.
Now, on to more important matters.

193
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,133
My dad has left town on a conference
and my mom's gone with him,

194
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,632
- 'cause, you know, she doesn't trust him.
- Good call.

195
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,711
So are you in?

196
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,217
In for what?

197
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,048
No parents? Big house?

198
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,842
A party?

199
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,893
Ding, ding, ding!

200
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,391
It's Tuesday.

201
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,938
It's Tuesday!
Oh, my God.

202
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,356
Come on.

203
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,183
It'll be low key.
It'll just be us.

204
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,645
What do you say?
Are you in or are you out?

205
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:04,573
- Um...
- Oh, God. Look.

206
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,283
Oh, God, that's depressing.

207
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,740
- Should we say something?
- I don't think he speaks.

208
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,575
How much you want to bet he killed him?

209
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:15,910
Shut up.

210
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,710
Hey.

211
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,386
Oh, hey.

212
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,633
I just...

213
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,097
I wanted to say, you know, um...

214
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,098
I'm sorry about everything.

215
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,814
Everyone's thinking about you.

216
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,611
- It sucks.
- Yeah.

217
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,362
I'm sure he's fine.

218
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,118
He's a smart kid.

219
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,910
I have to go.
Chemistry test.

220
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:58,994
Yeah.

221
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,545
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

222
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,883
<i>Attention, faculty and students.</i>

223
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,431
<i>At 8:00 p.m. tonight, there will be
an assembly on the football field</i>

224
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,850
<i>in support of Will Byers and his family.</i>

225
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,053
<i>All are encouraged to attend.</i>

226
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:20,312
<i>Volunteer signups for search parties
are still available in the office.</i>

227
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,698
Oh, this is weird.

228
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,152
- He's never this late.
- I'm telling you, his stupid plan failed.

229
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,486
I thought you liked his plan.

230
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,913
Yeah, but obviously it was stupid,
or he'd be here.

231
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,956
If his mom found out
a girl spent the night...

232
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,534
He's in deep shit right about now.

233
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,291
Hey, what if she slept naked?

234
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,293
Oh, my God, she didn't.

235
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,591
Oh, if Mrs. Wheeler tells my parents...

236
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,544
- No way. Mike would never rat us out.
- I don't know.

237
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,847
All that matters is, after school,
the freak will be back in the looney bin,

238
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,051
and we can focus on what really matters,
finding Will.

239
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,409
<i>You want anything to drink?</i>

240
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,158
We have OJ, skim milk...
What else?

241
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,865
Um, we have...

242
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,535
Oh, this is my living room.

243
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,165
It's mostly just for watching TV.

244
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,794
Nice, right?
It's 22-inch.

245
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,966
That's, like, ten times bigger
than Dustin's.

246
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,681
- Pretty.
- I guess.

247
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,185
That's my sister Nancy.

248
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,892
And that's baby Holly.

249
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,352
And those are my parents.

250
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,145
What are your parents like?

251
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,192
Do they live close?

252
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,200
That's our La-Z-Boy.

253
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,154
It's where my dad sleeps.

254
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:59,956
You can try it if you want.

255
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,616
Yeah.

256
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:03,952
It's fun.

257
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,424
Just trust me, okay?

258
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,928
See? Fun, right?

259
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:19,847
Now you try.

260
00:16:19,871 --> 00:16:21,871

- Yeah, it's cool.

00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,935
All right, you can keep
the mix if you want.

- Yeah, really.

Joy Division, Bowie, Television,
the Smiths...

00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,613
It'll totally change your life.

267
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,361
Yeah, totally.

268
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,534
Where the hell are you, Lonnie?

269
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,077
I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to hear it.

270
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,919
This is ridiculous!
I'm so sick of your excuses.

271
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,374
He's not coming, is he?

272
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,461
Do you even like baseball?

273
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,805
No, but... I don't know.

274
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,883
- It's fun to go with him sometimes.
- Come on.

275
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,765
Has he ever done anything with you
that you actually like?

276
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,561
You know, like the arcade or something?

277
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:49,065
- I don't know.
- No, all right? He hasn't.

278
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,983
He's trying to force you
to like normal things.

279
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,108
And you shouldn't like things because
people tell you you're supposed to.

280
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,484
Okay?

281
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,991
Especially not him.

282
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,237
But you like the Clash? For real?

283
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,448
For real.
Definitely.

284
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,200
Joyce, I wasn't
expecting you today.

285
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,408
- I brought Jeffrey in to cover.
- I'm not here to work.

286
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,912
I...

287
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,120
The storm last night, I...

288
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,918
I need a new phone.

289
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,548
Okay, that looks like $22.56.

290
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,425
Uh, yeah, you know, uh...

291
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,801
I gave Jonathan all my money for...

292
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,679
for the copies for the posters.

293
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,144
Uh, I need an advance.

294
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,556
Yes, well, of course.

295
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,232
- Of course.
- Thank you.

296
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,648
Yeah, uh, I was thinking,
two weeks?

297
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,152
Um...

298
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:28,289
Yes, I understand, but, you know,
I have to pay Jeffrey for covering...

299
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,366
Donald.

300
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,669
I've been here ten years, right?

301
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:36,715
Have I ever called in sick
or missed a shift once?

302
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:40,169
I've worked, uh,
Christmas Eve and Thanksgiving.

303
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,676
I don't know
where my boy is.

304
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,973
He's gone.

305
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:49,099
I don't know if I'm...
gonna ever see him again, if he's hurt...

306
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,188
I, uh...

307
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,444
I need this phone
and two weeks advance.

308
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,816
And a pack of Camels.

309
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,127
<i>- We're all clear.
- Copy that.</i>

310
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,096
Extraordinary.

311
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,943
Ready are you?
What knows you of ready?

312
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,315
His name's Yoda.

313
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,523
He can use the Force to move things
with his mind, like this.

314
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:25,949
Whoosh!

315
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,410
Oh, this is my dinosaur, Rory.

316
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,329
Look, he has a speaker in his mouth
so he can roar.

317
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,377
Oh, these are all my
science fair trophies.

318
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,801
We got first every year.

319
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,595
Except for last year when we got third.

320
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,764
Mr. Clarke said it was totally political.

321
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,861
You know Will?

322
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:16,033
Did you see him? Last night?
On the road?

323
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,711
We gotta go.

324
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,300
I bought pizza
and macaroni.

325
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,926
- Okay.
- Okay.

326
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,553
Ted? Is that you?

327
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:37,854
Just me, Mom!

328
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,603
- Mike? What are you doing home?
- One second!

329
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,942
In here.
I'll be right back, okay?

330
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,740
Please, you have to get in,
or my mom, she'll find you.

331
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,784
Do you understand?

332
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,453
I won't tell her about you.
I promise.

333
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,905
Promise?

334
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,991
It means something that you can't break.

335
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,996
- Ever.
- Michael?

336
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,664
Please?

337
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,725
Pop!

338
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,276
Papa!

339
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,858
Papa!

340
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,280
No!

341
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,316
Papa!

342
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,743
No! No!
No!

343
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,578
Papa!

344
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,330
Papa!

345
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,831
Papa!

346
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:45,005
Papa!

347
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,251
Papa!

348
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:50,881
Papa.

349
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,894
I just... I don't feel good.

350
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,646
I woke up and my head,
it really hurt bad,

351
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,944
and my throat was all scratchy,
and I wanted to tell you,

352
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,396
but the last time I told you I was sick

353
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,402
- you made me go to school anyway, and...
- Michael.

354
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:14,326
- Yeah?
- I'm not mad at you.

355
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,700
- No?
- No, of course not.

356
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,955
All this that's been going on with Will,

357
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,162
I can't imagine
what it's been like for you.

358
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:27,964
I just...

359
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,501
I want you to feel like
you can talk to me.

360
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:34,338
I never want you to feel like you have
to hide anything from me.

361
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,548
I'm here for you. Okay?

362
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,351
Is there someone else here?

363
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,012
No.

364
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,516
Eleven?

365
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,192
Is everything okay?

366
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,314
El?

367
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,699
- Mike.
- Is everything okay?

368
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,121
Are you sure?

369
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:02,783
Promise.

370
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:42,322
- Will Byers!
- Will!

371
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,954
Whoa, whoa.
Careful, careful.

372
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:48,253
I need you alive for the next few days,
at least.

373
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,580
Oh, hell, I could survive that.

374
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,796
What?
George Burness made the jump.

375
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,219
And he was drunk as a skunk.
He did it on a $10 bet.

376
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:57,295
George is a liar.

377
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,257
You make that jump from this height,
that water turns into cement.

378
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,888
Hits you like a ton of bricks.
Break every damn bone in your body.

379
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,146
Nah.

380
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,019
<i>Chief, you copy?</i>

381
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,102
Yeah, Flo, talk to me.

382
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,939
<i>Hey, Chief, we got a call
from over at Benny's.</i>

383
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:16,864
<i>I think you need to get there right away.</i>

384
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,298
Ugh, Jesus!

385
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,597
Suicide?

386
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,558
Mmm-hmm.

387
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,735
Missing kid, suicide...

388
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:56,529
You must feel like a big city cop again,
huh, Chief?

389
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,985
Well, I mostly dealt
with strangers back then.

390
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,242
Benny was my friend.

391
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,321
Hello?

392
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,828
Yeah.

393
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,246
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, is Lonnie around?

394
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,328
- Yeah, he's out back. What do you want?
- To look around.

395
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,914
- Hey, what do you think you're doing? Hey!
- I'll be fast.

396
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,340
Hey, Will?

397
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:58,792
Will!

398
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,969
Will, you here?
Will!

399
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,100
Get off!

400
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,848
Damn, you've gotten stronger.

401
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,055
Will someone please explain
what the hell is going on?

402
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:16,314
Jonathan, Cynthia.
Cynthia, this is Jonathan.

403
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,393
My oldest.

404
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,357
- Come here.
- Get off me, man.

405
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,834
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just listen to me.

406
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,712
- You are out of your mind!
- She knows about Will.

407
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,508
What do you mean she knows about Will?

408
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:45,676
She pointed at him, at his picture.
She knew he was missing. I could tell.

409
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,632
- You could tell?
- Just think about it.

410
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,968
Do you really think it was a coincidence
that we found her on Mirkwood,

411
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,644
the same place where Will disappeared?

412
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,017
- That is weird.
- And she said bad people are after her.

413
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,396
I think maybe these bad people are
the same ones that took Will.

414
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:00,854
- I think she knows what happened to him.
- Then why doesn't she tell us?

415
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,070
Do you know where he is?

416
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,150
Do you know where Will is?

417
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,578
- Stop it, you're scaring her!
- She should be scared!

418
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,532
If you know where he is, tell us!

419
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,414
This is nuts.
We have to take her to your mom.

420
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,917
No! Eleven said telling any adult
would put us in danger.

421
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,419
- What kind of danger?
- Her name is Eleven?

422
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,001
- El for short.
- Mike, what kind of danger?

423
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,711
Danger danger.

424
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,517
No, no, no!

425
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,312
We're going back to plan A.
We're telling your mom.

426
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,991
No.

427
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,917
Take a look at this beaut.
Should've seen it when I got it.

428
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:58,870
Took me a year, but it's almost done.

429
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,749
Really?
You want to check up my ass, too?

430
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,259
I told you the same thing as
I told those cops,

431
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,927
he's not here and he never has been.

432
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:10,007
- Then why didn't you call Mom back?
- I don't know, I just...

433
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,638
I assumed she just forgot where he was.

434
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,264
You know, he was lost or something.

435
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,559
That boy never was very good
at taking care of himself.

436
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,767
This isn't some joke, all right?
There are search parties, reporters...

437
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:22,193
Hopper's not still chief, is he?

438
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:27,407
Tell your mother
she's gotta get you out of that hellhole.

439
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,449
Come out here to the city.

440
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,152
People are more real here, you know?

441
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,950
And then I could see you more.

442
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,584
- What, you think I don't want to see you?
- I know you don't.

443
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,707
See, that's your mother talkin'
right there.

444
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,081
She even know you're here?

445
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,124
Oh, great.

446
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,926
So one kid goes missing,
the other one runs wild?

447
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,800
Some real fine parenting right there.

448
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:53,634
Look, all I'm saying is,
maybe I'm not the asshole, all right?

449
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,019
In case you forgot what he looks like.

450
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,353
He's kinda cute, hmm?

451
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,484
Maybe I'll trade you in
for the younger model?

452
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,487
Just doesn't make any sense, Chief.

453
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,451
You, uh, notice anything...

454
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,867
odd about him the last few weeks?

455
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,203
No, we're fixin' to go fishing
down the Etowah next Sunday.

456
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,414
I mean, he was lookin' forward to it.
I know that.

457
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,716
He got any enemies you might know about?

458
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,885
I mean, people might not want him around?

459
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,963
The exes didn't like him much.
That's for sure, but...

460
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,510
nah.

461
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:38,345
- When was the last time you saw him?
- Yesterday. Lunch, same as always.

462
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,680
- Just you and the boys?
- Yep.

463
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:42,857
Me and Henry and...

464
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,690
Well, there was this, uh, this kid.

465
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:48,813
No kid did this.

466
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:50,819
Kid?

467
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,701
What are you talking about?

468
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:58,703
Yeah. At lunch, uh,
there was this boy that, uh...

469
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,535
I mean, he was trying to steal
food out of Benny's kitchen.

470
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:02,994
Can you imagine that?

471
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,002
This kid...

472
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,751
what'd he look like?

473
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,218
Well, he was about yea high.
You know, tiny like.

474
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,674
I didn't get a good look at him, though.
He was back in the kitchen.

475
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,259
He look like this?

476
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,930
Oh, no, that's...
That's Lonnie's missin' kid.

477
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,060
No. This was a different kid.

478
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,608
This one had really short hair.

479
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,777
I mean, it was buzzed
nearly down to the scalp.

480
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,480
Yeah, well, let's...
You know, let's forget about the haircut.

481
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:33,658
I mean, if this kid had a buzz cut...

482
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,109
could it be Lonnie's kid?

483
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:38,158
Well, I...
I didn't get a good look at him.

484
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,124
About the right height, though.

485
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,872
I mean, could've been.

486
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,625
Yeah, that's...

487
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,705
Could've been.

488
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,927
Because I don't want to go by myself.

489
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:57,178
Barb...
Barb, it's not rocket science.

490
00:32:57,267 --> 00:33:00,681
You just tell your parents you're gonna
stay at my place afterwards.

491
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,604
No, tell them we're... studying.

492
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,397
Nancy! Dinner!

493
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,191
Coming!

494
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:09,940
Look, I gotta go.
I'll see you in an hour.

495
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,280
Something wrong with the meatloaf?

496
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,205
Oh, no, I had two
bologna sandwiches for lunch.

497
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:27,995
I don't know why.

498
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,955
Me, too.

499
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,509
- It's delicious, Mommy.
- Thank you, sweetie.

500
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,962
So, there's this...

501
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,548
special assembly thing tonight...

502
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,929
for Will at the school field.

503
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,055
Barb's driving.

504
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,262
Why am I just hearing about this?

505
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,184
I thought you knew.

506
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,358
I told you, I don't want you
out after dark until Will is found.

507
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,778
I know, I know, but it'd be
super weird if I'm not there.

508
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,901
I mean, everyone's going.

509
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,073
Just... be back by 10:00.

510
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:02,659
Why don't you take the boys, too?

511
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,956
- No!
- Mmm-mmm.

512
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,710
Don't you think you should be there?
For Will?

513
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,000
Sorry. Spasm.

514
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,131
Oh...

515
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,432
It's okay, Holly.

516
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,384
- It's just a loud noise.
- Nice.

517
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,350
Will!

518
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,651
Better come out, buddy.
Will, where are ya?

519
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:45,866
Hey, you think
Earl really saw Will?

520
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,918
I mean, what's he doin'
with a shaved head?

521
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,586
And stealing food from Benny?

522
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:53,335
Tell you what,
when we find him, we'll ask.

523
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,041
Can't ask a corpse questions.

524
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:56,922
Hold up!

525
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,469
You got something?

526
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,758
- Hey, what do you got?
- Not sure.

527
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,809
Maybe nothing.

528
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,761
I found this. In there.

529
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,647
No way a kid
crawls through there.

530
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,404
I don't know...

531
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,856
a scared enough one might.

532
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,317
His brother said he was good at hiding.

533
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:58,437
El?

534
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:07,204
No adults.
Just us and some meatloaf.

535
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:13,787
Don't worry.
They won't tell anyone about you.

536
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,293
They promise.
Right?

537
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,921
We never would've upset you
if we knew you had superpowers.

538
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,297
Ow!

539
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:26,008
What Dustin is trying to say
is that they were just scared... earlier.

540
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,137
That's all.

541
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,184
We just wanted to find our friend.

542
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:30,761
"Friend"?

543
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,723
Yeah, friend.
Will?

544
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:37,106
What is "friend"?

545
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,606
Is she serious?

546
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,693
Um, a friend...

547
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:44,525
Is someone that you'd do anything for.

548
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,737
You lend them your cool stuff,
like comic books and trading cards.

549
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:49,117
And they never break a promise.

550
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,119
- Especially when there's spit.
- Spit?

551
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,953
- A spit swear means...
- you never break your word.

552
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,457
It's a bond.

553
00:36:56,548 --> 00:37:00,212
That's super important, because friends...

554
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,543
they tell each other things.

555
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,378
Things that parents don't know.

556
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,263
- Barbara, pull over.
- What?

557
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,642
Pull over!

558
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,226
What are we doing here?

559
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,902
His house is three blocks away.

560
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,446
We can't park in the driveway.

561
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:23,568
Are you serious?

562
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,774
Yeah, the neighbors might see.

563
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,576
This is so stupid.
I'm just gonna drop you off.

564
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,494
Calm down, Barb.
Come on.

565
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,119
You promised that you'd go.
You're coming.

566
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,449
We're gonna have a great time.

567
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,079
He just wants to get in your pants.

568
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,786
No, he doesn't.

569
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,167
Nance... seriously.

570
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,337
He invited you to his house.

571
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,335
His parents aren't home.

572
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,675
Come on, you are not this stupid.

573
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,757
Tommy H. and Carol are gonna be there.

574
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,968
Tommy and Carol have been
having sex since, like, seventh grade.

575
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,891
It'll probably just be like a big orgy.

576
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,940
- Gross.
- I'm serious!

577
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,312
All right, well...

578
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,563
you can be like my guardian. All right?

579
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,114
Make sure I don't get drunk
and do anything stupid.

580
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,191
Ugh.

581
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,745
Is that a new bra?

582
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:14,532
No.

583
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,967
Barb, chill.

584
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,257
I'm chill.

585
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:37,722
Hello, ladies.

586
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,305
What are you doing?

587
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,799
It's freezing.

588
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,057
You ever feel cursed?

589
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:27,192
You know, the last person to go
missing here was in, uh...

590
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,949
the summer of '23.

591
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,907
The last suicide was the fall of '61.

592
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,669
When'd the last person freeze to death?

593
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:48,383
Hey, come back inside.

594
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,461
- Warm me up. Come.
- Just...

595
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,681
Just give me a minute out here.

596
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,118
What's the weirdo doing?

597
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,213
El?

598
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:44,897
Will.

599
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,558
Superpowers.

600
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,614
Did you see him?
On Mirkwood?

601
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,246
Do you know where he is?

602
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,846
I don't understand.

603
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:18,974
Hiding.

604
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,722
Will is hiding?

605
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,023
From the bad men?

606
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,608
Then from who?

607
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,797
Where are you?

608
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,162
One! Two!

609
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,585
- Three!
- Stop it, Tommy! Don't!

610
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:13,664
You're such an asshole, Tommy.

611
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,605
Is that supposed to impress me?

612
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,484
- You're not?
- You are a cliché, you do realize that?

613
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,606
You are a cliché.

614
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,109
What with your...
your grades and your band practice.

615
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,610
I'm so not in band.

616
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,613
Okay, party girl. Why don't you just, uh,
show us how it's done, then?

617
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:43,693
Okay.

618
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:52,749
- You gotta make a little hole right in...
- I got it.

619
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,047
Yeah, she's smart, you douche!

620
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,796
Chug, chug, chug.

621
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,346
Chug. Chug. Chug.

622
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,144
Barb, you wanna try?

623
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,525
What? No.

624
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,856
No, I don't want to. Thanks.

625
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,066
- Come on.
- Yeah...

626
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,492
- Come on. Yeah.
- Nance, I don't want to.

627
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,285
- It's fun! Just give it a...
- Nance...

628
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,033
Just... Just give it a shot.

629
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,286
Okay.

630
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:36,998
So you just...

631
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,758
- Gnarly.
- Are you okay?

632
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,305
- Yeah.
- Barb, you're bleeding.

633
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,383
I'm fine.
Where's your bathroom?

634
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,059
Oh, it's... It's, uh, down past
the kitchen, to the left.

635
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:51,682
Okay. Thanks.

636
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,186
Oh.

637
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:08,195
Oh, my, God!
What the hell, Tommy?

638
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,279
No!

639
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,829
Whoo!

640
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,036
Hello?

641
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:58,837
Hello.

642
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:00,755
Who is this?

643
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,086
Will?

644
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:10,299
Will, it's me.

645
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:12,180
Talk to me.

646
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,636
I'm here.

647
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,561
Just tell me where you are, honey.

648
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:17,605
I can hear you. Please.

649
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,271
<i>Mom?</i>

650
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:21,727
Will!

651
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:25,440
Yes, it's me.
It's me.

652
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,820
Where are you? Where are you?
Just talk to me...

653
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,528
Oh, no, no!

654
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,239
No!

655
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,041
Oh, no! No, no...

656
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,208
No!

657
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,171
No!

658
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:07,064
Jonathan?

659
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:10,692
What...

660
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,437
Will...

661
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:57,205
Will...

662
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,996
Will, is that you?

663
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,641
Oh, my God.

664
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:28,945
Oh, God...

665
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,026
Oh, my God...

666
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,113
I'm freezing.

667
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:24,497
Hmm... well, I hear his
mom's room has a fireplace.

668
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:25,828
- Are you kidding?
- Oh, yeah?

669
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,254
Okay, well, you know,
you are cleaning the sheets.

670
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,581
- You all right?
- Yeah.

671
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,338
Yeah?
Come on, let's get you some dry clothes.

672
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,224
Nance!

673
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,642
Nancy.

674
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:43,311
Where are you going?

675
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,433
Nowhere.

676
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,355
Just... upstairs.

677
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:48,058
To change.

678
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:50,895
I... fell in the pool.

679
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,523
Why don't you go ahead and go home.

680
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:57,985
I'll just... I'll get a ride or something.

681
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,444
Nance...

682
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:01,913
Barb...

683
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,581
I'm fine.

684
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,080
This isn't you.

685
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:08,829
I'm fine.

686
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:12,507
Just... go ahead and go home, okay?

687
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,645
Thanks.

688
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,988
Um...

689
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,695
some privacy, maybe?

690
00:50:41,789 --> 00:50:43,280
Oh...

691
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,990
Yeah, right.
Sorry.

692
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:50,791
Steve?

693
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,014
Damn.

694
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,556
Shut up.

695
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:17,580
