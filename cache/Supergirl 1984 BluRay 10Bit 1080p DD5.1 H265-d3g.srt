1
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:14,590
- Hello to you.
- Hello to you.

2
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:16,008
I hope you're fine.

3
00:03:19,303 --> 00:03:22,389
<i>Who knows the
electron</i> wave <i>functions</i>

4
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:24,975
<i>for Kryptonian
covalent bonding?</i>

5
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:26,352
Sorry.

6
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,563
Leah.

7
00:03:29,772 --> 00:03:31,440
<i>The cube root
of the wavelength...</i>

8
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:34,443
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

9
00:03:35,987 --> 00:03:37,405
- Hello, Kara.
- Hello to you.

10
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:49,083
<i>Oh, it is beautiful.</i>

11
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:51,544
What's that gonna be, Zaltar?

12
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:54,547
I think...a tree.

13
00:03:55,381 --> 00:03:56,632
A tree.

14
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,717
What is a tree?

15
00:03:58,926 --> 00:04:01,178
A lovely thing
which grows on Earth.

16
00:04:01,387 --> 00:04:03,722
Earth? You mean
where my cousin went?

17
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:05,849
Hmm, and to where,
one day soon perhaps

18
00:04:06,058 --> 00:04:07,976
I might venture as well.

19
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:10,771
I don't believe you. How?

20
00:04:11,147 --> 00:04:15,151
- In that. Through there.
- The binary chute?

21
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:17,152
But you'd never survive
the pressure. It'll destroy--

22
00:04:17,361 --> 00:04:19,696
In that I can.
Zip-zap and I'm gone.

23
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:21,699
But you'd never
leave us, Zaltar.

24
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:24,535
- You'd <i>never</i> leave Argo <i>City.</i>
- Indeed, I might, Kara.

25
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:26,203
Too much of a good thing here.

26
00:04:26,662 --> 00:04:31,041
Perhaps I'll try Saturn instead.
Yes, I think I might.

27
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,544
Saturn is...is that
further away than Earth?

28
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:35,671
Silly question.

29
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,173
Didn't you study six-dimensional
geometry at school?

30
00:04:38,382 --> 00:04:39,758
Do they not teach
anything anymore?

31
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:43,220
Well, of course they do.
I know the equations.

32
00:04:47,475 --> 00:04:48,976
I just can't see
them in my head.

33
00:04:49,393 --> 00:04:53,188
Most great artists find
mathematics troublesome, Kara.

34
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:56,692
- Only use your imagination.
- Mm-hm.

35
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:58,819
Saturn and Earth
are in outer space

36
00:04:59,028 --> 00:05:02,573
but we, we are in inner space.

37
00:05:02,782 --> 00:05:05,451
Our city has two great
power sources.

38
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:07,703
This is one of them. Look.

39
00:05:13,376 --> 00:05:15,503
An omegahedron.

40
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:17,672
The Guardians let you have it?

41
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,091
Not exactly. I borrowed it.

42
00:05:21,676 --> 00:05:23,511
You stole it. Oh, Zaltar,
they're gonna--

43
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:27,723
No, borrowed it...
for the afternoon.

44
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:33,020
- For inspiration.
- Inspiration.

45
00:05:55,418 --> 00:05:57,169
But I think that
I shall never see

46
00:05:57,378 --> 00:05:59,296
the branches
of a living tree.

47
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:03,050
Why? An omegahedron
can create life, can't it?

48
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:06,887
It can't, child, it can't.
Just the illusion of life.

49
00:06:07,346 --> 00:06:09,306
That's a fancy shadow
of the real thing

50
00:06:09,515 --> 00:06:12,309
which is the most we can hope
for on this lonely old rock.

51
00:06:12,518 --> 00:06:13,894
Kara.

52
00:06:15,187 --> 00:06:16,855
Kara, I've been looking
for you for ages.

53
00:06:17,064 --> 00:06:18,106
Oh, I'm sorry, mother.

54
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:20,443
- Zaltar.
- Alura, join us.

55
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:23,111
We're just inventing
miracles.

56
00:06:24,947 --> 00:06:27,324
Put your fingers here,
Kara, and press hard.

57
00:06:29,285 --> 00:06:31,245
Good. Now try it.

58
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,458
Let your imagination explode
and give it a try. Go on.

59
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,003
Zaltar, my-my husband
tells me you talk

60
00:06:39,211 --> 00:06:42,339
of leaving Argo City.
For where?

61
00:06:42,548 --> 00:06:44,675
Parts unknown.
It is, alas, a fact.

62
00:06:45,217 --> 00:06:46,635
You and Zor-EI
have a <i>life</i> here-

63
00:06:46,844 --> 00:06:48,303
<i>You've each other and Kara.</i>

64
00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:52,182
<i>But, Zaltar, you
founded this city. It's yours.</i>

65
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:55,727
As far as the eye can see,
right to the veil, smack

66
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,564
and then what?
What is beyond?

67
00:06:58,773 --> 00:07:01,275
<i>Alura, I cannot contain
myself to Argo City only.</i>

68
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:03,611
<i>My head is boiling with ideas.</i>

69
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:06,530
<i>My imagination is too vast,
it's uncontrollable.</i>

70
00:07:06,864 --> 00:07:09,241
If you want my opinion, Zaltar,
you're starting to repeat

71
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,245
yourself here with
all this airy, glittery stuff.

72
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:17,041
Exactly. That's why
I'm going to Venus.

73
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:20,586
Venus? When?

74
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:23,839
Tomorrow or the next day,
at the latest.

75
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:26,174
<i>Zaltar, have you
thought about this?</i>

76
00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:28,219
<i>It doesn't make sense to me.</i>

77
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:32,556
<i>I have thought intensely.
My mind is made up.</i>

78
00:08:21,313 --> 00:08:22,856
Kara! The power source!

79
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:30,151
Oh, Zaltar!
Save me. Please! Help!

80
00:08:31,115 --> 00:08:33,367
- No!
- Kara!

81
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:38,413
Zaltar!
Help! No!

82
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:53,095
You took the omegahedron.

83
00:08:53,345 --> 00:08:55,430
That's not correct,
I lost the omegahedron.

84
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:57,349
- No, father, I did--
- Shh, Kara.

85
00:08:57,558 --> 00:08:58,767
No matter who.

86
00:08:58,976 --> 00:09:01,395
Without it this city can't
survive more than a few days.

87
00:09:01,604 --> 00:09:04,773
Our lights will grow dim and
the very air we breathe so thin.

88
00:09:04,982 --> 00:09:06,775
I know. So I shall find it.

89
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:09,945
I shall go right to the end of
inner space and I'll return it.

90
00:09:10,154 --> 00:09:14,032
Impossible. How? No one can
leave Argo City and you know it.

91
00:09:14,241 --> 00:09:16,868
This is our universe and
you've destroyed it with a game.

92
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:20,623
- A childish game.
- I think it can be done.

93
00:09:21,248 --> 00:09:25,335
Through there, the binary chute,
in the traveler.

94
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:28,797
<i>Like</i> a <i>coward you
choose instant destruction</i>

95
00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:31,091
<i>while the rest of us
are doomed to stay here...</i>

96
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:57,242
Kara!

97
00:09:57,743 --> 00:09:58,952
Kara, no!

98
00:10:15,219 --> 00:10:17,179
- You lunatic!
- She'll be killed.

99
00:10:17,555 --> 00:10:18,973
Oh, no, she won't.

100
00:10:19,473 --> 00:10:22,309
She will be safe,
through the binary

101
00:10:22,518 --> 00:10:24,603
through the warp,
into another register.

102
00:10:24,979 --> 00:10:25,604
Another what?

103
00:10:25,813 --> 00:10:27,481
<i>Gravitational radiation</i>

104
00:10:27,982 --> 00:10:31,151
a pathway from inner space
to outer space.

105
00:10:31,902 --> 00:10:34,070
Then she'll never
be the same, ever.

106
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:36,156
At least she'll be alive.

107
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:39,409
And my fate is sealed.

108
00:10:40,119 --> 00:10:42,204
I've lost the omegahedron

109
00:10:42,913 --> 00:10:44,789
I must be sent
to the Phantom Zone.

110
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:47,585
<i>Your suffering will be short,</i>

111
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,254
mine...forever.

112
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,487
Some more
champagne, my dear Selena?

113
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:01,032
What are you thinking about?

114
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:07,330
It's such a pretty world.

115
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,961
I can't wait until
it's all mine.

116
00:12:12,461 --> 00:12:14,171
The only way you
can rule the world

117
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,757
is to become invisible,
my pumpkin.

118
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,092
Invisible?

119
00:12:20,511 --> 00:12:23,096
You'd almost know
how to make me invisible.

120
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:24,639
Oh, I do know.

121
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:27,893
<i>Take five black beans
and the head of a dead man,</i>

122
00:12:28,185 --> 00:12:31,605
place one bean in his mouth,
two beans in his eyes, then--

123
00:12:31,897 --> 00:12:33,648
Nigel, enough.

124
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:37,443
But it works. Then you can
get anywhere, do anything.

125
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:41,114
Nigel, how long have
we been together?

126
00:12:41,323 --> 00:12:43,533
Ooh. Months, darling.

127
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:46,703
Then why does
it seem like years?

128
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:51,625
Because you're so impatient.
You want everything yesterday.

129
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:54,127
It's a lifetime
to discover the secrets

130
00:12:54,336 --> 00:12:57,130
of black magic from
the ancient grimoires.

131
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,968
Holy cow.

132
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:29,579
I wonder.

133
00:13:37,296 --> 00:13:41,508
Immortality be upon this one.

134
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:46,759
She is a sharer
of the sun's everlasting life.

135
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:50,809
There will now
be no danger of death.

136
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:55,605
This world will
keep her forever.

137
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:58,275
What is it?

138
00:13:59,151 --> 00:14:01,111
What's going on?
Hey, what's going on?

139
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:03,947
I've just outgrown you, Nigel.

140
00:14:04,156 --> 00:14:05,740
These things happen.

141
00:14:06,283 --> 00:14:08,410
You can't treat me
like this, Selena.

142
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:10,912
Without me you'd
still be reading tea leaves

143
00:14:11,205 --> 00:14:12,748
at Lake Tahoe.

144
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:21,002
<i>Amsterdam and more. That's
TWA. Never has flying been easier.</i>

145
00:14:23,592 --> 00:14:26,511
You can't run out on me, Selena.

146
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,013
I've got the keys, sweetheart.

147
00:14:29,223 --> 00:14:31,808
<i>The president confirmed
reports that Superman has embarked</i>

148
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:34,352
<i>on a special peace-seeking
mission to a galaxy</i>

149
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:35,937
<i>scientists estimate may be</i>

150
00:14:36,146 --> 00:14:38,273
<i>several hundred trillion
light-years from our own...</i>

151
00:16:24,546 --> 00:16:26,548
Whoo-whoo!

152
00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:18,762
Now, here's the weather
from the general Chicago area

153
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,305
<i>increasing cloudiness with
the possibility of showers.</i>

154
00:19:21,515 --> 00:19:23,808
<i>Breezy but warm
with a high of 62.</i>

155
00:19:34,778 --> 00:19:36,362
Bianca!

156
00:19:36,988 --> 00:19:38,280
I'm home.

157
00:19:42,494 --> 00:19:43,495
Bianca!

158
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:45,205
<i>Wha-at?</i>

159
00:19:46,581 --> 00:19:48,124
Show your face.

160
00:19:51,086 --> 00:19:53,379
I have a surprise for you.

161
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,138
<i>They've turned
off the hot water again.</i>

162
00:20:02,347 --> 00:20:06,184
I'm really gonna have to kill
somebody down at the DWP.

163
00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:08,854
The only way we're gonna
pay our bills next month

164
00:20:09,062 --> 00:20:12,607
in this dump, is to just go
ahead and start our own coven.

165
00:20:12,983 --> 00:20:14,609
No longer necessary.

166
00:20:15,444 --> 00:20:16,778
I was reading in this book

167
00:20:16,987 --> 00:20:18,571
"The Witches Guide
to Heaven and Hell"

168
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,324
if you start your
own coven all you've to do

169
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:23,910
is charge five bucks a head,
minimal admission. That's great.

170
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:26,287
- Chicken feed.
- That's better than goose egg.

171
00:20:26,496 --> 00:20:29,165
What's in the Coffer of Shadow
there? Where's little Nigel?

172
00:20:29,374 --> 00:20:31,584
Nigel, my dear Bianca,
is history.

173
00:20:31,793 --> 00:20:33,044
Oh, yeah? How so?

174
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:36,756
The water department is history.
The car payments are history.

175
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:38,549
The mortgage
payments are history.

176
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,886
- How are the property taxes?
- History.

177
00:20:41,553 --> 00:20:44,597
The world is at last my oyster.

178
00:22:50,682 --> 00:22:52,183
Now, this I like.

179
00:22:52,684 --> 00:22:55,853
- Hello.
- "Hello," she says.

180
00:22:56,062 --> 00:22:58,606
- Well, hello to you, honeybun.
- Hello.

181
00:22:58,982 --> 00:23:01,359
I was wondering if you could
tell me where I am?

182
00:23:01,568 --> 00:23:04,737
What do they call this place,
Eddie? Lovers' Lane, isn't it?

183
00:23:04,946 --> 00:23:08,199
You got it in one,
Billy boy. Lovers' Lane.

184
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:11,161
Oh, no, you see,
what I meant was is

185
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:13,537
well, those lights over there.
What are they called?

186
00:23:13,747 --> 00:23:16,541
Check out the view
from back here, Eduardo.

187
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:17,708
Ah!

188
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:19,293
Stop that.

189
00:23:20,587 --> 00:23:23,673
You're, uh, Superman's
best friend, huh?

190
00:23:24,174 --> 00:23:28,674
No. His cousin. I've come here
to search for the omegahedron.

191
00:23:29,095 --> 00:23:32,556
It's a power source vital to
Argo City. That's where I live.

192
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:34,142
No kidding.

193
00:23:35,352 --> 00:23:36,895
Eddie and me here

194
00:23:37,103 --> 00:23:39,438
we're on a secret mission also.

195
00:23:39,981 --> 00:23:42,108
We're out looking
for a good time.

196
00:23:42,734 --> 00:23:45,945
And you just won
the brass ring, baby.

197
00:24:02,796 --> 00:24:05,006
Oh, she works out, huh?

198
00:24:05,215 --> 00:24:06,549
Why are you doing this?

199
00:24:06,883 --> 00:24:09,552
It's just the way we are.

200
00:24:17,143 --> 00:24:19,395
You shouldn't have
done that, baby.

201
00:24:22,148 --> 00:24:23,232
Come on.

202
00:24:30,323 --> 00:24:31,866
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

203
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:36,078
You really wanna play games,
eh, sweetheart?

204
00:24:36,454 --> 00:24:38,706
Come on. Come...

205
00:24:38,915 --> 00:24:39,874
Cw!

206
00:24:45,755 --> 00:24:46,797
Huh?

207
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:52,049
Eddie, I think
maybe we should

208
00:24:52,387 --> 00:24:56,265
kinda keep this to ourselves.
What do you think?

209
00:25:02,814 --> 00:25:04,565
Freddie, you little
devil. How are you?

210
00:25:06,651 --> 00:25:08,444
Fresh ammunition, everybody.

211
00:25:16,244 --> 00:25:19,205
Try telling your wife.
I need another.

212
00:25:19,748 --> 00:25:21,624
Where is it? Where's
the little mystery ball?

213
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:24,418
Let me have a peek.
Maybe I can shed some light.

214
00:25:24,627 --> 00:25:25,419
I hate light.

215
00:25:25,628 --> 00:25:27,921
Is it electrical?
ls it hot to the touch?

216
00:25:28,131 --> 00:25:30,216
- Where is it?
- Safe and sound.

217
00:25:30,592 --> 00:25:33,177
Go mix.
Leave me to my thoughts.

218
00:25:33,386 --> 00:25:35,638
Go mix? With these people?
You must be mad.

219
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:37,890
Who are they?
Wrinkly little wretches.

220
00:25:38,183 --> 00:25:40,810
These are my
foot soldiers, Nigel.

221
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:43,437
My army of the night.

222
00:25:43,688 --> 00:25:48,067
I'm considering nothing
less than world...domination.

223
00:25:48,526 --> 00:25:49,860
After you left me in the lurch

224
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,072
I saw something that should
worry you greatly

225
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,740
<i>if you're serious about
taking over this planet.</i>

226
00:25:55,575 --> 00:25:59,579
My secret was blue and red
and it knew how to fly.

227
00:26:00,371 --> 00:26:02,373
I've a secret too, Nigel.

228
00:26:02,749 --> 00:26:05,251
I have the power.

229
00:26:06,044 --> 00:26:07,336
Get that through your head.

230
00:26:08,088 --> 00:26:10,507
Oh, I bet they're
in for it now, eh?

231
00:26:11,174 --> 00:26:12,508
Count on it.

232
00:26:17,305 --> 00:26:20,558
I have in my time seen
a great number of things

233
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:22,059
even more impressive

234
00:26:22,268 --> 00:26:25,062
than a human cigarette
lighter, dear lady.

235
00:26:25,271 --> 00:26:27,439
To wit.

236
00:26:32,904 --> 00:26:34,238
What is that?

237
00:26:35,448 --> 00:26:37,908
Overreaching ambition.

238
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:39,077
Take heed.

239
00:26:41,037 --> 00:26:42,997
Touched a little
nerve, didn't I?

240
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:46,333
Hello.

241
00:26:47,043 --> 00:26:48,044
Hello.

242
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:50,255
The red toad
that lurks in the briars

243
00:26:50,463 --> 00:26:52,506
and brambles
is full of sorceries.

244
00:26:52,757 --> 00:26:54,508
There's a little bone
on the left side.

245
00:26:54,717 --> 00:26:55,342
A little bone?

246
00:26:55,552 --> 00:26:58,304
A little bone, which
if bound to a man stirs up

247
00:26:58,513 --> 00:27:00,097
the greatest lust.

248
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,518
- I wanna be rich and famous.
- Then stick with me.

249
00:27:04,185 --> 00:27:07,605
I was put on this earth
to thrill millions.

250
00:27:08,815 --> 00:27:10,983
Mmm, this is scrumptious.

251
00:27:11,192 --> 00:27:14,612
<i>Why don't we go somewhere
else and dance cheek to cheek?</i>

252
00:27:23,997 --> 00:27:26,374
Stop it, Selena!
That's not fair.

253
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:28,084
<i>Pick on me.</i>

254
00:27:36,426 --> 00:27:38,302
- Thanks.
- Hey, no sweat.

255
00:27:38,511 --> 00:27:40,971
- What happened?
- Oh, nothing much.

256
00:27:41,472 --> 00:27:43,891
Get out of my house, Nigel

257
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:47,478
and don't come slithering back.

258
00:27:47,687 --> 00:27:49,939
I'm warning you, Selena

259
00:27:50,148 --> 00:27:52,108
don't be so shortsighted.

260
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:11,043
Good morning.

261
00:28:18,134 --> 00:28:20,761
Have you got it, Lucy?
<i>Must</i> be near that oak tree.

262
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,097
- <i>Hurry</i> up.
- Found it, guys.

263
00:28:23,306 --> 00:28:26,976
<i>What are you doing?
You're supposed to find the ball.</i>

264
00:28:30,563 --> 00:28:33,399
<i>Come on, don't take all day.
You're holding up the game.</i>

265
00:28:33,608 --> 00:28:36,902
- Hey, it's your turn to bat.
- Let's go. Let's go.

266
00:28:37,612 --> 00:28:38,988
<i>Okay. Okay.
Let's play ball.</i>

267
00:28:39,197 --> 00:28:40,907
Alright, batter.

268
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:52,794
I couldn't make it.
I have to finish my...

269
00:29:13,481 --> 00:29:15,608
<i>Hey, toss the
ball back, will you?</i>

270
00:29:27,787 --> 00:29:30,039
Come on,
make <i>it</i> two in a <i>row.</i>

271
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:32,333
Play ball.

272
00:29:53,187 --> 00:29:54,605
- <i>Where have you been?
- With the principal.</i>

273
00:29:54,814 --> 00:29:56,357
Danvers is doing
his usual number.

274
00:29:56,566 --> 00:29:58,359
Jeez, another
barfy new student.

275
00:29:58,568 --> 00:30:01,279
They're really scraping the
bottom of the barrel these days.

276
00:30:02,947 --> 00:30:04,365
Hang in there, Danvers.

277
00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:05,991
Don't let them get to you.

278
00:30:07,452 --> 00:30:10,705
Thirty days. Semester
just started. You'll be...

279
00:30:11,205 --> 00:30:13,874
- Hello, I--
- Didn't knock.

280
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:16,377
Don't we teach you
manners around here?

281
00:30:16,586 --> 00:30:18,254
Don't we try to impress
on our young ladies

282
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:20,173
that animals
in the jungle never knock

283
00:30:20,381 --> 00:30:23,509
but Midvale girls always do.
Where you going? Come back here.

284
00:30:24,594 --> 00:30:25,344
Come in.

285
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,806
I forgot, I'm just not used to--

286
00:30:29,182 --> 00:30:30,474
Wait a minute.

287
00:30:30,975 --> 00:30:33,394
Wait just one second.

288
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:37,481
I have never before
in my life laid eyes on you

289
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,649
have I, young lady?

290
00:30:38,858 --> 00:30:40,526
- No, sir, I'm new here.
- New here?

291
00:30:40,735 --> 00:30:43,320
Obviously you're new if I've
never laid eyes on you before.

292
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,073
The question remains,
just who on earth are you?

293
00:30:47,617 --> 00:30:48,576
Umm...

294
00:30:51,454 --> 00:30:52,872
On Earth, I'm Lee.

295
00:30:53,456 --> 00:30:54,373
Linda Lee.

296
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:57,293
Where's your letter
of recommendation?

297
00:30:57,502 --> 00:30:58,336
Letter?

298
00:30:58,544 --> 00:31:00,420
I must talk to you, principal.

299
00:31:01,089 --> 00:31:03,591
- I am busy now.
- So are they, them.

300
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,968
All the little monsters
you admit to the place.

301
00:31:06,177 --> 00:31:09,096
<i>They have nailed
my desk drawers shut.</i>

302
00:31:09,305 --> 00:31:12,099
Never in all my years
as a school teacher...

303
00:31:12,308 --> 00:31:13,267
Come, Danvers.

304
00:31:13,643 --> 00:31:14,727
I will not be provoked.

305
00:31:14,936 --> 00:31:17,313
I will not let him
get to me this semester.

306
00:31:17,522 --> 00:31:18,940
I'll be strong.
Be strong.

307
00:31:19,148 --> 00:31:20,566
Be like a rock.

308
00:31:34,497 --> 00:31:35,539
What did you say
your name was?

309
00:31:35,748 --> 00:31:38,709
Oh, yes.
Linda Lee, huh?

310
00:31:39,043 --> 00:31:40,627
Yes, my cousin
probably wrote you.

311
00:31:40,837 --> 00:31:43,548
Umm, maybe you got
his letter under K for Kent?

312
00:31:43,756 --> 00:31:45,007
In your files.

313
00:31:45,216 --> 00:31:46,217
Kent?

314
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:47,510
Kent?

315
00:31:49,178 --> 00:31:51,013
It doesn't ring any bells.

316
00:31:51,472 --> 00:31:53,849
Doesn't even ring a...

317
00:31:56,018 --> 00:31:58,103
Oh, here it is.
Big as life.

318
00:31:58,479 --> 00:32:00,105
<i>"My dear Mr. Danvers,
I'm writing on behalf</i>

319
00:32:00,314 --> 00:32:02,024
<i>of a very
special young lady."</i>

320
00:32:02,608 --> 00:32:03,609
An orphan?

321
00:32:04,652 --> 00:32:05,778
Don't expect to be treated
any differently

322
00:32:05,987 --> 00:32:07,071
on that account, Miss Lee.

323
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,656
Oh, no, sir, I won't.

324
00:32:08,865 --> 00:32:10,449
One way or another,
we're all alone

325
00:32:10,658 --> 00:32:13,702
on this...miserable
little planet.

326
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,746
Yes, sir, I know.

327
00:32:16,247 --> 00:32:18,582
<i>Since your school records
were obviously lost in the mail</i>

328
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:20,626
you'll have to start
at the bottom.

329
00:32:20,835 --> 00:32:22,419
It's only fair
to the other girls.

330
00:32:22,628 --> 00:32:26,298
You'll have English, Latin,
math, biology, computing...

331
00:32:26,507 --> 00:32:27,674
All at once?

332
00:32:27,884 --> 00:32:29,010
...and chemistry.

333
00:32:29,218 --> 00:32:32,387
Idle hands are the
devil's playground. This way.

334
00:32:40,021 --> 00:32:41,939
- Man on the floor!
- Man on the floor!

335
00:32:57,538 --> 00:32:59,540
Open up, Lane, I know
you're in there.

336
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:02,876
I'm not decent,
Mr. Danvers sir.

337
00:33:03,127 --> 00:33:05,629
And you never will be either.
You little liar.

338
00:33:08,883 --> 00:33:10,843
Come on in. Come on in.
I haven't got all year.

339
00:33:11,552 --> 00:33:12,302
No.

340
00:33:12,553 --> 00:33:14,388
I'm supposed to have
a single this term.

341
00:33:14,597 --> 00:33:16,640
We don't always get
what we want, Miss Lane.

342
00:33:16,849 --> 00:33:18,892
Disappointments
thicken our skins.

343
00:33:19,101 --> 00:33:21,019
Who wants thick skin?

344
00:33:23,189 --> 00:33:24,481
I'm Linda Lee.

345
00:33:26,734 --> 00:33:29,111
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

346
00:33:30,696 --> 00:33:31,738
I'm Lucy Lane.

347
00:33:31,948 --> 00:33:33,658
Lucy Lee, this is Linda Lane.

348
00:33:34,283 --> 00:33:35,492
- No, it isn't.
- What?

349
00:33:35,701 --> 00:33:37,869
- She's Linda Lee and I'm--
- Lucy Lane.

350
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:39,830
You two know each other.

351
00:33:40,414 --> 00:33:41,706
Oh, no. We just met.

352
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:44,043
- When?
- Just now.

353
00:33:44,252 --> 00:33:46,671
But we've known each other
for years, haven't we, Linda?

354
00:33:46,879 --> 00:33:48,964
- Oh, gee, I don't think I--
- Oh, of course.

355
00:33:49,173 --> 00:33:51,341
The Daily Planet, of course.

356
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:55,096
Linda's cousin works there. And
your sister, what's her name?

357
00:33:55,304 --> 00:33:57,514
The one that's always
calling me and bothering me?

358
00:33:57,723 --> 00:34:00,225
- Lois.
- Ah, yes, that's the one.

359
00:34:00,434 --> 00:34:04,104
Anyway, show our new
Miss Lee around, Miss Lane.

360
00:34:06,148 --> 00:34:07,732
Oh, by the way,
she's an orphan

361
00:34:07,942 --> 00:34:10,319
but don't let her play
on your sympathies, hmm?

362
00:34:26,877 --> 00:34:28,378
So, who's your cousin?

363
00:34:28,588 --> 00:34:29,547
Clark Kent.

364
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,841
You're kidding me.

365
00:34:33,509 --> 00:34:35,761
Clark Kent's your cousin?
You're putting me on.

366
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,138
- You know him?
- Do I know him?

367
00:34:38,347 --> 00:34:39,806
Does my sister know him?

368
00:34:40,016 --> 00:34:43,602
- Now, that's the big question.
- Oh, I see.

369
00:34:43,811 --> 00:34:45,354
I guess, if they worked
at the same newspaper

370
00:34:45,563 --> 00:34:46,730
they must know each other.

371
00:34:46,939 --> 00:34:49,566
- Well...
- ls this where I'll sleep?

372
00:34:49,775 --> 00:34:52,277
Well, this is your bed,
but we don't sleep around here.

373
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,072
Nonstop excitement
in this dorm.

374
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:59,242
All the real dementals
are sent here.

375
00:35:00,536 --> 00:35:02,871
So, when's the rest
of your stuff arriving?

376
00:35:03,873 --> 00:35:05,708
I don't have any other stuff.

377
00:35:05,916 --> 00:35:07,584
What? It's all
in that little bag?

378
00:35:10,004 --> 00:35:13,757
Oh, well, you see, I have the
means to buy more, it's just...

379
00:35:13,966 --> 00:35:16,093
Well, I just haven't
had the chance since...

380
00:35:32,151 --> 00:35:35,696
- Do you know him?
- Superman? Sure.

381
00:35:36,489 --> 00:35:39,074
<i>My sister's got something
goin' with the big guy.</i>

382
00:35:39,283 --> 00:35:40,742
Listen, you can borrow
any of my clothes

383
00:35:40,951 --> 00:35:44,120
any time you want.
Just dig in and help yourself.

384
00:35:44,538 --> 00:35:46,623
Thank you.
You're very kind.

385
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:52,087
He's a real character.
A real hunk.

386
00:35:53,381 --> 00:35:54,548
<i>I'll introduce you
to him someday</i>

387
00:35:54,757 --> 00:35:56,133
<i>if we wind up getting along.</i>

388
00:36:01,764 --> 00:36:04,391
Now, then, focus
your tiny minds

389
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,727
on the kind of problem
that it used to take

390
00:36:06,936 --> 00:36:09,647
weeks of thought
before the computer.

391
00:36:10,147 --> 00:36:11,773
Even now it can take
a long time

392
00:36:11,982 --> 00:36:14,109
without certain algorithms

393
00:36:14,318 --> 00:36:17,738
which...if you behave
for two seconds

394
00:36:17,947 --> 00:36:20,240
I might reveal to you.

395
00:36:27,665 --> 00:36:30,709
Love, hate, love, hate.

396
00:36:31,585 --> 00:36:32,669
Love.

397
00:36:33,462 --> 00:36:34,880
<i>The cards have decided</i>

398
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:38,050
<i>people will do
anything for love.</i>

399
00:36:39,218 --> 00:36:41,011
They'll jump off
cliffs for love.

400
00:36:41,387 --> 00:36:43,722
<i>They'll drown themselves
like lemmings.</i>

401
00:36:43,931 --> 00:36:48,431
So...l'll make
everybody love me.

402
00:36:50,146 --> 00:36:51,313
Oh, no chance.

403
00:36:51,522 --> 00:36:53,815
You're an awful person,
honey, remember? Forget it.

404
00:36:54,024 --> 00:36:57,444
Use your imagination, pinhead.
That's what magic is all about.

405
00:37:00,948 --> 00:37:02,240
Why are we not moving?

406
00:37:03,576 --> 00:37:05,661
Because I'm in love.

407
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,748
<i>Come here,
you beautiful thing.</i>

408
00:37:12,334 --> 00:37:13,585
He's cute.

409
00:37:17,631 --> 00:37:19,382
Hey, What's going on?

410
00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:22,678
<i>Here's an exercise in big
numbers I want you to try.-.</i>

411
00:37:24,388 --> 00:37:26,390
<i>It's trying
to tell me something.</i>

412
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:28,809
Well, what?
That we're near danger?

413
00:37:29,018 --> 00:37:30,644
I don't know.
How do I know?

414
00:37:36,442 --> 00:37:39,778
- I know.
- Well, tell me.

415
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,197
My prince has come.

416
00:37:42,406 --> 00:37:44,658
Oh, no.

417
00:37:44,867 --> 00:37:46,159
I saw him first, Selena.

418
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,495
That's not fair.
I copied his number first.

419
00:37:48,704 --> 00:37:51,039
Well done.
Now, let's get out of here.

420
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,211
..-average size
<i>of</i> a Chinese family

421
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,006
<i>average age of death
and marriage and pregnancy.</i>

422
00:38:00,216 --> 00:38:02,593
<i>Use this equation to
compute the population of China</i>

423
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:04,512
<i>in the year 2040.</i>

424
00:38:04,887 --> 00:38:07,556
Linda...are you with us?

425
00:38:11,018 --> 00:38:12,185
Umm...

426
00:38:13,687 --> 00:38:15,647
- Yes, sir, I am.
- Oh, are you?

427
00:38:15,856 --> 00:38:17,065
Where, might I ask?

428
00:38:18,108 --> 00:38:19,859
W-well, here, sir.
On Earth...sir.

429
00:38:21,403 --> 00:38:23,822
How fortunate
for the rest of us.

430
00:38:24,031 --> 00:38:26,783
May I presume that whilst
you were staring at the wall

431
00:38:26,992 --> 00:38:30,578
and not at your terminal like
your other little friends here

432
00:38:30,788 --> 00:38:32,915
you were in fact,
hard at work

433
00:38:33,123 --> 00:38:36,167
solving this little equation?

434
00:38:36,627 --> 00:38:38,378
Oh, yes, sir, I was.

435
00:38:38,587 --> 00:38:40,255
- I mean, I was--
- Excellent.

436
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:41,673
The answer, please.

437
00:38:41,882 --> 00:38:45,510
Pay attention, class, Miss Lee
is about to enlighten us.

438
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,555
Five billion, two hundred
and seventy one million

439
00:38:48,764 --> 00:38:49,806
nine thousand and ten.

440
00:38:54,937 --> 00:38:57,898
Come on, let's get outta here
before he makes you stay.

441
00:38:58,566 --> 00:38:59,942
<i>Come on, hurry.</i>

442
00:39:05,865 --> 00:39:07,116
<i>Miss Lee.</i>

443
00:39:07,324 --> 00:39:09,367
- Oh, shit.
- Yes, sir?

444
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:11,662
Have you been going
through my papers?

445
00:39:12,288 --> 00:39:13,747
Of course not, sir.

446
00:39:13,956 --> 00:39:15,999
Then how do you know
the correct answer?

447
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:18,210
- How?
- I guess, I just--

448
00:39:18,419 --> 00:39:20,546
It's all this crazy weather
we've been having, sir.

449
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,674
<i>All the storms, shock
waves, electromagnetism.</i>

450
00:39:23,883 --> 00:39:25,926
It makes people smarter
than they are for a second.

451
00:39:26,135 --> 00:39:27,386
We gotta go, sir.

452
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:32,223
Oh, boy, thanks.
You know I gotta learn--

453
00:39:32,433 --> 00:39:33,976
How did you know the answer?

454
00:39:34,727 --> 00:39:37,146
I don't know.
Six-dimensional geometry.

455
00:39:37,354 --> 00:39:39,272
- I never could do it before.
- Yeah.

456
00:39:39,481 --> 00:39:41,399
Well, you want some
friendly advice?

457
00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:44,445
Don't go showing it off
'cause nobody's gonna like you.

458
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,071
I'll see you later.

459
00:39:54,413 --> 00:39:55,288
Ah!

460
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:58,500
Nice going.

461
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,378
You know she tripped
you on purpose?

462
00:40:01,629 --> 00:40:05,007
Absolutely.
She's retarded.

463
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:09,636
<i>There's not much time left.
Come on, let's go.</i>

464
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:13,640
You take it, Myra.

465
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:17,770
Hey, Myra, see if you can
put Lane out for good.

466
00:40:21,982 --> 00:40:23,858
<i>Come on, team. Come on.</i>

467
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:33,702
He)!' YOU guys alright?

468
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,538
- Oh, God. What happened?
- Yes. You alright?

469
00:40:37,081 --> 00:40:38,290
Myra, how'd she do that?

470
00:40:38,499 --> 00:40:40,209
- It hit her shoulder.
- I don't know.

471
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:43,378
Hey, you guys, did you see that
cute guy in the softball field?

472
00:40:43,587 --> 00:40:44,671
Oh, yes.

473
00:40:45,381 --> 00:40:47,466
With the black
hair and the big muscles?

474
00:40:47,675 --> 00:40:48,592
He was something else.

475
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:51,386
<i>- Did you talk to him?
- No, but I'm gonna.</i>

476
00:40:51,595 --> 00:40:52,929
<i>Talk? Who'd
waste time talking?</i>

477
00:40:53,138 --> 00:40:56,057
<i>He's working on the trees,
could be around for a while.</i>

478
00:40:59,353 --> 00:41:00,562
- Are they in?
- Yes.

479
00:41:04,566 --> 00:41:07,026
<i>Myra, you sure you
wanna go through with this?</i>

480
00:41:07,236 --> 00:41:09,363
<i>Hey, what's with you?
Chicken?</i>

481
00:41:10,155 --> 00:41:12,490
<i>Oh, boy, I'm really
gonna enjoy this.</i>

482
00:41:12,825 --> 00:41:14,993
<i>I can't wait to hear
them scream.</i>

483
00:41:15,202 --> 00:41:18,371
Why don't you shut off the hot
and give them an ice bath?

484
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,707
<i>Are you kidding me?
That's nowheresville.</i>

485
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:23,043
If you shut off the cold
you'll scald them.

486
00:41:23,252 --> 00:41:25,629
So they lose a little skin.
Serves them right.

487
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,173
<i>I want to see them suffer.</i>

488
00:41:30,384 --> 00:41:31,343
A-ah!

489
00:41:37,891 --> 00:41:39,058
I am wet!

490
00:41:39,393 --> 00:41:40,310
Cw!

491
00:41:42,229 --> 00:41:43,939
Don't leave me. Don't leave me!

492
00:41:46,984 --> 00:41:48,068
I hate you!

493
00:41:48,277 --> 00:41:49,736
You never looked better!

494
00:41:49,945 --> 00:41:51,696
We'll get you all!

495
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,871
What do you think?

496
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,707
It looks the same to me.
It's kinda dull.

497
00:42:04,793 --> 00:42:07,504
All you need is a couple of
streaks and your ears pierced.

498
00:42:07,713 --> 00:42:09,297
I can do it
free of charge.

499
00:42:09,798 --> 00:42:11,007
My ears what?

500
00:42:11,216 --> 00:42:13,092
Pierced. Like in you know,
I take a needle

501
00:42:13,302 --> 00:42:16,680
I heat it up and then I dab it
with some alcohol and zap.

502
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:18,307
All the guys go crazy.

503
00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:20,976
Because I've holes in my ears?

504
00:42:21,185 --> 00:42:22,769
What are you, putting me on?

505
00:42:23,187 --> 00:42:25,355
Sometimes I can't
figure you out, Linda.

506
00:42:28,692 --> 00:42:30,276
So, where are you
going this weekend?

507
00:42:30,486 --> 00:42:31,487
<i>Nowhere.</i>

508
00:42:31,695 --> 00:42:33,405
Nowhere? Well, you can't
stay around here.

509
00:42:33,614 --> 00:42:35,073
This place is depressing.

510
00:42:35,407 --> 00:42:37,033
<i>I mean, like the tombs.</i>

511
00:42:37,242 --> 00:42:38,785
<i>- Why'?
- Why?</i>

512
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,870
<i>What, were you born
yesterday?</i>

513
00:42:41,288 --> 00:42:43,123
This is a three-day weekend.

514
00:42:43,624 --> 00:42:45,167
A three-day weekend.

515
00:42:46,085 --> 00:42:48,670
So, listen. Why don't
you come home with me?

516
00:42:49,088 --> 00:42:51,590
<i>I only live about five miles
from here and I got this guy</i>

517
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:53,175
<i>coming up from Metropolis.</i>

518
00:42:53,759 --> 00:42:55,510
I think he knows
your cousin Clark.

519
00:42:56,136 --> 00:42:57,637
<i>His name's Jimmy Olsen.</i>

520
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:00,265
<i>I think he's real stuck on me.</i>

521
00:43:02,142 --> 00:43:04,102
Anyways, I could ask him
to bring a friend along.

522
00:43:05,104 --> 00:43:07,981
<i>- What are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.</i>

523
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,107
<i>Nothing.</i>

524
00:43:10,442 --> 00:43:12,694
No, I think I'm gonna
stay here and study

525
00:43:12,903 --> 00:43:14,654
get things organized.

526
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,075
Don't forget to
call me Saturday.

527
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,909
Just a sec.

528
00:43:21,829 --> 00:43:22,788
- Hey, Linda.
- Hi.

529
00:43:22,996 --> 00:43:24,789
I'll see you later
at Popeye's then, okay?

530
00:43:24,998 --> 00:43:28,042
- Alright, I'll try. I promise.
- You better. It's gonna be fun.

531
00:43:28,252 --> 00:43:29,127
<i>'</i> Bye-bye.
- Bye.

532
00:43:29,336 --> 00:43:30,253
Have a good time.

533
00:43:31,213 --> 00:43:32,714
Come along now, Lucy.

534
00:43:33,882 --> 00:43:37,093
- <i>Oh, mom, how are you doing?</i>
- <i>I've had</i> a <i>terrible week.</i>

535
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:48,498
"Take a spider off his web...

536
00:44:50,542 --> 00:44:53,628
"...and shut him up inside...

537
00:44:54,546 --> 00:44:57,799
"...two shells of a nut.

538
00:44:59,968 --> 00:45:03,137
"Now, boil the nut in oil

539
00:45:03,347 --> 00:45:05,432
"into which has been added

540
00:45:05,849 --> 00:45:07,475
"some of the web.

541
00:45:08,518 --> 00:45:12,355
"With a silver spoon,
put two drops...

542
00:45:13,607 --> 00:45:14,941
"...of the oil

543
00:45:16,068 --> 00:45:19,029
"into some water.

544
00:45:19,696 --> 00:45:20,571
Right.

545
00:45:21,281 --> 00:45:23,741
"He who drinks the water

546
00:45:23,951 --> 00:45:28,038
"shall be in love
with the first person he sees.

547
00:45:28,622 --> 00:45:32,042
"Uh, so long as the spider
is shut up in the nutshell.

548
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:35,087
"Or one day goes by...

549
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,755
...whichever comes first."

550
00:45:37,965 --> 00:45:39,800
Big deal, one day.

551
00:45:40,008 --> 00:45:41,884
Why don't you just use,
you know.

552
00:45:42,094 --> 00:45:43,970
I'm saving it
for bigger things.

553
00:45:44,263 --> 00:45:46,807
<i>Hi, folks,
you're missing the big</i> sale.

554
00:45:47,015 --> 00:45:49,809
<i>Country and western boys
from the Chicago area.</i>

555
00:45:50,143 --> 00:45:52,270
<i>Now to start off the hour.</i>

556
00:46:08,787 --> 00:46:11,331
Bianca, get the door.

557
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,959
Bianca!

558
00:46:20,382 --> 00:46:21,800
You rang?

559
00:46:22,009 --> 00:46:22,759
Hey, you!

560
00:46:25,721 --> 00:46:26,722
I said...

561
00:46:27,764 --> 00:46:28,890
...you rang?

562
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:30,016
Oh, yeah.

563
00:46:30,225 --> 00:46:31,517
How you doing?

564
00:46:33,061 --> 00:46:37,023
Uh, I'm looking for some person
called Mrs. Selena?

565
00:46:37,482 --> 00:46:40,776
- Madame Selena.
- Oh.

566
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:44,614
And you found her,
lucky boy.

567
00:46:45,615 --> 00:46:47,074
<i>Entrer.</i>

568
00:46:50,787 --> 00:46:52,872
You must be very popular
in the neighborhood.

569
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:54,999
I always see your truck
parked around.

570
00:46:55,208 --> 00:46:56,500
Oh, yeah.

571
00:46:56,710 --> 00:47:00,004
Yeah, I get a lot of repeat
business. People like my work.

572
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:03,425
Yes, I'm sure they do.

573
00:47:07,137 --> 00:47:08,972
- Wet your whistle?
- Huh?

574
00:47:09,181 --> 00:47:12,684
Oh, yeah, yeah, as a matter
of fact, I don't mind if I do.

575
00:47:41,254 --> 00:47:44,840
So, uh, where's
the one...ha-ha at?

576
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:45,967
It dropped dead.

577
00:47:46,176 --> 00:47:47,594
Where at exactly?
Uh, out back?

578
00:47:47,803 --> 00:47:50,222
We might get to know each other
a little more

579
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:54,930
before we dig in
and talk real turkey.

580
00:47:57,187 --> 00:47:59,898
Well, uh, see, I'm kind of
a private person, you know.

581
00:48:00,107 --> 00:48:02,609
I mean, I do my work,
I go home.

582
00:48:03,193 --> 00:48:04,611
- To your wife?
- No.

583
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,947
At the present moment in time
I'm currently enjoying

584
00:48:07,155 --> 00:48:08,990
a single status in
my personal life.

585
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:10,241
Cheers.

586
00:48:10,826 --> 00:48:12,410
Bottoms up, huh?

587
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:13,578
Bottoms up.

588
00:48:18,917 --> 00:48:22,211
I, I noticed you got a pretty
alkaline-looking soil out there.

589
00:48:23,004 --> 00:48:24,130
What I want...

590
00:48:24,798 --> 00:48:27,842
...are some houseplants
inside here.

591
00:48:29,177 --> 00:48:32,138
Something that goes well
with the house.

592
00:48:32,347 --> 00:48:34,349
This is a house?

593
00:48:35,016 --> 00:48:36,600
Of course, it's a house.

594
00:48:37,144 --> 00:48:39,771
There's the bedroom
over there.

595
00:48:42,983 --> 00:48:45,110
I think it's getting
dark in here.

596
00:48:47,154 --> 00:48:51,074
You know, what kind of plant
is gonna wanna...

597
00:48:51,283 --> 00:48:53,410
...grow in this dump?

598
00:48:54,953 --> 00:48:56,079
I don't know.

599
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:58,498
Shade plants.

600
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:00,417
- To us.
- Hm?

601
00:49:01,334 --> 00:49:04,462
And to the seeds
we'll plant together.

602
00:49:04,671 --> 00:49:07,340
Yeah, I'll-I'll drink...

603
00:49:07,549 --> 00:49:08,841
...to that.

604
00:49:12,387 --> 00:49:15,348
Hm, you probably killed him,
you know.

605
00:49:19,436 --> 00:49:21,813
Sleep well.

606
00:49:22,314 --> 00:49:23,606
And when you wake...

607
00:49:23,815 --> 00:49:27,944
...drown in my eyes
and be all mine.

608
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:33,867
If that's the goddamn
Jehovah's witnesses again.

609
00:49:34,075 --> 00:49:35,618
I'll get it.

610
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:44,710
Oh, hello, Nigel.
It's you.

611
00:49:45,545 --> 00:49:46,671
<i>Nice suit.</i>

612
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:48,548
Subtle.

613
00:49:49,382 --> 00:49:50,674
I want to see Selena.

614
00:49:50,884 --> 00:49:53,094
She's indisposed
at the moment.

615
00:49:53,303 --> 00:49:56,472
<i>Whoever it is,
we don't want any.</i>

616
00:49:56,765 --> 00:49:59,017
It's Nigel and
he's not going away

617
00:49:59,226 --> 00:50:01,061
until he talks to you.

618
00:50:03,021 --> 00:50:04,814
What the devil do you want?

619
00:50:05,023 --> 00:50:07,150
I want to make
a very serious proposal.

620
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:08,360
In that outfit?

621
00:50:09,736 --> 00:50:12,113
This is a leisure suit.
I've got three days off

622
00:50:12,322 --> 00:50:13,740
from those little beasts
at Midvale

623
00:50:13,949 --> 00:50:15,951
and I intend to let
my hair down.

624
00:50:22,749 --> 00:50:24,125
Uh-oh.

625
00:51:07,043 --> 00:51:10,087
That ball will not operate
at it's fullest

626
00:51:10,297 --> 00:51:13,508
until you internalize
your power, Selena.

627
00:51:13,717 --> 00:51:16,553
Some mosaic invocations.

628
00:51:16,761 --> 00:51:18,220
- Some what?
- Come again?

629
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:20,348
<i>Exactly, that's my point.</i>

630
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:23,602
You girls are rank amateurs
playing with fire.

631
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:26,604
Because we own the matches.

632
00:51:27,272 --> 00:51:30,608
I, of all people,
know a hustle when I hear one.

633
00:51:30,817 --> 00:51:31,859
Now, goodbye, Nigel.

634
00:51:32,068 --> 00:51:34,278
- It was nice talking to you.
- No, it wasn't.

635
00:51:34,487 --> 00:51:38,032
I <i>hate to seem pushy,
my fairest of the fair but--</i>

636
00:51:38,241 --> 00:51:39,659
A word of advice, Nigel.

637
00:51:39,868 --> 00:51:41,828
If I had your skin problems,

638
00:51:42,037 --> 00:51:44,539
I'd stop bothering people,
put a bag over my head,

639
00:51:44,748 --> 00:51:46,249
and go live under a bridge!

640
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:47,208
<i>Ouch!</i>

641
00:51:49,419 --> 00:51:51,337
There's nothing wrong
with my skin.

642
00:51:53,506 --> 00:51:55,341
That bitch.

643
00:51:57,886 --> 00:52:00,096
You know, some people.

644
00:52:01,848 --> 00:52:03,099
Where is he?

645
00:52:03,808 --> 00:52:05,768
Where is he?

646
00:52:14,778 --> 00:52:16,654
Where is he?

647
00:52:17,614 --> 00:52:19,782
Whoever he sees first,
he'll love with all his heart.

648
00:52:19,991 --> 00:52:21,575
What?
For a day tops, right?

649
00:52:22,285 --> 00:52:23,661
He was too young
for you anyway, you know.

650
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:26,914
No, I do not know.
Where is he?

651
00:52:32,837 --> 00:52:35,840
<i>Hey, I know that guy.</i>

652
00:52:41,888 --> 00:52:45,308
- Oh, the cable's out.
- Oh, what cable?

653
00:52:45,892 --> 00:52:47,476
This is a mirror.

654
00:52:49,187 --> 00:52:51,022
So, how come we could...

655
00:52:51,231 --> 00:52:52,690
...ever see him in it?

656
00:52:52,899 --> 00:52:55,192
That was magic, dammit.

657
00:52:55,694 --> 00:52:57,112
The power.

658
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,864
Oh, so make it happen again,
you know?

659
00:53:00,073 --> 00:53:03,951
L...can't make it happen again.
I don't know how I did it.

660
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,202
Oh.

661
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:08,164
Maybe, you should let
that thing out of it's box.

662
00:53:08,665 --> 00:53:11,084
Maybe, it's more powerful
if you let it out of it's box.

663
00:53:11,292 --> 00:53:12,251
- The box.
- The box.

664
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,128
- Where is it?
- The box?

665
00:53:14,337 --> 00:53:16,172
It's underneath the rug,
where you left it.

666
00:53:16,381 --> 00:53:17,799
Go ahead.

667
00:53:25,014 --> 00:53:26,306
It's stuck.

668
00:53:30,019 --> 00:53:31,687
This is not my day.

669
00:53:32,897 --> 00:53:33,772
It's stuck?

670
00:53:33,982 --> 00:53:35,191
How could it be stuck?

671
00:53:36,401 --> 00:53:38,027
It's growing.

672
00:53:38,862 --> 00:53:41,322
<i>How could it be growing?
It's made out of lead.</i>

673
00:53:53,626 --> 00:53:54,543
Oh.

674
00:53:54,753 --> 00:53:56,129
Too bad, there's no sound.

675
00:53:57,297 --> 00:53:59,299
How come there's no sound?

676
00:54:00,383 --> 00:54:02,176
Get off the road, turkey!

677
00:54:03,344 --> 00:54:05,262
Hey, dummy,
you wanna die?

678
00:54:05,889 --> 00:54:07,307
Smoking, stupid?

679
00:54:07,974 --> 00:54:09,266
You wanna kill yourself?

680
00:54:19,861 --> 00:54:21,445
<i>She saw</i> a <i>lawyer,
and now she's gonna file.</i>

681
00:54:21,654 --> 00:54:24,907
<i>I told her to take him for
every cent, clean him out.</i>

682
00:54:25,366 --> 00:54:27,326
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

683
00:54:32,248 --> 00:54:35,793
Here you go, everybody.
Who wants onion rings?

684
00:54:36,002 --> 00:54:37,044
- Yeah, here.
- Thanks.

685
00:54:37,253 --> 00:54:39,338
<i>- Some French fries?
- French fries are mine.</i>

686
00:54:39,547 --> 00:54:41,715
Chicken for myself.
Thank you.

687
00:54:41,925 --> 00:54:43,509
- Thanks.
- Side order tomatoes?

688
00:54:43,718 --> 00:54:45,052
Thanks for inviting me,
Lucy.

689
00:54:45,261 --> 00:54:46,595
I'm glad you could come,
Jimmy.

690
00:54:46,805 --> 00:54:49,057
- <i>You want</i> a <i>root beer?</i>
- <i>Yeah, thanks.</i>

691
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:52,101
Oh, there's Linda.

692
00:54:54,687 --> 00:54:56,105
Hey, Linda!

693
00:54:56,648 --> 00:54:58,608
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

694
00:54:58,817 --> 00:55:00,151
That's Clark Kent's cousin?

695
00:55:00,735 --> 00:55:01,652
Who's Clark Kent?

696
00:55:01,861 --> 00:55:02,611
<i>Is</i> that Linda?

697
00:55:06,115 --> 00:55:07,491
- Guess what.
- What?

698
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,451
There's this all-night party
tonight at Eddie's.

699
00:55:09,661 --> 00:55:11,079
He's the guy
with the tattoo.

700
00:55:11,287 --> 00:55:12,663
His folks are out of town.

701
00:55:12,956 --> 00:55:15,959
And the guy with the bow tie,
that's Jimmy.

702
00:55:16,709 --> 00:55:17,960
So, you wanna come?

703
00:55:18,169 --> 00:55:20,546
I don't know. I'm not
signed out for an overnight.

704
00:55:20,755 --> 00:55:23,382
So what? Go back, sign in
and climb out the window.

705
00:55:23,591 --> 00:55:25,551
Mrs. Murphy's drunk
as a skunk by now.

706
00:55:25,885 --> 00:55:27,261
Totally on another planet.

707
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:29,597
Oh, I don't know.
It just doesn't seem right.

708
00:55:29,806 --> 00:55:31,599
But that's why
it'll be fun.

709
00:55:31,808 --> 00:55:33,059
' Okay?
<i>'</i> Okay,

710
00:55:35,353 --> 00:55:36,937
Get off the road, buddy.

711
00:55:37,146 --> 00:55:38,230
<i>Hey, stupid.</i>

712
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:40,566
Look at that dingleberry.

713
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:42,443
What's a dingleberry?

714
00:55:42,652 --> 00:55:46,113
Hey, you, space cadet!
Get out of the street!

715
00:55:47,907 --> 00:55:50,826
- What is wrong with him?
- I don't know.

716
00:55:51,035 --> 00:55:52,453
He's probably on drugs.

717
00:55:52,662 --> 00:55:54,997
And he's gonna get creamed
if he's not too careful.

718
00:55:55,206 --> 00:55:57,833
- Hi. Jimmy Olsen, photographer.
- Oh, l-l'm Kara.

719
00:55:58,042 --> 00:55:59,209
- Who?
- Who?

720
00:55:59,419 --> 00:56:00,503
Oh, I'm...

721
00:56:01,254 --> 00:56:02,421
...concerned.

722
00:56:02,714 --> 00:56:04,549
Well, that if
we don't do something.

723
00:56:04,757 --> 00:56:07,342
You go out there, try to help
a guy like that and he's

724
00:56:07,594 --> 00:56:09,470
<i>probably got a gun
or a knife.</i>

725
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:10,805
<i>It's not too safe.</i>

726
00:56:11,014 --> 00:56:12,974
Hey, I'm starving.
Let's eat.

727
00:56:13,308 --> 00:56:14,642
Come on, Linda.

728
00:56:19,188 --> 00:56:22,024
Power of shadow.

729
00:56:23,735 --> 00:56:28,235
Bring him to me.

730
00:57:01,606 --> 00:57:02,815
Whoa.

731
00:57:06,653 --> 00:57:09,113
Look at that.

732
00:57:14,744 --> 00:57:16,245
Hey, get out.

733
00:57:21,542 --> 00:57:23,418
Look out. Watch out.

734
00:57:34,013 --> 00:57:34,888
MY Car!

735
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:44,000
You've never seen a tattoo
before, Linda?

736
00:58:44,208 --> 00:58:45,876
- Look!
- What's that?

737
00:58:46,085 --> 00:58:47,669
<i>There's somebody hanging
out of it.</i>

738
00:58:47,879 --> 00:58:49,547
<i>Doesn't look like
there's anybody driving.</i>

739
00:58:50,757 --> 00:58:53,301
Oh, my God.
It's a runaway.

740
00:58:58,222 --> 00:59:00,140
- Somebody's gotta do something.
- Hey, what's she doing?

741
00:59:00,349 --> 00:59:02,309
Lucy, be careful.
Lucy!

742
00:59:03,436 --> 00:59:05,396
- Come on.
- Lucy!

743
00:59:39,514 --> 00:59:40,973
God, there's the pump?

744
01:00:11,963 --> 01:00:13,673
She's <i>still in</i> there.

745
01:00:19,595 --> 01:00:22,806
- Oh, excuse me. I'm in a rush.
- I know the feeling.

746
01:00:28,521 --> 01:00:29,855
Are you okay?

747
01:00:30,064 --> 01:00:32,649
It's gasoline!
It's gasoline!

748
01:01:14,275 --> 01:01:16,151
- Hey, look at that.
- What?

749
01:01:48,684 --> 01:01:50,060
A storm dragon?

750
01:01:51,687 --> 01:01:54,106
A Supergirl.

751
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:45,658
Oh, my God!

752
01:02:49,328 --> 01:02:52,873
Don't. Don't look at her.

753
01:02:59,547 --> 01:03:01,048
You're gonna be alright.

754
01:03:01,257 --> 01:03:03,342
There's no broken bones.

755
01:03:10,016 --> 01:03:11,058
I love you.

756
01:03:13,227 --> 01:03:14,436
What did he say?

757
01:03:15,187 --> 01:03:16,271
What did he say?

758
01:03:16,814 --> 01:03:18,565
Looked like
"I love you", to me.

759
01:03:18,774 --> 01:03:21,610
No! No!

760
01:03:22,528 --> 01:03:23,904
You love me?

761
01:03:25,865 --> 01:03:27,533
With all my heart,
forever.

762
01:03:28,367 --> 01:03:29,910
A bird of free
and careless wing

763
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:32,079
was I through many
a smiling spring.

764
01:03:32,455 --> 01:03:33,831
The cold repulse,
the look askance.

765
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,792
The lightning of
love's angry glance, stay.

766
01:03:38,002 --> 01:03:39,878
Let me behold you.

767
01:03:54,894 --> 01:03:56,812
L-I have to go.

768
01:04:00,316 --> 01:04:02,151
Oh, I-l have to go.

769
01:04:05,154 --> 01:04:06,363
<i>Everything's under control.</i>

770
01:04:06,572 --> 01:04:07,739
Lucy!

771
01:04:07,948 --> 01:04:10,075
<i>Just go on,
back to your homes.</i>

772
01:04:10,284 --> 01:04:11,076
Lucy.

773
01:04:12,036 --> 01:04:13,370
- Oh.
- Thank God.

774
01:04:15,831 --> 01:04:18,166
- You alright?
- I think so.

775
01:04:18,584 --> 01:04:19,626
I hit my head.

776
01:04:20,378 --> 01:04:21,712
Nigel must know her.

777
01:04:22,213 --> 01:04:25,174
She must be one of his students.
He must have put her up to it.

778
01:04:25,383 --> 01:04:27,635
No. I don't think that at all.

779
01:04:27,843 --> 01:04:30,011
Oh, she just happened
to be in the wrong place

780
01:04:30,221 --> 01:04:31,972
at the wrong time, right?

781
01:04:32,181 --> 01:04:35,559
Materializing
in a bulldozer, huh?

782
01:04:35,768 --> 01:04:36,935
She's a wimpy little thing.

783
01:04:37,186 --> 01:04:39,021
I don't know why you care
what she does, anyway.

784
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:42,691
Because nobody
gets in my way.

785
01:04:42,983 --> 01:04:44,192
Why don't you just leave
this poor kid alone

786
01:04:44,402 --> 01:04:46,320
and worry about the
other one that flies?

787
01:04:46,779 --> 01:04:50,282
I worry about everything.
It's my job. Stand back.

788
01:04:50,491 --> 01:04:54,077
Oh, come on now.
She's just a teenager.

789
01:04:54,286 --> 01:04:58,786
What good is a sword
if it's not unleashed?

790
01:04:59,041 --> 01:05:01,543
But she's a total zero.
You don't even know her name.

791
01:05:01,752 --> 01:05:05,255
The naming of names
is not necessary.

792
01:05:05,714 --> 01:05:08,550
Let us concentrate
on her face.

793
01:05:08,801 --> 01:05:12,054
And my Shadow
will do the rest.

794
01:05:12,596 --> 01:05:13,638
Your what?

795
01:05:14,223 --> 01:05:15,974
Power of Shadow...

796
01:05:16,684 --> 01:05:18,727
...take shape.

797
01:05:19,854 --> 01:05:23,274
Look like a
vicious dark star.

798
01:05:23,983 --> 01:05:27,695
Seek out, that
wretched young creature.

799
01:05:27,903 --> 01:05:31,239
And destroy her
wherever she...

800
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,952
...are.

801
01:05:35,286 --> 01:05:36,704
Oh, God.
That's awful.

802
01:05:36,912 --> 01:05:38,371
That's never
gonna work.

803
01:05:58,142 --> 01:05:59,184
Oh, my God!

804
01:06:00,769 --> 01:06:02,020
I'm scared.

805
01:06:27,713 --> 01:06:29,089
Next time...

806
01:06:30,716 --> 01:06:32,634
...remind me to
do this outside.

807
01:09:16,173 --> 01:09:19,384
Leave this place
and do no harm.

808
01:09:21,261 --> 01:09:23,179
There she is again.

809
01:09:25,099 --> 01:09:26,100
What did she say?

810
01:09:26,934 --> 01:09:28,352
No, this is not possible.

811
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,937
This is not right.

812
01:09:31,146 --> 01:09:32,522
Where's the wimp?

813
01:09:33,148 --> 01:09:34,107
Ah!

814
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,485
Argh!

815
01:09:45,953 --> 01:09:47,037
Argh!

816
01:09:48,706 --> 01:09:50,624
I think he can
take care of her.

817
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:51,708
Ah!

818
01:09:53,085 --> 01:09:54,419
Argh!

819
01:10:13,814 --> 01:10:16,107
See?
What did I tell you?

820
01:10:16,984 --> 01:10:18,568
She quit, right?

821
01:10:18,777 --> 01:10:19,611
Wrong.

822
01:11:25,594 --> 01:11:27,429
Every time!

823
01:11:27,638 --> 01:11:29,514
Every time!

824
01:11:29,723 --> 01:11:32,684
Send a man to do a woman's job
and that's what you get.

825
01:11:33,519 --> 01:11:37,105
Damn her eyes.
Who is she?

826
01:11:37,314 --> 01:11:40,358
- Are you asking me?
- I'm telling you.

827
01:11:41,068 --> 01:11:42,277
Find out!

828
01:11:42,486 --> 01:11:46,323
Well, sure. But, you know,
I think I recognize the costume.

829
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:53,371
Leave him alone. Let him.

830
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,331
Where have you been?

831
01:11:55,541 --> 01:11:57,209
- Outside--
- Look at you.

832
01:11:58,043 --> 01:11:59,419
Look at those clothes.

833
01:11:59,628 --> 01:12:00,962
Oh, I'll go change.
l-l'm sorry.

834
01:12:01,171 --> 01:12:04,465
And you'll put on
your proper school uniform.

835
01:12:04,675 --> 01:12:07,177
And get out of that
ridiculous costume.

836
01:12:07,386 --> 01:12:08,345
Yes, ma'am.

837
01:12:08,554 --> 01:12:10,639
- And cover your legs.
- Yes, ma'am.

838
01:12:11,348 --> 01:12:13,683
Don't you
"yes, ma'am" me.

839
01:12:13,892 --> 01:12:15,143
No, ma'am.

840
01:12:17,813 --> 01:12:19,689
I think you're blowing
this thing out of proportion

841
01:12:19,898 --> 01:12:20,899
if you want my opinion.

842
01:12:21,149 --> 01:12:24,485
Oh, no. This box is
definitely getting bigger...

843
01:12:25,821 --> 01:12:26,905
...and uglier.

844
01:12:27,114 --> 01:12:29,032
All I'm saying is
you can't go nuts

845
01:12:29,241 --> 01:12:31,910
over a landscape guy and a
teenager in a blue suit.

846
01:12:32,119 --> 01:12:33,537
She flies.

847
01:12:34,371 --> 01:12:36,289
Can you get that through
your thick skull

848
01:12:36,498 --> 01:12:39,000
and into your
tiny brain, Bianca?

849
01:12:39,209 --> 01:12:41,628
The girl can fly.

850
01:12:58,937 --> 01:13:00,104
Okay-

851
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,564
Now.

852
01:13:01,982 --> 01:13:04,526
Let's get serious.

853
01:13:05,569 --> 01:13:08,321
Come to mama.

854
01:13:10,157 --> 01:13:11,741
<i>- Oh.
- Oh.</i>

855
01:13:14,786 --> 01:13:16,037
Oh.

856
01:13:16,246 --> 01:13:17,163
Whoa.

857
01:13:34,222 --> 01:13:37,600
- Selena, cut it out.
- I'm not doing it.

858
01:14:07,005 --> 01:14:08,965
I think we're venturing where

859
01:14:09,299 --> 01:14:12,135
you know, fools rush in
and angels fear to tread.

860
01:14:12,469 --> 01:14:15,472
I'm no angel.

861
01:15:04,813 --> 01:15:06,231
It's the wimp again.

862
01:15:07,149 --> 01:15:09,234
And she's trespassing.

863
01:15:27,753 --> 01:15:29,129
Hello.

864
01:15:29,337 --> 01:15:31,672
Oh, no. Not now.

865
01:15:31,882 --> 01:15:34,050
'Tis only but me,
my love.

866
01:15:34,259 --> 01:15:36,010
Please, you'll let
everyone know.

867
01:15:36,219 --> 01:15:37,553
What?
That I love you?

868
01:15:37,763 --> 01:15:39,306
I'd shout it from
the highest hill.

869
01:15:39,514 --> 01:15:41,140
Please don't.

870
01:15:41,349 --> 01:15:44,101
I know you think me the fool,
at least tell me your name.

871
01:15:44,352 --> 01:15:45,686
Linda. Linda Lee.

872
01:15:46,188 --> 01:15:47,105
Linda.

873
01:15:47,856 --> 01:15:49,357
Lovely Linda Lee.

874
01:15:50,358 --> 01:15:52,485
These roses pale
beside thee.

875
01:15:54,696 --> 01:15:55,363
Oh.

876
01:15:56,907 --> 01:15:57,782
Well, thank you,
but I'm--

877
01:15:57,991 --> 01:16:00,326
And sweet chocolates
for my sweet Linda.

878
01:16:01,953 --> 01:16:03,037
Hm.

879
01:16:12,547 --> 01:16:13,506
What are you doing?

880
01:16:16,051 --> 01:16:17,177
Please?

881
01:16:19,304 --> 01:16:20,388
Oh, no, I...

882
01:16:20,597 --> 01:16:21,431
Please.

883
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:23,558
Well, alright.
But just for a minute.

884
01:16:37,697 --> 01:16:39,240
You hate me,
don't you?

885
01:16:40,325 --> 01:16:42,785
Hate you?
I don't even know you.

886
01:16:42,994 --> 01:16:44,286
I don't even know
your name.

887
01:16:45,163 --> 01:16:46,164
Ethan.

888
01:16:46,915 --> 01:16:50,627
Say my name aloud but once
and I shall die the happy fool.

889
01:16:50,836 --> 01:16:52,087
- Look, Ethan--
- Huh!

890
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:56,632
Ethan.

891
01:16:58,510 --> 01:16:59,427
Ethan.

892
01:17:01,721 --> 01:17:03,639
Your soft caress
did at once renew

893
01:17:03,849 --> 01:17:05,475
the beating of
this broken heart.

894
01:17:06,476 --> 01:17:07,935
Are you crazy?

895
01:17:11,273 --> 01:17:12,399
Marry me?

896
01:17:23,618 --> 01:17:24,744
Marry you?

897
01:17:25,745 --> 01:17:27,872
- I don't--
- Don't say it. Don't, please.

898
01:17:28,081 --> 01:17:28,873
I know.

899
01:17:29,416 --> 01:17:30,208
What?

900
01:17:31,668 --> 01:17:32,960
We're from
different worlds.

901
01:17:33,336 --> 01:17:36,464
- You mean, you know where I'm--
- Just give me a chance, Linda.

902
01:17:36,965 --> 01:17:39,217
Love makes
everything possible.

903
01:17:39,885 --> 01:17:43,471
A poor uneducated gardener can
indeed worship a rich debutante

904
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:45,473
and make her happy
if she'd just...

905
01:17:45,682 --> 01:17:47,141
Oh, Ethan.

906
01:17:47,851 --> 01:17:49,477
I'm not rich.
I'm just--

907
01:17:49,686 --> 01:17:51,938
Well, then
I'll support us both.

908
01:17:53,481 --> 01:17:55,524
You're nuts,
you know that?

909
01:17:55,734 --> 01:17:58,778
You're so sweet,
but you're out of your mind.

910
01:18:00,739 --> 01:18:01,906
Over you.

911
01:18:10,081 --> 01:18:12,917
What a touching scene.

912
01:18:43,031 --> 01:18:45,742
Round and round they go.

913
01:18:46,743 --> 01:18:49,078
Where they stop.

914
01:18:59,798 --> 01:19:02,675
Boy, you're really getting
the hang of this.

915
01:19:04,386 --> 01:19:05,637
Oh.

916
01:19:11,101 --> 01:19:12,644
Where is she?

917
01:19:16,564 --> 01:19:18,065
Jesus.

918
01:19:19,067 --> 01:19:20,526
Who are you?

919
01:19:21,361 --> 01:19:23,404
I am Selena.

920
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:26,074
Diadanus of Catania.

921
01:19:26,283 --> 01:19:30,203
Priestess of Sechnid.
l am the ultimate Siren of Endor

922
01:19:30,412 --> 01:19:34,912
and you, little lady, are
trespassing on private property.

923
01:19:36,793 --> 01:19:38,127
She means him.

924
01:19:38,753 --> 01:19:40,838
I am Kara of Argo City.

925
01:19:41,047 --> 01:19:42,965
Daughter of Alura and Zor-El.

926
01:19:43,717 --> 01:19:46,052
And I don't scare easily.

927
01:19:46,261 --> 01:19:47,220
No?

928
01:19:47,887 --> 01:19:48,846
No.

929
01:19:49,764 --> 01:19:51,098
Try. . -

930
01:19:52,642 --> 01:19:53,809
...this.

931
01:20:11,328 --> 01:20:14,873
This lady is improving by leaps
and bounds, I gotta tell you.

932
01:21:38,081 --> 01:21:39,540
You Okay?

933
01:21:40,291 --> 01:21:41,417
No.

934
01:21:43,503 --> 01:21:46,047
You want a hacksaw
or somethin'?

935
01:21:58,518 --> 01:22:02,605
Now I am really upset.

936
01:22:50,987 --> 01:22:52,238
What's going on?

937
01:22:53,781 --> 01:22:54,573
Oh.

938
01:22:55,325 --> 01:22:56,576
Put me down.

939
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:07,461
<i>- Where am I?
- You're safe.</i>

940
01:23:07,670 --> 01:23:09,713
Safe? Where's Linda?

941
01:23:09,923 --> 01:23:11,549
Put me down.

942
01:23:16,846 --> 01:23:18,764
- Where's my Linda?
- Take it easy.

943
01:23:26,689 --> 01:23:27,606
Ethan.

944
01:23:27,815 --> 01:23:29,775
Ha-ha. Very clever.

945
01:23:30,151 --> 01:23:32,361
That ought to keep her out
of your hair for a few hours.

946
01:23:32,695 --> 01:23:35,322
Clever?
A cheap trick.

947
01:23:39,452 --> 01:23:41,579
Power of Shadow.

948
01:23:41,788 --> 01:23:45,374
Bring him to me.

949
01:23:51,297 --> 01:23:55,797
Bring him...to me.

950
01:23:58,805 --> 01:23:59,722
Ugh!

951
01:23:59,931 --> 01:24:00,973
Didn't work, huh?

952
01:24:01,182 --> 01:24:02,516
Maybe they're too far away.

953
01:24:02,725 --> 01:24:05,561
I can make the sky rain coconuts
with pinpoint accuracy.

954
01:24:05,770 --> 01:24:09,565
But I still can't control
men's minds.

955
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,026
Not with her around.

956
01:24:12,235 --> 01:24:13,277
So maybe...

957
01:24:13,486 --> 01:24:15,488
Now, don't go
through the roof.

958
01:24:15,697 --> 01:24:17,323
But maybe we
ought to back down

959
01:24:17,532 --> 01:24:20,326
and give old
you-know-who a call.

960
01:24:20,994 --> 01:24:22,328
You-know-who.

961
01:24:22,537 --> 01:24:24,205
- Spit it out.
- Nigel.

962
01:24:24,414 --> 01:24:25,998
I shall pretend
you didn't say that.

963
01:24:26,207 --> 01:24:27,374
<i>But I did.</i>

964
01:24:27,584 --> 01:24:29,127
All I'm thinking
and forgive me

965
01:24:29,335 --> 01:24:31,295
for thinking
out of turn here...

966
01:24:31,754 --> 01:24:33,714
...is that
he's been around.

967
01:24:34,591 --> 01:24:36,342
He knows things
we don't.

968
01:24:36,884 --> 01:24:39,011
<i>Plus, the way you wrap
him around your little finger</i>

969
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:41,013
<i>I'm always amazed.</i>

970
01:25:20,803 --> 01:25:22,346
What's in it for me?

971
01:25:23,431 --> 01:25:24,473
Me.

972
01:25:24,682 --> 01:25:25,933
Ah-ha.

973
01:25:26,225 --> 01:25:29,144
My dear Nigel, the way to
a woman's heart is through

974
01:25:29,354 --> 01:25:31,439
the elimination of her rivals.

975
01:25:31,773 --> 01:25:33,024
Murder?
Are you proposing that--

976
01:25:33,232 --> 01:25:36,485
Oh, certainly not.
Leave that to me.

977
01:25:36,694 --> 01:25:39,905
You deliver the goods.
Her.

978
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:41,657
Her? How?

979
01:25:42,367 --> 01:25:43,785
By getting me...

980
01:25:43,993 --> 01:25:45,369
...him.

981
01:25:45,995 --> 01:25:48,205
- She'll follow.
- Well, I don't.

982
01:25:48,998 --> 01:25:51,208
- Follow any of this, I mean--
- Put that down.

983
01:25:54,629 --> 01:25:56,589
Nigel, I want
one thing.

984
01:25:57,048 --> 01:25:59,508
Time to master
my new toy.

985
01:25:59,717 --> 01:26:02,261
<i>So, we can rule the world?</i>

986
01:26:02,762 --> 01:26:04,597
And you want him here?

987
01:26:04,806 --> 01:26:06,307
Johnny Appleseed
in your living room?

988
01:26:06,516 --> 01:26:08,476
Yes. In the flesh.

989
01:26:08,685 --> 01:26:10,061
So, she'll follow?

990
01:26:10,436 --> 01:26:13,105
- No other reason?
- None.

991
01:26:13,564 --> 01:26:15,607
You're sure of that?

992
01:26:16,901 --> 01:26:20,863
<i>Whoops, I'm sorry.
The little spider got out.</i>

993
01:26:21,531 --> 01:26:22,740
What?

994
01:26:24,867 --> 01:26:26,243
Where am I?

995
01:26:28,162 --> 01:26:30,706
- Who are you?
- Kara.

996
01:26:31,290 --> 01:26:32,207
Kara?

997
01:26:34,585 --> 01:26:35,669
What happened?

998
01:26:35,878 --> 01:26:38,046
You got hit on the head
by a coconut.

999
01:26:38,715 --> 01:26:40,299
- Huh?
- Hm.

1000
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:42,468
What's with
the Halloween costume?

1001
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:47,473
This is not a costume.
These are my clothes.

1002
01:26:47,765 --> 01:26:48,766
What do you mean?

1003
01:26:49,016 --> 01:26:51,018
Look, I-l have
to go now.

1004
01:26:51,227 --> 01:26:53,479
I'll come back for you later.
I've just gotta get back to

1005
01:26:53,730 --> 01:26:54,772
the amusement park.

1006
01:26:54,981 --> 01:26:57,108
Amusement park?
Linda!

1007
01:26:59,152 --> 01:27:01,237
I gotta find Linda,
she was in trouble.

1008
01:27:01,946 --> 01:27:05,199
Well, Linda's alright.
She can take care of herself.

1009
01:27:05,408 --> 01:27:06,575
<i>No, no. She can't.
Something's wrong.</i>

1010
01:27:06,784 --> 01:27:08,660
She's in big trouble
and I love her.

1011
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:11,038
I love her.

1012
01:27:12,874 --> 01:27:14,500
Yeah, I do love her.

1013
01:27:17,670 --> 01:27:19,380
I have to go, Ethan.
Goodbye.

1014
01:27:19,839 --> 01:27:21,173
Yes, so do I.

1015
01:27:22,508 --> 01:27:23,884
Hey!

1016
01:27:29,015 --> 01:27:31,183
I told you Linda can
take care of herself.

1017
01:27:31,392 --> 01:27:34,436
- You just flew over my head.
- I'll take care of everything.

1018
01:27:34,645 --> 01:27:37,314
I said you just flew over
my head. True or false?

1019
01:27:38,483 --> 01:27:39,442
True.

1020
01:27:40,902 --> 01:27:42,278
Like Superman.

1021
01:27:42,653 --> 01:27:43,820
He's my cousin.

1022
01:27:44,614 --> 01:27:46,907
- He's your cousin?
- Yes.

1023
01:27:47,158 --> 01:27:48,826
I shouldn't be telling you
this though--

1024
01:27:49,035 --> 01:27:51,120
Wait one minute. I mean you can
do the whole number, leap tall

1025
01:27:51,329 --> 01:27:53,539
buildings with a single bound?
And look right through things?

1026
01:27:53,748 --> 01:27:56,041
- Yes
- Bend steel bars?

1027
01:27:56,584 --> 01:27:58,711
- Yes.
- Whoa!

1028
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:02,840
- Oh, Selena. I have to go.
- Wait a minute.

1029
01:28:03,049 --> 01:28:04,300
- Selena has the Omegahedron.
- Please take me with you.

1030
01:28:04,509 --> 01:28:06,010
I have to find Linda.

1031
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:10,806
What is it?

1032
01:28:11,057 --> 01:28:12,475
The Burundi Wand.

1033
01:28:12,850 --> 01:28:15,811
Pure, unadulterated evil.

1034
01:28:16,979 --> 01:28:18,271
Ready?

1035
01:28:47,218 --> 01:28:48,677
But how can you love her?

1036
01:28:48,886 --> 01:28:51,179
- You don't even know her.
- Oh, yeah, I do.

1037
01:28:52,014 --> 01:28:53,473
And she's in trouble,
then I got no business

1038
01:28:53,683 --> 01:28:55,559
standing here,
talking with you.

1039
01:28:56,143 --> 01:28:57,811
Even if you are
what you say you are.

1040
01:28:58,062 --> 01:29:00,272
Linda is not in trouble.

1041
01:29:00,648 --> 01:29:03,567
Look, uh, don't make me
get rough, okay?

1042
01:29:03,776 --> 01:29:05,944
You wouldn't
stand a chance.

1043
01:29:06,487 --> 01:29:08,071
Please trust me.

1044
01:29:08,739 --> 01:29:10,449
Linda is alright.

1045
01:29:11,784 --> 01:29:13,076
How do you know?

1046
01:29:13,870 --> 01:29:15,288
L just...

1047
01:29:16,747 --> 01:29:17,831
...know.

1048
01:29:30,011 --> 01:29:31,429
Linda.

1049
01:29:41,814 --> 01:29:43,482
Oh, my God.

1050
01:29:44,150 --> 01:29:45,442
How did you do that?

1051
01:29:50,948 --> 01:29:51,990
Ethan.

1052
01:29:54,785 --> 01:29:55,827
Ethan!

1053
01:29:59,498 --> 01:30:03,043
Nigel, you are wonderful.

1054
01:30:03,711 --> 01:30:06,130
Pure genius.

1055
01:30:07,506 --> 01:30:09,132
You deserve...

1056
01:30:09,759 --> 01:30:11,010
...me.

1057
01:30:34,367 --> 01:30:36,243
And something else.

1058
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:46,170
Now, let's get out
of this dump.

1059
01:30:48,047 --> 01:30:49,715
<i>Did you see this thing?
Look at this!</i>

1060
01:30:50,383 --> 01:30:52,176
Hey, what's the matter?
Catchin' flies?

1061
01:30:52,385 --> 01:30:54,095
Lucy, look.

1062
01:30:56,722 --> 01:30:58,557
One minute nothing.
The next minute this.

1063
01:30:58,891 --> 01:31:00,225
<i>What is it?</i>

1064
01:31:02,103 --> 01:31:04,230
<i>It's</i> a <i>mountain, Lucy.
Isn't it?</i>

1065
01:31:04,438 --> 01:31:06,064
<i>Tell me
I'm not seeing things.</i>

1066
01:31:06,273 --> 01:31:07,357
<i>How did it get there, Jimmy?</i>

1067
01:31:07,566 --> 01:31:09,234
<i>I don't know.
It just appeared.</i>

1068
01:31:09,485 --> 01:31:11,403
<i>How can a
mountain just appear?</i>

1069
01:31:11,988 --> 01:31:13,948
<i>Hey, there's something
on the top.</i>

1070
01:31:14,699 --> 01:31:16,409
<i>Looks like</i> a <i>castle.</i>

1071
01:31:16,617 --> 01:31:18,285
<i>Looks more like</i> a <i>fortress.</i>

1072
01:32:07,418 --> 01:32:08,377
Ethan?

1073
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:16,761
Ethan.

1074
01:32:49,001 --> 01:32:50,210
Ethan!

1075
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:52,171
Ah.

1076
01:33:17,738 --> 01:33:20,574
Enjoy your prison,
Supergirl...

1077
01:33:21,742 --> 01:33:25,287
...forever and ever.

1078
01:33:28,874 --> 01:33:30,792
No, Ethan!

1079
01:33:31,085 --> 01:33:32,753
Don't do it!

1080
01:33:33,379 --> 01:33:34,588
<i>Ethan!</i>

1081
01:35:05,221 --> 01:35:07,014
Where am I?

1082
01:36:28,053 --> 01:36:30,055
You can't arrest
me without a <i>warrant.</i>

1083
01:36:31,390 --> 01:36:32,808
I'm calling my lawyer.

1084
01:36:41,525 --> 01:36:42,359
Slow down.

1085
01:36:42,568 --> 01:36:44,111
We want Selena out.

1086
01:36:45,779 --> 01:36:47,781
Smile, lunkhead.
You're not a gardener anymore.

1087
01:36:47,990 --> 01:36:49,700
You're Prince Ethan, now.

1088
01:36:49,950 --> 01:36:51,910
Are we gonna stand up
to her or not?

1089
01:36:52,119 --> 01:36:53,036
Yes.

1090
01:36:53,245 --> 01:36:54,371
Selena must go!

1091
01:36:54,580 --> 01:36:56,206
Who's this little twerpette?

1092
01:36:56,415 --> 01:36:58,083
She's someone
who believes in freedom.

1093
01:36:58,334 --> 01:37:00,085
Lucy, it's not a good time
to express yourself.

1094
01:37:00,336 --> 01:37:02,129
<i>I don't know, who you are.</i>

1095
01:37:02,338 --> 01:37:03,922
Or what evil force
you represent.

1096
01:37:04,131 --> 01:37:07,259
But if you think you can get rid
of anybody who stands up to you.

1097
01:37:07,468 --> 01:37:10,304
Just make them disappear.
Like my friend Linda.

1098
01:37:10,971 --> 01:37:11,888
Who?

1099
01:37:12,097 --> 01:37:13,139
Linda, my roommate.

1100
01:37:13,349 --> 01:37:15,392
She disappeared the day
that mountain showed up.

1101
01:37:17,728 --> 01:37:19,604
The wimp.

1102
01:37:21,315 --> 01:37:22,899
Seize them!

1103
01:37:25,569 --> 01:37:26,778
Leave her alone!

1104
01:37:26,987 --> 01:37:28,154
<i>Drive</i> off.

1105
01:37:28,405 --> 01:37:29,906
Leave her alone.

1106
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:32,075
Nobody messes around
with Jimmy Olsen!

1107
01:37:32,284 --> 01:37:34,911
Now, let go of me.
I'm with the press!

1108
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:51,071
Zaltar.

1109
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:52,281
Squirt.

1110
01:38:55,117 --> 01:38:57,911
- Zaltar?
- Squirt.

1111
01:39:00,164 --> 01:39:02,958
Zaltar, it's me.
It's-it's Kara.

1112
01:39:03,167 --> 01:39:04,376
I know.

1113
01:39:06,628 --> 01:39:08,046
Squirt.

1114
01:39:13,218 --> 01:39:14,761
What is that?

1115
01:39:16,054 --> 01:39:17,513
Where are we?

1116
01:39:17,723 --> 01:39:19,266
Nowhere.

1117
01:39:22,311 --> 01:39:23,687
The Phantom Zone?

1118
01:39:23,979 --> 01:39:26,272
It's lonely here,
my Kara.

1119
01:39:27,566 --> 01:39:28,858
So sad.

1120
01:39:31,570 --> 01:39:35,282
I've been here forever
and I shall stay here forever.

1121
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:39,828
<i>- Ethan'?
- Yes, my damn'.</i>

1122
01:39:40,037 --> 01:39:42,789
Don't call me your "darling."
You despise me.

1123
01:39:42,998 --> 01:39:45,208
- Get me the coffer of shadow.
- Yes, my darling.

1124
01:39:46,126 --> 01:39:47,085
Now...

1125
01:39:48,921 --> 01:39:52,049
...l think we need something.

1126
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:55,469
<i>There.</i>

1127
01:40:00,599 --> 01:40:01,558
Oh, Jimmy.

1128
01:40:02,976 --> 01:40:04,519
Oh, terrific.

1129
01:40:04,728 --> 01:40:08,064
The old dangling-in-a-cage
routine.

1130
01:40:08,273 --> 01:40:10,358
Pathetic, Selena.

1131
01:40:12,152 --> 01:40:14,863
- Who's that guy?
- He's my math teacher, I think.

1132
01:40:15,072 --> 01:40:16,364
What are they for?

1133
01:40:17,115 --> 01:40:18,825
Insurance.

1134
01:40:24,498 --> 01:40:26,041
But you can't just give up.

1135
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:28,293
You founded a whole city.

1136
01:40:28,502 --> 01:40:31,213
I did, and then
I doomed it to destruction.

1137
01:40:31,421 --> 01:40:33,673
That was an error.
A tragic one.

1138
01:40:34,466 --> 01:40:36,009
When you're my age
and you make as many

1139
01:40:36,218 --> 01:40:39,012
tragic errors as I do,
it is a different tune

1140
01:40:39,221 --> 01:40:40,180
that you will sing.

1141
01:40:40,389 --> 01:40:42,265
I will not.
I'll never give up.

1142
01:40:42,474 --> 01:40:45,018
I will never spend my entire
life in a place like this.

1143
01:40:45,269 --> 01:40:47,646
- I would die first!
- Strong words.

1144
01:40:47,854 --> 01:40:51,566
There are worse things than
dying and I deserve every one.

1145
01:41:08,542 --> 01:41:12,212
- What is this?
- A horse...l think.

1146
01:41:13,338 --> 01:41:17,300
On earth I think
it's called a horse.

1147
01:41:18,010 --> 01:41:20,178
- And you made this here?
- Mm.

1148
01:41:23,098 --> 01:41:25,558
- Then you haven't given up.
- Don't be ridiculous.

1149
01:41:25,809 --> 01:41:28,061
Earth, Zaltar.
Earth, a tree, a horse.

1150
01:41:28,270 --> 01:41:29,688
You keep making things
from earth.

1151
01:41:29,896 --> 01:41:32,106
- The place intrigues me.
- Well, then, let's go there.

1152
01:41:32,316 --> 01:41:34,651
Certainly.
When is the next train?

1153
01:41:36,153 --> 01:41:37,487
What is a train?

1154
01:41:40,782 --> 01:41:43,951
What's so funny?
Don't laugh at me, Zaltar.

1155
01:41:45,245 --> 01:41:46,955
I'm only laughing
at myself.

1156
01:41:47,164 --> 01:41:49,833
For you, I weep.

1157
01:41:51,084 --> 01:41:52,877
Is this train
a way out of here?

1158
01:41:53,086 --> 01:41:55,505
There is no way
out of here.

1159
01:41:56,173 --> 01:41:58,675
That is the point
of the Phantom Zone.

1160
01:41:59,092 --> 01:42:02,053
My neighbors now: the criminals,
the corrupt, the evil...

1161
01:42:02,262 --> 01:42:03,304
...they're here.

1162
01:42:03,513 --> 01:42:05,097
Over the hill there.

1163
01:42:05,307 --> 01:42:06,975
With no way out.

1164
01:42:07,851 --> 01:42:11,354
But, there's always a way out.

1165
01:42:11,563 --> 01:42:14,232
<i>If there's a way in,
there's a way out.</i>

1166
01:42:17,319 --> 01:42:18,987
There is a way.

1167
01:42:20,322 --> 01:42:22,741
- But it's impossible.
- Why?

1168
01:42:22,949 --> 01:42:24,951
No, it wouldn't work.

1169
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:26,536
<i>You'd be swept into
a singularity</i>

1170
01:42:26,745 --> 01:42:28,037
if it didn't work. No.

1171
01:42:28,789 --> 01:42:31,416
Forget I mentioned it.
Have a squirt instead.

1172
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:38,340
I could do it.

1173
01:42:41,468 --> 01:42:44,179
Then, please.
At least teach me how.

1174
01:42:44,388 --> 01:42:46,306
There's nothing to teach.
You can't, as they say

1175
01:42:46,556 --> 01:42:51,056
practice at the rift.
You get one chance only.

1176
01:42:51,812 --> 01:42:54,481
- The rift?
- Sure? You won't have a squirt?

1177
01:42:54,731 --> 01:42:57,859
Once you get used to it,
I think it's delicious.

1178
01:43:04,366 --> 01:43:05,575
You're right.

1179
01:43:06,618 --> 01:43:09,245
You are absolutely right.

1180
01:43:12,249 --> 01:43:15,293
There is enough doom
and gloom in the air already.

1181
01:43:15,502 --> 01:43:17,712
And it is better
to accept defeat

1182
01:43:17,921 --> 01:43:20,423
than to take a chance and try
like fools to redeem ourselves

1183
01:43:20,716 --> 01:43:23,176
<i>and save our city and all those
who we love there.</i>

1184
01:43:23,385 --> 01:43:25,595
Plus all the people on Earth
that this wicked sorceress

1185
01:43:25,846 --> 01:43:28,640
is going to make suffer
just because of us. Cheers!

1186
01:43:33,228 --> 01:43:34,896
We could die trying.

1187
01:43:36,314 --> 01:43:37,898
But we won't.

1188
01:43:38,483 --> 01:43:40,568
We won't. Come on.

1189
01:44:08,805 --> 01:44:10,181
Tomorrow.

1190
01:44:10,599 --> 01:44:13,476
Thursday. Friday.

1191
01:44:13,685 --> 01:44:16,062
Just like here, we go
for the cops first, right?

1192
01:44:16,271 --> 01:44:17,939
And the army.

1193
01:44:18,148 --> 01:44:21,109
By Saturday, we have
the continental United States,

1194
01:44:21,318 --> 01:44:23,278
Mexico, Canada.

1195
01:44:27,157 --> 01:44:29,576
<i>Oh, my God, Selena.
It's the box.</i>

1196
01:44:29,785 --> 01:44:32,037
- Hush it up.
- No.

1197
01:44:32,621 --> 01:44:36,374
What the box wants,
the box gets.

1198
01:44:52,641 --> 01:44:53,975
What is it?

1199
01:44:54,184 --> 01:44:55,852
Fascinating.

1200
01:44:58,688 --> 01:45:00,272
I don't know.

1201
01:45:01,983 --> 01:45:03,401
ls this it?

1202
01:45:03,610 --> 01:45:04,777
Is this the way out?

1203
01:45:04,986 --> 01:45:08,739
Not yet! This
is the Quantum Vortex!

1204
01:45:09,449 --> 01:45:12,368
We must risk
our destruction in it.

1205
01:45:12,911 --> 01:45:17,248
To move mountains,
you must make sacrifices.

1206
01:45:17,457 --> 01:45:19,375
Zaltar, I'm scared!

1207
01:45:19,751 --> 01:45:22,253
Accept your fears.

1208
01:45:22,546 --> 01:45:24,673
Confront your demons.

1209
01:45:24,965 --> 01:45:28,510
Find your destiny
in the maelstrom!

1210
01:46:18,935 --> 01:46:21,145
Zaltar, I can't.
I can't.

1211
01:46:21,354 --> 01:46:24,398
You...can!

1212
01:46:49,215 --> 01:46:51,467
Two specks.
Look!

1213
01:46:57,766 --> 01:46:59,309
What do I do?

1214
01:47:00,352 --> 01:47:03,688
How do you murder someone
in the Phantom Zone?

1215
01:47:07,817 --> 01:47:10,653
She's with some old guy,
it looks like.

1216
01:47:10,862 --> 01:47:13,447
Move, huh.
Come on!

1217
01:47:13,657 --> 01:47:15,241
Calm down, okay.

1218
01:47:15,784 --> 01:47:19,537
Ah. This is what I want.

1219
01:47:20,789 --> 01:47:23,583
The Salian Fireballs.

1220
01:47:23,792 --> 01:47:27,754
Page 321. Chapter 6.

1221
01:47:42,769 --> 01:47:43,770
Whoa!

1222
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:46,481
What is that?

1223
01:47:50,986 --> 01:47:52,278
Watch out!

1224
01:48:20,265 --> 01:48:21,891
"Power of Rainmaking". No!

1225
01:48:22,100 --> 01:48:23,434
"How to separate
husband and wife."

1226
01:48:23,643 --> 01:48:25,144
No, not now.
Not now!

1227
01:48:25,353 --> 01:48:28,230
Well, you better find something
fast, like an atom bomb.

1228
01:48:40,285 --> 01:48:41,327
I found it.

1229
01:48:43,204 --> 01:48:47,704
"Summoning...the demon storm."

1230
01:48:48,043 --> 01:48:50,378
Hurry...go_

1231
01:48:50,587 --> 01:48:53,923
Higher girl, higher.

1232
01:48:54,132 --> 01:48:58,094
- Come with me!
- I am with you!

1233
01:48:58,303 --> 01:48:59,804
On, girl.

1234
01:49:12,650 --> 01:49:14,526
I am with you.

1235
01:49:18,448 --> 01:49:20,074
Zaltar!

1236
01:50:13,586 --> 01:50:14,962
Oh, thank God.

1237
01:50:18,591 --> 01:50:21,927
You've had your fun, Selena.
The game is finished.

1238
01:50:22,137 --> 01:50:23,429
Hardly.

1239
01:50:23,638 --> 01:50:26,724
One false step, bluebird.

1240
01:50:26,933 --> 01:50:31,103
And even if you don't,
your friends will get the point.

1241
01:50:33,898 --> 01:50:35,274
Hey: "C!

1242
01:50:42,699 --> 01:50:43,658
I don't like this.

1243
01:50:44,367 --> 01:50:46,577
Don't worry, Lucy.
Don't worry.

1244
01:50:48,580 --> 01:50:50,582
I wouldn't
if I were you.

1245
01:50:50,790 --> 01:50:53,167
Well, you're not me.

1246
01:50:59,799 --> 01:51:01,091
- Oh!
- Ah!

1247
01:51:01,718 --> 01:51:04,429
Quick, get out 0f the way.
Into the alcove over there.

1248
01:51:04,637 --> 01:51:07,014
- Come on, out.
- Hurry, Jimmy. Hurry.

1249
01:51:11,019 --> 01:51:13,563
The Omegahedron, Selena.

1250
01:51:13,771 --> 01:51:15,189
I want it.

1251
01:51:15,481 --> 01:51:19,981
Well, then, Supergirl.
You shall have it.

1252
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:46,179
Ah!

1253
01:51:53,353 --> 01:51:54,312
Ah!

1254
01:52:06,074 --> 01:52:07,909
Supergirl, above you.
Look out!

1255
01:52:12,413 --> 01:52:13,288
Ah!

1256
01:52:22,131 --> 01:52:25,551
I think I'll be going.
If you'll excuse me.

1257
01:52:30,807 --> 01:52:33,392
That's what I said.
I'm staying, I'm staying.

1258
01:52:47,407 --> 01:52:49,700
You have no friends, Selena.

1259
01:52:49,909 --> 01:52:52,244
You treat everyone as if
they were put on this earth

1260
01:52:52,453 --> 01:52:53,912
to serve you.

1261
01:52:54,539 --> 01:52:56,541
More or less,
I think they were.

1262
01:52:57,625 --> 01:52:59,627
You included.

1263
01:53:03,006 --> 01:53:05,091
Power of shadow.

1264
01:53:05,508 --> 01:53:07,426
Appear!

1265
01:53:28,656 --> 01:53:30,574
Power of shadow...

1266
01:53:33,036 --> 01:53:35,788
...destroy her!

1267
01:54:15,953 --> 01:54:16,995
Ah!

1268
01:54:17,205 --> 01:54:18,080
Oh!

1269
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:33,929
L...can't.

1270
01:54:35,473 --> 01:54:37,475
I can't!

1271
01:54:37,683 --> 01:54:39,935
You can!

1272
01:54:41,771 --> 01:54:44,023
<i>On, girl.</i>

1273
01:54:53,116 --> 01:54:54,158
Yes!

1274
01:55:04,335 --> 01:55:06,920
Confront her with it!
It's the only way!

1275
01:55:22,645 --> 01:55:23,896
Q-oh!

1276
01:55:37,952 --> 01:55:39,578
No, no, no!

1277
01:55:50,214 --> 01:55:51,632
Argh!

1278
01:56:29,545 --> 01:56:30,295
Oh!

1279
01:56:31,172 --> 01:56:32,506
I have to go.

1280
01:56:32,715 --> 01:56:34,508
I have to return this
to where it belongs.

1281
01:56:34,759 --> 01:56:36,260
<i>And I must
ask you all something.</i>

1282
01:56:36,469 --> 01:56:39,430
It's alright, Supergirl.
We never saw you.

1283
01:56:39,639 --> 01:56:41,140
We never even
heard of you.

1284
01:56:41,516 --> 01:56:42,642
Thank you.

1285
01:56:43,184 --> 01:56:45,102
<i>(Supergirl
Ethan, Linda, she...</i>

1286
01:56:45,311 --> 01:56:47,438
Well, she had to leave
in a hurry, but she...

1287
01:56:47,647 --> 01:56:49,315
You don't have to
say a word.

1288
01:56:50,149 --> 01:56:51,400
I know.

1289
01:56:57,448 --> 01:56:59,366
I'll explain
about Linda.

1290
01:57:00,952 --> 01:57:02,328
Thank you, Ethan.

1291
01:57:03,746 --> 01:57:05,372
Take care of
yourself, kiddo.

1292
01:57:28,729 --> 01:57:31,690
Wow!
That was some kiss.

1293
01:57:31,899 --> 01:57:32,774
Wow!

1294
01:57:35,444 --> 01:57:37,070
Goodbye, Linda.
