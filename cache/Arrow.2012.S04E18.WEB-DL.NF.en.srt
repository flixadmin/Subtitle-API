Malcolm Merlyn.

Since when?

20
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,296
Two nights ago.

21
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,505
Andy, you should've told me this earlier.

00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,591
I know, man, and I'm sorry. But...

23
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,927

What did Merlyn want?

25
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:56,806
I think there's some kind of friction
going on between HIVE and Darhk.

26
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:59,392
Have you noticed they haven't even tried
to bust Darhk out of prison.

27

Yeah, I've been thinking about that.

00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:02,187
And now, this Merlyn guy
asked me to help him.

29

him hijack the shipment.

Yeah, well, just one of those Paveways

34
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,406
makes for a pretty good
"get out of jail free" card.

What do I do?

First kidnapping, then stealing missiles.

Merlyn's trying really hard
to be friends with Darhk.

If Malcolm's convinced Darhk
is on the winning side, it...

He's even trying to "protect" me
from whatever he's has planning.

41

The only thing Darhk should be planning
on is getting convicted at trial.

me out the way it does?

Everything is in place. We're good to go.

54
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,990
Because Merlyn knows
the bunker's location.

55
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:57,367
And if he's working with Darhk...

56
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,535
...then that means we have to worry

57

what the khushu idol is?

Magi forged these idols,

they did so in the image of those whose
powers they wished to channel.

283

310
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,314
Listen, he's scared, man.
And for good reason.

311
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,649
He's entitled to know that we have
the situation under control.

312
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,319
Well, that control is only
as strong as the secret.

313
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,613
The less people who know, the better.

314
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,781
He risked everything, everything for us.

315
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,326
He took an arrow... For you.

316
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,246
He has my trust.
Why doesn't he have yours?

317
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,002
Malcolm's gonna try and get the idol to
Darhk, if he hasn't done it already.

318
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,547
I can go there as ADA and
have the entire cellblock searched.

319
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,966
Do it.

320
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,551
Speedy, you and Spartan
go back to the bunker.

321
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,304
Work CCTV, work facial recognition.

322
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,182
Anything that we can do
to get a line on Merlyn.

323
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,309
-Okay.
-And what can I do?

324
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:21,105
You should go home and rest.
You've done enough for tonight.

325
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,689
What about you?

326
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,942
I'll be right behind you,
I'm just gonna run down a lead.

00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,602
-What about you?
-Reiter's still in the catacombs.

334
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,064
If he's found that idol,
you won't be able to stop him.

335
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:09,111
{\an8}We don't need to stop him.
We need to trap him.

336
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,992
You guys are doing
a wonderful job in there.

337
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,870
You know, I've been meaning
to redecorate the place myself.

338
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,123
You know, my office received
an anonymous tip that

339
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:24,585
contraband intended for your use
was smuggled into this prison.

340
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,378
-Hmm?
-Hmm.

341
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,297
Find anything? All right.

342
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,715
Search every cell in this tier.

343
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:32,051
I wanna make sure none of his friends
are stashing anything for him.

344
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,683
You know, you're lucky I'm not the man,
that you think I am, Ms. Lance.

345
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:42,936
If I were the man that your
father so vehemently claims,

346
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:44,396
you'd be in a lot of trouble
right now, wouldn't you?

347
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,066
Are you threatening an
Assistant District Attorney?

348
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,400
Oh, no! No, no, no. Not at all.

349
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,737
Just merely trying to figure out where
your father gets these vicious ideas from.

350
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,158
Oh. (GASPING) I hope
his mind isn't starting to go.

351
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,745
You know dementia is sometimes an
after effect of long term alcoholism.

352
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:00,954
You're a son-of-a-bitch.

353
00:18:01,037 --> 00:18:05,501
Regardless, it's comforting to know
that his heart is in the right place.

354
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,546
A father who would do anything to
protect his daughter from the dark.

355
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,177
I'll see you in court.

356
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,316
GREEN ARROW: Looking for something?

357
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,027
Oh. Jeez, man. Do you know how to knock?

358
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,488
(SIGHS) Any luck finding Merlyn?

359
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,283
No, but I think you already knew that.

360
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,953
I'm gonna ask you again,
what are you looking for?

361
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:47,083
Surveillance. Okay, look.
HIVE knows I'm John's brother.

362
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,544
They could've hidden bugs here.

363
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,463
Maybe that's how that one-handed friend
of yours found me in the first place.

364
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,299
You always have an answer for everything.

365
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,966
Hey, what are you talking about?

366
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,595
I think, that you've been working
with Darhk since the beginning.

367
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:04,059
That you and Merlyn have been
playing us this entire time,

368
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:08,189
and now you're here looking
for the missing piece of the idol.

369
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:12,818
I'm on your side, remember?
I even got hurt trying to protect you.

370
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,320
I remember.

(GROANING)

373
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:22,161
I told John to trust you.
To give you another chance.

374
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,622
But I was wrong.
Because men like you don't change.

375
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,750
Now, you tell me.

376
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,503
What does Darhk have planned?

377
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,547
If I'm the man that you think I am,

378
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,300
then you know torture is not
gonna get me to say anything.

379
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,760
I haven't started torturing you yet.

(GROANING)

381
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:41,930
What the hell are you doing?

382
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:44,099
Showing you who he really is. Tell him.

383
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,434
John, he thinks I'm a traitor.

kevlar won't protect.

386
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,234
Let him go.

387
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,237
(GROANS)

388
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,200
Dig, you can't trust him.

389
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,618
-Get out.
-John!

390
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,827
Now.

391
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,002
DIGGLE: You had no right!

392
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,756
I had every right.
This is about keeping us safe.

393
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,174
No, it's not, Oliver.
This is about you controlling

394
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,385
everything and everyone around you.

395
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,844
Andy tipped us off to the missile heist,

396
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:24,139
we go there, Merlyn comes
here and takes the idol.

397
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,893
Then he brings us to Merlyn's hideout,
where we're met with an ambush.

398
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,228
Where he took an arrow for you.

399
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,562
That could've been a feint.

400
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,733
When I confronted him at your
apartment, he was tearing it apart!

401
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,026
Looking for surveillance.

402
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,194
Or, he was looking for
the last piece of the idol.

403
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,990
John, you are the one who always tells me

404
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:45,160
"Do not have a blind spot
when it comes to your family."

405
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,288
And you're the one who told me
to give Andy a second chance.

406
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,581
You were the one who wanted
to extract him from HIVE.

407
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:53,126
You're the one who said he can come back
from the darkness, the same way you did.

408
00:20:53,209 --> 00:20:56,380
But I didn't. Not really. I have tried.

409
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,342
I have tried harder at this,
than I ever have at anything.

410
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:05,306
But at the end of the day, I'm who those
five years away turned me into.

411
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,015
I'm what they turned me into.

412
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,476
So, what, Oliver?

413
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,937
Just because Felicity left you,
I'm supposed to believe that

414
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,022
all men are incapable of redemption?

415
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:16,942
Not all men are like you, Oliver.
Some of us change.

416
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,361
Some of us grow.

417
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,739
Some of us evolve.

418
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,491
You are stuck, man.

419
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,702
Stuck in your self-pity
and self-righteousness

420
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,037
and that is why Felicity left you.

421
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,127
My brother is my business.

422
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,590
You have no idea what he's been through,

423
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,800
and you sure as hell
had no right to judge him.

424
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:52,561
-I'm sure he didn't mean that, Ollie.
-Yes he did.

425
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:56,064
How'd it go at Iron Heights?

426
00:21:56,147 --> 00:22:01,277
Turned up a few burner cell phones,
six bags of heroin, and no idol.

427
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,196
Well... (SIGHS)

428
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:06,074
We're hacked into the security
system at the prison so...

429
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:07,868
If anything happens, we'll see it.

430
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:09,953
Right.

431
00:22:36,312 --> 00:22:39,315
Hey? Are you okay?

432
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,359
John and I had a difference of opinion.

433
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,778
About Andy?

434
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,363
I confronted Andy, and Dig walked in.

435
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,823
-Mmm.
-Yeah.

436
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:50,702
Probably should've taken
your advice, District Attorney Lance.

437
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,704
I'm still just an ADA.

438
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,123
I'm turning down the promotion.

439
00:22:55,206 --> 00:22:57,000
Because it's being offered by Ruvé Darhk?

440
00:22:57,083 --> 00:23:02,714
No. Because taking the job means giving
up my place here, with you, and the team.

441
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,382
Team's falling apart.

442
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:11,682
John's furious with me.
Thea is consumed with rage for Malcolm.

443
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:16,562
And, well, Felicity is gone.

444
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,231
Becoming District Attorney is
something that you've worked

445
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,733
the better part of three years for.

446
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,570
I might've wanted to be DA,
but that was a lifetime ago.

447
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,821
Sara's lifetime.

448
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,740
You channeled your grief and

449
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,367
became the Black Canary.

450
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,161
But Sara's not dead anymore.

451
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,206
Maybe you owe it to yourself
to pursue the path you were on.

452
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,874
-You're serious?
-This city

453
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,585
has enough heroes with masks on.

454
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:44,214
With Ruvé Darhk as mayor,
it needs a hero without a mask.

455
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,258
It needs Laurel Lance.

456
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,346

Ah! Uh, are you in touch with the land?

459
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,356
Spend much time in Mother Nature?

460
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:07,112
No. Well, your ancestors did. And they
knew that life is a series of phases.

a time to die, a time to plant,

621
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:42,580
He's out supervising the manhunt
for the escaped prisoners.

622
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:43,956
Listen, you gotta get him
on the phone, all right?

623
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:46,751
'Cause I gotta talk to him. 'Cause I gotta
get out of here. Just for an hour.

624
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,503
Then I'll surrender
myself back in, all right?

625
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,421
It's fine. But, just, just...

626
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,299
Get Lieutenant Pike on the phone. Please.

627
00:35:05,811 --> 00:35:07,105
Laurel, is she...

628
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,439
Laurel's in surgery.

629
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,607
Um...

630
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,067
I don't know.

631
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,862
I've tried calling Lance, too, so...

632
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,574
What happened with Darhk?

633
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,620
He's in the wind.
Along with 50 or so inmates.

634
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,497
(SIGHS)

635
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,166
And Andy.

636
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,799
You warned me, and I didn't listen.

637
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,554
How am I gonna be able to forgive myself?

638
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,685
Oh, my God.

639
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,860
She's out of recovery.
She's gonna be fine.

640
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,739
She's a strong woman, your friend.

641
00:35:59,114 --> 00:36:00,491
The strongest.

642
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,285
She's been asking for you.

643
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,675
Hi.

644
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,344
Hey, yourself.

645
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,179
Did Darhk?

646
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,347
Don't worry about him.

647
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,599
Just worry about getting better, okay?

648
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,310
It's not exactly how I wanted
my last night to go.

649
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,187
What are you talking about?

650
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,646
It's a long story.

651
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,442
I was gonna give up being
the Black Canary, but...

652
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,445
I realized I didn't know how I could.

653
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:43,117
Because going out there,
and fighting alongside you guys...

654
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,663
That's what makes me feel alive inside.

655
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,710
And I love you guys so much.

656
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,295
We love you.

657
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,588
We love you.

658
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:57,798
We love you.

659
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,596
We should probably let you get some rest.

660
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,016
We'll be right outside, okay?

661
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,559
Okay.

662
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,069
You should probably get some rest, too.

663
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,532
No chance. I'm gonna stay right here.

664
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,742
It's...

665
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,372
There's, uh, something in my left pouch.
Will you bring it to me?

666
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,249
Yeah.

667
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,423
-May I?
-Yeah.

668
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,934
You kept this.

669
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,270
Yeah.

670
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:01,028
It's a little reminder of when
things were simpler.

671
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,574
For us.

672
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,411
The way we used to be.

673
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,290
I'm really glad that you found Felicity.

674
00:38:14,124 --> 00:38:16,377
I hope you find your way back to her.

675
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,800
And I know, that I am
not the love of your life,

676
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,138
but you will always be the love of mine.

677
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,142
Why are you telling me this?

678
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:33,978
(LAUREL SNIVELS)

679
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,313
Why now?

680
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,483
Because tonight it was
just a reminder that...

681
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,987
Anything can happen.

682
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,032
Which is why I need you to
promise me something.

683
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,752
Just got off the phone with Captain Lance.

684
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,671
He's on his way.
I told him that she's doing fine.

685
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:03,799
DOCTOR SCHWARTZ: Out of the way!

686
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:07,928
MALE NURSE: She's seizing.

687
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,848
DOCTOR SCHWARTZ: Embolism! I need
5,000 units of Heparin Polis.

688
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,934
What happened?

689
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,353
(STAMMERING)
Uh, I don't know. She was fine.

690
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,147
DOCTOR SCHWARTZ: Paddles.

691
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,650
-MALE NURSE: Charging 200. Go.
-Clear.

692
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,192
DOCTOR SCHWARTZ: Clear.

693
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,155
MALE NURSE: Nothing.

694
00:39:27,072 --> 00:39:30,618
DOCTOR SCHWARTZ: Let's gag her.
Open up an air way right away.

695
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,912
Come on. Come on.

696
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,710
MALE NURSE: Lodge 30 percent drop.

697
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,879
DOCTOR SCHWARTZ: Come on!
FEMALE NURSE: 6-12.

698
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,216
Come on, Laurel.

699
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,136
FEMALE NURSE: No response.

700
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,562
Time of death, 11:59.

701
