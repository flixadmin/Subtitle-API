1
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:32,291
Sergio.

2
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:37,958
You were up pretty late studying again.

3
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,583
Come on, get up.

4
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,458
We're waiting on you for breakfast.

5
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,250
Tatiana is here.

6
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,041
Good morning.

7
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,750
Little Prince Hamlet.

8
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,750
Let me introduce Tatiana.

9
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:20,666
Hello.

10
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:22,625
Nice to meet you.

11
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,583
Isn't she the most beautiful woman
in the world?

12
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:28,833
- I didn't know that.
- No?

13
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:30,583
So, you work in, um…

14
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,458
Well, I'm a concert pianist.

15
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:35,166
You… You play classical piano?

16
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,625
Yes. Schumann, Chopin, Bach.

17
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:39,625
Those fingers are divine.

18
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:42,041
For the piano and for robberies as well.

19
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:43,500
- Mm.
- Mm.

20
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:44,958
Pardon?

21
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,291
She's a thief and apparently a good one.

22
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:50,125
Piano and jewels, my two specialties.

23
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:53,250
By the way, she loves
the Bank of Spain heist.

24
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:57,791
I told her about it.

25
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:01,750
- You told her?
- Yes.

26
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,791
We don't have secrets.

27
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:08,000
In fact, she thinks this job is much
better than yours at the Royal Mint.

28
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:14,500
Can we talk for a second, just us?

29
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:16,875
Are you crazy?

30
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:17,833
Could be.

31
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,583
Andrés, what'll happen when…

32
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,875
when they offer a reward of 1, 2, 3
million euros for that information?

33
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:25,416
Because in a heist like this,
that's what's going to happen.

34
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,166
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

35
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,208
You're insinuating that
the love of my life is going to betray me.

36
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,541
Look, I'm not insinuating.
I'm telling you.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,208
Okay, fine, put blind faith in true love.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,291
- Shit!
- Let's go inside.

39
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:42,125
"Let's put blind faith in true love,"
you were saying and I say, "Absolutely."

40
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:46,375
You think Tatiana won't sell you out?
Listen to me. She's a thief.

41
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,958
What happens when she has
to turn you in or go to prison?

42
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,541
You're only saying that
because you've never been in love.

43
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,458
I'm being objective. My thoughts
haven't been clouded by feelings.

44
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,583
Look, let me tell you about Tatiana.

45
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,958
I traveled Europe with her,
cracking safes.

46
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:04,333
You know how tensions run high during
a heist, there's always conflict.

47
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,333
"You place the charges wrong."

48
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:09,791
"Where's the diamond drill?" The slightest
mistake and it all goes to shit.

49
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:13,958
But not the two of us, nothing.
Nothing. We're on cloud nine.

50
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:17,916
We've spend 14 hours
in a disgusting basement digging a tunnel.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,166
And we made love
like there was no tomorrow.

52
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,625
Couples argue when
they go to Marbella on vacation.

53
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:27,666
The two of us held up a Crédit Agricole
and it was like being on our honeymoon.

54
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,916
So, just like
your last four marriages then.

55
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,791
That was uncalled for.

56
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:36,250
Below the belt and completely beneath you
as a brother and as a man.

57
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,791
- Morning, Giovanni.
- Good morning.

58
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,708
Mr. Andrés, I offer you
fruit from the vegetable garden.

59
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,583
Thank you so much, Abbot Giovanni.

60
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,166
How are you, Joao?

61
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,291
How are you doing with Gregorian chants?

62
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,750
Oh, heavenly, Mr. Andrés.

63
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,750
I'm very happy.

64
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:08,166
- I hope you have a good day!
- Thank you, you too.

65
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,958
Giovanni, next time bring limoncello.

66
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,166
Wait for it!

67
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,583
You even let these monks go to the kitchen
with all the plans on the walls.

68
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,291
Come on, they call me "Mr. Engineer."

69
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,416
They think we're academics, not thieves.
Why are you such a pessimist?

70
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,291
How long have you known Tatiana? How long?

71
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:31,583
Why does it matter? You can't time love.

72
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:33,416
You have to live it.

73
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,625
You can't risk the entire plan
for a woman.

74
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:39,291
That's the first rule.
Andrés, rule number one.

75
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,958
"A job can't be tainted
by a romantic relationship."

76
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:43,875
Never.

77
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,375
It's not hard to understand.

78
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,500
It's seven. We have to make
our check-up call.

79
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,833
Can you call Palermo, please?

80
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:05,875
Palermo, situation?

81
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:10,000
We've reached ten tons.
10,700 kilograms of granulated metal.

82
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:12,958
- Two percent more than we expected.
- Obliterating records.

83
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,041
<i>Like Usain Bolt.</i>

84
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,083
And the defenses?

85
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:19,666
- We're still welding. We got two so far.
- <i>Anything else?</i>

86
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,166
Everything's in order. How about there?

87
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,000
No complications. Over and out.

88
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:29,416
Come in. Don't be shy.

89
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,958
We're evaluating the risks.

90
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,250
Luis, look at me.

91
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:42,250
Let me tell you,

92
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:45,041
I've got every color of pill
sitting on my nightstand.

93
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,000
I never want to get out of my bed.

94
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,458
After the last two years,
I've had erectile dysfunction

95
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,916
because of those fucking bastards.

96
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:55,291
Post-traumatic stress.

97
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,000
I think it might be best
if you stop coming down here.

98
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,291
Take Mercedes out of town,
relax, look after yourself.

99
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,208
Just don't turn on the fucking TV.

100
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,125
Don't make the same mistake I did.

101
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,791
If you have to drop a 20-megaton bomb
on their heads, do it! Just do it!

102
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,666
Don't think about the consequences!

103
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,708
That's much better

104
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,625
than dropping shitty little bombs
every couple of hours.

105
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,166
If you don't hit them hard,

106
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,708
those sneaky bastards
will wipe their asses with us.

107
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:26,166
They can wipe their asses with me
or hang me out to dry

108
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,083
as long as
they don't reveal state secrets.

109
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,666
If we bust in there, Alfonso,

110
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,791
we'll all end up court-martialed.

111
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,250
- Or worse.
- So what then?

112
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:40,166
You wanna just stay here
with our hands tied?

113
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,750
We just have to neutralize his next move.

114
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,708
Look. Does the public know
what those secrets are?

115
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:50,250
No! Not even God knows.

116
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,958
Well, Intelligence knows
what they look like, right?

117
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,541
Which paper to use, which stamps.

118
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,000
Phenomenal.

119
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,541
{\an8}So, we'll make our own secrets.

120
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:07,541
{\an8}We'll infiltrate the news and every paper
and every TV in the country

121
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,875
{\an8}as if we were the Professor.

122
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,500
{\an8}Please, what you're saying--

123
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:14,666
{\an8}Commissioners on drug lord's payrolls,
ministers taking bribes, orgies…

124
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,208
{\an8}paid for by using
government funds, whatever.

125
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,541
{\an8}Hold on, think about what you're saying.

126
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,666
{\an8}We can't do that. We would shit all over
the credibility of the system.

127
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,708
{\an8}That means the police, politics,
institutions. Everything.

128
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,041
{\an8}It won't. The media…

129
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,958
{\an8}They'll start checking the information.

130
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:33,166
{\an8}They'll all have an alibi. Where was
what's his name? In his hometown!

131
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,125
{\an8}Shit! Where else?
The Minister? In a meeting in Brussels.

132
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,875
{\an8}So when the Professor,
our faithful shepherd,

133
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,958
{\an8}reveals the true state secrets…

134
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,625
{\an8}not even God
could separate the wheat from the chaff.

135
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,208
{\an8}We've removed the ace up his sleeve.
You know the best part?

136
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:54,083
{\an8}By the time he recovers,
we'll have been in the bank and out again.

137
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,291
{\an8}And that's a promise.

DAY TWO

148
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,333
{\an8}Are you all right?

149
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,250
{\an8}Ah, my… my stomach hurts.

150
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,625
{\an8}From the gunshot.

151
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:25,625
{\an8}Here.

152
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,083
{\an8}It's pretty sore from the impact.

153
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,708
{\an8}Let me see.

154
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,083
{\an8}Oh my God, I'm sorry.

155
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,375
{\an8}And the constipation.

156
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,375
{\an8}Given the situation,
you can imagine. Right?

157
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:42,000
{\an8}Of course. Yeah.

158
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,916
Pass the coffee.

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,250
- You, come with me.
- Me?

160
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,458
Of course you. Who the fuck else?
Come on, get up.

161
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,375
Let's go.

162
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,166
Come on, get in.

163
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,375
Stand over there, against the wall.

164
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,250
What the fuck were you doing?

165
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,166
Sorry!

166
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,333
Were you flirting
by talking about shitting?

167
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:12,791
I was trying to tell her
my stomach's a mess, I've got gas.

168
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,041
For fuck's sake!

169
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,583
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

170
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,875
Do you like that girl?

171
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,166
Yes.

172
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,666
- A lot.
- A lot.

173
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,500
A lot and you thought,

174
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,000
that talking about constipation,

175
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,791
your fucking clogged intestines,

176
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:32,916
and flirting like an idiot
would reel her in?

177
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,583
What the hell were you thinking?
From now on, you're a fucking hero.

178
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,291
A fucking hero. Nothing can hurt you.

179
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,375
You're gonna give her
some of your food every day.

180
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,583
Every single day.

181
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,791
And if I'm acting like a prick,
you're gonna stand up to me.

182
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,416
Starting now. Stand up to me.

183
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,458
Fucking stand up to me!

184
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,375
Yes, sir!

185
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,291
I'm sorry…

186
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,708
about, uh…

187
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,125
shooting you in the vest.

188
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,791
It wasn't my proudest moment.

189
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:18,208
Don't worry, Mr. Denver.
I know these things can happen in a heist.

190
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,250
It is not easy, Miguel. Not easy.

191
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:24,000
Let me tell you something.

192
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,291
I know

193
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:28,791
that with my intelligence

194
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,416
and that little smile of yours,
that grin right there, yeah…

195
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,875
We're gonna win Amanda over.

196
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:39,541
How about it?
Think you can give it a shot?

197
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,833
Well, I'll do my best, Mr. Denver.

198
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:42,916
Of course you will.

199
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,166
Now, get in there and don't come out
until you've taken a shit. Come on.

200
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,083
Okay.

201
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,458
Mr. Denver?

202
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:03,666
Yeah?

203
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,125
I can't concentrate
with you standing there.

204
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,875
<i>We interrupt the program</i>
<i>to bring you the news</i>

205
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:17,083
<i>of the largest classified information leak</i>
<i>in our country's history.</i>

206
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:21,083
<i>This program has gained access</i>
<i>to more than 100 classified documents.</i>

207
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,791
<i>Spain sold cluster bombs</i>
<i>to Saddam Hussein</i>

208
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,625
<i>just six months prior</i>

209
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:27,541
No, no.

210
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,125
<i>This is just one</i>
<i>of the so-called "CNI papers."</i>

211
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,666
<i>A mass declassification of state secrets…</i>

212
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,000
- It's all over the media.
- Those secrets are false.

213
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,250
They're deactivating the best plan
we have to negotiate for Rio.

214
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,541
No, that's not it.

215
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,916
They're taking away our shield
so they can go in.

216
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,833
I understand, Minister.

217
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,541
Gentlemen, we've been given a green light
from the president.

218
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:49,625
Get in formation!

219
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:52,333
We'll inject extremely high-pressure gas.

220
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:54,416
Halothane, strong narcotic.

221
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,000
That means they should be unconscious
in no more than 30 minutes,

222
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,166
but be alert for absolutely anything.

223
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,958
- Palermo, do you copy?
- <i>I can hear you.</i>

224
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:06,666
<i>They're coming in. Get everybody together.</i>
<i>They're going to attack.</i>

225
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,916
When? What type of attack?

226
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,833
I don't know yet. I'll call again soon.

227
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:13,000
Marseille, they're gonna enter.
We need to know where from.

228
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,541
Report any type of movement.

229
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,333
We need to get off the highway.
Find a road.

230
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,458
In 300 meters, take a left.

231
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:22,958
Farm to Market Road.

232
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,000
What's happening?

233
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,291
We passed that car yesterday,
90 kilometers from here.

234
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:34,541
- How do you know it's the same one?
- M5354XX. It's the same!

235
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,208
Don't talk to me like that!

236
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,625
- Not now, not ever!
- Stop. Not now, please!

237
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:46,958
The antenna, fuck!

238
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,083
Palermo! Palermo, do you copy?

239
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,125
Stuck. We have to get it out.

240
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,041
Go!

241
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:16,166
Dad!

242
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,250
It's the Professor!

243
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:25,708
Dad! It's… the Professor! The Professor!

244
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,541
And the inspector!

245
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,458
Yes, that's right, I'm, ah…

246
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,250
the… the Professor and this…

247
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,000
is, ah… Inspector--

248
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:51,916
Lisbon.

249
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,125
- We didn't see any blimps around here.
- No.

250
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:05,125
So, you guys need a hand to get this
out of the mud or what?

251
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,250
Come on, let's go!

252
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,833
We'll have this thing out in no time!

253
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,125
All at once.

254
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,583
Wait for it to get in. Wait. Okay, wait.

255
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:14,916
Now, give it some juice.

256
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,166
Come on! Back it in.
Come on guys, come on.

257
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,333
Get it out, come on. Keep pushing.

258
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,458
Go, keep going!

259
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,166
Come on.

260
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,500
Something's not right.

261
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,166
I thought they were hostages.

262
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,625
Hey, kid!

263
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,833
Weren't you a hostage?

264
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,000
I was recruited, all right?

265
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,458
Now all of you shut the fuck up!

266
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,125
Ladies and gentlemen, they're coming in.

267
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,083
We all know what that means, don't we?

268
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,833
I'd love to give you more information.
Sadly, we don't have it.

269
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,583
So there's only one thing to do.

270
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:03,291
To use violence as a deterrent.

271
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,250
What?

272
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,625
We see an armored unit
and we'll riddle it with bullets.

273
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,833
We'll push them back.

274
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,500
- Did that order come from the Professor?
- We lost contact with the Professor.

275
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,041
I don't know if it's a technical glitch
or something serious.

276
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:22,250
The fact is, we're alone.

277
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,833
So I'm in charge now.

278
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,666
Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Hmm?

279
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:34,458
We don't know where they'll enter
or if they have an armored unit.

280
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,458
If they'll come through the windows
or the fucking sewer.

281
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,208
Tell me.

282
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,833
Where the fuck will you launch missiles?

283
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,208
Have we all gone crazy or what?

284
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,125
Are you fucking kidding?

285
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,250
Those are our people outside.

286
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,083
We came in here dropping money.

287
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,833
Not bombs.

288
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,541
This would never be the Professor's plan.

289
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,333
He'd try to buy time.

290
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:11,208
So now Miss Trigger-Happy wants
to buy more time. That's interesting.

291
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,375
- You know what I think?
- What do you think?

292
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:19,916
That you know if we pull out the big guns
they're not gonna give you Rio back.

293
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,666
They're gonna burn us with napalm!

294
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,041
What the fuck is wrong with you?

295
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,250
Let's go! Wake up for fuck's sake!

296
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,708
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

297
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:33,750
Sorry, Tokyo.

298
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,125
You knew this might happen, Tokyo.

299
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,708
- Honey.
- No.

300
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,291
My heart goes out to you, it really does.

301
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,750
But we need to defend ourselves.

302
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,916
Bogotá.

303
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:49,916
Take that one.

304
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,500
Time is of the essence, people.
Let's go!

305
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,375
- It's gonna work.
- Let's do it.

306
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,291
Stop fucking around. Right now
this is the only friend you've got.

307
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:25,250
- Where is everyone?
- Probably eating a pig.

308
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,166
This could use a little more oil.

309
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,708
No, no, no, please don't!
Please don't! Oh! Oh! Oh!

310
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,666
He's one of the gang!

311
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,666
Cincinnati is part of the gang.

312
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,041
- Don't kill me yet!
- No, big guy!

313
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,958
- Kill police.
- Hey no, no!

314
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,625
This is a guitar. Can you play?

315
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,666
- I'll be on drums.
- Get 'em.

316
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,666
Guitar!

317
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,958
- Cincinnati, give me five.
- No…

318
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,458
- No.
- See?

319
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,500
Listen.

320
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,916
Whatever you're thinking right now,
let it go.

321
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:58,625
Hmm?

322
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,041
Hmm?

323
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:02,500
What is this? So you can read my mind now?

324
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,291
I don't need to be a psychic
to read your mind.

325
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,583
Ever since we got back together,

326
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:11,250
you've just been…
running that guilt machine.

327
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,375
So quit it.

328
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,250
You were all having
fucking good time, man.

329
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,500
And you gave it all up to come here.

330
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,125
Of course I'm gonna start
that machine sometimes.

331
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:25,250
You're gonna listen to me
and you are gonna listen to me good.

332
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:28,541
And it's all gonna sink
into that beautiful little head of yours.

333
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,041
You are a free woman.

334
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,458
You're free to go partying,
you're free to go to a deserted island,

335
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,208
you're free to leave
this planet if you feel like it.

336
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,208
Got it?

337
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,375
You know who screwed up first?

338
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:45,875
The Professor.

339
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:50,333
Yeah. He should've known you'd never
be happy stuck out there on an island.

340
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:52,291
Who are you, Bin Laden?

341
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,750
You know I'm right. Your name is Tokyo.

342
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,708
The second screw-up came from Rio.

343
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,333
He bought the phones. He couldn't
control himself and he called you.

344
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,791
You wanna know the truth?

345
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,958
We didn't come here
just to do you a little favor.

346
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,333
- Look at that giant slab of cake.
- Look at that.

347
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,291
We're all here
because we can't get enough.

348
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,416
We love this shit.

349
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,000
So stop looking at Cincinnati
like he's already an orphan.

350
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,458
Get over it. Let's have some fun.

351
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,166
Because this is a fucking party.

352
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,916
Party time, sister.

353
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:41,666
Yeah!

354
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,125
Everybody sit down.
Let's go to the table.

355
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,083
- Come on.
- I'm so excited.

356
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,875
Oh, I'm so hungry. I made a salad.

357
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,625
What the fuck is this?

358
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,541
- Artichokes.
- Artichokes?

359
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,583
Ran out of rabbit food?

360
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,208
Come on, we got a load of vegetables
from the monks.

361
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:02,333
And I'm a vegan if you haven't noticed.
So today, on my birthday. It's vegan.

362
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,875
We don't listen
because vegans are the new Taliban.

363
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,416
They're terrorists!

364
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,458
- Hold on.
- You won't stop until we die of boredom!

365
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,958
What do you mean "boredom?"

366
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,291
Everything healthy is boring.

367
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:15,708
Who calls their friends and says,

368
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:18,791
"Come to my place,
I've got some beautiful artichokes."

369
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,625
Because eating artichokes

370
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:23,208
is just not fun.

371
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:27,541
Fun is going to a friend's place
and eating a nice goat or roast pig.

372
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:31,000
Or getting 50 guys together
in a country house to eat a cow.

373
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,708
Now, that's fun.

374
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:37,416
I'm sorry for the cow
but it brings people together.

375
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:41,083
Meat unites, the cow unites.
The artichokes…

376
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:42,083
divide.

377
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:46,333
Ah. Well, you know what they say,
"Eat vegan now, eat vegan pussy later."

378
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:51,500
- I can be vegan for you, my love.
- Not even with the ten-foot pole, honey.

379
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,083
She wants it.

380
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,875
My ten-foot pole…

381
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,041
Professor?

382
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:00,333
What are the chances of us getting
out of the bank alive?

383
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,250
At this moment, I would say…

384
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,125
probably less than 50 percent.

385
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,458
In that case, I'd like to say a few words.

386
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,250
Well, they're not my words
but let's pretend they are.

387
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,500

What's going on, Manolo?

404
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,750
The damn thing's gone
and got stuck in the mud.

405
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:50,250
And where is that from?

406
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,166
My cousin Antonio from Madrid.

407
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,916
It's… It's the Professor's.

408
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,250
What did you say, Perico?

409
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:01,541
My cousin Antonio.
He's a professor in Madrid.

410
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:03,416
Oh, yeah?

411
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:09,291
Juan and I are going
to take it to Portugal, you know?

412
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,541
- For seven days.
- Just stay quiet, huh?

413
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:14,041
Eating salted codfish like kings.

414
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:18,041
This thing's enormous, huh?

415
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,333
And inside is like a house, right?

416
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:22,916
Yeah, a little apartment.

417
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,375
- Can I go in?
- No!

418
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:31,375
It's just that more shit on your boots
than a cow's ass.

419
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:36,958
I mean, you'd stain it,
the carpet and everything.

420
00:24:40,166 --> 00:24:41,375
Relax, man.

421
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,125
Here we go.

422
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,875
A kitchen and everything.

423
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:06,833
A fridge.

424
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:12,833
Unbelievable.

425
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,458
Every comfort.

426
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,666
Professors don't live too bad.

427
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:30,625
I'll get one of these for my retirement.

428
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:31,666
Yeah?

429
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,375
Let me start the car
and help get this out.

430
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:35,833
Thanks, Paco.

431
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:37,916
No problem.

432
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:45,666
Push!

433
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,666
Push, come on.

434
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:16,416
Wow!
Give me a hug, Professor!

435
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:18,791
Thank you.

436
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:32,625
- <i>How's it going, Marseille?</i>
- They've got a tanker truck.

437
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:35,166
They're putting some tubes
the ventilation ducts.

438
00:26:35,666 --> 00:26:36,666
<i>Anything else?</i>

439
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,666
That's all.

440
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,708
Thanks.

441
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:43,583
Narcotic gas. Probably halothane.

442
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:44,500
I know Sierra.

443
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,625
She's gonna do it like Putin
in the Dubrovka Theater siege in Moscow.

444
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:49,125
How far to the transfer point?

445
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:52,125
Twelve kilometers.

446
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,500
Hello? Anyone there?

447
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:19,916
- Turn the volume.
- <i>I know them well.</i>

448
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,375
<i>For example, we should use</i>
<i>harsher interrogation</i> <i>techniques</i>

449
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:25,458
<i>on terrorists. Wh… What do you think?</i>

450
00:27:25,541 --> 00:27:27,416
<i>Are his rights being violated?</i>

451
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,708
<i>Shouldn't an innocent life be worth more</i>
<i>than the life of a terrorist?</i>

452
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:32,333
<i>What you're saying here, Mr. Román,</i>

453
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:34,625
<i>is that the police</i>
<i>have been practicing torture?</i>

454
00:27:34,708 --> 00:27:36,166
Oh, for fuck's sake.

455
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:42,083
Can I go home yet?

456
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:45,500
No, you can't go home.

457
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:48,041
Your statements are
putting everyone at risk.

458
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,791
You'll stay here until you learn
to keep your mouth shut.

459
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:56,416
Where were you during the last heist?

460
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:57,958
Sorry?

461
00:27:58,041 --> 00:27:59,500
Because I was inside.

462
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:04,000
Standing up to the terrorists,
saving the lives of 19 hostages.

463
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:07,916
You brought me in here as an expert. Hmm?

464
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:12,208
Maybe I'm wrong,
but I'd say you got no fucking idea.

465
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,833
Now all of this is out of your league.

466
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:18,458
You know what your problem is?

467
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:19,375
No.

468
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:22,666
Your life is shit.

469
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:26,875
You go around speaking to your fans,
they applaud,

470
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:28,875
and you cum in your pants, am I right?

471
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,458
But when you get home every night,
there's nobody.

472
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:35,166
Your wife has left you.

473
00:28:35,708 --> 00:28:37,833
You live in a flat
full of cardboard boxes.

474
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,083
You eat tuna from the can
and your kids don't speak to you.

475
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:44,416
You go on about the heist because it's
the only significant moment of your life,

476
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,166
and you long for it
because you're surrounded by shit.

477
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,750
So when you see a camera,
you cling to it like a baby on a tit.

478
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:54,625
You're a sad excuse for a man.

479
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,458
Tuna from a can?

480
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:04,208
You wish.

481
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,583
I have my life set up nicely.

482
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,500
I fill theater after theater
with people whose lives I help improve.

483
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,583
My book is an international bestseller.

484
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:15,125
And everyone…

485
00:29:15,708 --> 00:29:17,000
absolutely everyone

486
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:19,625
considers me a hero in this country.

487
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,166
Tuna from a can.

488
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:25,041
That shows your ignorance!

489
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:29,416
Now, if you'll excuse me.

490
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:32,500
No, my friend.

491
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:36,250
You're not going anywhere.

492
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,083
EMERGENCY ROOM

493
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:19,250
Connected.

494
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:21,125
Palermo.

495
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:23,750
Palermo, do you copy?

496
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,750
<i>The ventilation</i>
<i>ducts in the bathroom</i>

497
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,416
are the only entrance
that might not have explosives.

498
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:41,000
<i>They were installed</i>
<i>and widened 17 months ago.</i>

499
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,833
Even so, it is a very narrow space.

500
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:47,833
<i>Forty-five by eighty centimeters.</i>

501
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:51,041
<i>We'll confirm that the gas</i>
<i>is taking effect.</i>

502
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,250
Halothane concentration 67 percent.

503
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:58,916
Gentlemen, we're going in.

504
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:08,208
This is an extremely high-risk mission.

505
00:31:08,708 --> 00:31:12,250
They've got it covered. That vent shaft
will be a fucking bloodbath.

506
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:15,750
<i>Halothane is a narcotic gas</i>
<i>which knocks you out ten seconds</i>

507
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:18,416
<i>when its concentration exceeds 50 percent.</i>

508
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:22,416
Colonel, we've reached the vent.
Looks like someone's there.

509
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:24,083
He's not moving.

510
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:36,083
<i>The police entered the bank and</i>
<i>found a room full of sleeping children.</i>

511
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,583
<i>There were five elite agents,</i>

512
00:31:38,666 --> 00:31:40,708
<i>thirty magazines full of bullets</i>

513
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:42,708
<i>and one simple objective.</i>

514
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:44,291
<i>Slaughter us like lambs.</i>

515
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:46,333
<i>And to be honest,</i>

516
00:31:46,416 --> 00:31:47,625
<i>I think we earned it.</i>

517
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,041
We'll do what Putin would do.

518
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:53,416
We'll shoot first

519
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,166
and then we'll ask questions later.

520
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,875
Try to avoid it if at all possible, okay?

521
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:02,500
But we must accept
there may be civilian casualties.

522
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:03,875
Are we clear?

523
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:05,000
Yes, sir.

524
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:06,500
Is that clear?

525
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:07,583
Yes, sir.

526
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:09,458
Clear.

527
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,583
Clear.

528
00:32:12,958 --> 00:32:13,791
Clear.

529
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:16,291
Hostage.

530
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:32,791
Hostage.

531
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:34,083
Hostage.

532
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:52,291
Stay down! Get down. Get down!

533
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:05,708
Exit left-hand door now!

534
00:33:05,791 --> 00:33:09,166
Move! Come on! Now!

535
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,291
Shield!

536
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:23,583
<i>Surviving this kind of assault</i>
<i>is impossible,</i>

537
00:33:23,666 --> 00:33:25,750
<i>but by this point in our lives,</i>

538
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:30,041
<i>we'd specialized in using the impossible</i>
<i>to our advantage.</i>

539
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:35,500
{\an8}Palermo.

540
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:37,375
{\an8}TEN MINUTES EARLIER

541
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:40,875
<i>Palermo, do you copy?</i>
<i>They're pumping in narcotic gas.</i>

542
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,208
Professor. It's Tokyo.

543
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,625
Professor, all entry points are covered.

544
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:55,500
We have to be sure
where they're going to enter.

545
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:59,333
They'll wait until it's full of gas.
We've ten minutes.

546
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,875
Change of plans.

547
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:09,833
Retreat!

548
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:15,541
<i>Oxygen was the only thing</i>
<i>we needed to fight them.</i>

549
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:18,000
<i>And to neutralize them,</i>

550
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:21,041
<i>we just had to block their route</i>
<i>until there was no way out.</i>

551
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:26,083
Smoke!

552
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,958
How are we doing, Suárez?

553
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:45,208
See the bars?
Gorgeous, aren't they?

554
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,208
It's RDX plastic explosive.

555
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:48,416
Precisely.

556
00:34:49,166 --> 00:34:52,583
More than 40 kilograms
spread across seven charges.

557
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:57,458
I don't imagine I have to explain to you

558
00:34:57,541 --> 00:35:00,958
what would happen if you dare to touch
one of these laser beams.

559
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:03,708
This is how it works,

560
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:08,208
the detonator is connected
to a photoelectric cell,

561
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:10,541
and if one charge explodes,

562
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,875
the others will be set off

563
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,750
in response.

564
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:17,500
Right, bomb experts?

565
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:20,625
Shit!

566
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:22,375
So, I would recommend

567
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:24,708
you relax

568
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:27,541
because your oxygen is running out

569
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:30,500
and you're about
to start inhaling halothane.

570
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:31,625
So,

571
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:33,291
get on the floor,

572
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:35,291
curl up

573
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,916
and give each other
a goodnight kiss, muchachos.

574
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:43,833
Thirty-five minutes without contact.

575
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:46,916
We're preparing a rescue mission.

576
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,916
General, we can't do that.
They'll trap them the same way.

577
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,708
We don't know what happened inside.

578
00:35:51,791 --> 00:35:55,166
We know we heard the Browning machine gun
and then some return fire.

579
00:35:55,666 --> 00:35:56,583
Then, nothing.

580
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:01,208
It's him.

581
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,333
Martínez.

582
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,333
<i>Professor?</i>

583
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:31,458
I imagine you're wondering
about Suárez and his four men.

584
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:33,041
Why don't you tell me about it?

585
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:37,166
Well, I think his actions were exemplary.

586
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,000
Let's say the operation was very

587
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:41,208
commendable.

588
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:44,875
But, how can I say this?

589
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,416
There were a few complications.

590
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:52,250
Don't worry, they are in perfect health.
Completely fine.

591
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:56,041
In fact, we're sending you a video
now so you can verify that.

592
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:57,875
Martínez!

593
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:01,625
It's better if you see it yourself.

594
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:10,458
<i>I'm Inspector Suárez,</i>
<i>head of Special Operations.</i>

595
00:37:11,333 --> 00:37:13,041
<i>We're being held captive.</i>

596
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:16,333
<i>But I can confirm</i>
<i>we're being treated well.</i>

597
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,833
<i>I urge the authorities</i>

598
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:24,000
<i>to maintain a permanent ceasefire.</i>

599
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,875
<i>Very good! Very good!</i>

600
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:29,333
<i>Now the next part.</i>

601
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:31,541
<i>Come on!</i>

602
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:35,541
<i>Do the rest, let's go.</i>

603
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:58,291
How romantic.

604
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:01,833
But you're sending this to us,

605
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,708
not to the press.

606
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:06,875
I deduct the Professor wants

607
00:38:06,958 --> 00:38:08,666
<i>to negotiate.</i>

608
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:11,291
Wow, I can see you're quite the artist.

609
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,000
Listen, I can offer something better.

610
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,250
I'm offering you a way out.

611
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:20,666
The United Nations Committee
Against Torture

612
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,583
is currently investigating
the Cortés case.

613
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:24,208
In just a few hours,

614
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:27,208
they're going to send forensic experts
to examine him

615
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:29,541
and neither you
nor the president want that.

616
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,125
Son of a bitch.

617
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:33,958
So, you should give us Rio.

618
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:37,333
I'm not going to hand over a detainee.

619
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:40,000
The police don't just deliver criminals.

620
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:42,208
Of course, but there's another reason.

621
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:46,875
It's obvious,

622
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:49,791
as demonstrated by your operation,
you've already decided to kill us.

623
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:53,375
But in custody,

624
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:56,541
you can't kill Cortés. However…

625
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:00,541
inside the bank, during an escape,

626
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:01,625
or a pursuit,

627
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:03,666
that's different.

628
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:09,625
I'm offering you and the state
a better option than what you have now.

629
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:14,500
And third, I'll save you
the international ridicule

630
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:17,916
of releasing the video of your
lead commander singing "Bella Ciao."

631
00:39:19,416 --> 00:39:20,458
Hand him over.

632
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:24,541
Tell him we accept the trade.

633
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:30,166
Hand him over.

634
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:45,500
I want all the hostages and GEO agents.
I need to sell this as a victory.

635
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:49,083
I'll give you 40 hostages and your agents.

636
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:51,750
I'm sure you can sell that as a triumph.

637
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:54,375
- It's 8:00 p.m.
- <i>No.</i>

638
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:56,250
Daylight.

639
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:59,416
- The exchange will happen at 8:00 a.m.
- What are you doing?

640
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,833
I am not gonna take
40 civilians out of there

641
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:04,041
<i>without being able to see what's going on.</i>

642
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:07,875
Accepted.

643
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:18,833
- Why don't you just take over?
- That's right. Martínez!

644
00:40:23,125 --> 00:40:24,833
<i>Tokyo, they've agreed.</i>

645
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:47,416
Hello.

646
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,250
Did you get some rest?

647
00:40:57,083 --> 00:40:58,916
How long have I been asleep?

648
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,708
Fourteen hours.

649
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:04,041
I feel like I'm floating.

650
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:08,125
You wanted to take something.

651
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:11,333
So they gave you an elephant's dose.

652
00:41:11,416 --> 00:41:12,250
Remember?

653
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:15,583
Remember.

654
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:17,000
Well, come on.

655
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,958
We have to make you look handsome for TV.

656
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:21,625
Come on.

657
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:23,291
Get up.

658
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,250
Where are you taking me?

659
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,208
To school.

660
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:50,666
Can I make you some cereal?

661
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:53,875
You're gonna be a mother?

662
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:57,458
You'll go to your son's school
to tell the kids stories?

663
00:41:58,291 --> 00:41:59,416
Of course.

664
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,916
And we'll take them lollipops

665
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,583
just to fuck with those
sexually-frustrated mothers

666
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:05,041
who say candy's bad for kids.

667
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:07,791
Alicia.

668
00:42:10,958 --> 00:42:12,208
Your son won't love you.

669
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:19,083
But you're gonna adore me.

670
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:21,750
Let's go.

671
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,250
Where are we going?

672
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:26,250
To school.
