1
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:06,171
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,124
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:12,172
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,005
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,219
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

6
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:20,180
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,388
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

8
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:26,145
<i>And I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,477
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,937
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,024
Not a ghost.
I'm Leo Snart from Earth-X.

12
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,949
- I didn't do anything!
- I understand.

13
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,823
But your radioactivity is dangerous.

14
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,160
You are part of this team.

15
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,994
And I'm the only one with a body
that DeVoe is trying to snatch.

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,629
Now, you will die for me.

17
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,091
Melt.

18
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:53,968
- Killer Frost...
- Is gone.

19
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,589
<i>My new host body holds
an ancillary benefit.</i>

20
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,556
Dark matter siphoned from the room

21
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:02,636
where Dr. Wells was charging
his counterfeit cap.

22
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,595
Maximum capacity, now!

23
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,647
Again.

24
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,195
Dr. Wells, the odds of a different
conclusion are extremely low.

25
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,820
- Run it again.
- Yes, Dr. Wells.

26
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,203
Same results, Dr. Wells.

27
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,916
The excessive infusion of dark matter
into your neural system,

28
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,459
has disrupted the area of the brain

29
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,912
where general intelligence
and executive function occur.

30
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,878
My ability to integrate information
is declining.

31
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,261
I'm losing my intelligence.

32
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,179
At some point soon,
you'll need to re-learn

33
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,929
everything you've ever known.

34
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:45,888
Is there a way to use the
thinking cap to reverse this process?

35
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,222
Unlikely, Dr. Wells.

36
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:50,650
Your thinking cap and the dark matter
is what caused this.

37
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:54,855
- I tried to caution restraint...
- I know!

38
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,571
Gideon, how long
before everything I know

39
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,994
is gone?

40
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,328
You know, it's only been
a couple of days since he died,

41
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,839
but it still doesn't feel real.

42
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,125
How close were you with Ralph?

43
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,545
We were becoming close.

44
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,473
Yeah, it took me a while

45
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,643
to see past the things
that I didn't like when we first met,

46
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:26,970
but after a while,

47
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:29,522
I started to see what a good guy
he was.

48
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,231
Started to see the hero
that he became.

49
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,652
You consider him a hero?

50
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,693
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

51
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,650
What about you, Barry?
How are you feeling?

52
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:45,330
I'm fine. I mean, you know,
I'm working through it.

53
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,874
So, you weren't
as close to him as Iris was?

54
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,123
No. I mean, we were about the same,
I'd say.

55
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,580
They used to work together.

56
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,797
- Oh?
- Yeah.

57
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,378
And you're fine already
with his death?

58
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,963
I've dealt with a lot of death
in my life.

59
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,090
Yes, you have.

60
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:08,804
Your mother, father, Eddie,
Ronnie, H.R.

61
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,434
Has Ralph's death had any impact
on you at all?

62
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:20,524
I think I just know
how to deal with death now,

63
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:23,860
so, it doesn't affect me
as much as it once did.

64
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,198
All right,
I guess we'll pick this up later.

65
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,452
Yeah.

66
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:34,921
- Same time next week?
- Or before, if you need.

67
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:38,671
Barry, grief is a complex emotion,

68
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,798
that as you know
deals on its own terms.

69
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,259
There is no practice makes perfect.

70
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,768
Thirsty, my love?

71
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,316
You're happy?

72
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,199
More than I've been in a long time,
my love.

73
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,330
To your return.

74
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,250
- I never left you, Marlize.
- It felt like you had.

75
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,747
Those days are past us now.

76
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,580
All our sacrifice, our commitment,
our planning,

77
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,509
everything is as it was and more.

78
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,215
There's been no decline
in your metabolic processes

79
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,672
since your last transference.

80
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:31,099
My mind, my abilities,
these elasticized cells,

81
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,473
can hold another bus full
of meta-humans powers,

82
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:36,023
and I still wouldn't be affected.

83
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,600
It gives me peace, Clifford.

84
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:42,731
I need your mind focused
for what happens next.

85
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,656
- We start today?
- Yes.

86
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,205
But we have time, my love.

87
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:55,914
Could we not spend time together
as husband and wife?

88
00:04:56,171 --> 00:05:01,383
- I think...
- Hmm! That is your first mistake.

89
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,676
Leave the thinking to me.

90
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:32,368
Whoa! Stop! Don't bother.

91
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,164
- It doesn't work.
- I don't know about that.

92
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,868
Yeah, well, I know about it. I'm the
guy who wore it on his head.

93
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,919
It helped you gain ground
on DeVoe, didn't it?

94
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,464
Mapping the pocket dimensions,
building the Scepter.

95
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,962
We stopped you from using it,
right when we needed it most,

96
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,418
when Ralph got...

97
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,137
We thought you were addicted.

98
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,973
We shouldn't have stopped you.
We were wrong.

99
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,971
That's not... You know,
you weren't wrong.

100
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,187
No, I was addicted.

101
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,860
Yeah. It was stupid
when you think about it.

102
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,357
Because I'm a pretty smart guy.

103
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,564
How much smarter is
this intelligence booster making me?

104
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,366
10%? I think we both agree that

105
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,695
DeVoe is at least
twice as smart as that.

106
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,655
Then maybe
I should get to wear it, too.

107
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,999
Okay, no. No.

108
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:25,007
This thing would never work on you
because I specifically designed

109
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,676
this to stimulate my brain waves.
My brain waves, not yours, okay?

110
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,129
- My cerebral firings, okay?
- Harry! Harry!

111
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,182
I'm saying we should build
a second thinking cap.

112
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,429
- Intelligence booster.
- For me.

113
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,221
- For, for you?
- Yes, for me.

114
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,147
Think about it.
Two heads are better than one.

115
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:44,068
Your ideas, my ideas,
put 'em together, we combine them,

116
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,988
we build upon each others ideas.
Harry, with two caps...

117
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,611
With two caps, we can get DeVoe.

118
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,122
Okay. Get on it.

119
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,493
Melt.

120
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:03,921
Anything new?

121
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,714
No sign of DeVoe.

122
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,421
I meant with you.

123
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,885
No. No cold signatures
anywhere in the city.

124
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:16,433
Killer Frost is nowhere to be found.

125
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,683
That doesn't make sense. DeVoe
created every bus meta for a reason.

126
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,481
I mean, he had no
interest in Barry's powers,

127
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,729
or Cisco's,
or any of the metas at Iron Heights,

128
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,902
so, I don't know
why he would suddenly want yours.

129
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:31,153
We all saw what happened. When DeVoe
touched me, my powers disappeared.

130
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,449
Had to be him.

131
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,037
DeVoe?

132
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,699
Satellite's picking up three
different pocket dimensions

133
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,455
opening in Keystone. That's each...

134
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,287
All right, you and me, all right.
Let's go.

135
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,589
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.
They all just closed.

136
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,500
- What?
- Hmm.

137
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,923
Wrong coordinates.
Maybe, he made a mistake.

138
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,677
He doesn't make mistakes.
He must want something in Keystone.

139
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,967
- Tracy Brand's lab.
- He's going after Fallout.

140
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,515
All right, call Tracy, tell her
we're coming for Borman, okay?

141
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,562
Wait, and gonna do what?

142
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,315
Just to take him somewhere else.

143
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,482
We can't take him here.

144
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,359
We can't even contain his fallout.

145
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,562
Tracy's barely been able to contain
his powers as is.

146
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,989
Yeah, the guy is a nuclear explosion
waiting to go off,

147
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,691
and I don't know about you,
but I have had

148
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,242
my fill of nuclear bombs this year.

149
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,371
But if we can cool him down,
we can get him somewhere safe.

150
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,697
What about Snart's cold gun?

151
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,204
I mean, I have a prototype,
but to modify it to our needs,

152
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,159
- that would take at least a day.
- We don't have that kinda time.

153
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,370
DeVoe is coming for him.

154
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,830
DeVoe has known our every move.
I mean, we've gotta do something

155
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,005
that he hasn't accounted for.

156
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,630
How are we supposed to find
a way to cool down Borman,

157
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,712
and take him somewhere
DeVoe won't know about,

158
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,969
with a plan he won't see coming?

159
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:40,426
Call Lyla. See if A.R.G.U.S.
has anything off the grid.

160
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,432
Okay, but even if they do,
I mean, what are we gonna do

161
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,229
about the other two problems?

162
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:57,948
War's over. Bad guys and girls lost.

163
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,747
Nazi regime's been dismantled.

164
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,245
And the rebellion's in charge now.

165
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,464
Why don't you turn yourself in?

166
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,217
Save us the Tom and Jerry.

167
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:19,424
Find some other misguided cause
to get all agro about.

168
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,688
Not this night.

169
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,562
I will fight until
every last one of you

170
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,985
finds the same fate
as my brothers and sisters.

171
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,066
Your timing is impeccable.

172
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,861
Your timing is impeccable.

173
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,620
We need your help on our Earth.

174
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,493
Right now, I'm kinda busy.

175
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,074
Doing what? Dying?

176
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,453
Touché.

177
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:10,478
So, you're trying to stop a guy who
thinks he's smarter than everyone,

178
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,275
and his true believer lover,

179
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:16,697
who are hell-bent in achieving
their evil machinations at any cost?

180
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,865
Well, it's right up my alley.

181
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,490
Except DeVoe actually is
smarter than everyone, Leo.

182
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,659
He created 12 meta-humans
just so he could steal their powers.

183
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,490
And he left everybody dead
in the process.

184
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:30,123
Including Ralph Dibny,
who was a team member of ours.

185
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,167
I'm sorry. That's rough.

186
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,670
All these deaths have been rough.
We can't dwell on them right now.

187
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,877
We have to focus, so that
DeVoe doesn't know what we're doing,

188
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,178
and we have a shot at saving Borman.

189
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,346
Which is why we came to you.

190
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:44,054
I see.
I'm just outside the box enough,

191
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,684
to catch DeVoe off-guard.

192
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:50,022
That, and we need your cold gun.

193
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,856
Oh? For what?

194
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:55,020
We've been working on modifying
a radiation hazmat suit

195
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,604
to regulate his internal temperature

196
00:10:56,698 --> 00:11:00,738
to keep his core from raising to the
point of detonation during transport.

197
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,739
Your cold gun would be our backup.

198
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,537
It must be happy hour.
And I'm the two-for-one.

199
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,206
What about your chilly friend?
She doesn't want in on the fun?

200
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,084
- She's gone.
- That's too bad.

201
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,296
All right. You get me for 24 hours,
not a minute more.

202
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,543
Wait, why not?

203
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,382
Because I thought I'd make
Ray an honest man tomorrow.

204
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,804
You're getting married?
That's so exciting.

205
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,508
I figured if you two could make it,
so could we.

206
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,763
- What?
- No, we...

207
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,937
I tease.
So, where are we moving this guy to?

208
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,390
A.R.G.U.S. has a facility
in New Brighton,

209
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,601
high tech, high security.
He should be safe there.

210
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,228
And how long till you're
done with the suit?

211
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,358
Few more tweaks.

212
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,440
Okay, I'm gonna call my dad
and let him know the plan.

213
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,369
- Hey.
- Hey.

214
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,988
- Is that it? Are you done?
- Yeah.

215
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,915
Well, the truth is,
the first one was the hard part.

216
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,788
This one is simply, basically,
following the plan...

217
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,541
Precisely. Let's take this
for a spin, shall we?

218
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,538
All right. Okay.

219
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,250
Here. Have a seat.

220
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,469
Okay. All right then, I guess...

221
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,477
Hey, I trust you.

222
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,854
Yeah, well, I know that.

223
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,560
Okay, here we go.

224
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,394
Connection established.

225
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,731
- It tingles.
- Yeah.

226
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,988
Kinda feels like my conditioner. Ooh!

227
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,411
That's your
synaptic activity enhancing.

228
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,617
Whoa!

229
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,666
Boy, is it ever.
It's like a party in my brain.

230
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,039
I can see why you like this thing
so much.

231
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,046
I can feel my neurons firing. Okay.

232
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,707
Whoo-hoo!

233
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,213
Pikachu! Whoo!

234
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,430
- Harry! Harry!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

235
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,428
Hoo!

236
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:52,728
Yeah, I think what happened was
probably a hyper limiter valve that...

237
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,763
- Promethium ion diodes.
- Ion diodes.

238
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,938
You overloaded the cap?

239
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,268
We overloaded it. Real bummer.
Oh, well, we tried.

240
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,024
How the hell did you get
promethium ion diodes?

241
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,024
I got 'em. I... In my lab.

242
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,944
On my Earth, I had them there,
but I'm all out unfortunately.

243
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,738
We don't have any here. It would
take us weeks to get some.

244
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:15,748
Oh, well, well, you know what,
we'll put in a back order,

245
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,954
and we'll see if I can come up
with something else.

246
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,208
Right.

247
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,715
I see our scare tactics worked.

248
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,886
They are going to move the asset
as you anticipated.

249
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,761
Yes, but unfortunately,
not to the location I predicted.

250
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,027
What is this?

251
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,694
Your favorite dress.

252
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,289
And you chose to wear that now?

253
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,708
To please you, my love.

254
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:01,247
Now, what would please me
is your understanding

255
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,300
of the gravity of our undertaking.

256
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:08,466
To right the misguided course
of all humanity.

257
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,388
I just thought...

258
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:14,727
You see, again you thought,

259
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,857
which led you to this trivial notion.

260
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,437
And now, go and change into something
a bit more appropriate.

261
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:29,404
Your role from now,
until the enlightenment has occurred,

262
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,074
is as my technician.

263
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:40,541
Now leave me be, so that I can figure
out a way to motivate Team Flash

264
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:45,170
to deliver our quarry to where
initially intended.

265
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,344
<i>All right, look,
I think we take Highway 14.</i>

266
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,309
It's as rural as we're gonna get. And
it's a straight shot to New Brighton.

267
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,596
Best chance to get Fallout to safety.

268
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:02,148
Sounds like a plan, Barry.
You know how I feel about plans.

269
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,266
Yeah.

270
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,312
This was your team member, right?
Ralph Dibny.

271
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,406
Yeah. Elongated Man.

272
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,822
Elongated Man.

273
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,904
I don't remember someone with that
name being part of the fight

274
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:19,742
- against the Nazis.
- No, no. He wasn't ready yet.

275
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,502
A rookie hero.

276
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,878
- So, you trained him?
- As much as I could. Yeah.

277
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,969
Even harder death to take,
someone you've mentored.

278
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,305
And yet, somehow, you seem okay.

279
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,429
Considering this happened, what,
just a few days ago.

280
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:40,479
I am okay. I'm just trying
to do what I have to do.

281
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:45,185
- I'm trying to stay on task.
- Oh, is that what you're doing?

282
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,691
You know how may rebels
we lost over the years, Barry,

283
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,490
trying to defeat those Nazi bastards?

284
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,693
- Countless, I'm sure.
- Not countless.

285
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:57,864
Counted. 18,322,

286
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,246
3,679 were under my watch.

287
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,045
And I felt the weight of each
of their deaths, I still do,

288
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,547
so many years after they died.

289
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,881
Leo, look...

290
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,006
The thing I realized is that
to continue to lead,

291
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,806
to be clear-headed, I had to
grieve those men and women I lost.

292
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:19,101
So, I did. Each and every one.

293
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:26,396
Look, Barry, you want me to help
you move a meta-human nuclear bomb

294
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:30,355
that some genius with nearly every
meta power on this board is after,

295
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,655
I will do what I can.

296
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,948
As long as your head is on straight,

297
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:38,154
because if I die before Ray and I
get married, Ray will kill me.

298
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,161
Suit's ready.

299
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,334
And Fallout is ready at Tracy's lab.

300
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,125
So, let's get to Keystone. You good?

301
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,170
- I'm good.
- Then let's go get our guy.

302
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,306
<i>Meta-human nuclear bomb.
Meta-human nuclear bomb.</i>

303
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,182
<i>And Fallout is ready at Tracy's lab.</i>

304
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,759
<i>And Fallout is ready at Tracy's lab.</i>

305
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,264
<i>Let's get to Keystone.</i>

306
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,768
<i>Let's get to Keystone.
Let's get to Keystone.</i>

307
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,098
<i>Then let's go get our guy.</i>

308
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,603
<i>Then let's go get our guy.</i>

309
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,189
Yes, let's.

310
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,772
After all,
a nuke is a terrible thing to waste.

311
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,871
You're telling me I have to wear
this thing the whole time?

312
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:23,290
Yeah. Look,
that suit protects us from you,

313
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,038
so that
we can protect you from the guy

314
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,117
that's trying to hunt you down.

315
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:27,787
But why is he after me?

316
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,748
Honestly, Neil, we don't know. But
we wanna find out as much as you do.

317
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,924
And we will, trust me.

318
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,754
You saved me once, Flash,
I trust you to do it again.

319
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,135
What's that?

320
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:43,310
I whipped up this cocktail of
atomized DTPI and potassium iodide.

321
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:47,018
It should flood our thyroids
with enough non-radioactive iodine,

322
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,020
so that
if our containment suit doesn't work,

323
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:52,236
it should offer some protection
from radiation.

324
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:56,524
Some protection?
How vaguely reassuring.

325
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,535
- How long will this last?
- Two, three hours max.

326
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,116
Then you better get going.

327
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,706
All right, let's just go over
the plan one more time, okay.

328
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,875
I'm gonna be running ahead
of the truck, scouting the route

329
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,122
- for any signs of trouble.
- Right.

330
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:11,046
I will be at S.T.A.R. Labs, tracking
any pocket dimension en route.

331
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,379
And I will be in the truck with Neil,
monitoring his vitals and rads.

332
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:17,795
With me at the ready in case our
meta of mass destruction here

333
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,130
goes all mushroom cloud. No offense.

334
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,849
And I'll be driving
and reciting every prayer

335
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,426
that Cecile's ever taught me.

336
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,182
I might join you.

337
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,476
Look, guys, I know
DeVoe has hit us pretty hard,

338
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,684
but right now, let's just try to
forget what he's taken from us

339
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,693
and stay focused on
taking something from him,

340
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,987
by getting Neil safely to A.R.G.U.S.

341
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,406
We do that, whatever DeVoe
has planned falls apart.

342
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,158
Winning this battle
may just win us the war.

343
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:44,579
Hear, hear. Let's all make sure
we keep our heads in the game.

344
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,332
So, we can stay safe out there.

345
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,631
- I know what that was about.
- It was a good speech, Barry.

346
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,759
Just making sure you heard it,
didn't just give it.

347
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,961
What is that supposed to mean?

348
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:03,390
If you don't confront your feelings,
they will confront you.

349
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,772
All clear on my end.

350
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,017
There's no pocket dimension
activity in the area.

351
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,439
<i>Roads are looking good, too. Joe?</i>

352
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,771
Yeah, the rig is secure.

353
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,238
<i>- Caitlin?</i>
- Rads are good. Heartbeat regular.

354
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,118
On Earth-X, we have a saying,
"If you laugh out loud,

355
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,994
"you gotta share the joke."

356
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:38,050
By-product of living on an Earth
where joy is a scarce commodity.

357
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,927
It's a Post-it note
from Killer Frost.

358
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,761
It's how we talk or talked.

359
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,593
"Broke the thermostat again.
I think it hates me."

360
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,059
Aw! That's cute. Do you miss her?

361
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:54,607
It's not that. It's just that

362
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,482
we were starting
to become close lately.

363
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,697
And I know how crazy that sounds,

364
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,069
considering, we're talking
about someone

365
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,525
who actually lived inside of me.

366
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,079
I'm on an alt-Earth,
transporting a human bomb.

367
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,157
With an escort that can literally
run back to the future.

368
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,285
Your story is the least crazy thing
I've heard all day.

369
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,255
One thing's for sure.
I will miss those little notes.

370
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:22,549
Alter-ego or not,
it's okay to miss someone we've lost.

371
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,554
How's he doing?

372
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,052
Good. His rads are low,
vitals seem stable.

373
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,388
I gave him a sedative,
and it seems to be working.

374
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,684
Okay, good. We're almost there.

375
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,137
Guys, there's
pocket dimension activity.

376
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,735
Dad?

377
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:47,990
We're trapped in here.

378
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:53,205
The doors are unlocked,
but it's just like it weighs a ton.

379
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,751
- Iris?
- Iris?

380
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,253
- Dad?
- The comms are out. It's DeVoe.

381
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,881
He's here?

382
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,933
Mr. Allen,

383
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,523
as usual, you're a step behind me.

384
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:21,608
Yay, puns. You Earth-1 villains
sure are a hoot.

385
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,023
You have no idea, Mr. Snart.

386
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,902
You're not taking Fallout.

387
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,196
I can, and I will.

388
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:32,327
If not here and now, then after your
top secret transfer to A.R.G.U.S.

389
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,449
Yes, I know.

390
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,827
Remember?

391
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:40,130
Good. I won't have to feel guilty
about doing this.

392
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,852
Well, that deescalated quickly.

393
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:58,523
The minuscule soundwaves produced
by that toy trinket of yours

394
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:02,728
are far too weak
for this new body of mine.

395
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,860
What a gift Mr. Dibny provided.

396
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:10,493
Well, it was a gift in
a manner of speaking. Right, rookie?

397
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,537
Barry.

398
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:23,499
Why such turmoil in your mind,
Mr. Allen?

399
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,926
Allow me to ease your pain.

400
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,436
That's it. I'm leaving.

401
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,234
No, I need you to stay here,
and calm down!

402
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,186
Neil, wait!

403
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,739
I want you all to listen to me
very carefully,

404
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:51,034
and hopefully,
I won't have to raise my voice.

405
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,037
This truck is now mine.

406
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,415
We really have no way of finding
Joe and Caitlin,

407
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,041
not even by tracking Fallout.

408
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,920
That hazmat suit is hiding
his radiation signature.

409
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,094
So, the satellite can't even
find him, unless he heats up.

410
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,134
Okay, what do you know
about Laurel Lance's doppelganger?

411
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,507
Why was she hunting you?

412
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,635
That was Siren-X.
All that's left of the Reichsman.

413
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:21,064
An elite assassin gone mad,
and she is relentless.

414
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,938
Carried the torch for Dark Arrow.
Unrequited.

415
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,819
So, she is none too pleased
with those responsible for his death,

416
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,439
present company included.

417
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:31,984
So, she has the same powers
as Black Siren?

418
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,154
The Laurel Lance of Earth-2.

419
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,990
- And Earth-1's Laurel Lance?
- She died.

420
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,909
She was the second Black Canary
after her sister.

421
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,999
Who also died and came back,
but as White Canary 'cause...

422
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,625
- Cisco.
- It's complicated.

423
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:51,011
Right. Doppelganger confusion aside,
Siren-X has my cold gun and a nuke.

424
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,093
And her thirst for vengeance won't
prevent her from using either one

425
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:57,096
on me, or all of you now.

426
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,389
- Hey. Are you sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

427
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,395
I'm just a little worried.
It seemed like

428
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:05,475
she got the jump on you out there.

429
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,310
She didn't.
She just caught me off-guard.

430
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,440
But why does it matter right now?

431
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,066
We don't even know
where Joe and Caitlin are?

432
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,491
Hey, Cisco, will you just see
if Harry has any ideas?

433
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:14,951
- I'm on it.
- Just watch the satellites,

434
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,153
like a hawk.

435
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,577
Leo, what exactly happened out there?

436
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:22,876
Well, just your typical deadly combat

437
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,625
between two metas
from multiple Earths.

438
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,205
Leonard.

439
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,709
- I'll go talk to him.
- Thank you.

440
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,795
Where is it?

441
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,881
Hey, Ramon, what are you doing?

442
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,721
A Nazi Laurel Lance
just kidnapped Caitlin and Joe.

443
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,474
We're gonna make this thing work,
and we're gonna make it work now.

444
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,644
Well, we can't.

445
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:46,566
We can't. I still haven't found
a replacement for that...

446
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,019
- Where did you get that?
- I found this

447
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,695
in one of the cubes Gypsy sent me.

448
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,194
How clever of you. You know what,
Ramon, it's still not gonna work.

449
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,399
- It's not gonna work.
- Why?

450
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,405
Because it's not gonna work, okay?
Because it's a waste of time.

451
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,861
Because I said so, that's why!

452
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,617
- Well, in that case...
- Listen, Ramon.

453
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:02,120
- Our friends' lives are at stake.
- You don't...

454
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,825
Look, I don't know
what's going on with you,

455
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,911
but if you're not gonna help me
with this thing, I...

456
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,670
What...

457
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,791
Why would you do that?

458
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,302
To protect you.

459
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,924
The cap did this?

460
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,137
And dark matter.

461
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,185
You used dark matter.

462
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,022
I used dark matter.
Look, Ramon, it was the only way.

463
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,105
The only way to do what,
fry your synapses?

464
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,573
Harry, you promised me.

465
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,322
I know I promised you.
I promised you.

466
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,574
Oh, my God.

467
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,951
Harry, how could you be so stupid?

468
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,624
'Cause I felt so stupid.

469
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,167
We all feel stupid right now!

470
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,462
Yes! But you're Vibe,
Allen's the Flash, who am I?

471
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,209
My only job is to be smarter

472
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,169
than all the villains
who wanna hurt this team,

473
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,799
and without that, I'm nothing.

474
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,725
I'm about to lose the only part of me
that is any value to this team,

475
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:06,976
the only part of me that matters,
and so, yeah, I destroyed the cap.

476
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,808
So that you wouldn't make the same
mistake I did.

477
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:19,827
- This should not be happening.
- Perhaps, you miscalculated.

478
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,412
I calculated everything.

479
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,207
The Flash's involvement
with the bus-meta.

480
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,127
The little recruitment
of Snart's doppelganger.

481
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:32,126
Even the arrival
of the Earth-X banshee.

482
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:37,215
Every event occurred exactly
as I predicted,

483
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,590
except the outcome!

484
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,301
You were supposed to defeat Siren-X?

485
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,307
No.

486
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:48,809
The Flash was, but
Barry Allen just stood there, frozen.

487
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:52,312
And now,
I've lost my only nuclear meta.

488
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,189
Because the Flash failed!

489
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:58,364
Why? Why did he fail?

490
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,943
Perhaps, there were variables
that we just did not consider.

491
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,747
As I already explained,
there is no variable

492
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,158
beyond my examination.

493
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,785
Even less apparent.

494
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:13,045
The last time Barry Allen saw you,

495
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,089
you took the life
of his close friend.

496
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:19,010
And now, he sees you and he pauses.
You really don't see it.

497
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:22,847
You can calculate near infinite
outcomes across multiple Earths,

498
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:27,553
but you cannot account
for how someone is feeling.

499
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,697
What did you see out there, Barry?

500
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,950
- When you froze up?
- Nothing.

501
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,039
You just got
two of your teammates captured,

502
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,288
and almost got me killed,

503
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:56,123
so, either you explain what happened,
or I leave.

504
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,378
- I saw Ralph.
- I warned you.

505
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,050
He's messing with your head.

506
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,971
No, it's not like that.
Do I miss him? Yes.

507
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,759
Do I regret what happened? Of course.
But I don't need lessons in loss.

508
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,972
What I need to do right now,
is lead my team.

509
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,725
You're gonna lead them to their
deaths if you don't deal with this.

510
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:14,353
- Back off, Leo.
- You need to grieve him, Barry.

511
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,059
Grief is a luxury
I don't have time for.

512
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:19,317
- Make time!
- I can't!

513
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:23,696
Not Ralph. Not right now.

514
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,318
Ah.

515
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,367
So, we've finally reached the core.

516
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,705
You don't want to grieve this one.

517
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,963
So, Ralph's death must be different

518
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:40,008
from all the other losses
you've experienced, but why?

519
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,259
Why?

520
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:47,057
Barry, trust me,
there is no outrunning grief.

521
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,972
That was a pun, I'm sorry.

522
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,031
Run! Run!

523
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,706
CCPD.

524
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:15,243
Home of the brave, land of the dead.

525
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,341
Killing all these people
won't bring back your regime.

526
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,966
No, it won't. But decimating
your so-called officers,

527
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:27,422
will make it
a hell of a lot more even.

528
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:29,549
I'll make sure of it.

529
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,176
- Remove your helmet.
- What?

530
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,145
Take it off!

531
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,860
CCPD. Why would she take him there?

532
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,365
We destroyed her Earth's protectors,

533
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,696
maybe she wants
to do the same thing to us.

534
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,706
- Harry, we need eyes.
- You know what?

535
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,700
Why don't you let me
take care of it, all right?

536
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,251
You keep an eye on the rads.

537
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,873
Leo, we're on.

538
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:01,001
Barry, I'm always on.

539
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,665
- But wait, I need a...
- Got you.

540
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:05,460
- Thank you, Iris.
- Mmm-hmm.

541
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,092
How much time do we have left
on the injection?

542
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,175
Not enough.

543
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:15,199
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

544
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:35,324
- Barry!
- This is for destroying my world!

545
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,751
- 7,000 rads.
- And climbing.

546
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,130
Guys, you gotta cool him down.

547
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,933
8,000 rads and climbing.

548
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,774
Flash! Get up! Get up!

549
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,231
Flash.

550
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,066
People are going to die, Flash!

551
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,367
- I'm not ready to die.
- Rise up.

552
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,654
<i>- Let me train you.</i>
- Train me?

553
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:17,452
Fight it, all right. Fight it!
I'll save you!

554
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:18,662
Flash.

555
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:22,086
Flash, you have to deal
with the pain.

556
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:24,289
No!

557
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,626
You can't get away from
what's inside you, so, stop trying!

558
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,795
Flash!

559
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,383
9,000 rads.
The whole place is gonna blow.

560
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,553
Flash! It wasn't your fault!

561
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:39,683
<i>Ralph!</i>

562
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:40,854
I'll save you.

563
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,107
You already did, Barry.

564
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,121
<i>He's burning up.</i>

565
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,043
Time to get cold-blooded.

566
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,469
8,000 rads.

567
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,559
7,000 rads.

568
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,436
<i>Keep icing him, it's working.</i>

569
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,440
And dropping.

570
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:36,573
<i>- He's contained.
- They did it.</i>

571
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,203
Where's the Flash?

572
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,505
Barr. What's going on, Barr?

573
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:01,519
He trusted me, Joe.
And I let him down.

574
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:05,474
Ralph, I'm the reason he's dead.

575
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,608
- No.
- No.

576
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,728
- No.
- I failed him.

577
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:14,399
He was my responsibility.
Now, he's gone.

578
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,321
It's all right.

579
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,787
So, we're sure
that Fallout is secure?

580
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,711
Well, Lyla said she had some people
who would be very interested

581
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,541
in helping Borman control his power.

582
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:33,922
She took him
to a different A.R.G.U.S.

583
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,174
- black-op site way off the grid.
- How far off the grid?

584
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:40,091
Like, it would take Jack Ryan
two Tom Clancy novels to find him.

585
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:45,518
I gotta say, on any Earth,
Snarts have style. Perfect fit.

586
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,098
I thought
you could do something with it.

587
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,979
- You wear it well.
- Thank you.

588
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,901
You sure
you can't come to the wedding?

589
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,944
I could put all of you
at a table with Ray's uncle, Skip,

590
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,855
he murders the Macarena.

591
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,071
- Yeah, DeVoe is still out there.
- Suit yourselves.

592
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,570
But if you are looking
for a place to honeymoon,

593
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,239
our Earth
has some pretty spectacular spots.

594
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:04,323
What is this?

595
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,830
That is an interdimensional
extrapolator.

596
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,286
It makes small-scale breaches.

597
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:12,165
In case, Ray's uncle, Skip, wants
to see how the other half lives.

598
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:15,635
Look at that. "Something old,
something new, something borrowed."

599
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,212
Something navy.

600
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,346
We're gonna miss you, Leo.

601
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,515
I'm gonna miss you too, Caitlin.

602
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,760
You're quite the badass, you know.

603
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:27,143
- Enough to make your alter ego proud.
- Thank you.

604
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:30,145
Detective West,
I know my Earth-1 counterpart

605
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,351
gave you a lot of headaches.

606
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,561
Hopefully, I've begun
to make up for that.

607
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:38,024
Man, you prevented a nuke
from leveling the city.

608
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,867
We're good.

609
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:43,617
Cisco, I think
I'm gonna miss that hair.

610
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,287
Okay.

611
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,663
Iris West-Allen,

612
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:52,623
thank you for helping me take down
Nazi scum again.

613
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,633
You're welcome again.

614
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,678
And then there was one.

615
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:03,591
I could see why the other Snart
turned over a new leaf

616
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,642
and joined the good guys.

617
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:09,146
You treat everyone around you
with kindness and respect.

618
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:15,229
Just remember to do the same
for yourself, every once in a while.

619
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:20,028
- Thanks for helping me push through.
- Anytime, Barry.

620
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:22,527
Don't be a stranger.

621
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,789
Oh, you never know.

622
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,674
How you doing?
I know last night was pretty rough.

623
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,756
I'll tell you about it
when we see Dr. Finkel.

624
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,466
We're seeing, Dr. Finkel?

625
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,765
Yeah, I gave her a call.

626
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,522
How's it going?

627
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,569
I don't know.

628
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,073
Hauling a nuclear meta
across the state,

629
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,453
getting kidnapped
by a screeching psychopath,

630
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,532
and helping save this city,
I'd say that's pretty impressive

631
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,709
for someone without a meta other half
to lean on.

632
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:16,168
Thanks. You know,
the thing I realized yesterday is,

633
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,795
even though
I can live without Killer Frost,

634
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:20,338
I don't think I want to.

635
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,294
Run some more tests,
find out for sure.

636
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,630
I already did.

637
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,174
- And?
- I'm too afraid to find out.

638
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,183
Let's find out together.

639
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,138
What does it say?

640
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:37,735
It says the reason dark matter
isn't registering in my body,

641
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,733
is because there is none.

642
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:42,065
So, she's gone?

643
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:46,076
It says there's still another
cryogenic anomaly in my DNA.

644
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,241
Killer Frost is still a part of you.

645
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:51,408
I just have to figure out
how to get her to appear.

646
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,041
You going somewhere?

647
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:05,839
Yeah. As a matter of fact, I'm gonna
visit my daughter while I'm still...

648
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,849
Of sound mind. It's not like I can
help you guys around here, anyway.

649
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,427
'Cause that is the only part
of you that matters,

650
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,854
- that mind of yours.
- Exactly.

651
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,895
Is that why
Jesse turned out so great?

652
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,773
Yeah. No. I don't know.
What's your point?

653
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,315
- Jesse Quick, superhero, scientist.
- Yeah, I know who she is.

654
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:28,119
All-around wonderful person.
She turned out that way because...

655
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,164
- I don't know.
- I think you do.

656
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:36,040
You told me you were about to lose
the only part of you that has value.

657
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,669
Yeah. Yeah.

658
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,043
Raising Jesse?

659
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:43,251
Raising a kid
that turns out like that.

660
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:46,630
That takes a lot more
than intelligence.

661
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:49,136
If you asked her, I'm pretty
sure she'd tell you, learning

662
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,806
quadratic equations at age five
from her math-obsessed father

663
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:55,263
wasn't nearly as important to her
as having a dad,

664
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,186
who was there for her,
and who gave a damn.

665
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:01,986
- So, my point is...
- Well taken.

666
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:06,365
So, now what?

667
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,152
Slow down, wait till I regress
to a simpleton?

668
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,119
Now, we figure out a way to fix you.

669
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,788
Just like you did
when Barry lost his speed,

670
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:16,618
we find a way to
jump-start your brain.

671
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,916
But this is the hard part 'cause
it's gonna take all of us to do it.

672
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,665
Which means
you have to tell the team.

673
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:27,219
I gotta tell the team.

674
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,135
Yeah. I know you're right,

675
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,513
but maybe not today.

676
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,516
When you're ready.

677
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,440
- Ramon.
- Yeah?

678
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,951
Thank you.

679
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:03,881
I knew Ralph since
I was a rookie on the force.

680
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:07,877
And all that time,
I thought I knew exactly

681
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,758
what kind of person he was.

682
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:11,259
Why is that?

683
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:14,516
We just never saw things
the same way.

684
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:19,973
You know, I was raised
to believe that people are good.

685
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,352
And Ralph?

686
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:25,027
He always saw the worst in people.

687
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:27,696
And he knew
how to take advantage of it.

688
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:31,029
But, um, he changed.

689
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,448
Yeah, he did. He changed,

690
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:42,583
and I couldn't see that
for a long time.

691
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:47,337
And now, that I can, I...
I think that's what's so hard, is...

692
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:50,044
You know, of course I miss Ralph,

693
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:54,428
but it just took me so long to see
what he had become.

694
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:57,969
I just,
I never had a chance to tell him

695
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:02,432
just how proud I am
to be his friend.

696
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:06,610
And I always will be.

697
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:10,315
- I'm sure he knew that, Barry.
- Yeah.

698
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:14,118
What else would you tell him
if you could right now?

699
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,874
That I feel responsible.

700
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,372
I feel responsible for what happened.

701
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:31,502
And he taught me more than
I could have ever taught him.

702
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,634
And for that,
I'll always be grateful.

703
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,084
Allowing events to unfold naturally
turned out in our favor.

704
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:10,340
Just as you said it would.

705
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,595
And success came our way
without the hindrance of that most

706
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:18,641
aberrant of human follies,

707
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,969
- emotion.
- It did, indeed.

708
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:26,432
To think for a moment there
I experienced doubt.

709
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:30,690
So, perhaps now, you can accept
that the primitive, cognitive

710
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,989
entanglements that
derailed Mr. Allen today,

711
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:39,283
can only serve to hold us back
from completing our work.

712
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,996
Yes.

713
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,449
I see that, now.

714
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:51,749
More clear than ever before.

715
00:41:51,773 --> 00:41:59,773
