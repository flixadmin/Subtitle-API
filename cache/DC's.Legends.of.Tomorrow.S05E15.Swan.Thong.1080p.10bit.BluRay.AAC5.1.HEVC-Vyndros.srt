00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:06,256
Only a weapon from hell
can eliminate a hell-spawned Encore.

3
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:07,424
We could use those.

4
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,050
[Sara] Yeah, let's just get them
and get out of here.

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:12,721
<i>[Charlie] The Loom of Fate is one
of the most powerful tools in existence.</i>

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,849
<i>It gave my sisters and me control
over everyone's lives.</i>

7
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,976
None of this is how it should be!

8
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:21,188
Screw the Fates. Stop being so obedient.

9
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,106
<i>[Mona] They're free!</i>

10
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,816
Then I can't help them anymore.

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,158
- Oy! Stop it!
-[man] We will rule!

12
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,202
But even I like the Blue Mush.

13
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,080
[sighs] Bollocks.

16
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,884
What kept you, sister?

17
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,763
Oh, you know, running a TV empire is
not as easy as snipping threads, sister.

18
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:59,768
I was skeptical when you pitched
the idea of the Legends on TV,

19
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,853
but they've helped pacify the masses.

20
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,897
Well, should we get started then?

21
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,524
We don't want to
keep our worshippers waiting.

22
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,919
[sighs] Any luck finding the Loom?

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,755
Yeah, I think we found it, all right.

24
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,007
Yeah, well, our ride is
still very much MIA,

25

Acid reflux. Too much Green Mush.

29
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,643
Ava better find that ship
because if we succeed,

30
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,020
then we're gonna have
three very angry Fates on our hands.

31
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,272
- Hey.
- God!

32
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,024
- You're all from the TV, right?
- Yes.

33
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,277
Can we get your autographs?

34
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:55,031
That depends.
How attached are you to your clothes?

35
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,997
Oh, my Fates! It's the Legends!

36
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,832
Gary, Mona, you're okay.

37
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,959
It worked. You're out of the TV.

38
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,794
Okay, I've been dying to ask,
was I a Legend?

39
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,839
Or a lovable rogue,
or a Manic Pixie Dream Boy?

40
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,758
Time Dweeb! Where is the Waverider?

41
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,136
Is that like the <i>U. S. S. Faterider<ii>
on <i>Star Trip</i>?

42
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,554
Yeah, sure. Have you seen it?

43
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,931
No, but I bet
it's in the Forbidden Dump.

44
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,433
Well, that sounds ominous.

45
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,101
It's where we send
all the contraband items.

46
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,854
I know, because I work for
the Historical Sanitation Department.

47
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,566
Okay, great. So, how would we
infiltrate this Forbidden Dump?

48
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,367
The Waverider better be here.

49
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,536
If we stay, we'll raise suspicion.

50
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,163
Good luck, teammates.

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,956
I don't get it.

Fuzzy dice, waffle maker,
massage chairs.

53
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,878
This is all like the good stuff.

54
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,672
Yeah, if you make life bleak enough,
people become so focused on survival

55
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,007
they forget they can revolt.

56
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,175
Start clicking, Mickey.

57
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,220
[clicking]

58

Yeah, for good reason. Now!

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,963
Nice one, love.

- You'll see.

64
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,223
All right. Keep your eyes out
for any more guards

65
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,849

What is your request?

70
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,950
More Blue Mush, please.

71
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,954
We shall weave it
into the fabric of time this afternoon.

72
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,081
Thank you.

73

Thank you.

74

[Lachesis] Speak, child.

75
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,170
Can you put my shows back on TV?

76
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,884
They'll be back in a tick. The actors
just need a bit of rest, that's all.

77
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,470
Why? Are they tired from the crossover?

78
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,222
What is a crossover?

79
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,438
The Legends are here.

80
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:43,450
Clotho, I have let you play
your childish game long enough.

81
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,910
It is time to grow up
and face the music.

82
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,328
The Legends are my friends.

83
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,080
Are they?

84
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,750
Time and again,
they have sown chaos into this world.

85
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,878
Sometimes they screw things up
for the better.

86
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,463
I mean, think about it, Encores.

87
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,380
That wasn't their fault.

88
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,923
And they've been
mopping that up all year.

89
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,886
That's true.
The Encores are not the Legends' fault.

90
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,387
They're yours.

91
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,892
Ambitious villains are
the product of the chaos you birthed.

92
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,395
Look at these people now.

93
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,649
Do you see a future Joseph Stalin
amongst these lambs?

94
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,696
Of the three of us, you always loved
these mortal creatures best.

95
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,239
What do you think they would want?

96
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,952
More choices or a lifetime of peace?

97
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,833
Peace.

98
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,463
Wise choice, sister.

It's beautiful.

00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,953
Now destroy it, once and for all.

103

Yeah, we still haven't found it.

106

Mick, how do you know
the batteries in that thing even work?

107
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,843
For all we know, the Waverider
could be anywhere in this mess.

[car door chirping]

Shut the front door.

- No.
- Do you hear that?

111
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,040
I helped you find the ship.
Now I'm gonna find my kid.

112
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,376
Okay, Mick will be fine on his own.

113
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,504
A spell to destroy something
as powerful as this,

114
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,674
it requires
a considerable well of magic.

You're Natalie Logue's daughter,
aren't you?

120

Your mother,
she was a natural conduit for magic.

121
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,610
Her blood flows through your veins,
meaning that you're a conduit as well.

122

Close your eyes and go with me.
All right?

123

Guys, we have a problem.
There is no Gideon.

126

- Which means no flying.
- Damn it, Fates. Well played.

127

What would it take
to get the ship off the ground manually?

128
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,255
I mean, we need a superconductor

to transfer a huge surge of energy
to the timecore.

130
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,635
We could look in the junkyard.

00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:09,150
<i>For once she was a true love of mine</i>

161
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,818
I love you, Mommy.

162
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,204
My sweet girl, your mother is gone.

163
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,128
No,no,no!

164
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:34,801
Forget her, or you will never be
the powerful woman I know you can be.

165
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,093
No!

166
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:46,395
Your power comes from me.
I alone am its master.

167
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,192
My power comes from my team.
John, open the door.

168
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,320
Behrad, now!

169
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,626
If my power comes from you,
then maybe I can do this.

170
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,677
[screaming]

171
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,975
[gasps]

172
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,274
Ava, where you at?

173
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:32,942
<i>[Agent Sharpe] Pulling up now.</i>

174
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,279
Clotho, what have you done?

175
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,156
[Sara] Go, go. Let's move.

176
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,494
I don't think we can hold this altitude.

177
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:44,579
[Sara] Jump the ship.

178
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:46,914
Do it.

179
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,340
[screaming]

180
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,559
[all groaning in pain]

181
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,103
Wait, when are we?

182
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:13,482
I don't know.
It's hard to see through all this trash.

183
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:14,692
[Nate] It's not trash.

184
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,694
They're some of
history's most iconic mementos.

185
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:21,115
I don't care what it is.
All I care is that I can see this face.

186
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,327
Oh, I think my powers are gone.

187
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,954
Yeah, well, your powers
were bestowed by a God.

188
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,707
Once that God kicked the bucket,
then bye-bye powers.

189
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,250
Everything's back to normal?

190
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,585
Only one way to find out.

191
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,420
Gideon is down.
Gotta do it the old-fashioned way.

192
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,838
- All right.
-[Agent Sharpe] Sounds good.

193
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,465
- All right, let's go check it out.
-[Agent Sharpe] All right.

194
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,763
[Agent Sharpe]
Okay, this feels like an improvement.

195
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,267
All right, this says
we jumped a few months.

196
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,393
Okay.

197
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,271
Well, gives the world some time
to get back on track.

198
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,941
Hey, Fate, what's the best way
to work today?

199
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,067
[watch chirps] The subway.

200
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,361
Hey, Fate. What should I have
for lunch today?

201
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,154
<i>Two soups and a smoothie.</i>

202
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,865
Hey, Fate,
should I ask Renee to marry me?

203
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,283
Hey, Fate, what do I buy my brother
for his birthday?

204
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,160
Uh... What are the chances
that everyone's watches

205
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,329
got a weird update
over the last four months?

206
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,414
I'd say one in a monkey's ass, love.

207
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,670
[sighs] Great. So, not only do Charlie
and her sister have the Loom back,

208
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,422
but now it's wearable.

209
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,346
Don't let choices get
in the way of your destiny.

210
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,390
Trust in Fate.

211
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,434
With Fatewatch, your link to the Loom.

212
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,645
<i>Always connected.</i>

213
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,736
[Agent Sharpe]
I get the Fates rebuilt the Loom.

214
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,113
But how'd they put it in a watch?

215
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,990
[Constantine] Well, that's why we're
breaking into the bloody temple.

216
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,324
Get some answers.

217
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,994
- What the hell? It's a--
- History museum.

218
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,287
Can't be all that bad.

219
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,624
Well, certainly an improvement
on the Loom Temple.

220
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,131
"Welcome to The History Museum.

221
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,467
Here you will learn the truth
about free will and the atrocities

222
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,469
it has brought upon humankind."

223
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,637
Atrocities?

224
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,933
"Join us as we examine the tragedies
of choice and the horrors of our past,

225
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,437
that we shall, with benevolence
and Fate, never suffer again."

226
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:18,232
So they went from trashing history
to weaponizing it.

227
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,692
But why?

228
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,360
Well, if we want to know
what happened in the past,

229
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:22,945
we certainly came to the right place.

230
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,741
All right. First up,
the Hall of Bad Ideas.

231
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,121
[Nate] Ray has that suit.

232
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,127
- What the hell is a shake weight?
- You don't want to know, babe.

233
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,009
[Constantine] Cigarettes? Oh, come on.

234
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,136
Bloody cheek of them.

235
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,930
John, you died of lung cancer. Come on.
You know they're right.

236
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:50,890
Yeah.

237
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,022
Whoa.

238
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:05,237
- Okay. What's "The Thong Song"?
- Seriously?

239
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,782
"She had dumps
like a truck, truck, truck.

240
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,784
Baby, move your butt, butt, butt."

241
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,452
<i>[singing] I think I'll sing it again</i>

242
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:14,914
Man, screw the Fates.
That is a spring break classic.

243
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,957
As a matter of fact, I'll play it
for you. I don't give a damn.

244
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:21,253
No, you won't. Come on,
we have to go to the Hall of Villains.

245
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,005
Later, Sisqo.

246
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:28,427
Okay. Other Z. I just rerouted
the nav system. Anything popping up yet?

247
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:33,140
No, nothing yet. Hey, try patching into
the secondary hard drive.

248
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:36,310
Maybe we can pull something up
from the backup... [echoes]

249
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,026
Zari, come on, run.

250
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,781
Behrad!

251
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,117
Hey, you okay?

252
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,786
I don't know...

253
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,789
There were these guys,
A.R.G.U.S, agents.

254
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,999
They had guns. Huge guns.

255
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,377
I thought they were gonna shoot you.

256
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,840
[exhales]
I must have smoked something way off.

257
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,885
Oh, uh... I thought you were Zari.

258
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,471
I.., I am.

259
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:16,559
No, I mean, totally, I know.
It's just...

260
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,187
- It's weird.
- Yeah. I know. Tell me about it.

261
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:25,526
I'm hanging out with myself. A myself
that has the hots for John Constantine.

262
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,695
- You caught that, too?
- Yeah.

263
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:32,074
It wasn't something you smoked.
It happened.

264
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:35,619
You told me to run, and I did.
You didn't.

265
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,997
And then I died.

266
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,042
Every day since then,

267
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,878
everything I've done
has been to save you.

268
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:57,057
Whoa. This is like, really uncanny.

269
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,019
Wait a second.
Are these villains ranked?

270
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,688
I don't know.
Who do you have over there?

271
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:06,567
I got Vlad the Impaler,
but he's number 14.

272
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,819
Hey, if he's number 14,
who's number one?

273
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,200
Hey, Mick. You're okay.

274
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,536
What did you expect?
You left me, us behind!

275
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,747
Okay, calm down, please.

276
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,750
We were waiting for four months.
What took you so long?

277
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,252
Yeah, that's a question for
the other Zari.

278
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,050
Oh! Book club lady.
What are you guys doing here?

279
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:34,303
Well, when you guys broke the Loom,
people panicked.

280
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,764
Suddenly, all these memories
came flooding back.

281
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,973
No one knew what was real.

282
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,475
[Lita] Or what to do.

283
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,227
They were so used to
the Fates telling them.

284
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,896
So, Gary and Mona found me and Dad,
and we went into hiding.

285
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,190
- Hiding? Why?
- Because we're Legends.

286
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,191
Yeah.

287
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,486
And if you were listening to
what the Fates had to say, we were...

288
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,072
[Sara] "God Killers"?

289
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,282
I've been called worse.

290
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,243
Is it weird that I'm offended
that we're only number two?

291
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,495
Well, then who's number one?

292
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,167
[Agent Sharpe] Charlie.

293
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,418
[gasps]

294
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,880
No...

295
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,548
How did you...

296
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,301
You can't be here.
You have to leave right now.

297
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,428
What are you talking about, Charlie?
It's over. You have to come with us.

298
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,638
[watch chimes]

299
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,599
No, Fate says to stay. Fate says...

300
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,727
She's gonna kill you if she finds you.
You have to get out while you can.

301
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,105
Charlie, I'm sorry,
but you'll thank us later. John?

302
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,815
[speaking foreign language]

303
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,567
Charlie...

304
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,238
Hey, it's okay. You're home, Charlie.

305
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,116
No.

306
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,576
No, no, no, no, no, I have to go back.
She's gonna know.

307
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:44,957
Where's my watch? I need it.
That's how the Loom tells me what to do.

308
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,835
Why the hell do you listen
to that thing, Charlie?

309
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,337
Because I never should have destroyed
the Loom to begin with.

310
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,967
I mean, greed and war. Human suffering?

311
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,095
All those Encores we were up against,
that's all on me.

312
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,055
I'm the Loom breaker.

313
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,309
- I'm the creator of chaos.
- Charlie.

314
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,771
That used to be
a badge of honor for you.

315
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:11,859
- What happened?
- We left. That's what happened.

316
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,902
Charlie, you were left all alone.

317
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,946
It's no wonder
Lachesis got into your head.

318
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,823
Lachesis, she's my family.

319
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,616
And family sticks together.

320
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,912
Hey, we are your family,
and we're here now, all right?

321
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,748
Charlie, what happened?

322
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,835
Lachesis rebuilt the Loom.
She saved everyone.

323
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,046
She restored the peace.

324
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,308
I replaced my own mother, John.

325
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,564
Summoning a ghost can be difficult,
even under the best of circumstances.

326
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,691
No, I mean in hell.

327
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:58,030
I was terrified, helpless.

328
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,866
Lachesis found me. She took me in.

329
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,245
But the price for her protection
was my humanity.

330
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:11,126
She trained me to let go of
anything that made me feel.

331
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,172
And so I had to forget the person
I had loved the most.

332
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:19,426
You were just a kid.
Trying to survive is all.

333
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,387
But I wanted to forget.

334
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,223
I saw what happened
to good people down there,

335
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,392
and I swore that would never be me.

336
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,812
Listen to me, all right?

337
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,231
You are still her daughter.

338
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,320
Whose? Natalie?

339
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:40,697
Or Lachesis?

340
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,833
Okay. I know you think free will
is a bad, scary thing.

341
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,919
So, we did a little dumpster diving
to give you some counterpoints.

342
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,213
Two words. The Beatles.

343
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,090
All right,
they taught an entire generation

344
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,467
that even during war and tragedy,

345
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,553
we can still make beauty.

346
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,596
Whilst also inspiring Charles Manson

347
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,974
to commit some of
the most brutal murders in history.

348
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,893
Also, they let Ringo sing a song
about an octopus.

349
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,187
- Damn it. Okay.
-[Sara] Okay.

350
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,772
Just get out of the way.

351
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:17,067
Mamma <i>Mia</i> 2, a celebration of free love,
reckless abandon

352
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,402
and following your bliss.

353
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,321
Even if that bliss means creating
a two-hour ABBA-palooza

354
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,532
where Cher plays Meryl Streep's mom.

355
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,826
Weren't the Legends almost murdered
by Napoleon because of ABBA?

356
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,666
Two words. "Octopus's Garden."

357
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,751
Gary, no.

358
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,426
Would this have happened in a world
without free will?

359
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,471
Seriously, Charlie, look, I'm a clone,
for God's sake.

360
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,597
She's a clone.

361
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,725
You don't have to... Anyway,
think about all the people on this ship.

362
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,477
Think about
how they came to be together.

363
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,896
Yeah, Nate's crazy conspiracy theory.

364
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,648
Mick's turn
as a futuristic bounty hunter.

365
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,903
Zari and B's dystopian future.
You in that disco outfit.

366
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,655
Hey, come on, Charlie.
We were all in our own worlds,

367
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,574
but a twist in our stories
brought us together

368
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,658
and made us a family.

369
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,911
But humanity,
they've made so many mistakes.

370
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,247
Sometimes a mistake is
really just destiny.

371
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,291
What, you learn that being a Paragon?

372
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,543
No, I learned that being a person.

373
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:22,674
So, what do you think? Can we track
the Loom signal with that thing?

374
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,512
Yeah, I just need an external computer,
something with GPS and Wi-Fi.

375
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,727
- Well, that's perfect.
- Hey!

376
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,314
[gasps]

377
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,399
We all make sacrifices
for the greater good.

378
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,694
Really? How much THC is running
through your system right now?

379
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,155
I'm self-medicating for my Loom anxiety.

380
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:48,075
You know, the brain processes
phone screens and drugs the same way.

381
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,577
- Ha.
- That's why they're both so addicting.

382
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:51,787
Oh.

383
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,130
All right, the Loom's signal's coming
from somewhere inside the building.

384
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,341
Okay. Okay.

385
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:08,262
Okay.

386
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:17,479
John, other me,
we're gonna have to go floor by floor.

387
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,648
Well, it's a dodgy spot
for the Loom of Fate.

388
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,985
You know, I've hosted many an exclusive
party in a place like this.

389
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,404
The antithetical keeps the riffraff out.

390
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:28,073
Hiding in plain sight. Bloody brilliant.

391
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:32,494
Also, you can do whatever you want
and no one needs to know.

392
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,705
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

393
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,128
[moaning over speaker]

394
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,507
Oh, God, this is weird.
[clears throat]

395
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,845
All right, uh...
No windows, thick walls...

396
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,432
That's where I'd stash
my artisanal, world-altering apparatus.

397
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,476
<i>[Zari] Guys, I think we found it.</i>

398
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,313
I'm the worst.

399
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,356
Timing is impeccable.

400
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,946
Sara, we got to the Loom,
but there is no Loom.

401
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,742
-[Constantine] Blimey.
- Gideon.

402
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,785
[gasps] Gidget.

403
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,331
<i>Currently running Fate protocol.
I cannot be interrupted.</i>

404
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,417
She's controlling everyone with Gideon.

405
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,253
The watches, they're just running
a program telling everyone what to do.

406
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,674
Wait. So there is no Loom?
We actually destroyed it.

407
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,384
Yeah, all we have to do is
shut down the network.

408
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,137
What, and inspire panic
when Fate abandons everyone all at once?

409
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,473
You know, my sister was right
about you lot.

410
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,475
You shoot first and play doctor later.

411
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,976
[Astra] It won't matter anyway.

412
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,062
Lachesis will find another way
to keep her hooks in

413
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,396
because that is what she does best.

414
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:45,150
Okay, fine. So we just expose her
for what she really is. She's a fraud.

415
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,320
We take her down a notch, show everybody
that she can't control them anymore.

416
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,740
Yeah. Charlie, she's your sister.

417
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,867
You're the only person
that can stand up to her.

418
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,121
I'm sorry.

419
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,457
I can't help you.

420
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,719
[woman over loudspeaker]
The museum is now open.

421
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:19,226
For centuries after
my sister broke the Loom of Fate,

422
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,229
the world was filled with pain.

423
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,942
[all booing]

424
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,485
Horror.

00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,696
[all booing]

426
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,532
Outrageous hubris and brutality.

427
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,368
Chaos.

428
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,663
But I could not let
people suffer any longer.

429
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:44,710
Alone, I rebuilt the Loom
and imprisoned my sister,

430
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:49,214
so that now and forever,
you may live in peace.

431
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,427
Here she is.

432
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,722
Loom breaker.

433
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:01,351
Creator of calamity.
Do you accept your fate?

434
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,312
- No.
-[crowd gasps]

435
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,605
What did you say?

436
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:09,985
I said no.

437
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,530
Your story is a load of crap.

438
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:15,657
Astra.

439
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,370
Where is Clotho?

440
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,831
That was always the question, wasn't it?

441
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:27,753
Did you ever love me, or were you
just looking to replace your sister?

442
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,922
- You wanted a mother.
- I had a mother.

443
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,716
A woman who understood that

444
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,718
to love someone
you have to set them free.

445
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,554
Shut your mouth, dear,
before you say something you regret.

446
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,097
Make me.

447
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:44,186
Come on, all powerful Fate, smite me!
Strike me down!

448
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,441
Yeah, that's what I thought.

449
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:53,361
Why should these good people
listen to you?

450
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:57,199
- Because she's telling the truth.
- Take forever.

451
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:58,950
<i>[Sara] How's it looking, Zaris?</i>

452
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:03,038
I need to get into her mainframe to shut
her down. This might take a minute.

453
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,624
You tricked everyone
into giving up their freedom

454
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,375
by making them afraid of the past.

455
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,169
[Lachesis] That's rich,

456
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:13,632
coming from some of history's
most notorious criminals and killers.

457
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:16,843
- Shame.
- Shame.

- Shame.
- Shame.

459
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,931
All right. Yes, you're right.

460
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,599
We've made mistakes,

461
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:25,393
but sometimes things get messed up
for the better.

462
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,062
Take Marie Antoinette, for instance.

463
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,940
Her indifference
caused a revolution in France.

464
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,107
It gave them democracy.

465
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,110
Look, if you listen to her,
your stories are over.

466
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,155
They're right. Don't listen to me.

467
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,115
Listen to the Loom.

468
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,036
Come on, Zari.

469
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,747
Okay, I made it past the first firewall.

00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,748
<i>The thing about circles
Is they never end</i>

629
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,375
<i>So our friendship will be universal</i>

630
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,756
<i>It's Mr. Parker's cul-de-sac...</i>

631
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:06,636
- Weren't they dead?
- I mean, who hasn't died?

632
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,013
Whoa.

633
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:16,687
- Hey. Finally some time travel.
- Mmm-hmm.

634
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,648
I can't believe Charlie is
the lead singer of The Smell,

635
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,565
that's insane.

636
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:20,942
They're my favorite.

637
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,778
Them and The Runaways.
We can go see them next.

638
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,280
It's a school night.
How about the weekend?

639
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,991
Yeah.

640
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,245
Excuse me, boss.

641
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:39,001
So, what's next for you, love?

642
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:42,171
I guess I'll give life above ground
a fair shot.

643
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:44,465
New York? Paris? Tokyo?

644
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:48,135
I was thinking about this haunted house
out in the sticks.

645
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,887
Were you, now?

646
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:52,431
I got my rent covered.

647
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:55,351
A-ha.

648
00:39:55,434 --> 00:40:00,731
Finally. All right, then. Cheers.

649
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:04,235
<i>So, what, you're looking for
A friend that's new?</i>

650
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,862
<i>I've always wanted a friend like you</i>

651
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,699
<i>Welcome to my cul-de-sac, friends</i>

652
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,243
<i>It's a street that goes on forever</i>

653

<i>A friendship is something without end</i>

654
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:18,833
<i>So let's run this thing together</i>

655
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:25,214
<i>Mr. Parker's cul-de-sac
Mr. Parker's cul-de-sac</i>

658
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,223
That's my girl!

659
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,814
Guys, guys, guys, guys,
I could taste the moon.

660
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,025
And that's enough for the evening.

661
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:49,322
All right, all right.
We came, we partied, we conquered.

662
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,657
And now, it's time to go.
It's time to go home.

663
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:53,242
- Home!
-[howling]

664
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,369
Actually, guys...

665
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,371
I think this is
the end of the line for me.

666
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,999
Wait, what? For reals?

667
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,668
Yeah, it's time for me
to just stay put for once.

668
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,128
And set down some roots.

669
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,504
All right. Well...

670
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:10,259
if you ever need anything, and I mean
anything, you know where to find us.

671
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,137
Thanks, Captain.

672
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:16,932
Once a Legend...

673
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,517
Always a Legend.

674
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,769
Thank you.

675
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,479
Well, come on, all of you.

676
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:23,731
Get in here.

677
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,275
I love you.

678
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,486
I'm really gonna miss you guys.

679
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,738
- Miss you.
- All right, go on. Get out there.

680
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:34,283
Go and enjoy your vacations.
You've earned it.

681
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,079
- Vacation!
- Vacation!

682
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,082
Vacation!

683
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,424
I think I'm gonna text Dion,
or is that too desperado...

684
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,468
This is why I don't have a phone.
