BARRY: <i>I've been running a lot lately,</i>

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,754
<i>trying to go faster than
I've ever gone before,</i>

3
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:06,714
<i>because there's someone out there
who's better,</i>

4
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,093
<i>faster and stronger than I am.</i>

5
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,179
<i>And I need to be ready.</i>

6
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:16,141
<i>But no matter how much I try,
or how hard I push myself,</i>

7
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,643
<i>I keep running into the same problem.</i>

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,647
{\an8}He just hit 1,375.

9
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,692
{\an8}What's the fastest Barry's run?

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,528
{\an8}Little over Mach 2,
when he ran back in time.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,489
{\an8}That's not good.

12
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,990
{\an8}<i>That's good, Barry.</i>

13
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,661
{\an8}We have our work cut out for us.

14
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,706
{\an8}I'm not getting faster, am I?

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,958
{\an8}-Well...
-No. You're not.

16
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,502
{\an8}All right. Well, let's fix this, right?

17
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,003
{\an8}I mean, I can't beat Zoom at this speed.

18
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,797
{\an8}It felt like I was standing still
next to him.

19
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,048
{\an8}Oh, that's because you practically were.

20
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,385
{\an8}Zoom is at least three,
four times faster than you at this point.

21
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,887
{\an8}How is he so much faster than Barry is,
and Jay was?

22
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:57,557
{\an8}Physiology, form, strength.

23
00:00:57,765 --> 00:01:01,269
{\an8}Could be a number of things.
Attitude, diet...

24
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,313
{\an8}Okay. Well, there's gotta be
something we can do about it.

25
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:07,359
{\an8}-So, let's just figure it out. Fast. Okay?
-(PHONE BUZZING)

26
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:11,238
{\an8}All right, I gotta go. I'm meeting Patty.
I'll see you. Thank you.

27
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,907
{\an8}So how are we gonna help Barry?

28
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,161
{\an8}I'm out of ideas, and we've tried
everything you suggested.

29
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,081
{\an8}Well, not everything.

32
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:44,937
{\an8}Any trouble?

33
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,690
Nah. But believe it or not,
we got ourselves a stowaway.

34
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,941
POLICE CHIEF: <i>Give you his name?</i>

35
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,444
Didn't say.
Sat in the brig silent for three weeks.

36
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,406
He was all decked out in this
when we found him.

37
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,616
POLICE CHIEF: Jeez. How many are there?

38
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,370
Thirty-two. And I will polish them all
in blood before long.

39
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:03,915
I've waited a long time for this hunt,

40
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,460
and you have brought me
very close to my prey.

41
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,964
Mister, you're not gonna do
any hunting in those handcuffs.

42
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,760
Oh, but, Captain,
you're wearing the cuffs.

Actually, I taught him.

I feel you out there.

50
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,152
{\an8}Man, this was a bloodbath.

51
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,946
{\an8}Done by one person.

52
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,365
{\an8}One person did all this?

53
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,199
{\an8}Oh, yeah. You can see
from the blood pattern.

54
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,536
{\an8}This guy was shot first,
then the Police Chief,

55
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:27,374
{\an8}then these three were stabbed,
before finishing off the Captain.

56
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,166
Wow! Do you think a meta-human did it?

57
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,129
I don't know, but I found this
in all of the stab victims' wounds.

58
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,047
It's some type of cryptocrystalline.

59
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,551
Flint, most likely. Probably broke off
the blade during the fight.

60
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,886
I'll run it to make sure.

61
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,389
Let's see what stores
sell those kind of flint knives.

62
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,393
Will do. And I'll call you later.

63
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,520
-Okay.
-Okay.

64
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:52,399
It's so cute. You guys are trying
not to be affectionate in front of me.

65
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,402
{\an8}No. We're just showing
some professionalism.

00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:57,153

00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,593
{\an8}So what's up?
I thought we were gonna go to dinner.

72

{\an8}Whoa. What's going on here?

73
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:28,268
{\an8}I couldn't decide
which restaurant to go to,

Yeah. Let's keep that on the DL.

This is the same knife that was used

So it is the same guy.

Definitely. But the thing is,
these blades are old. Centuries old.

Do you have any idea why this guy

No. I've never seen him before in my life.

Well, he was certainly
acting like he knew you.

He kept calling her Priestess Chay-Ara.

00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,078
That's Coptic.

-You mean Egyptian?
-That's right.

120
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:59,168
Well, I grew up in Wisconsin
and I've never even left the States, so...

121
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,754
This guy, he's clearly
incredibly dangerous.

122
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,256
So I need you to at least
let us try to protect you.

123

I can put a detail on her.

<i>You didn't see this guy, Joe.</i>

125
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,596
No offense, but I don't think
a cop is gonna be able to protect her.

126
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,057
No, but we do have a few friends
who can lend a hand.

127
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,017
But we're gonna need
to leave Central City.

128
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:16,561
And go where?

129
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,439
You really wanna go to Star City?

Yeah, I think we do, man.

Man, you fought meta-humans with abilities
a lot worse than "knife-throwing."

133
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,864
I don't think this guy's a meta-human.

134
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:32,619
There's something different about him.
Something mystical.

135
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,953
Mystical, really?

136
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,288
We stop meta-humans
because we're scientists.

137
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,874
We can figure out
what their weaknesses are.

138
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,752
But we don't have any experience
when it comes to guys like this.

-Mmm!

00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,132
This wouldn't have anything
to do with Zoom, would it?

141
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,801
No. I'm just trying to keep Kendra safe.

142
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,094
This is the best way to do that.

even have time to help us?

to hide this chemical bomb.

00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,844
That was actually pretty clever.

And guess what, Oliver? It did work.

doing that in my ear.</i>

Oh, I totally forgot that
this was an open line.

Ooh, you know, I gotta be honest,

I really thought we'd be doing this dance
a lot longer. Night, night.

Damn it. Every time.

00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,878
It's the Flash!
Did I know we knew the Flash?

172
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,923
We know the Flash. Okay.
I didn't know we knew the Flash.

173
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,176
Thank you. But I don't think that
you ran all the way here to protect us.

174
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:58,347
No, not to protect you.
I need to protect a friend.

175
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,187
Wow!

176
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:08,232
Nice new digs.

177

Also, I just noticed, no sleeves.
Don't you get cold?

178
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,947
I spent the better part of five years on
an island near the North China Sea.

179
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,448
I don't get cold, Barry.

I'm so glad you're okay.

186
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:28,628
So this is what it's like dating her.

187
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,504
More bruises from her
than from Deathstroke.

188
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,801
Okay. S.T.A.R. Labs is impressive,
but this is...

189
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,261
This is completely wrong.

190
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,972
Did you guys even look
at the specs I sent over?

191
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,309
This is a tragedy. I'm mourning
for the death of engineering.

from the Palmer Satellite
or else your system is gonna overload.

00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,859
Yeah, but that hasn't happened
since last week.

195
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,861
I mean, it didn't...
It happened yesterday.

-Hi.
-I'm Felicity.

I'm Kendra Saunders. I'm Cisco's...

She's my new beautiful friend,
who kisses me, occasionally.

-That's nice.
-(CLEARING THROAT)

-Hi.
<i>-Wow.</i>

203
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:20,012
Okay, first, I meet the Flash,
and now, the Green Arrow.

204
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,973
-Do you have any other surprises for me?
-(CHUCKLES)

00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,808
Please. No more surprises.

206
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,227
Barry said that you need our help.

207
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,145
Somebody very dangerous is after you.

208
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,689
Yeah, and I have no idea why.

209
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,566
What's does this guy even look like?

210
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,068
Uh... Hold on.

211
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,993
(CLEARS THROAT) Okay. This is him.

212
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,702
Yeah. See, that's something
I would never think of.

213
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,538
Hmm, kinda rockin'
that Dothraki look. Hot.

214
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:49,041
Let's see if facial recognition
can find a match.

215
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,211
(BEEPING)

216
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,548
That's him.

217
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,718
Yeah, strange.
This picture's from 1975.

218
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,553
Which would make him about
80 years old right now.

219
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,264
Okay, what else can you tell us?

220
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:07,894
He said we've known each other for ages,
but I've never met the man before.

221
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,728
But there has to be
some kind of a connection.

222
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,688
Not one I can think of.

223
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,941
I just moved to Central City,
six months ago.

224
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,692
Why'd you move there?

225
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,404
I just felt drawn to the city, I guess.

226
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,115
Kendra, there is a reason
this guy's after you. Think.

227
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:24,076
Look, man, we just came out here
to hide out for a bit

228
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,745
until we figure things out, so you can
just take it down just a little.

229
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,581
You came here because you need our help.
This is what my help looks like.

230
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,083
<i>Oliver, I just saved you guys</i>

231
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,377
from whatever the hell Flock of Seagulls
was about to do.

232
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:34,628
The least you can do is just...

233
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,463
Barry, none of us have superpowers.

234
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:38,883
You brought Kendra into our world
without knowing who she is

235
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,302
or what this dude
that is after her is looking for.

236
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,889
You made all of us unsafe.
So maybe you ask the questions.

237
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,098
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

238
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,602
-We're all friends here, right?
-Mmm-hmm.

239
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,646
Why don't we go back to our place
and have some drinks,

240
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:53,981
and we can talk.

241
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,400
Cool.

242
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:57,776
What you working on?

243
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,322
This is a formula meant to increase

244
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,408
a speedster's velocity
that I've been developing

245
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:06,785
<i>since Zoom showed up on my Earth.</i>

246
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:10,122
Ironically, this was meant
to help out Jay Garrick.

247
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,458
You want to give Barry a drug
to make him run faster?

248
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,294
Temporarily enhance the Speed Force
in his system, yes.

249
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,671
So you're trying to make
nitrous oxide for speedsters.

250
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:18,965
Good analogy. Yes, I tried.

251
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,799
Five times I've tried,
five times I've failed.

252
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:24,803
That's what you get when your background
is technology and not biochemistry.

253
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,431
-Well, then you are lucky I am here.
-What does that mean?

254
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,183
You've been thinking of this
as a mechanical problem,

255
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,684
not a biomechanical one.

256
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:31,978
And what does that mean?

257
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:36,107
When a speedster runs, they consume
an extraordinary amount of oxygen.

258
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,151
So we just need something to give
an extra boost of oxygen during that time.

259
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,362
-Like an oxygen generator.
-Exactly!

260
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,156
So we just need
a chemical that's rich in oxygen,

261
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:48,494
that would release it as a nearly pure gas
as it decomposes.

262
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,122
-Something like sodium chlorate.
-Sodium chlorate.

263
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,832
Then, all we need is heat
to release the oxygen.

264
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,336
Which a speedster generates naturally
in the form of lightning.

265
00:13:58,545 --> 00:14:00,381
I think something like this
just might work.

266
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:01,840
You think you can help me figure it out?

267
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,217
I can certainly try.

268
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:08,014
I'm not changing my nickname.
I like Speedy.

269
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,640
CISCO: <i>Are you familiar
with my body of work?</i>

270
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,683
If you are, then you know I can come up

271
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,978
with something so much
better than "Speedy."

272
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:18,357
Why don't you get a haircut,
and then maybe we can talk about it.

273
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,193
I think you just mad 'cause
my conditioner game is on point.

274
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:26,157
So, the CEO of Palmer Technologies
is living with Oliver Queen.

275
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,534
It's insane how much
life can change in six months, huh?

276
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:32,204
Which you would know better than anyone,
considering that there's another Flash,

277
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,707
-another Dr. Wells, from another Earth?
-Mmm-hmm.

278
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,544
-I mean...
-Yeah. I know. It's been trippy lately.

279
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:43,507
I wonder what Oliver's doppelgänger
would look like. Bald. Pot-bellied.

280
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,551
-Uh-huh.
-Agreeable.

281
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:46,886
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

282
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,056
You seeing anyone?

283
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,183
-I am, actually.
-Good.

284
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,561
Patty is her name. She is amazing.

285
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:57,897
-You deserve someone amazing.
-Thanks.

286

-(BELL DINGS)
-(GASPS)

287
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,400
My pigs in a blanket.

288
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:06,863
Hey, Ollie. Look, I'm sorry
that I laid all of this on you.

289
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,740
-I know that it wasn't fair.
-(SIGHS) That's okay.

290
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,577
-I'm sorry if earlier I was a little...
-Snippy?

291
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,745
-I have been called worse.
-(CHUCKLES)

292
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,040
No, but I'm glad that you're here.
I'm glad you reached out.

293
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:19,585
It shows a real maturity. And I would know
that because I've never been that mature.

294
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:20,920
(LAUGHS)

295
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,504
I'm always here for you.

296
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,340
Thank you.

297
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,426
I gotta say, I mean, this isn't the same
Arrow team I'm used to seeing.

298
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,429
Or the same Oliver Queen.
You seem really...

299
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:32,431
-Happy?
-Happy. Yeah.

300
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,392
I am happy. I finally have everything
that I've ever wanted.

301
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:40,022
Being with Felicity has given me
a real sense of peace.

302
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,773
It's something that I haven't had
in a long time.

303
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,860
Didn't you tell me that guys like us
don't get the girl?

304
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,238
Yep. I was wrong.

(LAUGHS)

306
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:51,783
I would like to propose a toast.

307
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,871
I wish it wasn't just the dark times
bringing us together.

308
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:01,752
But it is friends like you
that make those dark times worth having.

309
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,463
(CHUCKLES) What a guy!
Steals my drink, steals my words.

310
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,590
As I was saying,
it's good to see everyone.

311
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:07,924
-Yes.
-Cheers.

312
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,468
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

313
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,470
-(CLEARS THROAT)
-Mmm.

314
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,558
Look, don't worry, all right?
We're gonna keep her safe. I promise.

315
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:20,146
Yeah. I know.
Look, there's something I never told you.

316
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,150
The first time I kissed Kendra,
I got a vibe.

317
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,068
No, not like that kind of vibe.

318
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,944
-Like I vibed-vibed.
-Oh!

319
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,489
Remember the man with wings?
It wasn't a man.

320
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,158
It was Kendra.

321
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:34,285
And she was, like, a bird.

322
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,495
You think that she's a meta-human?

323

(MUMBLING UNCERTAINTY)

324
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,665
Wait, why didn't you say anything
about this sooner?

325
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,501
Well, I didn't think it was related,
but I guess, now, it has to be.

326
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,463
Look, I don't, I don't want her
to know about my powers.

327
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,509
I have this great thing going with her.

328
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,847
And she laughs at my jokes,
and she loves movies, and...

329
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,351
I just...
I've never felt like this before,

330
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,187
and I don't want to sabotage it.

331
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,356
I get the feeling.

332
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,150
Look!

333
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,159
I will always find you, Chay-Ara.

334
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,704
Don't move!

335
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,164
Then how will I kill you all?

What did you do?

342
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,597
I ended it.

343
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,768
This is why we ask questions!

Okay. Thanks.

347
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:50,296
All right. Lance is gonna call if he gets
any information on whoever that is.

348
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,424
I know where we can get some info.

349
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,640
Kendra, I have powers.

350
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,313
I get these vibes from people,
they're visions of meta-humans.

351
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,649
And I had one of you.

352
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:15,987
So, A, you're saying you're a meta-human,
and B, she's a meta-human?

353
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:19,950
I don't know. In these visions,
you could fly.

354
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,995
It was like you were a bird of some sort.

355
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,290
-A bird?
-Yeah.

356

(STUTTERS) What else did you see?

357

That's it. Just you with wings.

358

I think you did do it.

-Velocity-Six?
-Ah!

368
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,213
This is what was so urgent, Harrison?

369
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,923
You get me to come here
so I can take your speed drug?

-That's right.
-You knew about this?

-Of course she did. She figured it out.
-Uh...

372
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:24,431
I thought this was to help Barry.

373
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:27,559
It is to help Barry. Which is why we need
to do test runs on subjects

374
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,895
who once had the Speed Force
in their system.

375
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,730
Speed Force doesn't work like that.

376
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,233
It's not something
you can create in a lab.

377

How do you think you became
the Flash, Garrick?

378
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:41,072
By me and a lab. Science is what
did this to you, to Barry, to Zoom.

379
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,200
And science is what we need to stop Zoom,
and this is our only option.

380
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:47,288
Find another one! Speed Force
can't be replicated or enhanced.

381
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,456
It's a living thing.
It's a gift that was given to me.

382
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,917
That drug, you have no idea
what it's gonna do.

383
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,753
I'm not letting another one of your
experiments mess with me again.

to be your guinea pig.

Caitlin, keep that serum away from Barry.

-Where are you going?
-To pick up what we need.

388
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,139
Wait! Jay just said
we shouldn't give it to Barry.

389
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,267
We're gonna do what we need.

390
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,106
The man you're looking for
is Vandal Savage.

391
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,859
-Vandal Savage? Never heard of him.
-Well, who is he?

392
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,945
Some say he was the most trusted adviser
to Genghis Khan.

393
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,614
Others say he guided Julius Caesar
through the Gallic Wars.

394
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:27,118
But one thing the League knows for sure,
he was there for all of it.

395
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,955
So what are you saying?
He's like a vampire or something?

396
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:32,291
Not a vampire. An Immortal.

397
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:36,795
Okay, we've officially stepped
into crazy town. Immortality?

398
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,297
But wait, no, no, no. This makes sense.

399
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:42,050
This explains why he looks the same
as he did in 1975.

400
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,385
This can't be possible.

401
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,429
There's nothing you can do
to save her now.

402
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,974
Kendra, do not listen to him.

403
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,810
I just need some air.

404
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,819
Hey. We are gonna do whatever we have to
to keep Kendra safe.

Hey, Joe, it's Patty.

407
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,743
I just interviewed a weapons expert
about the flint knife our attacker used.

408
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:11,330
I found out something pretty interesting.

00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,844
-You gonna be all right?
-This is a lot to take in right now.

412
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,846
Look, I'm... I'm sorry
I didn't tell you about me before.

413
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,099
I didn't want things to be
different between us.

414
00:22:31,307 --> 00:22:32,601
It's not that, Cisco.

415
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,603
If what everyone's saying is true,

416
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:38,106
and it's beginning to seem like it is,
my whole life just changed.

417
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,192
And I am so not ready for that.

418
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,153
I hear what you're saying. I do.

419
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:48,366
When I first learned about my powers,

420
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,953
I remember feeling
that exact same feeling.

421
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,039
And sometimes, I still feel that way.

422
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,541
And all I can say is,

423
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:01,713
every day gets a little bit more normal.

424
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,966
I promise you.

425
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,721
Thank you.

426
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,014

Until then, you need to stay by my side
so that I can protect you.

Protect me? From what?

(GASPING)

462
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,535
We need to expose his wings.

463
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:38,954
I'm open to suggestions.

464
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,205
What, now you're listening to me?

465
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:41,372
It's your city, Oliver.

466
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,958
All right.

467
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,352
(GROANING)

468
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,041

00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,586
(PANTING)

470
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,756
-That's new.
-(CHUCKLES)

471
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:33,008
Yeah. Comes in handy.

472
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,556
We can't use that serum on Barry.

473
00:26:41,432 --> 00:26:42,768
That's up to him, isn't it?

474
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:47,438
If Barry wants to stop Zoom,
this is what he needs.

475
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:48,857
Jay said it could hurt Barry.

476
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,108
Well, Jay's a coward.

477
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,028
Jay's a scientist
who knows a lot about speedsters.

478
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,279
You're a scientist, Snow.

479
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:57,532
You've been watching Barry, you know
he's nowhere near fast as he needs to be.

480
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,951
This other mentor,
this other Harrison Wells,

481
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,620
did not want him to reach
his full potential. I do.

482
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,748
You know, you're really starting
to sound a lot like him.

483
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:09,961
PATTY: Put your hands in the air.

484
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,631
-Who are you?
-You're under arrest.

485
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,259
Dr. McGee was right. She did see you.

486
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:20,638
-Christina McGee?
-At Mercury Labs. You're Harrison Wells.

487
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,058
Yes, I'm Harrison Wells.
I'm not the Harrison Wells...

488
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,475
Stop! You move closer and I'll shoot!

489
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,811
Give me that...

490
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,822
(GASPS)

491
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,824
Oh, my God! What have you done?

492
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,952
Harrison! Harrison Wells, stay with me.

493
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,291
Harrison. Harrison, stay with me.
Stay with me, Harrison Wells. Come on.

494
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:49,584
Why did you shoot him?

495
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,502
I thought that was a gun.
I'm sorry. I'll call 911.

496
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:52,796
-No! Don't!
-Why?

497
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,006
Because this...
Didn't Joe West explain this to you?

498
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,674
-No.
-Just call Joe!

499
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:57,968
Okay.

500
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,690
(GRUNTING)

501
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,525
Where is she?

502
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,194
-What's your name?
-You're putting her in danger

503
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,113
and I'm the only one
capable of saving her.

504
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:21,657
A very interesting perspective
on what the word "saving" means.

505
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,368
She's the love of my lifetimes,
sweetheart.

506
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:25,536
I was not gonna hurt her.

507
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,622
You need to let me go!

508
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:33,669
Chay-Ara...

509
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,630
My name is Kendra Saunders.

510
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,215
In this life.

511
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:41,469
And I am, was Carter Hall.
But that is not who we are.

512
00:28:41,677 --> 00:28:43,221
What does that mean?

513
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:46,057
You're Priestess Chay-Ara,
I'm Prince Khufu.

514
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,894
And we're lovers, soul mates.

515
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,479
We've been partners
for 4,000 years.

516
00:28:51,687 --> 00:28:53,398
We're drawn to each other in each life,
and after we die,

517
00:28:53,564 --> 00:28:56,567
we reincarnate to find each other again,
and again, and again.

518
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,154
And now that I've found you,
we should really get out of here.

519
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,406
Okay, Romeo,
why don't you pump the brakes?

520
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:04,743
These people cannot protect you
from Savage any longer.

521
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,577
Do you know who Vandal Savage is?

522
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,875
In every lifetime,
he hunts us down and kills us.

523
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,210
He's done it 206 times.

524
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,087
And I'm not planning to make it 207.

525
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,756
Why does he kill you?

526
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,758
His life force is tethered to ours.

527
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,762
Every time he kills us,
he becomes more powerful. You do the math.

528
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,430
You're 0 for 206,

529
00:29:25,596 --> 00:29:27,933
and you still think
you're her best bet, hmm?

530
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:31,269
Okay, so what we need to do
is just find Savage and get rid of him.

531
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,773
(SCOFFS) Well,
you can't get rid of him, my friend.

532
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,775
Oh, yeah? Watch us.

533
00:29:37,608 --> 00:29:39,444
It might be harder than you think.

534
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,113
(STUTTERS) Is that the only way
this guy knows how to enter a room?

535
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,366
My associates tell me
Savage left Star City a few hours ago.

536
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,617
For where?

537
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,912
We're not quite sure. But I assume
after his run in with you,

538
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,957
he realized he needed something
more powerful to complete his mission.

539
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,416
(SCOFFS) Well...

540
00:29:53,749 --> 00:29:55,751
We think he's trying to locate
the Staff of Horus.

541
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,796
Sorry, what is that?

542
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:01,424
It's a relic from our past.
An ancient and powerful weapon.

543
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:06,805
If Savage gets his hands on it, it's gonna
be nearly impossible to stop him.

544
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,933
Since when did our lives suddenly become
an Indiana Jones movie?

545
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,227
-Felicity? Think you can find it?
-Yeah.

546
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,895
Yes. It's probably at some
museum somewhere.

547
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,815
I'll work my magic.
See what I can find.

548
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,151
We're running out of time.

549
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:24,155
You need to emerge, now. Come on.

550
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,491
What is it going to take for you
to believe me? You saw my wings.

551
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,659
I know you know this is true.

552
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,287
Please, just let me show you how.

553
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,585
-How's he doing?
-He's losing oxygen.

554
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,465
-I need you to leave.
-Joe, I...

555
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:43,842
Patty, go.

556
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:46,845
There's a bullet in a branch
of his pulmonary artery

557
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,639
that's blocking off most of the blood flow
from the left lung.

558
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,016
Are we able to get the bullet out?

559
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,851
Not without causing too much damage.

560
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,477
I need Jay's help.

561
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,823
So,

562
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,702
you just want me to jump?

563
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:16,041
Fall, jump, swan dive,
whatever suits you. Just, do it.

564
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,084
Okay. This isn't the X Games.

565
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,170
OLIVER: <i>And this is how she emerges?</i>

566
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,548
She just falls towards her death?

567
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,384
Yep. 4,000 years of experience
says that's exactly how.

568
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,718
Just watch and learn.

569
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:30,889
No, I'm sorry. What are we doing?
Why are we listening to this guy?

570
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:34,059
Come on, Oliver. You're supposed to be
the one who asks questions.

571
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:37,437
Okay, but after what we saw,
after what Cisco said,

572
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,272
I cannot believe I'm gonna say this,

573
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,275
but it kinda makes sense.

574
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,906
Hey, hey, hey.

575
00:31:52,618 --> 00:31:53,744
I need to try.

576
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,038
Are you serious?

577
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,915
-Yes, she is.
-(GASPS)

578
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,210
(SCREAMING)

579
00:32:04,755 --> 00:32:06,132
What the hell was that?

580
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:09,469
Saving her life. You should have emerged.
Something is blocking you.

581
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,221
Well, we should just try again
and see...

582
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,888
-No!
-Yeah, no! No, no, no.

583
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,266
No. We're not doing that again.
Kendra, you don't have to do this.

584
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,936
Oliver, we can stop Savage, okay?

585
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,770
<i>-Barry!</i>
-What?

586
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,774
Can I talk to you for a second?

587
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,111
Okay.

588
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,612
Keep an eye on him.

589
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,242
What is going on with you?

590
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,451
I'm trying to keep her alive.

591
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:35,786
-Then I think we let her jump.
-Are you kidding?

592
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,789
Barry, I get that you're desperate to help
and you want to be the hero,

593
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:40,291
and you wanna save her yourself.

594
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,418
But I think she has to have
a part in it, too.

595
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,295
(SCOFFS)

596
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:47,507
-What?
-It's just the rules keep changing.

597
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,134
One day, I have to run through time,

598
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,261
the next,
I'm fighting a telepathic gorilla.

599
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,803
(STUTTERING) And now, we're what?

600
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,847
We're, we're chasing down
an immortal madman

601
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,976
on a rampage against
a reincarnated warrior Priestess?

602
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,352
(BOTH SIGH)

603
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,480
I just never thought I'd have superpowers

604
00:33:02,688 --> 00:33:04,983
and feel more powerless
than I ever have in my entire life.

605
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,778
That part, I understand.
But you have already helped Kendra.

606
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,780
You have kept her alive.

607
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:12,490
So now, let's help her get her wings,

608
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:15,035
and then she can give you
a lift back to Central City.

609
00:33:17,828 --> 00:33:21,457
-Central City.
-What?

610
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,169
We need to check Central City
for the staff.

611
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,337
-Kendra, you said you were drawn there?
-Yeah.

612
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,006
I think you're drawn to things
that destroy you,

613
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,674
the same way the two of you
are drawn to each other.

614
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,884
That's why it wasn't in any museum
or private collection,

615
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,845
because it was consecrated eight months
ago at St. Mark's in Central City.

616
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,556
We've gotta get it before Savage does.

617
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:38,724
Carter, stay here.

618
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,060
I'm not going anywhere.

619
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:43,313
Call Thea and Dig and we'll have them hold
down the fort in case Savage shows up.

620
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,815
Kendra, last year, I lost my powers.

621
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,192
The only way I could get them back is

622
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,527
if I just forgot about everything
happening around me,

623
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,654
and focused on who I was.

624
00:33:51,987 --> 00:33:54,865
Just believe in yourself,
and your true self will emerge.

625
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,576
Thanks.

626
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:59,162
Hey. Are you sure that
you want to do this?

627
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:03,416
If this guy's immortal and Merlyn's right
about how powerful this staff is...

628
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,545
We'll be fine. Kiss her.

629
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,922
We'll be fine.

630
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,594
-Careful.
-Let's go.

631
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,024
Now what?

632
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,152
His systolic pressure's dropping.
He's gonna code.

633
00:34:32,903 --> 00:34:34,239
How bad is it?

634
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,241
There's a bullet in his pulmonary artery.

635
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,577
-Can you close the wound if I get it?
-Yes.

636
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,246
How are you gonna do that?

637
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:46,334
-What is that?
-It's a serum, called Velocity-Six.

638
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,918
It could give Jay temporary speed.

639
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,338
He can phase through Dr. Wells' chest,
and remove the bullet.

640
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,882
Yeah. But I told you, I've no idea
what's gonna happen if I use that.

641
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,175
It's our only option.

642
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,261
If you don't do this,
Dr. Wells will die.

643
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,098
(GRUNTS)

644
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,020
(GROANING)

645
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,234
It's working.

646
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,943
(GRUNTING)

647
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:17,282
(GASPING)

648
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:27,958
BP and oxygenation is rising.
Blood flow's returning to his lungs.

649
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,086
Thank you.

650
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,467
I was just thinking,

651
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:40,471
all the moments in my life
when I felt different,

652
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,973
like something was wrong with me,

653
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,644
now I know why.

654
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:52,233
It's gonna be all right, okay?

655
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:58,156
Look, I know what it's like to have
your life suddenly change like this.

656
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,492
I can help you get through this.

657
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,161
I don't know if you can.

658
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,998
Cisco, there is a whole
other life inside me.

659
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:12,503
Hundreds of lives
that I need to know about.

660
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:16,507
I think I need to do it by myself.

661
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,428
I have to embrace my destiny.

662
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:22,805
I have to believe.

663
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:26,851
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

664
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,355
You don't have to do this.

665
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,862
What's going on?

666
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,698
Nothing. I just like to speed
into rooms, usually.

667
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,658
ARROW: Uh-huh. And where do you think
we find this thing?

668
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,370
I haven't been in
one of these places in a while.

669
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,040
We're too late.

670
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:54,044
Something you're not used to
saying very often, I'd imagine.

671
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,882
You tried those arrows
once before, remember?

672
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:00,510
They didn't quite finish the job,
now did they?

673
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,387
I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

674
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,846
You're gonna leave Kendra alone.

675
00:37:04,054 --> 00:37:07,057
I can't do that.
While my destiny is to live forever,

676
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,060
Chay-Ara's is to die, as is yours now.

677
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,577
-Any ideas?
-Oh, now you'll listen to me?

678
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,078
It's your city.

679
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,711
-Let's just try to get the staff.
-All right.

680
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,588
-On my mark.
-All right.

681
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:44,262
Carter was right.
Something's holding me back.

682
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,431
Maybe it's Central City, or you.

683
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,098
Or what I thought my life was going to be.

684
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,768
But I'm never gonna become
who I really am unless I let go.

685
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,853
I have to do this.

686
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,528
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

687
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:05,115
(CHUCKLES) In all my countless years,
I've never encountered

688
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,911
anybody with your capabilities.
Astonishing!

689
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,372
No!

690
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,382
Chay-Ara...

691
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,968
(CHUCKLING) Oh, my God!

692
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:26,971
(EXCLAIMING)

693
00:38:27,137 --> 00:38:31,934
I used to enjoy slow deaths.
Now, I just find them boring.

694
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:43,821
(EXHALES) Thanks.

695
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,781
Yeah. Any chance he blew
himself up in there?

696
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,991
Not likely.

697
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:48,826
So that's like a tie, right?

698
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,953
-I guess.
-I will take it.

(EXCLAIMING)

700
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:08,971
Hey, are you okay?

701
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:10,848
I'm gonna have to learn
how to use these things.

702
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:12,266
(CHUCKLES)

703
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,269
You'll get the hang of it, Hawkgirl.

704
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,447
Dr. Wells, you're gonna be okay.

705
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:29,700
That's good news.

706
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,871
You will probably be very sore
for a little while, though.

707
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:35,956
Sore's better than dead.

708
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:38,376
Yes, it is.

709
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,215
How you doing, Garrick?

710
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,968
Your serum's out of my system.

711
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,471
And I will never take it again.

712
00:39:57,227 --> 00:39:58,353
Jay.

713
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,232
Thank you.

714
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:06,404
You can thank me by keeping
that Velocity-Six away from Barry.

715
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,749
That was Oliver.
Savage has the Staff of Horus.

716
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,586
He wants us all in Central City
as soon as possible.

717
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,713
Okay, well, Laurel's already
there visiting her mom,

718
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,923
so I'll call her and let her know
we're coming by.

719
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,259
If Savage is in Central City,
then why are we going back there?

720
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,595
So we can end this.

721
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,431
And if anybody's gonna take down Savage,
it's gonna be Barry and Oliver.

722
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,766
Plus, you've emerged.
It's gonna be much harder for him now.

723
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,352
And together, all of us,
we can take him down once and for all.

724
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,271
Okay. So how are we gonna get there?

725
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,443
Did I mention I'm the CEO
of a big company with a private jet?

726
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,913
Since when is that a thing?

727
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,124
About eight months.

728
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,127
Maybe if you save Star City,
you might get one, too.

729
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,714
By the way, we still need to get Savage.

730
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,298
We'll get him.

731

00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,311
Yeah.
