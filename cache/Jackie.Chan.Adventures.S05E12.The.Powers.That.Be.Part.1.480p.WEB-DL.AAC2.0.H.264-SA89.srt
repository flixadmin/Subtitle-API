1
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:05,404
Waitress: Refill, hon?

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:07,539
Black: Thanks.

3
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:08,674
(Sighs)

4
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:10,075
Nice to have
a few minutes

5
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:11,777
before heading
into the office.

6
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:12,978
Waitress: So what do you do?

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,346
Black: Oh, uh...

8
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,148
I'm in pest control.

9
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,951
Waitress: Ha.
Got a few in this place,
I can tell you that.

10
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:22,388
(Engine revving)

11
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:28,794
Black: Hey!
What the--uhh!

12
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,203
Waitress: What, no tip?

13
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,307
(Crash)

14
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,776
Uncle: Eyaah!

15
00:00:43,778 --> 00:00:46,211
You break it,
you bought it!

16
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,279
(Gasps)

17
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,583
Uncle: Eyaah!

18
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:54,787
Uncle reserves right to
refuse service to <i> you.</i>

19
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,456
S-whoooooo!

20
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,527
Zwwww! Uhh!

21
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:03,395
I broke it...

22
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:07,132
You still bought it! Oop!

23
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:09,301
(Tohru whistling)

24
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:11,503
(Gasps)

25
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,512
Jackie: No! Stop!

26
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:23,816
The persian carpet
should go to the left
of the abyssinian.

27
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:25,017
(Cell phone rings)

28
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:26,251
Oh, excuse me.

29
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:27,486
Hello?

30
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,822
Tohru: Jackie, something
has happened to uncle.

31
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:32,324
He has been taken away
in a huge vehicle.

32
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,159
Jackie, yelling:
I am sorry, tohru.

33
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,028
It is hard to hear you.

34
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,665
There is a very loud
truck outside.

35
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:19,972
Jackie: Bwaaaa!

36
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,376
Uh, deliveries
in the back, please.

37
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,178
Strikemaster ice:
Not a delivery, yo...

38
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,113
It's a pick up...

39
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:30,082
And you're the merchandise.

40
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,188
Ugh! That's all right.

41
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,457
We'll just kick it
old school.

42
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,592
Jackie: Uhh!

43
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,195
Please, no more
kicking it...

44
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:44,530
Or punching it,

45
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:47,666
and especially
no burning it.

46
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,469
Whatever is troubling you,

47
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,804
why don't we
discuss it outside?

48
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:56,074
These carpets are
a thousand years old.

49
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,442
Strikemaster ice:
For reals? Tsk.

50
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,077
Now see, a museum this nice

51
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,613
ought to spring for
a new wall-to-wall shag.

52
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,682
Jackie: Aah!

53
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:09,421
Jackie: Aah! Kettle...
Hot, hot, hot!

54
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:10,622
Strikemaster ice:
Aw, dawg,

55
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,558
you just need to put
a little ice on that...

56
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,126
Strikemaster ice.

57
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,196
Jackie: Uhh!

58
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,899
(Jackie groans)

59
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,836
Ms. hardman: And this is
another perfect example

60
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,772
of prehistoric man.

61
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:29,908
Now let's move on
to a later specimen:

62
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,178
The brutish cro-magnon man.

63
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,780
Kids: Ugh! Yikes!
What the...

64
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,815
Jade: Tohru??
What's going--uhh!

65
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,918
Tohru: Uh, may Jade
be excused?

66
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,488
Ms. hardman: Uh...
Well, I--I suppose.

67
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,558
Has she been signed out
at the office?

68
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,660
Jade: Jackie <i> and</i> uncle?

69
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,262
Tohru: Yes.
I phoned section 13

70
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:52,564
and it seems captain black
is missing as well.

71
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,166
Jade: This is big, t.

72
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,868
Tohru:
What's most important
is that I keep you safe.

73
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,271
Jade: Safe, nothing.
Time to tcb.

74
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:00,806
Take care of business.

75
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:01,907
Hello?

76
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,476
Rescue Jackie, uncle,
and the captain.

77
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,348
Jade: Ok. Job one:

78
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,616
Search for clues.

79
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:11,883
Once we I.D.
The perps--

80
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,051
(phone rings)

81
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,920
Tohru: It is Jackie's
cell phone calling.

82
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,021
Jade: Jackie?

83
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:18,023
Drago: Unnhhh! Guess again.

84
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:20,692
But your uncle is
a guest of mine,

85
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,695
along with the old-timer
and captain "whack."

86
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,697
Jade: You touch one hair
on their heads--

87
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,099
well, not captain black,

88
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,367
'cause, you know,
he doesn't have any,

89
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:29,968
but you know
what I mean!

90
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,972
Drago: Uh, you're in
no position to be making
threats, junior,

91
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:37,242
but their safe return
is up to you.

92
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:39,411
Jade: So it's a ransom
you're after.

93
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:40,545
I'm listening.

94
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,913
Drago: Here's the deal.

95
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,582
You get all 3 of them back

96
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,417
when I get
- the containment unit.

97
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,487
You know, the one with
all the demon chi.

98
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,621
Jade: Yeah, well...

99
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,123
I don't know what
you're talking about.

100
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,257
(Sniffs)

101
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,526
You had garlic for
breakfast, didn't you?

102
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,061
Drago: don't play dumb.

103
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:58,563
Deliver the chi or else.

104
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,132
Jade: It'll take
some time.

105
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:03,268
Drago: Time is something
you don't have, pipsqueak.

106
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,638
We make the switch
at 3 A.M. on
the golden gate bridge.

107
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,973
Be there or--

108
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,341
Jade: Be square?

109
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:11,677
Drago: No! Be there
or you'll be spending

110
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:12,978
the rest of your
wonder years

111
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,114
being raised by that
500-pound sumo.

112
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,052
Jade: Sheesh!
Evil <i> and</i> a jerk.

113
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:23,288
Tohru: Hmmph!
I weigh only 480.

114
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,191
Jade: Ok. We gotta go along
with what drago says.

115
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,593
Jackie and uncle
and black's lives
are at stake.

116
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:31,596
Tohru: But allowing drago
to take possession
of the demon powers

117
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,665
will put the entire
planet at risk.

118
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,601
Jade: Duh! That's why
we're gonna pull
a fast one.

119
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,203
Sure, we deliver
the containment unit,

120
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:40,872
but not before
- you come up with a spell.

121
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,607
Tohru: A spell?
Jade: Yep.

122
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,609
A spell to put the kibosh
on drago--

123
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,446
to short-circuit the powers
as soon as drago sucks 'em up.

124
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:49,214
Tohru: That's a wonderful ID--

125
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,683
wait. I am just
uncle's apprentice.

126
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,152
A spell that powerful is...

127
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,655
Well, beyond my abilities.

128
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:58,523
Jade: What are you
talking about, big guy?

129
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,159
You've got mad skills!
You know what uncle told me?

130
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,196
He said, (Imitating uncle)
"Tohru may be most
naturally gifted wizard

131
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:05,964
uncle has ever met."

132
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,165
Tohru: Really?

133
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,634
Jade: Uh, well, maybe
not those exact words,

134
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,236
but with the same accent.

135
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:14,339
The point is,
he totally believes in you,
and so do I.

136
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,844
Jade: Where are you going?

137
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,746
Tohru: I have a spell
to conjure.

138
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,748
Jade: You go, t!
I know you can do it!

139
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,683
She said, hopefully.

140
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:30,989
Drago: Everyone comfy?

141
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,357
No? Good.

142
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,626
Black: Whatever it is
you want, drago,

143
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,361
(chains clatter)
You're not going to get it.

144
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:38,363
Drago: Oh, but I am!

145
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:41,366
In 8 chi-licious flavors.

146
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,769
Jackie:
The containment unit.

147
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:46,772
Drago: I first considered
an assault on section 13

148
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:49,574
but then realized...
Why battle for it

149
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:53,678
when the containment unit
can be hand-delivered
in a nice, tidy bow.

150
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,683
Uncle: Huh! Too much time
in junkyard makes demon
speak rubbish!

151
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,619
Drago: Think again,
old-timer.

152
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,220
You know the old saying...

153
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:05,857
A chan is only as strong
as its weakest link.

154
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:08,260
Tch. I hope it's not
a school night.

155
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,195
Jackie: Leave Jade
out of this.

156
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:12,631
Drago: Too late!
She's the main attraction.

157
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:15,300
And showtime's 3 A.M.!

158
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:18,036
But wait--there's more!

159
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:20,038
Once the demon chi is mine,

160
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,274
the real fun begins!

161
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,276
Jackie: A trip
to mooseworld is fun.

162
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:27,279
What you have in mind is...
Probably not fun!

163
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:29,014
Uh...Whatever it is.

164
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:34,352
Drago: Oh, don't be such
a party pooper, chan.

165
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:37,355
See, this world of yours
is a real yawn,

166
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,357
and you know why?
No demons.

167
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:40,959
They're all stuck down under

168
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:44,029
while you humans run around
like you own the place!

169
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,031
Is that fair? No!

170
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:50,268
Well, guess what!
Planet's about to come
under new management!

171
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,537
And my first order
of business will be

172
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,874
to turn this world inside out!

173
00:07:55,876 --> 00:08:00,679
Just imagine...
A population of demons
running amok

174
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:04,249
with me, drago,
pulling the strings!

175
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:09,955
Hah hah hah hah hah hah
hah hah hah hah hah hah!

176
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:18,430
Hah hah hah hah hah hah
hah hah hah hah hah hah!

177
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:22,133
Yeah, pretty soon now
it's good-bye, humanity,

178
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,236
hello, demonville!

179
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:26,705
Daddy would be so proud.

180
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,807
Come on, gang,
gimme some props.

181
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:32,410
Uncle: Bah! Dopey demon
will not succeed.

182
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:35,514
Drago: Oh? And why's that,
grandpa?

183
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,249
Jackie: Because
we are going to

184
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,417
stop yo-ou-ou-ou!

185
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,165
Drago: Catch!

186
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,400
Jackie: Uncle!

187
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,981
Black: Jackie.

188
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,350
I think those chains
need a lube job.

189
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,562
Jackie: Ha! The oily bird
always catches the worm.

190
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:26,097
Drago: Yeah? Well, today's
oily bird special

191
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,066
is some free body work!

192
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,444
(Metal crashes)

193
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,985
Strikemaster ice:
Goin' somewhere?

194
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,690
Jackie, tiny voice:
Bad day.

195
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,296
Mc cobra: Ha ha.
- Hope you like your new digs!

196
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,801
Drago: I told you
to stay nearby.

197
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,469
They nearly escaped!

198
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:08,273
Strikemaster ice:
Yeah, dawg, we noticed.
Too much for ya, huh?

199
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,810
Drago: I wouldn't take
that tone with me
if I were you.

200
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:14,212
Oh!

201
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:16,648
Strikemaster ice:
You ain't the big cheese
no more, d.

202
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,850
Me and my posse
got <i> mad</i> powers!

203
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,619
You got zip.

204
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,922
Drago: Yes, well,
that's about to change.

205
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:28,627
And when it does,
I won't forget
our little chat.

206
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,564
Tohru: It is ready!

207
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:36,267
Jade: The spell?
Tohru: Uh, no. My tea.

208
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,370
It helps me to concentrate.

209
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:40,472
I am still working
on the spell.

210
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:43,008
Jade: No pressure, big guy,
but clock's ticking.

211
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,477
Ready?

212
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,878
Tohru: No. Soon.

213
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,081
Jade: We good to go?

214
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,583
Tohru: Not yet.

215
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:53,985
Jade: Ready?

216
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,787
Tohru: Yes!
Jade: Yes!

217
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,188
Tohru: And...No.

218
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,323
Jade: Translation?

219
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,525
Tohru: I believe
the spell could work,

220
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,927
but we are missing
a key ingredient.

221
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,530
Jade: Name it! I'll make
a run to the 24/7 store.

222
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,932
Tohru: It requires
an essence of drago,

223
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:11,302
something physical
such as a piece of hair

224
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,204
or a fingernail.

225
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,540
Jade: You mean like
a DNA sample?

226
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,909
Tohru: Yes. I have failed.

227
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:21,680
Jade: Hold up. In school
we learned that relatives
share DNA.

228
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:24,382
So something from a member
of drago's family
could work, too!

229
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,518
Tohru: Perhaps.
But what good--

230
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,353
shendu!

231
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,523
Jade: Dear old dad,
in lockup in section 13,

232
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,359
right next door
to the containment unit.

233
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,561
Tohru: He is encased
in stone.

234
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:39,564
Jade: Yeah, well, then guess
we'll have to take a chip
off the old block.

235
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:40,632
Let's move!

236
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,650
(Shendu rasping)

237
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,485
Jade: Aah!

238
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,857
Jade: You're not
scaring me.

239
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,026
You're stuck in stone
and can't do a thing!

240
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,630
Shendu: Why so nervous?

241
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:17,302
As you say,
I am powerless
in my current form.

242
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:21,039
Yet see how the very
elements of your
earthly realm

243
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,508
shatter in my presence!

244
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,610
Jade: Yeah. Ok. Whatever.

245
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:27,712
Great special effects...Not!

246
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:30,648
Shendu: I know
why you are here.

247
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,883
Jade: No way.

248
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:35,687
Shendu: My ungrateful
traitor of a son, drago!

249
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:40,258
He is close
to gaining possession
of the demon powers.

250
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,961
Jade: But it's not
gonna happen, not on my watch!

251
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,463
Shendu: Foolish child!

252
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:49,234
There is but one
power on earth
that can defeat drago,

253
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,936
and it is I, his father.

254
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,439
Jade: We're on the same page,
rocky road.

255
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,907
Shendu: What do you think
you're--

256
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:58,109
Jade: Just a trim.
You'll never miss it.

257
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,446
Thanks. don't get up.
I'll let myself out.

258
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,315
Shendu, in fury: Aaahh!

259
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,086
Tohru: It is nearly 3:00.
Did you--

260
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,888
Jade: Piece of cake!
Come on!

261
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,524
We have a date with a demon
to get to!

262
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:13,925
(Tohru grunts)

263
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,730
Uncle: Eyaaah!
It is almost 3:00!

264
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:21,566
Do something, Jackie!

265
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,168
Jackie, grunting:
Oh!

266
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,869
I am trying, uncle!

267
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:25,937
(Grunts)

268
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:27,105
Ow!

269
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,506
Uncle: Trying not helping.

270
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,875
Doing would be helping.

271
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,311
Black: I'm sure Jade
wouldn't be so foolish

272
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,748
as to actually deliver
the containment unit
to drago.

273
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:41,286
Jackie: To protect us,
I fear Jade might do
anything.

274
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,788
Uncle: Only one opportunity
to stop drago

275
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,391
if he obtains
all demon powers.

276
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:49,394
Uncle needs to have
chi-o-matic,

277
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,996
make a few adjustments.

278
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,098
(Growls from ice and crew)

279
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,466
Black: Jackie,
what if we break huddle,
throw ourselves at the line,

280
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:58,269
and allow uncle
to make an end run?

281
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,271
Not a football fan. Got it.

282
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:03,708
Uncle: He means you should
create diversion!

283
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,743
Jackie: Oh! Yes.

284
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,416
Strikemaster ice:
Yo, these fools be
getting all silly!

285
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,494
Strikemaster ice: Dudes
tried to bust a move. As if.

286
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:24,963
Drago: Where's the geezer?

287
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,965
Strikemaster ice:
Oh. Ain't no thing.

288
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,967
Gotta be around here
somewhere.

289
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:33,271
Drago: Idiot! Just wrap them
up and get them in the truck.

290
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,040
Strikemaster ice:
- What's the magic word, dawg?

291
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,878
Jade: Ok, t, you hang
in the shadows.

292
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,948
Soon as drago shows,
you blast him with
that voodoo that you do.

293
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,950
Tohru: We must time it
precisely.

294
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,485
The spell may only
be activated

295
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:50,455
at the exact
moment drago begins
to absorb the chi.

296
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:51,723
Jade: Roger that.

297
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,563
The demon has landed.

298
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,068
Drago: Show me the chi!

299
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,570
Jade: Show me the chan clan!

300
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:15,113
Drago: I told you slackers
to stay in the truck.

301
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,115
Strikemaster ice:
Yeah, well us slackers

302
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,450
kinda changed our minds
about how it's gonna go down.

303
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,119
Drago: Oh?

304
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:24,522
Mc cobra: Figured
why let <i> you</i> get
all the powers?

305
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,491
Drago: You...
Want some of them?

306
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:30,161
Strikemaster ice:
No, dawg. We want <i> all</i> of them!

307
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,335
Drago: I may not have fire,

308
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:40,238
but you're still toast!

309
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,273
Tohru: Oh, this was not
part of the plan!

310
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,374
Jade: No kidding.

311
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:44,909
(Crew making attack cries)

312
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,311
(Drago grunts)

313
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,396
Tohru: This is not good.
The spell!

314
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:08,566
Jade: I know.
It'll only work
if drago grabs the chi!

315
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,201
Never thought
I'd say this, but...

316
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:11,636
Come on, drago,
you're the man!

317
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:14,072
If you can't do it,
no one can!

318
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:16,107
Jackie: The keys are still
in the ignition.

319
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,611
Jade: Drago won! Yes!

320
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,847
¶ Go, demon,
he's a winner,
oh, yeah-- ¶

321
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,856
strikemaster ice:
Too bad. Dude
hates the water.

322
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,794
Jade: Hey, no Jackie,
no containment unit.

323
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,663
We had a deal.

324
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:43,067
Mc cobra: Yeah? Well,
my man dj fist's
got the deal-breaker.

325
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,636
Jade: Look out!
Tohru: No!

326
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:49,640
Oh...Uh...

327
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,376
Strikemaster ice:
8 powers, 3 of us...

328
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:55,380
Let's see, we gotta
divide that by 8 by 3--

329
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:58,516
uh, carry the--
naw, see we--wait. Naw.

330
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,619
Mc cobra: 2 of us gets 3.
One of us gets 2.

331
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,322
Strikemaster ice:
Ok, here's the dilly-o.

332
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,124
Dj, you get earth and moon.

333
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:09,627
See, 'cause those are
the 2 best powers, yo.

334
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:11,629
I'm doin' you a solid here.

335
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,264
(Fist growls)

336
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,769
Jade and tohru: Bad day.

337
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:24,976
Jackie: Can't see!

338
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:28,746
Mc cobra: Hoo hoo!
Yeah! Feel the burn!

339
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,648
Strikemaster ice:
Look out, San Fran,

340
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,683
'cause we're gonna
turn this sucker out, yo!

341
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,419
Jackie: No, you are not!

342
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,655
Black: Jackie,
you can't take them on.

343
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,123
No arms, no legs.

344
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,658
Jackie: No problem.

345
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,660
It is simply
a matter of...

346
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:43,995
Balance.

347
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,699
Mc cobra: Ooh!
Here comes the cavalry.

348
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,069
Lemme water their horses.

349
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,671
Tohru and Jade: Whoa!

350
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:57,742
(The crew laughs)

351
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,645
Strikemaster ice:
What are you gonna do,
bite us?

352
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:03,314
Mc cobra: Let's school
the fool. Check it out, yo!

353
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,149
Thunder and lightning!

354
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,687
Jackie: Is that...
The best you can do?

355
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:12,056
Strikemaster ice: Naw.
We just gettin' started, yo.

356
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,891
Power of the wind, yo!

357
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:17,695
(Jackie mumbling)

358
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,630
I am still standing.

359
00:18:19,632 --> 00:18:20,765
Ow.

360
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,700
Strikemaster ice:
Yo, let's finish this.

361
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:25,269
We got a whole world
out there to
cruise and bruise!

362
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,805
Yo. Somebody
call a cab?

363
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,910
Uncle: <i> Yo mo guai guey</i>
à <i> fi Dee tsao...</i>

364
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,079
Mc cobra: Hey, the geezer's
got that chi-suckin' gizmo!

365
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,481
Jade: Uncle! Yes!

366
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,783
Tohru: Sensei must have
adjusted the chi-o-matic,

367
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,786
allowing it to absorb
all the demon-chi at once!

368
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,921
Uncle: <i> Yo mo guai guey</i>
à <i> fi Dee tsao...</i>

369
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:46,257
<i>Yo mo guai guey</i>
à <i> fi Dee tsao!</i>

370
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:52,630
Eyaaah! Something rotten
in Denmark!

371
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,668
Drago: <i> Ya gaa mee mo,</i>
à <i> ya gaa mee chi-wah.</i>

372
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,838
<i>Ya gaa mee mo,</i>
à <i> ya gaa mee chi-wah.</i>

373
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,641
Jackie: Drago is drawing
the powers to himself!

374
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,376
How can he do that, uncle?

375
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:09,147
Uncle: Do not know.
Never heard that spell before.

376
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,982
Yes, keep change!

377
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:14,552
Jade: Whoa! Drago must have
been taking night classes.
Got a new spell.

378
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,621
New spell! Do yours--now!

379
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:19,423
Drago: <i> Ya gaa mee mo,</i>
à <i> ya gaa mee chi-wah.</i>

380
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:22,560
Tohru: <i> Mee tahna...Chi!</i>
À <i> chi-mee tahna...Chi!</i>

381
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:23,794
Oh!

382
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:25,563
Uncle: Eeaaah!

383
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:30,134
Drago: Finally,
all the demon powers--
mine!

384
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,406
Strikemaster ice: Uh, yo,
we helped,
d. don't forget that.

385
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:39,010
Drago: Take a last look
at this world of yours,
humans!

386
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,779
Because I'm about to turn it
topsy-turvy

387
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:44,415
and all kinds of curvy!

388
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,918
But first things first...

389
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,254
<i>Ya gaa mee mo,</i>
à <i> ya gaa mee chi-wah.</i>

390
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:53,457
<i>Ya gaa mee mo,</i>
- à <i> ya gaa mee chi-wah.</i>

391
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:55,760
<i>Ya gaa mee mo,</i>
à <i> ya gaa mee chi-wah.</i>

392
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,871
Jade: Hey Jackie, what's the
most embarassing thing that's
ever happened to you?

393
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,172
Oh, I remember.

394
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:11,209
There was almost
20-some years ago.

395
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:15,613
I was doing a difficult shot.
I was doing the hacky-sack,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

396
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,415
So many takes.

397
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:18,849
And sweating.

398
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:21,452
After the shot, I want to
go in the cold water.

399
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:24,655
I take off my shirt.
I try to take off my pants,

400
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,791
but my pants stick
with my underwear.

401
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:28,859
Underwear is gone.

402
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,561
That's the most
embarrassing.
