1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,660
- Ingrid... I miss you.
- You look like a slut.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,460
- How are Ingrid and Sara doing?
- Why do you have to interrogate me all the time?

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,260
Stop walking around like a fucking cliché.

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,780
I trust you 100%.

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,820
Chris hooked up with someone at the Halloween
party, his girlfriend found out and went psycho!

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,730
SHAME

7
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,020
SATURDAY, 11:32 A.M.

8
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,110
To Jonas:

9
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,390
ANSWER!

10
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,360
Have you talked to him?

11
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,810
Yes.

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,360
What did he say?

13
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,100
Isak!

14
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,940
Let's sit down.

15
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,110
He's...

16
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,920
He's not very happy.

17
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,660
But... he has to talk to me.
He has to let me explain.

18
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,060
Maybe he just needs some space,
or something.

19
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,930
How did he find out about it?

20
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,080
The entire school is talking about it.

21
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,860
Yeah, but how did he find out?

22
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,730
Elias...

23
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,620
- And then he just believed it?
- But it's true.

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,640
But...

25
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,210
I don't understand how he can believe a rumor
without talking to me first?

26
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,840
He said he should've figured it out earlier.

27
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,020
You...

28
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,360
You've been acting a little random lately.

29
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,300
Maybe it just made sense.

30
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,520
From Jonas:

31
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,920
Don't think we should talk now

32
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,220
Is it Jonas?

33
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,490
To Jonas:

34
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,880
You have to let me explain!!!

35
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,170
From Jonas:

36
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:40,530
If I see you now, I'm going to say things
I'll regret so I suggest that I'll call you
when I'm ready to hear your explanation
for why you chose to fuck up
everything that's good between us

37
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,480
It'll be okay.

38
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,950
It'll be okay.

39
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,390
MONDAY, 11:58 A.M.

40
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,960
- How are you doing?
- I'm fine.

41
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:20,840
I thought about you all weekend, and if I were in
your situation, I would have been really upset.

42
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,300
I've been asking around, and Ulla in 2STE says
that it was the boyfriend who told her.

43
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,170
Chris told her himself?

44
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,180
One more thing. Quite a lot of people are saying
you're slutty now.

45
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,700
Vilde!

46
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,380
I'm just telling the truth.

47
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,710
Rumor has it the Rad girls
have blacklisted you.

48
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,970
- What does that mean?
- I'm not really sure, but

49
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,330
Tiril from 2STE was blacklisted last year.

50
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,710
- They cut off her hair.
- Hello?!

51
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,260
I'm just telling you what I've heard!

52
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,010
Good job, Eva!

53
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,640
Excuse me?!

54
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,690
Excuse you for what?

55
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,020
You seem like really charming girls.

56
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,110
Oh, how sweet!

57
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,980
Defending your friend like that.

58
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,430
It seems like you have a very close relationship.

59
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,940
I'm sure you'll keep having that.
Until she pisses on your entire life.

60
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,180
Then I don't think you'll be
so damn charming anymore.

61
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,740
What did she mean by that?

62
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,050
Did you and Ingrid used to be friends?

63
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,380
It was a long time ago.

64
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,060
What did she mean by

65
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,550
- "pissing on your entire life"?
- I don't know!

66
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,500
- There must have been something?
- I'm sure she said it to create drama, okay?

67
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,380
Okay.

68
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,210
TUESDAY, 4:29 P.M.

69
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,030
But how long do you
think it will be
until he wants to talk to me?

70
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,390
From Isak:

71
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,900
I don't know, Eva

72
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,970
But is he still mad at me,
what's he saying?

73
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,560
From Isak:

74
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:13,990
He hasn't talked about you

75
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,820
- What are you doing here?
- What do you think?

76
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,520
I came home because I got a call from school
that you had been in a fight!

77
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,220
- That's why I came home.
- You could've spared yourself.

78
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:37,160
No, I couldn't. I found a letter saying you won't
receive a passing grade in math for Christmas.

79
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,380
Christmas grades don't count.

80
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,980
- What's going on?
- Nothing's going on. Some girls who attacked me.

81
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,260
- Just like that? Unprovoked? 
- Yes.

82
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,860
- What kind of girls were they?
- Some cunts from the second year, okay?

83
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,540
- Eva!
- Mom!

84
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,680
- I can't deal with this conversation.
- You have to! We have to talk about--

85
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,900
No! We actually don't have to.

86
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,200
You can't be gone all year,
and then suddenly start meddling in my life.

87
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,660
- Eva!
- It doesn't work like that.

88
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,250
I just want to help!

89
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,210
If you want to help me...

90
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,970
then stop yelling at me!

91
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,480
The entire school hates me,
and Jonas wants to break up,

92
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,520
so the last thing I need now
is for you to come home and bitch at me!

93
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,420
Jonas?

94
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,340
Are you dating Jonas? I mean Jonas Jonas?

95
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,100
- But Jonas is--
- Mom! I know who Jonas is.

96
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,670
You don't need to tell me.

97
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,910
WEDNESDAY, 2:28 P.M.

98
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,060
Don't you think Vilde is really...

99
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,380
like far out? She's just floating on a pink cloud
with all this russ stuff.

100
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,590
Russ time is her life.

101
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,900
But it's like three years left,
and I just don't get what the big deal is.

102
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,120
But...

103
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,450
it's kind of nice though. It's...

104
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,540
He still hasn't called?

105
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:14,420
But... you know you don't have to wait
until he is ready to talk, right?

106
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,940
You have the right to explain yourself.

107
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,580
You know what always gets me in a better mood?

108
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,260
Okay, promise you won't hold it against me?

109
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:37,020
- Yes.
- Seriously, you can't tell anyone.

110
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,460
This is between us.

111
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,120
If this song doesn't put you
in a better mood, then...

112
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,540
♪ Oh, whoa... ♪

Justin Bieber?

120
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,100
Cool...

121
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,000
It's not something I usually listen to, but...

122
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,170
yeah, it was because... or, yeah... whatever.

123
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,560
I don't need to explain myself to you, anyway.

124
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,700
What is it? Did you want something?

125
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,900
Want to go to my place to do homework?

126
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,220
- Excuse me, Willhelm.
- William.

127
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,140
Well...

128
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,780
That pretty much answers your question,
don't you think?

129
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,960
- What?
- I don't even know your name.

130
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,740
Doesn't matter to me, call me what you want.

131
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,940
Yeah, but then...

132
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,270
then I choose to call you "asshole".

133
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,020
- You think that was funny?
- Are you coming?

134
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,340
I thought my answer was pretty clear, but...

135
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,340
No.

136
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,060
Let me know when you change your mind.

137
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,740
Yeah, you just go home and wait for that.

138
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,080
Who does he think he is?!

139
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,960
- Why did you call him Willhelm?
- Huh?

140
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,160
You called him Willhelm,
but you know it's "William".

141
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,420
Oh, yeah,
that was a suppression technique.

142
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,810
Okay?

143
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,220
I saw it on Suits once.

144
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,660
- I've always wanted to use it.
- Wow.

145
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,220
- Impressed?
- Mostly surprised.

146
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,700
Both that you watch Suits,
and listen to Justin Bieber.

147
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,940
Was that a little joke?

148
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,660
You made a joke, Eva!
That's a good sign! That's good.

149
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,540
We like that.

150
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,240
From Vilde:

151
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,600
I'm calling an extraordinary
russ bus meeting tomorrow
at 3 p.m. Important that
everyone shows up.

152
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,620
Extraordinary bus meeting?

153
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:01,780
It's funny she's calling it "extraordinary", 
since we have so many ordinary bus meetings.

154
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,300
THURSDAY, 3:01 P.M.

155
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:09,060
- The toilet paper, Sana, is that taken care of?
- Mmm.

156
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:15,020
- And the money? Has Vilde received the money?
- She got the money--

157
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:24,650
Will this extraordinary meeting take a long time?
Because I have other things to do.

158
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,340
I'll go straight to the point.

159
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,620
As everyone knows, Eva had an
unlucky incident at the Halloween party.

160
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,620
Quite a lot of people are upset with her.
The Rad bus group has blacklisted her.

161
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,480
Vilde...

162
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,090
I got a pretty unpleasant phone call
from the Rad girls yesterday.

163
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:46,250
They're saying that as long as Eva is on our bus,
we are all blacklisted.

164
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,060
- Huh?!
- Don't laugh, it's actually pretty serious!

165
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,980
Last year a bus was blacklisted,
and someone destroyed their brakes.

166
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,020
All of them could have died.

167
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,980
We don't even have a bus.

168
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:03,350
No, but they can do other things.
Cutting our hair, or... throw us in the water.

169
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,820
- I know of several girls that went too far.
- Yeah, they can just try.

170
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,160
We have to talk about this.

171
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:15,170
It's unfair that all of us will become unpopular
because of Eva being slutty.

172
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,400
It's interesting that you
who describe yourself as a feminist...

173
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,690
are calling other girls slutty.

174
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,080
I think Penetrator Chris
is slutty as well.

175
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,890
It's unfair that he doesn't get
the same reputation.

176
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,900
But it's not my fault that's the way things are.

177
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,420
Chris doesn't get that reputation, because
guys don't go around calling other guys sluts.

178
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,640
So if you think it's unfair, then you have to
stop calling girls sluts. It's not hard--

179
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,700
Don't yell at me! I'm not even done talking.

180
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:54,540
It's not just the thing with Chris
that makes Eva slutty. There's more to it.

181
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,550
This isn't the first time
Eva has ruined a relationship.

182
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,040
Vilde...

183
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,530
That's between me and Ingrid.

184
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,990
It's actually not that simple, Eva.

185
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,270
Because Ingrid told
Iben and the Rad girls.

186
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,900
And what you did
affects all of us girls.

187
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,820
What are we talking about?

188
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,940
Eva used to be best friends with Ingrid
from the Pepsi Max girls.

189
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,690
In the 9th grade, Ingrid got a boyfriend.

190
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,700
She was really in love with him, and they were
the cutest couple in the entire school.

191
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,940
Everyone thought they
were perfect for each other.

192
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,760
Even their parents thought
they would get married.

193
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,850
But just before summer, in the 10th grade...

194
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,660
he started to behave strangely. He became
dismissive and stopped replying to her texts.

195
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,620
Ingrid, of course, got really sad.

196
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,620
Eva was there for her, comforted her,

197
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,500
and pretended like she had no idea.

198
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,300
Even though she knew
why he was acting so strange.

199
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,580
Because Eva was seeing him behind Ingrid's back.

200
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,130
Jonas, was his name.

201
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,640
Jonas and Ingrid used to be a couple.

202
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,380
So I think Eva only has herself to blame
for being in this situation.

203
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,180
Because it's pretty messed up
to steal your best friend's boyfriend.

204
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,170
You can't steal anyone.

205
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,370
Do you want a friend who
hits on your boyfriend?

206
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,920
Rather that, than a friend who calls
girls sluts and judges them based on rumors.

207
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,680
It's not a rumor, it's true.
Just ask Eva.

208
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,460
I don't understand why you're attacking Eva,
when the Rad girls are the enemy.

209
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,760
They can try. We'll just get back at them.

210
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,520
That might be the way it works

211
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,240
in your Muslim gangster world,
but for us, it doesn't work like that.

212
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,720
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I can't be bothered to listen to this.

213
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:49,460
You're completely psycho.
You threw water in Ingrid's face.

214
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,160
You're crazy!

215
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,730
I threw water in Ingrid's face,

216
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:05,100
because she and her friends called you a slut
for hooking up with William.

217
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,330
Because for me, in my "Muslim gangster world",

218
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,110
that's how it works.
You don't judge your friends...

219
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,180
and you stand up for them, no matter what.

220
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,800
For once it would have been really nice
if you could have defended me, Chris!

221
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,670
FRIDAY, 2:33 P.M.

222
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,830
Okay, Eva. Let's hear it.

223
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,510
I just want you to know,

224
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,390
I didn't hook up with Chris
because I liked him.

225
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,590
I have never liked him.

226
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,770
I just did it because I thought
you and Ingrid had been hooking up.

227
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,720
That's your explanation?

228
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,090
Ironic.

229
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:05,020
I've taken so much crap from you
because you thought I was messing with Ingrid.

230
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:11,550
But... then it was actually you who cheated.
And lied about it.

231
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:15,070
- And I had to find out through Elias?!
- But...

232
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,390
It was you who lied to me first.

233
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,760
You said you hadn't been with Ingrid,
but you had.

234
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:26,410
And... I only hooked up with Chris
because I was hurt.

235
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,510
It never would've happened
if you hadn't lied to me first.

236
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,490
- Okay... so it's my fault?
- No!

237
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,050
That's not what I meant.

238
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,110
I'm just trying to explain
why I did what I did.

239
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,180
I fucked up, okay?

240
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,900
I'm sorry.

241
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,960
I wish I'd never done it. Really.

242
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,130
I'm sorry.

243
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,510
Jonas...

244
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,990
I love you.

245
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,230
You're saying you hooked up
 with Christoffer,

246
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,970
just because you thought
I was with Ingrid.

247
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:28,430
Why did you have to cheat
just because you thought I was?

248
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,230
I'm sorry.

249
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,720
Eva, it's actually not about
you cheating or lying.

250
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,540
It's about me not understanding who you are.

251
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,750
When we were in middle school,
and you, Sara, and Ingrid were best friends...

252
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,980
and I was with Ingrid...

253
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,490
you suddenly found that exciting,
and wanted to be with me.

254
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,650
But now that you've got new friends...

255
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,070
and they are into third-year guys,

256
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,840
then you suddenly
want to be with them all the time.

257
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,700
That's what I don't understand.

258
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,840
You just follow
what everyone else finds exciting.

259
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,650
You don't have your own opinions.

260
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,250
Because...

261
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,510
what do you like, really?

262
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,120
Who are you?

263
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,420
Call me when you've figured that out.
