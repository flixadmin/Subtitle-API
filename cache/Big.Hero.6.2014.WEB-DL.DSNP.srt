That's a whole lot
of tungsten carbide.

168
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,640
400 pounds of it!

169
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,960
Come here,
come here, come here.

170
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,720
You're going to love this.

171
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,000
A dash of perchloric acid,
a smidge of cobalt,

172
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,680
a hint of hydrogen peroxide,

173
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,320
super-heated to 500 Kelvin,
and...

174
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,800
Ta-da! It's pretty great, huh?

175
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,320
It's so pink.

176
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,240

181

"Honey Lemon"?
"Go Go"? "Wasabi"?

182
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,000

one time, people.

with the nicknames.

185
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,360

188

This is not
my real face and body.

189
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,440
The name's Fred.

190
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,520
School mascot by day,
but by night...

So, what's your major?

194
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,680
No, no, no, I'm not a student.

195
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,880
But I am a major science enthusiast.

196
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,080
I've been trying to get
Honey to develop a formula,

197
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,200
that can turn me into a
fire-breathing lizard at will.

198
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,640
But she's says that's "not science."

199
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
It's really not.

200
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,600
Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray

201
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,560
I asked Wasabi for isn't "science" either.

202
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,760
-Is it?
-Nope.

203

206
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,000

207

HONEY LEMON: What?

208
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,240
FRED: Tingly fingers?
WASABI: Never gonna happen.

209
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,440
FRED: Hey, what about
a growth serum, huh?

210
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,560
So, uh, what have
you been working on?

211
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,880
I'll show you.

212

Your personal
healthcare companion.

222
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,640
I was alerted to the need

223
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,120
for medical attention
when you said, "Ow."

On a scale of 1 to 10,
how would you rate your pain?

226
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,440
Physical or emotional?

227
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,800
I will scan you now.

230
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,840
You have a slight epidermal
abrasion on your forearm.

231
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,560
I suggest
an anti-bacterial spray.

232
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

233
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,200
What's in the spray, specifically?

234
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,320
The primary ingredient is bacitracin.

235
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,640
(CLICKS TONGUE)
That's a bummer.

236
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,960
I'm actually allergic to that.

237
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,040
You are not allergic to bacitracin.

238
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,360
You do have a mild allergy to

239
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
peanuts.

240
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,320
Hmm. Not bad.

241

You've done some serious
coding on this thing, huh?

Uh-huh. Programmed him with
over 10,000 medical procedures.

243

This chip is what
makes Baymax, Baymax.

245
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,920
Yeah, going for a non-threatening,
huggable kind of thing.

246
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,160
Looks like
a walking marshmallow.

-BAYMAX: I am a robot.

Right. Even lighter. (GASPS)

254

Where did you get those?

right here, in-house.

He's going to help
a lot of people.

264
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,720
Hey, what kind of battery
does it use?

265
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
Lithium ion.

266
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,720
You know, supercapacitors
would charge way faster.

267

his career in bot-fighting.

291

Well, kind of serious.

00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,600
It's like spooning a warm marshmallow.

990
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,440
Hmm, it's so nice.

991
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,320
Oh, yeah, ah, that's toasty.

992
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,680
(YAWNS)

993
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,080
Good robot.

994
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,880
Does this symbol
mean anything to you guys?

995
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,080
-Yes! It's a bird!
-No!

996
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,200
The guy in the mask
was carrying something

997
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,520
with this symbol on it.

998
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,880
Apprehending the man in the mask
will improve Hiro's emotional state.

999
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,600
Apprehend him?

1000
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,120
We don't even know who he is.

1001
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,880
I have a theory.

1002
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,960
WASABI: "Dr Slaughter, MD"?

1003
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,160
Actually,
millionaire weapons designer,

1004
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,640
Malcolm Chazzletick.

1005
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,200
"The Annihilator"?

1006
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,920
Behind the mask,
industrialist Reid Axworthy.

1007
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,120
"Baron von Destruct"?
Oh, just get to the point!

1008
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:58,480
Don't you guys get it?

1009
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,920
The man in the mask who attacked us

1010
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,480
is none other than...

1011
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,240
<i>Voilà!</i>

1012
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,480
Alistair Krei.

1013
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,200
-What?
-FRED: Think about it.

1014
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,640
Krei wanted your microbots,

1015
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,800
and you said no.

1016
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,440
But rules don't apply to a man like Krei.

1017
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,480
HIRO: There's no way.
The guy is too high profile.

1018
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,520
Then who was that guy in the mask?

1019
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,320
(STAMMERING) I don't know.

1020
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,520
We don't know anything about him.

1021
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,000
BAYMAX:
His blood type is AB-negative.

1022
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,520
Cholesterol levels are...

1023
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,840
Baymax, you scanned him?

1024
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,920
I am programmed to assess
everyone's healthcare needs.

1025
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,520
Yes! (LAUGHS)

1026
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,040
I can use the data
from your scan to find him.

1027
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,840
Uh, you'd have to scan
everyone in San Fransokyo.

1028
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,000
That might take, I don't know, forever.

1029
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,640
No, no, no, no. I...

1030
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,880
I just have to look for another angle.

1031
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,520
Got it!

1032
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,720
I'll scan the whole city at the same time.

1033
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,240
I just have to upgrade Baymax's sensor.

1034
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,160
Actually, if we're gonna catch this guy,

1035
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,720
I need to upgrade all of you.

1036
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,040
Upgrade who, now?

1037
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,760
Those who suffer a loss require support

1038
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,680
from friends and loved ones.

1039
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,240
(LAUGHS) Oh, okay,
I like where this is heading!

1040
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,920
We can't go against that guy!
We're nerds!

1041

1042

but we're just us.

1043
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:13,960
No.

1044
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,360
You can be way more.

1045
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,840

Can you feel it?
You guys, do you feel this?

1048
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,640
Our origin story begins.

00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,440
The neurotransmitter
must be in his mask.

We get the mask,
and he can't control the bots.
