167
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,747
[thunder rumbling]

168
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,624
You're not my slave, Chas.

169
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,044
You're my very appreciated apprentice.

170
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,421
Like Tonto or Robin.

171
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,050
Or that skinny fellow
with the fat friend.

172
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:21,179
Right. So then why don't I apprentice
something besides driving, then, John?

173
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:25,767
John? John.

174
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,812
I love our little talks, John.

175
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,203
May I take your coat, Mr. Constantine?

176
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:48,123
No, thanks,
I'm not gonna be staying long.

177
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:52,168
-[attendant] How about you, ma'am?
-Oh, no, I'm not staying long either.

178
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,505
I really need to speak with him.
It's very important.

179
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,882
First come, first served.

180
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:03,638
Oh. So you're rude
no matter where you are.

181
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,024
-Father.
-[Garret] Hi.

182
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,611
-You have news.
-[Garret] Yes, I spoke with the bishop.

183
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:19,529
[Angela] Yes.

184
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,662
I know what you want, son.

185
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:31,207
Still keeping your all-seeing eye
on me, Gabriel?

186
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:34,878
I'm flattered.

187
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,048
Well, I could offer something

188
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:42,594
about how a shepherd leads
even the most wayward of his flock,

189
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,597
but it might sound disingenuous.

190
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,433
She has to have
a Catholic funeral, Father. She has to.

191
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:51,561
Angela, it's still considered
a mortal sin.

192
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,062
She didn't commit suicide.

193
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,690
The bishop believes otherwise.
You know the rules.

194
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,233
Oh, rules.

195
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,194
Father.

196
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:01,613
David.

197
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,699
This is Isabel.

198
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:08,661
God was the only one
she ever believed loved her.

199
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,247
Please.

200
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,666
I'm sorry.

201
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:20,757
[John] I've been seeing
some unusual soul traffic lately.

202
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,134
You might consider
giving me an extension.

203
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:26,429
I could do your side
some good these days.

204
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,848
You still trying to buy your way
into heaven?

205
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:32,185
What about the minions I've sent back?

206
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:36,439
-That alone should guarantee my entry.
-How many times have I told you?

207
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,275
That's not the way this works.

208
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,528
Why, haven't I served him enough?

209
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:46,074
-What does he want from me?
-Only the usual.

210
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:49,327
Self-sacrifice, belief.

211
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,705
-Oh, I believe, for Christ's sake.
-No, no, you know.

212
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,333
And there's a difference. You've seen.

213
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,627
I never asked to see.

214
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,963
I was born with this curse.

215
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,631
A gift, John.

216
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,801
One that you've squandered
on selfish endeavors.

217
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,303
I'm pulling demons out of little girls.

218
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,014
Who's that for?

219
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:14,310
Everything you've ever done,
you've only ever done for yourself.

220
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,730
To earn your way
back into his good graces.

221
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,608
Impossible rules, endless regulations,

222
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:23,653
who goes up, who goes down and why.

223
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:24,862
[thuds]

224
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,535
You don't even understand us.

225
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:35,164
You're the one who should go
to hell, half-breed.

226
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,345
Why me, Gabriel?

227
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:53,099
It's personal, isn't it?

228
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:58,813
I didn't go to church enough,
I didn't pray enough,

229
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:03,484
I was five bucks short
in the collection plate. Why?

230
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,488
You are going to die young

231
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:12,076
because... you smoked 30 cigarettes
a day since you were 15.

232
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,747
And you're going to go to hell...

233
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,750
because of the life you took.

234
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:25,757
You're fucked.

235
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:34,515
[coughing]

236
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,479
At least it's nice out.

237
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:45,526
He always had a rotten sense of humor.

238
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,619
And his punch lines are killers.

239
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:02,543
[Chas] John!

240
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:05,129
Constantine, it's raining! John!

241
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,006
Hey!

242
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:23,648
[man 1] Twenty-two women were found
buried in the assailant's back yard.

243
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:27,151
<i>So much damage had been done
to the bodies, police had to match...</i>

244
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:29,779
[woman 1] Police report
she had been physically penetrated

245
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,989
over 100 times and buried alive.

246
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:36,577
[man 2] ...found locked in a freezer,
his head severed and his organs...

247
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:38,496
[woman 2]
He stuffed Holly's body into...

248
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:42,834
-[man 2] The bodies ravished...
-[woman 3] He used a small handsaw...

249
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:46,337
[man 3] Had nearly decapitated...
Even his eyes were gouged out.

250
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,922
[male voice] Isabel.

251
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,990
I'm so sorry, lzzy.

252
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,617
Constantine.

253
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:50,151
[phone rings]

254
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:52,028
Dodson.

255
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,322
Hello?

256
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:56,657
Hello.

257
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,660
[phone ringing]

258
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,208
-Hello?
-[phone rings]

259
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,585
[phone rings]

260
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:14,717
[all phones ringing]

261
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:22,391
[thunder rumbling]

262
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:39,492
[bird squawks]

263
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:09,438
[man] Hey. Hey, buddy, got a light?

264
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,445
[beetles screeching]

265
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:43,973
Should've minded
your own business, exorcist.

266
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,516
[demon yelling]

267
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:08,956
I know where you're going, John.

268
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,791
I know where you're going.
You're going to Midnite's.

269
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:13,169
You're supposed to wait in the cab.

270
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,338
It's a haven
for those who rise and fall.

271
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,173
I remember reading about this, John.

272
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,176
-You read too much, kid. It's a bar.
-It's a bar?

273
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,762
It's a bar.
Papa Midnite is a crusader for good.

274
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,555
He swore the oath of neutrality.

275
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:27,266
-John, the man's a legend.
-Yeah.

276
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,936
Can you please get me
into this bar, John, please?

277
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:31,771
I'm begging you, John, please?

278
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:35,149
-Sure, you can get in.
-I can get in?

279
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,734
If you can get in.

280
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,196
If I can get--
It's a bear, though, right?

281
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,989
Or two ducks in a cloud?

282
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:47,703
Two frogs on a bench.

283
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,250
Two frogs on a bench.

284
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,253
No, no, I'm with the guy you just--

285
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:57,713
John! John!

286
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,590
I'm with him, though.

287
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:02,635
Rat in a dress.

288
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:06,555
Of course it is. Rat in a dress.

289
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:09,141
I'm just testing. I'm just testing.

290
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:12,520
Dead as dead can be

291
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:15,272
My doctor tells me

292
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:18,109
[growling]

293
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:21,612
Ever the optimistic one

294
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:28,577
I'm sure of your ability to become

295
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:31,747
My perfect enemy

296
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:37,712
Wake up
And face me

297
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:40,506
Don't play dead

298
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,633
"Cause maybe

299
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:49,223
Someday I will walk away and say

300
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:52,309
You disappoint me

301
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:55,438
Maybe you're better off this way

302
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:04,280
[John] Don't get up.

303
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,284
[Midnite] You've been absent some time.

304
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,412
Have you come here with relics to sell?

305
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,832
No, I'm out of that now.
I've been too busy.

306
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,795
Perhaps peddling forgeries has ended up
being bad for your health.

307
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:21,881
Midnite, Jesus.

308
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:24,759
I thought the thing was authentic.

309
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:29,513
I see now.

310
00:31:30,264 --> 00:31:33,726
Your health is bad for other reasons.
How long?

311
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,561
A few months, maybe a year.

312
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:37,688
I thought I heard thunder last night.

313
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,108
Must have been Satan's stomach growling.

314
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:45,988
You're the one soul
he'd come up here himself to collect.

315
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:47,823
So I've heard.

316
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:51,994
Well, I am most certain
you did not come here

317
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:54,330
for a sympathetic shoulder to cry on.

318
00:31:57,792 --> 00:32:01,378
A demon just attacked me,
right out in the open on Figueroa.

319
00:32:01,462 --> 00:32:02,963
They don't like you, John.

320
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,966
How many have you deported back to hell?

321
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,885
Not some angry half-breed, Midnite.

322
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,638
A full-fledged demon,
here, on our plane.

323
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:13,432
Clearly I do not have to remind you
that is impossible.

324
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:16,060
And yesterday, I saw a soldier demon

325
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:18,521
trying to chew
its way out through a little girl.

326
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:23,025
Listen, John, demons stay in hell,
angels in heaven,

327
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:26,237
the great détente
of the original superpowers.

328
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,658
Thanks for the history lesson, Midnite.
You've been a tremendous help.

329
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,576
Now...

330
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:36,705
I need to use the chair.

331
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:44,505
John, forgetting the fact that
it would almost certainly kill you,

332
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,382
you know I am neutral.

333
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:50,052
And as long as the balance
is maintained, I take no sides.

334
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,764
Before you were a bartender,

335
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:59,103
you were one witch doctor against,
what, 30 Ashgar?

336
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:03,065
-And I--
-You were Constantine.

337
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,860
The John Constantine.

338
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:08,696
Once.

339
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:13,075
This isn't the usual game,
I can feel it.

340
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,494
Something's coming.

341
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:18,372
[man] Ooh, spooky.

342
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:20,666
Balthazar.

343
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:25,462
That expression alone
has made my entire night.

344
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,590
I'll make your night.

345
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:31,260
I'll deport your sorry ass right
where you stand, you half-breed shit!

346
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,598
You know the rules of my house.

347
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,975
While here, you will abide by them.

348
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:39,643
[Balthazar] Johnny boy.

349
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:45,941
Word is you're on your way down.

350
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,360
Fresh meat.

351
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:51,822
[hisses]

352
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,116
Finger-licking good.

353
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:56,869
We have a meeting now, John.

354
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:03,042
[John coughing]

355
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:07,254
What? I didn't catch that.

356
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,007
Welcome to my life.

357
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:58,472
[knocking at door]

358
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:03,852
Mr. Constantine.

359
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,648
-I saw you--
-I remember.

360
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:11,068
-And then I saw you at the--
-Regular kismet.

361
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:16,824
I'd like to ask you a few questions,
if that would be okay.

362
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,201
I'm not really
in the talking mood right now.

363
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,871
Well, maybe you could just listen then.

364
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:24,581
Please?

365
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:30,963
Always a catch.

366
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:47,855
My sister was murdered yesterday.

367
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:50,816
-Sorry to hear.
-Thanks.

368
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:56,947
She was a patient at Ravenscar.
She... jumped off the roof.

369
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:59,408
[John] Thought you said
she was murdered.

370
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,745
[Angela] Yeah, well,
Isabel wouldn't have taken her own life.

371
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:05,789
Yeah, what kind of mental patient
kills herself?

372
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,792
That's just crazy.

373
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:16,717
Look, I've heard your name
around the precinct.

374
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,553
I know the circles you travel in.

375
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:22,389
The occult, demonology, exorcisms.

376
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:26,727
Just before my sister was committed,
she became deeply paranoid.

377
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:31,648
She started talking about
demons, angels.

378
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:34,526
Now, I think someone got to her,
Mr. Constantine.

379
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:38,489
I think they brainwashed her
into stepping off that roof.

380
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:41,909
Some kind of legion or cult.

381
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,412
Sounds like a theory, detective.

382
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:47,831
Good luck.

383
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:52,836
I thought with your background,
you could at least

384
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,505
point me in the right direction.

385
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:56,298
Yeah, okay, sure.

386
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,804
It wasn't a suicide.

387
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:03,972
My sister was a devout Catholic.

388
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,142
Do you understand that?
If she took her own life--

389
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:09,853
Her soul would go straight to hell...

390
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:15,651
where she'd be ripped apart over
and over in screaming, brutal agony

391
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,529
for all eternity. That it?

392
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:20,489
That about right?

393
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,665
Goddamn you.

394
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,921
[door slams]

395
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,636
[rumbling]

396
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:01,864
[John] Detective.

397
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:05,200
What if I told you that God
and the devil made a wager,

398
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:08,871
a kind of standing bet
for the souls of all mankind?

399
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,581
I'd tell you to stay on your meds.

400
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,961
Humor me. No direct contact with humans.
That would be the rule.

401
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:20,507
-Just influence. See who would win.
-Okay, I'm humoring you.

402
00:38:20,591 --> 00:38:22,801
-Why?
-[John] Who knows.

403
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:24,553
Maybe just for the fun of it.
No telling.

404
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,221
Oh, so it's fun.

405
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:28,807
It's fun when a man
beats his wife to death,

406
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:31,226
it's fun when a mother drowns her baby.

407
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,438
And you think the devil is responsible?

408
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,150
People are evil, Mr. Constantine.
People.

409
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,778
You're right.
We're born capable of terrible things.

410
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:44,156
Then sometimes something else
comes along

411
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,616
and gives us just the right nudge.

412
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,493
Well, this has been real educational,

413
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:51,121
but... | don't believe in the devil.

414
00:38:51,205 --> 00:38:53,874
You should. He believes in you.

415
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:15,854
It's a power outage.

416
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:17,981
Not likely.

417
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:22,110
[wings fluttering]

418
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:24,530
-[Angela] What?
-We should go. Now.

419
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:31,537
What is that?

420
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:34,498
Wings.

421
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:37,251
Maybe talons.

422
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:41,213
You're kidding. Of what?

423
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,966
Something that's not
supposed to be here.

424
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:50,556
That's really not going to help.

425
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:58,772
-Close your eyes.
-[Angela] Why?

426
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:00,482
[John] Suit yourself.

427
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:25,007
Demons stay in hell, huh?

428
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:28,844
Tell them that.

429
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,429
[Angela vomiting]

430
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,851
Don't worry.
Happens to everyone the first time.

431
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,061
It's the sulfur.

432
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,814
Sulfur.

433
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,235
What were those things?

434
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,697
Demons.

435
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:55,412
-Scavengers of the damned.
-No, no. It's impossible.

436
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:59,333
Yeah. And I don't think
they were after me.

437
00:41:01,418 --> 00:41:04,546
You really believe
she wouldn't commit suicide.

438
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,048
Isabel?

439
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:08,967
Never in a million years.

440
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:10,594
Well, let's be sure.

441
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:13,305
Let's see if she's in hell.

442
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:30,238
[cat meows]

443
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,791
[Angela] Oh, was it
supposed to be hot or cold?

444
00:41:40,874 --> 00:41:42,334
In front of the chair.

445
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:48,131
[Angela] I can't believe I'm doing this.

446
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:50,425
-These are all Isabel's things?
-Yeah.

447
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,929
-How about the cat?
-Duck?

448
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:55,931
Yeah, why?

449
00:41:57,641 --> 00:41:58,642
Duck.

450
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,061
Oh, you think that's strange.

451
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,313
Cats are good.

452
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:05,065
Half in, half out anyway.

453
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:26,586
If this is some kind of spell
or something,

454
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,923
don't you need candles
and a pentagram for it to work?

455
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:31,383
Why, do you have any?

456
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:34,886
-This is crazy.
-Yes.

457
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:40,684
I need you to leave.

458
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,604
-I'm sorry?
-Angela, please.

Okay.

00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:03,498
Be careful with that cat.

-She killed herself.

[inner voices stop]

491
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:35,325
When I was a kid, I could see things.

492
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:38,828
Things humans aren't supposed to see.

493
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:41,706
Things you shouldn't have to see.

00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:04,437
My parents were normal.
They did what most parents would do.

496
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,065
They made it worse.

497
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:12,612
You think you're crazy long enough,

498
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:14,906
you find a way out.

499
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:18,868
-[Angela] You tried to kill yourself.
-[John] I didn't try anything.

500
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:25,291
Officially, I was dead for two minutes.

501
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:28,878
But when you cross over,

502
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:31,881
time stops.

503
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,136
Take it from me,
two minutes in hell is a lifetime.

504
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:40,848
When I came back,

505
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:44,602
I knew...

506
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:48,147
all the things I could see were real.

507
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:51,609
Heaven and hell are right here.

508
00:51:51,693 --> 00:51:54,529
Behind every wall, every window.

509
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:56,948
The world behind the world,

510
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:58,866
and we're smack in the middle.

511
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:03,496
Angels and demons
can't cross over onto our plane.

512
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:06,582
So, instead,
we get what I call half-breeds.

513
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:09,919
The influence peddlers.

514
00:52:10,003 --> 00:52:15,800
They can only whisper in our ears,
but a single word can give you courage

515
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:19,554
or turn your favorite pleasure
into your worst nightmare.

516
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:22,724
Those with the demon's touch...

517
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:28,229
like those part angel,
living alongside us.

518
00:52:28,313 --> 00:52:29,981
They call it the balance.

519
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:33,568
I call it hypocritical bullshit.

520
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:38,573
So when a half-breed breaks the rules,

521
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:42,118
I deport their sorry ass
straight back to hell.

522
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,538
I don't get them all,

523
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:50,084
but I've been hoping to get enough
to ensure my...

524

-retirement.
-I don't understand.

525
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:58,801
I'm a suicide, Angela.

526
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:02,638
When I die, the rules say
I've got just one place to go.

You're trying to buy your way
into heaven.

528
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:07,602
What would you do
if you were sentenced to a prison

529
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:10,063
where half the inmates
were put there by you?

530
00:53:12,482 --> 00:53:14,984
I guess God has a plan for all of us.

531
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:17,653
God's a kid with an ant farm, lady.

532
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:20,239
He's not planning anything.

533
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:22,492
When we were little,

534
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:26,120
Isabel saw things, too.

537
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,841
[Weiss] Guard spotted him groping
the body, then he ran across the street.

538
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:42,929
Came in here,
and he had a go at the entire stock.

539
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:45,640
He drowned himself in alcohol
in under a minute.

540
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:49,268
Could've been a member of my fraternity.

541
00:53:51,813 --> 00:53:53,940
Hey, what the hell is he doing here?

542
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:55,733
He's okay.

Why didn't you call me,

[Beeman] Yes?

What do you mean?

00:54:48,995 --> 00:54:50,413
What?

How?

00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:01,632
Mm-hmm.

00:55:03,468 --> 00:55:06,137
Got it. Bye.

551
00:55:13,186 --> 00:55:15,313
I need to see where Isabel died.

552
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:19,609
[Angela]
Seances, Ouija boards, channeling.

553
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:23,154
Our father thought
she was just trying to get attention.

554
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,823
She certainly did that.

555
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:29,785
She'd tell everyone about the things
she said she saw.

556
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:33,331
She'd scare my mother half to death.

557
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,628
And then she stopped talking
for almost a year.

558
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:41,047
[John] So you had her committed.

559
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:42,507
[Angela] Yeah.

560
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:43,799
[John] How long?

561
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:45,635
Two weeks.

562
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:48,095
This time.

563
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:51,057
She'd get better,
and then she'd get worse.

564
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,683
Recently, a lot worse.

565
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:59,065
That symbol that was cut
in the dead guy's hand,

566
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:01,526
does it have something to do with this?

567
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:03,986
I'm a cop, John, remember?

568
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,864
You don't walk off
the roof of a building

569
00:56:06,948 --> 00:56:09,450
without leaving something behind.

570
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:14,497
And I showed you everything she left
behind in that box, but feel free.

571
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,207
Maybe she left something else.

572
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:19,043
Not something a cop would find.

573
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,130
Something just for you.

574
00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:26,884
You were her twin, Angela.

575
00:56:26,968 --> 00:56:28,844
Twins tend to think alike.

00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:32,348
-I'm not like my sister.
-But you were once.

577
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:34,392
When you were Kids.

578
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,812
When you'd spend every second
with each other.

579
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,981
You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it.

580
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:41,816
You'd get hurt, she'd cry.

581
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:43,359
That was a long time ago.

582
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:45,528
That kind of bond
doesn't just disappear.

583
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:46,904
There is nothing here.

584
00:56:48,281 --> 00:56:51,492
-Hey. Come on.
-She planned her death in this room.

585
00:56:51,576 --> 00:56:55,079
She thought it up right here.
Right where you're standing.

586
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:58,541
She knew you'd come. She counted
on you to see what she saw,

587
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:01,877
feel what she felt, know what she knew.

588
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:04,839
-What did she do, Angela?
-How should I know?

589
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:07,300
-What did she do, Angela?
-I don't know.

590
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:12,179
-What would you do?
-I don't know.

591
00:57:12,263 --> 00:57:14,890
What did she do, Angela?
You know what she did.

592
00:57:14,974 --> 00:57:16,684
What did she do, Angela?

593
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:19,228
You know what she did.
What are you afraid of?

594
00:57:19,312 --> 00:57:20,438
What did she do, Angela?

595
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:22,690
-What did she do?
-I don't know!

When we were girls...

598
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:47,548
we would leave each other messages.

599
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,386
In light.

600
00:57:55,556 --> 00:57:56,766
In breath.

On the windows.

602
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:10,488
John, there is no
17th act in Corinthians.

603
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:16,410
Corinthians goes to 21 acts
in the Bible in hell.

604
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:20,081
They have Bibles in hell.

605
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:23,167
[John] Paints a different view
of Revelations.

606
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,503
Says the world will not end
by God's hand,

607
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:28,547
but be reborn in the embrace
of the damned.

be exceeded by the sins of the son."

-But he can't cross over, B.

-Impossible to cross over.
-Whose son? God's son?

No, the other one. Devil had a son, too.

[Beeman] Here it is.

This is the sign of Mammon,

Sorry, I'm-I'm sorry, no,
I'm right here.

622
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:17,388
It says Mammon has no patience
for his father's rule

623
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:22,393
and yearns to forge his own kingdom
of fire and blood.

[rattling]

625
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:31,318
Yeah. Mammon would be the last demon

626
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:33,863
we'd ever want crossing over
to our plane.

No, wait, wait, wait. I'm reading.
Seems to be a loophole.

Always a catch.

629
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:46,876

possess a very, very powerful psychic.

-Isabel.
-But that wouldn't be enough.

631
00:59:50,463 --> 00:59:54,884
To cross over,
Mammon would need divine assistance.

632
00:59:56,385 --> 01:00:00,473
To cross over,
Mammon would need the help of God.

650
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:19,028
I used to see things, too.

651
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:21,864
But...

652
01:02:22,865 --> 01:02:26,785
-you already knew that, didn't you?
-Go home, Angela.

653
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:28,537
[Angela] I need to understand.

654
01:02:28,621 --> 01:02:31,123
You don't wanna know
what's out there, trust me.

655
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:33,459
I'm stronger than Isabel.

656
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:35,920
Your sister embraced her gift,
you denied yours.

657
01:02:36,003 --> 01:02:37,546
Denial is a better idea.

658
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:42,426
It's why you're still alive.
Stick with me, that will change.

659
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,470
I don't need another ghost following me.

660
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:46,180
[Angela] John, they killed my sister.

661
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,021
I'd trade places with her if I could.

662
01:02:57,358 --> 01:02:59,860
I used to pretend that I didn't.

663
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:02,154
That I didn't see things.

664
01:03:03,322 --> 01:03:04,657
And...

665
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:09,453
by the time we were ten,
they started forcing her to take...

666
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:12,498
antipsychotics...

667
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:16,627
and have treatments.
They would come for her

668
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:20,506
and she'd look at me,
and she'd say to me, "Tell them."

669
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:24,510
"Why don't you tell them, Angie,
that you can see them, too?"

670
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:27,012
But I lied.

671
01:03:27,763 --> 01:03:29,348
I said,

672
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:32,935
"I don't see anything."

673
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,230
Until one day...

674
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:39,608
I finally stopped seeing.

675
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:43,737
I abandoned her, John.

676
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:47,032
I left her all alone.

677
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:56,417
I need to see what she saw.

678
01:03:59,003 --> 01:04:00,254
Please.

679
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:08,012
You do this, there's no turning back.

680
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:12,016
You see them,

681
01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:15,352

682
01:04:16,562 --> 01:04:17,855
Understand?

683
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:20,524
Yeah.

684
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:28,323
[John] Sure.

[water splashing]

686
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:11,575
So do I have to take the rest of
my clothes off, or can I leave them on?

687
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:19,541
John?

688
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:21,877
I'm thinking.

01:05:26,298 --> 01:05:27,591
John?

690
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:29,927
On is fine.

01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:46,819
-So why water?
-It's a universal conduit.

Lubricates the transition
from one plane to another.

-Now ask me if there's water in hell.

Normally, only a portion of the body
has to be suspended,

but you wanted the crash course.

Yeah, I wanted the crash course.

01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:13,595
So, um...

01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:16,598
So, what's gonna happen?

Lie down.

-What do you mean lie down?
-You have to be fully submerged.

As long as it takes.

Half-breed tipped the scales

You can't cheat it this time.
You're going back to hell.

01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:26,763
You dare? In my house?

815
01:19:29,724 --> 01:19:32,977
Is this neutral? Bullshit.

816
01:19:33,061 --> 01:19:36,064
You're the only one still playing
by the rules, Midnite.

817
01:19:36,147 --> 01:19:39,233
And while you've been imitating
Switzerland, people are dying.

818
01:19:40,485 --> 01:19:44,614
Hennessy, Beeman, they were
your friends once, too, remember?

819
01:19:45,865 --> 01:19:47,784
I need your help!

820
01:19:50,495 --> 01:19:53,081
Consider it a last request.

821
01:19:56,626 --> 01:19:58,836
You play a dangerous game.

822
01:20:03,925 --> 01:20:05,093
[groans]

823
01:20:06,844 --> 01:20:08,846
Two-hundred-dollar shirt, by the way.

824
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:12,725
[Midnite]
That little shit has been trying

825
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:15,103
to climb out of
his father's shadow for eons.

826
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:19,983
I'd hate to think what he would do
to this world if he ever broke through.

827
01:20:23,653 --> 01:20:25,780
[John] Forgot how big it was.

828
01:20:26,531 --> 01:20:27,782
[Midnite] Two hundred souls

829
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:30,994
passed through this wood and steel
at Sing Sing.

830
01:20:31,077 --> 01:20:32,328
[John] Yeah.

831
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:37,500
Which way's east?

832
01:20:55,852 --> 01:20:57,812
[Midnite]
How many years since you've surfed?

833
01:21:00,023 --> 01:21:01,899
Like riding a bike.

834
01:21:01,983 --> 01:21:03,234
No, not really.

835
01:21:06,654 --> 01:21:09,490
Tell me this isn't about the girl.

836
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:14,579
Definitely mostly not about the girl.

837
01:21:21,461 --> 01:21:22,837
[John] Cold.

838
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,380
Little flavor?

839
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:50,573
-Sure about this?
-No.

840
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:25,066
[demonic voice speaking indistinctly]

841
01:22:40,665 --> 01:22:41,791
Midnite!

842
01:22:48,047 --> 01:22:51,217
-Any luck?
-That's a word for it.

843
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:54,971
Holy shit. You're Papa Midnite,
aren't you?

844
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:06,149
And how exactly do you intend
on getting close enough to use these?

845
01:23:09,152 --> 01:23:12,363
[Chas]
Well, they did not leave her unguarded.

846
01:23:12,446 --> 01:23:13,781
Half-breeds are most vulnerable

847
01:23:13,865 --> 01:23:17,368
when their outer skin
is breached by holy water.

848
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:22,456
Certain objects, most notably
either of the two crosses of Isteria

849
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:25,001
have been used by even
the unordained to bless and sanctify

850
01:23:25,084 --> 01:23:27,503
commonly occurring waters, even rain.

851
01:23:29,255 --> 01:23:30,631
Maybe if...

852
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:38,347
There's no use sitting on the bench
if you're not ready to play, right?

853
01:23:39,098 --> 01:23:42,977
So you wouldn't have one of those
enchanted crosses here in a cabinet

854
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:44,896
maybe we could take with us?

855
01:23:44,979 --> 01:23:46,147
Look, John, no offense,

856
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:49,901
I just don't think that
it's a great idea, you know,

857
01:23:49,984 --> 01:23:53,321
you going on a solo mission
to save the world. That's my vote.

858
01:23:53,404 --> 01:23:55,740
I don't know what pops thinks,
but that's...

859
01:23:57,491 --> 01:24:00,494
Take him, John. Kill him after.

860
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:09,921
If you get back,
see me about membership. Maybe.

861
01:24:10,004 --> 01:24:12,006
Okay. I will.

862
01:24:13,132 --> 01:24:16,761
[speaking in Latin]

863
01:24:17,845 --> 01:24:20,097
-What are you doing?
-Praying.

864
01:24:20,181 --> 01:24:22,308
Praying. Okay.

865
01:24:24,018 --> 01:24:25,186
Come on.

866
01:24:29,482 --> 01:24:32,068

[gasps]

868
01:25:22,827 --> 01:25:24,245
[Chas] Half-breeds, right?

869
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:27,915
A birth like this,

870
01:25:27,999 --> 01:25:31,085
they're definitely gonna be
guarding her, right? Definitely.

871
01:25:32,044 --> 01:25:33,045
Yeah.

872
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:41,137
We can get through them. I mean,
that cross has gotta work, right?

873
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:42,471
Right?

874
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:45,308
It's not always like it is in the books.

875
01:26:15,046 --> 01:26:17,506
[demonic voice speaking indistinctly]

876

[demonic voice speaking indistinctly]

877
01:26:34,982 --> 01:26:36,150
[Chas] What is that?

878
01:26:37,068 --> 01:26:38,486
Hellspeak.

879
01:26:41,781 --> 01:26:43,157
You know what to do.

880
01:26:47,078 --> 01:26:48,162
I'm okay.

881
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:51,665
Sure.

882
01:27:04,428 --> 01:27:06,055
One last show.

883
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:41,674
Hi.

884
01:27:43,134 --> 01:27:44,427
My name's John.

885
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:49,265
You are in violation of the balance.

886
01:27:51,058 --> 01:27:52,601
Leave immediately...

887
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:55,020
or I will deport you.

888
01:27:58,232 --> 01:27:59,483
All of you.

889
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:08,826
Go to hell.

890
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:16,542
Holy water?

John.

Angela, what is it?

01:31:55,135 --> 01:31:57,680
[gasping]

904
01:32:02,476 --> 01:32:03,644
Get it out.

01:32:18,492 --> 01:32:19,576
[Angela] Get it out.

[Chas and John speaking in Latin]

910
01:33:06,665 --> 01:33:07,833
Oh, my God.

911
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,759
Not bad, kid.

912
01:33:19,762 --> 01:33:21,138
"Not bad." You hear that?

913
01:33:21,972 --> 01:33:24,933
You know why that is?
It's because this is Kramer.

914
01:33:25,017 --> 01:33:26,351
Chas Kramer, ass--

915
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:35,277
Chas.

916
01:33:44,328 --> 01:33:46,163
You're right, John.

917
01:33:47,998 --> 01:33:49,708
It's not like the books.

918
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:52,085
No...

919
01:33:53,545 --> 01:33:54,713
It isn't.

920
01:34:16,276 --> 01:34:18,195
Into the light, I command thee.

921
01:34:20,072 --> 01:34:22,699
Into the light, I command thee.

Into the light, I command thee.

01:34:40,175 --> 01:34:42,261

And the wicked shall inherit the Earth.

928

You judging me now, John?

01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:58,986
Betrayal, murder, genocide,
call me provincial.

930
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:03,115
I am simply seeking to inspire mankind
to all that was intended.

931
01:35:03,657 --> 01:35:06,368
By handing Earth over
to the son of the devil?

932
01:35:07,828 --> 01:35:09,246
Help me here.

933
01:35:13,125 --> 01:35:17,588
You're handed this precious gift, right?

934
01:35:18,714 --> 01:35:22,634
Each one of you granted redemption
from the Creator.

935
01:35:23,844 --> 01:35:26,513
Murderers, rapists and molesters,

936
01:35:26,597 --> 01:35:28,891
all of you, you just have to repent

937
01:35:28,974 --> 01:35:31,018
and God takes you into his bosom.

938
01:35:34,187 --> 01:35:36,565
In all the worlds in all the universe,

939
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:39,568
no other creature can make
such a boast, save man.

940
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:43,363
It's not fair.

941
01:35:47,576 --> 01:35:50,412
If sweet, sweet God loves you so,

942
01:35:51,705 --> 01:35:54,666
then I'll make you worthy of his love.

943
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:58,587
I've been watching you for a long time.

944
01:35:59,504 --> 01:36:04,343
It's only in the face of horror
that you truly find your nobler selves.

945
01:36:04,426 --> 01:36:07,429
And you can be so noble.

946
01:36:10,891 --> 01:36:12,142
So...

947
01:36:13,185 --> 01:36:14,811
I'll bring you pain.

948
01:36:16,188 --> 01:36:18,065
I'll bring you horror.

949
01:36:20,275 --> 01:36:22,778
So that you may rise above it.

950
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:30,786
So that those of you who survive
this reign of hell on Earth

951
01:36:30,869 --> 01:36:33,205
will be worthy of God's love.

01:36:36,249 --> 01:36:38,627
you're insane.

The road to salvation begins tonight.

955
01:36:44,508 --> 01:36:45,717
Right now.

956
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:29,970
I know I'm not one of your favorites.

957
01:37:32,514 --> 01:37:34,391
I'm not even welcome in your house.

958
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:38,895
But I could use a little attention.

959
01:37:42,899 --> 01:37:44,151
Please.

960
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:32,449
[Gabriel] Come forth.

I unleash you unto this world.

You're the one soul...

970
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:37,741
I would come up here
to collect myself. Mm-hm.

971
01:40:40,452 --> 01:40:41,995
So I've heard.

972
01:40:43,622 --> 01:40:44,873
You mind?

973
01:40:45,874 --> 01:40:48,293
Oh, go-- Go right ahead. I've got stock.

974
01:40:49,211 --> 01:40:50,670
Coffin nail.

975
01:40:51,254 --> 01:40:52,589
Very fitting, John.

976
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:59,471
You know, when you cut too deep,
you cut the tendons...

977
01:40:59,554 --> 01:41:02,557
finger movement goes out the window.

978
01:41:02,641 --> 01:41:04,017
Let me help you.

979
01:41:16,196 --> 01:41:17,280
See?

980
01:41:19,616 --> 01:41:20,992
Sonny,

981
01:41:21,076 --> 01:41:26,248
I've got a whole theme park
full of red delights for you.

982
01:41:26,957 --> 01:41:28,541
Well, aren't you a peach.

983
01:41:30,293 --> 01:41:33,463
I didn't think you would
make the same mistake twice.

984
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:40,470
And you didn't...

985
01:41:41,554 --> 01:41:42,597
did you?

986
01:41:43,723 --> 01:41:45,392
So how's the family?

987
01:41:45,475 --> 01:41:47,477
Family's doing just fine.

988
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:50,939
Busy, busy, busy. Need a vacation.

989
01:41:51,898 --> 01:41:55,443
Word is that kid of yours
is a chip off the old block.

990
01:41:55,527 --> 01:41:58,738
Well, one does what one can.

991
01:41:58,822 --> 01:42:00,407
He's in the other room.

992
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:02,534
Boys will be boys.

993
01:42:04,411 --> 01:42:05,870
With Gabriel.

994
01:42:08,748 --> 01:42:11,501
No accounting for taste, really.

995
01:42:11,584 --> 01:42:14,296
They have the Spear of Destiny.

996
01:42:17,132 --> 01:42:19,968
"They have the Spear of Destiny."

997
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:31,604
Or is it another one of your cons?

998
01:42:34,274 --> 01:42:35,900
Go look for yourself.

999
01:42:39,529 --> 01:42:42,699
You've waited 20 years for me, Lu,

1000
01:42:43,616 --> 01:42:45,744
what's another 20 seconds?

1001
01:42:48,330 --> 01:42:49,414
[growls]

1002
01:43:51,393 --> 01:43:56,064
-Lucifer.
-This world is mine. In time.

1003
01:43:56,773 --> 01:43:59,442
You, best of all of us, Gabriel,

1004
01:43:59,526 --> 01:44:04,823
should understand ambition.

1005
01:44:04,906 --> 01:44:06,741
Son of perdition.

1006
01:44:08,618 --> 01:44:09,702
Little horn.

1007
01:44:11,704 --> 01:44:14,082
Most unclean.

1008
01:44:14,165 --> 01:44:16,584
I do miss the old names.

1009
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:19,921
Time to go home, son.

1010
01:44:20,004 --> 01:44:21,631
I will smite thee...

1011
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:25,218
in his honor.

1012
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:35,437
Looks like somebody doesn't
have your back anymore.

1013
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:46,823
[roaring]

1014
01:44:53,621 --> 01:44:54,873
Father?

1015
01:45:18,605 --> 01:45:19,856
So...

1016
01:45:27,489 --> 01:45:28,698
So...

1017
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:32,827
Yeah, what do you want? An extension?

1018
01:45:37,457 --> 01:45:38,958
The sister...

1019
01:45:40,418 --> 01:45:41,836
Isabel.

1020
01:45:43,755 --> 01:45:45,673
What about her?

1021
01:45:47,509 --> 01:45:49,260
Let her go home.

1022
01:45:52,805 --> 01:45:56,809
You're willing to give up your life
so she can go to heaven?

1023
01:46:06,986 --> 01:46:09,405
Fine. It's done.

1024
01:46:12,951 --> 01:46:16,329
Time to go, John.

1025
01:46:16,412 --> 01:46:17,622
Yeah.

1026
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:38,601
[whistling]

1027
01:47:00,873 --> 01:47:03,126
[grunts]

1028
01:47:15,972 --> 01:47:18,141
The sacrifice.

1029
01:47:29,736 --> 01:47:34,824
No. This one belongs to me.

1030
01:47:45,627 --> 01:47:51,549
No. You will live, John Constantine.

1031
01:47:54,302 --> 01:47:56,054
You will live.

1032
01:47:58,264 --> 01:48:00,391
So you will have...

1033
01:48:00,475 --> 01:48:02,644
[screams]

1034
01:48:02,727 --> 01:48:05,438
...the chance to prove...

1035
01:48:08,024 --> 01:48:12,987
that your soul truly belongs in hell.

1036
01:48:16,074 --> 01:48:18,910
Oh, you will live.

1037
01:48:23,748 --> 01:48:26,876
You will live.

1038
01:49:41,409 --> 01:49:42,827
Thank you.

1039
01:49:45,913 --> 01:49:47,165
No problem.

1040
01:49:54,756 --> 01:49:56,215
[Gabriel coughing]

1041
01:50:03,931 --> 01:50:05,183
[John] Human.

1042
01:50:07,435 --> 01:50:10,229
You don't deserve to be human.

1043
01:50:11,689 --> 01:50:15,610
Do you want revenge?
Is that what you're thinking right now?

1044
01:50:18,905 --> 01:50:19,947
Do it.

1045
01:50:21,741 --> 01:50:22,909
Do it.

1046
01:50:24,869 --> 01:50:26,287
Seek revenge.

1047
01:50:27,079 --> 01:50:28,706
End my life.

1048
01:50:29,916 --> 01:50:31,083
Go on.

1049
01:50:33,795 --> 01:50:35,379
Be the hand of God.

1050
01:50:35,463 --> 01:50:36,923
It's your choice.

1051
01:50:38,007 --> 01:50:39,550
It's always been your choice.

1052
01:50:45,765 --> 01:50:47,058
Yeah.

1053
01:50:52,730 --> 01:50:54,190
That's called pain.

1054
01:50:55,233 --> 01:50:56,651
Get used to it.

1055
01:51:03,032 --> 01:51:05,243
You could've shot me, John!

1056
01:51:07,411 --> 01:51:09,497
You chose a higher path!

1057
01:51:11,749 --> 01:51:13,668
Look how well you're doing!

1058
01:51:40,027 --> 01:51:41,362
[Angela] Nice spot.

1059
01:51:46,242 --> 01:51:47,785
[John] I have something for you.

1060
01:51:50,705 --> 01:51:53,583
Something tells me
you're not a flowers kind of guy.

1061
01:51:56,627 --> 01:51:58,629
Oh, how thoughtful.

1062
01:52:04,093 --> 01:52:04,969
John...

1063
01:52:07,722 --> 01:52:09,098
why are you giving me this?

1064
01:52:10,141 --> 01:52:11,267
Rules.

1065
01:52:11,767 --> 01:52:12,935
Hide it.

1066
01:52:13,644 --> 01:52:16,272
Somewhere no one
will ever be able to find it.

1067
01:52:17,773 --> 01:52:18,900
Not even me.

1068
01:52:19,483 --> 01:52:20,735
Ah.

1069
01:52:23,571 --> 01:52:24,864
Always a catch.

1070
01:52:26,657 --> 01:52:27,867
Yeah.

1071
01:52:41,631 --> 01:52:42,840
So...

1072
01:52:44,926 --> 01:52:47,303
I've got some cleaning up to do.

1073
01:52:51,766 --> 01:52:53,059
III...

1074
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:55,561
see you around.

1075
01:52:58,689 --> 01:53:00,191
I'd like that.

1076
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:33,057
[John]
I guess there's a plan for all of us.

1077
01:53:33,808 --> 01:53:36,936
I had to die... twice...

1078
01:53:37,019 --> 01:53:38,813
Just to figure that out.

1079
01:53:39,563 --> 01:53:43,818
Like the book says,
He works his work in mysterious ways.

1080
01:53:44,610 --> 01:53:46,862
Some people like it

1081
01:53:46,946 --> 01:53:48,531
some people don't.

1082
01:53:55,454 --> 01:53:57,665
[upbeat music playing]

1083
01:59:42,843 --> 01:59:44,511
You did good, kid.
