1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,882
- <i>Previously on</i> Gotham...
- NYGMA: You have five minutes, quiz kids.

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:05,869
Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill,

3
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:09,546
but who runs Wayne Enterprises?

4
00:00:09,664 --> 00:00:11,975
FRANK: <i>A weapon is en route
to destroy the city.</i>

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,976
I can't take on Nygma and Barbara

6
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:16,513
and the rest of them by myself.

7
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:17,847
Said you wanted to build an army, right?

8
00:00:17,883 --> 00:00:20,550
What about an army of freaks?

9
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:21,885
Who ordered the hit on my father?

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,186
Frank Gordon.

11
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:25,655
<i>- Your uncle.</i>
- You have the right to remain silent.

12
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:27,157
(grunting)

13
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:29,859
Dock 9C.

14
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:31,327
It's where the weapon will be arriving.

15
00:00:31,363 --> 00:00:33,630
Jim, do I hear a favor coming on?

16
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:36,299
- (grunting)
- What is coming into

17
00:00:36,334 --> 00:00:38,134
Dock 9C?

18
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,969
Now I know who I am...

19
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:41,271
I'm the Riddler.

20
00:00:42,374 --> 00:00:43,373
It's good to see you, too.

21
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:45,141
How'd things go with Selina?

22
00:00:45,177 --> 00:00:47,544
This... is what I was made for.

23
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:48,878
The clone is in place.

24
00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:50,413
Good evening, Alfred.

25
00:00:50,744 --> 00:00:52,148
And to you, Master Bruce.

26
00:00:52,184 --> 00:00:53,817
FRANK: You need to join
the Court of Owls, Jim.

27
00:00:53,852 --> 00:00:55,652
A woman named Kathryn is going to call.

28
00:00:55,687 --> 00:00:57,087
He would have been so proud of you.

29
00:00:57,122 --> 00:00:58,951
- No!
- (gunshot)

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:01,825
Kathryn, I presume.

31
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,259
I killed my uncle.

32
00:01:03,295 --> 00:01:04,561
I make no apologies for it.

33
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:05,922
<i>Maybe it's time we meet.</i>

34
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:08,032
KATHRYN: <i>My thought exactly.</i>

35
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:10,567
(wind whistling)

36
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:32,889
(grunting)

37
00:01:32,915 --> 00:01:35,516
(panting)

38
00:01:35,966 --> 00:01:37,527
Hello?!

39
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:39,395
Anyone home?

40
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:42,458
When this guy gets home, we got
to ask him to kick on the heat.

41
00:01:42,563 --> 00:01:44,989
It's colder in here
than it is out there.

42
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:50,140
Fascinating.

43
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:52,398
I know you're hell-bent
on getting revenge

44
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:53,562
on Nygma and all,

45
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:56,626
and forming an army of freaks
is a great plan, I mean,

46
00:01:56,712 --> 00:01:57,981
- it was my idea, but...
- (clattering)

47
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,136
Shh! Quiet.

48
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:02,042
I think I hear something.

49
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:04,128
Do you think it's him?

50
00:02:08,456 --> 00:02:09,655
(gasps)

51
00:02:13,604 --> 00:02:15,905
Mr. Fries.

52
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:19,112
Welcome home.

53
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:20,236
(grunting)

54
00:02:23,038 --> 00:02:24,817
I see you still hold me responsible

55
00:02:24,842 --> 00:02:28,118
for all of that awful monster rhetoric
I spewed during my campaign.

56
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:30,299
You ran people like me out of Gotham.

57
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:32,348
We both know I only said those things

58
00:02:32,384 --> 00:02:35,250
because that's
what the voters wanted to hear.

59
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:38,477
Your experiments, Mr. Fries.

60
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:41,719
You're trying to reverse
your condition, aren't you?

61
00:02:41,893 --> 00:02:43,500
I can help you.

62
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:45,321
And why would you do that?

63
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:47,616
My enemies took everything from me.

64
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:49,499
Tried to murder me.

65
00:02:50,249 --> 00:02:52,186
You help me get my revenge,

66
00:02:52,452 --> 00:02:54,311
and when I take back
my throne, I will give you

67
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,537
every resource you need to free
yourself from this icy prison.

68
00:03:01,178 --> 00:03:02,842
Even if I wanted to say yes,

69
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:05,293
I can only survive
a few hours outside the cold

70
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,783
without my suit.

71
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:10,471
And you don't have it
because it's been locked away

72
00:03:10,496 --> 00:03:14,412
in a Wayne Enterprises black site
ever since you escaped Indian Hill.

73
00:03:15,893 --> 00:03:17,370
Ivy?

74
00:03:17,529 --> 00:03:18,901
Oh.

75
00:03:21,346 --> 00:03:22,523
OSWALD: Ta-da.

76
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:23,666
VICTOR: My suit.

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,413
So, Mr. Fries, will you join us?

78
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:43,546
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx

79
00:03:49,491 --> 00:03:51,160
Where are we?

80
00:03:51,327 --> 00:03:54,038
Where we are is not important, James.

81
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:57,225
What matters is why you're here.

82
00:03:57,826 --> 00:03:59,366
You know why I killed my uncle.

83
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:01,037
Yes, I do.

84
00:04:01,216 --> 00:04:03,633
Frank murdered your father.

85
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:08,289
What I need to know is if you hold
us accountable for his action.

86
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:10,179
Frank acted alone.

87
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,654
He admitted as much to me.

88
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:14,490
Good.

89
00:04:15,387 --> 00:04:16,741
Then we can proceed.

90
00:04:17,373 --> 00:04:21,209
The city needs you now
more than ever, James.

91
00:04:21,326 --> 00:04:23,815
There's turmoil ahead,

92
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:26,001
and good men like you
are going to be needed

93
00:04:26,026 --> 00:04:27,423
to hold it together.

94
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:29,105
But make no mistake,

95
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:33,414
the Court, and the Court alone,
can save Gotham.

96
00:04:34,297 --> 00:04:35,972
So what do you want me to do?

97
00:04:36,211 --> 00:04:38,841
Prove your loyalty to the Court.

98
00:04:40,111 --> 00:04:42,069
Killing my uncle wasn't enough?

99
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,781
That was between you and Frank.

100
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,915
It had nothing to do with us.

101
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:49,953
When the time is right,
we will call upon you.

102
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:53,823
And Frank's body?
It's still in the brownstone.

103
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,215
We've already taken care of it.

104
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:02,863
- Who's the stiff?
- Jim's uncle, Frank Gordon.

105
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:04,133
Never met him.

106
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:05,435
They were estranged.

107
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,836
Have you seen Jim?

108
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:08,571
He's working a case.

109
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:11,311
Or he's walking in the door as we speak.

110
00:05:11,336 --> 00:05:14,577
Hey, Jim. Come in, we, uh,
have some bad news for you.

111
00:05:15,288 --> 00:05:16,675
What's going on?

112
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,202
I'm sorry.

113
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:20,456
We found your uncle's body this morning.

114
00:05:22,345 --> 00:05:23,953
He was pulled out of the harbor.

115
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:25,219
I did my prelim.

116
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,977
The burns on his left temple
suggest he was shot at close range.

117
00:05:28,055 --> 00:05:29,501
Lab is running ballistics.

118
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:32,295
You saw him at the cemetery yesterday.
He seemed on edge.

119
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,150
Did he say anything?

120
00:05:34,332 --> 00:05:35,939
No. He, uh,

121
00:05:36,063 --> 00:05:37,822
just stopped by to pay his respects.

122
00:05:38,603 --> 00:05:40,136
We didn't talk much.

123
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:43,027
Thanks, Lee. I'll take it from here.

124
00:05:43,105 --> 00:05:44,807
That's it? That's your reaction?

125
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:46,642
What do you want me to say?

126
00:05:48,313 --> 00:05:49,879
I know you.

127
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,663
You're hiding something.

128
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:53,273
- You know something.
- Lee, come on.

129
00:05:53,343 --> 00:05:54,888
The man just lost his uncle.

130
00:05:54,929 --> 00:05:56,863
Yeah, Harvey, you just
keep covering for him.

131
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:58,521
My condolences.

132
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:05,248
She's right. You do know
something, don't you?

133
00:06:05,646 --> 00:06:07,179
Uncle Frank shot himself.

134
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:10,166
Said it was the only way
to get me inside the Court.

135
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,302
- Did it work?
- I met with a woman named Kathryn.

136
00:06:13,635 --> 00:06:16,973
She says I have to prove
my loyalty to the Court first.

137
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:20,081
Look, I see the need
for playing it cool.

138
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:22,211
But right now,
the Court's readying a weapon

139
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:23,479
that could destroy the city.

140
00:06:23,504 --> 00:06:26,349
We don't have time to sit
on our thumbs and do nothing.

141
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:28,823
I don't like it any more than
you do, but if I push too hard,

142
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:31,128
we might blow the only chance
we have at stopping this.

143
00:06:31,776 --> 00:06:33,523
And Uncle Frank will have died in vain.

144
00:06:33,737 --> 00:06:36,714
Okay, so what do we do now?

145
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:40,329
Kathryn said to get back to work.
Keep up appearances.

146
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:42,220
That shouldn't be too hard.

147
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,399
- Look who resurfaced.
- _

148
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:47,503
(door closes)

149
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:49,599
Hello?

150
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:51,732
Ed?

151
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:54,083
It's Barbara.

152
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:57,107
Your old friend you've been blowing off.

153
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:01,176
I'll allow you to call me Ed

154
00:07:01,262 --> 00:07:03,160
'cause we have history.

155
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:05,145
But my name...

156
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:08,424
is the Riddler.

157
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,760
So the headlines say.

158
00:07:10,787 --> 00:07:11,903
(chuckles)

159
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:13,230
Now, why are you here?

160
00:07:13,872 --> 00:07:15,614
When Penguin was mayor,

161
00:07:15,778 --> 00:07:17,708
did he mention a mysterious group?

162
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,131
One that controlled
the levers of power in Gotham

163
00:07:20,156 --> 00:07:23,039
from the shadows with total impunity?

164
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:26,042
- No.
- See, I didn't claw my way to the top

165
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,242
only to find out
there was someone above me.

166
00:07:28,507 --> 00:07:30,578
I've been trying to find out
who they are,

167
00:07:30,664 --> 00:07:34,062
but no one in this town seems
to know anything about them.

168
00:07:34,273 --> 00:07:35,651
And how is it that you know about them?

169
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:38,574
Jim Gordon put me onto them.

170
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:41,308
And what is his interest in all this?

171
00:07:41,371 --> 00:07:42,281
He didn't say.

172
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:46,218
But he did ask me
to investigate a shipment

173
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,191
coming into Dock 9C yesterday.

174
00:07:49,253 --> 00:07:52,917
The harbormaster was protecting
a crate from Indian Hill.

175
00:07:53,026 --> 00:07:54,963
- What was inside?
- I don't know.

176
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:57,853
Before I got a chance to
find out, some masked assassin

177
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,675
slaughtered half my men.

178
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:03,345
What do you know?

179
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:05,237
When I was at Indian Hill,

180
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:10,283
Professor Strange hinted at
some powerful, secret group,

181
00:08:10,361 --> 00:08:11,845
but he didn't tell me who they were.

182
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,059
This is the one riddle that got away.

183
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,910
I will...

184
00:08:21,332 --> 00:08:23,722
get you the answer you seek.

185
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,621
But I will do it in my own way.

186
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:29,939
You're gonna make a big
production of this, aren't you?

187
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:32,777
Only someone with power and connections

188
00:08:32,863 --> 00:08:34,676
would have information on this group.

189
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:37,246
I need to speak with Gotham's elite.

190
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:40,026
And nothing brings out
the bourgeoisie quite like

191
00:08:40,142 --> 00:08:42,611
opening night at the theater.

192
00:08:43,165 --> 00:08:45,306
Where wilt thou lead me?

193
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:47,689
Speak,

194
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:50,412
for I will go no further.

195
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:56,265
(people muttering)

196
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:57,633
(clears throat)

197
00:08:58,786 --> 00:09:01,153
I say, Ghost,

198
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:03,880
speak your business

199
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:08,083
or I shall go no further!

200
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:10,012
NYGMA: My business

201
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:12,702
is not with you, Prince of Denmark.

202
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,968
But with your audience.

203
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:19,188
(sword scraping along stage)

204
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:24,381
I've come to address you,

205
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:27,319
the ruling class of Gotham.

206
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:31,155
You've kept a secret for far too long.

207
00:09:31,302 --> 00:09:33,248
But tonight

208
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:36,912
I will kidnap and torture one of you

209
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:38,475
to expose the truth.

210
00:09:38,576 --> 00:09:42,045
So, spread the word to all your friends,

211
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:45,214
the Riddler is coming.

212
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,620
Also, I found your performance
to be wooden

213
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:53,552
and (rolls R) unrealistic.

214
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,926
(gasping, screaming)

215
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,247
And scene.

216
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:19,364
And that, my old mucker,

217
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,278
is checkmate.

218
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:26,831
Good game, Alfred.

219
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:29,993
You let me win, didn't you,
Master Bruce?

220
00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:32,830
- No way, Alfred.
- No way, my foot.

221
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,399
That's very unlike you, isn't it?

222
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:37,201
And to be honest, I mean,

223
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,603
you haven't been yourself
these past few days, have you?

224
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,839
I don't know what you're talking about.

225
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,563
I think you do know what
I'm talking about, so come on.

226
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:49,580
Out with it.

227
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,512
The other day when I came home,

228
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,285
you asked how things were with Selina.

229
00:10:55,582 --> 00:10:58,088
I made it sound like
things were hopeful.

230
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,452
I lied.

231
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,436
She said she never wanted
to see me again.

232
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:06,396
I was embarrassed.

233
00:11:06,736 --> 00:11:08,454
I was afraid you'd...

234
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,650
ask me about seeing Selina,
and I'd lie and...

235
00:11:13,352 --> 00:11:14,921
I just didn't want to talk about it.

236
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,857
Well, then... I understand, Master B.

237
00:11:20,943 --> 00:11:23,013
And thank you very much
for being so candid.

238
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:27,484
And I really wouldn't worry
about Ms. Kyle.

239
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,788
You know, time has a way
of sorting these things out,

240
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:32,722
doesn't it?

241
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,949
Talking of which,
I should check on the dinner.

242
00:11:39,443 --> 00:11:40,742
Alfred.

243
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,465
Sir?

244
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,002
Thank you.

245
00:11:47,122 --> 00:11:49,036
You're a good friend.

246
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:51,918
Glad to hear it, sir.

247
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,770
It's me.

248
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,168
It's happening again.

249
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:24,927
Hey.

250
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:28,076
So, the audience has been accounted for.

251
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,466
Uh, is this Hamlet?

252
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:32,983
I guess he wasn't meant to be.

253
00:12:33,174 --> 00:12:35,986
You crossed paths with Nygma recently.

254
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,244
Any idea what this secret is
he's talking about?

255
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,723
No, I have no clue.

256
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,224
My guess is he just made it up.

257
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,493
Captain, we got the all clear.

258
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,945
All right.

259
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:02,463
This is all that's in there.

260
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:11,922
It's a riddle.

261
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,258
Shocker.

262
00:13:13,644 --> 00:13:17,054
Written in iambic pentameter
like a Shakespearean sonnet.

263
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,076
"I am a man who holds a high position,

264
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,699
"Who shows two faces
to all those he rules,

265
00:13:22,861 --> 00:13:26,271
"A fraud, criminal,
and sometime politician.

266
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,889
Gotham, my constituency of fools."

267
00:13:30,615 --> 00:13:32,376
A two-faced politician

268
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,225
- whose constituency is Gotham.
- The mayor?

269
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:39,068
"Fraud, criminal" sounds
like he's describing Penguin,

270
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:40,896
but that doesn't make any sense.

271
00:13:41,043 --> 00:13:43,365
Ed told Lucius he killed Penguin.

272
00:13:43,576 --> 00:13:45,068
Aubrey James.

273
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,559
He was recently reinstated
and he's been mayor before.

274
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:50,260
"Sometime politician,"
but why not just grab him?

275
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,895
Why tell us in advance?

276
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,363
Because Nygma wants to make a show of it

277
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:54,965
and make us look bad in the process.

278
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,560
Call the mayor's office.
Tell him we're on our way.

279
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:01,671
(siren wailing)

280
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:06,543
We don't need Nygma for anything.
He should be dead by now.

281
00:14:06,644 --> 00:14:10,280
He's obsessed with finding the answer,
which is an easy solution for us.

282
00:14:10,337 --> 00:14:12,602
Once he does, we'll get rid of him.

283
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:13,817
I promise.

284
00:14:14,391 --> 00:14:16,825
And how's him causing a scene
at the theater help us?

285
00:14:17,015 --> 00:14:18,793
It doesn't.

286
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:20,848
But it does help me more

287
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,489
fully announce myself
on the Gotham stage.

288
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:26,815
If you'll forgive the pun.

289
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,331
Do you want to become famous?

290
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:30,042
Try dying.

291
00:14:30,174 --> 00:14:33,284
- I can help you with that.
- Okay, that's enough.

292
00:14:34,401 --> 00:14:36,170
What actually is your plan?

293
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:39,393
Kidnap Mayor James.

294
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,977
The man ran this place for ten years.

295
00:14:43,098 --> 00:14:46,278
If anyone knows about this
mysterious group, he does.

296
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:47,872
You could've just said that.

297
00:14:47,966 --> 00:14:49,903
I could've had him here, being tortured.

298
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:53,403
Okay. See, but first
I had to tell the GCPD

299
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:54,997
what I was going to do.

300
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:58,232
How else am I supposed to properly
embarrass them publicly?

301
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,349
My crimes must live up to my name,

302
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,843
and this is no exception.

303
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:05,507
And what if the mayor doesn't know
anything about this group?

304
00:15:05,587 --> 00:15:07,890
Hmm? What then?

305
00:15:07,968 --> 00:15:09,456
I have a plan B to smoke them out,

306
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:13,627
but first... I need something from you.

307
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:16,532
There's a biker bar on the
corner of Spaulding and Eighth.

308
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,265
It's full of brawlers, lowlifes.

309
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:20,897
I need a bomb

310
00:15:21,036 --> 00:15:22,843
to detonate there.

311
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:24,780
Tonight.

312
00:15:25,107 --> 00:15:26,554
I'll let you know when.

313
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:27,941
So tell us, genius,

314
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:29,930
how do you plan to get Aubrey James

315
00:15:29,955 --> 00:15:32,135
now that you've told the GCPD
you're going after him?

316
00:15:32,213 --> 00:15:33,783
Oh, that's simple.

317
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:36,483
They're gonna bring him to me.

318
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,757
You know how many crooked politicians
there are in this city?

319
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,737
This riddle could be for anyone.

320
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:47,327
Oh, my gosh, these are delicious.

321
00:15:47,352 --> 00:15:48,475
All the same, Mr. Mayor,

322
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,131
we'd like to move you
to a safe house immediately.

323
00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:54,134
Did you not see
the muscle twins over there?

324
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:56,288
I'm perfectly safe here.

325
00:15:56,405 --> 00:15:58,398
Besides, what's the Riddler
want with me, anyway?

326
00:15:58,461 --> 00:15:59,867
BULLOCK: We're not really sure.

327
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:03,554
He did say something to the crowd
at the theater about a secret.

328
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,955
My life's an open book.

329
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:11,051
Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mayor?
You look a little...

330
00:16:11,182 --> 00:16:13,908
It's my blood sugar.
I've had too many of these Danishes.

331
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:15,962
Where are my pills?

332
00:16:16,158 --> 00:16:17,624
Wait a minute, where'd you get these?

333
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,026
An appreciative citizen. Why?

334
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:23,663
Oh, boy.

335
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,258
Nygma.

336
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,664
JAMES: This is bad.

337
00:16:39,015 --> 00:16:40,648
MAN: Coming through.

338
00:16:40,785 --> 00:16:42,785
(indistinct chatter)

339
00:16:47,954 --> 00:16:50,156
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

340
00:16:50,394 --> 00:16:52,094
You cannot be serious.

341
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:55,097
I've seen mass graves more
inviting than this place.

342
00:16:55,578 --> 00:16:58,272
Strange messed me up pretty good.

343
00:16:58,297 --> 00:16:59,323
He convinced me

344
00:16:59,357 --> 00:17:01,132
I was some sort of goddess,

345
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:03,561
and it took me a long time to get over it.

346
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:06,428
Now, this place might be bad,
but Gotham is worse.

347
00:17:06,453 --> 00:17:08,831
Hey, freak! You're on company time.

348
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,776
Get back to work.

349
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:14,652
You don't have to take that.

350
00:17:14,855 --> 00:17:18,683
- You should totally kick his ass.
- Yeah, but he's my boss.

351
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:22,278
Bridgit, there is nothing wrong
with being a freak.

352
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:25,181
I'm a freak.

353
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:26,845
So is Penguin.

354
00:17:26,985 --> 00:17:28,284
You belong with us.

355
00:17:30,488 --> 00:17:32,699
We've met before, haven't we?

356
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:35,024
Yeah. I'm Ivy Pepper.

357
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:36,860
Selina's friend.

358
00:17:37,162 --> 00:17:40,134
Oh, I know. I ran into
one of Strange's puppies.

359
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,397
Kind of had a growth spurt.

360
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:43,644
Though, to be honest,
I'm not complaining.

361
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,863
Ivy.

362
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:48,225
And you're part of this?

363
00:17:48,306 --> 00:17:51,441
Yeah. It's almost like we're a family.

364
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,397
You don't have to be alone anymore.

365
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:59,199
I could kill your boss
just to sweeten the deal.

366
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:02,975
Nah.

367
00:18:07,315 --> 00:18:08,807
Hey, you.

368
00:18:08,853 --> 00:18:10,235
- I quit.
- (shouts)

369
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:12,295
- (giggles)
- (screaming)

370
00:18:19,938 --> 00:18:22,126
Thank you for letting me come in.

371
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,507
The nosebleeds are getting worse.

372
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,483
You did the right thing coming here.

373
00:18:26,735 --> 00:18:29,104
- What did you tell Alfred?
- Nothing.

374
00:18:29,681 --> 00:18:32,443
I said I was tired,
then snuck out of my room.

375
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,423
I'm dying, aren't I?

376
00:18:40,606 --> 00:18:41,958
Yes.

377
00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:43,593
I'm sorry.

378
00:18:43,825 --> 00:18:46,996
The process that brought you
into this world was flawed.

379
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:50,333
Will I die before Bruce returns?

380
00:18:50,368 --> 00:18:53,310
No, Bruce Wayne will be back
in Gotham well before then.

381
00:18:55,373 --> 00:18:58,529
I know we've asked a lot of you.

382
00:18:59,592 --> 00:19:03,279
After Indian Hill I didn't know
what to do or where to go.

383
00:19:04,382 --> 00:19:06,557
You gave me a purpose.

384
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:09,869
That's more than most people could say.

385
00:19:09,954 --> 00:19:12,455
I'm glad you see it that way.

386
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:16,101
When Bruce returns...

387
00:19:17,729 --> 00:19:19,969
people are going to die, aren't they?

388
00:19:20,282 --> 00:19:21,639
A lot of people.

389
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,626
You haven't gotten attached
to anyone, have you?

390
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:27,243
Alfred, perhaps?

391
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:28,971
You've spoken fondly of him.

392
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:30,230
No.

393
00:19:31,332 --> 00:19:33,186
I just want to know.

394
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:37,012
The number is immaterial.

395
00:19:37,863 --> 00:19:41,319
What matters is that Gotham must fall.

396
00:19:41,886 --> 00:19:44,592
And because of your sacrifice, it will.

397
00:19:46,925 --> 00:19:48,631
Can we count on you?

398
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,621
Yes.

399
00:19:53,498 --> 00:19:55,198
His BP's dropping.

400
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:57,423
- We need to stabilize him!
- BULLOCK: I want this ER secured.

401
00:19:57,448 --> 00:20:00,079
Badge access only. No one gets in

402
00:20:00,104 --> 00:20:01,759
- unless they're sick or dying.
- CAMPOS: 10-4.

403
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,181
GORDON: Nygma knows this is the closest
hospital to the mayor's office.

404
00:20:04,206 --> 00:20:05,366
We brought him right to him.

405
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,077
Great, let him show his face.
I got unis all over the place.

406
00:20:08,112 --> 00:20:10,046
But what are we missing, Harvey?

407
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:12,371
What could Aubrey James know
that's so important to Nygma?

408
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:14,852
NYGMA: <i>Paging Detective James Gordon.</i>

409
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:17,687
<i>- Paging Detective James Gordon.</i>
- Where's that coming from?

410
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,264
Communications room. Second floor.

411
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,116
- It's a trap.
- WOMAN: <i>Please don't kill me!</i>

412
00:20:21,141 --> 00:20:23,067
<i>- Please don't kill me!
- (gunshots over P.A.)</i>

413
00:20:23,092 --> 00:20:24,114
You stay here.

414
00:20:25,114 --> 00:20:26,989
NYGMA: <i>So, Jimbo,</i>

415
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:31,540
<i>I know you must be wondering what
I want from that ding-dong Aubrey James.</i>

416
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:36,073
<i>Well... turns out,
he has answers to a riddle,</i>

417
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:39,621
<i>one that you put into motion
when you sent Barbara down to Dock 9C.</i>

418
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:43,517
<i>The question being, who runs Gotham?</i>

419
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,374
- I got to get out of here.
- No, whoa, whoa, whoa.

420
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:49,591
Mr. Mayor, you're in no
condition to go anywhere.

421
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,196
(cell phone ringing)

422
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,856
Jim. Tell me you got him.

423
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,317
He wasn't there.

424
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:57,937
But the secret he's after,
it's the Court.

425
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:00,229
DOCTOR: Lidocaine and an IV push.

426
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,950
- BULLOCK: <i>You better get back here quick.</i>
- What is it?

427
00:21:04,035 --> 00:21:06,435
There was some kind of explosion.
A lot of victims.

428
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,326
- I got a bad feeling.
- GORDON: <i>It's him.</i>

429
00:21:08,373 --> 00:21:09,909
Don't leave the mayor's side.

430
00:21:10,448 --> 00:21:11,941
Authorized personnel only.

431
00:21:11,976 --> 00:21:14,143
Hell with that. My friends got blown up!

432
00:21:14,178 --> 00:21:16,279
(grunting)

433
00:21:16,314 --> 00:21:18,614
(yelling and fighting continue)

434
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:26,367
Hello, Aubrey.

435
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:48,661
We got company.

436
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,141
Where is she?

437
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:51,934
Not here.

438
00:21:51,959 --> 00:21:54,259
I know she and Nygma
kidnapped Mayor James.

439
00:21:54,364 --> 00:21:57,286
Nygma mentioned Dock 9C and
she's the only one I told.

440
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,431
Nygma's got a big mouth.

441
00:21:59,466 --> 00:22:01,028
Wait, wait, wait,
let me get this straight.

442
00:22:01,168 --> 00:22:04,036
You mean this whole stupid
riddle thing with Nygma is real?

443
00:22:04,697 --> 00:22:07,306
What? He clearly knows
everything already.

444
00:22:08,776 --> 00:22:10,369
I heard a rumor

445
00:22:10,651 --> 00:22:13,305
he hurt you pretty bad
a while back, both of you.

446
00:22:13,517 --> 00:22:15,322
Surprised you're defending him.

447
00:22:15,596 --> 00:22:17,356
Listen, you tell me where they are,

448
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,321
I'll take Nygma down,

449
00:22:19,813 --> 00:22:21,594
but I'll give Barbara a free pass.

450
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,701
It's true. I hate him.

451
00:22:30,024 --> 00:22:31,557
But I don't know where they are.

452
00:22:31,772 --> 00:22:34,900
(phone rings)

453
00:22:35,181 --> 00:22:37,103
GORDON: Harvey?

454
00:22:37,378 --> 00:22:39,439
Okay. I'll be right there.

455
00:22:39,714 --> 00:22:41,610
Nygma sent another riddle.

456
00:22:41,647 --> 00:22:43,580
Never should have brought
Barbara into this.

457
00:22:43,702 --> 00:22:45,768
You better hope I get to her first.

458
00:22:47,255 --> 00:22:49,184
You should have given that freak up.

459
00:22:49,428 --> 00:22:51,361
No one wants Nygma dead more than me.

460
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,093
- But I can't betray Barbara.
- (door closes)

461
00:22:54,497 --> 00:22:55,661
Yeah.

462
00:22:55,747 --> 00:22:58,083
'Cause she's always got
your best interests at heart.

463
00:23:02,275 --> 00:23:03,517
Listen.

464
00:23:03,638 --> 00:23:05,666
You're in way over your head
on this one.

465
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:07,740
You don't want to mess
with these people.

466
00:23:07,885 --> 00:23:09,951
You see, everything that you say

467
00:23:10,103 --> 00:23:11,537
just makes me more intrigued.

468
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,140
And determined.

469
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:18,511
I will be the one who unmasks them.

470
00:23:18,573 --> 00:23:19,785
JAMES: You're insane.

471
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,456
Remember me, Aubrey?

472
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,894
I know that voice.

473
00:23:25,993 --> 00:23:27,769
I'm so glad.

474
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:30,907
I thought maybe it got muffled.

475
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:33,499
We put that box on your head.

476
00:23:33,534 --> 00:23:34,633
(Barbara giggles)

477
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:38,245
That was fun. We should do
that again for old times' sake.

478
00:23:38,606 --> 00:23:40,370
You don't get it, do you?

479
00:23:40,807 --> 00:23:42,228
These people, they're...

480
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:44,276
they're like God.
They see and hear everything.

481
00:23:44,312 --> 00:23:45,678
They'll know I talked.

482
00:23:45,745 --> 00:23:47,735
(gasps) Then it's the box.

483
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:50,180
No, no, no. Please, a-anything but that.

484
00:23:53,829 --> 00:23:56,350
They call themselves the Court.

485
00:23:57,694 --> 00:23:58,912
And?

486
00:23:59,393 --> 00:24:00,993
That's all I know.

487
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:03,123
I-I've never met these people.

488
00:24:03,248 --> 00:24:05,164
I just did what they asked me to, I swear.

489
00:24:08,502 --> 00:24:11,266
Very good! Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

490
00:24:11,376 --> 00:24:13,422
You've been very helpful.

491
00:24:14,575 --> 00:24:15,852
Helpful?

492
00:24:15,977 --> 00:24:17,843
All he gave us was "the Court."

493
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,931
He gave us tangible evidence
of their existence.

494
00:24:21,382 --> 00:24:22,982
Now they'll know I'm not bluffing.

495
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:24,984
What are you talking about?

496
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:28,554
I'm going to force the Court
to reveal themselves.

497
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,358
What is the one thing that every
secret organization is afraid of?

498
00:24:32,685 --> 00:24:34,216
Being exposed.

499
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:37,062
- Bingo.
- (curtain rustles)

500
00:24:38,933 --> 00:24:40,933
Finally. Did you bring what I asked for?

501
00:24:47,316 --> 00:24:49,041
It's time to get the Court's attention.

502
00:24:51,854 --> 00:24:53,322
Baby...

503
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:56,115
Gordon came to the club.
He knows everything.

504
00:24:57,852 --> 00:24:59,875
You should have never gotten
Nygma involved.

505
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:11,730
(purrs)

506
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,677
I boosted the premium stuff, Otto.

507
00:25:14,702 --> 00:25:16,835
(meowing)

508
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:18,483
You're welcome.

509
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,316
(meowing)

510
00:25:21,108 --> 00:25:22,536
BRUCE 2: Hello, Selina.

511
00:25:24,848 --> 00:25:26,512
What the hell are you doing here?

512
00:25:26,747 --> 00:25:28,474
I wanted to see you.

513
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:30,549
I missed you.

514
00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:33,252
Did you fall on your head?
I told you to stay away.

515
00:25:33,287 --> 00:25:35,005
You did?

516
00:25:35,656 --> 00:25:37,056
I forgot.

517
00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:39,831
Why are you acting so weird?

518
00:25:40,378 --> 00:25:42,307
I'm... I'm sorry.

519
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:44,589
I didn't sleep well last night.

520
00:25:44,732 --> 00:25:46,308
- Uh-huh.
- (Otto meows)

521
00:25:47,234 --> 00:25:49,103
Well, I just came to feed my cat.

522
00:25:49,128 --> 00:25:50,869
So, if you're not gonna leave, I am.

523
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:52,852
I promised myself I'd stay away.

524
00:25:52,877 --> 00:25:53,912
(sighs)

525
00:25:53,944 --> 00:25:55,836
That it would be safer that way, but...

526
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:57,476
things have changed.

527
00:25:57,687 --> 00:25:59,278
What are you talking about?

528
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:01,313
You know what? I don't care.

529
00:26:01,348 --> 00:26:03,267
Just don't be here when I get back.

530
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:04,884
Selina, wait.

531
00:26:09,156 --> 00:26:11,276
I am not Bruce.

532
00:26:15,296 --> 00:26:16,595
THOMPKINS: Jim?

533
00:26:16,682 --> 00:26:19,518
- Lee, now is not a good time.
- Your uncle's autopsy.

534
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:22,217
Ballistics came back negative. No match.

535
00:26:22,303 --> 00:26:24,570
But there were microscopic
tears along the entry wound,

536
00:26:24,605 --> 00:26:26,108
made postmortem.

537
00:26:26,397 --> 00:26:27,806
What are you saying?

538
00:26:27,944 --> 00:26:30,476
Someone removed the bullet
that killed your uncle

539
00:26:30,511 --> 00:26:32,077
and replaced it with another one.

540
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:34,180
It's an old mob trick
to cover up a murder.

541
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:36,266
- You're reaching, Lee.
- I don't think so.

542
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:38,586
And I think you know what happened.

543
00:26:38,915 --> 00:26:40,352
Listen to me.

544
00:26:40,387 --> 00:26:42,538
You need to drop this.
You could get yourself hurt.

545
00:26:42,563 --> 00:26:44,423
You think I care what happens to me?

546
00:26:44,532 --> 00:26:46,258
I am sick of watching you

547
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:48,494
destroy people's lives
and get away with it.

548
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:50,175
When I find out what you did,

549
00:26:50,397 --> 00:26:53,132
I'm gonna make sure you pay for it.
And I'm gonna enjoy it.

550
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:54,133
Jim, hey.

551
00:26:55,336 --> 00:26:57,636
(Bullock knocks)

552
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,511
- Where's the riddle?
- Me and Lucius took a crack at it,

553
00:27:05,546 --> 00:27:07,786
but maybe you'll have better luck.

554
00:27:08,036 --> 00:27:11,076
"You can see me,
but you cannot touch me.

555
00:27:11,552 --> 00:27:14,288
"The flick of a switch,
I enter your home.

556
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:16,811
"With another, I leave you alone.

557
00:27:17,318 --> 00:27:18,357
Where am I?"

558
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:20,459
He's taunting us. If he kills James,

559
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:24,076
the press is gonna hand us
our asses on the 6:00 news.

560
00:27:24,178 --> 00:27:25,564
Harvey, you're a genius.

561
00:27:25,756 --> 00:27:27,599
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

562
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,879
<i>I have a question.</i>

563
00:27:31,005 --> 00:27:34,090
<i>What is this mysterious "Court"</i>

564
00:27:34,192 --> 00:27:37,409
<i>that controls the levers
of power here in Gotham?</i>

565
00:27:37,444 --> 00:27:39,144
Alvarez, go to channel seven!

566
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,046
Find out where Nygma's broadcasting from.

567
00:27:41,081 --> 00:27:45,595
<i>...let our dear mayor's head
be blown to bits</i>

568
00:27:45,686 --> 00:27:48,187
- <i>in order to keep their anonymity?</i>
- (phone ringing)

569
00:27:48,222 --> 00:27:50,556
<i>(Nygma laughing)</i>

570
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,737
KATHRYN:
<i>Are you watching the television?</i>

571
00:27:54,762 --> 00:27:55,861
I am.

572
00:27:55,896 --> 00:27:59,025
The Court cannot be exposed.

573
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,420
We would clean this up on our own,

574
00:28:01,445 --> 00:28:03,602
but there are too many eyes watching.

575
00:28:03,818 --> 00:28:08,029
<i>However, this does afford us
an opportunity, James.</i>

576
00:28:08,123 --> 00:28:09,932
To prove my loyalty.

577
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:13,395
You want me to find Nygma
and bring him to you?

578
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:17,549
I understand this puts you
in a difficult position.

579
00:28:17,808 --> 00:28:20,245
He's a cop killer. He belongs in prison.

580
00:28:20,321 --> 00:28:23,050
<i>If you decline, this
conversation will be our last.</i>

581
00:28:23,123 --> 00:28:24,556
The choice is yours.

582
00:28:24,592 --> 00:28:26,024
(hangs up phone)

583
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,392
That was the Court.

584
00:28:27,988 --> 00:28:29,674
If I hand him over, I'm in.

585
00:28:29,699 --> 00:28:31,563
- They'll probably kill him.
- And if I don't,

586
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,855
we'll never stop them
from destroying the city.

587
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,635
<i>I know what you're thinking, Aubrey.</i>

588
00:28:36,737 --> 00:28:40,405
That the police are gonna
somehow find you, rescue you.

589
00:28:40,877 --> 00:28:44,213
But I gave the GCPD
every chance to save you.

590
00:28:44,393 --> 00:28:48,244
<i>But they're no match for me! (laughs)</i>

591
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:51,947
We're both dead men.

592
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:54,598
You don't get it, do you?

593
00:28:55,403 --> 00:28:58,098
- The Court isn't gonna bargain with you.
- (phone ringing)

594
00:28:58,864 --> 00:29:00,892
You underestimate me, Mr. James.

595
00:29:00,928 --> 00:29:03,762
(phone rings)

596
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:07,332
- Hello.
- Nygma.

597
00:29:09,803 --> 00:29:11,480
<i>Jim, I'm so sorry.</i>

598
00:29:11,505 --> 00:29:12,904
We can't be clogging up the lines.

599
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,473
I'm actually expecting
an important call.

600
00:29:14,501 --> 00:29:16,668
<i>You want to know who runs Gotham?</i>

601
00:29:16,816 --> 00:29:18,076
<i>I have the answer.</i>

602
00:29:18,112 --> 00:29:21,269
Come by the GCPD. I'll tell it to you.

603
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:23,448
Hmm. Yeah, I think I'll pass on that.

604
00:29:23,484 --> 00:29:24,916
<i>Then you'll never know the truth.</i>

605
00:29:25,213 --> 00:29:27,219
You think I told Barbara
everything I know?

606
00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:31,775
You always were clever, Jim.
I respect that.

607
00:29:32,025 --> 00:29:34,026
<i>Empty out the GCPD.</i>

608
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:36,528
<i>I want it to just be you and me.</i>

609
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:38,363
<i>Alone.</i>

610
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,167
<i>Well, and this idiot
with the bomb around his neck.</i>

611
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:45,830
(yells)

612
00:29:48,332 --> 00:29:49,879
BULLOCK: You think he'll show?

613
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:52,667
GORDON: The thing that drives
Nygma is also his weakness.

614
00:29:52,732 --> 00:29:53,839
He'll be here.

615
00:29:53,864 --> 00:29:56,222
It's not like every man,
woman and child in Gotham

616
00:29:56,247 --> 00:29:58,066
isn't depending on you to succeed.

617
00:29:58,091 --> 00:30:00,309
Yeah. No pressure.

618
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,489
- Good luck, pal.
- Thanks.

619
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:12,192
Where's Ed?

620
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,414
That lunatic dropped me off.
Sent me in alone.

621
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:17,156
- Get the bomb squad in here!
- Sit down and shut up.

622
00:30:19,644 --> 00:30:20,726
Ed?

623
00:30:20,824 --> 00:30:22,925
It's just the two of us in here.

624
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:27,266
Just wanted to make sure
I wasn't walking into a trap.

625
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:29,882
Nah, ah, ah.

626
00:30:31,015 --> 00:30:32,771
Sit down, Aubrey.

627
00:30:36,173 --> 00:30:38,423
You said you have the answer
I was looking for, Jim.

628
00:30:38,493 --> 00:30:40,346
It would be incredibly disappointing

629
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:43,137
if this was all a ruse.
More so for Mayor James.

630
00:30:43,162 --> 00:30:44,483
Just tell him what he wants.

631
00:30:44,685 --> 00:30:46,185
He talks too much.

632
00:30:46,365 --> 00:30:47,920
(laughs)

633
00:30:47,955 --> 00:30:49,943
You should probably just go ahead
and blow him up.

634
00:30:50,024 --> 00:30:51,523
JAMES: I'll have your badge, Gordon.

635
00:30:53,094 --> 00:30:54,634
I'm not bluffing, Jim.

636
00:30:54,762 --> 00:30:56,853
Neither am I.

637
00:30:57,098 --> 00:30:59,365
What's the blast radius on
that thing? Am I good here?

638
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,775
Or should I... duck behind a desk?

639
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,203
I want the answer, Jim!

640
00:31:07,775 --> 00:31:12,378
I kill him, I still walk out
of here with you as my hostage.

641
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:16,882
- (device beeping)
- JAMES: No!

642
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:17,750
No!

643
00:31:19,403 --> 00:31:20,819
- No!
- (beeping)

644
00:31:22,137 --> 00:31:23,822
Oh, come on.

645
00:31:25,237 --> 00:31:26,821
GORDON: There's a radio frequency

646
00:31:26,846 --> 00:31:29,048
jamming the signal between
the detonator and the bomb.

647
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,096
- How?
- Tabitha.

648
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:33,060
She holds quite the grudge against you.

649
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,099
She called me.

650
00:31:34,135 --> 00:31:36,268
Told me how to disarm the bomb.

651
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,604
(chuckles softly)

652
00:31:39,329 --> 00:31:41,106
I'll admit, I didn't see this coming.

653
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:44,650
But that doesn't change anything.

654
00:31:44,812 --> 00:31:46,243
I want...

655
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:48,096
to know...

656
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:50,229
who the Court is.

657
00:31:51,771 --> 00:31:53,377
Or Aubrey dies.

658
00:31:55,022 --> 00:31:56,288
Don't!

659
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:01,260
You want to know who runs Gotham?

660
00:32:02,052 --> 00:32:04,075
Then let Mayor James go.

661
00:32:04,665 --> 00:32:06,177
Take a ride with me.

662
00:32:06,267 --> 00:32:07,903
But if you pull that trigger,

663
00:32:08,035 --> 00:32:10,135
you'll never get the answer
you're looking for.

664
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,982
You fool me once, Jim,

665
00:32:14,175 --> 00:32:16,178
(clicks tongue) shame on you.

666
00:32:17,178 --> 00:32:19,170
You fool me twice...

667
00:32:20,281 --> 00:32:21,780
...well, that's just not gonna happen.

668
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:23,902
Then the riddle will go unsolved.

669
00:32:30,878 --> 00:32:32,791
Fine!

670
00:32:39,477 --> 00:32:40,777
Let's go.

671
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:43,535
(sirens wailing)

672
00:32:43,571 --> 00:32:45,355
SELINA: <i>Let me get this straight.</i>

673
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:49,975
So, this limo pulls up
literally out of nowhere,

674
00:32:50,066 --> 00:32:53,679
and this creepy lady tells you
to get in because

675
00:32:53,714 --> 00:32:56,428
"you could be so much more"?

676
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,183
And you did?

677
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,006
I had nowhere else to go.

678
00:33:00,131 --> 00:33:02,029
So where have you been
the last few months?

679
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:03,412
It's not important.

680
00:33:03,557 --> 00:33:05,190
What matters is
you need to leave Gotham.

681
00:33:05,226 --> 00:33:06,892
- Right away.
- Why?

682
00:33:07,693 --> 00:33:09,372
Because the city has been judged.

683
00:33:09,443 --> 00:33:12,364
- And something bad is going to happen.
- (chuckles) Judged by who?

684
00:33:14,902 --> 00:33:16,573
The people who took you?

685
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:19,901
Wait a minute, your clothes, your hair,

686
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,840
the way you talk.

687
00:33:25,246 --> 00:33:26,478
Where is Bruce?

688
00:33:26,594 --> 00:33:29,024
- Selina...
- What did you do to him?

689
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,582
He's fine. He's not in Gotham.

690
00:33:30,829 --> 00:33:32,584
But nothing bad is going
to happen to him.

691
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,653
- Then where is he?
- It doesn't matter.

692
00:33:34,688 --> 00:33:37,189
You just have to trust me.
You need to leave Gotham today.

693
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:38,624
Trust you?

694
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:43,130
- (scoffs) I don't even know you.
- Where you going?

695
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:45,430
To tell Alfred.

696
00:33:45,466 --> 00:33:47,402
- Selina...
- Now let me go!

697
00:33:47,427 --> 00:33:50,035
- Selina, you can't tell anyone.
- Then why the hell did you tell me?

698
00:33:52,773 --> 00:33:54,540
Because I care about you.

699
00:33:55,197 --> 00:33:57,209
And if there's one
person I want to save,

700
00:33:57,244 --> 00:33:58,861
I want it to be you.

701
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,380
(soft chuckle)

702
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:05,417
That's the difference
between you and Bruce Wayne.

703
00:34:07,054 --> 00:34:09,562
He would try and save everyone.

704
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,528
You can pretend all you want,
but you will never be him.

705
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,263
You're nothing.

706
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,294
You're not even a real person.

707
00:34:21,735 --> 00:34:22,968
You don't matter.

708
00:34:25,947 --> 00:34:28,012
You're wrong about me.

709
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:30,844
I do matter.

710
00:34:31,412 --> 00:34:32,811
And I won't let you tell Alfred.

711
00:34:32,943 --> 00:34:34,553
Oh, yeah?

712
00:34:34,997 --> 00:34:36,372
How you gonna stop...

713
00:34:36,417 --> 00:34:37,849
(Selina screams)

714
00:35:01,087 --> 00:35:03,520
(ship horns blowing)

715
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:14,285
You remember the night you
came over to Lee's for dinner?

716
00:35:15,937 --> 00:35:17,929
It was like a lifetime ago.

717
00:35:18,094 --> 00:35:20,539
Leslie made fondue.

718
00:35:21,063 --> 00:35:23,240
The wine was a Bordeaux.

719
00:35:24,279 --> 00:35:26,951
Well-aged. Smooth tannins.

720
00:35:28,771 --> 00:35:32,365
Ms. Kringle wore a black dress
with pink trim.

721
00:35:33,476 --> 00:35:35,376
I tried like hell to get out of it.

722
00:35:35,725 --> 00:35:37,400
(chuckles)

723
00:35:37,558 --> 00:35:39,024
But Lee insisted.

724
00:35:39,703 --> 00:35:42,116
The truth is, I had a good time.

725
00:35:45,421 --> 00:35:47,121
I considered you a friend.

726
00:35:49,392 --> 00:35:51,025
I can sneak up on you

727
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,526
or be right in front of you
without you even knowing.

728
00:35:53,663 --> 00:35:55,690
But when I reveal myself,

729
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:58,899
you will never be the same. What am I?

730
00:35:58,924 --> 00:36:01,325
- I don't care, Ed...
- Betrayal.

731
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:03,349
(thunder rumbling)

732
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:04,972
That's how every friendship ends.

733
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,850
So...

734
00:36:07,276 --> 00:36:09,576
so what good are friends anyway?

735
00:36:10,313 --> 00:36:12,313
(car approaching)

736
00:36:23,259 --> 00:36:24,558
Who are they?

737
00:36:24,593 --> 00:36:26,407
The answer to your question.

738
00:36:45,435 --> 00:36:47,216
Hello, Mr. Nygma.

739
00:36:47,427 --> 00:36:49,239
I hear you've been asking about us.

740
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,185
How do I know you're real?

741
00:36:52,655 --> 00:36:55,082
Isn't that the point of a good mystery?

742
00:36:55,481 --> 00:36:58,659
You're never quite sure what
to believe until the end.

743
00:36:59,082 --> 00:37:00,761
Gordon could've put you up to this.

744
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:01,719
I assure you,

745
00:37:01,744 --> 00:37:05,610
Detective Gordon had to be
convinced to bring you here.

746
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,250
But let me put it like this:

747
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,598
that question Professor
Strange had you ask

748
00:37:11,623 --> 00:37:15,240
Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox
last year at Indian Hill,

749
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:18,378
the one that has tortured you,

750
00:37:18,914 --> 00:37:21,839
the one you'll never be able to answer.

751
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:23,679
That answer is with me.

752
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:29,007
What now?

753
00:37:29,158 --> 00:37:30,499
Get in.

754
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:33,227
And all your questions will be answered.

755
00:37:34,649 --> 00:37:36,063
You won't be needing the gun.

756
00:37:57,853 --> 00:37:59,686
(thunder cracks)

757
00:37:59,722 --> 00:38:02,462
You've made us proud, Detective Gordon.

758
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:04,591
What are you going to do with him?

759
00:38:04,707 --> 00:38:08,480
A man with Nygma's intellect
could be quite useful to us.

760
00:38:08,715 --> 00:38:10,898
I'm sure we'll find
something for him to do.

761
00:38:12,762 --> 00:38:14,270
We'll be in touch.

762
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:24,043
♪ Till the fearless come ♪

763
00:38:24,113 --> 00:38:27,328
♪ And the act is done ♪

764
00:38:27,353 --> 00:38:29,783
♪ A love like blood ♪

765
00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:31,418
♪ A love like blood ♪

766
00:38:36,477 --> 00:38:38,692
Good evening, Ms. Kean.
May I offer you a drink?

767
00:38:40,629 --> 00:38:42,129
Something went wrong.

768
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:43,999
Gordon took down Nygma
before he could find out

769
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:45,699
the truth about the Court.

770
00:38:46,021 --> 00:38:48,763
Probably 'cause I told Gordon
how to disarm the bomb.

771
00:38:48,825 --> 00:38:50,254
What?

772
00:38:50,504 --> 00:38:52,238
Why?

773
00:38:52,308 --> 00:38:54,894
You promised that when Nygma
handed over the underworld,

774
00:38:54,927 --> 00:38:56,840
I would get to kill him.

775
00:38:58,147 --> 00:39:00,130
Sealed it with a kiss, remember?

776
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,059
Don't you get it?

777
00:39:03,278 --> 00:39:05,953
As long as the Court is out there,

778
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:09,080
I'll never be in control!

779
00:39:11,299 --> 00:39:13,791
Don't you mean<i> we'll</i>
never be in control?

780
00:39:22,316 --> 00:39:24,950
Seen it a thousand times.

781
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:27,814
Ambition, power.

782
00:39:28,252 --> 00:39:29,743
People can't help themselves.

783
00:39:30,236 --> 00:39:32,252
She's changed, baby.

784
00:39:32,525 --> 00:39:33,994
When are you gonna see that?

785
00:39:34,106 --> 00:39:36,041
Shut up, Butch!

786
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:37,551
Move!

787
00:39:39,522 --> 00:39:41,404
This is trouble.

788
00:39:47,563 --> 00:39:48,888
It's good to be home.

789
00:39:48,913 --> 00:39:52,763
FYI, I've been to Wayne Manor.
It's way cleaner.

790
00:39:53,469 --> 00:39:56,136
You never said anything about
Fries being a part of this.

791
00:39:56,585 --> 00:39:58,355
You're a little hot.

792
00:39:58,410 --> 00:39:59,722
Maybe you need to cool off.

793
00:39:59,808 --> 00:40:01,333
- (guns powering up)
- IVY: Oh, come on, you guys.

794
00:40:01,402 --> 00:40:03,644
We're on the same team now, remember?

795
00:40:04,647 --> 00:40:06,793
- A family?
- (guns power down)

796
00:40:09,385 --> 00:40:10,884
Keep him away from me.

797
00:40:18,024 --> 00:40:20,852
There's a question mark on your face.

798
00:40:21,548 --> 00:40:23,582
You can sleep in the freezer.

799
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:27,768
REPORTER: <i>The study speculates that
widespread chemical dumping is to blame.</i>

800
00:40:27,822 --> 00:40:30,438
<i>And this just in:
we now go to breaking news...</i>

801
00:40:30,463 --> 00:40:34,326
- Hey, Pengy. Check it out.
- Do not call me "Pengy"!

00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:36,139
- My...

- (snickers)

808
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,257

to think about that one?

809
00:40:50,292 --> 00:40:53,060
