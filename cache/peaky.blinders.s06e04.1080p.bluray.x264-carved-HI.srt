00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:46,361
Tommy?

165
00:17:47,921 --> 00:17:49,761
- Tom?
- Yeah, it's me.

166
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:52,121
Ah, fuck.

167
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,521
Arthur, give me a light,
will you?

168
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:15,881
I can't find my lighter.

169
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:18,881
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

170
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:31,241
I'm sorry I couldn't speak
at the wagon, Tom.

171
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,521
Don't be sorry.

172
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:47,001
What are you doing here?

173
00:18:50,241 --> 00:18:52,801
Waiting for this fucking cup
to fill up.

174
00:18:57,161 --> 00:18:58,721
Nearly empty, this barrel.

175
00:19:00,281 --> 00:19:02,361
There are plenty
of barrels, Arthur.

176
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:05,361
Start another barrel.

177
00:19:05,481 --> 00:19:08,321
I thought maybe they're all
full of fucking blood.

178
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:13,561
The junk, Tom...

179
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:17,161
...fucks up your mind.

180
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:23,361
You know, Arthur...

181
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:27,801
...you was already fucked up.

182
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,241
You was fucked up
since you was a kid.

183
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:35,561
This is my theory.

184
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:42,041
It's from that time
I gave you a beating

185
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:44,041
when you was twelve
and I was nine.

186
00:19:45,521 --> 00:19:47,481
We were fighting
over cigarettes.

187
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:54,441
Maybe... when I had you
down on the ground...

188
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:57,841
...I gave you one too many
to the head.

189
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:00,361
It was a draw, though, Tom.

190
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:01,841
Nah.

191
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:04,201
I beat you.

192
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:06,881
I had you pinned.

193
00:20:07,001 --> 00:20:08,601
You actually didn't.

194
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:12,561
- We both agreed.
- You're so fucked

195
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:14,721
you can't remember, Brother.

196
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:17,881
I do.

197
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:20,161
I do remember little things.

198
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:21,601
I know you do.

199
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:24,481
So do I.

200
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:26,641
The fog and the gas
is clearing, eh?

201
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,841
(TOMMY COUGHS)

202
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:21,241
Here, that cup's nearly full.
Pass it here.

203
00:21:25,641 --> 00:21:26,961
I thought you...

204
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:31,481
Tom, you don't want
stuff any more.

205
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:33,081
Eh?

206
00:21:34,081 --> 00:21:35,761
You don't drink no more, Tom.

207
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:01,841
Even when Polly was gone,
Arthur...

208
00:22:03,201 --> 00:22:04,841
...I thought I could just march
and march.

209
00:22:06,601 --> 00:22:09,081
If I just kept up that fucking
left, right, left, right,

210
00:22:09,201 --> 00:22:12,041
left, right, left, right
fucking rhythm,

211
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:14,201
I'd never have to stop.

212
00:22:16,321 --> 00:22:17,921
Then Ruby went.

213
00:22:21,801 --> 00:22:23,641
I stumbled and crashed.

214
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,681
Now here I am...

215
00:22:32,361 --> 00:22:34,801
...sat on me arse...

216
00:22:34,921 --> 00:22:37,321
...on the ground...

217
00:22:37,441 --> 00:22:39,401
...like a fucking toddler...

218
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:43,721
...with me old comrade Arthur.

219
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:46,201
Yeah.

220
00:22:48,641 --> 00:22:50,521
Remember the January, Arthur?

221
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:54,441
The family boat?

222
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,721
The whole family
living on something

223
00:22:57,841 --> 00:23:00,121
the size of ten of
these fucking barrels?

224
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:07,841
Remember that night
at Tile Cross...

225
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:10,361
...16 of us
sleeping on the boat?

226
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:11,721
The coppers come.

227
00:23:12,721 --> 00:23:15,041
We all swim like rats.

228
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:16,601
Except for Arthur.

229
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:22,001
Arthur holds them off with
a boathook all on his own.

230
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:25,121
And I remember...

231
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:28,641
...I climbed back up
at the lock and I looked back

232
00:23:28,761 --> 00:23:31,401
and saw you waving
that fucking boathook

233
00:23:31,521 --> 00:23:32,721
in the coppers' faces...

234
00:23:32,841 --> 00:23:34,521
(ARTHUR CHUCKLES)

235
00:23:34,641 --> 00:23:35,881
...on your own.

236
00:23:37,321 --> 00:23:38,721
That's when I realised.

237
00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:42,361
When I had you on the ground...

238
00:23:43,401 --> 00:23:45,241
...all them years ago...

239
00:23:45,361 --> 00:23:47,401
...it's cos you let me win.

240
00:23:51,161 --> 00:23:52,681
You wanted me to win.

241
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,361
You've wanted me to win
ever since.

242
00:24:01,081 --> 00:24:03,201
What chance do I have if you...

243
00:24:04,841 --> 00:24:08,001
...start doing that again? Eh?

244
00:24:09,761 --> 00:24:13,521
You'll stop. You'll stop
cos the family needs you to.

245
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:19,801
It's like that long tunnel
on the Dudley stretch.

246
00:24:19,921 --> 00:24:21,681
You remember Dudley Canal,
Line Number 1?

247
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:23,921
3,172 yards

248
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:26,641
of fucking pitch-blackness
and rats swimming.

249
00:24:26,761 --> 00:24:27,881
- Yeah.
- And then we'd come

250
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:31,001
round that corner and
there'd be a shaft of light.

251
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:33,801
And then we'd know.

252
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:35,241
- Yeah.
- And you and me

253
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:37,321
would both know
it was nearly done.

254
00:24:40,201 --> 00:24:42,441
That's where
we are now, Arthur.

255
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:46,721
Just a few more yards to go.

256
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:50,481
Then you will change your ways.

257
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:55,841
And I'll change
the fucking world.

258
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:16,001
We assumed, at this late hour,
you would have had dinner.

259
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:18,161
There are drinks
and sandwiches, if you want.

260
00:26:18,281 --> 00:26:19,481
We're not here to eat.

261
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:22,881
Mr Shelby will be down shortly.

262
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:24,841
Please, tell Mr Shelby
on behalf of us all

263
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:26,241
that changing the world
can wait.

264
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:28,001
He doesn't want to wait.

265
00:26:28,121 --> 00:26:29,361
There is champagne.

266
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:31,201
Oh, goodie.

267
00:26:41,681 --> 00:26:43,081
Charles?

268
00:26:45,241 --> 00:26:46,801
I heard cars.

269
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:49,881
(DOOR OPENS)

270
00:26:51,121 --> 00:26:52,641
Mr Shelby, the guests are...

271
00:26:52,761 --> 00:26:54,161
I know.

272
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:56,521
Dad?

273
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:58,521
There's a Bentley
and a Rolls-Royce.

274
00:27:01,761 --> 00:27:02,761
Yeah.

275
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:06,681
Go to bed, Charles.

276
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:15,761
I can't sleep.

277
00:27:19,241 --> 00:27:21,641
I see her when I shut my eyes.

278
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:24,721
Go to your mum.

279
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:26,841
She'll be awake.

280
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:29,641
- She holds on to me.
- Let her hold on to you.

281
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,401
You hear me?

282
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:35,121
Always let her hold on to you.

283
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,881
Go on.

284
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:45,041
Mr Shelby, the guests said
they would understand if...

285
00:27:45,161 --> 00:27:46,361
Have you served them drinks?

286
00:27:46,481 --> 00:27:48,481
- Yes.
- Yeah.

287
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:02,721
I'm OK, Frances.

288
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:09,601
The agenda is in my head.

289
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:12,921
The agenda is in my head.

290
00:28:14,121 --> 00:28:15,641
I'm OK.

291
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:18,161
Do I look OK?

292
00:28:21,441 --> 00:28:23,881
If someone touches you,
you won't shatter.

293
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:28,361
Sing it.

294
00:28:28,481 --> 00:28:30,321
Sing it. I love that song.

295
00:28:30,441 --> 00:28:33,241
I... can't be singing
rebel songs

296
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:34,761
in a house
in grief and mourning.

297
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:37,921
Sing it to me softly.
It breaks my heart.

298
00:28:39,481 --> 00:28:41,321
Don't look at him.
He's English.

299
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:43,401
He can block his ears.

300
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:47,441
Darling?

301
00:28:47,481 --> 00:28:50,881
Should she sing her rebel
IRA song while we wait,

302
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:52,961
or would that be inappropriate?

303
00:28:56,641 --> 00:28:57,801
You know, I went to a meeting

304
00:28:57,881 --> 00:28:59,361
of similar intent to this
in Berlin

305
00:28:59,481 --> 00:29:02,601
attended by
the Chancellor himself...

306
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:05,801
..and Göring and Himmler.

307
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:08,601
It lasted until
the sun came up.

308
00:29:08,721 --> 00:29:13,121
We spoke about the future
of the world in a serious way.

309
00:29:15,161 --> 00:29:17,881
When the first rays of light
entered the room, we all stood

310
00:29:18,001 --> 00:29:20,641
and stared at it as if it were
the world to come.

311
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24,521
There was no singing,
no giggling.

312
00:29:27,441 --> 00:29:29,481
And when breakfast was served
on the terrace,

313
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,121
overlooking the mountains,

314
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:32,881
they brought up some Jews.

315
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:37,921
And while we ate our eggs,
they were forced to eat grass.

316
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:42,441
And we watched
as we sipped our coffee.

317
00:29:48,441 --> 00:29:51,201
We should all remember
this is serious business.

318
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:01,761
MOSLEY: Oh, Diana.

319
00:30:03,921 --> 00:30:06,761
Now look what you've done.
You've killed the mood.

320
00:30:11,841 --> 00:30:13,921
Let her sing her fucking song
to raise our spirits.

321
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:15,801

how this new world of ours
will look, shall we?

341
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:06,521
Perhaps, Mr Mosley, we can turn

342
00:34:06,641 --> 00:34:08,521
to what practical things
Mr Nelson can do

to... further our cause
while he's in the country.

We do indeed have things

00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:22,241
for you to whisper
into the President's ear.

348
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:28,001
Tell him we are England.
We are the mood England is in.

349
00:34:28,121 --> 00:34:32,401
And in Ireland, appeasers
to the English abound,

but we represent
the true, liberated spirit

your own.

When it comes
to the working class,

355
00:34:49,441 --> 00:34:52,481
we could move our people
from republicanism

to fascism with just a nudge.

Mr Shelby has one of

00:35:18,761 --> 00:35:21,761
the largest Commons majorities
in England.

365

366
00:35:25,281 --> 00:35:27,561
When the time comes,
he'll resign his party whip

and run as an independent.

They say the black rubs off.

384
00:37:06,161 --> 00:37:08,081
When they come to power...

385
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:09,801
...they'll take her off you.

386
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:12,841
They're going to
separate us all out.

387
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:16,921
They'll send her to Africa.

388
00:37:18,721 --> 00:37:19,881
Yeah?

389
00:37:20,881 --> 00:37:22,481

...to Egypt, maybe?

393
00:37:35,841 --> 00:37:38,401
Something I never
told you before...

394
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:40,241
...because it wasn't important.

395
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:43,361
Maybe now it is.

396
00:37:44,801 --> 00:37:46,401
Your dad was Jewish.

00:37:48,441 --> 00:37:51,561
He was the son
of a tailor in Stechford.

398

They changed their name
to Thorne

399
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:55,841
to stop the bricks
coming through the window.

400
00:37:57,761 --> 00:37:59,681
So where will they send you,
Karl?

401
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:06,481
Mr Nelson, you can report back
to your president

402
00:38:06,601 --> 00:38:09,401
that the aristocracy
and the meritocracy are united

403
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:12,521
in their conviction
that a new order is coming.

404
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:16,641
Also, Mr Nelson, at present

405
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:19,241
our weapons are coming
from Germany.

406
00:38:19,361 --> 00:38:21,481
The British are closing
our supply lines down.

407
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:23,961
We would value
a supply from Boston.

408
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:26,521
Weapons I can give you,

409
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:28,721
if they're to be used
in a good cause.

410
00:38:28,841 --> 00:38:31,721
And while on the subject
of import and export,

411
00:38:31,841 --> 00:38:33,081
Mr Shelby,

412
00:38:33,201 --> 00:38:35,361
in light of
our new relationship

413
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:37,521
and since you have
proven your commitment

414
00:38:37,641 --> 00:38:39,321
in a most extraordinary way...

415
00:38:40,321 --> 00:38:42,241
...Boston is now
officially open

416
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,721

of your merchandise.

...and I want to know
what is decided.

493
00:47:11,961 --> 00:47:13,641
And if I lie?

494
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:17,001
I will know.

495
00:47:25,881 --> 00:47:28,401
You know, Michael thinks
you're the devil...

496
00:47:29,561 --> 00:47:31,921
...and I think he might
actually be right.

497
00:47:33,361 --> 00:47:35,321
That was the other reason
I came here.

498
00:47:35,441 --> 00:47:39,041
What are Michael's real
intentions toward me, Gina?

499

...he intends
to complete the deal.

502
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:54,681
And then you both walk away.

You said it had to be
in person. Here I am.

You might want to sit down.

512
00:50:04,161 --> 00:50:05,401
Mr Shelby, I know

513
00:50:05,521 --> 00:50:07,921
that you are still
grieving for your daughter...

514
00:50:08,921 --> 00:50:10,961
...but I have news
that cannot wait.

515
00:50:16,001 --> 00:50:18,881
When you were X-rayed
and examined

516
00:50:19,001 --> 00:50:21,481
at the sanatorium
ten days ago...

517
00:50:23,201 --> 00:50:26,521
...there was no TB
found in your lung.

518
00:50:28,521 --> 00:50:30,761
But I am afraid
they found something else...

519
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:34,601
...something related to
your daughter's illness.

520
00:50:37,921 --> 00:50:40,761
They tried to speak to you
at the hospital

521
00:50:40,881 --> 00:50:42,641
but you were not co-operating.

522
00:50:44,721 --> 00:50:46,921
After your daughter's death...

523
00:50:47,041 --> 00:50:49,761
...you could not be found
to be informed in person.

524
00:50:50,761 --> 00:50:54,281
Eventually, as your personal
doctor, they called me.

525
00:50:57,401 --> 00:50:58,641
I didn't offer you tea.

526
00:50:58,761 --> 00:51:00,921
You look like death.
Do you want tea?

527
00:51:02,121 --> 00:51:03,321
No.

528
00:51:04,921 --> 00:51:07,841
At the sanatorium,
they conducted blood tests.

529
00:51:09,841 --> 00:51:13,201
The tests suggest
that the shadow you can see

530
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:15,521
at the base of your skull...

531
00:51:15,641 --> 00:51:17,121
...is not cancer...

532
00:51:18,481 --> 00:51:20,041
...it is tuberculoma...

533
00:51:22,401 --> 00:51:26,001
...a tubercular growth caused
by the same bacteria as TB.

534
00:51:29,641 --> 00:51:32,161
You may have picked it up
from your daughter.

535
00:51:33,761 --> 00:51:37,881
Once this disease enters
a household, it can run wild.

536
00:51:38,001 --> 00:51:40,521
It can be transmitted
with a simple kiss.

537
00:51:44,681 --> 00:51:47,321
It seems the Shelby household
is no exception.

538
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:55,921
Mr Shelby, as I say, I am aware
that you are still grieving...

539
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:59,241
...but you must understand
this is very serious.

540
00:52:01,481 --> 00:52:04,801
From the size of the tumour,
expansion must have been rapid.

541
00:52:06,121 --> 00:52:10,521
I have no doubt that you are
already experiencing symptoms.

542
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:13,721
Have you recently
suffered seizures?

543
00:52:15,001 --> 00:52:16,601
Bouts of weakness?

544
00:52:16,721 --> 00:52:19,121

00:52:19,241 --> 00:52:20,561

546
00:52:28,601 --> 00:52:30,281
Why didn't you come and see me?

547
00:52:32,881 --> 00:52:34,121
I have work to do.

548
00:52:38,201 --> 00:52:40,001
Am I a danger to others?

549
00:52:41,481 --> 00:52:42,961
No.

550
00:52:43,081 --> 00:52:46,681
Unlike TB, tuberculoma
is not infectious.

551
00:52:46,801 --> 00:52:50,721
Mr Shelby,
it is not infectious...

552
00:52:50,841 --> 00:52:52,961
...but in your case...

553
00:52:53,081 --> 00:52:55,521
...I am afraid
it is inoperable.

554
00:52:57,161 --> 00:52:59,041
The growth is
in your brain stem.

555
00:52:59,161 --> 00:53:00,561
Any attempt to remove it

556
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:03,321
would result in trauma
and brain haemorrhage.

557
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:09,401
Whilst you were
refusing my calls,

558
00:53:09,521 --> 00:53:10,641
I showed your X-rays

559
00:53:10,761 --> 00:53:13,281
to three of the best surgeons
in the country.

560
00:53:16,801 --> 00:53:18,881
They all said
they would not operate...

561
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:22,161
...as it would be futile.

562
00:53:22,281 --> 00:53:25,681
Of course, you will want

563
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:28,361
a second opinion for yourself.

How bad will it get?

569
00:53:55,401 --> 00:53:57,561
As the tumour grows,

570
00:53:57,681 --> 00:54:01,441
the rate of physical and mental
deterioration will increase.

571
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:10,721
Eventually, you will need
people around you constantly...

I understand
that you have defeated

00:54:22,641 --> 00:54:24,041
many enemies, Mr Shelby.

576
00:54:25,241 --> 00:54:27,321
Now you have a new one...

577
00:54:27,441 --> 00:54:28,761
...inside you.

578
00:54:30,281 --> 00:54:31,681
