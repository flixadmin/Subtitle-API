1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,120
<i>I have walked this earth
for centuries.</i>

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,800
Only you can kill me,
and only with that dagger.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,960
- What did I say?
- I can help you get Tabitha back.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,800
Professor Hugo Strange
is the one man who can cure you.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,240
Join me, and we will find him.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,160
Okay, but you'd better deliver.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,560
Why would I help you?

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,960
You love me.
You've loved me all along.

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,760
What's your record for how many banks
you've robbed in one day?

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,600
<i>You're playing a dangerous game, Lee.</i>

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,360
<i>Ra's al Ghul chose you
to pass on his spirit.</i>

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,400
<i>We have much more to show you.</i>

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,800
<i>All my life, I have known
that I was meant for more.</i>

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,040
<i>This isn't you.</i>

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,600
I'm not gonna
let your jealousy distract me.

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,240
Ladies, escort Miss Galavan
to the street.

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,200
<i>We serve the one
and only true master, Ra's al Ghul.</i>

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,000
- But he's dead.
- Death is only an illusion.

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,440
- What the hell?
- You didn't sense our approach?

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,840
No, you're ninjas.

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,400
The Demon's Head gives
its bearer power

23
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,680
to see past, present, future as one.

24
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,400
You should have anticipated
our attack.

25
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,880
So, this was a test?

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,560
I'm the Demon's Head.
My hand is a fricking lightbulb.

27
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,120
That is only its mark.

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,560
You have yet to access
its real powers.

29
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,040
So, you're questioning
whether I'm worthy?

30
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,000
I am sick of this.

31
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,520
The men from the League,
Tabitha, and now you.

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,160
You misunderstand.

33
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,400
How do you think Ra's al Ghul became
the world's most fearsome warrior

34
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,840
and ruled empires?

35
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,440
He saw the future.

36
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,640
So, attacking me was what?
A way to jump-start it?

37
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,520
Like, "Hey, Demon's Head,
snap to it"?

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,240
The powers of the Demon's Head
are triggered by intense emotions.

39
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,080
All right. So next time,
don't go so easy on me.

40
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,560
And take that knife out of my face.

41
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,680
You don't have
a covert mode on this thing?

42
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,360
Show-off.

43
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,360
So, you gonna tell me
what Tabitha needs us for?

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,040
All I know is, it's about Barbara
and it's important.

45
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,600
- So, what's the emergency?
- Inside.

46
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,160
You coming?

47
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,920
Tabitha, what am I doing here?

48
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,160
- What the hell?
- Wait.

49
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,400
What the hell? What is this?

50
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,080
I don't know.
She didn't tell me this part.

51
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,680
Barbara needs our help.
She's gonna get herself killed.

52
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,640
She has this thing called
the Demon's Head.

53
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,280
- This is about Ra's al Ghul?
- He is the one who gave it to her.

54
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,920
These guys are gonna help us
take it back.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,880
Okay, so, why do you need Bruce?

56
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,040
You're gonna bring him back.

57
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,000
You can't do this.
Ra's wanted to die.

58
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,600
He wanted me to kill him.

59
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,840
And now we need him alive.

60
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,280
No. No. No!

61
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,440
No! No!

62
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,760
Bone, flesh, breath.
Come back to us, our leader.

63
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,600
Now, we close the circle.

64
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,120
We give you the blood of the one
who slew you.

65
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
No!

66
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,360
You have no idea what you've don...

67
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,280
{\an5}Five banks in one night?
You're joking.

68
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,760
{\an5}I wish these guys were slick.

69
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,880
{\an5}Banks didn't even know
they were hit till they opened.

70
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,360
{\an5}One of the banks,
the thieves came in on boats

71
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,520
{\an5}through the sewer.
Tunneled into one of the vaults.

72
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,440
{\an5}All branches
of Gotham Savings and Loan.

73
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,560
{\an5}Why the same banks?

74
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,360
Maybe a leak in security?
Maybe a grudge.

75
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,840
{\an5}Five banks in one night.

76
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,080
{\an5}It's like someone was trying
to make a point.

77
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,440
{\an5}Prove how smart he is.

78
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,880
- Ed Nygma?
- If the bowler fits.

79
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,640
{\an5}Should I put out a BOLO on him?

80
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,840
{\an5}Sure. In the meantime,
there's someone else I can talk to.

81
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,520
{\an5}Say hey to Lee for me, won't you?
Tell her nice shooting with Sofia.

82
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,360
{\an5}- What, I can't make a joke?
- That's what that was?

83
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,880
{\an5}Why don't you put that BOLO out?

84
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,480
{\an5}Let's see your hand.

85
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,640
{\an5}- This is for you. Enjoy it.
- Good.

86
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,440
{\an5}- Hey.
- Hey.

87
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,840
{\an5}Thanks.

88
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,920
Look at them.

89
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,800
{\an5}We did good.

90
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,600
{\an5}Oh, yeah. My brilliance allowed us
to rob five banks in one night.

91
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,280
{\an5}Now, the fine folks of The Narrows
will be drowning in booze

92
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,080
{\an5}and smokes for years to come.

93
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,720
{\an5}So inspiring.

94
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,080
{\an5}They're also gonna use the money
to buy food,

95
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,840
{\an5}and clothing, and medicine.

96
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,360
{\an5}What's wrong?

97
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,800
{\an5}What am I to you?

98
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,160
{\an5}A friend. A partner.

99
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,320
{\an5}Are you always this amorous
with your friends?

100
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,360
- I know it only happened once...
- Ed...

101
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,920
{\an5}- Don't call me Ed.
- Hey.

102
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,520
{\an5}I care about you. I depend on you.

103
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,480
{\an5}You know, what we've got planned.

104
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,880
{\an5}Other things are just gonna have
to wait.

105
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,920
{\an5}You're not stringing me along,
are you, Lee?

106
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,360
{\an5}Don't you wanna find out?

107
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,200
{\an5}The answer to the riddle?

108
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,240
Maybe I do.

109
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,120
Are we good for tomorrow night?

110
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,840
Yeah, we just have
a few last details.

111
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,440
And trust me, this is going
to be a work of art.

112
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,520
That sounds promising.

113
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,480
Oh, what the hell? Count us in.

114
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,640
- You could've told me.
- You wouldn't have brought him.

115
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,720
- Yeah, because he's my friend.
- What is Barbara? What am I?

116
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,840
Pick a side and stick to it.

117
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,720
Do you know what you've done?

118
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,680
The years, I spent planning my death.

119
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,960
- Now, you've ruined it!
- Master,

120
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,960
the woman you gave
the Demon's Head to,

121
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,040
- she started a war.
- I started that war!

122
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,040
The League of Shadows was rotten.

123
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,840
Only through violence
could it be reborn!

124
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,040
Master, our lives are yours to take.

125
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,160
But this woman does not serve
the League.

126
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,640
Her goals are limited, selfish.

127
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,160
That's Barbara, all right.

128
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,600
Whatever faith you had
in her was misplaced.

129
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,000
If she keeps the Demon's Head,
the League shall die.

130
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,680
Wait, what do you mean
if she keeps the Demon's Head?

131
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,360
I thought you were supposed to get it
the second you

132
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,080
- came back.
- No.

133
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,000
Barbara must give it to me.

134
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,600
She'll never do that.

135
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,480
Then, I'll kill her
and rip it from her corpse.

136
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,480
You owe us.

137
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,200
I... I'm sorry. We owe you how?

138
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,360
Because we made you. Both of you.

139
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,880
Without me,
you would still be trapped inside Ed.

140
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,520
And you would still be stitching up
busted lips ringside.

141
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,880
I need money
to buy back Sofia's capos.

142
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,840
Butch is saving
for future medical expenses.

143
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,560
What'd you make last night?
Three, four million?

144
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,120
Say we go halvsies.

145
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,880
I've heard your offer.

146
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,520
And here's my counter, bite me.

147
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,240
I don't like people coming
into my club,

148
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,520
telling me what to do.

149
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,480
And I don't like threats,
implicit or otherwise.

150
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,280
And I really don't like people
telling me they made me.

151
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,280
Well, said, Lee.

152
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,880
Oh, god. Are you kidding me?

153
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,680
- What?
- Okay, we're done.

154
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,640
I... I... I thought you got past
all that

155
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,000
- when you became the Riddler.
- Past what?

156
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,960
Ed's pathetic adoration of her.

157
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,680
But no.
Clearly, he passed it along you.

158
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,480
Like a virus.

159
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,800
She knows it and she's using you.

160
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,440
Shame on you,
stringing along this troubled man.

161
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,760
- Get out.
- I don't think so.

162
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,400
We did not come here for violence.

163
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,240
We came here hoping
our friends would honor their debts.

164
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,080
Let us hope they come to our senses.

165
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,920
A little advice.

166
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,160
Be sure to skim some off the top
when she tosses you aside.

167
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,560
Kind of defeats the purpose
if I can hear you.

168
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,760
Hello, Barbara.

169
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Ra's.

170
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,320
Don't be afraid.

171
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,400
What happened?

172
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,200
- How are you even...
- It's a long story.

173
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,200
But tell me,
what have you done with my gift?

174
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,320
Well, you might have left a how-to.

175
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,080
Plus a heads-up
to your League of Shadows cronies.

176
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,120
Turns out the old boys club don't
appreciate a woman calling the shots.

177
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,320
But you have plans?

178
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,200
On rebuilding the League of Shadows?

179
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,320
You're read...

180
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,600
the histories that I left for you?

181
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,600
I've read them,
but I need to do my own thing.

182
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,600
Your own thing?

183
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,800
With the power you gave me,

184
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,480
I can rule Gotham
like no one ever has before.

185
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,120
The people will worship me
like a queen.

186
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,440
How disappointing.

187
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,840
You're right.
They should worship me like a god.

188
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Enough.

189
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,880
Give me your hand
so that I can take it back.

190
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,520
No, it is mine. You promised me!

191
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,560
I was mistaken in you, Barbara.

192
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,280
Mistaken? Tell that to her.

193
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,000
You think that is you?

194
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,000
She was just a whore.

195
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,000
I killed her out of pity.

196
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,840
You're lying.

197
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,240
The Demon's Head is my destiny.

198
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,560
Then why have you not
unlocked its secrets?

199
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,800
You sad, deluded woman.

200
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,000
You thought you were
a reincarnated queen.

201
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,480
But in truth,

202
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,400
you're just
an unstable nightclub owner,

203
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,400
whose greatest accomplishment
was the murder of her own parents.

204
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,600
You are nothing.

205
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,600
Now, give me your hand.

206
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,640
Or I will kill you
and take the Demon's Head by force.

207
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,400
Try it, zombie-boy.

208
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,320
Get her out of here. Go!

209
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,560
I'm fine.

210
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,400
Get in!

211
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,840
All right. You know, the rules.

212
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,360
Hands only. No, drinking water.
I want a good clean eat.

213
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,000
Ready? Ready?

214
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,800
- All right. Yeah, go.
- Yeah, come on.

215
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,280
- Come on, eat it, eat it.
- Come, come, come on.

216
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,360
I'm looking for Lee Thompkins.

217
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,640
- Come on, eat.
- The Doc?

218
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Lee?

219
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,200
- The winner!
- Jim.

220
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,640
You don't look like a guy
who got shot four times.

221
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,520
Because you were able
to keep me alive.

222
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,560
- Thanks.
- I'd just shot Sofia Falcone

223
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,360
in the head.
I was in a good mood.

224
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,240
I'm looking for Ed Nygma.

225
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,280
Five banks were robbed last night.

226
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,400
Has all the hallmarks
of an Nygma special.

227
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,760
Haven't seen Ed in weeks.

228
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,760
I know you feel loyalty towards him,

229
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,240
but you, of all people,
should know he's sick.

230
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,880
- He's a psychopath.
- We all have our flaws.

231
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
Lee.

232
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,560
I can understand why you're here.

233
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,120
But there are other ways
of finding absolution.

234
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
You can't take ownership
of everyone's problems.

235
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,120
This is The Narrows.

236
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,640
Nobody owns anything down here
but the slumlords.

237
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,320
Try going after the real criminals.

238
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,760
The people making money
off the backs of the poor.

239
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,640
You mean like
Gotham Savings and Loan?

240
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
None of the guards were killed.

241
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,880
The more I think about it,

242
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,240
it doesn't exactly feel
like Ed Nygma.

243
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,480
- Or not just him.
- If we're done here...

244
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,600
Whatever's happened.

245
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,920
You can always call me.
I can help.

246
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,640
You really don't get it, do you, Jim?

247
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,800
It was good to see you.

248
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,840
Ra's just tried to kill me
because of you.

249
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,640
You could've just given him
the Demon's Paw.

250
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,840
Head!

251
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,720
It's the Demon's Head,
and it is mine!

252
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,320
You betrayed me.

253
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,640
I was trying to save you from myself.

254
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,960
Also, the other day,
you actually told your thugs

255
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,720
- to kill me.
- It was a spanking.

256
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,040
If I wanted you dead, I would've

257
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,200
- done it...
- Oh, shut up, both of you!

258
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,080
We're wasting time.
Ra's could be on his way right now.

259
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,400
Which wouldn't be a problem
if she'd give him what he wants.

260
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,440
- Never gonna happen.
- So, what should we do, Barbara?

261
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,840
We just gonna walk around
with targets on our back?

262
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,480
No, we're gonna kill
the son of a bitch.

263
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,520
The kid did it before, right?

264
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,440
Yeah, but that was different.
We had a special knife.

265
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,880
That one you got from auction.

266
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,200
- Where is it?
- We gave it back

267
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,960
- to the Nanda Parbat embassy.
- Great.

268
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,520
So, we'll do a little smash and grab

269
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,840
and then I'll filet the zombie.

270
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,600
I have to be the one holding
the knife.

271
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,880
It's part of the ritual.

272
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Like the blood.

273
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,080
I have to kill him again.

274
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,600
Even if that's the case,
Master Bruce.

275
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
I can't allow you to do it.

276
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,840
- Not again.
- We might not get

277
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,000
another chance, Alfred.

278
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,160
This is the only way.

279
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,720
Says you, the mystical knife expert.
I've got the Demon's Head.

280
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,600
I bet if I'm holding it in my hand.

281
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,200
What if killing Ra's
unlocks my powers?

282
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,400
Yeah, and what if you fail
and Ra's gets the knife back?

283
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,640
We'll worry
about who kills him later.

284
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,360
Right now, we have to get
the knife before Ra's does.

285
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,840
Embassies are heavily guarded,
and we can't wait till night.

286
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,920
We're gonna need guns,
smoke grenades to cause a diversion.

287
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,280
If I may,
there may be another option.

288
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,960
But you gotta guarantee, you're
not gonna stab us in the back...

289
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,080
again.

290
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,680
So, in short,
we'd like to thank you very much.

291
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,400
Both of us would like to thank you
for taking such good,

292
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,160
such good care of her.

293
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,960
But now, we'd like
to take the knife home, please.

294
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,840
Well, it, it was never yours
to begin with, Mr. Pennyworth.

295
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,640
It belongs to my people.

296
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,280
When Mr. Bruce Wayne
purchased it at auction,

297
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,520
he was rescuing
a looted historical treasure.

298
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,440
That's why you returned it to us.

299
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,840
Yeah, but it was a loan,
wasn't it, mate?

300
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,080
It was never meant as a keepsie.

301
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,480
This knife is worth millions,
and you just gave it away?

302
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,880
- You idiot.
- Easy, muffin.

303
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,920
Look, you look like you got
a stable head on your shoulders.

304
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,200
Why don't I make a little donation,

305
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,600
and you give us the knife

306
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,920
and we walk away?

307
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,480
Does Bruce Wayne
even know about this?

308
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,960
Whatever your agenda is

309
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,480
I believe that you
and your chippie should leave.

310
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,120
A chippie?

311
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,680
Did you just call my missus
a chippie?

312
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,440
What is that, like...

313
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,560
What... a chippie? Is that a
new term or someth... Something?

314
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
-Sir?
- What?

315
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,240
- What? What's happening?
- What, what?

316
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,040
- I can't breathe.
-Oh, my god.

317
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,040
- I think he's having a heart attack.
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

318
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,000
He's having a heart attack!
Look at what you did.

319
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,400
Tell security it's a false alarm.

320
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,520
- I can't breathe.
- A false alarm.

321
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,640
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
- Give me your jacket.

322
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,800
- Put your jacket under his head.
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

323
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,880
Put your jacket.

324
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,480
It really hurts.
It really, it really hurts.

325
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,720
Put your head back.

326
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,480
- Are you breathing? Deep breaths.
- All right?

327
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,840
- Just breathe.
- It really hurts.

328
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,240
- Stay with me.
- I feel much better now.

329
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,400
Sorry about the fuss, fellas.

330
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,440
Chippie.

331
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,560
<i>I think she's using you.</i>

332
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,200
<i>Shame on you.
Stringing along this troubled man.</i>

333
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,680
"This troubled man."

334
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,240
Who can't argue with that.

335
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,320
Oh, no.

336
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,680
Sorry, just because you're in charge
doesn't mean I disappear.

337
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,080
That's because you're too stupid
to know when you've lost.

338
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,560
Have I?

339
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,080
"Lee, what am I to you?"

340
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,480
Does that sound like you to you?
Because to me,

341
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,080
that sounds like me.

342
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,560
I'm not proud of that phrasing.

343
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,560
I'm inside you, buddy. Like a virus.

344
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,200
- Infecting your thoughts.
- Oh, please.

345
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,440
You couldn't even begin
to comprehend my thoughts,

346
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,200
much less influence them.

347
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,200
What about your feelings?
How else would you explain those

348
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,840
desperate attempts
to gain her approval?

349
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,440
No. No.
If anything, she's the one who...

350
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,800
You gave money away to the poor.

351
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,560
- That was part of a larger plan.
- Yeah, her plan.

352
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,640
What did you ever care about

353
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,320
- The Narrows?
- I don't.

354
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,120
Every person here could drown
in a stew of their own filth

355
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,120
and I wouldn't lose a wink of sleep.

356
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Oh, I know.

357
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,600
Because all you care about is her.

358
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,680
Just like I did.
So, keep that up, buddy.

359
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,440
Because soon, there'll be no telling
where you end and I begin.

360
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,720
That's not gonna happen.

361
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,640
Well done. Now, knife, please.

362
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,640
Selina, it has to be me.

363
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
Selina.

364
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,040
Give me the knife.

365
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,640
And you'd better scram
while you still can.

366
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,080
I'm taking the knife.

367
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,760
You do not wanna make me angry, kid.

368
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,920
Sorry, muffin.
I need you to step back.

369
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,440
Don't you even go there, love.

370
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,800
- Selina, don't give her the knife.
- Let's screw this.

371
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,480
Your arrogance is gonna get
someone killed.

372
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,840
- Don't you know?
- Or just you.

373
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,920
- What?
- Stop.

374
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,200
Thank you.

375
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,360
Now, get in!

376
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,040
Selina, let's go.

377
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,520
Nice doing business with you, boys.

378
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
You were right.

379
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,800
She's using me.

380
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,640
Finally.

381
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,920
- So much for you being smart now.
- No.

382
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,840
The most brilliant minds are often
blind to the most obvious truths.

383
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,920
Fine.

384
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,200
- And you came to me.
- Because that love-struck moron, Ed,

385
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,560
is floating down a river of dopamine

386
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,960
deep within the primitive
reward circuit of my brain.

387
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,440
And I need you to help me drown him
for good.

388
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,760
Did you bring the half share
of profits we asked for?

389
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,120
That money's gone.

390
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,800
Distributed among the riff-raff
of The Narrows, but...

391
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,240
those five banks

392
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,800
were merely the first stage
of a very sophisticated plan.

393
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,160
And the <i>coup de grâce</i> is tonight.

394
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,800
I knew you were scheming something.

395
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,680
That's why we were gonna
rob you afterward.

396
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,520
But I prefer this way.

397
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,600
There better be enough in there
to get me fixed.

398
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,720
- Don't forget our deal.
- I won't.

399
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,520
Thank you so much.
And how big is the score?

400
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,240
About 100 million...

401
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,440
A piece.

402
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,320
And you help me deal
with Lee Thompkins.

403
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,240
Thank you for coming back.

404
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,160
We serve the Demon's Head, Barbara.

405
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,600
- So, what's the play?
- Simple.

406
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,680
I do the flashlight hand thingy,
summon Ra's.

407
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,840
Little stabby-stab with the knife.
Send him back to hell.

408
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,760
Think I can remember that.

409
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,200
You can't be serious.
That's your plan?

410
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,080
How do you expect
to get the drop on someone

411
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,800
who's studied Kung Fu for 2000 years
and is a zombie?

412
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,960
I'm not feeling a lot of faith here,
kitty cat.

413
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,160
Maybe I'd have more,

414
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,520
if you knew
how to use your Demon Head

415
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,240
for something other
than a flashlight.

416
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,200
- You're gonna get us killed.
- Got any useful suggestions?

417
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,400
- Maybe call backup.
- I did. Here they are.

418
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,200
What if Bruce is right?
Let him use the knife.

419
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,760
At least we know
that it worked before.

420
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,920
You just took the knife from him.

421
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,560
Because you told me to pick a side.
I thought you had a plan other than,

422
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,440
"Let's stab the immortal undead guy
and hope for the best."

423
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,120
Listen, Selina,
we're strongest when we're together.

424
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,360
- Now, are you in, or are you out?
- If it's suicide by Ra's, I'm out.

425
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,640
Fine then. Go!

426
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,640
What if she's right?

427
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,760
I can't control the Demon's Head.

428
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,720
Maybe it's like Ra's said.
Maybe I am just a nightclub owner.

429
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,800
I should have never trusted
those men.

430
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,640
I didn't want you to have
the Demon's Head.

431
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,040
I'm not even sure I want it now.

432
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,160
Three years we've been together,
on and off.

433
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,600
And I've never seen
you doubt yourself.

434
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,360
So, however you wanna play this,
I'm in.

435
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,000
But if you're saying
you're not worthy,

436
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,840
that's where I jump ship.

437
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,640
Let's do this.

438
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,640
I suppose on the bright side,
you won't have to kill him.

439
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,600
Again.

440
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,360
- Except I'm the only one who can.
- So said, Ra's.

441
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,080
I mean, no disrespect to your
magical daggers in order to that,

442
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,160
but I'd love to see what would happen

443
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,120
if I pulled his head off
his bloody shoulders.

444
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,600
I can't believe Selina gave
Barbara the knife.

445
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,200
Yeah, well,
at least we know where she stands.

446
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,440
That's what you think.

447
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,680
Oh, you got
a bloody cheek turning up here.

448
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,640
I gave Barbara the knife

449
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,640
because if there was a chance
she could use it,

450
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,000
I wanted her to.

451
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,400
- So Bruce didn't have to kill him.
- I would've done what I had to.

452
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,440
And gone back to being the douchebag
you've been the last few months.

453
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,720
So, no, thank you.

454
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,120
She's got a point there,
Master Bruce.

455
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,400
Thanks for the explanation.
You can leave now.

456
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,600
- Bruce.
- You sided with them.

457
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,400
Why does it have to be about sides?

458
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,240
There is somebody, something,
out there that needs to be stopped.

459
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,600
So, why can't we focus on that?

460
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,400
Another good point.

461
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,960
Barbara and Tabitha are gonna
get themselves killed.

462
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,960
And I don't want that to happen.

463
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,120
There were easier banks to hit.

464
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,600
- Why yours?
- I keep telling you, I have no idea.

465
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,040
I'm a victim.
You're treating me like a criminal.

466
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,520
Yeah, I wonder
where we get that from.

467
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,120
- Excuse me?
- We did some digging.

468
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,360
You bank has been investigated
for redlining,

469
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,960
- usury, illegal foreclosures.
- And cleared on all counts.

470
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,160
- You have good lawyers.
- So, we deserve to be robbed?

471
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,080
- I'm done here.
- Ma'am,

472
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,600
can you give us a second, please?

473
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,560
- What the hell are you doing?
- She's a crook.

474
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,960
A bigger crook than
whoever ripped her off.

475
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,400
You mean Lee?

476
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,840
Look, brother,
I know what this is about.

477
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,880
You went down to The Narrows
and came back all fired up, okay.

478
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,840
But alienating her
is not gonna help us.

479
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,680
If Lee's involved with Nygma,
we gotta stop it before it goes bad.

480
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,160
Which of your branches
are the most vulnerable?

481
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,240
As of this afternoon, none of them.

482
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,440
We have a security protocol

483
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,680
after the Arkham breakout
and the robberies.

484
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,640
You moved your assets
to a secure location.

485
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,400
Yes, of course. All 45 branches.
This morning.

486
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,520
It's totally safe.
Fortified and heavily guarded.

487
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,640
Where is it?

488
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,960
- Pistol would've been more fun.
- You indulge me.

489
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,080
Breaking open the vault
is the last detail.

490
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,800
- Big detail. How did you solve it?
- Little help from some friends.

491
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,360
I'm the revealer of masks.

492
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,520
When I appear, friend becomes foe.

493
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,560
And the one that you love
becomes the one that you hate.

494
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,240
- What am I?
- Betrayal.

495
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,640
Hello, Lee.

496
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,600
Yeah, it's not a dart gun. Let's go.

497
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,480
- Nice entrance.
- I do hope you've reconsidered

498
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,640
and are planning
to give me what I want.

499
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,680
I've thought about it,
a lot and about us.

500
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,600
We had something, didn't we?

501
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,880
Back when you were less dug-uppy.

502
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,080
I do not have time for this.

503
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,240
I will give you what you want, Ra's.

504
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,600
But I want you to admit
we had a connection,

505
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,320
and that those things you said to me

506
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,480
were just mind games
to make me lose my nerve.

507
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,240
You want me to tell you
that you're special.

508
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,640
- Would that be so hard?
- No.

509
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,200
And moreover, it's true.
You are special.

510
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,400
I'm just sorry it had
to come to this, Barbara.

511
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,120
Me too.

512
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,360
But thank you for saying that.

513
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,080
She must do this by herself.

514
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,280
Barbara, fight.

515
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,000
This is Barbara's fight.

516
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,880
This is Barbara's fight.

517
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,280
- Well, now, look at you.
- Yeah, look at me.

518
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,440
You wanna give it another shot?

519
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,440
She's mastered the Demon's Head.

520
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,720
I can see why he likes this thing.

521
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,800
That's enough.

522
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,200
Give me what I want,
or your friend dies.

523
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,240
- I thought this was between us.
- Choose, now.

524
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,040
Tabby, I...

525
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,840
I can't give this up.

526
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,680
No!

527
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,880
That's enough. Choose. Now.

528
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,400
You win.

529
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,040
Just don't hurt her.

530
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,360
Barbara Kean,
you surprise me yet again.

531
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,520
Maybe I wasn't mistaken
in you after all.

532
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,480
No.

533
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,720
Give me the knife, Ra's.

534
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,120
Let me kill you.

535
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,560
Today is not the day that I die.

536
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,760
This is the price
for taking advantage of me, Lee.

537
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,760
You're wrong, Ed. I wasn't using you.

538
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,640
Again, don't call me Ed.
And I'm not wrong about you.

539
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,720
Truck is almost full.

540
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,160
- We should go.
- Tell the Ogre.

541
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,800
Have him leave the property deeds.
They all belong to The Narrows.

542
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,000
Worthless.

543
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,200
And so ends the tale
of the queen of The Narrows.

544
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,600
Goodbye, Lee.

545
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,600
- What are you doing?
- How did that go again?

546
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,240
"I'm the revealer of masks.
When I appear, friend becomes foe."

547
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,800
- Betrayal.
- Exactly.

548
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,800
What the hell are you doing?

549
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,320
Just burning The Narrows
property deeds.

550
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,400
Not that!

551
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,240
He's proving his love
by betraying us.

552
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,080
These bars can't hold me.

553
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,680
- When I get out...
- We'll be gone.

554
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,120
I just wanted you to hear something.

555
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,960
Oswald, we've been through
thick and thin,

556
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,000
and I hold no grudge on you.

557
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,640
But you come against Lee,
and you come against me.

558
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,440
I'm gonna dismember you, you twerp.

559
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,200
Yes, not even gonna try with you.

560
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,960
- Let's go, Lee.
- It won't make any difference.

561
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,640
She's still using you.

562
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,640
You are not The Riddler,
you are a fool!

563
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,600
Why do that?

564
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,400
Why bring Penguin and Grundy

565
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,920
if you're just gonna
lock them inside?

566
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,440
I needed Grundy to open the vault.

567
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,520
And Oswald was gonna rob us anyway,
so I just kept an eye on him.

568
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,160
He'll get over it. Or he won't.

569
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,960
So, you don't think I'm using you?

570
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,120
No, I know you are.

571
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,680
Then why would you betray
your friends for me?

572
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Is this,

573
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,680
- are you Ed?
- No, I'm me.

574
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,600
- How can you be sure?
- Because Ed didn't understand you.

575
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,720
He didn't see how deeply
you had changed. I do.

576
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,960
I know that, that virus
woke up something deep inside you.

577
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,080
And you let that something loose
when you shot Sofia.

578
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,680
And you love it.

579
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,760
And I love it too.

580
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,200
And I know you that don't feel
the same way about me,

581
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,720
but you will.

582
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,600
And when you do, I will be here.

583
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,400
Ed Nygma, you are a riddle.

584
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,160
That's the nicest thing
someone's said to me.

585
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,920
- That's Jim.
- This alarm just went off.

586
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,880
- He was onto us.
- We can just go out the back.

587
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,400
No, they'll see the truck.
One of us needs to distract them.

588
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,640
- Done.
- No.

589
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,280
I can handle Jim Gordon.

590
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,920
You take the money to The Narrows.

591
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
You trust me?

592
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,480
I do.

593
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,560
Go.

594
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,000
<i>G.C.P.D. Nygma,
we know you're in there.</i>

595
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,600
<i>Come out with your hands up.</i>

596
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,240
Sweet, merciful mother.

597
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,440
You know, your rights.

598
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,200
You'd have done the same for me.

599
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,440
Ladies.

600
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,080
I hope this isn't one of those
kill-the-old-queen situations.

601
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,720
We discussed things.
Demon's Head or not, you fought.

602
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,000
Not for yourself,
but those alongside you.

603
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,000
You are worthy, Barbara Kean.

604
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,600
We follow you
to our deaths and beyond.

605
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,040
You can find from Barbara
where the League hides,

606
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,240
temples, safe houses.
He'll be in one of them.

607
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,600
Meanwhile, I'll try to fix the knife.

608
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,360
Yeah, we just take it
to the magic-knife shop.

609
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,680
No, problem.

610
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,040
- Selina, be serious.
- I am.

611
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,440
If Ra's wanted you dead,
you would be.

612
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,880
He obviously likes you.

613
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,840
- It's not about me.
- I know it's not about you.

614
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,320
Gotham has managed
a long time without you.

615
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,840
It can manage a little longer
if you have one night off.

616
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,920
You did good today.

617
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,960
So did you.

618
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,920
Poor timing. Apologies.

619
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,320
I only want to talk.

620
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,720
Alone, please.

621
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,640
I'm staying.

622
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,560
Very well.

623
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,960
She's right, you know, Bruce?

624
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,200
I do like you. Respect you.
Respect you for what you'll become.

625
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,840
- You have no idea what I'll become.
- Of course, I do.

626
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,000
At least, who you could become.

627
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,760
Why are you here?

628
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:27,200
I felt I owed you an explanation
as to why I chose to live.

629
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,360
When I took back the Demon's Head,

630
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,800
I saw a vision...

631
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,960
of a cataclysmic event soon
to befall this city.

632
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,840
- What event?
- A cleansing fire.

633
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,400
It will destroy,

634
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,120
purify,

635
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,960
create.

636
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,360
Create you, Bruce.

637
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,120
Because I will use it
as a mighty forge

638
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,480
molding you into a Dark Knight
of Gotham.

639
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,040
If it doesn't kill you, that is.
