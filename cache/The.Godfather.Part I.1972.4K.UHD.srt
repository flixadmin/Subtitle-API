1
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,750
I believe in America.

2
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,040
America has made my fortune.

3
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,340
And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.

4
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,470
I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonour her family.

5
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,730
She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.

6
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,350
She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

7
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,020
I didn't protest.

8
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,820
Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.

9
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,570
They made her drink whiskey

10
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,620
and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

11
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,460
She resisted, she kept her honour.

12
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,130
So they beat her like an animal.

13
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,340
When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,

14
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,350
her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.

15
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,720
She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.

16
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,660
But I wept. Why did I weep?

17
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,410
She was the light of my life.

18
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,200
Beautiful girl.

19
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,630
Now she will never be beautiful again.

20
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,050
Sorry.

21
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,640
I went to the police,
like a good American.

22
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,940
These two boys were brought to trial.

23
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,030
The judge sentenced them to three years
in prison, but suspended the sentence.

24
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,960
Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!

25
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,950
I stood in the courtroom like a fool.

26
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,670
Those two bastards, they smiled at me.

27
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,800
Then I said to my wife, "For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone."

28
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,150
Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?

29
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,860
What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.

30
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,940
What is that?

31
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,000
I want them dead.

32
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,770
That I cannot do.

33
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,390
I'll give you anything you ask.

34
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:05,270
I've known you many years, but this
is the first time you've asked for help.

35
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,700
I can't remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.

36
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,360
Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.

37
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:21,490
But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.

38
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:25,380
And you were afraid to be in my debt.

39
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,790
I didn't want to get into trouble.

40
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,130
I understand.

41
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,720
You found Paradise in America.

42
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,850
You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.

43
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,020
You didn't need a friend like me.

44
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,900
But now you come to me and say,

45
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,200
"Don Corleone, give me justice."

46
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,160
But you don't ask with respect.

47
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:02,530
You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.

48
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:10,500
You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.

49
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,210
I ask you for justice.

50
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,220
That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.

51
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,310
Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.

52
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,730
How much shall I pay you?

53
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,750
Bonasera, Bonasera.

54
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,920
What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?

55
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,620
If you'd come in friendship,

56
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,000
the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.

57
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:03,230
And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.

58
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,320
And then they would fear you.

59
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,230
Be my friend?

60
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,660
Godfather?

61
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,450
Good.

62
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:32,470
Some day, and that day may never
come, I'll ask a service of you.

63
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,380
But until that day...

64
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,680
...accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.

65
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,680
- Grazie, Godfather.
- Prego.

66
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,520
Give this to Clemenza.

67
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,820
I want people that aren't going to
get carried away.

68
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,080
We're not murderers,
in spite of what this undertaker says.

69
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,610
- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

70
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,820
We're not taking the picture
without Michael.

71
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,160
- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.

72
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,460
Don Barzini.

73
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,820
Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.

74
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,520
Paulie! More wine.

75
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,450
- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?

76
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,580
Take a walk and do your job.

77
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,470
Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.

78
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,550
You watch yourself, all right?

79
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,580
20, 30 grand. In small bills, cash.

80
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,660
In that little silk purse.

81
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,460
If this were somebody else's wedding...
Sfortunato!

82
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,000
Hey, Paulie!

83
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,170
Stupid jerk!

84
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,100
What's the matter?

85
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,660
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.

86
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:31,610
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

87
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,340
Don Corleone, I'm honoured and
grateful that you have invited me.

88
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,430
Get out of here!
It's a private party. Go on!

89
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,100
What is it? It's my sister's wedding.

90
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,900
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!

91
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,200
Come here, come here, come here!

92
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,550
...but towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,

93
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,640
so for six months he's worked
in my pastry shop.

94
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,010
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

95
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,390
Now that the war is over,

96
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,730
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.

97
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:46,150
Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...

98
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:52,500
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.

99
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,860
You understand everything.

100
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,370
Mr Hagen. Thank you.

101
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,290
Wait till you see the wedding cake
I made for your daughter!

102
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,340
The bride, the groom and the angel...

103
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,640
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisá.

104
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:23,190
Give it to a Jew Congressman in
another district. Who else is on the list?

105
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,200
Hey, Michael!

106
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,470
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

107
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,100
Is this necessary?

108
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,360
He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.

109
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:14,620
Don Corleone, I'm honoured and
grateful that you have invited me

110
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:20,250
on the wedding day of your daughter.
May their first child be a masculine child.

111
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,160
Michael...

112
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,750
That man over there
is talking to himself.

113
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,800
See that scary guy over there?

114
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,970
- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?

115
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,090
His name is Luca Brasi.
He helps my father out sometimes.

116
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,810
Michael, he's coming over here!

117
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,860
You look terrific!

118
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,410
My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.

119
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,280
Your father's been asking for you.

120
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,500
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

121
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,790
Why does your brother
have a different name?

122
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,540
My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen
in the street.

123
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:13,000
He had no home,
so my father took him in.

124
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,380
He's been with us ever since.

125
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,180
He's a good lawyer.

126
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:24,940
Not a Sicilian. I think he's
going to be consigliere.

127
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,940
- What's that?
- That's a...

128
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:32,610
...Iike a counsellor, an advisor.
Very important for the family.

129
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,070
You like your lasagne?

130
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,580
Don Corleone.

131
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,160
I'm honoured and grateful

132
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,500
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding.

133
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,420
On the day of your daughter's wedding.

134
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,980
And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.

135
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:08,520
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

136
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:14,980
- For your daughter's bridal purse.
- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.

137
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,620
Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you
now, because I know you're busy.

138
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,870
Thank you.

139
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,380
Signora Corleone!

140
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,380
No!

141
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:32,290
Senator Cauley apologised for not
coming, but said you'd understand.

142
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,880
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.

143
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,250
What is that outside?

144
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,400
Johnny! Johnny!

145
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,690
I love you!

146
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,110
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!

147
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:15,660
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

148
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,590
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!

149
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,480
You never said you knew
Johnny Fontane!

150
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:42,690
- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.

151
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:46,770
- My father helped him with his career.
- He did?

152
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,030
How?

153
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,120
- Let's listen to this song.
- Michael...

154
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,650
Please, Michael. Tell me.

155
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:37,280
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

156
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,080
with a big bandleader.

157
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:45,460
And as his career got better and better,
he wanted to get out of it.

158
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,250
Johnny is my father's godson.

159
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,680
My father went to see this bandleader.

160
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,640
He offered him 10,000 dollars
to let Johnny go,

161
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,350
but the bandleader said no.

162
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:04,110
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

163
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,940
Within an hour,

164
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:14,030
he signed a release
for a certified cheque of 1,000 dollars.

165
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,460
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

166
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,760
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

167
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:31,250
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

168
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,220
That's a true story.

169
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,650
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.

170
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,590
Beautiful!

171
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,580
I'll take care of it.

172
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,420
Tom...

173
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,800
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

174
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,600
How are you, Fredo?

175
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:59,310
My brother Fredo,
this is Kay Adams.

176
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,850
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

177
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,940
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

178
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,240
Yeah. This is your friend?

179
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:17,280
I don't know what to do.
My voice is weak. It's weak.

180
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,450
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

181
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:30,040
But this... man won't give it to me,
the head of the studio.

182
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,380
- What's his name?
- Woltz.

183
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,050
He won't give it to me,
and he says there's no chance.

184
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,770
Sonny?

185
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,060
Sonny?

186
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,360
Sonny?

187
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,360
- Sonny, are you in there?
- What?

188
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,040
The old man wants you.

189
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,410
One minute.

190
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,550
A month ago he bought the movie rights
to this book, a best-seller.

191
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,140
The main character
is a guy just like me.

192
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,190
I wouldn't even have to act.

193
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,150
Godfather, I don't know what to do.

194
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,440
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

195
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:43,080
Is this how you turned out a Hollywood
finocchio, that cries like a woman?

196
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:47,450
"What can I do? What can I do?"
What is that nonsense?

197
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,410
Ridiculous.

198
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,050
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

199
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,760
Good.

200
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:04,130
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.

201
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,520
You look terrible. I want you to eat.

202
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:17,940
Rest, and in a month this Hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.

203
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,240
It's too late, they start shooting
in a week.

204
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:24,740
I'm going to make him an offer
he can't refuse.

205
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:32,920
Just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.

206
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,760
- I want you to leave it all to me.
- All right.

207
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,860
- What time does my daughter leave?
- Soon, after they cut the cake.

208
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,620
Do we give your son-in-law
something important?

209
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,130
Never. Give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him.

210
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,880
- What else?
- Virgil Sollozzo called.

211
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:24,670
- We'll have to see him next week.
- When you come back from California.

212
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,850
- When am I going to California?
- Tonight.

213
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:34,730
I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.

214
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,440
If there's nothing else, I'd like to go
to my daughter's wedding.

215
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:45,120
Carlo, we're going to take the picture.

216
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,000
Wait a minute.

217
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,780
No, Michael. Not me.

218
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,420
Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!

219
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:51,660
- You need a little more heat on that arc.
- Start talking.

220
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,620
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

221
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:58,290
This friend would give
his friendship to Mr Woltz,

222
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,130
if Mr Woltz would grant us a favour.

223
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,580
Woltz is listening.

224
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,930
Give Johnny the part in that war film
you're starting next week.

225
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,440
And what favour would your friend
grant Mr Woltz?

226
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:22,070
He could make your future union
problems disappear.

227
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,190
And one of your stars has just moved
from marijuana to heroin.

228
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:30,570
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!

229
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:35,410
Let me lay it on the line. Johnny
Fontane will never get that movie!

230
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,000
No matter how many Dago Guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!

231
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:43,960
- I'm German-Irish.
- Listen here, my Kraut-Mick friend.

232
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,550
- I'm going to make trouble for you!
- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...

233
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,850
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?

234
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:57,600
I have a special practice. I handle
one client. I'll wait for your call.

235
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,650
By the way, I admire your pictures
very much.

236
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,230
Check him out.

237
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,600
- It's really beautiful.
- Look at this.

238
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:38,270
- It used to decorate a king's palace.
- Very nice.

239
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,150
Why didn't you say
you work for Corleone?

240
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,440
I thought you were some cheap hustler
Johnny was running in.

241
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,570
- I only use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?

242
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,950
- Fine.
- Now I'll show you something beautiful.

243
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,950
You do appreciate beauty, don't you?

244
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,830
There you are.
600,000 dollars on four hoofs.

245
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,740
I bet Russian czars never paid
that for a single horse.

246
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,040
Khartoum.

247
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,000
Khartoum.

248
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:14,710
I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.

249
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,430
Thanks, Tony.

250
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,810
Let's get something to eat.

251
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,470
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

252
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:28,990
To the Italian people that's
a very sacred, close relationship.

253
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,820
I respect it. Tell him to ask me anything
else. This favour I can't give him.

254
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,870
He never asks a second favour
when he's been refused the first.

255
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:44,240
You don't understand. Johnny Fontane
never gets that movie.

256
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:49,090
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

257
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:53,760
I'm going to run him out of the business,
and let me tell you why.

258
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:59,880
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protégés.

259
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:05,260
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

260
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,060
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her, to make her a big star.

261
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,820
Let me be even more frank.

262
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:17,910
To show you that I'm not a hard-hearted
man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

263
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,660
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

264
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:27,030
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

265
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:33,380
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

266
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,170
And she runs off.

267
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,800
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

268
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,900
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

269
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,350
You get the hell out of here!

270
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:52,980
If that goombah tries any rough stuff,
tell him I'm no bandleader.

271
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,230
Yeah, I heard that story.

272
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:01,740
Thank you for dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

273
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,530
Maybe your car can take me
to the airport.

274
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:08,800
Mr Corleone insists on hearing
bad news immediately.

275
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,110
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

276
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,250
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

277
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,620
Now...

278
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:16,880
Sollozzo is known as The Turk. He's
supposed to be very good with a knife,

279
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:21,680
but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.

280
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:24,970
His business is narcotics.

281
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:28,300
He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.

282
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,430
In Sicily he has plants to process them
into heroin.

283
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:36,230
He needs cash, he needs protection
from the police.

284
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,110
He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.

285
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,530
The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.

286
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:51,210
- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy, one here.

287
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,990
He's known as a top narcotics man.

288
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:59,630
- Santino, what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.

289
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,670
Tom?

290
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:06,800
Yes. There's more money in narcotics
than anything else.

291
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:11,590
If we don't get into it, somebody else
will, maybe the five families.

292
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:16,230
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.

293
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,480
Then they come after us.

294
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:24,730
Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great, but narcotics is the future.

295
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:30,660
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in ten years' time.

296
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:38,000
So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?

297
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,090
Don Corleone.

298
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,800
I need a man who has powerful friends.

299
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,560
I need a million dollars in cash.

300
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:58,730
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

301
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,940
- What is the interest for my family?
- 30 per cent.

302
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,280
In the first year your end should be
three, four million dollars.

303
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:11,200
And then it would go up.

304
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:15,000
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

305
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,160
My compliments.

306
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,000
I'll take care of them, out of my share.

307
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:29,960
So I receive 30 per cent for finance,

308
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,470
political influence and legal protection?

309
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,360
That's right.

310
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,350
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

311
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:45,730
If you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance,

312
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:48,740
ti saluto, Don Corleone.

313
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:03,660
I said that I would see you, because
I heard you were a serious man,

314
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,170
to be treated with respect.

315
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:14,380
But, I must say no to you.

316
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:17,930
And I'll give you my reason.

317
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:22,190
It's true, I have a lot of friends in politics.

318
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,030
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

319
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,700
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

320
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:37,490
It doesn't make any difference to me
what a man does for a living.

321
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:42,950
But your business is...
a little dangerous.

322
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:47,220
If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

323
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:51,550
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
- Wait a minute.

324
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:02,850
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children, and I spoil them.

325
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:06,770
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...

326
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:12,150
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to
congratulate you on your new business.

327
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,370
I know you'll do well, and good luck.

328
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:20,740
Especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine. Thank you.

329
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,970
Santino.

330
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,600
Come here.

331
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:53,820
What's the matter with you? Your brain
is going soft from playing with that girl.

332
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:58,580
Never tell anybody outside the family
what you're thinking again.

333
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,370
Go on.

334
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,460
Tom, what's this nonsense?

335
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:11,510
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

336
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,220
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.

337
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,890
And...

338
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,480
...tell Luca Brasi to come in.

339
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,400
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

340
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:34,370
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

341
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:38,160
Go to the Tattaglias.

342
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,580
Make them think that you're not
too happy with our family

343
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,880
and find out what you can.

344
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,890
I got something for your mother
and for Sonny

345
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:12,770
and a tie for Freddy,
and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

346
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:17,120
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.

347
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,810
Andiamo, Fredo.

348
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,440
- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- Okay, Pop.

349
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:57,780
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

350
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,820
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind getting the car.

351
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,030
Buon Natale, caro. Grazie.

352
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:55,090
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.

353
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,100
You know who I am?

354
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:07,510
I know you.

355
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:11,900
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family...right?

356
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:17,940
I think you and I can do business.

357
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,060
I need someone strong like you.

358
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,780
I heard you are not happy...

359
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,200
...with the Corleone family.

360
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,950
Want to join me?

361
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:34,460
What's in it for me?

362
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:38,500
$50,000 to start with.

363
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,050
Not bad!

364
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,300
Agreed?

365
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,280
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

366
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,740
- Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.

367
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,830
Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car.

368
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:03,500
What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.

369
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,340
Get in.

370
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,270
- Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pop.

371
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,490
Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.

372
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:01,160
Would you like me better
if I were a nun? Like in the story.

373
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,250
No.

374
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:09,960
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.

375
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:13,720
Michael.

376
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:19,060
No, I wouldn't like you better if you were
Ingrid Bergman. What's the matter?

377
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,830
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

378
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,350
- Sonny, it's Michael.
- Where have you been?

379
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,190
- Is he all right?
- We don't know yet.

380
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,060
There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.

381
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,450
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

382
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:20,040
- Where have you been? I was worried.
- Didn't Tom tell you I called?

383
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:24,960
No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?

384
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,380
Oh, my God.

385
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:39,510
Sonny!

386
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:50,280
Stay back there.

387
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:53,650
- Who is it?
- Open up, it's Clemenza.

388
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:58,650
There's more news about your old man.

389
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:01,580
Word is out that he's already dead.

390
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:05,410
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!

391
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:08,830
- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.

392
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:11,590
- How often?
- Only three, four times.

393
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,500
- Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.

394
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:20,130
I don't care how sick he is. Bring him
to my father's house right now.

395
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:24,100
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.

396
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:35,110
I'm going to have a couple of our people
come over to the house.

397
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:41,580
- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?

398
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:44,620
- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.

399
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:48,200
In three hours he'll be released
with our proposition.

400
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,670
Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.

401
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:56,460
What's done is done. Don't lose that
famous temper of yours, Sonny.

402
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,840
I'll wait.

403
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:15,320
Your boss is dead.

404
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:22,570
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.

405
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:28,030
I want you to help the Corleones
and me.

406
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:35,460
We got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up.

407
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,260
Drink it.

408
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,090
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

409
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,430
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

410
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:58,350
And you knew
it was the right thing to do.

411
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:04,160
- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction, sure.

412
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:11,040
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.

413
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:16,830
The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.

414
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:22,640
Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don - rest in peace - was slipping.

415
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:28,680
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

416
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:36,730
Well, now he's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

417
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:44,110
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.

418
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,920
It's good business, Tom.

419
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:57,340
I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

420
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:02,180
Yeah, well...

421
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:06,180
Let me worry about Luca.

422
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,180
You just talk to Sonny.

423
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,230
And the other two kids.

424
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,020
- I'll do my best.
- Good.

425
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,660
Now you can go.

426
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,910
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

427
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,920
Blood is a big expense.

428
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,360
He's still alive.

429
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:07,270
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

430
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:12,660
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.

431
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:01,710
Your mother is at the hospital with
your father. Looks like he'll pull through.

432
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:10,000
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip
Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...

433
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:13,140
- You gonna kill all those guys?
- Stay out of it.

434
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:16,310
If you get rid of Sollozzo,
everything falls into line.

435
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,810
What about Luca?
Sollozzo thinks he can control him.

436
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:24,440
If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.

437
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:28,400
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.

438
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:33,360
- Hey, do me a favour...
- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

439
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:40,540
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
What do we do if the old man dies?

440
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:47,010
If we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.

441
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:52,460
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

442
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:57,180
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

443
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,100
If your father dies...

444
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,060
...you make the deal.

445
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,990
- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

446
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,910
What is it?

447
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:20,280
- Paulie, I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.

448
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,790
Tessio, go see what it is.

449
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:28,710
- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

450
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:32,590
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?

451
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:36,260
- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

452
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,150
- Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

453
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:45,770
Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.

454
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:50,320
- Make that the first thing on your list.
- Understood.

455
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:54,860
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

456
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:59,030
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

457
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,870
Hanging around the house on
the phone would be a big help.

458
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:07,840
Try Luca again.

459
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,300
- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.

460
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,300
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

461
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,400
- I'm going.
- When will you be home?

462
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,910
Probably late.

463
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:46,130
- Don't forget the cannoli!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

464
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:52,930
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear-view mirror.

465
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:57,970
Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.

466
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:03,640
We have to find a spot on the
West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.

467
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,360
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.

468
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:11,150
Think while you're driving.
I want to hit New York this month.

469
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,270
Watch the kids.

470
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:29,590
Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up
18 mattresses and bring me the bill.

471
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,210
Yeah, all right.

472
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:35,840
Make sure they're clean, because
the guys will be there a long time.

473
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:40,180
- They're clean and exterminated.
- That's a bad word to use.

474
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:44,260
Exterminate! Watch out,
so we don't exterminate you!

475
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:53,650
Pull over. I've got to take a leak.

476
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:38,700
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

477
00:57:56,930 --> 00:58:00,010
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!

478
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,560
- Yeah.
- Phone call!

479
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,270
- Who is it?
- Some girl.

480
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:18,780
- Hello. Kay?
- How's your father?

481
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:20,730
He's going to make it.

482
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:23,450
I love you.

483
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,160
I love you!

484
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,530
- Michael?
- Yeah, I know.

485
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:32,540
- Tell me you love me.
- I can't talk.

486
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,000
Can't you say it?

487
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,630
I'll see you tonight.

488
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:41,550
Why don't you tell that nice girl
you love her?

489
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:47,390
I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!

490
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:52,310
Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.

491
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:56,140
You start with a little oil,
then fry some garlic.

492
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:01,650
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

493
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:06,990
You get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

494
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:10,500
Add a little bit of wine.

495
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:17,670
And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.

496
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:22,130
Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's Paulie?

497
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,380
You won't see him anymore.

498
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,350
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

499
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,930
- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospital...

500
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:35,310
He'll be all right. Sollozzo knows
he's a civilian.

501
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,230
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

502
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:42,780
Send somebody with him anyway.

503
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:14,310
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?

504
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:20,150
No, Kay. There will be detectives there,
people from the press.

505
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,820
I'll wait in the cab.

506
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,910
I don't want you to get involved.

507
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:33,490
When will I see you again?

508
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:43,050
Go back to New Hampshire, and I'll
call you at your parents' house.

509
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:49,670
- When will I see you again, Michael?
- I don't know.

510
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:05,400
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

511
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:08,700
I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.

512
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,690
What happened to the guards?

513
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:17,070
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.

514
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:20,870
The police made them leave
about ten minutes ago.

515
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,920
Get me Long Beach 45620, please.

516
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:34,470
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

517
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:42,560
Sonny, I'm at the hospital.
I got here late, there's nobody here.

518
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:46,770
No Tessio's men, no detectives,
nobody. Papa's all alone.

519
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,740
- Don't panic.
- I won't panic.

520
01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:54,110
I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.

521
01:03:56,660 --> 01:04:02,370
We're going to move him to another
room. Can you disconnect the tubes?

522
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:06,080
- That's out of the question!
- Do you know my father?

523
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:10,430
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?

524
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:12,760
Help me, please.

525
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:33,460
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo, the baker.

526
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,420
- Remember me?
- Enzo.

527
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,510
You'd better go,
there's going to be trouble.

528
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:44,520
If there is trouble, I'll stay here to
help you. For your father.

529
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:50,400
Listen. Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital, all right?

530
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:52,730
I'll be out in a minute.

531
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:10,960
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

532
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:14,330
I'm with you now.

533
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:17,430
I'm with you.

534
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:55,080
Get rid of these. Come here.

535
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:01,040
Put your hand in your pocket, like you
have a gun. You'll be all right.

536
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,850
You did good.

537
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:45,160
I thought all you Guinea hoods
were locked up!

538
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:49,580
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You little punk!

539
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:53,830
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.

540
01:08:54,040 --> 01:09:00,000
- Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.

541
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:03,720
- Phil, take him in!
- The kid's clean, Captain.

542
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:08,550
- He's a war hero. He's never been...
- I said take him in!

543
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:15,970
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

544
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:18,150
Stand him up straight.

545
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:45,210
I'm the Corleone's attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito Corleone.

546
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:47,800
They're licensed to carry firearms.

547
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:53,060
If you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show cause.

548
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:55,430
Let him go.

549
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:31,300
- What's with all the new faces?
- We'll need them now.

550
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,190
After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.

551
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:37,430
We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.

552
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:40,770
Jesus Christ.

553
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:50,410
Looks like a fortress around here.

554
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:57,240
Tommasuccio! Hey... 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.

555
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:01,460
That Turk shows one hair on his ass,
he's dead.

556
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:05,340
Mike, let me look at you.

557
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:12,390
You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

558
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:18,020
The Turk wants to talk! Imagine
the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.

559
01:11:18,230 --> 01:11:21,060
- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

560
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:25,600
What did he say... He wants us to send
Michael to hear the proposition.

561
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:28,940
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

562
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:32,440
- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.

563
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:36,950
- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.

564
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:40,250
No more! Not this time, Consigliere.

565
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:43,660
No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.

566
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,960
I want Sollozzo, or we go to war...

567
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:49,840
- The other families...
- They hand me Sollozzo!

568
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:52,720
This is business, not personal!

569
01:11:52,930 --> 01:11:57,590
- They shot my father...
- Even that was business, not personal.

570
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:01,390
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favour.

571
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:06,230
No more advice on how to
patch things up. Just help me win.

572
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:15,660
I found out about Captain McCluskey,
who broke Mike's jaw.

573
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:20,120
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,
and for big money.

574
01:12:20,330 --> 01:12:24,160
McCluskey has agreed to be
The Turk's bodyguard.

575
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:28,000
So when Sollozzo is being guarded,
he's invulnerable.

576
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:31,800
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

577
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:37,760
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

578
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:41,760
Even the old man's political protection
would run for cover.

579
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:47,390
Do me a favour.
Take this into consideration.

580
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:53,110
All right, we'll wait.

581
01:12:57,870 --> 01:13:01,290
We can't wait. We can't wait.

582
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:06,210
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.

583
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:10,200
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

584
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:14,550
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.

585
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:19,550
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

586
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,810
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

587
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:32,940
It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.

588
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:37,200
Let's set the meeting.

589
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:42,830
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

590
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:48,120
We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.

591
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:52,340
Some place where there are people,
so I feel safe.

592
01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:57,550
They'll search me when I meet them,
right?

593
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,630
So I can't have a weapon on me.

594
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:08,900
But if Clemenza can figure out a way to
have a weapon planted there for me...

595
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:16,200
...then I'll kill them both.

596
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:32,590
Nice college boy. Didn't want to
get mixed up in the family business.

597
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,330
Now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped you?

598
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:42,970
This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

599
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:45,940
You're taking this very personal.

600
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:49,480
Tom, this is business
and he's taking it personal.

601
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:53,440
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey...

602
01:14:53,650 --> 01:15:00,110
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up
in drugs, a dishonest cop.

603
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:04,320
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming.

604
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:09,910
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?

605
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:14,800
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.

606
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:22,040
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.

607
01:15:24,890 --> 01:15:30,050
It's as cold as they come. Impossible to
trace, so you don't worry about prints.

608
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:34,900
I put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt. Try it.

609
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:49,250
Is the trigger too tight?

610
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,370
My ears!

611
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:59,010
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.

612
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:02,340
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

613
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:07,920
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.

614
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:11,600
Let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

615
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:16,030
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,

616
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:19,070
so walk out fast, but don't run.

617
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:22,700
Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

618
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:26,190
They'll be scared stiff,
so don't worry about nothing.

619
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:32,500
You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation,
nobody knows where,

620
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:35,170
and we'll catch the hell.

621
01:16:35,380 --> 01:16:39,080
- How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.

622
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:42,920
All the other families will probably
line up against us.

623
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:48,130
These things have to happen every five,
ten years. Gets rid of the bad blood.

624
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:52,510
Been ten years since the last one.
You have to stop them at the beginning.

625
01:16:52,730 --> 01:16:58,850
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.

626
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:04,070
You know, Mike, we were all proud
of you. Being a hero and all.

627
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,770
Your father too.

628
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:47,520
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.

629
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:52,740
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

630
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,830
How much time do we have?

631
01:17:56,040 --> 01:18:01,200
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

632
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:07,510
- We could put a tail on them.
- Sollozzo would lose our ass.

633
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:12,630
- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.

634
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:17,930
- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

635
01:18:18,150 --> 01:18:21,600
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

636
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:25,440
- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.

637
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:28,910
Sollozzo might not even be
in the car, Sonny!

638
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,240
I'll get it.

639
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:57,760
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

640
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:01,100
- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.

641
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:07,070
A police captain is on call 24 hours
a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.

642
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:12,110
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

643
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:17,320
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

644
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:23,580
They've got an old-fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

645
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:27,710
We might be able to tape the gun
behind it.

646
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:32,470
All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,

647
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:36,510
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.

648
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:41,720
Then you go to take a leak. No, better
still, you ask permission to go.

649
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:46,650
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

650
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:50,650
I want somebody very good
to plant that gun.

651
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:53,870
I don't want him coming out
with just his dick.

652
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:59,750
- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

653
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,450
Let's move.

654
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:10,180
Did he tell you to drop the gun
right away?

655
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:12,630
Yeah, a million times.

656
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:21,930
Don't forget. Two shots apiece in
the head as soon as you come out.

657
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:31,780
How long do you think it will be
before I can come back?

658
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:34,320
At least a year.

659
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:39,700
I'll square it with Mom, that you're not
seeing her before you leave and...

660
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:44,370
I'll get a message to that girlfriend
when the time is right.

661
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:52,630
Take care.

662
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,090
Take care, Mike.

663
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:33,250
I'm glad you came. I hope we can
straighten everything out.

664
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:39,090
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.

665
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:43,770
I want to straighten everything out.
I don't want my father bothered again.

666
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:47,930
I swear on my children
that he won't be, Mike.

667
01:21:48,150 --> 01:21:51,400
But you have to keep an open mind
when we talk.

668
01:21:51,610 --> 01:21:57,150
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.

669
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:59,780
He's a good kid.

670
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:06,920
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

671
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:12,290
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.

672
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:21,260
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.

673
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:26,230
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.

674
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:31,230
He's clean.

675
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:58,880
Going to Jersey?

676
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:03,670
Maybe.

677
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:30,660
Nice work, Lou.

678
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:12,460
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

679
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:15,210
I'll have it.

680
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:53,330
- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.
- Go ahead.

681
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:15,210
What I want...

682
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,960
What's most important to me...

683
01:26:20,170 --> 01:26:24,590
...is that I have a guarantee.
No more attempts on my father's life.

684
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,930
What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!

685
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:32,590
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

686
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:35,020
I'm not that clever.

687
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:38,770
All I want is a truce.

688
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:49,070
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?

689
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:53,530
When you got to go, you got to go.

690
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:00,040
He's clean.

691
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:03,170
Don't take too long.

692
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:07,630
I've frisked a thousand punks.

693
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:00,380
Okay, you take over.

694
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:20,360
I love you, Grandpa.

695
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:25,280
I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.

696
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:29,160
- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

697
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:35,580
"I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."

698
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:40,880
Go with your mother.

699
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:43,550
Take them downstairs.

700
01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:51,760
Go on, Carlo, you too.

701
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:54,690
Go on.

702
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,130
- What's the matter with you, Carlo?
- Shut up and set the table.

703
01:33:34,730 --> 01:33:41,100
Since McCluskey's killing, the police
have cracked down on our operations.

704
01:33:42,530 --> 01:33:47,570
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.

705
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:51,200
They hit us, so we hit them back.

706
01:33:51,710 --> 01:33:56,290
Through our newspaper contacts
we've been able to put out material

707
01:33:56,500 --> 01:34:00,750
about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo
in the drug rackets.

708
01:34:00,970 --> 01:34:03,130
So things are loosening up.

709
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:11,760
And I sent Fredo to Las Vegas, under
the protection of Don Francesco of L.A.

710
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:17,730
- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to learn the casino business.

711
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:26,030
Where's Michael?

712
01:34:38,550 --> 01:34:41,460
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

713
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:47,970
But he's safe. We're starting to work
to bring him back.

714
01:35:08,990 --> 01:35:13,620
Did you find out where that old pimp
Tattaglia is hiding? I want him now.

715
01:35:13,830 --> 01:35:16,920
Sonny, things are starting to loosen up.

716
01:35:17,130 --> 01:35:21,920
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell
will break loose. Pop can negotiate.

717
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:27,880
- He must get better first. I'll decide...
- War is costly. We can't do business.

718
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:31,930
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a stalemate.

719
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:37,100
- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!

720
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:42,980
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime
consigliere, I wouldn't be in this shape!

721
01:35:43,190 --> 01:35:46,280
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

722
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:51,280
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

723
01:35:52,410 --> 01:35:55,580
Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

724
01:35:56,210 --> 01:36:00,700
Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.

725
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:04,830
Driving new Cadillacs,
paying 50 per cent on a bet.

726
01:36:05,050 --> 01:36:08,130
That's because they've started
making big money.

727
01:36:08,340 --> 01:36:11,760
Poppa never talked business
at the table.

728
01:36:11,970 --> 01:36:16,430
- Shut up, Connie...
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

729
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:19,480
Don't interfere.

730
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:23,820
I'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family...

731
01:36:24,030 --> 01:36:26,860
We don't discuss business at the table.

732
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:16,660
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

733
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:24,490
Why are you so far
from the house?

734
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:27,460
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

735
01:37:27,670 --> 01:37:29,750
The bodyguards are here.

736
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:32,290
It's still dangerous...

737
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:35,180
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

738
01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:38,640
Your enemies know you're here.

739
01:37:38,850 --> 01:37:42,050
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

740
01:37:42,270 --> 01:37:43,930
Not yet.

741
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:47,020
It's out of the question.

742
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:52,280
Where are you going now?

743
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:56,940
Take my car.

744
01:37:58,290 --> 01:38:00,830
I want to walk.

745
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:04,200
Be careful.

746
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:39,820
Where have all the men gone?

747
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:42,910
They're all dead from vendettas.

748
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:47,120
There are the names of the dead.

749
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:06,840
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!

750
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:10,810
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable!

751
01:39:11,570 --> 01:39:17,110
America! Take me to the America, G.I.!
Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!

752
01:39:35,050 --> 01:39:37,420
Mamma mia what a beauty.

753
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:48,640
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

754
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:58,850
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

755
01:40:21,970 --> 01:40:24,130
Did you have a good hunt?

756
01:40:24,350 --> 01:40:26,920
You know all the girls
around here?

757
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:29,680
We saw some real beauties.

758
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:34,030
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

759
01:40:36,450 --> 01:40:39,320
She would tempt the devil himself.

760
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:49,490
Really put together.

761
01:40:53,750 --> 01:40:56,040
Such hair, such mouth!

762
01:40:58,130 --> 01:41:01,630
The girls around here are
beautiful...but virtuous.

763
01:41:01,850 --> 01:41:04,340
This one had a purple dress...

764
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:07,100
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

765
01:41:07,310 --> 01:41:11,470
A type more Greek than Italian.

766
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:15,440
Do you know her?

767
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:22,480
There's no girl like that
in this town.

768
01:41:24,910 --> 01:41:27,280
My God, I understand!

769
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:32,820
What's wrong?

770
01:41:34,170 --> 01:41:35,790
Let's go.

771
01:41:37,010 --> 01:41:38,420
It's his daughter.

772
01:41:38,630 --> 01:41:41,040
Tell him to come here.

773
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:44,840
Call him.

774
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:07,540
Fabrizio, you translate.

775
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:14,120
I apologise if I offended you.

776
01:42:14,340 --> 01:42:17,290
I'm a stranger in this country.

777
01:42:17,510 --> 01:42:20,920
I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

778
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:28,840
I'm an American, hiding in Sicily.

779
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:33,140
My name is Michael Corleone.

780
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:38,820
There are people who'd pay a lot
of money for that information.

781
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:44,280
But then your daughter
would lose a father...

782
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:48,490
...instead of gaining a husband.

783
01:42:56,090 --> 01:42:58,960
I want to meet your daughter.

784
01:42:59,170 --> 01:43:03,750
With your permission, and under
the supervision of your family.

785
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:07,170
With all respect.

786
01:43:12,430 --> 01:43:16,560
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

787
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,480
What's her name?

788
01:46:18,410 --> 01:46:20,990
I'll knock you dizzy.

789
01:46:26,340 --> 01:46:28,740
Save it for the library.

790
01:46:32,130 --> 01:46:34,920
We've got to pick up my sister.

791
01:46:52,780 --> 01:46:55,400
What's the matter?

792
01:46:57,030 --> 01:46:58,740
What's the matter?

793
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:02,990
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

794
01:47:03,210 --> 01:47:05,960
It was my fault. I hit him.

795
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:10,710
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me...

796
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:18,090
I'm just going to get a doctor
to take a look at you.

797
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:21,390
Sonny, please don't do anything.

798
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:24,690
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?

799
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:27,810
Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

800
01:47:32,240 --> 01:47:35,240
You spic slobs still betting Yankees?

801
01:47:35,450 --> 01:47:38,780
Tell them to stop taking in action.

802
01:47:38,990 --> 01:47:41,030
We lost enough money last week.

803
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:50,000
Come here, come here!

804
01:48:46,850 --> 01:48:50,060
If you touch my sister again, I'll kill you.

805
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:47,550
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

806
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:51,920
Yes, I have. I've tried writing and calling.

807
01:52:52,140 --> 01:52:55,890
- I want to reach Michael.
- Nobody knows where he is.

808
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:59,190
All we know is that he's all right.

809
01:53:01,020 --> 01:53:05,150
- What was that?
- An accident, but nobody was hurt.

810
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:11,400
Tom, will you give this letter to Michael.
Please?

811
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:17,120
If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

812
01:53:17,330 --> 01:53:19,620
He'll get in touch with you.

813
01:53:19,830 --> 01:53:23,370
I let my cab go, so can I call
another one, please?

814
01:53:23,590 --> 01:53:25,630
Come on. Sorry.

815
01:53:44,860 --> 01:53:47,940
- Hello?
- Is Carlo there?

816
01:53:48,150 --> 01:53:50,480
- Who is this?
- A friend of Carlo.

817
01:53:50,700 --> 01:53:54,280
Tell him that I can't make it tonight
until later.

818
01:53:59,830 --> 01:54:01,710
Bitch!

819
01:54:03,460 --> 01:54:05,920
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry.

820
01:54:06,130 --> 01:54:09,250
- The food is getting cold.
- I'll eat out later.

821
01:54:09,470 --> 01:54:11,840
You just told me to make you dinner!

822
01:54:20,190 --> 01:54:23,020
She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat.

823
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:31,400
That's it, break it all, you spoiled
Guinea brat. Break it all!

824
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:44,280
Why don't you bring your whore
home for dinner?

825
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:47,790
Maybe I will.

826
01:54:53,050 --> 01:54:56,140
- Clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

827
01:54:56,350 --> 01:55:00,560
You skinny, spoiled brat.
Clean it up! Clean it up!

828
01:55:00,770 --> 01:55:04,600
Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!

829
01:55:07,190 --> 01:55:10,480
Clean it up. Clean that up, you...

830
01:55:13,070 --> 01:55:14,950
Clean it!

831
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:19,290
Clean it up! Yeah, kill me.
Be a murderer, like your father!

832
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:22,910
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

833
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:25,960
Come on, kill me!

834
01:55:26,170 --> 01:55:27,830
Get out of here!

835
01:55:28,050 --> 01:55:31,250
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

836
01:55:31,470 --> 01:55:34,550
You Guinea brat. Get out of here!

837
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:48,060
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.

838
01:55:48,650 --> 01:55:51,650
Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying.

839
01:55:51,860 --> 01:55:55,360
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

840
01:55:55,990 --> 01:55:58,360
Yeah, Connie.

841
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:04,830
You wait there.

842
01:56:07,130 --> 01:56:09,660
No, you just wait there.

843
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:14,290
Son-of-a-bitch.

844
01:56:14,510 --> 01:56:17,550
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What's the matter?

845
01:56:21,350 --> 01:56:24,930
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.

846
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:34,140
Sonny!

847
01:56:40,280 --> 01:56:42,950
- Sonny.
- Get out of here!

848
01:56:43,330 --> 01:56:45,450
Go after him, go on!

849
01:57:14,860 --> 01:57:18,480
Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!

850
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:07,760
Give me a drop.

851
01:59:15,900 --> 01:59:18,980
My wife is crying upstairs.

852
01:59:20,530 --> 01:59:23,780
I hear cars coming to the house.

853
01:59:27,580 --> 01:59:30,660
Consigliere of mine,

854
01:59:30,870 --> 01:59:34,240
tell your Don what everyone
seems to know.

855
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:37,030
I didn't tell Mama anything.

856
01:59:37,800 --> 01:59:41,580
I was about to come up and wake you
and tell you.

857
01:59:44,390 --> 01:59:46,630
But you needed a drink first.

858
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:50,970
Yeah.

859
01:59:53,480 --> 01:59:56,400
Well, now you've had your drink.

860
02:00:01,490 --> 02:00:05,980
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

861
02:00:22,970 --> 02:00:25,720
I want no inquiries made.

862
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:32,350
I want no acts of vengeance.

863
02:00:33,730 --> 02:00:36,260
I want you to arrange a meeting...

864
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:40,610
...with the heads of the five families.

865
02:00:42,150 --> 02:00:44,690
This war stops now.

866
02:01:06,130 --> 02:01:08,420
Call Bonasera.

867
02:01:08,680 --> 02:01:11,170
I need him now.

868
02:01:23,110 --> 02:01:28,230
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling for
Vito Corleone, at his request.

869
02:01:28,450 --> 02:01:30,860
You owe your Don a service.

870
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:34,490
He has no doubt that you will repay it.

871
02:01:34,700 --> 02:01:39,620
He will be at your funeral parlour
in one hour. Be there to greet him.

872
02:02:00,190 --> 02:02:05,020
Well, my friend, are you ready
to do me this service?

873
02:02:05,230 --> 02:02:09,360
Yes. What do you want me to do?

874
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:21,620
I want you to use all your powers
and all your skills.

875
02:02:25,130 --> 02:02:28,410
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

876
02:02:44,190 --> 02:02:47,390
Look how they massacred my boy.

877
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:19,600
It's safer to teach you English!

878
02:03:19,810 --> 02:03:21,390
I know English...

879
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:26,760
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

880
02:03:34,280 --> 02:03:36,690
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

881
02:03:36,910 --> 02:03:39,580
How are things in Palermo?

882
02:03:44,750 --> 02:03:50,370
Michael is teaching me to
drive...watch, I'll show you.

883
02:03:51,170 --> 02:03:53,710
How are things in Palermo?

884
02:03:53,930 --> 02:03:56,800
Young people don't respect
anything any more...

885
02:03:57,010 --> 02:04:00,510
times are changing for the worse.

886
02:04:03,270 --> 02:04:09,020
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

887
02:04:09,230 --> 02:04:16,560
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa...right now.

888
02:04:19,790 --> 02:04:22,320
What's wrong?

889
02:04:22,580 --> 02:04:25,660
Bad news from America.

890
02:04:26,460 --> 02:04:31,880
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

891
02:04:37,930 --> 02:04:40,000
Let's go...you promised.

892
02:04:58,820 --> 02:05:01,450
Get the car.

893
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:06,240
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

894
02:05:06,460 --> 02:05:09,990
No, take her to her father's house
until things are safe.

895
02:05:10,210 --> 02:05:12,620
Okay, anything you say.

896
02:05:18,300 --> 02:05:20,670
Calo, where is Apollonia?

897
02:05:20,890 --> 02:05:25,020
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

898
02:05:26,640 --> 02:05:29,730
She'll make a good American wife.

899
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:32,770
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

900
02:05:42,490 --> 02:05:44,950
Fabrizio!

901
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:47,700
Where are you going?

902
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:52,250
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

903
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:58,170
No, Apollonia!

904
02:06:21,450 --> 02:06:27,120
Don Barzini, I want to thank you
for helping me organise this meeting,

905
02:06:27,330 --> 02:06:32,620
and the other heads of the five families
from New York and New Jersey.

906
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:36,920
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

907
02:06:37,130 --> 02:06:40,670
and from Brooklyn...

908
02:06:42,050 --> 02:06:44,380
...Philip Tattaglia.

909
02:06:45,720 --> 02:06:48,680
And from Staten Island

910
02:06:48,890 --> 02:06:52,260
we have with us Victor Strachi.

911
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:58,190
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

912
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:02,480
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

913
02:07:08,620 --> 02:07:11,950
How did things ever get so far?

914
02:07:12,170 --> 02:07:14,210
I don't know.

915
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:20,170
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

916
02:07:22,510 --> 02:07:26,340
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

917
02:07:28,350 --> 02:07:31,850
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

918
02:07:32,060 --> 02:07:36,010
then I'm willing to let things go on
as before.

919
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:40,900
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

920
02:07:41,110 --> 02:07:46,240
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

921
02:07:46,450 --> 02:07:50,360
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

922
02:07:50,580 --> 02:07:53,910
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

923
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:57,960
He refused to share them.

924
02:07:58,170 --> 02:08:01,670
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

925
02:08:01,880 --> 02:08:04,420
All of you know me.

926
02:08:05,140 --> 02:08:10,470
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

927
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:17,770
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

928
02:08:17,980 --> 02:08:21,850
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

929
02:08:22,070 --> 02:08:28,110
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

930
02:08:28,330 --> 02:08:32,990
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

931
02:08:33,210 --> 02:08:37,250
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

932
02:08:37,460 --> 02:08:42,450
I believed that then...
and I believe that now.

933
02:08:42,670 --> 02:08:44,750
Times have changed.

934
02:08:44,970 --> 02:08:49,630
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

935
02:08:49,850 --> 02:08:52,600
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

936
02:08:52,810 --> 02:08:58,180
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

937
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:03,230
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

938
02:09:03,860 --> 02:09:07,440
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

939
02:09:07,660 --> 02:09:10,570
After all, we're not communists.

940
02:09:13,160 --> 02:09:16,250
I also don't believe in drugs.

941
02:09:16,460 --> 02:09:21,250
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

942
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:24,550
Somebody says to them
"I have powders."

943
02:09:24,760 --> 02:09:31,890
"If you put up 3-4,000 dollar investment,
we can make 50,000 distributing."

944
02:09:32,100 --> 02:09:37,890
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

945
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:43,020
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

946
02:09:43,230 --> 02:09:46,020
That's an infámia.

947
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:50,020
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the coloured.

948
02:09:50,240 --> 02:09:53,330
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

949
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:04,170
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

950
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:12,010
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

951
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:16,720
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

952
02:10:16,930 --> 02:10:21,310
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

953
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:24,890
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

954
02:10:25,110 --> 02:10:28,560
As time goes by and his position
becomes stronger,

955
02:10:28,780 --> 02:10:31,240
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

956
02:10:31,450 --> 02:10:36,610
We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

957
02:10:36,830 --> 02:10:39,040
You talk about vengeance.

958
02:10:39,250 --> 02:10:42,330
Will vengeance bring your son
back to you?

959
02:10:42,540 --> 02:10:45,300
Or my boy to me?

960
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:48,590
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

961
02:10:51,010 --> 02:10:54,010
But I have selfish reasons.

962
02:10:55,510 --> 02:10:59,640
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country...

963
02:11:00,980 --> 02:11:03,980
...because of this Sollozzo business.

964
02:11:04,190 --> 02:11:08,980
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

965
02:11:09,200 --> 02:11:11,900
Cleared of all these false charges.

966
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:16,320
But I'm a superstitious man.

967
02:11:16,540 --> 02:11:22,990
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,

968
02:11:23,210 --> 02:11:26,660
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

969
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:30,790
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

970
02:11:31,010 --> 02:11:35,140
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

971
02:11:36,100 --> 02:11:38,930
And that I do not forgive.

972
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:43,680
But, that aside...

973
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:49,190
...Iet me say that I swear...

974
02:11:50,440 --> 02:11:53,530
...on the souls of my grandchildren,

975
02:11:53,740 --> 02:11:58,620
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

976
02:12:23,480 --> 02:12:28,930
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

977
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:31,990
Mention it. Don't insist.

978
02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:38,320
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

979
02:12:39,830 --> 02:12:45,250
Tattaglia's a pimp. He could never
have outfought Santino.

980
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:54,670
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

981
02:13:09,270 --> 02:13:11,430
Come on, Nancy.

982
02:13:12,650 --> 02:13:15,820
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

983
02:13:16,570 --> 02:13:18,780
Okay, all right.

984
02:13:31,630 --> 02:13:34,200
How long have you been back?

985
02:13:34,420 --> 02:13:36,460
I've been back a year.

986
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:40,510
Longer than that, I think.

987
02:13:42,350 --> 02:13:44,800
It's good to see you, Kay.

988
02:13:55,650 --> 02:13:58,740
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

989
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:04,120
He's been sick. Very sick.

990
02:14:05,290 --> 02:14:11,820
But you're not like him. You told me you
weren't going to become like your father.

991
02:14:13,050 --> 02:14:17,420
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

992
02:14:17,630 --> 02:14:22,050
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

993
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:24,470
Like a senator or president.

994
02:14:24,680 --> 02:14:27,140
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

995
02:14:27,350 --> 02:14:30,190
They don't have men killed.

996
02:14:33,070 --> 02:14:35,350
Who's being naive, Kay?

997
02:14:36,650 --> 02:14:42,110
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

998
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:47,490
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

999
02:14:48,330 --> 02:14:52,960
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

1000
02:14:53,710 --> 02:14:57,410
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

1001
02:14:58,260 --> 02:15:03,000
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

1002
02:15:03,220 --> 02:15:06,590
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1003
02:15:06,810 --> 02:15:11,430
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.

1004
02:15:12,310 --> 02:15:15,430
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay...

1005
02:15:16,570 --> 02:15:20,780
I'll do anything you ask to make up for
what's happened to us.

1006
02:15:22,570 --> 02:15:28,080
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that...

1007
02:15:28,290 --> 02:15:32,780
...we have each other.
That we have a life together.

1008
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:36,330
That we have children. Our children.

1009
02:15:37,460 --> 02:15:40,330
Kay, I need you.

1010
02:15:41,470 --> 02:15:43,840
And I love you.

1011
02:16:05,160 --> 02:16:08,910
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!

1012
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:12,570
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

1013
02:16:12,790 --> 02:16:15,870
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1014
02:16:16,090 --> 02:16:19,120
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.

1015
02:16:19,340 --> 02:16:22,710
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

1016
02:16:22,930 --> 02:16:27,970
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.

1017
02:16:28,180 --> 02:16:29,840
Don Corleone...

1018
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:34,510
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1019
02:16:34,730 --> 02:16:39,060
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1020
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:42,310
Michael is now head of the family.

1021
02:16:42,530 --> 02:16:46,690
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1022
02:16:46,910 --> 02:16:48,950
After we make the move to Nevada

1023
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:53,660
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

1024
02:16:53,870 --> 02:16:58,000
- How long will that be?
- Six months.

1025
02:16:58,210 --> 02:17:04,300
Forgive me, but with you gone, me and
Pete will come under Barzini's thumb.

1026
02:17:04,510 --> 02:17:09,970
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1027
02:17:10,180 --> 02:17:13,140
- Do you have faith in my judgement?
- Yes.

1028
02:17:13,350 --> 02:17:16,140
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

1029
02:17:16,350 --> 02:17:19,770
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1030
02:17:24,240 --> 02:17:29,690
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1031
02:17:29,910 --> 02:17:32,830
That's all I can tell you now.

1032
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:35,330
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1033
02:17:35,540 --> 02:17:38,910
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right-hand man.

1034
02:17:39,130 --> 02:17:43,790
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1035
02:17:44,010 --> 02:17:47,460
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

1036
02:17:47,680 --> 02:17:52,550
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

1037
02:18:10,910 --> 02:18:14,440
- Thank you, Poppa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1038
02:18:15,250 --> 02:18:18,280
Mike... Why am I out?

1039
02:18:19,670 --> 02:18:23,500
You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.

1040
02:18:23,710 --> 02:18:26,420
Things may get rough with the move.

1041
02:18:27,010 --> 02:18:29,330
Tom.

1042
02:18:33,430 --> 02:18:38,590
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1043
02:18:38,810 --> 02:18:44,190
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

1044
02:18:44,400 --> 02:18:48,480
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

1045
02:18:48,700 --> 02:18:54,150
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

1046
02:18:54,370 --> 02:18:57,990
- Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.

1047
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:51,090
I can't get over the way your face looks.
So good!

1048
02:19:51,300 --> 02:19:55,760
This doctor did some job. Did Kay
talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

1049
02:19:55,970 --> 02:19:59,340
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.

1050
02:19:59,560 --> 02:20:02,050
Let me open the door, all right?

1051
02:20:08,650 --> 02:20:14,360
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

1052
02:20:14,570 --> 02:20:17,330
- Your brother Freddy.
- Girls?

1053
02:20:20,660 --> 02:20:24,330
I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.

1054
02:20:25,130 --> 02:20:29,590
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?

1055
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:33,930
- That's for you to find out.
- Get rid of them, Fredo.

1056
02:20:34,840 --> 02:20:39,510
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

1057
02:20:39,720 --> 02:20:43,010
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

1058
02:20:48,190 --> 02:20:51,280
Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

1059
02:20:51,490 --> 02:20:54,570
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

1060
02:20:55,360 --> 02:20:57,860
Hey, come on! Scram!

1061
02:20:59,160 --> 02:21:03,620
Come on, honey. I don't know
what's the matter with him, Johnny.

1062
02:21:03,830 --> 02:21:05,910
Sorry.

1063
02:21:06,130 --> 02:21:08,830
I don't know. He's tired.

1064
02:21:15,680 --> 02:21:18,590
What happened to Moe Greene?

1065
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:23,180
He had some business. He said to
give him a call when the party started.

1066
02:21:23,390 --> 02:21:25,720
Well, give him a call.

1067
02:21:26,560 --> 02:21:29,900
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.

1068
02:21:30,110 --> 02:21:32,150
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

1069
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:35,780
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

1070
02:21:35,990 --> 02:21:38,690
Well, I owe it all to him.

1071
02:21:38,910 --> 02:21:43,990
He knows how grateful you are. That's
why he'd like to ask a favour of you.

1072
02:21:44,210 --> 02:21:47,040
Mike, what can I do?

1073
02:21:47,250 --> 02:21:53,290
We're thinking of giving up our interests
in the olive oil business and settle here.

1074
02:21:53,510 --> 02:21:59,380
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it. Tom!

1075
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:04,640
Are you sure? Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

1076
02:22:04,850 --> 02:22:08,140
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

1077
02:22:09,020 --> 02:22:11,260
See, Johnny...

1078
02:22:11,480 --> 02:22:15,690
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

1079
02:22:15,900 --> 02:22:20,030
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1080
02:22:22,370 --> 02:22:27,330
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

1081
02:22:28,250 --> 02:22:30,620
We're counting on you.

1082
02:22:32,420 --> 02:22:36,290
Sure, Mike. I'll do anything
for my godfather.

1083
02:22:36,510 --> 02:22:37,970
Good.

1084
02:22:39,260 --> 02:22:43,800
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

1085
02:22:44,010 --> 02:22:46,050
- Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

1086
02:22:46,270 --> 02:22:51,430
Have everything? Specially prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

1087
02:22:51,650 --> 02:22:55,600
Draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

1088
02:22:57,740 --> 02:23:00,860
Is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

1089
02:23:02,280 --> 02:23:03,660
Buy me out?

1090
02:23:03,870 --> 02:23:09,290
The casino, the hotel. The
Corleone family wants to buy you out.

1091
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:15,340
The Corleone family wants to
buy me out? No, I buy you out.

1092
02:23:15,550 --> 02:23:18,670
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

1093
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:23,510
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

1094
02:23:27,640 --> 02:23:30,130
You Guineas make me laugh.

1095
02:23:30,350 --> 02:23:35,770
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

1096
02:23:35,980 --> 02:23:39,730
You did that because we bankrolled
your casino

1097
02:23:39,950 --> 02:23:44,940
and the Molinari family guaranteed
his safety. Let's talk business.

1098
02:23:45,160 --> 02:23:50,320
Yes. First of all, you're all done. You
don't have that kind of muscle anymore.

1099
02:23:50,540 --> 02:23:54,870
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

1100
02:23:55,090 --> 02:23:58,790
Do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

1101
02:23:59,010 --> 02:24:03,920
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

1102
02:24:04,140 --> 02:24:07,510
Is that why you slapped my brother
around in public?

1103
02:24:07,720 --> 02:24:12,470
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

1104
02:24:12,690 --> 02:24:16,810
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

1105
02:24:17,020 --> 02:24:21,520
I have a business to run.
I've got to kick asses sometimes.

1106
02:24:21,740 --> 02:24:25,600
We had an argument,
so I had to straighten him out.

1107
02:24:25,820 --> 02:24:28,360
You straightened my brother out?

1108
02:24:28,580 --> 02:24:33,040
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

1109
02:24:33,250 --> 02:24:35,620
What's wrong with you?

1110
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:43,670
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1111
02:24:43,880 --> 02:24:45,380
Son-of-a-bitch!

1112
02:24:45,590 --> 02:24:50,930
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones
when you were out with cheerleaders.

1113
02:24:51,140 --> 02:24:54,480
Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.

1114
02:24:54,690 --> 02:24:58,190
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don...

1115
02:24:58,400 --> 02:25:03,440
Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.

1116
02:25:03,650 --> 02:25:07,400
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

1117
02:25:10,700 --> 02:25:16,040
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1118
02:25:17,630 --> 02:25:19,670
Fredo...

1119
02:25:19,880 --> 02:25:22,960
You're my older brother, and I love you.

1120
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:28,630
But don't ever take sides with anyone
against the family again.

1121
02:25:38,810 --> 02:25:43,440
I have to see my father and his people,
so have dinner without me.

1122
02:25:44,700 --> 02:25:50,030
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

1123
02:25:56,870 --> 02:25:59,880
Your sister wants to ask you something.

1124
02:26:00,090 --> 02:26:02,240
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

1125
02:26:02,460 --> 02:26:05,130
They want you to be godfather
to their boy.

1126
02:26:05,340 --> 02:26:07,380
- We'll see.
- Will you?

1127
02:26:07,590 --> 02:26:10,050
Let me think about it. Come on.

1128
02:26:18,270 --> 02:26:21,270
Barzini will move against you first.

1129
02:26:21,480 --> 02:26:25,860
He'll set up a meeting with someone
you absolutely trust.

1130
02:26:26,070 --> 02:26:29,020
Guaranteeing your safety.

1131
02:26:29,240 --> 02:26:32,740
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

1132
02:26:36,910 --> 02:26:40,450
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

1133
02:26:41,340 --> 02:26:45,290
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.

1134
02:26:49,970 --> 02:26:52,340
I don't know.

1135
02:26:53,350 --> 02:26:57,010
Are you happy with your wife
and children?

1136
02:26:57,230 --> 02:27:00,730
- Very happy.
- That's good.

1137
02:27:01,940 --> 02:27:06,850
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

1138
02:27:07,070 --> 02:27:10,570
- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.

1139
02:27:11,370 --> 02:27:14,650
I spend my life trying not to be careless.

1140
02:27:15,950 --> 02:27:19,900
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

1141
02:27:22,710 --> 02:27:25,040
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1142
02:27:25,250 --> 02:27:28,210
He looks more like you every day.

1143
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:35,210
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

1144
02:27:37,180 --> 02:27:39,510
Read the funny papers.

1145
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:52,060
I want you to arrange for a telephone
man to check all in- and out-going calls.

1146
02:27:52,280 --> 02:27:58,280
- I did it already. I took care of that, Pop.
- That's right. I forgot.

1147
02:28:01,580 --> 02:28:04,250
What's the matter?

1148
02:28:04,460 --> 02:28:06,920
What's bothering you?

1149
02:28:09,800 --> 02:28:14,540
I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it,
so I'll handle it.

1150
02:28:27,730 --> 02:28:31,860
I knew that Santino would have to
go through all this.

1151
02:28:32,150 --> 02:28:35,070
And Fredo...

1152
02:28:36,620 --> 02:28:38,940
Fredo was, well...

1153
02:28:40,450 --> 02:28:44,040
But I never wanted this for you.

1154
02:28:45,540 --> 02:28:50,620
I worked my whole life. I don't apologise
for taking care of my family.

1155
02:28:50,840 --> 02:28:54,710
And I refused to be a fool,

1156
02:28:54,930 --> 02:28:59,260
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1157
02:29:00,890 --> 02:29:05,020
I don't apologise. That's my life,
but I thought that...

1158
02:29:05,980 --> 02:29:11,440
...that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.

1159
02:29:13,070 --> 02:29:18,580
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.

1160
02:29:18,780 --> 02:29:21,190
Another pezzo da novanta.

1161
02:29:21,950 --> 02:29:23,410
Well...

1162
02:29:26,580 --> 02:29:30,630
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1163
02:29:30,840 --> 02:29:34,670
We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.

1164
02:29:39,050 --> 02:29:43,470
Now listen, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting,

1165
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:47,100
he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

1166
02:30:03,540 --> 02:30:05,950
Can I hold it, please?

1167
02:30:20,720 --> 02:30:24,590
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.

1168
02:30:24,810 --> 02:30:27,930
Over here, over here.

1169
02:30:29,440 --> 02:30:32,770
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1170
02:30:38,320 --> 02:30:40,360
Antony!

1171
02:30:40,570 --> 02:30:42,650
Come here, come here.

1172
02:30:46,330 --> 02:30:49,170
That's it. We'll put it right there.

1173
02:30:55,010 --> 02:30:58,290
I'll show you something. Come here.

1174
02:30:59,550 --> 02:31:01,590
Stand there.

1175
02:31:05,020 --> 02:31:07,510
Give me an orange!

1176
02:31:25,540 --> 02:31:27,610
That's a new trick.

1177
02:31:28,210 --> 02:31:31,210
You run in there. Run in there.

1178
02:31:43,890 --> 02:31:46,210
Where are you?

1179
02:34:43,570 --> 02:34:46,490
Mike, can I have a minute?

1180
02:34:55,960 --> 02:34:58,240
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1181
02:34:58,460 --> 02:35:02,410
He says we can straighten out
any of our problems.

1182
02:35:02,630 --> 02:35:05,750
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1183
02:35:05,970 --> 02:35:10,540
I can arrange security. On my territory.

1184
02:35:12,930 --> 02:35:16,050
- All right?
- All right.

1185
02:35:33,080 --> 02:35:36,160
Do you know how they're going to
come at you?

1186
02:35:38,460 --> 02:35:42,950
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.

1187
02:35:44,130 --> 02:35:46,450
Where I'll be safe.

1188
02:35:58,310 --> 02:36:02,010
I always thought it would be
Clemenza, not Tessio.

1189
02:36:02,230 --> 02:36:06,730
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

1190
02:36:08,610 --> 02:36:10,690
But I'm going to wait.

1191
02:36:10,910 --> 02:36:13,190
After the baptism.

1192
02:36:14,910 --> 02:36:17,740
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1193
02:36:18,750 --> 02:36:21,780
And then I'll meet with Don Barzini

1194
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:27,040
and Tattaglia.
All the heads of the five families.

1195
02:38:48,560 --> 02:38:52,810
Michael, do you believe in God, the
Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?

1196
02:38:53,030 --> 02:38:54,350
I do.

1197
02:38:54,570 --> 02:38:57,940
Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?

1198
02:38:58,160 --> 02:38:59,480
I do.

1199
02:38:59,700 --> 02:39:03,610
Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?

1200
02:39:03,830 --> 02:39:05,160
I do.

1201
02:40:10,020 --> 02:40:14,760
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1202
02:40:21,030 --> 02:40:22,360
I do renounce him.

1203
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:33,540
And all his works?

1204
02:40:46,850 --> 02:40:48,430
I do renounce them.

1205
02:40:49,810 --> 02:40:51,350
Oh, God!

1206
02:40:54,270 --> 02:40:58,020
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1207
02:41:13,620 --> 02:41:17,410
Michael Rizzi, will you be baptised?

1208
02:41:17,630 --> 02:41:19,120
I will.

1209
02:41:26,140 --> 02:41:32,420
Michael Rizzi, go in peace, and may
the Lord be with you. Amen.

1210
02:41:45,700 --> 02:41:47,740
Kay!

1211
02:41:47,950 --> 02:41:50,030
Kiss your godfather.

1212
02:42:14,140 --> 02:42:19,980
Can't go to Vegas. Something's come
up. Everybody has to leave without us.

1213
02:42:20,190 --> 02:42:23,520
- Mike, it's our first vacation!
- Connie, please.

1214
02:42:23,740 --> 02:42:27,860
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.

1215
02:42:28,070 --> 02:42:30,450
I'll only be a couple of days.

1216
02:42:46,510 --> 02:42:49,460
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1217
02:42:50,760 --> 02:42:55,260
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.

1218
02:43:02,400 --> 02:43:07,740
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a
separate car, so you two go on ahead.

1219
02:43:07,950 --> 02:43:11,530
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.

1220
02:43:11,740 --> 02:43:14,280
I can't go either, Sal.

1221
02:43:25,630 --> 02:43:30,590
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.

1222
02:43:30,800 --> 02:43:34,390
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1223
02:43:40,190 --> 02:43:43,440
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

1224
02:43:43,650 --> 02:43:47,690
- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it, Sally.

1225
02:44:32,410 --> 02:44:35,030
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

1226
02:44:40,290 --> 02:44:44,920
- Mike, you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

1227
02:44:45,130 --> 02:44:48,750
That little farce you played
with my sister.

1228
02:44:48,960 --> 02:44:54,010
- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

1229
02:44:54,220 --> 02:44:57,510
- Please, don't do this.
- Sit down.

1230
02:44:59,730 --> 02:45:02,510
Don't do this to me, please.

1231
02:45:11,200 --> 02:45:13,440
Barzini is dead.

1232
02:45:14,950 --> 02:45:17,270
So is Philip Tattaglia.

1233
02:45:18,580 --> 02:45:20,240
Moe Greene.

1234
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:25,330
Strachi. Cuneo.

1235
02:45:26,670 --> 02:45:31,830
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1236
02:45:32,050 --> 02:45:34,590
Admit what you did.

1237
02:45:37,720 --> 02:45:39,930
Get him a drink.

1238
02:45:45,810 --> 02:45:48,100
Come on.

1239
02:45:48,320 --> 02:45:53,440
Don't be afraid, Carlo. Do you think
I'd make my sister a widow?

1240
02:45:54,820 --> 02:45:57,910
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

1241
02:46:04,420 --> 02:46:07,200
Go ahead, drink, drink.

1242
02:46:11,510 --> 02:46:16,130
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.

1243
02:46:16,340 --> 02:46:20,260
You're finished.
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1244
02:46:20,470 --> 02:46:22,020
Tom.

1245
02:46:26,100 --> 02:46:29,850
I want you to stay there. Understand?

1246
02:46:30,070 --> 02:46:32,820
Only don't tell me you're innocent.

1247
02:46:33,610 --> 02:46:38,520
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.

1248
02:46:42,160 --> 02:46:45,250
Who approached you?

1249
02:46:45,460 --> 02:46:48,130
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1250
02:46:55,470 --> 02:46:58,140
It was Barzini.

1251
02:47:01,430 --> 02:47:03,470
Good.

1252
02:47:09,100 --> 02:47:13,230
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

1253
02:47:13,440 --> 02:47:17,310
I'll call your wife and tell her
what flight you're on.

1254
02:47:21,830 --> 02:47:24,530
- Mike...
- Get out of my sight.

1255
02:47:49,600 --> 02:47:51,010
Hello, Carlo.

1256
02:48:50,040 --> 02:48:54,450
- I'm trying to tell you...
- Mama, please!

1257
02:49:03,180 --> 02:49:04,800
Michael!

1258
02:49:05,010 --> 02:49:08,180
- What is it?
- Where is he?

1259
02:49:09,480 --> 02:49:14,470
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

1260
02:49:14,690 --> 02:49:18,640
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.

1261
02:49:18,860 --> 02:49:21,940
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

1262
02:49:22,150 --> 02:49:28,160
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

1263
02:49:28,370 --> 02:49:30,080
Connie.

1264
02:49:31,710 --> 02:49:37,250
Why do you think he kept Carlo at the
Mall? He knew he was going to kill him.

1265
02:49:37,460 --> 02:49:42,970
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold-hearted bastard!

1266
02:49:43,180 --> 02:49:47,260
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

1267
02:49:47,470 --> 02:49:50,920
That's your husband,
that's your husband!

1268
02:49:59,570 --> 02:50:03,400
No! No, no...

1269
02:50:03,610 --> 02:50:07,280
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.

1270
02:50:28,300 --> 02:50:30,210
She's hysterical.

1271
02:50:34,690 --> 02:50:36,640
Hysterical.

1272
02:50:38,440 --> 02:50:41,110
Michael, is it true?

1273
02:50:42,030 --> 02:50:45,640
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?

1274
02:50:45,860 --> 02:50:49,560
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!

1275
02:51:08,590 --> 02:51:10,390
All right.

1276
02:51:12,930 --> 02:51:14,970
This one time.

1277
02:51:18,690 --> 02:51:22,820
This one time I'll let you ask me
about my affairs.

1278
02:51:28,030 --> 02:51:30,870
Is it true?

1279
02:51:33,700 --> 02:51:35,530
Is it?

1280
02:51:37,040 --> 02:51:38,530
No.

1281
02:51:52,220 --> 02:51:55,510
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.

1282
02:52:26,300 --> 02:52:28,700
Don Corleone.
