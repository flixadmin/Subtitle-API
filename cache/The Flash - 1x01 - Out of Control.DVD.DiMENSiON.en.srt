1
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,045
Charlie.

2
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,476
Sam.

3
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,139
Come here.

4
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,385
- Where you been?
- Where I been? I've been getting dinner.

5
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,721
Buddy, got any change?

6
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,991
Thanks.

7
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,742
- It sounded like it came from here.
- Yeah, but I don't see anything.

8
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:29,878
Sure sounded like a scream.

9
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,489
Look out!

10
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,649
Move, Sam! Sam, move.

11
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:38,626
Charlie!

12
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,099
Jack?

13
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,565
Charlie.

14
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,863
Charlie, what are you doing?
Don't touch him.

15
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,803
Oh, my God. It's Jack.

16
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,439
It's up here!

17
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,413
Right here! Right here.

18
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:09,349
- Right over here.
- Yeah, come on.

19
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,046
Come on.

20
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,751
- What...?
- He was right here.

21
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,123
He was right here five minutes ago.

22
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,064
Sure he was, pal.

23
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,030
- Hey, buddy.
- Forget about it, man.

24
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,965
Forget about it.

25
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:27,765
- Sam, he was right here five minutes ago.
- I know.

26
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,875
Good night, guys.

27
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:39,916
Barry.

28
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,621
Barry Allen.

29
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,247
Father Michael.

30
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:49,259
- A little far from your parish, aren't you?
- There's been trouble on the street.

31
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,626
I've been waiting to speak to your
Lieutenant Garfield for two hours.

32
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,061
Garfield.

33
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,702
You'd have an easier time with the pope.

34
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,402
Look, if you're on your way out,
I won't keep you.

35
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,631
No, it's all right. What's the problem?

36
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,572
Several homeless people in my
parish have been disappearing.

37
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:09,113
It's very strange,
and folks are starting to get scared.

38
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,413
Let's talk to the lieutenant.

39
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,651
Father, I wanna help, okay?

40
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:22,625
But you know what these people are like:
No IDs, phony names.

41
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,259
They come, they go.

42
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,227
That's not exactly disappearing.

43
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,766
If you could just assign a couple
extra patrolmen to the area who could...

44
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,769
I can't put more patrolmen
on the skid-row detail unless...

45
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:36,238
...and forgive me for being blunt,
some bodies turn up.

46
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,637
If you'll excuse me, Father,
I need to speak with Officer Allen.

47
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,373
Thank you for your time.

48
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:55,350
Allen, look, so the preacher
was a friend of your brother's, fine.

49
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,120
I'm a church-going man myself.

50
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,494
But you can't start an investigation
based on rumor.

51
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,795
- So you're not gonna do anything.
- It's a question of manpower.

52
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,666
I've got budgetorial problems.

53
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,865
I know you mean well,
but stick to your test tubes.

54
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,511
Sure.

55
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,674
Garfield...

56
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,718
...you haven't been in church
since you were baptized.

57
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:29,923
The human race stands at the doorway
of a brave new world.

58
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,763
Through genetic engineering...

59
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,758
...humanity will soon be able...

60
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,993
...to redesign itself...

61
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,071
...of altering its own evolution.

62
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,600
We can remove the causes
of birth defects...

63
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:48,480
...reduce or eliminate the aging process.

64
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:52,441
Expand our minds and senses.

65
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,846
- Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me.
- Our only limits...

66
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,956
...are our own fears and misconceptions.
- Sorry.

67
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,090
Hey, easy.

68
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,352
- Hey, come on.
- For 2 million years...

69
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,122
...we have lived at the whim of nature.
- Sorry.

70
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:08,529
- I got here as fast as I could.
- So I see.

71
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,596
You look great.

72
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,465
What? Oh, sorry.

73
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:17,837
Today, we hold that future
in our own hands.

74
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,250
Tina.

75
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,291
Hello.

76
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,291
Carl, meet a very good friend of mine,
Barry Allen.

77
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,059
- Barry, Carl Tanner.
- How do you do?

78
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,464
Hi, how are you?

79
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,504
Well, how long has it been?
When was the last time I saw you?

80
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:51,769
The UN science conference
in New York, two years ago.

81
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,845
Carl and my husband and I
were all friends in college.

82
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,812
Rivals, you mean. David and I
were both in love with Tina.

83
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,952
- Oh, Carl.
- Oh, we were. It's true.

84
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,221
- I'm really glad you could make it tonight.
- So am I.

85
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,127
So, Carl,
you're here on a lecture tour, huh?

86
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,265
On a research grant at the university...

87
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,993
...which will put me in town
for about a year.

88
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,601
How's the work going?

89
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,900
Fine. It's pretty technical, and usually
most people wouldn't understand it.

90
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:25,168
Well, I'm up on my recombinant DNA
and gene splicing.

91
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,904
I'm afraid it goes a bit beyond that, Barry.

92
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,707
Try me.

93
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:33,950
Are you familiar with the work of Rosenblat
and Viskovich on genetic reorganization?

94
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,179
Or Petrolo's research
on radical mutation?

95
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,290
Well, of course the real groundbreaking's
going on in Amsterdam.

96
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,051
Van Deckrett and Sheinberg.

97
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,657
Van Deckrett?

98
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,856
Aren't they those TV lawyers?

99
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,501
Try any case for $49.95.

100
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,595
Sorry.

101
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,909
And I also apologize
for getting carried away.

102
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:00,705
It's just that I never get a chance to talk
with someone who shares my work.

103
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:04,473
Really, Carl, your lecture
was very interesting.

104
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:10,418
The end of disease, birth defects,
reversal of the aging process...

105
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,390
...does raise some very interesting
moral questions, though, don't you think?

106
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,927
Well, it's not my responsibility to be
the conscience of the human race.

107
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:21,089
- I'm only a scientist.
- I disagree.

108
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,734
I think we're all responsible.

109
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,898
I'm afraid I do have a very early
appointment tomorrow morning.

110
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:31,805
- Well, let me take you home then.
- Oh, all right.

111
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,606
- Is that okay, Barry?
- Yeah.

112
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,481
Good night.

113
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,677
Carl, I think you should be
careful with your work.

114
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,075
Why?

115
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:12,684
Well, David was working on genetic
research too, and it killed him.

116
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,547
I know about David.

117
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,688
Believe me, that will not happen to me.

118
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,414
Spare change?

119
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,219
I ain't had nothing to eat
since yesterday.

120
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:29,658
- Twenty dollars? Thank you. Thank you.
- That's fine.

121
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,736
That was nice.

122
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,565
He was hungry.

123
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,366
Whenever I see a wasted human life,
it makes me angry somehow.

124
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:39,841
How can you know that his life
is wasted?

125
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,446
You can't make that judgment.

126
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,678
You're right.

127
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,557
Well, here we are.

128
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,055
May I ask you something?

129
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,457
- Of course.
- Lf I hadn't gone to Tokyo that summer...

130
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,758
...leaving you alone with David,
you think we would've had a chance?

131
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,992
Oh, Carl, I don't know.

132
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,569
That was a long time ago.

133
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,603
Doesn't seem like it.

134
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,768
You still have the same effect on me.

135
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,844
Tina.

136
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,793
It's mail call, soldier.

137
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:08,862
And may I divert your attention
to this item in particular.

138
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:13,398
It's from Iris.
Yep, she says Paris is amazing.

139
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:17,030
Her canvasses are selling,
and she just found an apartment.

140
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:19,774
Anything else you'd like to tell me
about my life?

141
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,072
Look, somebody ought to.

142
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,240
Look, man, she's not coming back.

143
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,818
Yeah, I know.

144
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,716
Then you should forget about Iris...

145
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,260
...and move on.

146
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:45,364
Last night you and Tina went out, right?
What was it, a lecture or something?

147
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,939
Well, that's a little dry for my taste,
but it's a start.

148
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,008
- So?
- So...

149
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:56,444
...the guy giving the speech was intelligent,
good-looking, charismatic...

150
00:11:56,615 --> 00:12:00,312
- Wait. You're losing me here.
- An old romance of Tina's.

151
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,717
Well, that's okay. Just ask her out again.
This time, just try something a little more...

152
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,415
You know, like a foreign film,
or maybe a picnic...

153
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:10,391
Julio, Tina and I are friends,
all right?

154
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,623
- Just friends.
- Okay. I'm just trying to help, okay?

155
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,229
What's going on down there?

156
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,499
Hey, yo!

157
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,372
We want some justice here!

158
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:34,315
Hey, listen. If people were dying
in your neighborhood, okay...

159
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:38,389
...you would have stopped it by now.
- Look, everybody, be cool.

160
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,650
We just came to talk.

161
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,818
We don't want any trouble. Please!

162
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,055
Please!

163
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,936
This isn't a town meeting.

164
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,506
- You people disperse now.
- We want justice!

165
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,344
- Let me talk to them.
- What are you, king of the hobos?

166
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,912
Push them back, boys!

167
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,914
- Drop that weapon!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

168
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,993
Don't be foolish, Mickey.

169
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:19,097
- Put the gun down.
- But they don't listen, Father.

170
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,234
- I gotta make them listen!
- This is not the way.

171
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,733
But what about Jack
and Bill and Wesley?

172
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,202
They're gone. They're dead!

173
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,511
- Get him!
- Grab him!

174
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,273
Get him down on the floor!
Get these people out of here.

175
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,848
- Get them out of here!
- Lieutenant Garfield, please.

176
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:42,749
Let him go. I beg you, don't hurt him.
He didn't know what he was doing.

177
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,446
Hey, let him go!

178
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,557
- Let him go!
- All right, I'll release him...

179
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,494
...but you get these people out of here,
or I'll slap their butts in jail.

180
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,065
Let him go!

181
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:01,035
A jail cell's about the only place
these folks would be safe.

182
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,234
Lieutenant. You mind if I take the priest,
maybe a couple of the men up to the lab...

183
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,380
...see if I can help them out?

184
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,845
Suit yourself, Barry.

185
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,921
Nice work, Chaney.

186
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,888
This may be the only opportunity we get.

187
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,690
Sam, Charlie, I want you to tell Julio
and Barry what you told me.

188
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,765
Yeah, okay.

189
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,394
It's like this:

190
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,663
Somebody's killing street people,
and making them disappear.

191
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,204
Are you sure they're dead?

192
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,309
We seen it. We found a dead body
a couple of nights ago.

193
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,240
- This was a guy we knew.
- Yeah.

194
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:41,811
Only he was all messed up.

195
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,441
It was like...

196
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,317
Like his face had turned to putty
or something.

197
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,819
- You mean he was beaten?
- No, man.

198
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,083
No, he wasn't human.

199
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:57,325
We called the cops, but by the time
they showed up, there wasn't any body.

200
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,294
Tell them the other stuff.

201
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,838
There's talk about...

202
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:13,002
...somebody prowling around at night,
offering people money...

203
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,178
...and sticking them with needles.
- Needles. You mean drugs?

204
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,112
I don't know.

205
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,818
Maybe I better come down
to the neighborhood, check it out myself.

206
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,854
Come down to 4th and Willow.

207
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:28,425
You'll find us. We should be going.

208
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:31,560
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

209
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,220
Charlie.

210
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,562
You know, I keep getting this feeling
that we've met before.

211
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,568
We don't hang around
with the same crowd.

212
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,239
Oh, you.

213
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,003
Yeah.

214
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,245
I brought you some groceries.

215
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,121
Follow me.

216
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,736
Why don't you pass those around, Sid.

217
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:57,571
- You live here?
- Yeah. The Ritz was all booked up.

218
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:02,017
Hey, listen, if you think
I'm gonna lie down and kiss your feet...

219
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,417
...just because you came down here,
you can forget it.

220
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,319
Hey, I'm just trying to help out.

221
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,517
Hey, look around, pal.

222
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,562
We need a lot more than help around here.
We need an act of God.

223
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,126
Charlie...

224
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,768
...where you from?

225
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,338
Different places.

226
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,404
Are you sure we haven't met before?

227
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:30,010
I don't know, maybe we have.
Maybe we haven't.

228
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:34,209
I'm kind of dwelling on where
to locate breakfast, you know?

229
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,345
Just stay away from me!

230
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,787
I don't want nothing to do with you.
Stay away!

231
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,354
No!

232
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,526
Hey, I know you.

233
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,362
No! No.

234
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,832
No! Please, no!

235
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,128
It hurts!

236
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,179
It hurts...

237
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,575
No!

238
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,582
- Did you hear that?
- No, not again.

239
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,893
It hurts!

240
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:24,331
Help me...

241
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:57,394
Moore, his face was all twisted and
distorted. I've never seen anything like it.

242
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,764
Are you sure we're talking
about the same guy?

243
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,839
Yeah, he was found in an alley
on skid row last night, right?

244
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,737
Well, that's the guy, all right.

245
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,639
Only...

246
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,342
...he looks okay to me.

247
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,772
For a corpse.

248
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:16,278
I swear,
he did not look like this last night.

249
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,883
What did he die of?

250
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,248
Heart failure, pure and simple.

251
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,491
I need a blood sample.

252
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,131
- I'll send it up to your lab.
- Thanks.

253
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,328
- Father Michael.
- Barry.

254
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,960
The police asked us
to identify Sam's body.

255
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,408
Thanks for all your help.

256
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,482
I thought we were going
out to lunch.

257
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,554
Your disappearance left me
at the mercy of the vending machine.

258
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,690
Sorry. I went home to get this.

259
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,850
- What is that?
- It's a micro-rito.

260
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,088
You put that in your mouth, man?
Here, look at this.

261
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,232
- All right, man.
- What?

262
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,992
- What are you doing?
- Allen.

263
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,136
No, that's not why I brought this.

264
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,202
That's a bad helmet, man.

265
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,637
You're talking about hair?
Give me that.

266
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:12,675
- Look at that shot of you.
- Yeah, yeah. Look at this picture.

267
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,505
Charles Wright.

268
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,972
- That's our guy. Charlie.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

269
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,278
I wanted a second opinion.

270
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,487
- Did you know him?
- Yeah.

271
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,418
He just looks a lot older.

272
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,492
- Guess it's that life on the streets.
- I guess.

273
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,560
I got that blood sample from the coroner.

274
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,323
Run every test you can think of.
I need the results ASAP.

275
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,728
- What am I supposed to look for?
- I don't know.

276
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,802
Something weird. I gotta go downtown.
I'll see you later.

277
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,203
I just don't understand
how he could end up like this.

278
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,778
I don't know Charlie that well,
but the stories aren't all that different.

279
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,245
You get caught in a downward spiral.

280
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,409
You lose your job, can't make your rent,
and suddenly, you're on the street.

281
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,079
I feel like I should do something.

282
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:02,694
What Charlie needs is a job
and a place to live.

283
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:08,730
What are you? Are you nuts? I don't know
anything about science and computers.

284
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,460
No, you don't need to.
It's a night watchman's job.

285
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:15,129
Charlie, I spoke to a friend of mine.
She works there. It's already set up.

286
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,799
- I don't know, man...
- There's a room with a bed and a hot plate.

287
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,543
Yeah, right.

288
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,309
What?

289
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:26,144
All I did was offer you a job.

290
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,576
I'm not a charity case.
I've got my pride.

291
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,154
Well, maybe too much pride.

292
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:35,225
Look, I know you know who I am.
Just quit trying to ease your conscience.

293
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,555
Look, we were friends in school.
That's all.

294
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,061
No, we weren't friends.
We hardly knew each other.

295
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,859
- We know each other now.
- So what?

296
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,264
So what? So...

297
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:48,973
...give it a try.
- Look, I haven't had a job in years, okay?

298
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,511
- What if I screw up?
- They'll fire you.

299
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,776
Come on, Charlie...

300
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,145
...you made it on the street.

301
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,011
You'll make it there.

302
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,200
I like it. Very chic.

303
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:26,968
Well, I guess I better get those
employment papers signed.

304
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,213
Hey, Barry.

305
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,221
Thanks.

306
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,752
I hope it works out.

307
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,028
Yeah.

308
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:46,756
Now, let's you and me go
get something to eat.

309
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:50,060
There's a great Japanese place
right around the corner, just opened up.

310
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:53,295
I'd love to,
but I've asked Carl to dinner.

311
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,271
Really.

312
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:58,272
That's terrific.

313
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,138
Yes, it is.

314
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:15,558
Since I came to town, I've been hearing
a lot of rumors about this Flash.

315
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:20,086
I suppose it's sort of our version
of the Loch Ness Monster.

316
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:23,257
Well, some of the things
they're saying are pretty wild.

317
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:28,303
A man so fast, he's nearly invisible.

318
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:31,499
- You think that's possible?
- Of course not.

319
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:34,873
It's probably the invention
of a clever newsman out to make copy.

320
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,576
You're probably right.

321
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,283
This really is a wonderful house.

322
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,581
It was a complete wreck
when we found it.

323
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:48,485
David and I rebuilt it bit by bit.

324
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:52,896
You know,
sometimes when I come home at night...

325
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:58,525
...I expect to find him pounding nails into
the banister or cursing about split varnish.

326
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,871
I looked up one of David's old papers
in a science journal yesterday.

327
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:08,212
It's funny how close
our lines of research were.

328
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:12,315
Whatever happened to his notes
on genetic reorganization?

329
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,245
Well, I have them at the lab.

330
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,684
- Why?
- Well, I'd love to see them.

331
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,683
I'd prefer if you didn't, Carl.

332
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,827
I am so close right now.

333
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:25,189
So close to something important
with my work.

334
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:29,424
There may be something in David's papers
that would help isolate the flaw in my data.

335
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,167
I can't.

336
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,504
David's research killed him.

337
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,041
Look, I'd rather not talk
about this anymore.

338
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,448
Fine, then we won't.

339
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,412
And I apologize if I've upset you.

340
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,951
It's okay.

341
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,594
It's getting rather chilly.

342
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:58,558
Let's go inside for dessert.

343
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,643
Tina, you forgot your wine.

344
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,083
Every time I ran the DNA tests
on those blood samples you gave me...

345
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,521
...they came out different.
- That's not possible.

346
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,489
Take a look yourself.

347
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:34,656
- We have to run them again, that's all.
- I ran the test four times.

348
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,801
There's something funny
with that sample.

349
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:40,802
The problem is we don't have the kind
of equipment to find out what's going on.

350
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,269
Star Labs does.

351
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,101
Tina.

352
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,642
Carl?

353
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:27,209
I think you've been working way too hard
in that lab of yours.

354
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,613
Did I fall asleep?

355
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,755
I'm so sorry.

356
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,719
I only had one glass of wine.

357
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,382
Tina, you know you never could drink.

358
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,452
Listen, I'm afraid I have to go.

359
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:12,891
Yeah?

360
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,395
Charlie, it's Barry.

361
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,000
Listen, don't worry, I haven't quit yet.

362
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:20,569
That's not why I'm calling.
Listen, is Tina there by any chance?

363
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,731
- Tried her at home, there's no answer.
- No. Afraid not.

364
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,535
She blew out of here hours ago.

365
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,113
Hold it.

366
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,081
The security panel just lit up.

367
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:38,222
Looks like something's going on in Lab 7.
I better call you back.

368
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,350
Charlie?

369
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:36,700
He'll be all right, Barry. But another moment
in that vacuum chamber...

370
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,538
- Anything missing here?
- Nothing obvious.

371
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:43,367
I can't imagine what anyone
would want in here.

372
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,339
All I was trying to do was help him out,
and I nearly get him killed.

373
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,604
It's not your fault, Barry.

374
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:19,936
Barry. Barry, wait.

375
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,418
It's so simple.

376
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,886
How could I have missed it?

377
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:15,319
I think whoever broke into the lab was
looking for David's research notebooks...

378
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,552
...on genetic engineering.

379
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,561
- You know who it is.
- I'm not sure.

380
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:23,223
Come on, Tina.

381
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:26,199
- It's Carl Tanner.
- I can't believe that.

382
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,895
Well, look at the evidence.

383
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,973
His arrival in town coincides
with the skid-row disappearances.

384
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:34,908
Julio tested one of the bodies. The blood
stream was spiked with mutating cells.

385
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,740
What do you think?

386
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,581
You can't protect him
just because you're in love with him.

387
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:45,712
I am not protecting him. And since when
did you become an expert on my love life?

388
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,380
He's using you.

389
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:50,593
You sound almost glad
that Carl might be the killer.

390
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:53,287
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

391
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:56,922
- Aren't you just a little bit jealous?
- No.

392
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:01,597
- Let's just forget this, okay?
- Oh, forget it, huh?

393
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,298
Aren't you being a little childish?

394
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:08,942
Childish? I'm not the one running around
trying to save the world.

395
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,875
You know, if that's how you feel,
maybe we should just...

396
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:17,010
...dissolve this little partnership.
- Yeah, maybe we should.

397
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,838
This thing could be spreading rabies
all over town, Murph.

398
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:44,243
We just gotta hold it
until the animal control gets here.

399
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,213
I don't know about you,
but I smell a big promotion here.

400
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:50,843
You think we can handle this ourselves?
Maybe we should call the SWAT team.

401
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,887
Rabid dog.

402
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:55,651
Well, here we are. Where is it?

403
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:00,355
- Here, poochie. Here, boy.
- Here, poochie.

404
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:03,728
- Here, poochie, poochie.
- Here, poochie, poochie.

405
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,009
Oh, my God. Did you see that?

406
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:20,309
Did I see it? That ain't no mutt.
That's... That's Dogzilla.

407
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,578
Get the shotgun. I'm gonna follow it.

408
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:26,484
- Follow it? What for?
- Just get the shotgun, and call for backup.

409
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:29,023
Bellows, be careful, man.

410
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,297
<i>Unit 24. Unit 24.</i>

411
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,628
<i>We got a beast the size of Guam out here.</i>
<i>Some kind of wild animal.</i>

412
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,737
<i>Corner of Gardner and Fox.</i>
<i>We need a backup.</i>

413
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:55,082
Bellows!

414
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,019
- You all right?
- Yes.

415
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,179
The Flash just saved my neck.

416
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,585
The Flash?

417
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:03,192
- The Flash?
- Murph! I got your call on the radio.

418
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,592
- Are you guys all right?
- Hey, look at this.

419
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,537
I just got one question, guys.

420
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:23,237
- What's that, Murph?
- Who's gonna write up this report?

421
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,275
- There. You see?
- You're right.

422
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,909
I can see the cells mutating.

423
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,886
I've never seen anything like it.

424
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,555
- I have.
- Where?

425
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,225
Right here.

426
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,088
My husband created them.

427
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,826
It was the research he was working on
before he died.

428
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,566
I'm sorry, Barry. You were right.

429
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:20,570
Carl used me.

430
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,330
It's worse than that, Tina.

431
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:25,339
He's been experimenting
on homeless people.

432
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,978
I'm sorry, I've got to stop him.

433
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,140
I'll be waiting here.

434
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,062
It's all over, Tanner.

435
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,271
What are you?

436
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,845
Some kind of government experiment?

437
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:08,011
- Where do you come from?
- It's time to turn yourself in to the police.

438
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:10,278
No! No.

439
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,389
I'm so close. No! No!

440
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,222
Hydrazine.

441
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,693
It's extremely unstable.

442
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,799
Now, you grab me...

443
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,765
...and they'll peel us both off the ceiling.

444
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:30,071
Let's see how fast you really are.

445
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:45,651
There's no way out, Tanner.

446
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,694
- No!
- Hang on!

447
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,213
Murph.

448
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:25,622
Murph, are you all right?

449
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,387
I'm upside down.

450
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:52,110
Carl.

451
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:56,017
I can't go back to the university.
I need your lab.

452
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:59,949
They don't understand
how important my work is.

453
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,115
If they catch me,
then it's all for nothing.

454
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,585
You understand. I know you do.

455
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,424
You murdered people. Innocent people.

456
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,259
It had to be done, Tina.

457
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:13,432
But how could you use
human beings as guinea pigs?

458
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:16,869
Their lives are worthless, I know.

459
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,702
My... My parents were just like them.

460
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,546
My real parents.

461
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,377
They lived in a tenement in filth.

462
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:32,114
- But I thought you...
- Oh, the privileged childhood? The...

463
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:35,053
The big house on the coast?

464
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,453
A lie.

465
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:39,988
An invention to cover my shame.

466
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,858
They should all be cleaned off the streets.
Washed away like dirt.

467
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,199
The formula has to be ionized.

468
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:53,036
I learned that in David's notes.

469
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,475
Carl, don't. I can't let you do this.

470
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:55,035
What do you think?

471
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,201
Carl.

472
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:01,833
Carl, for God's sake, listen to me. Please.

473
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:06,582
You don't know what you're doing.

474
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,848
And if you care about me...

475
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,682
...which I believe you did once...

476
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:17,724
...and if you were ever a friend of David's,
please, I'm begging you, stop.

477
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,724
Because this killed him.

478
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,798
And it will kill you too.

479
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:25,026
You don't understand.

480
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:27,370
But you will.

481
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:29,105
No!

482
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,671
You're really grossing me out, Tanner.

483
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,595
Barry.

484
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:03,733
- Where are you going?
- I've got to stop him.

485
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:06,171
But you're hurt. He'll kill you.

486
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:33,259
- Don't go near. Don't go near.
- Don't touch him.

487
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,920
Stand back.

488
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:36,930
Carl?

489
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,527
Leave me alone.

490
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,835
Don't come near me.

491
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:26,032
