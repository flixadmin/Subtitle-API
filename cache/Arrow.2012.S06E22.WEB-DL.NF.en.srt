00:00:00,083 --> 00:00:01,167
[Oliver]<i>Previously on</i>Arrow...

2
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:02,335
The Quadrant.

3
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,504
You know, I heard about these guys
when I was working undercover,

4
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:06,631
I never could get anyone to confirm
their existence.

5
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:07,882
Yeah, well, they are real.

6
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:10,010
<i>High-end cartel, ruled by moneyed families</i>

7
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,761
<i>with ties to all things black market.</i>

8
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,347
[Oliver] <i>We think Diaz may be
helping her with that operation.</i>

9
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,641
You said you were an honorable man.

10
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:20,478
Now, I think you know Diaz isn't.
Help me stop him.

11
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,733
I'm moving on to Plan B.
Killing Oliver Queen,

12
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:27,235
<i>and everyone he cares about.</i>

13
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,407
Uh, Dad, there's a shell in this one.

14
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,076
Uh, yes, there is.

15
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,703
Oh, isn't the pan hot?

16
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,496
Ow, it's immensely hot,

17
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,375
but when we are doing breakfast
for dinner at <i>Chez</i> Queen,

18
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,502
we do it right.

19
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,504
-Salt me, please, Felicity.
-What?

20
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,632
Can you pass the salt, please,
quickly, when you get the chance.

21
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,263
I cannot put salt on this

22
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,599
if it's gonna put that expression
on your face.

23
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,643
-It's not about the salt, Oliver.
-Okay.

24
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,395
Call me when dinner's ready.

25
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:10,361
Okay, well, you have officially
scared him away, so...

26
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,739
[clears throat] Do you wanna
tell me what's going on with you?

27
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,700
Oliver, it's just... You're in here
pretending like you weren't almost

28
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,494
put in prison for the rest of your life.

29
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,163
Okay, we almost lost you
and the man who tried put you there

30
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,498
is still out there controlling the city,

31
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,541
and you're just in here
scrambling eggs, Oliver.

32
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,834
Yep.

33
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,504
Okay, first, I'm gonna stop him.

34
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:29,881
Second,

35
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,511
I am in here scrambling eggs

36
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,972
because I just wanted a night, one night,

37
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,850
to remind myself what I'm fighting for.

38
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,853
Okay, yeah,
I guess I can compartmentalize that.

39
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,230
I can help you with that.

40
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,610
Arm's strength back.

41
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,362
Motor function's restored.

42
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,532
All signs of the nerve damage
you had are gone.

43
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,160
Do you mind telling me how you did this?

44
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,912
Sorry, Doc, NDA.

45
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,207
So, if he's in the clear,
does that mean no more check ups?

46
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,376
Well, you guys are good to go.

47
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,128
-Enjoy date night.
-Thank you.

48
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,337
Thank you, Doctor.

49
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,089
I'll take care of the paper work.

50
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,133
I think we still have time
to make the shabu-shabu place.

51
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,300
Good.

52
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,931
[Curtis] And over here
is the polymerase inhibitor.

53
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,350
Felicity and I had to take out, like,
three big loans

54
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,726
just to buy it, but it's...

55
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,604
You know, when you asked me
to meet you at your work...

56
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,024
You thought that I had a fantasy
about fooling around in an office?

57
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:33,278
I thought it was your way of milking
another hour out of work.

58
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:37,907
[chuckles] Well, I just thought that
you'd like to see how I spend my days.

59
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,659
I mean, this is some pretty
cutting-edge tech.

60
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,245
Which is gonna make us late
for our reservation.

61
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,289
Okay, Mr. Punctuality.

62
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,291
Let me just shut down the rest
of the equipment.

63
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,251

No, off the post.

Oh, damn.

67
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,931
Okay, you know what,
when everything settles down,

68
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,225
I'm getting us the best seats
in the house.

69
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,269
You do know it's like $400 a ticket.

70
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,896
And they will have obstructed views.

71
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,815
Nah! Anything for my baby, okay?

72
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,191
Dad, quiet.

73
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,652
At least wait for a whistle
if you wanna talk.

74
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,487
Okay, okay.

75
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,705
I'll give you the courtesy of putting
that back in before we start this.

76
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,082

You wanna play that game? Good.

80
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,761
I need to blow off some steam.

81
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,266
My mom and I used to eat
breakfast for dinner all the time,

82
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,353
except it wasn't ironic
'cause she worked nights, so...

83
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,897
I mean, not like that.
At least I hope not like that.

Are you gonna get it, Dad?

86

No, it's one of the perks of being
impeached, no interruptions.

87
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,615
Oliver, get the phone.

88
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,450
The phone.

89
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,701
Okay.

Get down!

93
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,516
When I move, get William to the bedroom,
and shut the door, okay?

Yeah.

112

your head's gonna be throbbing,

Oh, thank God you are all right.

134
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,561
Thank you for coming so quickly.

135
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,479
[Raisa] I was close. Where are the men?

136
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,398
I tied 'em up, they're unconscious.

137
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,735
Hey, I just spoke to Rene, Dinah
and John, they're okay.

138
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,863
Good. And what about Curtis?

139
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,615
He's okay. His boyfriend isn't.
He has to go into surgery.

140

Starling General's not secure.

141
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,619
No, Lyla sent them to the A.R.G.U.S.

142
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,204
Quentin?

143
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,206
Quentin said that Diaz
isn't gonna attack the mayor.

144
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,958
That's too much in the public eye.

145
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,334
But Laurel's in the wind.

146
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,005
What about us?

147
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,631
That's why I called Raisa, okay?

148
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,050
We're gonna put you into A.R.G.U.S.
custody. They're gonna keep you safe.

149
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,677
You're not coming, are you?

150
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,263
No, I have to stay here.

151
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,600
I have to finish this.
You're gonna go with Raisa and Felicity.

152
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,685
Actually, buddy, I'm not coming either.

153
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,106
I would like you
far away from here and safe.

as much as it is yours.

I'm not going anywhere.

As the Green Arrow,

157
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,413
I have gone up
against some terrible people

158
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,665
who have tried to do terrible things.

159
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,250
Hey, look at me.

160
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,710
And I'm still here.

161
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,129
That doesn't mean you always will be.

162
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,672
You're right.

163
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,887
William, I just started
being your dad, okay?

164
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,639
I love being your dad.

165
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,267
And nothing
is gonna take me away from you,

166
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,520
especially not Ricardo Diaz.

167
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,564
Kick his ass.

168
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,114
[Oliver] John and Lyla are on their way?

169
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,116
Yeah, but why are you
having them come here?

170
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,328
Because our bunker is not secure.

171
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,956
Yeah, but why would Diaz
do all of this now?

172
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,749
He could have moved on us months ago.

173
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,334
[sighs] Diaz wanted me in prison

174
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,128
to avoid making a martyr
of the Green Arrow.

175
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,006
With me out of the picture,
he would have come after you.

176
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,927
-Didn't go that way.
-Well, I'm not liking his Plan B.

177
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,388
This is the feed
from our surveillance cameras.

178
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,851
Son of a bitch.

179
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,396
What are we doing just watching?
Let's go there now.

180
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,897
There's no time, Rene.

181
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,651
Diaz has numbers.
Which means he has technical advantage.

182
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,860
John's right.

183
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,657
Bunkers and equipment can be replaced.
We need to look at the big picture.

184
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,534
Our families are on the way
to the safe house.

185
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,661
Better. NORAD bunker in Colorado.

186
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,204
Oh, no, no, no. Not the...

187
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,627
I should have done this months ago.

188
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,755
Torch it.

189
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,234
We leave now, we could snag a couple.
Send a message.

190
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,570
Don't worry you'll get your chance.
Just have patience, Rene.

191
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,821
Dinah's right.

192
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,699
Diaz is making his move.

193
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,288
We will make ours carefully and precisely.

194
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,792
End this tonight.

195
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,552
How much support can we expect
from A.R.G.U.S.?

196
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,222
{\an8}I had to stretch the rules to get
what little resources John has now.

197
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,808
As big a problem as Diaz is
for Star City...

198
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,685
A.R.G.U.S. is small potatoes.

199
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,606
What John means is A.R.G.U.S. isn't
chartered for law enforcement.

200
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,733
It looks like it's just up to us then.

201
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,151
Curtis.

202
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,028
{\an8}[sighs] Hey.

203
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,615
{\an8}-How's Nick?
-He's resting.

204
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,325
{\an8}Post-op.

205
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:03,037
{\an8}It was pretty bad, but he's gonna be okay.

206
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,124
{\an8}-We got lucky.
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

207
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,751
{\an8}He took those bullets for me.

208
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,921
{\an8}Don't worry,
we'll give him payback times 10.

209
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,047
{\an8}Where do we start?

210
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,758
{\an8}Well, we've gotta get a direct intel
on Diaz's location.

211
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,926
{\an8}I'm working on that.

212
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,552
{\an8}All right, and we need some
major league ordinance.

213
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,929
{\an8}[Lyla] That, A.R.G.U.S. can help with.

214
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,390
{\an8}Bennett and I, we are a force multiplier.

215
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,434
{\an8}You know, if we keep going this way,
we're gonna die out there.

216
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,355
{\an8}It doesn't matter how much
weaponry Lyla provides,

217
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,982
{\an8}how angry we are,
how much adrenaline we have,

218
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,944
{\an8}if we just...
If we just press ahead like this,

219
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,279
{\an8}we're all gonna die out there.

220
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,073
{\an8}We haven't worked together in months.

221
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,075
{\an8}You know,
Diaz is not expecting that, at least.

222
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,827
{\an8}[Oliver] He's planned for everything.

223
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,037
{\an8}Us getting back together,
working as a team.

224
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,749
{\an8}It's a start,
but this guy has got an army.

225
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,669
{\an8}He has city officials,
he's got the police,

226
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:52,753
{\an8}he's got everything.

227
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,924
{\an8}Please tell me there's a "but" coming
at the end of this pep talk.

228
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,300
Anatoly can get us in.

229
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,927
I thought he hated your guts.

230
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,762
I think we've come to an understanding.

231
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,433
{\an8}I also think that he might be the one move

232
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,184
{\an8}Diaz does not see coming.

233
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,770
{\an8}Oliver, if that's our tactical advantage,
we need to press it.

234
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,982
{\an8}Let me set a meet with him. Okay?

235
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,276
{\an8}Let us make a move off of his intel,

236
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,694
{\an8}but until we have it,

237
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,406
{\an8}I want you guys to stand down and I...

238
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,117
{\an8}I'm asking you to trust me.

239
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,538
{\an8}I know that that trust does not come easy

240
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,206
{\an8}after everything's that's happened.

241
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,169
{\an8}Let's put all of that aside

242
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,422
{\an8}and get this done.

243
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,680
{\an8}[speaking Russian]

244
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,641
{\an8}[in English]
My family is alive thanks to you.

245
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,436
{\an8}Please save gratitude
for when I'm sipping on

246
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,104
{\an8}umbrella straw on beach,

247
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,772
{\an8}safe and sound in Maldives.

248
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,696
{\an8}I don't know how long your family's
safety is going to last.

249
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,867
{\an8}SCPD has instructions, kill on sight.

250
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,203
{\an8}Diaz's base of operations is too secure.

251
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,539
{\an8}We can't move on it without losing people.

252
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,124
{\an8}Agreed.

253
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,752
{\an8}Best bet to get him on move.

254
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,879
In transit, so to speak.

255
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,173
Well, but he's gonna expect us
to hit back.

256
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,550
I'd expect him to stay where he's secure.

257
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,512
Perhaps I can think of something
to motivate him.

258
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,264
I'm asking a lot of you.

259
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,768
I appreciate it.

260
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,645
You cannot wage revolution

261
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,688
in white gloves.

262
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,110
Lenin had many faults,

263
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,613
but he was right about that.

264
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:50,287
You wanna stop pacing?
Giving me a headache.

265
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,623
Funny, I was going to say the same to you.

266
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,669
Your pitch to the Quadrant
was that you controlled this city.

267
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,878
And I do.

268
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,548
Then why have you turned it
into a war zone tonight?

269
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,551
I thought we couldn't let the vigilantes
be turned into martyrs.

270
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,388
The judge kicked the case
and let Oliver Queen walk.

271
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:10,558
So you switched gears
from careful and precise

272
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,142
to loud and messy?

273
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:17,231
Your attitude is what I find...

274
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,777
to be unwanted.

275
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,113
Be careful, Ricardo.

276
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,698
You've already given us the city.

277
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,536
Are you suggesting that

278
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,248
I'm replaceable?

279
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,001
I'm suggesting no such thing.

280
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:46,260
Miss Cassamento
does not appear to be pleased.

281
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:49,138
-What happened tonight?
-You underestimate your enemy.

282
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,723
They're strong and motivated.

283
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,308
They got lucky.

284
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,935
Luck, strength, what does it matter?

285
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:59,106
You did not kill bees.
You merely poked the hive.

286
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,317
Bees will be agitated.

287
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,445
You think they're gonna come here?
That's fine.

288
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,654
Let them bring it on.

289
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,989
Bring them here?

290
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,536
This place, lovely,

291
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,538
but not secure.

292
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,624
At least not enough

293
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,876
for what you know
they're going to come after you with.

294
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,384
[Oliver] Anatoly did it.

295
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,387
Diaz will be on his way
to the SCPD in an hour.

296
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,723
A.R.G.U.S. doesn't have the authority
to arrest Diaz,

297
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,809
so once you have him in custody,
what's the next step?

298
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,145
Yeah, Lyla's right. We can't just
hand him over to the police.

299
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:41,982
And, no offense, but your Lian Yu
super max is kind of blown up.

300
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,276
One problem at a time.

301
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,821
All right, we need to end this
and that means solving our first problem.

302
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,281
Getting Diaz.

303
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,369
Can I say it for old times' sake?

304
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,205
Suit up.

305
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,760
In Russia, we travel in nicer cars.

306
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,515
This girl ain't pretty,
but she's bullet proof.

307
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,438
What's that?

308
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,985
Construction?

309
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,948
Hold up, guys.
We gotta move this forklift.

318
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,908
You hurt someone I care about!

319
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,744
You want some more?

320
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,620
You...

321
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,080

322

[Mr. Terrific] [cries out]

00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,263
[gun cocking]

324
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,516
[grunts]

325
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,026
Quadrant reinforcements with SCPD
and more are on the way.

326
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,194
We gotta pull out now.

327
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,779
[siren wailing]

328
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,214
[John] We almost got that son of a bitch.

329
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,715
[Rene] How's Curtis?

330
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,884
[Dinah Drake] He's resting with Nick.

331
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,387
One inch either way,
he would have bled out. He got lucky.

332
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,515
-It wasn't just luck.
-What do you mean?

333
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,350
Diaz could have killed Curtis,

334
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,520
but he went for some sort of
necklace instead.

335
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,772
Must be one damn important
piece of jewelry.

336
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,148
More like a piece of tech. Look.

337
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:32,861
It's a GRV-657. Solid state drive,
military grade, dynamic encryption.

338
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,114
Whatever is on it,
Diaz has gone through some major trouble

339
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,657
{\an8}to keep it secure and close though.

340
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,492
{\an8}This looks like something we should
have our hands on.

341
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,994
Wait, how do we know?
There could be nothing on it.

342
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,955
You just said so yourself.
I mean, Diaz went after this

343
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,123
instead of going after Curtis.

344
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,875
Your digital sniffer,
can it read the drive?

345
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,585
Yeah. If you get me close enough,
for sure.

346
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,087
But Diaz is headed to SCPD.

347
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,588
I'm sure he's gonna let us
stroll right in.

348
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,840
They'll let me.

349
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:56,844
What do you mean? Diaz knows that
A.R.G.U.S. is working against him.

350
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,304
The police still have to
keep up appearances.

351
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,975
Wouldn't look good if they decline
a visit from the head of a federal agency.

352
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,645
And if things go south,
I've got you to back me up.

353
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:11,233
I think that this is a big gamble
for an unknown pay off.

354
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,776
It probably is, Oliver,

355
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,612
but it might be our only shot.

356
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,948
So, we're all on board here?

357
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,826
Yeah.

358
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,370
[Diaz] Double perimeter security.

359
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,372
Next time I see Oliver Queen,

360
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,457
I want his head on a spike.

361
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,876
You got it, boss.

362
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,961
Where's the tech kid?

363
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,296
Cosby's over there.

364
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,385
Oh, Mr. Diaz.

365
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:42,097
I need to know if what's on this
is still intact

366
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,183
without you looking at the data.

367
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,186
-Can you do that?
-Uh...

368
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,189
Your grandma's life depends on it.

369
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,858
Yes, sir.

370
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,359
[exhales]

371
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,120
[Diaz] Close the door.

372
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,877
[choking]

373
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,128
They knew!

374
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,172
Who? Knew what?

375
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,757
That I was moving!

376
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:21,428
That my men were coming for them tonight!

377
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:27,059
Laurel, she's buttoned up, right?

378
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,230
Who could've told them?

379
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,898
I do not know.

380
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,274
Hmm?

381
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,859
You and Queen,

382
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,320
you go way back.

383
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,655
Yes.

384
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,866
Which is why his betrayal hurts so much.

385
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,455
If it wasn't you,

386
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,255
then who?

387
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,714
Hmm?

388
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,593
Who brought men and police
to help us tonight?

389
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,767
-Cassamento.
-How did she know we'd be attacked?

390
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,812
I did not ask for backup.

391
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,480
Did you?

392
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,234
Why would she tip off Queen,

393
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,946
and then drag our asses

394
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,324
out of the fire?

395
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,369
That doesn't make sense.

396
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,664
Yes, it does
if she wants leverage over you.

397
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,624
To make you grovel.

398
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,754
Truth be telling,
I do many times before in Bratva.

399
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,424
I don't grovel.

400
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,345
How's it going with the sniffer?

401
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,806
Oh, just snifferific.

402
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,641
I am programming it to specifically

403
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,060
couple with the digital signature
of Diaz's drive.

404
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,603
I'll have to do some
on the fly programming

405
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,148
just to cut out the noise,
but totally in my wheelhouse.

406
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,651
Does this absolutely
have to be done on site?

407
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:03,196
It absolutely does if you would
absolutely like it to work. Why?

408
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,745
Oliver, you do know I have been
on the field before, right?

409
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,830
Russia. Twice.

410
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,499
Nanda Parbat, Merlyn Global.

411
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,501
That all happened
before you were a parent.

412
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,503
Well, if it will make you feel any better,

413
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,839
I will not be the one
infiltrating the precinct.

414
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,049
That'll be Lyla.

415
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,343
The same Lyla who's also a parent.

416
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:25,844
And whose husband didn't blink twice

417
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,305
when she volunteered
to go into Diaz's dragon den.

418
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:29,931
Lyla's a soldier.

419
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,892
Yeah, which is why
she's the one infiltrating

420
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,435
and I'm the one hacking remotely.

421
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,689
I'm not gonna do anything stupid.

422
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,069
-Do we have a problem here?
-No.

423
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,071
Ready when you are.

424
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,667
All I have to do is position this
some place central?

425
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,212
Yes, if Diaz's drive is in that building,
the sniffer will find it.

426
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,880
I can monitor the transfer from here,

427
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,423
but I need this back for the full pull.

428
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,050
How much time do you need
for the transfer?

429
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,094
-A couple of minutes, max.
-Copy that.

430
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,765
-Everybody in position?
-In position.

431
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,809
First hint, if anything's wrong,
signal us.

432
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,685
Copy. We move in five.

433
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,023
Everything okay?

434
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:23,860
Yeah, it's just that it's so nice to
see how you and John, you know, work.

435
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,862
When you're on the field,
you guys are so in sync.

436
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,072
How do you do it?

437
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:29,574
You're asking for marital advice now?

438
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,076
Sorry. Yeah, totally terrible timing.

439
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,787
It's just that Oliver doesn't even
want me here,

440
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,498
so I just thought maybe a tip
or two would work.

441
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,835
We always knew our lives
would be high risk.

442
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,587
Eventually, we got to a point where

443
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,840
worrying about that seemed less important

444
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,800
than enjoying the time we have together.

445
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,927
Even if that was on a battlefield.

446
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:54,015
Also, getting divorced helps.

Where can I find your captain?

451
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,164
We're kind of between captains

452
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,916
since our ex-mayor fired the last one.

453
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,459
What's A.R.G.U.S. doing here?

454
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,670
Investigating Ricardo Diaz.

455
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,963
Never heard of him.

456
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,257
Be that as it may, I'm gonna need
to see you CompStat reports

-Yes, sir.

it's Corto Maltesean in origin.

What does that mean?

I mean, I don't know,
but if I was betting, financial records.

What if these are all Diaz's books?
Everyone he has on his payroll?

474

00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,443
-What?
-It's happening on site somehow.

479
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,321
Some bitch from A.R.G.U.S. is here.

480
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,573
She wants to look at our CompStat reports.

481
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,742
No, she doesn't.

482
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,494
Lyla, we're done. Grab the sniffer.

483
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,997
Agent Michaels, can I talk to you
for a minute?

484
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,874
They're on to us.

485
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,961
Forget the device. Just get out of there.

486
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,095
Director Michaels,

487
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,305
I heard you're interested in me.

488
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,641
Honey,

489
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,685
you better get in here.

490
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,812
[gunshots in distance]

491
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,522
Oh, frack it.

492
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,526
[groaning]

493
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,867
[gunshots]

494
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,289
[grunts]

495
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,790
[indistinct shouting]

496
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,587
[grunting]

497
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,177
Hey!

498
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,471
Sorry! I'm sorry!

499
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,406
[Lyla] That was an all-out fight
with the SCPD.

500
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,033
Totally nuts, even by my standards.

501
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,159
Yes, but it was the only option though.

502
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,702
I mean, this was too important not to get.

503
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,954
How would you even know?
This is supposed to be encrypted.

504
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,789
Well, you can just call me an optimist
because I'm thinking

505
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,916
in two to three hours,
all of us are gonna be extremely happy.

506
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,002
Can you gather information as it decrypts?

507
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,378
It would be nice to get a jump on things.

508
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,130
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no.

509
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,632
This is an all or nothing type deal, okay?

510
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,677
We go in mid-decryption
and the whole drive wipes.

511
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,804
-Nothing.
-Felicity, may I speak with you?

512
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,306
[Felicity] Yes.

513
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,149
I'm just gonna take a wild guess

514
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,817
and say that this isn't
one of those conversations

515
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,819
that starts with like,
"I love you, you were brave,

516
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,029
you go, that was awesome."

517
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:39,491
No, this is a conversation that
happens because I love you.

518
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:40,950
Okay.

519
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,535
You promised me you would stay put.

520
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,120
Well, I didn't exactly promise.

521
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,081
Fine, you promised me
that you wouldn't do anything stupid.

522
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,999
You charged into a firefight.

523
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,501
Which was a calculated risk.

524
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,587
Did you calculate how close
Ricardo Diaz came

525
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,130
to shooting you in the back of the head?

526
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,465
We got what we wanted.

527
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,841
It's not...

528
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,636
And if I'm right, what we wanted

529
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,764
has the list of everyone in the city
that Diaz controls.

530
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,811
This could help us get our home
back from Diaz, Oliver.

531
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,980
We could actually save our city
this time around.

532
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,317
I think that's a little bit more
important than what ifs.

533
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,152
This is why I started working alone again.

534
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,404
Yeah.

535
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,738
You know what? I tried convincing myself

536
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,740
that that was the right move too,
but it's not

537
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,033
because we're married.

538
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,411
And we're supposed to be
each other's strength.

539
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,413
So there is no alone for us anymore.

540
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,206
It's not that simple and you know it.

541
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,417
God, I'm really gonna start needing
you to see it that way.

542
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,512
Hey. What the hell are you doing here?

543
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,764
I heard Felicity might have got hold
of Diaz's payroll,

544
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,391
so I hitched a ride back with John.

545
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:47,726
I can help with the decryption. [grunts]

546
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,853
Whoa, whoa, Curtis. Hey, are you crazy?

547
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,521
You are in no shape to be up and about.

548
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,649
A deranged madman attacked everyone
I hold dear and near to me.

549
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,484
I'll nap later.

550
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:01,156
He also made you almost bleed out,
so I need you to stop, okay?

551
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,199
Curtis.

552
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,744
How is me resting gonna help
anything, Dinah?

553
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,663
Okay. But being reckless isn't
gonna help anything either.

554
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,874
He almost killed my man.

555
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,084
What do you expect my reaction to be?

556
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,044
Exactly the same as mine.

557
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,213
I'm sorry, I...

558
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,550
I wasn't thinking about Vincent.
I'm so sorry, Dinah.

559
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,802
You shouldn't be thinking about Vincent.

560
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,721
You need to be thinking about Nick.

561
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,889
[sighs]

562
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,933
Just please don't go about this
the same way that I did, Curtis.

563
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,810
Blind with rage.

564
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,855
Remember how you had to talk me down?

565
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,483
I remember my advice not really taking.

566
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,401
[chuckles] Yeah.

567
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,987
But you're a lot smarter than me.

568
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,200
Look, Nick is lying
in a hospital bed right now.

569
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,869
If you don't take it easy,
you're gonna end up right back in one.

570
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,538
We got this. Go be with him.

571
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,377
That's absurd. Why would I tip off
the Green Arrow

572
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,712
only to save you from him?

573
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,214
You tell me.

574
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,217
You're delusional.
You ought to be thanking me.

575
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,969
I hacked, and I hacked,

576
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,555
and I back-traced where
Felicity Smoak took your clone data.

577
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,432
We can get there before she decrypts it.

578
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,770
Good work. Call everyone.

579
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,147
-We're going to war.
-War?

580
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:19,067
You've already shot up two apartments
and a hospital.

581
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,653
To say nothing about what happened
in your own police station.

582
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:22,904
Your point?

583
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,407
You're out of control
and out of your depth, Ricardo.

584
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,576
We accepted you
into the Quadrant because...

585
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,037
[gasping]

586
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,289
So sorry, I couldn't hear you.

587
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,292
You have something stuck in your throat.

588
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,086
Aah!

589
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,841
Clean this up.

590
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:48,346
Felicity says that the decryption
is only at about 40%.

591
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,598
I'm sure she's working as fast as she can.

592
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,724
[John] Well, I'm quite sure she is,

593
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,434
but maybe we need to come up
with a backup plan

594
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,395
just in case this doesn't pan out
the way we think.

595
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,980
I agree.

596
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,857
And I'm open to suggestions.

597
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,486
The first thing is

598
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,197
figuring out what is going on
in your head.

599
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,408
Yeah, what else you guys talk about?

600
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:10,285
I may have prodded her a bit,

601
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,371
but, Oliver, I really didn't need to.

602
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,206
Everyone can see the tension
between the two of you.

603
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,458
Well, John,
I asked her not to go into the field.

604
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,378
And she did.

605
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,089
And I'm sorry that she thinks
I'm changing the rules for her,

606
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:27,051
but I am changing the rules for her
because things have changed.

607
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,136
William.

608
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,097
Diaz's people attacked us in our home.

609
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,143
Sitting down for a meal in our home.

610
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,104
So don't ask me to sit here and pretend
like things aren't different.

611
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:43,776
And you told me
that I had spread myself too thin,

612
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,361
and I listened to what you said.

613
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,072
And I took it to heart
and I made some changes.

614
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,619
She went into the field tonight,
she split my focus

615
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,704
and it could have
gotten both of us killed.

616
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:55,872
-But it didn't.
-Well...

617
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:59,125
The truth is,
you were there for her tonight.

618
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,337
The same way she's been there
for you as Overwatch.

619
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,339
[Oliver sighs]

620
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,758
And look,
when I said that your focus was split,

621
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:11,012
I didn't mean throwing away
everything and everyone

622
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,555
that gives you strength.

623
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,725
[alarm buzzing]

624
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,815
Diaz is here with an army.

625
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,819
[sighs]

626
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,572
[guns cocking]

627
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,539
Oliver Queen doesn't make it out alive!

628
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,588
[Felicity] Tricyclic gas
is filling the building.

629
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,048
This is Diaz.

630
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,675
His men breached the northeast entrance.

631
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,426
Between that and the gas,
we don't have a lot of time.

632
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,552
Are there any other ways out of here?

633
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,763
South corridor, there's a secret
stairwell that leads to street level.

634
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:57,392
If anything goes sideways, Curtis rigged
the whole place to go boom.

635
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,185
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
All right, we gotta go.

636
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,729
-Not yet.
-Felicity, we have to go now.

637
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,147
The decryption is not done.

638
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,149
I'm not leaving until it's done.
Do not fight me on this.

639
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,194
Everyone else has to go. We will catch up.

640
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,114
[Rene] Just in case.

641
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,249
[Diaz] I'll cover you. Go!

642
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,612
[Black Canary] Get out of here!
Go, get out of here!

643
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,865
[screeching]

644
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,746
Come on! Come on!

645
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,601
I had him, honey. Let's go.

646
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,144
[Felicity coughing]

647
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,979
-How much time do we have?
-Five minutes.

648
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,314
We don't have five minutes, Felicity.

649
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,524
-You have to get out of here.
-No chance.

650
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,693
Once the decryption is done,
I'm gonna e-mail it to you

651
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,986
and basically to the entire world.

652
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,363
[coughing]

653
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,948
Hey, hey. You okay?

654
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,992
This is our last chance, Oliver.

655
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,453
This could be our only chance to stop him.

656
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,413
Let me try. William needs you.

657
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,290
William needs us.

658
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,751
[coughing]

659
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,753
I'm gonna find another way.

660
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,715
Come on.

661
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:57,053
-How may flights are there?
-A lot.

662
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,848
[both coughing]

663
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,854
Where's Oliver and Felicity?

664
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,443
Okay, we're almost there, Felicity.

665
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,737
You can do this. Hey!

666
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,074
[coughing, gasping]

667
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,249
[Diaz] I was just coming to kill you.

668
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,793
Looks like you met me halfway.

669
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,548
[groaning]

670
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,137
[cries out]

671
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,889
What hurts more, do you think?

672
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,016
Me killing her in front of you,

673
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,893
or you in front of her?

674
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,728
[grunts]

675
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,106
[coughing]

676
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:55,153
You'll do anything to keep her safe,
won't you?

677
00:35:56,112 --> 00:36:00,658
Love, that's the real king killer.

678
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,413
Click it.

679
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:27,185
[John] Oliver! Come on,
let's get them out of here!

680
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,230
[rumbling]

681
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,161
I'm so sorry about your men, Lyla.

682
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,663
Bennett was a good soldier.

683
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,916
They all were.

684
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,168
We should go back.

685
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,753
I wanna see Diaz's body.

686
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,006
I sent in a forensics team.

687
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,843
-He wasn't there.
-[scoffs]

688
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,387
Son of a bitch has nine lives.

689
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,598
I'm sorry.

690
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,559
Did Felicity finish the decryption?

691
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,394
No.

692
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,357
No, she had to leave it.

693
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,942
Where does that put us?

694
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:16,984
[scoffs]

695
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,195
Absolutely nowhere.

696
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,574
[Oliver] I know, buddy. We miss you too.

697
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,828
Well, it's gonna be a few more days,

698
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,914
but we're safe, okay?

699
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:31,832
We're both safe.

700
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,835
Hey, we love you, William.

701
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:38,839
Bye, kiddo.

702
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,678
-Is he okay? How's he doing?
-He's okay.

703
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,472
He's scared, but, you know, he's safe

704
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,767
and just wants all of this to be over.

705
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,143
Yeah, yeah.

706
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,312
Don't we all.

707
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,733
[Oliver] Hey, I'm, uh...

708
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,654
I shouldn't have pushed you away.

709
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:05,992
I should have trusted you
to keep yourself safe,

710
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:10,830
and I should have trusted my abilities
to help keep you safe.

711
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,207
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

712
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:18,045
It's good to know after all these years
that you can still learn something.

713
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,840
You know, I still have ways to go.

714
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,174
That's true.

715
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,220
[sighs] So what now?

716
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,974
[sighs]

717
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,058
I have an idea.

718
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,356
Thank you for coming.

719
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:43,446
I asked you here because we lost
another Quadrant member last night.

720
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:48,117
You see, I don't mind partners

721
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,203
when they're loyal.

722
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,500
It turns out Miss Cassamento wasn't.

723
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:59,879
So what I have to decide right now

724
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:05,926
is whether you two
fall into that same category.

725
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,888
You wanted in the Quadrant, you're in.

726
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,307
This doesn't have to be adversarial.

727
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,351
See, that's the thing.

728
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,853
Me wanting in,

729
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,898
I always thought

730
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,025
that I wanted that.

731
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,110
And I realized,

732
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,739
it's just not enough.

733
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,991
You don't want a partnership.

734
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,453
You want a controlling stake.

735
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,916
Guilty.

736
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,251
[grunts]

737
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,172
Let's try this again.

738
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,049
May I?

739
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,720
We have the Quadrant's resources.

740
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,680
We got its muscle,

741
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,266
its connections.

742
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,398
All I need

743
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,527
is loyalty.

744
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,656
The Quadrant's running out of members.

745
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,659
Do I have it?

746
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,427
[Oliver] So far,
Ricardo Diaz has been unstoppable.

747
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,846
He has aligned himself

748
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:35,057
with the most powerful
criminal organization in the country.

749
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:38,352
He controls Star City's government,
its infrastructure

750
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,146
and its police force.

751
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,650
I can't stop him on my own.

752
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,864
And when you say you can't stop him,

753
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,199
are you speaking as the former mayor

754
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,577
or as someone else?

755
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,540
You want my help,

756
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,251
I'm gonna need two things from you.

757
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,420
The first is,

758
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,172
I'm gonna need you to say the words.

759
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,093
I am the Green Arrow.

760
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:14,388
And the truth shall set you free.

761
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,348
What's the second thing?
