1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:03,964
My name is Oliver queen.

2
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:07,101
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:07,103 --> 00:00:09,538
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,873
to save my city.

5
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:16,945
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:16,947 --> 00:00:22,134
To honor my friend's memory,
I must be someone else.

7
00:00:22,136 --> 00:00:25,554
I must be something else.

8
00:00:26,685 --> 00:00:29,852
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:32,934
Time to choose, Oliver.

10
00:00:32,936 --> 00:00:34,987
Who lives
and who dies.

11
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:36,121
Because in 30 seconds,
I will shoot them both.

12
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:38,323
You got what
you came for!

13
00:00:38,325 --> 00:00:40,125
I guess you made
your choice. Time's up.

14
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:41,743
No!

15
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:46,498
If you stick that
in me, I'll kill you.

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,500
No, brother Roy,
you'll kill for me.

17
00:00:48,502 --> 00:00:50,502
Where'd you get
the Mirakuru?

18
00:00:50,504 --> 00:00:52,287
It was a gift.
A gift I would use

19
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,656
to save this city
from itself.

20
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:12,387
Whoa, oh, ahh!

21
00:02:12,868 --> 00:02:14,452
Ahh! Oh!

22
00:02:14,454 --> 00:02:16,454
The man in the skull
mask, who is he?!

23
00:02:16,456 --> 00:02:18,573
I--I don't know!

24
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:20,908
You're the biggest street dealer
in Crescent Circle.

25
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,411
You know everything that
goes on over there.

26
00:02:23,413 --> 00:02:24,846
Who is he?!

27
00:02:24,848 --> 00:02:26,381
I ain't seen the guy before!

28
00:02:26,383 --> 00:02:28,683
A skull mask,
are you freaking kidding me?!

29
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:30,335
Come on, man,
I'm still on parole!

30
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:32,353
Not anymore.

31
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,028
A spokesman for the
Central City mayor's office confirmed

32
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,097
the lack of any damage
or radioactive fallout

33
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:46,568
from the explosion that rocked
S.T.A.R. Labs five weeks ago.

34
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,406
Is Felicity
not back yet?

35
00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:53,741
She said she wanted to spend
a few more days with Barry.

36
00:02:53,743 --> 00:02:57,211
Any improvement
in his condition?

37
00:02:57,213 --> 00:02:58,880
Still comatose.

38
00:02:58,882 --> 00:03:00,632
How'd it go out there tonight?

39
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:02,500
Same as every other
pointed conversation

40
00:03:02,502 --> 00:03:04,669
I have with these lowlifes
in Crescent Circle.

41
00:03:04,671 --> 00:03:06,220
Nobody...

42
00:03:06,222 --> 00:03:09,057
has seen a man
in a skull mask.

43
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:12,427
But he's still
out there.

44
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:14,462
Oliver, for the past
five weeks,

45
00:03:14,464 --> 00:03:16,264
you've pushed yourself
pretty hard looking for this guy.

46
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:18,232
He has the Mirakuru,
Diggle!

47
00:03:18,234 --> 00:03:22,487
I mean, you saw
what it took to kill one guy

48
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:23,821
that had been injected.

49
00:03:23,823 --> 00:03:25,523
We practically had to drop
a building on him.

50
00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:27,692
So imagine ten
or a hundred,

51
00:03:27,694 --> 00:03:29,694
imagine a thousand.

52
00:03:29,696 --> 00:03:31,696
You said Roy was injected.

53
00:03:31,698 --> 00:03:33,197
Yeah.

54
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,084
I've just never seen you
spooked like this before.

55
00:03:36,086 --> 00:03:39,087
That should
tell you something.

56
00:03:41,407 --> 00:03:45,407

58
00:03:52,134 --> 00:03:55,303
Shado always told me
that I wouldn't die here.

59
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,139
But looking back,
I realized

60
00:03:58,141 --> 00:04:00,525
that she never once
said that about herself.

61
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:04,312
I just hope she's
with her father now.

62
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:19,293
Here, kid.

63
00:04:22,381 --> 00:04:24,132
She'd want you
to have that.

64
00:04:24,134 --> 00:04:27,118
You're the one she cared for.

65
00:04:42,601 --> 00:04:44,585
Slade...

66
00:04:44,587 --> 00:04:46,938
Hey, Ollie,
just give him space.

67
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,656
I can't keep lying to him, Sara.

68
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:50,274
I need to tell him
how Shado really died.

69
00:04:50,276 --> 00:04:53,394
Ivo killed Shado.
He pulled the trigger.

70
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:55,713
Because I chose to save you.

71
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,001
He needs to know the truth.

72
00:05:00,003 --> 00:05:01,786
Wait, Ollie, he--
Get off me.

73
00:05:01,788 --> 00:05:03,955
He has the Mirakuru
in his system now.

74
00:05:03,957 --> 00:05:06,257
What does that
have to do with anything?

75
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:08,459
Look, the Japanese,
they experimented

76
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:11,012
on hundreds of men
working to develop Mirakuru.

77
00:05:11,014 --> 00:05:12,964
And I read
the research.

78
00:05:12,966 --> 00:05:14,632
The people who died?

79
00:05:14,634 --> 00:05:16,167
They were
the lucky ones.

80
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:18,519
The ones who survived,
they were deformed.

81
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:20,338
Either their bones
or their minds.

82
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,190
They became
someone else.

83
00:05:32,234 --> 00:05:35,636
You summoned me here
for a drink?

84
00:05:35,638 --> 00:05:37,071
You certainly look
dressed for it.

85
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:39,607
No, I...
have a date.

86
00:05:39,609 --> 00:05:41,042
What are you working on?

87
00:05:41,044 --> 00:05:42,960
Something to do
with Sebastian Blood.

88
00:05:42,962 --> 00:05:45,463
Aka the next mayor
of Starling City.

89
00:05:45,465 --> 00:05:46,831
Well, maybe
he shouldn't be.

90
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,583
What does that mean?
I've just been doing

91
00:05:48,585 --> 00:05:50,885
some investigating.
Blood had a connection

92
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:53,221
to the Langford
psychiatric institute.

93
00:05:53,223 --> 00:05:55,223
The one that burnt down
under very

94
00:05:55,225 --> 00:05:57,225
mysterious
circumstances.

95
00:05:57,227 --> 00:05:59,527
Do the police suspect arson?
No.

96
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:01,062
They're saying that
it's inconclusive.

97
00:06:01,064 --> 00:06:03,648
But Blood also knew
Cyrus Gold--

98
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,884
the man that shot
and killed four police officers.

99
00:06:06,886 --> 00:06:08,569
Laurel, where are you
going with this?

100
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:10,905
I don't know.
But I do have to go.

101
00:06:10,907 --> 00:06:13,241
I'm going
to be late.

102
00:06:13,243 --> 00:06:15,359
So who's the lucky guy?

103
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:18,696
Sebastian Blood.

104
00:06:20,082 --> 00:06:23,434
So, please,
join me in our efforts

105
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:25,503
to send Starling's
favorite son there.

106
00:06:25,505 --> 00:06:28,456
To Sebastian Blood.
Sebastian for Starling.

107
00:06:32,928 --> 00:06:34,462
Thank you, Oliver.

108
00:06:34,464 --> 00:06:36,764
And not just for your support,

109
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:38,883
but also for your friendship.

110
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:41,052
And thank all of you
for coming.

111
00:06:41,054 --> 00:06:44,305
You know, when Oliver
calls me a son of Starling City,

112
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:46,340
it feels like
the literal truth.

113
00:06:46,342 --> 00:06:48,276
I was a street orphan,

114
00:06:48,278 --> 00:06:50,561
and this city raised me
as one of its own.

115
00:06:50,563 --> 00:06:53,218
I am the man that
I am today because

116
00:06:53,243 --> 00:06:54,483
of my Starling City family.

117
00:06:54,484 --> 00:06:56,734
So it's time that
I start to give back.

118
00:06:56,736 --> 00:06:58,686
So thank you all
for your support.

119
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:09,297
Nice speech, Ollie.

120
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:10,965
Who knew you cared so much
about politics?

121
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:13,117
Well, I care about
the city, and...

122
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:15,720
Sebastian has become
something of a friend.

123
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:19,507
He's got a way
of doing that, apparently.

124
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:22,677
That's very cute.

125
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,178
Speaking of which,
how's Ray?

126
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,315
Handsome, brooding, usual.

127
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:30,268
Why is my boyfriend
such a topic of interest?

128
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,604
Well, Thea, his idol
put an arrow in him, and I just...

129
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:35,573
Wanted to make sure
there weren't any lingering issues.

130
00:07:35,575 --> 00:07:37,975
Oh, my God.
Now that I think about it,

131
00:07:37,977 --> 00:07:41,379
you know, he did something
completely out of character this morning.

132
00:07:41,381 --> 00:07:42,530
What?

133
00:07:42,532 --> 00:07:44,282
He showed up for work on time.

134
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:47,535
Thea! Oh, it's--

135
00:07:47,537 --> 00:07:48,736
it's just wonderful.

136
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:50,705
Proud to my civic duty.

137
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:52,440
No, I'm the one
who's proud.

138
00:07:52,442 --> 00:07:56,127
You've taken Oliver's...hobby,
and turned it into

139
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:57,545
a successful
business.

140
00:07:57,547 --> 00:08:01,382
Hobby?
Oh, sweetheart.

141
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:05,052
Oliver.

142
00:08:05,054 --> 00:08:06,304
Ah.

143
00:08:06,306 --> 00:08:08,189
Thank you so much
for your kind words.

144
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,308
I'm just speaking
the truth.

145
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:16,280
Oh, forgive me,
a friend just walked in.

146
00:08:16,282 --> 00:08:18,232
Hi.
Hi.

147
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:19,734
Glad you could come.

148
00:08:19,736 --> 00:08:21,936
Sebastian invited me.

149
00:08:21,938 --> 00:08:25,239
Yes, I hear the two of you have
been spending a lot of time together.

150
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:27,942
We're just friends.

151
00:08:27,944 --> 00:08:29,944
Does he know that?

152
00:08:29,946 --> 00:08:31,512
Uh-oh.

153
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:33,497
What's
holding you back?

154
00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:36,751
Sometimes I feel like
I don't know the real Sebastian.

155
00:08:36,753 --> 00:08:39,887
He reminds me a little
of you that way.

156
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:42,740
Hmm.

157
00:08:42,742 --> 00:08:44,558
Freedom.

158
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,277
Liberty.

159
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,095
Justice.

160
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:52,900
Long have the people
of this city suffered

161
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:56,370
under the shackles
of a corrupt government...

162
00:08:56,372 --> 00:09:00,074
Slaves to self-interested
politicians

163
00:09:00,076 --> 00:09:04,245
and their lobbyist puppeteers.

164
00:09:05,864 --> 00:09:08,916
I declare war
on them all.

165
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:20,606
Anyone
in the building?

166
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,232
Cleaning crew
and a group of bankers

167
00:09:22,234 --> 00:09:23,567
working out a late night deal.

168
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:24,868
Can you patch me
into police and fire?

169
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,904
I'm on it.

170
00:09:32,377 --> 00:09:33,744
Diggle...

171
00:09:33,746 --> 00:09:37,080
Hey, man, this is not my thing.

172
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:39,583
It's too hot.
We're falling back.

173
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:41,585
You've still got
people on the 5th floor.

174
00:09:41,587 --> 00:09:43,774
It's too hot.
We're pulling back.

175
00:09:51,312 --> 00:09:53,996
Help!

176
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:55,464
Gary's still back there.

177
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:57,466
Get to safety.

178
00:10:06,943 --> 00:10:09,445
Give me your hand.

179
00:10:16,403 --> 00:10:19,188
Thank you.

180
00:10:35,138 --> 00:10:38,373
Hey.

181
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:41,343
You ok?

182
00:10:41,345 --> 00:10:44,647
Where you going?

183
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:47,600
To the plane,
to get geared up.

184
00:10:47,602 --> 00:10:49,185
For what?

185
00:10:49,187 --> 00:10:51,553
Ivo is still
out there.

186
00:10:51,555 --> 00:10:53,105
I'm going to find him,
and when I do,

187
00:10:53,107 --> 00:10:54,440
I'm going to cut
pieces of him.

188
00:10:54,442 --> 00:10:56,826
You can't. Ivo has a ship

189
00:10:56,828 --> 00:10:59,028
full of men, of killers.
And I don't care

190
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,113
what you did before,
you can't take them all out.

191
00:11:01,115 --> 00:11:04,583
Your only play here is to find
safe ground and wait him out.

192
00:11:04,585 --> 00:11:06,502
Well, of course
you would say that.

193
00:11:06,504 --> 00:11:08,087
You were working
for him.

194
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:09,905
You're probably
still working for him!

195
00:11:09,907 --> 00:11:12,241
Hey, hey!

196
00:11:12,243 --> 00:11:13,793
She's not.

197
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:15,544
Get out
of my way, kid.

198
00:11:15,546 --> 00:11:17,412
Look, let's just
take it easy--

199
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:20,850
I said...

200
00:11:20,852 --> 00:11:23,219
Get out of my way.

201
00:11:24,806 --> 00:11:26,989
You ok?
Long night.

202
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:29,525
Yeah. News report said the bomber
didn't steal any money.

203
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:32,427
I think this guy
just wants to make a statement.

204
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:34,363
That went online an hour ago.

205
00:11:34,365 --> 00:11:37,440
His manifesto. 300 pages
of anti-government hate.

206
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:38,631
You think this psycho's
any way connected to our

207
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,089
psycho in the skull mask?

208
00:11:41,155 --> 00:11:43,122
This guy has
a completely separate agenda.

209
00:11:43,124 --> 00:11:44,623
He's a lone wolf,
but we need

210
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,408
to find him before he finds
his next target.

211
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,744
I'd start with the bomb.
Everyone's unique.

212
00:11:48,746 --> 00:11:51,213
Maybe we can get some kind
of signature on the guy.

213
00:11:51,215 --> 00:11:53,115
But the bomb residue
is with the SCPD.

214
00:11:53,117 --> 00:11:53,875
Fortunately we have an in

215
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,603
with one of the officers
at the department.

216
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,921
I thought you were staying in
Central City for a few more days.

217
00:11:58,923 --> 00:12:00,673
I got a news alert
about the bombing.

218
00:12:00,675 --> 00:12:02,258
Caught the first train
out this morning.

219
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,625
Good.

220
00:12:03,627 --> 00:12:05,094
We need you here.

221
00:12:06,062 --> 00:12:08,514
How's Barry?

222
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:10,699
Ah, he's still sleeping.

223
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:13,169
I prefer sleeping to coma,

224
00:12:13,171 --> 00:12:17,022
'cause coma sounds,
you know, not fun.

225
00:12:18,692 --> 00:12:20,743
I'll reach out
to detective Lance.

226
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,944
Hey.

227
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:40,679
Did we have a lunch today?
No.

228
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:42,464
I was just
in the neighborhood.

229
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:44,967
Thought I'd stop by.
But if this is

230
00:12:44,969 --> 00:12:47,553
a bad time, I mean,
I can always come back.

231
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:51,607
Oh, no, not at all,
they're still setting up out there.

232
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:53,526
Wow.

233
00:12:53,528 --> 00:12:56,779
This is pretty impressive
for a street orphan.

234
00:12:56,781 --> 00:13:01,183
Are you suggesting I spread it
on a bit too thick last night?

235
00:13:01,185 --> 00:13:03,118
No.

236
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,137
It's just...

237
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:06,521
Laurel, if there's
something on your mind,

238
00:13:06,523 --> 00:13:08,690
give it voice.

239
00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:10,459
I don't bite.

240
00:13:10,461 --> 00:13:12,661
I promise.

241
00:13:12,663 --> 00:13:14,450
You know my father's
with the department.

242
00:13:14,475 --> 00:13:16,249
Yes.

243
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,667
He said the suspect
that he was investigating

244
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:20,502
when he and his partner
were attacked

245
00:13:20,504 --> 00:13:23,305
was a man
named Cyrus Gold.

246
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:30,012
Cyrus Gold...

247
00:13:30,014 --> 00:13:31,497
was a preacher

248
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:33,599
at the orphanage
where I was raised.

249
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:36,185
Cyrus was a very good
friend to me--

250
00:13:36,187 --> 00:13:37,653
like an older brother.

251
00:13:37,655 --> 00:13:40,589
Or even a father figure,
to be honest.

252
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:42,891
He was the first person
I said a word to,

253
00:13:42,893 --> 00:13:45,194
and this was after a month
of not speaking at all.

254
00:13:45,196 --> 00:13:48,080
You talk a lot about
being an orphan,

255
00:13:48,082 --> 00:13:51,450
but you don't talk
about your parents.

256
00:13:52,953 --> 00:13:55,371
Did you know them?

257
00:13:58,425 --> 00:14:01,443
My father was
a very unhappy man.

258
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:05,531
One night he came home
soaked in whiskey.

259
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:08,934
He lost his job again,
so he broke her arm.

260
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,855
I tried to stop him,
but he threw me off.

261
00:14:12,857 --> 00:14:14,627
And the next thing I saw
was my mother holding

262
00:14:14,652 --> 00:14:16,494
my father's gun in her hand.

263
00:14:18,261 --> 00:14:20,663
And I watched her shoot him.

264
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:24,149
She panicked.

265
00:14:24,151 --> 00:14:27,603
Ran and was gone before
the police even arrived.

266
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:32,408
It was the last time
I saw my parents.

267
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,227
I'm so sorry.

268
00:14:38,082 --> 00:14:40,049
I don't know...

269
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:42,351
Why Cyrus' life took
the turn that it did,

270
00:14:42,353 --> 00:14:45,054
I'm sad to say.

271
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:47,189
All I know...

272
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:49,508
is that he helped
a very young,

273
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,378
very frightened boy
find his voice again.

274
00:14:55,016 --> 00:14:58,183
Ahem. I'm sorry.

275
00:14:58,185 --> 00:15:00,903
More later?

276
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:36,472
Didn't hear you come in.

277
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:40,392
Yeah, sorry, I--
I got here early.

278
00:15:40,394 --> 00:15:43,278
I just want to get these crates
unpacked before lunch.

279
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,181
Are you ok?

280
00:15:46,183 --> 00:15:48,784
Yeah, I'm fine.

281
00:15:48,786 --> 00:15:51,487
Just...I haven't been
sleeping much lately.

282
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:53,188
I got a lot
on my mind.

283
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,773
You want to talk about it?

284
00:15:54,775 --> 00:15:56,792
Talk about what?

285
00:15:56,794 --> 00:16:00,079
Whatever's been going on
with you the last five weeks.

286
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:03,649
Look, I'm fine.

287
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:05,250
Ever since the Arrow
shot you,

288
00:16:05,252 --> 00:16:06,802
you've been acting
really weird, Roy.

289
00:16:06,804 --> 00:16:08,804
With me, with everything.

290
00:16:08,806 --> 00:16:11,840
This isn't
about the Arrow.

291
00:16:11,842 --> 00:16:14,259
Is it me?

292
00:16:14,261 --> 00:16:15,761
Is it us?

293
00:16:15,763 --> 00:16:19,181
Look, I really just want
to get through this, ok?

294
00:16:19,183 --> 00:16:20,816
Ok.

295
00:16:20,818 --> 00:16:24,853
Let me know if there's
anything I can do to help.

296
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:27,823
Thea.

297
00:16:31,778 --> 00:16:33,695
You do help.

298
00:16:33,697 --> 00:16:35,831
Every day.

299
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,367
And honestly, right now
you're the only thing

300
00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:40,235
that's keeping me
together.

301
00:16:40,237 --> 00:16:42,788
I do what I can.

302
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,124
How did I get
to be so lucky?

303
00:16:45,126 --> 00:16:48,544
You...stole my purse.

304
00:16:48,546 --> 00:16:50,679
Hmm.

305
00:17:08,764 --> 00:17:09,731
Roy?!

306
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:12,868
Thea, are you ok?
Yeah.

307
00:17:13,987 --> 00:17:15,937
Oh, your arm...

308
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:23,996
Um, that looks really deep.

309
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:26,448
It might need stitches.
Um, I'm going to go downstairs

310
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,183
and get the first aid kit, ok?

311
00:17:28,185 --> 00:17:30,335
Ok.

312
00:17:53,476 --> 00:17:55,077
U know, most cops,

313
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,879
they meet their informants
in the backseat of a cruiser

314
00:17:56,881 --> 00:17:59,481
or maybe a coffee shop
or something, but...

315
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:01,366
What's with the mask?

316
00:18:01,368 --> 00:18:03,535
Gift from a friend.
You got friends?

317
00:18:03,537 --> 00:18:05,987
Did you bring me
what I asked for?

318
00:18:09,158 --> 00:18:13,362
That's a sample of everything
the CSU collected from the blast.

319
00:18:13,364 --> 00:18:15,664
There's melted glass,
multiple explosive fragments,

320
00:18:15,666 --> 00:18:18,217
and trace residue,
and it looks like nitroglycerine.

321
00:18:18,219 --> 00:18:20,302
Which means that we're dealing with
more than just a basement nutjob.

322
00:18:20,304 --> 00:18:22,888
Someone with training.

323
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,841
Thank you,
Detective.

324
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:29,061
I need a favor, too.

325
00:18:32,365 --> 00:18:34,283
The son of a bitch
who killed my men, my partner...

326
00:18:34,285 --> 00:18:36,068
He's dead.

327
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,570
And whoever tipped him off,
told him we were coming,

328
00:18:38,572 --> 00:18:39,955
he's doing just fine.

329
00:18:39,957 --> 00:18:42,241
What do you need?

330
00:18:42,243 --> 00:18:44,626
Cell phone records
for every cop in my precinct.

331
00:18:44,628 --> 00:18:46,378
You think there's a leak
in the department?

332
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,663
I think those phone records
are the only way

333
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:48,997
to know for sure,
and your blonde friend,

334
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:50,299
she's pretty good
with computers.

335
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:52,784
I'll ask her--

336
00:18:55,838 --> 00:19:00,509
DC-52 to Central,
10-80, downtown!

337
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:01,843
He's hit again.

338
00:19:01,845 --> 00:19:03,979
Starling City
municipal building.

339
00:19:03,981 --> 00:19:05,597
Give me a location.
I'll give you one better--

340
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,933
I'm checking
the surrounding cell towers.

341
00:19:07,935 --> 00:19:09,601
There was a GSM spike

342
00:19:09,603 --> 00:19:11,904
of 3,800 megahertz
two seconds before the blast.

343
00:19:11,906 --> 00:19:13,822
That frequency's way outside
the approved frequency

344
00:19:13,824 --> 00:19:15,874
for U.S. carriers.

345
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:21,663
Signal's moving.
I think he's mobile.

346
00:19:21,665 --> 00:19:22,781
Give me an intersection.

347
00:19:26,704 --> 00:19:29,037
Right in front
of you, 400 meters.

348
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,472
I see him.

349
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:44,419
Turn left on 67th.

350
00:20:25,478 --> 00:20:28,063
Felicity,
I've lost him.

351
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:29,264
What?

352
00:20:29,266 --> 00:20:31,833
Me, too, hold on.

353
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:34,319
Got him. Bank left
on Gerrard Street.

354
00:20:34,321 --> 00:20:36,521
You're almost
right on top of him.

355
00:20:48,751 --> 00:20:51,470
It's not him, Felicity.
You picked up the wrong signal.

356
00:20:51,472 --> 00:20:54,623
What? I thought--
he must have scrambled the signal.

357
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,042
It doesn't matter.

358
00:20:57,044 --> 00:20:59,411
He's gone.

359
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:06,864
What happened?

360
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:10,334
He's using cellular technology
to detonate his bombs.

361
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:13,004
Clearly, his expertise extends
to obscuring that signal.

362
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:15,790
Felicity, your expertise
was supposed to trump his.

363
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:18,009
Excuse me?

364
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:21,262
If you have something
to say to me, Oliver, say it.

365
00:21:21,264 --> 00:21:23,714
People are dying. So I would like you
to pull your head

366
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:25,633
out of Central City
and get back in the game.

367
00:21:25,635 --> 00:21:27,718
Sure, right after you get
yours out of your ass.

368
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,737
Excuse me?
All right.

369
00:21:29,739 --> 00:21:31,606
Maybe we should
just take a breath here.

370
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:33,157
No, wait, I want to know,
what exactly was that crack

371
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,692
about Central City
meant to imply?

372
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:37,245
When the first bomb went
off, you weren't here.

373
00:21:37,247 --> 00:21:40,031
And when the second bomb
went off, you sent me the wrong way.

374
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:41,699
After you didn't catch him
in the first place!

375
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:44,752
Don't blame me because
you didn't have it tonight.

376
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:47,471
I need some air.

377
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:56,831
At the risk of me getting
my head knocked off...

378
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:59,283
Playing the blame game's
not going to help us

379
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,718
catch this son of a bitch.

380
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,920
Neither is doing
things halfway.

381
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,589
Is that what you think's
going on here, Oliver?

382
00:22:04,591 --> 00:22:06,007
You think
she was distracted?

383
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:07,458
She wasn't giving it her all?

384
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,694
She almost ran me
into a bus, Diggle.

385
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:11,178
What do you think?

386
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,930
I think you didn't
have a problem

387
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,683
with Felicity's performance
until she met Barry Allen.

388
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:47,431
I'm sorry.

389
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,106
You're not
well, Slade.

390
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:58,042
Hey...

391
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,677
It's the Mirakuru.

392
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,013
It's messing
with your head.

393
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:09,820
It's going to be dark soon.
We should make camp.

394
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,131
What's going on?
You ok?

395
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:22,917
Yeah, it's just,
arm still hurts when it's cold

396
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:25,636
and I lost the pain meds
that the doctor gave me.

397
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:27,088
How's yours healing up?

398
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,173
Ah, you know,
good days and bad.

399
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:32,009
I'll see you later.

400
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:34,312
Hey.

401
00:23:34,314 --> 00:23:35,680
Pretty crazy.

402
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:37,315
Yeah. You doing all right?

403
00:23:37,317 --> 00:23:39,567
I thought I could use your help,
if you have a second.

404
00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:41,319
You being
at the DA's office now,

405
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:43,721
it's almost like you joined
the family business. Come on.

406
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,058
I'm trying to find someone

407
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,995
named "Maya Resik."
I searched the Internet,

408
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:54,448
the DMV records,
social security...Nothing.

409
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,033
Why are you looking
for a ghost?

410
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:57,752
Sebastian's paying her bills.

411
00:23:57,754 --> 00:23:59,203
A woman who doesn't
seem to exist;

412
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,671
I find that suspicious.

413
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:02,423
Thinking that
your boyfriend's up to no good,

414
00:24:02,425 --> 00:24:04,508
that's typically
more my thing than yours.

415
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,210
Oh, he's not exactly
my boyfriend.

416
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:07,511
Well, that makes
digging into his life

417
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,847
a little less fun, then.

418
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:11,549
Hey, Laurel.

419
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:13,718
If I bring you
something back,

420
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,386
you know I'm going
to want to know why.

421
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:17,204
Of course you are.

422
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,276
Over the last few days,
our resolve has been tested.

423
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:26,897
But all of you continue to prove
that the only way we keep on...

424
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:30,301
Ah, you're just in time
to see the show.

425
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:31,902
What's he doing?

426
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,537
Bringing the city together.

427
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:36,540
And if I'm not mistaken,
campaigning.

428
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:41,278
Tomorrow night, I am holding Starling's
first ever unity rally at City Plaza.

429
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,849
We are going to show the world
that the people of this great city

430
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:47,485
will not back down
to terrorists.

431
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,253
He's committing suicide
and he just invited

432
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:50,504
the entire city
to join him.

433
00:24:50,506 --> 00:24:51,872
Sebastian's
your friend.

434
00:24:51,874 --> 00:24:54,592
Can't you talk him
out of this, Oliver?

435
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:55,693
Well, that day is now.

436
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:58,429
Well, he won't
listen to me.

437
00:25:04,553 --> 00:25:08,122
Sebastian Blood...

438
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:12,126
This rally tomorrow night,

439
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:14,895
you need to call it off.

440
00:25:14,897 --> 00:25:18,916
The Starling City vigilante paying
a visit to wave me off.

441
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:20,918
I'm flattered.

442
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,254
This event, Mr. Blood,

443
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:26,924
you might as well be painting
a giant bulls eye on your chest.

444
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:33,547
This city needs
to come together.

445
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:35,683
And I need
to show them how.

446
00:25:35,685 --> 00:25:39,270
You won't be able to show them
anything if you're dead.

447
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:42,606
Every night,
you risk your life

448
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:45,109
for the people
of this city.

449
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:47,111
How can you expect
me to do any less?

450
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:51,098
And what about the lives of
the people coming to your rally?

451
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,017
This rally is about
Starling City

452
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:54,752
standing up and declaring
with one voice

453
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:56,187
that living afraid
isn't living.

454
00:25:56,189 --> 00:25:58,188
I won't send a contrary
message to people

455
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,791
telling them to stay home,
to stay scared.

456
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:05,613
I've made my decision.

457
00:26:05,615 --> 00:26:07,631
That's the thing, alderman...

458
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:11,218
whatever happens
tomorrow night,

459
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,305
it's not up to you.

460
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,986
♪ I wake up
and she's not there ♪

461
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:31,438
Ah, Mrs. Fazekas.

462
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,241
The train set
for your nephew

463
00:26:34,243 --> 00:26:37,495
just came in.
He's going to love it.

464
00:26:37,497 --> 00:26:40,781
Oh. You are a miracle worker,
Mr. Scheffer.

465
00:26:40,783 --> 00:26:42,199
How much do I owe you?

466
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,535
$50 even.

467
00:26:44,537 --> 00:26:46,587
Forget
the sales tax.

468
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:49,456
Going to the alderman's
unity rally tomorrow night?

469
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:51,675
I wouldn't
miss it.

470
00:26:57,114 --> 00:26:59,167
Gathered here despite
the rash of bombings

471
00:26:59,168 --> 00:27:00,885
that have plagued the city,

472
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:02,436
some have called
Sebastian Blood's unity rally

473
00:27:02,438 --> 00:27:04,171
a cynical
and dangerous PR stunt

474
00:27:04,173 --> 00:27:05,556
for his mayoral
campaign.

475
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,074
But the crowd
continues to grow.

476
00:27:08,076 --> 00:27:10,543
Tried to get him
to stand down.

477
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,013
He seems as stubborn as you
when it comes to fighting back.

478
00:27:13,015 --> 00:27:14,481
Or everything.
Hey, is this how

479
00:27:14,483 --> 00:27:15,815
it's going to be
with you two from now on?

480
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:17,550
Maybe we should just
head down to the rally.

481
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,019
Maybe we won't have to.

482
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:21,771
I analyzed the bomb
remnants we got from Lance.

483
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:23,490
The design's identical
to the bombs used by

484
00:27:23,492 --> 00:27:26,443
an anti government
militia group called the Movement.

485
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:30,246
Lucky for us, they have a very active
and hackable message board.

486
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,983
One of their most prolific fans has
an IP address right here in Starling.

487
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,035
Tell me.
The computer's in a local souvenir shop.

488
00:27:35,037 --> 00:27:38,004
The whackadoo in question goes by
the username Shrapnel.

489
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:39,039
You want back-up?

490
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:40,490
No, I need you
at the rally.

491
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,925
Cover our bases.

492
00:27:48,032 --> 00:27:49,749
Is this all for me?

493
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,935
No, for me.
SCPD phone records.

494
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:54,104
Why are you going through
the department's phone records?

495
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:58,224
Um, so I checked up
on your not exactly boyfriend.

496
00:27:58,226 --> 00:28:00,393
And? Did you find anything?

497
00:28:00,395 --> 00:28:02,145
Yeah, it turns out
he's a hell of a guy.

498
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:05,732
Covers the expenses
of his dear aunt...

499
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,433
your Maya Resik.

500
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,235
If Sebastian has other family,

501
00:28:09,237 --> 00:28:11,955
then why was he placed
in an orphanage?

502
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:15,792
Well, maybe 'cause Aunt Maya
is nuttier than a Snickers bar.

503
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,161
She's a patient
at St. Walker's Hospital.

504
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,046
It's a mental institution,
it's the kind you don't check out of.

505
00:28:20,048 --> 00:28:22,332
Now, listen, you going to tell me
what this is all about?

506
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:25,702
Something about him
just seems off.

507
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,420
Laurel, there is
nothing sinister

508
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:29,389
about a guy
who is covering the expenses

509
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:31,307
of his only
living relative.

510
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:32,759
The truth is,
it's kind of nice.

511
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:35,562
Listen, I gotta get
to City Plaza.

512
00:28:35,564 --> 00:28:37,263
Pike wants all hands
at this unity rally.

513
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:38,798
You're not going,
right?

514
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,433
No, I need to look
into this more.

515
00:28:40,435 --> 00:28:45,572
Laurel, he seems
like a good guy

516
00:28:45,574 --> 00:28:46,656
and you
deserve good.

517
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:47,957
Ok, so stop
looking for reasons

518
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,859
to talk yourself
out of it.

519
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:53,196
Please.

520
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:57,283
Alderman Blood,
is this not dangerous?

521
00:28:57,285 --> 00:28:58,918
I'm afraid so.

522
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,453
Why are you gathering all these
people here to be targets?

523
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:02,789
Please, I'll get to all
of your questions later.

524
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,282
Boom.

525
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:31,050
You're dead.

526
00:29:31,052 --> 00:29:34,537
Or will be if you
take one more step

527
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,239
or move
a single muscle.

528
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,091
And then you'll miss
the show.

529
00:29:38,093 --> 00:29:40,493
Candidate Blood's
unity rally.

530
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:43,930
Already rigged with 50 pounds of
RDX high explosives.

531
00:29:43,932 --> 00:29:46,783
Not unlike what's packed inside the
drywall of my store.

532
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,719
This city thinks Sebastian Blood
can keep them safe.

533
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,271
Tonight, they learn that the only
thing politicians

534
00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:54,090
care about protecting
is their jobs.

535
00:30:11,137 --> 00:30:12,587
Felicity.
Here.

536
00:30:12,589 --> 00:30:13,605
Did you get him?

537
00:30:13,607 --> 00:30:16,107
No. He said he
rigged the Plaza

538
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:17,609
with an explosive device.

539
00:30:17,611 --> 00:30:18,576
Oliver,
it's crazy-town there.

540
00:30:18,578 --> 00:30:19,761
That bomb could be
anywhere.

541
00:30:19,763 --> 00:30:22,447
I can narrow that down.
Get me Diggle.

542
00:30:22,449 --> 00:30:23,865
Go.

543
00:30:23,867 --> 00:30:27,318
Shrapnel said he ringed
the perimeter with rdx.

544
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,204
I'm on it.

545
00:30:29,206 --> 00:30:30,572
You're heading to
the Plaza, too, right?

546
00:30:30,574 --> 00:30:32,123
Not yet.

547
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:34,342
I need you to pull me up
anything you can on the store.

548
00:30:34,344 --> 00:30:37,462
Blue prints, permit
schematics, anything.

549
00:30:37,464 --> 00:30:38,513
What's going on?

550
00:30:38,515 --> 00:30:40,265
Shrapnel left behind
a surprise.

551
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:42,383
Said he packed the drywall
with explosives,

552
00:30:42,385 --> 00:30:44,269
but the trigger
needs to be--

553
00:30:44,271 --> 00:30:45,987
Would need to be hooked up to
some sort of power supply.

554
00:30:45,989 --> 00:30:47,772
That's assuming that
the detonator's connected

555
00:30:47,774 --> 00:30:49,774
to the store's electricity and not
something independent

556
00:30:49,776 --> 00:30:53,645
like a car battery.
I know, not helpful.

557
00:30:53,647 --> 00:30:54,896
You sure you want me
doing this?

558
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:56,631
My head might not
exactly be in the game.

559
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:57,865
Felicity!

560
00:30:57,867 --> 00:30:59,067
The building was built
in the seventies.

561
00:30:59,069 --> 00:31:00,735
That's good news.

562
00:31:00,737 --> 00:31:03,187
The wiring in a lot
of construction back then is defective.

563
00:31:03,189 --> 00:31:05,156
So if you sever
one wire,

564
00:31:05,158 --> 00:31:06,441
it will blow fuses in
the entire building

565
00:31:06,443 --> 00:31:07,675
and shot off power
to the bomb.

566
00:31:07,677 --> 00:31:10,061
Hold tight.
I see a fuse box.

567
00:31:10,063 --> 00:31:11,229
Oliver, be careful.

568
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:24,542
Oliver?

569
00:31:26,062 --> 00:31:28,580
Oliver?

570
00:31:30,683 --> 00:31:33,768
It's all right.
I'm all right.

571
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,353
Get to the rally.

572
00:31:35,355 --> 00:31:38,523
Help Diggle.
I'm on my way.

573
00:31:52,254 --> 00:31:56,457
Thea, I really don't think coming
here was a good idea.

574
00:31:56,459 --> 00:31:57,642
It's gonna be fine.

575
00:31:57,644 --> 00:31:59,076
Let's just go find Roy.

576
00:32:03,116 --> 00:32:05,049
Please, please.

577
00:32:05,051 --> 00:32:07,585
You're the ones who
deserve an ovation.

578
00:32:07,587 --> 00:32:12,256
8 months ago this city
survived a devastating attack...

579
00:32:13,425 --> 00:32:15,393
But we rose up.

580
00:32:15,395 --> 00:32:18,696
You rose up

581
00:32:18,698 --> 00:32:21,599
and banded together,
just like we are tonight.

582
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:23,318
Dig, I'm on site.

583
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,903
I'm on the east side.
Think I found the trigger.

584
00:32:25,905 --> 00:32:26,954
And prove to the world

585
00:32:26,956 --> 00:32:29,090
that we cannot be broken.

586
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,060
That the people
of this city

587
00:32:32,062 --> 00:32:33,594
are too strong.

588
00:32:33,596 --> 00:32:36,381
And that no bomb
and no earthquake

589
00:32:36,383 --> 00:32:39,467
is strong enough
to tear us apart.

590
00:32:39,469 --> 00:32:40,685
Oliver said that
the whole place

591
00:32:40,687 --> 00:32:41,986
was ringed
with explosives.

592
00:32:41,988 --> 00:32:43,755
It's in the sound
equipment.

593
00:32:43,757 --> 00:32:45,173
And this is
the trigger.

594
00:32:45,175 --> 00:32:47,475
Shrapnel activates it
by cellular transmission.

595
00:32:47,477 --> 00:32:50,178
Listen, we don't
have to disarm it, just disable it.

596
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,013
I can do that.

597
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:53,981
I think.

598
00:32:53,983 --> 00:32:55,350
I hope.

599
00:32:55,352 --> 00:32:56,484
Listen,
you be careful.

600
00:32:56,486 --> 00:32:57,635
He probably put in
a safeguard.

601
00:32:57,637 --> 00:32:58,720
Tampering with it

602
00:32:58,722 --> 00:32:59,904
will set off a
deadman's switch.

603
00:32:59,906 --> 00:33:01,739
That's a really
depressing term.

604
00:33:01,741 --> 00:33:04,359
And a little bit sexist.

605
00:33:05,477 --> 00:33:07,445
Step away.

606
00:33:07,447 --> 00:33:09,614
Or we all know
how this ends.

607
00:33:09,616 --> 00:33:11,699
Dig!

608
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:50,488
Mom!

609
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:53,458
I'm ok.
I'm ok.

610
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:19,767
Drop the bow.

611
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:23,855
I've got charges
planted all over Starling.

612
00:34:23,857 --> 00:34:28,192
I drop this stick,
they all blow.

613
00:34:29,895 --> 00:34:31,662
Did you just hear
what I said?

614
00:34:31,664 --> 00:34:33,247
Yep.

615
00:34:49,742 --> 00:34:51,209
Hey.

616
00:34:51,211 --> 00:34:52,544
How's your mom?

617
00:34:52,546 --> 00:34:54,713
She's fine.
Just a little shooken up.

618
00:34:55,931 --> 00:34:57,682
You saved her.

619
00:34:57,684 --> 00:34:58,883
I got lucky.

620
00:34:58,885 --> 00:34:59,901
That wasn't luck.

621
00:34:59,903 --> 00:35:02,187
That was impossible.

622
00:35:02,189 --> 00:35:04,739
You know those stories
of mom's lifting cars to save their kids?

623
00:35:04,741 --> 00:35:06,524
Things you can do
when adrenaline hits.

624
00:35:06,526 --> 00:35:08,426
It was...
It was one of those.

625
00:35:09,695 --> 00:35:12,597
Your arm.

626
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:15,066
There's not even
a mark.

627
00:35:15,068 --> 00:35:16,868
It's...I heal fast.

628
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,770
It's fine.
Right.

629
00:35:18,772 --> 00:35:21,406
I'm kind of tired.
It's been a long night, you know.

630
00:35:21,408 --> 00:35:23,408
I gotta go.

631
00:35:24,427 --> 00:35:26,211
Roy.

632
00:35:32,635 --> 00:35:34,085
With you dropping
fewer bodies,

633
00:35:34,087 --> 00:35:36,671
Starling City should probably
build a bigger jail.

634
00:35:36,673 --> 00:35:39,541
Another night of
skull mask hunting?

635
00:35:39,543 --> 00:35:41,559
Not exactly.

636
00:35:41,561 --> 00:35:42,844
How's your shoulder?

637
00:35:42,846 --> 00:35:44,095
Oh, just a
through-and-through.

638
00:35:44,097 --> 00:35:45,764
Walk in the park.

639
00:35:45,766 --> 00:35:50,235
Still, Diggle, you should
go home and get some rest.

640
00:36:04,333 --> 00:36:06,935
I'm sorry.

641
00:36:08,838 --> 00:36:11,639
Are you apologizing to me

642
00:36:11,641 --> 00:36:14,909
or were you talking
to your quiver?

643
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:17,161
I didn't snap at my quiver.

644
00:36:17,163 --> 00:36:19,681
You kind of
more than snapped

645
00:36:19,683 --> 00:36:21,266
I know.

646
00:36:21,268 --> 00:36:23,284
And I'm sorry.

647
00:36:25,855 --> 00:36:30,809
I understand that this Mirakuru
thing has you freaked

648
00:36:32,845 --> 00:36:36,081
and I have been
in Central City a lot.

649
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:38,700
Felicity,
it's not that.

650
00:36:40,553 --> 00:36:42,103
When you are there,

651
00:36:42,105 --> 00:36:47,542
well, it just made me realize
how much I need you here.

652
00:36:49,194 --> 00:36:51,329
In the beg...beginning,

653
00:36:51,331 --> 00:36:56,301
I was just gonna--
I was gonna do all of this by myself.

654
00:36:59,171 --> 00:37:01,873
And now with you and Diggle...

655
00:37:05,111 --> 00:37:07,846
I rely on you.

656
00:37:11,934 --> 00:37:15,570
Does that mean
I have a shot

657
00:37:15,572 --> 00:37:17,856
at employee
of the month?

658
00:37:17,858 --> 00:37:19,324
No.

659
00:37:19,326 --> 00:37:21,743
Because you're not
my employee.

660
00:37:21,745 --> 00:37:24,696
You're my partner.

661
00:37:30,936 --> 00:37:34,255
Barry's gonna wake up.

662
00:37:34,257 --> 00:37:36,324
And when he does,
you will be there.

663
00:37:36,326 --> 00:37:38,193
I finally have a guy who's
interested in me

664
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:41,546
and he's struck
by lightning,

665
00:37:41,548 --> 00:37:43,631
ends up in a coma.

666
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:44,749
Typical.

667
00:37:47,053 --> 00:37:49,604
Well, maybe he's
dreaming about you.

668
00:37:49,606 --> 00:37:53,141
You know, actually there's
conflicting cases

669
00:37:53,143 --> 00:37:56,444
about whether coma
patients can in fact dream normally

670
00:37:56,446 --> 00:38:00,565
or they're more like
hallucinating.

671
00:38:04,103 --> 00:38:06,270
Thank you.

672
00:38:13,212 --> 00:38:15,279
Sara.

673
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:20,301
Sara, I know you're listening.
Answer me.

674
00:38:21,253 --> 00:38:22,804
This is very simple,
Sara.

675
00:38:22,806 --> 00:38:25,757
I know you and your new friends
have the Mirakuru.

676
00:38:25,759 --> 00:38:30,478
You know I will lay
waste to this entire island to get it.

677
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,729
Get Slade.

678
00:38:31,731 --> 00:38:32,797
But it doesn't have to
be that way.

679
00:38:32,799 --> 00:38:34,766
All I want
is the serum.

680
00:38:34,768 --> 00:38:36,801
In exchange, I'll promise you
and your friends

681
00:38:36,803 --> 00:38:39,136
safe passage
off this island, I promise.

682
00:38:39,138 --> 00:38:42,240
Within 10 days,
you and your new friends

683
00:38:42,242 --> 00:38:44,475
could be making port
in Shanghai.

684
00:38:44,477 --> 00:38:46,694
The alternative is
I send my men

685
00:38:46,696 --> 00:38:49,247
into the jungle to take
the serum from you.

686
00:38:49,249 --> 00:38:50,865
They'll be under orders
not to kill any of you.

687
00:38:50,867 --> 00:38:52,750
Instead, you'll remain
alive enough

688
00:38:52,752 --> 00:38:58,706
for me to indulge
my scientific curiosity.

689
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:01,793
Think about it, Sara.

690
00:39:06,164 --> 00:39:10,184
He's gone.
What?

691
00:39:10,186 --> 00:39:12,971
Slade's gone and he took the
Mirakuru with him.

692
00:39:17,693 --> 00:39:19,861
You can ask all
the questions you want,

693
00:39:19,863 --> 00:39:24,482
but I wouldn't count on
getting anything back.

694
00:39:24,484 --> 00:39:26,124
She probably won't even
know you're there.

695
00:39:30,123 --> 00:39:33,107
I'll be down the hall
if you need anything.

696
00:39:44,136 --> 00:39:45,870
Maya?

697
00:39:45,872 --> 00:39:48,539
I'm here to talk
about your nephew.

698
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:52,043
Un buen Chico.

699
00:39:52,045 --> 00:39:56,764
Maya, my name's
Laurel Lance.

700
00:39:56,766 --> 00:39:57,982
Maya?

701
00:39:57,984 --> 00:40:00,385
I'm here to talk
about your nephew.

702
00:40:00,387 --> 00:40:04,522
Un buen Chico,

703
00:40:04,524 --> 00:40:08,076
un Chico listo,

704
00:40:08,078 --> 00:40:11,663
un Chico hermoso.

705
00:40:11,665 --> 00:40:16,567
Maya?
Maya, que Chico?

706
00:40:16,569 --> 00:40:18,569
Que Chico? Sebastian?

707
00:40:19,404 --> 00:40:21,556
Sebastian.

708
00:40:21,558 --> 00:40:25,093
Yes, yes.
Sebastian Blood.

709
00:40:25,095 --> 00:40:27,378
There will always be
those who seek to harm us,

710
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,963
but it will not
weaken us.

711
00:40:28,965 --> 00:40:30,531
It will only make us
stronger.

712
00:40:32,434 --> 00:40:33,685
Well done, alderman.

713
00:40:33,687 --> 00:40:36,404
Thanks to you.

714
00:40:36,406 --> 00:40:39,123
Still a very big risk
to take.

715
00:40:41,945 --> 00:40:45,113
Tonight we both
stood up for Starling City.

716
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:51,435
You and me, we can
save this city,

717
00:40:51,437 --> 00:40:53,988
if we work together.

718
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:57,692
Maya, can you talk to me
about Sebastian?

719
00:40:57,694 --> 00:41:02,413
It's ok.
You can trust me.

720
00:41:02,415 --> 00:41:04,782
Ok?

721
00:41:04,784 --> 00:41:07,435
Sebastian is my friend.

722
00:41:07,437 --> 00:41:10,121
Sebastian is the devil.

723
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:14,008
He the one
who put me here.

724
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:17,061
He made everybody
think I'm insane.

725
00:41:17,063 --> 00:41:19,897
But why would he do that?

726
00:41:22,885 --> 00:41:26,270
He killed his father.

727
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:29,624
And I was there.

728
00:41:29,626 --> 00:41:32,460
I saw it.

729
00:41:36,449 --> 00:41:40,668
Oh, my God.

730
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:45,957
Sebastian isn't your nephew,

731
00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:48,176
he's your son.

732
00:41:51,764 --> 00:41:55,633
Don't trust a word
he says.

733
00:41:57,803 --> 00:42:02,356
You can't trust
Sebastian Blood.
