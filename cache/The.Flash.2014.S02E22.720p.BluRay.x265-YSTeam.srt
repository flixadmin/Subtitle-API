00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,312
Wally.

161
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,855
You are worth it.

162
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:05,400
Really? Am I?

163
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,445
'Cause last time I checked,

164
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:11,110
I'm the guy
who avoided his dying mother for weeks.

165
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,741
I'm the guy who shamed
a bunch of other guys

166
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,030
and illegally took their cars from them.

167
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,495
I'm the guy who caused The Flash
to lose his powers

168
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,037
and start this whole damn Metapocalypse
in the first place.

169
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,831
- Wally...
- Last time I checked,

170
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,707
I have a whole lot to make up for.

171
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,091
That's what I intend to do.

172
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,595
Damn it.

173
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,899
- HARRISON: Snow.
- Oh.

174
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,318
- I didn't know you were here.
- What are you doing?

175
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:54,953
Jesse asked me to run some tests to see
if her genetic structure had changed.

176
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:01,336
Why did you ask Dr. Snow
to run tests on you again?

177
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,495
Because I got hit
with the dark matter, okay?

178
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,414
I mean,
that must have affected me somehow.

179

(WHISPERS) You're not a meta-human.

180

(NORMAL VOICE) What you are
is a young woman with genius-level IQ

181
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:27,111
that we could use in our fight
against this new wave of meta-humans.

182
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,611
Okay. All right, fine.

183
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:33,154
Fine.

186
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:43,952
You all right?

187
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,251
Yeah, fine.

188
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,552
- Is this it?
- DR. MCGEE: That's the one.

189
00:11:58,717 --> 00:11:59,719
All right, great.

190
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,014
Dad, Dr. McGee, Cisco,
why don't you guys crack this open,

191
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,181
- see what you can find?
- Sure.

192
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,147
We'll go see what kind of meta-human
powers can take down a building like that,

193
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,811
- and how to stop it.
- Great.

194
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:08,977
Sounds like fun.

195
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:11,773
All right, I'm gonna go see
if Joe needs any help in the streets.

196
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,158
Everybody cool here?
Should be a piece of cake, right?

197
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,826
HENRY: Hey, slugger.

198
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,081
- Hey.
- Can I talk to you for a minute?

199
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,664
Yeah, sure. What's up?

200
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,667
Well, I know you said

201
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:29,298
that what happened to you
in the Speed Force

202
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:31,551
changed the way you see things.

203
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,673
- Yeah.
- But you seem very optimistic,

204
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,634
you know, with a lot of meta-humans
running around, tearing up the city.

205
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,971
What, did you see the future in there?

206
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:40,768
(CHUCKLES) Um...

207
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,304
Not this time. No, I... Look,

208
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:48,601
what I was shown in the Speed Force,
it didn'tjust change my mind,

209
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,269
it changed me.

210
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:54,649
I don't know, I mean,
what you're seeing as optimism is...

211
00:12:54,856 --> 00:12:59,202
For the first time,
I'm just not afraid anymore.

212
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,115
Great. That's...

213
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,293
But you know
you still have to be careful, right?

214
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,259
- What do you mean?
- Well...

215
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,383
I don't... Why are you trying

216
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,345
to take something from me
that I've fought so hard to get to?

217
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:20,599
Barry.

218
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,976
(STUTTERS) You don't know everything
that I've been through, Dad.

219
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,432
You haven't been here long enough to know.

220
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,017
I didn't mean...
I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that.

221
00:13:29,182 --> 00:13:30,684
I think I do.

222
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,067
I haven't been around.

223
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,323
To teach you how to drive
or take you to look at colleges,

224
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:40,236
but I've done everything in my power
to know who you are.

225
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:44,077
Barry, I don't want to take anything
from you, I believe in you.

226
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,543
This isn't about my not believing in you.

227
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:50,080
I know that. And I'm fine, okay?

228
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,798
Thank you.
Thank you very much for worrying about me.

229
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:55,084
I love you,

230
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,216
but I'm fine.

(ALARM BEEPING)

232
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,014
Come on.

233
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,561
What is that?

It's C.C.P.D.

236
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,447
Barry, don't do it.

237
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,951
JAY: You know I never saw the crime photos
of my mother's murder.

238
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,250
Although I guess I didn't need to.

239
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,540
I had a ringside seat
while you got whisked away.

240
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,090
Too delicate, I suppose.

241
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:44,011
Notjust a hologram after all,
are you, Flash?

242
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,688
Interesting.

243
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,231
I know you didn't call me up here
just to banter.

244
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,648
Let's finish this right now.

245
00:14:58,438 --> 00:14:59,565
Actually, I did.

246
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,741
I called you up here to tell you

247
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,575
you can't keep running
from one meta to the next.

248
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,707
Around and around,
like a dog chasing its tail.

249
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,581
I'll do whatever it takes to stop you.

250
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,837
JAY: If only that were good enough.

251
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,250
'Cause here's the thing. I know you.

252
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,673
I know you,
I know what's holding you back.

253
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,514
You and me,

254
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,018
we're reallyjust the same person.

255
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,519
Yeah, you keep saying that,
but it's not gonna make it true.

256
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,813
You'll see. We are.

257
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,566
Same tragic background,
same reason for running,

258
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,783
same desire to be the fastest,
to be the best.

259
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,989
The difference?
You think your anger is dirty somehow.

260
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,533
You want to be seen as pure, the hero.

261
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,371
Doesn't it get exhausting?

262
00:15:53,326 --> 00:15:54,794
Doesn't it get exhausting, Barry?

263
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:57,173
It was exhausting playing Jay, believe me.

264
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,048
I'm not pretending.

Now, if it were me,

267
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,265
I'd let that building tumble
without a second thought. But you?

268
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,018
You'll never let that happen, will you?

269
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,812
That's why I'm gonna beat you, Barry.

270
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,807
Because you always have to be the hero.

271
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,610
And while you're playing
the good little boy,

272

BARRY: We can't let Zoom
destroy another building.

274
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,755
We need to take him down. Now.

275
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:42,379
And how do you propose we do that

276
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,216
with an army of meta-humans
laying waste to Central City?

277
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,599
We couldn't stop Zoom on my Earth.
What makes us different?

278
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,096
We're a team.

279
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:53,015
We start with the meta-humans,
they're his armor.

280
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,398
We take them down first,
then Zoom's more vulnerable.

281
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,933
Barry, we don't know even know
how many of his minions there are.

282
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,942
There could be hundreds, a thousand.

283
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:02,446
And all of them,
they're all working with different powers.

284
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:03,822
It could take weeks to track 'em all down.

285
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,357
Guys, we don't have weeks.

286
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,869
So what we need to do is come up
with a way to stop them all at once.

287
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,451

Your goggles, your camera,
they didn't work on Earth-2, right?

290
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,039
Yeah, it was all a different frequency.

291
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,798
And the way you took down
the Time Wraiths?

292
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,130
That was based on frequency.

I think I'm smelling
what you're stepping in.

295
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,507
- Yeah.
- So, basically,

296
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:33,348
we create some vibrational tech
that could take down the Earth-2 metas.

297
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,932
- Basically.
- I like it.

298
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,472
- Me, too.
- I'll help.

Okay.

ifl hear anything from CCPN.

- Is he okay?
- Not really.

Earlier, he thought
it would be a good idea

if he used himself as bait
against a meta-human psycho.

that he wasn't gonna waste
the opportunity The Flash gave him.

317
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:58,057
I don't know if you can stop him.

318
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,268
I'm gonna have to
or he's gonna get himself killed.

319
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,230
Look, he ain't you, Barry.
He can'tjust go Mach 50...

320
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,069
(CHUCKLES) Mach 50 isn't a real thing.

321
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,857
Point is, thinking you're invincible
isn't any kind of armor.

322
00:19:10,982 --> 00:19:14,202
Now, Wally's already at a higher risk
than I'm comfortable with,

323
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:17,582
and him throwing caution to the wind
on top of all of that? No.

324
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,451
We gotta keep him safe.

325
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:26,920
So, can The Flash talk to him?

326
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:28,917
Again.

327
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,592
Yeah, I'll talk to him.
I'll try, I promise.

328
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,507
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

329
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:36,846
(EXHALES) Thank you.

330
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,787
I thought throwing things was Harry's
preferred method of dealing with stress.

331
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,118
That is how frustrated I am right now.

332
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,505
I'm just running out of ideas
as to how to make this work.

333
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:07,789
Where's Barry? I need a taste

334
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,335
of that Walking on Sunshine thing
he's got going on right now.

Okay? Breathe. Breathe.

You're okay, right? You're shaking.

340
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,605
I... lthought I saw him.
Zoom, I thought I saw him right there.

341
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:35,151
It'sjust me, okay?
Look at me, he's not here. He's not here.

342
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,317
(EXHALES)

343
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,662
I see him everywhere.

344
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:44,919
Look, you literallyjust escaped
a psychopath who kidnapped you. All right?

345
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:47,704
So I think it's normal for you
to have a severe reaction like this.

346
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,000
This is so much worse than that.

347
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:52,167
I'm afraid all the time.

348
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,338
I don't think I can ever move forward.

349

that you might be showing up.

Well, if he told you what I can do,
you should look more afraid.

it's how we're gonna stop Zoom's army.

472
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,898
By giving them all electro-shock therapy?

473
00:28:05,057 --> 00:28:07,310
By giving them all
dimensional-shock therapy.

474
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,276
This is where I play stupid
and you explain the science.

475
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:14,193
Okay, fair enough. So, all matter vibrates
at its own unique frequency, right?

476
00:28:14,358 --> 00:28:16,452
You disrupt that frequency,
you disrupt the matter.

477
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,830
Like how an opera singer shatters glass
with her voice.

478
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:20,286
Exactly. So, we found out

479
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:23,952
that all Earth-2 people vibrate
at their own, more erratic frequency.

480
00:28:24,118 --> 00:28:25,371
HARRISON: Higher frequency.

481
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,913
- Different frequency.
- Higher.

482
00:28:27,663 --> 00:28:29,632
- Higher frequency than we do.
- Right.

483
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,419
So, I ran this all past Hartley, right?

484
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:36,715
And he postulated that we could create
a sort of dimensional tuning fork. Voila'!

485
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,224
Okay, you didn't do it yourself.

486
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,140
- Just let me have this one, okay?
- HARRISON: All right, have it.

487
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:45,808
Thank you. So, if you run around the city
fast enough to create a refracting field,

488
00:28:45,973 --> 00:28:51,855
the device can send out a pulse
that will bounce off of it, split apart,

489
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,365
and collide with itself over and over.

490
00:28:54,523 --> 00:28:57,117
Amplifying it to an erratic frequency
on the Earth-2...

491
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,996
- Higher. Higherfrequency.
- Higher frequency on the Earth-2 spectrum.

492
00:29:00,154 --> 00:29:02,123
And when that pulse hits anyone
from Earth-2...

493
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:03,784
It'll disrupt their nervous system.

494
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,955
Earth-2 metas go night-night.

495
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,253
- Even Zoom?
- Even Zoom.

496
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,836
Harry and Jesse are from Earth-2.

497
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,500
How do we keep the pulse
from hurting them?

498
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,963
Detective, I didn't know you cared.

499
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:14,251
Yes, you did.

500
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,844
(CHUCKLES) Well, we designed these
headphones to protect us from the pulse.

WOMAN: Maybe you're not as powerful
as you think!

00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,653
What are you two doing here?

Why should you have all the fun?

519

I thought you two were dead.

520

And we'd like to keep it that way.

For now.

00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,603
You think you two can pull one over
on Zoom?

Well, enjoy being dead.

524

I told you.

525
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,271
Give her a chance.

00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:55,732

you can take on Zoom.

We can.

You don't even know how powerful you are.

535
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,964

you can take down a building.

That, my friend, is a 75-KTSB,

00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,797
40,000 watt reverberating sound amplifier,

designed to single out
the operating frequency

547
00:32:02,336 --> 00:32:04,009
of every single Earth-2 being
on this planet,

548
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,345
which, when contained and magnified

549
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:09,135
by The Flash creating
a sound pressure wall around the city,

550
00:32:09,301 --> 00:32:13,102
will render
all of us Earth-2 beings unconscious.

- No.
- No.

629
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:59,306
All right. Well, Flash, thanks.
The man who saved Central City once again.

630
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,389
No, we're all just part of the same team.

631
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,771
Speaking of teams,
where the hell is Allen?

632
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,519
(GRUNTS) Sorry, man. Sorry.
Hey, heard my name.

633
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:10,733
- Uh, what's up?
- Good.

634
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:12,943
Well, you've got about 100 meta-criminal
cases to get through,

635
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,574
so I would get to cracking if I were you.

636
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,827
I will get right on that.

637
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:19,911
Captain.

638
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,623
- (SNICKERING) Well done.
- Thanks.

639
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:27,663
Listen, uh, I've been thinking
about Wally some more.

640
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,501
Are you gonna talk to him again?

641
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,708
- No, I'm not.
- Why not?

642
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,422
Because he's your son, Joe.

643
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,177
I know he's my son.

644
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:38,347
Look, no, what I mean is,
he's got your values.

645
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,601
He's got your inner drive
to help people do what's right.

646
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:45,396
We're supposed to think we're something
we're not until we become that thing.

647
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,641
That's the path that Wally's on.

648
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:52,362
I'm not gonna stop him from being the hero
that he's gonna become.

649
00:37:53,353 --> 00:37:54,697
I really don't think you should, either.

650
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,572
I can't wait till you have kids
and they torture you.

651
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,487
- I'm gonna laugh in your face.
- (LAUGHS)

652
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,789
All right, gramps.

653
00:38:03,947 --> 00:38:05,666
- Poppa.
- What?

654
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,786
My grandkid's gonna call me Poppa.

655
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:12,460
(LAUGHING) All right.

656
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,137
What in the world?

657
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,849
- What is this?
- CISCO: Blame Iris.

658
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:29,356
Okay, I just figured that since Henry
is officially back for good,

659
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:30,858
we should celebrate.

660
00:38:31,016 --> 00:38:33,896
And since Zoom is gone
and the city is quiet right now.

661
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,148
I appreciate it, Iris. Thank you.

662
00:38:38,565 --> 00:38:40,659
- Hi, Tina.
- DR. MCGEE: Hello, Henry.

663
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,411
- Jesse. Hi.
- Hi.

664
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:47,416
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

665
00:38:47,574 --> 00:38:50,043
- You look great.
- Thank you.

666
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,539
I hope you don't mind
that I invited Dr. McGee.

667
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,088
Seems like somebody's glad you did.

668
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,048
- Mmm-hmm.
- (CHUCKLES)

669
00:38:58,585 --> 00:39:00,634
So, I guess you are invincible.

670
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,925
- Told you. The Speed Force is with us.
- Mmm. (CHUCKLES)

671
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:11,309
Since I'm feeling extra invincible lately,

672
00:39:12,432 --> 00:39:15,106
what do you say you and I

673
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,989
give this a shot?

674
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,402
Yeah, I would like that.

675
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:28,786
So, is it true?

676
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:30,786
You saved The Flash's life?

677
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:35,297
Oh, I mean, I was just in the right place
at the right time.

678
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,925
Proud of you, Wally. You did good.

679
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,420
Thanks, Dad.

680
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,139
- (CHUCKLES)
- What?

681
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,471
Uh, I'm just... I'm proud of you, too.

682
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,175
- Soup's on.
- CISCO: Hey!

683
00:39:47,342 --> 00:39:50,096
Taking out a city full of monsters
makes a man hungry.

684
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,186
First,

685
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,141
a toast.

686
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,610
- To family.
- ALL: To family.

687
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,648
That's my kind of toast, short and sweet,
let's eat.

688
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,815
(LAUGHING)

689
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,449
Oh. You guys. Great.

690
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,742
(WOMAN SCREAMING)

691
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,083
It's Earth-2.

692
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:28,222
Cisco, what, what is it?

693
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,054
What'd you see?

694
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,268
What do you mean, see?

695
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,853
Cisco gets visions.

696
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,813
- I don't understand.
- What, Cisco?

697
00:40:37,976 --> 00:40:42,197
Earth-2 splitting in half,
straight down through the poles.

698
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,697
Tell me I didn't just vibe the future.

699
00:40:44,858 --> 00:40:47,862
Please, tell me I did not just see
the end of the world.

700
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:00,333
Our story continues, Flash.

701
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,380
- DR. MCGEE: Henry!
- Oh, my God!

702
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:17,896
Dad? Dad?

703
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:20,561
(GASPS)

704
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,690
It's poetic,
returning to your childhood home.

705
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,907
Jay, don't do this.

706
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,822
All right? I'm begging you.
I'm begging you!

707
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,333
- Take me. Kill me.
- No!

708
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,710
You still won't believe me
that you and I are the same.

709
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:37,869
Come on, come on.

710
00:41:38,036 --> 00:41:39,583
Barry, look at me, son. Look at me.

711
00:41:39,746 --> 00:41:42,250
So, I'm gonna have to make you believe me.

712
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:46,547
Whatever happens,
you have made me the happiest father.

713
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:47,838
- Dad.
- This time,

714
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,429
you're gonna watch your parent die,
just like I did.

715
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,389
- No! No!
- And this is what's gonna make you

716
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,269
just like me.

717
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:56,146
- Your mother and I love...
- Jay!

718
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,023
No!
