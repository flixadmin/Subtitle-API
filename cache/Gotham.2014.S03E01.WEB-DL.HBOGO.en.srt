1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,280
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,440
- I set a bomb.
- Thousands of people could die.

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,040
Yes, but paying that price
will be better

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,160
than releasing what's down there.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,440
Are you ready to play?

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,600
Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill,
but who runs Wayne Enterprises?

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,480
There's a secret council in Gotham.
It's them that wanted me dead.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,280
We're so close to the ultimate truth.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,800
Strange, you did
a very bad thing to me

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,440
and now you're going to...

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,920
Impossible.

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,720
Nothing is impossible.

13
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,320
Thank you.

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,120
Bruce, I might not see you
for a while.

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,480
- Where you going?
- I have to find Lee.

16
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,560
Hello?

17
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,600
We're closed.

18
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,480
If you leave now,
I won't call the cops.

19
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,120
Hey.

20
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,520
Any chance you wanna come quietly?

21
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,000
{\an5}At 8.15 this evening

22
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,240
{\an5}an individual robbed a pharmacy
and attacked its owner.

23
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,240
{\an5}But we don't have an ID as yet.

24
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,080
{\an5}We believe that this individual
is another escapee from Indian Hill.

25
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,120
Captain Barnes, can you clarify...?

26
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,720
{\an5}Captain Barnes. Captain Barnes!
Valerie Vale, <i>Gotham Gazette.</i>

27
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,360
{\an5}Why can't we see the escapee?

28
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,040
{\an5}Because crews are still
picking up the pieces.

29
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,720
{\an5}This isn't the first time
that a bounty hunter

30
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,640
{\an5}has apprehended an escapee.

31
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,840
{\an5}Is the G.C.P.D. incapable
of handling this threat themselves?

32
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,480
{\an5}Only a handful of escapees have been
brought in by bounty hunters.

33
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,600
{\an5}The vast majority
were apprehended by.

34
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,320
{\an5}Excuse me. Excuse me.
I take issue with the word "threat."

35
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,360
{\an5}These escapees are themselves
victims of Hugo Strange.

36
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,920
{\an5}Now, if any ordinary,
hard-working citizen

37
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,360
{\an5}wants to help these poor souls
off the street

38
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,080
{\an5}so that they may receive
the proper treatment

39
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,720
{\an5}well, these citizens should be lauded
and rewarded financially.

40
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,920
{\an5}Mr. James, before they were taken
to Indian Hill

41
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,880
{\an5}these poor souls
were all criminally insane inmates

42
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,960
{\an5}at Arkham Asylum, were they not?

43
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
{\an5}Next question.

44
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,280
{\an5}- Hear that? You should be lauded.
- I'll settle for the cash.

45
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,240
{\an5}How many escapees
you've brought in now? Six?

46
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,480
{\an5}Five grand a pop, that's not too bad.

47
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,960
{\an5}What happens
when there aren't any more?

48
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,320
{\an5}Don't think Gotham's running out
of monsters any time soon.

49
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,320
{\an5}I really can't get you
to come back, huh?

50
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,360
{\an5}Look, whatever happened
when you went to see Lee, and...

51
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,240
- You know I don't like to pry.
- Sure, you do.

52
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,120
{\an5}That's because you won't tell me
anything.

53
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,240
The point is man is not supposed
to be alone.

54
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,240
- You have a family here.
- Can't do it, Harv.

55
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,720
But you've got no problem
chasing down Strange's freaks?

56
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,880
Yeah, it pays the rent.

57
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,400
You are a cop in everything but name.

58
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,600
Yeah. Except I don't have to
listen to Barnes.

59
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,440
I get to go home when I want,
get drunk when I want.

60
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,800
And at end of the day

61
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,280
I sleep because saving Gotham's
not my job anymore.

62
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,280
Jim, I love you like a brother

63
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,800
but you've gotta stop blaming the job

64
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,160
for what happened
between you and Lee.

65
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,760
And do you really think
I don't get drunk when I want?

66
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,800
Detective Bullock, I looked
into the drug the escapee was after.

67
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,800
It's a powerful immune suppressant.
Gordon.

68
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,120
See, look at Lucius here,

69
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,040
our new resident expert
on all things scientific.

70
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,320
He said <i>sayonara</i>
to the Wayne Enterprises robots.

71
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,720
And he loves it here.

72
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,080
Wayne Enterprises revealed itself
as morally corrupt.

73
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,400
Here,
despite the primitive facilities

74
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,200
casual violence,
fascistic meathead culture...

75
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,280
Lucius.

76
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,520
I love it.

77
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,160
Anyway, that drug is only sold
at three pharmacies in the city.

78
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,880
And the other two pharmacies
were both robbed in the last month.

79
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,800
The question is: why are Indian Hill
escapees now robbing pharmacies?

80
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,880
Good question.

81
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,720
So, what do you say,
just like the old days

82
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,720
you and me run it together,
huh, partner?

83
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,080
You get a hard lead on an escapee
and the price is right,

84
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,160
I'll bring him in.

85
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
Thanks for the drink.

86
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Lucius.

87
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,160
"Fascistic meathead culture"?

88
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,160
I mean, you couldn't try to be
just a little bit more positive?

89
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,640
I was very positive.

90
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,440
Why is Hugo Strange the only one
that's been arrested?

91
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,640
- The situation...
- And what about the rumors

92
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,800
that Indian Hill
is a Wayne Enterprise facility?

93
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,840
And how many more escapees
are at large?

94
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,440
Are we talking 20? 30?

95
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,720
Well, just give me a blink
if I'm close.

96
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,840
The situation is firmly in hand.

97
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
Liar!

98
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,440
Oh, no.

99
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,520
My name is Oswald Cobblepot...

100
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,240
We know who you are, Penguin.
What do you want?

101
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,040
What do I want?

102
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,480
I want you to tell the truth
to the people of Gotham.

103
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,080
They would have us believe
that there is no danger.

104
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,880
But I was there the night those
creatures broke out of Indian Hill.

105
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,600
I saw them.

106
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,160
And I saw who's leading them.

107
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,400
Are you saying the escapees
are organized?

108
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,560
Hello. That is what I am saying.

109
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,320
There is absolutely nothing
to support that.

110
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,480
I told the police who to look for.
I begged them. Time and again.

111
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,160
And they have done nothing.

112
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,120
So I am here to speak directly

113
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,520
to the good people of Gotham.

114
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,080
The enemy's name is Fish Mooney.

115
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,080
Fish Mooney?

116
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,480
She hasn't been spotted
for over six months.

117
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,680
She's either long gone or she's dead.

118
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,400
I wish I shared your simple belief.

119
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,040
She is a criminal.

120
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,120
She is a murderer.

121
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,440
And now God knows
what kind of monster

122
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,320
Hugo Strange has turned her into.

123
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,880
I implore every citizen of Gotham

124
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,320
if you love your family,
if you love your children

125
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,960
find Fish Mooney.

126
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,720
Until then, no one is safe.

127
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,040
Hello, Jim.

128
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,600
Oswald.

129
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,520
I'm surprised
you haven't found Mooney.

130
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
I hear you're quite the bounty hunter
these days.

131
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,560
You haven't made it worth my while.

132
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,440
- Tough guy now.
- But he makes a point.

133
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,600
<i>I know what boys like</i>

134
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,720
<i>I know what guys want</i>

135
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,360
<i>I know what boys like</i>

136
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,640
<i>I've got what boys like</i>

137
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,240
<i>I know what boys like</i>

138
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,400
<i>I know what guys want</i>

139
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,280
<i>I know what boys like</i>

140
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,720
<i>Boys like me</i>

141
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,520
Ozzie.

142
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
Butch.

143
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,480
What a nice surprise.

144
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,320
Forgive me for not coming sooner.

145
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,040
The place looks marvelous.

146
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,600
- Wouldn't you say so, Butch?
- Yeah. Place looks great.

147
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,920
I imagine you're here
about your offer.

148
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,840
To let us shelter
under your umbrella?

149
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,360
I only want what's best for you.

150
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,360
Appreciate the thought.
But we're big girls.

151
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,080
We can handle ourselves.

152
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,120
Can't we?

153
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Sure we can.

154
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hey, Butch.

155
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,880
Hey. Hi, how... How you doing?

156
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,360
You taking care of yourself?

157
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,560
Yeah... Yeah. Yeah.

158
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,040
So... So, you, how you doing?

159
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,560
You already asked her that.

160
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,200
Listen, you guys should take him up
on his offer.

161
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,160
Gotham's full of rough characters.

162
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,840
You look great, by the way.

163
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,440
Wait over there, please.

164
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,840
Poor bunny. Breakups are hard.

165
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,320
I offered to kill you.

166
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,080
I thought it would raise his spirits.

167
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,240
It would be my pleasure
seeing as how you murdered my mother.

168
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,160
But he is nursing some foolish hope
that you two will get back together.

169
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Love.

170
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,720
You can take your offer
and stick it...

171
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,320
We'll think about it, Ozzie.

172
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Fine.

173
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,440
But that's not the only reason
I'm here.

174
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,160
Spread the word. I want Fish Mooney.

175
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,240
And I will give a million dollars
to whoever can bring her to me.

176
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,800
Dead or alive,

177
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,960
or chopped into pieces.

178
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,720
I want her.

179
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,640
Are you okay, Butch?

180
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,640
- World getting you down?
- I'm fine, kid.

181
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,360
And you're too young to be in here.
Scram.

182
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,360
Jeez, just trying to be nice.

183
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,440
Just seeing her kills me, you know?

184
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,800
Get over it.

185
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,520
And that child
just stole your wallet.

186
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,160
Hey. Barbara and that whip lady
are gonna get angry,

187
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,120
you're stealing from their customers.

188
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,280
Let them. I got other things going.

189
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,400
- Like what?
- Top secret.

190
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,160
Let's eat. I'm starving.

191
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,480
Hey, kid. Take it.

192
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,160
It's yours.

193
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,520
Keep feeding strays,
one's gonna follow you home.

194
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,920
Like you?

195
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,520
Come on.

196
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,160
Well, that should be the last of it.

197
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,160
I'll put the kettle on.

198
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,800
There is nothing
like a sweet cup of tea

199
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,480
to make home feel like home
after a long trip away.

200
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,760
Eh, Master Bruce?

201
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,920
You all right?

202
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,200
Were we right to leave, Alfred?

203
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,320
To stay away all this time?

204
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,520
Well, considering the appalling state
of the topiary

205
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,280
I should say absolutely bloody not.

206
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,600
Alfred, you know what I mean.

207
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,280
I know you know why we left.

208
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,960
We had to leave.

209
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,240
You're nervous about tomorrow,
aren't you?

210
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
Yes.

211
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,600
Well, you wouldn't be human
if you weren't.

212
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,280
So why don't you go through there
and take a pew, put your feet up

213
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,360
and I'll see
about that lovely cup of tea?

214
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,360
All right?

215
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,520
You saving that for someone special?

216
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,360
Coffee, please.

217
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,880
"<i>Search continues for new
Arkham Asylum director.</i>" Great.

218
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,080
Good luck finding anyone
to take that job.

219
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,640
I'm Valerie Vale,
reporter for the <i>Gazette.</i>

220
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,800
I know who you are.

221
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,640
And you're James Gordon,
son of a respected Gotham DA

222
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,000
former war hero,
former white knight cop,

223
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,440
now bounty hunter.

224
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,960
You know, someone should do a story
on you.

225
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Not interested.

226
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,760
Yeah, me neither, actually.

227
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
You were there that night,
in Indian Hill.

228
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
I got nothing to say.

229
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,320
What about the fact that besides
Hugo Strange and his assistant

230
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,920
no one else has been arrested?

231
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Or that despite everything
pointing to Wayne Enterprises

232
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,120
there seems to be zero investigation.

233
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,640
You're new to Gotham, aren't you?

234
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,960
Okay, this is where you tell me
things work differently here?

235
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,920
I'm not from Gotham
but my dad's a cop.

236
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,720
My brothers are cops.
And things work the same everywhere.

237
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,600
I was going to say it's hard to find
a quiet bar in this city.

238
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,640
I like coming here.
Please don't make me find another.

239
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,520
Now, do you think Cobblepot's right?

240
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,720
That Fish Mooney's organizing
the escapees?

241
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,080
Penguin is a liar and a murderer.

242
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,720
But...

243
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,040
But based on the escapees
and knowing Fish...

244
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,520
I hope not.

245
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,560
Well, he's offering a million dollars
to whoever brings her in.

246
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,640
You're welcome.

247
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,560
It's a puzzle.

248
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,600
The trick is opening it.

249
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,760
The man at the store said it's one
of the most difficult ever made.

250
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,480
People pass it down unsolved
for generations.

251
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,360
A mathematician once went mad
trying to...

252
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
Yes.

253
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,080
Well, there you go.

254
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,400
It was a lovely thought.

255
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,320
And did you get the biscuits?

256
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,200
And the sweater?
I know how drafty these rooms are.

257
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,480
- Mr. Penguin...
- Oswald.

258
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,560
When I think of how I treated you,
and...

259
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
Stop.

260
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,040
Why are you being so kind?

261
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,720
Talking to you these past months

262
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,440
I don't know
how I would have gotten by otherwise.

263
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,640
With Fish out there
planning who knows what

264
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,480
and me being surrounded
by morons and lunatics.

265
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,840
I know the feeling.

266
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,440
Why didn't she kill me
when she had the chance?

267
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,160
I was powerless.

268
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,240
She must have a larger goal.

269
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,880
I... I need to know
what she is doing.

270
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,360
Do you?

271
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,280
When Alexander encountered
the Gordian knot

272
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,400
a knot so complex that no one
had ever been able to untangle it

273
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,160
he just removed his sword
and cut it in two.

274
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,560
Details can be distracting.
Sometimes...

275
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,000
a simple solution is best.

276
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,160
So no matter what she's planning,
just remember...

277
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,600
penguins eat...

278
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
fish.

279
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,080
You know why we're here.

280
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,080
What are you doing here?
Stop. Stop...

281
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,120
So, what are we after?

282
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,440
It's not like they keep cash around.

283
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,880
- For now, survival.
- Don't move!

284
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Hands.

285
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Hands.

286
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,160
Of course.

287
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,200
Drop the gun.

288
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,440
Now, knock yourself out.

289
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,560
That was awesome.

290
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
How did you...?

291
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,600
Whoa, Fish.

292
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,880
I'm fine. Watch the door.

293
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,880
Yeah. And that's the only company
that makes the drug.

294
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,040
<i>Cray Pharma. They've actually have
a warehouse here in Gotham.</i>

295
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,360
You think they could be a target?

296
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,960
<i>Yeah. They're the only pharmacy
that carries the drug.</i>

297
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,360
If somebody wants it,
they'll have to go to the source.

298
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,440
- Let me find the address.
- <i>That's all right.</i>

299
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,040
- James Gordon.
- Hands where I can see them.

300
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,360
So, what, you're here to collect the
bounty that Penguin has over my head?

301
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,520
What is it? A million dollars?

302
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,160
And to think I let that punk live.

303
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,680
Well, then
I think you'd better cuff me.

304
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,040
Cuff yourself.

305
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,720
- How many others you have with you?
- They're all with me.

306
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,200
Every wretched soul
that Hugo Strange experimented on.

307
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,680
But tonight, just him.

308
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,560
Did you hear them rats last night
scurrying around in the attic?

309
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,960
Drove me bloody bonkers.

310
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,120
Now, may I ask you, what's the point
of having a caretaker

311
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,520
if they can't take care
of nothing, eh?

312
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,000
You all right, Master B?

313
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
Hungry.

314
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,000
I should have eaten.

315
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,840
Excuse me, gentlemen.

316
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,000
I do this, there's no turning back.

317
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
No.

318
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,360
You say your piece.

319
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,560
We'll see about getting you
a proper breakfast, all right?

320
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,120
I'd like to thank the board
for giving me this time.

321
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,440
It will come as no surprise
I'd like to talk about Indian Hill.

322
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,800
I know preliminary investigations
have concluded

323
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,480
Hugo Strange acted alone.

324
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,440
I reject this conclusion.

325
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,000
While trapped in Indian Hill,
I was led to believe an unnamed group

326
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,720
had taken control of my company

327
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,520
and it was they
who hired Hugo Strange.

328
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,520
I left Gotham both for my own safety
and so that I might have the time

329
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,640
to discover hard evidence
of their existence.

330
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,240
A conspiracy theory?
That's why we're all here?

331
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,200
Excuse me, Master Bruce.

332
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,200
Pardon me, sir.
Might I have your name, please?

333
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,280
- What?
- Your name, please, sir.

334
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,640
- Crowley.
- Mr. Crowley

335
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,680
did you parents ever teach you
any manners?

336
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,600
- I don't have to listen to this.
- Oh, but you do, sir.

337
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,680
That is precisely the point
that I am making.

338
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,040
I know how it sounds.

339
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,000
But I now have proof they exist.

340
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,360
And I can tell you that they're here.

341
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,760
In this room.

342
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,440
I wanna talk face-to-face.

343
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,520
You have 24 hours to contact me

344
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,080
or the information that I've gathered
will be sent

345
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,680
to every newspaper
and television station in Gotham.

346
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,160
Thank you for your time.

347
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,160
Pancakes?

348
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,160
Pancakes.

349
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,760
And how did the board react?

350
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,360
Then he leaves us no choice.

351
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,360
Bruce Wayne.

352
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,440
Do it quietly.

353
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,960
- You Barbara Kean?
- We're closed.

354
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,280
What?

355
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
You built this club on our territory.

356
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,520
We let you because we heard
Penguin had your back.

357
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,320
And now we hear that ain't so.

358
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,080
Bad for you, good for us.

359
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,200
Get the hell out.

360
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,720
This place is ours now.
Do you understand?

361
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,520
You can't just come in...

362
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
Don't hit me, okay? Please.

363
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,160
- Hey.
- Hey.

364
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,400
You still paying for stuff
about the Indian Hill freaks?

365
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,400
It depends. If it's good.

366
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,480
Is Fish Mooney good?

367
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,080
I guess I'm finding a new bar.

368
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,080
I heard you ran
into Fish Mooney yesterday.

369
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,640
- So?
- So...

370
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,560
are you still interested
in finding her?

371
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,920
Every cop in the city
is looking for her now.

372
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,760
But I know where she's gonna be next.

373
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,160
And why are you telling me?

374
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,440
You see, I need something
from the cops.

375
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,680
They're not gonna tell me.

376
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,000
- But Bullock still trusts you.
- And you want me to lie to him.

377
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,400
A million dollars
covers a lot of sins.

378
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,240
And obviously, I get to come along.

379
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,640
Don't tell me you have a conscience.

380
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,760
Yeah, all right.

381
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,360
- Jimmy.
- Hey.

382
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,960
So after your run-in with Fish,
Barnes had us up all night

383
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,280
rousting her old hideouts.

384
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,400
Yeah. You find anything?

385
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,640
<i>Nada.</i>
But I did get what you asked for.

386
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,840
You wanna tell me what this is about?

387
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,320
Just a hunch. Probably nothing.

388
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,360
Look, if you've got a hot lead
you don't wanna share

389
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,000
so you can collect Penguin's million,
I got no problem with that.

390
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,520
Just don't get yourself killed
or me fired, okay?

391
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,880
I'll do my best.
Hey, get some rest, huh?

392
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
Hey.

393
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,760
- When did you get back?
- Couple of days ago.

394
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,480
- I tried to find you before I left.
- No worries.

395
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,560
You remember what I discovered
that night in Indian Hill

396
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,400
that there was a secret group
that infiltrated my company?

397
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,520
I wasn't paying attention.

398
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,480
I needed time to research them.

399
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,280
- I couldn't do it here
- Okay.

400
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,400
I have a plan,
but these people are powerful.

401
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,800
We need to assume
they know you and I are friends.

402
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,280
- You need to be careful.
- Got it.

403
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,760
- I'm serious.
- I can see that.

404
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,680
I'm sorry I was gone for so long.

405
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,480
Don't apologize.

406
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,560
Shoot, if I could fly to Italy
and eat pizza all day, I would too.

407
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,200
- It's Switzerland.
- Italy's better.

408
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,160
- Selina...
- Bruce, seriously.

409
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,840
Don't sweat it.

410
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,200
I gotta go.

411
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,200
I'll see you around.

412
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,360
Good to see you, Selina.

413
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,360
- Hey, did you get it?
- Yeah.

414
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,440
She's under guard in a building
on Douglas and 80th.

415
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,000
There's one thing, though.

416
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,520
Hey. Hey!
What the hell are you doing?

417
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,320
You're a hundred yards
from a police station.

418
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,680
- I'll be back in an hour or two.
- We had a deal.

419
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,560
If there's a story,
I'll make sure you get it.

420
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,040
Oh, you're a son of a bitch.

421
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,640
Also, you could scream

422
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,600
but then you'd have to tell the cops
everything

423
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,080
then you'd lose the story entirely.

424
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,160
Gordon.

425
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,880
Gordon!

426
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,000
Son of a bitch.

427
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,520
- 47, this is dispatch.
<i>- This is 47.</i>

428
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,680
Report to Captain Barnes immediately.

429
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,600
Relief team will take your place.
Over and out.

430
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,400
<i>You've got it. We're out of here.</i>

431
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,360
- I knocked.
- I didn't answer.

432
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,560
- You alone?
- All day, every day.

433
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,000
I wasn't expecting Jim Gordon
to stop by.

434
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,080
You aren't supposed to be here,
are you?

435
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,400
How come you're not in jail?

436
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,000
I agreed to testify
against Professor Strange.

437
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,880
In case you're about to ask

438
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,560
I don't know who really ran
Indian Hill.

439
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,640
I don't care who ran Indian Hill.

440
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,720
Then why are you here?

441
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,320
Fish Mooney.

442
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,080
And why would I know
how to find Fish Mooney?

443
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,680
No reason you would.

444
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,400
But it's clear
whatever you and Strange did to her

445
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,800
is making her sick.

446
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,880
Her people are stealing drugs.

447
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,280
But I don't think they're working.
She's gonna come after you.

448
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,400
Or her goons will

449
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,400
and they'll lead me to her.

450
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,040
And how will they find me?
Only the police are supposed to know.

451
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,480
My guess, she'll have someone
get the information for her.

452
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,000
Someone who wouldn't suspect
being used.

453
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,200
Maybe a reporter.

454
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,160
She'll follow that person
or whoever she goes to for help

455
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,320
in this case, a bounty hunter

456
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,960
right to you.

457
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,840
You led them to me on purpose.
You're using me as bait.

458
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,520
I don't like being played.
Plus, she's worth a million dollars.

459
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,640
Gordon, help. Somebody help!

460
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,240
I don't know which one of you
I wanna bat over the head

461
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,480
with this cane more.

462
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,880
I get it.

463
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,440
Life disappointed you.

464
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,920
So what? Does that make you special?
I'm done with you.

465
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,280
You cross me again

466
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,960
I will have you skinned alive
and your head put on a pike.

467
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,320
And you.

468
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,680
When I came back, I saw the way
you handled things while I was away.

469
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,880
I swear,
I had this feeling right here.

470
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,600
I thought
I was having a heart attack.

471
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,560
But it was pride, Bullock. In you.

472
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,240
The next time I have that feeling

473
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,320
I'll know it was just gas.

474
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,240
You both better pray
that we find her.

475
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,480
Get out of my sight.

476
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,240
I'd say that went well.

477
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,480
He was right, though.
About me being captain.

478
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,320
- I did a good job. I even liked it.
- Yeah.

479
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,320
Hey, look. I'm sorry, Harvey.
I'll do my best to find Peabody.

480
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,600
Honestly, Jim, for the time of being

481
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,520
it might be better if you just...

482
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,600
stayed away.

483
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,280
Hey. Hey.

484
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,480
- Just tell me, did you know?
- That I know what?

485
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,800
That Mooney was using us
to find Peabody.

486
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,920
You mean using you?

487
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,040
Yeah, it's her kind of play.

488
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,200
- You should have told me.
- Sure.

489
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,960
Why don't you tell me
who your source was?

490
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,080
That's it? You're not gonna
try and find Mooney?

491
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,400
Barnes is on it. I've had a long day.
I'm gonna get a drink.

492
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Gordon.

493
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
Nothing.

494
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,720
- Come on.
- I said no.

495
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,280
- Who are they?
- Just people.

496
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,080
- They need me to do things for them.
- Well, I can do stuff.

497
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,880
These are scary people, okay?
It's for your own good.

498
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,640
- You just don't wanna share.
- Just stay here, all right?

499
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
Hello.

500
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,920
What do you want?

501
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,400
I want to talk to her.

502
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,280
I was following her.

503
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,680
She was kind to me.

504
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,160
But then she met him. That boy.

505
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,120
What happened to you?

506
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,920
- You know me?
- Yeah. I know Bruce Wayne.

507
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,320
Who is he? Who is he?

508
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,760
What's wrong with you? Let go of me.

509
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,320
Bruce Wayne! Bruce Wayne!

510
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,400
Who is he?

511
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,600
I really do not have time for this.

512
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,600
- He started it.
- It's a lie.

513
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,560
- The cwub is in our territory.
- "Cwub"?

514
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,360
What's a "cwub"?

515
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,320
- Cwub.
- What's a "cwub"?

516
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,040
I mean, can anyone understand him?
Do you know what a "cwub" is?

517
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,800
- Cwub.
- Enough.

518
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,320
We will work something out.

519
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,600
Now, this is his territory.
What are you willing to give him?

520
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,520
That is not helpful.

521
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,120
Are you telling me
you don't see what's going on here?

522
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,480
He is behind this.

523
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,520
What are you talking about?

524
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,600
He sent this ding-dong to squeeze us
hoping it would send us back to you

525
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,800
so that he could lord it over Tabby.

526
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,240
Ain't that right?

527
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,920
That's... That's just...

528
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,000
That's crazy. She's crazy.

529
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,960
- She was in Arkham, hello.
- Hello, so was I.

530
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,360
Is that true, Butch?

531
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,560
Unbelievable.

532
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,680
Fine. Run your club.

533
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,680
Just so we're clear

534
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,240
the only reason
you are alive is Butch.

535
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,360
The moment he gives me
the word, you're mine.

536
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,800
Hello again.

537
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,080
I know why you brought me here.

538
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,760
Your body is beginning to reject
the changes we made to your DNA.

539
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,880
You feel it every time you use

540
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,120
your ability.

541
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,320
How do I fix it?

542
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,880
Stop using the power.

543
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,880
Every time you use it,
new cells are activated

544
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,480
and your body rejects them.

545
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,760
Stop and you will recover.

546
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,120
It's that simple?

547
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,080
It's just, I like the new me.

548
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,560
I can't fix you.
I can't reorder your DNA...

549
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,760
There's always a way.

550
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,960
Strange. He can.

551
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,000
He's the only one.

552
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,600
- Where is Strange?
- I don't know.

553
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
They've hidden him somewhere secret.

554
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,480
Him fixing me
is just the beginning.

555
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,840
I want an army.

556
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,960
I want an army like me.

557
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,520
And he is going to give it to me.

558
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,000
- He can't...
- Oh, he will.

559
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,800
Or he will die.

560
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,440
You remember Marv.

561
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,120
He's one of yours.

562
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:34,640
Sort of the fountain of youth
in reverse.

563
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,960
Good night, Ethel.

564
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,320
We caught a spy.

565
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,040
- Ivy?
- Selina, tell this creep

566
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,200
to let go off me.

567
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,520
She's my friend.

568
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,640
- I don't like spies.
- She's not a spy.

569
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,720
Ivy, what are you doing here?

570
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,080
I followed you the other day
so I knew where you went.

571
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,960
Bruce Wayne came looking for you
but he was acting weird.

572
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,120
Who else have you told about us?

573
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,680
- No one.
- I asked her.

574
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,240
- Selina?
- Ivy, shut up.

575
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,200
They're those monsters everyone's
talking about, aren't they?

576
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,840
You better tell your friend

577
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,040
to be careful
who she calls a monster.

578
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,840
You'd better stay away from me.
All of you. I'll tell.

579
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,960
Marv.

580
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
No.

581
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,480
Leave her alone.

582
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,960
Stay away from me!

583
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,320
Ivy. Ivy!

584
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,240
Ivy!

585
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,440
Watch out!

586
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,080
Help!

587
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,240
Ivy?

588
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,320
Right. Once this alarm is set,
Master Bruce

589
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,800
no coming downstairs
till the morning.

590
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,880
Is that clear?

591
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,600
Yes. But was a new alarm system
really necessary?

592
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,400
I don't know. Was it really necessary
offering a challenge

593
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,840
to a shadowy cabal?

594
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,360
Yes, it was necessary, Master Bruce.

595
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,440
Alfred!

596
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,560
Al...

597
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,320
Alfred!

598
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,200
Alfred, wake up. Alfred!
