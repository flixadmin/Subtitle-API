1
00:00:01,302 --> 00:00:03,598
My name
is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,241
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:09,804
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:10,106 --> 00:00:12,740
to save my city.

5
00:00:12,742 --> 00:00:16,577
But to do so, I can't be
the killer I once was.

6
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:19,780
To honor my friend's memory,

7
00:00:19,782 --> 00:00:22,750
I must be someone else.

8
00:00:22,752 --> 00:00:26,304
I must be...something else.

9
00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:29,157
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:30,425
It's a hozen.

11
00:00:30,427 --> 00:00:32,844
In Buddhism,
it symbolizes reconnecting.

12
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:36,013
And now that Malcolm's
dead, there's only one archer left.

13
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:38,649
And I'm going to help
my boss catch him.

14
00:00:41,904 --> 00:00:44,305
Let the kid go.

15
00:00:44,307 --> 00:00:47,141
It's like you have a death wish.
And guess what?

16
00:00:47,143 --> 00:00:49,076
It's going to come true.

17
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:50,862
Yeah, well, someone
has to do something.

18
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:53,147
Stand up for what's
right, like he did.

19
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:31,118
Faster!

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,704
Foot's on
the floor, man.

21
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:36,991
Call it in.
This is FEMA truck 52.

22
00:01:36,993 --> 00:01:39,026
We're being pursued
by two armed bikers.

23
00:01:39,028 --> 00:01:42,497
We're heading south on Third Street,
requesting immediate assistance.

24
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:49,036
Come on,
get us out of here.

25
00:01:49,038 --> 00:01:50,972
Get us out of here!

26
00:02:07,222 --> 00:02:09,574
Who the hell was that?

27
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:17,124
Just so you know,

28
00:03:17,126 --> 00:03:19,460
the real bad guys
are getting away!

29
00:03:21,797 --> 00:03:25,850
♪ Headed for the open door

30
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:30,087
♪ tell me what
you're waiting for ♪

31
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:33,807
♪ look across
the great divide ♪

32
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:38,663
♪ soon they're going to hear
the sound, sound, sound ♪

33
00:03:38,665 --> 00:03:41,916
♪ when we come running

34
00:03:41,918 --> 00:03:44,085
We're going to need
more sparring dummies.

35
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:46,120
I'll start
ordering them in bulk.

36
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:48,322
This mean you're ready
to launch crusade 2.0?

37
00:03:48,324 --> 00:03:50,508
I'm ready, I just
don't know where to begin.

38
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,343
Last year, I had the list.

39
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:54,495
Getting justice was as simple
as crossing names out of a book.

40
00:03:54,497 --> 00:03:56,263
This is Starling City.
You never have to look far

41
00:03:56,265 --> 00:03:58,999
to find someone engaged
in illegal activity.

42
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:01,135
Yesterday Big Belly
Burger got robbed.

43
00:04:01,137 --> 00:04:03,471
Was Carly there? She ok?

44
00:04:03,473 --> 00:04:05,356
Yeah, she was, um,

45
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:07,841
it was her day off.

46
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:09,443
Good. Well, the three of us
should get dinner.

47
00:04:09,445 --> 00:04:11,345
I haven't seen her
since I got back.

48
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:13,097
Why the sudden interest
in my love life?

49
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:15,349
If it's important to you,
it's important to me.

50
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:17,201
Hey! I didn't
see you come in.

51
00:04:17,203 --> 00:04:20,438
I had a secret entrance
installed when I ran the club.

52
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,742
Kidding.

53
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:27,962
Hello?

54
00:04:27,964 --> 00:04:30,631
Yes, yeah,
this is Thea Queen.

55
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:35,886
Of course
that's where he is.

56
00:04:38,707 --> 00:04:41,475
Who is he, Roy?

57
00:04:41,477 --> 00:04:43,978
I already told you,
I don't know.

58
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,982
So you just happen
to have one of his arrows.

59
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:50,351
I hear he likes
green ones.

60
00:04:50,353 --> 00:04:51,570
Do you think this is funny?

61
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:54,335
Because I can charge you
with obstruction right now!

62
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:03,831
Look...

63
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:07,702
I used to feel
the same way as you.

64
00:05:07,704 --> 00:05:10,371
He has this way of...

65
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:12,990
seducing you.

66
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:18,212
Making you feel like
he's some kind of guardian angel.

67
00:05:18,214 --> 00:05:21,432
But he's not.

68
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:24,101
He causes chaos
and death.

69
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:26,086
And you trying
to emulate him

70
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:28,222
just makes
the situation worse.

71
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:30,808
Half the city fell into a hole.

72
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,977
I'd say the situation's
already worse.

73
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:35,062
Look, some of us
are just trying to make it better.

74
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:37,031
Who, like you
and the Hood?

75
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:39,500
Look, there--

76
00:05:39,502 --> 00:05:41,902
There are others.

77
00:05:41,904 --> 00:05:45,306
Others out there who are willing
to do what's right.

78
00:05:45,308 --> 00:05:48,793
I've seen them.
I've seen her.

79
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:51,328
I'm not interested
in anyone else.

80
00:05:53,131 --> 00:05:56,000
Just him.

81
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:06,093
What happened?

82
00:06:06,095 --> 00:06:08,128
Are you hurt?
Fender bender.

83
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,315
He totaled his car
playing hood junior.

84
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:13,100
At least
it wasn't my car.

85
00:06:13,102 --> 00:06:15,820
Don't say anything!
I already called you an attorney.

86
00:06:15,822 --> 00:06:18,355
That won't be necessary,
we're not pressing charges.

87
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:20,157
So long as he gives up
looking for trouble.

88
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,277
Might as well
tell him to give up breathing.

89
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,246
I'll talk to him.

90
00:06:25,248 --> 00:06:28,332
Ask him if he knows
anything about the Vigilante.

91
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:32,486
Roy has obviously forged
some sort of connection to him.

92
00:06:32,488 --> 00:06:34,121
Maybe it goes both ways.

93
00:06:34,123 --> 00:06:36,990
Doesn't sound like
the Vigilante to have a groupie.

94
00:06:36,992 --> 00:06:39,210
That's just it--
we don't know anything

95
00:06:39,212 --> 00:06:41,128
about the Vigilante.

96
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,047
Except for every time
that he shows up,

97
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:44,799
all hell breaks loose.

98
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:46,851
It has to stop, Ollie.

99
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:50,187
He has to be stopped.

100
00:06:55,193 --> 00:06:57,444
Thea.

101
00:06:57,446 --> 00:07:00,114
Can you ask Mr. Diggle
to bring the car around, please?

102
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,201
I'll always
think of you fondly.

103
00:07:04,203 --> 00:07:06,070
Save the speeches.

104
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:08,372
Your ex-girlfriend
already laid one on me.

105
00:07:08,374 --> 00:07:10,691
Still, no effect.

106
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:12,710
I used to be
a lot like you, Roy.

107
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:14,295
I doubt that.

108
00:07:14,297 --> 00:07:17,965
I spend more time in the back
of cop cars than limos, so...

109
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:22,386
The world
doesn't work anymore.

110
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:23,492
It broke a long time ago,

111
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:25,423
but it was like you were
the only one who noticed.

112
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:30,010
That makes you angry.

113
00:07:30,012 --> 00:07:32,012
And you're afraid
that that anger

114
00:07:32,014 --> 00:07:33,397
is going to burn you up inside

115
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,816
if you have to live
in the world one second longer

116
00:07:35,818 --> 00:07:40,053
knowing that you could
do something to fix it.

117
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:44,108
That anger's going
to put you in the hospital, kid.

118
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,443
Or worse.

119
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:48,779
Well, I'll take worse.

120
00:07:48,781 --> 00:07:51,732
It's better to be dead than
in a hospital these days, right?

121
00:07:51,734 --> 00:07:52,833
What do you mean?

122
00:07:52,835 --> 00:07:54,919
Been to the Glades
Memorial, lately?

123
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:57,338
No, but I didn't read
that it was damaged by the quake.

124
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,072
It wasn't.

125
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:01,008
The medicine that FEMA's been
sending the hospital

126
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,126
is being hijacked.

127
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:04,094
So, if they don't
re-supply,

128
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:06,180
they'll be forced to close.
By who?

129
00:08:06,182 --> 00:08:07,915
I don't know!

130
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:10,267
The doctors and nurses
are already bailing on the place.

131
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:12,953
And the cops? The cops rarely
venture that deep into the Glades,

132
00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:15,422
so I guess
that leaves only me!

133
00:08:15,424 --> 00:08:19,426
What's it take
to make you angry?

134
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:53,310
Others will come.

135
00:08:53,312 --> 00:08:55,396
They won't be happy
we killed their men.

136
00:08:55,398 --> 00:08:58,849
All the more reason
to figure out why they're here.

137
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,905
It's a map.

138
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:08,809
Of the island chain,
containing Lian Yu.

139
00:09:08,811 --> 00:09:12,196
This is similar to the recon shots
that A.S.I.S. gave me

140
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:14,748
before I came here
to rescue your father.

141
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:20,504
Whatever they're looking for,
it must be here, on this island.

142
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,993
I've seen men in war
with that look in their eyes.

143
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:28,679
What look?

144
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:32,182
The one that says
he's split into someone else.

145
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:36,053
Someone
he doesn't even recognize.

146
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:39,940
If someone doesn't
talk to him, it'll tear him up.

147
00:09:52,704 --> 00:09:54,738
Come on.

148
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,074
Let's get away
from this place.

149
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,167
They survived the quake
and ended up here.

150
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:09,219
From one hell
to the next.

151
00:10:09,221 --> 00:10:12,673
Yeah, whoever's stealing from here,
they won't be for much longer.

152
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,394
This city is failing
on all accounts.

153
00:10:17,396 --> 00:10:19,680
Who's that in the spotlight?

154
00:10:19,682 --> 00:10:23,267
Sebastian Blood, the local alderman
that I told you about.

155
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:25,886
Not too shy about
sharing his opinions.

156
00:10:25,888 --> 00:10:27,220
Which are?

157
00:10:27,222 --> 00:10:29,389
Which are that the Glades
have been abandoned.

158
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:31,892
And no one gives a damn
about these people.

159
00:10:31,894 --> 00:10:33,327
He hasn't met us yet.

160
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:35,245
We cannot stand by
while the doctors

161
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:37,498
on the other side
of those doors are working with

162
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,899
the bare minimum
of resources

163
00:10:38,901 --> 00:10:39,950
because the police
department

164
00:10:39,952 --> 00:10:41,401
already sees us
as a lost cause.

165
00:10:41,403 --> 00:10:44,455
Meanwhile, thieves are seeking to
make a quick buck

166
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:47,291
off the misery
of the Glades.

167
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:50,928
Oliver Queen,
isn't it?

168
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,180
Alderman.

169
00:10:53,182 --> 00:10:56,884
What brings you to Glades Memorial,
Mr. Queen?

170
00:10:56,886 --> 00:10:58,719
I assume someone
of your means

171
00:10:58,721 --> 00:11:00,771
can afford the best
medical treatment money can buy.

172
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:03,190
And I can assure you,
you're not going to find that here.

173
00:11:03,192 --> 00:11:05,192
That's wrong, sir.

174
00:11:05,194 --> 00:11:07,311
The people of the Glades have
suffered too much

175
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:10,263
not to have access to basic
medical services.

176
00:11:10,265 --> 00:11:12,366
Well, that's very
compassionate of you to say.

177
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:14,160
Although I wonder

178
00:11:14,185 --> 00:11:16,121
where your family's concern
for its fellow citizens was

179
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:17,988
when they ordered
the construction

180
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,290
of the earthquake machine
that killed 503 people.

181
00:11:22,444 --> 00:11:24,161
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen, please!

182
00:11:24,163 --> 00:11:25,996
I will be doing
everything in my power

183
00:11:25,998 --> 00:11:28,465
to atone for my family's
culpability in this tragedy.

184
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:30,918
Well, I'm sure the people of
the Glades that I represent

185
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,469
will sleep better
knowing that--

186
00:11:32,471 --> 00:11:34,421
if they still had
a place to sleep.

187
00:11:34,423 --> 00:11:36,924
If their homes
hadn't crumbled around them.

188
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:40,227
If their stores and their businesses
hadn't been condemned.

189
00:11:40,229 --> 00:11:41,345
You did this to us!

190
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:43,013
Go back to your mansion,
rich boy!

191
00:11:43,015 --> 00:11:45,816
Spare us your mercy
visits, Queen!

192
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:48,185
You've done enough
for this city already.

193
00:11:48,187 --> 00:11:49,469
Excuse us.
Pardon us.

194
00:12:03,574 --> 00:12:07,574

196
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:14,803
I quit.

197
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:16,671
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

198
00:12:16,673 --> 00:12:18,356
Not my old job in
the I.T. Department,

199
00:12:18,358 --> 00:12:20,642
but my new job
as your executive assistant,

200
00:12:20,644 --> 00:12:22,510
which you think
I'm going to accept.

201
00:12:22,512 --> 00:12:25,480
Your thinking could not be
more wrong in this matter.

202
00:12:25,482 --> 00:12:27,782
I need a girl Wednesday.
It's...Friday,

203
00:12:27,784 --> 00:12:30,285
and the answer is no!

204
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:34,072
These computers
have been upgraded.

205
00:12:34,074 --> 00:12:37,659
Far more processing power
than your typical secretary.

206
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:39,661
Did you know
I went to M.I.T.?

207
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:41,413
Guess what
I majored in. Hint--

208
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:42,864
not the secretarial arts.

209
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:44,132
Felicity!

210
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:46,167
We all need to have
secret identities now.

211
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:48,720
If I'm going to be
Oliver Queen CEO,

212
00:12:48,722 --> 00:12:51,506
then I can't very well
travel down 18 floors

213
00:12:51,508 --> 00:12:54,092
every time you and I need to discuss
how we spend our nights.

214
00:12:54,094 --> 00:12:56,544
And I love spending
the night with you.

215
00:12:56,546 --> 00:12:59,014
3, 2, 1.

216
00:12:59,016 --> 00:13:01,149
I worked very hard
to get where I am,

217
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:03,401
and it wasn't
so I could fetch you coffee!

218
00:13:03,403 --> 00:13:05,437
Well, it could be worse...

219
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:08,773
My secret identity
is his black driver.

220
00:13:10,076 --> 00:13:11,943
Right now...

221
00:13:11,945 --> 00:13:13,728
I need you to figure out
how the hijackers

222
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,727
are getting a line

223
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,958
on the goods earmarked
for Glades Memorial.

224
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:20,068
If we know how
they're picking their targets...

225
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,588
We will know when
and where to stop them.

226
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,041
Fine.

227
00:13:26,043 --> 00:13:27,792
Oh!

228
00:13:27,794 --> 00:13:29,678
May I get you
a cup of coffee?

229
00:13:31,632 --> 00:13:33,965
You're not actually offering to get me
a cup of coffee, are you?

230
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:35,717
Yeah, no.

231
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:38,753
That won't be
happening. Ever!

232
00:13:38,755 --> 00:13:40,388
Well, if you can
bring yourself to do it,

233
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,557
can you please make reservations
for Dig, Carly and I

234
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,759
Saturday night at Table Salt?

235
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:46,861
Sure!

236
00:13:46,863 --> 00:13:49,864
I'll get right on that.
Using the Internet,

237
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:53,068
which you also happen
to have access to.

238
00:13:54,871 --> 00:13:56,571
Still haven't told him?

239
00:13:56,573 --> 00:13:58,606
He has enough
on his plate.

240
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:05,964
Last year when Oliver Queen
returned to Starling City,

241
00:14:05,966 --> 00:14:08,116
he was met with flowers
and well-wishes.

242
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,385
However, today down
at Glades Memorial,

243
00:14:10,387 --> 00:14:12,854
he was met with a far less
cordial homecoming.

244
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:16,124
The question is no longer,
where have you been, Oliver Queen.

245
00:14:16,126 --> 00:14:18,793
Now it's, but what
have you done for me lately?

246
00:14:18,795 --> 00:14:21,229
Mr. Queen was not
available for comment.

247
00:14:31,073 --> 00:14:34,659
You saved my life.

248
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:38,997
That's what I keep
telling myself.

249
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:42,917
That I killed that guy because
he was going to kill you.

250
00:14:45,037 --> 00:14:47,706
But what if that's
not the reason?

251
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:52,493
I just feel like
this island is...

252
00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:56,715
It's turning me into
something terrible.

253
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,029
No island, no place

254
00:15:11,031 --> 00:15:13,615
can make you
something you're not.

255
00:15:13,617 --> 00:15:17,118
So I've always
been a killer?

256
00:15:20,372 --> 00:15:24,709
Everyone has a demon
inside of them.

257
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:28,546
The "dao de jing" recognizes

258
00:15:28,548 --> 00:15:30,548
the yin and the yang.

259
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:34,502
Opposing forces
inside all of us.

260
00:15:34,504 --> 00:15:37,538
The darkness.

261
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,141
And the light.

262
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:43,728
The killer...

263
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,181
and the hero.

264
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:13,108
Never thought I'd say this,
but I'm actually

265
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,076
getting more done
down in the basement

266
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:16,761
of an abandoned steel factory
than in the corner office of a high rise.

267
00:16:16,763 --> 00:16:18,546
What do you have?

268
00:16:18,548 --> 00:16:20,932
FEMA is shipping 100,000 units
of medical grade opiates

269
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:22,851
to Glades Memorial.
When?

270
00:16:22,853 --> 00:16:25,553
Truck is scheduled to leave
the FEMA depot in 20 minutes.

271
00:16:25,555 --> 00:16:27,138
Not if this motorcycle gang
has anything to say about it.

272
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,973
Bad luck for them.

273
00:16:28,975 --> 00:16:31,226
I have something
to say about it.

274
00:16:50,913 --> 00:16:54,082
No, no, no, please,
please, don't shoot.

275
00:16:54,084 --> 00:16:56,450
Down!

276
00:16:59,555 --> 00:17:00,955
Make your delivery!

277
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,631
Emerald archer.

278
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:12,767
I feared you had
perished in the quake,

279
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:15,937
denying me the opportunity
to pay you back in full

280
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:18,690
for your past interference
in my business.

281
00:17:18,692 --> 00:17:21,910
Your business is going under--
permanently!

282
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,948
I don't think my friend
agrees with you.

283
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,534
Our new partnership
was easily cemented.

284
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:31,152
See, I was eager
to see you dead,

285
00:17:31,154 --> 00:17:33,922
and he was eager
to kill you.

286
00:17:39,545 --> 00:17:41,829
No kill shots?

287
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:43,598
I was promised a fight.

288
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,300
I hope you haven't
lost your nerve.

289
00:17:45,302 --> 00:17:46,968
Find out.

290
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:09,073
Starling City police!
You're surrounded.

291
00:18:09,075 --> 00:18:11,326
Put down your weapons
or we will open fire.

292
00:18:28,844 --> 00:18:30,878
Cease fire, cease fire!

293
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,381
Find them.

294
00:18:55,655 --> 00:18:58,090
Does it hurt?

295
00:18:58,092 --> 00:19:00,342
Not as much as some things.

296
00:19:00,344 --> 00:19:01,794
I love that we live in
a city where the police

297
00:19:01,796 --> 00:19:03,012
are more interested
in catching you

298
00:19:03,014 --> 00:19:05,264
than the drug-stealing
mobsters.

299
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:07,499
Our tax dollars at work.

300
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:09,768
The authorities have always
gone after the Vigilante.

301
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,021
This time was different.

302
00:19:12,023 --> 00:19:14,339
Why, because this
time it's Laurel leading the charge?

303
00:19:14,341 --> 00:19:17,192
Because they got in my way.

304
00:19:17,194 --> 00:19:21,113
I can't make things better
as Oliver Queen,

305
00:19:21,115 --> 00:19:23,348
and now I can't make things
better as the Vigilante.

306
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:26,018
So what if Laurel's involved?

307
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,821
Hey! Go easy on him.
It's all right, Felicity.

308
00:19:27,822 --> 00:19:28,783
No, it's not.

309
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:30,290
You don't get to
jump down his throat

310
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,241
just because you happen to be
having a lousy week.

311
00:19:32,243 --> 00:19:34,877
Ok, you're pissed
he invoked the almighty Laurel.

312
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:36,578
Well, you're not
the only one whose love life

313
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,080
is taking it on the chin!
Felicity...

314
00:19:38,082 --> 00:19:40,716
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about,

315
00:19:40,718 --> 00:19:42,001
you keep
bringing up Carly

316
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:43,886
but you're so involved
with yourself

317
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:46,368
that you don't even realize the
look he gets every time you do.

318
00:19:47,223 --> 00:19:49,975
What is she talking about?

319
00:19:49,977 --> 00:19:51,827
Me and Carly
pulling the pin.

320
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:54,780
It happened when
you were gone.

321
00:19:54,782 --> 00:19:56,732
Truth is, it's been happening
for a while now.

322
00:19:56,734 --> 00:19:59,601
Being the Vigilante's
wingman was a strain.

323
00:19:59,603 --> 00:20:02,888
He needs to hear this.

324
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,991
This wasn't just about
what we were doing, Oliver.

325
00:20:05,993 --> 00:20:08,744
This isn't
just about you, man.

326
00:20:08,746 --> 00:20:13,082
I couldn't separate what's going
on with me and Carly, and...

327
00:20:13,084 --> 00:20:15,150
What went on
with my brother.

328
00:20:15,152 --> 00:20:16,735
Deadshot.

329
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:18,737
He's still out there.

330
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:22,240
My brother's killer.
Still breathing.

331
00:20:22,242 --> 00:20:24,176
And I, uh,

332
00:20:24,178 --> 00:20:25,878
guess I couldn't
hate him

333
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,263
and love her
at the same time.

334
00:20:29,716 --> 00:20:31,216
See?

335
00:20:31,218 --> 00:20:34,636
You are not
the only one

336
00:20:34,638 --> 00:20:37,556
having trouble reconciling two
sides of himself.

337
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:00,946
Great crowd tonight.

338
00:21:00,948 --> 00:21:02,157
Now that we're closed,

339
00:21:02,182 --> 00:21:04,023
are you going to be
starting your second shift?

340
00:21:04,668 --> 00:21:06,284
Suicide by Chinese
street thugs.

341
00:21:06,286 --> 00:21:09,004
Do you really want
to talk about this again?

342
00:21:09,006 --> 00:21:10,722
We never finished
talking about it.

343
00:21:10,724 --> 00:21:14,026
I wanted Laurel
to arrest you.

344
00:21:16,129 --> 00:21:18,586
You know,

345
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,611
you're not the first
girlfriend to say that to me.

346
00:21:21,068 --> 00:21:23,602
She said I couldn't
change you,

347
00:21:23,604 --> 00:21:25,571
so I'm not going
to try to.

348
00:21:29,993 --> 00:21:32,661
What, so you're giving me
money and a rock?

349
00:21:32,663 --> 00:21:34,329
The check is two weeks'
severance from the club.

350
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:36,648
Just because
I can't change you

351
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,667
doesn't mean I have to let you
be in my life

352
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:40,953
until you get
yourself killed.

353
00:21:43,174 --> 00:21:45,674
And my brother gave me that when
he came back from the dead.

354
00:21:45,676 --> 00:21:48,760
He said it was a hozen,

355
00:21:48,762 --> 00:21:52,831
some Buddhist thing that
symbolizes reconnecting.

356
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,000
If you want
to reconnect with me,

357
00:21:55,002 --> 00:21:58,720
keep the hozen
and tear up that check.

358
00:21:58,722 --> 00:22:00,222
I don't do too well
with ultimatums.

359
00:22:00,224 --> 00:22:02,941
And I don't do
all that great

360
00:22:02,943 --> 00:22:05,144
with people I love
getting hurt.

361
00:22:05,146 --> 00:22:07,312
And worse.

362
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:18,096
Your 4:00 is here.

363
00:22:18,098 --> 00:22:19,664
Although I'm not
entirely sure

364
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:21,500
why you invited him
up to your office.

365
00:22:21,502 --> 00:22:23,335
'Cause I need to fix
this situation,

366
00:22:23,337 --> 00:22:24,970
and there are no
cameras or people

367
00:22:24,972 --> 00:22:26,972
to throw things
at me in here.

368
00:22:26,974 --> 00:22:29,674
Alderman.
Thank you for coming.

369
00:22:29,676 --> 00:22:31,393
Mr. Queen.

370
00:22:31,395 --> 00:22:33,529
This is some view.

371
00:22:33,531 --> 00:22:36,681
How small the rest
of us must all look from up here.

372
00:22:36,683 --> 00:22:38,650
Ms. Smoak.
Yes?

373
00:22:38,652 --> 00:22:41,236
Would you get my guest
and I some coffee?

374
00:22:41,238 --> 00:22:42,687
You know, I would, Mr. Queen,

375
00:22:42,689 --> 00:22:45,524
but it seems that someone's
broken our coffeemaker.

376
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:49,027
Violently.

377
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:51,296
I was surprised
that you wanted to meet.

378
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:53,916
As surprised as I was

379
00:22:53,918 --> 00:22:56,201
when you turned
a frenzied mob on me?

380
00:22:56,203 --> 00:22:58,387
Oh, that shouldn't have
been too surprising.

381
00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:01,723
My constituents have
a lot of anger towards your family.

382
00:23:01,725 --> 00:23:03,258
They have a right to.

383
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,511
My mother was involved
in something...

384
00:23:05,513 --> 00:23:07,479
Unspeakable.

385
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:09,598
But I'm my own man.

386
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,984
And I'm not your enemy.

387
00:23:11,986 --> 00:23:14,019
You're not a friend.

388
00:23:14,021 --> 00:23:16,071
To me, or the people
of the Glades.

389
00:23:16,073 --> 00:23:20,659
I am hoping to prove otherwise.

390
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:22,361
Mr. Queen.

391
00:23:22,363 --> 00:23:25,063
Not every problem
can be solved by money.

392
00:23:25,065 --> 00:23:28,033
Real change
will never happen

393
00:23:28,035 --> 00:23:30,118
until your elitist
friends realize

394
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,503
that it is morally
unacceptable

395
00:23:31,505 --> 00:23:33,405
to allow thousands
of its fellow citizens

396
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:35,674
to live right down
the street but in a third world.

397
00:23:35,676 --> 00:23:39,278
Then let's show them.
I'll host a benefit.

398
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,463
Invite some
of my "elitist friends,"

399
00:23:41,465 --> 00:23:44,466
and then you and I can help them
see what needs to be done.

400
00:23:46,603 --> 00:23:49,354
People seeing you...

401
00:23:49,356 --> 00:23:51,189
Seeing you stand up,

402
00:23:51,191 --> 00:23:54,643
the CEO of Queen
Consolidated,

403
00:23:54,645 --> 00:23:58,797
taking responsibility and
being this cause's public face.

404
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:04,653
That would
make a difference.

405
00:24:07,574 --> 00:24:09,708
Then let's make a difference.

406
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,547
Listen.

407
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:19,468
I am truly sorry for what happened
outside that hospital.

408
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,838
Sometimes my emotions
get the better of me.

409
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,964
I don't even know how
long it's been since I laughed.

410
00:24:49,415 --> 00:24:51,650
Hey, kid.

411
00:24:51,652 --> 00:24:53,085
Shado.

412
00:24:53,087 --> 00:24:56,254
Yeah, just, um...

413
00:24:56,256 --> 00:24:59,491
We were just
washing off.

414
00:25:01,177 --> 00:25:03,261
Well, you better prepare
to get dirty again.

415
00:25:03,263 --> 00:25:06,131
I think I figured out
where those men were headed.

416
00:25:06,133 --> 00:25:08,166
It's a couple of clicks
northwest of here.

417
00:25:09,936 --> 00:25:11,836
Well, let's go.

418
00:25:15,892 --> 00:25:17,859
Be careful.

419
00:25:17,861 --> 00:25:20,312
Don't fall too hard.
Why not?

420
00:25:20,314 --> 00:25:23,532
To make sure there isn't part of
this island that doesn't totally suck?

421
00:25:23,534 --> 00:25:25,951
To survive.

422
00:25:25,953 --> 00:25:28,904
She's a distraction,
and in a place like this,

423
00:25:28,906 --> 00:25:30,956
a distraction's going
to cloud your judgment.

424
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:34,192
And that is what's going
to get you killed.

425
00:25:34,194 --> 00:25:38,080
Look at what this island has
already done to you, kid.

426
00:25:52,562 --> 00:25:55,397
Hello, Laurel.

427
00:25:56,716 --> 00:25:58,684
This seems like
old times.

428
00:25:58,686 --> 00:26:01,553
I figured we should talk.

429
00:26:01,555 --> 00:26:03,321
Fine.

430
00:26:03,323 --> 00:26:06,074
Turn that thing off
and pull back your hood.

431
00:26:06,076 --> 00:26:07,559
I'm not your enemy.

432
00:26:07,561 --> 00:26:09,611
And I thought we understood
each other.

433
00:26:09,613 --> 00:26:11,513
I understand that
you're a criminal.

434
00:26:11,515 --> 00:26:13,465
And you think the law
doesn't apply to you-- it does.

435
00:26:13,467 --> 00:26:16,017
But you didn't always
feel that way.

436
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:19,621
You used to think that I was helping
the people in this city.

437
00:26:19,623 --> 00:26:22,924
And then I saw you.

438
00:26:22,926 --> 00:26:25,210
I don't understand.

439
00:26:25,212 --> 00:26:26,628
The night
of the earthquake.

440
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,030
I saw you at CNRI.

441
00:26:29,032 --> 00:26:32,934
My friend was
inside the building

442
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:35,053
when it collapsed.

443
00:26:35,055 --> 00:26:37,939
He went there
to rescue me.

444
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:41,193
And by the time I managed
to climb inside, he was gone.

445
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:45,247
But I saw you.

446
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:49,034
Running away
into the night.

447
00:26:49,036 --> 00:26:51,653
You didn't save him.

448
00:26:58,194 --> 00:27:00,495
You were too busy...

449
00:27:00,497 --> 00:27:03,582
Fighting a meaningless duel
with Malcolm Merlyn.

450
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:05,617
And when people--

451
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:09,671
people you told me you would
protect needed your help...

452
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:15,510
You weren't there.

453
00:27:17,146 --> 00:27:21,149
I don't think you wear
that hood because you're a hero.

454
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:24,319
I think you wear it
to hide that you're a coward,

455
00:27:24,321 --> 00:27:27,489
and I promise you,
I will see you unmasked,

456
00:27:27,491 --> 00:27:31,076
prosecuted
and sent to prison.

457
00:27:31,078 --> 00:27:33,695
Don't ever speak
to me again.

458
00:28:02,396 --> 00:28:05,198
You look like a woman
who's looking for someone.

459
00:28:07,251 --> 00:28:10,420
Friend of mine.
He's throwing this benefit.

460
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:12,438
Ah. Oliver Queen.

461
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,088
Didn't realize
you were friends.

462
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:15,678
Very old friends.

463
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,400
So you can imagine how I feel
about you putting him in the crosshairs

464
00:28:19,514 --> 00:28:21,898
of public opinion,
alderman.

465
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:24,650
For what it's worth,
I've apologized to Oliver

466
00:28:24,652 --> 00:28:26,235
for my rhetorical excesses.

467
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:28,204
In fact, it is that détente

468
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,873
which brings us
all here tonight.

469
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,125
So where is Oliver?

470
00:28:33,127 --> 00:28:36,862
That's exactly the question
I'm asking myself.

471
00:28:38,915 --> 00:28:41,550
We're late.

472
00:28:41,552 --> 00:28:44,086
The good news is,  at least you
get to make a dramatic entrance.

473
00:28:44,088 --> 00:28:46,272
Oh, I'm just lucky
Oliver Queen

474
00:28:46,274 --> 00:28:49,175
has a reputation for not
showing up on time.

475
00:28:49,177 --> 00:28:50,643
You know, I've been
meaning to tell you

476
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,244
it really
weirds me out to no end

477
00:28:52,246 --> 00:28:54,713
the way you refer to yourself
in the third person like that.

478
00:28:57,351 --> 00:29:00,186
It's Felicity.

479
00:29:01,905 --> 00:29:03,322
Tell me.

480
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,724
I've got
good news and bad news.

481
00:29:05,726 --> 00:29:07,059
I hacked into FEMA's server,

482
00:29:07,061 --> 00:29:08,944
yet another federal offense,
thank you very much,

483
00:29:08,946 --> 00:29:10,913
and was able to find out
when the next shipment

484
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,114
of pharmaceuticals
is taking place.

485
00:29:12,116 --> 00:29:14,533
When?
That's the bad news.

486
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:16,568
Five minutes ago.

487
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:20,122
I know this is the definition
of sucky timing,

488
00:29:20,124 --> 00:29:23,242
but...which suit are you

489
00:29:23,244 --> 00:29:25,844
planning on wearing tonight?

490
00:29:27,047 --> 00:29:29,965
Doesn't seem Mr. Queen
is going to honor us

491
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:33,102
with his presence
this evening.

492
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,771
So where are you going?

493
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:38,057
To address his guests.

494
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:41,644
It's time they realize
what kind of a man their host is.

495
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:44,063
You're just going to crucify him
in the media again?

496
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:48,934
Crucifixion has such...
A bad reputation.

497
00:29:48,936 --> 00:29:51,603
The Romans used it
to punish people

498
00:29:51,605 --> 00:29:54,323
who acted against
the public good.

499
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:57,209
Alderman...

500
00:29:57,211 --> 00:29:59,878
Ladies and gentlemen.

501
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,664
Thank you.

502
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:05,551
Thank you. But you should hold
your applause for Oliver Queen.

503
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,253
This evening's charity
was his brain child.

504
00:30:08,255 --> 00:30:11,123
As such,

505
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:12,975
you could be forgiven
for wondering why

506
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:16,628
Mr. Queen isn't
with us tonight.

507
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,231
And the answer, I'm afraid,

508
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:22,301
is painfully apparent.

509
00:30:22,303 --> 00:30:24,303
He doesn't care.

510
00:30:24,305 --> 00:30:26,989
I told Mr. Queen
that this city's

511
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:30,142
problems cannot be
solved with his money;

512
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,643
that he needed
to stand up

513
00:30:31,645 --> 00:30:33,696
and be counted
as someone who cares.

514
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,581
So where is he now?
Lieutenant!

515
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,667
We got a Hood sighting,
heading down Lemire Avenue.

516
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:40,169
Let's go!

517
00:30:42,672 --> 00:30:46,158
I don't know where
Oliver Queen is.

518
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,095
All I know is that
he isn't here.

519
00:30:50,097 --> 00:30:53,182
This city is dying.

520
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,850
And it needs
someone to stand up

521
00:30:54,852 --> 00:30:56,368
and breathe
new hope into it.

522
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:59,355
And tonight, it is
painfully obvious

523
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,441
that that person
is not Oliver Queen.

524
00:31:22,996 --> 00:31:25,214
Go!

525
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,500
I told you.
On time to die.

526
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,038
This doesn't make any sense.

527
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,375
This is supposed to be
live surveillance.

528
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:53,377
What the hell is this
building doing here?

529
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:55,129
It was destroyed
in the quake.

530
00:31:55,131 --> 00:31:59,083
Who in the hell could be feeding
us year-old surveillance?

531
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,317
Healthcare has enough problems
without you punks.

532
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:31,565
You're not the only one
allowed to bring a friend!

533
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:42,843
I'm clear.

534
00:32:46,915 --> 00:32:50,100
That makes one of us.

535
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:21,081
China!

536
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:30,507
Aaah!

537
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:44,137
Ahh.

538
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:55,866
Go ahead,
waste your arrows.

539
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:58,118
Aah!

540
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,421
That hurt,
but it won't stop me.

541
00:34:06,094 --> 00:34:09,046
That will.

542
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:11,882
Dig?

543
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,268
Diggle!

544
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,913
You've changed.

545
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,551
You would have killed me
by now if you hadn't.

546
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:50,537
The police can take the shipment
the rest of the way.

547
00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:54,842
They still won't see you as anything
more than the enemy.

548
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:02,766
You'll never be anything
but a criminal to them.

549
00:35:04,051 --> 00:35:06,720
Which means
you'll never be a hero.

550
00:35:06,722 --> 00:35:09,573
As long as
this city is safe,

551
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:11,942
it doesn't matter.

552
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:14,845
Those sirens
aren't for you.

553
00:35:20,403 --> 00:35:21,987
After
a prolonged pursuit,

554
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:23,906
police have arrested
Chien Na Wei,

555
00:35:23,908 --> 00:35:26,692
a high-ranking member
of the local Chinese Triad,

556
00:35:26,694 --> 00:35:29,044
which was responsible
for the recent hijackings

557
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:31,630
of pharmaceuticals
bound for Glades Memorial.

558
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:34,616
Representatives praise
the efforts of the SCPD

559
00:35:34,618 --> 00:35:37,336
in saving the hospital
from shutting down,

560
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:41,423
though some sources say the
Vigilante may have been involved.

561
00:35:41,425 --> 00:35:43,692
In other news,
protests continue in...

562
00:35:43,694 --> 00:35:45,594
I was just about to
make my move on her.

563
00:35:45,596 --> 00:35:48,430
I didn't need one of your trick arrows
getting in the way.

564
00:35:48,432 --> 00:35:50,566
Couldn't risk it.

565
00:35:50,568 --> 00:35:53,068
Where would I be
without my black driver?

566
00:35:54,604 --> 00:35:56,889
Diggle!

567
00:35:56,891 --> 00:36:00,742
I'm sorry
about you and Carly.

568
00:36:02,512 --> 00:36:05,030
Yeah, well,
couples break up.

569
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:08,066
Not everything that
happens in Starling City

570
00:36:08,068 --> 00:36:09,668
is your responsibility.

571
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,503
I'm learning that.

572
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:12,955
What I meant was,

573
00:36:12,957 --> 00:36:14,923
I'm sorry that
I wasn't there for you,

574
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:16,842
because I should
have been.

575
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:18,911
I got wrapped up
in my own suffering,

576
00:36:18,913 --> 00:36:22,381
and I...forgot that
some other people

577
00:36:22,383 --> 00:36:24,249
might be
suffering, too.

578
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:30,439
You know, we're getting
dangerously close to hug territory,

579
00:36:30,441 --> 00:36:33,041
so I'm going to fall back.
You need a ride?

580
00:36:33,043 --> 00:36:36,562
It turns that being CEO,
I actually have

581
00:36:36,564 --> 00:36:37,996
some work to do.

582
00:36:37,998 --> 00:36:39,865
I'll find my own way.

583
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:43,635
You always do.

584
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:51,877
Oliver Queen's
failure to show up to his own benefit

585
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:53,879
shouldn't surprise anyone.

586
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:57,316
He's no different than the rest of
the Starling City elite

587
00:36:57,318 --> 00:36:59,668
who have failed to show up when
it comes to ending the suffering

588
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,371
of those left devastated
in the Glades.

589
00:37:02,373 --> 00:37:05,057
Oliver Queen is not a friend

590
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:07,025
to the people of this city.

591
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:38,924
To those men, this location
could have been

592
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:40,926
on any one of 150
different islands.

593
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:44,796
But for somebody who knows
this island like he knows his own name...

594
00:37:44,798 --> 00:37:46,848
So those men were
looking for this place.

595
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,767
Why?

596
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:51,553
- That would be the question.
- Slade.

597
00:37:51,555 --> 00:37:53,972
Over here.

598
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:31,476
What happened to these people?

599
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:37,882
Whatever did happen to them
was over 60 years ago.

600
00:38:37,884 --> 00:38:42,604
These soldiers belong
to the Japanese Imperial Army.

601
00:38:42,606 --> 00:38:45,824
They've been here
since World War II.

602
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,661
We're missing
something here.

603
00:38:49,663 --> 00:38:52,614
You don't just
come here for corpses.

604
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,444
I've been looking for you.

605
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:24,895
You need to stop.

606
00:39:24,897 --> 00:39:27,448
You saved my life!

607
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:30,284
Made me realize it...

608
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:32,403
wasn't much of a life.

609
00:39:32,405 --> 00:39:35,906
But I could do
what others couldn't,

610
00:39:35,908 --> 00:39:39,276
or too afraid to do.

611
00:39:39,278 --> 00:39:41,712
I could help you
save the city.

612
00:39:41,714 --> 00:39:43,047
You're untrained.
I can fight.

613
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:45,466
You can take a beating.

614
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:46,917
There's a difference.

615
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:49,086
Then teach me!

616
00:39:49,088 --> 00:39:51,589
Let me help you.

617
00:39:51,591 --> 00:39:53,557
Ok.

618
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,059
You can help me.

619
00:39:55,061 --> 00:39:59,346
But not by taking on
the Triad or the cops.

620
00:39:59,348 --> 00:40:01,015
Then how?

621
00:40:01,017 --> 00:40:03,017
To do what I do,
I need intel.

622
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:06,821
You can be my eyes
and ears in the Glades.

623
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:09,356
That's how you
can save the city.

624
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:11,192
How do I contact you?

625
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:17,498
Leave that
in the alley wall.

626
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,617
Then I'll know
to contact you.

627
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:27,291
Are you sure it's all right
that I keep this?

628
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:40,054
If I want to be with you,
do I keep that or give it back?

629
00:40:40,056 --> 00:40:41,939
You were a little unclear.

630
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:45,476
You mean it?
No more fighting.

631
00:40:45,478 --> 00:40:47,511
If it's a choice
between life with you

632
00:40:47,513 --> 00:40:49,346
or life without you,

633
00:40:49,348 --> 00:40:52,733
life with you will win
every single time.

634
00:40:52,735 --> 00:40:55,953
I'm done trying
to be a hero.

635
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,926
I told you
to stay away from me.

636
00:41:18,928 --> 00:41:21,812
I thought you might have
changed your mind

637
00:41:21,814 --> 00:41:24,548
after I stopped the men
terrorizing our city.

638
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:27,518
This isn't your city.
It's your killing fields.

639
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,570
The copycats are still alive.

640
00:41:29,572 --> 00:41:31,121
Tommy Merlyn isn't.

641
00:41:31,123 --> 00:41:34,558
I lost a friend that day, too.

642
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,895
And I would gladly

643
00:41:37,897 --> 00:41:40,614
have given my life for his.

644
00:41:40,616 --> 00:41:42,950
Well, don't worry,
your life is over.

645
00:41:42,952 --> 00:41:45,870
Your life as a free man.

646
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:55,596
I told you to stay away.

647
00:41:55,598 --> 00:41:58,632
Somehow I knew
you wouldn't listen.

648
