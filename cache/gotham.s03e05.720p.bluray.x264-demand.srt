(MUSIC PLAYING)

479
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,415
My beautiful Oswald.

480
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,925
Heard you took down
the Red Hood Gang single-handed.

481
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,102
- So to speak.
- Very funny.

482
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,104
Don't forget. You owe me.

483
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,862
(SIGHS) I know.

484
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,944
(CAMERAS CLICKING)

485
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:26,692
How long do we have to stay?

486
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,661
As long as it takes for you
to be seen in the world, Master Bruce.

487
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,661
Being Bruce Wayne. And smiling.

488
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,750
So this is our life now?
Fake smiles and mingling.

489
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,547
I miss the old days.

490
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,922
So do I.

491
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,308
- It's so nice.
- Oh, excuse me.

492
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,312
Bruce, Mr. Pennyworth,
I'm so pleased you made it.

493
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,192
Yeah, well, you know, we're trying
to get out a bit more, Mr. Mayor.

494
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:00,560
Oh. Oswald, please.

495
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,851
We never got the chance to thank you
for saving our lives from the ex-Mayor.

496
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,649
- (CHUCKLES) That was nothing.
- ALFRED: Not at all.

497
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:10,035
I found it very fortuitous you turned up
when you did with that bazooka.

498
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,747
I just felt a bit sorry for Stan,
the gardener,

499
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:16,705
'cause he was picking up bits of Galavan
for weeks.

500
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,204
(CHUCKLES)

501
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,086
And now here you are, the new mayor.

502
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,171
Sometimes life has a way of working out.

503
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,677
Yes, that's true.

504
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,263
What is it, Master Bruce?

505
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,764
A sign.

506
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:37,729
Please excuse me.

507
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,344
ALFRED: All right, well,
I'll just go and wet my beak.

508
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,690
Congratulations again, Mr. Mayor.

509
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,275
(MUSIC PLAYING)

510
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,033
- Hey!
- Hey yourself.

511
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:58,371
Funny, I never realized how short you are.

512
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,082
Who the hell are you?

513
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,459
Not yet.

514
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,713
This is too fun. Run along, little kitty.

515
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:08,969
Go steal some more wallets.

516
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,713
Hey.

517
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:15,092
So sweet.

518
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,309
There he is, the man of the hour.
I have a surprise for you, Butch.

519
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,688
Not in the mood.

520
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,145
What's in the box?

521
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,608
Open it.

522
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,235
(EXHALES)

523
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,326
Thanks, already got one.

524
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,035
Oh, of course you do.

525
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,290
And you certainly wouldn't need this one,

526
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,577
as it's so similar
to your very own pocket square.

527
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,416
This is from the Red Hood crime scene.

528
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,298
It turns out that your suit
and the Red Hood suits

529
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,584
were all made
by the same tailor, Mr. Fuji.

530
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,760
That's some coincidence.

531
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,763
I thought so myself,
which is why I called Mr. Fuji.

532
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,762
And he said that a large man
with a metal hand,

533
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,281
not many of those running around,
bought all six of the suits.

534
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:01,226
Which means, ta-da,
you're the architect of the Red Hood...

535
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:06,644
- (GRUNTS)
- I should snap your neck right now.

536
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,278
(CHOKING)

537
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,439
You haven't heard my offer.

538
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:14,986
(EXHALES)

539
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:17,947
We kill Penguin together.

540
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,281
(CHUCKLES)

541
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,042
What are you talking about?
You're his guy.

542
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,646
Oh, please.
You fell for that act?

543
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,413
Yes, he broke me out of Arkham.
Very appreciative.

544
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,709
But I was not cut out to be number two.
I've simply been waiting for my moment.

545
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,798
Which you have graciously provided.

546
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:36,891
How would you like to run Gotham with me?

547
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,723
(LAUGHS)

548
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,480
The two of us? Working together?

549
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,920
You have proven yourself far more cunning
than I imagined.

550
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,944
Now, I assume this little drama of yours
was meant to climax tonight.

551
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:53,733
So, put on the hood, kill Penguin.

552
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:57,369
I'll help you escape.
Tomorrow, we divide up the city.

553
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,663
You'd really turn on him?
After all he did for you?

554
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,667
- Mr. P.
- In a heartbeat.

555
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:14,886
No.

556
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:16,847
Okay.

557
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:19,717
Then I guess it's time
for surprise number two.

558
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,356
You got to Zsasz?

559
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:27,732
I got to Zsasz.

560
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,066
And he got to Tabitha.

561
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,689
Penguin 's history.

562
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:37,322
Question is, are you?

563
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,833
Can I see your invitation?

564
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,758
- (SIGHS) What are you doing here?
- I was invited.

565
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,672
Of course you were.

566
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,973
You recognize her?

567
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,266
Should I?

568
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,059
I don't know.

569
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,147
Hey. Are you, you?

570
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,311
I'm me.

571
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,569
Uh-huh. (CHUCKLES)

572
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,148
Well, I'm working, so...

573
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,989
Actually, there was something
I wanted to tell you.

574
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,574
Could we go somewhere more private?

575
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,824
Fine. But make it quick.

576
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,926
Can't believe you'd turn on Oswald, too.

577
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,553
Uh, hello. Pot-kettle-black.

578
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:40,385
No. It's not the same thing. You...

579
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:42,799
Never mind.

580
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,348
I swear, your goons hurt Tabitha,
so help me...

581
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,310
Just do your job.

582
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,267
- (APPLAUSE)
- Huh.

583
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,185
Showtime.

584
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:57,565
Put one in the Mayor
before I put one in Tabitha.

585
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,448
Ladies, gentlemen.

586
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:04,784
Welcome to The Sirens.

587
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:09,876
Tonight we're here to celebrate
the honorable Mayor Cobblepot.

588
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:14,506
Our savior from the monsters,
and the captain of our fair city.

589
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,592
And now, the Mayor would like to say
a few words.

590
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,778
Ed, where've you been?
I've been looking for you all evening.

591
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,341
Oh, just tying up loose ends.
I just wanted to say

592
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:26,676
good luck.

593
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,762

Okay. Thank you.

Tonight is a celebration,
not of my victory,

00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,200
but of Gotham's.

597

I wouldn't celebrate yet, Mr. Mayor.

600
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,837
Red Hoods ain't finished yet.

601
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,343
- (GASPS) Ed! What are you doing?
- Wait!

602
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:05,674
Sorry, boss.

00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,975

The Mayor, our mayor,

vowed that all of the Red Hoods
would be destroyed.

611
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,952
And now we have the real leader caught.

Red-handed.

I'd give you real bullets?

00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,084
You are an idiot.

(CROWD EXCLAIMING)

I will kill you for this!

Sounds like we're missing all the fun.

Got plenty of fun left for you.

take a girl hostage in her own place,

you might wanna search it first.

I gave you a job!

I gave you everything!

I am shocked, and grieved,

that one of my dearest friends
has betrayed me.
