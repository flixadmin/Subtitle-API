1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,084
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,087 --> 00:00:02,758
- And you want my help.
- Yeah. I never thought this day

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,127
would come either, but here we are.

4
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:06,187
- Time to go, inmate.
- Where are you taking me?

5
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,781
You're going back to Level One.

6
00:00:07,784 --> 00:00:09,714
- Where did you get this?
- Felicity.

7
00:00:09,717 --> 00:00:11,773
She's the one who sent us to Star City.

8
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:13,793
I'm so sorry to be the
one to tell you this,

9
00:00:13,796 --> 00:00:15,794
but Felicity Smoak is dead.

10
00:00:15,796 --> 00:00:18,663
Just making good on an old promise.

11
00:00:18,665 --> 00:00:21,914
Isn't that right, Anatoly?

12
00:00:32,246 --> 00:00:34,746
You, uh...

13
00:00:34,748 --> 00:00:37,749
You remember the last
time we saw each other?

14
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:41,753
You killed my brothers, all of them.

15
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:46,958
Let me, um... let me jog your memory.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,127
You betrayed me...

17
00:00:53,607 --> 00:00:56,308
After I trusted you...

18
00:00:59,272 --> 00:01:01,293
I gave you my friendship.

19
00:01:01,296 --> 00:01:05,677
Man like you has no friends.

20
00:01:07,014 --> 00:01:09,514
Where are your friends now?

21
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:13,551
Huh?

22
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:17,155
Oliver Queen!

23
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:20,358
No!

24
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,160
The Arrow Team...

25
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:27,465
They're all gone, brother.

26
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:37,008
You picked the losing side.

27
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,511
What are you waiting for?

28
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:41,746
Kill me!

29
00:01:44,751 --> 00:01:48,353
Not yet. I got a little job for you.

30
00:01:49,523 --> 00:01:51,823
You're gonna help me

31
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:55,260
destroy Oliver Queen.

32
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:05,945

33
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:11,270
I thought that mind control
stuff only happened in movies.

34
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:13,745
It wasn't exactly mind control.

35
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:16,715
This place seems like
it's gotten a lot worse.

36
00:02:16,717 --> 00:02:19,310
They came in after
you stabbed that guard.

37
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:21,036
These guys are professional jerks.

38
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:24,456
Less yard time, cell
checks every half-hour.

39
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,057
Have they been rough on you?

40
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:28,493
Me? No way.

41
00:02:28,495 --> 00:02:30,795
I'm glad they're here.

42
00:02:30,797 --> 00:02:33,339
Brick's been pissed ever since
you shut down his fight club,

43
00:02:33,342 --> 00:02:35,075
and I'm the only one
he can take it out on.

44
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:38,069
If they weren't here,
he'd have come after me.

45
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:41,873
You totally saved me.
Typical Green Arrow move.

46
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:51,849
Pick it up.

47
00:02:51,852 --> 00:02:55,086
I thought Dunbar was on Brick's payroll.

48
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:58,022
Not anymore. Ever since
that fight club fiasco,

49
00:02:58,024 --> 00:02:59,606
Dunbar's got a slap on the wrist.

50
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:02,961
Now he treats Brick like, well, you.

51
00:03:02,963 --> 00:03:04,896
On your feet, 4587.

52
00:03:04,898 --> 00:03:07,098
- Speaking of.
- Time to go.

53
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,176
Have my meal privileges been revoked?

54
00:03:09,179 --> 00:03:12,670
I said, let's go, inmate.

55
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:15,807
- Err.
- I'm not telling you again.

56
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:22,265
That's what I thought.

57
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,500
You have a visitor.

58
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,183
I thought I didn't have any visitation.

59
00:03:25,185 --> 00:03:26,951
Well, it must be your lucky day.

60
00:03:43,437 --> 00:03:44,570
What do you want?

61
00:03:44,573 --> 00:03:46,703
Try sounding a little
bit more grateful, Ollie.

62
00:03:46,706 --> 00:03:48,506
I had to file an emergency motion

63
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:50,074
just to get in here to see you,

64
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:52,110
and it's a good thing
that I did because you

65
00:03:52,112 --> 00:03:54,128
look like crap.

66
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:55,887
Just need to document...

67
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,309
- Hey.
- Your injuries really fast.

68
00:03:58,312 --> 00:03:59,593
What are you doing?

69
00:03:59,596 --> 00:04:01,257
We got the Level Two psych records

70
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,321
from wherever or whoever you
had sneak them out of Slabside.

71
00:04:04,324 --> 00:04:06,122
How did you do that, by the way? No, no.

72
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,292
Never mind. Don't tell me.

73
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:09,127
It's better for your
case if I don't know.

74
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,695
What do you mean, my case?

75
00:04:10,697 --> 00:04:12,754
- Your case.
- What... what are you working

76
00:04:12,757 --> 00:04:14,299
with Jean Loring?

77
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:18,703
No. I'm working with your wife.

78
00:04:18,705 --> 00:04:23,007
Felicity would have told me
if she was working with you,

79
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:26,177
and the only reason that
you would ever help me

80
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:30,468
or anyone is if there was
something in it for you.

81
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,617
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

82
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:36,653
You're the reason that Diaz
got away in the first place.

83
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:38,890
Do you remember?

84
00:04:38,892 --> 00:04:42,193
You know, the Ollie I knew,

85
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:47,298
he had a hard time taking
responsibility for his failures, too.

86
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,934
You know what's amazing?

87
00:04:51,872 --> 00:04:55,006
You're nothing like her.

88
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:59,210
So go ahead and pretend to be Laurel,

89
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:02,046
my Laurel, for as long as you want.

90
00:05:02,048 --> 00:05:06,784
You never will be, ever.

91
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:09,454
Stay away from my wife.

92
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:25,203
I can't believe she's dead.

93
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,773
Here.

94
00:05:30,544 --> 00:05:32,377
I don't really drink.

95
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:34,445
Well, I do.

96
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:38,416
So what happened?

97
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:39,929
How did she die?

98
00:05:39,932 --> 00:05:41,819
It was a couple weeks ago,

99
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:43,321
give or take.

100
00:05:43,323 --> 00:05:45,256
She was murdered.

101
00:05:45,258 --> 00:05:46,976
Murdered?

102
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,460
Who would hurt Felicity?

103
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:50,594
Roy, the Felicity you
knew was very different

104
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:52,664
than what she became.

105
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,666
We wanted her to join us,

106
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:56,100
but she cut ties.

107
00:05:56,102 --> 00:05:57,523
Instead, she went underground.

108
00:05:57,526 --> 00:05:59,648
She started calling
herself the calculator.

109
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,106
- Like her father?
- She ran in some

110
00:06:01,109 --> 00:06:02,250
dangerous circles.

111
00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:03,771
You walk that path long enough,

112
00:06:03,774 --> 00:06:05,840
sooner or later, it catches up to you.

113
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,281
I'm sorry, William.

114
00:06:10,283 --> 00:06:13,084
However Felicity died,

115
00:06:13,086 --> 00:06:16,087
whatever the circumstances,

116
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:18,856
she still sent me this signal,

117
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:20,358
and I need to know why.

118
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,461
You don't owe her anything, William.

119
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:25,863
Yeah? Well, maybe she owed me.

120
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,100
Okay. I noticed this earlier.

121
00:06:29,102 --> 00:06:31,102
You see the color variation?

122
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:33,171
I think Felicity was
trying to lead us there.

123
00:06:33,173 --> 00:06:36,441
This is kind of crazy.
You know that, right?

124
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:38,543
All I know is I've come this far.

125
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:40,812
I'm not stopping now.

126
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,859
Has the Silencer's flight
touched down from Moscow yet?

127
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:55,795
An hour ago in Star City
just like we thought.

128
00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:58,129
My facial recognition algorithm
indicates she hasn't had a rendezvous

129
00:06:58,131 --> 00:07:00,965
yet with Diaz, but I did get an update

130
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:03,034
on why Diaz sent the Silencer to Russia.

131
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:04,567
Anatoly Knyazev?

132
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,984
I can't get specific confirmation,

133
00:07:05,987 --> 00:07:07,353
but the rumor on the dark web is

134
00:07:07,356 --> 00:07:08,937
that the entire Bratva was massacred

135
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,841
two nights ago in Moscow,

136
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:13,578
which doesn't bode well
for our frenemy Anatoly.

137
00:07:15,582 --> 00:07:17,582
How'd things go with Oliver? Is he okay?

138
00:07:17,585 --> 00:07:20,080
He's fine. He hates me,
he thinks I'm a monster,

139
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,903
and he doesn't want
my help, but he's fine.

140
00:07:21,906 --> 00:07:25,052
Oh. Okay. Listen. I mean, prison's
obviously been rough on Oliver.

141
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:26,725
I mean, that's the whole
point of prison. Duh!

142
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:29,044
But he doesn't know the new you.

143
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:33,924
I mean, he just knows the old,
scarier, murdery version of you.

144
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:35,636
I don't really care
what Oliver thinks of me,

145
00:07:35,638 --> 00:07:37,402
but he doesn't want me representing him,

146
00:07:37,404 --> 00:07:40,106
and I don't know how quickly you're
gonna find substitute counsel.

147
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:42,106
No way. We are not changing
our strategy, not now.

148
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:44,208
Oliver's constitutional
rights were violated.

149
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:46,675
A prosecutor stepping over to the
opposite side of the line to defend him

150
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:48,346
is the best leverage that we have.

151
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,183
I just got a hit.

152
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:54,052
Diaz and the 3 Longbow
Hunters were spotted

153
00:07:54,054 --> 00:07:55,853
outside a munitions plant in Orchid Bay.

154
00:07:55,855 --> 00:07:59,090
He's probably looking
for some kind of weapon.

155
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:01,959
Too bad he's not gonna
live long enough to get it.

156
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:04,729
We have to move before
they change locations.

157
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:11,969
Why do bad guys always
pick the creepiest places?

158
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:14,484
Oh, wait. Was that a serious question?

159
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:15,946
Well, I mean, you used to
be a bad guy... Well, gal,

160
00:08:15,948 --> 00:08:16,974
so I figured you'd know.

161
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:19,839
This doesn't look like
official D.A. business.

162
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:21,878
Did we have to invite him?

163
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:24,482
- Are you two, like, friends now?
- It's a long story,

164
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:26,940
but the punch line is that the
Silencer and Diaz are inside,

165
00:08:26,943 --> 00:08:29,113
which means we're finally gonna
get a chance to bring them down.

166
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:31,555
And you know this how? Oh, wait.

167
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:33,210
Let me guess. Long story.

168
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,593
Can we just leave it at that?

169
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:38,596
- So are you in?
- You really got to ask?

170
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:43,000
Where the hell is she?

171
00:08:43,003 --> 00:08:44,361
According to my tracker,

172
00:08:44,363 --> 00:08:46,403
she's... she's in there.

173
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:16,070
- Bomb!
- Go, go, move, move,

174
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:17,301
move, move, move!

175
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:35,103
A.R.G.U.S. has been
tracking Diaz ever since

176
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:36,772
he slaughtered the Bratva in Russia.

177
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:39,670
The SCPD was responding to
a munitions plant break-in,

178
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:40,939
so please tell me, Felicity,

179
00:09:40,942 --> 00:09:43,606
how the hell do you end up
in the middle of my op again?

180
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:45,740
Why don't I just say
exponential search algorithm,

181
00:09:45,743 --> 00:09:47,244
and we'll just leave it at that?

182
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:50,115
We planted a tracker
on the Silencer's belt.

183
00:09:50,118 --> 00:09:51,670
Obviously, Diaz must have found it

184
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:53,795
and is using it as bait against us.

185
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:57,173
How did you manage that? You were
nowhere near the Silencer at the CDC.

186
00:09:57,176 --> 00:09:59,388
That thing at the CDC was you guys?

187
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:02,859
Uh, Felicity wasn't near her. I was.

188
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:04,695
We snuck her out together.

189
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,694
So you two captured the Silencer?

190
00:10:06,697 --> 00:10:08,256
But Felicity and Laurel were the ones

191
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:09,267
that tortured her.

192
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,954
Actually, I convinced her
not to. You're welcome.

193
00:10:11,957 --> 00:10:13,239
So now you're working with Laurel?

194
00:10:13,241 --> 00:10:15,151
- I'm standing right here.
- To be fair, she did help

195
00:10:15,153 --> 00:10:17,764
shut down that illegal
psychiatric program at Slabside.

196
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,476
Wait. Hold on a sec.
You're gonna give me

197
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:21,445
crap about working with
the new Green Arrow,

198
00:10:21,447 --> 00:10:23,690
and meanwhile, you're siding
with the Black Frickin' Siren?

199
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:25,334
Again, still here.

200
00:10:25,337 --> 00:10:26,869
You're working with the new Green Arrow?

201
00:10:26,871 --> 00:10:29,228
Guys, I think that
the whole point of this

202
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:32,147
is that maybe we could all pick
up our phones a little more, huh,

203
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,423
shoot a text.

204
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,225
Yeah. I am totally
talking about the fact

205
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:37,251
that everyone forgot
my birthday last week.

206
00:10:37,254 --> 00:10:38,954
Your party is next week. Act surprised!

207
00:10:38,957 --> 00:10:41,303
Okay. Now that all of our
deep, dark secrets are out,

208
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:43,648
do you think that we could switch
our focus back to the psycho

209
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,189
who just tried to blow us up?

210
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:46,692
Sounds like good idea.

211
00:10:46,695 --> 00:10:47,790
First, ground rules.

212
00:10:47,793 --> 00:10:49,150
No new Green Arrow.

213
00:10:49,153 --> 00:10:52,475
Secondly, no one who
isn't from this Earth.

214
00:10:52,478 --> 00:10:54,048
You're kicking me out?

215
00:10:54,051 --> 00:10:55,962
Well, you are the D.A.

216
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:57,493
You could have been exposed tonight,

217
00:10:57,496 --> 00:10:59,682
and I think there's no
need to risk that again.

218
00:10:59,685 --> 00:11:03,287
So an international
mob boss gets to stay

219
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,188
and I have to leave, is that it?

220
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:09,259
Huh! Unbelievable.

221
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:10,727
Laurel, wait.

222
00:11:10,729 --> 00:11:12,399
Laurel, please wait.

223
00:11:12,402 --> 00:11:14,974
It looks like you and your husband
don't need my help after all.

224
00:11:14,977 --> 00:11:17,332
He does, we do, I do,
but, more importantly,

225
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:19,169
I need the D.A. to help Oliver.

226
00:11:19,172 --> 00:11:21,313
Well, I was happy to help
your little charity case

227
00:11:21,316 --> 00:11:24,654
when I had some downtime, but
now that Diaz is back in, I don't.

228
00:11:24,657 --> 00:11:26,810
Laurel, Laurel, please!

229
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,812
If I could trade places with you

230
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,815
so that you could go get Diaz, I would,

231
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:34,417
but this is my only chance
to get Oliver out of prison.

232
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:36,579
This is it! This...

233
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,258
This is my only chance
to get my husband back.

234
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,494
Laurel, please.

235
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:47,898
You know, sometimes, I
really hate being your Laurel.

236
00:11:49,635 --> 00:11:54,424
I promise you that when we
catch Diaz, I will call you

237
00:11:54,427 --> 00:11:56,966
and we will finish this
just like we planned.

238
00:11:56,969 --> 00:11:58,608
Fine.

239
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,914
We're close. Should be just up here.

240
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,279
All these years, and you're
still that boy who hates

241
00:12:06,282 --> 00:12:07,851
not knowing stuff.

242
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,120
Are you still that girl who
loves getting into trouble?

243
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:12,856
You know it.

244
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:15,571
It's good seeing you.

245
00:12:15,574 --> 00:12:19,115
I tried to keep in
touch after everything.

246
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:23,099
Yeah, I know. Guess it was just easier

247
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:25,202
for me to move on than
to hold on, you know?

248
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:28,038
Wish I could do the same sometimes.

249
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,373
I cannot believe that
they're full-grown adults.

250
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:32,542
Which means we're old.

251
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,377
I never thought I'd see you again.

252
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,880
This is the last place I
ever thought I'd come back to.

253
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,782
I wanted William to leave me on Lian Yu.

254
00:12:38,784 --> 00:12:41,151
How did he convince you?

255
00:12:41,153 --> 00:12:44,621
I found a message
inside of Oliver's bow,

256
00:12:44,623 --> 00:12:46,323
the mark of four.

257
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:48,779
That's impossible. Who
could've put it there?

258
00:12:48,782 --> 00:12:51,494
I don't know, but I think it's best

259
00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:53,063
that we keep this between us.

260
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:55,265
None of us have seen William for years.

261
00:12:55,268 --> 00:12:56,701
You sure we can trust him?

262
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:58,301
He's Oliver's son.

263
00:12:58,303 --> 00:13:00,403
That is exactly what worries me.

264
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,572
Hey. According to the map, it's only

265
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,674
a few hundred more feet this way.

266
00:13:21,793 --> 00:13:24,185
- Let's go, inmate.
- What? Where?

267
00:13:24,188 --> 00:13:26,930
Oh, you're going to
the hole permanently.

268
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,118
Hey. What's going on?

269
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:30,232
Officer Dunbar was killed last night,

270
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:32,560
and this little bastard was
the last one seen with him.

271
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:34,857
What?! I didn't kill
anybody. It wasn't me!

272
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,039
Wait. How do you know it was him?

273
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,880
Oliver, it wasn't me, I swear!

274
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:40,543
It must have been brick! He set me up!

275
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:43,713
Oliver! Oliver!

276
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,117
Look who just got out of the loony bin.

277
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:49,266
You learn any life lessons in there?

278
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:51,854
Maybe those doctors helped
get your head on straight.

279
00:13:51,857 --> 00:13:54,324
Tell me what you know
about Dunbar's murder.

280
00:13:54,326 --> 00:13:56,393
Sounds like you're
accusing us of something.

281
00:13:56,395 --> 00:13:59,029
I heard the poor chap
got stabbed 8 times.

282
00:13:59,031 --> 00:14:00,530
Messy way to go.

283
00:14:00,532 --> 00:14:02,332
You and he had a falling out, Brick.

284
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:04,567
Maybe we did, and maybe we didn't.

285
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:07,493
Maybe an innocent man is rotting
in the hole in your place.

286
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:10,474
There are no innocent men in
here, Queen. You should know that.

287
00:14:10,477 --> 00:14:13,747
Brick, Stanley didn't kill that guard.

288
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,841
Well, I guess he's got
nothing to worry about.

289
00:14:15,844 --> 00:14:17,747
The truth will set him free.

290
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:22,018
Go ahead.

291
00:14:22,021 --> 00:14:24,722
Then you can join your
friend in the hole.

292
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:29,592
Hey, Brick.

293
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:32,362
If you or anyone in your crew

294
00:14:32,364 --> 00:14:37,711
had something to do
with this, I'll find out.

295
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,406
Come on.

296
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:47,919
Meet Pyotr Roslov...

297
00:14:47,922 --> 00:14:52,091
Former KGB, lots of deep, scary
ties to the Russian military.

298
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:53,501
Oh. He looks like a real charmer.

299
00:14:53,504 --> 00:14:57,019
Hmm. He is not. Pyotr and
I were associates at KGB,

300
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,789
but we had a disagreement.

301
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:01,958
Then why did Diaz have you call him?

302
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,828
Diaz wants to buy some kind of
very powerful weapon from him.

303
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,888
He wants to destroy Oliver Queen

304
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:09,460
by destroying what he loves, his city.

305
00:15:09,463 --> 00:15:11,396
That's why Diaz was trying to steal

306
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,702
the directed energy weapon.

307
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,352
And whatever was at the CDC.

308
00:15:14,355 --> 00:15:17,162
We find out where Diaz plans to
launch his attack, we snag him there,

309
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:19,776
we find out what Roslov sold him,

310
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:21,678
and you're gonna help us.

311
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,037
No, no, no. No. Pyotr can smell a rat.

312
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,396
Anatoly, we will help you.

313
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,283
I play hero once before,

314
00:15:27,285 --> 00:15:30,458
and Diaz killed all of
my brothers as punishment.

315
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:32,489
- Never again.
- Oliver was your brother, too,

316
00:15:32,491 --> 00:15:34,716
and he would want you
to help us get Diaz.

317
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:36,893
Yeah, but Oliver tried
to do the same thing.

318
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:40,107
Look where he is now. No. Time for
me to go somewhere nice, tropical.

319
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,443
Maldives maybe.

320
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:43,066
I think it's really hard to travel

321
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,335
when you're on homeland
security's most wanted list.

322
00:15:45,337 --> 00:15:47,837
Yes, but I am on no such...

323
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:52,997
You are threatening me?

324
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,763
Call it an enthusiastic suggestion.

325
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:57,188
A couple minutes in Roslov's office,

326
00:15:57,191 --> 00:15:58,891
you download his hard drive,

327
00:15:58,894 --> 00:16:00,427
you're on your way to the Maldives.

328
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,886
You're not Felicity Smoak I remember.

329
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:05,221
Well, she couldn't catch Diaz.

330
00:16:05,223 --> 00:16:07,257
Maybe this one can.

331
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,977
I got a visual.

332
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:27,313
_

333
00:16:30,715 --> 00:16:33,485
Anatoly Knyazev.

334
00:16:33,488 --> 00:16:35,149
_

335
00:16:35,152 --> 00:16:39,172
_

336
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:45,170
_

337
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:49,110
_

338
00:16:49,113 --> 00:16:50,235
He's in.

339
00:16:50,238 --> 00:16:53,201
I suppose I owe you a debt of gratitude

340
00:16:53,204 --> 00:16:55,672
for sending the Dragon my way, Knyazev.

341
00:16:55,674 --> 00:16:59,909
Oh. I'm pleased your dealings
with Mr. Diaz were, uh, profitable.

342
00:16:59,911 --> 00:17:03,146
Oh. Yes. Very profitable.

343
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:07,750
Speaking of, you need 4K TV, sarin gas?

344
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:11,888
All fall off truck, I swear.

345
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,657
Anatoly, you need to
get to that computer.

346
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,701
Eh, Pyotr, why don't we sit down

347
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,762
like old friends?

348
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:24,300
Good. Now distract him
and insert the drive.

349
00:17:26,258 --> 00:17:27,904
Something wrong?

350
00:17:27,907 --> 00:17:30,773
I... I was promised drink.

351
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,616
Um, on rocks... Please.

352
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:47,824
Good.

353
00:17:49,494 --> 00:17:52,693
He's got incoming.
Anatoly's been compromised.

354
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,008
We have to get him out of there.

355
00:17:54,011 --> 00:17:56,147
The drive still needs a minute
before he can retrieve the data.

356
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:57,867
Felicity, he doesn't have a minute.

357
00:17:57,869 --> 00:17:59,733
Anatoly, there is no immediate threat.

358
00:17:59,735 --> 00:18:01,004
Keep him talking.

359
00:18:01,006 --> 00:18:03,339
Forgive me, Pyotr.

360
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:05,308
Felicity!

361
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,943
Losing Bratva was very painful.

362
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:12,638
The pain taught me to see all
the pain that I have inflicted.

363
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:17,187
I'm hoping that you can see
it in your heart to forgive me.

364
00:18:20,258 --> 00:18:23,326
A snake may shed its skin,

365
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:26,251
but it is still a snake.

366
00:18:38,877 --> 00:18:40,476
Go!

367
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:03,852
Anatoly.

368
00:19:03,855 --> 00:19:06,402
God. Yes. We got it.

369
00:19:06,404 --> 00:19:08,438
Damn it.

370
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:13,292
Hey. How's Anatoly?

371
00:19:13,295 --> 00:19:14,695
He'll be out cold for a few hours,

372
00:19:14,697 --> 00:19:15,717
but he'll be fine.

373
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,236
- Good.
- Felicity, it wouldn't have been

374
00:19:17,238 --> 00:19:18,624
if I showed up a few seconds later.

375
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:20,256
But he is fine, and we got this.

376
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,967
It's encrypted and probably in Cyrillic,

377
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,312
so it's gonna take me a while to decode,

378
00:19:23,314 --> 00:19:25,868
but it is a huge lead
on what Diaz is planning.

379
00:19:25,871 --> 00:19:27,740
And this would have been
worth Anatoly's life?

380
00:19:27,743 --> 00:19:28,976
Well, think about how
many lives we're gonna lose

381
00:19:28,978 --> 00:19:31,078
if we don't stop Diaz.

382
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,880
We all have to take
risks in the field, Dig.

383
00:19:32,882 --> 00:19:34,915
That's true, but this was a risk

384
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:36,850
that you coerced him
into taking, Felicity.

385
00:19:36,852 --> 00:19:39,819
I'm sorry that he got hurt, I am,

386
00:19:39,822 --> 00:19:43,256
but we got intel on Diaz
because I didn't give up.

387
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:46,126
Give up? Felicity, I didn't give up.

388
00:19:46,128 --> 00:19:48,262
You pushed me out. You
wanted to do things your way,

389
00:19:48,264 --> 00:19:49,678
and I supported that decision,

390
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:51,007
but that was before I knew your decision

391
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:52,397
involved risking innocent lives.

392
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,225
Anatoly is hardly a girl scout,

393
00:19:54,228 --> 00:19:58,366
and don't lecture me, especially
because you haven't been around.

394
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:01,575
I am willing to do whatever
it takes to end this.

395
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:03,744
But then what?

396
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:05,946
Felicity, I've known
you for a long time,

397
00:20:05,948 --> 00:20:07,748
and you are a good person,

398
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,316
but I've been to the front lines,

399
00:20:09,318 --> 00:20:11,351
and I know exactly what
that does to people.

400
00:20:11,353 --> 00:20:14,588
I just hope when this war is over,

401
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,124
you still come out a hero.

402
00:20:36,712 --> 00:20:40,280
Hey. You okay?

403
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:44,384
The guards, they took turns hitting me.

404
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:46,220
They think I killed their friend.

405
00:20:46,222 --> 00:20:47,921
Stanley, did they say why?

406
00:20:47,923 --> 00:20:51,725
They haven't even
found the murder weapon.

407
00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:54,113
Dunbar's a jerk, but
I would never hurt him.

408
00:20:54,116 --> 00:20:56,263
I would never hurt anyone.

409
00:20:56,265 --> 00:20:58,702
Oliver, if they pin this on me,

410
00:20:58,705 --> 00:21:00,366
I'm gonna be in here forever.

411
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:02,819
Hey. I'm not gonna let that happen.

412
00:21:02,822 --> 00:21:05,174
I heard that it happened in the shower.

413
00:21:05,177 --> 00:21:07,144
- Okay.
- But that doesn't even

414
00:21:07,147 --> 00:21:10,744
make sense because I wasn't even
close to there when that guy...

415
00:21:10,746 --> 00:21:14,648
I know if anyone can find
out what really happened,

416
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,884
it's the Green Arrow.

417
00:21:16,886 --> 00:21:18,519
Just sit tight, okay?

418
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:20,220
Okay.

419
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:12,072
Of course.

420
00:22:14,743 --> 00:22:17,544
I'm sure you're wondering
what a state D.A.

421
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:19,319
is doing here in federal court,

422
00:22:19,322 --> 00:22:21,902
representing someone on the
opposite side of the law.

423
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:24,886
I am. This is highly unusual.

424
00:22:24,889 --> 00:22:28,014
I'm here as an Officer of the court.

425
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:36,729
This... is Oliver
Queen's current condition.

426
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:39,499
He has been psychologically tortured,

427
00:22:39,501 --> 00:22:42,236
harassed, and assaulted.

428
00:22:42,238 --> 00:22:45,105
Upon information and
belief, Mr. Queen also had

429
00:22:45,107 --> 00:22:47,092
the opportunity to escape Slabside

430
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:50,777
but instead smuggled information
out to help his fellow inmates.

431
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:54,114
And you feel these things
should negate his conviction?

432
00:22:54,116 --> 00:22:56,725
Yes. Oliver Queen made
a deal with the FBI

433
00:22:56,728 --> 00:22:59,752
to protect his city, but the FBI failed

434
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:01,455
to hold up their end of the bargain.

435
00:23:01,457 --> 00:23:04,524
Meanwhile, Diaz has continued to commit

436
00:23:04,526 --> 00:23:07,050
numerous other crimes
and nearly succeeded

437
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,529
in murdering Mr. Queen's wife and child

438
00:23:09,531 --> 00:23:11,644
while they were in
federal witness protection.

439
00:23:11,647 --> 00:23:13,585
Anything further, Ms. Lance?

440
00:23:13,588 --> 00:23:18,771
Your honor, the hardest
thing to do is to be a hero

441
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:21,141
when no one expects you to be.

442
00:23:21,143 --> 00:23:23,491
The easier path is to be a criminal.

443
00:23:23,494 --> 00:23:27,146
The past 6 months,
Oliver Queen has chosen

444
00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:30,784
the hard road and has been a
hero in terrible conditions,

445
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:34,354
and since the FBI has not
held up their end of the deal,

446
00:23:34,356 --> 00:23:37,524
Oliver Queen deserves to be a free man.

447
00:23:37,526 --> 00:23:40,160
I agree that a federal investigation

448
00:23:40,162 --> 00:23:43,764
into the conditions of
Slabside should be ordered.

449
00:23:43,766 --> 00:23:47,801
However, I'm unconvinced that Mr.
Queen should be released at this time.

450
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:50,050
Therefore, his conviction stands.

451
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,805
Your appeal is denied.

452
00:23:55,544 --> 00:23:57,010
Got your message. Are you in?

453
00:23:57,012 --> 00:23:58,133
Felicity had the brilliant idea

454
00:23:58,135 --> 00:24:00,179
to use a Cyrillic dictionary
attack on the table

455
00:24:00,182 --> 00:24:02,475
- of hashed passwords.
- It was pretty brilliant of me.

456
00:24:02,478 --> 00:24:05,151
Our friend Roslov, on the
other hand, less brilliant.

457
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:06,996
His decryption key is
the Russian equivalent

458
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:08,241
of "password69."

459
00:24:08,244 --> 00:24:09,312
Once we translated all the data,

460
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:10,747
this is what we got.

461
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,569
Say hello to Betab-500.

462
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:15,474
Yeah. That's a top-of-the-line
aerial explosive,

463
00:24:15,476 --> 00:24:16,913
razor-thin precision,

464
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,975
able to cut through
concrete like nothing.

465
00:24:18,978 --> 00:24:20,413
Well, Diaz has two of them,

466
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,414
so that means our list of
potential targets just doubled.

467
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:23,588
Keep working on that hard drive.

468
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,156
What are you gonna do?

469
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:27,026
Prepare for a mass evac of Star City.

470
00:24:33,756 --> 00:24:35,506
Why'd you do it, Turner?

471
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:37,108
What the hell are you talking about?

472
00:24:37,111 --> 00:24:38,444
Why'd you kill Dunbar?

473
00:24:38,447 --> 00:24:39,795
I didn't kill that guard.

474
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:41,551
Your blade says you did.

475
00:24:45,533 --> 00:24:47,466
Guards found prints on it.

476
00:24:47,469 --> 00:24:50,003
Turner, you're going to the hole,

477
00:24:50,006 --> 00:24:52,205
and this time, you're never coming out.

478
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:57,010
You did this? W-wait.
You got the wrong guy.

479
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:13,584
Hey. I heard you were up.

480
00:25:13,587 --> 00:25:14,994
How are you feeling?

481
00:25:14,997 --> 00:25:16,863
Heart pounding in head.

482
00:25:16,865 --> 00:25:20,412
Each beat... pow... Like knife to brain.

483
00:25:20,415 --> 00:25:25,351
I'm sorry. I should have
gotten you out sooner.

484
00:25:25,354 --> 00:25:28,874
So you are not new
Felicity Smoak after all.

485
00:25:28,877 --> 00:25:31,678
What do you mean?

486
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,780
You want to be ruthless

487
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,518
to pursue madman,

488
00:25:35,521 --> 00:25:37,084
I'll not judge you.

489
00:25:37,086 --> 00:25:39,686
I am, after all, wanted criminal.

490
00:25:39,688 --> 00:25:42,674
I actually thought you'd be more
pissed I almost got you killed.

491
00:25:42,677 --> 00:25:44,291
Of course I'm angry.

492
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,993
You threaten my life,

493
00:25:45,995 --> 00:25:48,729
but I don't like apologies.

494
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:51,932
You cannot take away
mistake by wishing it so.

495
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:54,701
In my line of work, you make choice,

496
00:25:54,703 --> 00:25:56,670
you do not look back.

497
00:25:56,672 --> 00:26:01,908
Ah. So you don't regret working
against us with Diaz last year?

498
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:08,749
Regret, guilt. These are
demons you choose to live with,

499
00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:11,551
a trade you make to get what you want.

500
00:26:11,553 --> 00:26:14,112
How bad do you want
to kill Ricardo Diaz?

501
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:15,555
More than anything.

502
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:19,126
Well, then you embrace demons.

503
00:26:19,128 --> 00:26:21,928
No more half measures.

504
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,432
When I work with Oliver in Russia,

505
00:26:25,434 --> 00:26:27,434
he was not villain,

506
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:30,937
but he did what needed to be done.

507
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:33,774
You remind me of him then.

508
00:26:35,676 --> 00:26:39,979
What would that Oliver
have done in this situation?

509
00:26:39,982 --> 00:26:42,716
He would have ended Diaz,

510
00:26:42,718 --> 00:26:45,452
and he wouldn't care about the cost.

511
00:26:58,757 --> 00:27:01,424
Hey! Laurel, you look a little upset.

512
00:27:01,427 --> 00:27:02,776
Why don't we go cool off?

513
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:04,037
Get out of my way.

514
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,154
It seems like you were
about to open your mouth

515
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,909
and do something you're
going to regret, counselor.

516
00:27:08,912 --> 00:27:10,276
I'm not an attorney,

517
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:12,831
as you've reminded me many times.

518
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:14,823
You sure looked like one
in that courtroom today.

519
00:27:14,826 --> 00:27:16,883
Yeah. Well, it doesn't matter, does it?

520
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,952
Oliver's not getting out of prison.

521
00:27:18,954 --> 00:27:20,554
Now, if you don't mind, I have

522
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,818
some unfinished
business with that judge.

523
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:25,325
Did you even bother to
listen to yourself in court?

524
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:27,394
You spoke from your heart.

525
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,673
Big surprise, by the
way, you do have one.

526
00:27:29,676 --> 00:27:31,776
You said, "the hardest
thing to do was to be a hero

527
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:33,633
when no one expects you to be.

528
00:27:33,635 --> 00:27:35,969
The easier path is to be a criminal."

529
00:27:35,971 --> 00:27:37,871
What do you care, anyway?

530
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:41,341
If anybody knows the
true me, the real me,

531
00:27:41,343 --> 00:27:43,084
it's you.

532
00:27:43,087 --> 00:27:45,596
You know, you've been telling
people for 6 months now

533
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:46,913
you've changed.

534
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,015
It wasn't until I saw
you in that courtroom

535
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:51,785
that I actually believed it.

536
00:27:51,787 --> 00:27:56,356
Do not throw that away just
because it's getting hard now.

537
00:27:56,358 --> 00:28:00,607
I don't want you coming to one of
my court appearances ever again.

538
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:13,073
This has to be where
Felicity was hiding out.

539
00:28:13,075 --> 00:28:15,242
Yeah, but doing what?

540
00:28:15,244 --> 00:28:17,077
Uh, guys.

541
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:19,513
You have triggered security protocols.

542
00:28:19,515 --> 00:28:22,048
If you do not provide access credentials

543
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,251
in 30 seconds,

544
00:28:24,253 --> 00:28:26,286
you will be terminated.

545
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,557
All our weapons were targeted.

546
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,779
Please say you can hack this.

547
00:28:31,782 --> 00:28:33,526
Hack Felicity? Yeah, right!

548
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:35,177
Denied.

549
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,323
She wouldn't lead us
here without access.

550
00:28:37,326 --> 00:28:38,629
What are those?

551
00:28:42,591 --> 00:28:43,917
20 seconds.

552
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,872
No freakin' way.

553
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:47,440
Get the bow.

554
00:28:50,712 --> 00:28:53,113
Remember how my dad used to train?

555
00:29:05,985 --> 00:29:08,427
Access granted.

556
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:11,998
You'd think Felicity would
have made that a lot easier.

557
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,807
She's obviously trying
to protect something.

558
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:17,270
I'll bring up the last
files she accessed.

559
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:19,939
These are structural maps

560
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:21,942
of all the buildings
throughout Star City.

561
00:29:21,944 --> 00:29:23,843
City Hall, Central Library,

562
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,412
Old Rockets Arena...

563
00:29:25,414 --> 00:29:26,980
All areas outside The Glades.

564
00:29:26,982 --> 00:29:28,949
Yeah. Along with schematics
to build explosives

565
00:29:28,951 --> 00:29:30,951
and the money to fund it.

566
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:39,926
This is a plan to
level all of Star City.

567
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:45,599
What you got?

568
00:29:45,602 --> 00:29:48,849
Anatoly said in order to catch Diaz,
I couldn't worry about the cost.

569
00:29:48,852 --> 00:29:50,386
Felicity, you know
how I feel about this.

570
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:51,288
I know, and that's not the point.

571
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,401
The point is that Diaz
does worry about the cost.

572
00:29:53,404 --> 00:29:55,138
I mean, it's basically his whole M.O.

573
00:29:55,141 --> 00:29:56,552
Diaz wants to make a statement.

574
00:29:56,555 --> 00:29:58,474
The man carries around a flamethrower.

575
00:29:58,477 --> 00:29:59,881
Subtlety isn't his strong suit.

576
00:29:59,884 --> 00:30:02,194
So I started wondering, what is
a statement worthy of a Dragon?

577
00:30:02,196 --> 00:30:03,756
I ran an algorithm cross-referencing

578
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:06,785
the Betab-500 and the
manufacturer's specification.

579
00:30:06,788 --> 00:30:09,331
Turns out that this
model is a new version,

580
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:10,756
where you can attach it to a pipe.

581
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:13,860
For instance, a pipe
underground filled with gas.

582
00:30:13,863 --> 00:30:15,661
- Gas plant.
- Mm-hmm.

583
00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:17,330
That building's totally fireproof.

584
00:30:17,332 --> 00:30:18,565
Rest of the city, not so much.

585
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,130
If Diaz sets off those bombs,

586
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:21,766
a whole river of gas underneath the city

587
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:23,702
goes up in flames literally.

588
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:25,940
Okay. A.R.G.U.S. will continue the evac.

589
00:30:25,943 --> 00:30:27,362
We'll handle these bombs.

590
00:30:27,365 --> 00:30:28,702
Does that mean what I think it means?

591
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:30,022
Call the whole team. We're
gonna need all the help

592
00:30:30,024 --> 00:30:31,232
we can get on this one.

593
00:30:35,717 --> 00:30:37,250
I miss good old says

594
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,667
when bomb could be turned
off by computer far away

595
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,592
in dark warehouse.

596
00:30:40,595 --> 00:30:42,124
Yeah. These are not those type of bombs,

597
00:30:42,126 --> 00:30:43,468
and since we're on the
topic of freaking out,

598
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,171
the bombs are linked, which
means we can't disarm one

599
00:30:45,173 --> 00:30:46,451
without detonating the other.

600
00:30:46,454 --> 00:30:47,521
Which means we'll have to disarm them

601
00:30:47,523 --> 00:30:48,779
at the exact same time.

602
00:30:48,782 --> 00:30:51,349
It's like the world's worst trust fall.

603
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:56,816
Ohh. I was hoping it would
look less scary in person.

604
00:30:56,818 --> 00:30:58,885
- Wishful thinking.
- Bogey number one is attached

605
00:30:58,888 --> 00:31:00,957
to the main pipeline leading
straight into Star City.

606
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,622
We got eyes on the second bomb.

607
00:31:02,624 --> 00:31:06,125
Guys, this timer's started already.

608
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:07,994
Mine, too.

609
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:10,143
This timer was activated manually.

610
00:31:10,146 --> 00:31:12,632
Diaz is still here.

611
00:31:13,712 --> 00:31:14,968
Dinah, meet me outside.

612
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,269
Anatoly, Rene.

613
00:31:16,271 --> 00:31:17,971
We'll keep an eye on the bomb squad.

614
00:31:17,973 --> 00:31:19,606
Bring in our exfil.

615
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:23,943
I want to watch the
fireworks from above.

616
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:26,479
Curtis, each linking device is
protected by its own crypto-key.

617
00:31:26,482 --> 00:31:29,949
We decrypt the passcodes, and then
we input them at the exact same time.

618
00:31:29,952 --> 00:31:32,058
Yeah. I'm gonna need a little
bit more time on my end.

619
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,419
You got the easy bomb.

620
00:31:33,421 --> 00:31:34,787
We do not have more time.

621
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:36,756
- When can we run?
- Not now.

622
00:31:40,161 --> 00:31:41,779
Guys, we have a problem.

623
00:31:41,782 --> 00:31:43,996
My little bundle of joy
came with a backup detonator.

624
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:46,191
- Cell phone transmitter.
- Can you remove it?

625
00:31:46,193 --> 00:31:47,533
Not if we don't want to set it off.

626
00:31:47,535 --> 00:31:49,680
We can't input those passcodes
until we have that master phone.

627
00:31:49,682 --> 00:31:51,816
Once Diaz realizes that the
timers have been stopped...

628
00:31:51,818 --> 00:31:55,875
He blows us up with phone call. Festive.

629
00:31:55,877 --> 00:31:58,878
You go get that phone. I got this.

630
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:13,291
Got the passcode. Ready to input it.

631
00:32:13,294 --> 00:32:16,863
I'm ready, too. Dig, Rene, do you copy?

632
00:32:19,134 --> 00:32:20,566
Anyone?

633
00:32:46,594 --> 00:32:48,828
Come on. Come on, Rene.

634
00:33:07,893 --> 00:33:09,393
We cannot wait any longer.

635
00:33:09,396 --> 00:33:10,783
They're gonna come through.

636
00:33:10,785 --> 00:33:15,588
Okay. On 3. 1, 2, 3, type.

637
00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:24,030
Now we run.

638
00:33:27,068 --> 00:33:29,235
Impressive,

639
00:33:29,237 --> 00:33:30,844
but it's pointless.

640
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,084
Impossible.

641
00:34:08,711 --> 00:34:10,611
Breaking news out of Star City.

642
00:34:10,614 --> 00:34:14,392
Notorious fugitive Ricardo
Diaz is behind bars tonight,

643
00:34:14,395 --> 00:34:17,693
thanks to the efforts of
the unidentified Green Arrow.

644
00:34:17,696 --> 00:34:19,950
Earlier this evening,
the vigilante foiled

645
00:34:19,953 --> 00:34:23,028
an attempted bombing at
the natural gas plant,

646
00:34:23,031 --> 00:34:26,645
leaving many to wonder
should the anti-vigilante law

647
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:27,937
be revoked.

648
00:34:29,441 --> 00:34:31,625
Well, just like the good old days, huh?

649
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:33,742
The Green Arrow swooping
in to save the day.

650
00:34:33,745 --> 00:34:35,945
We do all the work, and
he gets all the credit.

651
00:34:35,947 --> 00:34:37,283
About time he got some credit.

652
00:34:37,286 --> 00:34:38,914
The important thing is we caught Diaz.

653
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:40,884
And this is a huge collar for the SCPD.

654
00:34:40,887 --> 00:34:43,070
The feds are gonna be pissed
they didn't get him first,

655
00:34:43,073 --> 00:34:46,121
and we are gonna charge Diaz
with every crime in the book.

656
00:34:46,124 --> 00:34:48,625
Guys, we caught Diaz.

657
00:34:48,627 --> 00:34:50,527
This is what can happen
when we all work together.

658
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:52,047
I don't want to say I told you so...

659
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,063
- But you are, right?
- Yeah.

660
00:34:54,066 --> 00:34:56,317
You know what? Let's go
get a drink and celebrate.

661
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,101
- We deserve it, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

662
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:07,744
Well, Felicity, after
everything, you did it.

663
00:35:07,746 --> 00:35:09,879
How's it feel?

664
00:35:09,881 --> 00:35:15,151
Well... Diaz is behind bars.

665
00:35:15,153 --> 00:35:18,588
What could be better than that?

666
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:21,391
I mean, I thought I made myself clear.

667
00:35:21,393 --> 00:35:22,992
I don't want your help.

668
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,310
That's just too bad because
as your legal counsel,

669
00:35:25,313 --> 00:35:28,865
I am obligated to inform
you of your case status.

670
00:35:28,867 --> 00:35:31,966
That should be your copy
of the court's ruling.

671
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:33,956
Spoiler alert... We lost.

672
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:35,458
Must be difficult to win a case

673
00:35:35,461 --> 00:35:38,108
when you're not a real lawyer.

674
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:41,644
Says here the judge is
ordering an investigation

675
00:35:41,646 --> 00:35:44,797
into prisoner abuse at Slabside?

676
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,436
Turns out the government isn't a big fan

677
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:48,706
of lobotomizing their prisoners.

678
00:35:52,423 --> 00:35:56,158
That will help a lot of people in here.

679
00:35:56,161 --> 00:35:57,527
Ahem. Thank you.

680
00:35:57,529 --> 00:35:59,562
I don't want your thanks.

681
00:35:59,564 --> 00:36:02,365
I didn't do this for
you. I did this for me,

682
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:05,668
and, no, I am not your Laurel.

683
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:09,205
I'm not the old Laurel. I'm me.

684
00:36:09,207 --> 00:36:11,266
Everyone has good and
bad inside of them,

685
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:15,670
and you can't put people in
one box or the other ever.

686
00:36:29,977 --> 00:36:33,336
_

687
00:36:45,243 --> 00:36:46,976
Vodka?

688
00:36:46,978 --> 00:36:48,678
What, because I am Russian?

689
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,847
That is stereotype,

690
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:52,649
but da, yes, vodka.

691
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:54,484
I only have a bit left.

692
00:36:54,486 --> 00:36:56,486
I hope they have vodka in the Maldives,

693
00:36:56,488 --> 00:36:59,222
that is, if you can
do an American accent.

694
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,047
Hello. I am Jason Brown

695
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:06,094
from Denver, Colorado.

696
00:37:06,097 --> 00:37:07,520
Heh.

697
00:37:07,523 --> 00:37:09,331
Spasiba.

698
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:12,202
You're a strong person, Felicity Smoak.

699
00:37:12,204 --> 00:37:14,437
You catch Dragon.

700
00:37:17,108 --> 00:37:19,442
Now don't look back.

701
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:26,015
Doesn't make any sense.

702
00:37:26,017 --> 00:37:29,519
Felicity wouldn't do
something like this.

703
00:37:29,521 --> 00:37:33,091
Like we said, she changed.

704
00:37:33,094 --> 00:37:34,484
Okay. Let's say you're right

705
00:37:34,487 --> 00:37:37,526
and Felicity somehow
became overwatch of evil.

706
00:37:37,529 --> 00:37:39,028
Why lead us here?

707
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,730
Maybe she had a change of heart,

708
00:37:40,732 --> 00:37:42,125
tried to back out last second.

709
00:37:42,128 --> 00:37:44,344
It'd explain why someone
would want her dead, right?

710
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:45,906
Not to state the obvious,

711
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:47,936
but if we start poking
around, it's gonna make

712
00:37:47,939 --> 00:37:49,109
us targets, too.

713
00:37:49,112 --> 00:37:52,107
None of us have any idea what
Felicity's intentions were

714
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,744
or why she reached out to you.

715
00:37:54,746 --> 00:37:57,380
Following this lead means taking a risk.

716
00:37:57,382 --> 00:38:01,117
I don't know what happened to
Felicity these past few years,

717
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,855
but what I do know is there was
a time when all of us loved her.

718
00:38:05,857 --> 00:38:09,225
Isn't finding out what really
happened worth the risk?

719
00:38:11,863 --> 00:38:17,133
Fine. We'll start by tracking
down whoever she contacted last.

720
00:38:17,135 --> 00:38:21,237
Okay. Last call out
was to someone named...

721
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:22,516
Blackstar.

722
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:24,453
That doesn't sound ominous at all.

723
00:38:24,456 --> 00:38:26,242
I swear to god, if this gets me killed,

724
00:38:26,244 --> 00:38:28,645
- I'm gonna murder you.
- Noted.

725
00:38:39,524 --> 00:38:42,725
I liked you better with pink hair.

726
00:38:42,727 --> 00:38:45,628
You don't scare me.

727
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:50,166
I don't think that's true.

728
00:38:50,168 --> 00:38:52,602
See that camera?

729
00:38:52,604 --> 00:38:54,470
No red light.

730
00:38:54,472 --> 00:38:57,173
That means you and I
are completely alone.

731
00:38:57,175 --> 00:38:59,175
Hmm.

732
00:38:59,177 --> 00:39:03,680
You took my husband from me.

733
00:39:03,682 --> 00:39:07,383
I had to send my son away.

734
00:39:07,385 --> 00:39:11,591
You destroyed my life.

735
00:39:11,594 --> 00:39:13,461
What you gonna do about it?

736
00:39:23,568 --> 00:39:25,375
You don't have the guts.

737
00:39:25,378 --> 00:39:28,070
No. I do.

738
00:39:28,073 --> 00:39:31,374
You see, that's the problem.

739
00:39:31,376 --> 00:39:36,523
I do have the guts because
you made me into this person.

740
00:39:39,317 --> 00:39:41,484
Hmm?

741
00:39:41,486 --> 00:39:43,086
Go ahead.

742
00:39:46,991 --> 00:39:51,260
Sweetheart, this is the big boys' table.

743
00:39:51,262 --> 00:39:52,969
You should leave.

744
00:39:56,768 --> 00:39:58,148
Felicity, don't.

745
00:39:58,151 --> 00:39:59,864
Couldn't be without me, could you, baby?

746
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:01,371
I'm ending him, Laurel.

747
00:40:01,373 --> 00:40:03,719
No. You don't want to do this, trust me.

748
00:40:03,722 --> 00:40:06,441
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't!

749
00:40:06,444 --> 00:40:10,179
We need him to help Oliver.

750
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:11,948
What do you mean?

751
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:19,455
I made a deal with the feds, a trade.

752
00:40:19,457 --> 00:40:22,250
Diaz for your husband.

753
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,388
If Oliver agrees to assist them

754
00:40:24,391 --> 00:40:27,964
with their case against Diaz,

755
00:40:27,966 --> 00:40:30,299
he'll be a free man again.

756
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:42,712
Oliver's coming home?

757
00:40:42,714 --> 00:40:44,747
Yeah.

758
00:40:57,495 --> 00:40:59,095
How did you do it?

759
00:40:59,097 --> 00:41:00,830
I knew the Green Arrow was good,

760
00:41:00,832 --> 00:41:02,365
but I didn't think he was that good.

761
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:04,233
Stanley, I'm just glad you're okay.

762
00:41:04,235 --> 00:41:06,502
Okay? I'm great! I was this close

763
00:41:06,504 --> 00:41:08,792
to being stuck in here
for the rest of my life.

764
00:41:08,795 --> 00:41:10,528
If you hadn't found Turner's blade,

765
00:41:10,531 --> 00:41:12,608
it would have been all over for me.

766
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,847
How'd you know it was Turner's blade?

767
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:21,552
- What do you mean?
- You were in the hole, Stanley,

768
00:41:21,555 --> 00:41:26,756
so how'd you know it was Turner's blade?

769
00:41:26,758 --> 00:41:29,859
I guess I must have heard it somewhere.

770
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,931
You gonna eat that?

771
00:41:41,273 --> 00:41:45,352
