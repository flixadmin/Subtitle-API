Hello there, wanderer.

17
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,617
Don't see many folks around here.

18
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,659
Been a while since this old mine turned up
anything worth taking.

19
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,418
Then I guess I'll be on my way.

- Or do you need a reminder?
- Wait.

24
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,760
I know things about these mines.

Things I can't tell you if I'm shot.

The ore in there, it's rare and powerful.

to Late Antiquity

728
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,613
What if when you interacted
with your younger self in 1987, you...

729
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:30,001

so that my memories from my new life

are supplanting the memories
from my old life,

thus creating temporal dissonance.

That's a brilliant theory
which I happen to share with you,
