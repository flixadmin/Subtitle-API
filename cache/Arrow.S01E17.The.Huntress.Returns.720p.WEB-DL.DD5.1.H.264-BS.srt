1
00:00:01,115 --> 00:00:03,987
My name is Oliver Queen.
For 5 years,

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:06,471
I was stranded on an island
with only one goal--

3
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:09,357
survive.

4
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:11,192
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,194 --> 00:00:13,594
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,763
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,400
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:21,736
To do this, I must
become someone else.

9
00:00:21,738 --> 00:00:25,407
I must become
something else.

10
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:28,406
Previously on "Arrow"...
Mom?

11
00:00:28,408 --> 00:00:29,991
It's about Sarah.
What about her?

12
00:00:29,993 --> 00:00:31,942
I think
she may be alive.

13
00:00:31,944 --> 00:00:34,746
I'm not here to hurt you
or your father.

14
00:00:34,748 --> 00:00:37,615
Why should I trust you?!

15
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:39,617
Because you always have.

16
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:41,719
This is my daughter, Helena.

17
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:43,421
When her father
killed her fiancé,

18
00:00:43,423 --> 00:00:45,506
she changed into something
dark and twisted.

19
00:00:45,508 --> 00:00:49,627
I have been alone
in my hate for so long.

20
00:00:50,763 --> 00:00:52,847
What is this?
Payback.

21
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:55,683
The police
have him in custody.

22
00:00:55,685 --> 00:00:57,902
He's going to jail
and then onto prison.

23
00:00:57,904 --> 00:00:59,470
I'm not going to stop.

24
00:01:21,827 --> 00:01:24,095
Hey, mister.

25
00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:26,681
You feel like a dance?

26
00:01:29,184 --> 00:01:32,437
Absolutely.

27
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:36,274
Tonight
your first night?

28
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:38,843
First, and last.

29
00:01:38,845 --> 00:01:40,895
Gus.

30
00:01:40,897 --> 00:01:43,364
Helena!

31
00:01:43,366 --> 00:01:45,066
I'm looking for my father.

32
00:01:45,068 --> 00:01:48,052
I figure if anybody knows
where he is,

33
00:01:48,054 --> 00:01:50,238
it'd be his attorney.

34
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,873
I don't.

35
00:01:53,742 --> 00:01:57,378
Ohh! Helena,
I swear...

36
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,615
I'd tell you where
the FBI's keeping Frank,

37
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:03,718
but after your father and I
made his plea deal to testify,

38
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,704
the Feds, they stopped
telling me anything.

39
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:08,423
Please.

40
00:02:08,425 --> 00:02:11,542
You have to believe me.

41
00:02:11,544 --> 00:02:13,394
I do.

42
00:02:22,387 --> 00:02:26,390
Hey, Gus, song's over,
man. You still in there?

43
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,480

00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,801
It looks amazing!

47
00:02:54,803 --> 00:02:56,886
Yeah.

48
00:02:56,888 --> 00:02:59,255
Steve Aoki's going to deejay.
Right there.

49
00:02:59,257 --> 00:03:01,090
What? How did you get
Steve Aoki?

50
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:02,425
I dated his sister.

51
00:03:02,427 --> 00:03:03,643
Oh.

52
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:05,645
A million years ago,
a million years ago.

53
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:06,980
Ok.

54
00:03:06,982 --> 00:03:10,450
So, will you be my date
tomorrow night?

55
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:13,602
Is a club opening
a proper date?

56
00:03:13,604 --> 00:03:15,154
I certainly hope so.

57
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,124
Is that a "yes?"

58
00:03:18,126 --> 00:03:19,542
No.

59
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:25,865
That's a "yes."

60
00:03:30,888 --> 00:03:32,955
Laurel.

61
00:03:32,957 --> 00:03:34,841
I'm glad you called.

62
00:03:34,843 --> 00:03:37,560
Too much...
It's too long

63
00:03:37,562 --> 00:03:39,345
for us to go
without talking.

64
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:42,849
Dad, I have
to tell you--

65
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:44,651
No, no, listen,
before you say anything,

66
00:03:44,653 --> 00:03:45,902
I got to apologize.

67
00:03:45,904 --> 00:03:47,854
I should never have used you

68
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:50,773
to catch the archer,
and I'm sorry.

69
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:52,975
Laurel, I'm just--
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:52,977 --> 00:03:54,260
Thank you.

71
00:03:54,262 --> 00:03:56,663
I owe you
an apology, too.

72
00:03:56,665 --> 00:03:58,531
For what?

73
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:00,583
Hello, Quentin.

74
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:04,370
How are you?

75
00:04:04,372 --> 00:04:05,988
You look well.

76
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,191
What are you doing here?

77
00:04:08,193 --> 00:04:10,710
Why--why are you here?

78
00:04:10,712 --> 00:04:14,864
I'm here because I believe
Sarah's still alive.

79
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:17,633
What?!

80
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:20,002
Dad. Sit--
What is going on?

81
00:04:20,004 --> 00:04:23,005
Just hear mom out.
Sit.

82
00:04:23,007 --> 00:04:24,557
What's going on?

83
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:26,225
Start from
the beginning.

84
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:31,347
Oliver was found
on an island

85
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:34,367
called Lian Yu
in the North China Sea.

86
00:04:34,369 --> 00:04:36,061
There are hundreds;

87
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:38,489
Thousands of deserted
islands in this chain.

88
00:04:38,857 --> 00:04:42,442
What if Sarah
had survived, too?

89
00:04:42,444 --> 00:04:45,044
And nobody would know if she'd
washed up in any one of those.

90
00:04:45,046 --> 00:04:48,297
So you don't actually
have any proof that she's alive?

91
00:04:48,299 --> 00:04:50,366
I have proof.

92
00:04:51,802 --> 00:04:54,587
A tourist took this.

93
00:04:57,307 --> 00:04:59,708
Could be anybody.

94
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,594
Doesn't it look
just like Sarah?

95
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:05,815
Our daughter's
a survivor, Quentin.

96
00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:09,018
Ah, you have some nerve.

97
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,887
Three years, no phone calls,
no emails, nothing.

98
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:13,022
You just show up
with an old photo--

99
00:05:13,024 --> 00:05:14,907
Dad, please.
No.

100
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:18,578
Please, you listen to me, ok?
Sarah died on that boat.

101
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:24,450
Why--

102
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,005
why are you making me
re-live this?

103
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:31,624
I'm not doing this.

104
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:35,762
Dad...

105
00:05:35,764 --> 00:05:37,930
No.

106
00:05:37,932 --> 00:05:40,550
So I told Chris and Shane they could be
our plus ones tonight

107
00:05:40,552 --> 00:05:43,936
to Oliver's club--
if they're lucky.

108
00:05:43,938 --> 00:05:46,139
We both have plus ones, right?

109
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:48,775
Uh, I-I don't know.

110
00:05:48,777 --> 00:05:51,927
Hang on just a second.

111
00:05:51,929 --> 00:05:55,698
I didn't know purse snatchers
took coffee breaks.

112
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,450
You know, for a stuck up,
rich bitch,

113
00:05:57,452 --> 00:05:59,268
you seem to spend
a lot of time here in the Glades.

114
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,903
My job's around here.

115
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:03,105
You? Have a job?
Yeah.

116
00:06:03,107 --> 00:06:04,773
You know, you should
try it some time.

117
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:06,292
Instead of hanging out
on a street corner,

118
00:06:06,294 --> 00:06:07,827
waiting to boost
somebody's handbag.

119
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:09,245
Sounds good.

120
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:10,797
Know anyone who's hiring
high school dropouts

121
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,832
with a couple of priors,
no references

122
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:14,133
and a history
of violence?

123
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,487
Actually, I might.

124
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:20,156
You know that new club
opening in the Glades?

125
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:23,142
Verdant? My brother owns it.

126
00:06:23,144 --> 00:06:26,479
I think he might be hiring
valet attendants.

127
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:28,097
Do you think
it's a good idea?

128
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:30,183
Me, taking the keys
to stranger's cars?

129
00:06:30,185 --> 00:06:32,718
I think it's time
you put up or shut up.

130
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,638
Talk to your brother.

131
00:06:47,584 --> 00:06:48,918
Yo.

132
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,671
Hey.

133
00:06:51,673 --> 00:06:53,789
Where you been?

134
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,058
Oh, I thought I'd give myself
a rare morning in.

135
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,545
Don't look at me like that.
The club is opening, finally.

136
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:01,330
McKenna and I are going
on date number six tonight,

137
00:07:01,332 --> 00:07:04,667
which is...
It's significant.

138
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:06,385
And, uh, I don't know.

139
00:07:06,387 --> 00:07:09,171
It seemed like a good day
to give the bad guys a rest.

140
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,194
Well, it's the bad girls
that I'm worried about.

141
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:17,547
Helena.

142
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:18,831
Yes, or as I like
to call her,

143
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,082
your psycho
ex-girlfriend.

144
00:07:20,084 --> 00:07:21,334
This was taken
at Alley Cats,

145
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:23,402
the strip joint.
The police report

146
00:07:23,404 --> 00:07:26,122
lists the stiff's name
as Gus Sabatoni.

147
00:07:26,124 --> 00:07:27,740
That's Bertinelli's lawyer.

148
00:07:27,742 --> 00:07:29,642
Why would she come back
to Starling City just for him?

149
00:07:29,644 --> 00:07:31,561
It's not like he did
a good job.

150
00:07:31,563 --> 00:07:33,663
Her father's serving consecutive life
sentences without parole.

151
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:36,415
Come on, Oliver, we both knew
this was just a matter of time.

152
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:38,885
You tried to help her,
you couldn't.

153
00:07:38,887 --> 00:07:40,166
Now the only question is,

154
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:42,042
how long before she drops
the dime on you,

155
00:07:42,373 --> 00:07:44,707
me, this whole operation.

156
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:47,894
Look, I want you to get in touch
with her contacts in the Bratva.

157
00:07:47,896 --> 00:07:50,379
Talk to anyone on the street,
figure out where Helena is,

158
00:07:50,381 --> 00:07:51,880
why she's back.

159
00:07:51,882 --> 00:07:53,549
Ok. But Oliver--

160
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:55,050
dig, if she's here,
she's here for a reason.

161
00:07:55,052 --> 00:07:56,435
If that's not Frank Bertinelli,

162
00:07:56,437 --> 00:07:57,987
we need to know
what she has planned.

163
00:07:57,989 --> 00:08:00,072
Ok.

164
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,117
- Speedy?
- Oh, we're in here.

165
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:14,170
Look who's back.

166
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:16,422
She was just telling me about
your guys' first date--

167
00:08:16,424 --> 00:08:17,573
at Russo's.

168
00:08:17,575 --> 00:08:19,508
Hello, Oliver.

169
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,545
Oh, Ollie, I kind of have
this pseudo friend

170
00:08:22,547 --> 00:08:24,096
that's looking
for a job.

171
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:26,299
I was wondering
if the club's still hiring?

172
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:28,434
Yes. Of course.
Talk to Tommy.

173
00:08:28,436 --> 00:08:31,270
As a matter of fact, you can go
upstairs and call Tommy, right now.

174
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:33,105
Great.

175
00:08:33,107 --> 00:08:35,141
You rock.

176
00:08:39,696 --> 00:08:41,930
Where you been?

177
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:44,283
Um...

178
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:47,453
Barcelona.

179
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:50,289
Monaco, Budapest.

180
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,658
I just needed
to forget who I was.

181
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,276
And how much
I missed you.

182
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:57,079
Do you mean like
you missed Gus Sabatoni?

183
00:08:57,081 --> 00:08:58,774
I thought you were done

184
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,879
with your father's
organization, Helena.

185
00:09:01,085 --> 00:09:03,669
Because he's serving
consecutive life sentences

186
00:09:03,671 --> 00:09:05,955
in Iron Heights prison.

187
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:07,556
You got your revenge.

188
00:09:07,558 --> 00:09:08,975
He just cut a deal

189
00:09:08,977 --> 00:09:10,810
with the Justice
Department to testify

190
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:12,511
against
the East Coast family.

191
00:09:12,513 --> 00:09:14,647
In 48 hours,
Witness Protection

192
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:16,732
will give him a new name,
a new life,

193
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:19,018
and he'll be off the grid forever--
untraceable!

194
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,303
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

195
00:09:21,305 --> 00:09:24,140
My father doesn't
deserve a second chance--

196
00:09:24,142 --> 00:09:26,442
a second life.
And I can't.

197
00:09:26,444 --> 00:09:30,179
I can't take on
a phalanx of U.S. marshals.

198
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:33,366
Not without help.

199
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:35,568
No.

200
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,370
It's murder.

201
00:09:37,372 --> 00:09:39,472
It's not justice.

202
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:41,657
Oh, there you are.

203
00:09:41,659 --> 00:09:44,427
I have a question about
your opening tonight.

204
00:09:44,429 --> 00:09:45,845
Hello.

205
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:48,047
Hi.

206
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:50,549
Oliver, who's
your friend?

207
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:53,502
Oh! Mom, this is Helena.
Helena, this is my mother.

208
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:56,689
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Helena was just leaving.

209
00:09:56,691 --> 00:09:59,174
Yes. I have
a family engagement.

210
00:09:59,176 --> 00:10:01,060
Excuse us for a minute.

211
00:10:01,062 --> 00:10:03,529
Of course.

212
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:08,534
I guess I will just have
to be more persuasive.

213
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:10,369
Fortunately...

214
00:10:10,371 --> 00:10:13,456
You have a family, too.

215
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:27,821
She was in my house.

216
00:10:27,823 --> 00:10:29,657
She made a not so veiled threat.

217
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:32,159
I want extra security
around my mother and sister.

218
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:34,245
Way ahead of you, man.
Thank you.

219
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:35,312
It's my job.

220
00:10:35,314 --> 00:10:38,649
For not saying,
"I told you so."

221
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:40,150
Night's young.

222
00:10:44,422 --> 00:10:46,206
Where you been?

223
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,125
The club opens in four hours.

224
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:49,360
I've been dealing
with the vendors.

225
00:10:49,362 --> 00:10:52,829
No, you haven't. Tommy...

226
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:55,432
We need to talk.

227
00:10:57,886 --> 00:11:00,337
I'm sorry, all right.

228
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:03,557
But I kept this
a secret to protect

229
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,309
the people that are
closest to me.

230
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:07,544
Do you think that's
what I care about?

231
00:11:07,546 --> 00:11:11,398
What, that my
feelings are hurt?

232
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,068
You're a murderer.

233
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,520
A killer.

234
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:18,855
You were my best
friend in life,

235
00:11:18,857 --> 00:11:21,191
but now it's like
I don't even know you.

236
00:11:21,193 --> 00:11:24,044
You're right.
I've changed.

237
00:11:24,046 --> 00:11:26,997
Listen, buddy,
now I can explain to you.

238
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:29,466
I can explain
to you how and why--

239
00:11:29,468 --> 00:11:32,002
What'd be the point?

240
00:11:32,004 --> 00:11:34,755
I wouldn't believe
a word of it, anyway.

241
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,600
One of those missiles
has an effective range

242
00:11:46,602 --> 00:11:49,403
of up to 2,400 kilometers.

243
00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:50,807
We're not going anywhere

244
00:11:50,832 --> 00:11:52,824
until we figure out
what Fyers is planning.

245
00:11:55,944 --> 00:11:58,729
Wild guess? He's planning
on blowing something up.

246
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:01,115
Well, one of those
could do the job.

247
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:02,733
But this?

248
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:05,252
This is about
starting a war.

249
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:07,904
With who?

250
00:12:07,906 --> 00:12:09,006
What does it matter?

251
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:12,426
We have to stop Fyers

252
00:12:12,428 --> 00:12:15,078
before he kills thousands of
innocent people.

253
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,613
There are tons
of soldiers down there.

254
00:12:16,615 --> 00:12:18,716
Even if we get through
all of them,

255
00:12:18,718 --> 00:12:21,352
we can't just steal
a whole missile launcher.

256
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:29,259
Well, who said anything
about stealing it?

257
00:12:30,478 --> 00:12:33,647
So what's the plan?

258
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:35,733
Ambush?
It's impossible.

259
00:12:35,735 --> 00:12:38,569
We can't take out all six without
one radioing for back up.

260
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:41,822
It'd be good if we could
get all the soldiers in one place.

261
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,212
You're right.

262
00:12:57,972 --> 00:13:00,491
What'd the stapler
ever do to you?

263
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:03,477
What is it, Laurel? I'm busy.
The Hood's girlfriend is back.

264
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:07,314
Dad, I'm sorry
about this morning.

265
00:13:07,316 --> 00:13:10,434
But if I told you the real reason
to come see me,

266
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:12,236
you wouldn't
have shown up.

267
00:13:12,238 --> 00:13:14,638
You're damn right I wouldn't.

268
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:19,026
So you really believe this
garbage your mother's selling

269
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:20,911
about Sarah being alive
on fantasy island?

270
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,032
I mean, no.

271
00:13:27,118 --> 00:13:28,652
But what would it
hurt to take a look

272
00:13:28,654 --> 00:13:30,871
at everything
that mom found?

273
00:13:30,873 --> 00:13:32,806
Even if it's just
to set her straight.

274
00:13:32,808 --> 00:13:35,626
Laurel, you know how long
it's taken for me to get

275
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:37,033
to a place where Sarah
isn't the first thing

276
00:13:37,058 --> 00:13:39,047
I think about every morning?

277
00:13:39,048 --> 00:13:42,182
Dad...

278
00:13:47,222 --> 00:13:50,674
Tell your mom
I'm not making any promises.

279

To Verdant.

282
00:14:19,672 --> 00:14:23,290
I know I haven't always
been supportive of this venture,

283
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:25,509
but I have to admit

284
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:28,479
this nightclub
is quite an accomplishment.

285
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:30,714
I'm proud of you.

286
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:32,382
Your father would be, too.

287
00:14:32,384 --> 00:14:35,435
Yeah, congratulations,

288
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:37,738
Ollie. The club
doesn't totally suck.

289
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,573
Thanks, Speedy.
Thank you very much,

290
00:14:39,575 --> 00:14:41,408

00:15:00,963 --> 00:15:03,964
I'm great.

299
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:06,383
Well, breakfast was a disaster.

300
00:15:06,385 --> 00:15:09,720
Breakfast?
With my parents?

301
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:12,606
Right. That was
this morning.

302
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:14,191
Uh...

303
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:15,926
Sorry.

304
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:17,594
Are you sure
everything's ok?

305
00:15:17,596 --> 00:15:20,263
Because you seem
completely off.

306
00:15:20,265 --> 00:15:22,933
I'm fine.
I promise.

307
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:24,618
Tommy! Tommy.

308
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,437
Did you call Roy yet?
I left him a message.

309
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:30,157
He starts tomorrow.
Which reminds me,

310
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,210
I have to go check in
with the office.

311
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:35,111
Excuse me.

312
00:15:35,113 --> 00:15:36,780
Hey, Tommy.

313
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:39,132
Remember me?

314
00:16:04,325 --> 00:16:06,026
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Queen.

315
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:08,745
Your timing is perfect.
I can't dance.

316
00:16:08,747 --> 00:16:10,497
They said it was urgent.

317
00:16:12,817 --> 00:16:14,251
You ok?

318
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:16,203
Yeah. We ran out of Cristal.

319
00:16:16,205 --> 00:16:17,671
Oh.
I'll be right back.

320
00:16:17,673 --> 00:16:19,539
Ok.

321
00:16:22,594 --> 00:16:25,161
Dig?

322
00:16:25,163 --> 00:16:27,397
Let him go.

323
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:29,165
He has nothing
to do with this.

324
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:31,935
I told you.

325
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:34,021
Oliver, I warned you.

326
00:16:34,023 --> 00:16:36,523
Helena! This isn't you.

327
00:16:36,525 --> 00:16:39,476
My father is a mobster
and a murderer.

328
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:42,638
It is not like you haven't
killed men like that before!

329
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,894
And I tried to teach you

330
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,449
to obtain your objective
without killing!

331
00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:48,685
By applying leverage.

332
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:52,372
By exploiting
someone's weakness.

333
00:16:56,193 --> 00:16:58,829
There is a whole club
full of leverage

334
00:16:58,831 --> 00:17:01,031
above our heads
right now.

335
00:17:01,033 --> 00:17:03,050
Please.

336
00:17:03,052 --> 00:17:05,218
Oliver, don't
make me do something

337
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,370
that both of us
will regret.

338
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:10,040
Ok! Ok. You win.

339
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:12,225
I'll help you.
Let him go.

340
00:17:12,227 --> 00:17:16,396
Let...Him...Go!

341
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,872
Don't say it.

342
00:17:29,873 --> 00:17:31,823
Ok.

343
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:33,992
Then let's talk
about Helena.

344
00:17:35,628 --> 00:17:37,912
Oliver, if you didn't
still have feelings

345
00:17:37,914 --> 00:17:40,448
for this girl, you would have thought
of a different solution

346
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,051
than letting her extort you
into killing someone.

347
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:44,552
So what do you want me to do?

348
00:17:44,554 --> 00:17:46,954
You want me to kill her?

349
00:17:46,956 --> 00:17:48,590
I think you would have
a long time ago

350
00:17:48,592 --> 00:17:51,125
if she looked like me instead
of the T-Mobile girl.

351
00:17:51,127 --> 00:17:52,960
She's a stone cold
killer, Oliver.

352
00:17:52,962 --> 00:17:54,929
She's not evil.

353
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:58,483
She's been lost since her father
killed her fiancé in cold blood.

354
00:17:58,485 --> 00:18:00,518
And are you going to sit there

355
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,971
and tell me that you don't know
what it's like to want revenge?

356
00:18:03,973 --> 00:18:06,608
What would you do? Hmm?

357
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,627
If Floyd Lawton
was standing right there?

358
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:12,141
Nothing that will
involve blackmailing you

359
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,582
into hunting him down.

360
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:16,417
You're right.

361
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:18,953
Ok? I can't kill her.

362
00:18:18,955 --> 00:18:21,172
And I can't take her
to the police

363
00:18:21,174 --> 00:18:23,842
and risk her exposing
all of this.

364
00:18:23,844 --> 00:18:25,677
But at least,
if I'm involved,

365
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,512
I can contain her, all right?

366
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:30,548
I can minimize
the collateral damage.

367
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:34,469
Sorry, am I...
interrupting something?

368
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:37,004
We were just...
talking about you.

369
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:39,724
And here I thought
you didn't care much for me.

370
00:18:39,726 --> 00:18:41,142
Still don't.

371
00:18:41,144 --> 00:18:42,844
I haven't been able
to locate the safe house

372
00:18:42,846 --> 00:18:44,863
where the FBI
is keeping your father.

373
00:18:44,865 --> 00:18:46,514
I can help with that.

374
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:48,516
I've been dying to hack into
the FBI security system.

375
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:50,869
Get out. Get out.

376
00:18:50,871 --> 00:18:54,289
This is a private thing,
Felicity. Please.

377
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:57,876
Oh. Ok.

378
00:18:57,878 --> 00:19:00,378
See ya, I guess...

379
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:07,168
How many girlfriends
do you have, exactly?

380
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,394
Like I said...

381
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:10,301
We don't know where
the safe house is.

382
00:19:10,423 --> 00:19:11,723
What we do know
is that the Marshall service

383
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:13,708
is taking your father
to a hearing

384
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,760
at the Justice
Department tonight.

385
00:19:15,762 --> 00:19:20,265
There's a problem...Helena.

386
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:21,883
There are two vans.

387
00:19:21,885 --> 00:19:24,235
And one of them's a decoy.
Well, it's a good thing

388
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:25,904
there's two of us, then.

389
00:19:25,906 --> 00:19:27,589
It's not too late
to call this off.

390
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:29,490
I think you know me
better than that.

391
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:32,226
I don't take prisoners.

392
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:40,869
Hey!

393
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:45,006
I found an intruder
while I was circling the perimeter.

394
00:19:49,011 --> 00:19:51,179
It's Wilson.

395
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:55,049
You killed a few of my friends,
you son of a bitch.

396
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:56,968
And I'm going
to kill a few more.

397
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:10,615
I'll talk to one
of our lawyers

398
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:13,151
and have them
call you right back.

399
00:20:13,153 --> 00:20:15,653
Cut yourself
shaving?

400
00:20:15,655 --> 00:20:18,105
Hi.
Hey.

401
00:20:18,107 --> 00:20:19,607
You got a minute?

402
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:21,659
Sure.

403
00:20:21,661 --> 00:20:23,945
How was Roy's first day?

404
00:20:23,947 --> 00:20:27,048
Kid never showed.

405
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,633
Um...

406
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:32,003
I just, uh, I came by
to apologize for last night.

407
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:34,255
Instead of an apology,

408
00:20:34,257 --> 00:20:35,673
why don't you
try the truth?

409
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:37,959
You can start
with your wrist.

410
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:41,479
I got into a fight
with a blender at the club.

411
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:43,431
It was stupid.

412
00:20:43,433 --> 00:20:46,067
I thought I asked
for the truth.

413
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:48,853
I know something's up.

414
00:20:48,855 --> 00:20:51,406
Why won't you tell me
what's going on?

415
00:20:51,408 --> 00:20:54,792
Because I can't.

416
00:20:54,794 --> 00:20:56,978
Why not?

417
00:20:58,831 --> 00:21:02,784
I can't tell you that, either.
I wish that I could.

418
00:21:02,786 --> 00:21:05,670
Laurel, I'm sorry.

419
00:21:05,672 --> 00:21:07,038
So am I.

420
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,125
I really need you
right now, Tommy.

421
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:13,661
My mother shows up saying
my dead sister is still alive,

422
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:16,330
and my father is furious with me
that I'm even listening to her.

423
00:21:16,332 --> 00:21:18,466
And I don't know
who to believe.

424
00:21:18,468 --> 00:21:20,385
I feel like
I'm falling apart.

425
00:21:20,387 --> 00:21:22,854
I'm still here for you.
No.

426
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:25,023
You're not.
You're a million miles away,

427
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:29,110
and the worst part is,
I don't even know why.

428
00:21:29,112 --> 00:21:31,229
I'm sorry.

429
00:21:39,955 --> 00:21:43,074
Wow. Stalker much?

430
00:21:43,076 --> 00:21:45,877
You didn't show up
for the job I got you.

431
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:47,537
Yeah, I had second
thoughts about parking

432
00:21:47,562 --> 00:21:48,580
your brother's Bentley.

433
00:21:48,581 --> 00:21:50,531
What, being a valet
is beneath you?

434
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:53,868
No, but accepting charity
from some rich girl is.

435
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,253
Why are you so obsessed

436
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:56,888
with the fact
that I have money?

437
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,723
You know, money
isn't everything.

438
00:21:58,725 --> 00:22:01,042
Spoken
like someone who's got it.

439
00:22:01,044 --> 00:22:02,844
Now, uh, if you'll excuse me,

440
00:22:02,846 --> 00:22:05,596
I need to get back
to my life of crime.

441
00:22:21,229 --> 00:22:25,450
Yo, can you help me out?
Think I'm lost.

442
00:22:25,452 --> 00:22:27,902
Where's downtown at?
I--I--I don't know.

443
00:22:27,904 --> 00:22:30,121
Maybe you can give us
some directions.

444
00:22:30,123 --> 00:22:32,907
Or better yet, some money--

445
00:22:43,085 --> 00:22:47,021
You ok?

446
00:22:47,023 --> 00:22:49,190
You're bleeding!

447
00:22:49,192 --> 00:22:51,359
Yeah, that's what happens when
you get stabbed.

448
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:54,595
Ahh.

449
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,789
Just your father.

450
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:06,941
Anyone else gets hurt and
I'll put an arrow in you.

451
00:23:06,943 --> 00:23:09,577
That's sweet.

452
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:14,165
Now I know how you charmed
your cop girlfriend.

453
00:24:35,881 --> 00:24:38,583
Give me Frank Bertinelli.

454
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:46,807
Your father's
not in the van.

455
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:49,260
But he sends his regards.

456
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:51,062
Where's the Hood?

457
00:24:51,064 --> 00:24:53,264
Helena Bertinelli...

458
00:24:53,266 --> 00:24:56,601
You have the right
to remain silent.

459
00:25:02,274 --> 00:25:04,609
Damn it.

460
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:07,245
Anything you say can
and will be held

461
00:25:07,247 --> 00:25:08,863
against you
in a court of law.

462
00:25:08,865 --> 00:25:11,916
You have the right
to an attorney.

463
00:25:25,675 --> 00:25:28,819
Paul Copani, Nick Salvati,
Gus Sabatoni.

464
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:31,789
You are quite the hunter,
Ms. Bertinelli.

465
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,459
Well, I guess I should
make that "Huntress."

466
00:25:35,461 --> 00:25:37,444
You've been
systemically taking down

467
00:25:37,446 --> 00:25:39,813
everyone in your father's
criminal organization.

468
00:25:39,815 --> 00:25:43,284
When Gus Sabatoni
turned up dead,

469
00:25:43,286 --> 00:25:44,618
we knew it was
just a matter of time

470
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,570
before you tried
to murder your old man.

471
00:25:46,572 --> 00:25:49,139
Do you want
to tell us why?

472
00:25:49,141 --> 00:25:51,809
Not particularly.
You should reconsider.

473
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:55,079
We got you,
but the vigilante got away

474
00:25:55,081 --> 00:25:58,198
before E.S.U.
could move on him.

475
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,619
You know who he is.
Who he really is.

476
00:26:01,621 --> 00:26:04,521
Don't you?

477
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:06,957
Ms. Bertinelli,

478
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,976
you're going away
for all day,

479
00:26:08,978 --> 00:26:10,494
we can't change that.

480
00:26:10,496 --> 00:26:13,080
But things
can be better.

481
00:26:13,082 --> 00:26:16,316
Or they could be worse.

482
00:26:16,318 --> 00:26:20,004
You tell me his name,
I will do everything I can

483
00:26:20,006 --> 00:26:22,539
to make it better.

484
00:26:24,743 --> 00:26:27,511
Oliver Queen.

485
00:26:29,514 --> 00:26:31,282
You're dating him now, right?

486
00:26:31,284 --> 00:26:34,685
I saw you at the opening
of his club last night.

487
00:26:34,687 --> 00:26:38,122
Did he mention
that we used to be lovers?

488
00:26:38,124 --> 00:26:41,508
We want to know about the Hood,
not Oliver Queen.

489
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,811
Let me let you in
on a little secret--

490
00:26:43,813 --> 00:26:45,646
it's not going to work out
between you two.

491
00:26:45,648 --> 00:26:48,649
You see, Oliver
has a particular talent.

492
00:26:48,651 --> 00:26:51,235
He uses people.
He used me,

493
00:26:51,237 --> 00:26:53,854
he used the detective
here's daughter--

494
00:26:53,856 --> 00:26:57,458
excuse me--daughters.

495
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:02,129
I would get out of it

496
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:04,364
before you get yourself hurt.

497
00:27:04,366 --> 00:27:07,851
Last chance.

498
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,754
His name.

499
00:27:11,806 --> 00:27:14,658
The Hood.

500
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:18,645
What's going on?

501
00:27:18,647 --> 00:27:20,380
I don't know.

502
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:27,654
Go, get out of here!

503
00:27:27,656 --> 00:27:29,707
Head for a door.

504
00:27:40,835 --> 00:27:43,087
Freeze!

505
00:27:49,594 --> 00:27:52,429
Sounds like quite
the daring rescue.

506
00:27:52,431 --> 00:27:55,415
You're very lucky to have a friend
like Roy, Thea.

507
00:27:55,417 --> 00:27:57,250
Oh, don't I know it.

508
00:27:57,252 --> 00:27:59,586
We're not friends.

509
00:27:59,588 --> 00:28:02,773
Well, let me get you
stitched up,

510
00:28:02,775 --> 00:28:06,527
and then you two can decide
what you are or aren't.

511
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:11,782
You are such a jerk.

512
00:28:12,917 --> 00:28:14,618
Roy.

513
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,121
What's a matter?

514
00:28:17,123 --> 00:28:18,906
Nothing.

515
00:28:18,908 --> 00:28:20,324
I just don't see why
I need a shot.

516
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:24,244
Oh, don't tell me a tough
gang banger like yourself

517
00:28:24,246 --> 00:28:25,829
is afraid
of a tiny little needle.

518
00:28:25,831 --> 00:28:28,132
It doesn't look
so tiny.

519
00:28:28,134 --> 00:28:30,617
Well, just think about
something else.

520
00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:32,719
Besides the needle.

521
00:28:32,721 --> 00:28:34,004
Like what?

522
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:36,557
Ok, now this could
sting a little.

523
00:28:42,113 --> 00:28:45,132
Done.

524
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:49,486
Now that wasn't
so bad, was it?

525
00:28:54,893 --> 00:28:57,310
Thanks for the save.

526
00:28:57,312 --> 00:28:59,563
I couldn't risk you
telling the police about me.

527
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:01,248
Is that the only reason?

528
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,318
Why can't you
just admit...

529
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,821
That you still have
feelings for me, too?

530
00:29:17,331 --> 00:29:19,800
What is it?

531
00:29:19,802 --> 00:29:22,719
A plane ticket to Rome,
and a passport

532
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:24,504
so you can start a new life

533
00:29:24,506 --> 00:29:27,674
somewhere else.

534
00:29:27,676 --> 00:29:31,111
The police know you're tracking
your father, Helena.

535
00:29:31,113 --> 00:29:34,014
You'll never find him.

536
00:29:34,016 --> 00:29:37,034
So get out of my city.

537
00:29:57,371 --> 00:30:00,140
Place these around
the launcher.

538
00:30:05,563 --> 00:30:08,065
Do it quickly. Their backup will be
arriving any second.

539
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:11,018
We're 60 seconds out
from the launcher.

540
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,820
Set your final charges
and we'll blow it.

541
00:30:19,393 --> 00:30:21,828
I think I have a better idea.

542
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,997
What are you doing?

543
00:30:23,999 --> 00:30:26,250
I'm taking the circuit board.

544
00:30:26,252 --> 00:30:29,119
Computers won't work
without them, and neither will this.

545
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:33,240
Leverage.

546
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,435
I'm sorry.
I should have called.

547
00:30:45,437 --> 00:30:47,020
No, it's--it's ok.

548
00:30:47,022 --> 00:30:48,222
Come on in.

549
00:30:48,224 --> 00:30:49,957
Are you sure?
Yeah, yeah.

550
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:51,024
Thank you.
I'm surprised,

551
00:30:51,026 --> 00:30:52,476
but I'm happy.

552
00:30:52,478 --> 00:30:54,478
Yeah?
Yeah.

553
00:31:01,435 --> 00:31:03,820
Everything ok?

554
00:31:03,822 --> 00:31:06,790
I had a really rough night.

555
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:10,777
I just wasn't anticipating,
with my work and the club,

556
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:13,330
I feel like
I'm letting everybody down.

557
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:16,216
My family and Tommy

558
00:31:16,218 --> 00:31:18,752
and...

559
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:22,089
You. I feel like
I'm letting you down.

560
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:23,757
You're being too
hard on yourself.

561
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:25,509
We both have
demanding jobs.

562
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:27,945
That's no excuse for hurting
the people closest to you.

563
00:31:27,947 --> 00:31:30,447
No, but when you believe
in what you do,

564
00:31:30,449 --> 00:31:32,899
you find a way
to make it work.

565
00:31:32,901 --> 00:31:35,135
How?

566
00:31:35,137 --> 00:31:37,404
Well...

567
00:31:37,406 --> 00:31:39,022
The first thing you do

568
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:41,141
is you find
yourself someone

569
00:31:41,143 --> 00:31:44,845
you never have
to apologize to.

570
00:31:47,816 --> 00:31:51,618
♪ Settle down with me

571
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:55,172
♪ cover me up

572
00:31:55,174 --> 00:31:59,259
♪ lie down with me

573
00:31:59,261 --> 00:32:02,329
♪ and hold me

574
00:32:02,331 --> 00:32:04,664
♪ in your arms

575
00:32:09,354 --> 00:32:11,805
♪ Your heart's
against my chest ♪

576
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:14,941
♪ your lips
pressed in my neck ♪

577
00:32:14,943 --> 00:32:19,062
♪ I'm falling for your eyes

578
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:21,615
♪ but they don't know me yet ♪

579
00:32:21,617 --> 00:32:24,568
♪ And with a feeling
I'll forget ♪

580
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,321
Hey, it's me.

581
00:32:27,323 --> 00:32:30,157
I was multitasking,
and intercepted a police report.

582
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,359
A local sporting goods store
just got robbed

583
00:32:32,361 --> 00:32:34,411
of one high powered cross bow.

584
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:35,912
Now...

585
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:38,248
Could be a crazy coincidence

586
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,034
or your psycho
ex-girlfriend--

587
00:32:41,036 --> 00:32:43,420
Dig's words, not mine--

588
00:32:43,422 --> 00:32:45,389
is still in town.

589
00:32:45,391 --> 00:32:48,809
I'll let you know
if I learn anything more.

590
00:32:48,811 --> 00:32:52,562
In the meantime,
just...watch your back.

591
00:32:52,564 --> 00:32:54,064
Hi.

592
00:32:54,066 --> 00:32:55,749
I don't think
we had a chance

593
00:32:55,751 --> 00:32:57,550
to be properly
introduced this morning.

594
00:33:03,456 --> 00:33:05,035
Felicity?
Oliver.

595
00:33:05,747 --> 00:33:07,413
Oliver...

596
00:33:08,683 --> 00:33:11,184
I'm here.

597
00:33:12,753 --> 00:33:14,754
You ok?

598
00:33:14,756 --> 00:33:16,255
Hey, hey.

599
00:33:16,257 --> 00:33:19,359
You ok?

600
00:33:19,361 --> 00:33:21,928
I got your call.

601
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,764
What happened?
Helena.

602
00:33:24,766 --> 00:33:27,317
She wanted the address to the
safe house where her father's being kept.

603
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:30,153
She made me hack
the FBI database.

604
00:33:30,155 --> 00:33:31,955
Sorry, Oliver.
Hey.

605
00:33:31,957 --> 00:33:34,491
It's not your fault.

606
00:33:36,127 --> 00:33:39,129
Oliver, what are you
going to do?

607
00:33:39,131 --> 00:33:40,930
What I should have done
in the first place.

608
00:33:47,982 --> 00:33:50,367
Ahh!

609
00:34:43,536 --> 00:34:46,422
Helena!

610
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:51,535
Code three, shots fired

611
00:34:51,536 --> 00:34:53,352
at the Bertinelli
safe house.

612
00:34:53,354 --> 00:34:55,321
This is Hall.
I'm onsite.

613
00:34:55,323 --> 00:34:56,917
Wait
for back-up, Detective.

614
00:34:56,942 --> 00:34:58,495
That's an order.

615
00:35:02,463 --> 00:35:05,048
You won't shoot me.

616
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,250
You're not a murderer.

617
00:35:07,252 --> 00:35:08,801
Remember?

618
00:35:08,803 --> 00:35:10,553
But you are.

619
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,232
And if I let you go,

620
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:18,185
that blood will be
on my hands.

621
00:35:19,905 --> 00:35:22,540
I'm sorry.

622
00:35:26,795 --> 00:35:29,246
I practiced that move.

623
00:35:29,248 --> 00:35:33,918
I had a feeling
I might need it someday.

624
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,622
You would have killed me.

625
00:35:57,892 --> 00:35:59,610
Enough!

626
00:35:59,612 --> 00:36:01,495
Freeze!

627
00:36:05,111 --> 00:36:07,254
Put it down.

628
00:36:07,257 --> 00:36:09,090
Turn around.

629
00:36:09,092 --> 00:36:10,925
Slowly.

630
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,597
No!

631
00:36:29,802 --> 00:36:32,420
McKenna?

632
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:58,519
Hey.

633
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,120
Hey.

634
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,687
How you feeling?

635
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:05,689
Uh, numb.

636
00:37:05,691 --> 00:37:08,559
Hey, don't--
don't move.

637
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:10,027
Ok.

638
00:37:10,029 --> 00:37:13,230
I met your doctor.
He's a nice guy.

639
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:14,548
Hmm.

640
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,016
He says you're
lucky to be alive.

641
00:37:16,018 --> 00:37:19,353
Yeah. He also said

642
00:37:19,355 --> 00:37:21,488
I have a shattered femur,

643
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:25,576
and it's going to take
at least a year to rehab.

644
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,997
I loved being a cop.

645
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:32,299
Oh, come on.
McKenna.

646
00:37:32,301 --> 00:37:34,868
You're still a cop.

647
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,421
You have one more
surgery, go home--

648
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:39,256
I'm not going home.
What?

649
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:43,227
I'm moving to Coast City
to live with my sister.

650
00:37:43,229 --> 00:37:44,739
They have the best
physical therapy facility

651
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:46,089
in the country there.

652
00:37:47,549 --> 00:37:49,750
I'll visit.

653
00:37:49,752 --> 00:37:53,237
Hey, I'm a billionaire, right?
Yeah.

654
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:55,388
I'll move to Coast City.

655
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,741
That's
very sweet, but...

656
00:37:57,743 --> 00:38:00,611
Your club just opened.

657
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:03,396
And your work is here.

658
00:38:03,398 --> 00:38:05,449
Don't worry about me.

659
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:08,836
It's my responsibility
to worry about you.

660
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:11,255
Just stop, ok?

661
00:38:11,257 --> 00:38:14,174
Listen, you know
how I feel about you.

662
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:21,465
Please don't make this
harder than it already is.

663
00:38:23,518 --> 00:38:26,270
Ok.

664
00:38:26,272 --> 00:38:27,921
Ok.

665
00:38:27,923 --> 00:38:30,190
It's, uh,

666
00:38:30,192 --> 00:38:33,026
it's whatever you need.

667
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:47,440
Are you cleaning
out your desk?

668
00:38:47,442 --> 00:38:49,660
No. A friend's.

669
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:52,212
Um...

670
00:38:52,214 --> 00:38:54,131
You asked to see me.

671
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:55,999
Why don't you
take a seat.

672
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,634
Ok.

673
00:39:10,131 --> 00:39:13,317
I'm ready to listen now.

674
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:19,990
Thank you.

675
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,366
Hey.

676
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:31,501
I, uh, heard
about McKenna.

677
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:34,204
You ok?

678
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:37,791
Not really.

679
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:42,346
Look, I know that I have been
a jerk lately.

680
00:39:42,348 --> 00:39:44,464
I just couldn't
understand

681
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:47,334
how you could keep
such a huge secret from me.

682
00:39:47,336 --> 00:39:49,803
But I--

683
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:53,357
I never considered
the toll it must take on you.

684
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:58,528
Lying to the people
that are closest to me.

685
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,898
It's the hardest part.

686
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,735
I get that.

687
00:40:07,456 --> 00:40:09,373
I was wrong...

688
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:12,893
to think that I could
have it both ways;

689
00:40:12,895 --> 00:40:16,630
that I could do what I do

690
00:40:16,632 --> 00:40:20,801
and still have a normal life.

691
00:40:20,803 --> 00:40:23,470
With anyone.

692
00:40:23,472 --> 00:40:25,255
Except if you're alone,

693
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:28,041
you're never
going to be happy.

694
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,962
Maybe not.

695
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:38,385
But me being happy isn't
what's important right now.

696
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:45,158
Your plan,
your call.

697
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:51,999
Fyers.

698
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:53,950
Mr. Queen.

699
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:56,503
I thought I might
be hearing from you.

700
00:40:56,505 --> 00:40:58,588
We have the circuit board.

701
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:01,591
You're making
a grave mistake.

702
00:41:01,593 --> 00:41:04,761
My men are scouring
the island for you as we speak.

703
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:07,914
And when they find you,
they will kill you.

704
00:41:07,916 --> 00:41:10,517
Very slowly, I'm afraid.

705
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:13,770
If your men kill us, then you'll
never find the circuit board.

706
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:16,223
And after that, we both know
that all you'll be left with

707
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:20,260
is a really ugly piece
of modern art.

708
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:23,447
What do you propose?

709
00:41:23,449 --> 00:41:25,598
A trade.

710
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,784
I see.

711
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:30,787
And what do you want
in exchange?

712
00:41:34,342 --> 00:41:37,107
I want a way off the island.

713
