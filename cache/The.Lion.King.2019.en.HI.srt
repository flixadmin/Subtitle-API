understand that balance...

and respect
all the creatures...

The birds are tweeting
at 4:00 in the morning.

are going ape.

Of course, as I say,
cheetahs never prosper.

That's what I say.

Did he show you the shadows

No. He said I can't go there.

and no further.

about this place, Nala.

amazing...

259
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,260
Just tell me where.

Whoa. How far is it?

262
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,517
Not far. Just to the shadows.

00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,561
But don't worry,
everyone's been there.

264

We've never been
that far before.

-What if we get lost?
-Relax, Nala.

266
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:11,735
I patrolled the entire kingdom
this morning with my dad.

There's nothing
to worry about.

Well, there is one thing.

269
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,034
We have an imminent threat.
Something is approaching.

270
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,119
Oh, wait, scratch that.
That's my own shadow.

of the dodo?

272

00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,458
Follow me to freedom.

ZAZU: Oh, how lovely it is...

275
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,131
to see the future king
with his future queen.

276
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,050
I could just molt.

What do you mean,
"future queen"?

278

will be betrothed.

We are never
getting married, Zazu.

With an attitude like that,

00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,794
I'm afraid you'll be
a pretty pathetic king.

Well, I'm not letting anyone
tell me where to go,

The greatest leader
the pride has ever known.

682
00:49:00,982 --> 00:49:02,984
To lose a brother...

683

such a deep, personal loss.

who had barely begun to live.

A cub whose blood
held our future.

686

It's almost too much
to endure.

I only wish I had gotten
to the gorge in time...

been there to save them.

that I must assume the throne.

I cannot bear
this burden alone.

695
