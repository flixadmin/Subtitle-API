Enjoy the movie(s) / show(s)

2
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,580
Obviously, a lot of it's temp.

3
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,540
I love it.

4
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,710
If we're airing on TLC
between My 600-lb Life

5
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,260
and Little People, Big World.
But we're not.

6
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,840
Because we're not cheap reality garbage.

7
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,390
Sorry, Courtenay, I thought...

8
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,060
I was trying to go for something
a bit more personable,

9
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,980
- down-to-earth.
- Not this down-to-earth.

10
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,940
I need them to look like
someone you'd want in the Army.

11
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,360
We here are not fucking Heidi and Spencer.
We are the Seven, James.

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,860
And why isn't there anything on Starlight?

13
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,110
She actually hasn't really made
herself available to the crew.

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,660
Where the hell is she?

15
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,080
Has a heavenly body lost her lustre?

16
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,710
Two weeks after Starlight's shocking
appearance at the Believe Expo...

17
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,500
Social media is still buzzing
about her controversial speech.

18
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,670
Was it a breakdown

19
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,420
- or a triumph?
- Of course,

20
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,380
my thoughts are with Starlight,

21
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,340
and I support her in every way.

22
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,720
What I want to know, who's that dude
that stuck his ♪♪♪♪ in her face?

23
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,850
She should ♪♪♪♪ that ♪♪♪♪er in the ♪♪♪hole.

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,890
Okay.

25
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,100
Of everything that I said,
that's what they focus on.

26
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,310
Hey. Eye of the tiger.

27
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,820
You and me, we have
a Panera gift card to win.

28
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,240
- No distractions. Come on.
- Good one here.

29
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,070
Before joining the Seven,

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,700
which hero led a search-and-rescue team...

31
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,160
- My God.
- After the 1994 Northridge earthquake?

32
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,330
Isn't it your job to
know this kind of stuff?

33
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,460
- It's Lamplighter.
- Thank you.

34
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,090
- Yeah, I had all the trading cards.
- Of course you did.

35
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,550
Hughie?

36
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,340
- Hey.
- Where the hell have you been?

37
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,510
After Gary's store, we all thought that...

38
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,470
Hi. Anthony.

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,520
Hughie's best-looking
friend since 4th grade.

40
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,690
Hi, I'm Annie. It's nice to meet you.

41
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,060
You look familiar.

42
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,280
- Did you go to Kennedy?
- She's new in town.

43
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,280
Fantastic. So, what are we drinking,
New-to-Town Annie?

44
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,580
So, Gretchen Scaramucci...

45
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,250
- No, no.
- She was bigger than all the guys.

46
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,620
Like André the Giant-big.
So when Gretchen says

47
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,380
she wants to beat
the living fuck out of this guy

48
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,460
for making a crack about her girlfriend...

49
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,170
- You didn't.
- Hughie gives her

50
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,220
this Clint Eastwood stare, like...

51
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,760
And then, bam, runs,
like Forrest Gump-runs,

52
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,270
five blocks down into a pet store

53
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,810
where he hides behind this jumbo bag

54
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,560
of Kibbles 'n Bits for four hours.

55
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,650
I'll be right back.

56
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,030
I know it! I know this!

57
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,030
- Surprised to run into you here, man.
- Yeah. Same goes for you.

58
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,950
I've been worried, asshole.

59
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,540
Ever since Robin, you...

60
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,660
You weren't answering your phone.

61
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,000
Like, for all I knew, you
were chugging Drano.

62
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,960
- I'm sorry, man.
- Yeah, you should be.

63
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,420
- No, really, I should've called.
- You think?

64
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,890
I'm okay. Really. I just...

65
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,140
needed a fresh start.

66
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,970
Fresh start?

67
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:54,400
Your fresh start is way out of your league.

68
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,360
- You know that, right?
- I am aware, yes.

69
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,240
Annie's great, man.

70
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,860
Live your life.

71
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,990
That's what Robin would want.

72
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,870
Sync mark.

73
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,000
We're good.

74
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,840
- You rolling?
- And... action.

75
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,880
My grandfather built this place
with his bare hands.

76
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,300
He was an amazing man.

77
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,630
The old piano.

78
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,050
Every night, Mom would sit here
and she would play some songs and...

79
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,720
I got to be honest, most of the time,
me and my dad would be...

80
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,560
We'd be making model planes.

81
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,980
I can almost smell the... silver paint.

82
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,280
I really wish he'd lived long enough
to see me fly with the Blue Angels.

83
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,240
That would have blown his mind.

84
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,570
That's me in the middle.

85
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,950
Love you, Mom, Dad.

86
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,460
Welcome to my bedroom. The
Baseball Hall of Fame, you might call it.

87
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,830
Hasn't changed a bit.

88
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,750
There they are, the Tigers.

89
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,460
It's my little team.

90
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,920
I played shortstop. Of course,

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,590
I couldn't show everything I had.

92
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,430
But... let's just say we...

93
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,550
We did a lot of winning.

94
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,060
This is just...

95
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,400
Really just...
It's so special to come back.

96
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,650
- I'm sorry, why is that there?
- Sorry?

97
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,200
Who put the fucking blanket on the bed?

98
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,200
- Randy Set-Dec, I think.
- Who's Randy Set-Dec?

99
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,370
He's over there.

100
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,370
Randy, why? You fucking asshole.

101
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,710
Amateur fuck.

102
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,790
What just happened?

103
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,460
Samaritan's Embrace,

104
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,760
led by Ezekiel but bankrolled by Vought,

105
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,180
has been shipping Compound V
to 53 hospitals across the country

106
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,310
since 1971 and gift wrapping it...

107
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,440
Gift wrapping it

108
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,190
- as polio vaccine.
- Are you telling me

109
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,650
God's not reaching up the twats
of American girls and blessing babies?

110
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,900
Butcher, can you leave God out of this?

111
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,700
Hold on, hold on. So, no hero was born?

112
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,830
None of them? They're all just kids
dosed with the blue shit.

113
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,790
- I mean, even...
- Even fucking Starlight.

114
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,630
Do you think they know...

115
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,260
what really happened to them?

116
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,840
What about Homelander?

117
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,180
Homelander's a black hole. Never
had any public records and never will.

118
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,060
However, every single other Supe?

119
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,770
Juiced-up lab rats.

120
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,350
My God. I'm trying to give

121
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,900
a tremendous fucking TED Talk here,
and this...

122
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,530
- Frenchie, can you control her, please?
- I do not control her.

123
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,410
- Do you see what I'm dealing with?
- Well, spot on, M.M.

124
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,280
We got Vought for child endangerment,
drug trafficking,

125
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,120
and possibly the largest fraud
in American fucking history.

126
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,290
Raynor's gonna love it.

127
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,170
You better hope she does.

128
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,590
Hi.

129
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,800
Hughie, no!

130
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,180
No, no, no.

131
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,970
Not if you're attached to that hand, no.

132
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,100
It's okay. Yeah.

133
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,230
Well, you know, all of this, it's...

134
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,820
But it's only part of the story, no?

135
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,320
I mean, what about
our petite Lazarus here?

136
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,700
She's not an infant.

137
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,280
And she was injected in a basement,
not a hospital.

138
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,950
And there is the small matter
of that she rose from the dead.

139
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,500
Well, your feral pixie dream girl
ain't exactly dictating

140
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,210
her fucking memoirs, is she, Frenchie?

141
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,960
I'm feeling she's trying to communicate.

142
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,500
I mean, she's been doing this for...

143
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,960
Maybe that means something?

144
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,130
- Maybe they're chicken scratches.
- Let's find out.

145
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,970
Nah, you've been burned.
It's not safe out there for you.

146
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,100
M.M.'s right. You got
to fucking stay put, son.

147
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,480
- All right, I'm off.
- Okay.

148
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,310
I'll just keep on Starlight then, right?

149
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,360
Her phone's been tits-up for a week.

150
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,860
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

151
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,240
No.

152
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,620
But I can... I can check.

153
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,750
All right.

154
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,290
You're with me.

155
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,040
- He is?
- I am?

156
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,380
What, to the CIA lady?

157
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,260
No. We're gonna go on a little detour.

158
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,590
You'll love it.

159
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,930
Come on.

160
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,720
No, I have been working with her!

161
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,270
I've been fucking working with her!
I can't believe this.

162
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:45,850
Who the fuck are you gonna get to replace
me? I'd like to see what bitch that is!

163
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,440
You okay?

164
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,820
You know that pledge
you mentor during rush week

165
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,370
because she seems sweet and a little naive

166
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,290
and she doesn't know
she's not supposed to wear UGGs?

167
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,420
And then once she's active,
she stabs you in the back,

168
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,000
gets you kicked out of the house?

169
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,460
I'm sorry. I don't...

170
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,300
It was my big idea to book you
for the Believe Expo.

171
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,130
What could go wrong, I thought.

172
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,140
You were playing to your base.

173
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,600
At least I don't have to
kiss your ass anymore.

174
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,190
Come in.

175
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,320
Thank you for coming, Starlight.

176
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,490
You fired Ashley?

177
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,660
It was actually a mutual decision.

178
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,120
She wanted to explore
different career paths,

179
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,120
and we wished her well.

180
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,580
So, I would like you to take this

181
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,620
in the constructive
spirit that it is intended.

182
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,460
Okay.

183
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,710
You are a selfish, arrogant child.

184
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,800
Back in Iowa,

185
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,390
I bet you watched a lot
of Queen Maeve's movies, right?

186
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,180
I did.

187
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,020
She was a rebel.

188
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,390
Didn't take anyone's shit,
didn't play by the rules.

189
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,440
That's what you wanted to be.
That's what American heroes are.

190
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,060
But it's a myth.

191
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,980
I should know, because I wrote it.

192
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,450
The truth is,
dozens of people in this company

193
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:24,240
spent hundreds of hours
to create the thing that is you.

194
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,910
I never asked for that.

195
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,250
Then why don't you burn the sparkly outfit
and become a cop?

196
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,300
You want to be a superhero.

197
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,130
You want to be famous.

198
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,640
But nobody's famous alone.

199
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,770
So, why don't you cut
the petulant diva shit,

200
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,640
show a little fucking gratitude,

201
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,230
and let us do our job?

202
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,280
No.

203
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,030
I'm sorry.

204
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,620
I mean, I don't mean to be ungrateful.

205
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,120
But... no red carpets,

206
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,160
no reality TV,

207
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,330
and no Noxzema commercials.

208
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,960
And I want my old uniform back.

209
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,800
I'm gonna save people.

210
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,010
Then I think we may need to reconsider
your position in the Seven.

211
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:28,730
And I think that firing an employee after
she reported sexual assault on live TV

212
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,270
might tank your stock price.

213
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,360
Well, I hope
we can count on your discretion.

214
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,990
I'm sorry, I don't do discretion anymore.

215
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,320
If anyone asks me who did it,
I'm gonna answer honestly.

216
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,330
Well, I think it's great
that you want to tell the truth.

217
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,290
I just don't know to whom you're referring.

218
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,330
I think you know.

219
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,540
I think you've known for a long time.

220
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,920
Thank you so much for coming, Starlight.

221
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,510
I have a lot to think about.

222
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,480
Okay.

223
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,480
I mean, you take
Tek Knight's Knightracer?

224
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,200
Had a carbon footprint the size of a 727.

225
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,320
The thing literally shot fire.

226
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,240
Thanks to me, now he drives a hybrid.

227
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,620
That's what the Green Crusader
initiative is all about.

228
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,000
To respect what's beautiful in the world.

229
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,090
- What's up?
- Hi.

230
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,180
So... everything.

231
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,840
So beautiful.

232
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,060
Good. Let's reset.
Trash back on the beach, please.

233
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,060
Background, put the trash back
on the beach.

234
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,600
All right.

235
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,480
Well, we lost my dad at a young age,
and my mom, she worked two jobs,

236
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,900
so, it was my older brother, Nathan,
who pretty much raised me up.

237
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,820
And when I was 3, these guys
started shooting in front of my building

238
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,490
and I outran the damn bullet.

239
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,080
That's kind of how I figured out...

240
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,040
Can I stop you right there for a second?

241
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,580
What if we ixnay the gun violence?

242
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,960
Maybe make it a click more upbeat?

243
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,090
Yeah, yeah.

244
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,420
All right, little bro,
I know you're the fastest man

245
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,670
in the world and all that,
but your work ain't done.

246
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,880
Set. Go.

247
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,680
Nope. You're off, bro.

248
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,060
Go again.

249
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,230
Go.

250
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,390
Nope. Go.

251
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,140
No.

252
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,690
No?

253
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,860
What is going on with you, man?

254
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,610
Here comes the A-Train!

255
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,780
Hey, you knew Popclaw, right?

256
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,580
What? I don't...

257
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,620
You guys were in Teenage Kix together?

258
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,160
You heard she passed away, yeah?

259
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,620
Yeah, they're saying it was a stroke,

260
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,090
but between you and me,

261
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,000
I think it was probably a drug overdose.

262
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:06,510
You want to maybe say
a little something in her honour?

263
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,270
I haven't seen her in
years, so, you know...

264
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,870
Boy, you're really milking this thing
for all it's worth.

265
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,290
- Excuse me?
- This empowerment act.

266
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,580
I mean, every time I'm on a red carpet now,

267
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,080
they're asking me
how I'm supporting Starlight.

268
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,920
But, hey, as long as
you're trending, right?

269
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,800
I know that you might not get this,

270
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,380
but it's not an act.

271
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,010
I'm just trying to be honest.

272
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,680
Okay. Yeah.

273
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,430
When I was younger,

274
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,060
I read your autobiography
so many times that I wore it out.

275
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,270
I had to buy a second one.

276
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,240
I wanted to live my
life exactly like yours.

277
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,870
Because you didn't just break all the bones
in your right arm

278
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,990
stopping that school bus
from falling off of a bridge,

279
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,710
but you also went to every kid's
physical therapy afterwards.

280
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,580
Just to show the world
that they were heroes, too.

281
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,710
You really stood for something.

282
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,880
But now...

283
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,640
I'm pretty sure that was just written
by the marketing guys.

284
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,890
Hunting for his own food.

285
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,440
When fully mature, this immense
predator of the sea

286
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,900
can reach sizes of up to 25 feet in length

287
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,820
and over 4,000 pounds.

288
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,320
They can reach speeds
of up to 35 miles per hour...

289
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,120
Mon coeur...

290
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,960
would you like me to change it?

291
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,970
You talked to me.

292
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,880
- She talked to me.
- That's talking?

293
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,470
Well, she communicated anyway.

294
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,640
- She likes Shark Week?
- I'll call BuzzFeed.

295
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,430
I wonder if she lived by the water.

296
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,570
You know, you can't fool me.

297
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:32,110
Who is she? What does she want?
Why is she here?

298
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,910
She could be the key to it all.

299
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,990
- That's what you think?
- No, that's not what I think.

300
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,620
Yes, you do. It torments you. It's okay.

301
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,620
Listen, I got one word for you.

302
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,920
It's a sure-fire way to solve this puzzle.

303
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,080
Once and for all.

304
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,340
Tell me.

305
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,550
Mesmer.

306
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,510
Mesmer?

307
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,380
You want help from a Supe?

308
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,090
He despise Vought, hates them,
hates the other Supes.

309
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,720
And the enemy of your enemy...

310
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,060
Frenchie, what part of "you're burned"
do you not understand?

311
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,770
Come on. It's a quick trip.

312
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,440
She and I will hide in the van.

313
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,900
Let's go. In, out, boom, bing.

314
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,820
Boom, bing? Look, I'll
tell you what I can do.

315
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,150
I can... possibly...

316
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,820
tattoo "fuck no" on your ass.

317
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,910
Come on.

318
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,820
Best I can do.

319
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,330
You know...

320
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,000
I've seen you eat ice cream.

321
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,040
- My God.
- Chunky Monkey, I believe.

322
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,750
- Where is this going?
- Well, you know,

323
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,750
you take a spoonful, a chunk of fudge.

324
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,050
But then I see you
with the surface is uneven.

325
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,880
So what do you do?
You take another scoop,

326
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,720
you try to even it out, which, tragically,
creates a corresponding divot.

327
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,550
Ultimately, there is only
but one choice for you, no?

328
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,350
To consume the entire pint.

329
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,640
No, you don't want to,
you don't want to.

330
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,890
But you must.

331
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,480
And I tell you why, my friend,

332
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,770
because you cannot bear things
out of order.

333
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,400
And she...

334
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,570
She's out of order.

335
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,200
All right. You want to tell me
where we're going?

336
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,290
You don't do it anymore.

337
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,590
- What?
- You know that feeling you get

338
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,960
when you tip your chair back too far,

339
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,670
and you catch yourself
just before you fall?

340
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,590
Yeah?

341
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,180
You used to look like that all day long.

342
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,680
But now look at you,

343
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,180
neck-deep in shit, cool as a cucumber.

344
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,400
You ain't half the twat
I thought you were, Hughie.

345
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,770
You know, you're always calling
people "cunts" or "twats."

346
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,030
But I never really got
how that's an insult.

347
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,650
They're flexible, take a pounding,

348
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,780
and they're the reason behind, like,
98 percent of my life decisions.

349
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,870
You're doing good, Hughie.

350
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,080
And you're a good cunt.

351
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,840
Well, here we are.

352
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,920
Church?

353
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,300
Seek and ye shall find, my son.

354
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,550
Come on.

355
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,970
Some days are harder
than others, obviously.

356
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,650
You know, the other
day, I wanted to talk

357
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,270
to my friend about
all this, but I couldn't.

358
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,360
That's why this group is so great.

359
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,820
It's so important.

360
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,450
I know it's wrong to feel angry.

361
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,370
After all, Tek Knight saved me.

362
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,370
I just wish he'd been a little more gentle
with my spine.

363
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,250
It's about acceptance, isn't it?

364
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,500
Letting go. Moving on.

365
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,970
Seth, you're up.

366
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,980
- Hey. Hey, everybody.
- Hey, Seth.

367
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,270
So I'm kind of a writer.

368
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,560
I work in marketing.

369
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,440
There's this one hero,
who shall remain nameless,

370
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,900
but has ice powers.

371
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,660
Ice Princess.

372
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,410
I'm not allowed to say.

373
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,750
Anyway, she took a liking to me.

374
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,830
It was heady, man.

375
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,000
Intoxicating.

376
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,210
No one wants to fuck the writer.

377
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,420
Needless to say, I fell for her, bigtime.

378
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,970
What kind of nobber falls for a Supe?

379
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:26,300
Anyway, we were, you know, being intimate,

380
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:30,560
when she climaxed
and accidentally turned into ice.

381
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,390
Just for a second,

382
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,810
but I was...

383
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,530
still in there,

384
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:41,280
at negative 346 degrees.

385
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,490
Same temperature as liquid nitrogen.

386
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,200
As you can imagine...

387
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,120
it snapped off.

388
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,590
The crazy thing is, I still miss her.

389
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:02,050
It's like, that's the
cost of a mortal like me

390
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,090
for being with a god like her.

391
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,890
If a Supe done that
when she was happy,

392
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,890
imagine what one would do if she found out

393
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,770
you'd been lying to her from the get-go?

394
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,480
Excuse me.

395
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,480
- You have something you'd like to share?
- No, no. Apologies.

396
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,030
Please do continue the Ice Capades.

397
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:26,450
We don't make jokes or judgements here.

398
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:29,780
Why don't you take the talking stick
and tell us your story?

399
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,660
Nah, I'm good.

400
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,870
You know, I've seen guys like you before.

401
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,170
I seriously doubt that.

402
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,880
The smirk, the jokes,
it's all a defence mechanism.

403
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,920
But you don't have to do that here.
This is a safe space.

404
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,600
I said I'm good. Time to move on.

405
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,060
Go ahead, Seth. Give him the stick.

406
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:58,900
You, back off, or I'll shove this stick
where your dick used to be.

407
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,740
You're a bunch of pathetic
Supe-worshipping cunts.

408
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,530
I bet you'd thank a Supe if they shat
on your mom's best china.

409
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:11,330
Did it ever occur to you
that they split your spine

410
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,450
or broke your dick just for a laugh?

411
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,460
Where's your fucking rage?

412
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,880
Your self-respect?

413
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,960
Sitting here in your little share circle.

414
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,380
Having a little whinge and a moan.

415
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,890
Fuck "letting go."

416
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,140
You should be out there
with a fucking chain saw,

417
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,220
going after them!

418
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,270
Just a bunch of scared
fucking rabbits.

419
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,520
Supes are all the same.

420
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,190
Every fucking one of them.

421
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,610
He's...

422
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,030
Sorry.

423
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,040
Ms Stillwell, hey,
you wanted to see me, right?

424
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,040
Yeah, I'm running late.
Can you walk with me?

425
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:03,590
Yeah, sure.

426
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:06,920
Hey, look, I brought a little present
for your little guy.

427
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,090
Never too young to start
saving the world, right?

428
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,010
I'm gonna need you to
make a public apology.

429
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,850
And you're going to be taking
a sabbatical from the Seven.

430
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,310
- What?
- We are going to be stationing you

431
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,440
in Sandusky, Ohio for a while.

432
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,860
Okay, okay, look, I know my brain wasn't
in the right place, but my heart was.

433
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,570
And it's just that damn Oceanland.

434
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,650
- They wouldn't...
- This is not about the dolphin.

435
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,490
This is about Starlight.

436
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,950
Starlight? What are you...?
What about Starlight?

437
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,160
Everybody seems to want to know
who she was referencing in that speech,

438
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,120
and it is not going away.

439
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,580
It's only a matter of time
before she, or, let's be honest,

440
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,790
some of the other women, speak up.

441
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,550
- So we need to get ahead of it.
- Okay.

442
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,220
There may have been
a misunderstanding, I know that,

443
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,220
but can't you just...

444
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,390
you know, handle it? Like you do?

445
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,930
This is the way we are handling things now.

446
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,520
I'm in full support of women

447
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,480
and their ongoing bravery in speaking out.

448
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,320
I'm sorry. Let me start that over.

449
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,830
I'm in full support of women
and their ongoing bravery...

450
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,620
Fuck, I'm sorry.
Yeah, let's just cut. I'm sorry.

451
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,040
Scene take two. Alpha mark.

452
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,250
Starlight, I hope you can forgive me.

453
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,420
- Harder to sell.
- To sell it. Yeah.

454
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,840
- A little harder.
- Perfect.

455
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,550
Speaking out.
We can all become stronger...

456
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,180
by listening. Okay.

457
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,140
I realise that my behaviour has
caused Starlight a great deal of pain,

458
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,930
and I sincerely apologise for this.

459
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,940
Though at the time I believed
that our encounter was consensual,

460
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,980
I now realise that I misread the moment...

461
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,230
Our new movie, Insurrection,
it's really exciting.

462
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,070
It's my first movie with the...

463
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:55,200
in the Vought Cinematic Universe, the VCU.

464
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:00,080
New York. The hearts of 7 million
men and women beat inside this city.

465
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,040
But there's only one person
who can see inside their hearts

466
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,460
and read their minds.

467
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,960
This man is the rapist.

468
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,260
There are no secrets from me.

469
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,880
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you.

470
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,840
Okay. "There are no secrets from me."

471
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,590
- There are no secrets from me.
- There are no secrets from me.

472
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,930
Hey.

473
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,970
What number am I thinking of?

474
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,430
Eight sixty-seven?

475
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,810
Fucking amazing.

476
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,900
This guy's fucking amazing.

477
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,150
So, what am I thinking of?

478
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,820
I'm thinking the same thing.

479
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,530
Cool.

480
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,570
- Now, why don't I put this down?
- Okay.

481
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,030
- Yeah. Okay.
- Cool.

482
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,040
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

483
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,200
- Mr Mesmer.
- Just Mesmer.

484
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,830
No "mister" necessary.

485
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,960
- You know, I'm a big fan, man.
- Thanks.

486
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,130
- Weren't you in Teenage Kix with A-Train?
- Yep.

487
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,250
Yeah. Yo, A-Train's
really blown up, hasn't he?

488
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,050
- He's doing his thing.
- Yeah, I'm really happy for him.

489
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,470
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

490
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,180
You a fan of the show?

491
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,100
Nah, man. I've never seen it.

492
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,810
- Okay.
- You know what I'm a fan of?

493
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,310
Your insider trading.

494
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,150
The way you brushed your hand
up against that Wall Street guy?

495
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,900
Brother, that shit right there,
now, that was ruthless.

496
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,240
Vought dropped you
like a hot potato afterwards,

497
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,700
which I think is some bullshit,
but with the SEC coming...

498
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,240
Who the fuck are you?

499
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,490
Why don't you take a peep and see?

500
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,960
How do you know about Cleo?

501
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,220
There are no secrets from me.

502
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,840
Well, I work for Child Services.

503
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:24,220
My colleague Tina, she owes me a favour.

504
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,810
See, she, just like I,
believe in second chances.

505
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,520
Cut the shit.

506
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,230
I lost custody three years ago.

507
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:34,610
Nobody believes in second chances
for fuck-ups like me.

508
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,700
She's waiting on you.

509
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,250
Tina. Hey.

510
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,250
- Hi.
- It's good to see you.

511
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,290
Good to see you, too.

512
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,090
Five minutes. Next time you owe me.

513
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,840
I do.

514
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,220
Hey, Cleo.

515
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,560
You remember your old man?

516
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,180
Hi, Charles.

517
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,030
I'm sorry that...

518
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,950
I'm gonna try and be
in your life a little bit more.

519
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,750
Would that be okay?

520
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,000
I guess.

521
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,460
Okay, Cleo.

522
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,550
We got to get back.

523
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,300
- Bye.
- Hey...

524
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,930
I just...

525
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,640
I just want to know you don't hate me.

526
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,610
I don't really know you.

527
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,240
Hey, wait...

528
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,290
So you can know me a little better.

529
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,870
I don't have a DVD player.

530
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,460
Bye.

531
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,920
Thanks again. I'll call you next week.

532
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,840
Okay. You all right?

533
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,180
I can see her every month?

534
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,190
One hour, supervised. You clean?

535
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,190
- I can be.
- Good.

536
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,190
Who do you want me to read?

537
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,320
What are we doing here?

538
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,580
My wife, Becca, used
to hum the Spice Girls.

539
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,960
Drove me round the fucking bend,
you know.

540
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,460
All day long,

541
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,170
walking around the house, humming.

542
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,880
She was happy.

543
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,840
Now, fuck know why she was happy with me...

544
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,010
but she was happy.

545
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:27,990
Homelander raped her.

546
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,960
Jesus.

547
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,550
I'm sorry.

548
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,310
Not long after that,
she came and sat right here.

549
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,360
I know this because she got tagged
in that security camera right there.

550
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,410
She sat here for three hours.

551
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,750
Didn't move a muscle.

552
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:24,550
Then she just got up and walked away.

553
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,800
That was eight years ago.

554
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,220
And nobody's seen her since.

555
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,560
Either Homelander killed her

556
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,690
or she killed herself. Same difference.

557
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,820
You see,

558
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:56,540
I know what it's like to lose someone.

559
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,580
You and me, we're in this together.

560
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,920
For Robin...

561
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,840
and Becca.

562
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:18,850
That is why you can't allow yourself

563
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,770
to be distracted by another bird.

564
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,320
Especially not a Supe.

565
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,620
Just remember...

566
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,120
who your friends

567
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,380
and who your enemies are.

568
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,950
That is gonna kill somebody
when it lands in Boston.

569
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,790
Look, I heard what happened.

570
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,920
I am so, so sorry.

571
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,130
What kind of place did you grow up in?

572
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,090
Well, I moved around a lot,

573
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,260
so, it was a bunch of condos.

574
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,550
So, what if I took you to a house

575
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,970
you'd never seen before, full of photos
of parents you never met,

576
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,600
toys you never played with,

577
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,900
Hardy Boy books that you never read?

578
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,860
And then I asked you

579
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,700
how much all that fake
fucking bullshit meant to you?

580
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:00,370
How would that make you feel?

581
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,290
I wouldn't like that.

582
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:10,340
I'm really sorry about the blanket.

583
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,460
It never should have been there,

584
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,510
and Randy Set-Dec
has already been terminated.

585
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,760
But right now...

586
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,680
we need to finish that tour

587
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,900
and to show how down-to-earth
and ready to serve you are.

588
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,780
And I need you to tell the mother story.

589
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,030
Please.

590
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,780
Please do it for me.

591
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,500
It was actually my mom who dragged me along

592
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,040
to my first Little League practise,

593
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,290
and pretty soon after that,
I just loved the game

594
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,630
more than anything else in the world.

595
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,590
So every year
she would bake me a birthday cake

596
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,430
in the shape of a baseball diamond.

597
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:05,770
And... I got to tell you, it was perfect.

598
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:06,770
Perfect.

599
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:10,690
Everything, down to
the last minute details.

600
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,570
Just like her.

601
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:19,570
Cut. Perfect. So great.

602
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,530
- So we're done?
- Yes.

603
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,030
Great.

604
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,840
So...

605
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,340
- she can't talk or won't talk?
- That's what you're gonna tell us.

606
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,140
Anything in particular you want to know?

607
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,890
- Everything there is to know.
- Well, that narrows it down.

608
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,350
Mon coeur...

609
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,310
will you come?

610
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,940
Have a seat.

611
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,940
It's okay. Have a seat.

612
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,660
Gentle.

613
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,040
Yeah.

614
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,310
- Jesus fucking...
- Goddamn it.

615
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,270
- Relax!
- No.

616
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,480
Everyone relax!

617
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,280
- Just go walk it off.
- Walk it off?

618
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,150
She broke my fucking wrist!

619
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,990
She didn't intend any harm.

620
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,120
Could have fooled me.

621
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,330
- Get out! I'm going to the hospital.
- Not till we get what we came for.

622
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,210
- Fuck you! The session's over!
- Sit down!

623
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,250
Okay, listen.

624
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,290
I was a field medic.

625
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,170
Don't look at her. Look at me.

626
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,470
I can patch you up better than any of those
oxy junkies in the ER,

627
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,590
or I can break your other wrist.
You decide.

628
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,350
Good. Now, do you have
any bandages or a splint?

629
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,730
No, I don't have a goddamn splint!

630
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,360
It's Butcher. Be quiet.

631
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,990
- Butcher.
- Where are you?

632
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,450
Shake Shack.

633
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,780
Really?

634
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,950
Fucking magic, that place.

635
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,450
- What'd you get?
- ShackBurger,

636
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,410
cheese fries,

637
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,710
- cookie dough concrete.
- Sounds good.

638
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,000
Does it taste like lies?

639
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,090
I got your phone linked
to my Find-Your-Shithead-Friends app.

640
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,210
Now, where the fuck are you?

641
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,640
Yes, this... This is a superhero.

642
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,980
- This is good.
- Okay.

643
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,190
- We just keep...?
- Yeah, yeah.

644
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:00,570
Well, people are always
asking me, you know,

645
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,190
what it's like to live with my co-workers,

646
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,610
and the truth is, we're all great friends,

647
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,280
you know, behind the scenes
just as much as we are to the...

648
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,660
Hey, Elena.

649
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,080
- Hey.
- This is my friend.

650
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,620
I left a pile of messages for...

651
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,580
Yeah, that's what we are. We're friends.

652
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,650
Can you ask them to
turn that off, please?

653
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,300
I'm gonna need
five minutes, okay?

654
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,130
Yeah, we're doing a reality show.

655
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,930
- That's invasive.
- What are you even doing here?

656
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,180
I would never turn up to your work.

657
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,600
- I was worried about you.
- I had a bad night.

658
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,690
This Teflon shit,
it might work for everybody else,

659
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:39,150
- but not with me.
- Will you keep your voice down?

660
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:42,150
Just tell me what's going on.

661
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,490
Did you ever think that...

662
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,110
maybe I was just looking for a hookup?

663
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,570
I know you think you know me...

664
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,620
- I used to.
- Yeah, used to. I've changed.

665
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,830
Yeah.

666
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,120
I still know you.

667
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,830
- Come on.
- Afraid to be seen with me.

668
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,420
Afraid to ask for help.

669
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,340
Just... afraid.

670
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,270
Are you filming, Courtenay?

671
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,650
I told you to turn
the fucking cameras off!

672
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,900
We cut. We cut a while ago.
We're setting up a shot for later.

673
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,070
- Fucking bitch.
- B-roll on the building.

674
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,860
All right, you can cut it, guys.

675
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,860
It's okay.

676
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:30,990
Everything is okay.

677
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,040
Gentlemen.

678
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,540
Wow, Mesmer.

679
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,380
Hello.

680
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,840
Big fan.

681
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,670
Be with you in a minute.

682
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,260
Well, now we got to kill him.

683
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,220
No, we don't have to kill him.

684
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,050
Look, we made a deal with the guy.

685
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,680
If he keeps his trap shut,
he gets to see his kid.

686
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,640
He's just a dad with his kid.

687
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,350
He's a fucking Supe with a kid.

688
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,480
What the fuck were you thinking
coming here?

689
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,230
- You know better than that.
- Sometimes you get further

690
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,860
with people by treating them like people.

691
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,200
Nice decor.

692
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,450
'80s serial killer. Love it.

693
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,870
All right, then, let's get cracking.

694
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,060
There's a camp in a jungle.

695
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,600
She's a soldier.

696
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:49,530
There's a flag
with a two-headed snake on it.

697
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,820
Two-headed snake?

698
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,910
Like...?

699
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,990
Yeah.

700
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,030
- With red rays behind it?
- What does that mean?

701
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:01,120
It's the flag of the Shining
Light Liberation Army. Frenchie...

702
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,960
you're dating a terrorist.

703
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,670
Is this true?

704
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,960
There must be more to all of this.

705
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,830
She can't be a terrorist.

706
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,170
Yeah, well, you just fucking
keep her under control.

707
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:34,010
Okay, so they smuggle in
a top-shelf extremist recruit

708
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,470
and pump her up with Compound V.

709
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,930
When she's ready,
they cut her loose to wreak havoc.

710
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,220
- She wouldn't.
- Wait.

711
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,260
Why would Vought give
Compound V to terrorists?

712
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,100
Because the only thing
more dangerous than a terrorist

713
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,480
is a Supe terrorist,
and the only way to fight it...

714
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,690
Is with Sergeant Fucking Homelander.

715
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,360
Got to let the cunts in the Army now.

716
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,530
Those fuckers are creating super villains.

717
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:57,400
And maybe there's more of them,
God knows how many.

718
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:58,320
Holy shit.

719
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:00,990
Okay, this is a clusterfuck, even for us.

720
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:03,790
No, listen to me, okay?
Maybe that's what they want her to be.

721
00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:05,950
But that's not who she is.

722
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,000
- That's not what she wants.
- And you know this

723
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,460
because she bends your ear off?

724
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:12,380
She saved my life! She's not bad.

725
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,960
She just want to go home.

726
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,260
She's a fucking Supe, just like the rest.

727
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,430
How many times do I have to fucking say it?

728
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,810
Mon coeur, I know you understand me.

729
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:27,810
Please. Please.

730
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:29,310
Tell them who you are.

731
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:30,730
Tell them what I see.

732
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:42,660
No.

733
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:16,320
The drawings are palm trees in front
of the moon. It's where she grew up.

734
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,360
They killed her parents.

735
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,240
They kidnapped her and her brother.

736
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,990
Forced them to be soldiers.

737
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:32,830
No, Kimiko...

738
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,210
You eat it.

739
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:38,800
She just wants to go back
and get her brother out of there.

740
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,760
Her name's Kimiko.

741
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:52,140
Kimiko.

742
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,150
Bonjour, Kimiko.

743
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:08,620
All right, take her back to the safe house.

744
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:11,620
Where you headed?

745
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,750
I'm gonna go see Raynor.

746
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:16,960
We've got more than enough
to get the feds onboard now.

747
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,550
You tell anyone what you saw
or heard here today,

748
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:27,760
and I'll cut your hands off
and shove them so far up your ass,

749
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,560
your fingers will give us a little wave
out your throat, yeah?

750
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,980
Fuck off, wanker.

751
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:44,200
Some controversial news today
as the Deep went public with his apology.

752
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,070
I realise that my behaviour

753
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,330
caused Starlight a great deal of pain...

754
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,330
and I sincerely apologise.

755
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:55,080
Fuck you, fish dick!

756
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:58,590
Keep speaking your truth!

757
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,880
I'm in full support of women

758
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,470
and their ongoing bravery...

759
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:06,760
Never got the point of these.

760
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,010
To me, they always looked like
Granddad's bollocks flopping in the wind.

761
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:15,600
Do you have the Compound V or not?

762
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,810
I've got the Compound V...

763
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:21,900
proof that Vought's injected babies
right across the country,

764
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,570
and something even more fucking diabolical.

765
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,150
Worse than dosing babies?

766
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,370
Let's just say, with these cunts,

767
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:30,080
there ain't no rock bottom.

768
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,080
Let's get it to the lab...

769
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,160
Not so fast.

770
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:40,500
First things first?

771
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,250
A list of your demands.

772
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,010
How in character.

773
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:49,680
Exorbitant salary. Same for your team.
Office space,

774
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,350
in the Flatiron Building, no less.

775
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:53,470
Security clearance. Indemnity clause.

776
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,020
Legal protection.

777
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,850
A formal guarantee
that Homelander will be prosecuted

778
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,900
under the full extent of the law.

779
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,360
Any of that a problem?

780
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,490
No, gonna pass it up the chain.

781
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:07,490
And while they hash it out,

782
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:10,120
you and I go forward on good faith.

783
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,490
I'm fresh out of good faith.

784
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:18,250
Now, you and I both know
that you can rubber-stamp all of that.

785
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:20,040
So what's it gonna be...

786
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,250
deputy director?

787
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:23,250
I can give you...

788
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:26,550
everything you want on this list...

789
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:28,970
Except?

790
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:31,390
Except Homelander.

791
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,980
You know what he's done.

792
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,360
I sympathise.

793
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:53,780
I really do.

794
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,660
- But it's suicide.
- Yeah, well,

795
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,900
that's a small fucking
price to pay, isn't it?

796
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:58,540
Not for you.

797
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:01,330
For thousands of people
if you push him too hard.

798
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,380
You're fucking scared.

799
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,340
I'm fucking terrified.

800
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,840
And you should be, too.

801
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:14,970
Butcher!

802
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:18,140
Butcher!

803
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,750
This small-town girl next door

804
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,870
wanted to change the world.

805
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,290
Since when did hopeful
and naive become the same thing?

806
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,550
But the world had other plans.

807
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,420
Starlight, I hope you can forgive me.

808
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:52,880
Battered and beaten,

809
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:56,640
a phoenix rose from the ashes
with a message so loud,

810
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:01,350
so raw, it couldn't come forth
as anything less than a roar.

811
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,190
Witness her power.

812
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:05,440
Hear her truth.

813
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,770
And I'm done taking any more shit.

814
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:12,610
Watch her stand up and
fight back for all of us.

815
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,780
Citizen Starlight,
coming this fall from Vought.

816
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:19,160
The house always wins.

817
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:25,920
I'm sorry.

818
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,030
I know you want to go back to your brother.

819
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,530
But the people who did this to you...

820
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:01,080
You know, they might be doing it to others.

821
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,830
We can use your help stopping them.

822
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:14,380
It's your choice.

823
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:18,720
You give me a nod, and we go
to the airport right now.

824
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,030
No. Baby, why you want to do me like that?

825
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,580
Because if you watch that episode
of Downton Abbey,

826
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,080
then I'm gonna be one behind

827
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,620
and we're not gonna be able
to binge watch together.

828
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,920
Just hold off until I get home.

829
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,630
There's a fight in the yard, baby.
I got to go. All right.

830
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:54,840
How'd it go with Raynor?

831
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:57,550
No dice.

832
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,010
What?

833
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,470
Said she got cold feet.

834
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:03,260
Well, why?
Did you tell her everything?

835
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:06,430
Yeah, I laid it all out,
even the sample of V.

836
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,980
Said she couldn't fucking authorise
that kind of action against Vought.

837
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,150
Too much of a risk.

838
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:15,530
Did she?

839
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,070
Fucking spineless cunt.

840
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:19,030
So we are royally fucked.

841
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:21,990
No, we ain't.

842
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,160
Fuck them. We don't need them.

843
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:30,580
We got everyone and everything
we need right here in this room.

844
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:34,050
We'll take down Vought ourselves. Yeah?

845
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,010
Where's Hughie?

846
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,060
This is Tina Mitchell,

847
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,140
Department of Child Protection
and Permanency.

848
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,850
Leave a message.

849
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:50,520
Tina, it's Mesmer.

850
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,810
You met me earlier.

851
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:59,490
Cleo didn't really want to see me today.

852
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:02,620
She was just being polite.

853
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,790
I'm pretty good at
reading stuff like that, so...

854
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:10,330
You don't have to call me,

855
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,960
or any of that anymore.

856
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:16,170
Just, it's okay.

857
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:19,420
Just... Just... please...

858
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,140
look after her.

859
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:25,050
Thank you.

860
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,400
I'm sorry. The elevator was out.

861
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:42,820
You probably don't remember,
but we've met before.

862
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,200
- I would never try and read you.
- Let's be clear.

863
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:52,870
I don't know you, and I don't want to.

864
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,590
A-Train said
that you have some information.

865
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:59,630
Yeah, we... We go back
to the Teenage Kix days.

866
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,670
- We still keep in touch.
- Golly gee shucks.

867
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,050
What makes you think I would
give two fucks about that?

868
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,970
Now, do you have something
for me or not?

869
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,350
Yeah.

870
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:17,320
He said you were looking for a
French guy... and a black guy...

871
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:20,110
a skinny white guy,

872
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:21,940
British guy.

873
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:25,110
Where are these from?

874
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,490
Shitty little $85 camera
I put in my doorbell casing.

875
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:33,370
I know there's no reward, but I was hoping
you could put in a word for me at Vought.

876
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,460
I'll take any posting.

877
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,920
Low five-figures would be fine.

878
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:44,090
I just want to be one
of the good guys again.

879
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,530
That's my phone.

880
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:06,160
I mean, I don't remember,

881
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,830
but my mom said that when I was born,
I almost blinded the doctor.

882
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:15,000
So, I had powers from the start. Why?

883
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:18,130
No, no, I'm just curious.

884
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,760
Do you mind if we just...

885
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,590
not talk about hero stuff tonight?

886
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:26,720
Yeah, yeah. Bad day at work?

887
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,930
Yeah. It's an understatement.

888
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,600
You know,

889
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:36,850
there's this beach in the Bahamas
where the sand is pink,

890
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,440
like, cotton-candy pink.

891
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,320
What's it called?

892
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,730
Pink Sands.

893
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,990
It's not the most creative name,

894
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:48,570
but... let's just go.

895
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,910
Yeah. No, I can learn
how to play the steel drum.

896
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:53,580
You can get cornrows.

897
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:54,830
How about tonight?

898
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:56,120
Book that ticket.

899
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,090
Are we talking about this?

900
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,970
I don't know. I...

901
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:07,340
I just know that...

902
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,470
for me, New York has been such
an endless shit show.

903
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,680
Except for you.

904
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:20,770
Somehow, in the middle of it all...

905
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,490
you found me.

906
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,140
Hughie.

907
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,690
I thought that was you.

908
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:03,270
I apologise.

909
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,770
I didn't mean to interrupt.

910
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,980
No.

911
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:07,990
Hi, I'm Annie.

912
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:10,490
Billy. Old mate of Hughie's.

913
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:13,700
Boy, you really have a lot of friends
showing up here.

914
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:16,160
Yeah. Seems like it.

915
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:20,370
You're that new girl
in the Seven, ain't you?

916
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,330
- Guilty.
- Wow, it is a pleasure to meet you.

917
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,630
And I must say how marvellous it is

918
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:27,880
that so many more women are
in positions of power.

919
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,630
You know what I mean?

920
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,890
You know, if I'm perfectly honest,

921
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:36,600
Translucent's always been my favourite.

922
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,680
What's he up to?

923
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,480
I think he's on a mission.

924
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,440
Yeah, I think I read that, actually.

925
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:44,810
He's been gone a long time,
though, hasn't he?

926
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,190
I do hope he's all right.

927
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:52,990
You know what?
I'm gonna go get us a pitcher.

928
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:54,200
Billy, you like...

929
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,660
Let me guess. Guinness?

930
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:57,950
I like what you like.

931
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,080
All right. Be right back.

932
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,420
- Well, well, well.
- Butcher...

933
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,840
She's quite tasty up close and personal.

934
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,210
- I get what you see in her.
- That wasn't what...

935
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,170
I thought we had an understanding.

936
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,380
We do. We do.

937
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:15,220
- It... It's not what...
- Not what it looks like?

938
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,720
Because from where I'm sitting,
it looks like

939
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:20,560
you've got your tongue halfway down
the opposition's throat.

940
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,850
She is not the opposition.

941
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,190
She's a good person, okay?

942
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:28,690
I mean, she could help us.

943
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:31,110
- Help us?
- Yeah.

944
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,570
And what do you think she's gonna do

945
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,450
when she finds out
you murdered Translucent?

946
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,080
When she finds out?

947
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:48,590
Give her my best.

948
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:55,470
Where'd your friend go?

949
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:57,490
