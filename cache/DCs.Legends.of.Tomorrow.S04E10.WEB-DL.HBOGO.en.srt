1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,920
I have to keep you safe. Go!

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,520
You've had Mona in custody
this whole time?

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,720
You have the Kaupe too?

5
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,240
Sara, you need
to bring in that fugitive

6
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,600
before someone gets hurt.

7
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,480
Step away from the creature, miss.
You murdered him.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,240
Today I asked you for one thing.

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,720
- Ava, don't do this.
- Just go.

10
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,560
So I'll head to The Bureau
and do some digging?

11
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,920
Hank is torturing prisoners off site.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,360
Keep digging.
I want to know everything.

13
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,280
What do you mean
you couldn't capture the asset?

14
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,920
<i>Blame it on your son's
time traveling pals, sir.</i>

15
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,440
<i>Let me just say this</i>

16
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,160
<i>and I want to say this
for the television news.</i>

17
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,840
The people have a right to know

18
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,160
whether or not
their president is a crook.

19
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,760
Well, I am a crook.

20
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,120
Oh, actually felt good
to get that off my chest.

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,800
What other secrets
have I been holding back?

22
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,560
Yes, despite the constant
reassurances of my wife

23
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,560
I know that I'm certainly
only an adequate lover.

24
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
<i>Mr. President!</i>

25
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,080
<i>The President won't be taking
any more questions at this time.</i>

26
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,480
That is more about Tricky Dick
than I ever needed to know

27
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,280
<i>And it's more than the public
needed to know.</i>

28
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,720
<i>In the days following
the news conference,</i>

29
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,920
<i>Nixon found himself
unable to tell a lie</i>

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,560
<i>resulting in global chaos.</i>

31
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,960
Nixon's blathering fouled up

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,840
ongoing peace talks
and trade agreements.

33
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,840
Without the release
of "All the President's Men"

34
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,480
Robert Redford's career floundered.

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,160
What? No Redford?

36
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,960
No Sundance, no indie film,
no artful nudity.

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,480
We have to fix this!

38
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,720
The only thing nastier
than a politician lying

39
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,520
is when he says how he really feels.

40
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,840
Now, there's no way
he'd tell the truth

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
without a magical assist.

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,480
I hope the Watergate has vacancies

43
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,960
because we need to make sure
that Nixon still cheats the press.

44
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,560
Captain's orders and all
but do you think

45
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,000
it's really the best time
to be back on mission?

46
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,240
Yeah, I mean, it might do
well to take a beat.

47
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,240
I appreciate your concern
but I'll be fine.

48
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,520
Just because Ava and I
had a disagreement

49
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,080
doesn't mean that I can't do my job.

50
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,960
I was actually talking
about the fact that

51
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,440
we're on the outs
with the Time Bureau.

52
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,320
Yeah, and I was talking about Mona.

53
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,960
I mean, Hank's gonna be
after us since her boyfriend

54
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,320
offed that agent and well,
we can't just stash her here forever.

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,440
Right, well, it has been eventful

56
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,400
but things are gonna blow over
with The Bureau.

57
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,200
We'll find a safe place for Mona.

58
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,640
And in the meantime

59
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,080
I feel like we should be doing
what we do best.

60
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,800
- Am I right?
- Right.

61
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,840
Save Redford and independent film.

62
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,480
That's the spirit.

63
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,720
- Done it for worse reasons.
- Why not?

64
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,080
Director Sharpe. You look terrible.
What happened?

65
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,560
Joke acknowledged, Nathaniel
but tighten up.

66
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,240
{\an5}Director Sharpe is taking
a leave of absence

67
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,320
{\an5}to get her priorities straight.

68
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,240
{\an5}I'll be acting as Director
of the Bureau.

69
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,040
Wait, so you're gonna be
in charge from now on? That's...

70
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
- Great.
- It's great.

71
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,440
{\an5}Looking forward to working with you,
Director Heywood.

72
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,200
{\an5}Glad to have you on board,
Agent Tomaz.

73
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,360
Though my first job
is a sensitive one.

74
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,200
I need to catch the Legends.

75
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,840
This is the last time they will
thumb their nose at authority

76
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,240
and get away with it.

77
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,080
I know they're your friends

78
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,480
so if you want to sit this one out...

79
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,760
No, no, Dad. You know what?

80
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,160
- We have your back.
- Agreed.

81
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,360
{\an5}I stand by the Time Bureau
and by my man.

82
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,480
Thank you, babe.

83
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,200
{\an5}Glad to hear it. We'll pinpoint
the location of the Waverider

84
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,600
and pay it a visit.

85
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,920
{\an5}We'll meet in the situation room,
0900.

86
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,280
Yes, sir. Copy that.

87
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,240
{\an5}We need to expose
what Hank's up to before

88
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,720
he drops a hammer on the Legends.

89
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,760
Did you just call me "babe"?

90
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
Well, yeah, I was riffing.

91
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,600
{\an5}I was trying to keep
this thing afloat.

92
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,440
{\an5}Anyways, now that
we are stuck with Hank

93
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,640
we can't go through
his phone ourselves.

94
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,760
{\an5}With Ava gone, there's no one
here left to trust.

95
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,560
{\an5}Well, there's one person
we can trust.

96
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,520
Gary, we need to talk.

97
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,920
Is this about what happened
between Sara and Ava?

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,200
Wait, you're working at The Bureau?

99
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,640
Yes, and...

100
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,000
I need you to do something for me.

101
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,320
And you're my boss

102
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,840
{\an5}which is great, you know,
I'm happy for you.

103
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,840
- No one deserves it more.
- Damn it, Gary.

104
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,160
Focus.

105
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,080
Hank is causing total chaos here.

106
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,320
{\an5}Did you notice him using
Director Sharpe's mug too?

107
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
You know, I was gonna say something.

108
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,400
It goes much deeper than that.

109
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,640
Mona was right.

110
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,720
Hank is running some secret project.

111
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,080
{\an5}And now that he's in charge
of The Bureau

112
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,760
he's trying to shut down the Legends.

113
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,160
Nate and I cloned his phone.
We're gonna keep him busy.

114
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,320
You need to go through his activity

115
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,920
find out what he's been up to,
so we can end his time at The Bureau.

116
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,840
{\an5}Use this to stay in touch
without being monitored, okay?

117
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,320
{\an5}I've always wanted
to untangle a conspiracy.

118
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,600
{\an5}I'll need a bulletin board,
index cards.

119
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,360
{\an5}I already have yarn.
I've been getting into crochet.

120
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,440
- Yeah, me too.
- We should start a club.

121
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,880
We'll talk.

122
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,360
Okay.

123
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,080
Konane, no!

124
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,880
Kid. You okay in there?

125
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,520
{\an5}Sorry, I, never used
a future tech toilet before.

126
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,200
So many buttons.

127
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,120
Give it time.
You'll learn to live with it.

128
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,640
Oh, don't touch the red button.

129
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,360
Oh, Captain, I wanted to talk to you.

130
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,800
Good. I need to talk to you too.

131
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,760
{\an5}So as far as The Bureau's concerned,
you're a fugitive.

132
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,760
{\an5}I need you to stay on the ship
and not draw any attention.

133
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,440
It's not just that.

134
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,520
When we were in Mexico...

135
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,960
{\an5}No, when we were in Mexico,
a man got murdered by Konane

136
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,400
{\an5}because you said we could trust him.

137
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,240
No, Konane didn't...

138
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,920
he didn't mean to.

139
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,960
{\an5}Look, Mona, whatever it is,
it's in the past.

140
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,440
{\an5}Now it's on to the next problem.
That's how this works.

141
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,840
Mick, Nixon's supposed to give his
"I'm not a crook" speech tomorrow.

142
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,800
We need him back
to his lying self by then.

143
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,640
You and John stay on the ship,
look after Mona

144
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,160
make sure she doesn't get
into any trouble.

145
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,160
Make sure she doesn't touch
that red button.

146
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,240
I'm telling you, I'm not crazy.

147
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,800
{\an5}In fact, I've never
felt better in my life.

148
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,000
That's the truth.

149
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,440
{\an5}- Here that?
- The truth.

150
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,600
{\an5}Something is very wrong
with the President.

151
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,040
And he's supposed to be at
Disney's contemporary hotel

152
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,200
to address the entire
American press corps tomorrow.

153
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,600
We'll, we'll take care of it.

154
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,600
- I'll update the VP.
- All right, sir.

155
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,960
We'll, start off
with a little sedative.

156
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,520
Don't know why you lot
are relying on my powers.

157
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,000
They're still all mucked up.

158
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,360
Look, it'll be fine.

159
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,680
We'll get him to the ship,
fix what's wrong

160
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,880
and we'll be right back.

161
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,120
Now, let's see your Nixon impression.

162
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,800
Nice.

163
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,120
- We got the cargo.
- We're on our way.

164
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,560
{\an5}Well, let's figure out
what loosed his tongue

165
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,280
{\an5}and get the hell out of here,
shall we?

166
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,960
Listen, you guys can't be here.

167
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,200
- The Bureau's onto you.
- Good.

168
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,360
- Time for a pig roast.
- No one's roasting anyone.

169
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,400
And it's not just The Bureau.
It's my dad and he's got backup.

170
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,760
- Go.
- No, not again.

171
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,440
Guys, we're working on
stopping Hank for good.

172
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,880
In the meantime, you need to find
the team and stay ahead of him.

173
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,000
On it.

174
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
What's going on?

175
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,960
Nate's old man commandeered the ship.

176
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
There they are!

177
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,520
All units, converge on my position.

178
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,560
Okay, take the stairs. Get Nixon.

179
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,880
Ignissa.

180
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,960
<i>We have eyes on the Legends
and they have the President!</i>

181
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,160
They've gone too far, again!

182
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,360
Siri what, Alexa Gideon!

183
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,760
Fire up the engine.

184
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,840
Legends must have bricked the ship.

185
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,280
Oh, they think of everything.

186
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,200
Nicely done.

187
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,680
I want our men watching
every time jump,

188
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,320
listening to every comm.

189
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,760
How are we going to make
distance with five of us

190
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,880
and a kidnapped Nixon?

191
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,320
There. There's our getaway.

192
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,800
That's a bit on the nose, no?

193
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,520
We left subtlety back in Mexico.

194
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,760
Got to go.

195
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,400
<i>The Legends are in the wind,
Director.</i>

196
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,760
- Damn it!
<i>- They must have stolen</i>

197
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,160
<i>a vehicle and hit the road.</i>

198
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
You know what?

199
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,480
I've never needed a Waverider before
and I don't need one now.

200
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,560
You give me a dragnet.

201
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,400
I want agents at every rest stop,
diner, store along the highway.

202
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,600
Move.

203
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,520
And you, set up a police scanner.

204
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,440
If the Legends so much
as forget to signal,

205
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,840
we'll hear about it.

206
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,040
They'll slip up eventually.

207
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,880
That's probably accurate.

208
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,040
Okay.

209
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,760
Captain, you should know that

210
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,360
me and tight spaces might not mix.

211
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,440
Do you think any of us
want to be stuck in the RV?

212
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,160
Punch buggy. No punch backs.

213
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,880
Mona, the team's back
is up against the wall.

214
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,360
And right now,
you are a part of this team.

215
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,400
And if you want it to stay that way,
then you need to help

216
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,920
not create more problems.

217
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,800
- Okay.
- Great.

218
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,920
<i>Bob is struck with appendicitis
on an all new "The Waltons."</i>

219
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,960
<i>For all you lonely hearts
on the road today</i>

220
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,760
<i>here's a tune just for you.</i>

221
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,720
You know, I've never been in a car
that's a room before.

222
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
Patricia.

223
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,680
No, I'm not Patricia, Dick.

224
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,080
Camera.

225
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,800
Not to bother you
but we've lost the ship

226
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,400
drugged the President
and I'm stuck in the back with her.

227
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,640
- Now what are we gonna do?
- We are going to Disney World.

228
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,840
Yawn. Haven't we been
tortured enough?

229
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,600
I mean, we are going to fix Nixon

230
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,800
in time to get him to Florida
to lie his ass off.

231
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,040
We are not gonna let anything stop us
from what we set out to do.

232
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,200
Mick, watch our tail.

233
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,280
John, see if you can figure out
what's wrong with Nixon.

234
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,040
And Mona, find us something to wear.

235
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,160
Charlie.

236
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,920
We forgot Charlie!

237
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,800
Oh, "We'll be right back," they said.

238
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,440
Yeah, bloody right.

239
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,720
Mr. President?

240
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,760
Oh, no, no, no. Okay.
Mr. President?

241
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,520
Quick, quick, quick, Charlie.

242
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,000
Mr. President, are you okay in there?

243
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,440
Just checking in, Mr. President.

244
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,040
You check in again, you'll be lucky
to be guarding a shopping mall.

245
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,160
- Okay, make your next left.
- Okay.

246
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,000
No, your next right.

247
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,880
Hey, guys?

248
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,920
Looks like Nixon over there

249
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,920
is finally winning The War on Drugs.

250
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,240
Good God, I've been
kidnapped by hippies.

251
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
What is it you want?

252
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,200
Money? Power? I'll do anything.

253
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,880
Look, we're...
we're here to help you.

254
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,240
Let's talk about money.

255
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,360
You know, right now
we're your best shot

256
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,320
at getting back to your right self.

257
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,800
Oh, let's have a look.

258
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,080
Now, I have my suspicions
as to what's got at ya.

259
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,760
Yep, okay.

260
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,640
Vi veri universum vivus vici.

261
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,560
What the hell are you babbling about?

262
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,200
It's a roach. I've been bugged.

263
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,920
This is an agent of Ma'at,

264
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,920
the Goddess of truth
in the Egyptian pantheon.

265
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,440
You see, the creature,
it feeds off lies.

266
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,800
And whoever it eats at has nothing
but truth left to tell.

267
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,400
No wonder it found its way to Nixon.
You must have been a feast.

268
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,000
- No, no, no oh.
- Sorry.

269
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,880
Put him in the closet.

270
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,680
- Come on, Dicky.
- Yeah.

271
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,760
- Let's put Dick in a box.
- Okay.

272
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,800
Captain? Can we talk?

273
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,280
A lot's been going on
and, and a truth roach

274
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,480
well, that's gonna be a wrinkle.

275
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,040
Look, Mona, I have a really
big responsibility for you.

276
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,960
I need you to watch the roach.
Me? But...

277
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,480
Your job was to take care
of creatures, right?

278
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,720
Who better than you?

279
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,280
Hey, little guy. Bet you're hungry.

280
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,600
Hank Heywood.

281
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,640
Renewed his Bestflix subscription...

282
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,960
December 16th, Hank Heywood...

283
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,720
November 27th, Hank Heywood...

284
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,160
So that means...

285
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,840
Oh, my God, how did this happen?

286
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,240
I am way out of my league.

287
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,200
What is it, Jerry?

288
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,000
No, it's... it's Gary.

289
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,840
I notice you're reading
"Body of Proof" by Rebecca Silver.

290
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,840
Is that a conspiracy thriller?
Book club's at capacity.

291
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,160
No, no, that's not it. It's...

292
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,760
I need your help uncovering
a conspiracy.

293
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,880
- Why would I help you?
- Because you might be in trouble.

294
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,920
Hank has his agents taking fugitives
out of their cells at night

295
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,120
and I don't want you to be next.

296
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,360
So I thought if I release you
for the night

297
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,520
maybe you could help me?

298
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,400
Hey, you okay?

299
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,760
It's not easy being trapped somewhere

300
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,440
where no one will listen to you, huh?

301
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,600
Hey, can you hear me?

302
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,240
You probably need air.

303
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,360
Oh, no, no, no.

304
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,480
What's going on?

305
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,720
Oh, I just dropped it but it's okay.

306
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,000
It got it.

307
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,840
What, what's wrong with the brakes?

308
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,080
Can't slow down! can't slow down!

309
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,560
Move your get our foot, Ray.

310
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,400
Got it.

311
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,480
- Who called the cops?
- Cops?

312
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,320
I've never been pulled over before.

313
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,920
- What do I do?
- You just pull over.

314
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,600
- Okay.
- Just be cool. You got this.

315
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,560
Good afternoon.

316
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,640
Good afternoon, officer.

317
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,040
By the looks of your driving,

318
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,680
you're having a fine afternoon.

319
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,280
What is it? Drinking? Drugs?

320
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,640
No, sir, no, sir, no, sir,
we're just...

321
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,080
just driving and having a little
steering wheel problems.

322
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,720
Tell me some more about
this steering wheel trouble.

323
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,520
Oh, well, it's a real doozy.

324
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,320
So I'm here with my family
and we're on our way

325
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,360
to North Carolina to see
the largest chest of drawers.

326
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,520
Ray.

327
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,360
So the steering wheel
was a little loose

328
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,960
and so I turned to my wife

329
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,120
Claire and I said...

330
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,920
My friends and I here
are time travelers.

331
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,440
We've kidnapped Nixon
and we're headed to Disney World.

332
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,040
Like I thought.

333
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,800
You're high as a Good Year blimp.

334
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,240
I'm calling this in.

335
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,920
Get this out of me.

336
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,800
I veri universum vivus vici.

337
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,680
How'd it even

338
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,480
Mona!

339
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,720
<i>I'm at exit 244.</i>

340
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,080
<i>I've got an RV full of hopheads</i>

341
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,520
<i>- who claim they're from the future.</i>
- See?

342
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,240
Come on, son. Let's go grab
our guys the old-fashioned way.

343
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,760
Wait, I tuned this to a frequency
Hank can't read.

344
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,080
And I think I know a way
to contact the team.

345
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,960
It's a little old school
but it should work.

346
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,200
I'll be in touch.

347
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,280
I can't have a ticket on my record.

348
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,480
I can't have a ticket on my record!

349
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,680
Yeah, well, nabbing
Nixon's gonna give you

350
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,760
more than a bloody ticket, mate.

351
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,360
Gun it! I'm bored.

352
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,560
He's right. Gun it.

353
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,840
- But then we'll become fugitives.
- We're already fugitives!

354
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,080
Go!

355
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,040
Hey! Get you come back here!

356
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,240
Officer, we heard
your report from up high.

357
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,480
Where are the offenders?

358
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,320
I was fixing to call it in.

359
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,200
You let them get away?

360
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,440
You're gonna have to find
another way home

361
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,480
because that's my car now.

362
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,200
There's a new sheriff in town.

363
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,320
Let's ride.

364
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,920
Nice moves, Palmer.

365
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,680
They're gaining.

366
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,080
Yeah, and I don't think
that's the cops on us, mate.

367
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,480
Hey! This car has no airbags
or traction control.

368
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,120
Exactly. Nothing but pure V8 power.

369
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,200
Okay.

370
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,600
We got to lose Hank.

371
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,680
You got something for this, John?

372
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,440
I might but I'll need you to get us
off the road quick, squire.

373
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,040
Absconditus Domus.

374
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,480
Where the hell did they go?

375
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,800
<i>Nothing to see here.</i>

376
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,560
What was with the radio?

377
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,800
<i>The heat's heavy
on the highway tonight</i>

378
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,880
<i>and that's no weather report.</i>

379
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,080
<i>Lucky for you, you're not alone</i>

380
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,280
<i>because you got DJ Z to guide
you past those bad vibes.</i>

381
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,200
DJ Z? That sounds like Zari.

382
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,320
Right now, the beat
on the street is to lay low.

383
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,320
But while you park it,
here's a hit to keep you safe.

384
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,760
All right, you heard her.
We should keep a low profile.

385
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,560
If we leave by night,
we should be able to make it.

386
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,240
In the meantime, no drawing attention
and no altering the timeline.

387
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,480
Well, we best keep
that bug bottled then, aye?

388
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,960
The only way to keep it
contained is for everyone

389
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,920
to stay completely honest.

390
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,160
What the hell is going on here?

391
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,640
Checkers.

392
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,320
Maybe it's best
if we all just don't talk.

393
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,960
Now we just enter a command line
to a mirror site

394
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,680
and we can get into his email.

395
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,560
This email is linked
to a private server.

396
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,520
Must be where he's got his dirt.

397
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,760
We need a password.

398
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,440
Or, we can reset it.

399
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,120
I forget my passwords all the time.

400
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,320
Those memory flashers
have a lot of side effects.

401
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,800
Password reset question.

402
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,240
We'll need some personal
info from Hank.

403
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,080
What's the word? Sorry Gary.

404
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,400
<i>- What's the word?</i>
- I need some scoop on Hank.

405
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,760
<i>Stand by, Gary.</i>

406
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,440
<i>Hey, Nate, we need to know
the name of your dad's</i>

407
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,600
<i>childhood pet.</i>

408
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,000
<i>And whatever you do,
keep your dad off the FM.</i>

409
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,520
I'm on it, Z.

410
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,240
That's a pretty cool trick.

411
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,000
You drink a lot of Cokes
when you were a kid?

412
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,160
Yeah.

413
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,960
My mom used to give me
a quarter for the corner store

414
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,200
<i>let me pick out whatever I wanted.</i>

415
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,280
With her raising me on her own

416
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,680
a quarter was more than I even knew.

417
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,480
You don't really talk
about your childhood much.

418
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,040
Like, I'm not sure
I know where you were born.

419
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,360
Hackensack, in New Jersey.

420
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,480
Like the Billy Joel song.

421
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,080
We should turn on the radio.

422
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,520
1973, great year for music.

423
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,800
Actually,
why don't, why don't we talk?

424
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,800
You know, get to know each other.

425
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,560
You're right, Nathaniel.

426
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,520
You could call me Nate.

427
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,200
Did you have a dog?

428
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,160
A lab.

429
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,720
Yeah, named him Silver.

430
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,760
- After the Lone Ranger's horse. Yes.
- Yes, yes, yes.

431
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,800
You used to show me old episodes.

432
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,480
Well, at least
I taught you something.

433
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,920
You know, my mom used to
take me on road trips,

434
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,640
stop for ice cream.

435
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,160
Without Dad around,
she really had to play both roles.

436
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,760
She didn't know
how to be a father, but...

437
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,920
she did her best.

438
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,200
Guess I could say
the same for myself.

439
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,040
It's nice we get to make up
for some lost time, hmm?

440
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
But we should get back to the ship,

441
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,520
see if Zari's back online.

442
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,240
Actually, why don't we forget
the Legends for a minute

443
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,600
and go get some ice cream?

444
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,320
Fine idea, Nathaniel.

445
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,320
Nate.

446
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,640
<i>Hey, Gary? The answer is Silver.</i>

447
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,520
Silver. I'm in!

448
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,920
Hackers do say that in real life.

449
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,360
What is this?

450
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,840
Property deed in Hank's name
from 1912?

451
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,640
What's this shipment for dwarf
star alloy from 1837?

452
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,440
He's using time travel
for personal gain?

453
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,400
That is against Bureau creed.

454
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,000
I have a copy in my wallet.

455
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,480
Someone's coming.

456
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,440
Who was that?

457
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,360
Are you okay?

458
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,840
You have to take this to Zari
and stop digging.

459
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,800
I'll go back to my cell.

460
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,040
And Gary...

461
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,400
be careful.

462
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,880
I got an alert that someone

463
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
recovered your password
from the Time Bureau

464
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,520
and they're accessing your accounts.

465
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,800
But who would...

466
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,120
how would they even...

467
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,240
Thanks.

468
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,880
It won't happen again.

469
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,800
You know, I was just thinking
that even though

470
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,920
we've had some setbacks

471
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,920
that this road trip has really been
a great bonding experience.

472
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,440
I think you're an idiot.

473
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,840
Well, look,
we've dealt with a lot lately

474
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,640
and I think this is a very needed
chance for us to sit

475
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,040
and really talk about how we feel.

476
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,560
Well, I'm glad you're happy.

477
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,160
No, wait, I mean...

478
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,440
I don't give a damn if you're happy.

479
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,520
And I certainly don't trust you lot
in helping me face Neron

480
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,760
no matter how many "go team"
pep talks you give.

481
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,360
Well, you can't keep me down!

482
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,200
Actually, ever since I met you

483
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,200
I sometimes lie awake at night

484
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,680
staring into the dark thinking
I am it and it is me.

485
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,560
Also, I don't think Han shot first.

486
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,800
I'm gonna go sit up front.

487
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,880
Also I used the strategy guide

488
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,080
to beat the Water Temple
in "Legend of Zelda."

489
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,520
Also, I really like gluten.

490
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,040
Well, I think it's a cool look

491
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,120
but the whole loosened tie
is a little try hard.

492
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,640
Yeah, well, you know, it's not like
I went and loosened it myself.

493
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,160
Yeah, well, at least
I don't go make up my own

494
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,440
silly superhero names like
"Atom" and "Heat Wave".

495
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,320
Like I care what you think.

496
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,160
I want to grow my hair out
and look like Fabio.

497
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,840
Yeah, that think that would be good.

498
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,960
So honestly,
even as much as I trust Sara

499
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,040
this has been one disaster
after another

500
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,800
and I really think that this time
we are totally screwed.

501
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,440
Captain, we're okay, right?

502
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,200
I mean, we just have to focus
on the mission.

503
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,960
Yeah, Mona. We're gonna be fine.

504
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,880
Of course we're not fine, Mona.
Nothing is fine.

505
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,240
And I am definitely not fine.

506
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,120
Ava and I didn't just get
into an argument.

507
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,680
She asked me to leave.

508
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,840
And she hasn't answered
any of my calls since.

509
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,680
And she was my one chance,
my one chance, Mona,

510
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,960
at something real.

511
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,960
And now I don't have a ship.

512
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,040
I don't have a girlfriend.

513
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,240
And I am the Captain of an RV
and it is all your fault!

514
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,680
Well, I won't be your problem
anymore.

515
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,600
Mona!

516
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,200
Mona, wait!

517
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,880
Mona, come back!

518
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,920
Mona, come back!

519
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,040
Look, I meant everything I said

520
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,560
but if you stay here in 1973,
you'll never survive!

521
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,000
John, get this thing out of me.

522
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,960
Vi veri universum vivus vici.

523
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,800
All right. You guys,
get Nixon to Florida.

524
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,360
If you leave now,
there'll be time to spare.

525
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,440
What about you?

526
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,840
Mona's out there alone
and we don't leave our people behind

527
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,920
no matter how much
they bug the crap out of us.

528
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,200
I'd say no pun intended
but that would be a lie.

529
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,320
- Hey, mate. Hold that.
- What?

530
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
What, where are you going?

531
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,280
Oh, I just need to stretch my legs,
squire.

532
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,360
You all right, Dad?
You didn't finish your ice cream.

533
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,360
Put on your seat belt.

534
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,320
What's the hurry?

535
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,400
The Legend's RV was spotted
just outside Richmond.

536
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,720
My men are setting up a blockade.

537
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,400
They won't get away this time.

538
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,160
That's great.

539
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,040
That's great!

540
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,080
You know,
this is what I dreamed about

541
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,200
when I joined The Bureau.

542
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,560
Stealing a cop car?

543
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,800
You and me working together.

544
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,720
- Yeah.
- Oh.

545
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,520
Oh, you know what?

546
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,880
Oh, dad, that ice cream
is not agreeing with me.

547
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,760
Can you, can you pull over?

548
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,000
<i>Z, Z, can you hear me?</i>

549
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,680
Nate, is that you?

550
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,480
Listen, I need you to warn the team.

551
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,680
Hank's got a blockade on
the highway north of Richmond.

552
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
They got to find another route.

553
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,640
<i>- You got it?</i>
- Roger. Over and out.

554
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,800
There you go, hon.

555
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,600
All right, what do you want?

556
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,120
- Whatever's fast and cheap.
- No, no, please no.

557
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,000
Can I get six Daphne House
burgers and a round of sodas?

558
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,080
Coming up.

559
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,560
Sara, hold up.

560
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,400
Hey!

561
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,520
How do you even know
where she went, aye?

562
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,080
Bike treads went this way.
We passed a diner a while back.

563
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,480
She's probably headed there.

564
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,440
Go ahead.

565
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,200
I know you've been dying
to say I told you so

566
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,680
so just do it.

567
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,000
It's quite the opposite, actually.

568
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,840
It's I wanted to see
how you're holding up.

569
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,480
Honestly I'm freaking out.

570
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,160
With the Kaupe dead
and Mona in the wind

571
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,480
and then there's Ava and...

572
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,280
What happened?

573
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,440
II went to go talk to her and

574
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,880
and I thought everything
was going to be fine

575
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,600
because it's always fine
and it was bad, John.

576
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,840
Look, I just I don't know
how to convince everybody

577
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,400
that everything's okay
when I'm not okay.

578
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,840
Well, you know, if we were in
each other's shoes right now

579
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,560
then you'd be giving me
some rubbish speech about

580
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,120
about how you don't have
to shoulder the burden myself

581
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,280
when I have friends around me
to help me carry it.

582
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,480
Not that I believe you for a second

583
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,920
but that doesn't mean it's not true.

584
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,240
Thanks

585
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,520
even if you're just lying
to make me feel better.

586
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,040
Oh, I definitely am.
Hope it worked, though.

587
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,520
You all right there?

588
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,680
Yeah. I'm... I'm great.

589
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,480
- Let's grab some tunes.
- Oh, no, no.

590
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,680
Hey.

591
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,440
<i>I just got a white hot tip.</i>

592
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
The voice sounds familiar.

593
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,840
I don't recognize her or him.
I don't hear gender.

594
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,640
<i>There's a smoky checkpoint
outside Richmond.</i>

595
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,480
<i>If you want to make it
to your final destination</i>

596
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,280
<i>do yourself a favor
and take route 301</i>

597
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,880
<i>all the way home, bandit.</i>

598
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,440
Sounds like we're taking a detour.

599
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,920
Dad, dad, dad!

600
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,320
Are you insane?
You could have got us killed!

601
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,440
You're still here, ain't you?

602
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,080
Yeah, but we're going the wrong way.

603
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,160
Nope, we're right on target.

604
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,400
All units, Legends
are headed down route 301.

605
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,480
Reroute all units to converge
on their location now.

606
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,360
Come on, I'm not gonna miss
a chance to get back

607
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,840
at the Legends for Mexico.

608
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,920
They're gonna get what they deserve

609
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,840
for trying to protect
that wolf bastard.

610
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,560
His name was Konane.

611
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,320
What?

612
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,440
Wait, I remember you.

613
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,280
You're the one Director
Heywood fired.

614
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,080
You're the reason that mutt got out

615
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,960
of the containment facility
in the first place.

616
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,480
I said, his name was Konane.

617
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,760
There's Mona's bike. Where is she?

618
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,600
Where is everybody?

619
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,400
Yeah, I know this kind of quiet

620
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,200
and it never means anything good.

621
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,400
Everybody out!

622
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,120
- Mona.
- I'll do it. I'll shoot!

623
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,120
The Kaupe must have scratched her.

624
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,800
Oh, she tried to tell me
and I didn't listen.

625
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,520
- Mona, put him down!
- Come on, love, this isn't you.

626
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,360
- Stop the RV!
- Step out of the vehicle!

627
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,880
What are we gonna do?
We can't drive through them.

628
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,320
- Kill them. Kill them all.
- What?

629
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,720
- No.
- Yes.

630
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,160
- No!
- Yes!

631
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,680
Oh, Nate's here.
I'm sure we can talk this all out.

632
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,200
Do you want to do the honors, Son?

633
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,000
Damn right, Dad. All right!

634
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,640
Don't worry, buddy.
I'll get you out of this.

635
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,600
Mr. Heywood,
if we could just talk about this

636
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,720
I'm sure we can explain and show you

637
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,080
how this is just one
big misunderstanding.

638
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,360
How's that for a misunderstanding,
you pig?

639
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,640
By the power vested to me
by the United States government

640
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,280
I hereby arrest both of you

641
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,680
on five charges of treason,
two of conspiracy...

642
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,840
Sir?

643
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,880
- Mr. President? Are you all right?
- No!

644
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,840
These two men and their
coconspirators kidnapped me.

645
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,120
They've besmirched my good name
and I've done nothing to deserve it.

646
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,440
Oh.

647
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,040
Well, actually, there is nothing
good about my name.

648
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,000
If you were born with the name
Dick Millhouse,

649
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,240
you'd grow up to be a bastard too.

650
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,640
What the hell?

651
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,360
Listen to me, Mona.

652
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,480
No one else needs to get hurt.

653
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,040
Funis Captis.

654
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,840
I am sorry about that, love.

655
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,240
Bloody hell.

656
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,240
Mona, can you hear me?

657
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,200
Come on, I know you're in there.

658
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,840
It's me. It's Sara.

659
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,400
I told you, Sara,
I remember everything.

660
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,440
You pretended to be a friend!

661
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,680
- I looked up to you!
- Mona.

662
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,120
It was all lies.

663
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,480
Mr. President, what is going on?

664
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,040
I don't know but I'm supposed
to be in Florida,

665
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,240
lying to the press.

666
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,240
He ingested a truth bug.

667
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,160
See, these blunders
are the exact reason

668
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,040
why we should lock up the Legends.

669
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,120
Nathaniel, are you all right?

670
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,920
No, I'm not.

671
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,800
I've been keeping secrets from you.

672
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,320
You think I don't know that?

673
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,960
But it's more than your secret
Pentagon side project.

674
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,040
It's always been like this, Dad.

675
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,480
The, the lying
and the hiding of the feelings.

676
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,880
Now that I'm getting to be honest,
I just want to tell you

677
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,880
that I love you but you just
make it so damn hard.

678
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,640
Look, son, you don't understand.

679
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,640
And I like working with you
at the Time Bureau side by side.

680
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,080
I've never felt closer to you.

681
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,000
But now I'm having, like, a hard time
even looking in your face.

682
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,280
Just tell me why.
Why are you doing all this?

683
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,240
Why are you pretending
that we are on the same side?

684
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,400
I can't.

685
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,160
But everything
I've done has been for you.

686
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,040
And the fact that it's hurting you,
Nate, it's killing me.

687
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,240
But I want to make this right.

688
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,400
Okay.

689
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,480
You let the Legends walk.

690
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,080
That, or you lock me up too.

691
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,680
Because if you don't trust them,

692
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,600
then you and I are not
on the same side.

693
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,040
Stand down.
The Legends are free to go.

694
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,240
From now on, we work together.

695
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,440
No more lies.

696
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,920
Watch yourself, love.
She's not in her right mind.

697
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,560
Oh, that's the problem.

698
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,240
She is.

699
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,840
Mona, look, please stop.

700
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,840
I should have never
blamed you for everything.

701
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,480
Look, Ava, the ship, Konane,
none of it was your fault.

702
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,560
And I am so sorry that I told you
to ignore your feelings.

703
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,080
It was because I thought...

704
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,200
look, I thought that
if I could forget the way

705
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,840
that I was feeling, then maybe
it wouldn't hurt so bad.

706
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,800
Look, Mona. I was wrong.

707
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,880
I was so wrong.

708
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,160
And you don't have
to bury your feelings.

709
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,040
You can let them out.

710
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,640
And if you ever need
a shoulder to lean on

711
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,040
I will be there.

712
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,280
You promise?

713
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,040
I promise.

714
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,200
- Are you guys okay?
- Yes, no, I don't know.

715
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,880
First time in my adult life
I told my dad I love him.

716
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,640
Years of therapy couldn't even
get me to do that.

717
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,080
Hey, speaking of, I love you so big.
I love you so big.

718
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,560
I love you so big.

719
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,840
Look, I don't always
agree with you but

720
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,000
if Nathaniel trusts you

721
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,520
then so do I.

722
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,320
You're free to fly if you can get
that ship of yours working.

723
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,120
<i>Someone ask for lift?</i>

724
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,760
Ship was never broken was it?

725
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,280
Nope, it was Zari the whole time.

726
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,240
- Is she even your girlfriend?
- Nope, but I'm open to it.

727
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,240
- Fat chance.
- Come on your poor bastard.

728
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,440
Let's delouse you and get that truth
bug contained for good, yeah?

729
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,880
And Nixon here has an important
speech to deliver.

730
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,160
Let's get you back to Orlando.

731
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,640
You know, the truth really
does set you free.

732
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,600
After spending a few days
with all of you,

733
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,360
I know that I can be a better leader

734
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,840
and even more so, a better man.

735
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,840
History needs you crooked, Dick.

736
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
Who are you?

737
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,440
I really think I'm gonna
miss this thing.

738
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,560
Yeah, if I had to be
stuck on a road trip

739
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,200
at least it was with you guys.

740
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,160
You know,
maybe that's what family is.

741
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,960
The people you don't mind
being annoyed by.

742
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,520
So you don't mind
being annoyed by me?

743
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,400
Are you saying I can stay?

744
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,280
We could always use
another shoulder to lean on.

745
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,040
Besides, you're not
the first magical creature

746
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,520
that we've taken in.

747
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,800
We forgot Charlie!

748
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,640
Nate, hold up.

749
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,000
Gary surprisingly
got to the bottom of things.

750
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,320
It's not good.

751
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,680
Your dad's embezzling funds

752
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,320
for some black site
operation in Baltimore.

753
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,080
But he's not just
taking the fugitives

754
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,760
he's testing on them.

755
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,000
- But why?
- I don't know.

756
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,480
But I've seen this before
with A.R.G.U.S.

757
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,320
This is what they were doing to metas
to turn them into super soldiers.

758
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,000
You okay?

759
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,680
Yeah.

760
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,920
Now I know who my father really is.

761
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,080
Hank says he's doing this for me,

762
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,720
but I want nothing
to do with it or him.

763
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,960
Hey, I'm sorry.

764
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,680
Yeah.

765
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,920
You called.

766
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,400
A little late for a meeting.
This better be good.

767
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,480
When you came to me

768
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,960
I agreed to this plan

769
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,560
because I saw the potential
in your vision and I still do.

770
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,000
Don't tell me you're having
second thoughts.

771
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,520
I mean no disrespect.

772
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,520
I value the work that we've done,

773
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,680
and I understand why it needs
to remain top secret.

774
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,920
But I have a new partner now.

775
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,240
My son.

776
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,520
And I can't let anything
come between us.

777
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,680
What are you saying, Henry?

778
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,920
I'm saying that
I don't need you anymore.

779
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
If that's the case,

780
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,160
I don't need you anymore either.

781
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,000
No!

782
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,760
You have to let me out of here.

783
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,720
You got to let me out of here!

784
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,760
Gary! Anybody!

785
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,240
No, no, no!

786
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,800
No, no!

787
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,920
Someone help me!

788
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,200
No. No, no, no.

789
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,360
- No, no, no.
