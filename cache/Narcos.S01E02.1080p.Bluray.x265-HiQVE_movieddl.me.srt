19
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,363
By the time I left Miami,

20
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,842
Americans were doing a couple hundred tons
of cocaine every year.

21
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,450
To satisfy American noses,
the narcos ramped up their operations.

22
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,967
- Here, honey.
- Ah, thank you.

23
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,050
- Hey, is that the Bahamas?
- Hm?

24
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,085
Oh... Yeah.

25
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,049
That's beautiful.

26
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,484
They were flying so many planes,

27
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,882
they needed a refueling stop
between Colombia and Miami.

28
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,964
So Carlos Lehder
bought an island in the Bahamas

29
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,731
as a transshipment point
for the drugs and money.

30
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,567
Turns out...
it was a damn good place to party.

31
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,162
It was modern day Sodom and Gomorrah,
with the three things Carlos liked most:

32
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,768
- sex, drugs, and Nazi sympathizers.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

33
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,729
Let's get down!

34
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,686
The problem was
no longer demand... it was supply.

35
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,286
We should be over the Amazon by now.

36
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,088
From 10,000 feet, Colombia
was a paradise of untouched rainforest.

37
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,602
But things were different
on the ground.

38
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,406
Pablo and his partners built superlabs
the size of small cities.

39
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:28,721
From leaf to paste to powder,
they produced 10,000 kilos a week.

40
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,847
At 50 grand a kilo,
that's five billion dollars a year.

41
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,161
These guys weren't fuckin' around.

42
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,126
Pablo's cousin Gustavo flew chemists in
from Germany to liquefy the cocaine.

43
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,127
They added it to liquor, to coffee,
and just to be funny...

44
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,725
they put it back in Coca-Cola.

45
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,131
¿Patrón?

46
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,201
Looks good?

47
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,681
Cocaine was no longer
hidden alongside products.

48
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,127
This is going
to sell better than the original.

49
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,645
It was the product.

50
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,006
It's time to take Pablo's money.

51
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,527
The narcos even
had their own drug-sniffing dogs.

52
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,531
Gacha bet Pablo that not even
a German scientist could fool his dog.

53
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,728
Search.

54
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,408
What's happening? Look at that.

55
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,529
Your prize dog didn't even stop.

56
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,807
There's no coke in that boat.

57
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,927
Come here.

58
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,929
It's blended
right into the fiberglass hull.

59
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,571
Give me the money...
the cash!

60
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,961
Looks like you got taken
with this dog, brother.

61
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,087
- Hold this a moment.
- Oh, Marquessa, my dear...

62
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,485
it's OK, it's OK.

63
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,009
- Are you fucking crazy?
- What?

64
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,525
It's my dog.

65
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,560
Son of a bitch.

66
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,086
What happened?

67
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,606
You want to know what happened? Go look.

68
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,280
Pablo?

69
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,048
- Pablo, we have a motherfucking problem.
- Bastard murderer.

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,650
- He killed the dog.
- I don't give a shit.

71
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,883
If we don't resolve this problem,
we're all dead. Come on.

72
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,042
- Come on, man.
- Son of a bitch.

73
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,691
Let's see...

74
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,127
This is the problem?

75
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,362
People are watching us, Pablo.

76
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,245
They're asking themselves
how two small businessmen

77
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,688
- suddenly came up with so much cash.
- Gustavo, brother...

78
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,570
just launder the money.

79
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,369
Make it look legitimate...
that's all.

80
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,482
Isn't that what Al Capone did?

81
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,051
- Al Capone?
- Al Capone.

82
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,164
You're a dumb-ass, Pablo.

83
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,641
- Al Capone is a terrible example.
- Why?

84
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,366
Because Al Capone
never had this much cash.

85
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,045
This is too much to launder.

86
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,366
Well, then...

87
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,167
let's buy a bigger washing machine.

88
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,804
And that's what they tried first.

89
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,844
On paper, Pablo had
the most profitable taxi company ever.

90
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,081
He only had three cars,

91
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,528
but he was pulling in
more than five million dollars a week.

92
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,082
And Gacha had the most successful
emerald mine of all time.

93
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,881
He would inject bad stones with oil
to make them shiny,

94
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,651
then have his friends in Miami
buy the emeralds with drug money

95
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,007
and give them as gifts
to hookers in town.

96
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,004
Everybody was happy.

97
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,402
But no matter what they did,
they couldn't hide all that money.

98
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,442
It just kept coming in.

99
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,840
You're spending too much cash, Pablo.

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,288
You have Picassos, Dalis, farms,

101
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,166
houses, apartments, boats, planes, cars...

102
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,011
I told you we have to fly low.

103
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,242
If you keep spending like that,
you're going to end up in Forbes Magazine.

104
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,641
And if that happens,
the government is going to have our asses.

105
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,882
Enough, Gustavo, enough.

106
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,088
What do you want me to say?

107
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,564
Bury it.

108
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,530
- How's that?
- Bury the cash.

109
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,728
And cut the bullshit.

110
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,891
Go on, pussy.

111
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,251
And that's what they did.

112
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,527
They buried it in fields...

113
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,051
they hid it in caletas,
hiding places in walls and ceilings.

114
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,048
They even stuck a million dollars
in Pablo's mother's couch.

115
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,164
Hey, Mom.

116
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,289
- I'm praying, Pablo.
- Just for a second.

117
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,246
Sit.

118
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,362
It isn't very comfortable, Pablito.

119
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,283
I'll buy you another sofa later.

120
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,569
Wouldn't it be better
if you put all this money in a bank, son?

121
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,324
No.

122
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,880
All bankers are bandits.

123
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,485
Really, honey?

124
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,682
Pablo called this accountant "Blackbeard,"

125
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,603
not because he looked like a pirate,

126
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,889
but because his job was to map out
where the treasure was hidden.

127
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,086
But not even the pirate did the trick.

128
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,322
The problem was Colombia itself.

129
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,449
It was too small a country
for a fortune that big.

130
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,606
It was inevitable... someone, somewhere
would try to snatch the narcos' treasure.

131
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,641
Forbes Magazine says...

132
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,847
that the narcos have more money

133
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,003
than the richest capitalist pig
in this country.

134
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,527
Let me see?

135
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,763
If we kidnap someone in their family,
what are they going to do?

136
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,888
Call the police?

137
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,802
Commander.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,404
It says here that Gacha, "The Mexican,"
is the ninth richest man in the world.

139
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,403
I say we kidnap his son.

140
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,207
He's a psycho maniac, comrade.

141
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,369
Plus, he's bought off half the military.

142
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,121
Well, the Ochoa brothers
are number 14 on the list.

143
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,521
Their sister Marta
goes to the university.

144
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,840
How about her?

145
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,366
I like that more.
The Ochoas are soft.

146
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,931
Wait a second.

147
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,963
What about Pablo Escobar?

148
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,929
I know what you're thinking.

149
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,810
No one's crazy enough
to kidnap drug dealers, right?

150
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,531
But if you're thinking that, it's because
you're not familiar with M-19.

151
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,361
M-19 was a communist guerrilla group

152
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,727
made up of college students
and intellectuals

153
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,280
who read too much Karl Marx
for their own good.

154
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,209
Their leader was
Ivan "the Terrible" Torres...

155
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,011
a history professor
who knew nothing about guerilla warfare,

156
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,367
but understood the power of symbols.

157
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,522
He broke into
the Quinta de Bolivar Museum

158
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,650
with his buddy Alejandro
and Alejandro's girlfriend, Elisa,

159
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,089
and stole a national treasure...
the sword of Simón Bolivar,

160
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,051
the mythic general who led Colombia
to independence from the Spanish empire.

161
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,562
These jokers even left a note:

162
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,690
"Bolivar, your sword
returns to the battlefield."

163
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,042
It was a stroke of genius...
a marketing stunt way ahead of its time.

164
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,122
And it made them famous overnight.

165
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,442
And I guess it went to their heads.

166
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,081
What about Pablo Escobar?
He's the richest of them all.

167
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,202
Escobar gives money to the poor.

168
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,608
You're right.
Escobar is a man of the people.

169
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,011
He's all right with me.

170
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,730
OK, then.

171
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,206
Let's do the Ochoas.

172
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,201
March 13th, 1981,
the day they kidnapped Marta Ochoa,

173
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,841
was also the day the Lion
completed 100 trips to Miami.

174
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,605
Hola.

175
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,648
Good afternoon.

176
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,011
- Mr. and Mrs. Murphy.
- Si.

177
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,249
Does the cat have any papers?

178
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,442
- Si.
- Please.

179
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,130
Thank you.

180
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,481
Mm.

181
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,524
Excuse me a second, please.

182
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,610
Sir, this couple has no sanitary B-47 form

183
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,444
and no I-435
identifying papers, either.

184
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,568
Well, I guess he's talking about Puff.

185
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,530
Yes, sir.
They brought an American cat with them.

186
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,290
Sure, but without the I-435, I can't
officially state that it is indeed a cat.

187
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,285
I also can't guarantee
that it's American.

188
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,849
Sir, I'm not trying
to make your life more difficult.

189
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,762
OK, sir.

190
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,367
My boss is not having a good day.

191
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,442
I think his wife left him.

192
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,649
Yeah, well, he's a little bit cranky,
so... how important is this cat to you?

193
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,211
Excuse me?

194
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,004
OK.

195
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,081
Come with me, please.

196
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,521
So... wait here, please.

197
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,445
And my boss will ask you
for this paper later.

198
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,129
How long is it gonna be?

199
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,401
I don't know.

200
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,883
Pablo! Pablo!

201
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,088
While I was trying to get into Bogotá,

202
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,686
Pablo was trying to get into politics.

203
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,810
When he said he was going
to be president of Colombia, he meant it.

204
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,651
- Hello, Pablo.
- Hello, Valeria.

205
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,008
- This is my wife, Tata.
- Hello.

206
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,287
Don't worry.
Everything will be perfect.

207
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,204
I'm just not used
to these type of things.

208
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,725
Just be yourself.

209
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,921
Ma'am, it would be best
if you weren't here.

210
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,166
Look, Tata,
there are a lot of people here.

211
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,083
It might not be good for the baby.

212
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,251
Go to the house.

213
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,401
Where is this guy?
We've been waiting for hours now.

214
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,323
Maybe he's at "terapia de pareja."

215
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,890
What's that?

216
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,371
Couples counseling.

217
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,961
Right.

218
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,331
What're you doing?

219
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,402
Oh, I'm practicing my Spanish.

220
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,931
Welcome to Nuevos Tiempos.

221
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,449
I'm Valeria Velez and I'm here with the
man known as "the Robin Hood of the poor"

222
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,046
for his generosity
with the poor of Medellín.

223
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,282
Yeah, you heard that right.

224
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,081
She just compared Pablo Escobar
to fucking Robin Hood.

225
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,926
And in a way, she was right.

226
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,809
When you've run out of ways
to hide your money,

227
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,326
that's when you give it to the poor.

228
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,448
But I don't want to get ahead of myself.

229
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,201
Tell us about your program,
"Medellín Without Slums," Mr. Escobar.

230
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,284
I was born in Rionegro,
not too far from here.

231
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,082
And I asked myself how a government
that exists for the people

232
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,970
can be so out of touch
with what they need.

233
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,725
Hospitals, social and athletic programs,

234
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,929
plus the construction
of 400 houses in this community.

235
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,971
I hear you told your mother that one day
you would be president of Colombia.

236
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,963
Do you have any political aspirations,
Mr. Escobar?

237
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,443
None at all.
My business takes up most of my time.

238
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,443
I will tell you one thing, Valeria.

239
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:20,721
For decades, our country has been led by
Lopez and other families that are wealthy

240
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,565
who made their fortune
off exploiting the poor.

241
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,970
They don't know what
common people dream of, but I do...

242
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,407
Connie, you know who that is?

243
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,006
Bet he could get our cat
into the country.

244
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,725
I can't believe it.

245
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,961
They don't even know
he's a fucking drug dealer.

246
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,403
- Thank you very much.
- Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!

247
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,729
At the time,
Pablo was just a blip on my radar.

248
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,131
I didn't know
I was about to be a blip on his.

249
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,160
Well, we've been waiting
for hours. Thanks for coming out.

250
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,444
Uh, my wife's a little exhausted,
so here is the cat's vaccination...

251
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,045
Your passport.

252
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,001
I'm sorry?

253
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,883
Your passport, please.

254
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,330
Gracias.

255
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,645
What do you do at
the United States Embassy, Mr. Murphy?

256
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,961
I am in, uh,
janitorial services.

257
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,287
Janitorial services.

258
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,885
Another one.

259
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,487
Your embassy must be very clean.

260
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,321
Oh, yeah.
You bet your ass it is.

261
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,086
Your cat's cleared.

262
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,204
Enjoy Colombia.

263
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,325
And just like that, the narcos
had me on file the very first day.

264
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,003
As for Valeria Velez,

265
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,210
the journalist who first
interviewed Pablo... watch out.

266
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,681
She was as dangerous as M-19.

267
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,483
Does your wife do it standing up?

268
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,849
Aah!

269
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,766
Don't ever disrespect Tata.

270
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,961
Do you hear me?

271
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,327
I'm sorry, Pablo...
I'm sorry.

272
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,205
Forgive me.

273
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,843
It won't happen again.

274
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,081
I promise.

275
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,408
How can I apologize? Huh?

276
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,525
Want to put it in my ass? Hm?

277
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,884
You gotta give it to her.

278
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,043
She saw Pablo coming a mile away.

279
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,284
And she got herself in just the
right place to take full advantage of him.

280
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,331
Not unlike my partner Javier Peña,

281
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,210
who figured the best way
to get inside narco information

282
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,521
was to hang out
with the same women they did.

283
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,641
We get better every time we practice.

284
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,722
You're amazing, Javier.

285
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,605
Well...

286
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,804
don't go overboard.

287
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,564
It's the truth.

288
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,923
What can you offer me to drink?

289
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,287
Whiskey or tap water.

290
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,004
Water.

291
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,370
What you're missing
in this apartment is a woman.

292
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,329
It's fine the way it is.

293
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,602
Well, I wasn't offering.

294
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,286
Here.

295
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,521
If you were a client,
you would have paid me already.

296
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,004
- And you wouldn't know my real name.
- Don't take it the wrong way.

297
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,130
It's cash from Uncle Sam
for the information you never gave me.

298
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,724
Take it.

299
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,805
And my visa?

300
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,965
Give me something I can use
and we'll talk about it.

301
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,002
What are you doing this weekend?

302
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,170
- I'm going to Medellín.
- Work or play?

303
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,963
I have to take care of my child.

304
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,569
I can pay, too.

305
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,606
Those guys are richer
than Uncle Sam, Javi.

306
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,406
Come here.

307
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,202
- What?
- Give me a kiss.

308
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,769
Give me a kiss.

309
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,251
I guess I'll have to find another girl.

310
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,087
Good luck with that.
We're all going to Medellín.

311
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,288
Some of us are even going by plane.

312
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,169
Helena?

313
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,651
Helena.

314
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,050
Whose party is it?

315
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,610
Oh, God! What was that?

316
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,846
That was like a .38.

317
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,888
- About four blocks away.
- Oh...

318
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,525
Welcome to Bogotá.

319
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,410
Should we do it under the bed?

320
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,528
Just one thing...
Who told you about this?

321
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,603
Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

322
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,924
Pablo says they're
not going to pay a dime for Marta Ochoa.

323
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,280
Gustavo, too.

324
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,161
- And Jorge?
- No. Jorge doesn't agree.

325
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,642
- Then what?
- They're all going to a meeting.

326
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,762
At Las Margaritas.

327
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,491
- Everyone?
- Yeah, they'll all be there.

328
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,245
First day at the American Embassy.

329
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,886
- I met my partner...
- Javier?

330
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,167
...who introduced me to the DEA.

331
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,964
Murphy, this is Weaver and Wisnicki.

332
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,008
These guys are R.l .P.
"Retired in Place."

333
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,003
- Eat me, Peña.
- Paid vacation's over, fellas.

334
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,360
Murphy and I are going to Medellín.

335
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,450
We'll telex the T-3 reports.
They go straight to Washington.

336
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,003
We are going to Medellín?

337
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,203
- Then the Mil Group.
- Jarheads... this is Murphy.

338
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,645
Murphy, this is Mil Group.

339
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,242
They advise Colombian military
on communist threats in the countryside.

340
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,731
Hey, those are classified.

341
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,924
- Now they're declassified.
- That's the ambassador's call.

342
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,490
No problem.

343
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,481
And the last stop...
the ambassador's office.

344
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,846
Why do you need this intel?

345
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,884
There's an unusual number of prostitutes
headed to Medellín this weekend.

346
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,650
Every high-end girl in Bogotá.

347
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,882
First class airfare,
five-star hotels.

348
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,162
The narcos are having a meeting
and then a party.

349
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,601
What does the M-19
have to do with this?

350
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,565
Somebody kidnapped Marta Ochoa.
Intel suggests it was M-19.

351
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,564
I need access to the M-19 files
to confirm.

352
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,961
If I find out one single dollar
of American taxpayer money

353
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,442
went to any of those hookers,
it'll be your ass.

354
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,682
OK, thank you.
One last thing, Ambassador.

355
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,966
Yes, Agent Peña?

356
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,766
I'm filing a visa request
for my informant. I need your signature.

357
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,530
You're bothering me.

358
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,563
She sure likes you.

359
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,404
Is your informant really a prostitute?

360
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,244
Everybody works for somebody.

361
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,123
The very next day,
I was flying with Peña to Medellín,

362
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,929
Pablo's home turf.

363
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,330
First stop: Carlos Holguín School,
Colonel Carrillo's base of operations.

364
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,600
- Good day, Major.
- Good day.

365
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,607
Your intel was good. The traquetos
are gathering at Las Margaritas.

366
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,524
I want you
to meet our new DEA, Steve Murphy.

367
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,250
Fresh meat.

368
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,610
Then we went straight to a fancy
hotel where the narcos were about to meet.

369
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,320
The pictures I took that day
helped to ID guys for months to come.

370
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,800
There was Carlos Lehder...

371
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,401
...the Ochoa brothers...

372
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,401
Fernando Galeano,
"the Wolfman"...

373
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,610
Is that Gacha?

374
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,091
I've never seen him
with other traffickers.

375
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,729
And last but not least...
Gustavo and Pablo.

376
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,642
Get pictures of that fucker.

377
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,410
They were all under one roof
and Peña got us there to document it all.

378
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,726
What we didn't know was
that we were witnessing the formation

379
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,882
of the famed Medellín cartel.

380
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,770
Pablo took advantage
of the kidnapping of Marta Ochoa

381
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,242
to bring all the narcos together
for the very first time.

382
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,371
And then he proclaimed himself
their leader.

383
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,529
What I propose at this moment, gentlemen,

384
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,491
is that we form an organization.

385
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:09,603
Pool our resources to train soldiers,
trade knowledge and buy information.

386
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,725
And so the message is clear,
we're going to name our group

387
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,041
"Death to Kidnappers."

388
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,884
What I propose:

389
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,730
I will manage all operational aspects.

390
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,406
All you need to do
is cover my expenses.

391
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,448
What you gentlemen will receive in return:
two things.

392
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,569
One... l promise to end the kidnapping.

393
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,121
Two... and at this moment,
the most important...

394
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,404
I promise to return
Marta Ochoa to her family.

395
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,080
Salud.

396
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,687
Death to Kidnappers!

397
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,130
We knew the meeting was over
when the hookers came to play.

398
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,562
Peña had finally
gotten one of his informants

399
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,563
right into the heart of the action.

400
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,442
Come in! Enjoy! Ooh!

401
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,490
Don't forget La Quica!
Take care of him, too.

402
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,204
Sit down, my love.

403
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,491
- How are you?
- Good. And you?

404
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,528
I like your hat.

405
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,449
It looks good on you.

406
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,964
- Do you think so?
- Yes, it looks good.

407
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,280
Let's see.

408
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,044
Very cute.

409
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,489
She should be here by now.

410
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,965
You think she slipped?

411
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,168
Nah, she's no dummy.

412
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,561
Maybe she's getting pretty for you.

413
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,926
Yeah.

414
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,288
Aah...

415
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,808
Helena wanted a US visa so bad,

416
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,724
she was willing to do anything
to help our cause.

417
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,649
And that was a problem.

418
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,202
- You're tired.
- Hm?

419
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,242
Let me relax you a bit.

420
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,044
So what happened at that meeting
that made you so tired?

421
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,407
What did you hear?

422
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,801
Nothing.
Just making conversation.

423
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,290
They're
telling me the girl left a long time ago.

424
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,763
- She's already dead.
- No, they wouldn't kill her at the hotel.

425
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,569
Then they killed her somewhere else.

426
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,449
She knew the risks.

427
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,488
If we're going back,
we go back now.

428
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,324
I want you to find the girl.

429
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,081
I can pick up a sicario.
You OK with that?

430
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,162
- I'm going with you.
- What about Fresh Meat?

431
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,561
Gonna stick around here
and see if she shows up, OK?

432
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,484
- Yeah, and where are you going?
- We're gonna go look for her.

433
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,085
That's it, guys.

434
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,370
- Guys.
- Hey, what happened?

435
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,681
That little girl doesn't move.
Like a dead cow.

436
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,125
What, did you kill her?

437
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,128
It's my turn now.

438
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,646
Where's the girl?

439
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,644
- Where's the girl, asshole?
- I don't know.

440
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,246
I don't know.

441
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,805
Choke him.

442
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,724
Enough with the party.

443
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,051
I gotta rough this girl up.

444
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,248
Gacha wants to know
if she knows something.

445
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,846
Gacha's paranoid.

446
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,524
Wait a second...
I don't like them bruised.

447
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,007
Let me have a little more fun,
then I'll let her go.

448
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,560
It's all right, boys.

449
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,051
This one's for all of you!

450
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,528
Slap her around!

451
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,605
Any news on the radio?

452
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,241
- Should I tell him?
- No. Remember what Carrillo said.

453
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,288
Sorry, I don't speak English.

454
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,130
- How far is it?
- Come on, you piece of shit.

455
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,763
Helena?

456
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,291
I'm going to get you
out of here, OK? I promise.

457
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,889
All right. She's coming out.

458
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,164
Copy, Major.

459
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,366
Let's go, boys.

460
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,406
Hey, gringo.
Carrillo is calling. Come on.

461
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,207
No habla inglés, huh?

462
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,927
¡Vamos!

463
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,049
Where the fuck's Peña?
¿Dónde está Peña?

464
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,360
Over there.

465
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,322
- How is she?
- Sedated.

466
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,964
- Is she gonna be OK?
- Physically, yeah.

467
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,247
Mentally, I haven't got a fucking clue.

468
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,886
- You left me behind on purpose.
- Look, man...

469
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,281
If we're gonna be partners,
I don't get left behind.

470
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,967
I didn't come all the way down here, Peña,
to sit on the fucking sidelines.

471
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:23,810
Whatever's going on here...
I'm in all the way.

472
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,484
Is that understood?

473
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,840
Understood.

474
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,889
I hope you know what that means.

475
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,649
Pablo's message
to the kidnappers was simple.

476
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:54,681
He was going to kill them, one by one,
until he got Marta Ochoa back.

477
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,685
Ivan "the Terrible" thought he could
hide in the jungle and wait it out.

478
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,809
Sooner or later,
he figured the narcos would cave in.

479
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,329
Big mistake.

480
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,801
M-19 didn't stand a chance.

481
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,130
"Deliver Marta Ochoa
safe and sound... or your family is next."

482
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,163
Signed, "Death to Kidnappers."

483
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,569
Please! Please, let me go.

484
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,161
- Hurry up!
- Please, don't!

485
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,131
Needless to say,
Marta Ochoa was released unharmed.

486
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,049
And the killing didn't stop.

487
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,567
Pablo had tasted blood,
and he liked it.

488
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,207
Tell him to get a little closer.

489
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,965
A little closer. A little closer!

490
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,805
You know what, boss?
Go a little higher.

491
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,962
A little bit higher
and a little bit closer

492
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,963
so you can see the tree!

493
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,571
That's it.

494
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,725
Now a little bit higher
so you can see the little tree!

495
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,330
That...

496
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,885
That's it. Perfect.

497
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,161
DEATH TO KIDNAPPERS

498
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,810
A little more.

499
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,924
That's it! There you go.

500
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,568
- Much better.
- Yes, boss.

501
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,926
Didn't I tell you
not to let anyone into the park?

502
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,162
- I'll take care of it.
- Are you crazy or what?

503
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,208
Stupid asshole.

504
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,049
It's a woman with a baby.

505
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,840
Take a picture
so we can send it to the newspapers.

506
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,081
Do it.

507
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,168
Good day, ma'am.

508
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,445
- Good day.
- I'm sorry, but the park is closed today.

509
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,488
What do you mean the park is closed?

510
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,642
May I escort you out?

511
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,200
Why is it closed?
I come by here every day.

512
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,446
It's because there is a foul odor
and I don't want the child to get sick.

513
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,761
I thought I smelled something.

514
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,251
- Right?
- Yes.

515
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,049
Oh, look,
what a beautiful little baby.

516
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,600
Right, just like his dad.
Thank you very much.

517
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,729
- You must be proud.
- Yes, of course.

518
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,883
My wife and I
are having a baby very soon.

519
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,247
Oh, very good.
Congratulations!

520
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,250
I don't know if it's a boy or a girl,
but as long as it's healthy.

521
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,848
Yes, of course.
The most important thing is health.

522
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,927
Sending the photos
of the hanging M-19 to the newspapers

523
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,771
gave Pablo an image of invincibility.

524
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,091
If he could do this
to the feared communists,

525
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,810
he could do it to anyone.

526
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,971
Ivan "the Terrible"
was quick to realize...

527
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,122
there was only one thing he could do.

528
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,965
Hey, Don Pablo.

529
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,648
What do you want us to do
with this guy?

530
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,804
Should I kill him or what?

531
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,881
From what I can see,
you're not going to stop.

532
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,846
Here I am,
so you can finish what you started...

533
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,961
but with the sword of Bolivar.

534
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,966
It's a very beautiful gift.
Thank you very much.

535
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,841
Stand up.

536
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:11,682
I guarantee no harm
will come to you or your family.

537
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,847
From now on,
we are going to work together.

538
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,006
Go in peace, brother.

539
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,369
Is that what I think it is?

540
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,050
You've gotta be kidding.

541
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,242
I want you
to run my day-to-day operations.

542
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,847
And you'll do what?

543
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,202
Liberate Colombia.

544
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,641
Welcome to the Medellín cartel.

545
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,525
The narcos had their army,
but me and Peña had ours, too.

546
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,331
Many Colombians
like Major Horacio Carrillo

547
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,404
were so invested
in the future of their country

548
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,529
that they were ready
to do whatever it took to fix it.

549
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:54,408
This was a war that would shake
an entire country to its foundations.

550
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,166
And in the carnage...
mine would be shaken as well.

551
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,609
Even my wife, Connie,
wanted to help.

552
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,122
She got a job as a nurse
in a local comuna.

553
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,851
She wanted to make a difference.

554
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,571
I guess she forgot we were in Colombia.

555
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,803
Look, our escolta will drive me
there and back every day.

556
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,400
- Yeah.
- He'll wait outside all day.

557
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,609
You know the last time you were in church
is when we got married.

558
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,882
Well, I'm letting the Lord
back into my life.

559
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,041
Hey, stop right here.

560
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,729
Praise God.

561
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,291
Perdón.

562
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,127
I want that escolta watching
every inch of you at that comuna now.

563
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,529
Hey, did we leave the door open?

564
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,202
Oh, my God, Steve!

565
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,282
Get back.

566
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,964
You stay right there
and don't move.

567
00:45:13,988 --> 00:45:15,988
