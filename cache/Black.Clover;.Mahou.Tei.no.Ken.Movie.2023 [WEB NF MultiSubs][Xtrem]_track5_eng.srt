'Cause the calamity you’re attempting
to bring about is unjust, Conrad.

You know this nation must change.

Besides, if you seal me away,

you won't have access
to the Imperial Sword anymore!

You’re right.
It pains me to lose such a treasure.

Truth is,

48

we no longer possess enough power
to wrest it away from your hand.

[crowd cheering]

74
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,510
I hope you’re prepared for a show
because this tournament

75
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,310
will decide the strongest Magic Knight
out of the many competitors here today.

76
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,770
It's long been said that the mage
who claims victory here today,

77
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,060
will eventually be chosen
as the next Wizard King!

78
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,320
For those of you who may be unaware,

79
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,070
the Magic Knights comprise
nine elite squads of mages

80
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,570
who specialize in battle.

81
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,030
The Wizard King
sits at the top of the ranks,

82
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,870
overseeing their duties.

83
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,200
Together they protect
the peace and happiness

84
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,710
we're lucky enough to enjoy
in the Clover Kingdom every day!

85
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,580
Soon we’ll determine who the strongest
member of the Magic Knights is.

86
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:07,050
Whatever happens, we're certain to be in
for a memorable time!

87
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,170
Thank you for waiting so patiently.

88
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,760

00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,280
I was wondering if you knew why
we were chosen as masters of ceremony?

94
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,540
Uh! 'Cause we're members
of the strongest Magic Knights Squad,

95

[girl] Pardon the belated introductions!
I’m Mimosa Vermillion,

100
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,760
and I’ll be commentating alongside Klaus.

101
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,340
[Klaus] Introductions now?!
We should have done that at the beginning!

102
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,260
Who in their right mind
would choose Mimosa for this job?

103
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,390
Man, look at all these people!

104
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,770
The stands are packed!

105
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,850
Mmm… Yes, of course, they're full.
He's first.

[woman] The first round
features everyone's favorite Pretty Boy.

112
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,930
People came from all over
to watch him fight. See?

113
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,890
My only interest is in seeing
my dearest little sister, Marie.

114
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,520
Exactly what I’d expect from you, Gauche.

115
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,020
Ah, jeez,
I can’t wait to get in there and brawl.

116
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,110
I just wish Asta was here to join us.

117
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,360
Yeah, too bad. He’s still in exile,
thanks to the judgment at the devil trial.

118
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,360
Man, what a bummer! Let's hope
the rest of the roster's interesting.

-Hmm?

124

Yuno’s initial opponent is, uh…

125
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,670
-[boy] Hmm.
-[Mimosa] “The Masked One”?

126
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,590
Surely nobody entered the tournament
with such a ridiculous name?

127
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,260
-Oh, they did!
-[man 4] Take off the mask!

[fairy] Are you kidding me
with this getup?

129
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:24,270
You dressed like this
to make fun of Yuno, didn’t you?!

130
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,640
Hmm.

131
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,270
[Klaus] The Triumph
will now officially commence.

132
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,610
Our first round
is Yuno versus The Masked One.

133
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,650
You may begin!

Hey, Asta. Nice counter.

139
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,180
[Mimosa] The first move
in the tournament came from Yuno!

140
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,760
He used strong Wind Magic.

141
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,350
But The Masked One
countered with a big sword,

142
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,430
which completely neutralized the attack!

143
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,890

Shall we join them?

Oh yeah!

You’ve no idea
how long I’ve waited for this day to come.

looking so feeble in your old age, Julius.

164
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,090
I only absorbed
the tiniest amount of magic,

165
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,390
yet it’s taken this great a toll on you?

166
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,600
[Julius grunts softly]

167
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,730
I thought I wouldn’t see you again.
What a shame.

168
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,810
Must have been then.

169
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,480
[Conrad] Yes! I hope you don’t mind
that I broke your seal.

170
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,900
You were distracted for just a moment.
But that moment was all I needed.

171
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,910
-[somber music playing]
-[Julius] You're going to try again.

172
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,410
My ambitions have not changed
in the slightest

173
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,370
since we last faced each other here.

174
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,370
Today I will create the ideal world.

175
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,000
Where citizens have respect
for one another.

176
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,500
A nation built on joy and laughter.

177
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,210
And I brought help.

178
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,050
Come forth, my soldiers.
Time for domination.

179
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,430
Tomorrow this corrupt country
will be no more!

Why is everyone targeting me?

Yuno!

205
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,650
Ugh, these guys are the worst!
They ruined my awesome disguise!

206
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,360
And here I thought you were a lost child
who wandered onto the field.

[Noelle] You probably can’t feel it,

213
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,830
but I think something is absorbing
magical power from everyone here.

214
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,800

can’t even move now!

Of course. I’m a royal. I'm fine.

I have more than enough to spare, moron.

Right. Got it.

Guess I’ll have to work harder
to make up for everybody else.

Make sure you don’t get too carried away.
And don’t worry, I’ve got your back.

Just keep focusing
on what’s in front of you.

Great. Then let’s do this!

Is this some kind of a trick?

230
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,350
Those three?
How could they possibly be here?

231
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,440
Given your title, you must recognize them.

232
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,850
Three Wizard Kings
stripped of their titles.

233

Maligned because of their cruelty
and severe natures.

234
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,780
Hey, you floating guys! Did you do this?

235
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,740
Such an insolent boy. How is he moving?

236
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,910
Good question.

237
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,410
From what I can tell, he didn't have
any magical power to begin with.

Fighting without any juice?
[laughs] Buzz off.

239

There’s no way
that my soldiers were defeated

00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,380
by a peon
with no magical power to speak of.

241

Something strange is going on.

242
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,710
It was a fairly simple task
to revive them,

243
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,970
given my magic combined
with the power of the Imperial Sword.

244
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,680
[chuckles] You doubted me,

245
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,180
but these three are loyal supporters
of my cause.

[chuckles]

247

And together we will forge a new reality.

You heard the man.
Now let’s get you out of the way!

249
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,110
Oh, shut up!
I don’t know what you’re up to,

250
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,740
but it’s pretty obvious
that you’re the bad guys!

251
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,280
I’m gonna take you down!

I found a fun new toy
you might find amusing.

No, Marx, stay back! Get out of here!

264

[Conrad] Well, well.
That’s interesting magic.

265
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,570
How rude! No acknowledgement?

266
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,780
I suppose that means
I get to take my time.

267

Stop playing around with your prey.

268
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,790
Have the decency
to finish him off quickly.

Wow! That’s some beautiful magic
you’re working with.

274
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,320
It’s hopeless.
They can’t defeat Wizard Kings.

275

No matter how many stand against us.

276
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,650
Besides, these are your Magic Knights?

277
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,070
A peasant child with no magic?

278
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,450
How far this country has fallen
under your watch.

279
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,040
[sighs] You underestimate them.

280
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,870
Come again?

281
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,080
You may think we’re trash,
but none of us is weak.

But now some mighty mages
have arrived to save the day!

Wait, wait!
What is this sinister magical power?!

[chuckling] This may turn
into my best masterpiece yet!

291

I’ll take you on and turn you to ash
with the flames of justice!

No, that silhouette. It can’t be.

Hello, Kaiser.

It’s been a long time.

-Captain Yami!
-My bad.

297

I’m late 'cause I was takin’ a dump.
Couldn't get off the pot sooner.

298
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,400
So, who are these guys?

299
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,020
Not totally sure.
But I do know they’re super bad.

300
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,400
And strong.
Things aren’t looking good for us!

301
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,740
"Super bad"?
That’s how you describe a threat?

302
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,910
In this case, he isn't wrong.

303
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,830
I don’t see a way
to defeat them with our current forces.

304
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,120
There is one option though.

305
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,790
Please.

306
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,670
Head to Magic Tool Research Lab,
Branch Zero right away, Yami.

307
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,590
I need you to bring back the special tool
we’ve been co-developing with Nero.

-Uh, pass.

[groans] I go and you’re screwed.

You need me.
Someone’s gotta watch your back.

311
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,720
And I've got zero interest
in reliving my past failures.

Uh-- Yami…

313
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,310
Look, if you need an errand boy,
just send this dope.

-Kid? You're on.
-Me?

315

Finral, you heard your king.

316
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,900
Join him. Go to Branch Zero.

00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,110
Sir! Right away.

318
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,490
Hey, wait! I should be helping out here!

Uh!

[dramatic music playing]

So this is where you were hiding?

00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,660
I'd suggest you stay put.

323
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,080
Otherwise, I can't guarantee
a swift death.

324
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,840
[groans with effort, gasps]

325
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,590
-[music intensifies]
-[yells with effort]

326
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,470
Well.

327
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,520
Stop your stalling,
and get the hell outta here!

328
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,730
You better make it snappy, all right, kid?

329
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:52,980
-Or I'll kill them without you!
-Sir!

330
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,650
Captain Yami!

331
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,570
Asta, quick. Go through!

332
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:04,240
I can’t maintain Spatial Magic for long
because of that barrier!

333
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,330
[Noelle] You’re a member
of the Black Bulls, aren’t you?

334
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,120
Then follow your captain’s orders!

335
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,620
[Finral] Thanks, Noelle.

336
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,250
Whaddaya know?

337
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,210
I didn't expect
to see fancy magic like this today.

338
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,090
Well, I’ll have to analyze it later.

339
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,670
Oh my!

340
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,010
[dramatic music playing]

341
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,800
Vouivre's Roar!

342
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,890
Okay, not too shabby.
You've got my attention.

343
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,480
[Yami] Dark Magic:
Dark Cloaked Black Blade!

344
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,190
[shouting] Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

345
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,990
-[music fades out abruptly]
-[glass shards tinkling]

346
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,530
[grunts]

347
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,200
Their defenses
keep getting tougher and tougher.

348
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,710
The kids have greatly improved though.

349
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,420
Maybe. They've still got plenty to learn.

350
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,500
It’ll be awhile before they can
hold their own without holding me back.

351
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,800
[groaning]

352
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,430
[sighs] My apologies
for not being able to contain them.

353
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,970
Please. You’re doing the best you can.

354
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,980
Thanks to you, I had time
to send my guys out on an errand.

355
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,230
[Conrad] You’re wasting energy
trying to oppose me.

356
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,810
When the Imperial Sword’s magic
is activated,

357
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,820
the Clover Kingdom will be gone.

358
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,240
[Yami] Haven’t you had
any better ideas in the last ten years?

359
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,240
So the Imperial Sword? That's the one
that can absorb magic power.

360
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,080
Stores it 'til the wielder’s
ready to release it, right?

361
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,450
Is it really possible
to destroy a country with it?

362
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,080
[Julius] Certainly. If he unleashes
all the stored-up magic at once.

363
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,590
He’s already collected power
from every person who was at this stadium.

364
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,590
The blade must be humming with it.

365
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,760
And with his magic,

366
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,510
he can misuse the sword's ability
to no end, bringing ruin to our kingdom.

367
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,220
"Misuse"?

368
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:55,730
I'm using the sword
to save this broken world.

369
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,850
I'd say it's the perfect use, myself.

370
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,730
[dramatic music playing]

371
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,200
I'm here now, Wizard King.

372
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,280
We successfully evacuated
everyone in the audience.

373
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,870
Now we can safely defeat them.

374
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:19,370
Fuegoleon and Nozel.
I do hope you’ve gotten stronger.

375
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,540
[scoffs] I never expected
I’d be in a situation

376
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,010
where I’d have to fight
this monster again.

377
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,380
Ah, I almost forgot
how Nozel got so spooked the last time

378
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,390
that he cried and crapped his pants.

379
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,600
Another word
and I’ll drown you in mercury.

380
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,140
So who're the friends
he brought along this time? They’re new.

381
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,390
[Fuegoleon] The woman is capable
of producing magic soldiers.

382
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,230
My grandfather’s journal
spoke of this power.

383
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,480
I remember it well because my sister
found it captivating.

384
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:48,740
-[Kaiser] Not good.
-[Nozel] They’re figures from the past.

385
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,160
Leaders who died long ago.

386
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,660
[Yami] Wait. You're tellin' me some actual
Wizard Kings have come back to life?!

387
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:59,370
In that case, I bet I could make a killing
selling their autographs.

388
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,040
[girl] Former Wizard Kings
have been revived?!

389
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,380
I’m awake for a change,
but this feels like a dream.

390
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,800
It’s way too crazy!

391
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,380
[chuckling] This is filling
my brush with inspiration.

392
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,220
Then again, maybe now’s not the time
to be painting.

393
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,510
[music ends]

394
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:21,020
You’ve managed to gather
a formidable force, but this ends here.

395
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,270
[grunts]

396
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,900
[church organ music playing]

397
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,490
[gasping nervously]

398
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:34,570
[Conrad] There are countless points
across the land where veins of mana

399
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,950
intersect and interact with each other.

400
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,290
This location happens to be one of them.

401
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,080
Ten years ago, I altered the arena

402
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,210
and turned it into a weapon
of my own design.

403
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,260
But you people interrupted me
before I could activate it.

404
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,920
[music becomes solemn]

405
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,640
[groaning]

406
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,900
[groaning softly]

407
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,860
[both groan]

408
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,170
[Conrad] Festival Stadium.

409
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:30,510
Also known as Triumph, my flying fortress.

410
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,970
There’s no way for you to escape now.

411
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:40,180
Julius, it’s time I make up for the years
you stole when you sealed me away.

412
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,520
[music fades out]

413
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,770
[all gasping softly]

414
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:49,690
[Finral] We made it.
Welcome to Branch Zero.

415
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,820
[wind howling]

416
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,780
Hey!

417
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,070
What's up?
This is Asta from the Black Bulls!

418
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,530
The Wizard King sent me!

419
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,120
-Let's get these doors open!
-It’s not gonna work.

420
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,250
This lab is a well-kept secret.

421
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:05,250
Only a handful of nobles
even know it exists.

422
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:09,000
To enter, you have to spell out
a secret password with your magical power.

423
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,840
[gasping]

424
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,340
And you are?

425
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,510
Ah, you must be the Black Bulls.

426
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:22,430
I'm branch coordinator Millie Maxwell.
It’s a pleasure to meet you.

427
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,730
Come. This way.

428
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:26,350
-Right!
-We've been briefed.

429
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,850
It's quite the situation.

430
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,860
I'm going to let
someone else take it from here.

431
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,230
[gasps softly, gulps]

432
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,530
[Millie] She’ll be happy
to show you around.

433
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,490
[Asta] Nero!

434
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,530
[Nero] The magic tool Julius needs
is down below.

435
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,540
Stored in the depths
of this facility for safe keeping.

436
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,790
Sally is making some adjustments to it.

437
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,500
This could be my greatest experiment!

438
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,250
[chuckles] So Sally's here too.

439
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,920
Nero, you’ve been observing
the Clover Kingdom for centuries, right?

440
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,130
At least 500 years if I'm not mistaken.

441
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,760
So does that mean you recognize
the people who attacked the stadium?

442
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:05,390
[Nero] I don’t know the details,
but I can confirm a few things for you.

443
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,850
-The mastermind is Conrad Leto.
-Huh?

444
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,610
[Nero] I assume
you’ve at least heard his name before.

445
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,440
Conrad was the--

446
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,400
-Wait, you don’t mean…
-[Asta] Uh-huh.

447
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,820
[Nero] Yes.

448
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,080
He was once a Magic Knight
of the Clover Kingdom.

449
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,700
And Julius Novachrono’s predecessor.

450
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,210
The previous Wizard King.

451
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,250
-[gasps]
-Hold on.

452
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:34,380
Didn't that guy get sick?
He's been dead for almost ten years.

453
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,840
I’ll explain what I can. Get on.

454
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,560
Conrad Leto was the 27th Wizard King.

455
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,060
Even before he was chosen for this role,

456
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,310
he was known as one of
the most powerful men in the kingdom.

457
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,190
He quickly became
a captain in the Magic Knights.

458
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:56,940
And, as you might expect,
his squad was praised for their successes.

459
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,650
The citizens of the land trusted him.

460
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,370
And given his abilities
and the respect he garnered,

461
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,830
it was no surprise
he was named the Wizard King.

462
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,040
However, something changed inside him.

463
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,340
He rebelled against the kingdom and,
as a result, was stripped of his title.

464
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,050
[Noelle] What do you mean, "he rebelled"?

465
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,180
[Nero] He tried to destroy the nation.

466
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,970
No way! The Wizard King’s job
is to protect peace!

467
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,930
Why would he try
to do something so terrible?

468
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,560
[Nero] I have no idea.

469
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,440
What we do know is this.

470
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,560
His plan relied
on the Imperial Sword, Elsdocia.

471
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:38,860
A magic item that belonged
to Lord Lumiere, the first Wizard King.

472
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,400
When Julius and the others
learned of this plot,

473
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,240
they stopped Conrad by sealing him.

474
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,080
[Finral] Intense.

475
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,580
[Nero] They then announced
that he died of an illness,

476
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,080
so the kingdom wouldn't panic.

477
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,120
Keep in mind
that Julius couldn't defeat him,

478
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:55,130
even with the help
of the most elite Magic Knights.

479
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:59,300
As such, he had no choice
but to use his Time Magic on Conrad

480
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,930
to keep him locked away and out of sight
so he couldn’t harm anybody.

481
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:06,720
[Noelle] I get it, he's incredibly strong.
What magic does he use?

482
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,100
[Nero] Key Magic.

483
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,310
It grants him the ability to create keys

484
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,230
that can open or close rifts
out of thin air.

485
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:18,530
The magic space behind these doors
is able to absorb whatever Conrad wishes.

486
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,860
Tools, grimoires…

487
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,610
Magic itself.

488
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,610
Seriously?

489
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,740
Wait, wait. You mean…

490
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,870
Correct.

491
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,990
He has the ability
to steal a person’s magic.

492
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,750
And after, he can use it
however he pleases.

493
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,250
[elevator thuds]

494
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,800
Sealing Magic: Release!

495
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,550
[suspenseful music playing]

496
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,400
[chuckles nervously]
So how far down are we going?

497
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,860
Their security is extreme.

498
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,360
Yes. Patience. We're almost there.

499
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,030
[music becomes quirky]

500
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,670
[Nero] This is the innermost part
of Branch Zero.

501
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,500
Here we store and research

502
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,460
the most important
magic tools in our catalog.

503
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,130
I get the feeling we were asked
to bring back something pretty rare, huh?

504
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,850
[Nero] Indeed. It's something
Prince Lumiere was developing

505
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,430
to control the power
of the Imperial Sword.

506
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,520
You could think of it
as a sheath for Elsdocia.

507
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,770
It’s still a prototype, but with any luck,
we can use it to seal Conrad again.

508
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,070
-[Finral gasps]
-He's here?

509
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:51,030
[Conrad] When I heard you were
after something Lumiere worked on,

510
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,540
my interest was piqued.

511
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,250
But this is a useless trinket.

512
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,710
-No, don't!
-Sally!

513
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,790
[groans]

514
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,340
[Asta] Demon Slayer!

515
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,630
-[exclaims indistinctly]
-[groans]

516
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,380
-[Finral] No!
-Oh?

517
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,840
[groans, grunts]

518
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:10,760
[groans]

519
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,760
[yelps]

520
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,260
[groans]

521
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,100
-Finral?!
-[groaning]

522
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,900
[groans]

523
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,100
I know you.

524
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,860
[Asta groans]

525
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,490
[Nero] How did you find us?

526
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,280
[scoffs] Secré Swallowtail.

527
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,990
Yet another Mage
from the Black Bulls Squad.

528
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:37,370
Your fellow members are Asta,
Noelle Silva, and Finral Roulacase.

529
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,380
Memory Exchange Magic makes it easy
to see what other people have experienced.

530
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,550
Invading a person's privacy
is a bit distasteful,

531
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,970
but it allowed me to locate this place.

532
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,720
[Noelle] Marx’s magic!

533
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,970
[Conrad] Shall I show you
what's happening?

534
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,060
[all gasp]

535
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,430
[dramatic music playing]

536
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,930
[woman] Citizens of the Clover Kingdom,

537
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,690
surrender immediately,

538
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:04,270
and offer your magical power as a tribute.
Resistance is futile.

539
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,780
My Legion Magic soldiers

540
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:10,030
will keep on fighting
until their last bit of energy is spent!

541
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,580
[Conrad] One of the former
Wizard Kings, Princia.

542
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:17,620
The Imperial Sword is supplying her
with the magical power it has stored

543
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,660
meaning she essentially has no limits.

544
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:23,000
The Magic Knights
have been completely wiped out.

545
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,210
And we’ve taken control of every citizen
and strategic facility in the kingdom.

546
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,970
-[music stops]
-It can't be.

547
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,880
Impressive, no?

548
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,090
So many. So fast.

549
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,520
Don't imagine that you're being invaded
by a paltry swarm of magic soldiers.

550
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,350
Princia can summon armies comparable
to those of even the strongest nations.

551
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,860
As for those powerful mages
who helped you escape…

552
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,730
-[solemn tone plays]
-Captain Yami!

553
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,190
[solemn tone plays]

554
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:55,070
[Conrad] They're resting now, fast asleep.
They’ll resist no more.

555
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,660
All those people at the stadium.

556
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,000
[Noelle] Nozel. Brother?

557
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,290
That's right.
You're the youngest Silva daughter.

558
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,340
Progeny of Acier Silva,

559
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,670
the renowned Steel War Princess.

560
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,920
What a pathetic turn of events
for your brother to fall

561
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,720
before his little sister.

562
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,800
To think that such a coward

563
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:17,310
was allowed to be a captain
of the Magic Knights!

564
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:20,680
[scoffs, shouts] Sea Dragon’s Roar!

565
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,900
[dramatic music playing]

-[loud crash]
-[Noelle shrieks]

567
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:32,200
-Noelle! Dammit, I'm coming!
-[stone crumbling]

568
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,370
You’ve much yet to learn,

569
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,700
but the purity
of your magic is impressive.

570
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,080
I believe I’ll take it.

571
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,080
[Noelle gasps]

572
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,130
[smugly] Hmm. The profound difference
in our abilities

573
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,380
makes this such an easy task.

574
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,420
[music subsides]

575
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,180
[weakly] I can feel my magic flowing out.

576
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,640
[voice quavers, sobs]

577
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,810
Bastard. What did you do to her?

578
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:07,440
Perhaps it's better to show you.

579
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,360
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

580
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,900
[Asta grunts]

581
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,540
It's true, he stole Noelle's magic.

582
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,790
-Give it back!
-[dramatic music playing]

583
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,760
[groans]

584
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,890
You're gonna wish you'd stayed sealed!

585
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,390
Fascinating. So this is Anti-Magic
in action, is it?

586
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,890
[Asta grunts]

587
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,270
[Conrad] Hmm.

588
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,780
[grunting, groaning]

589
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,610
Uh!

590
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,330
[groaning]

591
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,840
[yells with effort]

00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,640

-[groans]
-[music subsides]

00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,100
Demon Destroyer!

596
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:30,690
[grunts]

597
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,320
What a wonderful power you possess!

598
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,900
It can nullify not only magic

599
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:40,320
but also any phenomena
that is derived from magic.

600
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,780
I’d like to take this ability as well,

601
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:45,370
but perhaps I’ll refrain
for the time being.

602
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,960
I wouldn’t want it
to affect anything I have stored.

603
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,580
Let’s have a little chat.

604
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,170
After all, you and I
are walking a similar path.

605
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,380
You really are nuts.
I am nothing like you!

606
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,220
[Conrad] The Imperial Sword, Elsdocia
is a magic tool

607
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,350
that was developed
by Lumiere a long time ago.

608
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:06,890
It happens to be perfectly compatible
with my Key Magic.

609
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,980
The sword was created
to preserve exceptional magic

610
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:14,320
of great mages and heroes
as a legacy for future generations.

611
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,780
You see, it has not only
the power and wisdom

612
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:21,410
of every Wizard King stored inside it
but a piece of their souls as well.

613
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,370
Are you starting to understand?

614
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,990
This weapon can absorb,
stockpile, and unleash

615
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,580
an absurd amount
of magical power all at once.

616
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,130
With it, I will combine
the generations of Wizard Kings' magic

617
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:39,220
with the various types of magic I stole
and create a Gargantuan Compound Magic!

618
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,970
Once that power is in my hands,

619
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:45,010
I'll drive it into one of the mana veins
pulsing throughout this land.

620
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,600
Disaster will be magnificent!

621
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,140
The foundation of the continent
will be destroyed,

622
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,810
and every single citizen will perish.

623
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,190
But don't you worry yourself,

624
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:58,690
the Imperial Sword
can also store the souls of the departed.

625
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,320
I will select the worthy

626
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,160
and bring back only those who deserve
to inherit the world that I have created!

627
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,870
I know people loathed me
because of my magic,

628
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,910
I’ve seen it in their memories.

629
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,670
Trust me when I say
I know what you must feel.

630
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,920
Those with magical power
own everything in this society,

631
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,800
and those without it die in the squalor.

632
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,380
Isn’t this world unbearable, Asta?

633
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,180
Shouldn’t we destroy it and start anew?

634
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,640
Join me, and we’ll shape
a new reality together.

635
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,430
One where people have esteem
for their fellow man.

636
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,690
-Where they can't help but smile.
-[growls]

637
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,570
Everyone should respect each other
and get along great and laugh together.

638
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,780
One day, when I become the Wizard King,
I’ll create that world.

639
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,150
Shut up!

640
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,910
-That's bullshit!
-[metal music playing]

641
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:47,120
The Wizard King
is supposed to protect his people!

642
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,410
To make sure
everyone in the nation is safe and happy.

643
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,080
I will not let you destroy this world!

644
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,420
It’s not something
a real king would ever do!

645
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,710
You cannot stop me.

646
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:01,420
The dregs of this society
are forced to lead lives devoid of worth.

647
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,550
You’ve seen it.

648
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,260
But I can give meaning to their existence.

649
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,140
[angrily] Why can't you see that?

650
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:11,390
Every single thing you've said is crazy.

651
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,890
I don't understand any of it at all!

652
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,980
You don't realize
how broken this civilization is.

653
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,480
What a pity.

654
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:24,820
I said, "Shut up!"
How can anyone be so selfish? [yells]

655
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,830
[music abruptly fades out]

656
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:38,080
-Why can’t you understand?!
-[dramatic music playing]

657
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,090
I know the things you’ve experienced.

658
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:47,180
The inequality. The betrayal.
The country is against you.

659
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,550
[groaning]

660
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:54,140
You must choose, Asta.

661
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,270
You can walk this path with me…

662
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,480
[grunts]

663
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,730
…or disappear forever.

664
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,820
[music intensifies]

665
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,200
[Astor screams]

666
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,290
[jingling getting closer]

667
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,710
[gasping shakily]

668
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,000
[Conrad] Give up this fight already.

669
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:27,470
We are alike.
Accept that, and stand at my side.

670
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:31,300
The fusion of magic
will be completed by dawn tomorrow.

671
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,720
That’s your deadline. Your last chance.

672
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:39,440
[breathing shakily]
You have to give Noelle

673
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,980
her magic back

674
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,110
-That’s your concern?
-[Asta gasping shakily]

675
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:49,110
[Conrad] Know that
I will truly regret your death.

676
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,410
[breathing shakily] I'll fight.

677
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,120
I will not back down.

678
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,410
That's because my magic is

679
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,630
'never giving up.'

680
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,880
[gasps, breathes shakily]

681
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,180
[gasps]

682
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,390
That’s the last of my power.

683
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,470
-[Sally gasps shakily]
-Uh… Hm. What now?

684
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,390
We’re not done. We'll try whatever we can.

685
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,860
Yuno? When'd you get here?

686
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,870
And Millie too?

687
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:36,290
He made it very clear that
he wouldn’t leave until he’d helped you.

688
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:39,250
-Drink up, Sally.
-Okay!

689
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,210
[gags, gulping]

690
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:44,130
There's no plan.
We’ll just have to play this one by ear.

691
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,130
That sounds like a fun time!
Like we’re experimenting.

692
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,590
No. Not fun.

693
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,590
I truly loathe improvisation.

694

[weakly] Yu… no. [groans]

-[laser whooshes]
-[grunts]

703
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,340
Never thought I’d be using this
in such a way, but here we are.

704
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,210
Come on, quickly! Let’s try to activate it
with the magic we have!

705
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,590
This will not work.

706
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,840
[Nero] Maybe not,

707
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,800
but thanks to their help,
we have a chance!

708
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,720
Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison!

709
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,310
[gasps, groans]

-[grunts]
-He's too strong!

711
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,150
[gasps] We will retreat for now!

712
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,040
[footsteps slowly approaching]

713
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,040
[tense music playing]

714
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:15,300
Jester, what’s the status
of the magic fusion?

715
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,760
Hey you. We’re at about 20% complete.

716
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,970
Generally speaking, we're golden.

717
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,850
It should be finished by dawn,
right on schedule.

718
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,400
That’s good to hear.

719
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,020
And I want to thank you

720
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,570
for fighting the good fight with me.

721
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:33,690
It’s finally happening!
A brand-new nation!

722
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,490
No one will ever cry
or have joy taken from them again.

723
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:37,950
We’ll triumph.

724
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,370
These poor lost souls
will be saved and born again.

725
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:44,290
What I seek
is a society free from oppression,

726
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:47,080
where no one
seeks to lord over another individual.

727
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:51,500
I trust that you can achieve that
as part of your plan, Conrad?

728
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,590
[Conrad] Yes.

729
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,930
How about the mana veins?

730
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:00,010
[Jester] Don’t worry,
I managed to find the perfect one.

731
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,930
It's at a village called Hage
in the Forsaken Realm,

732
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,810
where a demon skeleton rests.

733
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,520
[Conrad sighs]

734
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,520
-[wind softly whistling]
-[restrained classical music playing]

735
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:17,320
[Conrad] On its own,
my Key Magic is practically useless.

736
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,950
I have to borrow power from other mages.

737
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:24,080
Kinda goes hand in hand with the future
I'm fighting for, like it's my destiny.

738
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,960
One day soon,
I’m going to change this whole country.

739
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,460
[chuckles]

740
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,710
I like to think that my real magic

741
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:34,420
is 'never giving up.'

742
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,340
[music fades out]

[tense music fades in]

744
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,560
I told you that we were alike.

745
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,600
[music abruptly fades out]

[breathing shakily]

748
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,620
[Noelle weakly] Where am I?

749
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,790
[gasps] Noelle!

750
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,750
I’m so happy you're awake!

751
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:13,130
I’m sorry. I healed you as best I could.

752
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:14,460
Mimosa…

753
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,670
I’m glad you made it out. [grunts]

[gasping softly]

00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,840
[footsteps approaching]

756
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:25,560
We should be safe here.
This is a Golden Dawn emergency shelter.

757
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,310
It's still under construction,
so only a few members know about it.

758
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:32,940
They tried to capture everyone
at the arena to steal our magic,

759
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,730
but the captains stopped them.

760
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,730
They bought us time to escape.

761
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,200
Take care of the kid, you hear me?

762
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:49,790
[Mimosa] I don’t know
what happened to them afterwards,

763
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:52,290
but they’re not here yet, so, you know…

764
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,040
-[loud clanging]
-[all gasp softly]

765
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:56,960
[man 1] Hey, are you okay?

766
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,300
-Asta’s up? Excuse me!
-[footsteps retreating]

767
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,760
[Mimosa] Asta, please! You need to rest
until your body's fully healed!

768
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,930
[Asta shakily] Conrad… must be stopped.

769
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,230
He’s gonna destroy the kingdom
and everybody in it.

770
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:15,480
If we don’t do something,
the world ends tomorrow at dawn!

771
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,690
[man 2] Dawn?!

772
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:18,980
How are we supposed to fight such enemies?

773
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:21,240
[woman 1] Is it really
a former Wizard King?

774
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,740
[man 3] There's no way
we can do anything ourselves.

775
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,030
-We’re not strong enough--
-Come on! [grunts]

776
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,790
[woman 2] We could just hide--

777
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,750
-[man 2] We can't hide forever.
-Hey! Listen!

778
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:32,460
There’s nothing we can do
with these numbers.

779
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,750
It probably won’t be long
before they find us here,

780
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:38,840
so we should pack and run while we can.
We’ll move out and settle somewhere else.

781
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,090
Maybe the Heart Kingdom will take us in.
We’ll be safe there.

782
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:44,800
This isn’t a fight
we’re going to be able to win!

783
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,510
[man 4] Not a bad idea
to ask other nations for help.

784
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,810
[man 5] We’re talking about
a massive undertaking.

785
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,600
It’d be difficult
to move the injured safely.

786
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,690
[man 6] If this Conrad’s
really a former Wizard King,

787
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:55,100
do we have any choice but to flee?

788
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:56,610
[man 7] And Lord Julius gone…

789
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:59,270
[man 8] Why get hurt fighting
when we know we’ll fail?

790
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,650
[chatter stops]

791
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:03,240
[Asta] What the crap
are you talkin' about?!

792
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,490
-Running away? No!
-[poignant music playing]

793
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,240
[Asta] We have to do something.

794
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,910
We have to at least try!

795
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:12,250
We’re the Magic Knights
of the Clover Kingdom, aren’t we?

796
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:13,160
Not cowards!

797
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,420
[all gasping]

798
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,170
[Asta] We've been able
to live happily and peacefully

799
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,420
thanks to the Wizard King
and the past mages

800
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,920
who looked out for us our entire lives.

801
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,470
They protected us
before we joined our squads,

802
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:27,390
when we were kids,
heck, before we were even born!

803
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:30,430
They fought for us no matter the odds
and never backed down!

804
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,350
And the Wizard King led the way!

805
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:37,310
Making sure that the country was safe!
That we could live our lives!

806
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,530
It's thanks to the sacrifices they made
that the Clover Kingdom exists now!

807
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:45,360
Without them and their passion,
we wouldn’t be who we are today!

808
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:46,450
[softly] Asta…

809
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:49,200
[Asta] I won't turn my back
on this country.

810
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,030
It's my turn to look after

811
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,040
everything the Wizard King
and the captains have protected.

812
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,290
To take a stand!

813
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,420
But it’s not just me. It’s your turn too!
This is our chance to make a difference!

814
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,170
I'll heal up using my fighting spirit!

815
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,930
And I’ll face Conrad again
and kick his butt for real this time!

816
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:08,930
[groans]

817
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,470
[chuckles softly]

818
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,520
We can stop him if we work together.

819
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:24,690
We may not be strong enough
to win against him by ourselves,

820
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,780
but if we join forces,
we'll turn into something unstoppable.

821
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:31,910
Isn’t that the point
of being Magic Knights?

822
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,700
Why we’re here in the first place?

823
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,960
If all of us join together
and pool our power,

824
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,790
there's no enemy anywhere
who could stop us!

825
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:42,710
I’m not forcing anyone to come with me.

826
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,300
Sekke made a good point.
You can still escape.

827
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,550
Hide out in the Heart Kingdom
or somewhere.

828
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:51,220
But please, stay!

829
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,560
Some of you have to be willing
to lend me your strength in this fight!

830
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,720
[feet clatter]

831
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,980
Sounds good. But it's not much of a plan.

832
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,980
Well, I suppose that’s to be expected
from a reckless fool.

833
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:05,070
So I’ll lend a hand.

834
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,030
[sweeping music playing]

835
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,330
I’m not gonna let you do this alone.

836
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,290
Not a chance.

837
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,420
[music fades out]

838
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,800
-[heroic music playing]
-[chuckles breathily]

839
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:30,130
King Julius isn’t here to lead the way.

840
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:32,300
And we can’t rely on our captains either.

841
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:34,930
But that shouldn't make a difference
to any of you.

842
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:36,560
We’ll battle on their behalf.

843
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,390
Now’s our chance
to prove that we have what it takes

844
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,190
with everything on the line!

845
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:42,310
I’ll say it again.

846
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,440
Look around. You’re the Magic Knights
of the Clover Kingdom.

847
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,820
We’ll fight as one.
Save the whole country.

848
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,110
And surpass all our limits!

849
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,570
[all] Yeah!

850
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,950
[woman distant]
So! What are we gonna do first?

851
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:56,910
[Asta] I’m gonna figure that out,
right now!

852
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:58,080
[woman] You’re what?!

853
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:01,500
[Sekke sighs] I can’t take this anymore.

854
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:05,250
They’re gonna get themselves killed.
But not me. I’m escaping.

855
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:07,590
Wha-ha?

856
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:09,010
Ha-ha!

857
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:13,550
[footsteps approaching]

858
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,890
[woman] What’s all this shouting?

859
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:17,140
[laughing maniacally]

860
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:21,890
Now’s not the time for empty words,
you hot-headed imbecile!

861
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,650
[groans]

862
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,900
[sobs]

863
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:34,410
Lady Big-sis-leon! And more captains!

864
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:37,910
I didn't know you were alive--
[grunts] Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

865
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:41,910
[Big-sis-leon] Who are you calling,
"Big sis," huh? And don't assume I'm dead.

866
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,630
I’ve been on my own
doing some intense training.

867
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:47,460
[tense music playing]

868
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,050
[Big-sis-leon] Ah. Guests.

869
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:53,300
I hope you’re here to tell me
we're gonna have some fun.

870
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,890
I also have been away.

871
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:56,930
On a mission with Jack.

872
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:01,890
Fortunately, that means
I wasn’t caught up in the initial attack.

873
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,110
The same goes for me. Now that we’re here,
we must rescue the others.

874
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:08,440
[laughs]

875
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,070
We brought some other people
back from our mission.

876
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:12,900
They should come in handy.

877
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,160
They're already out there,
pulling their weight,

878
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,280
surveilling the giant flying arena.

879
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:21,660
According to them, it looks like Yami
and the other captains are still with us.

880
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,170
However, they’re currently trapped
inside the barrier.

881
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:26,630
Captain Yami.

882
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,210
[softly] Nozel is alive.

883
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:30,960
Thank goodness, Yami,
I couldn’t handle your dying!

884
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,170
There’s something I don’t get.

885
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,220
They're captured.

886
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,720
Why hold such powerful
Magic Knights captive?

887
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,970
-Wouldn't killing them be easier?
-[Nero] Because Conrad needs them alive.

888
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,230
He's wielding the Imperial Sword.

889
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:45,140
With it, he can absorb their power,

890
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:47,480
giving him and his friends
unlimited strength.

891
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,400
[man 1] Que, que!
So they’re his livestock!

892
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,070
Oh! Earlier he said something
about needing a ton of power.

893
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:56,570
His plan depends on
sucking it out of them!

894
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,410
[man 2] So that’s what we’re dealing with.

895
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,990
But if he siphons off
their magical powers, then…

896
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,120
We don’t have much time.

897
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,040
Asta, knights, gather all your courage.

898
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,920
We're taking back the kingdom!

899
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:09,960
[all] Right!

900
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:14,170
Before you run into battle,
I wanna get those tummies full.

901
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,550
-Open wide!
-[music becomes heroic]

902
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:20,140
[gulping loudly]

903
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,220
[sighs]

904
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:26,690
[Asta] Whoa! Charmy, you’re okay!

905
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:28,690
-I was worried.
-[woman] That’s right.

906
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:31,610
Rouge and Captain Yami
gave us the opportunity to escape.

907
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:34,690
-[gasps] You're safe!
-[woman] Hmm.

908
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,200
Noelle, it’s good to see you.

909
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:41,200
Unfortunately, our base was trapped
inside one of their barriers.

910
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,000
Henry and Gordon are there now.
[softly] I'm sure they're holding up.

911
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,160
[Noelle] Good.

912
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:50,080
Then our first objective
is to break them out, right?

913
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,960
[quietly] The Black Bulls' base.

914
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:54,960
[music continues]

915
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:00,050
The Imperial Sword
has absorbed tremendous amounts of power.

916
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,760
They'll drive it into a vein of mana
called a singular point.

917
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:06,980
Que! Well, that will spell
the end of this kingdom. Toodle-oo!

918
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:10,350
Given all that we know
it’s safe to assume the Wizard Kings

919
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,770
were revived with Conrad’s magic
and the sword.

920
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,530
[gulps] So what if we break the sword?

921
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:18,280
Would that take their power away?
Make 'em dead again?

922
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:22,780
Given the precautions they’re taking,
I’d say that’s highly likely.

923
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:27,160
Right. Our goal's to destroy
the Imperial Sword.

924
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,000
Cut off their power source.

925
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,080
Do whatever you need
to prepare for the battle ahead of us.

926
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,750
Dawn is fast approaching,

927
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,590
and that's our deadline!

928
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:39,010
[music intensifies]

929
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:43,930
[grunts]

930
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:49,020
[sighs] I still can't use
the powerful spells in my grimoire,

931
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,560
but thanks to Charmy,
my magic has returned.

932
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:55,020
For now, I’ll focus on what I can do!

933
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,110
[door opens]

934
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:03,780
Hmm?

935
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,660
[music intensifies]

936
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:11,540
[Asta] Wait up!

937
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,300
Hmm. I take it you're healed. You ready?

938
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:20,170
Oh yeah!

939
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:23,180
[music climaxes, ends]

940
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:26,850
THE BASE OF THE BLACK BULLS SQUAD

941
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:29,270
[man] This is strange.

942
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:31,770
When I got back from training,
Henry was the only one here.

943
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:33,520
It appears the former Wizard Kings

944
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,690
were somehow revived
and have taken over the capital.

945
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:37,070
[whoosh approaching]

946
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:38,190
[grunts]

947
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,150
[gasps]

948
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,820
[Asta groans]

949
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,070
[Asta roars]

950
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,120
No barrier's gonna stop me!

951
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,580
First, we go and rescue those
at the base of the Black Bulls.

952
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:54,580
[hesitantly] Wha-- I’m glad,
but are you sure?

953
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:56,040
This'll be difficult.

954
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:58,840
Our success hinges on us
preserving our fighting power.

955
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,130
Plus, we're in need of transport.

956
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:03,880
Something that will allow us
to move everyone safely.

957
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:05,680
-I understand.
-[Noelle gasps]

958
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,270
Don’t you get it, kid? We'll tick off
some important boxes if we have your base.

959
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:11,980
-[Asta] Oh.
-That's true.

960
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:16,520
But don't forget that Conrad has stolen
many types of magic he can use against us.

961
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,940
It’s safe to assume he’ll easily
be able to counter normal attacks.

962
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,240
[man] That’s where you come in, Asta.

963
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,910
Anti-Magic neutralizes every type
of magic power.

964
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:27,700
And since that’s what you wield,

965
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,660
you will be
our only hope of defeating Conrad.

966
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,870
We’ll work to give you that opportunity.

967
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:35,830
So what do you say? Are you in?

968
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:37,790
Yes, sir!

969
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,880
-[gladiatorial music playing]
-[Asta roars]

970
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,010
[music ends]

971
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:48,390
-[triumphant music playing]
-All right!

972
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:53,390
[man] Welcome back, everyone.
Oh, wow, we have so many guests!

973
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,310
What’s the story, Henry?
Can you get us off the ground?

974
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:57,310
Let's get goin'!

975
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,650
[chanting dreamily] I've got you covered!

976
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:06,320
Quickly! Replenish your energy
by stuffing those faces!

977
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,700
[yummy noises]

978
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:16,210
[ecstatically] I've never felt
so much magic power before!

979
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,600
[music intensifies]

980
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,560
So cool!

981
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:43,610
The Black Bulls
are really flying in style now!

982
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:46,490
Hold on.
[quavering] This thing is gonna fly?

983
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:50,910
[Henry dreamily] If there's enough power,
I think it will!

984
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,830
-You should hold on.
-[all grunt]

985
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:56,580
[music intensifies]

986
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:01,210
More resistance than expected. Damn.

987
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:05,010
[man] Que, que! Severing Magic…

988
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,180
[screaming] …Death Scythe: Lunatic Slash!

989
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,300
[music accelerates]

990
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:13,100
Briar Magic…

991
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:15,520
[yelling] Crimson Vine Spear!

992
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,560
[all gasp]

993
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:29,070
-[woman] Barely a dent in them.
-[man] Que, que! How annoying!

994
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:30,990
Huh? Argh!

995
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:33,580
-Argh! Argh!
-[all grunt]

996
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,870
[somber music playing]

997
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,000
Que, que!

998
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,880
Perfect opportunity to slice and dice!

999
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,460
We’ll stop them
from interfering with our mission.

1000
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:48,880
[man] The rest of you go on ahead!

1001
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:51,380
-Captain Jack! Captain Charlotte!
-Hold on!

1002
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:53,640
-If you go, we can’t defeat Conrad.
-Uh--

1003
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,310
Yeah, but-- There's only two of 'em.

1004
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:58,680
Two don't stand a chance.

1005
00:55:58,770 --> 00:55:59,600
Three…

1006
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,690
is a better number.

1007
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:05,020
[thunderous crash]

1008
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:13,280
[man] World Tree Magic:
Great Mistilteinn Tree!

1009
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,960
Go. While you have an opening.

1010
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,290
Captain Vangeance!

1011
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,750
[Henry] Are you ready?

1012
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:31,010
[music intensifies]

1013
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:35,220
[tuts, breathes shakily]

1014
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:36,850
[Asta] Hey.

1015
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:40,810
[chuckles softly]

1016
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:49,070
[music fades out]

1017
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:51,950
[Vangeance] Yuno.

1018
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:53,990
I leave the Wizard King to you.

1019
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:59,080
Well, I’d say it’s as good a time as any
to ask our barbarous guests to leave.

1020
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,790
[music builds]

1021
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,750
Listen closely.

1022
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,170
We may be out three captains now,
but we’re still goin' in!

1023
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,970
-Hey, Asta.
-[Asta] Hmm?

1024
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:13,880
-[Big-sis-leon] Handle the pep talk.
-Huh?

1025
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:15,300
[all laugh]

1026
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,850
Right! We got this, you guys!
We'll give 'em everything we've got

1027
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:25,980
and take the Clover Kingdom back
from these losers!

1028
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,820
[all] Yeah!

1029
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,860
[tense music playing]

1030
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,410
I've received an update from my soldiers.

1031
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:37,410
The rebels have begun countermeasures.

1032
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,370
How shall we proceed?

1033
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,910
They decided to resist.

1034
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,580
As I know you would
if you were in their shoes.

1035
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,380
The grand finale is upon us.

1036
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,630
I’ve saved you
the best seat for the climax.

1037
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:54,670
Is that why you kept me alive until now,

1038
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,890
even after you took
almost all of my power?

1039
00:57:56,970 --> 00:58:00,390
[Conrad] Those you love,
those you want to protect,

1040
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:04,890
I want their agonizing final breaths
to haunt your remaining hours.

1041
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,440
They will die
in front of their powerless false king.

1042
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,780
Only then will the new era
of the Clover Kingdom begin.

1043
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:15,650
[sharp inhale] I hope you’re ready
for a stunning show.

1044
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:17,360
[solemn music playing]

1045
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,660
[electrical thrumming]

1046
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:32,380
Huh? What is that?!

1047
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:37,680
[warbling] Is that an enormous barrier?!

1048
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,260
It's far more powerful
than the one at our base.

1049
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,350
This will be tough to break through.

1050
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:43,260
Oh, hey! Look!

1051
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:52,820
Well, well, one last desperate attempt
to stop us.

1052
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,320
I'm gonna be totally honest with you.

1053
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,530
This is hopeless!

1054
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,530
[shouting] You see, a Wizard King
never leaves his blind spot open!

1055
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:06,330
[gasping]

1056

[music fades out]

1057
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,460
[chuckles] What’ll you do now?

1058
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:12,670
[dull rumbling]

1059
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:16,420
Our enemy's working with this much power?!

1060
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:19,220
He’s in a totally different league!
What should we do?

1061
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,180
-[grunts]
-[man] Stay back!

1062
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,140
Huh?

1063
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,680
It’s not your time to shine yet.

1064
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,310
We’ll handle this guy. No sweat.

1065
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:31,060
We just gotta surpass our limits
like we always do. Right?

1066
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,400
[heroic music playing]

1067
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,530
You ready, guys?
Show 'em what we're made of!

1068
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:40,450
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

O… kay.

1073
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,960
Everyone ready?

1074
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,460
[all] Yeah!

[Gauche] Mirror Magic:
Large Reflect Refrain!

1076
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:10,520
Let's go!

[music abruptly stops]

1079

Bwa-ha! Crap! [quavering] Two more!

1080
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:29,200
[Finral] All right! This is it!

Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel Gate!

[gentle music playing]

1083
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:35,460
Huh.

1084
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:40,300
[warbles] Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!
We're going to run right into the barrier!

1085
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:42,880
[Finral] That shield is interfering
with my magic.

1086
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:44,890
There’s no way I can get us inside.

1087
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,890
But…

1088
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:47,850
you can.

1089
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:50,220
[heroic music playing]

1090
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,400
[Yami] Asta, I know you can do this.

1091
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:01,280
-[music ends]
-[Asta roars]

1092
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:12,330
-[solemn music playing]
-Face us, so we can get this over with.

1093
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,790
[chuckles] That was easy.

1094
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,880
Thanks for walking into our trap,
ya walking corpses.

1095
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,010
Magic like this is of no consequence--

-Finral! Now! Don’t let them fight back!
-Right! Here goes.

1098
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:31,520
Also, don't forget I am your superior!

1099
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,310
Got 'em! We’re good.

-[anthemic music playing]
-[Asta roars]

1101

Didn't I tell you?
I don't have a weak spot!

1102
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:50,910
Argh!

1103
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:51,910
[groaning]

1104
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:53,160
[music subsides]

01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:56,500
[groans]

1106
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:57,790
[dramatic music playing]

1107
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:01,250
[Asta] Whoa! Thanks for the assist!

1108
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,470
[music climaxes]

1109
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,930
[music fades out]

1110
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:10,430
[Jester laughs] You do realize
that this barrier has been fortified

1111
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:11,890
with the Imperial Sword?

1112
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:15,640
Even if you did break through,
it would quickly regenerate. No problem.

1113
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:18,810
Now, in order to ensure our perfect world,

1114
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,190
I should get rid of
any flies in our ointment!

1115
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:23,440
This is the end!

1116
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:26,280
-[Yuno] Yeah, for you!
-[energetic disco music playing]

1117
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:34,750
Oh, that was nice!
Show me what else ya got!

1118
01:02:34,830 --> 01:02:38,170
Mana Zone: Tornado Fang Double Attacks!

1119
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:42,250
Was that supposed to hurt?

1120
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:44,630
[man] Now! Fire at will!

1121
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:48,840
-[music ends]
-[gasps]

1122
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,470
One more time! [grunts]

1123
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:55,310
Ah.

1124
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,270
-[dramatic music playing]
-Let's go!

1125
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:02,440
[both roaring]

1126
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:06,490
Nice. I'm loving this. Don't stop!

1127
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:13,660
[all groaning]

1128
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:21,380
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1129
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:22,540
[loud blast]

1130
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,090
[music climaxes, ends]

[glass shards tinkling]

1132
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:33,550
Ha! Color me shocked!

1133
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,640
You guys are kind of amazing!

1134
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:37,350
Too bad.

1135
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:39,890
Hold on!

1136
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:44,480
I'm counting on you, Asta!
You better take that maniac down!

1137
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:45,730
Yes, ma’am!

1138
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,030
Conrad, here I come!

1139
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:51,660
[Yuno] Hey, look!

1140
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,030
[Asta] It’s him!

1141
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:55,870
Why’s he out here?

1142
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:59,410
-That's the vein. Right there!
-[gasps softly]

1143
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:02,670
[Yuno] It’s in the skeleton of that demon!

1144
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:03,920
[wind howling]

1145
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,460
[Jester] Oh no!

1146
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:12,930
This is as far as you go!
[screaming] I’ll handle you!

1147
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:19,060
[groans]

1148
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:23,440
Asta! Leave him to me,
and take care of Conrad!

1149
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:24,690
[gasps]

1150
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:28,440
[scoffs] Give 'im everything you’ve got.

1151
01:04:29,530 --> 01:04:30,440
Yeah!

1152
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:36,080
Ugh. [giggles]

1153
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:44,250
It's time. Bell?

1154
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:45,840
Thought you’d never ask!

1155
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,800
[Yuno] Let’s go all out!

1156
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,550
[heroic music playing]

1157
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:59,970
[Yuno] Spirit Assimilation: Spirit Dive!

1158
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:06,020
All units! Get into positions!

1159
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:09,320
Our plan worked,
and we were able to split up our enemies!

1160
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,650
[chuckling]

1161
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,660
[Big-sis-leon] Now, each of you will take
your places and fight to your death!

1162
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:16,660
Show them the pride of a Magic Knight!

1163
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:20,240
Fail and you will answer to me!

1164
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:24,000
[shouting] Not one of you
is allowed to get killed, you hear me?!

1165
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:28,250
If you don’t prevail
or you suffer mortal injuries,

1166
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:30,460
I’ll burn you to death myself!

1167
01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:32,880
Understand?

1168
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:35,760
If you don’t wanna die, then win!

1169
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,260
Even if it kills you!

1170
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,260
We won't lose.

1171
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:40,510
-[all] Right!
-[music ends]

1172
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:44,270
[Princia] You aren’t pulling out
any special tricks

1173
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:46,020
to use in your fight against me?

1174
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:50,270
How unfortunate that I find myself saddled
with such a boring opponent.

1175
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,440
-[dramatic music playing]
-You expected tricks?

1176
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:55,280
I'm not some weakling
who can’t win an honest fight.

1177
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,490
Princia Funnybunny.

1178
01:05:57,990 --> 01:06:01,790
A feared warrior with a combat strength
of a thousand soldiers.

1179
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:04,370
Mighty even among Wizard Kings.

1180
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:06,870
According to the history books,

1181
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:11,130
no matter how bad a fight might've looked,
you always came out on top!

1182
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:16,050
No tricks here. Just me.
A fair fight to see how we compare.

1183
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,800
Very well, then. I take back my comments.

1184
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:23,310
Legion Magic: Endless Domination!

1185
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:28,940
If you want the honor of playing with me,
you need to prove you’re worthy first.

1186
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:35,240
[music intensifies]

1187
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,570
[Big-sis-leon] Challenge happily accepted!

1188
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:39,320
But…

1189
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:42,910
you better not hold anything back,
you hear me?!

1190
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:45,290
[electronic dance music playing]

1191
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:56,340
[gasps] Where is he?

1192
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:59,090
[Jester] Were you even trying to aim?

1193
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:00,140
Load out!

1194
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,600
[grunts]

1195
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:08,270
[Jester] You’re a fool if you think
you managed to lure me into a snare.

1196
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:11,110
It's quite the opposite, you silly boy.

1197
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:14,110
I’m the one who lured you
into what will soon be your tomb!

1198
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:19,610
All that absorbed magical energy
isn’t just powering this flying fortress,

1199
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:23,280
we’re able to tap into
as much of it as we want as well.

1200
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:26,410
Which means as long as I’m here,
the well of my power

1201
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,000
doesn’t have any risk of running dry!

1202
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,620
[music ends]

1203
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:35,050
Ha. You’re dense enough to believe
that means you’ve won?

1204
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:36,670
Against us?

1205
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,920
Wait. "Us"?

1206
01:07:38,970 --> 01:07:41,220
[Yami] Not too shabby, Pretty Boy.

1207
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,180
But points docked for being so rough.

1208
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:47,430
You’re supposed to be gentle
with a damsel in distress.

1209
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,730
-[rousing music playing]
-I am a Virgo, after all. Poor form!

1210
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:53,980
[Jester groans]
You mean, those earlier attacks…

1211
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,860
He wasn’t aiming for me.

1212
01:07:58,070 --> 01:07:59,490
I’ll do better next time.

1213
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,410
Are you good?

1214
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:03,910
Of course, it’s my duty as a captain.

1215
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:07,660
Can’t have you kids risking your lives
without surpassing my limits.

1216
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,160
[shouts] Agreed, fellas?

1217
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:12,330
[Nozel] Undoubtedly.

1218
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:18,170
We will show you our power!
What makes us Magic Knights!

1219
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,170
Yuno! We’ve got your back covered.

1220
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:21,930
[music intensifies]

1221
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:24,140
[Fuegoleon] You stay focused on attacking.

1222
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:28,430
[music ends]

1223
01:08:33,690 --> 01:08:34,560
[Jester] Oh yeah?

1224
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:38,650
[yawns] Well, at least you'll talk less
when I've killed you.

1225
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,990
This so-called backup of yours?

1226
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:44,700
They’ve been chained up all day
while we siphoned off their magical power

1227
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:46,780
to fuel our magnificent fortress.

1228
01:08:46,870 --> 01:08:50,290
These guys are beat. I’m surprised
they can even stand at this point!

1229
01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:54,290
What good are these empty vessels
gonna do you? [laughs] Oh, don’t tell me!

1230
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:57,840
You think you can stand against me
'cause you've got nerve?

1231
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,300
Fine! Go ahead and try it!

1232
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:03,300
But nobody can bounce back
from being drained that quickly!

1233
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,430
[dramatic piano music playing]

1234
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,430
You call yourself a Wizard King,
but you know so little.

1235
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:11,310
Not a chance!

1236
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:15,810
[Jester roaring] Come at me, you bastards!

1237

01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,140
Your turn! Grey!

1243
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:48,850
[warbling] Okay!

1244
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:51,520
[shouting] Magic Conversion!

[music ends]

1248
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:11,200
[quavering] Thank you
for getting me out of the way!

1249
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,830
[Noelle] I may not be able
to use strong magic,

1250
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:16,000
but I can still help without my grimoire.

1251
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,750
-Looks like we’ll be able to handle him.
-[chuckles]

1252
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:23,170
Yes, if Asta's successful,
the Wizard Kings will be felled.

1253
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:26,180
If he touches their sword
with his Demon-Slayer Sword,

1254
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:27,640
this will all be over.

1255
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:30,640
All we have to do
is keep him occupied here

1256
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,430
until he’s able to do that.

1257
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:35,060
What a pathetic showing.

1258
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:39,060
Take heed of my words. For your sake.

1259

Turn your tails and run.

1260

Hide somewhere
our eyes will not reach you.

1261

-Wow. Nice of you to warn us, grandpa.
-[footsteps approaching]

1262
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:49,160
Gotta say I’m confused.

1263
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:51,490
I thought your whole goal
was to kill us off.

1264
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:54,120
[man] If you were
corrupt nobles and royals

1265
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,910
who only thought of
what would benefit yourselves,

1266
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,870
then I would take no mercy on you.

1267
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,710
But you’re not.

1268
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:05,630
I can tell from where I stand
that you possess hearts that are pure.

-Retreat!
-[gasps]

1270

If you swear to stay out of our way,

1271
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:11,430
I give you my word
that I'll allow you to escape.

1272
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:14,100
[laughs] Are you for real?

1273
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:17,600
You want us to do nothing
while the bad guys ruin everything?

1274
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:19,190
Don't you know?

1275
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,690
[all] We wouldn't retreat
if our lives depended on it!

[man] You honestly thought
you could beat me

1282
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:48,670
when you attack with such
insignificant levels of magical power?

1283
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:54,350
My Mana Zone lowers the temperature
of this environment far below freezing!

1284

[man] I don’t understand,

1289
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:12,490
were you not all so oppressed
by this society?

1290
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:15,490
Why do you reject our goal
of a fairer world?

1291

-[Noelle] Yeah, you don’t get it.
-Hmm?

[Noelle] Magic Knights
will give their all to survive.

1293
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:25,000
Even if it’s hard,
there’s no way we’re giving up.

1294
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:28,510
You have no right

Hmm.

Indeed.

1298
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,470
No man has that right.

1299
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:39,850
That’s exactly why things must change.

1300
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:42,810
I’ll do what I must to create a society

1301
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:46,320
where outsiders and the powerless
can lead happy lives.

1302

You made me raise my fist against you.

1419
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:27,720
[Princia] If I’d had someone like you
around in my day,

1420
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:31,050
perhaps my loneliness
wouldn’t have been so all-consuming.

1421
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,720
Goodbye, Mereoleona.

1422
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:42,360
[scoffs] Round three.

1423
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:44,730
Huh.

1424
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:48,110
[Mereoleona] This battle…

1425
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:52,700
[roaring] …isn’t over yet!

1426

01:19:57,450 --> 01:19:59,620
[Princia] Wait. Her power increased?!

1429
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:01,370
Explain!

1430
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,710
[shouting] How can you still move?

1431
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:07,380
Uh. Hey there.

1432
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:08,970
Sup, Lady Mereoleona?

1433
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:10,510
Good morning, big sis!

1434
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:13,680
[all] Good morning, Lady Mereoleona!

'Cause I've got grit!

1438
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:24,060
Also…

1439
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:27,900
if I kick the bucket in a place like this…

1440
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:32,320
[roaring] …those idiots
will think they can laugh at me!

[grunts, groans]

1444
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:52,180
And there’s another thing.

1445
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:55,800
If I’m not the strongest,

1446
01:20:55,890 --> 01:20:58,970
then I can't call a certain someone…

1447
01:20:59,060 --> 01:21:01,730
[roaring] …my rival anymore!

1448
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:06,820
[Princia] You draw strength
from your comrades, aye?

1449
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:08,610
Not bad.

1450
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:11,820
But I must admit it’s not my style.
[growling] Still…

1451
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,580
You’ve done well, Mereoleona!

1452
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:21,410
[chuckling] Honestly,
I think you could beat me in a fistfight.

1453
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:22,830
So let’s see!

1454
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:27,790
Are you powerful enough
to best me when I go all-out?!

1455
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:30,590
[Jester] Oh jeez.

1456
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:33,050
You’re really feisty for a baby knight.

1457
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:35,590
You even made me use my trump card.

1458
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:39,100
If I had met you
when I was still the Wizard King,

1459
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:41,850
I might have made you one of my advisers.

1460
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,100
Maybe!

1461
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:46,100
[tense music playing]

1462
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:49,360
What you’re doing is not right!

1463
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:51,860
Don’t gimme that.

1464
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:55,030
No one actually knows
what’s right and what’s wrong,

1465
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:57,870
so you don't get to make that judgment!

1466
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:00,240
We’re basically the same!

1467
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:03,000
[shouting] Conrad and I have big dreams,

1468
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:07,080
and there's nothing we won't do
to bring those dreams to life!

1469
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:13,970
I get you. In a battle like this, the idea
of right and wrong kinda falls apart.

1470
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:17,760
So we’ll have to protect
what matters to us!

1471
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:21,390
Until we have nothing left to give!

You haven't won.

01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:45,790
A little scratch
isn’t enough to take me out.

1482
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:47,540
[Yuno] That’s a shame.

1483
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:49,540
Asta, I’m borrowing your move.

1484
01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:54,800
Here’s where we are alike.

I don’t care about saving power
for the fortress anymore.

1489
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:20,240
I’ll pour everything we’ve got…

[screaming maniacally]
…into crushing you fools!

1491

[Conrad] Why can’t you accept
that I’m right?

1492
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,300
There's not a single part
of this unjust world

1493
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:38,840
worth protecting, boy!

1494
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:43,180
[shouting] Join me!
Let us build a new reality together!

1495
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:51,350
[Asta] I don’t care about you
or your insane ideas.

1496
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:54,940
My dream is to become the Wizard King!

1497
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:55,860
What nonsense.

1498
01:23:56,480 --> 01:24:00,610
Becoming a Wizard King changes nothing
in this kingdom, believe me.

1499
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:02,950
No.

1500

I have you completely surrounded.

That sword of yours will never touch me!

No matter how much fire is in your heart,
this is beyond you!

1511
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:58,420
I’ll make you an offer one last time.

1512
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:01,420
Stand beside us, Asta.

1513
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,510
I'll even name you as my successor.

1514

You’re crazy! Hell, no!

1517
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,690
You don’t ask someone
to make you the Wizard King!

1518
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:23,320
You earn the title
through your own merits!

1519
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,700
And you’re wrong. I can stop you.

1520

If there isn’t a way…

1521

[shouting] …I’ll make one!

1522
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:39,250
Y’know what this world taught me?

1523
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:42,220
To go harder and surpass my limits!

1524
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:47,220
[groans]

1525
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:52,180
[Conrad calmly] Good.
That was an impressive attack.

1526
01:25:52,270 --> 01:25:55,100
And out of respect, I didn’t parry it.

1527
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:58,570
But I tire of hearing your naïve notions.

1528

[Asta grunts]

1529
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:02,570
[Conrad] And I'm done

If we cannot walk this path together,

there’s no point in holding back anymore.

1532
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:12,580
Asta, I didn’t ask you
to join our cause because of your power.

1533
01:26:12,660 --> 01:26:16,460
That would be welcome
but wholly unnecessary.

1534
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:19,670
Nor was it because you know
this nation’s inequalities.

1535
01:26:20,170 --> 01:26:23,880
I simply wanted someone
with the same determination as me

1536
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:25,760
to be rewarded in life.

1537
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:30,810
Unfortunately, you chose
to keep your eyes clenched firmly shut!

1538
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:33,350
What a shame.

someone like you the Wizard King.

1576
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:15,550
Crap. If I let my guard down,
my black form is done for.

1577
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:18,770
I need to land a solid hit
with everything I’ve got left.

1578
01:29:18,850 --> 01:29:22,020
You have a skewed idea
of what a king is capable of.

1579
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:24,770
-[groaning]
-You think the Wizard King's all powerful.

1580
01:29:24,850 --> 01:29:28,780
But none were able to bring revolution
to this nation, including the first!

1581
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:33,400
In fact, Julius did quite the opposite
when he was beaten by the elves.

1582
01:29:33,490 --> 01:29:35,780
-Or have you forgotten?!
-[groaning]

1583
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:39,740
[Conrad] Because of him,
the Clover Kingdom almost met its doom!

1584
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:42,160
Changing nothing! Protecting nothing!

1585
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:45,670
[shouting] Every Wizard King
has been effectively useless.

1586
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,750
-[weakly] It's not like that.
-[Conrad] Hmm?

1587
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:52,590
[Asta] You're forgetting
that the current Wizard King

1588
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:55,640
gave his own life to protect his citizens.

1589
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:58,300
Exactly like the first one did.

1590
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:02,640
And even after he’d given everything
to keep the kingdom safe,

1591
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:03,940
he kept on sleeping,

1592
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:06,810
waiting for hundreds of years.

1593
01:30:07,690 --> 01:30:08,940
And do you know why?

1594
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:11,730
[yells] All so when we needed him again,
he’d be there!

1595
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:13,690
[hard rock music playing]

1596
01:30:15,860 --> 01:30:19,780
[narrator] The leaves of a clover
are said to each contain one thing.

1597
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:23,620
In the first three
dwells integrity, hope, and love.

1598
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,710
The fourth leaf
is given over to good luck.

1599
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:30,380
And in the fifth, there lives the devil.

1600
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:32,960
[demonic laughter]

1601
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:36,590
Is he seriously about to die again?

1602
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:38,640
This kid's such a piece of work.

1603
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:43,140
I suppose I’ll help, and then later,
I'll collect my payment in full.

1604
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:47,480
Enough talk.

1605
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,560
You were able to become the Wizard King

1606
01:30:49,650 --> 01:30:52,230
because a bunch of people
recognized your virtues!

1607
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:56,240
And betraying those people
makes you unfit to carry the title!

1608
01:30:57,820 --> 01:30:58,950
You’re just a fake!

1609
01:30:59,530 --> 01:31:00,370
[groans]

1610
01:31:00,910 --> 01:31:05,290
'Cause a real Wizard King
inspires the people he protects!

1611
01:31:05,790 --> 01:31:08,540
He gives them a dream to chase after.

1612
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:11,460
He's the opposite of useless!

1613
01:31:13,090 --> 01:31:17,510
You still don’t understand
the true nature of the place you live.

1614
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:21,600
Discrimination and prejudice run rampant.
You know that!

1615
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:26,020
Haven’t you seen people’s hopes and dreams
crushed over and over again in this land?

1616
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:29,650
[shouting] Without my help,
this country will never change!

1617
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:32,900
[Asta] Our future
is not for you to decide!

1618
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:37,490
Right now, no matter how rich
or royal someone is,

1619
01:31:37,570 --> 01:31:41,200
everybody works together
to make sure we all live a better life!

1620
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,080
So stay out of our way!

1621
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:46,910
[Conrad] Such insignificant improvements
will never break the cycle.

1622
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,960
[shouting] You’re the one
in the way of progress!

1623
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,550
There you are.
Took long enough, but I feel like

1624
01:31:57,630 --> 01:32:01,090
I'm finally getting a taste
of what the real you is all about!

1625
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:02,050
[grunts]

1626
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:03,300
[Conrad] Shut up!

1627
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:06,390
I will no longer suffer
the fantasies of a child

1628
01:32:06,470 --> 01:32:10,560
who knows nothing
of the real world! [groans]

1629
01:32:12,690 --> 01:32:15,070
[hiccups] Not good.

1630
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:17,110
My black form is coming undone!

1631
01:32:17,190 --> 01:32:21,740
[Conrad] I admit, there was a time
I trusted this country and its citizens.

1632
01:32:21,820 --> 01:32:25,870
When I was the Wizard King, I championed
the incremental changes you speak of.

1633
01:32:25,950 --> 01:32:28,620
But people are always bound to betray you.

1634
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:31,120
I’m sure you know something about that.

1635
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:35,250
So a small portion of your community
has changed for the better,

1636
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:37,550
do you honestly think
the rest of the country

1637
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:39,510
will alter their behavior as well?

1638
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:42,260
It’s not about change.

1639
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:46,260
It’s about coming together!
You wanna world in your own image!

1640
01:32:46,850 --> 01:32:50,730
A place where you’re actually the only one
with the freedom to be happy.

1641
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:52,810
Well, I wanna laugh with everyone!

1642
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:55,520
I want my friends to smile, always.

1643
01:32:56,020 --> 01:33:00,190
That’s why we're gonna bring change
to this country together!

1644
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:04,120
You’ll all form a nation
full of citizens who respect each other.

1645
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,280
One where laughter is everywhere!

1646
01:33:06,990 --> 01:33:09,500
That’s the kind of world
I’m gonna make a reality!

1647
01:33:17,250 --> 01:33:19,010
-[grunts softly]

-Yeah!
-[triumphant music playing]

1652
01:33:37,150 --> 01:33:38,900
You struggle in vain.

1653
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:42,320
This defiance only keeps you
from living in an ideal world.

1654
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:44,860
Why fight against me?

1655
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:49,080
[Noelle] A truly ideal world,

1656
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:52,080
isn’t something
you have to force on other people!

1657
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:54,580
[yells] It’s something
we have to earn ourselves!

1658
01:33:55,170 --> 01:33:57,290
Noelle! Here! Look at me!

1659

Mirror Magic: Mirror Brigade!

[dramatic choral music playing]

1661
01:34:05,550 --> 01:34:09,100
[Noelle] The truth is
I used to resent this life as well.

1662
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:10,930
I was abandoned by my family

1663
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:13,680
because I couldn't learn
to control my magic powers.

1664
01:34:14,190 --> 01:34:17,190
For a while,
I thought I was alone in this world.

1665
01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:20,980
But now, I have amazing friends!

1666
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:24,280
Ones who make sure I know that I belong.

1667
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:27,570
They accepted me and my shortcomings.

1668
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:29,200
[shouts] And they support me!

1669
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:32,500
They stand beside me
as I race forward toward my dreams!

This kingdom can get better.
We’re not fated to stay as we are now.

1688
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,970
We will not let you
take that chance away from us!

1689
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:27,680
Hear me?!

1690

-It’s our world.

Do you give up?

Because I’m not finished yet.

1698
01:35:52,830 --> 01:35:54,830
I can do this all day if you like.

1699

-However…
-Hmm?

1700
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:03,960
A better choice would be to work together.

1701
01:36:05,050 --> 01:36:06,880
[Asta] I don’t mean to brag.

1702
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,680
I can’t do anything
without the help of my friends.

1703
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,760
I nearly died a bunch of times,
but with them at my side,

1704
01:36:13,850 --> 01:36:16,560
I’ve been able to come
further than I thought possible!

to wake up and start a new day!

You don't make something like that
by killing a bunch of people!

It’s Noelle. Noelle Silva.

A noble? Yes, of course.

1719

I see now.

You're a good girl, Noelle.

You're a royal,
and yet you can empathize with the weak.

You gotta be kidding me. What a joke.

can still keep fighting.

01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:47,860
But unfortunately, it’s my turn to sleep.

[breathily] I did it.

1732
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:00,040
[chuckling] I took him out, everyone!

[Conrad] No. Not yet.

1736
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:12,590
This is a forbidden spell.

1737
01:38:12,670 --> 01:38:15,970
One activated in exchange for my life!

1738

[shouts] Doom’s Gate!

1739
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:26,350
Argh!

1740
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:30,190
[Conrad] One more chance.

1741
01:38:30,270 --> 01:38:34,190
I will not give up
on achieving my goal, Asta!

[Asta moans, breathes shakily]

1745
01:38:48,210 --> 01:38:52,380
[weakly] That’s fine.
'Cause I’m not done yet either.

1746
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:54,920
I’m gonna be

1747
01:38:55,470 --> 01:38:56,380
the Wizard King.

1748
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:58,890
So I’ll keep standing.

1749
01:38:58,970 --> 01:39:00,600
No matter what.

1750
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:04,390
[shouting] Just watch me!

-Come on!
-["Haruk Amirai" by Kankaku Piero playing]

[roaring] Let’s finish this!

1753
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:10,810
Asta!

1754
01:39:12,020 --> 01:39:13,150
[groans]

1755
01:39:16,990 --> 01:39:18,820
[Julius] I've got something for you.

1756
01:39:20,740 --> 01:39:22,200
What do you mean?

1757
01:39:22,990 --> 01:39:25,660
[Julius] You won't need an explanation.

1758
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:27,670
That sword will lead the way.

1759
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:30,920
-The future of this nation…
-[Asta] This magic…

1760
01:39:31,630 --> 01:39:32,800
…lies with you.

1761
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,130
[chuckles]

1762
01:39:38,260 --> 01:39:39,130
[Asta] I feel it.

1763
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:42,600
This power is coming from everyone!

1764
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:45,390
It's their hopes and dreams.

1765
01:39:49,690 --> 01:39:53,020
I feel your spirits flowing through me!

1766
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:57,700
Stop, Master Nacht! What are you doing?

1767
01:39:58,360 --> 01:39:59,610
You've gotta slow down.

1768
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:03,200
You’ve worked yourself ragged
since you got back to the Clover Kingdom.

1769
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:07,870
If you give up any more magical power,
you're gonna pass out for sure!

1770
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:10,830
A nice long nap
doesn’t sound like the worst idea.

1771
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:15,750
Especially if it means someone who’s doing
a good thing gets rewarded.

1772
01:40:18,970 --> 01:40:19,930
[Asta] Right here.

1773
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:21,970
Right now.

1774
01:40:22,550 --> 01:40:23,800
Everyone.

1775
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:25,140
[music continues]

1776
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:30,480
We'll all surpass our limits.

1777
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:35,730
[Conrad] The Imperial Sword?

1778
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:38,990
What good do you think that will do you?

1779
01:40:42,070 --> 01:40:43,990
Asta. Do it.

Come on!

1788
01:41:15,860 --> 01:41:18,780
Why are you so hell-bent on destruction?

1789
01:41:18,860 --> 01:41:20,820
I see things as they are.

1790
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:22,280
This country must burn!

1791
01:41:23,070 --> 01:41:25,530
The nation is rotten to the core!

1792
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:29,200
Its very foundation
must be razed and rebuilt anew!

1793
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:32,410
Stand aside! I have to save everyone!

1794
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:34,040
I'm back

1795
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:39,340
Who exactly do you mean by "everyone"?
Those you deem worthy?

1796
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:42,630
No! Those who are oppressed
and without hope in their lives.

1797
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:45,470
For their sake, I will create--

1798

[music continues]

1799

[Conrad shakily] I…

1800
01:42:00,110 --> 01:42:01,820
I… will…

1801
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:07,910
[Asta] Even if you’re a peasant
and don’t have magical power,

1802
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:11,330
you can still be
the strongest person in the world.

1803
01:42:11,410 --> 01:42:13,750
You can be everyone’s hope.

1804
01:42:14,670 --> 01:42:17,500
You’ll see. I’ll prove it to you, Conrad!

1805
01:42:21,090 --> 01:42:22,800
One day…

1806
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:25,470
[shouting] …I’ll be the Wizard King!

1807

1810
01:42:53,410 --> 01:42:55,000
just defeat me?

1811
01:42:56,710 --> 01:42:58,210
How strange.

1812
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:00,590
If that’s the case,

1813
01:43:01,130 --> 01:43:02,630
why do I feel so at ease?

1814
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:07,340
Ah.

1815
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:10,010
Now it’s making sense.

1816
01:43:11,180 --> 01:43:14,560
Asta. Become the Wizard King.

1817
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:19,400
And then share the warm world
you hold in your heart

1818
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:21,320
with every citizen in this nation.

1819
01:43:22,270 --> 01:43:24,480
Your magic is 'never giving up.'

1820
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:26,570
So I know you can do it.

1821

[birds twittering]

1827
01:44:07,490 --> 01:44:09,990
[Julius] Conrad used to be
cheerful and honest.

1828
01:44:10,070 --> 01:44:12,870
When he saw people struggling,
he empathized with them.

1829
01:44:13,660 --> 01:44:14,950
Everyone loved him.

1830
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:16,870
He was strong and kind.

1831
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:18,460
A man not unlike Asta.

1832
01:44:19,620 --> 01:44:22,000
But he was framed by the royalists.

1833
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:25,380
His wife and his comrades
were slaughtered as a result, and after…

1834
01:44:26,130 --> 01:44:27,840
he was never the same again.

1835
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:32,890
Asta, thank you for stopping him.

1836
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:35,680
I’m confused.

1837
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:38,930
Why was I able to tap into
the Imperial Sword there at the end?

1838
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:39,890
What do you mean?

1839
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:43,480
When we were fighting,
I hit him with my Demon-Slayer Sword.

1840
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:46,110
Its magic must have been neutralized.

1841
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:48,190
So what happened?

1842
01:44:50,110 --> 01:44:52,070
Ah, that’s simple.

1843
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:53,570
[mystical music playing]

[Julius] Generations of Wizard Kings.

1845
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:03,210
They watch these events unfold,

1846
01:45:03,290 --> 01:45:05,590
and they lent
their miraculous power to you.

1847
01:45:05,670 --> 01:45:08,920
Whoa! That’s, like,
the coolest thing I’ve ever heard!

1848
01:45:09,010 --> 01:45:11,340
Oh, calm down.
He’s just teasing you, dummy.

1849
01:45:11,430 --> 01:45:12,720
No, it’s true. I swear!

1850
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:15,010
[Julius] Rest assured, predecessors,

1851
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:19,350
the clovers who will carry this kingdom
into the future, are growing up nicely.

1852
01:45:19,430 --> 01:45:21,350
[Nero] Are you mocking Prince Lumiere?

1853
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:25,270
What do you think, Asta?
Aren’t Wizard Kings incredible?

1854
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:26,400
Yes, sir!

1855
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:29,480
And one day,
I’ll be an incredible person too.

1856
01:45:29,570 --> 01:45:32,240

Do you have any idea how hard I fought?!

Mmm?

1864
01:49:39,190 --> 01:49:40,530
The place was in shambles,

1865
01:49:40,610 --> 01:49:43,530
but it looks like it’ll get rebuilt
faster than I expected.

[Yuno] Yeah.

Conrad.

1868
01:49:51,450 --> 01:49:52,910
He was a Wizard King.

so it's fine.

[Asta] Not so fast! We both know
I'll be the one calling the shots--
