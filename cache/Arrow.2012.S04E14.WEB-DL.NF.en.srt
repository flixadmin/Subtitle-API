1
00:00:00,708 --> 00:00:03,253
THEA: Merritt Davis
will be moderating the debate.

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:06,089
There'll be a podium there,
another one there.

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,008
And according to tradition,

4
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:11,010
the selections made
by some coin toss thingy.

5
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,429
Mr. Queen.

6
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,557
At last we meet.

7
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,936
Ms. Adams. I'm just curious,
is Adams your maiden name?

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,604
Oh, I'm not married, actually.

9
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:22,814
-Really?
-ADAMS: Hmm.

10
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,857
Well, I'm sure you just haven't met
the right person yet.

11
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:28,320
Well, it is lovely to finally meet you.

12
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:31,448
An unconventional candidate
to say the least.

13
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,532
Bit of a dark horse yourself.

14
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,993
Just meaning that your candidacy
seems to have come out of nowhere.

15
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,872
Well, generally, I prefer to keep
my philanthropic works quiet,

16
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:43,501
but the city is in simply too much trouble
for me to remain in the shadows.

17
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,753
Yes, it is.
The people destroying our homes

18
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,589
need to be fought in the light of day.

19
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:52,719
Well, I hope that we have
a productive debate, Mr. Queen.

20
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,803
I look forward to it.

21
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,515
Miss Adams...

22
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,934
More like "Mrs. Deceitful Darhk."

23
00:01:00,017 --> 00:01:01,603
Feel like "Adams" probably polls better.

24
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:04,147
You know, it's not like we can prove
that "Adams" isn't her real last name.

25
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,482
How is our opposition research coming?

26
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,235
Ah, nothing yet, she's apparently clean.

27
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:11,696
But, the more we do digging into her
and her background,

28
00:01:11,779 --> 00:01:13,740
the more likely
she is gonna dig into ours.

29
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,991
I think that's our cue.

30
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,578
Hey, wait. I really need you to take
a look at these engagement party invites.

31
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,996
My mom's been hounding me.

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,123
The envelope is very pink.

33
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,749
I know. Wait, don't...

...open it.

seen that one comin'.

38
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,258
-Maybe less glitter.
-You look good in glitter.

39
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,675
Yeah, let's move out.

40
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,971
The valet's bringin' up her car.

41
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:39,056
All right, Laurel's got the eyeball.
You should move.

42
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,315
Are you gonna be all right in here?

43
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,650
Oh, yeah. Great Wi-Fi.

44
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,695
Over watch, on.

45
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,699
I've got her approaching 7th.

46

<i>You think she's headed
to her house again?</i>

47

we trailed her, you mean?

with Darhk somehow.

You had an appointment with my husband
the other week.

64
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,348
He does not take kindly to being stood up.

65

And he has a little something to say
about you stalking his wife, as well.

GREEN ARROW: She got away, again.

72
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,108
{\an8}Okay. So clearly,
we're not gonna find Darhk

73
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:55,360
{\an8}by tailing his wife.

74
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,779
{\an8}Yeah, well, it's not like we have
a lot of moves left to make.

75
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,366
{\an8}Darhk is gone, well, dark
ever since Machin attacked his family.

76
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,451
{\an8}Darhk is not afraid of Machin.

77
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,995
{\an8}He's just...
His plan's gone to a new phase.

78
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,789
{\an8}And how do you know that?

79
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,166
{\an8}Because HIVE spent months trying
to cripple this city's leadership.

80
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,834
{\an8}They discouraged people
from running for mayor.

81
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,920
{\an8}They even tried to co-opt my candidacy.

82
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,005
{\an8}Yeah, then Mrs. Evil
threw her hat in the ring.

83
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:17,089
There has to be a reason.

84
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:21,678
Darhk did not try and destroy Star City
so that his wife could be mayor.

85
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,847
There's something that we're not seeing.

{\an8}Oh, I can see it, clear as a day.

I am giddy to report that Phase Four

00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,266
There's still some concern

00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:31,325
we're gonna have
a champagne tower right here, whoo-hoo,

153
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,078
{\an8}and we're gonna play games
over by the fireplace.

154
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:36,372
{\an8}Oh, oh, oh. I brought my favorite,

155
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,500
{\an8}-"Pin the junk on the hunk." (CHUCKLES)
-FELICITY: Oh, my God.

156
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,418
{\an8}Sorry! Is this bad timing?

157
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,795
{\an8}For who?

158
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:43,963
{\an8}Is everything okay?

159
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,548
{\an8}-Yeah. We got to, uh...
-Yeah.

160
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,509
{\an8}Uh... (CHUCKLES) Where are you going?

161
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,427
{\an8}Duty calls. Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

162
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,138
{\an8}(CLEARS THROAT) Is everything okay?

163
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:54,306
{\an8}So, Alex got a phone call from
one of the lawyers

164
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,225
{\an8}doing research on the opposition

165
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:58,269
{\an8}and it looks like
they might've found something.

166
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,646
{\an8}On Ruvé?

167
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,813
{\an8}On you, actually.

168
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:06,486
{\an8}In 2013, Homeland Security
did a tax audit after the Undertaking.

169
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:10,490
And, looks like Mom wrote
a million-dollar check

170
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,409
to some woman named Samantha Clayton.

171
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,079
I mean, Alex flagged it
as something potentially weird for us.

172
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,748
And by weird, he means...

173
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,332
Well, the check was never cashed.

174
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,711
So, why would Mom write a check
for a million dollars

175
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,421
to a woman young enough to be her daughter

176
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,423
and why would that woman
not cash the check?

177
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,216
I don't know.

178
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,468
Should I look into this Samantha person?

179
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,595
I don't really see the point.

180
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,182
I mean, whatever was going
on with this Samantha person,

181
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,518
uh, clearly she wanted nothing
to do with Mom.

182
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,687
And either way, I don't... It's just...

183
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,565
I don't see how something like this
would blow back on me.

184
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,441
Thank you.

185
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,860
Okay.

186
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,952
Everything is unfolded
according to providence.

187
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,788
What do you think is under there anyway?

188
00:08:58,871 --> 00:08:59,997
Power, Mr. Queen.

189
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,668
I'm glad you have recuperated.

190
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,546
We have much to accomplish together.

191
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,014
Reiter's pet.

192
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,643
You don't know what you're talking about.

193
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,981
I know you killed Vlad.
I watched, we all did.

194
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,150
What are you going to do?
Kill him right in front of Reiter's men?

195
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:32,071
They don't care what we do to him.
They remember what he did to Conklin.

196
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,909
Maybe you men need to go
for a drink or somethin'.

197
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,077
(CHUCKLES)

198
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,799
A 6-0-2's breaking and entering,

199
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,927
why would they need backup
in the form of a police captain?

200
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,846
I told you, we're short-handed.

201
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,183
Don't worry.
It's not a job for Black Canary.

202
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:13,613
SCPD! Anyone here?

203
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,547
(BEEPS)

204
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,007
(LINE RINGING)

205
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,176
Yeah, this is Lance. Get me dispatch.

206
00:10:35,342 --> 00:10:36,343
(THUDDING)

207
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:41,015
-LAUREL: Dad!
-(GROANS)

208
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,184
Come on. (GRUNTING)

209
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,144
Thought I told you to stay in the car.

210
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,021
Yeah, you're welcome. (EXCLAIMS)

211
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,152
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

212
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,159
Come on! Come on! Go! Go, get out!

213
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,748
Over here... Come on!

214
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,298
Go, go, go, go!

215
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,767
Are you okay?

216
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,311
(PANTING) What the hell was that?

217
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,897
I don't know. It's like the building
attacked me or something.

218
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,360
But that's not possible. Is it?

219
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,283
Captain, you move again
and it's gonna leave a even bigger scar.

220
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,746
-What happened?
-Ugh. Your guess is as good as mine.

221
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,206
It's like the Big Bad Wolf
huffed or puffed or somethin'.

222
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,290
This wolf being Darhk.

223
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,001
Why do you think they went through
so much trouble

224
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,293
to make it look like an accident?

225
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,670
Maybe they didn't wanna take the heat
of killing a police captain.

226
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,297
Thanks for the needlepoint.

227
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,216
Where are you going?

228
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,844
Yeah, if Damien Darhk
has you in his gun sights,

229
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,888
it might not be a good idea
to show yourself in the open.

230
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,348
-Uh, I'm meeting with Donna.
-FELICITY: Oh, she's fine.

231
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:07,309
She's probably just playing
"Pin the Junk on the Hunk" or something.

232
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:09,145
-What?
-Do not ask. Do not ask.

233
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,022
Stay here, for a minute,
and let us do what we do.

234
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,649
Look, I'm gonna check with Andy.
See if he's ever seen HIVE

235
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,733
use these tactics before.

236
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,902
Besides, I'm on daddy duty.

237
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,653
Now that Lyla's the head of A.R.G.U.S.

238
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,239
I'm gonna try and backtrace the call
that supposedly came from dispatch.

239
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,074
I am...

240
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,076
Going to go work on your debate prep?

241
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,203
Yeah.

242
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,875
Debate prep, just took the words
right out of my mouth.

243
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:31,959
Yep.

244
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,505
This man deserves to die, he tortured us.

245
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:38,215
And he saved me.

246
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,260
At great risk to himself,
he kept me alive.

247
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,847
I have more reason than anyone
to hate this man.

248
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,309
-But he's our best chance of going home.
-He killed your brother.

249
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,102
Yes, he did.

250
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,438
Tell them why.

251
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,773
The guard, Conklin,

252
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:56,859
he put Vlad up to it.

253
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,322
I was defending myself, he attacked me.

254
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,450
Now, I...

255
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:11,457
I know that you have no reason
to trust me, but I am not your enemy.

256
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:19,131
All I want to do is stop Reiter
and get all of you out of this place.

257
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:20,967
So prove it.

258
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,218
How?

259
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,761
Kill Conklin.

260
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,682
(SIGHS)

261
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,151
Aside from my brother,
have you killed before?

262
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,654
Yeah.

263
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,324
There was a man in Hong Kong.

264
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,535
And I did terrible things to him.

265
00:13:50,787 --> 00:13:52,123
And that made me a monster.

266
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:56,085
And you're afraid killing Conklin
will make you into this monster again?

267
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,338
Good.

268
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,509
It takes a monster to fight monsters.

269
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,225
I like this midday summons. (LAUGHS)

270
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,394
It's very mysterious,

271
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,398
very sexy.

272
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,027
Pooh Bear, what happened to you?

273
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,778
-It's nothing.
-Uh, no, baby.

274
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,071
-Listen, sweet...
-It doesn't look like nothing.

275
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,282
Oh, my gosh, come sit down.

276
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:31,537
Aw, my big, tough, police captain baby.

277
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,664
-Can I make it all...
-No. No, no. Listen to me.

278
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,374
We can't see each other for a while.

279
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,335
-What?
-Yeah, it's a thing I got into.

280
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,712
-I owe some guys some money.
-(CHUCKLES)

281
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,632
You gamble? Mr. Straight and Narrow?

282
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:46,427
Yeah. Yeah, I know you helped me,
uh, cope after I quit drinking.

283
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,931
And I've pissed off some
pretty tough customers and...

284
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:55,852
Wait a minute, wait, honey, please,
please, I'm a Vegas girl, okay?

285
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,272
Whomever you owe money to

286
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:02,359
is gonna have to get up pretty early
in the morning to take me on.

287
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,362
-So, don't worry.
-Sweetheart,

288
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,572
it's a little more complicated than that.

289
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,823
(SIGHS)

290
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,575
Just for a few weeks that's all.

291
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,328
That's it.

292
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,412
You know,

293
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,165
how about we make it longer?

294
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,625
-What?
-My ex-husband was a lying son-of-a-bitch.

295
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,920
Only two good things
came out of that marriage,

296
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,047
my daughter and my BS detector,
which is flawless.

297
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,258
And right now, yeah, it's redlining.

298
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,677
-Donna, you, don't, please...
-Don't... Oh, my God.

299
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,179
Don't "Donna" me.

300
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,556
You know what,
this is actually very simple.

301
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:37,186
You either respect me enough
to tell me the truth or you don't.

302
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,273
Clearly, you don't.

303
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:44,193
-Donna, please listen...
-(SIGHS)

304
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,447
-Hey, Mom.
-Oh, hey, hun.

305
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,991
(STUTTERS) Uh, I'm fine.

306
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,995
What did you do?

307
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,955
(STUTTERS) Why you think it's me
that did something?

308
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,164
Because you're a man.

309
00:15:57,914 --> 00:16:00,792
I'm trying to put
some distance between us,

310
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,044
in case Darhk is after me,

311
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,964
because I can't stand the idea of anything
happening to her, Felicity.

312
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,008
-Yeah, but she looked pretty upset.
-QUENTIN: Yeah.

313
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,179
Oliver's not here.

314
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,805
I was looking for you.

315
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,807
I found something.

316
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,605
The 6-0-2 didn't come
from SCPD dispatch at all.

317
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:23,440
Someone just made it look like it did.

318
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,276
That "someone" being HIVE,
you're thinking.

319
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,403
There's an encryption on it
that uses the same cipher

320
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,904
of a HIVE sat-phone that Merlyn gave us.

321
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,490
-One more time.
-They lured you to the hotel.

322
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,699
Do we know where the call came from?

323
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,825
Price and 14th.

324
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,078
Bunch of other calls
came from there as well,

325
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,413
I'm guessing,
it's their base of operations.

326
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,415
Okay. Contact the team
and have them meet me there.

327
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,499
Yep.

328
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:48,924

329
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,679
Job seems easy enough.

330
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,848
Don't get cocky.
Darhk won't tolerate another screw-up.

331
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,647
Where's Jack?

and not what's on the laptop's hard drive

351
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,875
because there are three nails
running straight through this thing.

352
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,711
(SIGHS) Yeah, the bad guys went
a little crazy with that nail gun.

353
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,046
Yeah, according to Andy,

354
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,756
they're called the "Demolition Team."

355
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:56,385
Former GRU, IRA, and Mossad.

356
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,262
They're experts in precision demolition.

357
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,971
Now they work for HIVE.

358
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,224
I got a look at the laptop
before it got shot up.

359
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,560
And there were blueprints on the screen.

360
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,396
So they are gonna take down
another building. Felicity?

361
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,773
I know. The first time we met,

362
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:13,109
the first thing you asked me to do
is pull data off a damaged laptop.

363
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:14,445
It's kind of romantic.

364
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,155
In case the laptop is a dead end,

365
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,865
I am going to work up
a list of potential targets.

366
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,618
Yeah, Andy is supposed
to get some more intel off.

00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,172
What was that about?

372
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,006
(SIGHS) Donna called it quits.

00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:37,926
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

Yeah, yeah, me, too.

375
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:42,723
You're lucky you're with someone
you don't need to keep secrets from.

376
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,686
Are these really necessary?

00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:50,105
Can't risk you jeopardizing
your life again.

378
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,773
You're much too important.

379
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,859
You know, you keep saying that to me.

380
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,694
But I have no idea what you mean.

381
00:19:55,902 --> 00:19:59,281
-Do you believe in destiny, Mr. Queen?
-I prefer the idea of free will.

This map conceals deeper truths.

Secrets I couldn't uncover
without more information,

384
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,956
until you brought these to me.

385
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,336
Except, I didn't bring them to you.
Conklin took them.

Destiny, Mr. Queen.

With the survey maps' details,

388
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:19,551
I was able to decipher the inscriptions
on this,

389
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,221
which you also provided me.

390

the pattern?

within which lies
a device of untold power.

394
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,152

and that rare and that romantic,

436
00:22:45,196 --> 00:22:47,115
it also reminds me that

because he loves you.

pay her a million dollars?

she moved to Central City.

Why haven't you told anyone?

469
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:35,431
Because Samantha said
that the only way that I could see him,

470
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:41,312
is if I promised to not tell him,
or anyone else, that I'm his father.

you are a rich playboy

Hey, I finally found it.
Where's Oliver and Thea?

618
00:31:31,597 --> 00:31:33,808
Oh, they're probably just inside
making sure everyone gets out okay.

619
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,811
You left them inside? Honey, come on,
we need to go help them. Let's go.

not here.

772
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,047
-Palmer Technologies' power cell.
-Exactly.

773
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,008
Once I solved that,
I knew this might actually work.

774
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,885
Oh, my God.

775
00:40:32,262 --> 00:40:33,598
(VOICE BREAKS) I don't know what to say.

776
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:35,390
OLIVER: I do.

777
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:39,604
Curtis, you're terrific. Thank you.

778
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:43,190
No. Well, don't thank me yet.
It still has to work.

779
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:45,693
It'll work. I know it will.
You, come with me.

780
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:49,154
We're about to make my mother
very happy. (CHUCKLES)

781
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,370
-Hi, Daddy.
-Hi, sweetie.

782
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,873
Nora, honey.
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

783
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,626
Nora, this is William.

784
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:04,211
William's mother asked us
to look after him.

785
00:41:04,294 --> 00:41:06,296
He'll be staying with us for a while.

786
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,132
Nice to meet you, William. You wanna play?

787
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,424
Sure.
