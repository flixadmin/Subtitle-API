165
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,184
Your eyes?

166
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,061
Your balls?

167
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,981
We'll find out soon enough.

168
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:45,070
In the morning, then, bastard.

169
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:06,383
JON: If he was smart, he'd stay inside
the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.

170
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:09,469
That's not his way.
He knows the North is watching.

171
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:12,389
If the other houses
sense weakness on his part,

172
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,516
they'll stop fearing him.

173
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,018
He can't have that. Fear is his power.

174
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,436
It's his weakness, too.

175
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,939
His men don't want to fight for him.
They're forced to fight for him.

176
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,315
If they feel the tide turning...

177
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,651
It's not his men that worry me.

178
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,153
It's his horses.

179
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,738
I know what mounted knights can do to us.

180
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:31,658
You and Stannis cut through us
like piss through snow.

181
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,161
We're digging trenches all along our flanks.

182
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:36,288
They won't be able to hit us
the way that Stannis hit you,

183
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:37,581
in a double envelopment.

184
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,378
A pincer move.

185
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,927
They won't be able to hit us from the sides.

186
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:52,762
Good.

187
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:58,393
It's crucial that we let them charge at us.

188
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,105
They've got the numbers,
we need the patience.

189
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,153
If we let him buckle our center, he'll pursue.

190
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,405
Then we'll have him surrounded
on three sides.

191
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:15,493
Did you really think
that cunt would fight you man-to-man?

192
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,662
No.

193
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,081
But I wanted to make him angry.

194
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,086
I want him coming at us full tilt.

195
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,715
We should all get some sleep.

196
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:32,594
TORMUND: Rest, Jon Snow.
We need you sharp tomorrow.

197
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:45,565
So, you've met the enemy,

198
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:47,484
drawn up your battle plans.

199
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,613
Aye, for what they're worth.

200
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:56,409
You've known him
for the space of a single conversation,

201
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,161
you and your trusted advisors,

202
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:02,624
and you sit around making your plans
on how to defeat a man you don't know.

203
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,417
I lived with him.

204
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:08,088
I know the way his mind works.
I know how he likes to hurt people.

205
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:13,510
Did it ever once occur to you
that I might have some insight?

206
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,222
You're right.

207
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,936
You think he's going to fall into your trap.
He won't. He's the one who lays traps.

208
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,981
- He's overconfident.
- He plays with people.

209
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:28,608
He's far better at it than you.
He's been doing it all his life.

210
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:31,820
Aye, and what have I been doing all my life?
Playing with broomsticks?

211
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:35,407
I fought beyond the Wall
against worse than Ramsay Bolton.

212
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,118
I've defended the Wall
from worse than Ramsay Bolton.

213
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,704
You don't know him.

214
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,581
All right, tell me.

215
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,876
What should we do?
How do we get Rickon back?

216
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:50,630
We'll never get him back.

217
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:55,176
Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son,

218
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,222
which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay
than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.

219
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,184
As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim
to Winterfell will be contested,

220
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:06,813
which means he won't live long.

221
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,274
We can't give up on our brother.

222
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:12,444
Listen to me, please.
He wants you to make a mistake.

223
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:13,528
Of course he does.

224
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:15,655
What should I do differently?

225
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,241
I don't know.
I don't know anything about battles.

226
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,202
Just don't do what he wants you to do.

227
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:22,662
Aye, that's good advice.

228
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:25,582
- You think that's obvious?
- Well, it is a bit obvious.

229
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:26,875
If you had asked for my advice earlier,

230
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,626
I would have told you not to attack Winterfell

231
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,920
until we had a larger force,
or is that obvious, too?

232
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,465
When will we have a larger force?

233
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,508
We've pleaded with every house
that'll have us.

234
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:38,887
The Blackfish can't help us.
We're lucky to have this many men.

235
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,432
- It's not enough.
- No, it's not enough. It's what we have.

236
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,648
Battles have been won against greater odds.

237
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:00,617
If Ramsay wins,
I'm not going back there alive.

238
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,952
Do you understand me?

239
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:09,209
I won't ever let him touch you again.

240
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,547
I'll protect you, I promise.

241
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,759
No one can protect me.

242
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,095
No one can protect anyone.

(SIGHS)

244
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:40,990
DAVOS: You think there's hope?

245
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,743
TORMUND: I've never seen
these Bolton fuckers fight.

246
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:47,747
And they've never seen the free folk fight,
so, yes, there's hope.

247
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,128
You want to avenge your king, don't you?

248
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:57,924
It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis.
It was Stannis himself.

249
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:02,929
I loved the man.
He lifted me up and made me something.

250
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,558
But he had demons in his skull
whispering foul things.

251
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,768
- You saw these demons?
- What?

252
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,856
No, it's a manner of speaking.

253
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,818
Not actual demons.

254
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:18,903
Oh.

255
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:24,325
Well, you loved that cunt Stannis
and I loved the man he burned.

256
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,619
Mance didn't have demons in his skull.

257
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:29,914
He didn't torch people
or listen to some red witch.

258
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,584
I believed in him.

259
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:36,588
I thought he was the man
to lead us through the Long Night.

260
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,840
But I was wrong, just like you.

261
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:44,137
Maybe that was our mistake,
believing in kings.

262
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,974
Jon Snow's not a king.

263
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,603
No, he's not.

264
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:58,735
I need a good drink
to help me sleep the night before a fight.

265
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,361
You want some?

266
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,780
I have a jug of sour goat's milk

267
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:07,076
stronger than any of that grape water
you southern twats like sucking on.

268
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,080
No, thanks. It does sound delicious,
but I better keep a clear head.

269
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,083
I can never sleep the night before a battle.

270
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:15,960
So what do you do all night?

271
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:19,088
I walk. Think and walk.

272
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:22,509
Think and walk
until I'm far enough away from camp

273
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:24,511
that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.

00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,264

My lady.

You weren't at the war council.

278
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,164
I'm not a soldier.

279
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:55,959
Any advice?

280
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,711
Don't lose.

281
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,095
If I do, if I fall...

282
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:11,307
Don't bring me back.

283
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,519
I'll have to try.

284
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,396
I'm ordering you not to bring me back.

285
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:17,981
I am not your servant, Jon Snow.

286
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:20,441
You're in my camp. I'm the commander.

287
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:22,235
I serve the Lord of Light.

288
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:25,655
I do what he commands.

289
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,031
How do you know what he commands?

290
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,743
I interpret his signs

291
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,997
as well as I can.

292
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:40,545
If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back,
how did I bring you back?

293
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,673
I have no power.

294
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,719
Only what he gives me, and he gave me you.

295
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:50,847
Why?

296
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,433
I don't know.

297
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:02,025
Maybe you're only needed for
this small part of his plan and nothing else.

298
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,653
Maybe he brought you here to die again.

299
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:13,119
What kind of god
would do something like that?

Last time we saw each other
was at Winterfell, yes?

305
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:16,701
You were making jokes about my height,
I seem to recall.

306
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,080
Everyone who makes a joke
about a dwarf's height

307
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:24,667
thinks he's the only person
ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height.

308
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,254

You're all making the same five or six jokes.

- It was a long time ago.
- It was.

312
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,974
And how have things
been going for you since then?

Not so well, I gather.

Can't imagine you would have murdered
the Stark boys if things had been going well.

I didn't murder the Stark boys.

But I did things
that were just as bad or worse.

growing up at Winterfell.

321
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,831
Never quite knowing who you were.

322
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:07,960
But then, we all live
complicated lives, don't we?

323
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:12,131
You've brought us 100 ships
from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them.

324
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:17,053
In return, I expect you want me to support
your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?

325
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,971
Not my claim. Hers.

326
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:21,140
And what's wrong with you?

327
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:22,725
I'm not fit to rule.

328
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,519
We can agree upon that at least.

329
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,521
Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?

330
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:28,689
No more than Westeros.

331
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,195
Our Uncle Euron returned home
after a long absence.

332
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:37,406
He murdered our father
and took the Salt Throne from Yara.

333
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,493
He would have murdered us if we'd stayed.

334
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:44,622
Lord Tyrion tells me
your father was a terrible king.

335
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,749
You and I have that in common.

336
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:52,046
We do.
And both murdered by a usurper as well.

337
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:54,423
Will their ships be enough?

338
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:58,302
With the former Masters' fleet, possibly.

339
00:27:58,386 --> 00:27:59,428
Barely.

340
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,224
There are more than 100 ships
in the Iron Fleet.

341
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:05,685
There are, and Euron is building more.

342
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:07,395
He's going to offer them to you.

343
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:08,855
So why shouldn't I wait for him?

344
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:11,399
The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing.

345
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:13,693
He also wants to give you...

346
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:16,737
His big cock, I think he said.

347
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:20,908
Euron's offer is also
an offer of marriage, you see.

348
00:28:20,992 --> 00:28:22,785
You won't get one without the other.

349
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:25,454
And I imagine your offer
is free of any marriage demands?

350
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,583
I never demand,
but I'm up for anything, really.

351
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:33,546
He murdered our father
and would have murdered us.

352
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,882
He'll murder you
as soon as you have what he wants.

353
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,550
The Seven Kingdoms.

354
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:38,843
All of them.

355
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:40,803
And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?

356
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:43,639
Your ancestors defeated ours
and took the Iron Islands.

357
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,559
We ask you to give them back.

358
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,060
And that's all?

359
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:50,730
We'd like you to help us
murder an uncle or two

360
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:52,607
who don't think a woman's fit to rule.

361
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,108
Reasonable.

362
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:59,238
What if everyone starts demanding
their independence?

363
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:01,324
She's not demanding, she's asking.

364
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:04,327
The others are free to ask as well.

365
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:11,125
Our fathers were evil men, all of us here.

They left the world worse than they found it.
