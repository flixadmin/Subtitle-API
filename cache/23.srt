1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,139
This season on "The Flash"...

2
00:00:02,164 --> 00:00:04,592
I went back in time and
created an alternate timeline,

3
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:06,109
a whole new existence.

4
00:00:06,143 --> 00:00:08,561
I created Flashpoint
and changed everything.

5
00:00:08,586 --> 00:00:11,554
- Who are you?
- Savitar. The god of speed.

6
00:00:11,556 --> 00:00:13,389
You said that I trapped
you in the future. Where?

7
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:14,924
The only place that could hold me.

8
00:00:14,926 --> 00:00:16,264
The Speed Force.

9
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:18,531
- Iris West, will you marry me?
- Yes!

10
00:00:18,556 --> 00:00:20,429
Dr. Brand invents the technology

11
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:22,264
that traps Savitar in the Speed Force.

12
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:23,899
- Good luck with that.
- We don't wanna fight you.

13
00:00:23,901 --> 00:00:25,581
We're your friends. Your family.

14
00:00:25,606 --> 00:00:27,720
- Caitlin, I love you.
- I never loved any an you.

15
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:29,104
Caitlin is working with Savitar.

16
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:31,628
- Caitlin is dead.
- Not to me.

17
00:00:32,245 --> 00:00:33,654
I know who you are.

18
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,578
I am the future Flash.

19
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,167
When I have control of all of time,

20
00:00:38,192 --> 00:00:41,206
it will be you who is
abandoned and forgotten!

21
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,146
And I only need for Iris to die

22
00:00:43,148 --> 00:00:45,932
so that you are driven
so far into the dark

23
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:47,050
that I can be born.

24
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:49,019
I'm gonna stop you.

25
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:50,186
It didn't work.

26
00:00:50,188 --> 00:00:52,073
You lose, Barry!

27
00:00:52,098 --> 00:00:53,648
No!

28
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:57,754
Iris!

29
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:44,574
Oh, no.

30
00:02:03,143 --> 00:02:04,361
Iris?

31
00:02:04,386 --> 00:02:06,126
Iris?

32
00:02:07,642 --> 00:02:08,923
B.A.?

33
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:11,687
What?

34
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:16,564
B.A.

35
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:18,755
H.R.?

36
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:29,949
Dad.

37
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:37,075
Dad.

38
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:40,811
Baby?

39
00:02:40,813 --> 00:02:42,050
Yeah.

40
00:02:52,157 --> 00:02:54,158
I don't understand.

41
00:02:54,183 --> 00:02:56,066
It was H.R.

42
00:02:58,753 --> 00:03:00,330
Till the next one.

43
00:03:11,143 --> 00:03:12,855
H.R.

44
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:15,088
Hi.

45
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,315
Hi.

46
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,050
Let's get you out of here.

47
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,730
Where is everybody else?

48
00:03:21,755 --> 00:03:23,136
I couldn't tell...

49
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,894
Barry, or Savitar,
would know I was coming.

50
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:28,988
- Let's get you out of here.
- Okay.

51
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:39,065
Get her.

52
00:03:45,105 --> 00:03:47,761
- We can't outrun them.
- No, we can't.

53
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,836
What are you doing?

54
00:04:00,838 --> 00:04:03,558
I'm the reason Savitar found you.

55
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:06,379
- I need to remedy that.
- Not like this.

56
00:04:06,404 --> 00:04:08,393
Give me that. Oh!

57
00:04:11,515 --> 00:04:13,348
Don't! I'm the one he wants.

58
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:16,158
Okay? Please, don't hurt him.

59
00:04:19,523 --> 00:04:21,823
H.R.!

60
00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:24,238
- Tracy.
- No.

61
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:29,597
- No. No.
- It's... it's okay.

62
00:04:30,012 --> 00:04:31,932
Why are you doing this?

63
00:04:31,957 --> 00:04:34,341
I couldn't be a coward.

64
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:39,246
I'm not a coward.

65
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:42,511
We just found each other.

66
00:04:42,513 --> 00:04:43,845
I know.

67
00:04:45,883 --> 00:04:47,382
Our story would be brilliant.

68
00:04:47,384 --> 00:04:50,018
You will be brilliant.

69
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,635
You will be glorious, Tracy Brand.

70
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,971
You will be.

71
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:57,175
I've seen... seen it with my own eyes.

72
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:00,293
I love you.

73
00:05:03,785 --> 00:05:05,622
Oh, B.A.?

74
00:05:05,647 --> 00:05:07,531
- B.A.
- I'm right here.

75
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:09,621
Will you tell Cisco...

76
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:11,818
please tell him...

77
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,168
Will you tell him that?

78
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:19,089
For me?

79
00:05:19,593 --> 00:05:22,347
- Yeah.
- Good.

80
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:24,101
Now...

81
00:05:24,883 --> 00:05:26,785
go stop Savitar.

82
00:05:35,355 --> 00:05:36,988
H.R.

83
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,502
H.R.

84
00:05:59,034 --> 00:06:01,519
Savitar took the Speed Force bazooka.

85
00:06:09,555 --> 00:06:11,224
Bye-bye, Vibe.

86
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:15,888
Keep him alive.

87
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:18,602
What? Why?

88
00:06:18,604 --> 00:06:21,888
Because I need him to
build something for us.

89
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:29,552
"Iris West-Allen."

90
00:06:29,577 --> 00:06:31,708
It changed back.

91
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:35,951
- Does that mean what I think it means?
- Yeah, Joe.

92
00:06:35,976 --> 00:06:37,745
The future's ours again.

93
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:51,513
Savitar?

94
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:56,506
- Something's wrong.
- What is it?

95
00:06:58,427 --> 00:07:00,343
She's... not dead.

96
00:07:02,014 --> 00:07:03,430
How is that possible?

97
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:05,200
H.R.

98
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,350
He took her place.

99
00:07:07,352 --> 00:07:08,852
H.R.

100
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:10,987
I thought you said H.R. lives.

101
00:07:10,989 --> 00:07:12,841
Not anymore!

102
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:15,692
If Iris doesn't die...

103
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,862
That means the future's changing.

104
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,958
So is yours.

105
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:27,347

106
00:07:30,323 --> 00:07:31,986
What?

107
00:07:33,193 --> 00:07:36,314
H.R.'s dead? I... I can't believe that.

108
00:07:36,963 --> 00:07:39,414
- Is Tracy all right?
- Not good.

109
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:41,616
She just wants to be alone.

110
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:43,284
There'll be time to mourn.

111
00:07:43,286 --> 00:07:44,836
Right now, we need to
figure out our next move.

112
00:07:44,838 --> 00:07:46,454
So for the millionth time,

113
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:48,485
I'm lost on all this time travel stuff.

114
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,792
What happens now? With Savitar?

115
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:53,678
Iris didn't die. So that
changes things, right?

116
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,457
I mean, since Iris didn't die,

117
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:57,535
future me never goes
down that same dark path.

118
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,785
I never create time
remnants to fight Savitar.

119
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,604
And if future you never
creates these time remnants,

120
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:06,357
then Savitar himself is never born.

121
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:08,309
Precisely. Once the time paradox

122
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:10,311
catches up with him, then...

123
00:08:10,313 --> 00:08:11,813
he'll be erased from existence.

124
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:13,448
But I saw him. He didn't disappear.

125
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,617
- Not yet.
- But he will, Joe.

126
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:18,119
Any guesses how long that's gonna take?

127
00:08:18,121 --> 00:08:19,821
Maybe a few hours?

128
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:22,040
He can do a lot of
damage in a few hours.

129
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:23,462
Well, guys, we can't just sit around

130
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:25,820
and wait for Savitar to disappear.

131
00:08:25,845 --> 00:08:28,571
But Savitar won't become
Savitar if he's erased.

132
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:30,118
Not unless he pulls off

133
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,204
whatever he's got in mind,
before the paradox hits him.

134
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:34,710
- He stole the bazooka for a reason.
- Yeah, why?

135
00:08:34,735 --> 00:08:35,970
I don't know, but remember,

136
00:08:35,972 --> 00:08:37,422
he's been planning this for centuries.

137
00:08:37,424 --> 00:08:38,723
He wants to be a god.

138
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:40,141
He must need the bazooka,

139
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:42,523
and Caitlin, to achieve his goals.

140
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:44,062
Anybody got any good news?

141
00:08:44,064 --> 00:08:46,314
Actually, uh, voilà.

142
00:08:46,316 --> 00:08:48,703
- What is that?
- This, Detective,

143
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,177
is the cure for Caitlin.

144
00:08:50,202 --> 00:08:51,986
You're kidding. You figured it out?

145
00:08:51,988 --> 00:08:54,436
Not by myself. With the help of...

146
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:55,803
Caitlin's mother.

147
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:57,469
This is experimental gene therapy.

148
00:08:57,494 --> 00:09:00,745
This? This will rewrite
Caitlin's meta-DNA.

149
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:02,614
This will bring back...

150
00:09:02,616 --> 00:09:04,449
Caitlin.

151
00:09:04,451 --> 00:09:05,766
I searched the forest.

152
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,118
Savitar and Caitlin were gone.

153
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,252
So was Cisco.

154
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:10,599
Savitar has 'em both.

155
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:16,787
Oh, you better have a plan B,

156
00:09:16,812 --> 00:09:20,438
'cause I don't think your
plan A worked out too well.

157
00:09:20,463 --> 00:09:22,262
Fix this.

158
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:26,054
Fix what? The Speed Force bazooka?

159
00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:28,056
Hey, I didn't name it.

160
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:30,441
If I didn't name it, I didn't make it.

161
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:32,234
And if I didn't make it,

162
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:34,729
I don't know how it works.

163
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:37,782
Oh, you know enough about
it to alter what it does.

164
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:40,735
Oh, I see. You want me to alter it.

165
00:09:40,737 --> 00:09:42,367
Well, what do you want
me to alter it into?

166
00:09:42,392 --> 00:09:44,647
Like, a hair dryer? Or a waffle maker?

167
00:09:44,672 --> 00:09:46,074
Oh, I know. Maybe something that's gonna

168
00:09:46,076 --> 00:09:49,077
fix that thin-crust
pizza you call a face.

169
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:51,829
An intradimensional quantum splicer.

170
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,332
A splicer.

171
00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:56,539
I do have a plan B.

172
00:09:56,564 --> 00:10:00,004
I open a time portal,
exposing the Speed Force,

173
00:10:00,006 --> 00:10:02,974
you shoot me with that,
and I become fragmented

174
00:10:02,976 --> 00:10:04,759
throughout all of time.

175
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:08,570
The past, present, future.

176
00:10:09,722 --> 00:10:12,711
After that, the paradox can't reach me.

177
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:15,800
You wanna splice
yourself throughout time?

178
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:18,667
Exist in every single
moment there ever was?

179
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:20,646
All of us aware and connected

180
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:23,221
through one consciousness.

181
00:10:23,246 --> 00:10:27,191
I'll be everywhere...
every hour, every minute.

182
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:28,949
And then,

183
00:10:28,974 --> 00:10:32,902
I will rule from the Big Bang
until the end of the world.

184
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:34,922
You wanted us to build this thing.

185
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:38,029
Well, why do you think
I let you idiots live?

186
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:43,108
Tracy Brand trapped me in
the Speed Force in the future.

187
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:46,613
All I had to do was get her
to build this a little earlier

188
00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:49,137
and have my best friend
make all the adjustments.

189
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:50,304
I'm not your friend.

190
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:51,763
Get...

191
00:10:51,788 --> 00:10:54,169
to work, Francesco.

192
00:10:56,146 --> 00:10:58,488
How about I sit on my ass

193
00:10:58,513 --> 00:11:01,620
and let you obliterate
permanently from existence?

194
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:03,310
How's that sound?

195
00:11:12,626 --> 00:11:14,076
That's your plan?

196
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:16,130
Do it or you'll Reverse-Flash me?

197
00:11:16,132 --> 00:11:17,499
Not you.

198
00:11:18,835 --> 00:11:20,585
Her.

199
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:26,924
You know what I'm remembering?

200
00:11:26,926 --> 00:11:29,977
Julian just got back to S.T.A.R Labs.

201
00:11:29,979 --> 00:11:31,602
He has the cure.

202
00:11:32,182 --> 00:11:34,065
He can turn her back.

203
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:37,487
You can have her back. You're so close.

204
00:11:38,321 --> 00:11:40,104
But not if she's dead.

205
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,108
So put that mechanical
genius to good work.

206
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,284
Make me what I need.

207
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,247
And I will let you both go.

208
00:12:04,714 --> 00:12:06,631
I hated Thawne...

209
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:08,349
and Zoom.

210
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:10,497
They took so much from me.

211
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,373
And I've hated Savitar

212
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,036
for threatening to take
you away from me too.

213
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:17,475
But he didn't.

214
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:19,060
I know.

215
00:12:21,564 --> 00:12:23,898
There is strength in anger.

216
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,145
I've used it before.

217
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:30,112
And so we sit here, with our anger,

218
00:12:30,137 --> 00:12:32,340
trying to think of a way to hurt Savitar

219
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:34,254
or maybe kill him.

220
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:38,045
And I just don't think that
hate's gonna get it done this time.

221
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:39,547
What do you mean?

222
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:42,416
Something that Snart said to me...

223
00:12:42,418 --> 00:12:45,586
that the Flash should
stay a hero, all the way,

224
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:48,575
and sometimes that it's not
about who can punch the hardest

225
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,614
or run the fastest.

226
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:55,646
So what are you gonna do?

227
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:57,964
The last thing he'd expect.

228
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:22,948
I wasn't sure you'd come.

229
00:13:24,323 --> 00:13:26,845
Must be an odd sensation,

230
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,629
getting new memories.

231
00:13:28,631 --> 00:13:31,415
You having an uncertain future.

232
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,235
What do you want? I'm busy.

233
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,056
Doing what?

234
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,472
Getting erased from existence?

235
00:13:38,474 --> 00:13:42,345
We will see which one of us gets erased.

236
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,813
Are you still planning
on becoming a god?

237
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:48,449
Cisco and Caitlin are still alive.

238
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:50,073
If that's what you're worried about.

239
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:53,154
Oh, I know. You need them, right?

240
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:55,156
To pull off your grand ascension.

241
00:13:55,158 --> 00:13:56,574
Look, Barry,

242
00:13:56,576 --> 00:13:59,410
if I wanted to talk to myself,

243
00:13:59,412 --> 00:14:02,747
I could have done that, back at my lair.

244
00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:06,247
What... do you want?

245
00:14:06,272 --> 00:14:07,880
I wanna help you.

246
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:10,338
- Really?
- You don't have much time...

247
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,694
before the paradox reaches you.

248
00:14:13,578 --> 00:14:15,294
Come back to S.T.A.R Labs.

249
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:17,011
Let Cisco and Caitlin go,

250
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:19,146
and let us figure out a way to save you.

251
00:14:19,148 --> 00:14:21,565
You really think I'd trust you?

252
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:23,234
You showed up.

253
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:24,685
So you remember me coming here.

254
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:25,835
Did I have any tricks up my sleeve?

255
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,483
Was I... was I planning
on blindsiding you?

256
00:14:29,508 --> 00:14:30,924
I don't know, Barry.

257
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:33,304
Maybe I get off on watching you grovel.

258
00:14:33,329 --> 00:14:36,174
No, I don't think that's it.
I think you're hearing me.

259
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:39,367
I'm still in there.

260
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:42,370
Deep down, buried beneath
the scars and the pain,

261
00:14:42,372 --> 00:14:46,235
that part of you that...
it must feel so lonely.

262
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,708
But it also knows what
it's like to have a family,

263
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:51,766
to have friends.

264
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:54,542
You can have all that back.

265
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:58,436
We can stop hurting each other.

266
00:15:01,391 --> 00:15:04,182
I remember when I was six, and, uh...

267
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:06,894
I begged Mom and Dad

268
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:09,697
to let me go to the
Science Expo in Midway.

269
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:13,870
And, uh, well, we got a flat
tire on that dirt road, no spare,

270
00:15:13,895 --> 00:15:17,905
so we were towed to that garage
in a tiny, one-street town.

271
00:15:17,907 --> 00:15:20,940
Of course, we were stuck there all day.

272
00:15:21,961 --> 00:15:24,161
Then we got ice cream

273
00:15:24,163 --> 00:15:25,963
and French fries with gravy

274
00:15:25,965 --> 00:15:28,149
at that little diner.

275
00:15:28,174 --> 00:15:30,423
And then that night, we watched

276
00:15:30,448 --> 00:15:33,421
the local fireworks show, and...

277
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:35,994
Actually, it turned
out to be a great day.

278
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:40,002
And it's my favorite
memory of Mom and Dad.

279
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:43,940
What was the name of that town?

280
00:15:46,352 --> 00:15:48,213
Masonville.

281
00:15:50,308 --> 00:15:52,191
I'm still in there.

282
00:15:54,227 --> 00:15:55,493
Come home.

283
00:16:20,406 --> 00:16:22,156
You make a move toward Iris...

284
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,765
He won't. Killing Iris...

285
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,207
won't save him now, not anymore.

286
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:29,793
Where is Cisco? Where's Caitlin?

287
00:16:29,795 --> 00:16:32,315
- They're safe.
- I was asking him.

288
00:16:41,023 --> 00:16:43,273
Show me that you can help me.

289
00:16:43,275 --> 00:16:46,501
Then I will tell you
where your friends are.

290
00:16:46,526 --> 00:16:48,688
You tell us now, or you go up in smoke.

291
00:16:48,713 --> 00:16:50,073
This is bloody insanity.

292
00:16:50,098 --> 00:16:51,378
- Can't believe this.
- What is he doing here?

293
00:16:51,403 --> 00:16:53,769
- He's a monster.
- Hey! Hey! Stop! Guys.

294
00:16:53,794 --> 00:16:54,985
It's okay.

295
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:57,776
Everyone, just...

296
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:03,470
Iris, stay away from him.

297
00:17:03,495 --> 00:17:05,378
Look at me.

298
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,001
It's okay. Look at me.

299
00:17:21,396 --> 00:17:23,365
We're gonna help you, okay?

300
00:17:36,445 --> 00:17:38,344
Thank you.

301
00:17:39,331 --> 00:17:41,781
Right. Well, since our guest here

302
00:17:41,783 --> 00:17:44,784
has both of our resident
scientists hostage,

303
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:48,038
what temporal problem
can we help you with?

304
00:17:49,016 --> 00:17:50,840
Tracy built the Speed Force trap.

305
00:17:50,842 --> 00:17:53,102
Maybe she has an idea.

306
00:17:54,126 --> 00:17:55,679
Tracy's our best bet.

307
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:57,094
Am I?

308
00:17:59,502 --> 00:18:02,961
So... you're Savitar.

309
00:18:03,628 --> 00:18:07,359
I hear you're about to
have a really bad day.

310
00:18:08,727 --> 00:18:09,809
Good.

311
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:11,227
Tracy...

312
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,531
He stole my future.

313
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:16,641
Why does he deserve one?

314
00:18:18,987 --> 00:18:20,984
I shouldn't have come here.

315
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:25,075
No. We'll get her to help us.

316
00:18:25,648 --> 00:18:27,108
I think I know someone who might be able

317
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:28,805
to get through to her.

318
00:18:38,006 --> 00:18:41,180
Uh... I'm not H.R.

319
00:18:41,843 --> 00:18:44,717
My name is Harrison Wells.

320
00:18:44,742 --> 00:18:47,319
I'm from a different Earth.

321
00:18:47,344 --> 00:18:49,933
In the multiverse...
how to explain this?

322
00:18:49,935 --> 00:18:52,983
You're... his doppelganger?

323
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,631
Yeah.

324
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:57,691
Something like that... look.

325
00:18:57,693 --> 00:18:59,289
These people...

326
00:19:00,028 --> 00:19:01,882
they're good people.

327
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,790
And they need your help.

328
00:19:05,664 --> 00:19:07,284
By helping the bad guy

329
00:19:07,286 --> 00:19:09,619
that I spent weeks trying to stop?

330
00:19:09,621 --> 00:19:12,422
No. I won't do it.

331
00:19:12,424 --> 00:19:14,635
The only reason I agreed
was because of H.R.

332
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,209
H.R. needs your help.

333
00:19:16,211 --> 00:19:18,168
H.R. is dead.

334
00:19:18,193 --> 00:19:20,941
That's why you need to stay.

335
00:19:20,966 --> 00:19:22,716
Because of what Savitar took from you,

336
00:19:22,718 --> 00:19:27,190
because of what Savitar
took from H.R... everything.

337
00:19:27,215 --> 00:19:29,389
H.R. paid the price that he did

338
00:19:29,391 --> 00:19:31,500
because he loved these people.

339
00:19:32,477 --> 00:19:34,639
Because he loved you.

340
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:37,579
And when the moment came,

341
00:19:37,604 --> 00:19:39,342
H.R. didn't run.

342
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:52,360
Strange being back here.

343
00:19:52,385 --> 00:19:55,117
You remember S.T.A.R Labs?

344
00:19:56,168 --> 00:19:58,477
I remember everything.

345
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,639
This is where we came up
with the cerebral inhibitor

346
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,726
to use against DeVoe.

347
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,211
Who?

348
00:20:15,327 --> 00:20:17,477
You haven't gotten there yet.

349
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:24,249
So how's this gonna
work? Where will I live?

350
00:20:24,274 --> 00:20:25,882
What do you mean?

351
00:20:25,907 --> 00:20:28,139
Are Wally and I gonna be bunk-mates?

352
00:20:28,164 --> 00:20:30,784
Am I supposed to just rejoin Team Flash,

353
00:20:30,786 --> 00:20:32,452
fight some Rogues?

354
00:20:32,454 --> 00:20:35,624
What kind of life were
you thinking I'd lead?

355
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:38,194
I hadn't gotten that far yet.

356
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:41,428
How do we explain me at the wedding?

357
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,803
And do I sit bride-side or groom-side?

358
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:49,335
Ah, look, I mean, we
don't have all the answers.

359
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,389
You know, we're gonna figure it out.

360
00:20:51,414 --> 00:20:53,139
Together.

361
00:20:57,705 --> 00:20:59,438
No.

362
00:21:00,474 --> 00:21:02,289
Not together.

363
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:07,695
Love and hate, they're so close.

364
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,539
It's easy to mistake one for the other.

365
00:21:12,661 --> 00:21:15,662
You're gonna spend the
rest of your life with him.

366
00:21:16,297 --> 00:21:20,250
But I remember giving you the ring.

367
00:21:20,252 --> 00:21:22,585
Singing to you.

368
00:21:22,587 --> 00:21:25,054
Asking you to marry me.

369
00:21:30,104 --> 00:21:31,702
I can't do this.

370
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:34,172
No, yes, you can. Okay?

371
00:21:34,797 --> 00:21:37,102
I will be here for you.

372
00:21:38,937 --> 00:21:41,110
I tried to kill you.

373
00:21:42,741 --> 00:21:44,446
I killed H.R.

374
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:47,225
And you are going to
have to live with that.

375
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:48,722
But we won't give up on you, okay?

376
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:50,594
That is not what we do.

377
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:54,175
There is a way through
this for all of us.

378
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:58,788
Where are Cisco and Caitlin?

379
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:10,024
I'll bring them home.

380
00:22:22,697 --> 00:22:24,447
What is it?

381
00:22:24,449 --> 00:22:27,649
There's energy radiating
from the breach room.

382
00:22:28,737 --> 00:22:30,257
And it's not breach energy.

383
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,621
It's the philosopher's stone.

384
00:22:31,662 --> 00:22:33,649
It's releasing all its energy.

385
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:36,052
Savitar.

386
00:22:36,077 --> 00:22:37,511
It looks like it's gonna blow.

387
00:22:38,713 --> 00:22:40,704
Wally. Get everybody out.

388
00:23:11,276 --> 00:23:12,721
Is it finished?

389
00:23:13,454 --> 00:23:16,000
Yeah. It's finished.

390
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:17,931
Fantastic.

391
00:23:17,933 --> 00:23:20,500
You know Savitar's gonna
turn on you one day.

392
00:23:20,502 --> 00:23:22,102
No, he won't.

393
00:23:22,104 --> 00:23:23,436
A bad guy like Savitar

394
00:23:23,438 --> 00:23:25,334
always turns on his partners.

395
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,673
Not this time.

396
00:23:26,675 --> 00:23:28,281
Wake up!

397
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:31,279
You're only saying that because
he needs something from you.

398
00:23:31,304 --> 00:23:34,681
Once he's done with
that, it's over for you.

399
00:23:36,257 --> 00:23:38,617
- How'd it go?
- As I expected.

400
00:23:39,187 --> 00:23:41,936
I was a fool to think otherwise.

401
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:44,061
Where did he go? What did you do?

402
00:23:44,086 --> 00:23:46,336
I got rid of a problem.

403
00:23:46,361 --> 00:23:47,984
A few of 'em.

404
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:51,023
Now I can fix mine.

405
00:23:52,078 --> 00:23:54,789
- Are we ready?
- Yes.

406
00:23:56,471 --> 00:23:58,132
Do it.

407
00:23:59,374 --> 00:24:00,707
Caitlin...

408
00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:01,953
Listen to me.

409
00:24:01,978 --> 00:24:03,873
He'll do it.

410
00:24:03,898 --> 00:24:05,264
He'll kill you.

411
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:06,813
I'll take my chances.

412
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:12,241
Gypsy! No, wait. No!

413
00:24:14,804 --> 00:24:16,468
You don't care that they got away?

414
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,601
No, it doesn't matter.

415
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:19,984
It's time.

416
00:24:23,345 --> 00:24:24,510
Ow!

417
00:24:24,512 --> 00:24:26,578
I had that. I was
getting through to her.

418
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,828
You were almost killed.

419
00:24:27,853 --> 00:24:29,725
Maybe that's how it looks
to the untrained eye.

420
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,283
These eyes are highly trained.

421
00:24:31,285 --> 00:24:32,544
And I know you were in danger because

422
00:24:32,569 --> 00:24:34,630
I vibed it across the multiverse.

423
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:37,131
I can't believe this is the
thanks I get for saving you!

424
00:24:37,156 --> 00:24:40,492
This isn't thanks! This
is the opposite of thanks!

425
00:24:40,494 --> 00:24:42,261
Wait a minute.

426
00:24:42,263 --> 00:24:44,229
How did you vibe that I was in trouble?

427
00:24:44,231 --> 00:24:46,232
Because we are connected.

428
00:24:47,501 --> 00:24:49,034
Jackass.

429
00:24:50,511 --> 00:24:52,209
Guys?

430
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,559
Oh, my God.

431
00:24:55,584 --> 00:24:57,381
I thought something
happened to you guys.

432
00:24:57,406 --> 00:24:59,011
Two-Face told me you guys were dead.

433
00:24:59,013 --> 00:25:00,846
We're okay. Gypsy...

434
00:25:00,848 --> 00:25:02,514
- Gypsy.
- Guys.

435
00:25:02,516 --> 00:25:03,649
Gypsy.

436
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:05,617
- Harry.
- Here to help.

437
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:07,021
Good.

438
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,555
I know what he's up to.

439
00:25:09,557 --> 00:25:11,912
We have to hurry.

440
00:25:11,937 --> 00:25:13,373
I must become immortal

441
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:15,972
before the paradox reaches me.

442
00:25:17,231 --> 00:25:19,835
Today, I become a god.

443
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:32,578
This is why I brought you here.

444
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,913
The Speed Force doesn't like it

445
00:25:34,915 --> 00:25:37,187
when speedsters mess with time.

446
00:25:37,212 --> 00:25:38,511
Get ready.

447
00:25:53,453 --> 00:25:54,976
See ya later, Hunter.

448
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:59,504
The one thing Black
Flash can't fight... cold.

449
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:04,359
Finally! To be a god!

450
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,453
What?

451
00:26:26,477 --> 00:26:28,344
No!

452
00:26:33,327 --> 00:26:36,034
I've been waiting a
long time to do that.

453
00:26:36,036 --> 00:26:37,280
Garrick!

454
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:39,437
- How did you...
- He didn't.

455
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:41,163
I did.

456
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:44,109
By changing the polarity
of the climbing arc,

457
00:26:44,111 --> 00:26:46,010
I changed your Speed Force splicer

458
00:26:46,012 --> 00:26:47,966
into a Speed Force skeleton key.

459
00:26:47,991 --> 00:26:49,447
Didn't think I was
actually gonna let you

460
00:26:49,449 --> 00:26:51,686
become a god, now, did you?

461
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,586
Let's end this.

462
00:26:54,588 --> 00:26:55,788
Go!

463
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,316
Go ahead, Cisco. Go bad.

464
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,506
No. I never will.

465
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:48,997
But I will give you a choice.

466
00:27:50,343 --> 00:27:52,444
You wanna be Caitlin again?

467
00:27:52,446 --> 00:27:53,989
Here's your chance.

468
00:27:58,418 --> 00:27:59,960
Look out!

469
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,694
You'll pay for what you did!

470
00:28:07,366 --> 00:28:10,812
And you can die the same way twice.

471
00:28:23,098 --> 00:28:25,605
I knew you didn't have
it in you, Caitlin.

472
00:28:30,971 --> 00:28:33,463
I only have a few minutes left.

473
00:28:33,488 --> 00:28:35,007
I can feel it.

474
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:36,541
But before I go,

475
00:28:36,543 --> 00:28:38,477
I'm gonna kill Joe.

476
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:39,778
And Wally.

477
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,542
And Iris.

478
00:28:41,567 --> 00:28:43,616
If I am going to die,

479
00:28:43,617 --> 00:28:48,003
then everything you
love is going to die too.

480
00:28:49,256 --> 00:28:51,223
No!

481
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:01,050
How's it feel...

482
00:29:01,075 --> 00:29:03,569
to get so close to your ascension,

483
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,437
and end up on the ground?

484
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:06,668
Now I see.

485
00:29:07,786 --> 00:29:10,409
- It's written.
- Nothing's written!

486
00:29:25,667 --> 00:29:26,988
Do it!

487
00:29:28,285 --> 00:29:30,562
You kill me, you become me.

488
00:29:30,564 --> 00:29:33,988
Either way, I live.

489
00:29:51,085 --> 00:29:52,751
I'll never let the pain,

490
00:29:52,753 --> 00:29:55,620
the darkness, determine who I am.

491
00:29:55,622 --> 00:29:57,589
I will never be you.

492
00:30:48,754 --> 00:30:51,655
All these months, you were
trying to save me from him.

493
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,814
Look at that. I saved you.

494
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,380
_

495
00:31:10,405 --> 00:31:12,497
_

496
00:31:17,255 --> 00:31:19,055
When I think of H.R.,

497
00:31:19,057 --> 00:31:21,457
I'm reminded of...

498
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:24,327
a story that John Lennon once told.

499
00:31:24,329 --> 00:31:28,782
When Lennon was five years
old, his teacher asked him to...

500
00:31:28,807 --> 00:31:31,667
write down what he wanted
to be when he grew up.

501
00:31:32,904 --> 00:31:34,916
Lennon wrote, "Happy."

502
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:38,938
His teacher said that he didn't
understand the assignment, and...

503
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:42,044
Lennon said that they
didn't understand life.

504
00:31:43,547 --> 00:31:46,159
H.R. understood life.

505
00:31:46,184 --> 00:31:49,352
He wasn't a genius, and
he didn't have super speed.

506
00:31:49,377 --> 00:31:53,589
But when we needed him
the most, he was our hero.

507
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:55,858
He was my hero.

508
00:31:59,964 --> 00:32:01,796
Mine too.

509
00:32:13,311 --> 00:32:14,810
Good on you, mate.

510
00:32:14,812 --> 00:32:17,891
Thanks for believing in me, H.R.

511
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:21,163
Hey, I've been looking for
the right time to tell you.

512
00:32:21,686 --> 00:32:23,313
Tell me what?

513
00:32:24,103 --> 00:32:26,103
Right before H.R. died,

514
00:32:26,128 --> 00:32:27,788
he asked me to give you a message.

515
00:32:28,293 --> 00:32:29,921
Tell... tell Cisco...

516
00:32:29,946 --> 00:32:32,452
this took strength,
and he gave it to me.

517
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,905
I know that you've had a connection

518
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:38,444
with every Wells that we've met, but...

519
00:32:39,288 --> 00:32:41,765
I don't know. Something
about this Wells...

520
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,077
Yeah...

521
00:32:44,553 --> 00:32:46,223
Something.

522
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:57,067
I'll be right back.

523
00:33:04,803 --> 00:33:06,929
Well, well, well.

524
00:33:06,931 --> 00:33:09,498
At least you're not shopping
at Villains "R" Us anymore.

525
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,186
I'm sorry about H.R.

526
00:33:11,211 --> 00:33:13,169
I'm sure he would have
appreciated you coming.

527
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:14,637
Why did you come?

528
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:16,072
I don't know.

529
00:33:16,074 --> 00:33:17,740
Maybe you wanted to come home.

530
00:33:17,742 --> 00:33:19,041
I don't have a home.

531
00:33:19,043 --> 00:33:20,876
Yes, you do, Caitlin.

532
00:33:20,878 --> 00:33:22,645
You do. With your friends.

533
00:33:22,647 --> 00:33:24,395
With me.

534
00:33:27,318 --> 00:33:29,098
I'm sorry, Julian.

535
00:33:29,598 --> 00:33:31,554
I'm not Caitlin anymore.

536
00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:34,540
You're not Killer Frost.

537
00:33:34,565 --> 00:33:36,031
No, I'm not.

538
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:37,690
I'm something else.

539
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:40,529
And I need to figure out what that is.

540
00:33:40,531 --> 00:33:42,245
On my own.

541
00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:44,915
Hey.

542
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,800
Cisco.

543
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:48,714
Let me go.

544
00:34:09,697 --> 00:34:12,059
- Stop it.
- It's not funny.

545
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:13,529
- I know.
- Why are we laughing?

546
00:34:13,531 --> 00:34:17,366
We should not be laughing.
Today, of all days.

547
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:19,732
I think H.R. would have approved.

548
00:34:19,734 --> 00:34:21,263
Probably.

549
00:34:21,857 --> 00:34:24,701
Are you okay? I mean...

550
00:34:25,116 --> 00:34:27,013
with what you did.

551
00:34:28,115 --> 00:34:30,646
I'm sure one day, it'll hit me.

552
00:34:30,648 --> 00:34:31,947
In the future,

553
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:34,350
which... I have again.

554
00:34:34,352 --> 00:34:36,130
We have.

555
00:34:36,155 --> 00:34:38,443
Every day of it.

556
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:41,833
♪ Every hour, every minute ♪

557
00:34:44,495 --> 00:34:46,128
I think we have the song picked out

558
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,563
for the dance at our reception.

559
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:49,998
Oh, yeah, that reminds me.

560
00:34:50,694 --> 00:34:54,313
I can officially mail these.

561
00:34:54,338 --> 00:34:55,971
What are these?

562
00:34:55,973 --> 00:34:58,307
Save the date cards for our wedding.

563
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:00,943
On one of my braver
days, I filled them out.

564
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:03,107
I never mailed them,
not knowing if I would...

565
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:05,958
live to see the ceremony, but...

566
00:35:05,983 --> 00:35:07,435
but now I guess it's safe to...

567
00:35:11,689 --> 00:35:13,380
Delivered.

568
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:16,225
I wasted a lot of money on stamps,

569
00:35:16,227 --> 00:35:17,779
thank you very much.

570
00:35:19,645 --> 00:35:21,144
Are you...

571
00:35:21,169 --> 00:35:23,265
ready to be Iris West-Allen?

572
00:35:25,712 --> 00:35:28,310
I've always been Iris West-Allen.

573
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,473
I've always been yours.

574
00:35:32,501 --> 00:35:34,134
What was that?

575
00:35:41,585 --> 00:35:43,148
Oh, my...

576
00:35:47,608 --> 00:35:49,941
There's never been an
earthquake in Central City.

577
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,546
That wasn't an earthquake.

578
00:36:02,459 --> 00:36:03,955
You found something?

579
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,913
Everything's barbecued.

580
00:36:05,938 --> 00:36:08,498
I'm gonna try to establish
an up-link to the satellite.

581
00:36:08,523 --> 00:36:10,507
That's not good.

582
00:36:11,124 --> 00:36:12,890
Hey, Wally, can you reverse the polarity

583
00:36:12,915 --> 00:36:15,082
- on the neutron flow?
- On it.

584
00:36:15,107 --> 00:36:17,194
Central City University
just reported an earthquake

585
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:19,619
of 6.6 on the Richter scale.

586
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,843
- That's not an earthquake.
- Then what was it?

587
00:36:21,868 --> 00:36:23,194
Earthquakes come from down below.

588
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:25,561
This... this is something else.

589
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,663
It's gettin' bad out there.

590
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:37,554
Emergency services will
soon be overwhelmed.

591
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:39,944
Guys. 7.2, that last one.

592
00:36:39,969 --> 00:36:41,155
- Cisco.
- Yeah?

593
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,835
We're on! Guys.

594
00:36:44,782 --> 00:36:46,348
What is that thing?

595
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:49,515
- That's definitely not a breach.
- Holy plutonium.

596
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,454
What even emits that many kilojoules?

597
00:36:54,293 --> 00:36:55,892
The Speed Force.

598
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:57,150
But Savitar's dead.

599
00:36:57,175 --> 00:36:58,627
That's the problem.

600
00:36:58,629 --> 00:37:00,265
It's the Speed Force prison.

601
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,964
It needs an occupant.

602
00:37:01,966 --> 00:37:03,530
When you freed me, we emptied it.

603
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,834
- Without a prisoner...
- It goes unstable.

604
00:37:05,836 --> 00:37:08,203
And now it's bleeding
energy onto our Earth.

605
00:37:08,205 --> 00:37:10,039
Okay, so how do we stop this?

606
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:12,141
By giving it what it needs.

607
00:37:14,093 --> 00:37:15,769
Which is what?

608
00:37:24,318 --> 00:37:26,801
The Speed Force is unbalanced.

609
00:37:28,933 --> 00:37:30,866
I have to stabilize it.

610
00:37:30,891 --> 00:37:33,136
- What? How?
- By running into it.

611
00:37:33,161 --> 00:37:35,614
No, you can't. Barry, you'll
be trapped in there forever.

612
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:37,518
If I don't go, the whole city,

613
00:37:37,543 --> 00:37:39,699
maybe even the entire
planet, could be destroyed.

614
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:40,847
Cisco.

615
00:37:40,872 --> 00:37:42,982
There's gotta be another way, right?

616
00:37:43,007 --> 00:37:45,433
Barry, Central City needs The Flash.

617
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:47,009
And they'll have one.

618
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:48,683
They'll have one.

619
00:37:48,715 --> 00:37:50,215
Right?

620
00:37:51,504 --> 00:37:52,988
Right?

621
00:37:53,013 --> 00:37:54,394
Yeah.

622
00:37:58,556 --> 00:37:59,855
Mate...

623
00:38:06,021 --> 00:38:07,596
Do you mind sticking around?

624
00:38:07,598 --> 00:38:10,058
- Anything for you.
- Barry.

625
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:12,517
Wally and Jay said they were in hell.

626
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:23,312
Barry, it's your mother.

627
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,824
That's the Speed Force.

628
00:38:28,856 --> 00:38:30,830
Barry isn't going to hell.

629
00:38:30,855 --> 00:38:32,402
But like all runners must eventually,

630
00:38:32,427 --> 00:38:34,715
he's reached his finish line.

631
00:38:35,652 --> 00:38:37,192
His race is over.

632
00:38:37,194 --> 00:38:38,918
You can't take him with you.

633
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:41,074
She's not taking me anywhere.

634
00:38:41,785 --> 00:38:43,098
I have to go.

635
00:38:43,123 --> 00:38:44,965
Why? Why are you being punished?

636
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,847
This, all of this, it
started with my mistake,

637
00:38:48,872 --> 00:38:50,171
with Flashpoint.

638
00:38:50,196 --> 00:38:52,855
This is... this is my penance.

639
00:38:53,535 --> 00:38:55,754
This is my redemption.

640
00:38:56,582 --> 00:38:58,380
My beautiful boy.

641
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:02,028
It's time to rest.

642
00:39:10,997 --> 00:39:13,729
- Don't mess it up with her.
- I'll do my best.

643
00:39:13,731 --> 00:39:15,364
They're all gonna look to you now.

644
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:17,566
I'm not a hero like you.

645
00:39:17,568 --> 00:39:19,886
You've always been my hero.

646
00:39:28,636 --> 00:39:30,842
All this time we were
trying to save Iris,

647
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:32,559
you're telling me that...

648
00:39:32,584 --> 00:39:34,926
we should've been
trying to save you too?

649
00:39:36,347 --> 00:39:38,387
You did save me, Joe.

650
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:41,317
You took an 11-year-old
boy with a broken heart,

651
00:39:41,342 --> 00:39:42,858
and you gave him a home

652
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,560
and so much love.

653
00:39:44,562 --> 00:39:47,597
No son ever felt more
love from a father.

654
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:51,033
No father ever felt more proud of a son.

655
00:39:54,772 --> 00:39:56,324
Barry.

656
00:39:57,074 --> 00:39:58,433
It's time.

657
00:40:01,367 --> 00:40:03,074
Barry.

658
00:40:03,706 --> 00:40:05,355
This isn't fair.

659
00:40:05,764 --> 00:40:06,908
I know.

660
00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:09,451
We were supposed to
have our happy ending.

661
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:11,668
I'm ready to be Iris West-Allen.

662
00:40:11,693 --> 00:40:13,511
And you always will be.

663
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,801
But you need to keep living your life.

664
00:40:16,826 --> 00:40:18,835
Keep growing.

665
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,358
