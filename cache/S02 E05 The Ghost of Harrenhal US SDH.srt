- YOU SWEAR IT?
- BY THE MOTHER.

4
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,052
MY SON HAS NO INTEREST
IN THE IRON THRONE.

5
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,853
THEN I SEE NO REASON
FOR HOSTILITY BETWEEN US.

6
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,397
YOUR SON CAN GO ON CALLING
HIMSELF KING IN THE NORTH,

7
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,067
THE STARKS WILL HAVE
DOMINION OVER ALL LANDS
NORTH OF MOAT CAILIN,

8
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,236
PROVIDED HE SWEARS ME
AN OATH OF FEALTY.

9
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,737
AND THE WORDING
OF THIS OATH?

10
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,365
THE SAME NED STARK SWORE
TO ROBERT 18 YEARS AGO.

11
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,329
CAT, THEIR FRIENDSHIP HELD
THE KINGDOMS TOGETHER.

12
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,628
AND IN RETURN
FOR MY SON'S LOYALTY?

13
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,965
IN THE MORNING I'LL DESTROY
MY BROTHER'S ARMY.

14
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,258
WHEN THAT'S DONE,

15
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,844
BARATHEON AND STARK
WILL FIGHT

16
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,637
THEIR COMMON ENEMY
TOGETHER,

17
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,098
AS THEY HAVE DONE
MANY TIMES BEFORE.

18
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,608
OUR TWO HOUSES
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CLOSE,

19
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:15,278
WHICH IS WHY I AM BEGGING YOU
TO RECONSIDER THIS BATTLE.

20
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,071
NEGOTIATE A PEACE
WITH YOUR BROTHER.

21
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,824
NEGOTIATE WITH STANNIS?
( chuckles )

22
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,451
YOU HEARD HIM OUT THERE.

23
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,495
I'D HAVE BETTER LUCK
DEBATING THE WIND.

24
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,459
PLEASE BRING MY TERMS
TO YOUR SON.

25
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,628
I BELIEVE WE ARE
NATURAL ALLIES.

26
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,421
I HOPE HE FEELS
THE SAME.

27
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,174

41

I WON'T LEAVE HIM.

44

- MY LORD, MY LADY.

48
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,476
GET OUT.

49
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,644
STANNIS WILL BE HERE
IN AN HOUR.

50
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,397
WHEN HE ARRIVES, RENLY'S
BANNERMEN WILL FLOCK TO HIM.

<i>YOUR FORMER COMPANIONS</i>

OF SELLING YOU
TO THEIR NEW KING.

53
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,071
AND YOU WANT THAT
PRIVILEGE FOR YOURSELF.

54
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,616
YOU WILL NOTE THAT I AM
STANDING HERE TALKING TO YOU,

55
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,701
- NOT STANNIS.
- THERE'S NO TIME FOR THIS.

56
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,286
RIDE BACK TO
HIGHGARDEN, SISTER.

57
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,455
I'M NOT RUNNING
FROM STANNIS.

FROM OUR KING'S DEATH?

61
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,299
STANNIS.

62
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,343
I WILL PUT A SWORD
THROUGH HIS RIGHTEOUS FACE.

63
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,637
YOU CAN'T STAY HERE.

64
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,348
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
A TRUE KING,

65
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,642

REVENGE.

69
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,567
I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND
THAT TO BE THE PUREST
OF MOTIVATIONS,

70
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:45,279
BUT YOU WON'T HAVE
A CHANCE TO PUT YOUR
SWORD THROUGH STANNIS,

71

<i>NOT TODAY.</i>

72
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,991
<i>YOU'LL BE CUT TO PIECES</i>
<i>BEFORE HE SETS FOOT</i>
<i>ON SOLID GROUND.</i>

IF IT IS JUSTICE
THAT YOU WANT,

74
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,870
BE SMART ABOUT IT.

75
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,289
YOU CAN'T AVENGE HIM
FROM THE GRAVE.

76
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,876
BRING THE HORSES.

77
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,214
PLEASE.

78
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,286
HE WAS VERY HANDSOME.

79
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,746
HE WAS, YOUR GRACE.

80
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,832
"YOUR GRACE."

81
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,544
CALLING YOURSELF KING
DOESN'T MAKE YOU ONE.

82
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,006
AND IF RENLY WASN'T A KING,
I WASN'T A QUEEN.

83

00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,720
NO.

<i>ACCOUNTS DIFFER.</i>

CATELYN STARK IN SOME WAY.

90
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,660
REALLY?
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT?

91
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,829
SOME SAY IT WAS ONE
OF HIS OWN KINGSGUARD,

92
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,665
WHILE STILL OTHERS SAY
IT WAS STANNIS HIMSELF
WHO DID IT

93
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,626
AFTER NEGOTIATIONS
WENT SOUR.

94

WHOMEVER DID IT,
I SAY WELL DONE.

95
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,546
IT'S NOT WHAT VARYS SAYS.

<i>HE SAYS RENLY'S ARMY IS</i>
<i>FLOCKING TO SUPPORT STANNIS,</i>

97
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:32,053
WHICH WOULD GIVE
STANNIS SUPERIORITY OVER
US ON BOTH LAND AND SEA.

98
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,430
LITTLEFINGER SAYS WE CAN
OUTSPEND HIM THREE TO ONE.

99
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,350

YOU TO HAVE TOO MUCH
RESPECT FOR MONEY.

<i>STANNIS BARATHEON</i>

AREN'T THERE OTHER THINGS
YOU SHOULD BE DOING,

103
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,274
LIKE SEALING MY DAUGHTER
IN A CRATE SO YOU CAN
SHIP HER AWAY?

104
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,902
- SHE'LL BE SAFER IN DORNE.
- YES, I KNOW HOW CONCERNED
YOU ARE FOR HER SAFETY.

AREN'T YOU
ALWAYS SO CLEVER

WITH YOUR SCHEMES
AND YOUR PLOTS?

111
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,584
SCHEMES AND PLOTS
ARE THE SAME THING.

112
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,670
THEY ARE GOING
TO ATTACK US.

113
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,129
WE NEED TO BE READY.

114
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,632
NO NEED TO CONCERN
YOURSELF OVER IT.

115
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,177
THE KING IS TAKING
PERSONAL CHARGE OF
SIEGE PREPARATIONS.

116
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,764
MAY I ASK SPECIFICALLY
WHAT THE KING HAS IN MIND?

117
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,183
YOU MAY SPECIFICALLY
OR YOU MAY ASK VAGUELY.

118
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,477
THE ANSWER WILL BE
THE SAME.

119
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:30,194
IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT WE TALK ABOUT THIS.

120
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,283
IT'S THE KING'S
ROYAL PREROGATIVE

121
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:39,328
TO WITHHOLD
SENSITIVE INFORMATION
FROM HIS COUNCILORS.

126
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,846
YOU WOULDN'T LIE TO ME,
WOULD YOU, COUSIN?

127
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,723
- NO.
- THAT'S A LIE RIGHT THERE.

128
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,850
IT IS NOT A LIE.
WHY WOULD I LIE?

129
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,185
TELL ME,

130
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,812
IF THE VILE ALLEGATIONS

131
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,523
AGAINST MY BROTHER
AND SISTER ARE TRUE,

132
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:09,817
DO YOU THINK IT WILL
MAKE JAIME MORE LIKELY

133
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,236
TO KILL YOU OR LESS LIKELY?

134
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,699
- WHEN I TELL HIM
YOU'RE FUCKING HER, I MEAN.
- I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

135
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,785
- THE SMART MONEY
WOULD BE ON MORE LIKELY.
- SHE'S MAKING WILDFIRE.

136
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,496
BUT THEN PERHAPS HIS OWN
UNNATURAL URGES WILL GIVE
HIM SYMPATHY FOR YOURS.

137
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,914
THE ALCHEMISTS' GUILD
IS BEING COMMISSIONED.

138
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,708
I SUPPOSE THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

139
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,252
THEY HAVE THOUSANDS OF POTS
ALREADY STORED IN THEIR VAULTS.

140
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,546
THEY ARE PLANNING TO LAUNCH
THEM FROM THE CITY WALLS

141
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:32,214
INTO STANNIS'S SHIPS
AND ARMIES.

142
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,967
<i>PLEASE.</i>

143
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,721
WHEN DID SHE
TELL YOU THIS?

144
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,057
I HEARD HER TALKING
WITH THE PYROMANCER.

145
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,977
AND THE OTHER NIGHT
AFTER I LEFT HER,

146
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,229
SHE WENT TO MEET HIM.

147
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,149
- I SWEAR TO YOU.
- SWEAR TO ME ON WHAT?

148
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:53,027
- ON MY LIFE.
- BUT I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR LIFE.

149
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,029
IN THE LIGHT OF THE SEVEN,

150
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,073
BY ALL THAT IS
HOLY AND RIGHT,

151
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,575
I, LANCEL LANNISTER,

ENOUGH. EVEN TORTURING
YOU IS BORING.

153
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,998
<i>JUST GET OUT.</i>

154
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,753
OH, LANCEL,
TELL MY FRIEND BRONN

155
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,714
TO PLEASE KILL YOU
IF ANYTHING SHOULD
HAPPEN TO ME.

156
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,675
PLEASE KILL ME IF ANYTHING
SHOULD HAPPEN TO LORD TYRION.

157
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,055
IT WILL BE MY PLEASURE.

158
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,101
( horse whinnies )

159
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,728
- YOUR GRACE.
- WHAT IS IT?

160
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,398
- YOUR GRACE.
- I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR BROTHER, YOUR GRACE.

161
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,484
- I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT PEOPLE GRIEVE FOR HIM.
- YOUR GRACE.

162
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,486
- FOOLS LOVE A FOOL.
- YOUR GRACE.

163
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,155
I GRIEVE FOR HIM AS WELL--
FOR THE BOY HE WAS,

164
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,657
NOT THE MAN
HE GREW TO BE.

165
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,951
I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT
WHAT I SAW IN THAT CAVE.

166
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,079
I THOUGHT I MADE IT CLEAR
TO YOU THERE'D BE NO NEED TO
SPEAK TO ME ON THIS MATTER.

167
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:49,625
- YOUR GRACE, I--
- I'VE NEVER KNOWN YOU TO
NEED TO HEAR A THING TWICE.

168
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,419
AND I'VE NEVER KNOWN YOU
TO HIDE FROM THE TRUTH.

169
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,087
YOU'VE COME TO LECTURE
ME ON TRUTH?

170
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,755
I'VE COME TO TELL YOU
THAT WHAT I SAW--

171
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,924
ALL MY BROTHER'S BANNERMEN
HAVE COME TO MY SIDE.

172
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,388
EXCEPT THE TYRELLS,
WHO FLED LIKE COWARDS.

173
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,140
THEY WON'T BE ABLE
TO RESIST US NOW.

174
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,058
SOON I SHALL BE SITTING
ON THE IRON THRONE.

175
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,810
NOTHING IS WORTH
WHAT THIS WILL COST YOU,

176
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,479
- NOT EVEN THE IRON--
- I'LL HEAR NO MORE ABOUT IT.

177
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,614
Man:
<i>TAKE A COMPANY OF MEN,</i>
<i>SECURE THE PERIMETER.</i>

178
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,701
WHEN DO WE SAIL
FOR KING'S LANDING?

179
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,953
AS SOON AS I'VE
CONSOLIDATED MY TROOPS.

180
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,872
WE'LL MAKE SHORT WORK
OF THE LANNISTERS' FLEET.

181
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:30,082
ONCE BLACKWATER BAY
IS CLEARED,

182
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,919
WE'LL DELIVER OUR
TROOPS TO THEIR DOORSTEP
AND TAKE THE CITY.

183
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,088
AND WILL YOU BRING
LADY MELISANDRE WITH YOU?

184
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,842
THAT'S NOT YOUR CONCERN.

185
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,345
IF YOU TAKE KING'S LANDING
WITH HER BY YOUR SIDE,
THE VICTORY WILL BE HERS.

186
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,681
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE
REASON TO DOUBT YOUR LOYALTY.
WAS I WRONG?

187
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,726
LOYAL SERVICE MEANS
TELLING HARD TRUTHS.

188
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,103
OH, TRUTH AGAIN.

189
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,106
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S THE TRUTH?

190
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,025
THE HARD TRUTH?

191
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,194
<i>SHE'S A FOREIGNER</i>

192
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,196
PREACHING HER
FOREIGN RELIGION.

193
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,742
SOME BELIEVE
SHE WHISPERS ORDERS
IN YOUR EAR AND YOU OBEY.

194
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,872
WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE?

195
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,253
YOU WON THOSE BANNERMEN
FROM RENLY.

196
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,547
DON'T LOSE THEM TO HER.

197
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,263
WE SET OUT FOR KING'S LANDING
WITHOUT LADY MELISANDRE.

198
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,602
AND YOU LEAD THE FLEET
INTO BLACKWATER BAY.

199
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,313
YOUR GRACE, I'M HONORED,
BUT MY TIME ON THE SEA

200
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,941
WAS SPENT EVADING SHIPS,
NOT ATTACKING THEM.

201
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,651
THE OTHER LORDS
WON'T BE HAPPY.

202
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:41,820
MOST OF THOSE LORDS SHOULD
CONSIDER THEMSELVES LUCKY

203
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,906
I DON'T HANG THEM
FOR TREASON.

204
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,453
HARD TRUTHS CUT
BOTH WAYS, SER DAVOS.

205
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,597
Girl:
<i>I'VE GOT IT!</i>
<i>I'VE GOT IT!</i>

206
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,642
Man:
<i>SO IT'S THAT ONE THERE</i>
<i>AT THE TOP, ON THE RIGHT.</i>

207
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,938
BUY MY FRUIT, MY LORD.
FRESH FRUIT.

208
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,773
STANNIS HAS MORE INFANTRY,

209
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,650
MORE SHIPS, MORE HORSES.

210
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,443
WHAT DO WE HAVE?

211
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,779
THERE'S THAT MIND OF YOURS
YOU KEEP GOING ON ABOUT.

212
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:27,366
WELL, I'VE NEVER
ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE
TO KILL PEOPLE WITH IT.

213
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,286
GOOD THING.
I'D BE OUT OF A JOB.

214
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,371
Bronn:
<i>WHAT ABOUT YOUR FATHER?</i>

215
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,916
HE HASN'T SENT
A RAVEN IN WEEKS.

216
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,668
HE'S VERY BUSY.

217
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:41,380
BEING REPEATEDLY
HUMILIATED BY ROBB STARK
IS TIME-CONSUMING.

218
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,632
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO HOLD
THE CITY AGAINST STANNIS,

219
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,467
NOT THE WAY JOFFREY'S
PLANNING ON HOLDING IT.

220
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,803
- Man: CORRUPTION, YES.
- ( crowd cheering )

221
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:52,641
WE ARE SWOLLEN,
BLOATED, FOUL.

222
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:56,103
BROTHER FORNICATES WITH SISTER
IN THE BED OF KINGS

223
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,981
AND WE'RE SURPRISED
WHEN THE FRUIT OF THEIR
INCEST IS ROTTEN?

224
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,190
( cheering )

225
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,402
YES, A ROTTEN KING.

226
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,821
IT'S HARD TO ARGUE
WITH HIS ASSESSMENT.

227
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:08,449
NOT AFTER WHAT HE DID
TO YOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

228
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,327
THE KING IS A LOST CAUSE.

229
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,537
IT'S THE REST OF US
I'M WORRIED ABOUT NOW.

230
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:17,458
A DANCING KING, PRANCING
DOWN HIS BLOODSTAINED HALLS

231
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:21,253
TO THE TUNE OF A TWISTED
DEMON MONKEY.

232
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,504
( laughing )

233
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,257
YOU HAVE TO ADMIRE
HIS IMAGINATION.

234
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,844
- HE'S TALKING ABOUT YOU.
- WHAT?

235
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,638
DEMON MONKEY?

236
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,848
PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE PULLING
THE KING'S STRINGS.

237
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:35,142
THEY BLAME YOU
FOR THE CITY'S ILLS.

238
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,020
BLAME ME?
I'M TRYING TO SAVE THEM.

239
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,898
YOU DON'T NEED
TO CONVINCE ME.

240
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,609
DEMON MONKEY.

241
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,778
<i>( seagulls screeching )</i>

242
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,719
<i>( men laughing )</i>

243
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,473
YEAH, COME ON.

244
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,058
YOU'RE THE CREW
OF THE SEA BITCH?

245
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,687
I'M YOUR COMMANDER.
WELCOME.

246
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,399
STOP.

247
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,651
STOP!

248
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,904
YOUR CAPTAIN COMMANDS
YOU TO STOP.

249
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:31,949
WHERE ARE WE
HEADING, CAPTAIN?

250
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,328
THE STONY SHORE
TO RAID THEIR VILLAGES.

251
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,997
<i>THERE'LL BE SPOILS</i>
<i>IN IT FOR YOU, AND WOMEN,</i>

252
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,374
IF YOU DO YOUR JOBS WELL.

253
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,752
AND WHO DECIDES IF WE'VE
DONE OUR JOBS WELL?

254
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,589
I DO.

255
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,633
YOUR CAPTAIN.

256
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,427
( laughing )

257
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,179
I HAVE BEEN REAVING
AND RAPING

258
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:58,183
SINCE BEFORE YOU LEFT
BALON'S BALLS, CAPTAIN.

259
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:02,521
DON'T RECKON I'VE GOT
MUCH USE FOR YOUR IDEAS
ON HOW TO DO IT.

260
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,816
DON'T RECKON I'VE GOT
MUCH USE FOR A CAPTAIN AT ALL.

261
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:10,070
I'M THINKING I CAN DO THE JOB
OF CAPTAIN REAL WELL MYSELF.

262
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,989
ALL I NEED IS A SHIP.

263
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:16,702
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
WHERE I COULD FIND MYSELF
A SHIP NOW, WOULD YOU?

264
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,291
YOU COULD DO THAT,

265
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,626
TAKE THE SHIP,
HEAD OUT ON YOUR OWN.

266
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,630
AND I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN,
DRAG YOU BACK HERE IN CHAINS,
AND HANG YOU FOR A TRAITOR.

267
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,216
- ( laughs )
- STOP. WE YIELD.

268
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,969
( men laughing )

269
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:37,514
CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR FIRST COMMAND.

270
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,350
THANK YOU.
KIND OF YOU
TO COME SEE ME OFF.

271
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,685
OH, I'M NOT HERE
FOR YOU.

272
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,897
I WAS JUST ON MY WAY
TO RED HARBOR.

273
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,692
I'VE GOT 30 SHIPS.
THERE'S NOWHERE TO PUT
THEM HERE.

274
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,820
- TOO NARROW.
- YOU'D BETTER GET OUT THERE.

275
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,031
WOULDN'T WANT THEM
TO SET SAIL WITHOUT YOU.

276
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,949
THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN.

277
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,995
MY CREW WOULD WAIT
ON DECK FOR A YEAR
IF I ASKED THEM TO.

278
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:02,623
THIS LOT, THOUGH...

279
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,794
ENJOY THE STONY SHORE.

280
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,713
( laughing )

281
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,425
COME ON,
I'LL TAKE YOU OUT.

282
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,135
WHO ARE YOU?

283
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,429
DAGMER, YOUR FIRST MATE.

284
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,682
WHY AREN'T YOU
WITH THE REST OF THEM?

285
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,728
OR DID THEY SEND YOU
TO ROW ME OUT AND DUMP ME
HALFWAY IN THE SEA?

286
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,438
THAT WOULD BE GOOD
FOR A LAUGH.

287
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,941
THEY'RE NOT GONNA RESPECT YOU
UNTIL YOU PROVE YOURSELF.

288
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:32,528
AND HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO PROVE MYSELF BY PILLAGING
PISS-POOR FISHING VILLAGES?

289
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,530
YOU'RE NOT.

290
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,782
AND YET THAT'S THE TASK
MY FATHER HAS GIVEN ME

291
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:40,285
TO PROVE THAT
I'M A TRUE IRON ISLANDER.

292
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,621
Dagmer:
<i>THEY'RE ALL IRON ISLANDERS.</i>

293
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:46,041
DO THEY DO AS THEY'RE TOLD
OR DO THEY DO AS THEY LIKE?

294
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:56,051
THE STONY SHORE'S NOT FAR
FROM TORRHEN'S SQUARE.

295
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:58,554
THE SEAT OF THE HOUSE
OF TALLHART--

296
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,640
A MORE IMPRESSIVE PRIZE
THAN A FEW FISHERMEN'S
DAUGHTERS.

297
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,520
- WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK
WE COULD TAKE IT?
- NO, WE COULD.

298
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,730
WE COULD NEVER HOLD IT
FOR MORE THAN A FEW DAYS.

299
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,066
AS SOON AS WINTERFELL
GOT WORD THAT WE'D TAKEN
TORRHEN'S SQUARE,

300
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:13,861
THE STARKS WOULD SEND
THEIR MEN TO TAKE IT BACK.

301
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,073
AND THEN--

302
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,831
TAKE ME TO MY SHIP.

303
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,462
THE STARKS HAVE
OVEREXTENDED THEIR LINES.

304
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,381
NOW THAT SUMMER'S OVER,
THEY'LL HAVE A HARD TIME

305
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,717
KEEPING THEIR MEN
AND HORSES FED.

306
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,760
THE STARKS UNDERSTAND WINTER
BETTER THAN WE EVER WILL.

307
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,512
THE COLD WON'T BEAT THEM.

308
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:45,017
OUR SPIES REPORT
GROWING DISCONTENT AMONG
THE NORTHERN LORDS.

309
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,897
THEY WANT TO RETURN HOME
AND GATHER THE HARVEST
BEFORE THE CROPS TURN.

310
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,774
AND I'M SURE IF THOSE
SAME SPIES SNUCK INTO
OUR OWN ENCAMPMENTS,

311
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,986
THEY WOULD REPORT
GROWING DISCONTENT
AMONGST THE SOUTHERN LORDS.

312
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,822
THIS IS WAR;
NO ONE'S CONTENT.

313
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,869
WE'VE UNDERESTIMATED
THE STARK BOY FOR TOO LONG.

314
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:07,414
HE HAS A GOOD MIND FOR WARFARE,
HIS MEN WORSHIP HIM.

315
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,583
AND AS LONG AS HE KEEPS
WINNING BATTLES,

316
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,503
THEY'LL KEEP BELIEVING
HE IS KING IN THE NORTH.

317
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,172
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR HIM TO FAIL.

318
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:17,633
HE IS NOT GOING TO FAIL,

319
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,802
NOT WITHOUT OUR HELP.

320
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,640
SO HOW DO WE STOP HIM?

321
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,642
General:
<i>WE'VE WORKED THROUGH</i>
<i>THE NIGHT, MY LORD.</i>

322
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,102
PERHAPS WE'D PROFIT
FROM SOME SLEEP.

323
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,146
AS I THINK
YOU WOULD, REGINALD.

324
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,648
AND BECAUSE
YOU'RE MY COUSIN,

325
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,276
I MIGHT EVEN LET YOU
WAKE FROM THAT SLEEP.

326
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,820
GO, I'M SURE YOUR WIFE
MUST MISS YOU.

327
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,447
MY WIFE'S IN LANNISPORT.

328
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,076
WELL, THEN YOU'D
BETTER START RIDING.

329
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,704
GO BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND
AND SEND HER YOUR HEAD.

330
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,082
IF YOUR NAME
WASN'T LANNISTER,

331
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,669
YOU'D BE SCRUBBING OUT POTS
IN THE COOK'S TENT. GO!

332
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,131
NOT WINE, WATER.

333
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,425
WE'LL BE HERE
FOR SOME TIME.

334
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,475
GIRL.

335
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,519
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

336
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,521
MAIDENPOOL, MY LORD.

337
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,816
AND WHO ARE THE LORDS
OF MAIDENPOOL?

338
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:19,736
- REMIND ME.
- HOUSE MOOTON, MY LORD.

339
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,738
AND WHAT IS THEIR SIGIL?

340
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,327
A RED SALMON.

341
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,330
I THINK A MAIDENPOOL GIRL
WOULD REMEMBER THAT.

342
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,002
YOU'RE A NORTHERNER,
AREN'T YOU?

343
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:38,130
GOOD. ONE MORE TIME,
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

344
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,091
BARROWTON, MY LORD.
HOUSE DUSTIN.

345
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:45,262
TWO CROSSED LONGAXES
BENEATH A BLACK CROWN.

346
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,726
AND WHAT DO THEY SAY
OF ROBB STARK IN THE NORTH?

347
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,064
THEY CALL HIM
THE YOUNG WOLF.

348
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,400
AND?

349
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,361
THEY SAY HE RIDES
INTO BATTLE ON THE BACK
OF A GIANT DIREWOLF.

350
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:07,242
THEY SAY HE CAN TURN INTO
A WOLF HIMSELF WHEN HE WANTS.

351
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,411
THEY SAY HE CAN'T BE KILLED.

352
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,330
AND DO YOU BELIEVE THEM?

353
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,251
NO, MY LORD.

354
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:18,628
ANYONE CAN BE KILLED.

355
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,180
FETCH THAT WATER.

356
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,098
A GIRL SAYS NOTHING.

357
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,061
A GIRL KEEPS
HER MOUTH CLOSED.

358
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,522
<i>NO ONE HEARS,</i>

359
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:22,651
AND FRIENDS MAY TALK
IN SECRET, YES?

360
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,240
A BOY BECOMES A GIRL.

361
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,033
I WAS ALWAYS A GIRL.

362
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,285
AND I WAS ALWAYS AWARE.

363
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,871
BUT THE GIRL
KEEPS SECRETS.

364
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,958
<i>IT IS NOT FOR A MAN</i>
<i>TO SPOIL THEM.</i>

365
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,753
YOU'RE ONE OF THEM NOW.

366
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,758
I SHOULD HAVE LET YOU BURN.

367
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,429
AND YOU FETCH WATER
FOR ONE OF THEM NOW.

368
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:55,392
WHY IS THIS RIGHT FOR YOU
AND WRONG FOR ME?

369
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,310
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

370
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:01,314
YOU DID.
I DID.

371
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,024
AND HERE WE ARE.

372
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,904
A MAN PAYS HIS DEBTS.

373
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,157
A MAN OWES THREE.

374
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,616
THREE WHAT?

375
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,037
THE RED GOD TAKES
WHAT IS HIS, LOVELY GIRL.

376
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:20,041
AND ONLY DEATH
MAY PAY FOR LIFE.

377
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,419
YOU SAVED ME
AND THE TWO I WAS WITH.

378
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,380
YOU STOLE THREE DEATHS
FROM THE RED GOD.

379
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,469
WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM BACK.

380
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,933
SPEAK THREE NAMES

381
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,686
AND THE MAN
WILL DO THE REST.

382
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,148
THREE LIVES
I WILL GIVE YOU--

383
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:46,484
NO MORE, NO LESS,
AND WE'RE DONE.

384
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:49,112
I CAN NAME ANYONE

385
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,364
AND YOU'LL KILL HIM?

386
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:55,076
A MAN HAS SAID.

387
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,622
THE ONE WHO
TORTURES EVERYONE.

388
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,290
A MAN NEEDS A NAME.

389
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,792
I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME.

390
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,920
THEY CALL HIM
THE TICKLER.

391
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,047
THAT IS ENOUGH.

392
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:11,218
GO NOW, GIRL.
YOUR MASTER IS THIRSTY.

393
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:25,941
Mormont:
<i>HE'S NOT HERE YET.</i>

394
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,318
HE'D HAVE SEEN US,
BLOWN THE HORN.

395
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,528
Jon:
WHEN WILL HE COME?

396
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,572
THE HALFHAND DOES THINGS
IN HIS OWN TIME.

397
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,033
MY UNCLE TOLD ME
STORIES ABOUT HIM.

398
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,952
MOST OF THEM ARE TRUE.

399
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,788
I HEARD THE HALFHAND
SPENT HALF OF LAST WINTER
BEYOND THE WALL.

400
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,456
THE WHOLE WINTER.

401
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:44,084
HE WAS NORTH
OF THE SKIRLING PASS
WHEN THE SNOWS CAME.

402
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,961
HAD TO WAIT FOR THE THAW.

403
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,631
SO IT IS POSSIBLE
FOR SOMEONE TO SURVIVE
OUT HERE ON THEIR OWN.

404
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:53,301
WELL, POSSIBLE
FOR THE HALFHAND.

405
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,053
BEAUTIFUL, ISN'T IT?

406
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,639
GILLY WOULD LOVE IT HERE.

407
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:01,309
THERE'S NOTHING MORE SICKENING
THAN A MAN IN LOVE.

408
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:11,319
<i>( men chatting )</i>

409
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,006
Man:
<i>ABOUT TIME YOU DID SOMETHING.</i>

410
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,717
<i>AT LEAST YOU'LL KEEP WARM.</i>

411
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,846
THE FIST
OF THE FIRST MEN.

412
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:41,433
THINK OF HOW OLD
THIS PLACE IS--

413
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,893
BEFORE THE TARGARYENS
DEFEATED THE ANDALS,

414
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,730
BEFORE THE ANDALS TOOK
WESTEROS FROM THE FIRST MEN.

415
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:50,025
BEFORE I DIE, PLEASE,
STOP TALKING.

416
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,319
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS
OF YEARS AGO,

417
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,280
THE FIRST MEN STOOD HERE
WHERE WE'RE STANDING

418
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,615
ALL THROUGH THE LONG NIGHT.

419
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,203
WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY
WERE LIKE, THE FIRST MEN?

420
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,747
STUPID.

421
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:07,125
SMART PEOPLE
DON'T FIND THEMSELVES
IN PLACES LIKE THIS.

422
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,879
I THINK
THEY WERE AFRAID.

423
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,673
I THINK THEY CAME HERE
TO GET AWAY FROM SOMETHING.

424
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:17,218
AND I DON'T THINK
IT WORKED.

425
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,554
<i>( horn sounding )</i>

426
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,016
WILDLINGS?

427
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,312
ONE BLAST IS FOR
RANGERS RETURNING.

428
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,105
WILDLINGS IS TWO BLASTS.

429
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,609
SO YOU GOT TO STAND
THERE WAITING,

430
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,694
<i>WONDERING.</i>

431
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,321
<i>ONE BLAST FOR FRIENDS,</i>

432
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,366
<i>TWO FOR FOES.</i>

433
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,287
AND THREE
FOR WHITE WALKERS.

434
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,167
IT'S BEEN 1,000 YEARS,

435
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,920
BUT THAT'S THE ONLY TIME
THEY BLOW THE HORN THREE TIMES.

436
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,881
BUT IF IT'S BEEN 1,000 YEARS,
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

437
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:58,718
- WELL...
- All: I READ IT IN A BOOK.

438
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,970
LOOK.

439
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,265
IT'S QHORIN HALFHAND.

440
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:07,394
AYE, WE'LL LIVE
ANOTHER DAY.

441
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,230
HURRAH.

442
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,908
TAKE CARE, MY LORD.

443
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:24,953
I REMEMBER READING
AN OLD SAILOR'S PROVERB--

444
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,914
"PISS ON WILDFIRE
AND YOUR COCK BURNS OFF."

445
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:31,626
OH, I HAVE NOT CONDUCTED
THIS EXPERIMENT.

446
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:34,295
IT COULD WELL BE TRUE.

447
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,131
THE SUBSTANCE
BURNS SO HOT,

448
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,426
IT MELTS WOOD,
STONE, EVEN STEEL,

449
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:42,720
AND, OF COURSE, FLESH.

450
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:47,183
THE SUBSTANCE BURNS SO HOT,
IT MELTS FLESH LIKE TALLOW.

451
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,314
AFTER THE DRAGONS DIED,
WILDFIRE WAS THE KEY

452
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,191
TO THE TARGARYEN POWER.

453
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,069
- ( Bronn scoffs )
- MY COMPANION TAKES ISSUE.

454
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,530
IF I COULD TELL YOU
HOW MANY CRAZY OLD MEN

455
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,782
I'VE SEEN PUSHING CARTS
AROUND ARMY CAMPS

456
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:06,661
MAKING GRAND CLAIMS ABOUT
JARS FULL OF PIG SHIT...

457
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:09,831
- NO OFFENSE MEANT.
- OUR ORDER DOES NOT
DEAL IN PIG SHIT.

458
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,459
THE SUBSTANCE
IS FIRE GIVEN FORM.

459
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:16,171
AND WE HAVE BEEN PERFECTING IT
SINCE THE DAYS OF MAEGOR.

460
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,714
TO DO WHAT?

461
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,842
THE JARS ARE PUT IN CATAPULTS
AND FLUNG AT THE ENEMY.

462
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,636
HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE?

463
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:31,144
IF YOU COULD GET
REAL SOLDIERS TO MAN
THE CATAPULTS,

464
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:34,522
THEN MAYBE YOU'D HIT
YOUR TARGET ONE TIME IN 10,

465
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,692
BUT ALL THE REAL SOLDIERS
ARE IN THE RIVERLANDS
WITH YOUR FATHER.

466
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:40,195
MY LORD, THIS MAN
IS INSULTING.

467
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,697
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE
EVER SEEN A BATTLE, OLD MAN,

468
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,240
BUT THINGS CAN GET
A BIT MESSY.

469
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,742
'CAUSE WHEN WE'RE FLINGING
THINGS AT STANNIS,

470
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,494
HE'S FLINGING THEM
RIGHT BACK AT US.

471
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,371
MEN DIE, MEN SHIT
THEMSELVES, MEN RUN,

472
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,081
WHICH MEANS
POTS FALLING,

473
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,250
WHICH MEANS FIRE
INSIDE THE WALLS,

474
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:58,630
WHICH MEANS THE POOR CUNTS
TRYING TO DEFEND THE CITY
END UP BURNING IT DOWN.

475
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,840
MY FRIEND REMAINS
UNCONVINCED.

476
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,343
HE WOULD NOT DARE
INSULT MY ORDER

477
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,011
WHILST AERYS TARGARYEN
LIVED.

478
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,722
WELL, HE'S NOT
LIVING ANYMORE.

479
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:10,934
AND ALL HIS POTS OF WILDFIRE
DIDN'T HELP HIM, DID THEY?

480
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:14,938
MEN WIN WARS,
NOT MAGIC TRICKS.

481
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:34,415
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING
TIRELESSLY DAY AND NIGHT

482
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:38,920
EVER SINCE YOUR ROYAL SISTER
COMMANDED US TO DO SO.

483
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,130
OUR PRESENT COUNT STANDS

484
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,634
AT 7,811,

485
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:48,179
ENOUGH TO BURN STANNIS
BARATHEON'S FLEET

486
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,306
AND ARMIES BOTH.

487
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,059
THIS IS A SHIT IDEA.

488
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:56,938
I'M AFRAID I HAVE TO CONCUR
WITH MY ADVISOR, WISDOM HALLYNE.

489
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:02,151
THE CONTENTS OF THIS ROOM
COULD LAY KING'S LANDING LOW.

490
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,947
YOU WON'T BE MAKING WILDFIRE
FOR MY SISTER ANY LONGER.

491
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,702
YOU'LL BE MAKING IT
FOR ME.

492
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,879
- ( clicking )
- DRACARYS.

493
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,303
( squeaks )

494
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,973
DRACARYS.

( laughs )

498
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,526
HE'LL BE ABLE TO FEED
HIMSELF FROM NOW ON.

499

<i>LET HIM SLEEP, DOREAH.</i>

500
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,286
YES, KHALEESI.

501
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,247
HE LOVES YOU.

502
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,755
( speaking Dothraki )

503
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,427
THANK YOU, MY FRIEND.

504
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,891
DID YOU SEE THE DRESS
XARO HAD MADE FOR YOU?

505
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,977
THEY SAY HE'S
THE WEALTHIEST MAN
IN QARTH.

506
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,355
IT IS KNOWN.

507
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,441
AND IF QARTH
IS THE WEALTHIEST
CITY IN ESSOS--

508
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,360
THE LAST TIME A RICH MAN
GAVE ME A DRESS,

509
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,945
HE WAS SELLING ME
TO KHAL DROGO.

510
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:31,407
( speaks Dothraki )

511
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,330
XARO IS OUR HOST,
BUT WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM.

512
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,166
MEN LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT OTHER MEN

513
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,210
WHEN THEY'RE HAPPY.

514
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,545
( chuckles )

515
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,552
YOU WOULD LOOK LIKE
A REAL PRINCESS IN XARO'S--

516
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,597
SHE'S NOT A PRINCESS.
SHE'S A KHALEESI.

517
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,231
YOU SHOULD WEAR IT,
KHALEESI.

518
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,899
YOU ARE THEIR GUEST.

519
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:07,568
IT WOULD BE RUDE NOT TO.

520
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,909
<i>( door opens )</i>

521
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:16,619
<i>( door closes )</i>

( woman laughing )

525
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,716
AND YOU MUST VISIT
THE NIGHT MARKET.

526
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:34,595
THE QARTHEEN NIGHT MARKET
IS LIKE NO NIGHT MARKET
YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

527
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,556
- IT SOUNDS WONDERFUL.
-<i> ( men speaking Dothraki )</i>

528
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,391
THE MEEREENS THINK
THEY HAVE A NIGHT MARKET.

529
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,768
I WILL TAKE YOU
THERE MYSELF.

530
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,313
PLEASE EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT.

531
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,607
<i>( Jorah speaking Dothraki )</i>

532
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,901
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

533
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:52,655
MALAKKO SAYS THE STATUE
IS TOO HEAVY TO CARRY.

534
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,115
KOVARRO SAYS THAT
MALAKKO IS AN IDIOT.

535
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,701
<i>THEY CAN PRY OUT THE GEMS,</i>
<i>THE REST IS PURE GOLD.</i>

536
00:33:56,784 --> 00:34:00,413
VERY SOFT.
HE CAN CHOP OFF AS MUCH
AS WE CAN CARRY.

537
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:02,707
( speaking Dothraki )

538
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,818
MY BROTHER USED TO SAY
THE ONLY THING THE DOTHRAKI
KNEW HOW TO DO

539
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,029
WAS STEAL THINGS
BETTER MEN HAVE BUILT.

540
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,572
IT'S NOT THE ONLY THING.

541
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,407
THEY'RE QUITE GOOD
AT KILLING THE BETTER MEN.

542
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,535
THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF QUEEN
I'M GOING TO BE.

543
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,330
MOTHER OF DRAGONS.

544
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,749
ON BEHALF OF THE WARLOCKS
OF QARTH,

545
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,793
I WELCOME YOU.

546
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,463
A DEMONSTRATION?

547
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,635
TAKE THIS GEM.
LOOK AT IT.

548
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,846
INTO ITS DEPTHS.

549
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,349
SO MANY FACETS.

550
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:05,478
LOOK CLOSELY ENOUGH AND YOU
CAN SEE YOURSELF IN THEM.

551
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:10,107
- OFTEN MORE THAN ONCE.
- ( guests gasp )

552
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:16,864
SHOULD YOU GROW TIRED OF
XARO'S BAUBLES AND TRINKETS,

553
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:20,243
IT WOULD BE AN HONOR
TO HOST YOU AT THE HOUSE
OF THE UNDYING.

554
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,870
YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME,

555
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,623
MOTHER OF DRAGONS.

556
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,215
MY APOLOGIES.

557
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,884
PYAT PREE IS ONE
OF THE THIRTEEN.

558
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,262
IT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR ME
TO EXTEND HIM AN INVITATION.

559
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:42,515
CUSTOMS DIE
SLOW DEATHS IN QARTH.

560
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,393
WHAT IS THE HOUSE
OF THE UNDYING?

561
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:49,063
IT IS WHERE THE WARLOCKS GO
TO SQUINT AT DUSTY BOOKS

562
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:50,523
AND DRINK SHADE
OF THE EVENING.

563
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:54,735
IT TURNS THEIR LIPS BLUE
AND THEIR MINDS SOFT--

564
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,572
SO SOFT,
THEY ACTUALLY BELIEVE

565
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,740
THEIR PARLOR TRICKS
ARE MAGIC.

566
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,617
( laughs )

567
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,372
Woman:
<i>YOU WATCH OVER HER.</i>

568
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,251
DO I KNOW YOU?

569
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,086
I KNOW YOU.

570
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,631
JORAH MORMONT
OF BEAR ISLAND.

571
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,592
WHO ARE YOU?

572
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,927
I'M NO ONE.

573
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,846
BUT SHE IS
THE MOTHER OF DRAGONS.

574
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:25,433
SHE NEEDS TRUE PROTECTORS
NOW MORE THAN EVER.

575
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,393
THEY SHALL COME
DAY AND NIGHT

576
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,104
TO SEE THE WONDER BORN
INTO THE WORLD AGAIN.

577
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:33,524
AND WHEN THEY SEE,
THEY SHALL LUST,

578
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:37,445
FOR DRAGONS ARE FIRE
MADE FLESH.

579
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,114
AND FIRE IS POWER.

580
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,084
IT LOOKED LIKE STANNIS.

581
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:55,630
TO ME IT JUST
LOOKED LIKE...

582
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,636
A SHADOW IN
THE SHAPE OF A MAN.

583
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,679
IN THE SHAPE
OF STANNIS.

584
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,811
WE SHOULD REACH
MY SON'S CAMP TOMORROW.

585
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,897
WILL YOU STAY THERE
LONG, MY LADY?

586
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,525
ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO TELL
ROBB WHAT I HAVE SEEN.

587
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:19,987
AFTER THAT, I WILL LEAVE
FOR WINTERFELL.

588
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,366
MY TWO YOUNGEST NEED ME.

589
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:26,452
I'VE BEEN AWAY FROM THEM
FOR FAR TOO LONG.

590
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,538
I NEVER KNEW MY MOTHER.

591
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,291
I'M SORRY.

592
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:36,003
MY OWN MOTHER DIED
ON THE BIRTHING BED

593
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,006
WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG.

594
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,720
IT'S A BLOODY BUSINESS.

595
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:49,183
WHAT COMES AFTER
IS EVEN HARDER.

596
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:52,186
ONCE YOU'RE SAFELY BACK
AMONGST YOUR OWN PEOPLE,

597
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:55,481
WILL YOU GIVE ME LEAVE
TO GO, MY LADY?

598
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,817
YOU MEAN TO KILL STANNIS.

599
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,318
I SWORE A VOW.

600
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,738
BUT STANNIS HAS
A GREAT ARMY AROUND HIM.

601
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,199
HIS OWN GUARDS ARE SWORN
TO KEEP HIM SAFE.

602
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:07,284
<i>I'M AS GOOD</i>
<i>AS ANY OF THEM.</i>

603
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,538
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE FLED.

604
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:14,375
RENLY'S DEATH
WAS NO FAULT OF YOURS.

605
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,127
YOU SERVED HIM BRAVELY.

606
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,214
I ONLY HELD HIM
THAT ONCE

607
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:22,717
AS HE WAS DYING.

608
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,096
HE'S GONE, BRIENNE.

609
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:32,268
YOU SERVE NOTHING
AND NO ONE BY FOLLOWING
HIM INTO THE EARTH.

610
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:35,479
RENLY'S ENEMIES ARE
ROBB'S ENEMIES AS WELL.

611
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,528
I DO NOT KNOW
YOUR SON, MY LADY...

612
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,576
BUT I COULD SERVE YOU
IF YOU WOULD HAVE ME.

613
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,703
<i>YOU HAVE COURAGE.</i>

614
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:53,080
NOT BATTLE COURAGE, PERHAPS,

615
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,667
BUT, I DON'T KNOW,

616
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,461
A WOMAN'S KIND OF COURAGE.

617
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,255
<i>AND I THINK THAT</i>
<i>WHEN THE TIME COMES,</i>

618
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:02,673
<i>YOU WILL NOT HOLD ME BACK.</i>

619
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,426
PROMISE ME THAT YOU
WILL NOT HOLD ME BACK

620
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,762
FROM STANNIS.

621
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:15,603
WHEN THE TIME COMES,
I WILL NOT HOLD YOU BACK.

622
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,820
THEN I AM YOURS,
MY LADY.

623
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,239
I WILL SHIELD YOUR BACK

624
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,409
AND GIVE MY LIFE FOR YOURS
IF IT COMES TO THAT.

625
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,954
I SWEAR IT BY THE OLD GODS
AND THE NEW.

626
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:44,465
I VOW THAT YOU SHALL ALWAYS
HAVE A PLACE IN MY HOME

627
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,342
AND AT MY TABLE

628
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,969
AND THAT I SHALL ASK
NO SERVICE OF YOU

629
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,430
THAT MIGHT
BRING YOU DISHONOR.

630
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,558
I SWEAR IT
BY THE OLD GODS
AND THE NEW.

631

<i>- Man: AND IT'S NOT</i>
<i>JUST THIEVES, MY LORD.</i>

632

<i>THERE'S WOLVES</i>
<i>IN THEM HILLS NOW,</i>

633
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,736
MORE THAN I'VE EVER SEEN.

634
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,781
THEY COME DOWN IN THE NIGHT
AND THEY KILL MY SHEEP.

635
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:12,535
MY THREE SONS IS AWAY
FIGHTING FOR YOUR BROTHER,
MY LORD.

636
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,829
THEY'LL FIGHT,
KEEP FIGHTING

637
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,956
TILL THEY'RE TOLD
TO GO HOME.

638
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,542
I HAVE NO ONE
TO MAN MY FLOCK NOW.
ONLY ME.

639
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:23,379
I CAN'T KEEP WATCH
ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT.

640
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:28,008
WE CAN SEND TWO ORPHAN BOYS
FROM WINTERSTOWN HOME WITH YOU

641
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,677
TO HELP WATCH OVER
YOUR FLOCK

642
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,387
IF YOU CAN GIVE THEM
ROOM AND BOARD.

643
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,348
MY WIFE ALWAYS PRAYED
FOR MORE CHILDREN.

644
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:36,600
WE'LL LOOK AFTER THEM.
THANK YOU, MY LORD.

645
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:40,062
AND MAY THE GODS
BLESS YOU AND YOURS.

646
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,942
- STOP IT.
-<i> ( men shouting )</i>

647
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:48,362
IF THAT'S EVERYONE,
I'M GOING TO GO FOR
A RIDE BEFORE DARK.

648
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:50,281
- GOOD.
- HODOR.

649
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:54,285
- HODOR.
- Rodrik: BRAN--
LORD STARK.

650
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,162
TORRHEN'S SQUARE
IS UNDER SIEGE.

651
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:58,789
TORRHEN'S SQUARE IS BARELY
40 LEAGUES FROM HERE.

652
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:02,001
<i>HOW CAN THE LANNISTERS</i>
<i>STRIKE SO FAR NORTH?</i>

653
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,545
MIGHT BE A RAIDING PARTY
LED BY THE MOUNTAIN.

654
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,089
MIGHT BE SELLSWORDS
PAID BY TYWIN LANNISTER.

655
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,549
WE HAVE TO HELP THEM.

656
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,050
MOST OF THE FIGHTING MEN
ARE AWAY WITH ROBB,

657
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,011
BUT I CAN GATHER
200 DECENT MEN.

658
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,430
- DO YOU NEED SO MANY?
- IF WE CAN'T PROTECT
OUR OWN BANNERMEN,

659
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,183
WHY SHOULD
THEY PROTECT US?

660
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:20,019
GO, SER RODRIK.
TAKE THE MEN YOU NEED.

661
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,562
WON'T TAKE LONG, MY LORD.

662
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,606
SOUTHERNERS DON'T
DO WELL UP HERE.

663
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,410
- ( bird squawks )
- Bran: SO, WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

664
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:39,622
ASK YOUR MAESTER LUWIN.
HE'S THE ONE STUDYING
BOOKS ALL THE TIME.

665
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:43,125
I DID ASK HIM.
HE'D NEVER HEARD OF
A THREE-EYED RAVEN.

666
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:46,712
- MUST NOT MEAN
ANYTHING, THEN.
- YOU'RE LYING.

667
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,465
YOU MIGHT BE A LITTLE LORD,
BUT DON'T YOU CALL ME A LIAR.

668
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:52,843
- YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.
- I NEVER SAID I DIDN'T.

669
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,845
YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME
AN HONEST ANSWER.

670
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,932
THAT'S NOT THE SAME
AS BEING A LIAR.

671
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,600
WELL, IT'S NOT FAR OFF.

672
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:03,354
SO, YOU'VE BEEN DREAMING
OF A THREE-EYED RAVEN AGAIN?

673
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,442
IN THE GODSWOOD,
YOU TOLD ME YOU DIDN'T DREAM.

674
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:10,653
NOW WHO'S A LIAR?

675
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,408
WHAT DID YOU SEE
IN YOUR DREAM?

676
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,080
SOMETHING BAD?

677
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,499
TELL ME, BOY.

678
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:30,798
I DREAMT THAT THE SEA
CAME TO WINTERFELL.

679
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,425
I SAW WAVES CRASHING
AGAINST THE GATES

680
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:37,137
AND THE WATER CAME
FLOWING OVER THE WALLS...

681
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:42,309
<i>FLOODED THE CASTLE.</i>

682
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,355
DROWNED MEN
WERE FLOATING HERE

683
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,440
IN THE YARD.

684
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:54,196
SER RODRIK
WAS ONE OF THEM.

685
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,784
THE SEA IS HUNDREDS
OF MILES AWAY.

686
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,953
I KNOW.

687
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:03,789
- IT'S JUST A STUPID DREAM.
- I'VE GOT TO GET THESE
POTATOES TO THE KITCHEN.

688
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,332
OTHERWISE THEY'LL PUT ME
IN CHAINS AGAIN.

689
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,793
OSHA.

690
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:10,170
THE THREE-EYED RAVEN,

691
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,840
WHAT DO THEY SAY ABOUT IT

692
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,718
NORTH OF THE WALL?

693
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,929
THEY SAY ALL SORTS OF CRAZY
THINGS NORTH OF THE WALL.

694
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,689
- ( wind howling )
- ( horses neighing )

695
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,484
- Qhorin: THERE.
- Mormont:<i> WHERE?</i>

696
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,153
ON THAT MOUNTAIN.

697
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,864
Sam:
I DON'T SEE VERY WELL.

698
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,532
Jon: A FIRE.

699
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,704
THERE'S A FIRE.

700
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,749
<i>THE PEOPLE SITTING</i>
<i>AROUND IT HAVE BETTER EYES</i>
<i>THAN YOURS OR MINE.</i>

701
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:49,877
WHEN THEY SEE US COMING,
THAT FIRE BECOMES A SIGNAL.

702
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,464
GIVES MANCE RAYDER
PLENTY OF TIME TO THROW
A PARTY IN OUR HONOR.

703
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,591
HOW MANY WILDLINGS
HAVE JOINED HIM?

704
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:59,845
FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL,
ALL OF THEM.

705
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,769
Qhorin:
<i>MANCE HAS GATHERED THEM ALL</i>
<i>LIKE DEER AGAINST THE WOLVES.</i>

706
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,771
<i>THEY'RE ALMOST READY</i>
<i>TO MAKE THEIR MOVE.</i>

707
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,939
WHERE?

708
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,733
SOMEWHERE SAFE.

709
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,485
SOMEWHERE SOUTH.

710
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:17,529
<i>CAN'T JUST MARCH</i>
<i>INTO THEIR MIDST.</i>

711
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:21,241
AND WE CAN'T WAIT FOR THEM
HERE WITH NOTHING BUT A PILE
OF STONES TO PROTECT US.

712
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,036
YOU SAYING WE SHOULD
FALL BACK TO THE WALL?

713
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,581
MANCE WAS ONE OF US ONCE.

714
00:44:27,664 --> 00:44:30,042
NOW HE'S ONE OF THEM.

715
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,836
HE'S GONNA TEACH THEM
OUR WAY OF DOING THINGS.

716
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,672
THEY'LL HIT US IN FORCE.

717
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,174
AND THEY WON'T RUN AWAY
WHEN WE HIT BACK.

718
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:39,635
<i>THEY'RE GONNA BE MORE</i>
<i>ORGANIZED THAN BEFORE,</i>

719
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,595
<i>MORE DISCIPLINED,</i>

720
00:44:41,678 --> 00:44:43,597
MORE LIKE US.

721
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,183
SO WE NEED TO BE
MORE LIKE THEM,

722
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,102
DO THINGS THEIR WAY.

723
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:51,313
SNEAK IN, KILL MANCE,

724
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,065
AND SCATTER THEM
TO THE WINDS

725
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,025
BEFORE THEY CAN MARCH
ON THE WALL.

726
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:58,237
- AND TO DO THAT...
- WE NEED TO GET RID
OF THOSE LOOKOUTS.

727
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,988
IT'S NOT A JOB
FOR 400 MEN.

728
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:03,784
I NEED TO MOVE FAST
AND SILENT.

729
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:08,664
HARKER, STONESNAKE,
BORBA.

730
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:10,958
LORD COMMANDER, I'D LIKE
TO JOIN LORD QHORIN.

731
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,627
I'VE BEEN CALLED
LOTS OF THINGS,

732
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,963
- BUT THAT MIGHT BE
MY FIRST LORD QHORIN.
- ( laughs )

733
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,841
YOU'RE A STEWARD,
SNOW, NOT A RANGER.

734
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:21,176
I'VE FOUGHT
AND KILLED A WIGHT.

735
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,345
HOW MANY RANGERS
CAN SAY THAT?

736
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:26,432
HE'S THE ONE?

737
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,017
AYE.
YOU KILLED A WIGHT.

738
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,811
YOU ALSO LET AN OLD MAN

739
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,647
BEAT YOU BLOODY
AND TAKE YOUR SWORD.

740
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,066
-<i> ( men laugh )</i>
<i>- Qhorin: CRASTER?</i>

741
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,153
IN THE BOY'S DEFENSE,
THAT'S A TOUGH OLD GOAT.

742
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,908
I COULD TAKE UP JON'S DUTIES
WHILE HE'S GONE, MY LORD.

743
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,661
IT WOULD BE NO TROUBLE.

744
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:59,047
WELL, I HOPE YOU MAKE
A BETTER RANGER

745
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,508
THAN YOU DO A STEWARD.

746
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,761
GO ON.

747
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,687
Xaro:
<i>SO, TELL ME,</i>

748
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:16,857
HOW LONG HAS YOUR MANSERVANT
BEEN IN LOVE WITH YOU?

749
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,736
HE'S NOT MY MANSERVANT
AND HE'S NOT IN LOVE WITH ME.

750
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,863
HE'S MY ADVISOR,

751
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,865
MY FRIEND.

752
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,450
UNLIKELY.

753
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:29,161
I CAN ALMOST ALWAYS TELL
WHAT A MAN WANTS.

754
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,497
AND WHAT ABOUT
WHAT A WOMAN WANTS?

755
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,624
MUCH MORE COMPLICATED.

756
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,709
YOU, FOR EXAMPLE,

757
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:38,253
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

758
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:41,340
TO CROSS THE NARROW SEA
AND TAKE BACK THE IRON THRONE.

759
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:42,883
WHY?

760
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,551
BECAUSE I PROMISED
MY KHALASAR I'D PROTECT THEM

761
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,012
- AND FIND THEM A SAFE HOME.
- ( chuckles )

762
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:50,682
YOU WANT TO CONQUER
THE SEVEN KINGDOMS
FOR THE DOTHRAKI?

763
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,559
I WANT THEM BECAUSE
THEY'RE MINE BY RIGHT.

764
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,562
THE IRON THRONE IS MINE
AND I WILL TAKE IT.

765
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,481
AH, A CONQUEROR.

766
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,399
AND HOW DID YOU GET
ALL OF THIS?

767
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,735
- DID SOMEONE
GIVE IT TO YOU?
- NO.

768
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,237
I COME FROM NOTHING.

769
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,489
I HIT THE DOCKS
LIKE A PIECE OF CARGO,

770
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,991
EXCEPT SOMEONE NORMALLY
CARES WHAT HAPPENS TO CARGO.

771
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,702
SO YOU WANTED
MORE THAN YOU HAD
AND YOU TOOK IT.

772
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:14,873
YOU'RE A CONQUEROR, TOO.
YOU'RE JUST LESS AMBITIOUS.

773
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,500
( laughs )

774
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,002
MMM.

775
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,172
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
XARO XHOAN DAXOS?

776
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,758
AT THE GATES OF THE CITY,
YOU BLED FOR ME.

777
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:27,970
WHY?

778
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,347
I WILL SHOW YOU WHY.

779
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,937
- ( clangs )
- THE DOOR AND THE VAULT
IS MADE OF VALYRIAN STONE.

780
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,774
THE HARDEST STEEL
DOES NOT MAKE A MARK.

781
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:44,278
I OFFERED THE GREATEST
LOCKSMITHS IN QARTH

782
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,738
THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD
IF THEY COULD BREAK INTO IT.

783
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,283
I MADE THE SAME OFFER
TO THE GREATEST THIEVES.

784
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,910
THEY ALL WENT HOME
EMPTY-HANDED.

785
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:55,163
THE ONLY THING THAT
CAN OPEN THIS DOOR

786
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,374
IS THIS KEY.

787
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:58,959
AND BEHIND THE DOOR?

788
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,129
( chuckles )

789
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,464
AND IT CAN ALL BE MINE?

790
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,049
ALL?

791
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,803
LET US SAY HALF.

792
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:13,974
MORE THAN ENOUGH TO BUY
HORSES, SHIPS, ARMIES--

793
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,143
ENOUGH TO GO HOME.

794
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:19,104
ALL I HAVE TO DO?

795
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,480
IS MARRY ME.

796
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,609
( laughs )
THAT WAS A ROMANTIC PROPOSAL.

797
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,819
I'VE ALREADY MARRIED
ONCE FOR LOVE,

798
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:28,780
BUT THE GODS
STOLE HER FROM ME.

799
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,826
I COME FROM NOTHING.

800
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:35,871
MY MOTHER AND FATHER
NEVER OWNED A PAIR OF SHOES.

801
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,874
BUT MARRY ME AND I WILL
GIVE YOU THE SEVEN KINGDOMS

802
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:42,878
AND OUR CHILDREN WILL BE
PRINCES AND PRINCESSES.

803
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,007
SEE?

804
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:51,011
I HAVE MORE AMBITION
THAN YOU THOUGHT.

805
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:55,557
THE TIME IS RIGHT,
DAENERYS TARGARYEN,
FIRST OF YOUR NAME.

806
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:58,101
ROBERT BARATHEON
IS DEAD.

807
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,027
Jorah:
<i>IF YOU CROSS THE SEA</i>
<i>WITH AN ARMY YOU BOUGHT--</i>

808
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,404
THE SEVEN KINGDOMS ARE
AT WAR WITH ONE ANOTHER.

809
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,698
FOUR FALSE KINGS
DESTROYING THE COUNTRY.

810
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:15,035
TO WIN WESTEROS, YOU NEED
SUPPORT FROM WESTEROS.

811
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,995
THE USURPER IS DEAD.

812
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,580
THE STARKS FIGHT
THE LANNISTERS,

813
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,540
AND BARATHEONS
FIGHT EACH OTHER.

814
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,209
ACCORDING TO
YOUR NEW FRIEND

815
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,169
WHO EARNED YOUR TRUST
BY CUTTING HIS HAND?

816
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,880
THE TIME TO STRIKE IS NOW.
WE NEED TO FIND SHIPS
AND AN ARMY

817
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:29,675
OR WE'LL SPEND THE REST
OF OUR LIVES ROTTING AWAY
AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD.

818
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:32,177
RICH MEN DO NOT BECOME RICH
BY GIVING MORE THAN THEY GET.

819
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,888
THEY'LL GIVE YOU SHIPS
AND SOLDIERS AND THEY'LL
OWN YOU FOREVER.

820
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:38,725
MOVING CAREFULLY
IS THE HARD WAY,
BUT IT'S THE RIGHT WAY.

821
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,394
AND IF I'D LISTENED
TO THAT ADVICE

822
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,562
OUTSIDE THE GATES OF QARTH,
WE'D ALL BE DEAD BY NOW.

823
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,649
I KNOW THE OPPORTUNITY
BEFORE YOU SEEMS LIKE
THE LAST YOU'LL EVER HAVE,

824
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:48,402
- BUT YOU MUST--
- DO NOT SPEAK TO ME
LIKE I'M A CHILD.

825
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:54,366
- I ONLY WANT--
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

826
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,993
TELL ME.

827
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,453
TO SEE YOU
ON THE IRON THRONE.

828
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:01,206
- WHY?
- YOU HAVE A GOOD CLAIM.

829
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:04,167
A TITLE.
A BIRTHRIGHT.

830
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:07,337
BUT YOU HAVE SOMETHING
MORE THAN THAT.

831
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:11,550
YOU MAY COVER IT UP
AND DENY IT, BUT YOU
HAVE A GENTLE HEART.

832
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,302
YOU WOULD NOT ONLY
BE RESPECTED AND FEARED,

833
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,638
YOU WOULD BE LOVED.

834
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,932
SOMEONE WHO CAN RULE
AND SHOULD RULE.

835
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:23,603
CENTURIES COME AND GO
WITHOUT A PERSON LIKE THAT
COMING INTO THE WORLD.

836
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,355
THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN I LOOK AT YOU

837
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:28,233
AND I STILL CAN'T
BELIEVE YOU'RE REAL.

838
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:43,373
SO WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE ME DO AS MY ADVISOR?

839
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,089
<i>MAKE YOUR OWN WAY.</i>

840
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,842
FIND YOUR OWN SHIP.
YOU ONLY NEED ONE.

841
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:57,471
THE ALLIES WE NEED
ARE IN WESTEROS, NOT QARTH.

842
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,558
AND HOW DO I GET
THE SHIP?

843
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,977
<i>I'LL FIND IT FOR YOU.</i>

844
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,188
A SOUND SHIP
WITH A GOOD CAPTAIN.

845
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,571
I LOOK FORWARD
TO MEETING HIM.

846
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,868
KHALEESI.

847
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,756
<i>( dragons chirping )</i>

848
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,389
( hisses )

849
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,272
( clangs )

850
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,358
YOU SHOULD STAND
SIDEFACE.

851
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,527
SIDEFACE?

852
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,654
SIDEWAYS.

853
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:58,114
- WHY?
- SMALLER TARGET.

854
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,411
AM I FIGHTING SOMEONE?

855
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,914
YOU'RE PRACTICING
FOR A FIGHT.

856
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,709
YOU SHOULD PRACTICE RIGHT.

857
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,753
-<i> ( loud thud )</i>
<i>- ( woman screaming )</i>

858
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,547
GUARDS!

859
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,842
- HELP.
- DID YOU SEE ANYTHING?

860
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:22,389
GO UP THERE.
GO AND SEE WHERE
HE FELL FROM.

861
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,895
GO UP THE BACK.

862
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,106
Woman:
<i>THAT IS STRANGE.</i>

863
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,697
MOVE AWAY.

864
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,827
Man:
<i>STAND BACK.</i>
<i>HE'S DEAD.</i>

865
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:55,005
