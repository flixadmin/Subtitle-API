1
00:00:01,944 --> 00:00:03,601
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:04,813 --> 00:00:06,383
- Bruce Wayne?
- No.

3
00:00:06,476 --> 00:00:07,609
But you could be.

4
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:11,409
They've done a wonderful
job erasing the scars.

5
00:00:11,502 --> 00:00:13,146
- Are you prepared?
- Yes.

6
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:15,283
But I still don't understand
how I can help save Gotham.

7
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:17,080
You're only part of the plan.

8
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,450
You know what must happen

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,453
if he refuses.

10
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,589
No one refuses the Court.

11
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:24,758
- You lied to me.
- I didn't tell you the truth.

12
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,214
- It's the same thing.
- Perhaps.

13
00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:27,737
But telling you your mother
was a con artist

14
00:00:27,786 --> 00:00:29,233
who'd only sought you out
for the purposes of

15
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:32,655
getting money from me didn't seem like
a very attractive alternative.

16
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:36,703
I don't love you.

17
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:38,939
You need me, Edward Nygma!

18
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,874
Just as I need you.

19
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:42,475
You killed Isabella.

20
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,377
I loved her, Oswald.

21
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:10,737
Greetings, Professor.

22
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:12,706
Oh! Somebody help!

23
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,204
The building's empty.
No one's coming to help.

24
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:18,955
Have a seat.

25
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,782
Wh-Who are you?

26
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:25,319
That...

27
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:27,197
is an excellent question.

28
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:29,775
But I get to ask the first one.

29
00:01:31,745 --> 00:01:35,262
I can fill a room or just one heart.

30
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,659
Others may have me,
but I cannot be shared.

31
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,917
What am I?!

32
00:01:39,628 --> 00:01:41,083
What?

33
00:01:41,325 --> 00:01:43,692
It's a riddle. Answer the riddle!

34
00:01:43,747 --> 00:01:46,039
Uh... I...

35
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:47,107
Knowledge?

36
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:51,564
Knowledge can't be shared, Professor?

37
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,525
Really? You are the chair

38
00:01:54,103 --> 00:01:56,298
of a chemistry department.

39
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:57,845
You've spent a career

40
00:01:57,907 --> 00:01:59,920
sharing knowledge!

41
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,188
No!

42
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:08,995
I apologize.

43
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:14,634
I'm not myself these days.

44
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,739
Hands, please.

45
00:02:24,764 --> 00:02:28,014
I can be a member of a group,
but I can never blend in.

46
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:30,420
- What am I?
- I... Uh...

47
00:02:30,826 --> 00:02:31,918
A shadow?

48
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,439
The answer is an individual.

49
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,882
Duh! I expected more.

50
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:41,094
But then,

51
00:02:41,886 --> 00:02:43,886
none of the others did very well either.

52
00:02:43,972 --> 00:02:46,199
- The others?
- Oh, you'd know them.

53
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:49,975
One was an artist,

54
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:51,585
one was a writer,

55
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:54,850
one was a philosopher.

56
00:02:56,948 --> 00:03:02,256
The stars of Gotham's
intellectual and artistic...

57
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,082
constellation.

58
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,269
Fallen stars now.

59
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:08,808
Wh-Why are you doing this?

60
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:13,058
My best friend recently said

61
00:03:13,918 --> 00:03:17,816
there was no me without him.

62
00:03:20,426 --> 00:03:22,523
I shot him and dumped him in the river.

63
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:27,156
He was a sort of guide
to me on my journey.

64
00:03:27,383 --> 00:03:30,771
You see, I know who I am, Professor.

65
00:03:31,473 --> 00:03:34,975
It's how to... be him...

66
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:37,258
that is eluding me.

67
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,686
I seek guidance.

68
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:43,431
I feel your every move,
I know your every thought,

69
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:47,225
I'm with you from birth,
and I'll see you when you rot.

70
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:50,703
- What am I?!
- I don't know.

71
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:54,109
Well, that's just too bad.

72
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,054
No, no!

73
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:22,645
We'd gone to the movies.

74
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:25,807
My father wanted to cut through
the alley to get an uptown cab.

75
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:30,083
The man came out of nowhere.

76
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:32,858
His face was covered.

77
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:35,518
He had a gun.

78
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,166
I remember how cold it was.

79
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:41,510
I heard a cat.

80
00:04:41,877 --> 00:04:43,787
He shot them both, and I did...

81
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:45,724
I did nothing.

82
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:51,299
Excellent, my dear.

83
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:54,757
You truly are Bruce Wayne.

84
00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:05,936
Yes?

85
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:07,148
We're ready.

86
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,583
Then proceed.

87
00:05:08,671 --> 00:05:09,751
I'll see you tomorrow.

88
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:13,760
And on your end,
I hope your nephew is amenable.

89
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:16,651
Should he refuse,
you know what must happen.

90
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:19,394
I know the rules, Kathryn.

91
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:27,247
We are to proceed.

92
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,893
Do the rest.

93
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,551
Alfred Pennyworth is my guardian.

94
00:05:35,926 --> 00:05:38,364
He has been with me
since I can remember.

95
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:44,671
_

96
00:06:03,102 --> 00:06:05,477
What did I tell you
about dripping on the couch?

97
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:07,609
You are the only person I know
who frets about

98
00:06:07,676 --> 00:06:10,174
his drug-induced hallucination
making a mess.

99
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:11,987
But...

100
00:06:12,487 --> 00:06:13,840
if it makes you happy.

101
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:15,075
Thank you.

102
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,010
I wonder how long you will be
the public face of grief

103
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,892
when people hear that
you killed your best friend.

104
00:06:25,923 --> 00:06:27,503
And then there are your

105
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:30,659
extracurricular activities.

106
00:06:31,787 --> 00:06:34,002
How many are we up to now?

107
00:06:34,272 --> 00:06:36,207
Five? Six?

108
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:42,237
There was the curator,
the writer... pretentious ass.

109
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:43,737
So frustrating.

110
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:49,050
They all fit the profile...
High I.Q., driven, creative.

111
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:51,567
Yet each one failed.

112
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:56,347
You must be the first person in
history to go on a killing spree

113
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:58,050
in order to find a life coach.

114
00:06:58,121 --> 00:06:59,928
Perhaps you should ditch the riddles.

115
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:01,759
No.

116
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,472
A good riddle reveals the asker.

117
00:07:04,497 --> 00:07:06,817
To solve it is to solve the
mystery of the person posing it.

118
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:09,314
If I can find someone
to solve my riddles,

119
00:07:10,088 --> 00:07:11,564
I can find someone to help me.

120
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:13,067
Do you really think
you're gonna find someone

121
00:07:13,137 --> 00:07:14,473
who can teach you how to be a villain?

122
00:07:14,553 --> 00:07:15,653
Yes!

123
00:07:15,745 --> 00:07:17,279
Of course I am.

124
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:20,935
You said yourself there is no
Edward Nygma without the Penguin.

125
00:07:21,278 --> 00:07:24,419
But knowing who I am...

126
00:07:25,216 --> 00:07:27,638
and knowing how to be him...
those are separate things.

127
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:29,874
Ed, villains do not have teachers!

128
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:33,735
I made myself into the Penguin when
I threw Fish Mooney off a building.

129
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:36,102
I didn't have anyone's help.

130
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:38,712
Oh, how interesting.

131
00:07:39,618 --> 00:07:41,626
Perhaps I'm thinking
about this all wrong.

132
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:43,592
Obviously.

133
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:45,423
I don't need a teacher.

134
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,025
I need an enemy.

135
00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:49,682
- No, that is not...
- The greatest villains

136
00:07:49,738 --> 00:07:52,807
have always been defined by
the men that try to stop them!

137
00:07:54,643 --> 00:07:56,144
And I know the perfect man.

138
00:07:58,532 --> 00:08:00,666
Please, do not say...

139
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:02,502
Jim Gordon.

140
00:08:04,613 --> 00:08:07,455
A serial killer of smart people?

141
00:08:07,523 --> 00:08:09,791
In the last few weeks,
six members of Gotham's

142
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:13,040
intellectual and artistic elite
have killed themselves

143
00:08:13,095 --> 00:08:14,839
or died in strange accidents?

144
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:17,933
Last night, an old professor
of mine died in a lab fire.

145
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,941
At a certain point,
coincidence becomes pattern.

146
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:23,447
You getting bored
down in the lab, Lucius?

147
00:08:23,472 --> 00:08:25,952
Yes, but that is not
why you should look at this.

148
00:08:25,977 --> 00:08:28,810
Listen, we are still finding bodies

149
00:08:28,877 --> 00:08:30,878
from Jerome's night
of murder and mayhem,

150
00:08:30,946 --> 00:08:34,790
not to mention out looking for
our dear missing mayor.

151
00:08:34,837 --> 00:08:39,298
I do not have the resources
to allocate to your hunch.

152
00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:42,048
Did you hear how I used
that word "allocate," hmm?

153
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:44,257
Let me call Gordon.

154
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:46,527
No, no. The man's due R&R.

155
00:08:46,595 --> 00:08:50,774
Besides, he's reconnecting with
some long-lost uncle or something.

156
00:08:51,392 --> 00:08:53,975
Jim Gordon? Detective Jim Gordon?

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,672
Gordon ain't here.
So give me the message, fruit guy.

158
00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:17,613
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

159
00:09:17,951 --> 00:09:19,438
One more time.

160
00:09:20,696 --> 00:09:22,630
What the hell is this?

161
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:24,836
"Six masters passed."

162
00:09:24,923 --> 00:09:26,776
That could be the six murders.

163
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:28,104
I told you...

164
00:09:28,182 --> 00:09:30,638
Harvey, the killer's
sending Gordon a clue.

165
00:09:30,706 --> 00:09:32,473
He's gonna kill again.

166
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,641
Okay, say you're right.

167
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:36,099
- Now, which way is up on this thing?
- Let me see that.

168
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:37,787
"A king, a queen and her corps..."

169
00:09:37,913 --> 00:09:40,083
It's a drawing of the Knight's Tour.

170
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:41,449
Right.

171
00:09:41,517 --> 00:09:44,085
So the target is...

172
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:47,708
Come on.

173
00:10:06,842 --> 00:10:07,909
Thanks for coming.

174
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:09,477
Like I had a choice?

175
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:11,283
Oh, you'll thank me.

176
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,775
This is gonna be electrifying.

177
00:10:29,683 --> 00:10:31,261
Knight to Queen 3. Mate in two.

178
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:32,783
- Shh!
- Quiet, please.

179
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:33,820
Oh, honestly.

180
00:10:33,887 --> 00:10:36,255
They call anyone a
grandmaster these days.

181
00:10:38,158 --> 00:10:40,225
Can we discuss why you're doing this?

182
00:10:40,594 --> 00:10:42,241
I've told you why.

183
00:10:42,313 --> 00:10:43,373
The real reason.

184
00:10:47,468 --> 00:10:51,172
See, Ed, the trouble with talking to
projections of your psyche...

185
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:53,586
and you of all people
should know this...

186
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,281
is that they know everything you know.

187
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,580
Including the things
you're trying not to know.

188
00:11:00,648 --> 00:11:02,622
Gordon can't help you.

189
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:04,606
No one can.

190
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,333
Face the truth.

191
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:21,189
Excuse me, sir.

192
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,742
No Jim Gordon.

193
00:11:24,138 --> 00:11:25,972
Well, then who solved...

194
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,408
All right, officers. Of course.

195
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:29,776
- How can I help you?
- Yes, ma'am,

196
00:11:29,843 --> 00:11:31,844
we need to evacuate
the building immediately.

197
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,913
We're in the middle
of an important tournament.

198
00:11:33,981 --> 00:11:35,148
Are you sure?

199
00:11:35,215 --> 00:11:36,725
Maybe I was wrong.

200
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:38,749
Maybe this isn't the place.

201
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,782
Oh, how interesting.

202
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:44,357
Checkmate!

203
00:11:46,802 --> 00:11:48,928
GCPD! Everybody out!

204
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:51,989
Don't move! Freeze!

205
00:11:52,014 --> 00:11:54,346
Forget what I just said. Freeze.

206
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:56,408
Do not move.

207
00:11:58,771 --> 00:12:00,271
Why am I here, Uncle Frank?

208
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:01,596
Maybe you want to tell me

209
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,722
where the hell you've been
since I was a kid?

210
00:12:03,876 --> 00:12:05,779
Or what happened between you and my dad?

211
00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:07,612
Yes. Yes, I do.

212
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,201
But I need to know that you trust me.

213
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,054
You're family. Course I trust you.

214
00:12:15,357 --> 00:12:18,424
Did you ever do something
you thought was right at the time,

215
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:21,847
but would now give your life to do over?

216
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,402
Yes.

217
00:12:24,531 --> 00:12:27,283
Looking back, I've done too many
terrible things like that.

218
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:31,057
But the worst
was break from your father.

219
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:33,106
Keep talking.

220
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:35,007
I loved my brother Peter dearly.

221
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:37,443
And you're my brother's son.

222
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,594
I came back to Gotham
because of you, Jim.

223
00:12:41,648 --> 00:12:43,916
I want to make things right between us.

224
00:12:46,227 --> 00:12:48,454
So you shift your weight
to your front foot

225
00:12:48,522 --> 00:12:49,655
as you swing your arm forward.

226
00:12:49,723 --> 00:12:51,190
Just like chopping down a branch.

227
00:12:51,258 --> 00:12:53,526
Like, so. Easy as pie.

228
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,862
Right, so, weight on the back foot.

229
00:12:56,473 --> 00:12:58,428
Blade comes back evenly.

230
00:12:58,453 --> 00:12:59,699
- Shh.
- And... What?

231
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:02,976
Precision under pressure
is everything, Master Bruce.

232
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:08,152
And a clear conscience.

233
00:13:10,611 --> 00:13:11,978
Were you aiming for the window,
Master Bruce?

234
00:13:12,045 --> 00:13:13,079
You keep distracting me.

235
00:13:13,147 --> 00:13:15,281
Well, you should be able to hit the
target regardless, shouldn't you?

236
00:13:15,349 --> 00:13:17,953
I mean, you had rules about training,

237
00:13:18,024 --> 00:13:20,153
rules which would be
impossible to stand by

238
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,926
if you remain unfocused.

239
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,473
Now, I sense there's something weighing

240
00:13:25,092 --> 00:13:26,653
on your mind.

241
00:13:26,994 --> 00:13:28,696
Miss Kyle, perhaps?

242
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,463
I'm not unfocused because of Selina.

243
00:13:30,531 --> 00:13:31,992
Oh, right. I see. Right.

244
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:33,904
So it wouldn't trouble you to
know that she dropped a note off

245
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:36,513
for you in the mailbox, then.

246
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:38,302
She asked to see you.

247
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,654
Tomorrow.

248
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,556
No.

249
00:13:45,684 --> 00:13:48,386
Selina's been avoiding me for weeks.

250
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:51,168
It's gonna take more than a note
to have me running.

251
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:05,565
I got Alvarez and Campos looking

252
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,909
into the other egghead deaths.

253
00:14:06,934 --> 00:14:08,267
Hopefully, something will kick up.

254
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:09,925
Or else we can sit around
and wait for him

255
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,370
to send us more singing fruit.

256
00:14:11,438 --> 00:14:13,840
Maybe he has sent us a clue.

257
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:15,461
Oh.

258
00:14:15,954 --> 00:14:17,719
- Oh, oh, oh.
- Mm-hmm.

259
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:23,282
You're late.

260
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,885
I expected this call seven minutes ago.

261
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:28,509
This is Lucius Fox of the GCPD.

262
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,687
I know who you are, Mr. Fox.

263
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:33,766
And by the way, it's bad manners
to intercept other people's mail.

264
00:14:33,844 --> 00:14:35,995
You mean the telegram you sent Gordon.

265
00:14:36,063 --> 00:14:37,935
He's not here. Who is this?

266
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:40,231
You don't actually expect me
to answer that, do you?

267
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:42,268
Then tell me why you killed
Professor Dyson and the others.

268
00:14:42,336 --> 00:14:44,303
- I know it was you.
- I had no choice.

269
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:45,905
They failed my test.

270
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,764
Now it's your turn to try.

271
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:50,710
And if I don't accept the invitation?

272
00:14:50,777 --> 00:14:53,546
There are lives at stake, Mr. Fox.

273
00:14:53,614 --> 00:14:56,063
Not just your own. Now, listen closely.

274
00:14:56,141 --> 00:14:58,290
Tomorrow, when the pawn's on queen,

275
00:14:58,383 --> 00:15:00,723
you'll find my next target
in the belly of the beast.

276
00:15:00,787 --> 00:15:03,965
Solve my clue, Mr. Fox,

277
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:08,079
and you'll be one step closer
to passing my test.

278
00:15:10,891 --> 00:15:14,055
- When the pawn's on queen?
- Belly of the beast.

279
00:15:14,657 --> 00:15:16,561
And I'll be one step closer

280
00:15:16,764 --> 00:15:18,873
to introducing myself to Gotham.

281
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:21,736
Once and for all.

282
00:15:37,543 --> 00:15:38,743
Close.

283
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:40,478
Better luck next time.

284
00:15:40,546 --> 00:15:42,433
I missed on purpose.

285
00:15:42,548 --> 00:15:44,115
Oh?

286
00:15:44,566 --> 00:15:46,417
Wanted to make sure my gun works.

287
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:47,785
Oh, come on, Jim.

288
00:15:48,571 --> 00:15:50,868
- What do you take me for?
- I have no idea.

289
00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:53,423
You say you've done terrible
things, you bring me out here,

290
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,647
you promise me the truth,
and I'm still waiting.

291
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:59,195
If this is a trust-building
exercise, it's not working.

292
00:16:00,246 --> 00:16:02,675
What happened between you and my father?

293
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,220
Have you ever heard the old Gotham
tales about the Court of Owls?

294
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:14,859
Pretend I haven't.

295
00:16:16,729 --> 00:16:18,363
The Court is a secret society

296
00:16:18,747 --> 00:16:20,993
that's controlled Gotham for centuries.

297
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:25,087
Started by its oldest, wealthiest,
most influential families.

298
00:16:25,237 --> 00:16:26,604
The Court was once a mechanism

299
00:16:26,672 --> 00:16:29,173
devoted to maintaining
balance in Gotham.

300
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:32,377
But time and power have corrupted them.

301
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,091
If it's so secret,
how do you know about them?

302
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,302
Your father and I were both members.

303
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:40,552
I still am a member.

304
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:47,425
Is that so?

305
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:49,327
The Court doesn't mean you any harm.

306
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,587
They have the highest regard for you.

307
00:16:52,031 --> 00:16:54,132
In fact, they want you
to become a member.

308
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,072
Peters, we got a tip from a guy

309
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,509
who electrocuted a bunch of players
at a fancy chess tournament,

310
00:17:04,577 --> 00:17:06,411
pointing us to a pawn on queens.

311
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:09,479
Now, here, you work at a
pawn shop on Queens Avenue.

312
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:10,789
Coincidence? No.

313
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,218
So? I don't know nothing about that.

314
00:17:13,285 --> 00:17:15,076
Why are you so close to me?

315
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:17,255
Many interrogators employ the tactic

316
00:17:17,323 --> 00:17:20,451
of invading someone's personal
space to destabilize them.

317
00:17:20,693 --> 00:17:22,627
Do you feel destabilized, Mr. Peters?

318
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,873
Is this guy even a cop?

319
00:17:24,946 --> 00:17:27,165
Hey! We can do this the
hard way or the easy way,

320
00:17:27,233 --> 00:17:28,688
and I'm wearing my nicest suit.

321
00:17:28,713 --> 00:17:30,902
- So I prefer the easy way.
- Hey, screw you.

322
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,871
All right. Lucius, hit him.

323
00:17:32,938 --> 00:17:34,105
- What?
- What?

324
00:17:34,173 --> 00:17:35,473
I'm wearing my nice suit.

325
00:17:35,986 --> 00:17:37,773
We're disregarding
the latter half of the clue.

326
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:39,689
It said we'd find the target
in the belly of the beast.

327
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:42,313
Oh. If you want to do a cavity search

328
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:44,189
on this slob, go ahead, be my guest.

329
00:17:44,214 --> 00:17:46,084
- Hey, you could just hit me.
- No one's hitting anyone.

330
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:47,495
I wasn't even supposed to work today.

331
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,528
I was covering for Teddy Thirio,
the owner's cousin.

332
00:17:50,676 --> 00:17:52,023
Thirio?

333
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,025
That's the Greek word for beast.

334
00:17:54,093 --> 00:17:57,390
You know, sometimes I think you
just make that stuff up. Come on.

335
00:18:03,302 --> 00:18:04,632
What are you making?

336
00:18:06,116 --> 00:18:07,859
- Shepherd's pie.
- Again?

337
00:18:07,937 --> 00:18:10,531
Well, you're more than welcome
to take over the menu, Master Bruce.

338
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:11,707
Did I ever tell you

339
00:18:11,781 --> 00:18:14,455
how I copped this recipe
from an old lady friend of mine?

340
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,647
Sylvia.

341
00:18:15,714 --> 00:18:18,082
A memorable fling.

342
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,051
Ended badly, though.

343
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,387
Can't remember what we rowed
about, something idiotic.

344
00:18:22,454 --> 00:18:24,589
It left me reeling, Master Bruce.

345
00:18:24,657 --> 00:18:27,358
- I couldn't concentrate on my studies.
- Really?

346
00:18:27,426 --> 00:18:29,293
You think telling me
a transparent anecdote

347
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:30,962
- will make me run to Selina?
- No, I don't.

348
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,097
You see, Sylvia and I, we got closure.

349
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,022
Now, it seems that
Miss Kyle has offered you

350
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,398
the same opportunity,
and I suggest that you...

351
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,005
you take it.

352
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,210
Fine.

353
00:18:48,222 --> 00:18:49,734
If it'll get you to stop, I'll go.

354
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:52,938
I'll keep the pie warm
for you, Master Bruce.

355
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,110
Thirio's not in his apartment.

356
00:18:56,493 --> 00:18:58,711
Have Campos put out a citywide BOLO.

357
00:18:59,196 --> 00:19:02,228
I'm going to the academy
graduation. I have to, uh...

358
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:04,696
impart my wisdom on the new cadets.

359
00:19:04,763 --> 00:19:05,830
How do I look?

360
00:19:06,564 --> 00:19:08,566
Is this what Gordon deals with?

361
00:19:08,728 --> 00:19:10,213
Thank you.

362
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:12,337
Have you seen my badge?

363
00:19:13,772 --> 00:19:17,175
The Chess Killer. How terrifying.

364
00:19:17,242 --> 00:19:19,978
How will anyone sleep knowing
the Chess Killer's on the loose?

365
00:19:20,045 --> 00:19:21,879
It's just a name
dreamed up by some hack.

366
00:19:21,947 --> 00:19:23,214
Today will change everything.

367
00:19:23,282 --> 00:19:24,616
This is a mistake, what you're doing.

368
00:19:24,683 --> 00:19:25,984
I don't recall asking you.

369
00:19:26,051 --> 00:19:27,819
I showed you how to be Ed Nygma,

370
00:19:27,886 --> 00:19:29,487
a man who could run the underworld

371
00:19:29,555 --> 00:19:31,535
and operate in plain sight.

372
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:33,590
What you are planning is madness.

373
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:36,094
No. It's a way forward.

374
00:19:36,161 --> 00:19:38,229
And the fact that it scares you

375
00:19:38,297 --> 00:19:40,255
gives me all the confirmation I need.

376
00:19:40,341 --> 00:19:41,899
Ed, you are not sleeping.

377
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:43,101
You are taking drugs.

378
00:19:43,168 --> 00:19:45,536
You are having a conversation
with your dead friend.

379
00:19:45,591 --> 00:19:47,620
Just admit that you are lost without me

380
00:19:47,674 --> 00:19:49,565
or you will destroy everything!

381
00:19:49,642 --> 00:19:51,378
I have to go.

382
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:56,881
What are you doing?

383
00:20:23,793 --> 00:20:25,376
Enough!

384
00:20:25,444 --> 00:20:28,079
I admit that killing you
killed a part of me!

385
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:32,329
But I will find a way
forward no matter the cost.

386
00:20:32,884 --> 00:20:35,119
I will be born anew!

387
00:20:35,227 --> 00:20:37,188
And I will leave you behind.

388
00:20:37,256 --> 00:20:38,623
Penguin saw you, Ed.

389
00:20:38,691 --> 00:20:41,225
He was the only one. He made you!

390
00:20:41,293 --> 00:20:45,229
There is no Ed Nygma
without the Penguin!

391
00:20:45,782 --> 00:20:48,989
Meet Ted Thirio...
came in about an hour ago.

392
00:20:49,075 --> 00:20:51,436
Cause of death seems to be
blunt force trauma to the head.

393
00:20:51,503 --> 00:20:53,185
However, Mr. Thirio also has

394
00:20:53,247 --> 00:20:55,286
a long incision along
the right side of his abdomen

395
00:20:55,372 --> 00:20:57,208
that's been crudely stapled shut.

396
00:20:57,276 --> 00:21:00,771
The Chess Killer promised a clue
inside the belly of the beast.

397
00:21:00,841 --> 00:21:02,780
Think there might be
something in his stomach?

398
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,771
Okay.

399
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,718
You worked at Arkham Asylum.

400
00:21:07,255 --> 00:21:11,155
Why would a killer engage
in this kind of cat and mouse?

401
00:21:11,223 --> 00:21:14,214
Crazy or sane, at the core,
most people just want answers

402
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,593
to life's big questions.

403
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:17,253
"Will I ever be loved?"

404
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:18,463
"Who am I?"

405
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,229
Although most people try
to answer the question

406
00:21:20,268 --> 00:21:21,932
in a logical fashion, while...

407
00:21:22,267 --> 00:21:23,815
others...

408
00:21:26,438 --> 00:21:28,026
Hmm.

409
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:31,226
Stuff Harvey Bullock's badge
inside a dead body.

410
00:21:31,297 --> 00:21:32,497
What does that mean?

411
00:21:32,577 --> 00:21:34,218
Means I know who the next target is.

412
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:35,687
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Uh...

413
00:21:35,773 --> 00:21:38,449
Thank you, Doctor. Sorry.
I know. Thank you.

414
00:21:42,481 --> 00:21:46,865
"As you take the badge today,
approach Gotham as you would...

415
00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:49,961
"a cut of prime rib.

416
00:21:50,232 --> 00:21:53,064
"Have a plan, don't be afraid,

417
00:21:53,132 --> 00:21:56,534
and have plenty of antacids
on hand in case of indigestion."

418
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,174
What the hell are you doing here?

419
00:22:02,274 --> 00:22:05,080
Well, seeing as how your department

420
00:22:05,174 --> 00:22:07,244
is unable to locate our missing mayor,

421
00:22:07,354 --> 00:22:09,947
I'm here to give the graduating class
a few remarks in his stead.

422
00:22:10,015 --> 00:22:14,135
There's no way I'm letting a cop-killer
address those cadets.

423
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,416
I see.

424
00:22:15,441 --> 00:22:18,009
How is the view from
the moral high ground, Harvey?

425
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,486
View's perfect.

426
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:20,853
Now get lost.

427
00:22:22,761 --> 00:22:24,894
Oh, Lucius Fox.

428
00:22:24,974 --> 00:22:27,186
Must be about me.

429
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,303
Want to play?

430
00:22:39,328 --> 00:22:41,263
Come on, you guys want to play?
You want to play?

431
00:22:41,288 --> 00:22:43,222
Come on.

432
00:22:48,906 --> 00:22:50,715
I'm looking for Selina Kyle!

433
00:22:50,856 --> 00:22:52,957
Oh, I remember you. Bruce Wayne.

434
00:22:53,036 --> 00:22:55,262
- Listen, I don't want any trouble.
- You sure?

435
00:22:56,047 --> 00:22:57,555
- How much cash you got?
- Get him, Sonny.

436
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,422
Stop!

437
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,313
Sonny, I said back off!

438
00:23:05,915 --> 00:23:08,382
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

439
00:23:09,296 --> 00:23:11,186
- Can we go somewhere?
- No.

440
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,994
I got to talk to Sonny.

441
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:15,580
We got business.

442
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:17,929
Oh.

443
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:20,598
Does that shock
your tender sensibilities?

444
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,094
- He's a thief.
- I'm a thief.

445
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:24,002
- You can't trust him.
- But I can trust you?

446
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,436
Look, I'm sorry.

447
00:23:25,785 --> 00:23:27,995
I should've told you I suspected
your mother of lying.

448
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,942
- I was trying to protect you, Selina.
- I can protect myself.

449
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:33,876
Just go home, Bruce.

450
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,402
You don't belong here.

451
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:42,909
Why'd you ask me here
if were going to be this way?

452
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,282
What are you talking about?

453
00:23:45,798 --> 00:23:47,859
The note you left in my mailbox.

454
00:23:48,782 --> 00:23:51,124
I didn't leave any note.

455
00:23:52,085 --> 00:23:55,402
Don't come looking for me again.

456
00:23:56,263 --> 00:23:58,398
We'll talk later, Sonny.

457
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,753
Too bad your girlfriend split.

458
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,846
I don't think she's my girlfriend.

459
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,807
Me neither.

460
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:15,940
So about that money.

461
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,203
My turn.

462
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:26,086
Oh, poor Brucey.

463
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,367
Staying down there, boy, big boy?

464
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:30,635
Oh.

465
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:32,570
Oh, he's up. Big boy.

466
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:52,994
Hello, cadets.

467
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:56,096
My name is Edward Nygma.

468
00:24:56,353 --> 00:24:59,041
Captain Bullock's... tied up.

469
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:02,034
What a day.

470
00:25:02,362 --> 00:25:03,901
Eh?

471
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,862
You all look just dandy
in your uniforms.

472
00:25:07,979 --> 00:25:09,024
How do I look?

473
00:25:12,031 --> 00:25:13,645
I have one question for all of you:

474
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:18,281
Light as a feather,
yet no man can hold it long.

475
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:20,516
What am I?

476
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,027
Well, no future commissioners here.

477
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,162
The answer is...

478
00:25:40,723 --> 00:25:42,176
...your breath.

479
00:25:56,944 --> 00:25:59,456
- Think that's for me.
- You Foxy?

480
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,913
Nygma.

481
00:26:05,234 --> 00:26:06,430
Hello.

482
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:08,515
Only one person refers to me as Foxy.

483
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,735
I have gassed a room full of
folks with a deadly toxin.

484
00:26:11,813 --> 00:26:14,484
I cordially invite you to come upstairs

485
00:26:14,554 --> 00:26:16,578
and play a game with me
for the antidote.

486
00:26:16,646 --> 00:26:18,859
This is game between me and you.

487
00:26:18,937 --> 00:26:23,787
Come upstairs alone,
or the cadets and Bullock die.

488
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:25,617
I'm on my way.

489
00:26:31,928 --> 00:26:33,662
Well, look who it is.

490
00:26:33,794 --> 00:26:36,583
I'm so glad you decided to play.

491
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:37,866
Are you okay, Harvey?

492
00:26:38,316 --> 00:26:40,138
Look at him.

493
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,230
He's fine.

494
00:26:41,304 --> 00:26:43,529
I want to hear Harvey say he's okay.

495
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:48,410
Don't try and outsmart
this lunatic, Lucius!

496
00:26:48,477 --> 00:26:50,712
Cadets' lives are at stake.

497
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:53,457
Let's begin.

498
00:26:53,544 --> 00:26:54,980
Wonderful.

499
00:26:55,058 --> 00:26:57,118
I will give you three riddles.

500
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:01,100
For every riddle you get wrong,
I cut a rope.

501
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:02,772
You get three wrong,

502
00:27:02,866 --> 00:27:04,817
and this excuse for a higher primate

503
00:27:04,842 --> 00:27:06,806
and the antidote

504
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,610
around his neck...

505
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:12,534
...fall over the ledge.

506
00:27:14,489 --> 00:27:16,786
Wow.

507
00:27:17,356 --> 00:27:18,890
Am I clear?

508
00:27:19,052 --> 00:27:20,442
And if I get them right?

509
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,467
Everyone lives!

510
00:27:22,545 --> 00:27:25,522
Even if you get just one.

511
00:27:25,695 --> 00:27:27,630
Can't say fairer than that.

512
00:27:29,585 --> 00:27:30,919
Okay.

513
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:34,115
Wonderful.

514
00:27:34,311 --> 00:27:35,708
First riddle.

515
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:38,967
I can fill a room or just one heart.

516
00:27:39,061 --> 00:27:41,834
Others can have me, but I can't be shared.

517
00:27:41,935 --> 00:27:43,771
What am I?

518
00:27:44,033 --> 00:27:46,070
The answer's love.

519
00:27:46,802 --> 00:27:48,503
What?

520
00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:50,103
No.

521
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:52,255
No!

522
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:56,211
The... the answer is loneliness!

523
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,346
How do you not know that?!

524
00:27:58,414 --> 00:27:59,548
No, no, no.

525
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:02,597
No, Nygma. No, no! Oh, God!

526
00:28:09,664 --> 00:28:11,198
Ask me another.

527
00:28:11,249 --> 00:28:13,358
Okay. Second riddle.

528
00:28:13,506 --> 00:28:16,615
I can be a member of a group,
but can never blend in.

529
00:28:16,805 --> 00:28:18,505
What am I?

530
00:28:21,143 --> 00:28:22,392
A snowflake.

531
00:28:22,511 --> 00:28:24,345
A sn...

532
00:28:24,761 --> 00:28:25,827
No!

533
00:28:25,957 --> 00:28:27,822
No! No!

534
00:28:27,954 --> 00:28:30,642
The answer is an individual!

535
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,103
Wait!

536
00:28:32,173 --> 00:28:34,900
Snowflake is also a suitable answer.

537
00:28:34,962 --> 00:28:37,274
No two are alike,
making them by definition

538
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,943
individuals... therefore an answer

539
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,278
befitting your riddle.

540
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:45,293
Okay. I don't think you grasp
how this works.

541
00:28:45,387 --> 00:28:47,613
You have to give my answer.

542
00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:55,811
Oh, Mama! I'm sorry! Oh, God!

543
00:28:57,933 --> 00:28:59,500
Oswald was right.

544
00:28:59,661 --> 00:29:01,708
He's the only one...

545
00:29:03,157 --> 00:29:04,729
No!

546
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:06,541
It's just you.

547
00:29:07,182 --> 00:29:10,044
You aren't a good enough enemy!

548
00:29:12,521 --> 00:29:14,893
No. No.

549
00:29:16,572 --> 00:29:19,158
No. Three riddles.

550
00:29:19,228 --> 00:29:21,556
Three answers. Those are the rules, Ed.

551
00:29:21,642 --> 00:29:23,932
Okay. Final riddle.

552
00:29:24,026 --> 00:29:26,831
I feel your every move,
I know your every thought,

553
00:29:26,964 --> 00:29:29,967
I'm with you from birth,
and I'll see you rot.

554
00:29:30,011 --> 00:29:31,193
What am I?

555
00:29:31,275 --> 00:29:32,850
What did you do, Ed?

556
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,248
What did you...

557
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,264
What happened to Penguin?

558
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:42,213
Something happened, didn't it?

559
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,384
Did you kill him?

560
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:51,222
This is not gonna be good.
This is not gonna be good.

561
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,950
- You did, didn't you?
- I feel your every thought...

562
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:57,217
I feel your every move,
I know your every thought,

563
00:29:57,287 --> 00:30:00,826
I'm with you from birth,
and I'll see you rot.

564
00:30:00,951 --> 00:30:02,404
What am I?!

565
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:05,369
A reflection.

566
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:08,667
Why does it always
have to be three answers?!

567
00:30:08,745 --> 00:30:10,941
Why can't he get four?! Come on!

568
00:30:11,503 --> 00:30:13,416
Correct.

569
00:30:17,175 --> 00:30:18,642
Oops.

570
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,660
Thanks, buddy.

571
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:31,462
I never doubted you.

572
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:58,689
You.

573
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,237
What are you doing here?

574
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:04,328
It's good to see you, too.

575
00:31:04,885 --> 00:31:06,747
How'd things go with Selina?

576
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,426
How did you...?

577
00:31:11,474 --> 00:31:12,859
You sent that note.

578
00:31:17,678 --> 00:31:19,532
And you're dressed like me.

579
00:31:19,771 --> 00:31:21,678
- Even your hair.
- Yes.

580
00:31:22,115 --> 00:31:24,328
Like looking into a mirror.

581
00:31:26,728 --> 00:31:28,863
Powerful knockout drug.

582
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:36,927
Why?

583
00:31:37,111 --> 00:31:40,464
This... is what I was made for.

584
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:51,102
To be Bruce Wayne.

585
00:31:58,276 --> 00:32:00,510
How could you, how could my father

586
00:32:00,612 --> 00:32:02,596
have been a part of this?

587
00:32:02,757 --> 00:32:04,491
We were proud to join.

588
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:07,051
We thought we were gonna do good.

589
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,754
The Court lied to us.

590
00:32:10,822 --> 00:32:12,922
Or we lied to ourselves. I don't know.

591
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:14,358
And now?

592
00:32:14,426 --> 00:32:16,126
You're still a loyal member?

593
00:32:16,194 --> 00:32:17,561
They think so.

594
00:32:17,629 --> 00:32:20,889
I was a true believer. God help me.

595
00:32:22,288 --> 00:32:24,718
I despise them with
every bone in my body.

596
00:32:24,828 --> 00:32:27,004
What changed your mind?

597
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:28,172
Your father

598
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:29,974
saw through their lies.

599
00:32:30,218 --> 00:32:32,757
I didn't listen to him
until it was too late.

600
00:32:33,111 --> 00:32:34,890
When was too late?

601
00:32:35,865 --> 00:32:37,366
When they killed him.

602
00:32:37,444 --> 00:32:38,482
No.

603
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,657
No, I was there.

604
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,287
It was an accident, a drunk driver.

605
00:32:43,355 --> 00:32:45,322
Just looked that way.

606
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:48,025
I was there! I was in the wreck.

607
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:49,360
I watched him die.

608
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:51,729
Car wrecks like that are
simple business for the Court.

609
00:32:52,194 --> 00:32:55,366
My brother was making trouble,
and they killed him.

610
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:57,134
As sure as I'm standing here now.

611
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,249
Now?!

612
00:33:00,138 --> 00:33:02,840
Some 20 odd years later,
and you come and you tell me

613
00:33:02,908 --> 00:33:05,009
this crazy story.
Where the hell have you been?!

614
00:33:05,076 --> 00:33:07,144
Where were you when
my mom and I needed you?

615
00:33:07,212 --> 00:33:09,649
I'm truly sorry I wasn't
there for you, Jim.

616
00:33:09,981 --> 00:33:11,735
I had no choice.

617
00:33:12,017 --> 00:33:14,852
The Court sent me overseas.
I had to prove my loyalty.

618
00:33:15,352 --> 00:33:17,388
Why would you prove
your loyalty to a group

619
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:18,856
that murdered your own brother?

620
00:33:19,175 --> 00:33:21,258
I knew they'd kill me if I didn't obey.

621
00:33:21,326 --> 00:33:23,105
I chose to live.

622
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,162
Until now.

623
00:33:25,347 --> 00:33:26,430
Why now?

624
00:33:26,498 --> 00:33:28,826
Because now you've been
asked to join the Court.

625
00:33:28,912 --> 00:33:30,717
Now I'm not alone.

626
00:33:32,037 --> 00:33:33,483
Now...

627
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:36,674
you can help me destroy
them from within.

628
00:33:37,287 --> 00:33:39,310
Others have tried and failed,

629
00:33:39,699 --> 00:33:43,089
but with you and I working
together inside the Court,

630
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:45,034
we could bring the rule
of democracy and law

631
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,084
- back to Gotham.
- Why should I trust you?

632
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:48,385
Why should I believe you?

633
00:33:48,917 --> 00:33:50,727
Because we're family?

634
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:55,125
You have to believe in something.

635
00:33:57,611 --> 00:33:59,663
And while all
the cadets survived the attack,

636
00:33:59,731 --> 00:34:01,098
police say the culprit,

637
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:04,456
former mayoral chief of staff
Edward Nygma, remains at large.

638
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:06,136
Be on the lookout for a green suit.

639
00:34:06,191 --> 00:34:08,505
- That's right...
- Good evening, Alfred.

640
00:34:08,573 --> 00:34:10,774
And to you, Master Bruce.

641
00:34:11,214 --> 00:34:12,824
Well, you seem remarkably chipper.

642
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:14,674
Things went well with
Ms. Kyle, I take it?

643
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,620
Selina's Selina.

644
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:17,870
Ah, say no more.

645
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:20,402
You spoke. That's all
that matters. Isn't it?

646
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,287
You up for some shepherd's pie, then?

647
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,797
Sounds delicious.

648
00:34:26,507 --> 00:34:28,179
Right. Jolly good.

649
00:34:28,503 --> 00:34:29,906
I'll be a mo.

650
00:34:37,133 --> 00:34:39,536
Team, spread out.

651
00:34:40,063 --> 00:34:41,630
Lock down egress.

652
00:34:41,758 --> 00:34:43,621
- We're all clear.
- Clear.

653
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,049
Now upstairs.

654
00:34:47,934 --> 00:34:49,434
We're clear.

655
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,487
Captain, all clear.

656
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:56,143
I know.

657
00:34:56,245 --> 00:34:58,283
He's not here.

658
00:35:26,154 --> 00:35:28,004
Hello, Foxy.

659
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:36,558
So, the antidote around Bullock's neck,

660
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:38,817
that turned out to be grape juice.

661
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:43,614
And the deadly toxin:
plain old knockout gas.

662
00:35:43,865 --> 00:35:45,232
Why the charade?

663
00:35:45,675 --> 00:35:48,019
Well, the point wasn't
to kill a bunch of cops.

664
00:35:48,168 --> 00:35:51,535
The point was to have you play my game.

665
00:35:51,605 --> 00:35:53,107
But you killed Penguin,

666
00:35:53,174 --> 00:35:55,552
and you killed Professor Dyson
and the others.

667
00:35:55,844 --> 00:35:57,302
Why?

668
00:35:57,816 --> 00:36:01,372
Have you always been Foxy, Foxy?

669
00:36:02,217 --> 00:36:04,155
I'm not sure what you mean.

670
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:08,148
All my life...

671
00:36:09,343 --> 00:36:13,124
I felt like there was
someone inside of me,

672
00:36:13,394 --> 00:36:16,096
someone stronger and...

673
00:36:16,262 --> 00:36:18,262
and smarter.

674
00:36:19,033 --> 00:36:20,734
Someone that people would fear.

675
00:36:20,802 --> 00:36:22,136
No one else saw that.

676
00:36:22,203 --> 00:36:23,637
Except Penguin?

677
00:36:26,756 --> 00:36:29,209
- Except Oswald.
- So, why did you kill him?

678
00:36:29,482 --> 00:36:32,092
Because Oswald killed the woman I loved.

679
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:36,683
And with Oswald gone, is that
the role I'm meant to fill?

680
00:36:37,044 --> 00:36:39,661
- To be your reflection?
- No.

681
00:36:39,954 --> 00:36:42,356
Because I know who I am.

682
00:36:42,903 --> 00:36:46,160
I know how to be him.

683
00:36:49,612 --> 00:36:51,604
And you helped that.

684
00:36:51,733 --> 00:36:52,933
So thank you.

685
00:36:53,556 --> 00:36:54,789
Ed.

686
00:36:58,873 --> 00:37:00,807
You killed six people.

687
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:03,645
- Mm-hmm.
- Seven, including Penguin.

688
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:07,772
You just announced to the entire city
that you are a villain and a murderer.

689
00:37:08,258 --> 00:37:09,583
Mm-hmm.

690
00:37:09,993 --> 00:37:11,009
Ed,

691
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:14,762
if there is any part of
your mind that is not insane,

692
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:16,657
listen to me.

693
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,027
You need help.

694
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,434
Turn yourself in.

695
00:37:25,867 --> 00:37:27,854
My actions seem...

696
00:37:29,018 --> 00:37:30,761
mad to you?

697
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,229
To anyone.

698
00:37:36,878 --> 00:37:38,134
I...

699
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:43,744
I just...

700
00:37:44,408 --> 00:37:47,321
killed the best friend
that I have ever had.

701
00:37:49,947 --> 00:37:53,527
My search for a teacher or an enemy...

702
00:37:56,517 --> 00:37:58,865
...that was just me trying to hold
onto him for a little bit longer.

703
00:37:59,663 --> 00:38:02,272
But now I know who I am...

704
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:05,739
without him.

705
00:38:05,913 --> 00:38:07,341
So, who are you now?

706
00:38:08,448 --> 00:38:10,433
Oh, come on, Foxy.

707
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:15,847
I'm the Riddler.

708
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:44,265
I've always loved the view from here.

709
00:38:44,695 --> 00:38:47,614
Not really a fan. You understand why.

710
00:38:52,162 --> 00:38:54,933
I want you to know that our friendship
meant something to me.

711
00:38:57,222 --> 00:39:00,627
I cared about you, and I miss you.

712
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:05,489
Gee, almost makes up for being dead.

713
00:39:05,622 --> 00:39:09,283
You do know the entire
GCPD is hunting you?

714
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:10,908
Yes.

715
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,896
Well, not to burst your bubble,

716
00:39:13,967 --> 00:39:17,646
but wanted or not,
no one is going to be afraid of

717
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,545
the Riddler.

718
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,550
Maybe not yet, but they will be.

719
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:02,342
Good-bye, Oswald.

720
00:40:23,945 --> 00:40:25,445
Well...

721
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,310
look who's alive.

722
00:40:31,115 --> 00:40:32,425
Who are you?

723
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:34,354
Ivy Pepper. Are you stupid?

724
00:40:36,924 --> 00:40:38,592
Do we know each other?

725
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,429
I pulled you out of the river.

726
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:42,937
Been nursing you for weeks.

727
00:40:43,195 --> 00:40:44,564
So boring.

728
00:40:44,632 --> 00:40:46,066
You sleep a lot.

729
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,539
You look strange,
like you're gonna puke.

730
00:40:52,607 --> 00:40:54,272
Are you okay?

731
00:41:01,337 --> 00:41:02,993
I just remembered...

732
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:06,026
there's someone I need to kill.

733
00:41:16,411 --> 00:41:17,864
Uncle Frank?

734
00:41:43,089 --> 00:41:45,839
- How did he take it?
- His interest is piqued,

735
00:41:46,175 --> 00:41:48,220
but convincing him will take some time.

736
00:41:48,267 --> 00:41:50,314
We don't have time.

737
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,228
I won't let you down, Kathryn.

738
00:41:53,306 --> 00:41:55,642
I assume things went
smoothly on your end?

739
00:41:55,869 --> 00:41:57,971
The clone is in place.

740
00:41:59,203 --> 00:42:01,004
What about Bruce Wayne?

741
00:42:03,061 --> 00:42:05,746
He should be waking up as we speak.
