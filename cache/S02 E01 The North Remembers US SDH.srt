SHUT THE GATES
TO THE PEASANTS.

102
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,978

QUITE RIGHT--
YOU DID NOTHING

129

WHEN YOUR SON CALLED
FOR NED STARK'S HEAD.

130
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,237
NOW THE ENTIRE NORTH
HAS RISEN UP AGAINST US.

- DID YOU? YOU FAILED.

132
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,784
THAT BIT OF THEATER
WILL HAUNT OUR FAMILY
FOR A GENERATION.

- WHO'S WON EVERY BATTLE
HE'S FOUGHT.

DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WE'RE LOSING THE WAR?

135
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,460
- WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT WARFARE?
- NOTHING.

136
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:06,337
BUT I KNOW PEOPLE.

137
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,297
AND I KNOW THAT
OUR ENEMIES HATE
EACH OTHER

138
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,425
ALMOST AS MUCH
AS THEY HATE US.

139
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,266

- JOFFREY IS KING.

140

YOU ARE HERE
TO ADVISE HIM.

141
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,562
I'M ONLY HERE
TO ADVISE HIM.

142
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,273
AND IF THE KING LISTENS
TO WHAT I SAY,

143
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,859
THE KING MIGHT JUST GET
HIS UNCLE JAIME BACK.

144
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,196
HOW?

145
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,656
YOU LOVE YOUR CHILDREN.

146
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,116
IT'S YOUR ONE
REDEEMING QUALITY.

147
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:38,244
THAT AND YOUR CHEEKBONES.

TWO OF THEM.
- ONE.

150
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,087
- ONE?
- ARYA, LITTLE ANIMAL--
SHE DISAPPEARED.

151
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,173
DISAPPEARED?
WHAT, IN A PUFF OF SMOKE?

152
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,387
WE HAD THREE STARKS
TO TRADE.

153
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,140
YOU CHOPPED ONE'S HEAD OFF
AND LET ANOTHER ESCAPE.

154
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,143
FATHER WILL BE FURIOUS.

155
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,729
IT MUST BE ODD FOR YOU...

156
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,483
TO BE THE DISAPPOINTING CHILD.

<i>FORBID IT RAINS.</i>

171
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,535
WHY, I MIGHT AS WELL SLEEP
BENEATH A WATERFALL.

172
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,329
Luwin:
<i>MAINTENANCE OF A HOLDFAST</i>

173
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,749
GENERALLY FALLS
TO THE LORD OF
THAT HOLDFAST.

174
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,250
GENERALLY, YES,

175
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,919
BUT I'VE SENT
ALL THE YOUNG MEN OFF

176
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,837
TO FIGHT
ROBB STARK'S WAR.

177
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,091
KING ROBB.
AND IT'S NOT HIS WAR.

178
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,967
HE DIDN'T CHOOSE IT.

179
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,469
MAYBE NOT, MY LORD,

180
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,429
BUT HE CALLED IN HIS BANNERS
AND TOOK THE MEN.

181
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,223
Bran:
<i>JOFFREY KILLED MY FATHER,</i>

182
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,725
YOUR LIEGE LORD.

183
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,144
DO YOU REMEMBER
YOUR VOWS, SER?

184
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,188
OF COURSE I REMEMBER!

185
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,274
WE CAN SPARE FOUR MASONS
FOR A WEEK, MY LORD.

186
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,236
WILL THAT BE SUFFICIENT
TO REPAIR YOUR WALLS?

187
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,571
I-- I BELIEVE IT WILL.

188
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,663
WE DIDN'T WANT HIM HERE
ALL DAY, DID WE?

189
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,959
I DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT ROBB.

190
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,836
NOR DID I.

191
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,841
BUT LISTENING TO PEOPLE
YOU'D RATHER NOT LISTEN TO

192
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:01,095
IS ONE OF YOUR
RESPONSIBILITIES
AS LORD OF WINTERFELL.

193
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,013
( sighs )

194
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,976
Luwin:
<i>LORD PORTAN.</i>

195
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,937
<i>MY LORD, MAY THE OLD GODS</i>
<i>WATCH OVER YOUR BROTHER</i>

196
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,689
<i>AND ALL OUR NORTHERN SONS.</i>

197
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:15,067
<i>( heavy breathing )</i>

198
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,660
-<i> ( wings flapping )</i>
<i>- ( bird squawking )</i>

199
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,658
BOIL THIS FOR AN HOUR
AND DRINK THE TEA.

200
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,119
MAKES ALL YOUR PAIN
GO AWAY.

201
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,997
Bran:
DON'T HAVE ANY PAIN.

202
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,665
LUCKY FOR YOU.

203
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,543
THAT WAY.

204
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,131
YOU'VE BEEN HAVING
THOSE DREAMS AGAIN.

205
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,050
Bran:
<i>I DON'T DREAM.</i>

206
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,801
EVERYONE DREAMS.

207
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,554
I DON'T.

208
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,765
HEARD SOME OF THE MEN
TALKING ABOUT THE COMET.

209
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,850
<i>THEY SAY IT'S AN OMEN.</i>

210
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:33,729
THEY SAY IT MEANS ROBB
WILL WIN A GREAT VICTORY
IN THE SOUTH.

211
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,356
DID THEY?

212
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,611
Osha:
I HEARD SOME OTHER FOOLS
SAY IT'S LANNISTER RED.

213
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:44,031
MEANS THE LANNISTERS
WILL RULE ALL SEVEN
KINGDOMS BEFORE LONG.

214
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,326
HEARD A STABLEBOY SAY
IT'S THE COLOR OF BLOOD

215
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,828
TO MARK THE DEATH
OF YOUR FATHER.

216
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,919
THE STARS
DON'T FALL FOR MEN.

217
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,421
THE RED COMET MEANS
ONE THING, BOY--

218
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,633
DRAGONS.

219
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:07,096
THE DRAGONS ARE ALL DEAD.

220
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,723
THEY'VE BEEN DEAD
FOR CENTURIES.

221
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,341
( shrieks )

222
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,511
MMM.

223
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,347
MMM. MMM.

224
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,144
WHAT DID YOUR BROTHER SAY
ABOUT THEM, KHALEESI?

225
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,937
HE SAID THEY ATE MEAT.

226
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,566
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU
WHAT KIND OF MEAT?

227
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,569
MY BROTHER DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT DRAGONS.

228
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,780
HE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ANYTHING.

229
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,371
EH.

230
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:19,209
( whinnies )

231
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,796
<i>( women murmuring )</i>

232
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,733
SHE WAS DROGO'S
FIRST GIFT TO ME.

233
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,653
I REMEMBER.

234
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,741
I PROMISED
TO PROTECT THEM.

235
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,077
PROMISED THEM
THEIR ENEMIES WOULD
DIE SCREAMING.

236
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,037
HOW DO I MAKE
STARVATION SCREAM?

237
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,082
A TRICK I NEVER LEARNED,
I'M AFRAID.

238
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,211
DOES IT EVER END?

239
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,088
THIS IS FARTHER EAST
THAN I'VE EVER BEEN.

240
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,714
BUT, YES, KHALEESI,

241
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,341
EVERYTHING ENDS,
EVEN THE RED WASTE.

242
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,802
AND YOU'RE SURE
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY?

243
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,471
IF WE GO SOUTH TO THE LAND
OF THE LAZARHEEN,

244
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,182
THE LAMB MEN WILL KILL US
AND TAKE YOUR DRAGONS.

245
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,892
IF WE GO WEST
TO THE DOTHRAKI SEA,

246
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:19,186
THE FIRST
KHALASAR WE MEET

247
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,688
WILL KILL US
AND TAKE YOUR DRAGONS.

248
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:24,149
NO ONE WILL TAKE
MY DRAGONS.

249
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,860
THEY ARE TOO WEAK TO FIGHT,

250
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,821
AS ARE YOUR PEOPLE.

251
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,240
YOU MUST BE
THEIR STRENGTH.

252
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,326
AS YOU ARE MINE.

253
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,833

254
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,216

RAKHARO...

257
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,886
YOU NEVER HAVE.

258
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:42,644
THIS IS BAD TIME TO START.

259
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,577
<i>( horse whinnies )</i>

260
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,103

<i>( bird caws )</i>

263
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,869
HAVING A ROUGH TIME OF IT?

264
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,663
NOTHING'S KILLED ME YET.

265
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,873
- Grenn: YOUR ASS
KILLED THE SLEDGE.
- YOU OFFERED ME A RIDE.

266
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:48,335
I JUST WANTED
YOU TO SHUT UP ABOUT
YOUR DAMN BLISTERS.

267
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,560
I WAS BORN IN A PLACE
LIKE THIS.

268
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,729
LATER, I FELL
ON HARD TIMES.

269
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,191
Samwell:
<i>ARE THOSE GIRLS?</i>

270
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,985
Dolorous Edd:
<i>CRASTER'S DAUGHTERS.</i>

271
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:16,905
I HAVEN'T SEEN A GIRL
IN SIX MONTHS.

272
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,949
I'D KEEP ON
NOT SEEING THEM
IF I WERE YOU.

273
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:22,202
WHAT, HE DON'T
LIKE PEOPLE MESSING
WITH HIS DAUGHTERS?

274
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,247
HE DON'T LIKE PEOPLE
MESSING WITH HIS WIVES.

275
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,585
HE MARRIES
HIS DAUGHTERS,

276
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,920
<i>AND THEY GIVE HIM</i>
<i>MORE DAUGHTERS.</i>

277
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,131
AND ON AND ON IT GOES.

278
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,592
- THAT'S FOUL.
- IT'S BEYOND FOUL.

279
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,470
ALL THE OTHER WILDLINGS
FOR A HUNDRED LEAGUES
HAVE DISAPPEARED.

280
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,681
CRASTER'S STILL HERE.

281
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:46,101
HE MUST BE DOING
SOMETHING RIGHT.

282
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:47,936
WHAT HAPPENS
TO THE BOYS?

283
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,106
- HMM?
-<i> HE MARRIES HIS DAUGHTERS.</i>

284
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:53,984
WHAT DOES HE DO
WITH HIS SONS?

285
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,323
HE SAID HE PLANNED
TO STOP HERE

286
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,866
ON HIS WAY
TO THE FROSTFANGS.

287
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,618
PEOPLE MAKE
ALL SORTS OF PLANS.

288
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,038
I HAVEN'T
SEEN BENJEN STARK
IN THREE YEARS.

289
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,414
HAVEN'T MISSED HIM.

290
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,834
ALWAYS TREATED ME
LIKE SCUM.

291
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,337
HAVEN'T HAD ANY GOOD WINE
FOR A LONG TIME.

292
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,590
YOU SOUTHERNERS
MAKE GOOD WINE,
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT.

293
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,467
WE'RE NOT SOUTHERNERS.

294
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,302
WHO'S THIS LITTLE GIRL?

295
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,806
YOU'RE PRETTIER
THAN HALF MY DAUGHTERS.

296
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,143
YOU GOT A NICE WET TWAT
BETWEEN YOUR LEGS?

297
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:29,770
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

298
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,855
- JON SNOW.
- SNOW, EH?

299
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,733
LISTEN TO ME, BASTARD.

300
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:38,779
ALL YOU LOT
FROM SOUTH OF THE WALL,
YOU'RE SOUTHERNERS.

301
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:42,616
BUT NOW YOU'RE
IN THE NORTH,
THE REAL NORTH.

302
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,284
THE LAD MEANT NO HARM.

303
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:49,122
I CATCH THAT
PRETTY LITTLE BASTARD
TALKING TO MY DAUGHTERS--

304
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:53,168
NO ONE WILL TALK
TO YOUR DAUGHTERS,
YOU HAVE MY WORD.

305
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:56,630
NOW, SIT DOWN
AND SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

306
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,885
YOU BRING ANY OF THAT
GOOD WINE WITH YOU?

307
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,845
WE DID.

308
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,348
WE PASSED THROUGH
SIX VILLAGES ON THE WAY HERE.

309
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,350
ALL SIX WERE ABANDONED.

310
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,269
WHERE HAVE ALL
THE WILDLINGS GONE?

311
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,815
I COULD TELL YOU,
BUT I'M THIRSTY.

312
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,025
Mormont:
<i>THERE'S A BARREL OF</i>
<i>DORNISH WINE ON THE SLEDGE.</i>

313
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,778
-<i> BRING IT IN HERE.</i>
<i>- Man: YES, COMMANDER.</i>

314
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:23,073
Craster:
<i>YOU WANT TO KNOW</i>
<i>WHERE THEY'VE ALL GONE?</i>

315
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:27,494
<i>NORTH... TO JOIN UP</i>
<i>WITH MANCE RAYDER...</i>

316
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,205
YOUR OLD FRIEND.

317
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:32,874
HE'S NO FRIEND OF MINE.

318
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:37,295
- HE BROKE HIS VOWS,
BETRAYED HIS BROTHERS.
- OH, AYE.

319
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,424
BUT ONCE HE WAS
JUST A POOR BLACK CROW.

320
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,385
AND NOW HE'S
KING-BEYOND-THE-WALL.

321
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,013
HE'S BEEN CALLING
HIMSELF THAT FOR YEARS.

322
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:49,725
WHAT'S HE KING OF?
A FROZEN LAKE SOMEWHERE?

323
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,769
THAT'S A GOOD-LOOKING AXE.

324
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,105
<i>FRESH FORGED?</i>

325
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,735
GIVE IT HERE.

326
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,945
YOU'LL HAVE ANOTHER ONE
MADE AT CASTLE BLACK.

327
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,989
HERE.

328
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,784
OH, THAT'S SOME
LOVELY STEEL.

329
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:14,458
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT MANCE RAYDER IS DOING?

330
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,168
GATHERING AN ARMY.

331
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,462
<i>WHAT I HEAR,</i>
<i>HE'S ALREADY GOT MORE MEN</i>

332
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,922
<i>THAN ANY OF YOUR</i>
<i>SOUTHERN KINGS.</i>

333
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,341
AND WHERE DOES HE PLAN
MARCHING THIS ARMY?

334
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,968
WHEN YOU'RE
ALL THE WAY NORTH,

335
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,678
THERE'S ONLY
ONE DIRECTION TO GO.

336
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:33,477
THESE ARE BAD TIMES TO BE
LIVING ALONE IN THE WILD.

337
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,855
THE COLD WINDS
ARE RISING.

338
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:40,275
LET THEM COME.
MY ROOTS ARE SUNK DEEP.

339
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,945
WIFE...

340
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,866
TELL THE LORD CROW
HOW CONTENT WE ARE.

341
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,327
THIS IS OUR PLACE.

342
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,162
OUR HUSBAND KEEPS US SAFE.

343
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:55,415
BETTER TO LIVE FREE
THAN DIE A SLAVE.

344
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:01,463
Craster:
<i>DON'T IT MAKE YOU</i>
<i>JEALOUS, OLD MAN,</i>

345
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,673
TO SEE ME WITH
ALL THESE YOUNG WIVES

346
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:06,843
AND YOU WITH NO ONE
TO WARM YOUR BED?

347
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,887
WE CHOSE DIFFERENT PATHS.

348
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,766
OH, AYE, AND YOU
CHOSE THE PATH WITH
NO ONE BUT BOYS ON IT.

349
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:17,687
YOU'LL BE WANTING TO SLEEP
BENEATH MY ROOF, I SUPPOSE,

350
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,815
AND EAT ME OUT OF PIGS.

351
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,733
A ROOF WOULD BE WELCOME.

352
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,318
IT'S BEEN HARD RIDING.

353
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:26,404
WE'VE BROUGHT OUR OWN FOOD
AND GOOD STEEL FOR YOU.

354
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,660
ANY MAN LAYS A HAND
ON ONE OF MY WIVES,

355
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,830
HE LOSES THE HAND.

356
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:40,377
AND I SEE THIS ONE
STARING TOO LONG,

357
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,547
I MIGHT JUST GOUGE
HIS EYES OUT.

358
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:47,092
YOUR ROOF, YOUR RULES.

359
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,688

360
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,065
WHO AM I?!

361
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,610
- WHO AM I?!
- LORD COMMANDER.

362
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,655
- AND WHO ARE YOU?
- JON SNOW.

363
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,283

364
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,618
YOUR STEWARD.

365

YOU WANT TO LEAD
ONE DAY?

366
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,585

HOW TO FOLLOW.

369
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,485
WE OFFER YOU
THESE FALSE GODS.

370
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,488
TAKE THEM AND CAST
YOUR LIGHT UPON US...

371
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:56,119
FOR THE NIGHT IS DARK

372
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,623

FOR THE NIGHT IS DARK
AND FULL OF TERRORS.

373
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,543
Melisandre:

374
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,504
<i>DARKNESS WILL FALL HEAVY</i>

375

THE STARS WILL BLEED.

376
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,676
WE NEED TO STOP HER.

377
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,430
Melisandre:
<i>THE COLD BREATH OF WINTER</i>
<i>WILL FREEZE THE SEAS...</i>

378
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:20,060
- NOT NOW.
-<i> ...AND THE DEAD SHALL RISE</i>
<i>IN THE NORTH.</i>

379
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:25,065
ALL YOU MEN WERE NAMED

380
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:28,360
<i>IS THIS HOW YOU TREAT</i>
<i>THE GODS OF YOUR FATHERS?</i>

381
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:33,031
ARE YOU SO EAGER TO SPIT
ON YOUR ANCESTORS?

382
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,542
YOU SMELL OF FEAR--

383
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:48,838
FEAR AND PISS
AND OLD BONES.

384
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,758
DO YOU WANT TO STOP ME?

385
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,139
STOP ME.

386
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,320
IN THE ANCIENT BOOKS,
IT'S WRITTEN

387
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:17,325
THAT A WARRIOR WILL DRAW
A BURNING SWORD FROM THE FIRE.

388
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,453
AND THAT SWORD SHALL BE
LIGHTBRINGER.

389
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:29,045
STANNIS BARATHEON,

390
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,506
WARRIOR OF LIGHT,

391
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,591
YOUR SWORD AWAITS YOU.

395

AND FULL OF TERROR.

396
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:49,000
THIS WOMAN WILL LEAD HIM
INTO A WAR HE CANNOT WIN.

397
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,543
STANNIS IS OUR KING.

398
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,253
WE FOLLOW
WHERE HE LEADS,

399
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,631
- EVEN IF WE DON'T
LIKE THE PATH.
- KING.

400
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,841
SINCE THAT BOAR
KILLED HIS BROTHER,

401
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,843
EVERY LORD WANTS
A CORONATION.

402
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,179
I DON'T SERVE THE OTHERS.
I SERVE STANNIS.

403
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,849
AS DO I,
BUT LOYAL SERVICE

404
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,769
MEANS TELLING
HARD TRUTHS.

405
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,981
HE'S SURROUNDED
BY FOOLS AND FANATICS,

406
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,651
BUT HE TRUSTS YOU, DAVOS.

407
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:18,071
IF YOU TELL HIM
THE TRUTH...

408
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,449
WHAT'S THE TRUTH?

409
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,755

HE DIDN'T LOVE ME.

A HARMLESS COURTESY,
YOUR GRACE.

414
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,223

I'LL NOT MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKE.

LET NO MAN CLAIM IGNORANCE
AS AN EXCUSE.

I'LL NOT MAKE PEACE

DECLARED FOR HIM--

MACE TYRELL,
RANDYLL TARLY.

441
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:54,042
STANNIS DOES NOT
NEED TO BEG THIS LORD

GOT IN HIS FLEET?

444

00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,584
DON'T.

458
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:41,381

HAVE YOU GROWN
FOND OF ME, STARK?

470
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,943
IS THAT IT?

471
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,987
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU

472
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,658
IF I LEFT YOU WITH
ONE OF MY BANNERMEN,

473
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,702
YOUR FATHER WOULD KNOW
WITHIN A FORTNIGHT

474
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:38,247
AND MY BANNERMAN WOULD RECEIVE
A RAVEN WITH A MESSAGE:

TO ALL THE HIGH LORDS
OF WESTEROS.

492
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:41,894
KING JOFFREY BARATHEON

HOW CONVENIENT FOR HIM.

497
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:55,825
MY FATHER LEARNED
THE TRUTH.

498
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,618
THAT'S WHY
YOU HAD HIM EXECUTED.

499
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,787
I WAS YOUR PRISONER
WHEN NED STARK LOST HIS HEAD.

500
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,123
YOUR SON KILLED HIM

501
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,916
SO THE WORLD WOULDN'T
LEARN WHO FATHERED HIM.

502
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,628
AND YOU-- YOU PUSHED
MY BROTHER FROM A WINDOW

00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,630
BECAUSE HE SAW YOU
WITH THE QUEEN.

504
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,092
( snarling )

505
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,430
YOU HAVE PROOF?

506
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,849
OR DO YOU WANT TO TRADE GOSSIP
LIKE A COUPLE OF FISHWIVES?

507
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,310
I'M SENDING
ONE OF YOUR COUSINS
DOWN TO KING'S LANDING

508
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,978
WITH MY PEACE TERMS.

509
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:26,856
YOU THINK MY FATHER'S GOING
TO NEGOTIATE WITH YOU?

510
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,442
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM
VERY WELL.

511
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:33,821
NO, BUT HE'S STARTING
TO KNOW ME.

512
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,492
<i>THREE VICTORIES</i>
<i>DON'T MAKE YOU</i>
<i>A CONQUEROR.</i>

513
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,704
IT'S BETTER THAN
THREE DEFEATS.

514
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,545
( snarling )

515
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,485
Shae:
<i>THIS CITY STINKS...</i>

516
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,904
( sniffs )

517
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,364
LIKE DEAD BODIES.

518
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,616
Tyrion:
<i>A BIT CORPSEY, YES.</i>

519
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:21,077
AND SHIT.

520
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,995
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO COME HERE.

521
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,001
I LOVE IT.

522
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:32,672
YOU LOVE THE SMELL
OF DEAD BODIES AND SHIT?

523
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:35,716
AND CUM AND GARLIC
AND RUM.

524
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,928
YOU CAN SMELL CUM
FROM THE BALCONY?

525
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:42,390
I LOVE THE STINK.
I LOVE THE NOISE.

526
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,642
CITIES MAKE ME
WANT TO FUCK.

527
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,979
AND SO DID THE COUNTRY.

528
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,898
( sighs )

529
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,525
THIS IS WHERE I BELONG.

530
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,403
YES, WELL, YOU NEED
TO BE CAREFUL.

531
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,988
NO ONE CAN KNOW
YOU'RE HERE.

532
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,739
NO ONE WILL KNOW.

533
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,283
YOU CAN'T TRUST ANYONE
IN KING'S LANDING.

534
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,661
<i>THEY'RE ALL LIARS--</i>
<i>GOOD LIARS, BAD LIARS,</i>

535
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:06,038
ONE OR TWO GREAT LIARS.

536
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,915
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

537
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,585
ME? I'M NOT FROM HERE.
I'M A SLAVE TO THE TRUTH.

538
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,462
( laughs )
TRUTH?

539
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,256
( laughs )

540
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,593
YOU ARE THE BIGGEST
LITTLE LIAR I HAVE
EVER MET.

541
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,511
WHY DO YOU THINK
I AM SO LITTLE?

542
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:25,057
I'M BEING CRUSHED
BENEATH THE WEIGHT
OF ALL THAT TRUTH.

543
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,270
OH!

544
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,981
NED STARK ACTUALLY
SLEPT ON THIS.

545
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:37,278
AS IF THE POOR MAN
DIDN'T SUFFER ENOUGH.

546
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,781
ONE OF THE MANY CHANGES
WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE
AROUND HERE.

547
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,546
- LORD BAELISH.
- YOUR GRACE.

548
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,132
I WONDER IF I MIGHT
ASK YOU FOR A FAVOR.

549
00:36:58,215 --> 00:36:59,717
OF COURSE,
YOUR GRACE.

550
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,510
NED STARK'S YOUNGEST
DAUGHTER ARYA--

551
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,804
WE CAN'T SEEM
TO LOCATE HER.

552
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,474
IF SHE'S ESCAPED
THE CAPITAL,

553
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,476
WINTERFELL SEEMS
THE LOGICAL DESTINATION.

554
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,187
AND YET MY FRIENDS
IN THE NORTH REPORT
NO SIGN OF HER.

555
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,980
CURIOUS.

556
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,232
IF WE CHOOSE
TO NEGOTIATE
WITH THE STARKS,

557
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,485
THE GIRL HAS SOME VALUE.
WHOEVER FINDS HER--

558
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,071
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT
LANNISTERS AND DEBTS.

559
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,156
WELL, YOU COULD ASK
VARYS WHERE SHE IS.

560
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:24,367
HE'LL HAVE
AN ANSWER FOR YOU.

561
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,035
WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IT...

562
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:29,830
MYSELF, I HAVE ALWAYS HAD
A HARD TIME TRUSTING EUNUCHS.

563
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,583
- WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY WANT?
- ( chuckles )

564
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,795
A MOCKINGBIRD.

565
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:39,298
- YOU CREATED YOUR
OWN SIGIL, DIDN'T YOU?
- YES.

566
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,509
APPROPRIATE...
FOR A SELF-MADE MAN

567
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,511
WITH SO MANY
SONGS TO SING.

568
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,012
I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

569
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,931
SOME PEOPLE ARE
FORTUNATE ENOUGH

570
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,516
TO BE BORN INTO
THE RIGHT FAMILY.

571
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,352
OTHERS HAVE TO FIND
THEIR OWN WAY.

572
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,647
I HEARD A SONG ONCE

573
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,316
ABOUT A BOY
OF MODEST MEANS

574
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,278
WHO FOUND HIS WAY
INTO THE HOME OF A VERY
PROMINENT FAMILY.

575
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,989
HE LOVED
THE ELDEST DAUGHTER.

576
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:06,534
SADLY, SHE HAD EYES
FOR ANOTHER.

577
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,828
WHEN BOYS AND GIRLS
LIVE IN THE SAME HOME,

578
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,580
AWKWARD SITUATIONS
CAN ARISE.

579
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,250
SOMETIMES, I'VE HEARD,
EVEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS

580
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,836
DEVELOP
CERTAIN AFFECTIONS.

581
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:19,213
AND WHEN THESE AFFECTIONS
BECOME COMMON KNOWLEDGE,

582
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:23,134
WELL, THAT IS AN AWKWARD
SITUATION INDEED,

583
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,469
ESPECIALLY
IN A PROMINENT FAMILY.

584
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,973
BUT PROMINENT FAMILIES
OFTEN FORGET A SIMPLE TRUTH,

585
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:31,225
I'VE FOUND.

586
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:33,519
AND WHICH TRUTH IS THAT?

587
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:36,981
KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.

588
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,694
SEIZE HIM.

589
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,865
CUT HIS THROAT.

590
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,367
STOP. WAIT.

591
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,870
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.
LET HIM GO.

592
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:55,791
STEP BACK THREE PACES.

593
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,087
TURN AROUND.

594
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,922
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

595
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:09,430
POWER IS POWER.

596
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:13,142
DO SEE IF YOU CAN
TAKE SOME TIME AWAY FROM
YOUR COINS AND YOUR WHORES

597
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,144
TO LOCATE
THE STARK GIRL FOR ME.

598
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:18,606
I WOULD VERY MUCH
APPRECIATE IT.

599
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,285
Robb:
<i>YOU'RE SER ALTON LANNISTER?</i>

600
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:33,871
I AM, YOUR GRACE.

601
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:37,333
<i>I OFFER YOUR COUSINS PEACE</i>
<i>IF THEY MEET MY TERMS.</i>

602
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:41,754
FIRST, YOUR FAMILY
MUST RELEASE MY SISTERS.

603
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:45,382
SECOND, MY FATHER'S BONES
MUST BE RETURNED TO US

604
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,384
SO HE MAY REST BESIDE
HIS BROTHER AND SISTER

605
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:50,054
IN THE CRYPTS
BENEATH WINTERFELL.

606
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,473
AND THE REMAINS OF ALL THOSE
WHO DIED IN HIS SERVICE

607
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,558
MUST ALSO BE RETURNED.

608
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,936
THEIR FAMILIES CAN HONOR
THEM WITH PROPER FUNERALS.

609
00:39:57,019 --> 00:40:00,189
- AN HONORABLE REQUEST,
YOUR GRACE.
-<i> THIRD...</i>

610
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,984
JOFFREY AND THE QUEEN REGENT
MUST RENOUNCE ALL CLAIM

611
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,487
TO DOMINION OF THE NORTH.

612
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,739
FROM THIS TIME
TILL THE END OF TIME,

613
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,325
WE ARE A FREE
AND INDEPENDENT KINGDOM.

614
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:13,244
THE KING IN THE NORTH.

615
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,830
All:
KING IN THE NORTH.

616
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,373
NEITHER JOFFREY
NOR ANY OF HIS MEN

617
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,708
SHALL SET FOOT
IN OUR LANDS AGAIN.

618
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,544
IF HE DISREGARDS
THIS COMMAND,

619
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:25,214
HE SHALL SUFFER
THE SAME FATE
AS MY FATHER,

620
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:29,468
ONLY I DON'T NEED A SERVANT
TO DO MY BEHEADING FOR ME.

621
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:33,013
THESE ARE-- YOUR GRACE,
THESE ARE--

622
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,683
THESE ARE MY TERMS.

623
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,978
IF THE QUEEN REGENT
AND HER SON MEET THEM,
I'LL GIVE THEM PEACE.

624
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,772
IF NOT...

625
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,358
I WILL LITTER THE SOUTH
WITH LANNISTER DEAD.

626
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,194
KING JOFFREY
IS A BARATHEON,
YOUR GRACE.

627
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,113
OH, IS HE?

628
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,826
YOU'LL RIDE
AT DAYBREAK,
SER ALTON.

629
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,579
THAT WILL BE ALL
FOR TONIGHT.

630
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,805
A WORD, YOUR GRACE?

631
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,558
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
CALL ME "YOUR GRACE"
WHEN NO ONE'S AROUND.

632
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,269
IT'S NOT SO BAD
ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT.

633
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,313
I'M GLAD SOMEONE'S
GOTTEN USED TO IT.

634
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,691
THE LANNISTERS
ARE GOING TO REJECT
YOUR TERMS, YOU KNOW?

635
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,568
OF COURSE THEY ARE.

636
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,612
WE CAN FIGHT THEM
IN THE FIELDS AS LONG
AS YOU LIKE,

637
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:33,616
BUT WE WON'T
BEAT THEM UNTIL YOU
TAKE KING'S LANDING.

638
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,245
AND WE CAN'T TAKE
KING'S LANDING
WITHOUT SHIPS.

639
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,040
MY FATHER HAS SHIPS
AND MEN WHO KNOW HOW
TO SAIL THEM.

640
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,666
MEN WHO FOUGHT
MY FATHER.

641
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,169
MEN WHO FOUGHT KING ROBERT
TO FREE THEMSELVES

642
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:49,048
FROM THE YOKE OF THE SOUTH,
JUST LIKE YOU'RE DOING NOW.

643
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,385
I'M HIS ONLY LIVING SON.

644
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,555
HE'LL LISTEN TO ME.
I KNOW HE WILL.

645
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,436
I'M NOT A STARK.
I KNOW THAT.

646
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:05,481
BUT YOUR FATHER RAISED ME
TO BE AN HONORABLE MAN.

647
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:10,736
WE CAN AVENGE HIM
TOGETHER.

648
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:13,781
YOU DON'T WANT
BALON GREYJOY
FOR AN ALLY.

649
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,075
I NEED HIS SHIPS.
THEY SAY HE HAS 200.

650
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:19,662
THEY SAY A MILLION RATS
LIVE IN THE SEWERS
OF KING'S LANDING.

651
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,622
SHALL WE RALLY THEM
TO FIGHT FOR US?

652
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,666
I UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T
TRUST LORD GREYJOY.

653
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:28,254
I DON'T TRUST
LORD GREYJOY BECAUSE
HE IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY.

654
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:30,881
YOUR FATHER
HAD TO GO TO WAR
TO END HIS REBELLION.

655
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:34,885
YES. AND NOW I'M THE ONE
REBELLING AGAINST THE THRONE.

656
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,137
BEFORE ME, IT WAS FATHER.

657
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,806
YOU MARRIED ONE REBEL
AND MOTHERED ANOTHER.

658
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,850
I MOTHERED MORE THAN
JUST REBELS,

659
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,311
A FACT YOU SEEM
TO HAVE FORGOTTEN.

660
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,313
IF I TRADE THE KINGSLAYER
FOR TWO GIRLS,

661
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,691
MY BANNERMEN
WILL STRING ME UP
BY MY FEET.

662
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,819
YOU WANT TO LEAVE SANSA
IN THE QUEEN'S HANDS?

663
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,862
<i>AND ARYA--</i>

664
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,907
I HAVEN'T HEARD
A WORD ABOUT ARYA.

665
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,617
WHAT ARE WE FIGHTING FOR
IF NOT FOR THEM?

666
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,327
IT'S MORE COMPLICATED
THAN THAT!

667
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,705
YOU KNOW IT IS.

668
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,472
IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO GO HOME.

669
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,392
I HAVEN'T SEEN BRAN
OR RICKON IN MONTHS.

670
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,062
YOU CAN'T GO
TO WINTERFELL.

671
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,981
I BEG YOUR PARDON?

672
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:32,067
I'LL SEND RODRIK
TO WATCH OVER THE BOYS

673
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:36,655
BECAUSE TOMORROW
YOU'LL RIDE SOUTH
TO THE STORMLANDS.

674
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,866
WHY IN THE NAME
OF ALL THE GODS--

675
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:42,619
BECAUSE I NEED
YOU TO NEGOTIATE
WITH RENLY BARATHEON.

676
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,830
HE'S RALLIED
AN ARMY OF 100,000.

677
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,790
YOU KNOW HIM.
YOU KNOW HIS FAMILY.

678
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,084
I HAVEN'T SEEN
RENLY BARATHEON
SINCE HE WAS A BOY.

679
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,711
<i>YOU HAVE A HUNDRED</i>
<i>OTHER LORDS--</i>

680
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:54,506
WHICH OF THESE LORDS
DO I TRUST MORE THAN YOU?

681
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,259
IF RENLY SIDES WITH US,

682
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,928
WE'LL OUTNUMBER THEM
TWO TO ONE.

683
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,931
WHEN THEY FEEL
THE JAWS BEGINNING TO SHUT,
THEY'LL SUE FOR PEACE.

684
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,559
WE'LL GET THE GIRLS BACK.

685
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:09,229
THEN WE'LL ALL
GO HOME... FOR GOOD.

686
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,240
( sighs )
I WILL RIDE
AT FIRST LIGHT.

687
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:31,752
WE WILL ALL BE TOGETHER
AGAIN SOON, I PROMISE.

688
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:39,259
YOU'VE DONE SO WELL.

689
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:44,473
YOUR FATHER
WOULD BE... PROUD.

690
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,150
- GIVE LORD RENLY
MY REGARDS.
-<i> KING</i> RENLY.

691
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,279
THERE'S A KING
IN EVERY CORNER NOW.

692
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,909
( hammering )

693
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,795
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

694
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,089
RETURNING THIS ROOM
TO ITS PROPER APPEARANCE.

695
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:20,092
SAY WHAT YOU WILL
ABOUT THE TARGARYENS--
THEY WERE CONQUERORS.

696
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,803
THAT IS A SEAT
FOR A CONQUEROR.

697
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:26,598
IT NEEDS A ROOM TO MATCH IT,
NOT VINES AND FLOWERS.

698
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,976
WE CAN'T FIND ARYA STARK.

699
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,270
WITH LUCK, SHE'S DEAD
IN A DITCH SOMEWHERE.

700
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,188
PERHAPS. BUT IF NOT,
WE NEED HER.

701
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,691
THEY'LL NEVER GIVE
JAIME BACK TO US
FOR SANSA ALONE.

702
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,235
I THINK THEY MIGHT.
THEY'RE WEAK.

703
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,112
THEY PUT TOO MUCH VALUE
ON THEIR WOMEN.

704
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:43,949
WE NEED TO SET OUR ARMIES
TO THE TASK OF FINDING HER.

705
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,784
SEND OUT AS MANY MEN
AS WE CAN.

706
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,578
I'M SURE IF YOU ASKED
GRANDFATHER--

707
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:51,832
THE KING DOES NOT ASK;
HE COMMANDS.

708
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,626
AND MY GRANDFATHER'S
STUPIDITY IN THE FIELD
OF BATTLE

709
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,504
IS THE REASON
ROBB STARK HAS UNCLE JAIME
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

710
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,299
HIS LIFE IS IN DANGER.

711
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:02,009
WE'RE AT WAR.

712
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:05,137
ALL OUR LIVES
ARE IN DANGER.

713
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:11,268
I HEARD A DISGUSTING LIE
ABOUT UNCLE JAIME.

714
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,978
AND YOU.

715
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,606
OUR ENEMIES
WILL SAY ANYTHING

716
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:17,608
TO WEAKEN YOUR CLAIM
TO THE THRONE.

717
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,818
IT'S NOT A CLAIM.
THE THRONE IS MINE.

718
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,322
OF COURSE IT IS.

719
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,867
NO ONE BELIEVES
THIS FOUL GOSSIP.

720
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,244
SOMEONE BELIEVES IT.

721
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,499
FATHER HAD
OTHER CHILDREN?

722
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,959
BESIDES ME AND TOMMEN
AND MYRCELLA?

723
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,005
WHAT ARE YOU ASKING?

724
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:42,591
I'M ASKING IF HE FUCKED
OTHER WOMEN

725
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,218
WHEN HE GREW TIRED
OF YOU.

726
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,928
HOW MANY BASTARDS
DOES HE HAVE RUNNING--

727
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,889
( silence )

728
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:57,022
( work resumes )

729
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:05,531
WHAT YOU JUST DID
IS PUNISHABLE BY DEATH.

730
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,578
YOU WILL NEVER
DO IT AGAIN.

731
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,330
NEVER.

732
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,505
THAT WILL BE ALL,
MOTHER.

733
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,178
( loud moaning )

734
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,430
NO, NO, NO, NO.

735
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,100
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW RIDICULOUS YOU SOUND?

736
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,768
EASE INTO IT.

737
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:37,771
SLOWLY, WITH PASSION.

738
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:41,608
( moaning )
OH, YEAH.

739
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:45,320
( sighs )
GO WASH YOURSELVES.
PUT SOME CLOTHES ON.

740
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,073
BOTH OF YOU
ARE WORKING TONIGHT.

741
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,954
WE DO THINGS
DIFFERENTLY HERE, DAISY.

742
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:58,000
THIS ISN'T SOME
FIVE-COPPER BAWDY HOUSE
IN HAYSEED HALL.

743
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,544
- HAYSTACK HALL.
- WHEREVER YOU'RE FROM.

744
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,629
OUR ESTABLISHMENT
DOESN'T CATER

745
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,257
TO PLOUGHMEN
AND GOAT HERDERS.

746
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,342
LORD OLSEN.

747
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,219
TASTE IS
EVERYTHING HERE.

748
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,096
LITTLEFINGER'S
A FANCY MAN.

749
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,931
DON'T CALL HIM
LITTLEFINGER.

750
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,308
HE DOESN'T LIKE IT.

751
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,768
<i>LORD BAELISH.</i>

752
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,985
SHE PRETENDS SHE DOESN'T
SPEAK THE COMMON TONGUE

753
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,654
SO THAT PEOPLE
WILL THINK SHE'S EXOTIC.

754
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,699
SHE GREW UP
JUST DOWN THE ROAD
IN FLEA BOTTOM.

755
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:33,327
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

756
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,538
SHE'S A DUMB SLUT, REALLY,
BUT A LID FOR EVERY POT.

757
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,332
<i>( armor rattling )</i>

758
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,253
LORD COMMANDER.

759
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,423
GOOD TO SEE YOU...
AGAIN.

760
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:52,804

THIS ESTABLISHMENT

763
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,525
IS OWNED BY
LORD PETYR BAELISH,

764
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,486
THE KING'S
MASTER OF COIN...

765
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:09,488
COIN WHICH GOES
IN MANY POCKETS.

766
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:12,366
- ORDERS.
- WHOSE ORDERS?

767
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,494
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T CARE
WHAT LITTLEFINGER THINKS.

768
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,537

NO, YOU CAN'T.
NO! PLEASE!

772
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:39,226
NO! NOT MY BARRA!

773
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,729
- PLEASE. PLEASE.

GENDRY!
HIS NAME IS GENDRY.

784
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,572
WHERE IS
THE BASTARD?

785
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:36,032
THE NIGHT'S WATCH!
PLEASE, STOP!

787
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:40,454
THEY TOOK HIM
