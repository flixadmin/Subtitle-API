1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,040
He's alive? Alive!

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,680
No.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,800
Boss, what's wrong?

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,080
Gordon didn't kill Penguin
like he was told.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,560
- What?
- Penguin,

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,040
is still alive and working
for Maroni?

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,120
No.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,560
You go find Gordon
and you bring him to me.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,640
Still breathing.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,280
I wanna talk to that son of a bitch.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,800
<i>Hey, guys. Leave a message.</i>

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,400
Barbara, if you're at home,
listen to me.

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,920
I need you to get out right now.

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,160
- I thought we were friends.
- Harvey.

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,000
Shut up! Game's over.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,720
Now I gotta kill you,
take your body back to Falcone

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,080
and beg, beg him for mercy.

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,040
Listen to me. I screwed up.

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,960
But I have a plan
to make things right.

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,480
Don't kill me. Help me.

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,600
You think I'm an idiot?

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
Walk away!

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Walk away.

24
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
Help me.

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,520
We don't have to go out like this.

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,960
You better hope
you never see me again.

27
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,880
Wow. What a place, huh?

28
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,520
A beautiful home...

29
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,200
for a beautiful lady.

30
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,480
Please, tell me what you want.

31
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,480
I guess there's no harm in the truth.

32
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,520
See, your boyfriend was supposed to
kill a certain person for somebody.

33
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,600
Only, he didn't.

34
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,200
And now that somebody is real mad.

35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,360
- Cobblepot.
- What?

36
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,560
He didn't kill Cobblepot.

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,280
There you go!

38
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,640
You're hip.

39
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
You are hip.

40
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,880
That Jim Gordon
is one lucky son of a gun.

41
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,440
What, are you like 100 pounds?

42
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,440
One-ten?

43
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,840
I bet that's your real hair color,
too.

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,000
What are you gonna do to Jim?

45
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,960
You ever been with a criminal?

46
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,760
Some ladies find it a turn-on.

47
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,480
- Jim.
- Hey.

48
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,040
Speak of the devil.

49
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,840
I was getting to know
your lovely lady.

50
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,160
You're trespassing. Get out.

51
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,240
Slow down, hoss.
You're misreading the situation.

52
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,360
I'm the shot-caller here.

53
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,520
The situation is you've been told
to bring me in alive,

54
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,000
or I'd be dead already.

55
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,680
But I'm happy to kill you right here
and now.

56
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,720
Don't be such a hard ass.
Come on, you know the rules.

57
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,960
You play nice. You take your lumps.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Nobody else gets hurt.

59
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,280
Tell your friend to drop the gun
or I'll blow his brains out.

60
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,160
- Oh, my God. Jim.
- It's okay. It's under control.

61
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
Drop your gun.

62
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,200
Okay. Have it your way.

63
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,480
But now, after we kill you,
we're gonna kill blondie, too.

64
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,040
Nice and slow.

65
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,440
We gotta go.

66
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,520
Right now.

67
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
Barbara.

68
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
Barbara.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
- What?
- Listen.

70
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,880
No, no. No.

71
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,800
Just a couple of days
and I'll join you.

72
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,760
There are things I need to do.

73
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,240
Fine. Then if you stay, I stay.

74
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,680
Okay? Because I love you, Jim.

75
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,720
- I cannot leave you.
- I love you, too.

76
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,960
That's why you need to leave.

77
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,160
If I know you're safe,
there's nothing they can do to me.

78
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,120
I'll make things right,
and then I'll come join you.

79
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
And what if you don't?

80
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
Don't come back.

81
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,600
Don't come back to Gotham.

82
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
No, Jim.

83
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,760
- Gordon's here.
- Is he nuts?

84
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
What's he doing?

85
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,880
{\an5}You believe this guy?

86
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,640
{\an5}Hey, Alvarez.

87
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,640
{\an5}You got any of those blank warrants
that Judge Bam Bam signed?

88
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
{\an5}Yeah.

89
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,440
{\an5}This cannot stand.

90
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,520
{\an5}Gordon must die. Bullock must die.

91
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,840
{\an5}Penguin must die today!

92
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,440
{\an5}- And Maroni, too, I suppose?
- If need be.

93
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,280
{\an5}You're overreacting, my dear.
This Penguin's a nobody.

94
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,960
{\an5}You want to start a war over the guy
that carried your umbrella?

95
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,440
{\an5}He was on my hip everywhere with me.

96
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,040
{\an5}He knows things.

97
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Like what?

98
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,840
{\an5}Too much. He knows too much.

99
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,360
{\an5}Go to Maroni and ask him politely
to hand over your little man.

100
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
{\an5}Politely.

101
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,400
If he refuses, we can talk
about stronger measures.

102
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,960
{\an5}Boss, this is weak response.

103
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,200
{\an5}I hate to agree with Fish,
but we need to show strength now.

104
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,200
We need to hit back hard. No talk.

105
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,360
Penguin dead, Gordon dead, done.

106
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,120
{\an5}Relax, Niko. I know what I'm doing.

107
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,080
Where is Gordon? I thought
you were bringing him with you.

108
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,400
{\an5}No. He wouldn't come
without a struggle.

109
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,800
{\an5}Now, I don't know
if he's playing tough or crazy,

110
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,240
but he's at work
like nothing's wrong.

111
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,160
I'll send Victor to fetch him.

112
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,520
No need. My guys can handle him.

113
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
I'll send Victor.

114
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,680
That's a nice handsome bird, huh?

115
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,440
{\an5}I don't know chickens.

116
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,320
Fall back.
The old man is right there.

117
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,960
Screw him. He's done.

118
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,600
Now's the time to strike.

119
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,480
- Not yet.
- Not yet, not yet.

120
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,200
If not now, when? Look at him.

121
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,800
Maroni clan are laughing at us,
and he plays with chickens.

122
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,200
That's what has me worried.

123
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,600
The chickens. He's happy, relaxed,

124
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,520
as if he doesn't have a care
in the world.

125
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,200
That girl of yours
is doing her job then.

126
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,680
No.
She says he hasn't even touched her.

127
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,120
She cooks and she cleans for him.

128
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,960
He likes to watch her do chores.

129
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Weird.

130
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,720
- But if that's his thing...
- No.

131
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,000
He's acting as if he knows
something important

132
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,400
that no one else knows.

133
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,480
What the hell are you doing here?

134
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,560
I work here. It's my shift.
Where else should I be?

135
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,680
How about Alaska?

136
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,240
Arrest warrants? For who?

137
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,600
Mayor Aubrey James, Carmine Falcone,
and their close associates.

138
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,960
On charges of conspiracy
and perversion of justice

139
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,120
in the Wayne murder case.

140
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,240
- Are you insane?
- No.

141
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,960
Maybe a little. Feels good.

142
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,760
They're gonna try and kill me anyway.

143
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,120
Might as well make them pay
a price for it.

144
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,520
You're gonna arrest
the mayor and Don Falcone. How?

145
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,080
My testimony is attached
to the warrants.

146
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,320
That alone is enough
to indict them on a dozen counts.

147
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,920
Sure, if you could execute
the warrants, which you can't.

148
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,360
If the D.A. would prosecute,
which he won't.

149
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,400
There's not a single cop or lawyer
in the city who will help you.

150
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,400
I think there are plenty
of people willing to help me

151
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,040
once they see it's possible
to fight back.

152
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,240
You're dreaming.
Nobody will help you.

153
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,840
I won't help you.

154
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,040
You don't think I want change
just like you do?

155
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,560
I have a family.

156
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
I understand.

157
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
Gordon...

158
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,760
get out of town.

159
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
This is my home.

160
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,040
It was my father's home.

161
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
I'm not leaving.

162
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,240
Hello, everyone.

163
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,800
My name is Victor Zsasz.

164
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,720
I'm sent here personally
by Don Carmine Falcone himself

165
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,240
on a matter of deep concern to him.
So, please be respectful.

166
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,440
I'm here for Jim Gordon.

167
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,600
Only him.

168
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,680
Everybody else, mind your business
and we're cool.

169
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
So where's Jim at?

170
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Thank you.

171
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
Hey, Jim!

172
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,280
Jim.

173
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
Hi, Jim.

174
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,480
Relax.

175
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,960
I'm supposed to take you in alive.

176
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,960
Don Falcone wants to talk.

177
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,560
Tell Falcone we'll talk.

178
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
But not today.

179
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,560
Don't be that way.

180
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,920
"Alive" is a very broad category.

181
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,480
A man with no hands
can still be alive.

182
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,640
There are 50 cops in here.

183
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,080
Try something.

184
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Everybody out.

185
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,840
Please?

186
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,960
Go, boss. Get out of here.

187
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
- Jim...
- Go.

188
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,120
I can handle this.

189
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,600
Well, how now, Jim?

190
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
Jim?

191
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,720
Jim?

192
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,280
Why are you hiding from me, Jim?

193
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,800
Hey!

194
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,240
What the...

195
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
There!

196
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,680
You need a ride?

197
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,920
Go, go, go, go, go!

198
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,160
No, please.

199
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,960
Twenty-eight.

200
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,120
You're back.

201
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,560
How do you feel?

202
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
Terrible.

203
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,520
Where am I? Who are you?

204
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,080
I'm a friend of Montoya and Allen.

205
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,600
I just took two bullets out of you
and sewed you up.

206
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,360
Now, I'm checking to see
how you're doing.

207
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,840
So, who are you?

208
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,160
What city are we in
and what day of the week is it?

209
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,960
I'm James Gordon. We're in Gotham.

210
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,400
It's Friday. Why are there rats?

211
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,320
It's a dissection lab
at the university.

212
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,480
I gather you're a fugitive
from the mob.

213
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,960
Can't go to the hospital,
said Crispus.

214
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,320
It's very exciting, I must say.

215
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,640
- How long have I been out?
- Just a couple of hours or so.

216
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,120
You're very lucky.
No vital organs were...

217
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Lie back down.

218
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,960
Okay? You are hurt.

219
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,000
- Just a week or so in bed...
- I have to go.

220
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,600
James, you have lost a lot of blood.

221
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,760
You have to do as I say
and lie back down.

222
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,000
If you don't, you could die.

223
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,840
I have to stand. Can you help me?

224
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,120
Okay, okay.

225
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Crispus?

226
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,000
He said he's leaving already.

227
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,600
- I have to go. Now.
- Sure.

228
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,320
Some clothes would be good though.

229
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,160
This is about tradition, values.

230
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,320
Snitches get stitches,
that's how it's always been.

231
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,200
You need to hand him over, Sal.

232
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,560
I know. I should.

233
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
But what can I say?

234
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,840
The little guy amuses me.

235
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,160
Don Falcone is going
to be very unhappy.

236
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,560
You want to start a war
over this punk?

237
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,640
War?

238
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,440
- He's that important to you, is he?
- Oh, no.

239
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,400
He means nothing to us.

240
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,960
Respect is what matters here.

241
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,920
Respect I understand.

242
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,880
Penguin. Come on out here.

243
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,120
Don't be scared. She won't bite.

244
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,240
You won't bite him, will you?

245
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Hello, Penguin.

246
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Hello, Ms. Mooney.

247
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,200
Penguin, Ms. Mooney and her boss,

248
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,200
Mr. Falcone, feel disrespected
by you.

249
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,800
Oh, dear. Well, that certainly
has never been my intention.

250
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,520
Well, respect is very important
to them.

251
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,440
Now, I want a sincere apology
from you

252
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,760
for making them feel that way.

253
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,240
Oh, gosh, of course.

254
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,400
If I've, in any way, caused anyone
to feel a lack of respect,

255
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,280
I apologize. Sincerely.

256
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,280
There you go.

257
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,640
Can't say fairer than that.

258
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,280
Bloodshed, then.

259
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,360
I'm glad.

260
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,680
Jolly, fat men are so tiresome.

261
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
And you...

262
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,080
you little scaly-faced bitch.

263
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,720
What I'm gonna do to you.

264
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,320
"Torture" is far too nice of a word.

265
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,960
I'm sorry you feel that way, Fish...

266
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,760
Only my friends call me Fish.

267
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,560
Hey, sisters.

268
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
How's it hanging?

269
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,680
Holy...

270
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,120
Tell your boss Falcone won't let

271
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,720
any of Maroni's trucks
over the bridge.

272
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
Not till he gives up Penguin.

273
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,960
So, listen, you got to get hurt
a little.

274
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,680
You want a beating or a bullet?

275
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,080
Why we got to get hurt?

276
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,320
Because we're sending
a message this is a serious issue.

277
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
We'll tell him it's serious.
No problem.

278
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,480
Oh, you know what?

279
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,560
How did they find out
about the gun truck, huh?

280
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,720
That's three mil per week
right there.

281
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,040
Son of a bitch!

282
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,200
Four and half mil per, gross. Cash.

283
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,720
Very aggressive move, isn't it?

284
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,960
An overreaction.
They want to scare you.

285
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
Oh, is that right?

286
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,280
You think that they think
that Don Maroni can be scared?

287
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,680
Of course, you're right. No.

288
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,200
But why, then,
would they react so ferociously?

289
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,560
- Why do they want me back so badly?
- I know why.

290
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,840
Because they know
I got a stone moneymaker here.

291
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,840
A golden goose.

292
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,120
They know it,
and they don't want us to have him.

293
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
Right, Penguin?

294
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,880
Honk, honk.

295
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,440
- What?
- Honk, honk.

296
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,680
- It's what geese say.
- Oh, right, right. Honk, honk.

297
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,360
So, fine, he's a goose.

298
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,320
Maybe we can negotiate a price,
pay them off.

299
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,160
- Yeah.
- Yes. Caution is wise.

300
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,400
The Falcone clan still
is number one, after all.

301
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,920
Paying them off
is the safe thing to do.

302
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,080
Screw safe.

303
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,680
They want to push me?
They think I'm gonna fold?

304
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,640
I'll push right back, harder.

305
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,520
Hit them where it hurts. Today.

306
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,440
You know best.

307
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,640
If that's how you want to play it...

308
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,840
I think I know
just the spot to hit them.

309
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,080
I owe you an apology.

310
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,000
You were telling the truth,
and I wouldn't believe you.

311
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,680
Maybe my personal feelings towards
Barbara got tangled up in there.

312
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,120
- And that was wrong.
- Forget it.

313
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,480
Anyhow, I'm... I'm sorry
for misjudging you,

314
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,080
and I'm very glad
that we're on the same side now.

315
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,480
Yeah, me, too.

316
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,680
So Barbara's safe though?
You're sure she's safe?

317
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,280
I'm sure.

318
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,520
Gordon, is that you?

319
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,480
It's all right, Alfred.

320
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
It's all right. He's a friend.

321
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,440
We couldn't risk a direct approach,
there's people looking for me.

322
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
Oh, right.

323
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,840
Sorry about that, mate.

324
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,960
Can't be too careful.

325
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,600
In a spot of bother, are we, sir?

326
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Renee Montoya and Crispus Allen.

327
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,960
Pleased to meet you.

328
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,720
Bruce, I promised
I would find your parents' killer.

329
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,360
I'm not sure I'm going to be able
to keep that promise.

330
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,720
It's a long story,
but I'm kind of in a tight spot.

331
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,200
I've upset some powerful people.

332
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,400
Stop treating me like a child.

333
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,880
Explain.

334
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,600
Bruce, you are a child.
You don't need to know...

335
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,920
You expect to die!

336
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,600
I'd like to know why.

337
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,040
Is it connected to my parents'
murder?

338
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,200
Yes, it's all connected.

339
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,040
Somehow.

340
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
Bruce...

341
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,400
I will do my best
to work this thing out.

342
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
But if I don't...

343
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,520
Montoya and Allen here
will take over your parents' case.

344
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,000
I've told them everything I know.

345
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,920
You can trust them,
100 percent.

346
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
One hundred percent.

347
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,520
Bruce, these are good detectives.

348
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,360
If anyone can find the truth,
it's them.

349
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,760
Thank you.

350
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,520
Sir, what can we do to help you now?

351
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Nothing.

352
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,200
From here on in,
I have to go it alone.

353
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,640
I don't want anyone else caught up
in this.

354
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,840
- I have to go.
- You can hardly walk.

355
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,920
I'll be fine.

356
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
This way.

357
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Not much further.

358
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,760
It's there.

359
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,760
Told you.

360
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,880
Easy as pie.

361
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,640
There must be a million dollars'
worth here.

362
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,320
Yeah, you told us, all right.

363
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
You're clever.

364
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,000
You're very clever.

365
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,720
I sense a sarcastic
and hostile edge to your tone.

366
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
Hostile?

367
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
You got that right.

368
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,160
You ain't no golden goose.
You're a yellow rat snitch,

369
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,120
and you got Maroni all twisted.

370
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,640
I'm so glad we're finally
clearing the air at last.

371
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,760
That's it.

372
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,840
Act smart, okay?

373
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,760
'Cause all I got to do right now

374
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,640
is put a bullet in your brain
right here.

375
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,840
Bang.

376
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,640
See, then I go back
and I tell the boss

377
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,120
that one of Niko's men shot you.

378
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,160
Gee, that's too bad. End of story.

379
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,040
Yes, that's clever enough.

380
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,800
I never doubted your intelligence.

381
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,640
That's not your problem.

382
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,800
Oh, I got a problem, huh?
I got a problem.

383
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,720
No, you got a problem.

384
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,080
What's my problem, schmo?

385
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,200
What drives you?

386
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,280
What's your passion?

387
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,480
When you know what a man loves,
you know what can kill him.

388
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,640
Do you believe this guy?

389
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,640
For you, it's money.

390
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,000
You love money.

391
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,840
More than power and respect.

392
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,040
You're a skinflint, Mr. Carbone.

393
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,480
A cheapskate.

394
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,520
What are you guys playing at?
Let me go.

395
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,120
Sorry, Frankie.

396
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,400
- As I say, a cheapskate.
- Hey, come on! Hey...

397
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,760
Consequently, you don't pay
your people enough.

398
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,080
No, you know me.
You don't wanna do this.

399
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,760
- It is a sad fact...
- You don't want to do this.

400
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,880
No.

401
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,680
That there is no loyalty
among thieves.

402
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,440
The simple offer
of a substantial pay raise

403
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,400
is all it took to sway these
fine men.

404
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,760
So, you see, that's your problem!

405
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,320
Your greatest passion
becomes your greatest weakness!

406
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Love...

407
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,640
Mr. Carbone.

408
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,520
Love conquers all.

409
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,840
My friend.

410
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,600
My good friend, today is a sad day.

411
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,600
Nikolai was like a son to me...

412
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,000
just as Frankie was a son to you.

413
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,920
We both lost precious family members.

414
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,560
- My condolences to you.
- And mine to you.

415
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,640
I want this violence to stop.

416
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,640
Business is good.

417
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,040
The Arkham Project is a gold mine.

418
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,920
Wayne Enterprises is back in play.

419
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,440
Life is good for all of us.

420
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,000
Why risk all of that
and go to war over trifles?

421
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,200
Your little man there
is obviously very valuable to you.

422
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
We'll let you have him.

423
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,640
Unharmed. Our gift to you.

424
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,000
And as a show of mutual respect,
you give us something in return.

425
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,240
Like such as what?

426
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,320
How about real estate?

427
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,960
One of your warehouses
on the river maybe.

428
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
That's not gonna work.

429
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,840
I mean, I like this fella, but...

430
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,760
we're talking about a warehouse
on the river.

431
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,920
Yeah.

432
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Indian Hill.

433
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,480
I'll give you Indian Hill.

434
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,360
I'm not familiar with the name.

435
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,440
It's in Arkham.

436
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,280
It's a toxic waste dump
on top of an Indian burial ground.

437
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,320
- It's worthless.
- No.

438
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,120
Nothing is worthless.

439
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,960
Even nothing is worth something.
We'll take it.

440
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,280
As a token of our mutual respect,
yes?

441
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,400
You got it, my friend.

442
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,760
It's all love.

443
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,840
It's a pleasure seeing you all.

444
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,200
I heard Vic Zsasz tore up
the G.C.P.D.,

445
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,280
tracking down Gordon.

446
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,920
Did you catch him yet?

447
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,600
We're working on it.

448
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,000
Well, good luck with that.

449
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,440
There's nothing more dangerous
than an honest man, huh?

450
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,080
Jimbo, it's me. Open up.

451
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,520
- Hey.
- Don't worry,

452
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
I'm not gonna kill you.

453
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,920
I should, but I ain't.

454
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,680
Glad to hear it.

455
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,040
Obviously, you figured you'd go
to the last place they'd look,

456
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,320
because it'd be the first place
they'd reject as being too obvious.

457
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,360
I'm sorry, I'm being rude.

458
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,160
This is the Duchess of Devonshire.

459
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,880
Duchess, Jim Gordon, putz.

460
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,840
- Marsha. Hi.
- Right.

461
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,040
Baby, why don't you explore
a little bit.

462
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,240
Find the bedroom.
Put on your birthday suit.

463
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,960
And I'll find you in a jiffy, okay?

464
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,200
So, I've been thinking.
You're still a douche bag,

465
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,040
but you have the moral high ground.

466
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,360
So, I'm gonna back your play,
whatever it is.

467
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,640
I figure I'm doomed anyhow.
I might as well join the good guys.

468
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,880
Thank you.

469
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,000
So, what is your play?

470
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,720
I mean, you got one, right?
You said you did.

471
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,840
Tomorrow morning,
I'm arresting Falcone and the mayor

472
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,200
for the framing of Mario Pepper.

473
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,840
Conspiracy, POJ, Rico, the works.

474
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,160
Well, that's a,
that's a hell of a plan.

475
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,920
You sit down with a panel
of chimpanzees

476
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,800
and a bucket of crack
and come up with that one?

477
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,520
I figure whatever else happens,
we'll stir things up.

478
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,800
We might even make the papers.

479
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,440
Oh, yeah, we're gonna
make the papers, all right.

480
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,280
We're gonna be dead in the streets
in time for the evening edition.

481
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,880
Well, at least the people
will know the truth.

482
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,480
And we'll go out doing our jobs,
enforcing the law.

483
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,520
That's the best
inspirational speech you got?

484
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
Doing our jobs?

485
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,600
- You don't have to join me.
- No, I'm game.

486
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,200
Like I said, I'm doomed anyhow.

487
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,320
Now, if you'll excuse me
for one minute,

488
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,800
just gonna take care of
some business.

489
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Duchess!

490
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Marco!

491
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
Polo!

492
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,600
Jumping catfish.

493
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,920
Good morning, Mayor James.

494
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,360
Gordon, you scared,
scared the bejeebers out of me.

495
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,800
Almost spilled my coffee.

496
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,040
Sorry.

497
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,360
Sir, you're under arrest.

498
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,440
That's not funny.

499
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,600
Depends where you're sitting.

500
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,080
Might want to take a look at this.

501
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,280
How you doing, guys?

502
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,040
I'm here to have a chat
with Mr. Falcone.

503
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Sure thing, Mr. Mayor.

504
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,200
Carmine Falcone, you're under arrest.

505
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
Move.

506
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,800
Lie down right over there.
Stay quiet.

507
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,440
What on earth are you thinking?

508
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,240
We're thinking
we'll take you both to jail

509
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,040
and charge you with conspiracy
to pervert the course of justice.

510
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,200
Try and take me in, you won't make it
to the end of the street.

511
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,360
That's exactly what I said.

512
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,960
This is a lawful arrest.
If you resist, you will be shot.

513
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,440
I see.

514
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,480
We all die together
in a blaze of glory.

515
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,280
If that's how it works out,
that's fine with me.

516
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,440
- How about you, Harvey?
- Fine by me.

517
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,440
- Oh, God.
- I envy you boys.

518
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,440
Having nothing to lose
must be liberating.

519
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,920
Must feel pretty good.

520
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,080
Yes, it does.

521
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,520
Suppose you did have something
to lose.

522
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,880
What would you do then?

523
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,400
Suppose, for instance,

524
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,880
I had a knife to Barbara Kean's
throat right now.

525
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,520
- Would you still be so brave?
- You don't.

526
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,160
I'm telling you I do.

527
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,600
You're a liar.

528
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,800
I have many faults,
but I'm not a liar.

529
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,960
Victor Zsasz has Barbara.

530
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
You know Victor.

531
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,640
You're lying. She's far away.

532
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,720
She came back.

533
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,280
Came right to me
to plead for your life.

534
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,520
You have a good woman there.

535
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,080
She loves you very much.

536
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
Too much.

537
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,720
Prove it.

538
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,080
Prove you have her.

539
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,160
I could.

540
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,880
But I won't.

541
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,400
I want you to believe me.

542
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,240
It's obvious, Jim. He's lying.

543
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,320
Am I?

544
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,160
If you think so,
go ahead and try to bring me in.

545
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,880
You'll be dead,

546
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,760
so you won't know
what happens to Barbara.

547
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,400
But it won't be pretty.

548
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,480
Lying.

549
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,760
On my mother's grave.

550
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:47,320
Drop your gun, and Barbara
won't be harmed in any way.

551
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,120
Those muffins smell good.

552
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,720
None for you, creep.

553
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,240
She can have one if she wants.

554
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,960
No, thank you.

555
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
Got it.

556
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,240
What a shame.

557
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,760
Oh, this is embarrassing,
he straight-up

558
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,480
bluffed you into folding.

559
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,840
We could've gone out like heroes,
now we're fish food.

560
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,160
Okay. So, it wasn't a bluff.

561
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,200
I'm sorry if she was
mistreated a little.

562
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,400
We needed to be sure she had
nothing useful to tell us.

563
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,320
Untie her, Victor.

564
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,080
I'm sorry.

565
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,240
It's okay. It's okay.

566
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,480
What am I gonna do with you?

567
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,680
By rights, you have to die.

568
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,960
Hello. I'm late for work.

569
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,440
Quite an adventure.
I'll be on my way.

570
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,040
Such a waste though.

571
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,560
Gotham needs men like you,
both of you.

572
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,720
Strong men with principles.

573
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,360
I wish I could make you see
I'm not the enemy.

574
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,280
The system is not the enemy.

575
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,400
The enemy is anarchy.

576
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,120
But I told you that before,
didn't I, Jim?

577
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,200
Yes, you did.

578
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
You didn't listen though.

579
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,400
Do we get a last meal, or a smoke,
or anything? Or just talk?

580
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,840
But today, you believed me.

581
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,120
You trusted my word.
That's a good first step.

582
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,600
Perhaps there's still hope for you.

583
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,720
Yes.

584
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,000
Go. Get out of here
before I change my mind.

585
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,480
- Wait a minute.
- Quiet.

586
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,160
It's been a pleasure, Barbara.

587
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,920
I do admire a brave woman.

588
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,960
What's the catch?

589
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,240
Jim, he said we could go.
Let's not haggle here.

590
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,880
What's the catch, Mr. Falcone?

591
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,280
I want you to think about
what I said.

592
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,560
I want you to understand the truth.

593
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,040
That's all I ask.

594
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,120
The catch is...

595
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,320
someday soon,
you'll see I'm right.

596
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,640
Barbara...

597
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
I'm sorry.

598
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,720
I was just trying to help, and...

599
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,280
I don't know what...

600
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,040
I love you so much.

601
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,200
Excellent.

602
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,200
- Delicious.
- Yes.

603
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,640
I followed the recipe.

604
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,360
You're right, Mr. F.,
cooking is easy.

605
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,360
I'm sorry you had to see
all that earlier.

606
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,280
Not pleasant.

607
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,320
I understand. Business is business.

608
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,280
Yes, it is.

609
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,560
I'll go see to the chickens.

610
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,640
Any eggs, my dears?

611
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Don Falcone.

612
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,120
My friend. Good to see you.

613
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,680
I was just thinking
about the night we met.

614
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,880
Cut them down.

615
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,600
Where's the snitch?

616
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,880
I want to speak to him.

617
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,960
Cobblepot, is it?

618
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,960
Condemned men are honest men, I find.

619
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,640
What can you tell me before you go?

620
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,480
Don Falcone.

621
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,280
It is a great honor, sir.

622
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,400
Indeed, I can tell a secret
of great value to you...

623
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,800
if you grant me one last request.

624
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,120
Which is what?

625
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,120
Give the job of killing me
to James Gordon.

626
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,800
Why him?

627
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,880
He's the only man under your sway
who has a conscience.

628
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,280
The only one who might be persuaded
to spare my life.

629
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,520
Why would I agree to that?
I want you dead. You're a snitch.

630
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,160
If you agree and Gordon spares me,

631
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,680
then I will become your snitch.

632
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,520
For life.

633
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,240
I will come back to Gotham
under a different name,

634
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,240
and I will work my way
into the Maroni family,

635
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,680
and I will snitch for you.

636
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,240
I am excellent at this sort of work.

637
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,720
I have a gift for it.
I really do, sir.

638
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,440
Deal.

639
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,840
Gordon will get the job
of killing you.

640
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,560
Thank you, sir.

641
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,760
What is the valuable secret?

642
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,720
Oh, yes.

643
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,800
Fish Mooney and Nikolai the Russian
only pretend to hate each other.

644
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,360
They're lovers.

645
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,120
And Fish is pushing Nikolai
to take your place.

646
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,960
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.

647
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,200
But only so Fish
can take over from him.

648
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,840
That is a good secret.

649
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,680
It's almost uncanny.

650
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,400
Everything played out
exactly as you said it would.

651
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,680
We got rid of Nikolai painlessly,
and Maroni thinks you're a wizard.

652
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,120
You really do have a gift.

653
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,960
But I think we're making
a mistake letting Gordon live.

654
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,120
He's trouble.

655
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,680
Thank you so much for sparing him.

656
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,080
I appreciate the favor.

657
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,160
Don't worry.

658
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,840
He'll see the light.

659
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,960
One way or another, I guarantee it.
