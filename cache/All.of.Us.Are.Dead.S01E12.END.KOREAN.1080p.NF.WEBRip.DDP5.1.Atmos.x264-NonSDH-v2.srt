1
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:14,866
Oh, shit.

2
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,203
Your house isn't over there, is it?

3
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,039
No.

4
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,834
I think they're burning Hyosan down.

5
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,585
Seoul University.

6
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:08,920
What about it?

7
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,214
To save the majority,

8
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,552
just how heartless do you think
you need to be?

9
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,599
Did they teach you things
like that at school?

10
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,399
We don't learn
that kind of stuff in my major.

11
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,943
I'm not sure which major has that.

12
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,285
Oh…

13
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,877
Stay still.

14
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,571
Let's go.

15
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:06,621
On-jo, let's go.

16
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,005
I can't go on like this.

17
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,927
I'm sorry. Can you wait for just a sec?

18
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,264
Actually, never mind.

19
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,766
Go ahead. I'll catch up with you.

20
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,488
I'll go with her.

21
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,990
I'll go, too.

22
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,367
I'm also going.

23
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,743
No, you hurt your leg.

24
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,288
Wu-jin, keep an eye on Dae-su.

25
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,505
Hey, Cheong-san.

26
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,680
Cheong-san!

27
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,817
Cheong-san, you're such a jerk!

28
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,293
Let's go.

29
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,964
I don't smell anything.
There's no one here.

30
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,054
Let's say bye to Cheong-san…

31
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,809
and go.

32
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,007
Careful. Slowly.

33
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,175
Oh, shit.

34
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,062
CHEONG-SAN CHICKEN
CHICKEN AND BEER

35
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,566
THIS IS A SAFE ZONE

36
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,326
<i>One infected, eliminated.</i>

37
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,162
<i>Pulling out.</i>

38
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,209
THIS IS A RESTRICTED AREA

39
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,589
THIS IS A SAFE ZONE

40
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,387
<i>The soldiers saw</i>
<i>that we were at the school.</i>

41
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,849
They left us there without helping us,
and then they bombed it.

42
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,437
Maybe they actually want us to die.

43
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,565
I don't believe that.

44
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,778
I think it's all because of me.

45
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,117
Because we were with zombies,

46
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:18,456
they must think we're neither
a zombie nor human, like me.

47
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,585
Maybe that's what they thought.

48
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,837
Don't talk like that.

49
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,717
Is it really okay for me
to stay with you guys like this?

50
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,512
You're still our friend
and our class president.

51
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,640
We couldn't have made it
this far without you.

52
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,934
Still…

53
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,061
You haven't turned yet,

54
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,647
and you never will.

55
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,116
I really wanna do that again
in the future.

56
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:00,206
That was my first time
sitting around a fire with friends.

57
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,585
We'll be able to do that again, right?

58
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,213
Let's do it again tonight.

59
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,759
What the hell?

60
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,010
What's wrong?

61
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,846
Shit. I think we're lost.

62
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,016
-There's no trail?
-There hasn't been a trail for a while.

63
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,435
I think we've been going
in fucking circle.

64
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,604
Why did you come this way
if there was no trail?

65
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,481
If we go down the wrong way,
it will be Hyosan.

66
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,027
Ha-ri.

67
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,028
Look.

68
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,033
There's something there.

69
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,384
Someone must have left it here.

70
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,095
Who did something so nice, huh?

71
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,055
A ginseng digger?

72
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,850
Who is that?

73
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,481
There's another one.

74
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,852
RESCUE TEAM 1 NAM SO-JU

75
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,791
Status?

76
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,544
Like people are about to die
of starvation.

77
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,879
Just preserve and transport them.

78
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,674
Under no circumstances
can you do to harm them.

79
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,134
Of course, sir.

80
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,989
Didn't he say to go to Yangdong?

81
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,908
You don't think there are zombies here,
too, do you?

82
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,660
No way.

83
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,748
Maybe they evacuated,
because it's next to Hyosan.

84
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,959
Hey, I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

85
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,378
Where is everyone?

86
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,549
We're okay here.

87
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,009
Why? How do you know that?

88
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:44,054
There are no broken windows,
or blood on the streets.

89
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,143
It wouldn't be this clean
if there had been a zombie rampage.

90
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,939
What?

91
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,900
Hold on.

92
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,170
Nam-ra, what is it?

93
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,051
What's up? You hear something?

94
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,719
Zombies.

95
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,390
Where, though?

96
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,769
Everywhere.

97
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,771
A lot… A lot of them?

98
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,023
One, two, three…

99
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,361
<i>four, five, six…</i>

100
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,199
<i>seven, eight…</i>

101
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,620
<i>nine, ten, eleven…</i>

102
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,586
Run.

103
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,340
Hey, follow me.

104
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,115
Aah!

105
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,331
-Are you okay?
-Take Dae-su and go.

106
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,416
Forget it.

107
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,919
What are you doing?

108
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,296
I said forget it.

109
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,468
On-jo.

110
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,181
Fuck.

111
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,767
I feel this may be the end.

112
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,729
Stay behind me.

113
00:14:58,647 --> 00:14:59,857
Don't be like this. Stay back.

114
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,030
Ha-ri!

115
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,828
Get off me!

116
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,626
Fuck!

117
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,962
Get off me!

118
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,380
Get off of him!

119
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,591
Get off! Hey!

120
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,271
Wu-jin.

121
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,232
Damn it. Oh, no.

122
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,860
Fuck! I knew this would happen.

123
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,529
It's okay. It's okay.

124
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,365
I knew it.

125
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,036
-Wu-jin, look at me.
-Ha-ri.

126
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,997
You really made it to the nationals?

127
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,083
Mm-hm, I… I did.

128
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,626
Liar.

129
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,295
You came to school,
because you failed the preliminaries.

130
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,465
Or else, you'd be at the tournament.

131
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,759
If you lost,

132
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,553
you should've gone home,
why did you come to the damn school?

133
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,556
-I'm sorry.
-Hey.

134
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,435
Keep doing archery. Okay?

135
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,479
Mm-hm.

136
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,730
Don't give up.

137
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:32,111
-Okay?
-Yeah. Yeah.

138
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,865
Wu-jin, I'm sorry.

139
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,619
No. No. Not Wu-jin, please.

140
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,955
Don't do it.

141
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,790
Fuck.

142
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,771
I'm sorry.

143
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,541
Su-hyeok.

144
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,793
Wu-jin…

145
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,629
Wu-jin… Wu-jin…

146
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:45,017
More are coming. Let's go.
There won't be any that way.

147
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,229
Come on. Let's go.

148
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,949
Please don't. Come on.

149
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,075
Let go.

150
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,588
Don't die for no reason.

151
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,196
If we run now, we're going to make it.

152
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,865
We should have enough time.

153
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,370
I know I've killed
a lot of zombies myself,

154
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,665
but a human being would apologize
for killing her brother

155
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,208
right in front of her.

156
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,620
<i>Eat them.</i>

157
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,000
<i>Eat them. Eat them all.</i>

158
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,590
<i>Why not? You're hungry.</i>

159
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,637
<i>Kill them.</i>

160
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,271
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

161
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:46,948
Wait a sec.

162
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,200
What?

163
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,369
Nam-ra's gone.

164
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,497
I'll be right back.

165
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,207
-Su-hyeok!
-Hey, Su-hyeok.

166
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,877
-You okay on your own?
-What are you going to do?

167
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,046
-Go ahead. I'll catch up.
-On-jo.

168
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,214
Hey, On-jo!

169
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,544
Hey, Nam-ra.

170
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,598
Why are you all by yourself?

171
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,268
Let's go.

172
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,521
Stay back.

173
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,314
Come on. Come with us.

174
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,901
-Mm?
-I said stay back!

175
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,666
Nam-ra!

176
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,713
Nam-ra. It's me, On-jo.

177
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,047
Nam-ra, don't do this.

178
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:27,757
Nam-ra!

179
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,765
Nam-ra.

180
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,663
You can bite me. It's okay.

181
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,209
It's okay. Trust me.

182
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,711
It's okay, Nam-ra.

183
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,599
On-jo. On-jo.

184
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,601
Hey. Are you okay?

185
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,144
Are you okay?

186
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:24,856
Nam-ra.

187
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:27,943
Nam-ra.

188
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:31,404

00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,588

00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,256
Survivors confirmed.

196
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,643
Save yourselves! Hurry!

197
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,773
Go home! Make it home!

198

All of you!

203

Come after me! Today, I am…

204
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,383
the happiest guy in this school!

205
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,410
On-jo.

206
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,163
U-sin.

207
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,626
Are you okay? You're not hurt?

208
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,713
What about your dad?

209
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:58,259
Did you see him?
So-ju said he was going to go find you.

211
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,073
<i>I already knew the sorrow</i>

212
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,784
<i>of being a survivor.</i>

213
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:29,290
<i>But I didn't know</i>
<i>just how heavy that sorrow…</i>

214
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,044
<i>would be.</i>

215
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,881
Do you know
the teacher, Lee Byeong-chan?

216
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,677
I only took morning classes,
because I had training.

217
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,012
So no, I don't.

218
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:46,808
Did he ever say, or do anything
out of the ordinary in the past?

219
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,562
That's not important at all right now.

220
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:53,440
Listen, I'm a senior.
I wanna go to college.

221
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,110
If there's anything you wanna say,
just say it.

222
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,868
What… How many times
do I have to tell you?

223
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:10,540
He kidnapped a kid
from our class named Hyeon-ju.

224
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,376
I heard he gave Hyeon-ju
some sort of injection.

225
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,586
Why…

226
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,338
Why did you leave us there?

227
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,219
You abandoned us.

228
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,722
-If you cooperate with our investigation--
-No.

229
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,724
I won't ask adults for anything…

230
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,060
ever again in my life.

231
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,106
So, please…

232
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,402
don't ask for my cooperation.

I couldn't find you.

I saw the others a few times around here.

282
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,275
I wanted to see them,

Will you forget if you don't see them?

286
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,579
I went to the mountain last night
and saw a campfire.

287
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,583
I think someone lit a fire
on the school rooftop.

288
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:31,546
On the rooftop?

289

Are you sure about that?

00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:37,760
I could have been mistaken,
but I'm pretty sure.

291
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,932
Nam-ra said that we should have a campfire

292
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,060
if we should ever meet again.

293
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,865
I plan on going tonight.

294
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,408
I'll go with you.

295
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:07,999
I'm sorry about that day.

296
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,252
What day?

297
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,755
That day when Nam-ra tried to bite you.

298
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,133
Sorry I couldn't do anything.

299
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,051
Don't worry. It's okay.

300
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,347
Your choice that day saved us all.

301
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,684
Don't tell the others.

302
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,520
It might be too dangerous,
so let's go by ourselves.

303
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,805
I told you not to tell them.

304
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,188
Hey, I told you not to tell anyone else.

305
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,984
Um…

306
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,736
I said it was between us.

307
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,324
She said she'd tell the cops
if we didn't take her.

308
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:27,662
They won't give me special admission
for surviving the zombie attack.

309
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,415
How is that even related?
We'll be arrested if we get caught.

310
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,876
Might as well go to jail
if I can't get into college.

311
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:37,797
Let's go. Climb that wall, huh?

312
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,174
Wait. You're really coming?

313
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,467
All of you?

314
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,679
You're not the only one who feels guilty.

315
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,222
We were all hurt, too.

316
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,349
Being alone doesn't make it hurt less.

317
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,647
Come on.

318
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,191
Didn't you say there was a rope?

319
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,776
-How do we get up there?
-Move.

320
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,070
Are you sure?

321
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,322
I'm going as well.

322
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,991
-Get on all fours.
-What?

323
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,492
-Come on.
-You heard her.

324
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,429
I MISS YOU ALL

325
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,107
What's that?

326
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,067
Well…

327
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,111
I couldn't throw it away.

328
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,865
Joon-yeong.

00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:49,035
I promise to bring a box next time.

330
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,084
I see a light.

331
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,881
-Do you?
-No. Where?

332
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,424
It's over there.

333
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,761
Hey, I think
that really is our school.

334
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,103
What a mess.

335
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,690
I know.

336
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,091
Come on.

337
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,057
Mm-hm.

338
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:10,199
THIS IS A SAFE ZONE
HYOSAN HIGH SCHOOL

339
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,698
Do you really think it's Nam-ra?

340
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:53,659
Mm-hm.

341
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,537
I don't know why, but…

342
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,123
I think it's her.

343
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,345
Who do you think?

344
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:00,017
Maybe…

345
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:03,312
it was kids who came back
to the school like us.

346
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:09,735
Maybe it was a YouTuber or something.

347
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:11,529
Like those kids who like haunted houses.

348
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:17,785
No.

349
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,163
Nam-ra.

350
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,292
Maybe she lit it because she missed us.

351
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,044
How would you know that?

352
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,966
I don't know for sure.

353
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,134
But I think I do.

354
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:38,931
You made it.

355
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:41,809
Oh…

356
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:43,686
The prez.

357
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,605
Nam-ra.

358
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,043
Hey, prez.

359
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,672
Am I still your class president?

360
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,304
It's nice.

361
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:21,849
Are you okay?

362
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,351
How have you been?

363
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,452
I've missed you, guys.

364
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,415
I've missed all of you.

365
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,294
Nam-ra.

366
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:54,715
I wanted to go see you,
but I didn't think I should.

367
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,050
No, it's okay.

368
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,553
Let's go. Come with us.

369
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,182
I still have things that I have to do.

370
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,434
What things?

371
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,895
Mmm…

372
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:09,772
There are some others like me.

373
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,775
Some of them ran away
from the school a while ago,

374
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,568
but there are still a few left.

375
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,112
You're not a zombie.

376
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:19,948
Don't say that.

377
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:24,953
You know how we're not really kids,
but also not quite adults yet, either?

378
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,206
That's like me.

379
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,249
I'm neither a human…

380
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,795
nor a monster.

381
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,463
You're not.

382
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,300
Please stay.

383
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,720
It'll be okay.

384
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,778
We're friends even if we're apart.

385
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:00,447
Okay?

386
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:06,787
Aren't we?

387
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,415
Yes, you're right.

388
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:13,127
Wherever we are, we'll be friends.

389
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,088
Well, that's good enough.

390
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:22,553
It's them.

391
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:29,977
See you, okay?

392
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,392
ALL CHARACTERS,
LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS,

393
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,186
AND EVENTS IN THIS SHOW ARE FICTIONAL.
