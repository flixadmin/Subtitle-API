1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:06,340
Did you hear William beat up someone from Hansen this weekend?

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,620
You're going on a date with William..
for Vilde's sake?

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:18,080
It was good that you apologised to Vilde.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,460
About her not being good enough for you.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,700
I hope it was a smart plan.

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,780
Because now she's keen on me again.

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,780
I'm not keen on her.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,300
Where are you?

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,360
We have to go.

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,740
Eva?

11
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,900
Eva!

12
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,780
Noora!

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,280
Hi.

14
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,080
Hi.

15
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,540
I slept here.

16
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,640
I can see, you know.

17
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,280
Who is he?

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,500
His name is Håvard.
-Halvor.

19
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,440
How was your date yesterday?

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,460
Eh.. fine.

21
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,700
How was he?

22
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,600
Nice.

23
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,840
Nice? You have to tell me more!

24
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,960
Good morning!
-Hey birthday boy!

25
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,620
You know what?

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,500
I think I'm still drunk. A little.

27
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,780
Could you be a little bit more quiet?

28
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:27,240
Okay, Linn!
We'll be quiet all day!

29
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,440
I need some water.

30
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,020
Eskild!

31
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,080
What did you say to Eva?

32
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,760
I didn't say anything.

33
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,220
I said you'd gone on a Tinder date with a guy.

34
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,020
Tinder?!

35
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,180
Hello, what world do you live in?

36
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,020
I had to say something about why you
weren't out celebrating my birthday with me.

37
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,240
Eskild, it wasn't your birthday.

38
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,820
You can't just hang out with my friends
when I'm not here.

39
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,700
We chatted a little on Facebook. 
She said she wanted to party.

40
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,740
I wanted to party too, so..

41
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,360
Eskild, you..

42
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,520
Are you jealous? Jealous that I'm taking all your friends?

43
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,480
Because I'm popular? Because I'm hot?

44
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,620
Because..

45
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,020
I won't take your place in your friends gang.
-I'm trying to be serious!

46
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,820
You are hugely popular and so funny!
Pretty! Smart! Good!

47
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,360
Do you need a hug?
-No! I don't need a hug.

48
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,080
Bear hug.

49
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,840
Is it better now?
Do you want a hug?

50
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,440
You.. Are you okay now?

51
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,200
Just take me serioulsy!
-Yes, I am taking you seriously!

52
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,300
The Yakuza-boys were like:
Hey, guys! Stop, you're killing him!

53
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,320
He sat on top and hit and hit him, but he screamed:
Haven't you had enough now?!

54
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,960
He just lay there and wasn't even able to respond.
He just spit up blood.

55
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,960
Did you see the video?

56
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,520
It was so rough!

57
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,580
The Yakuza-guys fought with a knife.

58
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,000
.. he found his mother dead in the bathtub.
After that something snapped in him.

59
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:54,220
.. and so I wrote to him: Heard there was a fight on Friday.
Are you okay?

60
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,420
He didn't answer.
I was terribly worried.

61
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,860
I heard that he wasn't even there.

62
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,700
Who did you hear that from?

63
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:10,880
I was talking to Iben, and he told me it was only
Chris and a few others who were there.

64
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,060
That's why it was really unfair.

65
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,720
Because the Yakuza-boys were with 20.

66
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,900
They were looking for William, but William wasn't there.

67
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,540
So they were beaten up..

68
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,020
.. while William was at home fucking some girl.

69
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,220
What girl?

70
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,980
It's just a rumor.
I don't know if it's true.

71
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,140
Did William reply?

72
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,140
No, he didn't reply. So I sent one:

73
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,660
"William, could you answer, so I know you're alive? 
I'm terribly worried."

74
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,760
Then he replied at 11.33: "Alive. I'm alive."

75
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,120
Has anyone seen them?

76
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,100
Chris is definitely still at the hospital.

77
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,480
Isn't that William's car?

78
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,680
Did Iben say more about the girl William was with?

79
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,260
It could be Olivia from the third year.

80
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,060
Or Marte from 1STA.

81
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,540
No, she's a bit strange.

82
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,400
What's the name of the girl that came out of the cafeteria?

83
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,400
She's quite pretty.

84
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,280
Or maybe the dark girl? Isabel?

85
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,280
Wasn't she with Jonas..

86
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,360
Hey!

87
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,900
It could be Anja from 2STB, 
but she isn't really his type.

88
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,300
She is a bit.. thick.

89
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,340
Huh?

90
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,340
You have to stop now. She's fat?!

91
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,480
Not fat-fat. I'm just saying William likes skinny girls.

92
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,360
That's the dumbest thing I've heard, Vilde.

93
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,440
I'm just saying that boys like different things.

94
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,220
Some like small butts, others like big ones.

95
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:02,820
Not everyone has to be super skinny,
but William likes girls who are model thin.

96
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,860
Like you.

97
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,460
If it's true that William's dating a girl,
she's definitely really skinny.

98
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,400
It's not to diss Anja. 
Gum?

99
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,020
I'm going to find out who it is on Friday.

100
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,660
Friday..?

101
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,260
If William's actually dating someone, she's definitely coming to his party.

102
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,740
Party..?

103
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,040
Oh yeah! We can't drink at my place.

104
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,800
Mom's coming home.

105
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,980
Can we do it at your place?

106
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,460
Eh, yeah. But I won't be at William's party.

107
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,960
Why not?

108
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,920
Because I can't on Friday.

109
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,980
You never want to go out anymore.

110
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,060
You didn't go out last weekend, either.

111
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,460
There was no one who could go out last weekend.

112
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,760
Is there someone you're hiding from us?

113
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,860
A little girlfriend, maybe?

114
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,140
Bring her to William's party.

115
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,200
Seriously? I can? That's so amazing, Vilde!

116
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,900
Maybe she can come to the cabin? 
A lesbian couple in Hemsedal.

117
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,520
That would be so cozy!

118
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,540
Right, Eva?

119
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,120
Yeah!

120
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,300
What do you have now?

121
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,300
Chemistry.

122
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,320
I have class in the B-building, so.

123
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,660
Bye!

124
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,540
Vilde...

125
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,620
Fucking hell, it's you! Isn't it?

126
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,980
You're dating William!

127
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,820
Eva, before you freak out here..

128
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,080
Fucking hell. Fucking hell!

129
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,980
Hallo, okay. We've been on one date
and I did it for Vilde.

130
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,860
Why for Vilde?

131
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:43,920
Because the stuff he said to her during Christmas, 
he just said it because I promised I'd go on a date with him.

132
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,100
Are you kidding me?

133
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,740
Am I on an episode of Gossip Girl?

134
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,660
Eva, you know I hate that show.

135
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,020
This is totally sick!

136
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,400
But you don't like him at all, right?

137
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,520
Eva, it's William we're talking about here.

138
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,700
So how was your date then?

139
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,860
Weird!

140
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,620
Do you realise now why I can't go to the party?

141
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,580
If William starts to make a move on me..

142
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,300
.. Vilde will start to realise it.

143
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:41,040
I just hope she doesn't start asking him about it.

144
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,780
I don't trust him at all.

145
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,760
Fucking hell. This is Gossip Girl.

146
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,840
Okay, maybe a budget version.
But it's fucking Gossip Girl!

147
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,880
I've had it with all the Gossip Girl references now.

148
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,600
Funny!

149
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,240
Noora, you're impressive.

150
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,540
Thanks.

151
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,040
I don't understand how Eskild can party so much.

152
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,420
I think it's lovely to just be at home and relax.
Don't you agree?

153
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,440
Hm-hm.

154
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,700
Does school suck?

155
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,500
I hated high school. It truly sucked.

156
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,640
The teachers had no sympathy.

157
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,940
"The curriculum is the same for everyone."
Easy for them to say.

158
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,760
We are the performance generation.

159
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,920
We have it a little worse than they had.

160
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,500
At first I was like that as well.

161
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,520
"Fuck this shit."

162
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,600
"I need a year off."

163
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,700
Drama between Vilde and William. Vilde is crying in the bathroom.

164
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,920
Since you're already standing up..

165
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,280
.. could you hand me a Fun light?

166
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,980
Noora! Hi!

167
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,020
What happened? Where's Vilde?

168
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,660
She ran away.

169
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,280
But you're here now!

170
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,760
But.. what happened?

171
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,600
You said there was some drama between Vilde and William.

172
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,380
Shit!

173
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:42,380
She's so in love with William,
but I don't think he's in love with her.

174
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,460
They didn't say anything about me?

175
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,480
They said nothing?

176
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,660
No.
-No?

177
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,100
Shhh. Shhh!

178
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,660
You were on a date!

179
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,240
Do you think he..

180
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,480
I don't know, but I have to..

181
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,500
Yeah, you have to go say hi!

182
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,260
Halvor.. and Jacob!

183
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,980
He is so sweet. He's almost my boyfriend.

184
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,980
No! Jonas! You came!

185
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,520
We are best forever, right?

186
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,240
I love you so fucking much. Did you know that?

187
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,760
I've said it a few times already.

188
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,680
Drink a little, guys.

189
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,320
You should meet girls.

190
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,540
Where are you going?

191
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,420
To the toilet.

192
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,280
You can't leave her.

193
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,440
It takes two seconds.

194
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,460
I'll be back soon, okay?

195
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,300
You came.

196
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,840
What did you say to Vilde?

197
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,220
What?

198
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,500
She walked out crying.

199
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,900
She wanted to hook up,
but I wasn't interested.

200
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,200
You didn't say anything about me?

201
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,040
About you? Who are you?

202
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,160
I'm kidding. Of course I didn't say anything about you.

203
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,580
Fuck off!

204
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,400
What the hell is going on here?

205
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,540
Who are you?

206
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,420
William.
-William? Axel.

207
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,500
The party you're having here..
You have to put an end to it.

208
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,120
We've gotten complaints from your neighbors.

209
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,160
Music off, and people out.

210
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,000
Everyone. Great.

211
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,780
Eva?

212
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,580
Hello!

213
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,920
The party is over, ladies and gentlemen.

214
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,320
William, I have to borrow your cellphone.

215
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,220
Eva left with all my stuff.

216
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,420
Hi Eskild. I have lost everything.
My phone and keys.

217
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,720
Call me when you get this message.

218
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,180
On this number.

219
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,700
Chris.

220
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,480
It's time to leave.

221
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,180
Are you coming with me?

222
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,480
Kidding..

223
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,360
Did you get to her?

224
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,580
No.

225
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,400
But I left a message on the voice mail
of someone I live with so..

226
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,400
He'll definitely call back soon.

227
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,300
When are your parents coming home?

228
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,820
They're not coming home.

229
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,300
Where are they?

230
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,740
Dad lives in London and mom lives 
on Snarøya with a new man.

231
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,900
You live here by yourself?

232
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,600
More or less.

233
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,920
I don't drink.

234
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,320
Shock..

235
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,520
Don't you have siblings?

236
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,920
My brother studies in Stockholm.

237
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,760
Do you want something else?

238
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,860
Do you have.. cocoa?

239
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,380
Baking cocoa?

240
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:47,680
Yeah, I don't know why I got it. The lady at the
check out got it for me so it was okay.

241
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,500
It says something about dark cocoa drink here.

242
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,720
Extra dark and powerful cocoa.

243
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:03,480
Five tablespoons of Freia baking cocoa.

244
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,780
Four to five tablespoons of sugar.

245
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,580
Yeah?
-Yeah!

246
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:15,020
Don't you remember how to make it?
-I do, but I just want to do it right.

247
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,500
Okay.

248
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,140
Why don't you live with your mom?

249
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,680
Because my mom is a cunt.

250
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,760
Hey..

251
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,780
What?

252
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,780
It's still your mom.

253
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,720
So what?
Should I not be honest?

254
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:20,140
Sure, but you don't need to be a complete
misogynist about it.

255
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,520
So you only want me to be honest if it's politically correct?

256
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,580
Has Eskild called?

257
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:29,820
No.

258
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,420
You have to check your cellphone.

259
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,780
Fuck.

260
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,260
Do you want one?

261
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,300
Oh my god, seriously?

262
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,760
Can I have it?

263
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,940
Do I look good?

264
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:28,560
It's the sweater of all sweaters.
Many at school have acquired it.

265
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,700
Insanely popular. 
Then I would've been just like you.

266
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,040
That's the dream, right?

267
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,740
A guitar too?

268
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,900
Have we really come to this point?
There's nothing missing then, so to speak.

269
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,060
Do you play for girls?

270
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,100
So sweet.

271
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,860
Sweet, indeed.

272
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,960
Yeah.

273
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,760
Do you play for them before you take them to bed?
You have to, right?

274
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,760
You have to do something.

275
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,080
What do you play?
-I don't play for girls.

276
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,580
Yes you do.
What else? Oof.

277
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,580
There's sound! It's a real one, then?

278
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,600
You obviously play for girls. I know it.
What do you play?

279
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,720
Is it country?

280
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,980
I know what you play.
You just..

281
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,900
Was that it? No? No..

282
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,800
Then it's more like..

283
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,860
With a little rapping. No? Really?

284
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,560
Now I know, William.
I know it.

285
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,840
I think it's for you.

286
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,840
Hello, where are you?
-At home. What's up?

287
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,360
I lost all my stuff.
Keys, cellphone, everything.

288
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,020
Okay, so.. That sucks.
-It really sucks!

289
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,960
At least I'm at home now. 
Just call from downstairs and I'll let you in.

290
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,100
Yeah.. Yeah okay. Bye.

291
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,900
Is he home?

292
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:05,940
Eh, no. No. 
He is in the city with some people.

293
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,820
So..

294
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,240
I can sleep on the couch.

295
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,720
Oh, no. This works, right?

296
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:39,220
Just stick to your side of the bed, okay?

297
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,140
It's my bed, so both sides are mine.

298
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,560
No. That's not how it works here now, William.

299
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,420
You may not be used to this, but..

300
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,660
.. there are sides to this bed.

301
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,180
This is your side. This is my side.

302
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,920
I suggest that we build a little border.

303
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:09,380
So don't come over and invade my personal space.

304
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,760
Are you going to sleep with all your clothes on?
-Yes.

305
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,300
Okay.

306
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,660
What do you want for breakfast tomorrow?

307
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,860
I won't be eating breakfast here.

308
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,500
Eggs and bacon? Great.

309
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,880
You are the biggest cliché I've met.

310
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,900
Ever!

311
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,660
I was never validated as a child.

312
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,920
Mom never came to graduation.
Dad never complimented my drawings.

313
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,880
Okay.

314
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,200
But you like me for it.

315
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,840
No, I don't.

316
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,240
Yes, you do. You like me.

317
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,780
What is it?
Is there someone you have to beat up?

318
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,760
It's a message from Eskild.

319
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:56,120
He doesn't want to stay up and wait for you any longer
and wonders when you're coming home.

320
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:06,080
I'll answer:
Noora is so keen on me..

321
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,040
.. that she failed to get away.

322
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:15,120
Excuse me? No! You're not writing that!
-Excuse me, you're on my side now!

323
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,020
Can you.. please get over on your side?
-Can I?

324
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,580
That's your side of the bed.

325
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,260
And this is my side of the bed.

326
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,540
So we're going to let the cellphone and pillows be.

327
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,540
Let go, let go, let go!

328
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,460
Just write that I'm coming home tomorrow.

329
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,600
You like me.

330
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,360
Goodnight, Willhelm.

331
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,880
Goodnight, Noora.
