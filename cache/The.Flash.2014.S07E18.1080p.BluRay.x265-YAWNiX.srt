1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,674
Bart's going to be okay.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,427
He has to be...

3
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:12,180
He will be, Nora.

4
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:15,391
You don't know that.
Nobody does.

5
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:18,269
Caitlin, we can't get back home.

6
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:20,855
Central City is being torn apart.

7
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,858
My dad's out there doing something
that will probably get him killed.

8
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:26,986
It just feels
like everything's falling apart.

9
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,712
Get out of the car. Go, go.

10
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,638
Heaven help us.

11
00:01:16,953 --> 00:01:20,707
Fine. You got what you wanted.

12
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,208
I'm here.

13
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:25,587
Now tell me what you were doing
at the Flash Museum.

14
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:29,757
What do you really want, Heart?

15
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:31,551
My, oh, my.

16
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:34,137
You're really direct.

17
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:38,308
Then again, you're meeting me
for the first time.

18
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:41,769
We're bound to learn new things
about each other.

19
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:43,855
Tell me what the hell is going on.

20
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,398
Or what?

21
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,775
You'll force me to?

22
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:50,194
Oh, Flash.

23
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:54,073
I'm the living god of speed.

24
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:55,575
The one.

25
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:59,162
Unlike you and your infernal spawn.

26
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:01,998
You're going to leave them alone.
Or I swear...

27
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:04,083
Are you threatening me, Flash?

28
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:06,336
Here?

29
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,339
Seriously?

30
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:16,179
You still can't comprehend
what you're dealing with.

31
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,848
So let me enlighten you.

32
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:21,267
Once upon a time,

33
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:26,522
there was a young physicist named August
who dreamed of moving faster than light.

34
00:02:26,606 --> 00:02:28,358
So he developed a way
to achieve his goal

35
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:30,610
and created the Velocity formula.

36
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:33,279
But it wasn't enough,

37
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:36,199
because no matter how fast he ran,

38
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:40,745
he soon came to realize
one salient fact.

39
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,624
That he'd never be fast enough.

40
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:48,711
Heart, tell me how to stop this war.

41
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,173
Both sides are looking for you.

42
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,342
Including one that wants to kill you.

43
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:56,552
And what?

44
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,015
You're gonna turn me over to them?

45
00:03:03,351 --> 00:03:04,602
Mm-mm.

46
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:08,690
You're too much of a hero
to sell me out.

47
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:14,320
Now, Impulse, that's a different story.

48
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:16,280
I said leave my son out of this.

49
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:17,824
Oh, but I can't.

50
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:20,576
He's the one who helped me
realize the truth.

51
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:25,748
That artificial speed would always
be a pale imitation of the real deal.

52
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,127
Spoiled little brat.

53
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,714
He's not just reckless, he's unworthy.

54
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:38,010
All the times we fought,
he was so cavalier with his gift.

55
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:41,723
A gift that should have been mine!

56
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:47,437
And now it will be.

57
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:50,857
Thanks to you.

58
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:55,528
That's what this is all about.

59
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:59,157
You want organic speed.

60
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,370
Keep going.

61
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,207
Everything that's happened,

62
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,794
us finding you, your clones,

63
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:13,546
this war...

64
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:17,884
It was all a part of my plan.
To force your hand.

65
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:23,598
So why the act
if your memories are still intact?

66
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:26,476
That's the one thing I didn't foresee.

67
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:30,146
Memory loss is a side effect
of fracturing myself in time.

68
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:33,274
Who knew, right?

69
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:35,693
Then again, I knew you'd come
looking for answers,

70
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:38,905
which eventually, would bring you to me.

71
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:44,452
Give me the gift I deserve
and I'll save your precious city

72
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,537
by reabsorbing my other selves.

73
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:50,291
Or refuse my request...

74
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:54,754
watch your city burn.

75
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:56,839
There's no way that's happening.

76
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:03,596
Besides, what you're asking me to do,
it's impossible.

77
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,681
The impossible is your thing.

78
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:10,144
You can figure it out.

79
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,231
Or watch more cities fall,

80
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:17,276
as my army spreads
and this entire world is torn apart.

81
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:27,036
I can see those little wheels
turning in your head.

82
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:30,540
You're trying desperately
to think of a way out of this.

83
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,503
Well, guess what, there isn't.

84
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,883
So what's your answer?

85
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:49,934
- Answer me, damn it!
- I already did.

86
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:52,228
I said no.

87
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:54,605
Well, you'll change your mind.

88
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:58,776
You have no choice.

89
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:08,160
Kid.

90
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:09,704
You all right?

91
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,208
Yeah... Yeah.

92
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:15,376
Oh, thank God.

93
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:16,586
What happened?

94
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:18,796
Did you find the real me?

95
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:20,840
Yeah.

96
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:23,175
What did I say?

97
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:47,408
So what are we going to do
about Godspeed's ultimatum?

98
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:50,870
We have to give him what he wants.
Organic speed.

99
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:55,499
Nora, I'm never gonna do that.

100
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,169
Dad, everything will be destroyed.

101
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,797
Not just Bart, but whole families.
We have to protect them.

102
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:03,466
What about our family?

103
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,051
If Heart is Bart's Thawne,

104
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:08,095
that means he's already caused Bart
a lifetime of pain and suffering.

105
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:13,184
But we can stop this. Here.
In this time. By finding another way.

106
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,811
But we've tried everything, Dad,
and nothing's worked!

107
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:19,440
And now Bart's dying and we're still
no closer to ending this damn war!

108
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,151
Nora, honey, if his clones
could do this to your brother,

109
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,588
then what do you think would happen
if the real August Heart

110
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:25,655
got organic speed?

111
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,783
It just all feels so hopeless.

112
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:32,119
It never is. I promise you that.

113
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:33,829
He's right.

114
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:36,907
As long as we're still standing,
we can still win this.

115
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,753
Let's go check on your brother.

116
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:48,928
Kid, I know giving August Heart
his powers back is crazy,

117
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:52,431
but if we don't,
we'd better come up with another idea.

118
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:53,766
A big one.

119
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:58,145
Not a big one. A fast one.

120
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,118
What am I supposed to do now?

121
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:14,954
August.

122
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:19,500
I know that things seem
really hopeless right now,

123
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,920
but believe me when I tell you
that this team of ours...

124
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,715
If there is anyone

125
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:28,384
who can find a way out of this thing,
it is Team Flash.

126
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,804
I believe you.

127
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,516
I do, but I saw Barry's face
when we both came back.

128
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,394
It's true, isn't it?

129
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:40,563
I'm a monster, aren't I?

130
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:43,399
You don't have to be.

131
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,484
What if I don't have a choice?

132
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,780
You all think
I'm someone from the future.

133
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:51,866
A future where I'm supposedly a killer.

134
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,702
Obsessed with taking speed
and ruling the world.

135
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,039
You know how that feels?

136
00:08:58,122 --> 00:09:01,584
Imagine getting the thing you want most,
your memories,

137
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,544
your whole life.

138
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,672
And then learn that you're the bad guy.

139
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:11,218
If that's true,
how am I supposed to live with that?

140
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,180
I'm no fortune teller,

141
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:19,226
but I can tell you that
the sorrow I feel coming from you,

142
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,606
August, bad guys...
They don't feel remorse like that.

143
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,403
Maybe the future
is not so set in stone after all.

144
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,284
<i>Hey.</i>

145
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,704
Chuck, I'm done with pep talks, okay?

146
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:41,540
I can't charge your dad's gizmo.
Not now, not ever.

147
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:48,255
Allegra, I don't give a crap
about the S.E.E. right now.

148
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:51,884
Right now,
all I care about is my friend.

149
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:59,141
Now look, Esperanza chose to go
on that mission, that's not on you.

150
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:01,435
But you know what is?

151
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,730
The Flash being alive today
because you didn't go with her.

152
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:07,775
That doesn't make any sense.

153
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,652
That makes all the sense.

154
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:13,114
That Godspeed clone in the pipeline?
He was going to kill Barry.

155
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,409
And you stopped that.

156
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:21,038
Which means the Flash can get back
to the business of ending this war.

157
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:24,125
But Esperanza? She left to start one.

158
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:29,004
She let the city down. You didn't.

159
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:31,924
You helped lift it up.

160
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:34,635
You really think so?

161
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,262
Girl, I know so.

162
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:39,515
Now, I don't know about you,

163
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,600
but I'm ready to get back
to the business

164
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:43,352
of keeping Central City safe.

165
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,897
So what do you say, you with me?

166
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:57,116
I... I guess that means a yes?

167
00:10:58,284 --> 00:10:59,702
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

168
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,245
Cool.

169
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,914
Hey, don't forget the java this time.

170
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:12,423
Ever since this war began,
we've been outfought and outnumbered.

171
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:14,884
That ends now.

172
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:19,638
For all their speed, our opponents,
no matter how fast they are,

173
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,473
they can't outrun a force of nature.

174
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:27,396
Big Nora! It's so good to see you!

175
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,148
Yeah, we've already met.

176
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:30,816
Remember when I first saw you?

177
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,694
I was like, "Oh, my gosh!
The freakin' Speed Force!"

178
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:37,198
And I was just so amazed and nervous,

179
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,200
and I just kept rambling
on and on and on

180
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:40,594
and totally embarrassing myself...

181
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:42,369
It's good to see you too, little Nora.

182
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,457
This is a rare pleasure, ma'am.

183
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,125
And if I may,

184
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:52,755
you look a whole lot like someone
very close to me.

185
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:54,423
I get that a lot.

186
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:59,386
Barry, Iris, it's good to see you again.

187
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,597
- Are the other Forces coming too?
- No.

188
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:03,863
With me here,
they're all working overtime

189
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:05,684
to keep the universe in balance.

190
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:07,937
I've seen what you all have been facing.

191
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,023
I've been fighting it myself
within the Speed Force.

192
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:14,693
Now, you all need to be at full strength
in order to defeat this threat.

193
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:17,780
Which is why whether
you're already a full speedster,

194
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:22,701
or have just a spark
of Speed Force inside of you,

195
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:25,079
I'm going to give you all a boost.

196
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,706
That is if everyone's okay with that.

197
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,423
- Schway.
- Yep.

198
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:38,842
That works.

199
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,159
- Barry, Bart's still...
- I know.

200
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,516
Oh, my impulsive boy.

201
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:53,607
What in the world?

202
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:02,491
- Whoo-hoo! Oh, I'm back.
- Bart.

203
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,535
Hi!

204
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:07,579
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?

205
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:10,582
Thank you for the reboot, SFN.
I appreciate it.

206
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:15,462
Oh. Speed Force Nana.
It's our little thing.

207
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,756
Oh, someone redid did my nails.
It must've been Caitlin.

208
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:22,553
Uncle Jay, you're...

209
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,180
You're here.

210
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:26,515
Uncle?

211
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,893
That's new. Um...

212
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,439
Yeah, I kinda like it.

213
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,358
It's good to finally meet you, Bart.

214
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:37,526
Yeah.

215
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,490
All right. What's next, Pops?

216
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:45,909
We end the civil war.

217
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,080
Once and for all.

218
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:11,115
Hey, hey, hey,
you got to get out of here.

219
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:12,269
Come on.

220
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:14,063
You gotta get up. Run. Run!

221
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:15,898
We gotta get in contact with C.C.P.D.

222
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:23,864
West!

223
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:40,130
How did I...

224
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:41,757
What just happened?

225
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:45,427
You just ran as fast as the Flash.

226
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,721
Kramer!

227
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,308
Kramer, can you hear me?

228
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,985
Hey. Looking for me?

229
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,366
Kill the Adversary. Kill the Adversary.

230
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,700
Kill the Adversary.

231
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:16,959
Kill the Adversary and his allies.

232
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,920
Kill them. Kill them all.

233
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:25,467
Kill The Adversary and his allies.
Kill them. Kill them all.

234
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,928
All right. Remember, hit 'em hard.

235
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:30,741
Wear them down and drain their energy.

236
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:33,183
Kill The Adversary and his allies.

237
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,936
Kill them. Kill them all.

238
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,462
Frost? Mecha-Vibe? How you doing?

239
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:44,463
<i>We're holding our own.</i>

240
00:16:44,464 --> 00:16:45,982
<i>Wouldn't say no
to back-up, though.</i>

241
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,525
All right. We'll be there in a minute.

242
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:48,842
<i>Dad?</i>

243
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:50,802
Something's wrong.

244
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,684
What's happening to us?

245
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:00,020
Flash, we have a problem.

246
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,401
But we knocked them all out!

247
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:09,321
- They're being recharged.
- How?

248
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,663
They're feeding off me.

249
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,165
It's what happened
inside the Speed Force.

250
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:22,626
And now that energy drain
is affecting all of us.

251
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:27,548
- Nora, you have to go.
- I can't let you fight alone.

252
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,300
You'll still be with us.
But you have to leave. Right now.

253
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:34,513
We're not going down without a fight.

254
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:47,234
Hang on to your butts.

255
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,780
Whoa.

256
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:55,367
The S.E.E. readings are
at five times their maximum strength.

257
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,829
Oh, yeah! Watch out, world.
This wavelength's off the charts!

258
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:09,256
Nice timing.

259
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,718
<i>Flash,
more Godspeeds just arrived</i>

260
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,094
<i>and they're headed your way.</i>

261
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:15,178
Continuous waves.

262
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,931
Wherever we run, they'll follow.

263
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:19,850
This could put more people
in danger. Flash...

264
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,059
I know.

265
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:24,706
Thank God you guys are okay.

266
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,150
We managed to save the reactor.

267
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:31,069
But it looks like round two's
about to begin.

268
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:33,739
And this time, there's no
Speed Force Nora or the S.E.E.

269
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,657
We threw everything we had at them.

270
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:38,701
What are we gonna do?

271
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,454
Dad?

272
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:56,637
We need to get back out there.
Frost and Mecha-Vibe need our help.

273
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,472
Yeah, we will. As soon as...

274
00:18:58,555 --> 00:18:59,555
They're gone again.

275
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,893
Wow. Frost and Mecha-Vibe
make a hell of a team.

276
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,812
Chester, how long would it take
to rebuild the S.E.E.?

277
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:09,316
Uh, four or five weeks maybe.

278
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:13,195
How come your tech-thingy
affected the clones and not us?

279
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,823
Well, you're all organic speedsters
so I tweaked my pop's design

280
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:19,076
to only target
artificial cell membranes.

281
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:21,244
Making it ineffective against us.

282
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:23,955
Well done.

283
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,749
Dad. Mom.

284
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:29,169
I know you both
wanna keep the future safe.

285
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:33,840
But if we don't stop this right now,
there won't be a future to save.

286
00:19:33,924 --> 00:19:38,428
Please can you just consider
giving Heart organic speed?

287
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:43,308
Nora, I know that seems like the answer.

288
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:47,145
But we're your parents,
it's our job to protect you.

289
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:48,688
Maybe so.

290
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,111
But Central City
doesn't need parents right now.

291
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:57,614
Dad, it needs heroes.

292
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,831
I know I said we'd protect the city

293
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:07,958
while the team figured out
a way to end this.

294
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,627
- But can a man get a timeout?
- Not happening.

295
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:15,855
- Hey, how long can you hold your breath?
- What does that matter?

296
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:18,551
When I say "now,"

297
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:20,792
we're gonna suck in
as much air as we can and hold it in.

298
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,448
What's that gonna do?

299
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,766
- Wait, you're not actually gonna...
- Oh, I'm gonna.

300
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,768
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Now!

301
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:45,454
Yeah!

302
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:47,414
Thank God, those bubbles are temporary.

303
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,332
That's right.

304
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,085
Your boy put an auto-timer
on the entropy bubble,

305
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:55,130
and in the process,
answered his own question,

306
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:56,965
a man can get a timeout!

307
00:20:57,758 --> 00:20:59,176
Am I a genius?

308
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:01,470
Never do that again!

309
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:06,057
I'll take that as a yes.

310
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:19,029
Oh, you guys are stellar!

311
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,782
Thank you. What did we just do?

312
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:25,994
Well, you saved me at least three weeks
in the proverbial salt mines of science.

313
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:27,579
At this rate,

314
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:31,166
the modified version of my pop's S.E.E.
could be up and running in...

315
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,542
A day or two.

316
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:34,878
A day or two?

317
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:38,006
Isn't there some way
we can speed that up a little?

318
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:40,842
There is, but Mom and Dad
won't change their minds.

319
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:42,635
We already did.

320
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:48,099
We're gonna give August organic speed.

321
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,352
Okay.

322
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,104
Oh, you're not kidding?

323
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:54,189
Where's Mom?

324
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:55,872
She's still
with the Speed Force.

325
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:57,442
They're both helping too.

326
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:58,819
What changed your mind?

327
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:00,277
My kids.

328
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:05,325
When I realized that their future
starts right now.

329
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:15,252
How exactly will this give me
my memories back?

330
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,712
The theory is
your artificial speed cells

331
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:19,548
have gone dormant.

332
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:23,885
But we believe that a speed boost
from Barry can jumpstart them

333
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:26,054
and give you organic speed.

334
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,807
And the harness should trigger the rest.

335
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,142
Hey.

336
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,938
Don't worry. It's gonna be okay.

337
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:39,401
Yeah. If this does work,

338
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:44,114
I'll try to come back... differently.

339
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,283
Good luck.

340
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:51,329
Are you okay?

341
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:55,625
If Dad is right,

342
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:59,254
and we're actually creating the future
by doing this,

343
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,924
everything from now on
could be different.

344
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,721
I know you don't have to do this.

345
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,642
So whatever your reasons are,
I know they're pretty important.

346
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:18,607
I just hope this works out.
For both of us.

347
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:21,651
Me too.

348
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,890
August! No!

349
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:53,558
Sorry, Cecile.

350
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,937
Turns out I like being the bad guy.

351
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:04,945
No matter what happens, stay here.

352
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:06,196
- What?
- Absolutely not!

353
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,114
Your mother and I have a plan.

354
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:55,495
At last, true speed for a true god.

355
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,918
You got what you wanted, Heart.
Now what?

356
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:05,130
Now you die, Flash.

357
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,675
By my hand.

358
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:20,645
No one's dying tonight, Heart.

359
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:24,190
But you are going to Iron Heights.

360
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:28,611
You'll have to catch me first.

361
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:31,781
Dad, be careful!
You don't know what he's capable of.

362
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:33,533
I will.

363
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:36,262
What do you need me to do?

364
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:38,913
You be my anchor while I concentrate.

365
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:56,222
<i>Heart's got organic speed,
he just reabsorbed all his clones.</i>

366
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:57,307
<i>Jay's right.</i>

367
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,101
<i>Until the excess speed burns off,
Heart could be faster than you.</i>

368
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:07,358
There can only be
one God of Speed, Flash.

369
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,034
This didn't work out
like you planned, Flash.

370
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:16,785
Now guess what comes next.

371
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:21,623
Tag. You're dead.

372
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:22,957
Dad!

373
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:26,211
- Bart!
- I know what I said. I know what I said.

374
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:27,962
But this is different.
This is different.

375
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:30,757
I am not going to let Heart
kill anyone that I care for.

376
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,883
Not now, not ever.

377
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:33,968
I believe you, son.

378
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:37,472
Now, we just met.
You have no reason to listen to me.

379
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:39,390
But we both know Barry, right?

380
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:43,645
And if he says to stand down,
no matter what, he has a reason.

381
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:44,896
But...

382
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:50,610
It's time to take our hats off, okay?

383
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:03,498
Now that you've leveled up,
what better time to feast?

384
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,173
Wait, is that Thawne?

385
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:13,758
It sure as hell is.

386
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:16,386
Miss me?

387
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:17,971
Save it, Thawne.

388
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:21,516
- You're back because of us.
- Right.

389
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:24,853
And in exchange, I've agreed
to help you take down a psychopath.

390
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:27,063
Flash! That was nuts!

391
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:29,774
You do like to party.

392
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:40,285
Joining forces with your worst enemy
just to take me down?

393
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:44,164
That's very flattering, Flash.
But it won't do you any good.

394
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:49,252
Don't you two get it?
You can't kill a god.

395
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:51,276
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

396
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:40,321
Thawne!

397
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,092
You could've killed him.

398
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,636
Wasn't that the plan?

399
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:08,057
Didn't you say you needed help
dealing with a threat?

400
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:10,643
Well, I dealt with it.

401
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:13,730
And now... And now...

402
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:18,359
it's just you and me, Flash.

403
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:21,487
I've been waiting for this moment...

404
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:26,868
For a long, long time.

405
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:29,120
I'm only gonna say this once.

406
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:33,624
Walk away. While you still can.

407
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:35,043
Allen.

408
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:38,046
You're too weak to stop me.

409
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,967
And I'm just getting started.

410
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:07,575
What did you do?

411
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:13,873
I created you.

412
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,542
I taught you everything you know!

413
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:20,421
Everything you are... is because of me!

414
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:21,714
What did you do?

415
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:24,092
I got faster.

416
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:27,303
Didn't you?

417
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,641
No.

418
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:36,562
But I will, Flash.

419
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:38,940
Mark my words.

420
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,527
I will.

421
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:56,165
How did you bring
Thawne back?

422
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:57,667
Well, the Speed Force did it

423
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,462
by connecting with the Negative side,
which is pretty dangerous.

424
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:04,215
So with Barry occupied,
I was the perfect choice

425
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:05,925
to anchor the Speed Force.

426
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:07,260
Wait.

427
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:10,638
Tapping into the Negative Speed Force?
Do I even know who you guys are?

428
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,432
Okay, but why Thawne?

429
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:15,143
Like, why not just
let us come help instead?

430
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:18,813
Sometimes, what makes a speedster
dangerous isn't just speed.

431
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:21,232
It's having no limits on
how they use it.

432
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:23,443
Right. Godspeed has no limits.

433
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:24,777
But Thawne?

434
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:27,447
His one limit
is he can't let anyone else kill me.

435
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:30,074
That's why I knew he'd turn on me
the first chance he got.

436
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:32,910
But, Dad, Thawne is still out there.

437
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:37,165
Yeah, and he'll be back someday,
but that's future us's problem.

438
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:38,583
What about August Heart?

439
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:40,710
He's in Iron Heights now.

440
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:44,297
But, Barry, he knows your real identity.
What if he talks?

441
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,048
Luckily, he's a speedster,

442
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:49,594
so Speed Force Nora was able
to remove that from his memory.

443
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:53,181
- It's finally over.
- Great.

444
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:54,849
Can we eat now? I'm starving.

445
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:56,476
Family dinner tonight? On Dad.

446
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,879
- Yeah, I would love that.
- That sounds perfect.

447
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:01,189
I'll get us a reservation.

448
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,108
Iris, hang on.

449
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:08,779
There's something I wanted to ask you.

450
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:10,740
Okay.

451
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:14,368
Um, ever since you came into my life,

452
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:16,370
I've been more
than just the fastest man alive.

453
00:33:16,454 --> 00:33:18,289
I've been the luckiest.

454
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:21,501
Marrying you was the best decision
I ever made.

455
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:23,544
Well, I agree.

456
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:26,255
And even though we're husband and wife,

457
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:29,342
you never really got
the wedding you deserved.

458
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:33,554
And these past few days when it looked
like I might never see you again,

459
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:37,850
I swore if I ever did,
I would make it up to you.

460
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:39,769
So...

461
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:44,273
Iris West-Allen...

462
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:48,361
Will you renew your vows
and re-marry me?

463
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:52,448
Yes.

464
00:33:52,532 --> 00:33:53,699
Yes, I will.

465
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:04,377
Oh, I'm obviously interrupting.

466
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,087
No, it's okay. It's good to see you.

467
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,047
- I should go.
- Kramer.

468
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:12,301
We haven't talked in a week.
How are you?

469
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:15,179
I don't really know how to answer that.

470
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:20,643
I just wanted to let you know
that my meta test came back positive.

471
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:22,728
So you are a speedster?

472
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:24,730
Yes. And no.

473
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:28,943
Adam was right. I should've died
in that bombing, but I didn't.

474
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:32,989
And neither did he because
he has immortal healing powers.

475
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:36,200
And so did I
when I absolutely needed them.

476
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:40,621
Just like when I needed super-speed
to save your life,

477
00:34:40,705 --> 00:34:43,374
I had it for just a moment.

478
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:44,542
That's incredible.

479
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:48,796
Turns out I can mimic the abilities
of any meta in close proximity.

480
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,549
Which sounds insane. But it's real.

481
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,926
Well, it's...

482
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:58,764
It's given me new perspective
on the path I took

483
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:00,975
as a member of law enforcement.

484
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:08,190
I'm so sorry, West. For all of it.

485
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:10,443
You lost your way a little,

486
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:14,697
but I always knew that your heart
was in the right place.

487
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,198
You just needed to find it.

488
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:18,951
Agreed.

489
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:23,706
That's why I'm taking an indefinite
leave of absence from C.C.P.D.

490
00:35:27,251 --> 00:35:28,669
Take care of yourself, West.

491
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:29,753
Kristen.

492
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:33,049
Call me Joe.

493
00:35:39,013 --> 00:35:40,222
Yeah.

494
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:49,482
Are you sure you're okay with me
being your plus one? Because...

495
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,067
Do not say his name.

496
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,735
Frost, I know...

497
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:56,405
He lied to me and then totally bailed.
I hate weddings.

498
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:57,698
Technically, this is...

499
00:35:57,782 --> 00:36:00,868
Okay, fine. A renewal ceremony.

500
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:05,623
Maybe we should renew our vows.

501
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:08,125
I'd marry you again in a heartbeat.

502
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,504
Aw... I love renewal ceremonies.

503
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:13,005
And weddings.

504
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:15,841
- Good to know.
- Mm.

505
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:22,723
Everyone, if I may direct your attention
to the stairs.

506
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,815
Hi, Daddy.

507
00:36:37,071 --> 00:36:38,739
- Nice entrance.
- Thank you.

508
00:36:38,823 --> 00:36:40,658
Now before we get
to the main event,

509
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:44,995
I know you two have asked us all
to keep it simple for this occasion.

510
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:49,542
But one of us couldn't resist adding

511
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:52,461
a little something extra special
to the festivities.

512
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:55,256
So without further ado, my man.

513
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:58,467
Thank you, Cisco. Appreciate it.

514
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:02,930
Mom. Dad. This is for you.

515
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,393
<i>Could you be that fine love?</i>

516
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:12,648
<i>That 1949 love</i>

517
00:37:15,443 --> 00:37:18,320
<i>The quiver in your spine love</i>

518
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:23,325
<i>That summer wine love</i>

519
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:31,500
<i>Just grab a warm body
And pick up the keys</i>

520
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:36,922
<i>You need somebody, somebody to be</i>

521
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:42,386
<i>You can't count on timing
And I'll just wait and see</i>

522
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:47,975
<i>I'll be that somebody
So settle for me</i>

523
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:58,068
<i>I'll give you all the affection</i>

524
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:02,239
<i>You've been craving</i>

525
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:05,951
<i>When you're ready</i>

526
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:09,246
<i>I'll be waiting</i>

527
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:15,169
<i>Waiting
Baby, I've got</i>

528
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:20,174
<i>I'll give you all the affection</i>

529
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:26,722
<i>Just grab a warm body
And pick up the keys</i>

530
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:31,685
<i>If you need somebody, somebody like me</i>

531
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:37,566
<i>You can't count on timing
And I'll just wait and see</i>

532
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:40,903
<i>I'll be that somebody</i>

533
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:45,241
<i>So, darling, if you're ready</i>

534
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:50,246
<i>To settle</i>

535
00:38:57,503 --> 00:39:00,089
- Bart. That was crash.
- Yeah?

536
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:06,011
- What? That's how you say it.
- No, no, just no, you say it weird.

537
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:08,138
Just do the thing, again.

538
00:39:09,223 --> 00:39:11,976
My fellow earthlings, today,

539
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,979
we are here to witness
the greatest sequel

540
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:16,939
since <i>Empire Strikes Back,</i>

541
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:21,610
as Barry and Iris renew their vows,

542
00:39:21,694 --> 00:39:24,989
and lend new meaning to the term
"relationship goals."

543
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:29,994
Now, I understand you both wrote
a little something for each other.

544
00:39:30,077 --> 00:39:31,662
If you'd like to share,

545
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:33,247
this is the time.

546
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:35,207
Iris.

547
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:38,002
Barry.

548
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:43,257
They say that love is a friendship
that's caught on fire.

549
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:46,969
But ours is a friendship
that was struck by lightning.

550
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:51,765
You and I are our own force of nature.

551
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:56,270
And I promise today...

552
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,900
To continue loving you
with my whole heart.

553
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:04,528
That was beautiful.

554
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,239
Good luck following that.

555
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:10,116
Iris.

556
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:13,078
Thank you.

557
00:40:13,162 --> 00:40:15,080
Ever since we met,

558
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:17,166
you've been my lightning rod.

559
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,919
But now that you're my wife,

560
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:23,505
you are my past, my present,

561
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:25,049
and my only future.

562
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:29,470
That's why today
I promise to continue loving you.

563
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:31,972
Now and forever.

564
00:40:34,183 --> 00:40:37,728
Okay, that was... That was decent.
Ten points for Gryffindor.

565
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:38,979
Now, then.

566
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:43,359
Ah, yes.

567
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:48,948
Do you, Iris, Bartholomew,

568
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:50,616
take each other

569
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:52,868
to cherish and to love

570
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:55,996
in good times and bad,

571
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:59,166
for all the days of your life?

572
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,752
- I do.
- I do.

573
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:03,295
- Again.
- Again.

574
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:05,547
Then by the power vested in me

575
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:07,758
by a last-minute Internet web search...

576
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:12,346
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

577
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:14,139
Again.

578
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:19,746
- Am I forgetting something?
- Yes, the kiss.

579
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,481
Oh, yes! Do the kiss! Do the thing.

580
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:34,243
Flashtime, huh?

581
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:36,328
Can you blame me?

582
00:41:36,412 --> 00:41:38,372
I want this moment to last forever.

583
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:46,396
