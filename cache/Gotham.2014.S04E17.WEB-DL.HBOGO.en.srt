1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,160
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,280
- Hello.
- What's wrong with you?

3
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,400
I let him out of his cage
and he helped me get out of mine.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,920
- You're him, the Riddler.
- Hi, Lee.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,440
Butch?

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,360
You're alive.

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,800
<i>Oh, Butch, I tried.</i>

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,600
Tabby, I'm gonna find a way
to get back to the old me. I promise.

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,480
<i>Tell me about your mother, Jerome.
Did she have any enemies?</i>

10
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,360
- No.
- Do you have any other family?

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,240
The circus is my family.

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,120
<i>Now, to free the rest of our cronies
and blow this pop stand.</i>

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,080
<i>I could have killed Jerome
after he kidnapped me and I didn't.</i>

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,720
<i>Any harm he does now,
I share a part of it.</i>

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,480
<i>I saw Jerome tonight.</i>

16
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,720
<i>He was looking for the name
of a school, St. Ignatius.</i>

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,360
Stay the hell away from that madman.

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,920
I'll see you at St. Ignatius, Jim.

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,320
Sir?

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Sir?

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,360
Can I help you?

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,240
My name is Bruce Wayne.

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,280
I'm looking for Jerome Valeska.
Has he been here?

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,720
I didn't have the pleasure
of meeting Mr. Valeska.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,240
However, I did speak with his friend,
the one with the top hat.

26
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,200
- Jervis Tetch.
- Yes, that's the fellow.

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,480
He was very polite.

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,400
What did he want?

29
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,400
The... the name of a student

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,680
who graduated in St. Ignatius
ten years ago.

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,840
Xander Wilde.

32
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,880
Fine young boy, very bright.

33
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,640
Did Tetch tell you
why Jerome was looking for him?

34
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
No.

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,200
But he did have a message for you.

36
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,840
Listen to me, you're being hypnotized

37
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,760
by Jervis Tetch.
You don't want to press that button.

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,360
But I have to. He's depending on me.

39
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,240
Bruce. Step away from him.

40
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
Please.

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,840
- Hand me the detonator.
- I want to.

42
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,920
But I can't.

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,000
Captain Gordon, look.
He's under Jervis's spell.

44
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,320
Get down!

45
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,440
{\an5}Hear ye, hear ye.

46
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,000
{\an5}I'd like to officially
welcome you all to our first ever

47
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,080
{\an5}mandatory brunch meeting.

48
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,440
{\an5}Now, I know what you're all thinking.

49
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,520
{\an5}Why have I gathered
this legion of Horribles?

50
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,440
{\an5}That has a nice ring to it.
Write that down, will you?

51
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,400
{\an5}Well, back when I was in Arkham,

52
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,040
{\an5}I came up with a plan
to turn this city into a madhouse.

53
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,600
{\an5}And now I am on the cusp
of making that happen.

54
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,360
{\an5}But I need help

55
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,600
{\an5}from all of... Put all questions
on ice until the end.

56
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,240
{\an5}<i>Danke schön.</i>

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,200
{\an5}Mr. Oswald.

58
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,360
{\an5}Thank you for doing your part
in hosting us today.

59
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,040
{\an5}- Anything for an old friend.
- Crane, where are we at with the...

60
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
"You know what"?

61
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,440
{\an5}It's coming along, dreadfully.

62
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,280
{\an5}Oh, pun worthy.

63
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,480
{\an5}Excellent. Freeze.
Ice Man, you're a science guy.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,880
{\an5}We're gonna need a lab, a big one.

65
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,600
{\an5}Easy enough.

66
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,280
{\an5}Now, all we need is Mr. Tetch
to return

67
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,640
with some very important
information and...

68
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,480
{\an5}Use the tongs, Carl!

69
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,520
{\an5}You still haven't told us

70
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,120
{\an5}how you're going
to take over the underworld.

71
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,240
{\an5}Who says I want to do that?

72
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,760
{\an5}I'm an artist.

73
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,720
{\an5}I just want to paint the town crazy.

74
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,240
{\an5}Once that happens, I could care less
how you Horribles rip the city apart.

75
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,080
{\an5}- I'm in. Let's do this.
- No.

76
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,520
Not yet.

77
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,520
Nothing can happen until we have
our one last essential ingredient.

78
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,240
The one thing that'll tie it
all together.

79
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,760
Who is Xander Wilde?

80
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
I don't know.

81
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,480
Did Jerome say anything
at his uncle's diner?

82
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,400
Anything that can tell us
why he's going after him.

83
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,880
If I knew that, Captain,
I would tell you.

84
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
Would you?

85
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,520
How can I trust anything you say?

86
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,760
I told you not to come here
and you did anyway.

87
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,000
Damn it, you could have been killed.

88
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,080
Yeah, all right, Captain.
I think you've made your point.

89
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,000
And you? Did you know,
he was going after Jerome?

90
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,760
Indeed, I did, yes.

91
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,680
If he gets involved
in this case again,

92
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,440
I'll press charges. We clear?

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,040
Come on, sir.

94
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
Yo.

95
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,920
I just talked to an administrator.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,440
Xander Wilde was some kind
of child prodigy.

97
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,360
Now, he's a hotshot structural
engineer at Meyer & Hayes.

98
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,800
What does Jerome want
with an engineer?

99
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,360
Maybe he wants him
to build him something.

100
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,480
Let's go.

101
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,600
I used to be a great whistler.

102
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,600
Yeah, hi.

103
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,040
I'm here to see Xander Wilde
and, no...

104
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,520
I don't have an appointment.

105
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,320
Don't bother going to security,
they're all...

106
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,440
headless.

107
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,240
All right, if you would all please
look at the rendering,

108
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,760
you'll notice that there are several

109
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,040
interesting engineering problems
that present themselves.

110
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Most...

111
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,320
Oh, don't get up.

112
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,680
I won't waste too much of your time.

113
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,480
I've got a business proposition.

114
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,960
Tell me what I want to know
and you don't get turned inside out.

115
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,680
- Please, don't, don't hurt anyone.
- Where is...

116
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,520
Xander Wilde?

117
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,480
He's... he's not here.

118
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,120
Yeah, I'm not blind. Maybe you are.

119
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
You know?

120
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,040
No one does.
He's never stepped foot in this

121
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,120
- office.
- Oh, okay.

122
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,880
We've... we've... we've never met.

123
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,080
I... I've only ever communicated
with him

124
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,840
through a proxy.

125
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,280
- A proxy.
- Yeah.

126
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,920
That slippery little sucker thinks
he can get away from me.

127
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,080
Where can I find this proxy,
pray tell?

128
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,840
I... I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

129
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,600
Jimbo! Ol' buddy, ol' pal.
It's great to see you.

130
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,720
Drop the gun.

131
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,560
Oh, you are such a stick in the mud.

132
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,040
Give it up, clown boy.

133
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,400
Hey.

134
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Knock, knock.

135
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,080
You're supposed to say,
"Who's there?"

136
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,680
-Thank you, Frances.
- Take down the statements.

137
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,040
Yeah. All right.

138
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,680
Hey, Jim. Same story all around.

139
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,000
No one knows Xander
no one even met him.

140
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,400
Apparently, he had a proxy

141
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,680
who handled his,
dealings with the company.

142
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,360
Hayes was the only one
who knew their identity,

143
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,160
but, obviously, he's not talking.

144
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,400
So we have to figure out
another way to find Xander.

145
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,120
I'm ahead of you. We looked into it.

146
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,480
No driver's license,

147
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,640
no known addresses, guy's a ghost.

148
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,040
Everything that's happened
in the last 24 hours

149
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,560
the breakout, Tetch.

150
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,720
It's all been about
Jerome finding this guy.

151
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,920
I don't think it has anything
to do with him being an engineer.

152
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,600
- This seems personal.
- Makes sense.

153
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,800
I mean, Jerome went to his uncle
to look for him.

154
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,160
Yeah, so, how are they connected?

155
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
What's up?

156
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,640
Is that Wayne Plaza?

157
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Take a look
at the initials of the engineer.

158
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,000
X.W. Xander Wilde.

159
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
Looks like we're gonna have
to go talk to the kid.

160
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,000
He's gonna be thrilled to see you.

161
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,480
What time is it?

162
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,680
Riddle time!

163
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,360
What time is it?

164
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,560
Riddle time!

165
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,160
That's right! It's riddle time at...

166
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,720
The Riddle Factory!

167
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,160
Our first contestant is...

168
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,280
Lars,

169
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,240
from the now-defunct biker gang,

170
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,960
The Street Demonz.

171
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,280
It's been a rough go
of it lately, Lars?

172
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,080
I've fallen on hard times.

173
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,760
But I'm damn happy
to be here with you, Riddler.

174
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,800
That's the Narrows spirit I love.
Now, you know the rules.

175
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,400
I ask a riddle.
You answer correctly, you ask me one.

176
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,120
You win them both

177
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,400
and you're walking out of here
with cold hard cash!

178
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,640
Lila.

179
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,600
Prepare the timer.

180
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,600
I am heavy forward,

181
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,760
but backward, I am not.

182
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,000
What am I?

183
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,800
Okay, I'm heavy forward.

184
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,160
Back... backward, I'm not...

185
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,960
<i>- You got this, Lars.</i>
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

186
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,080
Wait a minute.

187
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,960
No, no. I know this.

188
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's...

189
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,120
No, no. I know this.

190
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,760
<i>- Come on, Lars.</i>
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

191
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
Wait, wait, wait...

192
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,920
It's the hourglass.

193
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,840
The answer is ton. T-O-N.

194
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,080
Backwards, I am "not."

195
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,960
Sorry, Lars.

196
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,320
Spin the wheel! Spin the wheel!

197
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,200
Spin the wheel! Spin the wheel!

198
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,760
You hear them, Lars.

199
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,160
It's time to spin...
The Wheel of Misfortune.

200
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,080
Spin the wheel!

201
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,160
Spin the wheel! Spin the wheel!

202
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,920
Lila, please.

203
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,240
Spin the wheel! Spin the wheel!

204
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,520
Spin the wheel! Spin the wheel!

205
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,560
Spin the wheel! Spin the wheel!

206
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,760
My personal favorite.
Rabid Sack of Rats!

207
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,680
All right, that's enough! Enough!

208
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,280
Doc Thompkins.

209
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,080
What brings Your Majesty down
to our rabble?

210
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,320
How you doing, Ed?

211
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,840
Haven't seen you
since we put Oswald on ice.

212
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,960
Well, I'm doing far better
than Sofia Falcone,

213
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,360
from what I understand.

214
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,800
Whatever the hell this is, it's over.

215
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,280
I don't think so.

216
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,360
Ladies and gentlemen.

217
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,680
Our queen has just informed me
she wants to shut us down.

218
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,960
How do you feel about that?

219
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
You hear that?

220
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,440
That's the sound of democracy.
The people have spoken.

221
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,080
And my name is the Riddler.

222
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Okay.

223
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,440
You want to be entertained?

224
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,280
Hold this, will you?

225
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,120
Then I'll beat him.

226
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,040
You can't be serious.

227
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,320
You realize what happens

228
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,040
- when you lose?
- I know.

229
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
I spin the wheel.

230
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,040
But if I win,
you shut this place down.

231
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,800
Doc, Doc, Doc...

232
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,760
We have our next contestant!

233
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,200
Got any ice cream in there?

234
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,280
I've always had a soft spot
for Chunky Monkey.

235
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,240
I was wondering when you would come.

236
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,400
Me? That's very flattering.

237
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,400
So tell me, Little Miss Proxy,
where is he?

238
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,080
I'll never tell you.

239
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,480
I don't know.

240
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,440
See...

241
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,280
I can be very persuasive.

242
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,240
See that?

243
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,760
Yeah, I was wondering about that.

244
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,160
You got, like,
a big dog or something?

245
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,800
No, that's how
I'm going to transport you.

246
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,640
I've got him.

247
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,360
Butch?

248
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,160
I had heard you were different.

249
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,640
But I will be honest.

250
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,680
I like it.

251
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,160
What do you want?

252
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,800
I assume you've heard
about the Arkham breakout.

253
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,480
Well,

254
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,680
I just came from brunch
with Jerome Valeska

255
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,200
and let's just say
that he has plans for Gotham.

256
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,000
What kind of plans?

257
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,960
That part wasn't entirely clear.

258
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
They seem to involve a great
deal of paint.

259
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,160
No matter.
I have seen his kind come and go.

260
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,480
Jerome Valeska will flame out.

261
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,280
And in the rubble,

262
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,360
I will reclaim the underworld.

263
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,360
I could use a good man
like you by my side.

264
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,880
You must be all out of allies
to come looking for me.

265
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,200
Don't be modest.

266
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,600
With your brute strength
and my brains,

267
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,040
- we will be unstoppable.
- I did that job. I'm my own man now.

268
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Really?

269
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,520
Because from where I am,
you look like a man who has nothing.

270
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,760
You'd be wise
to watch what you say to me.

271
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,440
- I'm not the same man you remember.
- And neither am I.

272
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,760
Look at the two of us.
We used to run this town together.

273
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,480
We were friends.

274
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,520
Look, you want your old life back.
So do I.

275
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,240
- We are the same.
- Wrong!

276
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,760
You can have your old life back.

277
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,960
I can't. Look at me.
Tabitha will never love me again.

278
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,000
Slaughter Swamp turned me
into a monster!

279
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,560
Now, get out of here.

280
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,720
If I ever see you again,
I'll pop your head off like a flower.

281
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,080
Let me get this straight.

282
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,840
You tell us to stay out
of your investigation

283
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,320
and now you want our help?

284
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,400
- Subtle.
- We have reason to believe

285
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,200
your father met with Xander Wilde.

286
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,360
Well, if he did, he certainly
would have made a note of it.

287
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,720
What was the name
of the building again?

288
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,960
Wayne Plaza.

289
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,880
He was a meticulous notetaker,
Thomas.

290
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,640
He organized everything by project.

291
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,920
Let's see. Wayne Gardens.
Wayne Hospital.

292
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,040
Here we go.

293
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,000
Wayne Plaza.

294
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Right.

295
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,880
Oh, you're bang
on the money there, Captain.

296
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,600
Xander Wilde, says he went
to meet him to finalize the plans.

297
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,800
No address, just the name
of the street. Annesley Drive.

298
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,200
That's out past Buxton
by the old rock quarry.

299
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,800
This man must have been
very important if my father

300
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,600
went out of his way
to meet him alone.

301
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,520
I'm starting to think
he isn't just some recluse

302
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,480
hiding from the world.
He's hiding from Jerome.

303
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,560
How interesting.

304
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,080
Oh, you are incorrigible.
And then again,

305
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,800
you always were.

306
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,920
Oh, wait. Or was that me?
Sometimes I get so confused,

307
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I... I can't remember.

308
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,200
<i>You didn't have
to run away like that, you see.</i>

309
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,080
<i>I would never hurt you... Xander.</i>

310
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,080
<i>I love you.</i>

311
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,920
<i>Can't wait to see you!
Did you think about me?</i>

312
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,440
<i>I know that you did.</i>

313
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,160
<i>Oh, I'm gonna squeeze you
until you pop!</i>

314
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,800
Where the hell's the house?

315
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,320
James Gordon,
here to see Xander Wilde.

316
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,840
- So, this whole joint's underground?
- Mr. Wilde values his privacy.

317
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,120
How long has he lived here?

318
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,760
He finished construction
six years ago.

319
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,480
- Ecco. 496.
<i>- Welcome, Ms. Ecco.</i>

320
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
He'll see you now.

321
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,920
Thank you for seeing us, Mr. Wilde.

322
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,520
I expected you might come, Captain.

323
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,960
My God.

324
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,280
There's two of them.

325
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,720
May I put my hands down now,
gentlemen? Please?

326
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,600
Apologies, Mr. Wilde.
You took us by surprise.

327
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,960
That's understandable.
You can call me Jeremiah.

328
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,280
That's the name my mother gave me.

329
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,520
You solved her murder,
Captain Gordon.

330
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,680
I owe you a debt of gratitude
for that

331
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,000
and for putting Jerome in Arkham,
where he belongs.

332
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,280
He never mentioned you before.

333
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,920
No, I suppose he wouldn't have.
From the letters my mother sent me,

334
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,600
- he never spoke of me after I left.
- Left where?

335
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,840
The circus.

336
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,520
They hid me away
to protect me from him.

337
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,160
See, we were always different,
Jerome and I.

338
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,400
From an early age,
I showed a proficiency

339
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,160
for maths and design and Jerome,
mainly the mutilation of alley cats.

340
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,280
On my tenth birthday, he held
a cake knife to my throat.

341
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,440
A few weeks later,
he lit my bed on fire.

342
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,280
It was like living in a nightmare.

343
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,200
My mother knew eventually
one day he would succeed,

344
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,720
so one night, my uncle came
to my room while Jerome slept

345
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,920
and told me
that he was taking me away.

346
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,960
I had no idea where,

347
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,840
but I kissed my mother good-bye,

348
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,080
told her I loved her
and I never saw her again.

349
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,320
He took you to St. Ignatius.

350
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,960
Got a new name, a new life.

351
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,000
And I was finally able
to live without fear.

352
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,200
But in my heart,

353
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,440
I knew one day Jerome
would come for me.

354
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,400
Well, that day is today, pops.

355
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,040
We have reason to believe
Jerome knows where you are.

356
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,720
We need to move you
to a safe location

357
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,280
- until we can apprehend him.
- That won't be necessary, gentlemen.

358
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,920
I've spent the bulk of my life
preparing for this eventuality.

359
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,640
I am safest here in my home.

360
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Not anymore.

361
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,960
Jerome knows the name of your proxy.

362
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,480
He got it from your boss
just before he executed him.

363
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,600
I heard about Jerome
visiting Allen Hayes.

364
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
It's tragic.

365
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,640
But the proxy's name
I gave to Allen was a fake.

366
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,360
You're lying.

367
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,720
I beg your pardon?

368
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,120
Yeah, there's something
about this guy that's fishy.

369
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,880
The security cameras outside.

370
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,040
They were turned on.

371
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,880
So, why are the monitors in here off?

372
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,760
I don't see
why that's any of your concern.

373
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,640
Now, if you excuse me,
I'm a very busy man.

374
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,360
- Yeah, I'm sure that you are.
- Please don't touch that.

375
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,240
That's very sensitive equipment.

376
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,040
Oh, yeah.

377
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,680
I'd say that's pretty damn sensitive.

378
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,040
Ladies and gentlemen,

379
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,920
a gauntlet has been laid
at the Riddler's feet.

380
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,040
Our leader, Doc Thompkins...

381
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,880
she thinks that she knows
what's good for you.

382
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,240
She thinks stapling a live barracuda

383
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,960
to someone's face
isn't damn good entertainment.

384
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,920
- Just get on with the show, Ed.
- Okay. Enough! What time is it?

385
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,200
Riddle time!

386
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,800
- What time is it?
- Riddle time!

387
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
Lila.

388
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,720
Prepare the timer.

389
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,800
<i>Let's go, Lee!</i>

390
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,720
I can be broken...

391
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,280
without being held.

392
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,280
Given and then taken away.

393
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,920
Some people use me to deceive,

394
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,560
but when delivered,
I am the greatest gift of all.

395
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,640
What am I?

396
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
You stumped?

397
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,240
Of course, I am.

398
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,920
You're the Riddler.

399
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,120
So, you give up?

400
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,040
- No.
<i>- Come on, Lee!</i>

401
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,400
You're gonna give me the answer.

402
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,200
Really? How's that?

403
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,480
Because deep down, you want to.

404
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,960
Oh, so that's your plan?

405
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,720
To appeal to the inner Ed?

406
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,000
Well, you played the wrong hand, Doc.

407
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,760
Ed is gone

408
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,400
and I will not be manipulated by you
the way that dope was.

409
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
I didn't manipulate him.

410
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,000
- I helped him.
- No.

411
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,440
No, you lied to him.

412
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,760
You promised to fix him

413
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,560
and that pathetic dust might
believed you,

414
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,320
causing me to be locked
inside of his feeble mind.

415
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Okay, you have ten seconds left
to find your answer.

416
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,280
- So prepare to lose.
- But I know the answer now.

417
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,960
You just gave it to me.

418
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,080
What are you talking about?

419
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,840
You're right. I told Ed
I would fix him and I didn't.

420
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,240
I broke my promise.

421
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,280
And that, Riddler...

422
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,760
is the answer.

423
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,920
A promise.

424
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,640
Well played.

425
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,600
We're only halfway through.

426
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,760
And I assure you,
you will not stump me.

427
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,720
You need to take us to your brother.

428
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,440
I can't do that.

429
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,080
What if he's nuttier
than the other one?

430
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,640
I'm nothing like Jerome.

431
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,800
You want me to put you
in a cell next to his?

432
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,240
Because that is
where this is heading.

433
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,240
And then what, Captain Gordon?

434
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,080
You couldn't hold him.

435
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,560
Arkham couldn't. I can.

436
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,960
And I will make sure
Jerome never escapes again.

437
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,760
No, no, no. Jerome comes with us.

438
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,480
And if you want to make
this easier on yourself,

439
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,760
I suggest you stay
the hell out of the way.

440
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,680
The loonies are outside.

441
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
No. No.

442
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,440
No, no, no.

443
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,960
- How'd they find me?
- They must have followed Jerome.

444
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,440
We need to move, now.

445
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,040
This is not good.

446
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,320
- Is there another way out of here?
- Yes, but I'm not leaving Ecco.

447
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,600
The loonies will use her against us.

448
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,040
She's devoted her life to me.

449
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,520
We get you out first,
then we can come back for her.

450
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
Deal?

451
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,440
As a child, I was obsessed
with labyrinths,

452
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,760
so I designed my house like one.

453
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,000
- You mean this place is a maze?
- Easy enough to get in.

454
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,480
I'm the only one who knows
the way out.

455
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,400
Stay close to me.

456
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,240
The maze is built on a 100 acres.
There are 73 dead ends.

457
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,680
I once invited the top maze designers

458
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,240
in the country
to try to solve it... One did.

459
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,560
- It took him three days.
- And how much further?

460
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,880
Not far. We just passed
the final switchback point.

461
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,160
If I knew this thing was 100 acres,

462
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,800
I would have stopped
and got a sandwich before we came.

463
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
Ecco.

464
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,440
- Oh, thank god you're okay.
- Hey, hey, hey, she's hypnotized.

465
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,240
Ecco, it's me.

466
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,400
It's me.

467
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,320
Gordon! Help!

468
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,920
Gordon!

469
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,080
- She's a pistol.
- Come on.

470
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,800
Ecco, please.
Where are you taking me?

471
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,240
- I'm taking you to Jerome.
- No.

472
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,680
He'll do horrible things to me.

473
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,160
- Ecco...
- Stop!

474
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,160
Let him go.

475
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,640
- Thanks. He went that way.
- All right.

476
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
Jeremiah.

477
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,640
Now, let's try this way.

478
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,360
Hello, brother.

479
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,520
So, how you been? Oh, you look great!

480
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,680
To think I used to be
the handsome one, right?

481
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,960
How'd you find your way
through the maze?

482
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,040
Oh, bro,

483
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,040
we might not look the same anymore,
but we still think the same.

484
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,560
Plus, you used
to draw those stupid things

485
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,040
all the time as a kid.

486
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,280
I paid attention.

487
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,880
Hey, hat-head. Take Crane.

488
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,400
Find Jimbo and his bearded sidekick.
Kill them.

489
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,240
I've been waiting
for this moment for 15 years.

490
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,600
Ever since you ran away
in the middle of the night,

491
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,200
like a coward.

492
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,760
- You're insane.
- Yeah.

493
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,440
And I tried telling Mom,
but she didn't want to listen to me.

494
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
You blame me for everything
that's gone wrong in your life.

495
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,400
But the truth is, Jerome,

496
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,280
is you were born bad.

497
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,080
Born bad?

498
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,200
So that's why you made her think
that I tried to kill you.

499
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,080
- Right?
- Yeah, we both...

500
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,760
What was it again? What was it?

501
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,080
I put a blade to your throat.
No, no, no. I tried to...

502
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,320
- Light you on fire.
- We both know you wanted to!

503
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,320
Yeah, that was a funny story,
wasn't it?

504
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,840
Okay.

505
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,880
Maybe it didn't happen
exactly like that, but...

506
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,440
But I didn't have a choice,
and I was right.

507
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,320
You killed our mother.

508
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,200
She did deserve it though.

509
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,120
After that whore hid you away,

510
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,880
she gave up on me.

511
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,120
Poisoned by your stories.

512
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,800
You turned everyone
I ever loved against me.

513
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,720
My own flesh and blood!

514
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,720
Yeah, I guess
it's like what they say.

515
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,120
We all could go insane
with just one bad day.

516
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,840
I guess with you,
it's more like one bad spray.

517
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,120
You'll see.

518
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,600
- Listen to what I have to say!
- Oh, hell no!

519
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,880
You are not hypnotizing me again!

520
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,720
That's one way to do it.

521
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,960
Must go, must go, must go!

522
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,320
What are you gonna do to me, Jerome?

523
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,680
Come on. I'm gonna kill you.
Of course.

524
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,360
But, first,

525
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,480
I'm gonna drive you mad.

526
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,600
But don't worry, you won't be alone.

527
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,000
All of Gotham will be joining you,
too.

528
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,200
Must go! Must go!
They're after me and the Scarecrow.

529
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,920
These guys just don't give up?

530
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,080
Get any closer and I splatter him.
I splatter bro-ski.

531
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,640
No, you won't.

532
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,480
If you wanted him dead,
you would have killed him already.

533
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,680
He's right. I'll see you soon.

534
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,920
Okay, Doc.

535
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,160
You've had enough time
to think of a riddle.

536
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,320
I hope you've come up
with a good one.

537
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,600
- I have.
- Then ask away.

538
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,440
What three words are said too much...

539
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,680
meant by few,

540
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,400
but wanted by all?

541
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,760
That's your riddle?

542
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,360
You're kidding. Right?

543
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,000
- What's the answer?
- Easy. "I love..."

544
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,960
The answer is, "I love..."

545
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,160
- I love what, Ed?
- That's not my name.

546
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,680
- Then what's the answer?
- You tricked me.

547
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,880
You're trying to awaken a love
that isn't there.

548
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,960
If it isn't there,
then say the words.

549
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,080
<i>Say it.</i>

550
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,280
I won't say it.

551
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,480
<i>- Come on.
- Say it.</i>

552
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,920
<i>Say it.</i>

553
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Time's up.

554
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,560
Doc, Doc, Doc...

555
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,440
Thank you.

556
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,560
What did I say?

557
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,080
I can help you get Tabitha back.

558
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,360
I know how to reverse your condition.

559
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,160
Talk.

560
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,920
This barrel is from Slaughter Swamp.
It turned you into what you are.

561
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,640
Talk.

562
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,000
Professor Hugo Strange
is the one man who can cure you.

563
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,440
Join me and we will find him.

564
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,000
I thought I was gonna
be stuck like this forever.

565
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,240
You don't have to be, friend.

566
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,920
Okay,

567
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,720
I'll join you.

568
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,240
But you better deliver.

569
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,840
I'm not your friend.

570
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,880
I can live with those terms.

571
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,840
Why did you open your club
in the Narrows?

572
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,480
You could have set up shop
anywhere in Gotham.

573
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,480
You wanted my attention.

574
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,040
I came back here
because the people love me.

575
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,200
People didn't come here
because they love you, Ed.

576
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,480
They came for the money.

577
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,600
But I can give them what they want.

578
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,560
I just need your help.

579
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,080
Why would I help you?

580
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,240
Because I know what you really want.

581
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,720
You love me.

582
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,640
You've loved me all along.

583
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,080
You're wrong.

584
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,960
That was Ed.

585
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,800
Okay.

586
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,680
So do it.

587
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Kill me.

588
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,880
What's your record for how many banks
you've robbed in one day?

589
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,880
Three. Why?

590
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,880
I think you can do better.

591
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,680
You're playing a dangerous game, Lee.

592
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,360
I know.

593
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,240
It's all right, come on.

594
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,240
- Captain...
- It's okay.

595
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,960
This is Jeremiah Valeska,
Jerome's twin brother.

596
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,880
We need to put him
into protective custody.

597
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,040
Okay, follow me.

598
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,560
Thank you...

599
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,760
Captain Gordon. I wouldn't
be alive if it weren't for you.

600
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,520
Hell of a day.

601
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,040
What are you thinking?

602
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,760
Jerome told his brother his plan
was to turn Gotham mad.

603
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,760
How the hell
is he gonna do that, Harvey?

604
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,840
I don't know.

605
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,240
I thought it already was.

606
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,080
Damn.

607
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,440
Doesn't even
make me feel better at all.

608
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,160
Jerome, the test subject has arrived.

609
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,800
Little large for a test subject,
don't you think?

610
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,800
He is not your test subject.

611
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,520
This is Grundy.

612
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,680
He will make a welcome addition
to the team.

613
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,440
I like him. He's scary.
Good thinking, Mr. Oswald.

614
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,960
Nice to meet you, big fella.

615
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,520
- Test subject?
- Here to test your plan,

616
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,680
an unwilling businessman.

617
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:21,240
No, no, no please, please.
Please don't hurt me.

618
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,840
Oh, this...

619
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,920
won't hurt a bit.

620
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,880
Oh, we're gonna need
a lot more of this!
