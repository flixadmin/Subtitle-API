1
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:25,525
Okay, this is insane.

2
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,486
We need more Compound V!

3
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,114
- Absolutely.
- We need more Supes!

4
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:31,741
More Supes! More Supes!

5
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,034
More Supes! More Supes!
More Supes!

6
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,285
More Supes! More Supes!

7
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:36,370
Come with me.

8
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:38,164
What are you doing here?

9
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,249
But on the bright side,

10
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,667
I'm sleeping in a basement

11
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,170
beneath a pawnshop
in East Flatbush.

12
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,713
We never wanted that for you.

13
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:47,673
We all just have
Ryan's best interests at heart.

14
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:48,799
I want us to be a family.

15
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,384
They just flew me up
and showed me.

16
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:52,470
This house is fake, the
neighbors are fake, you're fake.

17
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,430
No, Ryan!

18
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:55,890
You have five minutes
to make your opening...

19
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,990
There's a
supervillain on your school campus.

20
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:14,950
You
hear the calls of distress.

21
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,119
You witness a violent display of superpowers.

22
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:18,245
What do you do?

23
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,122
I'm Sheriff Ed Flanagan,

24
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,792
and I'm here with Homelander
to talk about school safety.

25
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,336
On the first report
of an active supervillain,

26
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,880
a hero will immediately
rush to your campus.

27
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:30,257
But to stay alive
in the moment, remember,

28
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,469
stay calm and follow the law.

29
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:36,138
Lock all doors and windows.

30
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:40,851
Arm yourselves.

31
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:43,521
Your teacher should have
an authorized firearm.

32
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,734
But use whatever you can.

33
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:53,239
And wait for a hero.

34
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:58,327
Unfortunately,

35
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:00,079
the possibility
that you will experience

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,873
a supervillain attack grows
more likely every day.

37
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:05,376
But by having an action plan,
you can dramatically increase

38
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,877
your chances of survival.

39
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:10,130
And survival is all
that matters.

40
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:15,970
- Jody, where's my flag pin?
- How should I know?

41
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,347
Well, I can't go to this thing
without a flag pin.

42
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,933
Bob, before he makes
any decisions,

43
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,434
- just let me talk to him.
- One,

44
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,186
the president doesn't like you.

45
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,230
He used the word "standoffish."

46
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:28,274
And, two, he's decided.

47
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,317
He's declaring
a national emergency,

48
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,694
bypassing the FDA,

49
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,738
and authorizing Compound V
for use by law enforcement

50
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,490
- and first responders.
- Wait, Robert.

51
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,617
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- I wish I were.

52
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,911
Doses are going
for five million a pop.

53
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,538
Pentagon's got a big order in,

54
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,623
and ICE is next in line.

55
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,000
You can't release V
into the mainstream.

56
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,086
We're talking an avalanche
of Supes; it's suicide.

57
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,714
In one hour, I will be standing
at the memorial service

58
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,466
for the fallen heroes
of the House attack,

59
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,968
with my flag pin,

60
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,888
giving my thoughts and prayers,
and pledging

61
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,806
to keep America safe.

62
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,100
The best way to do that
is with Compound V.

63
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:04,894
Yeah, we know.
We were there. Remember?

64
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,812
Covered in
my chief of staff's brains.

65
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,939
Look, there was no terrorist.
It was Vought.

66
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,025
It's a fucking coup.

67
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:14,236
- A bunch of their guys died, too.
- To cover their own tracks.

68
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,157
For the record,
I agree with you.

69
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,700
And I hate this.

70
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:22,036
But you've got no proof.

71
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,704
Folks are scared.

72
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:26,290
If Vought took a shit
in the middle of Fifth Avenue,

73
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:27,541
they'd throw
a ticker-tape parade.

74
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:31,045
- Here's what we do have, Bob.
- Oh, let me guess.

75
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,838
A tape of me fucking
my kids' nanny

76
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,340
at her daughter's quinceañera?

77
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,301
Release it. Please.
I'm begging you.

78
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:41,055
A plum gig at Fox, and this
shithole in my rearview?

79
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:44,141
- Sounds dreamy.
- Okay, what if we got hard proof? A witness.

80
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:45,267
Anything.

81
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,603
If you could get
Jesus Christ himself,

82
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:50,856
or maybe Homelander
in front of a camera, sure.

83
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,858
I really am sorry.

84
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:31,522
I'm nervous
about driving in the city.

85
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:32,523
You'll be okay.

86
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,566
- The plan again?
- Okay,

87
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,151
drive straight to Gen's
in Sedona,

88
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:39,238
cash for gasoline, no hotels.

89
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,240
I don't want to leave you here.

90
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,117
I'll be fine.

91
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,748
The anxious boy? Really?
With the moist handshake?

92
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,209
- Mom, come on.
- Okay. Okay.

93
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:53,669
Um...

94
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,129
you need a new one.

95
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,423
I...

96
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,718
I'm not gonna wear it.

97
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,596
I don't care if you wear it.
I just want you to have it.

98
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,686
I love you.

99
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,396
I love you, too.

100
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,233
You be safe.

101
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,693
Okay.

102
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,406
Hey.

103
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:25,034
- What's going on?
- They've lost their minds.

104
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:29,121
The RPG releases an
electromagnetic pulse on impact.

105
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,957
- Should cut through Stormfront's plasma bolts.
- How sure are you?

106
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,292
It's a guesstimate.

107
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,461
So that's Stormfront.

108
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,713
And thanks to Starlight,
we know that Noir

109
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:39,048
needs only a fuckin' tree nut.

110
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,132
How about A-Train?

111
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:41,633
Got enough epinephrine here
to blow up

112
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,676
that motherfucker's heart.

113
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,386
Hey, we can't just
kill everyone.

114
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:47,139
That is exactly what
we're gonna do.

115
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,223
Listen, you heard Mallory.

116
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,975
She said all we need
is another witness.

117
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,727
Wile E. Coyote.

118
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,188
Always chases Roadrunner,

119
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,857
always with an elaborate plan,
always fails.

120
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:59,318
You know, I always say,
"Why do this, Coyote?

121
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,905
All you need is an AR-15,
and 'meep-meep' no more."

122
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,364
Exactly. See?

123
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,867
We're just gonna shoot
Roadrunner in the fucking head.

124
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:09,870
That won't stop Vought.
That-that won't stop Compound V.

125
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,205
If you kill these Supes,

126
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,956
then Vought's just gonna
make a thousand more.

127
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,542
- Yeah, and we're gonna top those cunts, too.
- Great.

128
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:18,796
So that's settled. We're just
supervillains now, huh?

129
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,130
Vought attacked
the country, Hughie.

130
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,381
Fuck 'em all.

131
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,636
What if I testify?

132
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,180
Escaped convicts don't have
a ton of credibility.

133
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,602
No, but maybe I know
someone who does.

134
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,813
Give us the day.

135
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,399
Hughie?

136
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,819
See you later.

137
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,905
Officials are still trying
to determine the perpetrator

138
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:47,282
of the capital attack, the
Department of Homeland Security

139
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,494
has issued a crimson
terror alert.

140
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:52,955
In Washington,
all government buildings...

141
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,582
- How's Noir?
- Unresponsive.

142
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,126
They don't think
there's brain damage,

143
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,044
but apparently it's hard
to tell.

144
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,296
So, Noir's a vegetable,

145
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,881
Lamplighter's
a charcoal briquette,

146
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,758
Starlight's in the breeze
somewhere, and you're,

147
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,426
- what, fine with it?
- Yes.

148
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,637
Because none of that matters
anymore because of this.

149
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:11,807
So far, no terrorist group has
claimed responsibility.

150
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,934
All right, so,

151
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,269
you didn't do this.

152
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,813
I wish I'd killed Vogelbaum.

153
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,982
- But no, it wasn't me.
- Right.

154
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,943
And there's no supervillains
on American soil.

155
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:25,362
- None that we know of.
- And that means...

156
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:28,907
it's Edgar.

157
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,535
Maybe. I mean,
he is pretty smart,

158
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:33,078
especially for his kind.

159
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,538
Compound V to members
of the military

160
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,747
and law enforcement.

161
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,709
Hey, smile.

162
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,335
This is good news.

163
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:44,965
Yes, there have been sacrifices,
but we are this close

164
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:48,093
to no more premieres
or paparazzi,

165
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:52,723
or screaming fans, or any
of that dancing monkey shit.

166
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:54,808
We have to make sure that
the right people get the doses,

167
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,228
but it is a whole new world.

168
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,397
What about the wrong people?

169
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,815
Couple of billion of them.

170
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:04,234
They're not just gonna
sit there.

171
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,486
Don't worry, silly.

172
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,906
Frederick had a solution
for everything.

173
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,330
Okay,

174
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,998
there's something
really important

175
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,666
that I've been meaning
to ask you.

176
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,545
Last I checked,
you are not 57 years old,

177
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:28,258
so, come on, why is it always,
always Billy Joel?

178
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,219
I'm 57 on the inside.

179
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,845
No, really. Please.

180
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,682
It was just the music
in my house growing up.

181
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,768
You know, I did some somersaults
to "You May Be Right"

182
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,396
that were pretty thrilling
to watch.

183
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:48,195
Butcher is right, you know.

184
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:51,531
We've already tried to
take Vought down the right way.

185
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,951
This isn't gonna work; this is
not gonna stop Compound V

186
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,870
- from getting out there.
- So it's hopeless?

187
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:59,998
Just kill 'em all,
let God sort 'em out?

188
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,208
I mean...

189
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,796
Then why are you even
helping me?

190
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,466
Why did you save me
at the Tower?

191
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,426
They were...
They were gonna hurt you.

192
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:13,720
Yeah, but, Hughie, you could
have gotten yourself killed.

193
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,139
I mean, after the way
that I treated you,

194
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:19,059
you had every reason
to give up on me.

195
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,395
So why didn't you?

196
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:27,484
I just... would never.

197
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,363
That's why I'm helping.

198
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,461
You were stupid to text.

199
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,673
Everyone's looking for you.

200
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,550
Where's Elena?

201
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,260
This is the guy?

202
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,306
Uh, I'm sorry...

203
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,725
Hi. Hughie.

204
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,519
He's even more of a twink
than in the photo.

205
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,189
I could split that shit
like dry firewood.

206
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,526
Big fan.

207
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,862
I need to ask you something.

208
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,740
It's a lot.

209
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,494
- I need you to testify.
- Testify?

210
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,496
On the record.

211
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,458
Against Vought,
against Homelander,

212
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,251
Stormfront, everything.

213
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,128
Why would I do that?

214
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,174
Because things are
really bad, and...

215
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,385
you're our last chance.

216
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,596
- Pass.
- Look, I get

217
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,140
- that it's dangerous.
- It's suicide.

218
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,475
But that's not the reason.

219
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,226
Well, then, what is?

220
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,896
I'm tired.

221
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,149
We're all tired.

222
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,151
But they're hurting people.

223
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:53,278
And sooner or later, they're
gonna hurt someone you love.

224
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,738
Am I talking to you?

225
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,741
Look.

226
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:06,792
I get that it's easier
to just disappear

227
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,043
inside of yourself.

228
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,295
Trust me, it's all I want to do.

229
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,130
But we can't, Maeve.

230
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,591
We can't.

231
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,468
This is a war now,

232
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,887
- and we...
- Shut the fuck up.

233
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:20,931
Christ, you...

234
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,392
Haven't I done enough for you?

235
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,272
Didn't I save your fucking life?

236
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:35,445
It doesn't matter what we do,
nothing changes.

237
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:44,871
Nothing ever changes
or gets better.

238
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,086
And I'm tired.

239
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,798
Just leave.

240
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,094
Go! Take your fucking twink

241
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,680
and get the fuck out of here!

242
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,766
Okay.

243
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,810
Come on.

244
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,201
Monsieur Charcuter, we need you.

245
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,453
Now.

246
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,541
He said he lives under
a pawnshop in East Flatbush!

247
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,585
- He has to be here.
- Hey. Let her in.

248
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,379
Fucking help me... Billy.

249
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,632
They took him.

250
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:38,884
They have Ryan.

251
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,594
Who's got him?

252
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,266
I appreciate you coming
all this way, Stan.

253
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:49,352
Well, I can't exactly be seen

254
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,772
with you at the Tower now,
can I?

255
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,274
- Fresca?
- No.

256
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:55,984
Thank you. Awful stuff.

257
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,281
So, you've had a chance
to look over our proposal?

258
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:04,534
He publicly confessed
to a sexual assault, Alastair.

259
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:05,952
And we've made
a substantial investment

260
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,787
in the Deep's rehabilitation.

261
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:11,333
Our internal research bureau
shows an impressive Q rating.

262
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:16,213
He's an asset to Vought
in these troubled times.

263
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,591
Oh. What sort of commission is
the Church getting these days?

264
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,801
40%? 50?

265
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:23,595
Sounds like you're open
to reinstatement.

266
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:24,930
That's fantastic.

267
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,391
What about A-Train?

268
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,645
You do need a speedster,
since Shockwave exploded.

269
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:32,854
Harder sell.

270
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,857
One has-been back is redemption.

271
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,360
Two is weakness.

272
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,195
Stormfront has problems
with him.

273
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:43,615
And at the moment,
I have to indulge her.

274
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:46,201
What's her problem with A-Train?

275
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:49,412
I understand that she was
among your grandfather's

276
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:53,500
first followers back when
the Collective was a start-up.

277
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,546
I can neither
confirm nor deny that.

278
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:04,010
Then your internal
research bureau knows exactly

279
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,680
what Stormfront's problem is
with A-Train.

280
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,975
Deep is still a win.

281
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,018
Shall I have Business Affairs
reach out?

282
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,062
- Please do.
- Let me walk you out.

283
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,411
Sons of bitches.

284
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,748
Okay, yeah.

285
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,210
Voilà. Uh, jambon-beurre.

286
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,170
Simple, but it's the
ingredients, you know?

287
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,589
- Thank you.
- Diet Coke

288
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,799
with Lime, right?

289
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,427
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

290
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,845
We've heard a lot about you.

291
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,808
Uh, I'm sorry, I-I wish

292
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,393
I could say the same.

293
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,812
Uh, you all close with Billy?

294
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,731
Yeah.

295
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:00,358
I mean... sure.

296
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,153
- Why the hesitation?
- Well...

297
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,906
Let's just say he ain't really
close to a lot of people.

298
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,951
You know?
Well, except you, of course.

299
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,953
I'm close to him.

300
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,789
- I am.
- All right, all right, lads, let's give her some air, eh?

301
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,458
Yeah.

302
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,919
So, Ryan ain't on
any of their social media,

303
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:22,756
which is good on one hand,
but it don't help us none.

304
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,841
- So, you think he's in the Tower?
- Not sure.

305
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,010
You stay here.

306
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:30,555
Rest up. I'm gonna go
do a little digging.

307
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,016
Hey, Billy.

308
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,603
I'm sorry, okay?

309
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,229
I have no right
to ask you to help me

310
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,648
after what I said to you, but...

311
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,984
Look, don't you worry,
all right?

312
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,236
I will find your son.

313
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,618
Thank you.

314
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,542
Fuck off, you lot.

315
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,383
What is it, Samantha?

316
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,677
Mr. Edgar, normally,

317
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,303
I wouldn't put this through,
but the man says

318
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,222
it's life or death,
and you'd know him.

319
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,682
What's his name?

320
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,225
William Butcher.

321
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,895
Hi, hi.

322
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,689
We've been having
a super fun time in here.

323
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,483
I've just been googling all
the names of the cats in Cats.

324
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,777
Can you believe Ryan
has never seen Cats?

325
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,612
What happened to your hair?

326
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,280
- Oh, nothing.
- Hey, buddy.

327
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,699
Sorry we had to leave you
all alone.

328
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,660
Dad's work can sometimes
get pretty crazy.

329
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,495
He hasn't been alone.

330
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,914
I've been here. I got him
all these dipping sauces.

331
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,291
You didn't want to play
Vought Tournament of Heroes?

332
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,543
I'm the main guy.

333
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,795
I was working on my states.

334
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:47,090
- Uh, states?
- Well, yeah, I write down all 50 states

335
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:50,468
as fast as I can
in either alphabetical order

336
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,095
or geographical order.

337
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:54,180
You're giving yourself homework?

338
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,850
Well, Mom says that learning
is a gift, so...

339
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,853
Mm-hmm. That mom of yours,

340
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,981
she sure does have
some cute little sayings.

341
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:07,610
Do you think maybe
I could call her?

342
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:09,946
Uh...

343
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,910
Hey, Ryan.

344
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,162
Ugh.

345
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,958
I get it. I would feel lonely,
too, if I was cooped up

346
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,837
all day by myself
in this West Elm Death Star.

347
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,674
- Mm-hmm.
- How about

348
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,676
we take a field trip?

349
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,511
What do you say, Dad?

350
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:36,890
Welcome to Planet Vought.

351
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,017
Have a super day.

352
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,022
Let's give
a warm hero's welcome

353
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,440
to Kashden,
who's turning five today.

354
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,025
Welcome to Planet Vought.

355
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,485
Would you like to try our new

356
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:51,654
Brave Maeve
Rainbow Veggie Burger?

357
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,615
Holy shit.

358
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,663
There you go, Maestro.

359
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,210
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

360
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,212
Hey.

361
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,631
Wait until you try the Big Homey
with bacon.

362
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,466
It's so good.

363
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:14,302
And-and the, uh,
and the Mocha Noir Shake?

364
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:17,305
It's amazing. And it won't be lumpy like your mom's.

365
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:18,681
Homelander?

366
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,308
Hey.

367
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,853
- Can I get a selfie?
- Ask the boss.

368
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,480
Kidding. Of course you can.

369
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:28,233
- Of course you can.
- Stormfront? I-I love you.

370
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,984
- Can I get a self... a selfie?
- Oh, sure.

371
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,402
One at a time.

372
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,779
- Homelander.
- Kids first.

373
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:33,905
I'm a huge fan.

374
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,365
- Can I get a picture?
- It's Homelander!

375
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,200
- All right. Hey!
- I love you! Homelander!

376
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,202
- Homelander!
- Hey, guys...

377
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,333
I want to go home.

378
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:51,506
Hey. You okay?

379
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:52,882
I want my mom.

380
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:56,302
Okay, I got you. I got you.

381
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,513
Thank you, everyone. Excuse me.

382
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,641
Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me.

383
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:04,853
Stay back, please. Please,
please, please. Just stay back.

384
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,105
Stay back. Thank you.

385
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:12,819
- New bling?
- Mm-hmm.

386
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:15,238
Donna got it for me.

387
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,532
Pretty sure she got it
at Duane Reade.

388
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,579
Oh, gosh. Moms.

389
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,250
The gift that keeps
on giving, forever.

390
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,504
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

391
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:34,007
Wh... No, it's-it's fine.

392
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,426
No, no. I'm an asshole
for bitching about my mom

393
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,303
when yours is...

394
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,098
My mom's not dead.

395
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,933
She's not?

396
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,102
Oh, it's just, you never
mentioned her, so...

397
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,271
She left when I was six.

398
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:51,900
Oh, wow. Shit.

399
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,568
I'm really sorry.

400
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,990
That's where Billy Joel
comes from.

401
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,659
She and I, we used to have
these dance parties.

402
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,078
She was, she was fun.

403
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,248
She made awesome Seven costumes
for Halloween.

404
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:13,212
And, uh, then one day, she just
left and never called again.

405
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,924
Not even a card.

406
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,926
You know, it was like
some silent alarm went off

407
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,595
and she was like, "Well...

408
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,473
fuck them, time to go."

409
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,808
No, I'm sure that that's not it.

410
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,727
What would you call it?

411
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,359
I guess that's why I always
just kind of hang in there,

412
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,029
no matter how bad it gets.

413
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,323
'Cause I...

414
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,700
I-I don't want to be like her.

415
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:48,665
That's kind of clingy
and pathetic, isn't it?

416
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,750
No. No.

417
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,669
It isn't.

418
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,295
At all.

419
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,424
What's up, shitbirds?

420
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,968
Jesus Christ!

421
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:05,431
What the fuck?!
What the fuck?!

422
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,266
- How did you find us?!
- Please.

423
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,977
I can cover the boroughs in,
like, three hours.

424
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,228
I went looking, that's all.

425
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,230
I'm surprised your heart
can take it.

426
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,482
My heart is just fine. Take
a step closer and I'll show you.

427
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:15,817
Hey, I saved your life,

428
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,027
asshole. And now
you're coming after us?

429
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:24,784
We're even now, bitch.

430
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,708
Holy shit!

431
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,626
Is this true?

432
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:36,504
- Everything makes a little more sense now, doesn't it?
- Where did you get this?

433
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:38,715
I didn't get it. Okay?
I was never here.

434
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,967
You got that shit on your own.
Yeah?

435
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:42,802
But wh... why-why
are you doing this?

436
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:44,137
'Cause I want back in.

437
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,639
So, I need her gone.

438
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:48,850
Fuck that Nazi bitch.

439
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,462
Would you ask Mario
if he could whip up

440
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,256
some of those Gruyère puffs?

441
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:22,675
Would you like an order?
They're worth the cheat day.

442
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:27,180
I assume you got a man
out there, with a clean shot?

443
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,848
More than one.

444
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,308
Then I'll skip
the fucking hors d'oeuvres,

445
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,186
if you don't mind, and we'll
just cut straight to it, yeah?

446
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:35,229
You mentioned on the phone
that you could help

447
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,148
with Homelander's son.

448
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,318
I must say, I'm not sure
what you mean.

449
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,362
That boy is your
only possible contingency

450
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,364
against Homelander.

451
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:48,534
Now, that contingency don't work

452
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,162
if they're off playing
Ward and the Beav.

453
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,456
I can fix that.

454
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,252
Thank you, Alvin.

455
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,839
Homelander's a friend.

456
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,925
Why would I betray him?

457
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:06,677
Because you're
a ruthless bastard.

458
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:10,556
That's hurtful.

459
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,141
You turned a racist
piece of shite

460
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,143
into America's sweetheart.

461
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,395
What word would you use?

462
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,281
Stormfront's good
at making people angry.

463
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,992
Angry people want Compound V.

464
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:32,578
Compound V
raises our stock price.

465
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,123
Look, I'd have preferred
V remained a secret,

466
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:38,084
but we play with the cards
we're dealt.

467
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:41,420
It's not ruthless,
it's prices per share.

468
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,047
That's all.

469
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:46,050
Maybe you should take a look
in the mirror, mate.

470
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,177
'Cause that bitch
should bother you.

471
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,721
Of course she does.

472
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,599
But it's not about me.

473
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:55,518
I can't lash out

474
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,397
like some raging,
entitled maniac.

475
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,482
That's a white man's luxury.

476
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:06,404
So, it's just business,
then, eh?

477
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,323
When, Mr. Butcher, in history,

478
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:12,410
has it ever been
about anything different?

479
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:15,246
And what makes you think

480
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:18,416
that you can control
that racist bitch?

481
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,836
Look,
I've got to get across town...

482
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:24,213
Look, I can get the boy away
from Homelander, all right?

483
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:25,923
How?

484
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:28,968
That's my business.

485
00:24:30,344 --> 00:24:33,931
When I got him,
I'll call your people,

486
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,516
they zero in
on this cell signal,

487
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:37,685
and then come and scoop him up.

488
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,854
And then you
do a better fucking job

489
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,480
of hiding him this time, yeah?

490
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,984
You have my word.

491
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:47,028
I will get Rebecca and Ryan
somewhere safe.

492
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,446
No.

493
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,907
Not Becca.
Becca stays with me.

494
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,992
But that's the whole point.

495
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:55,286
That he's raised by his mother.

496
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,621
Find him a new fucking mum.

497
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,415
I'm taking my wife back.
That's the deal.

498
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:03,085
And what happens when Rebecca
shows up on my doorstep,

499
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:06,005
begging to be reunited
with her boy?

500
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:11,385
You say it's the only way

501
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:14,430
you can guarantee Ryan's
protection from Homelander.

502
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:17,391
'Cause as you know,

503
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:20,770
a mother will do anything

504
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:23,022
to protect her son.

505
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:26,776
And you call me
a ruthless bastard.

506
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:29,403
You tell me where he is...

507
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,323
and I'll do the rest.

508
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:48,965
Where's Ryan?

509
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,342
He's, um, he's inside.

510
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:52,885
He doesn't want to talk.

511
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:55,012
- So, go in anyway.
- No, no, no, no. I've tried.

512
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,139
He... he wants to be left alone.

513
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:59,183
You are the strongest man
in the world,

514
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:02,436
and you're scared
of a little boy.

515
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:03,896
He's your blood.

516
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:06,565
Just talk to him.

517
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,609
Be the man I know you are.

518
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:13,447
New York. North Carolina.

519
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:17,076
North Dakota. Ohio.

520
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:21,330
Oklahoma. Oregon.

521
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:25,543
I'm sorry.

522
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,336
No, no, no, no. Buddy,

523
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:28,754
don't you be sorry.

524
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,506
I... I should've known better.

525
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:38,931
There were just...
so many people.

526
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:40,975
Yeah, there was.

527
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:53,446
You know, I remember
the first time I was in a crowd.

528
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,489
Probably didn't bother you.

529
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,283
I was terrified.

530
00:26:57,325 --> 00:27:00,036
All these people staring at me

531
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:02,079
and reaching out,
trying to grab me,

532
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,706
and egging me on
to use my powers.

533
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:07,835
I just... I felt
like I was... drowning.

534
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:10,671
Well, what'd you do?

535
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:12,965
Well, I took off.

536
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:16,886
I flew away.

537
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,805
They found me 80 miles
down the I-9.

538
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,724
Crying my little eyes out.

539
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:28,314
You? Cry?

540
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,527
Yes.

541
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:41,535
But I'm a man,
so, not in a long while. But...

542
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:44,246
who knows, maybe, uh...

543
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,916
maybe next time,
you'll fly away.

544
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:49,960
Maybe... with me.

545
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:55,925
Look...

546
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:58,386
I know you want me
to be like you.

547
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,179
But, Dad, I'm not.

548
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:08,396
Son...

549
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:12,316
I didn't just wake up one day
and fly out the door.

550
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:15,111
That's not how it works.
I had to learn.

551
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:17,113
Only I didn't have anyone
to teach me,

552
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:20,366
'cause the doctors that... um...

553
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:23,452
The people that raised me,

554
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,913
uh, were scared of me,

555
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:27,915
so they kept their distance.

556
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:31,210
And I had to figure it all out
by myself, see?

557
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:33,921
Well, you-you don't have
to go through any of that.

558
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:35,923
I'll teach you.

559
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,716
Really?

560
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,178
I love you.

561
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,285
Hey, did you find anything?

562
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,288
They got him in a cabin
up in Rochester.

563
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:10,416
- What?
- I mean... Becca!

564
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:13,002
She's great.
We-we talked earlier.

565
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,962
And, um, she's-she's
really great. She's...

566
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:17,214
- You're really... you're great.
- All right, easy, tiger.

567
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,133
How'd you get on?
I guess you got fuck all?

568
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:22,553
No witnesses. But we definitely
found fuck all.

569
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:25,097
I'm not sure I'm using that term
properly, but, uh...

570
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:27,141
here.

571
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,187
Fuck me.

572
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,063
This is a jackpot.

573
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,774
Well done, you two.

574
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:37,985
This'll do nicely.

575
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:39,570
All right, listen up, you lot.

576
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:41,197
Getting the kid back,
it ain't your fight,

577
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,781
and I ain't gonna ask you
to come along.

578
00:29:42,823 --> 00:29:45,784
Lick my big black balls,
Butcher.

579
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:46,994
Sorry, Becca.

580
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:48,579
You done asked us to lie,

581
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:52,124
spy, do all kinds
of fucked up shit for you.

582
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,418
Now we finally get a chance
to do something good,

583
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,462
and you think we're gonna
take a pass on that?

584
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,047
We're in.

585
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,715
Of course we're in.

586
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,052
All right.

587
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:05,638
Let's get a shift on.

588
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,377
What?

589
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:39,088
You remember the range
at Fort Bragg?

590
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,382
I was a better shot than you.

591
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:45,010
Well, you had a bloody
good teacher, didn't you?

592
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:47,429
I like your friends.

593
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,890
Especially Hughie.
He's, uh...

594
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,308
He's good for you.

595
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:55,896
Look, Becca...
you ain't coming with us.

596
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:57,356
Bullshit.

597
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:59,066
Ryan doesn't know you,
he'll never come to you.

598
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:01,193
It's too dangerous, and I ain't
gonna lose you again.

599
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:03,362
He's my son, and I'm coming.

600
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:15,541
I need you
to promise me something.

601
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:18,544
I need you to promise me
that you will save him

602
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,921
no matter what
and you will get him back to me.

603
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,050
Yeah. Of course.

604
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:26,552
You realize this isn't
just about me, right?

605
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:28,512
Like, h-he can't grow up
like Homelander.

606
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,389
You have to think
of all of the people

607
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,267
out there that he would...

608
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:38,981
Swear to me, then.

609
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:41,025
You swear to me
on your brother's soul.

610
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:48,490
I swear to you.

611
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:51,952
I swear to you on Lenny's soul.

612
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,916
- Okay. Okay.
- All right.

613
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,450
I can use your help
loading the car.

614
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:41,418
What if it happens again?

615
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,879
When I see Stormfront...

616
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:45,547
Stormfront...

617
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,217
what if I freeze?

618
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,721
"Freeze," yes?

619
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:54,390
Sorry, I'm still learning.

620
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:57,643
Look.

621
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,774
If there's one thing I know,

622
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:07,778
it's that you can
take care of yourself.

623
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:13,450
So when the time comes,
you'll know what to do.

624
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:19,456
Let's go.

625
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,964
Keep going. You got it.

626
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,924
That's it, don't give up.

627
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:31,260
That's it, that's it.
Keep going.

628
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:35,097
Little more, little more,
you got it.

629
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,602
Oh... hey, that's okay.

630
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:43,063
You'll get it,
you'll get it. Um...

631
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:46,525
I know what.

632
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:49,153
Um, imagine, um...

633
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:53,073
Well, sometimes it helps to
imagine someone you hate. Okay?

634
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:55,534
So, try that.

635
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:57,286
But at home,

636
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,872
when I say "hate," I have to put
a quarter in the swear jar.

637
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,290
Well, there's no swear jar here.

638
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:05,002
So, you can hate away.

639
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,712
But I don't really hate anyone.

640
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:08,255
Aw, well,

641
00:34:08,297 --> 00:34:10,924
that is very sweet, Ryan.

642
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:14,136
But it's not something
we can afford.

643
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:15,971
We're under attack.

644
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:17,806
We are?

645
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:21,894
Bad guys want to hurt us just
'cause of what we look like.

646
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,896
They want to wipe us
from this Earth,

647
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:26,940
just because of the color
of our skin.

648
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:30,819
Really?

649
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:34,072
It's called white genocide.

650
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:38,410
And we're gonna need people
like you to protect our kind.

651
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,746
Hmm. All right.

652
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:42,456
So, let's try again.

653
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:44,458
Go for it. Imagine, uh...

654
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,168
You got to be
fucking kidding me!

655
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,544
What?

656
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,005
What?

657
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:02,100
Are you sure this'll work?

658
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:03,519
Don't worry, it will work.

659
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,312
This is nothing
compared to the raves

660
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:07,064
I used to set up in Algiers.

661
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,690
Do you dance?

662
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,150
Of course I dance.

663
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:12,027
What is the point of life
without dancing?

664
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:17,157
She's on the move.

665
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:24,748
I see her, Frenchie.
We got to go now.

666
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,667
- You close?
- Un moment, mon ami.

667
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,460
- Holy shit. It just broke.
- Stunning news coming out of Vought Tower

668
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:30,921
in New York City,
concerning Stormfront

669
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:34,049
and alleged Nazi ties.

670
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:35,843
Stormfront may be 100 years old.

671
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:39,972
What's even more incredible,
we have authenticated photos

672
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:42,766
showing Stormfront
with Nazi High Command,

673
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:45,227
including Goebbels and Goring.

674
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:49,064
Based on the photos, it is now
believed that she was the wife

675
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:51,441
of Frederick Vought,
who was of course the founder

676
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,943
of Vought International.

677
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:55,821
Already, an intense
international outcry

678
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:57,573
has emerged, under...

679
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,157
I can't believe I
actually have to say this,

680
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,119
this day and age,
but Nazis are bad.

681
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:10,794
It's catchy.

682
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:16,049
- You ready?
- Oui.

683
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:33,191
But the question now is how can
we possibly let Vought release

684
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:37,362
Compound V in light of this
unprecedented malfeasance?

685
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:39,156
- What's "malfeasance"?
- A Nazi in Seven Tower?

686
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,325
- Uh, it's a...
- Was she part of the attack...

687
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:42,659
Never mind.

688
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,786
Aah!

689
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,622
- What's happening?
- Don't know.

690
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,415
Stay here.

691
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,129
Now!

692
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,982
Ryan! Hey! Hey.

693
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:16,985
Hey. Hey. Bud. Hey.

694
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:19,279
- Mom? Mom...
- It's me.

695
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,864
- Come here.
- Mom, Mom. I'm so sorry.

696
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,532
I didn't mean anything I said.

697
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:23,992
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean any of it.

698
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:26,161
It's okay.

699
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:27,996
- We got to go.
- I love you so much.

700
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,958
You're okay.
We're gonna go, okay? Come on.

701
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,417
Who's that?

702
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,088
That's my husband.

703
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,006
It's all right.

704
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:39,925
Come on.

705
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:40,968
I got you.

706
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:44,805
Come on.
To the car, this way.

707
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:05,033
What the fuck?

708
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,369
What the hell

709
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,204
are they doing back here?

710
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:12,457
Butcher, this wasn't the plan.

711
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:14,084
What's going on?

712
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,460
What's wrong?

713
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,879
Take my car,
get them both to Mallory.

714
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,297
Get them both safe.

715
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,674
No, no.
That's not part of the plan.

716
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:22,009
The plan just changed.

717
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,719
M.M., you're the only one
I trust with 'em.

718
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,637
Hey. What's happening? No.

719
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:28,598
M.M.'s gonna take you
to a woman with the CIA.

720
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,434
What? No, you have
to come with us.

721
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,894
I cut a deal with Stan Edgar.

722
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,816
What?

723
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:40,360
I cut a deal that when I got
Ryan, that I would call Vought.

724
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:42,195
They were gonna
come and take him away,

725
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,948
and that you'd never
fucking see him again.

726
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,242
What?

727
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,705
But fuck me, I-I couldn't do it.

728
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,713
- Bedroom's clear.
- Kitchen's clear.

729
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:02,299
- All rooms secure.
- Mr. Butcher?

730
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,301
You here?

731
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:17,981
Did I hear you say "Butcher"?

732
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:20,692
What's going on?

733
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,277
Do you have the boy?

734
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,587
Where's my son?

735
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:47,385
Where is my son?!

736
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:50,847
I'm not... I'm not leaving here
without you. I don't care.

737
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,974
I was gonna sell you out.

738
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,643
I fucking well
might do it again.

739
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:56,978
You didn't, though.
You didn't and you won't.

740
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,897
You can't have a cunt like me
around that kid.

741
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:01,358
I don't want to
pass my shit on to him.

742
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,443
Don't say that.
You have to come with us.

743
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:05,779
- You raise him right. You fucking raise him right.
- No. Don't say that.

744
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:07,072
And I'll make sure
they never find you.

745
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:09,449
Don't you say that!
Stop it. Stop.

746
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:12,244
- You have to come with us.
- Becca, we are out of time.

747
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:14,871
Please.

748
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,666
You got to let me do this.

749
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:20,210
You got to let me do
this one fucking thing.

750
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:24,232
Becca!

751
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:35,535
There you are,
you slippery little bitch!

752
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:38,705
I'm assuming it's you who sent
all those lies to the press.

753
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:39,998
They're not lies.

754
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,459
The pictures are
clearly deepfakes,

755
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,419
and you're a lying slut.

756
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,927
Okay.

757
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:54,971
Come here.

758
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,557
People love what I have to say.

759
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,643
They believe in it.

760
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:03,813
They just don't like
the word "Nazi," that's all.

761
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:06,024
Are you all right?

762
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:07,859
- You all right? Yeah?
- Ryan. Ryan, Ryan.

763
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:11,529
- Ryan. Ryan!
- Ryan. Come here.

764
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,326
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

765
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:18,328
Go. We'll hold her off.

766
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,871
You're okay.

767
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,418
What about the truth?

768
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,879
What truth?

769
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:30,215
What is the truth?

770
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:48,483
And what are you laughing at?

771
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,326
She says the truth is,

772
00:42:58,368 --> 00:43:01,663
she's gonna stick her boot
up your Nazi kitty.

773
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:17,929
Annie!

774
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:19,597
Come on, the RPG!

775
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,766
It's in the car!
It's our only chance!

776
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:18,615
Hey, Kraut.

777
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:54,150
Eat my shit, you Nazi bitch!

778
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,027
Die, you bitch!

779
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:57,654
Girls do get it done.

780
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,406
Yeah!

781
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:03,243
Bitch!

782
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,631
Are you okay?

783
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:17,632
Yeah.

784
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,540
Come here, Ryan.

785
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:52,417
Not on your life.

786
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:58,923
You're not like her, Ryan.
You belong with us.

787
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:00,925
Stay the fuck away from my son!

788
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:02,218
We love you, Ryan.

789
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:09,392
You fucking bitch.

790
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:12,562
Stop! Stop it!

791
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:14,856
Stop, please.
Stop it!

792
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:16,649
Stop, you're hurting her.
Just let her...

793
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:19,068
Stop it!

794
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,654
Stop, you're hurting her. Just let her go.

795
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:25,033
Let her go!

796
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:28,077
- Stop!
- Look at me.

797
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,787
I like to see the light go out.

798
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:31,206
Stop!

799
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:23,091
I'm sorry.

800
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:24,676
I'm sorry, Mom.

801
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:31,266
No. No...

802
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,310
No. No, no, no.

803
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,896
Hold on.

804
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:38,898
I'm sorry.

805
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,985
Help us!

806
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:45,363
Somebody help us!

807
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:52,662
It's not his fault.
It's not his fault.

808
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:54,372
You make sure he knows that.

809
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:56,833
He, uh...

810
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,627
He's good. He's good.

811
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:04,632
He's good.

812
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,887
You promise me you'll
keep him safe.

813
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:52,180
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

814
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,980
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean it.

815
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:02,065
Mommy.

816
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:03,858
Mom.

817
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,110
Mom, please.

818
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:22,960
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry...

819
00:49:57,829 --> 00:49:59,330
Ryan?

820
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:03,084
Did you do this?

821
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:06,087
I didn't mean to.

822
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:11,634
Let's go.

823
00:50:17,432 --> 00:50:19,767
Come here.

824
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:25,732
Come.

825
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:32,280
Ryan... Ryan.

826
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:34,323
Come here.

827
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,042
No.

828
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,601
He's mine.

829
00:51:03,895 --> 00:51:07,440
What, are you gonna
blow yourself up...

830
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:10,693
to save the little shit
who fucking murdered your wife?

831
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:17,450
I promised.

832
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:21,621
- Have it your way.
- Stop.

833
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:28,878
What are you doing here?

834
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:33,841
You're gonna let them go.

835
00:51:36,052 --> 00:51:37,678
And if I don't?

836
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:41,599
- Please!
- Don't die with them.

837
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:45,061
Let them go.

838
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,897
- Maeve!
- You're gonna stop hunting Starlight,

839
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:50,775
you're gonna leave
me and Elena alone...

840
00:51:50,817 --> 00:51:52,193
Take my daughter!

841
00:51:52,235 --> 00:51:53,986
Or I release this.

842
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,615
If you do that...

843
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:02,245
I'll destroy everything

844
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,455
- and everyone.
- Great.

845
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:06,624
As long as everyone sees

846
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:09,293
what a fucking monster you are.

847
00:52:10,962 --> 00:52:12,505
As long as no one

848
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:15,007
ever loves you again.

849
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:25,059
Homelander! Homelander!

850
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:26,477
Homelander!

851
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:29,689
Homelander! Homelander...

852
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,690
We believe that Stormfront

853
00:53:12,732 --> 00:53:16,402
was the sole perpetrator
of the attack on Washington.

854
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:19,822
In the light
of Stormfront's atrocities,

855
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:24,535
the release of Compound V has
been placed on indefinite hold.

856
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:26,996
Homelander?

857
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:28,664
Mr. Edgar,
we have a follow-up question.

858
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:36,505
Thanks to the heroism
of Queen Maeve and Starlight,

859
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:38,883
Stormfront has been neutralized,

860
00:53:38,925 --> 00:53:42,303
and is being held
in an undisclosed location.

861
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:45,890
I would personally like
to apologize to Starlight,

862
00:53:45,932 --> 00:53:49,810
who was wrongfully accused
of sabotage and conspiracy.

863
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:52,021
Welcome back to the team.

864
00:53:52,063 --> 00:53:55,608
And I know that you and Maeve
are two of the best,

865
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:58,986
most loyal friends
that I could ever have.

866
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:01,822
We are your heroes.

867
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:04,659
We are here to serve
and protect you.

868
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:08,412
Stormfront's violation
of that special relationship,

869
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:12,291
of that trust, is unacceptable

870
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,877
and she will be punished.

871
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:17,296
Justice will be served.

872
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:30,685
Justice will be served.
She will be punished.

873
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:34,939
As the leader of The Seven,
I give you my word,

874
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:37,566
no one will ever...

875
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:41,862
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

876
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:44,323
Always happy to see you, sir.

877
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:45,533
I'm afraid we had

878
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:48,202
an incident at the Archives.

879
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:51,414
Someone broke in
and stole PDR on Stormfront.

880
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:54,125
Hmm. PDR?

881
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,334
Private data reserve.

882
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:58,963
No one saw the thief come or go.

883
00:54:59,005 --> 00:55:02,383
Isn't that right, A-Train?

884
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:05,970
That was you? Dude.

885
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:08,097
I didn't know, sir. Fuck him.

886
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:10,099
- I would never go behind your back.
- Please,

887
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:13,519
- just let me explain.
- I think it showed initiative.

888
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:16,355
Stormfront's been critical
of the Church for a long time,

889
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:19,734
and Vought needs to take a firm
anti-Nazi stance right now.

890
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:21,360
Wait.

891
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:24,363
- D-Does that mean...
- I just spoke to Stan Edgar.

892
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:25,865
You're back in.

893
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:27,867
- Fuck yeah!
- What? Yeah!

894
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:29,910
Yeah! A-Train is back, baby!

895
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:31,662
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

896
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:33,456
- All right!
- Whew!

897
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:36,125
- Finally!
- Yeah.

898
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:39,378
I'm back too, right?
Right? I'm anti-Nazi.

899
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:43,215
I'm sorry, Deep,
but they only had one slot.

900
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:45,885
One hero is redemption,
two is weakness.

901
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,303
So they took him?

902
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,305
Fuck yes, they did!

903
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:52,141
Well, shit! Peace out, bitch!

904
00:55:52,183 --> 00:55:53,809
Ha ha!

905
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:58,064
You have to be patient, Deep.

906
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,566
We'll get you into a few more
courses, up to Level Seven.

907
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:02,193
No, I don't want to pay
for any more fucking courses!

908
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:03,694
Deep, please calm down.

909
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:05,446
I signed over my bank account
to you.

910
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:07,990
I filled out all those
fucking children's workbooks!

911
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:11,243
I married some weirdo
who gives terrible blowjobs!

912
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:14,622
I-I did everything you asked,
and when I found out that

913
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:16,916
we're all just fucking
space spores, I didn't laugh.

914
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:18,834
I did everything you asked.

915
00:56:18,876 --> 00:56:20,878
Because you said you'd get me
back in The Seven.

916
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,297
- You fucking promised.
- I'm sorry, Deep,

917
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:25,758
but you are acting
like a toxic personality.

918
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,426
I think you should leave.

919
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:34,767
Fuck Fresca.

920
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:44,193
Look at you.

921
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:46,987
I know. I know...

922
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:50,908
But if Billy Butcher
can do the right thing,

923
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:55,621
then there's got to be
some kind of higher power.

924
00:56:57,665 --> 00:56:59,500
You know?

925
00:56:59,542 --> 00:57:03,254
Are you sure it's safe for you
to go back into the Tower?

926
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:05,256
No.

927
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:08,342
No, I'm not. But...

928
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:11,095
If you jump ship
and you let the assholes steer,

929
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:15,099
then you're part of the problem.

930
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:18,686
- And...
- Hmm.

931
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:22,481
Someone taught me something
about hanging in there.

932
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:38,414
I've been thinking
about that lately...

933
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,958
the hanging in there.

934
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,378
And I think maybe I am
too clingy.

935
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:46,463
- No, you're not.
- Sticking with people

936
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:49,341
just because I'm terrified
of losing them?

937
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:50,759
I-I...

938
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:54,221
I can't do that anymore.

939
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:58,184
I think it's time I go off,

940
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:00,436
stand on my own two feet
for once.

941
00:58:04,273 --> 00:58:07,067
Right. Um...

942
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:13,824
Yeah, no worries. We'll, um...

943
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,661
We'll just be friends, then.

944
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:19,288
Oh... oh, God, no. No, no, no.

945
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:20,998
I'm still gonna cling onto you,
I'm not fucking crazy.

946
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:46,106
So, if you weren't talking
about me,

947
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:47,775
who were you talking about?

948
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:55,407
I'm scared.

949
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:14,051
This here...

950
00:59:14,093 --> 00:59:16,220
belonged to your mum.

951
00:59:16,262 --> 00:59:19,098
This is St. Christopher.

952
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:22,309
She gave it to me
a long time ago,

953
00:59:22,351 --> 00:59:25,354
and told me...

954
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:26,939
it would keep me safe.

955
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:29,400
And it has.

956
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:32,778
Mostly.

957
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:44,498
Now your mum...

958
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,250
is gonna help keep you safe.

959
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:56,135
Come on.

960
01:00:03,684 --> 01:00:05,561
Now...

961
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,938
remember what I told you.

962
01:00:08,981 --> 01:00:10,274
Don't be a cunt.

963
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:31,545
William, I'm so sorry.

964
01:00:34,173 --> 01:00:36,133
Vought's gonna want him back.

965
01:00:36,175 --> 01:00:38,344
Let me handle Vought.

966
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:41,263
You think he'll turn into
his father?

967
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:48,896
Becca didn't think so.

968
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:52,816
I pray she's right.

969
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:55,778
All the charges against you
and the Boys have been dropped.

970
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:57,529
Even for the crimes
you did commit.

971
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:59,281
You're a free man.

972
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:03,202
And the White House is opening
an Office of Supe Affairs.

973
01:01:03,243 --> 01:01:05,746
Victoria Neuman is the new czar.

974
01:01:05,788 --> 01:01:08,499
She's sneaking me some
off-the-books funding

975
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,876
for a team that can keep tabs
on the Supes.

976
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:14,171
If you're interested.

977
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:35,127
I can do whatever I want.

978
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:39,590
I can do whatever...

979
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:42,968
I want.

980
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,222
I can do...

981
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,141
whatever I want.

982
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:54,980
I can do
whatever the fuck I want!

983
01:02:55,022 --> 01:02:59,026
I can do whatever the fuck I...

984
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:01,069
want!

985
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:04,114
Congratulations on the
appointment, Congresswoman.

986
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:06,950
It's about time we had
an Office of Supe Affairs.

987
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:09,077
Well, I know it was your intel
that took Stormfront down.

988
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,412
So, thank you.

989
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:12,581
Yeah, and that's just the start.

990
01:03:12,623 --> 01:03:16,376
We have enough dirt
to ruin a dozen Supes.

991
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:18,921
Be a death blow for Stan Edgar.

992
01:03:18,962 --> 01:03:20,672
That is, of course,

993
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:22,633
if you're open to,
uh, expediting

994
01:03:22,674 --> 01:03:25,219
the Church's tax-exempt status.

995
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,679
Small price to pay.

996
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:29,640
Call my office,
set up a meeting?

997
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:32,226
You are one
of the good ones, Vic.

998
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:35,354
- See you soon.
- See you.

999
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:17,563
Hi.

1000
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,401
- Here's the research you asked for.
- Thank you.

1001
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:24,611
- And your 2:00 is waiting.
- Thank you.

1002
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:27,906
Hugh Campbell.

1003
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:33,203
I don't know how to repay you
for what you did.

1004
01:04:33,245 --> 01:04:35,831
- You know, I can think of a way.
- Oh?

1005
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:39,668
You can... give me a job.

1006
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:42,004
You serious?

1007
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:44,256
Uh, what about your team?

1008
01:04:44,298 --> 01:04:47,175
Don't get me wrong, I-I-I still
want to fight Vought, I just...

1009
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,720
I want to do it the right way.

1010
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:51,471
Not covered
in quite as many guts.

1011
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:54,433
Look, the truth is,

1012
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:57,060
I never totally fit in
with the guys.

1013
01:04:57,102 --> 01:05:02,065
And... I think it's time
I stand on my own two feet.

1014
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:07,154
- They know you're here?
- I haven't told them yet.

1015
01:05:08,614 --> 01:05:11,116
When can you start?
