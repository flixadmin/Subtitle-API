00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,788
My name

3
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,499
is Grey Worm.

4
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,836
I come from

5
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,256
the Summer "Ills."

6
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,007
Isles.

7
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:16,094
Summer Isles.

8
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:19,305
Grey Worm:
<i>Summer Isles.</i>

9
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,684
( speaking Valyrian )

10
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,816
I am from an island
called Naath.

11
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,571
When they took you?

12
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,824
<i>"When</i> did<i> they take me?"</i>

13
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,662
I was five years old.

14
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,748
You remember your home?

15
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,751
I remember when they
rowed us away from shore.

16
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:54,424
How white
the beaches were.

17
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,011
How tall the trees.

18
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:05,226
And I remember
my village burning.

19
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,605
Smoke rising
into the sky.

20
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,864
Do you remember your home?

21
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,034
Unsullied.

22
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,703
Always Unsullied.

23
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,956
Before Unsullied,
nothing.

24
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,627
That's not true.

25
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,588
Perhaps one day
you will return
to the Summer Isles.

26
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,381
I don't want return.

27
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,635
( speaking Valyrian )

28
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,847
Kill the masters.

29
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,475
Kill the masters.

30
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,687
Daenerys:
<i>How are the lessons coming?</i>

31
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,106
Very well,
Your Grace.

32
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,401
Missandei is teacher
good, my queen.

33
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,073
You'll have
to continue later.

34
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,661
It's time.

Mhysa! Mhysa!

46

Daenerys:
<i>Remind me, Ser Jorah,</i>

47
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,027
<i>how many children</i>
<i>did the Great Masters</i>
<i>nail to mileposts?</i>

48
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,405
163, Khaleesi.

49
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,324
Yes, that was it.

50

The city is yours.

<i>All these people,</i>
<i>they're your subjects now.</i>

54
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,724
Sometimes it is better
to answer injustice

55
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,059
with mercy.

56
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:24,272
I will answer injustice
with justice.

57
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,822

00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,076

63
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,644
What the hell was that?

64
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:48,189
That was me
knocking your ass
to the dirt

65
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,982
with your own hand.

66
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,111
You're a rare talent.

67
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:58,115
When you're fighting
cripples, anyway.

68
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,242
You learned to fight
like a good little boy.

69
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,496
I'll bet that thrust
through the Mad King's back
was pretty as a picture.

70
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,748
<i>You want to fight pretty</i>
<i>or you want to win?</i>

71
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,708
You talk to my brother
this way?

72
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,835
All the time.

73
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,421
He got used to it.

74
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,555
Do you think
he did it?

75
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,516
No.

76
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,060
Oh, he hated
the little twat, sure.

77
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,229
But who didn't?

78
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,273
And poison's
not his style.

79
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,903
Or murder,
for that matter.

80
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,489
You want to know for sure,
why don't you ask him?

81
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,287
You haven't been
to see him yet, eh?

82
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,998
We're done for today.

83
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:51,043
<i>( seagulls calling )</i>

84
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,712
Your brother ever tell you
how I came into his service?

85
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:57,174
You stood for him
in his trial by combat
at the Eyrie.

86
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,592
Aye.

87
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,095
But only when
Lady Arryn demanded

88
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,098
the trial take place
that day.

89
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,016
You were his first choice.

90
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,018
He named you
for his champion

91
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,397
because he knew you
would ride day and night
to come fight for him.

92
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,733
You gonna fight
for him now?

93
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,619
To tell you the truth,
this isn't so bad.

94
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:30,124
Four walls.
A pot to piss in.

95
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,792
I was chained
to a wooden post

96
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,587
covered in my own
shit for months.

97
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,967
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

98
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,802
Maybe a bit.

99
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,891
I'm sorry I didn't
come sooner.

100
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,519
It's complicated, yes.

101
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,397
- So how is our sister?
- How do you think?

102
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,983
Her son died in her arms.

103
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,527
Her son?

104
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,113
Don't.

105
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,661
You know what's coming?

106
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,624
My trial for regicide.
Yes, I know.

107
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:15,336
I know the whole bloody
country thinks I'm guilty.

108
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,505
I know that one
of my three judges

109
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,673
has wished me dead more
times than I can count.

110
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,343
And that judge
is my father.

111
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,304
As for Cersei,

112
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,931
well, she's probably
working on a way

113
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,683
to avoid a trial altogether
by having me killed.

114
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:33,229
Now that you mention it,
she did ask.

115
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,482
So, should I turn around
and close my eyes?

116
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,609
Depends.

117
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,861
Did you do it?

118
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,530
The Kingslayer brothers.

119
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:46,033
You like it?
I like it.

120
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,621
You're really asking
if I killed your son?

121
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:54,083
Are you really asking
if I'd kill my brother?

122
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,214
How can I help you?

123
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,632
Well, you could
set me free.

124
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,803
You know I can't.

125
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,888
Then there's really
nothing else to say.

126
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,391
What do you want me to do?
Kill the guards?

127
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,268
Sneak you out of the city
in the back of a cart?

128
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,270
I'm the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

129
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,729
Sorry, I'd forgotten.

130
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,815
I'd hate for you to do
something inappropriate.

131
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,608
Inappropriate?

132
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,319
You're accused
of killing the king.
Freeing you is treason.

133
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,446
Except I didn't do it.

134
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,449
Which is why
we're having a trial.

135
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,951
A trial.

136
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,453
If the killer threw himself
before the Iron Throne,

137
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:35,749
confessed to his crimes,
and gave irrefutable
evidence of his guilt,

138
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,293
<i>it wouldn't matter</i>
<i>to Cersei.</i>

139
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,546
She won't rest
until my head's on a spike.

140
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,840
Not just yours.

141
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,926
She's offering a knighthood
to whomever finds Sansa Stark.

142
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,511
Sansa couldn't
have done this.

143
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,930
She had more reason than
anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.

144
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,725
Do you think it's a coincidence
she disappeared the same
night Joffrey died?

145
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,935
No, but...

146
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,230
Sansa's not a killer.

147
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,401
Not yet, anyway.

148
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,863
-<i> ( wood creaking )</i>
<i>- ( men shouting )</i>

149
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,118
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

150
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,958
Where are you taking me?

151
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,169
I'm getting married
to your Aunt Lysa.

152
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,588
She's waiting for us
at the Eyrie.

153
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,257
You'll be safe there.

154
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,897
Did you kill Joffrey?

155
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,442
Did I kill Joffrey?

156
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,235
I've been in
the Vale for weeks.

157
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,237
I know it was you.

158
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:51,200
And who helped me
with this conspiracy?

159
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,411
Well, there was Ser Dontos.

160
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,372
You used him to get
me out of King's Landing,

161
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,916
but you would never trust
him to kill the king.

162
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:03,629
- Why not?
- Because you're too smart
to trust a drunk.

163
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,923
Then perhaps it was
your husband.

164
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,591
No.

165
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,927
<i>How do you know?</i>

166
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,471
I just do.

167
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,806
You're right.

168
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,850
He wasn't involved
in Joffrey's death.

169
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,186
But you were.

170
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:23,941
<i>Do you remember that lovely</i>
<i>necklace Dontos gave you?</i>

171
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:27,319
<i>I don't suppose you noticed</i>
<i>that a stone was missing</i>

172
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,864
<i>after the feast.</i>

173
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,409
The poison.

174
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,828
I don't understand.

175
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,247
The Lannisters gave you
wealth, power.

176
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,708
Joffrey made you
the Lord of Harrenhal.

177
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,044
A man with no motive
is a man no one suspects.

178
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,171
<i>Always keep</i>
<i>your foes confused.</i>

179
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,091
If they don't know who
you are or what you want,

180
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,261
they can't know
what you plan to do next.

181
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,350
I don't believe you.

182
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,186
<i>If they catch you,</i>
<i>they'll put your head</i>
<i>on a spike</i>

183
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,604
<i>just like my father's.</i>

184
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,899
You'd risk that
just to confuse them?

185
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:11,488
So many men,
they risk so little.

186
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,616
They spend their lives
avoiding danger.

187
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,911
And then they die.

188
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:23,167
I'd risk everything
to get what I want.

189
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,295
And what do you want?

190
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,509
Everything.

191
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:38,140
My friendship
with the Lannisters
was productive.

192
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,184
But Joffrey,

193
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,228
a vicious boy with
a crown on his head,

194
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,230
is not a reliable ally.

195
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,316
And who could trust
a friend like that?

196
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,568
Who could trust you?

197
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,113
I don't want
friends like me.

198
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,491
My new friends
are predictable.

199
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,618
Very reasonable people.

200
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,578
<i>As for what</i>
<i>happened to Joffrey,</i>

201
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:04,458
well, that was something
my new friends wanted
very badly.

202
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,877
<i>Nothing like</i>
<i>a thoughtful gift</i>

203
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,630
<i>to make a new friendship</i>
<i>grow strong.</i>

204
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,507
I can't believe
you're going.

205
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,051
Leaving me alone here
with these people.

206
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,470
<i>The time has come,</i>
<i>my dear.</i>

207
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,640
There's nothing
more tedious than a trial.

208
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,934
Except perhaps
these gardens.

209
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,478
If I have to take one
more leisurely stroll

210
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,689
through these gardens,
I'll fling myself
from the cliffs.

211
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,316
( Margaery laughs )

212
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,568
Have you been
to see Tommen yet?

213
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,654
No.

214
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,988
Have they even agreed
to the match?

215
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,824
No one tells me anything.

216
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:40,953
I wasn't originally meant
to marry your grandfather
Luthor, you know.

217
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,747
He was engaged
to my sister,

218
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,874
your great-aunt Viola.

219
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,169
I was to be given
to some Targaryen
or other.

220
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:53,006
Marrying a Targaryen
was all the rage back then.

221
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,676
But the moment
I saw my intended,

222
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,012
with his twitchy
little ferret's face

223
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,973
and ludicrous silver hair,

224
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,183
I knew he wouldn't do.

225
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,769
So the evening

226
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,272
before Luthor was
to propose to my sister,

227
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:11,024
I got lost on my way back
from my embroidery lesson

228
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,235
and happened
upon his chamber.

229
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,028
( laughs )

230
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,823
- How absentminded of me.
- Mm-hmm.

231
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:21,326
The following morning,
Luthor never made it
down the stairs

232
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,205
to propose to my sister
'cause the boy couldn't
bloody walk.

233
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,499
And once he could,
the only thing he wanted

234
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,918
was what I'd given him
the night before.

235
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,129
I was good.

236
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,715
I was very, very good.

237
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,344
You are even better.

238
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,888
But you need
to act quickly.

239
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,766
Cersei may be vicious,
but she's not stupid.

240
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,728
She'll turn the boy
against you as soon
as she can.

241
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:51,023
And by the time
you're married,
it'll be too late.

242
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,983
Luckily for you,
the Queen Regent

243
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,860
is rather distracted
at the moment.

244
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,404
mourning her dear
departed boy.

245
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,740
Accusing her brother
of his murder,

246
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,950
which he didn't commit.

247
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,243
Well, he could have done.

248
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,037
He could have done,
but he didn't.

249
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,249
- You don't know, Grandmother.
- But I do know.

250
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:13,879
You don't think I'd let you
marry that beast, do you?

251
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,924
What?
I don't understand.

252
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,719
Shh. Don't you worry
yourself about all that.

253
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,307
You just do
what needs to be done.

254
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,769
Jon:
<i>Bring it through!</i>

255
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,939
( swords clanging )

256
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,112
And again.

257
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,329
- ( laughs )
- Very nice. Good.

258
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:51,291
A lot of wildlings fight
with a weapon in each hand.

259
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,251
First thing you want to do

260
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,963
is disarm them to try
and even the odds.

261
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,603
Let's see what you can do.

262
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,107
Olly, you just watch
for now.

263
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,358
I can fight.

264
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,485
Have you ever
held a sword before?

265
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,362
I was the best archer
in our hamlet.

266
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,573
- ( men laugh )
- I was!

267
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,117
I believe you.

268
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,827
We'll go hunting
for rabbits one day.

269
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,620
Right now,
watch and learn.

270
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,666
You two.

271
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,877
Take it slow,
try and disarm each other.

272
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,513
( shouts )

273
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,600
( groans )

274
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,406
You know how to fight.

275
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,034
You could have gone
easier on him.

276
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,536
He wouldn't have learned
anything that way.

277
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,955
Alliser:
<i>Lord Snow.</i>

278
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:14,583
What do you think
you're doing?

279
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,501
Grenn and I were
helping them.

280
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,754
Grenn's a ranger.
You're a steward.

281
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:22,382
Maybe you forgot that
while you were off with
your wildling bitch,

282
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,885
but I didn't.

283
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,386
Someone has
to train them.

284
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,263
And that someone
isn't you.

285
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,682
Go find a chamber pot
to empty.

286
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,229
Go on. Do it.

287
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,273
You traitor's bastard.

288
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,150
Give me an excuse.

289
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:43,070
Mormont's not here
to protect you now.

290
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,500
Get back to work.

291
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,044
Now!

292
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,671
I said now!

293
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,344
The bastard's well-liked.
You're not.

294
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:10,263
You think I care
if they like me?
We're at war.

295
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,848
For now.

296
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,184
But you can't be
acting commander forever.

297
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,311
There will be a choosing.

298
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:19,106
The old maester
will insist on it.

299
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,399
You might reconsider

300
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,778
his request to march
on Craster's.

301
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,781
Let the mutineers
take care of Snow.

302
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,241
Or you might be taking
orders from him

303
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,867
the rest of your life.

304
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:49,052
A bastard, eh?

305
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,305
Took you for highborn.

306
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,057
My father was highborn.

307
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,560
My mother wasn't.

308
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,398
Name's Locke.

309
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,068
Jon Snow.

310
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,990
You fight well.

311
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,741
What brought you up here?

312
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,994
A sense of duty.

313
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:17,164
I wanted to do my part
for the safety of the realm.

314
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,624
( laughs )

315
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,127
I was a game warden
in the Stormlands.

316
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,671
Fed a prized partridge
to my hungry kids.

317
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,506
I was stupid enough
to get caught.

318
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,842
Chose the Wall
over losing my hand.

319
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:32,345
Figured I wouldn't
have to suck up to any
highborn cunts here.

320
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,097
Alliser:
<i>Come on, get on with it.</i>

321
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,850
What are you
waiting for? Summer?

322
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,393
Guess I was wrong.

323
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,023
<i>( knocking )</i>

324
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,610
<i>( knocking )</i>

325
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,740
<i>( knocking )</i>

326
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,373
You sent for me,
Your Grace?

327
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,375
Your Grace.

328
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,336
How formal of you.

329
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:10,926
How many Kingsguards
are posted outside
Tommen's door?

330
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,969
Ser Boros
is on duty tonight.

331
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:16,473
- Tomorrow I believe--
-<i> So one?</i>

332
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:19,476
You have one man
guarding the future king?

333
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,394
I promise you
Tommen's safe.

334
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,688
We're protecting him.

335
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,192
The way you
protected Joffrey?

336
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,694
Why did Catelyn Stark
set you free?

337
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,739
- What?
- I've been wondering
for months.

338
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:37,327
Ever since
that great cow brought
you back to the capital.

339
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,246
Why did she
set you free?

340
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,665
You know why.
She'd hoped I'd send
her daughters back to her.

341
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,964
She hoped
or did you promise?

342
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,757
I swore by all the gods

343
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,926
that if her daughters
were alive, I'd return
them to her.

344
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,887
So you made a sacred vow
to the enemy.

345
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,182
I wanted to get
back to you.

346
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,268
Should I have told her
to fuck off?

347
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,727
You didn't mean it, then?

348
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,563
You have no loyalty
to Catelyn Stark?

349
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,232
Catelyn Stark's dead.

350
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:10,777
So if I told you
to leave the capital
right now and find Sansa,

351
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,281
if I told you to find that
murderous little bitch

352
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:17,242
and bring me her head,

353
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,703
would you do it?

354
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,667
I know you went
to see Tyrion.

355
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,881
That creature
who murdered our son.

356
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,261
I had to see him.

357
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,638
I had to know
for myself.

358
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,349
And?

359
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,893
He didn't do it, Cersei.

360
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,521
You've always pitied him.

361
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:49,649
Our poor little brother.

362
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,942
Abused by the world.

363
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,237
Despised by his father
and sister.

364
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,032
He'd kill us all
if he could.

365
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,704
I want four men
at Tommen's door
day and night.

366
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,167
That will be all,
Lord Commander.

367
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,571
( sighs )

368
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,493
<i>( door opens )</i>

369
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,745
Ser Pounce?

370
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,794
<i>( door creaks )</i>

371
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:54,381
<i>( door closes )</i>

372
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,427
How did you get past
the Kingsguard?

373
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,222
Kingsguard.

374
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:07,394
I don't think you're
supposed to be here.

375
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,230
Mother doesn't allow me
to have visitors at night.

376
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,440
I'm not a visitor,
Your Grace.

377
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,777
Word has it
I'm to be your bride.

378
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,076
Did you know that people
in arranged marriages

379
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,204
often never meet
until their wedding day?

380
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,043
Before we decide to spend
our lives together,

381
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,963
we ought to get
to know one another.

382
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,090
Don't you think?

383
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,428
Yes.

384
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,595
But if my mother
found out--

385
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,806
It can be our secret.
Hmm?

386
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,310
If we're going to be
man and wife,

387
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:53,231
we'll have a few secrets
from her, I hope.

388
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:58,111
So, Your Grace...

389
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,989
Yes?

390
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,033
Tell me a secret.

391
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,914
- ( cat meows )
- ( laughs )

392
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,375
Hello. Aren't you
a proper fellow?

393
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,878
That's Ser Pounce.

394
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,255
Very handsome.

395
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,259
Joffrey didn't like him.

396
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,178
He threatened
to skin him alive

397
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,013
and mix his innards
up in my food

398
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,931
so I wouldn't know
I was eating him.

399
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:30,310
That's very cruel.

400
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:33,480
You don't strike me
as cruel.

401
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,691
No.

402
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:37,817
I don't think I am.

403
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,819
That's a relief.

404
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,322
Because you know
what happens when we marry?

405
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,616
We say our vows in front
of the high septon.

406
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,493
And after the ceremony,
there's a feast.

407
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,870
When we marry,
I become yours.

408
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,497
Forever.

409
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,001
It's getting late.

410
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,711
( sighs )

411
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:59,005
I should go.

412
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,507
May I come and visit
you again?

413
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,845
( laughs )
All right, then.

414
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,769
Remember,

415
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:16,481
our little secret.

416
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,806
<i>( door closes )</i>

417
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,686
Brienne:
<i>"Ser Jaime Lannister.</i>

418
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:59,232
<i>Knighted and named</i>
<i>to the Kingsguard</i>
<i>in his 16th year.</i>

419
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,733
At the sack
of King's Landing,

420
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,361
murdered his king
Aerys II.

421
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:06,614
Pardoned by
Robert Baratheon.

422
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,118
Thereafter known
as the Kingslayer."

423
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,413
It's the duty of
the Lord Commander
to fill those pages.

424
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,377
And there's still room
left on mine.

425
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,576
Valyrian steel.

426
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,621
Mmm.

427
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,872
It's yours.

428
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,290
I can't accept this.

429
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,792
It was reforged
from Ned Stark's sword.

430
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:04,088
You'll use it to defend
Ned Stark's daughter.

431
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:09,135
You swore an oath
to return the Stark
girls to their mother.

432
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,762
Lady Stark's dead.

433
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,805
Arya's probably
dead, too,

434
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,266
but there's still a chance
to find Sansa and get her
somewhere safe.

435
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,145
I've got something
else for you.

436
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,041
<i>I hope I got</i>
<i>your measurements right.</i>

437
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,796
I'll find her.

438
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:49,550
For Lady Catelyn.

439
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,180
And for you.

440
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,314
I almost forgot.

441
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,484
I have one more gift.

442
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,240
I don't need a squire.

443
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,908
Of course you do.

444
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:15,451
He'll slow me down.

445
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,537
My brother owes him a debt.
He's not safe here.

446
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,039
You're keeping
him from harm.
It's chivalry.

447
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:23,126
I won't
slow you down, ser--

448
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,255
my lady.

449
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,340
<i>I promise</i>
<i>I'll serve you well.</i>

450
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,760
See? He's a good lad.
You'll get along.

451
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:40,143
Compliments of Lord Tyrion.

452
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:43,104
His axe from the Blackwater.

453
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,819
What are you
waiting for, a kiss?

454
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,740
Ready the lady's horse.

455
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,418
They say the best swords
have names.

456
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,086
Any ideas?

457
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,886
Oathkeeper.

458
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,815
Good-bye, Brienne.

459
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,966
Podrick:
Come on, move.

460
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:20,493
I should never
have taken her away.

461
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:24,330
- She wasn't safe here.
- She's not safe out there.

462
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,706
I should have known.

463
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,583
You told us there were
wildlings south of the Wall.

464
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,336
<i>If they're raiding</i>
<i>the smaller villages,</i>
<i>Mole's Town could be next.</i>

465
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:33,214
- Castle Black could be next.
- I should go back for Gilly.

466
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,091
We have orders.
No one's to leave
the castle.

467
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,385
I remember when you
disobeyed orders and rode
south to help Robb.

468
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,804
And I remember
who came after me
and brought me home.

469
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,227
I know how hard
it is, Sam, believe me.

470
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,273
When you told me about Bran
going beyond the Wall,

471
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:53,651
all I could think about
was getting my strength back
so I could go and find him.

472
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,488
I wish I could have convinced
him to come back with me.

473
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,951
I tried.
Really, I did.

474
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,123
How fast could they travel?

475
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:10,459
A crippled boy being pulled
on a sledge by a simpleton?

476
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,086
I don't know.

477
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,380
They'd pass
wildling villages.

478
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:17,466
They could try to find
shelter at one of them.

479
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,721
The wildlings
have joined up with Mance.

480
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:24,974
Every village
or sheltered place
will be deserted.

481
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,521
Except...

482
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:37,069
Sam:
<i>Craster's?</i>

483
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,237
You think Bran
might have found--

484
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,740
Snow.

485
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,325
I don't mean
to interrupt.

486
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:45,119
Thorne wants to see you.

487
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,125
Your foray
to Craster's Keep,

488
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:53,419
I'll sanction it.

489
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:57,214
But I won't order
anyone to go with you.

490
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:00,009
Volunteers only.

491
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,261
Thank you, Ser Alliser.

492
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,434
( men chatting )

493
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,066
Ahem, brothers.

494
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:18,486
( chatter continues )

495
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,197
( pounds )

496
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,996
I'm going beyond the Wall
to Craster's Keep.

497
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,376
I'm going to capture
the mutineers holed up
there or kill them.

498
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:37,380
<i>I'm asking for volunteers</i>
<i>to come with me.</i>

499
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,675
There's 60 miles of wilderness
between here and Craster's

500
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:44,178
and Mance Rayder has an army
bearing down on us,

501
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:46,222
but we have to do this.

502
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,349
<i>Our survival</i>
<i>may depend on</i>

503
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,268
<i>us getting</i>
<i>to these mutineers</i>
<i>before Mance does.</i>

504
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:55,648
They know the Wall.
They know our defenses.

505
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,693
If Mance learns what
they know, we're lost.

506
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,406
But if that's not enough,

507
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,700
then consider this.

508
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,119
If the Night's Watch
are truly brothers,

509
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:11,163
then Lord Commander Mormont
was our father.

510
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,625
He lived and died
for the Watch

511
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,044
and he was betrayed
by his own men.

512
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,754
Stabbed in the back
by cowards.

513
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,673
He deserved far better.

514
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:24,343
All we can give him now
is justice.

515
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,596
Who will join me?

516
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,648
I can't let a recruit
come north of the Wall.

517
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:22,026
Then let me say my vows.

518
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,279
If it's a fight you're
heading for, then you
need men who know how.

519
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,377
Thank you, brothers.

520
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,718
<i>( women whimpering )</i>

521
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,554
Woman:
<i>No, don't.</i>

522
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:53,474
<i>Don't, please.</i>

523
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,434
Woman 2:
<i>Please don't. Ow!</i>

524
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,561
<i>You're hurting me.</i>

525
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:06,445
Karl Tanner
from Gin Alley

526
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,906
drinking wine
from the skull

527
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:12,451
of Jeor fucking Mormont.

528
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:23,420
Any command for us,
Lord Commander?

529
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,756
What's that?

530
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,175
Fuck 'em
till they're dead?

531
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,720
- ( whimpers )
-<i> Did you hear that, boys?</i>

532
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,515
Fuck 'em
till they're dead.

533
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,439
Rast.

534
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,281
Go outside
and feed the beast.

535
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,658
We should kill that thing.

536
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,954
You should shut
your fucking hole,

537
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,874
ugly little cunt.

538
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,668
You look like
a fucking ballsack.

539
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:05,629
Ugly. Look at your
stupid cunt face.

540
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:10,759
I could piss in any gutter
and soak five of you.

541
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:15,264
Know how much
they paid me to kill
a man in King's Landing?

542
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,224
Seven silvers.

543
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:21,061
They told me a man's name
and that man never saw
daylight again.

544
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,814
None of them cocksuckers
got away from me.

545
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,571
Haven't lost a fight
since I was nine.

546
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,950
Maybe it's time.

547
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,912
What do you think, eh?

548
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,207
Maybe you're the man.

549
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,543
Eh, cunt?

550
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,339
I wouldn't stand a chance.

551
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,507
None of us would.

552
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:54,178
I was a fucking legend
in Gin Alley.

553
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,639
A fucking legend!

554
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,765
I would take any knight--

555
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,726
any knight, any time.

556
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:04,688
Fucking cunts in steel plate.
Fucking cowards.

557
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:12,905
( baby fussing )

558
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:16,575
- A gift for the gods.
- A gift for the gods.

559
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,285
A gift for the gods.

560
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,703
What the fuck is that?

561
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:22,915
Craster's last child.
A boy.

562
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,584
What am I supposed
to do with him?

563
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,461
What did Craster
do with 'em?

564
00:42:27,544 --> 00:42:30,714
Kill 'em before
they could grow up
and do the same to him?

565
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,801
All right.

566
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,347
Don't need another
mouth to feed.

567
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,351
- Hand him over.
- He didn't kill them.

568
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,603
- He offered them.
- To who?

569
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,481
To the gods.

570
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:48,983
The white walkers.

571
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,943
Women:
A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.

572
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,779
A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.

573
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:57,199
A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.

574
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,951
Shut up!

575
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,209
So...

576
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,630
if it worked for him...

577
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,340
( crying )

578
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,968
Let's give the walkers
what they want.

579
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,514
( baby crying )

580
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,686
Rast is headed that way.

581
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,749

582
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,950

585
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,025
Pink-eyed fuck.

586
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,447
You thirsty?

587
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,960
( growls )

588
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,552

<i>( baby crying )</i>

594
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,046
Hodor.

595
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,304
Do you hear that?

596
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:14,104
Is that a baby?

597
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,565
It's coming.

598
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,150
I'm going out there.

599
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,735
No, we need
to stay together.

600
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,737
I'm going.

601
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,039

606
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,616
- Hodor.
- Bran, what happened?

607
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:10,035
Summer, he's hurt.
They've caught him
in a trap.

608
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:11,453
Who?

609
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,956
I didn't see, but they
have my brother's wolf.

610
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,293
They have Ghost.

611
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,551
Bran:
<i>They're Night's Watch.</i>

612
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,636
Look.

613
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,221
<i>Jon might be here.</i>

614
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:32,558
If Jon was here,
why would they put
his wolf in a cage?

615
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:36,061
( woman whimpering )

616
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,981
<i>( men shouting )</i>

617
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,817
They might have been
Night's Watch once,
not anymore.

618
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,569
We're not safe here.
We need to go.

619
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,153
No.

620
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,573
Bran, we need to go now.

621
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,408
I'm not leaving
without Summer.

622
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,833
Can you remember
where the cage was?

623
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,544
The east side
of the keep.

624
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:06,091
If I'm not back
soon, we'll meet--

625
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,010
Hodor.

626
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,145
( shouting )

627
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,066
Hodor.

628
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,446
Hodor.
Hodor.

629
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:31,116
( groans )

630
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,493
Hodor.

631
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,788
If I was your size,
I'd be king of
the fucking world.

632

( men laughing )

633
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:51,011
Help him up.

634
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,410
This is nice.

635
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,206
Fine leather.

636
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:22,250
You're no wildling.

637
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,836
Important. Highborn.

638
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:29,299
Who are you?

639
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,475
( grunts )

640
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,268
You see,
where I come from,

641
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,854
a commoner like me slaps
a little lord like you,

642
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,691
I'd lose my right hand.

643
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:49,820
But we're a long way
from home, aren't we?

644
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:52,531
And the two of you,

645
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:56,326
fancy-looking folks
north of the Wall

646
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,620
creeping through
the woods.

647
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:02,165
Isn't that a bit odd?

648
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,754
I like your curly hair.

649
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:12,884
My mom had curls
like that.

650
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:16,805
Beautiful brown curls.

651
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:20,100
Why'd you drag a crippled
boy all the way up here?

652
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:28,900
See you haven't played
this game before.

653
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:32,696
A highborn hostage,

654
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:35,574
<i>that's valuable.</i>

655
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:38,076
But three of them,

656
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,079
that's a lot
of mouths to feed.

657
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,998

<i>- Come here.</i>

Please.
Please, let me help him.

- Please.

- I'm Brandon Stark!

It's Meera. It's Meera.
I'm right here.
