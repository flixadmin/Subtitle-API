1
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,240
Sir, I'm sure you remember
that massive gang war

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,080
that took place between
all the drug dealers in Mumbai.

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,280
It was about three years ago, you know?

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,800
All of them were busy killing each other.

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,480
And the ones who were left,
police killed them.

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,720
Some of the policeman were given medals,

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,320
some of them lost their jobs.

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,600
Why did all this happen?

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,480
Not because the police wanted
to get rid of the drug business here...

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,280
but because Nayak wanted it that way.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,200
He could see that Mumbai had the potential
to become the drug capital of Asia.

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,320
The supply chain would start from here

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,040
and reach the smallest dealers
in every corner of Asia,

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,600
ten times more than before.

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,000
Millions of people
would become cocaine, heroin addicts

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,880
for the first time through this network.

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,200
So, the old drug business
and the new drug empire

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,160
will end up having the same ruler:

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Nayak.

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,400
This is Nayak's five-year plan, sir.

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,960
The whole operation...

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,360
is run by a network of 365 people.

23
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,320
Three sixty-five, as in the number of days
in a year. Like that.

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,320
Everyone is given their duty.

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,320
And inside the network,
the one in front and the one behind you

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,040
are the only two people you know.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,080
That way, if they get caught
and start talking...

28
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,800
then the police can never link them
back to Nayak.

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,920
This is why everyone thinks
that Nayak doesn't exist. [chuckles]

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,760
That is the trick.

31
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,160
In this game,
there is only one king - Nayak.

32
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,480
The rest are all his slaves.

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,000
Suppliers, shooters,

34
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,840
then those investors, transporters,
politicians, police -

35
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
everyone.

36
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
How many policemen?

37
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
Fifty-two.

38
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,640
Like the number of weeks
in a year. Like that.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,560
They all have only one job:

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,720
To keep all the supply routes
and warehouses clear,

41
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,520
so that the consignments
can come and go easily.

42
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,560
And how many warehouses does he have?

43
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,040
-I have told you sir, 12.
-The number of months in a year.

44
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,800
Correct. This whole plan
has been designed like one year.

45
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,440
[Mathur] <i>Sir, we did a random check</i>
<i>on the warehouse locations given by Sasya.</i>

46
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,000
And so far, every piece of information
has been correct.

47
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,360
[DCP Mumbai] <i>I want all the locations</i>
<i>to be raided at the same time.</i>

48
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,760
We don't want Nayak
to get any kind of warning.

49
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,800
Yes, sir. Right now,
only the core team has this information.

50
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,160
Mathur, we can't repeat the Karwar case.

51
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,680
If Nayak gets away this time,

52
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,960
then he's going to return years later
with another dangerous plan.

53
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,560
-We can't let that happen.
-Yes, sir, I understand.

54
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,520
This is where Bhumi comes in, sir.

55
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,560
Because Nayak doesn't share
his complete plan with anyone.

56
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,640
Certain things he keeps only in his head.

57
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,720
Nayak's mind is always working, sir.
Full time, you know?

58
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,480
It's like horses running inside.
[imitates horses running]

59
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,800
It's fucking crazy, sir.

60
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,880
If I spend too much time with him,
I start feeling exhausted.

61
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,920
He's like that.

62
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,440
Sometimes, he also gets very exhausted.

63
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,680
So, when he wants to relax...
he picks up girls at night.

64
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,400
Whores, you know?

65
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,960
I mean, his timetable is like that.
Who else would he get?

66
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,600
After he spends a night with a girl...

67
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,240
then he starts feeling like you and me.

68
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,200
A little bit normal.

69
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,760
His brain switches off...

70
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,480
and he relaxes.

71
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,520
There is only one way
you can get to him, sir.

72
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,160
A girl.

73
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,520
What makes you think I believe you?

74
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,280
Sir, I know we have just met. That's why
you don't believe what I'm saying.

75
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,520
But, sir, have patience,
you will see I'm telling the truth.

76
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
[no audible dialogue]

77
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,160
Tell me the names. Write them down!

78
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,680
[suspenseful music]

79
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,839
I know his taste very well, sir.

80
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,400
The kind of girl he likes.

81
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,400
He will definitely like
my girlfriend, sir.

82
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,680
-I guarantee you.
-Motherfucker, you think we're pimps?

83
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,000
[laughs] Sir...

84
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,280
It's not like you caught me
in a temple, sir.

85
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,440
I am just taking your plan forward.

86
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,880
We've interrogated three policemen
from Nayak's network, sir.

87
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,560
Their records perfectly match
with Sasya's information.

88
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,360
But don't arrest them right now,
otherwise Nayak will find out.

89
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,040
We will take action
only after this operation is over.

90
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,960
Yes, sir.

91
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,600
I've told all of them to report for duty
regularly, but they know we're watching.

92
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,840
Nayak is the only one who knows when
the drug consignment will be delivered.

93
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,760
Only after he has fixed everything,
he tells the others.

94
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,240
And now the time has come
for Nayak to make an entry in Mumbai.

95
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
[theme song]

96
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,640
[man] Okay, boss?

97
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,960
[talking on TV]

98
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,120
Isn't she as hot as her photo?

99
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,240
In reality, she's much hotter.

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,520
My little mister is cold.

101
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,720
Only the heat coming out of her
will satisfy him.

102
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,880
It's a beautiful night, isn't it?

103
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,880
Come. Come on.

104
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
Hold this.

105
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Come.

106
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,880
[Bhumi whimpering]

107
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,080
What are you doing?

108
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,040
This is just a short interval
in our story, darling.

109
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,200
Don't mistake it for the climax.

110
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,880
You like how it feels?

111
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,200
I know you can feel how happy I am, right?

112
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,440
I only asked Fernandez Sir
not to tell you that I will be here today.

113
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,200
If my boys suspect anything,

114
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,880
then they would bury us together
right now, you know?

115
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,760
[Bhumi grunts]

116
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,840
Good things come to those
who wait, baby. Come.

117
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,320
Now we have to go downstairs
and make up a new story. Come.

118
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,360
Everything is in control.

119
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,280
Sasya is doing exactly
what he said he would do.

120
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,040
No surprises.

121
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Yet.

122
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,800
This next part is tricky.

123
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
Let's hope Sasya manages
to convince his men.

124
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,320
[men chattering]

125
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,200
[Sasya mutters] Son of a bitch.
I have made a big mistake.

126
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,040
Go and drop her back.

127
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,440
[man] Eh? What's happened?

128
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,000
You were ready for her just now.

129
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,200
I am ready for her now, also,
but I would have committed a sin.

130
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,760
I mean, do you know
what kind of <i>potti</i> she is?

131
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,880
She is totally our boss's type of <i>potti.</i>

132
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,920
He would enjoy her a lot.

133
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,920
This is the kind of <i>potti</i>
he's driving around all night to find.

134
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,480
-But, boss--
-Drop her back where you found her.

135
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,640
Maybe he will pick her up one day,
if he's lucky.

136
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,720
Who knows when boss will be coming?

137
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,360
And when he is here,
who knows if he will pick her up or not?

138
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,640
And if he picks her up then?

139
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,920
I don't want two brothers
fighting each other over a whore.

140
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,800
If he picks her up, great;
if he doesn't, hell with it.

141
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,120
-Darling, please leave.
-[man] Okay. When the boss comes--

142
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,400
-Put it down.
-We know where to pick her up from.

143
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,960
Do whatever you want.

144
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,880
You want to please the boss,
go ahead, do it. Just go.

145
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,680
Let's go, madam. We'll drop you back
from where we picked you up.

146
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,680
Okay, sister. Be safe.

147
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,000

00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,840
Sir, why didn't you tell me
Sasya was going to be there today?

152
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,000
Hasn't Sasya already told you why?

153
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,480
He knew everything, and I knew nothing.

154
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,560
Bhumi, come back to base
and then we'll talk.

155
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,040
Sasya bothers you. I know that.

156
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,800
Sir, I have absolutely no idea
what he has told you about me.

157
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,160
The truth.

158
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,320
If there's any woman in the world that
Sasya truly respects, it's you, Bhumi.

159
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,600
I doubt he has any respect for me.
And why would he?

160
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,280
You're uncomfortable with him. I know.

161
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,160
That's because he wants you
to feel like that.

162
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,120
That bastard wants to overpower me.

163
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,680
When I first saw you at the barricade...

164
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,520
you were standing there
on the side, so quiet.

165
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,360
But even then, I could clearly see
that you were a powerful girl.

166
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,200
There was something special in you.

167
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,080
And that is why you've been chosen
for this special operation, Bhumi.

168
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,800
Sasya's not the problem anymore.

169
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,640
His work is over and done with.

170
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,360
And now it's time for Nayak.

171
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,040
And we don't know what he's capable of.

172
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,840
You need to start mentally preparing
for Nayak now.

173
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,640
That's your job.

174
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,320
-[Rupa] I'm going home.
-[Hemant] Where are you going?

175
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
Listen.

176
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,480
-Give me a little kiss before you go.
-No.

177
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,440
There's no one here. Come on.

178
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,040
-Get lost. Okay?
-Now you get lost.

179
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,000
-Give me the phone.
-No, I won't.

180
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,480
-Give me the phone.
-Give me a kiss.

181
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,160
-Give me the phone.
-Give me a kiss.

182
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,240
Stop it!

183
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,480
Why are you behaving like this?
Fine, keep the phone with you.

184
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,360
[chuckles]

185
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
Load.

186
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,240
[Atul] See! Grab! Pull!

187
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,480
[grunting]

188
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,240
Harder! Faster!

189
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,880
Power! Kick!

190
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,120
Use your heel.

191
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,480
[Female trainer] Here, here and here.

192
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
Over here.

193
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,040
[no audible dialogue]

194
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,360
What are you looking at?

195
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,280
It is coming outside the lips.

196
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,440
I know, I'm doing it like that.

197
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,440
This is how men like it.

198
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,200
It looks a little cheap.

199
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,960
You're going to teach me
what looks cheap, huh?

200
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,720
If you think you know so much,
go try it on your husband.

201
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,760
[scoffs] That asshole has been dying
to have sex with me.

202
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,400
He told me, if I sleep with him,
then he'll give you your divorce.

203
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,480
[coughing]

204
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,040
See how smart she is?

205
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,720
Started coughing at the right moment.
<i>Aai, </i>drink some water!

206
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,480
[water running]

207
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
[Rupa humming tune]

208
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
[coughing]

209
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,480
What time is your shift tomorrow?

210
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,360
I'm on night duty nowadays, <i>Aai.</i>

211
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,040
So, <i>Aai,</i> your cough became Okay
without drinking any water?

212
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,760
Do you still have some tension at work?

213
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,400
There is always a little tension, <i>Aai.</i>

214
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,600
But there are some good things
also happening.

215
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,840
[indistinct chattering]

216
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,840
Excuse me.
Do you have change for Rs. 2,000?

217
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,280
Let me check.
Are you one of Anand's girls?

218
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,280
I don't work on this road.

219
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,760
I just came for tea. Thank you.

220
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,320
[man] Hey, stop the bike. Hey. Hello.

221
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
Come here.

222
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,000
-No.
-Why not?

223
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,840
I'm on my break.

224
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,040
-[laughter]
-What the hell? She's on a break!

225
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,360
Hey, enough of that! How much?

226
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,040
Tell me.

227
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
[men chattering indistinctly]

228
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,760
One tea.

229
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,840
[men laugh]

230
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,560
[train horn bellows]

231
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,599
[homeless man] One more night has passed.

232
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,640
Huh? Where did time go?

233
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,359
It ran away again!

234
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,319
Catch it.

235
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,800
Go catch it!

236
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,960
I will punish it for... uh...

237
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,720
for not following my orders!

238
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,319
Catch it now! Bring to my court.

239
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,359
Mhatre.

240
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,119
Are we going to do this every night?

241
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,080
I feel more like a watchman
than a policeman.

242
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,760
Then talk to Fernandez Sir.

243
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,520
He personally requested that I be here.

244
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
But you?

245
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,960
You and your daily parade?

246
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,040
What's the point? [scoffs]

247
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,000
-But weren't you enjoying all this before?
-Looks like you are enjoying it now.

248
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,680
[door opens]

249
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,840
-[door shuts]
-[engine starts]

250
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,960
What?

251
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,400
I get my salary every month.
I'm happy with that.

252
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,120
-Stop the car on the side.
-Now where do you want to go?

253
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,600
I'll meet you at the base later, okay?
Just stop the car.

254
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,800
Stop, stop, stop.

255
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,400
Yes, ma'am?

256
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,320
Excuse me? Hello? Hello?

257
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,400
Don't worry, she's with me.

258
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,960
Close the door.

259
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,320
How come you are here?

260
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,040
Shh.

261
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,880
Go back.

262
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,600
Keep going.

263
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,680
Go a little more.

264
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,160
I wanted to click your photo...

265
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,560
t-to show Rupa.

266
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,120
Only see.

267
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,760
Don't show anyone, hmm?

268
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,360
Okay.

269
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,800
Show me.

270
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,240
In the first time, you won't be able
to take more than this.

271
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,960
I'll try my best... to take it all.

272
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,200
You keep trying...

273
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,160
you never know, you might just get lucky
sooner than you think.

274
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,800
[door opens and shuts]

275
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,120
-[Rupa] From where did you get this?
-Keep it.

276
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,840
Did you go and meet Hemant?

277
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,280
Bhumi, how did you get this phone?

278
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,360
I got it my way,
not the way you got it from him.

279
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,680
Why did you meet Hemant?

280
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,800
Didn't I tell you to stay away from him?

281
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,880
I have no interest in meeting him, okay?

282
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,560
I did it just for you.

283
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,760
You don't need to give so much of yourself
just for a phone, Okay?

284
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,400
Remember, you're not that cheap.

285
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,240
Look, we don't need you to interfere.

286
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,000
-My boyfriend and me--
-He is not anybody's boyfriend.

287
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,080
Hey! First, why don't you go get
a divorce from your husband?

288
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,480
And if you're so tough,

289
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,320
then don't send me to have sex with him

290
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,280
just to get your work done.

291
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,760
[scoffs] You are teaching me.

292
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,000
I already told you,
there is no need for you to go there.

293
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,080
Yeah, Okay.

294
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,360
I will see.

295
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,200
-[Fernandez] Exactly as we planned, sir.
-[Mathur] Hmm.

296
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,080
As promised,
Sasya has returned to his gang.

297
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,440
-Hmm.
-And we're tracking his every move.

298
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,240
-You remember all the instructions, right?
-Yes, sir.

299
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,800
There won't be a moment
we won't be tracking you.

300
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,360
Sir, you still don't have any faith in me?

301
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,160
-I thought we had become close friends.
-Don't worry.

302
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,480
I'll keep you really close.

303
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,840
If something seems
even a little bit off...

304
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,720
we'll shoot you in the chest.

305
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,480
I'm quite sure
you're going to double-cross us.

306
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,240
At least you will only shoot me, sir.

307
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,440
But do you have any idea what Nayak
would do to me if he found out?

308
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,000
He would slit my throat.

309
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,920
He would cut me like a goat
and let my blood flow into the gutter.

310
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,200
So you can say whatever you want,
but it's him I'm really scared of.

311
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,680
-And Nayak?
-Any day now, sir.

312
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,560
-He should be in Mumbai very soon.
-Hmm.

313
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,320
And we're ready for him.

314
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,760
And Bhumi?

315
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,800
Sir, we'll be shifting her
to a hotel very soon.

316
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,040
She won't be traceable there.
It will be a lot safer.

317
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,160
What are her orders once she's picked up?
You know what I mean.

318
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,480
[snooker balls clattering]

319
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,480
I know, sir.
We've planned everything, sir.

320
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,760
Plan?

321
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,640
Is Nayak going to work
according to our plan, hmm?

322
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,720
He is Nayak.

323
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,600
He ran an arms-dealing operation in Karwar
for four years and nobody had a clue.

324
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,960
And when the police cracked the case,
do you know who they arrested?

325
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,760
Local laborers and the drivers.

326
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,920
The police didn't even know
if there was a man called Nayak or not.

327
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,800
Four senior police officers -

328
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,440
I mean, IPS officers -
were suspended in this mess.

329
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,440
And this girl is going to be with him,
at his place, alone.

330
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,680
Don't you understand that?

331
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,360
What will she do?
How is she going to protect herself?

332
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,880
[Fernandez]
It's not your job to catch Nayak.

333
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,680
You just have to pass on the information.

334
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,840
Every little thing
that you see, you hear...

335
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,800
just try and remember it,

336
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,480
and then come here
and put it all on record.

337
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,480
-That's it. That's your job.
-Yes, sir.

338
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,520
With Nayak, don't ever try to rush things.

339
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
He'll sense it.

340
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,320
You're going to have to win his confidence
and gradually become a part of his life.

341
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,640
We'll always be there to back you.

342
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,640
Atul will always be close to you.

343
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,240
