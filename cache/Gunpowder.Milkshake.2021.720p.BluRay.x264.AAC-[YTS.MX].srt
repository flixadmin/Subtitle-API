You're no longer under our protection.

[Nathan] In your little massacre
earlier tonight,

722
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,800
you killed the wrong people.

723

Including Jim McAlester's son.

And you landed on the wrong side
of the balance sheet.

So…

731

It needs to be rectified.

I can assure you, this is not how The Firm
conducts its business, sir.

749
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:53,966
It was an unsolicited action
by a very troubled individual.

Now, I'm sending you her last location.

[defensively] No…
Where did you learn that expression?

-History Channel.
-Well…

I am not a serial killer.

Yes.

788
00:53:24,216 --> 00:53:26,133
So that makes you a killer.

789
00:53:26,216 --> 00:53:28,175
And you've killed more than one.

790
00:53:28,258 --> 00:53:29,633
That is serial.

791
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:32,550
It's…

792
00:53:32,633 --> 00:53:34,300
It's more complicated than that.

793
00:53:35,133 --> 00:53:38,675
Serial killers are, uh,
you know, mentally unstable.

794
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:41,091
They kill people out of a compulsive urge.

795
00:53:43,883 --> 00:53:45,341
So, why do you kill them?

796
00:53:47,883 --> 00:53:49,383
For money?

00:53:50,716 --> 00:53:52,341

Because your arms are still paralyzed?

802

Yes. After that,
I'll get you to your mother.

[Sam] Right.

813
00:54:36,591 --> 00:54:38,175
Yes, I've got it already.

814
00:54:38,258 --> 00:54:40,508
"D" is for drive. "R" is for reverse.

And you get to do the easy part,

No, no. You don't get to talk.

1024
