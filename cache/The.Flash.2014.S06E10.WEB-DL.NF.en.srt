804
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,225
Oh, wait, you...
you got cameras here?

805
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,061
- There's no cameras.

806
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,354
- This is...
this is some kind of trick.

807
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,731
Right?
- No.

808
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:52,025
It's not a trick.

809
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,777
It's more of an olive branch.

810
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,113
- Oh.

811
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,697
- I'm sorry
I said those things.

812
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:00,117
I should have
held myself accountable

813
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,701
for what happened in Crisis,

814
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,703
but instead I chose
to take it out on you.

815
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,330
- [sighs]

816
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,668
Anyway, so...

817
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,046
Hitting the road?
- Yeah.

818
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,553
So while I'm gone,
do your best

819
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,431
not to break anything,
will you, Nashville?

820
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,017
- Break everything
while you're gone, got it.

821
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,643
- It's like you're
literally not listening

822
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,020
to what I'm saying.
- What's that?

823
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,613
- Nash?
- Hmm?

824
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:43,160
- I hope you find
what you're looking for.

825
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,738
- How was Lian Yu with Dig?

826
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:23,616
- I thought Oliver
left the mask as...

827
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,827
a reminder to keep fighting.

828
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,120
But with all the danger
we've been through,

829
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:28,788
I guess I kind of

830
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,750
forgot why I made it for him
in the first place.

831
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:37,047
It was so Oliver
would always remember

832
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:40,299
to protect the people he loved.

833
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,512
That's why he left it to me.

834
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,266
He wanted me
to take my own advice.

835
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,851
- I've been in overdrive
ever since

836
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,686
we learned that you were
gonna die in Crisis.

837
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,776
I've spent the last month
trying to live every day

838
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,653
like it was my last,
hell-bent on...

839
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,032
Trying to make the most
of the limited time

840
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,658
I thought we had left together,

841
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,496
but Crisis is over now,
and you didn't die.

842
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:15,085
And I think I just...
I forgot to...

843
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:16,335
- To slow down.

844
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,633
- So are you also thinking

845
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:25,929
that tonight maybe
we just take it easy?

846
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:31,017
- Great minds.
- Beautiful minds.
