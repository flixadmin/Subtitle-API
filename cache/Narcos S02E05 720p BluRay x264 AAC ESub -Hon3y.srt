want Juan Pablo and Manuela to worry?

You're right.

When Pablo was a little boy...

he came home from school one day,
very angry.

A little girl made fun of his shoes.

They were ragged.

343

And we didn't have any money
to buy him new ones.

[in English]
Mr. Ambassador,

350
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,046
I believe people fall
into two categories, basically:

351
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,531
those who rely on hope...

352
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,247
and those who rely on faith,

353
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,530
who see a system at work in the world
and are devoted to it.

354
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:26,485
It may be religion,
but in the case of police work, a method.

355
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,369
I'm guessing that you fall
on the faith side.

356
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,646
Correct.

357
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,250
We can catch Escobar
in any number of ways.

358
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,848
But if the one we choose
furthers an already strained relationship

359
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,770
between the Colombian people
and its police,

360
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,084
a strain caused by
years of corruption and abuse,

361
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,810
then we'll have lost.

362
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,325
Even if we catch him.

363
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,725
Your philosophy is our philosophy,
Colonel.

364
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,647

still has a large army and a lot of money.

Come here, I want to show you something.

I received this urn with my name.

467
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,761
Look. On behalf of Pablo Escobar.

468
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,569
It's an obituary.

469

Look, son, you're going to do
exactly as I tell you.

470

I'm going to make sure you survive this.
Understand?

I can't leave Olivia

- Anyway, you'll be in Medellin.
- Ah.

478
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,446
You know,
I met the new head of Search Bloc.

479
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,329
- Yeah?
- He's an interesting guy.

480
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,683
I have a good feeling about him.

481
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,804
Before I forget, I want you...

482
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,642
I want you to give this to Olivia.

483

From now on,

487
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,807
the Search Bloc is going to operate
in a more systematic fashion.

488
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,485
Since we unfortunately cannot
rely on the information given to us

489
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,244
by the people of Medellin...

490
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:40,490
we are going to implement
a quadrant search.

491
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,081
We will position ourselves
in the neighborhoods

492
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,369
where we believe Escobar
and his allies might be,

493
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,205
proceed to search them...

494
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,091
and if we don't find
what we're looking for,

495
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,801
we'll process anything of value
and continue on to the next one.

496

- Understood?
- [all] Yes, Colonel!

497

A fucking grid search?

Isn't that how they caught the guy
who shot Abraham Lincoln?

499
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,647
- It's a change.
- Yeah, it's dated and conventional.

500
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,248
Well, we tried going
bullet for bullet with him,

501
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,129
and you saw how that ended up.

502

Oh, so that's it?

503
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,566
A week ago you volunteered
to jump into a chopper with Carrillo

504
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,085
and now it's a change?

505
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,725
Don't worry about it, man. We'll all
feel better once Escobar's in the ground

506
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,162
- one way or another, right?
- There is no other way, Javi.

507

Not a fucking thing.

That son of a bitch turned out to be
