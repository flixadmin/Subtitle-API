1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,960
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,560
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,200
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,800
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,080
<i>Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body</i>

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,160
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,400
<i>In the future, my friends
may not be heroes,</i>

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,880
<i>but if we succeed,
they will be remembered as legends.</i>

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,320
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,400
The flashes I've been having,
they're of Carter.

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,440
It must be really weird feeling like
you're cheating on me with him.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,520
No, Ray...

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,200
I feel like I'm cheating on him
with you.

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,880
We need to move swiftly
to locate Vandal Savage.

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,240
There is one place in time
that we know Savage to be.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,680
2166.

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,160
We have, quite literally,
run out of time.

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,400
We're gonna need to find
a safe place to set down, Gideon.

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,720
<i>I don't believe there are
any safe places, Captain.</i>

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,040
Are we over London yet?

21
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,440
- What's left of it.
- Why's London shooting at us?

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,480
It's Savage's forces
that are doing the shooting.

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,120
Here in 2166, they've subjugated
most of the globe.

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,240
Maybe picking up here
wasn't the brightest idea.

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,840
Unfortunately, we no longer have
the luxury

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,280
of blindly searching
for Savage throughout history.

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,080
Indeed, we have to target Savage
at the time and place

28
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,480
that we're certain he will be,
which is...

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,760
Right before he wastes your family.

30
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,200
- What?
- Yes, Mr. Rory,

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,120
Savage will kill my wife and son
in three days' time,

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,560
but we can save them and the world
by stopping Savage now.

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,520
<i>Captain, I've managed to slip
beneath their artillery fire.</i>

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,840
Set us down on the outskirts
of the city, Gideon,

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,400
near the encampment of the
remaining resistance forces.

36
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,400
We are going to need
to proceed swiftly.

37
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,000
I realize your family is in jeopardy,
but perhaps some deliberation...

38
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,320
We really don't have the time,
Martin.

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,080
According to Gideon,
Savage is going to be out

40
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,840
in the open tonight vulnerable.

41
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,400
Now, in order to capture him,
I require the services of...

42
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,080
- A killer, klepto, and pyro?
- Bingo.

43
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,880
Here we stand at the edge of history.

44
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,080
But as tempting as it might be
to celebrate our previous victories,

45
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,960
it is only for the next
and final battle

46
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,040
that you will be remembered.

47
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,960
There's no way we can grab him here.

48
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,320
Not with an army standing between us.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,680
I'm trying to listen to this guy.

50
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,560
He gives a hell of a speech.

51
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,680
Onward to victory!

52
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,080
Onward to immortality!

53
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,840
Present arms!

54
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,480
- Quick time. Move!
- All set on our end.

55
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,640
Jax is in the Jumpship,
ready to extract you guys.

56
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,000
Especially if, and by if,
I mean when this thing goes south.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,760
Savage's lady friend just made us.

58
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,240
Have faith, Mr. Snart.

59
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,440
Gideon, push in on the woman.

60
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,840
That bracelet she's wearing...

61
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,480
Can you get a clear image?

62
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,120
Oh, my God.

63
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,960
If we don't move real soon,
we could get ourselves killed.

64
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,920
How about we play this like Chicago?

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Could work.

66
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,360
What the hell did you do that for?

67
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,120
We'll take Savage.
You tie up the guards.

68
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,240
Sara, the woman you're fighting,
you need to take her bracelet.

69
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,280
Are you seriously
jewelry shopping right now?

70
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,400
Weapons fired. Weapons fired.

71
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,520
We're outnumbered.

72
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,880
Fall back!

73
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,880
Mr. Jackson, now would be
a good time to pick us up.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,520
What exactly do you think
you were doing back there?

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,000
{\an5}Distracting Savage's pals,
which worked, by the way.

76
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,240
{\an5}Yes, well, I could've been killed.

77
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,720
{\an5}Never said it worked perfectly.

78
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,960
{\an5}At least it wasn't a complete bust.
We found out about Kendra's bracelet.

79
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
What bracelet?

80
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,000
{\an5}My bracelet, I was wearing it
the night of my first death.

81
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,680
That's great.

82
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,280
{\an5}Not the death part. That's terrible.

83
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,360
But you told us that objects present
on the night of your death

84
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,440
can be used to kill Savage.

85
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,960
You're my fiancee. I listen to you.

86
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,920
{\an5}And that's sweet,
but there's still one small problem.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,880
{\an5}It's a bracelet, how are you
supposed to kill Savage with it?

88
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,240
A question we will answer
the moment we have obtained it.

89
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,040
{\an5}We need our resident kleptomaniacs
to steal that bracelet.

90
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,360
<i>Captain, I've detected movement
300m southwest</i>

91
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,720
{\an5}<i>of our position and closing.</i>

92
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,840
{\an5}- Savage's army?
<i>- Negative.</i>

93
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,360
{\an5}<i>I believe they are all that remains
of the resistance forces.</i>

94
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,840
{\an5}I'm going to make contact with them.

95
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,040
{\an5}They might have information on Savage
that we can use to our advantage.

96
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,040
In the meantime, Ms. Lance,
get Ms. Saunders ready.

97
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,120
Ray.

98
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,120
How am I supposed to teach someone
to fight with a piece of jewelry?

99
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,640
{\an5}- Good question.
- It wasn't rhetorical.

100
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,640
{\an5}Thank you, gentlemen,

101
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,560
{\an5}for accompanying me
on this excursion.

102
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,160
{\an5}Oh, no problem.

103
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,920
{\an5}I just love hiking through the woods
in the middle of World War III.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,280
{\an5}What if, instead of encountering
these resistance fighters,

105
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,880
{\an5}we meet up with more
of Savage's forces?

106
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,320
{\an5}Why else do you think I brought
along Firestorm and The Atom?

107
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
Give me one good reason

108
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,400
why we shouldn't blow you
straight to hell.

109
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,320
Better yet, give her several
good reasons.

110
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,000
{\an5}My wife and son live in Whitechapel.

111
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,760
- It was hit hard.
- I know.

112
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,040
{\an5}The same fate will befall you
if you don't accept our help.

113
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,960
How do we know
you're not with Savage?

114
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,800
Because if we were,
you'd be dead right now.

115
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,240
{\an5}Look, feel free to shoot us,
but from the looks of it,

116
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,040
{\an5}you could use all the allies
you can get.

117
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,320
{\an5}Whitechapel fell 11 days ago.

118
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,240
{\an5}We have a lot of refugees.

119
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,840
{\an5}You think your wife and son
are among them?

120
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,440
Sadly, I'm confident
that they're not.

121
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,280
Still, we would like to help
in whatever way we can.

122
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,000
{\an5}Very well; get yourselves acclimated,
and I'll rejoin you shortly.

123
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
Hey.

124
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,400
I would've brought more, but...

125
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,160
Jefferson.

126
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,760
Jefferson, let's,
let's return to the ship,

127
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,880
and we'll bring back
those additional provisions.

128
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
Don't worry.

129
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,120
There's plenty more
where that came from.

130
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,120
We'll be back.

131
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,920
So what did you mean back there,

132
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,440
{\an5}- about your family?
- I'd rather not discuss it.

133
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,480
{\an5}Yeah, I picked up on that.

134
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,160
{\an5}I also picked up on the fact
that we're in London

135
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,120
just a few days before Savage
tries to kill your wife and son,

136
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,680
and you're not trying
to get them to safety.

137
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,720
{\an5}After my first attempt
on Savage in Ancient Egypt,

138
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,240
my very next stop was here in 2166.

139
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,440
I found Miranda and Jonas exactly
where I'd left them, and we,

140
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,920
we raced towards the Waverider,
but we had a run-in

141
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,440
with Savage's shocktroopers.

142
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,640
Miranda and Jonas were cut down.

143
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,400
So, I jumped even further back...

144
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,760
and the outcome
was exactly the same.

145
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,360
I watched my family die
countless times

146
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,520
at the hands of Savage and his forces
before I realized that...

147
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,320
Time wants to happen.

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,880
Funny feeling knowing
that the universe itself

149
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,320
doesn't want you to save your family.

150
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,600
All right, what are you all
playing at?

151
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,120
I retina-scanned the four of you.

152
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
There's no record of you anywhere,

153
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,760
and you and your friends
disappeared 150 years ago.

154
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,120
Believe me when I tell you
it would take about that much time

155
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,600
for us to tell the whole story.

156
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,800
But the most important thing

157
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,840
is that we get as close
to Vandal Savage as possible.

158
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,320
No one gets close to Savage,
especially not now.

159
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,200
Some idiots made an attempt
on his life earlier tonight.

160
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,800
He's gone to ground
in the citadel's bunker

161
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,400
and he's holed up good and tight.

162
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,000
<i>Delta Camp is under attack.
Taking heavy fire.</i>

163
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,160
<i>We need air support.</i>

164
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,320
Where's Delta Camp?

165
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,480
Establish a perimeter!

166
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,560
Once it's secure,
we'll search for survivors.

167
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,240
Last week, Savage's forces
laid waste to Tokyo.

168
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,520
London is the last patch
of free ground on the planet.

169
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,880
Savage's armies have cut down

170
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,040
the most formidable militaries
in the world.

171
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,120
What do you men think you can do
against an evil like this?

172
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,280
There were no survivors
from the attack.

173
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,080
No, whatever weapon
Savage used against the rebels

174
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,760
was quite effective.

175
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,400
Maybe Professor Stein and I
should survey the wreckage,

176
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,760
analyze some soil samples,

177
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,920
determine what kind of weaponry
Savage is using.

178
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,720
Until we figure out a way
to thwart his firepower,

179
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,840
the rebels are as good as dead.

180
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,760
But remember why we're here:
to stop Savage, not to slow him down.

181
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,960
Do we have a plan
for stealing this bracelet?

182
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,880
- We're on it.
- Please don't tell me the plan

183
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,760
is to walk into Savage's citadel
and steal it off her wrist.

184
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,720
All right, I won't tell you that.

185
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,960
All right, well,
we still have the issue

186
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,000
of how to turn a piece of jewelry
into a lethal weapon.

187
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,560
Perhaps there is reference
to the bracelet

188
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,920
in Professor Boardman's diary.

189
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
I doubt it.

190
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,720
I've read through my son's research
a thousand times.

191
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,680
Savage has a devastating weapon
at his command,

192
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,760
and here now, at the 11th hour,

193
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,320
we could sorely use a weapon
of our own.

194
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
I'll look into it.

195
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,080
This is such a waste of time.

196
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,040
I've already looked through
every single page

197
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,520
of Aldus' notebooks.

198
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,280
If he had written something
specific about the bracelet

199
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,240
and killing Savage,
I would have known it already.

200
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
Here it is.

201
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
You ever think about him?

202
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Carter?

203
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,080
I try not to.

204
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,920
It's not like
I'll ever see him again.

205
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,400
Not in this lifetime, anyway.

206
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,720
Besides, Carter is my past.

207
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
Ray is my future.

208
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,280
Still, 4,000-year-long
relationship...

209
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,200
seems like it'd be hard to get over.

210
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,280
Yeah.

211
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,840
Maybe once Savage is gone,
I can finally start to.

212
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,640
Wow.

213
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,800
What's the occasion?

214
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,920
- I'll give you one guess.
- Our anniversary?

215
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,400
Look, I'm sorry, but in my defense,

216
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,800
there's quite a few of them
to remember.

217
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,200
We were only married in...

218
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,120
eight lifetimes.

219
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,440
That's a lot.

220
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,600
But I do remember

221
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,320
your Victorian England incarnation

222
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,240
being particularly tough
to be pinned down.

223
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,400
Why are you handing this to me?

224
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,560
Well, it's an anniversary gift.

225
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,440
You have got to stop giving me
weapons as presents.

226
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,960
I think it's time you learn
how to use it.

227
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,480
But it's your weapon.

228
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,080
Savage has murdered us
countless times,

229
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,200
and we aren't always lucky enough
to die together.

230
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,640
This is awfully depressing talk
for our anniversary, don't you think?

231
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,880
Kendra, this is important.

232
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,920
I need to know that if I go first,

233
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,680
you have everything
you need to face him.

234
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,720
I don't want to think
about facing Savage,

235
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,960
or life, without you.

236
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,720
You'll never be without me,
no matter what.

237
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
I'll always be near.

238
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,600
Just give it a try.

239
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,760
Who's to say
I'll ever be strong enough

240
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,160
to kill Savage by myself?

241
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Just trust me.

242
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,760
You have everything you need.

243
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
What is it?

244
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,720
I think I know
what we can use to kill Savage.

245
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,920
Savage has warned you all
about the radicals who oppose us.

246
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,000
They will not show you
the mercy I just did.

247
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,520
Dismissed.

248
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,760
I said you're dismissed.

249
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,160
Oh, we thought you said "missed."

250
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,840
Whoever you are,
you're certainly persistent.

251
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
Not really.

252
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,040
We just like bright, sparkly objects,
like that bracelet.

253
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,720
You'd risk dying for a bauble?

254
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,200
It works with my outfit.

255
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,120
What now, Mr. Snart?

256
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,680
How do you know my name?

257
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,400
There I was, thinking
we could go a whole week

258
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,880
without kidnapping anyone.

259
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,480
I think you'll find it
would have been better

260
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,360
- to simply kill me.
- I agree.

261
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,880
It's a little more complicated
than that.

262
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,480
She knew who I was.

263
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,920
I know who all of you are.

264
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,240
It's a pleasure to meet you, Gareeb.

265
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,600
I see Savage has been rather
chatty with his lieutenants.

266
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,200
If you think I am merely
Savage's soldier,

267
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,800
you're more idiotic than he claimed.

268
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,560
I'm not his lieutenant.

269
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm his daughter.

270
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,360
Vandal Savage has a daughter?

271
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,720
Apparently it's true.
There's a lid for every pot.

272
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,160
And this lid is gonna be very upset
when he finds out

273
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,240
that we took his pot.

274
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,120
- You know what I mean.
- So what's the problem?

275
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,840
It's not like we're on Savage's
Christmas card list.

276
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,200
And we snagged the bracelet.

277
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,280
You're welcome, by the way.

278
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,040
We need to weaponize
that thing before Savage knows

279
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,880
that it and his daughter
are missing.

280
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,040
Actually, I think I've got that
figured out.

281
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,520
But I'm gonna need you
to burn something for me.

282
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
About time.

283
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,520
We also need to figure out what we're
going to do with our new guest.

284
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,320
She's seen us and the ship.

285
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,240
If she runs back to Savage,
we're giving him a huge advantage.

286
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,600
So we make her our advantage.

287
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,040
We send Papa Savage a finger.

288
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,000
And we keep sending them

289
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,240
till he puts his own head
on the chopping block.

290
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,120
That is a positively lurid idea.

291
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,800
I know we're in the midst of a war,
but can't we maintain our honor?

292
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,240
I'd rather maintain my life,
Professor.

293
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,880
If she is Savage's daughter,

294
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,080
then she would know
the details of his defenses.

295
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,360
Yes, well, how exactly
are we going to get

296
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,520
those details out of her?

297
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
I'm on it.

298
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,560
Hello, Cassie.
May I call you Cassie?

299
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,880
Here's the deal.
You have information.

300
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,240
I want it.

301
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,640
The question is,
how am I gonna get it?

302
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,920
I'm the daughter of Vandal Savage,

303
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,400
the immortal ruler of the world.

304
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,520
Do you think he hasn't prepared me
for this?

305
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,880
Do you think I haven't already
been taught

306
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,920
to endure the most extreme suffering?

307
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,800
You know, your father sounds
a lot like mine.

308
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,520
Could never really say, "I love you,"

309
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,960
except with his fists.

310
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,400
Our fathers are nothing alike,
Mr. Snart.

311
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,920
Fourteen years ago,
the world was ruled by a madman,

312
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Per Degaton.

313
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,240
He unleashed the Armageddon Virus
in order to conquer the globe.

314
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,920
It tore through the world
like a fire.

315
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,880
Millions died, including my mother.

316
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,280
There were riots, wars.
Hell on Earth.

317
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,920
No one dared to stand up to Degaton,
except for my father.

318
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,280
He may not be a kind man,

319
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,960
but he is the only one capable
of putting this world back together.

320
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,840
So you can torture me if you like.

321
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,880
My suffering's a small price to pay.

322
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,640
Who said anything about torture?

323
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,640
You sure you can do this?

324
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,880
Bash Savage's skull
with Carter's mace?

325
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,120
You got a better plan?

326
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,120
It's not the weapon
I'm worried about.

327
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,080
Thousands of years of reincarnation,

328
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,840
and I'm guessing you've killed
a grand total of nobody.

329
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,280
Yet here you are, entering
into the Olympics of murder.

330
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,440
What's your point?

331
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,880
You sure you can look Savage
in the eye and kill him?

332
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,840
- I'm sure.
- Well, you better be.

333
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,120
Otherwise, you're gonna end up
like the last guy

334
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,240
who swung that thing.

335
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,640
Savage's superweapon
isn't an explosive.

336
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,560
The exact conclusion
I've just come to

337
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,960
after examining soil samples
from the attack site.

338
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,040
How did you determine it?

339
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,960
Gideon, she found
a defunct spy satellite.

340
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,760
Look at the photos here.
This is the camp.

341
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,240
And here is the camp,
destroyed.

342
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,360
Look at the impact craters.
Sort of squint your eyes.

343
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
What do they look like?

344
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,360
What am I supposed to be seeing?

345
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,760
Oh, my God.

346
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,600
Those are not impact craters.

347
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
They're footprints.

348
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,280
Sir, we've located
the rebels responsible

349
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,520
for your daughter's abduction.

350
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,560
The Leviathan is two clicks
from their encampment.

351
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,880
Find my daughter.

352
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,760
And burn them all.

353
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,280
He's coming for me.

354
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,240
Yeah, you and a bunch
of innocent refugees.

355
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,560
If they were innocent,

356
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,280
they wouldn't have rebelled
against my father.

357
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,360
Whatever it is, it's getting closer.

358
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,720
Well, we're a little short
on weapons.

359
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,960
Look, if we can't outrun it,
we'll just have to fight it.

360
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,120
Well, I mean, we can...

361
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
But what about them?

362
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,760
This way. Move along.

363
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,560
Everything's all right. Move along.

364
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,640
Everything's fine.

365
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,920
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

366
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,600
Saving a township,
by the looks of it.

367
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,400
Since when did my vessel
become a life raft?

368
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,200
Since I decided we can't leave
these people here to be slaughtered.

369
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,840
You recruited us to save the world.

370
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,160
That includes everyone here.

371
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,840
Gideon, power the engines
and get us into the air

372
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,840
the moment the last refugee
is aboard.

373
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,240
And get the weapons system online.

374
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,760
What's happening?

375
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,440
It would seem Savage
has come back for his baby girl.

376
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,240
<i>The last of the refugees
are aboard, Captain.</i>

377
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
Strap yourself in.

378
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
Gideon, external floodlights
to maximum.

379
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,920
- That's...
- Incredible.

380
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,400
Fire! Now!

381
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,520
Hold on to something!

382
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,240
Fire, Gideon! Fire everything!

383
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,400
Now might be a good time
to start praying.

384
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,040
- Gideon, what's our status?
- I'm gonna go with "lousy."

385
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,200
Shut down all essential systems
so Savage's robot...

386
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,120
<i>Too late, Captain,
apparently, it has determined</i>

387
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,880
<i>you are still alive, because it is
closing in on our location.</i>

388
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,680
- What happened?
- We seem to have encountered

389
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
Savage's megaweapon.

390
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,920
And he kicked our ass.

391
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,240
Gideon, how much time do we have?

392
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,920
<i>I estimate the robot should reach
our location within the hour.</i>

393
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,240
<i>Our propulsion engine was severely
damaged in the crash</i>

394
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,600
<i>and is no longer functioning.</i>

395
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,920
So where does that leave us?

396
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,920
All right, our only option
is to take the Jumpship

397
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
and try and outrun it.

398
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,840
The Jumpship seats seven.
The cargo bay's filled with refugees.

399
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,320
- I'm well aware.
- Well, we can't

400
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,840
just leave them there, we...

401
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,720
Martin!

402
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,840
Professor, you are gonna be
just fine. I promise you.

403
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,400
Grey, what happened?

404
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,640
You have to take care of them.

405
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,760
Don't worry. We got the team's back.

406
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,200
No. The people. Those children.

407
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,400
You can't leave them here.

408
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,880
You can't, you can't...

409
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,600
<i>I've administered a mild sedative.</i>

410
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,760
<i>He should be comfortable.</i>

411
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,360
Which is more than can be said
for the rest of us.

412
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,120
I was wrong. Your dad's a gem.

413
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,240
He's just doing what he must
to save his daughter.

414
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,920
Whatever you say. Now, where was I?

415
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,880
Oh, right. Convincing you to help us.

416
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,400
What a charming euphemism
for interrogation.

417
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,760
I know what you're thinking,
"My dad may not be perfect,

418
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,040
but deep down, he's not a bad guy."

419
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,440
What are you doing?

420
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,320
Showing you that when it comes
to crap fathers,

421
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,800
there is no "deep down."

422
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
After you.

423
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,880
These are the ones we could save.

424
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,520
The rest are ash,
much like Delta Camp.

425
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,400
You don't know my father at all

426
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,760
if you think his daughter
could be so easily manipulated.

427
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,120
Just trying to show you the truth.

428
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,680
The truth is,
my father was trying to save me.

429
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,400
From what, untrained civilians
with barely any weapons?

430
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,040
Your father sent a 200ft robot
to level a bunch of tents.

431
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,160
The people in that camp
were rebels, dangerous radicals.

432
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,160
Please. Do these people
look like radicals to you?

433
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,640
They're nobodies, everyday folk
hoping to survive

434
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,400
your father's reign of terror.

435
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,400
Look, took me a long time
to accept my old man was a monster.

436
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,160
I'm betting you're smarter
than I am.

437
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,640
At last, something we agree on.

438
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,760
Oh, Per Degaton didn't release
the Armageddon Virus.

439
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,920
That was your father.

440
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
Impossible.

441
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,640
He was only Per Degaton's tutor.

442
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,160
One, Per Degaton was only
a teenager at the time.

443
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,640
Two, he was hardly
a criminal mastermind.

444
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,640
Your father, however...

445
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,320
What makes you think
I'd believe anything you tell me?

446
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,240
Because seeing is believing.

447
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,880
Gideon, show her the footage.

448
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,600
Kasnia, November 3rd, 2147.

449
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,400
<i>The world's population
is unsustainable at current levels.</i>

450
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,120
<i>The herd must be thinned.</i>

451
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,000
This isn't true.

452
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,960
You're a liar.

453
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,320
Correct. But not about this.

454
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,440
And you know it...

455
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,480
deep down.

456
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,680
How are repairs coming?

457
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,360
Are repairs coming?

458
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,200
Not in 30 minutes,

459
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,800
which is about as much time
as we have.

460
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,880
We brought all those people
on board,

461
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,440
and all we've bought them is an extra
few minutes to live in fear.

462
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,120
Well, I guess the question is,
what do we do with those minutes?

463
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,560
The ship is crippled!

464
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,320
Everyone aboard is as dead as my...

465
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Family?

466
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,840
Look, I know that you think
the universe wants them dead,

467
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,240
but I don't, I don't believe in fate.

468
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,560
I believe in choices.

469
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,040
And we can choose,
we can choose to fight,

470
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,640
even if the fight may be futile.

471
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,120
We can save your family, Rip.

472
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,840
It's not impossible.
All we have to do...

473
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,200
Is kill Vandal Savage,

474
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,240
the chances of which appear
to be fading.

475
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,040
Not anymore.

476
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,440
I figured out how to do it.

477
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,760
And my new bestie
and I can get us in.

478
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,440
And I think I've got a way
to stop the giant robot

479
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,560
that's coming to kill us.

480
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,240
Now, you may not believe in fate,
Raymond, but I certainly do.

481
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,840
And perhaps it was fate
that compelled me

482
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,400
to bring you seven together

483
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,880
so we can change this future
once and for all.

484
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,800
- Hey.
- Hey.

485
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,560
So I'm going to take on
an immortal madman,

486
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,760
and you are fighting a giant robot.

487
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,960
I can't believe this is our life.

488
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,080
Well, take him out, and it won't be.

489
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
You can do this.

490
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,520
- Ray, if anything...
- No, no.

491
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,440
Save it for after you destroy Savage.

492
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,120
Sounds like it's getting closer.

493
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,200
How's it going back there?

494
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,400
You tell me. This is your nutso idea.

495
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,920
It's not that nutso when you consider
the theoretical possibility

496
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,280
that siphoning power
from the auxiliary time drive

497
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,400
should provide enough power

498
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,120
to reverse the polarity
of the dwarf star matrix.

499
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,360
Sorry, Ray, I'm falling asleep
back here, man.

500
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,920
- Okay. I think we're done.
- All right.

501
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,160
You know, if this doesn't work...

502
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,320
I'll turn every cell
in my body inside out?

503
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,760
I was gonna go with "die," but yeah.

504
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,560
You know, we could've escaped
on the Jumpship,

505
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,120
but we're doing this
to save everybody

506
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,440
that we brought on the Waverider.

507
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,680
You're the real hero here, Ray.

508
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,600
All right. Stand back.

509
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,320
No. Like, way back.

510
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
All right.

511
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,400
Here we go.

512
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,080
It works. I'm not dead.

513
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
Yet.

514
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,720
Okay, let's do this.

515
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
Okay. Come on.

516
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,720
Ray, you got this.

517
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,200
The Leviathan
is encountering resistance.

518
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,480
Impossible.

519
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,840
Dr. Palmer.

520
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,160
- Clever.
- Sir?

521
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,040
What?

522
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,280
I've been so worried.

523
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,520
How did you...

524
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,760
I am your daughter.

525
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,760
Did you really think some
rabble could hold me captive?

526
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,840
Rabble?

527
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,720
These are the time travelers
I warned you of.

528
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,960
Father?

529
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
Your bracelet.

530
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,800
It's gone.

531
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,200
I... I must have lost it
in my escape.

532
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,680
As the person who tutored you
in the art of deceit,

533
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,280
you cannot fool me, Cassandra.

534
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,840
Like you fooled me?

535
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,280
You told me my mother died
from the Armageddon Virus.

536
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,000
But you were the one who released it.

537
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,720
Tell me it isn't true.

538
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,400
I might even pretend to believe you.

539
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,200
Let me go.

540
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,000
Call them.

541
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,120
Call the ones
that you no doubt helped

542
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,120
gain access to my bunker.

543
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,840
No need to trouble yourself,
Miss Savage.

544
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,720
We're already here.

545
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,400
Oh, I admire your command
of irony, Gareeb...

546
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,720
Using my own child against me.

547
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,880
Sorry to say it didn't take much.

548
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,440
None at all, you ass.

549
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,480
They showed me the truth
of what you've done.

550
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,600
- The innocent...
- Do not speak

551
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,920
as if you know anything

552
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,120
about ruling a people.

553
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,840
Do you really want to align your fate

554
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,600
with these pretenders?

555
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,760
They're nothing but grains of sand
in the desert of time.

556
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,560
You are a monster.

557
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,040
Don't just wrestle with him.

558
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
Remember, you got laser blasters.

559
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,880
Actually, they're compressed
light beams.

560
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,760
Well, whatever they're called,
just hit him with them.

561
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,040
Oh, come on! Yeah!

562
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,440
She's here.

563
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,160
I can sense her.

564
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,880
You do realize
that she can do me no harm?

565
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,800
Clearly, you didn't get the memo.

566
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,320
I could really get used to this.

567
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,360
Stay on him, Ray. Stay on him.

568
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,160
I had it covered.

569
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,240
Sure, you did.

570
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,320
Get up, Ray! Ray, get up!

571
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,480
This is for Carter.

572
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,760
Your love...

573
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,280
Reincarnated.

574
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,480
He doesn't even remember
who he was,

575
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,120
and he never will.

576
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,360
What?

577
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,760
When I first discovered him,

578
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,960
when I found out that he had
no idea about his real identity,

579
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,800
I took my precautions

580
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,200
and I locked his mind away.

581
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,160
You brainwashed him!

582
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,240
Come on!

583
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,880
Strike me down.

584
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,000
Kill me.

585
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,720
But do so knowing
that I am the only one

586
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,320
holding the key to his mind.

587
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,240
Get up, Ray. Get up.

588
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,240
Rip said you told him you don't
believe in fate, just choices.

589
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,320
<i>Well, you got a choice
to make right now.</i>

590
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,640
You got to choose to get up
and fight.

591
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,360
You got to choose to live.

592
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
Come on!

593
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,280
That's what I'm talking about, baby!

594
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,000
- Kendra, what are you waiting for?
- Finish him!

595
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,880
- Destroy me, and you doom him.
- It's Carter.

596
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,440
The reinforcements are coming!

597
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,600
Whatever you plan on doing,
Kendra, do it!

598
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,600
If I kill Savage,
his mind will be lost.

599
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,720
And if you don't,
I will lose my wife and son.

600
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,200
Well, my love,
what's it gonna be, huh?

601
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,080
Come on!

602
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,120
I can't.

603
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,400
I'm so sorry, Rip. I can't.

604
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,080
We need to get them
back to the ship.

605
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,120
Both of them.

606
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,560
You!

607
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,680
What's to keep me from killing you
where you stand?

608
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,360
Because she's an asset to the cause.

609
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,240
My father may be incapacitated,

610
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,720
but his forces are still strong.

611
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,160
I know their tactics,
their weaknesses.

612
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,520
Why the change of heart?

613
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,240
Ask him.

614
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,720
Hey. I saw Sara.

615
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,040
She said you brought Savage
back onto the ship,

616
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,560
but she was a little stingy
on the details.

617
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,160
Is everything okay?

618
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
Ray...

619
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,240
we need to talk.

620
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,360
Welcome back.

621
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,560
Well, the team managed
to capture Savage,

622
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,800
battle his army and a giant robot

623
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,640
and you managed to sleep
through all of it.

624
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,680
The refugees...

625
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,760
They're safe.

626
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,760
Every one of them is alive and well.

627
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
But for how long?

628
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,560
Apparently, time wants to happen.

629
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,880
Oh, I think you'll find that time,
for once...

630
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,200
is on our side.

631
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,560
Now, if you'll excuse me,

632
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,400
I have to pay a visit
to an old friend.

633
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,840
Well, you seem quite happy
for a man behind bars.

634
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,760
Why shouldn't I be happy?

635
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,280
It seems that you once again
have failed to kill me.

636
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,200
A momentary setback, I assure you.

637
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,320
Assure yourself.

638
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,640
Providence has allowed me

639
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,760
to place Chay-Ara
in an impossible situation.

640
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,760
a choice between
her own soul mate, Carter...

641
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,040
and yours.

642
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,800
You know, a friend recently
suggested to me

643
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,840
that there is no such thing as fate.

644
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,520
Destiny is nothing more
than the sum of our own choices.

645
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,880
I see.

646
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,920
So you still
think there's hope, then

647
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,960
for your family.

648
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,760
Time will tell, Captain.

649
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,440
Time will tell.
