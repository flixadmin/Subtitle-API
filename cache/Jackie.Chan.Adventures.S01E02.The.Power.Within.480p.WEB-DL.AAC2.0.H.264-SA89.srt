1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,635
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>Jackie chan adventures</i>

2
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:05,771
this is Jade, your niece.

3
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:07,039
I have a niece?

4
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:09,742
I cannot read
these inscriptions.

5
00:00:09,744 --> 00:00:11,777
Very old writing.

6
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:13,379
The dark hand
has connections

7
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:15,681
to nearly every criminal
activity in existence.

8
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,783
Their leader is valmont.

9
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:20,819
You're telling me
one man stopped you?

10
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:22,988
Tohru, bring me the shield.

11
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:25,057
Uncle: Jackie!

12
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:27,893
I have found what
the inscriptions mean.

13
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:30,429
They are incantations,

14
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,264
but the shield
not important.

15
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:35,034
Of course the shield
is important, uncle.

16
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:37,803
Everybody I meet today
wants the shield.

17
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,939
Shield not important.

18
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:44,376
The talisman in the center
of the shield is.

19
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:47,246
That is where
the magic lies.

20
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:54,753
Shendu: Valmont,
are your men blind?

21
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:57,056
It would seem
- those possessed of sight

22
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:58,424
might have taken note

23
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:03,162
that the shield
contained no talisman.

24
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:06,165
Why's the boss taking guff
from a statue?

25
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,834
Uh, 'cause it talks.

26
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:13,305
Now, if my promise to you
of unspoiled riches

27
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:15,908
were as empty
as that shield...

28
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,243
Rest assured, shendu,

29
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,512
you <i> will</i>
have your talisman,

30
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:23,482
and I <i> will</i> ensure
that Jackie chan

31
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:26,452
never again interferes
with the dark hand...

32
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,986
Ever.

33
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,039
Jade: Chinese food?

34
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,475
I just moved here
from Hong Kong.

35
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,144
Can't we get
some Tex-mex?

36
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:26,411
Jackie...

37
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:29,481
The rooster talisman
possesses enormous power.

38
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,917
What's it do?

39
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,485
Manners, Jade.

40
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:42,861
Ancient legend
speaks of 12 talismans--

41
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:47,599
one for each animal
of the Chinese zodiac,

42
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:51,603
each possessing
a different magic.

43
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,305
What <i> kind</i> of magic?

44
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:54,506
Jackie: Jade...

45
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:58,110
Legend also says
the talismans were scattered

46
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:00,712
to the 4 corners
of the globe.

47
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:05,951
If this or any talisman
should fall into evil hands...

48
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,452
Jackie'll
give 'em smackie

49
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,922
with his lightning
fists of steel!

50
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,394
Hey, when are you gonna
teach me some of your moves?

51
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:16,628
Later, Jade.

52
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,696
Humph.

53
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,797
Uncle,

54
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,099
do you really believe
in such a myth?

55
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,201
Ow!

56
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:24,136
Does that answer
your question?

57
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:25,737
Jade: Jackie,
check me out!

58
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,339
I got the moves!

59
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,907
Hee-yah!

60
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,075
Jade?

61
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,543
Not indoors!

62
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,447
Aah!

63
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,550
Fire!

64
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,024
Aah!

65
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,631
My niece
is very sorry.

66
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:53,966
Whoa!
Aren't you,
niece?

67
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:54,633
I am such a dork.

68
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,306
I was just
trying to get you
to teach me, Jackie.

69
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:04,376
The wise seek power
within themselves.

70
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:06,645
The foolish seek it
within others.

71
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,313
Until you
harness the power

72
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,816
within yourself,
I cannot teach you.

73
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:12,417
Huh?

74
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,586
It means you must
have the discipline

75
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,856
to behave yourself.
Now eat your food.

76
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:19,691
Power within.
Got it.

77
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,663
Mmm.

78
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,632
Don't eat
like a baboon!

79
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,867
You should
chew your food.

80
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,035
(Swallowing and gulping)

81
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:32,471
<i>Hello?</i> Chew soup?

82
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:33,872
Help me out here.

83
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,574
She's your niece.

84
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,179
(Swallowing)

85
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,215
Ahh.
Tastes like chicken.

86
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,686
Ooh, dessert!

87
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,426
"Danger looms
in your future."

88
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:57,062
We must be very cautious.

89
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,231
Pff.
You listen to a cookie?

90
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,266
Evenin', chan.

91
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:04,269
Never mock the cookie.

92
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,138
Where's the talisman?

93
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,811
Come on, let's go.
Man: Check, please.

94
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,047
Hgggh!

95
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:16,481
Go, Jackie!

96
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,676
Unnh!

97
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,745
Ha!

98
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,547
Leave the rough stuff
to Jackie.

99
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:49,848
(Grunts)

100
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,918
Go, uncle.

101
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,426
Thank you
for dining with us.

102
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,595
(Gasps)

103
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:05,130
The talisman!

104
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,734
It was right there.
They took it!

105
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,802
Come on.
We can catch 'em.

106
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,171
Stay with uncle.

107
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,040
Come. Sit.

108
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,710
(Gasps)
The restaurant manager!

109
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,712
He looks <i> very</i> angry.

110
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,947
Where?

111
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,351
Ayah.

112
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,456
Mr. valmont, sir.

113
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,458
It didn't go
quite as planned.

114
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,860
Regale me.

115
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:37,696
Well,
- we stomped chan.

116
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:39,698
Stomped him good.

117
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,434
But we didn't
see any talisman.

118
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,237
You will be punished.

119
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,575
Shendu: Hindsight, valmont.

120
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,945
But perhaps the blind
<i>can</i> be made to see

121
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,047
with the eyes of a dragon.

122
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,208
"Stay with uncle."

123
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,410
Tcch.
- Didn't say <i> which</i> uncle.

124
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,022
Who has the keys?

125
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:38,490
He's coming!

126
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,129
(Jackie panting)

127
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,403
Hmm.

128
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,582
(Screams)

129
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,083
What's the big--

130
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:06,618
oh. Uh, hi.

131
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,086
You followed me?

132
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,955
What do you hear
when I talk?

133
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,990
Tell me, does it
sound like blah blah,

134
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,558
blah blah, blah blah
blah blah blah?

135
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,693
Jackie.

136
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:17,329
This is not funny.
This is dangerous.

137
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,663
(Muffled)

138
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,333
See?

139
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,468
Dangerous.

140
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,342
Come on!

141
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,414
Aren't you
gonna whomp 'em?

142
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,983
(Panting) Ancient
Chinese proverb--

143
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:40,252
do not fight
when you can run.

144
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:49,861
(Panting)

145
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,429
You go that way.
But--

146
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,832
go! You'll be safer
away from me.

147
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,835
(Panting)

148
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,206
Huh?

149
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,747
Why are they chasing <i> me?</i>

150
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,653
Please have 4 wheels.

151
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,958
(Grunting)

152
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,793
Yes!

153
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,296
Nooo!

154
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,541
Jade!

155
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,579
Sorry. I'll bring it
right back.

156
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:41,746
Whoa!

157
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:50,855
Ohhhh!

158
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,441
Jackie, you rule!

159
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,877
(Gasps)

160
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,045
Aaaah!

161
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:48,546
Whoa! Hey, kid,
watch where you're going!

162
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:49,648
No!

163
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,183
Huh?

164
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,692
How'd I do that?

165
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,666
Whoa!

166
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,200
Whoa!

167
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:11,002
Jackie!

168
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,146
No cutting in line.

169
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,281
(Grunting)

170
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,503
Jackie!

171
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,805
Grab on!

172
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,247
Help.

173
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,316
Why do you want the girl?

174
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:09,828
Unnh!

175
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,102
Oh, ninja-man...

176
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,606
(Grunting)

177
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,313
I don't understand
why they were after--

178
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,848
Jackie, the coolest thing
ever happened.

179
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,316
I went right off the bridge,
but I didn't fall.

180
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:32,550
I, like, stopped in midair,

181
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,586
and then I ran back
just like in cartoons.

182
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,354
I can fly.

183
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,323
Jade,
enough fooling around.

184
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:41,359
Fooling around?
I just saved your butt!

185
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,560
Language, Jade.

186
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,362
The dark hand
is after you,

187
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,364
and I want to know why.

188
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:47,499
Unh.

189
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,003
The talisman.

190
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,672
I don't have it!
You guys have it.

191
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:55,807
Don'tcha?

192
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:56,975
Ungh.

193
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,811
Oh, uh...

194
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:01,913
Tohru: The tracker
points to the girl,

195
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:04,649
but she does not
have the talisman.

196
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:07,485
Well, it must be hidden
on her <i> somewhere,</i> tohru.

197
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,654
I'm sure she didn't eat it.

198
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,857
Shendu:
Man <i> is</i> much the wiser

199
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,794
when he looks within.

200
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,328
I understand.

201
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,598
And while you're at it...

202
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,534
Eliminate Jackie chan.

203
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,103
Jade: Hello?

204
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:27,539
Let me out of here!
I mean it!

205
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,774
Just wait'll
- the jackinator comes to.

206
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,543
You guys are gonna get
<i>so</i> creamed.

207
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:32,977
Jade?

208
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,078
Jackinator?

209
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,947
(Elevator bell rings)

210
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,722
Tohru: Aha.

211
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,960
Aha, what?
What's aha?

212
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:51,329
What are you
gonna do with that?

213
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,500
Oh, boy.

214
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,047
The rooster thing's
in my stomach.

215
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,316
But when did I--

216
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,817
the restaurant!
- The restaurant!

217
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:15,520
How could you not notice
you swallowed a golf ball?

218
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,589
I told you
to chew your food.

219
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:19,057
It was soup!

220
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:25,363
Never mind. We have
to get you out of here

221
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,732
before he gets
the talisman out of you.

222
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,701
The <i> magic</i> uncle
was talking about.

223
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,035
I'll fly out!

224
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,437
(Groaning)

225
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,306
(Straining)

226
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,308
Jade,
even if you could fly--

227
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,710
and I'm not saying you can--

228
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,045
you are tied down
to a big, heavy table

229
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,047
which is bolted
to the floor!

230
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,482
Jade: Grrr!

231
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,353
Jackie: Jade?

232
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,221
Whoa.

233
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:56,227
Oh...You're
tele-tele-tele--

234
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,663
you can move things
with your mind!

235
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,832
No, with my stomach!
(Gasps)

236
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:02,901
Hold still.

237
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,772
Focus, focus,
focus, focus, focus.

238
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,073
Grrrrrr!

239
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,409
Why do you growl?

240
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,177
Heh?

241
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,079
Ungh!

242
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,452
Guess I have that
"power within"
you were talking about.

243
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:24,122
Not what I meant.
Now cut yourself free!

244
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,523
Uh, right.

245
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,927
(Grunting and groaning)

246
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:35,033
(Elevator bell rings)

247
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,735
Yo, big t, what's all
the racket down--

248
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:40,138
chan.

249
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,874
Jade,
run...Fly...Something!

250
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:44,042
Whoa!

251
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,109
Huh?

252
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,210
Get the girl.

253
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:48,146
Payback time, Jackson.

254
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,623
Nyah-nyah!

255
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:46,204
I <i> hate</i> fish.

256
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,106
Why fight
when you can run?

257
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,774
You're learning.

258
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,043
This way!

259
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,949
(Elevator bell rings)

260
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,195
And when
you <i> can't</i> run?

261
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,864
Don't watch.

262
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,166
Tcha. Like I'm
not gonna watch.

263
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:26,911
Nooo!

264
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:27,979
Unh!

265
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,380
I can take him!

266
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,548
Hee-yah!

267
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,216
Uhhh-uhhh-ahh.

268
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,618
(Grunting)

269
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,154
Whoa!

270
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,012
Stop helping!

271
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:02,547
Stop helping!

272
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:03,981
Heh. Sorry.

273
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,118
Jackie!

274
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:11,989
Gotta hit tohru

275
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,759
with the biggest thing
I can find...

276
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,327
Himself!

277
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:17,628
Hoowahh!

278
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,537
Huh?

279
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:29,874
(Grunts)
He's big.

280
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,843
Can't hold much longer.

281
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,079
Oh, no.

282
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,380
(Grunts) Unh.

283
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:38,816
Whoa!

284
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,134
Heh, sorry.

285
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,842
I'm telling you,
uncle was right.

286
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:07,612
The talismans <i> do</i>
possess magic powers.

287
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:10,615
Of course they do,
Jackie.

288
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,084
Now, why don't you
get some sleep.

289
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,920
All my stuff?

290
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,655
How'd it get here?

291
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,857
Until we can take down
the dark hand,

292
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:22,994
it's safer for you here
inside section 13.

293
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,996
I hope
it feels like home.

294
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,765
But...What about uncle?

295
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:31,936
<i>Good</i> magic is stronger
than <i> bad</i> magic.

296
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,907
He refused to move.
Something about

297
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:38,976
messing up his
feng shui something.

298
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,912
Uncle is
very stubborn.

299
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,649
Stomach successfully pumped.

300
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,083
(Groaning)

301
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,818
Cock-a-doodle-do.

302
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,420
What about her?

303
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,593
I trust you'll keep
your niece in check.

304
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,128
(Jade gasps)

305
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,729
Does this mean
I'm a secret agent?

306
00:19:58,731 --> 00:19:59,897
No!
- No!

307
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,032
Ohh!

308
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:07,572
Emmanuel: Hey, Jackie.

309
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:09,440
Why do you do all your
own stunts in your movies?

310
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:12,076
I was doing stunts
so many years.

311
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,278
The audience see
the actor or the bad guy--

312
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,479
they do all the stunts,

313
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,747
then the audience
just clapped.

314
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,282
Then I look at my friend,

315
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,685
"hey, that's not the actor.
That's me."

316
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:22,620
Then I promised myself,
one day,

317
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:25,957
when I become a star,
I want to do my own stunts.

318
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,491
I will turn around,
let the audience see
that's me,

319
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:28,993
that's not the double.

320
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:32,897
And also, I want
to show my children,
my grandchildren,

321
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,699
look, that's
your grandfather.

322
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,867
That's your--your father.

323
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,569
And besides...

324
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,104
I just like it.
