1
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:10,705
Hey!

2
00:01:12,297 --> 00:01:14,307
What happened to him?

3
00:01:23,797 --> 00:01:26,877
Where did you get that?
What are you doing here?

4
00:01:30,213 --> 00:01:32,103
I just want to return.

5
00:01:33,338 --> 00:01:35,368
Think he's a refugee?

6
00:01:44,755 --> 00:01:47,835
Well, you look like you've been
through some real shit to me.

7
00:01:47,922 --> 00:01:50,422
- You could probably use some food.
- Mm.

8
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:52,545
- I'm all right.
- Nonsense.

9
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,840
Erna loves stray dogs. Come on.

10
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,130
Agnes, go get Erna.

11
00:03:04,463 --> 00:03:05,563
Now.

12
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:17,215
Where were you stationed?

13
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:25,545
Eastern front.

14
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:29,857
- Labour camp.
- They aren't human over there.

15
00:03:29,922 --> 00:03:32,352
That's a war we should've won.

16
00:03:36,672 --> 00:03:38,952
Do you have a place to sleep?

17
00:03:46,213 --> 00:03:48,963
Tell your brother to
get the small room ready.

18
00:03:49,047 --> 00:03:51,097
But only for a few days.

19
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,590
Until you're back on your feet.

20
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,340
This is going to sound strange.

21
00:03:58,505 --> 00:04:00,595
But what year is it, please?

22
00:04:03,672 --> 00:04:06,422
They really worked you
hard out there, didn't they?

23
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:10,368
It's 1921.

24
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,210
1921...

25
00:05:51,172 --> 00:05:53,342
24 June 2020

26
00:05:53,422 --> 00:05:56,842
3 days until the Apocalypse

27
00:06:29,463 --> 00:06:31,463
You and I are perfect for each other.

28
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:36,048
Never believe anything else.

29
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:11,021
Yeah.

30
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:14,257
Mrs. Doppler called in sick.
She's not coming in.

31
00:07:14,282 --> 00:07:16,122
What's wrong with her?

32
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,960
Don't think she said.

33
00:07:19,088 --> 00:07:20,708
Just a minute.

34
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:25,318
You're Mr. Wöller, right?

35
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,010
Yeah.

36
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:31,338
Then we're in for a fun time.

37
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:37,005
- Do you have a car?
- Mm-hm.

38
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,910
Wonderful.

39
00:08:29,297 --> 00:08:32,627
<i>Call from Hannah Kahnwald</i>

40
00:09:30,588 --> 00:09:32,458
Where did you get this?

41
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,300
- Who is that?
- It's complicated.

42
00:09:45,172 --> 00:09:47,002
Mum, why do you have that?

43
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:52,443
Do you want me to
make some breakfast?

44
00:10:06,588 --> 00:10:08,638
What do we do with Mum?

45
00:10:09,713 --> 00:10:11,343
I have no idea.

46
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:29,307
What are you doing here?

47
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:33,797
- Martha.
- Franziska.

48
00:10:33,822 --> 00:10:36,652
- What do you want!
- We need to talk.

49
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:43,125
What?

50
00:10:43,213 --> 00:10:45,713
If you think I'll say
sorry, you can forget it.

51
00:10:45,797 --> 00:10:49,267
You fucked up, but I shouldn't
have said what I said.

52
00:10:49,588 --> 00:10:50,908
We're even.

53
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,630
Am I the babysitter while
you make out in here?

54
00:10:55,713 --> 00:10:57,553
Why did you bring her along?

55
00:10:57,578 --> 00:11:00,618
Because our parents haven't
been home for 2 days.

56
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:02,843
I can't just leave her there alone.

57
00:11:05,338 --> 00:11:07,628
Why is everyone acting so weird?

58
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,825
I want to know what's going on.

59
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,108
You're going to go into the caves?

60
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,590
You don't have to come.

61
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:46,628
You slept for almost 24 hours.

62
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:54,705
Who are you?

63
00:11:57,963 --> 00:12:02,013
Everyone says that Erna
can't turn away a stray dog.

64
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:09,312
I'm not right here.

65
00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:13,783
This isn't right here.

66
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:19,505
Hm.

67
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,090
At first I pictured you differently.

68
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,390
What's that supposed to mean?

69
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,680
Why did you say that?

70
00:13:13,547 --> 00:13:15,547
"Sic mundus creatus est."

71
00:14:22,672 --> 00:14:24,462
Can I help you?

72
00:14:25,922 --> 00:14:28,262
Hi. I'm here looking for someone.

73
00:14:29,005 --> 00:14:32,005
She used to work here, a while back.

74
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:34,682
Tiedemann. Claudia Tiedemann.

75
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:39,147
She used to run the facility.
You know where I can find her?

76
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:41,111
There's only one Tiedemann here.

77
00:14:41,136 --> 00:14:43,626
Aleksander Tiedemann,
the guy in charge.

78
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:46,837
Aleksander Tiedemann?

79
00:14:48,563 --> 00:14:50,252
So that was why you wouldn't let

80
00:14:50,277 --> 00:14:52,737
Ulrich Nielsen onto the property?

81
00:14:53,672 --> 00:14:56,962
After Fukushima, safety
standards were raised.

82
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,130
I can't just let people walk in here.

83
00:15:01,297 --> 00:15:04,041
His assumption that his
son could be here somewhere

84
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:06,081
was completely unfounded.

85
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:09,278
Do you know about
the door in the cave?

86
00:15:10,922 --> 00:15:12,802
Installed in the '80s.

87
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,550
It was already welded shut
back then as a security measure.

88
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:20,710
- It's still shut to this day.
- You know what I find a bit strange?

89
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,942
Everyone who was born here stays.

90
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:29,057
That's quite unusual
for a town of this size.

91
00:15:31,005 --> 00:15:32,605
Why is that?

92
00:15:33,588 --> 00:15:35,288
What do you think?

93
00:15:36,422 --> 00:15:39,252
The nuclear plant has always provided.

94
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:41,383
There's work.

95
00:15:41,463 --> 00:15:43,463
Prosperity, security.

96
00:15:48,838 --> 00:15:51,398
Although that's likely to change now.

97
00:15:52,297 --> 00:15:54,357
When we close the facility.

98
00:15:57,255 --> 00:16:01,125
- You're not from around here.
- No. Why?

99
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,303
In 1986 you came to Winden.

100
00:16:08,338 --> 00:16:10,658
That's the same time
the kid disappeared.

101
00:16:10,922 --> 00:16:12,382
Mads Nielsen.

102
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:15,147
Ulrich Nielsen's brother.

103
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:17,515
No. I came later.

104
00:16:18,505 --> 00:16:20,005
A few weeks.

105
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:24,053
How's that relevant?

106
00:16:33,213 --> 00:16:34,713
I guess it isn't.

107
00:16:51,463 --> 00:16:52,963
One more thing.

108
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:56,498
What made you take
your wife's last name?

109
00:16:58,047 --> 00:16:59,707
Why do you ask?

110
00:17:00,422 --> 00:17:03,312
Pretty unusual, especially back then.

111
00:17:05,797 --> 00:17:08,207
The Tiedemanns shaped
this city, Inspector.

112
00:17:08,297 --> 00:17:10,307
Especially Regina's mother.

113
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,210
Regina has no siblings.

114
00:17:13,713 --> 00:17:17,363
- We wanted to keep the name alive.
- What is your real name?

115
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:21,955
Köhler.

116
00:17:22,463 --> 00:17:23,953
Aleksander Köhler.

117
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,510
Who's next on the list?

118
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:39,788
Wöller.

119
00:17:46,547 --> 00:17:48,207
Hannah Kahnwald.

120
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:05,058
Why do you have a gun and
someone else's passport?

121
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:09,013
They're for insurance.

122
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,875
Insurance?

123
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:17,675
There's someone very interested
in keeping those things hidden.

124
00:18:20,797 --> 00:18:22,397
So it's blackmail?

125
00:18:23,963 --> 00:18:25,633
Who are you?

126
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:30,422
Who am I?

127
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:35,617
Who are you?

128
00:18:38,797 --> 00:18:40,127
Hannah?

129
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:55,132
I'm sorry, but we have to tell someone.

130
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,550
Thanks for getting here so soon.

131
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,210
I know none of this
makes any sense, but...

132
00:19:04,922 --> 00:19:07,002
this is Jonas. He...

133
00:19:07,297 --> 00:19:10,195
he's much older, but he knows
where my Jonas is

134
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,231
and where Ulrich is.

135
00:19:21,797 --> 00:19:25,619
You're the man Regina was
talking about, from the hotel.

136
00:19:28,672 --> 00:19:30,512
Who are these people?

137
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,760
This man here, the priest.

138
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,180
Do you know who he is?

139
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:45,048
That is Noah.

140
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:48,007
Are you sure?

141
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,395
What do you know about him?

142
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:57,372
- He's one of them.
- What is this?

143
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,190
One of whom?

144
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,630
Of Sic Mundus.

145
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:05,957
The travellers.

146
00:20:06,713 --> 00:20:08,213
The travellers?

147
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:11,358
Sic mundus creatus est?

148
00:20:12,338 --> 00:20:15,398
What are you talking
about? You knew all this?

149
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,837
The time travel.

150
00:20:18,713 --> 00:20:21,313
There's something I think
you both should see.

151
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:38,755
Okay.

152
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:49,715
You want to go in there?

153
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:55,875
After 4 children disappeared?

154
00:21:07,255 --> 00:21:10,705
You stay by me. I'll make
sure we're safe. Okay?

155
00:21:27,463 --> 00:21:31,713
WINDEN MUNICIPAL LIBRARY

156
00:21:43,838 --> 00:21:45,698
Excuse me.

157
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,930
I'd like to learn about...

158
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,190
the town's history.

159
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,050
Where can I find articles and
documents of the last 30 years or so?

160
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,010
That's all digital now.

161
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,355
And where's that?

162
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:03,553
Excuse me.

163
00:23:04,672 --> 00:23:06,332
Where is the keyboard?

164
00:23:07,547 --> 00:23:09,027
There isn't one.

165
00:23:19,588 --> 00:23:20,768
Search

166

<i>Claudia Tiedemann first woman

Did you inform her
about the appointment?

169
00:23:56,213 --> 00:23:57,423
Yes.

170
00:23:58,414 --> 00:23:59,914
APPOINTMENTS

171
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,619
What do you know about Hannah Kahnwald?

172
00:24:08,172 --> 00:24:10,622
Her husband committed suicide.

173
00:24:11,338 --> 00:24:12,958
Hanged himself.

174
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,800
No one here understood
why she married him.

175
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,510
She was so pretty. She could've
had any man she wanted.

176
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:24,268
There were rumours she had
an affair with Ulrich Nielsen.

177
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,507
Did Mrs. Nielsen know about that?

178
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,570
Can I ask you something?

179
00:24:45,838 --> 00:24:47,208
Ask away.

180
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:51,685
How'd you get this position?

181
00:24:52,838 --> 00:24:54,478
Special task force.

182
00:24:54,797 --> 00:24:57,117
Did you volunteer for this?

183
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,080
Oh, yes.

184
00:25:04,797 --> 00:25:05,997
I did.

185
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,800
Is this man a child murderer?

186
00:25:37,338 --> 00:25:39,978
She told me and Tronte
what we have to do.

187
00:25:42,838 --> 00:25:44,518
Claudia Tiedemann.

188
00:25:45,005 --> 00:25:48,675
She knew exactly at what time
things would happen.

189
00:25:49,255 --> 00:25:51,284
It didn't make any sense,

190
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:53,959
yet it was the only way
anything made sense.

191
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:56,613
You knew about all this?

192
00:25:59,047 --> 00:26:02,007
Michael, Mikkel, Ulrich?

193
00:26:04,047 --> 00:26:05,447
About everything?

194
00:26:12,797 --> 00:26:16,257
This here... she gave us this book.

195
00:26:17,005 --> 00:26:21,225
It's all in there, about all the
children. Who disappeared when.

196
00:26:22,088 --> 00:26:23,858
Things about time travel.

197
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,620
Symbols and tables we
can't quite understand.

198
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:33,663
- The last few pages were ripped out.
- Does Katharina know this?

199
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,360
Well, you have to tell her.

200
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:49,205
Okay.

201
00:26:52,547 --> 00:26:54,207
But let me do it.

202
00:26:59,797 --> 00:27:01,637
<i>Regina and Alexander Tiedemann to wed</i>

203
00:27:04,505 --> 00:27:07,585
<i>We're getting married
Regina Tiedemann - Alexander Tiedemann</i>

204
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:14,755
<i>Waldhotel Winden Opens</i>

205
00:27:16,922 --> 00:27:20,052
<i>Waldhotel Winden Closes</i>

206
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:35,130
<i>No trace of Mads Nielsen!
Chief Inspector Egon Tiedemann...</i>

207
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:41,418
<i>Former Winden Chief Inspector
found dead in his apartment</i>

208
00:27:41,505 --> 00:27:44,585
<i>on 26 June 1987</i>

209
00:27:57,297 --> 00:27:58,857
Excuse me.

210
00:27:59,422 --> 00:28:01,642
Can I print off these things?

211
00:28:47,213 --> 00:28:49,623
Sometimes I dream about him.

212
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,650
Jonas.

213
00:28:57,297 --> 00:28:59,057
It all feels so real.

214
00:29:00,755 --> 00:29:02,705
As if he was still alive.

215
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,960
How could it feel that
way if he's really dead?

216
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:13,437
It's possible he knew something,
before he disappeared.

217
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:16,428
What are you saying?

218
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,040
What if he saw something
that he shouldn't have seen?

219
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:24,713
The door has to be in this direction.

220
00:29:54,213 --> 00:29:56,653
Where are we going, Charlotte?

221
00:30:01,213 --> 00:30:03,293
Tell me where we're going.

222
00:30:05,155 --> 00:30:07,415
Damn it, Charlotte!
Where are you taking me?

223
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:11,005
It's easier to understand
if you just see it.

224
00:30:15,297 --> 00:30:17,177
What have you found?

225
00:30:22,463 --> 00:30:24,173
You found them.

226
00:30:28,463 --> 00:30:30,463
We found them.

227
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:31,797
Both.

228
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,900
And they're not dead.
They're still alive.

229
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,635
But they're not here.

230
00:30:45,255 --> 00:30:47,145
They're not here?

231
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,650
But they're alive...
what does that mean?

232
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:54,352
It's better if you see
it with your own eyes.

233
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:22,937
Why is she here?

234
00:31:23,963 --> 00:31:26,223
What's all this about, Charlotte?

235
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:29,918
You said you thought Mikkel went
into the cave. You were right.

236
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:33,415
Mikkel was in the cave and Ulrich
was looking for him in there.

237
00:31:38,338 --> 00:31:40,958
But they found something
in the tunnels.

238
00:31:41,922 --> 00:31:45,382
A kind of tear...
in the fabric of time.

239
00:31:56,005 --> 00:31:57,805
You can't be serious.

240
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,672
What is all this shit?

241
00:32:07,255 --> 00:32:09,705
- Where are Mikkel and Ulrich?
- It's true.

242
00:32:09,797 --> 00:32:13,507
Stay out of this! Nobody
asked for your opinion.

243
00:32:16,755 --> 00:32:18,255
Charlotte is right.

244
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:22,762
Uh-huh. Another one?

245
00:32:25,505 --> 00:32:28,165
And who are you? Her new boy toy?

246
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,620
I'm Jonas.

247
00:32:33,922 --> 00:32:35,382
Her son.

248
00:32:39,213 --> 00:32:40,813
And your grandson.

249
00:33:43,005 --> 00:33:44,725
She says it's shaking.

250
00:33:51,922 --> 00:33:54,362
- What is it?
- We're not alone.

251
00:33:54,963 --> 00:33:56,093
Go. Go, go!

252
00:33:56,172 --> 00:33:58,052
Turn off the lights.

253
00:34:18,922 --> 00:34:20,572
Bartosz?

254
00:34:28,005 --> 00:34:30,065
What are you doing here?

255
00:34:31,255 --> 00:34:33,455
What the fuck?

256
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,008
Why are you here?

257
00:34:42,572 --> 00:34:44,850
My husband is trapped in the '50s,

258
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,966
and my son in the '80s.

259
00:34:47,805 --> 00:34:50,179
You chose to leave him there
because Mikkel is your father.

260
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:51,749
Is that right?

261
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:54,208
Yes.

262
00:35:01,738 --> 00:35:03,377
I can't take this seriously.

263
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:05,982
You're buying into all this bullshit?

264
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,838
What's in it for you? Huh?

265
00:35:12,547 --> 00:35:16,807
Do you want money? Can you
speak with the dead? Yeah?

266
00:35:19,005 --> 00:35:20,375
Katharina.

267
00:35:23,547 --> 00:35:24,957
I was there.

268
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,550
I saw him there.

269
00:35:29,088 --> 00:35:30,208
Mikkel.

270
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,440
You've all lost your minds.

271
00:37:23,588 --> 00:37:24,798
No.

272
00:38:02,422 --> 00:38:04,672
Fuck you, Magnus!

273
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:08,915
I swear to God, if you
have anything to do with this shit...

274
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:10,455
Fuck you.

275
00:38:10,547 --> 00:38:14,007
- Stop it.
- Tell us what the fuck you're doing here.

276
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:22,958
Come here.

277
00:38:33,463 --> 00:38:35,263
What is this thing?

278
00:38:38,047 --> 00:38:41,457
- What is that?
- Don't touch it. It doesn't concern you.

279
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:48,115
If you have anything
to do with Mikkel or my dad...

280
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,650
I'm going to kill you.

281
00:38:55,172 --> 00:38:57,332
What should we do now?

282
00:38:58,338 --> 00:38:59,968
We're taking it.

283
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,877
And him?

284
00:39:04,213 --> 00:39:05,903
We leave him here.

285
00:39:06,297 --> 00:39:08,457
Maybe that'll change his mind.

286
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,550
Fuck.

287
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,190
You can't do this.

288
00:39:16,047 --> 00:39:18,547
Martha! You can't do this!

289
00:39:20,963 --> 00:39:22,593
Hey. Shit. Hey!

290
00:39:23,713 --> 00:39:25,763
Magnus! Stop!

291
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:27,168
Magnus!

292
00:39:28,255 --> 00:39:30,145
Magnus!

293
00:39:36,755 --> 00:39:39,165
What's your take on all of this?

294
00:39:39,255 --> 00:39:41,665
We have a man-eating cave.

295
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:45,935
A nuclear plant run by a man
obviously hiding something.

296
00:39:46,505 --> 00:39:49,205
An inspector who seems
to be hiding herself.

297
00:39:49,297 --> 00:39:54,057
And we have a town full of people
who cheat and betray each other.

298
00:39:55,463 --> 00:39:59,883
And they're obviously very invested
in hiding what's happening here.

299
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:03,298
So, Mr. Wöller...

300
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,120
what do you make of all this?

301
00:40:11,005 --> 00:40:12,835
I'm not sure.

302
00:40:19,422 --> 00:40:21,932
Tell me, what happened to your eye?

303
00:40:30,422 --> 00:40:31,632
Okay.

304
00:40:33,963 --> 00:40:35,133
But...

305
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:37,908
you can't tell anyone else.

306
00:40:42,047 --> 00:40:43,507
Uh, so...

307
00:40:44,505 --> 00:40:46,585
- last summer...
- Watch it!

308
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:07,342
Interesting.

309
00:41:24,922 --> 00:41:26,922
TEACHER'S LOUNGE
PLEASE LOCK

310
00:41:34,297 --> 00:41:35,667
Okay.

311
00:41:39,588 --> 00:41:41,128
86.

312
00:41:51,963 --> 00:41:53,173
6b.

313
00:41:54,005 --> 00:41:55,755
6b, 6b, 6b.

314
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,800
6b, 6b.

315
00:42:00,005 --> 00:42:01,625
CLASS REGISTER

316
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,300
It's not open yet.

317
00:42:56,588 --> 00:43:00,048
It'll be another 32 years
before it opens.

318
00:43:01,505 --> 00:43:03,395
So you know about this?

319
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,010
They're waiting for you.

320
00:43:17,797 --> 00:43:19,707
Who's waiting for me?

321
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,477
Sic Mundus.

322
00:43:23,172 --> 00:43:25,512
You want to get home, don't you?

323
00:43:25,588 --> 00:43:27,758
That's what they say, anyway.

324
00:43:27,963 --> 00:43:29,553
Who are "they"?

325
00:43:33,213 --> 00:43:34,803
The travellers.

326
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,047
What now?

327
00:43:58,338 --> 00:43:59,948
It doesn't matter.

328
00:44:01,255 --> 00:44:04,695
Everything is going to happen
the way it always has.

329
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,890
Then why are you here?

330
00:44:12,047 --> 00:44:15,337
- He said there'd be a loophole.
- Who?

331
00:44:15,797 --> 00:44:17,957
- Adam.
- Who's Adam?

332
00:44:19,422 --> 00:44:21,382
The leader of Sic Mundus.

333
00:44:21,463 --> 00:44:25,093
The people in the photo?
The travellers?

334
00:44:25,172 --> 00:44:26,172
Yeah.

335
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:31,628
He wants the last cycle
to begin. In 3 days.

336
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,228
I have to stop it.

337
00:44:40,255 --> 00:44:42,045
That's why I'm here.

338
00:44:47,255 --> 00:44:48,875
She tried to do it.

339
00:44:53,505 --> 00:44:57,245
But in the end, she became
exactly what she was fighting.

340
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,910
Why did you bring me here?

341
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:48,902
You're one of them.

342
00:46:50,255 --> 00:46:51,755
A traveller.

343
00:46:52,797 --> 00:46:54,057
Not yet.

344
00:46:54,797 --> 00:46:57,127
But soon I will be.

345
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:24,020
It must feel strange
to see me here as well.

346
00:47:25,797 --> 00:47:28,397
Especially after our last encounter.

347
00:47:31,797 --> 00:47:34,627
But you've already
made my acquaintance.

348
00:47:46,297 --> 00:47:48,587
You'll get answers in time.

349
00:51:53,088 --> 00:51:56,168
What are you doing here?

350
00:51:57,338 --> 00:51:58,958
What's in there?

351
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:03,128
You knew it was in there!

352
00:52:05,338 --> 00:52:06,558
You...

353
00:52:07,297 --> 00:52:09,517
have lied to us the whole time.

354
00:52:09,922 --> 00:52:11,342
What is that?

355
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,633
What is that?

356
00:52:17,338 --> 00:52:22,708
They say it is a part of God.

357
00:52:25,338 --> 00:52:30,168
But in reality it's a part of the devil.

358
00:52:42,213 --> 00:52:43,923
The prophecy.

359
00:52:45,713 --> 00:52:47,313
How did it arise?

360
00:53:03,463 --> 00:53:05,463
The book, who wrote it?

361
00:53:17,297 --> 00:53:19,837
Whoever it was who wrote it...

362
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:25,247
had already seen the past and future.

363
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:38,912
What will happen to him next?

364
00:53:43,922 --> 00:53:48,012
Adam will send him on his way,
the path that's been determined.

365
00:53:49,797 --> 00:53:52,367
So that the last cycle may begin.

366
00:54:44,797 --> 00:54:47,797
You must have a lot of questions.

367
00:55:12,088 --> 00:55:15,668
Travelling leaves its marks on all of us.

368
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:21,207
The human body isn't
equipped for it in perpetuity.

369
00:55:28,463 --> 00:55:30,063
What is this here?

370
00:55:35,922 --> 00:55:37,592
Shall we begin?

371
00:55:38,797 --> 00:55:41,057
I'm not here to begin anything.

372
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:44,085
I want this to end, finally. All of it!

373
00:55:44,422 --> 00:55:47,012
Don't worry, it will come to an end.

374
00:55:47,088 --> 00:55:48,838
That can't be avoided.

375
00:55:49,922 --> 00:55:51,362
Your end,

376
00:55:52,047 --> 00:55:53,437
my end.

377
00:55:55,547 --> 00:55:58,627
On closer inspection,
it's everyone's end.

378
00:56:09,338 --> 00:56:11,018
Who are you?

379
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,410
Can't you see it already?

380
00:56:43,338 --> 00:56:44,958
This isn't real.

381
00:56:46,588 --> 00:56:48,158
I am you.

382
00:56:52,547 --> 00:56:55,757
Every stone is back where it belongs,

383
00:56:56,255 --> 00:56:58,855
everyone at their destination.

384
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:06,308
All that's needed now is a push.
