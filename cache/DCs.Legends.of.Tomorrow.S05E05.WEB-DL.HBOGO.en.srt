1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
<i>Previously,
on</i> Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,480
Mick frigging Rory. Ali, remember?

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,040
<i>She wasn't just some girl, was she?</i>

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,160
Remember when we dented history?
Your sister is the dent.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,360
Maybe her being here,
she'll remember who she was.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,880
How did you jailbreak
your way out of here?

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,720
<i>I was poking around your screens</i>

8
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,400
<i>and suddenly,
I knew how to hack my way out.</i>

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,920
Astra and this whole
bloody mess is on me.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,480
She could continue
releasing souls indefinitely.

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,560
What happened here, John?

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,320
That witch is Astra's dead mother.

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,400
She's through there.

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,800
Her spirit is waiting on
the other side of that door, and...

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,200
none too happy with me.

16
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,440
John?

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,600
Blimey,
he's really cocked it up this time.

18
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,120
How could you let him go in there?

19
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,160
That thing is hurting him.

20
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,680
Then he probably deserves it.

21
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,800
I can't just stand here.

22
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,360
Being an apprentice means
never having to say,

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,320
"Sorry, I let you get killed
by a poltergeist."

24
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,160
Get your filthy paws off of me!

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,880
No. No, no, no, no, no.

26
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,080
Move out of the way.

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,480
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,560
Yes.

29
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
Maybe.

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,680
Oh, my God.

31
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,880
John?

32
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,880
Oh, Gary.

33
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,760
What have you done?

34
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,520
Sorry. Old assassin habits die hard.

35
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,600
{\an5}Babe. Now that you've given me
a heart attack...

36
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,120
{\an5}I was just about to jump in.
Care to join me?

37
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,160
{\an5}Whoa, co-showering
in the communal bathroom.

38
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,800
You are getting comfy.

39
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,200
{\an5}Which is a good thing because
I'm gonna need you to woman the ship.

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,720
I've got business in Star City.

41
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,240
Is everything okay?

42
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,960
{\an5}Yeah, it's just some stuff
I need to take care of.

43
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,080
But it might take a few days

44
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,360
{\an5}which is why, I need
an interim captain.

45
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,880
Captain?

46
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,240
No, no, no, no, no.
I was just starting to find

47
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,640
my footing as a Legend.

48
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,120
Nobody likes the boss, babe.

49
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,520
Well, they like me.

50
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,480
{\an5}Yeah, because
you're cool Captain Lance.

51
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,920
{\an5}I'm just a button-pusher
in a boring pantsuit.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,720
{\an5}No, babe, just have fun with it.
They are going to love you.

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,400
- No. No, no, no.
- Yes.

54
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,280
I miss you already, Captain Pantsuit.

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,120
No, babe. I'm not...

56
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
Raise you two.

57
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
Make it ten.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,600
Finally. A real hand.

59
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,080
- She folds.
- Like hell I do.

60
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,120
Like Hell you do.

61
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,600
What the hell are you doing?

62
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,080
Keeping us in the black.

63
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,560
You lost another account.

64
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,480
First Rasputin, then Bugsy...

65
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,040
{\an5}- John Constantine...
- Now, Meyers.

66
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,880
{\an5}Your little resurrection venture
is getting too risky.

67
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,920
{\an5}You turn the tide,
or you'll lose everything.

68
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,960
I've played nice long enough.

69
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,760
Now, it's time to play naughty.

70
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,320
That's one angry ghost.

71
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,440
Yeah, but now,
she's loose in the bloody house.

72
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,760
- What, that was Astra's mum?
- And her name is Natalie.

73
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
What did you do to her, John boy?

74
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,360
That was a long time ago.

75
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,920
She was walking home
late from work...

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,960
and some drunken idiot

77
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,360
blew a red light and...

78
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,400
{\an5}Her husband Alex begged me
to bring her back.

79
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,160
{\an5}- You never told me that.
- Yeah, well, I never told anyone.

80
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,480
Now, let's just say that

81
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,440
that night in Newcastle
when we lost Astra...

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,640
it was a little more complicated
than an exorcism.

83
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,640
{\an5}Something tells me
that you're not telling the truth.

84
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,400
{\an5}Look, I'm trying to fix it,
Nat, all right?

85
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,680
I'm trying to save Astra!
Now, help me!

86
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,520
Doesn't seem to be
the answer she was looking for.

87
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,120
The demon that I summoned
brought Natalie back.

88
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,400
But if you brought her back,
why... why is she a ghost?

89
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,000
Because I botched it, all right?

90
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,960
I thought I had him under control,
but I didn't.

91
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,960
- You can't have her!
- John, get me out of here!

92
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,160
He took Astra.

93
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,240
Natalie couldn't live with herself

94
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,800
{\an5}knowing that the price of her life
was her daughter's.

95
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,200
She killed herself in this room.

96
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,400
That's so sad!

97
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,360
Doesn't look like Natalie's done
with you yet, John-o.

98
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,600
No, it looks like Natalie wants to
take me on a trip down memory lane.

99
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,240
{\an5}All righty-tighty, then.

100
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,880
{\an5}You ready for the official
Waverider tour?

101
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,280
What would you like to see first?

102
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,440
{\an5}What do you people do
around here for fun?

103
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,120
If you could just follow me this way.

104
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,040
First stop, the galley.

105
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,680
Gideon can whip up any
kind of food you can imagine.

106
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,640
Last week, Nate and I
made cheddar biscuits

107
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,040
and had her fabricate
some squeezable butter.

108
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,360
That tasty treat has been
off the shelf since 2024.

109
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,720
She can make anything,

110
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,920
{\an5}and you went
with a discontinued condiment.

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,960
- Wait. Can she make clothes?
- Of course.

112
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,840
Okay, tell the computer I need a
dress for my perfume launch tonight.

113
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,360
We'll be back in time
for that, right?

114
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,600
Yes. And yes, Gideon can do
anything.

115
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,480
She flies the ship, makes our food,

116
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,600
cleans the toilets,
tracks the timeline.

117
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,920
Tracks the time...

118
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,160
Do you mean, "Tells the future"?

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,480
Behrad, we can make billions
off future fall trend reports.

120
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,720
No, no. Rule number one
of time travel,

121
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,560
never look into the future
for personal gain.

122
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,640
Totally, totally.

123
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,800
And rule number two,
no social media on the ship.

124
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,160
I thought we were dropping you off.

125
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,840
My brother, the actual superhero...

126
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,960
invited me to stay.

127
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,880
Okay. Let's just remember
this is a place of business.

128
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,280
Okay? We get called on a mission,
you need to keep out of our way.

129
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
Aye-aye.

130
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,760
Okay. We'll talk later.

131
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,800
Sad. What a waste
of a good head of hair.

132
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,200
Here you go. Hide it.

133
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,200
Can your computer lady
make me some cucumber water?

134
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,480
I'm parched
from that dry interaction.

135
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,040
<i>She and her mom had been living
out of their car for almost a year</i>

136
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,440
<i>and now, her mom
has a final round job interview.</i>

137
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,920
You are incredible.

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,360
<i>I miss you.</i>

139
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,480
<i>But it feels pretty good
to be out here helping people.</i>

140
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,560
Out.

141
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,000
<i>It's okay, I have to go anyway.</i>

142
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,080
Okay, well, I'll call you later.
I love you.

143
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,040
I'm sorry,
I just kind of blurted that out.

144
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,120
<i>No, it's okay. It's okay.
Oh, you don't have to be sorry.</i>

145
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
<i>I love you, too.</i>

146
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,160
- You do?
- I said get out.

147
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,680
<i>Okay, I'll call you later. Bye.</i>

148
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,480
Mick, are you feeling all right?

149
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,280
My stomach hurts. I can't eat.

150
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,800
I... I can't drink.

151
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,360
I think Ali gave me an STD
back at the reunion.

152
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,640
<i>Initiating scan.</i>

153
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,040
Those are not symptoms.
Those are feelings.

154
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,120
Mick, I think you're developing
a crush.

155
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,760
Is that when you whizz and it hurts?

156
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,920
No. It's biology's way
of telling you,

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,600
you care about someone else.

158
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,000
<i>Dr. Palmer is correct.</i>

159
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,440
<i>The results of my body scan indicate
that you do, in fact, like-like her.</i>

160
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,600
Interim Captain Sharpe here.

161
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,000
<i>Team meeting in the parlor.
Over and out.</i>

162
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,600
<i>Okay. That was good.</i>

163
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,800
<i>That was fun, yet to the point.
Not too...</i>

164
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,800
Gideon, are you broadcasting this?

165
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,120
<i>Sorry, Ms. Sharpe. I'll shut it down.</i>

166
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,720
Okay, thank you.
We women have to stick together.

167
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,360
I always thought of you
as one of the guys.

168
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,480
Okay, I don't know what that means...

169
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,320
- He means that as a compliment.
- Yeah.

170
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,920
Okay, that's for you. That's for you.

171
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,840
Okay, then.

172
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,760
Okay.

173
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,400
What did I say about phones?

174
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,600
What? I need to tell my boyfriend
I'm not dead.

175
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,920
Oh, boyfriend?

176
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,480
Yep. Internationally renowned
DJ S'More Money.

177
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,960
Oh, okay, we've got Ray.
Oh, where's Mick?

178
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,640
He's sick. Lovesick.

179
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
Oh, lei.

180
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,280
So, while Sara's in Star City,

181
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,400
I wanted to introduce you all

182
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,640
to something that I developed
at the Time Bureau.

183
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,200
I know what you're all thinking.

184
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,360
"Time Bureau, hashtag stuffy.
What can we learn from those guys?"

185
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,920
But we really did have
a lot of fun over there.

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,320
Do you remember Taco Mondays, Nate?

187
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,280
Yeah, those were some
wild taco times.

188
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
- Yeah.
- "Aloha"?

189
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Yes!

190
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,120
A.L.O.H.A. It stands for assess,
listen, observe, hydrate...

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,360
- Attack!
- What the...

192
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
- Cool.
- See?

193
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,720
Oh, how many pages is this?

194
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,280
Ava, have you heard the proverb,

195
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,560
"The fox knows many things,
the hedgehog knows one big thing."

196
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
I have not.

197
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,880
Well, Legends,
we're a fox-kind of organization.

198
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,640
Adaptable, off the cuff.

199
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,560
This is very hedgehog.

200
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,280
Trying to impose one way of doing
things onto every situation.

201
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,480
And not to be rude,
is there a mission here?

202
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
No, I just...

203
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,600
Okay, then, I'm gonna introduce Zari

204
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,360
to the wonders
of Gideon's Austrian toast.

205
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,040
Actually, it's French toast.

206
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,680
Pretty sure it's Austrian.

207
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,920
Nah...

208
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,160
Gideon, Gideon, check the timeline.

209
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,800
<i>It would appear
that there is a disturbance</i>

210
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,440
<i>at the Bastille in Paris, 1793.</i>

211
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,600
<i>While the details are still hazy,
the aftermath is traumatic.</i>

212
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,520
<i>Thousands die
and the French Revolution collapses.</i>

213
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,880
Well, looks like we have a mission.

214
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,400
So, everybody,
stop looking so <i>Les Misérables,</i>

215
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,680
because we are going to France!

216
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,880
Behrad, come on, we need to move.

217
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
Hey, guys.

218
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,880
I couldn't stop her.
She found the fabrication room.

219
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,720
Great. She's not coming.

220
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,280
We don't do ride-alongs
in the field, B.

221
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,160
Ava, I can handle myself
in the field.

222
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,280
I once played capture the flag

223
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,360
to raise awareness
about feline OCD, so...

224
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,840
This isn't a PR event, all right?

225
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,840
We're walking into a deadly
situation, facing an Encore

226
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
with unknown powers.

227
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,400
I do not have time to keep
my eye on a party girl.

228
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,440
- I do.
- What?

229
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,360
I mean, come on, Ava.
What's the harm?

230
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,960
It's against protocol
to bring civilians into the field.

231
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
Don't...

232
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,360
Yeah, but it would be super-cool
if you just let me come anyway.

233
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,600
- Okay, fine.
- Yay!

234
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,480
Just make sure
you stay out of our way.

235
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,600
Yay!

236
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,000
What the hell was that?

237
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,920
My signature perfume, Dragonesque.

238
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,840
I needed to do something to help
that extremely sad outfit.

239
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,200
Spray, delay, walk away.

240
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,280
Yeah, we're going this way. Jesus.

241
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,800
I was just doing a runway turn.

242
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,680
This period in France
was called the Reign of Terror.

243
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,600
Executions were a national pastime.

244
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,320
Oh, yikes.

245
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,120
Yeah, we could definitely
be walking into a bloodbath.

246
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,400
And you want us to go in there?

247
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,600
Yeah, that's our job.

248
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,360
Excuse me, sir.
Oh, we need to get in there.

249
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
No.

250
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,320
It is of vital importance
that we get in there, sir.

251
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,160
Please?

252
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,320
Stand back.

253
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,280
This isn't a club, Zari,
it's an execution.

254
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,080
An event is an event.

255
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,880
Scoot. Out of the way.

256
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,120
Where do you think you're going?

257
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,160
Do you know who you're talking to?

258
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,360
What's your name?

259
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,360
- Jean Paul.
<i>- Très bien.</i>

260
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,800
Now, they'll know who to fire

261
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,000
when they find out you left
Zari Tarazi standing outside.

262
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,360
<i>Un grand</i>faux pas.

263
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,040
Not them.

264
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,320
Jean Paul, my purse isn't going to
walk in by itself.

265
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,920
Didn't you say
this was an execution?

266
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,800
Maybe Gideon got it wrong.

267
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,080
Well, if they were <i>misérable,</i>
they certainly aren't anymore.

268
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,920
Stop with the thing.

269
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,200
You know, you can just say the word

270
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,520
and I'll put you in a prime spot
uptown.

271
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,320
So I can rub shoulders
with all those arrogant soul traders?

272
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,680
No, thank you.

273
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,160
I need some help with one
of the coins you constructed.

274
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,280
Help? When else do you come see me?

275
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,160
I assume this is why you're here.

276
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,160
- How did you...
- John Constantine.

277
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,160
I remember making this.

278
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,400
- What do you want for him?
- Oh, I don't want to trade him.

279
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,360
I want to kill him.

280
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,120
Tourist attraction number two.

281
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,400
The night Alex begged me
to save Natalie.

282
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,080
He was supposed to pick her up
that night she got hit

283
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,080
but, they had a big fight,
so, she walked.

284
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,320
Alex was beside himself,
he was torn up.

285
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,360
Astra, she hadn't said a word
since the accident.

286
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,120
How was I supposed to say no?

287
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,440
Alex begged me,
but I knew I should have said no.

288
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,320
Bollocks, John!
Come on, try again!

289
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,360
Well, Alex wanted it,

290
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,000
and I just provided the how,
all right?

291
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,320
What's the difference, Nat?

292
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,200
- So, the resurrection was your idea.
- Yes, all right?

293
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,320
Nat and I, we were best friends.
How could I not try and save her?

294
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,120
See? The truth can set you free.

295
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,880
Is that Mucous Membrane?

296
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,520
This place doesn't seem too evil.

297
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,720
Yeah, well, appearances
can be deceiving.

298
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,080
Okay, we need to figure out
who this Encore

299
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,800
is and what powers they may have.

300
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,000
We start with
the A.L.O.H.A. method, okay?

301
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,440
Assessment, lay low, don't engage.

302
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,840
We know how to party-sneak.

303
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,800
Listen to me. You see something,
you say something.

304
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,000
- Captain. You're trying too hard.
- Yeah.

305
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,080
It's really desperate.

306
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,320
So, this is your job.
Walking around parties.

307
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,760
- Isn't this kind of what you do?
- Touché.

308
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,840
No.

309
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,680
But something definitely feels off.

310
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,520
At this point
in the French Revolution,

311
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,200
most of the royals
had been separated from their heads.

312
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:05,200
Even wearing a nice dress
could get you sent to the guillotine.

313
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,800
Oh, and you let me
come out in this because?

314
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,680
I'm a sucker for a corset
and an up do.

315
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,120
Napoleon?

316
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,800
He should be marching on
southern France, not getting freaky.

317
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,400
Guys, steer clear.
Exercise extreme caution.

318
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,800
- Relax, Ava.
<i>- I'm trying.</i>

319
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,120
Nora?

320
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,120
Ava? I think we found our Encore.

321
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,440
<i>She's in the VIP area.</i>

322
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,320
- Nora's our Encore?
- No, Ray.

323
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,560
That's Marie Antoinette.

324
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,240
And she should definitely be
without her head by now.

325
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,160
<i>Great. On to phase two of A.L.O.H.A.,
it's listening.</i>

326
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,880
<i>Now, her powers could be anything.
Teleportation, pyrokinesis.</i>

327
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,240
Fatal attractiveness.

328
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,680
- I mean... Right?
- Right?

329
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,320
Guys? Guys?

330
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,600
They're not usually like this.

331
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,040
- Well, you're not usually captain.
- Thank you.

332
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,800
I just swapped crêpe recipes
with a French cooking legend.

333
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,400
This is the best party ever.

334
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,080
Excuse me, since when do you drink?

335
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,320
Where did I even get that?

336
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,000
You know what? You're right,
something is definitely wrong.

337
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,680
Move out of the way.

338
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,360
It is time!

339
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,200
Of course.

340
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,320
The perfect revenge.
A magical guillotine.

341
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,480
Guys, be careful.

342
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,880
I think Marie's about to make
her move.

343
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,920
Now!

344
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,440
Let them eat cake!

345
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,800
- Pardon me.
- Pardon me.

346
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,720
So, it's not a guillotine.

347
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,320
What day is it?

348
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,000
Oh, how long have you been here?

349
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,160
Oh, my God, he's dead.

350
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,360
Oh. He literally partied
himself to death.

351
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,120
- So tacky.
- Look. No, he's not the only one.

352
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
What is happening?

353
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,920
That's why I don't eat carbs.

354
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,600
This woman is next-level popular.

355
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,440
People would rather die than leave.

356
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,440
- Talk about FOMO.
- God, that's it.

357
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,040
Marie Antoinette was beheaded
for partying while France starved.

358
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,960
And now, she is literally
killing the Revolution

359
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,280
with a non-stop party.

360
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,640
Legends, we figured it out.
Charm is her superpower.

361
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,160
Hello? Ray? Nate? Behrad?

362
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,640
It's like she's gotten to everyone
except for us.

363
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,200
So, we have to stop this.

364
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,160
- Wait. I'm on the team?
- Sure.

365
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,160
Okay, what's the plan?

366
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,280
We have to find a way
to get Marie Antoinette out of here

367
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,560
without a riot.

368
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,160
The only way to get a celebrity
to leave her own party quietly,

369
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,480
is to make her think
there's a cooler party somewhere else

370
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,920
that she's not at.

371
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,880
- Let's go tell her.
- Oh, girl.

372
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,520
You're not going to get anywhere
in this ensemble.

373
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,800
What are you doing? Stop it.

374
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,880
Hey.

375
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,840
Trust me.

376
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,120
Come on.

377
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,960
That's her. Natalie.

378
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,600
- She's good.
- Yeah.

379
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,880
You loved her.

380
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,280
It's quite the track record,
isn't it?

381
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,000
One lover sent to Hell,
the other one a ghost.

382
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,400
Please, John, it's eating you up.
You have to stop.

383
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,760
Look, Natalie, you're gonna have
to trust me on this one, all right?

384
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,400
I've got it under control.

385
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,320
If Lester hadn't been there,
I would have lost you tonight.

386
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,960
Look, let's just leave all
this behind.

387
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,600
We'll go to New York.
We'll start clean.

388
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,000
You have to choose. Magic or me.

389
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,200
Screw you, John Constantine!

390
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,600
All right, that's enough, all right?

391
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,640
I don't want you in my head
or in my memories!

392
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,840
No more games!

393
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,080
Look, we're trapped in this house
with a knife-wielding ghost

394
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,000
and you're still refusing to own up
to your past.

395
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,880
You are a fine one to talk,
aren't you?

396
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,280
Why don't we poke around
in your closet for a while, eh?

397
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,120
- Why did you leave, Charlie?
- Oh, guys?

398
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,680
- I'm no hero. It was time to go.
- Guys. Guys. Guys!

399
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,840
Yeah? What, you just wandered
into my house looking for a party?

400
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,440
What are you really doing here, eh?

401
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,320
Don't even try and turn this
on me, all right?

402
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,960
It's your lies
that have trapped us here.

403
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,000
She's right, John.

404
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,000
Natalie, is that really you?

405
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,840
Every level of the party
has its guardians.

406
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,560
Getting past the bouncer, easy.
Getting past the friends...

407
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,640
you need to know someone.

408
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,760
But we don't know anybody.

409
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,240
I know...

410
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,360
that guy.

411
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,560
You know Napoleon?

412
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,080
No, but they don't know that.

413
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,440
<i>Bonjour,</i>Napoleon.

414
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,880
We're with him.

415
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,320
Oh, she's separated from the pack.
Now's the time.

416
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,560
Oh, good. Work your magic.

417
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,600
Oh, teaching moment.

418
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,440
The big secret to being cool?
Confidence.

419
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,360
It makes people think
you have something they don't.

420
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,440
You got this, Captain.

421
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,680
- No, but I don't...
- There you go.

422
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,640
Thank you.

423
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,640
I do not know you.

424
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,080
What are you doing here?

425
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,800
- Leaving.
- Leaving?

426
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,240
Actually,
I am going to the after-party.

427
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,880
What is this <i>après</i> party?

428
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,280
It's a party after the party.
It's the best place to be.

429
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,640
- Where is it?
- I can't tell you.

430
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,480
- But I can take you.
- Really? Take me.

431
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,960
Oh, oh.

432
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,160
This is my bestie, Zari.
She's coming with.

433
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,720
Yes, queen.

434
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
Guys, I have Marie

435
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,600
and we're taking her
to the <i>Waverider.</i>

436
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,040
That's a great idea.
We'll have her all to ourselves.

437
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,080
Marie, come back!

438
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,360
There is an <i>apres</i> party!

439
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,200
Guys, you have company.

440
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,440
The after-party is right this way.

441
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,800
Corsets are so impractical!

442
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,520
Marie, where's the party?

443
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,200
I do not think this is a good idea.

444
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,360
We're gonna party our faces off.
It's gonna be great.

445
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,320
Should've seen that coming.

446
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,640
Return me to my body this instant...

447
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,200
Okay, body, Here we go.

448
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,880
This is weird.

449
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,640
This party stinks!

450
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,400
Oh, so true, girl.

451
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,680
But not the point.

452
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,880
- She's annoying. You can just...
- Yeah.

453
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,840
Take this thing off of me!

454
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,680
Oh, I can't believe I tried to drink.

455
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,560
I can't believe I ate
all that gluten-filled cake.

456
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,080
I can't believe how heavy
that head is.

457
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,520
Yeah, she really had you
under her spell.

458
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,000
If it weren't for
our interim Legend here,

459
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,400
you guys would've partied to death.

460
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,200
Well, just to play it safe,
I'm gonna...

461
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,600
Stay away! Don't you touch me!

462
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,640
- Gonna take this into the library.
- I'll bite your finger!

463
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,200
- I'll help you.
- Don't get creepy, Ray.

464
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,600
So, my sister, the superhero.

465
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,440
Should I get Gideon to make you
a cowl?

466
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,560
Cowls are for middle-aged women
who wanna hide their necks.

467
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,560
But I do need a dress
for the party tonight.

468
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,400
- The fabricator's all yours.
- Yay! Thank you.

469
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,280
Is that really you, Nat?

470
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,000
I need to hear you say it.

471
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,680
Why did you bring me back?

472
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,440
Because I loved you, Nat.

473
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,840
I never stopped.

474
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,120
I'm not here for the John Constantine
broken hero act.

475
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,960
Say it to my face.

476
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,720
I need to hear the truth.

477
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,600
I brought you back...

478
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,000
to prove to you that I was right.

479
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,200
To show you that I was right
to choose magic over us.

480
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
Thank you.

481
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,720
I needed you to admit
to yourself what you did.

482
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,760
Because if you're going to
save Astra,

483
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,320
you need to do it for her,
not for your ego.

484
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,160
Oh, I have tried to save her, Nat.

485
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,880
I have tried, but I don't know how.

486
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,400
I think I found a way.

487
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,680
Hello? Excuse me?

488
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,920
Can you help me? Where is my body?

489
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,640
You were throwing a party
intended to kill people,

490
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,800
so, no, not gonna help you.

491
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,960
When I was 14,
I was forced to leave my family.

492
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,480
People saw the dresses,
the parties, the hair...

493
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,800
and they assumed
I was a spoiled brat.

494
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,760
Really, I was just
a lonely Viennese girl

495
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,320
trying to fit into French society.

496
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,280
I've been famous
since I was six years old.

497
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,680
I don't know if people love me
or love to hate me.

498
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,880
What they don't understand
is how hard I work

499
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,560
to create a fantasy for them.

500
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,720
The secret is
to never let the party stop.

501
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,800
If I had known then what
I know now...

502
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,040
Gidget, is there anything
I need to worry about?

503
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,000
<i>Interim Captain Sharpe</i>

504
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,240
<i>instructed you
not to look at your future.</i>

505
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,680
Just a peek, little lady computer.

506
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,320
<i>As you wish. October 7th, 2045...</i>

507

from her fans,</i>

508
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,200
<i>known as Z-Nation, after the FDA
banned her perfume Dragonesque</i>

509
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,920

510
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,160
Oh, no.

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,320

<i>Meow!</i>

517
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,160
But, I didn't know there was anything
wrong with the perfume.

518
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,600
This is so unfair.

519
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,480
Okay, I have to
get out in front of this.

520
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,680
Maybe Gidget can make me
a new perfume.

521
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,840
Or I can just take yours.

522
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,400
No, you cannot have it.

523
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,920
I mean, it's not like
you're using it.

524
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,280
You have half a neck.

525
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,960
Why do you care so much
about a bottle of...

526
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,520
Oh! You're not super-charming.

527
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,720
You used magical popularity perfume.

528
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,520
Honestly, that makes me feel
better about myself.

529
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,400
What are you doing?

530
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,840
Can't have you ratting me out.

531
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,400
Oh, there you are.
Thank God. Thank God.

532
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,120
I have been so worried,
but don't... don't worry.

533
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,440
I've... I've totally been keeping up
your Cat-Chat account.

534
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,600
Yesterday, I posted a picture
of a cat licking

535
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,080
a tube of Dragonesque lipstick.

536
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,600
Gross, Les-Lay, I would never
post that.

537
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,920
I am so sorry, I will delete it.

538
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:41,760
And here is the hero bottle
for the photoshoot.

539
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,800
Actually, change of plans.

540
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,440
- Oh, so retro.
- Take this.

541
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,360
- Hey, Z... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hi!

542
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,880
Watch the s'more.
What are you doing?

543
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,960
Sorry, babe.

544
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,200
So, have you decided where
you want to do the proposal yet?

545
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,040
- The what?
- Didn't my agent call you?

546
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,680
Yeah, I haven't had a chance
to tell you yet, Z.

547
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,200
But S'More's team came up with
the most epic idea.

548
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:09,360
He should propose to you
at next week's MTV Movie Awards

549
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,040
in advance of your DJ and Z
co-branded sunglasses launch.

550
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
Sorry. We're getting married?

551
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,960
Yo, we could do it
somewhere more chill, you know?

552
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,960
like at the DJ S'More Money
Spring Break House Party live cast,

553
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,040
something like that?

554
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,000
- How romantic.
- Yeah, it's gonna be dope.

555
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,800
- Okay, let's do this. Hey!
- You're ready for this. Let's go.

556
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,800
Okay, one spritz should be safe.
Spray, delay, walk away.

557
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,280
You have to do a 23andMe.
I mean, she must be related to you.

558
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,120
Here, doesn't she look exactly
like you?

559
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,360
<i>Ray, I am looking at a gagged,
decapitated woman.</i>

560
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,640
<i>If that's what you think I look like,
we have a lot of processing to do.</i>

561
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,160
Oh, no, but... Sorry, Ms. Antoinette.

562
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,200
Can you taste the cardamom?

563
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,520
I can't. I can't taste anything
because your sister's perfume

564
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,640
clogged up my entire
olfactory system.

565
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Everything tastes like...

566
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,000
Zari... Zari stole
Marie Antoinette's perfume.

567
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,320
You should see what Mick
stole from Mexico, it's disgusting.

568
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,440
Consider ourselves lucky.

569
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,440
At least she didn't do something
to screw up history.

570
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,560
Oh, my God, the perfume!
That's how Marie did it.

571
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,360
Zari and I weren't affected

572
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,560
'cause we couldn't smell
because of the Dragonesque.

573
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,640
Who knows what kind of damage
she could do with that?

574
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,200
It's all my fault.
I shouldn't have let her stay.

575
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,400
I knew it was too early
to pat myself on the back.

576
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,760
Look, it wouldn't be a true Legends'
mission unless something went wrong.

577
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,240
Or several things.

578
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,160
Oh, wasn't there
a body on that stretcher?

579
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,760
- Zari!
- Zari! Over here!

580
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,120
Have I told you how hot
you look in that dress?

581
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,600
No, but you can tell me now.

582
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,800
Super-hot!

583
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,160
And you smell fantastic!

584
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,080
You know what, screw our agents.
I don't wanna wait

585
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,400
till the fall launch
of our sunglasses in October

586
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,040
to begin my life with you.

587
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,680
Hey, listen up. S'More Money
has an announcement to make.

588
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,960
Zari Tarazi, will you marry me?

589
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,240
Oh, S'More...

590
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,880
I think I just got a little too
popular.

591
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,280
Oh, God.

592
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,400
Here, body, body, body, body.

593
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,920
Okay, body.
No one wants to hurt you.

594
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,040
Speak for yourself.

595
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,720
Hey, come on, Mick. She's harmless.

596
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,280
It's just a headless body.

597
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,280
Mick, a little help here.
Just target the right arm.

598
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,840
No, Mick, don't...

599
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,040
Okay, we need to protect ourselves.
Zari's deployed Marie's perfume.

600
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,280
Okay, team, A.L.O.H.A. time.

601
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,480
Run! Run!

602
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,560
Nate, what do you got?

603
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,720
I'm assessing Zari used too much
of the perfume

604
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,040
'cause this crowd is bananas.

605
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,880
<i>- Behrad?</i>
- I'm listening

606
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,640
and I hear another mob coming.

607
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,840
Okay, I'm observing and there are way
too many people for us to stop.

608
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,600
We need to get that perfume
off of her to stop this.

609
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,560
- How?
- I have an idea. I need your help.

610
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,920
Behrad, now!

611
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,680
- You guys came back for me.
- A Legend never gets left behind,

612
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,600
even an interim one. Follow me.

613
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,040
- What are you doing?
- Trust me.

614
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,800
<i>There's too many of them.
I can't stop them all.</i>

615
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,920
- Come on!
- Okay.

616
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,760
Well, we've tried
the A.L.O.H.A. method.

617
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,440
The A.L.O. haven't got us
anywhere.

618
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,960
What does the "H" stand for?

619
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,080
Hydrate!

620
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,520
- S'Mores.
- Yeah.

621
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,720
- Zari's boyfriend?
- That's me.

622
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,840
- Okay, guys.
- Oh, God.

623
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,920
Party's over.

624
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,600
Did Zari just jump into the fountain?

625
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,800
Talk about desperate stunts.

626
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,880
I'm calling my agent
to schedule a divorce!

627
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,120
Wait, what does that last
"A" stand for?

628
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,400
Attack!

629
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,480
Look at us.

630
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,040
We thought we could change the world
with our little loom.

631
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,280
This one's to bring me mum back.

632
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,880
The Loom of Fate.
It's not just a story, it's real.

633
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,960
Three old Greek birds
cutting threads...

634
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,720
hunkering down over a loom to weave
together the fate of humankind.

635
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,720
No, if it's real,
how come I haven't heard of it, eh?

636
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,040
You're asking the wrong person.

637
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,840
Why do you think I brought her here?

638
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,520
What the bloody hell was that?

639
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,480
What do you know
about the Loom of Fate?

640
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,920
- I know bugger all.
- How'd you find this place, Charlie?

641
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You told me about it.

642
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,680
Oh, bollocks,
I've never told anyone about it.

643
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,200
Natalie brought you here to help me
save Astra and stop those Encores.

644
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,200
So tell me, what do you know
about the Loom of Fate?

645
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,320
Fate's a load of crap.

646
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,600
You haven't answered
my question, Charlie.

647
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
You wanna know what I'm hiding from?

648
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,480
- Yes, I do!
- It's that bloody Loom!

649
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,960
- So, it is real.
- It was.

650
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,600
Until I destroyed it.

651
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,120
"Lady in Cheap Pantsuit Ruins Party."

652
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,920
Ava was right
about no phones on the ship.

653
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,200
I had Gideon whip you up
some new clothes.

654
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,320
Hope you like flannel.

655
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,080
I do not. Oh.

656
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,000
Listen. I know, you're gonna tell me
how selfish I was

657
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,880
for stealing the perfume
and burning the team.

658
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,320
You guys toil away in obscurity
to save humanity

659
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,280
from unknown baddies
and I just go and spray evil perfume

660
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,400
all over New York City
without a second thought.

661
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,840
I'm a jerk. I'm sorry.

662
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,240
I was gonna ask if you wanted
a donut.

663
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:17,040
I haven't had a donut in 1,743 days.

664
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,360
What is this donut?

665
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,640
Shut up, Marie.

666
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,000
- Getting healthier...
- Hey.

667
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,640
Wow. Nice shirt.

668
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,600
You would be into lumberjack chic.

669
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,800
<i>There's an incoming hologram
from Captain Lance.</i>

670
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,880
Captain.

671
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,920
- How'd the mission go?
- Oh...

672
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,160
- Well, I...
- Killed it.

673
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,280
She was a foxy hedgehog out there.

674
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,760
Okay.

675
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,960
We got our Encore, Captain.

676
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,960
Oh, good, I'm glad to hear it.

677
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,000
Ava, call me later,
so I can thank you properly.

678
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,760
Oh, captain, my captain.

679
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,880
"Call me later, so I can
properly congratulate you..."

680
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,280
- Guys, come on.
- She doesn't sound like that.

681
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,120
Zari!

682
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,320
Hey, are you okay?

683
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,520
Yeah, I was...
I was just enjoying this donut.

684
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,120
And thinking...

685
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,720
You locked Marie Antoinette up,
but you let me off the hook.

686
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,800
I mean, she killed people, Zari.

687
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,280
You screwed up.
You know, everybody screws up.

688
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,360
- Not you.
- Me?

689
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,120
I feel like I'm
screwing up all the time.

690
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,720
You were so on-mission.

691
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,520
You crashed an A-list party
in a pantsuit

692
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,240
and threw yourself into a fountain.

693
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,120
Oh, see? It's a perfect example.

694
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,240
No, it was amazing.
You didn't care what anyone thought.

695
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,800
You were just being you.

696
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,040
I've been trying to get people
to like me for so long, that...

697
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,000
I've forgotten who I really am.

698
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,800
I have millions of followers,
but zero friends.

699
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,960
You got one.

700
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,760
Really?

701
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,240
Come on.

702
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,880
Well, as your friend,
I have to tell you,

703
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,680
no more pantsuits.
You're better than that.

704
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,760
Deal.

705
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,800
He still has ten years before
the lung cancer catches up to him.

706
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,080
Can you make it zero?

707
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,520
That's a nasty way to go,
especially all at once.

708
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,200
You sure that's who you wanna be?

709
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,240
Why is it so hard for people
to let little girls grow up?

710
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,720
John may be the villain
in your story

711
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,400
but in mine, he's just
cocktail party conversation.

712
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,960
I have a few enemies of my own.

713
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,560
One day, I'm going to call you

714
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,480
and you are going to do me a favor.

715
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,120
You make "favor" sound like "sin".

716
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,320
This is Hell, sweetie.

717
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,440
Do it.

718
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,640
You broke the Loom of Fate?
How old are you?

719
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Old.

720
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,200
If you broke it,
why are you still running?

721
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,080
I scattered those damn pieces
all across the multi-verse.

722
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,040
Just put an end to it all.

723
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,680
But recently, I sensed
that something had changed.

724
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,960
It's like my past
was catching up with me. So...

725
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,520
John, are you okay?

726
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,200
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just got a...

727
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,120
Bye-bye, Johnny.
