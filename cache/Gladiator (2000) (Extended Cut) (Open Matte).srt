1
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:18,448
Sir.

2
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:19,783
General.

3
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,795
Sir.

4
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:48,478
Lean and hungry.

5
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:54,359
- Still nothing?
- Not a sign.

6
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:57,320
- How long has he been gone?
- Nearly two hours.

7
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,075
Will they fight, sir?

8
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,660
We shall know soon enough.

9
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:06,288
Soldier, I ordered you to
move those catapults forward.

10
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:08,665
- They're out of range.
- Range is good.

11
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:13,754
- The danger to the cavalry...
- Is acceptable. Agreed?

12
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:24,556
They say no.

13
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,043
People should know when
they're conquered.

14
00:05:03,513 --> 00:05:05,305
Would you, Quintus?

15
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:07,516
Would I?

16
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:26,952
- Strength and honor.
- Strength and honor.

17
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,752
At my signal, unleash hell.

18
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,985
Load the catapults.

19
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:02,821
Infantry form up for advance.

20
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:06,700
- Archers ready.
- Archers!

21
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,285
- Nock!
- Nock!

22
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,435
<i>Fratres!</i>

23
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,353
- Maximus!
- Maximus!

24
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:40,901
Three weeks from now, I will
be harvesting my crops.

25
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:45,447
Imagine where you will
be, and it will be so.

26
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:49,492
Hold the line! Stay with me!

27
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:52,245
If you find yourself alone,

28
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,332
riding in green fields
with the sun on your face,

29
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:58,710
do not be troubled.

30
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:03,173
For you are in Elysium,
and you're already dead!

31
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:07,010
Brothers,

32
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,221
what we do in life

33
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:12,933
echoes in eternity.

34
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:22,734
Pull!

35
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:40,377
Cohorts ready, sir!

36
00:07:51,097 --> 00:07:53,390
Archers, ignite!

37
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:56,267
- Ignite!
- Ignite!

38
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,818
Archers, draw!

39
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,656
Loose!

40
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:40,770
All right, men, ready!

41
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,570
Hold the line!

42
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:58,955
Loose!

43
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,498
Reload!

44
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,547
Hold the line!

45
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,966
- Draw!
- Loose!

46
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,304
Stay with me!

47
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,895
Stay with me!

48
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
<i>Roma Victor!</i>

49
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:12,041
Do you think he's really dying?

50
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,461
He's been dying for 10 years.

51
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,966
If he weren't really dying,
he wouldn't have sent for us.

52
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,843
Maybe he just misses us.

53
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,512
And the senators? He wouldn't
have summoned them if...

54
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:25,888
Peace, Commodus.

55
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,265
After two weeks on the road,

56
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,018
your incessant scheming
is hurting my head.

57
00:13:37,443 --> 00:13:40,862
He's made his decision.
He's going to announce it.

58
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,409
He will name me.

59
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:52,915
The first thing I
shall do when...

60
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:59,005
Is honor him with games
worthy of His Majesty.

61
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:03,926
For now, the first thing I
shall do is have a hot bath.

62
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,430
Your Highness?

63
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,227
We seem to
be almost there, sir.

64
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:21,611
- Sire.
- Where's the Emperor?

65
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,365
He's at the front, sire.
They've been gone for 19 days.

66
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,658
The wounded are still coming in.

67
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,369
My horse.

68
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,120
My lord.

69
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,750
Kiss?

70
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:15,206
You have proved your valor
yet again, Maximus.

71
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:20,086
Let us hope, for the last time.

72
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,755
There's no one left
to fight, sire.

73
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,508
There is always someone
left to fight.

74
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,511
How can I reward Rome's
greatest general?

75
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,518
Let me go home.

76
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:37,687
Ah!

77
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,313
Home.

78
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,667
They honor you, Caesar.

79
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,545
It's for you, Maximus.
They honor you.

80
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:28,237
Have I missed it? Have
I missed the battle?

81
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:31,699
You have missed the war.

82
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,993
Father, congratulations.

83
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,871
I shall sacrifice 100 bulls
to honor your triumph.

84
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,623
Save the bulls.

85
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:41,167
Honor Maximus. He
won the battle.

86
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:43,920
- General.
- Highness.

87
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:48,508
Rome salutes you, and I
embrace you as a brother.

88
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,384
It has been too long,
my old friend.

89
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:51,928
Highness.

90
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,597
Here, Father. Take my arm.

91
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:59,393
I think it is time
for me to leave.

92
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:17,870
So much for the glory of Rome.

93
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:48,711
Magnificent battle.

94
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,362
General. Still alive?

95
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:15,738
Still alive.

96
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,448
The gods must have
a sense of humor.

97
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:20,201
- The gods must love you.
- Valerius.

98
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:23,162
Back to barracks, General?
Or to Rome?

99
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:26,332
Home. My wife, my
son, the harvest.

100
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:30,294
Maximus the farmer. I still
have difficulty imagining that.

101
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:34,006
You know, dirt cleans off a lot
easier than blood, Quintus.

102
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,175
- Here he is.
- Highness.

103
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,427
Senator
Gaius, Senator Falco.

104
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:41,389
Beware of Gaius. He'll pour a
honeyed potion in your ear,

105
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:45,059
and you'll wake up one day and all you'll
say is, "Republic, republic, republic."

106
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,812
Well, why not? Rome was
founded as a republic.

107
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,773
Yes, and in a republic the
senate has the power.

108
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,067
But Senator Gaius isn't
influenced by that, of course.

109
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:56,153
Where do you stand, General?
Emperor or Senate?

110
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:57,488
A soldier has the advantage

111
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:00,991
of being able to look his
enemy in the eye, Senator.

112
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:05,079
Well, with an army behind you, you
could be extremely political.

113
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:08,290
I warned you. Now I shall save you.
Senators.

114
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:19,552
Maximus.

115
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,139
I'm going to need
good men like you.

116
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,810
How may I be of
service, Highness?

117
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,938
You're a man who knows
what it is to command.

118
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:34,358
You give your orders, the orders
are obeyed, and the battle is won.

119
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:39,238
But these senators scheme,
squabble and flatter and deceive.

120
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,783
Maximus, we must save Rome from
the politicians, my friend.

121
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:45,995
Can I count on you
when the time comes?

122
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,754
Highness, when your father releases
me, I intend to return home.

123
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:58,007
Home? Well, no one's
earned it more.

124
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:03,345
Don't get too comfortable.
I may call on you before long.

125
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:08,017
Lucilia's here. Did you know?

126
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:10,436
She's not forgotten you.

127
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,064
And now, you're the great man.

128
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,871
If only you had been born a man,

129
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,208
what a Caesar you
would have made.

130
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,336
Father.

131
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,344
You would have been strong.

132
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:46,680
I wonder, would you
have been just?

133
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:50,100
I would have been what
you taught me to be.

134
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:53,646
How was your journey?

135
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,483
Long. Uncomfortable.
Why have I come?

136
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:00,653
I need your help.
With your brother.

137
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,780
Of course.

138
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:04,990
He loves you. He always has.

139
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,243
And

140
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,289
he will need you
now, more than ever.

141
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,255
Enough of politics.

142
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,466
Let us pretend that you
are a loving daughter,

143
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,427
and I am a good father.

144
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:33,727
This is a pleasant
fiction, isn't it?

145
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:48,200
Good morning to you.

146
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:03,883
I need three more horses.

147
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:15,936
One! Two! Three!

148
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,938
Four!

149
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:20,274
One! Two!

150
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:38,417
You sent for me, Caesar?

151
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:46,050
- Caesar?
- Tell me again, Maximus.

152
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,844
Why are we here?

153
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,681
For the glory of
the empire, sire.

154
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:54,183
Yes.

155
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:58,187
Yes, I remember.

156
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,525
Do you see that map, Maximus?

157
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,862
That is the world
which I created.

158
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:09,365
For 25 years,

159
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:13,786
I have conquered, spilt
blood, expanded the empire.

160
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:18,958
Since I became Caesar, I've
known four years without war.

161
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,543
Four years of peace in 20.

162
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,337
And for what?

163
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,556
I brought the sword.
Nothing more.

164
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,142
Caesar, your life...

165
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:39,812
Please. Please don't
call me that.

166
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:42,356
Come. Please.

167
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,525
Come sit.

168
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,070
Let us talk together now,

169
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:51,073
very simply, as men.

170
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,575
Well, Maximus,

171
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,121
talk.

172
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:03,085
Five thousand of my men are out
there in the freezing mud.

173
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,962
Three thousand of them are
bloodied and cleaved.

174
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:06,505
Two thousand will never
leave this place.

175
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:09,800
I will not believe that they
fought and died for nothing.

176
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:11,510
And what would you believe?

177
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:15,431
They fought for
you and for Rome.

178
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,307
And what is Rome, Maximus?

179
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:21,895
I've seen much of the
rest of the world.

180
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,983
It is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.

181
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,985
Yet you have never been there.

182
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:30,529
You have not seen
what it has become.

183
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:33,657
I am dying, Maximus.

184
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:35,576
When a man sees his end,

185
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,704
he wants to know there was
some purpose to his life.

186
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:43,000
How will the world speak
my name in years to come?

187
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:45,377
Will I be known as
the philosopher?

188
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:46,962
The warrior?

189
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:48,672
The tyrant?

190
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:54,803
Or will I be the Emperor who
gave Rome back her true self?

191
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:58,223
There was once a
dream that was Rome.

192
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:01,060
You could only whisper it.

193
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:04,229
Anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish,

194
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:06,148
it was so fragile.

195
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:10,152
And I fear that it will
not survive the winter.

196
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:13,155
Maximus,

197
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:16,992
let us whisper now,

198
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:18,952
together, you and I.

199
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:21,163
You have a son.

200
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:24,541
Tell me about your home.

201
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:33,675
My house is in the
hills above Trujillo.

202
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:36,804
A very simple place.

203
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:40,140
Pink stones that
warm in the sun.

204
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:43,727
A kitchen garden that
smells of herbs in the day,

205
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:46,396
Jasmine in the evening.

206
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:50,651
Through the gate
is a giant poplar.

207
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:53,779
Figs, apples, pears.

208
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:57,449
The soil, Marcus, black.
Black like my wife's hair.

209
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:00,911
Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.

210
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,247
Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son.

211
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:04,957
He wants to be one of them.

212
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,834
When was the last
time you were home?

213
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:10,045
Two years, 264 days
and this morning.

214
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:14,967
I envy you, Maximus.
It's a good home.

215
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:18,387
Worth fighting for.

216
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:23,350
There is one more duty

217
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:26,645
that I ask of you
before you go home.

218
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:30,691
What would you have
me do, Caesar?

219
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:34,403
I want you to become the
protector of Rome after I die.

220
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:38,574
I will empower you
to one end alone,

221
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:42,578
to give power back to
the people of Rome,

222
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:45,998
and end the corruption
that has crippled it.

223
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:55,924
Will you accept this great
honor that I have offered you?

224
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,219
With all my heart, no.

225
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:03,515
Maximus,

226
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,019
that is why it must be you.

227
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:09,188
But surely a prefect, a senator,

228
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:11,982
somebody who knows the city,
who understands her politics.

229
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:15,027
But you have not been
corrupted by her politics.

230
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:23,660
- And Commodus?
- Commodus is not a moral man.

231
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:27,247
You have known that
since you were young.

232
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:29,291
Commodus cannot rule.

233
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,752
He must not rule.

234
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:36,089
You are the son that
I should have had.

235
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:41,637
Commodus will
accept my decision.

236
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:48,685
He knows that you command
the loyalty of the army.

237
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,150
I need some time, sire.

238
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:56,693
Yes.

239
00:28:56,778 --> 00:29:00,322
By sunset, I hope you
will have agreed.

240
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,575
Now embrace me as my son.

241
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:09,706
And bring an old man
another blanket.

242
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:28,433
- My father favors you now.
- My lady.

243
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:32,020
- It was not always so.
- Many things change.

244
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:35,524
Many things. Not everything.

245
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:40,070
Maximus, stop.

246
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:45,534
Let me see your face.

247
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:50,789
- You seem upset.
- I lost many men.

248
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:54,042
What did my father
want with you?

249
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:58,088
To wish me well before
I leave for home.

250
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:00,215
You're lying.

251
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,885
I could always tell when you were lying,
because you were never any good at it.

252
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,490
I never acquired your
comfort with it.

253
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:06,596
True.

254
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:08,765
But then you never had to.

255
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:11,977
Life is more simple
for a soldier.

256
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,981
Or do you think me heartless?

257
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:19,735
I think you have a
talent for survival.

258
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,284
Maximus, stop.

259
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:32,372
Is it really so terrible
seeing me again?

260
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:34,958
No. I'm tired from battle.

261
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:38,378
It hurts you to see
my father so fragile.

262
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:45,927
Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.

263
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:50,474
Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?

264
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:54,811
I will always serve Rome.

265
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:58,523
Do you know,

266
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:01,109
I still remember
you in my prayers.

267
00:31:02,153 --> 00:31:05,072
Oh, yes. I pray.

268
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:12,954
I was sad to hear of your husband's death.
I mourned him.

269
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:17,667
- Thank you.
- And I hear you have a son.

270
00:31:19,337 --> 00:31:21,755
Yes. Lucius.

271
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,342
He'll be nearly eight years old.

272
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:27,677
My son is also nearly eight.

273
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:32,641
I thank you for your prayers.

274
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,943
Ancestors, I ask
for your guidance.

275
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,823
Blessed Mother, come to me with
the gods' desire for my future.

276
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,245
Blessed Father, watch over my
wife and son with a ready sword.

277
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:57,332
Whisper to them, I live
only to hold them again.

278
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:00,669
<i>Ancestors, I honor you,</i>

279
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:05,132
and will try to live with the
dignity you have taught me.

280
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,239
Cicero.

281
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:34,953
Sir.

282
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:41,960
Do you ever find it
hard to do your duty?

283
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:47,257
Sometimes I do
what I want to do.

284
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:50,552
The rest of the time,
I do what I have to.

285
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:56,433
We may not be able to
go home, after all.

286
00:33:47,568 --> 00:33:50,362
Are you ready
to do your duty for Rome?

287
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:54,950
Yes, Father.

288
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:58,119
You will not be emperor.

289
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:03,792
Which wiser, older man
is to take my place?

290
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:06,419
My powers will pass to Maximus,

291
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,381
to hold in trust,

292
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:13,176
until the Senate is ready
to rule once more.

293
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:18,181
Rome is to be a republic again.

294
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:22,727
- Maximus.
- Yes.

295
00:34:28,818 --> 00:34:31,069
My decision disappoints you?

296
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:36,658
You wrote to me once,

297
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:40,954
listing the four chief virtues.

298
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:44,082
Wisdom,

299
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,625
Justice,

300
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,168
fortitude,

301
00:34:47,587 --> 00:34:49,379
and Temperance.

302
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:54,676
As I read the list, I
knew I had none of them.

303
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:58,096
But I have other
virtues, Father.

304
00:34:59,307 --> 00:35:00,640
Ambition.

305
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:04,853
That can be a virtue when
it drives us to excel.

306
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:09,274
Resourcefulness, courage.

307
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:14,654
Perhaps not on the battlefield, but
there are many forms of courage.

308
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:19,534
Devotion to my family,

309
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,037
to you.

310
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:26,333
But none of my virtues
were on your list.

311
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:31,921
Even then it was as if you
didn't want me for your son.

312
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:33,381
Commodus,

313
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:35,925
you go too far.

314
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:39,721
I searched the faces of the gods

315
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:44,851
for ways to please you,
to make you proud.

316
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:47,729
One kind word,

317
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:50,065
one full hug,

318
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:53,902
where you pressed me to your
chest and held me tight,

319
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:58,573
would have been like the sun
on my heart for 1,000 years.

320
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:03,036
What is it in me
you hate so much?

321
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,121
Shh... Commodus.

322
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,291
All I've ever wanted

323
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:12,837
was to live up to you, Caesar.

324
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,758
- Father.
- Commodus,

325
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,264
your faults as a son

326
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:27,602
is my failure as a father.

327
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,781
Come.

328
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:44,786
Father.

329
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:02,429
I would butcher the whole world,

330
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:05,807
if you would only have loved me!

331
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:46,556
Maximus, the Emperor needs you.
It's urgent.

332
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:53,855
Lament with me, brother.

333
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,900
Our great father is dead.

334
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:25,220
How did he die?

335
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:29,182
The surgeons
say there was no pain.

336
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:31,392
His breath gave out as he slept.

337
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:42,403
Father.

338
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:47,742
Your emperor asks for
your loyalty, Maximus.

339
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:50,703
Take my hand.

340
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:55,250
I only offer it once.

341
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:10,765
Quintus.

342
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,483
Hail, Caesar.

343
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:06,070
I must talk to the senators.
I need their counsel.

344
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:08,740
- Wake Gaius and Falco.
- Gaius and Falco.

345
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:11,034
- Sword.
- Sword.

346
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:16,456
Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.

347
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,334
Prudent? The Emperor
has been slain.

348
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:22,295
The emperor died
of natural causes.

349
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:26,299
- Why are you armed, Quintus?
- Guards!

350
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,679
Please don't fight, Maximus.

351
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:35,725
I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.

352
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:37,977
Ride until dawn,

353
00:40:39,188 --> 00:40:40,772
and then execute him.

354
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:43,274
Quintus, look at me. Look at me!

355
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:46,444
Promise me that you will
look after my family.

356
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:50,198
Your family will meet
you in the afterlife.

357
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:16,307
Kneel.

358
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:22,230
<i>Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son.</i>

359
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:25,400
<i>Whisper to them that I live
only to hold them again.</i>

360
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:30,405
At least give me a clean death.

361
00:41:32,116 --> 00:41:33,908
A soldier's death.

362
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:58,391
The frost, sometimes it
makes the blade stick.

363
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:20,455
Praetorian!

364
00:43:40,202 --> 00:43:42,120
<i>When was the
last time you were home?</i>

365
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:45,206
<i>Two years, 264
days and this morning.</i>

366
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:48,626
<i>Blessed Father, watch over my
wife and son with a ready sword.</i>

367
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:51,087
<i>I will try to live with the
dignity you have taught me.</i>

368
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:53,631
<i>Whisper to them, I live
only to hold them again.</i>

369
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:56,134
<i>With a ready sword, for
all else is dust and air.</i>

370
00:43:56,218 --> 00:43:59,387
<i>Whisper to them, I live
only to hold them again.</i>

371
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:01,764
<i>For all else is dust and air.</i>

372
00:45:02,034 --> 00:45:04,035
Papa!

373
00:47:48,116 --> 00:47:49,617
Don't die.

374
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:57,583
<i>You'll meet them again.</i>

375
00:47:59,628 --> 00:48:00,920
<i>Not yet.</i>

376
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:13,224
No. They will clean it.
Wait and see.

377
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:49,009
Don't die.

378
00:48:49,803 --> 00:48:52,221
They'll feed you to the lions.

379
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:54,598
They are worth more than we are.

380
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:06,068
Better now?

381
00:49:07,195 --> 00:49:09,071
Clean. You see?

382
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:42,646
Proximo!
My old friend.

383
00:49:44,024 --> 00:49:47,109
Every day is a great
day when you are here,

384
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:51,739
but today is your
most fortunate day.

385
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:58,078
Those giraffes you sold
me, they won't mate.

386
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:02,625
They just walk around
eating and not mating.

387
00:50:03,919 --> 00:50:06,837
You sold me queer giraffes.

388
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:10,257
- I want my money back.
- Not a chance.

389
00:50:14,012 --> 00:50:16,847
- I do special price for you.
- On what?

390
00:50:18,934 --> 00:50:21,852
Have you seen my new stock?
Come and see them.

391
00:50:35,784 --> 00:50:38,577
Do any of them fight?
I've got a match coming up.

392
00:50:38,662 --> 00:50:41,455
Some are good for fighting,
others for dying.

393
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:43,874
You need both, I think.

394
00:50:43,959 --> 00:50:45,167
Get up.

395
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:54,802
What's your trade?

396
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:56,762
I was a Hunter.

397
00:50:56,846 --> 00:51:00,558
No, I bought him from a
salt mine in Carthage.

398
00:51:01,351 --> 00:51:02,726
Sit down.

399
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:09,024
Mark of the legion.

400
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:10,109
Deserter.

401
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:11,860
Maybe so, but who cares?

402
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,445
He's a Spaniard.

403
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,489
I'll take six. For 1,000.

404
00:51:15,574 --> 00:51:19,076
1,000? The Numidian
alone is worth 2,000.

405
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,245
These slaves are rotten.

406
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:24,498
It all adds to the flavor.
No, no, no, wait! Wait!

407
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,709
I can negotiate.

408
00:51:27,836 --> 00:51:32,006
I'll give you 2,000, and
4,000 for the beasts.

409
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,216
That's 5,000 for an old friend.

410
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:55,279
Come on! How long does it take
to get into my own house?

411
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:57,281
I am Proximo.

412
00:51:57,991 --> 00:52:00,534
I shall be closer to you
for the next few days,

413
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:02,828
which will be the last
of your miserable lives,

414
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:07,249
than that bitch of a mother that
brought you screaming into this world.

415
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:10,878
I did not pay good money
for you for your company.

416
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:15,299
I paid it so that I could
profit from your death.

417
00:52:16,051 --> 00:52:19,803
And as your mother was
there at your beginning,

418
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:23,390
so I shall be there at your end.

419
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:27,936
And when you die,
and die you shall,

420
00:52:28,855 --> 00:52:31,774
your transition shall
be to the sound of...

421
00:52:36,488 --> 00:52:37,946
Gladiators,

422
00:52:39,074 --> 00:52:40,616
I salute you.

423
00:52:45,372 --> 00:52:46,413
Red.

424
00:52:50,085 --> 00:52:53,837
Yellow.

425
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:05,683
Good.

426
00:53:06,476 --> 00:53:07,851
- Red.
- Red.

427
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:14,066
Spaniard.

428
00:53:47,434 --> 00:53:49,768
That's enough
for the moment!

429
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:51,729
His time will come.

430
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:55,816
Next.

431
00:54:09,164 --> 00:54:10,497
Spaniard,

432
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,792
why don't you fight?

433
00:54:14,169 --> 00:54:15,627
We all have to fight.

434
00:54:15,712 --> 00:54:17,421
Well, I don't fight.

435
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:21,300
I shouldn't be here, I'm a
scribe, I write down words,

436
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:23,260
and speak seven languages.

437
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:24,386
Good.

438
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:28,348
Tomorrow, you can scream
in seven languages.

439
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:39,985
Perhaps the scribe will
be the one who wins his freedom.

440
00:54:40,987 --> 00:54:42,279
Freedom?

441
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:45,199
What do I have to do?

442
00:54:45,617 --> 00:54:47,910
You go in the arena
and you kill me.

443
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:49,369
And him,

444
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:52,080
and the Numidian,

445
00:54:52,165 --> 00:54:53,749
and the deserter.

446
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:56,794
And 100 more.

447
00:54:56,878 --> 00:54:59,713
And when there's no more
to fight, you're free.

448
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:02,132
I can't do that.

449
00:55:03,176 --> 00:55:04,384
No?

450
00:55:10,642 --> 00:55:12,059
But I can.

451
00:55:27,575 --> 00:55:29,785
Is that the sign of your gods?

452
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:37,084
Will that not anger them?

453
00:55:58,398 --> 00:56:00,065
The gods favor you.

454
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:02,609
Red is the gods' color.

455
00:56:03,987 --> 00:56:06,154
You will need their help today.

456
00:56:45,528 --> 00:56:47,154
Proximo!

457
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:54,661
Still leading with the German?

458
00:56:54,746 --> 00:56:56,830
The crowd
love a barbarian.

459
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:59,207
Besides that, he's
making me rich.

460
00:56:59,292 --> 00:57:01,919
Has that Numidian fought before?

461
00:57:02,754 --> 00:57:04,338
No, first time.

462
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:07,382
And that one,
laborer, soldier?

463
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,051
He's a Spaniard.

464
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:12,220
He might as well be a eunuch for
what he brings to the ring.

465
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:17,392
500 sestertii, the Numidian and
Spaniard team makes it through.

466
00:57:17,477 --> 00:57:21,188
And 1,000, that the Numidian
makes it through alone.

467
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:25,817
Are you asking me to bet
against my own man?

468
00:57:27,654 --> 00:57:29,154
It's unethical.

469
00:57:29,238 --> 00:57:31,114
What if I make it 2,000?

470
00:57:45,421 --> 00:57:48,465
Some of you are thinking
you won't fight,

471
00:57:49,759 --> 00:57:51,051
some that you can't fight.

472
00:57:52,387 --> 00:57:55,889
They all say that until
they're out there.

473
00:57:58,685 --> 00:57:59,851
Listen.

474
00:57:59,936 --> 00:58:02,854
- Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill!

475
00:58:09,988 --> 00:58:12,698
Thrust this into
another man's flesh,

476
00:58:13,116 --> 00:58:15,784
and they will applaud
and love you for that.

477
00:58:15,868 --> 00:58:17,285
And you,

478
00:58:19,247 --> 00:58:21,206
you may begin to love them

479
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:23,458
for that.

480
00:58:27,547 --> 00:58:31,049
Ultimately, we're all dead men.

481
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:35,887
Sadly, we cannot choose how,

482
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,933
but we can decide how
we meet that end,

483
00:58:40,852 --> 00:58:43,353
in order that we are remembered

484
00:58:45,273 --> 00:58:46,523
as men.

485
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:47,649
Come on!

486
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:52,904
On the left,
draw your shields!

487
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:56,324
On the right, draw your swords!

488
00:58:56,617 --> 00:58:59,161
- Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill!

489
00:59:00,288 --> 00:59:02,706
Pair them up,
red with yellow.

490
00:59:07,754 --> 00:59:08,962
Next!

491
00:59:14,844 --> 00:59:15,927
Move!

492
01:02:33,292 --> 01:02:35,377
Usurper!

493
01:02:56,983 --> 01:02:59,693
- Go away!
- You'll never rule us, Commodus!

494
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:34,811
He enters Rome like a conquering hero.
But what has he conquered?

495
01:03:35,104 --> 01:03:37,522
Give him time, Gracchus.
He's young.

496
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:39,899
I think he could do very well.

497
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:42,193
For Rome, or for you?

498
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:51,578
Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.

499
01:03:58,044 --> 01:04:00,086
- Lucius!
- Mother!

500
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:03,923
Hail, Caesar.

501
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:05,508
Senators.

502
01:04:09,138 --> 01:04:12,057
Rome greets her new emperor.

503
01:04:12,141 --> 01:04:15,685
Your loyal subjects bid
you welcome, Highness.

504
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:17,604
Thank you, Falco.

505
01:04:17,688 --> 01:04:21,775
And for the loyal subjects, I
trust they weren't too expensive.

506
01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:23,860
- Caesar.
- Gracchus.

507
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:26,446
All Rome rejoices in
your return, Caesar.

508
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:30,033
But there are many matters
that require your attention.

509
01:04:32,495 --> 01:04:35,372
To order, please.
To order.

510
01:04:35,831 --> 01:04:37,624
For your guidance, Caesar,

511
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:40,502
the Senate has prepared
a series of protocols

512
01:04:40,586 --> 01:04:43,671
to begin addressing the
many problems in the city,

513
01:04:43,756 --> 01:04:47,842
beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek Quarter,

514
01:04:48,344 --> 01:04:51,971
to combat the plague which is
already springing up there.

515
01:04:52,056 --> 01:04:53,098
So, if Caesar...

516
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:57,894
Don't you see, Gracchus?

517
01:04:59,313 --> 01:05:01,606
That's the very
problem, isn't it?

518
01:05:02,024 --> 01:05:04,692
My father spent all
his time at study,

519
01:05:06,445 --> 01:05:09,823
at books of learning
and philosophy.

520
01:05:10,825 --> 01:05:14,327
He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the Senate.

521
01:05:15,287 --> 01:05:18,498
And all the while, the
people were forgotten.

522
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:21,292
But the senate is
the people, sire,

523
01:05:21,377 --> 01:05:24,921
chosen from among the people
to speak for the people.

524
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:29,217
I doubt many of the people eat
so well as you do, Gracchus.

525
01:05:29,969 --> 01:05:32,429
Or have such splendid
mistresses, Gaius.

526
01:05:32,513 --> 01:05:34,597
I think I understand
my own people.

527
01:05:34,682 --> 01:05:38,184
Then perhaps Caesar will
be so good as to teach us,

528
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:41,229
out of his own
extensive experience.

529
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:46,651
I call it love.

530
01:05:47,236 --> 01:05:50,363
I am their father. The
people are my children.

531
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:53,158
And I shall hold them to my
bosom and embrace them tightly.

532
01:05:53,242 --> 01:05:56,703
Have you ever embraced someone
dying of plague, sire?

533
01:06:03,002 --> 01:06:05,628
No, but if you
interrupt me again,

534
01:06:07,131 --> 01:06:08,465
I assure you that you shall.

535
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:10,884
Senator, my brother
is very tired.

536
01:06:11,886 --> 01:06:16,055
Leave your list with me. Caesar
shall do all that Rome requires.

537
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:21,561
My lady, as always, your lightest
touch commands obedience.

538
01:06:28,694 --> 01:06:30,945
Who are they to lecture me?

539
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:33,781
Commodus, the Senate
has its uses.

540
01:06:33,866 --> 01:06:36,743
What uses? All they do is talk.

541
01:06:37,953 --> 01:06:42,499
It should be just you
and me and Rome.

542
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:45,919
Don't even think it. There's
always been a Senate.

543
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:48,087
Rome has changed.

544
01:06:48,172 --> 01:06:51,216
It takes an emperor
to rule an empire.

545
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:53,593
Of course, but leave
the people their...

546
01:06:53,677 --> 01:06:55,053
illusions?

547
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,097
Traditions.

548
01:06:58,974 --> 01:07:01,768
My father's war against
the barbarians.

549
01:07:02,353 --> 01:07:06,022
He said it himself, it achieved nothing.
But the people loved him.

550
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:07,982
The people always
love victories.

551
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:11,736
Why? They didn't
see the battles.

552
01:07:13,072 --> 01:07:15,031
What do they care
about Germania?

553
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:17,450
They care about the
greatness of Rome.

554
01:07:17,535 --> 01:07:19,452
"The greatness of Rome."

555
01:07:21,413 --> 01:07:23,206
Well, what is that?

556
01:07:25,918 --> 01:07:29,128
It's an idea. Greatness.

557
01:07:32,883 --> 01:07:36,302
- Greatness is a vision.
- Exactly. A vision.

558
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:40,348
Do you not see, Lucilia?

559
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:45,687
I will give the people a vision of
Rome, and they'll love me for it.

560
01:07:46,313 --> 01:07:50,733
And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry old men.

561
01:08:02,121 --> 01:08:05,456
I will give the people the
greatest vision of their lives.

562
01:08:56,675 --> 01:08:59,594
White and red wine for
your drinking pleasure!

563
01:09:07,895 --> 01:09:09,062
Games.

564
01:09:11,357 --> 01:09:14,400
One hundred and fifty
days of games.

565
01:09:14,902 --> 01:09:16,444
He's cleverer than I thought.

566
01:09:16,528 --> 01:09:20,073
Clever. The whole of Rome
would be laughing at him,

567
01:09:20,908 --> 01:09:23,159
if they weren't so afraid
of his Praetorians.

568
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:26,037
Fear and wonder.
A powerful combination.

569
01:09:27,456 --> 01:09:30,583
You really think the people are
going to be seduced by that?

570
01:09:30,668 --> 01:09:33,753
I think he knows what Rome is.
Rome is the mob.

571
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:37,590
Conjure magic for them, and
they'll be distracted.

572
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:41,427
Take away their freedom,
and still they'll roar.

573
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:46,349
The beating heart of Rome is
not the marble of the Senate.

574
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:48,434
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

575
01:09:50,437 --> 01:09:52,480
He'll bring them death,

576
01:09:54,233 --> 01:09:56,609
and they will love him for it.

577
01:10:19,299 --> 01:10:21,384
All you do is kill, kill, kill.

578
01:10:21,468 --> 01:10:23,886
The crowd don't want a
butcher, they want a hero.

579
01:10:23,971 --> 01:10:26,013
We want them to
keep coming back.

580
01:10:26,098 --> 01:10:30,268
So don't just hack them to pieces,
remember you are an entertainer.

581
01:10:32,855 --> 01:10:34,230
Spaniard.

582
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:43,573
So entertain!

583
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:52,809
Are you not entertained?
Are you not entertained?

584
01:11:55,103 --> 01:11:57,355
Is this not why you're here?

585
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:04,987
Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

586
01:12:05,572 --> 01:12:09,450
- Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!
- Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

587
01:12:22,256 --> 01:12:24,006
What do you want?

588
01:12:26,552 --> 01:12:27,718
Girl?

589
01:12:28,762 --> 01:12:29,929
Boy?

590
01:12:30,848 --> 01:12:33,099
- You sent for me.
- Yes, I did.

591
01:12:34,184 --> 01:12:37,270
You're good, Spaniard, but
you're not that good.

592
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:38,521
You could be magnificent.

593
01:12:38,605 --> 01:12:42,108
I'm required to kill, so I kill.
That is enough.

594
01:12:42,943 --> 01:12:46,028
That's enough for the
provinces, but not for Rome.

595
01:12:49,408 --> 01:12:53,327
The young emperor has arranged
a series of spectacles

596
01:12:53,412 --> 01:12:57,582
to commemorate his
father, Marcus Aurelius.

597
01:12:58,125 --> 01:13:00,084
I find that amusing,

598
01:13:00,419 --> 01:13:03,504
since it was Marcus
Aurelius, the wise,

599
01:13:03,589 --> 01:13:07,049
the all-knowing Marcus
Aurelius, that closed us down.

600
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:14,181
So finally, after five years
of scratching a living

601
01:13:14,266 --> 01:13:16,475
in flea-infested villages,

602
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,604
we're finally going back
to where we belong.

603
01:13:20,314 --> 01:13:21,898
The Colosseum.

604
01:13:24,151 --> 01:13:26,944
You should see the
Colosseum, Spaniard.

605
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:30,323
Fifty thousand Romans,

606
01:13:31,283 --> 01:13:35,119
watching every movement
of your sword,

607
01:13:36,538 --> 01:13:39,040
willing you to make
that killer blow.

608
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:43,836
The silence before you strike
and the noise afterwards.

609
01:13:44,838 --> 01:13:48,466
It rises. It rises up,

610
01:13:49,676 --> 01:13:51,302
like a storm.

611
01:13:52,095 --> 01:13:54,764
As if you were the
thunder god himself.

612
01:13:54,848 --> 01:13:57,808
- You were a gladiator?
- Yes, I was.

613
01:14:04,232 --> 01:14:06,442
You won your freedom?

614
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:08,861
A long time ago, the Emperor

615
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:12,615
presented me with a rudius.

616
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:15,409
It's just a wooden sword.

617
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,372
The symbol of your freedom.

618
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:24,543
He touched me on the
shoulder, and I was free.

619
01:14:25,921 --> 01:14:28,339
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

620
01:14:28,423 --> 01:14:32,677
I did not say I knew him. I said he
touched me on the shoulder once.

621
01:14:33,303 --> 01:14:35,388
You asked me what I want.

622
01:14:36,723 --> 01:14:39,684
I, too, want to stand in
front of the Emperor,

623
01:14:40,936 --> 01:14:42,353
as you did.

624
01:14:42,437 --> 01:14:45,856
Then listen to me.
Learn from me.

625
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:49,777
I wasn't the best because
I killed quickly.

626
01:14:50,988 --> 01:14:53,656
I was the best because
the crowd loved me.

627
01:14:54,741 --> 01:14:58,077
Win the crowd, and
you'll win your freedom.

628
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:04,417
I will win the crowd.

629
01:15:06,628 --> 01:15:10,089
I will give them something
they've never seen before.

630
01:15:11,091 --> 01:15:14,093
So, Spaniard, we shall
go to Rome together

631
01:15:14,761 --> 01:15:16,595
and have bloody adventures.

632
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,472
And the great whore
will suckle us

633
01:15:18,557 --> 01:15:21,142
until we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more.

634
01:15:21,226 --> 01:15:22,685
And then,

635
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:25,938
when enough men have died,

636
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:30,568
perhaps you will
have your freedom.

637
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:37,324
Here. Use this.

638
01:16:01,058 --> 01:16:04,226
It's somewhere out
there, my country.

639
01:16:05,312 --> 01:16:06,645
My home.

640
01:16:07,814 --> 01:16:09,982
My wife is preparing food.

641
01:16:10,942 --> 01:16:13,652
My daughters carry
water from the river.

642
01:16:14,988 --> 01:16:17,031
Will I ever see them again?

643
01:16:18,325 --> 01:16:19,825
I think, no.

644
01:16:20,118 --> 01:16:22,578
Do you believe you'll see
them again when you die?

645
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:24,038
I think so.

646
01:16:24,664 --> 01:16:27,750
But then, I will die soon.

647
01:16:29,377 --> 01:16:31,837
They will not die
for many years.

648
01:16:32,631 --> 01:16:34,298
I'll have to wait.

649
01:16:34,382 --> 01:16:36,550
But you would? Wait?

650
01:16:37,177 --> 01:16:38,552
Of course.

651
01:16:40,472 --> 01:16:41,847
You see,

652
01:16:43,016 --> 01:16:46,560
my wife and my son

653
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:50,439
are already waiting for me.

654
01:16:50,524 --> 01:16:54,193
You'll meet them again.
But not yet.

655
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,615
Not yet.

656
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:02,910
- Unless...
- Not yet.

657
01:17:06,915 --> 01:17:08,207
Not yet.

658
01:17:21,096 --> 01:17:22,638
There he is.

659
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:12,897
Out.

660
01:18:14,107 --> 01:18:16,025
Move, go, out!

661
01:18:28,747 --> 01:18:31,248
Good to see you
again, old friend.

662
01:18:36,588 --> 01:18:38,297
Bring me fortune.

663
01:18:42,886 --> 01:18:45,763
Have you ever seen
anything like that before?

664
01:18:46,848 --> 01:18:49,433
I didn't know men could
build such things.

665
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:00,986
Win the crowd.

666
01:19:01,196 --> 01:19:03,530
Get inside. Move.

667
01:19:03,615 --> 01:19:04,907
Inside.

668
01:19:54,124 --> 01:19:56,875
He sleeps so well
because he's loved.

669
01:19:59,796 --> 01:20:01,880
Come, brother. It's late.

670
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:08,304
I will make Rome
the wonder of the ages.

671
01:20:11,099 --> 01:20:14,435
That is what Gracchus and his
friends don't understand.

672
01:20:14,853 --> 01:20:18,063
All my desires are splitting
my head to pieces.

673
01:20:25,113 --> 01:20:27,865
Commodus, drink this tonic.

674
01:20:37,417 --> 01:20:39,877
I think the time
is almost right.

675
01:20:40,253 --> 01:20:43,172
I could announce the
dissolution of the Senate

676
01:20:43,256 --> 01:20:45,341
at the celebration
to honor our father.

677
01:20:45,425 --> 01:20:47,384
Do you think I should?

678
01:20:48,136 --> 01:20:50,054
Are the people ready?

679
01:20:52,182 --> 01:20:54,558
I think you need your rest now.

680
01:21:00,482 --> 01:21:02,316
Will you stay with me?

681
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,818
Still afraid of the
dark, brother?

682
01:21:11,576 --> 01:21:12,785
Still.

683
01:21:14,621 --> 01:21:15,913
Always.

684
01:21:17,624 --> 01:21:20,501
- Stay with me tonight.
- You know I won't.

685
01:21:24,964 --> 01:21:26,507
Then kiss me.

686
01:21:35,308 --> 01:21:36,850
Sleep, brother.

687
01:22:29,654 --> 01:22:31,780
Having servants who
are deaf and mute

688
01:22:31,865 --> 01:22:34,616
at least ensures I
live a little longer.

689
01:22:36,411 --> 01:22:38,745
They're
arresting scholars now.

690
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:42,666
Anyone who dare speak out. Even
satirists and chroniclers.

691
01:22:43,293 --> 01:22:45,210
And mathematicians.

692
01:22:46,421 --> 01:22:48,547
And all to feed the arena.

693
01:22:50,216 --> 01:22:52,634
The Senate did not
approve martial law.

694
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:55,554
This reign of terror is
entirely the Praetorians.

695
01:22:56,723 --> 01:22:58,849
I'm afraid to go out after dark.

696
01:22:58,933 --> 01:23:02,478
You should be more afraid of
your activities during the day.

697
01:23:02,562 --> 01:23:07,274
The Senate is full of his spies,
led by that whore master, Falco.

698
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:13,030
But what is in his mind? That's
what I trouble myself with.

699
01:23:13,823 --> 01:23:16,742
He spends all his days
singularly obsessed,

700
01:23:16,826 --> 01:23:19,661
planning the festival
to honor your father.

701
01:23:19,746 --> 01:23:23,332
He neglects even the most
fundamental task of government.

702
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:26,293
So just what is he planning?

703
01:23:26,669 --> 01:23:28,295
And what pays for it?

704
01:23:28,379 --> 01:23:32,591
These daily games are costing a
fortune, yet we have no new taxes.

705
01:23:33,343 --> 01:23:34,760
The future.

706
01:23:36,137 --> 01:23:38,180
The future pays for it.

707
01:23:39,641 --> 01:23:42,518
He's started selling
the grain reserves.

708
01:23:42,602 --> 01:23:44,436
This can't be true.

709
01:23:45,063 --> 01:23:47,564
He's selling
Rome's reserves of grain.

710
01:23:48,149 --> 01:23:51,068
The people will be
starving in two years.

711
01:23:51,611 --> 01:23:53,111
I hope they're
enjoying the games,

712
01:23:53,196 --> 01:23:56,573
because soon enough they'll
be dead because of them.

713
01:23:56,908 --> 01:23:59,243
- Rome must know this.
- And how?

714
01:23:59,744 --> 01:24:02,120
He's going to
dissolve the Senate.

715
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:06,291
And who will tell them before
it's too late? You, Gracchus?

716
01:24:07,627 --> 01:24:09,127
You, Gaius.

717
01:24:09,212 --> 01:24:10,921
Will you make a speech on
the floor of the Senate,

718
01:24:11,005 --> 01:24:12,756
denouncing my brother?

719
01:24:13,299 --> 01:24:15,842
And then see your family
in the Colosseum?

720
01:24:16,803 --> 01:24:18,178
Who'd dare?

721
01:24:27,355 --> 01:24:30,399
I have been living in a
prison of fear every day,

722
01:24:30,483 --> 01:24:33,068
because my son is
heir to the throne.

723
01:24:38,658 --> 01:24:40,158
He must die.

724
01:24:44,497 --> 01:24:45,664
Quintus and
the Praetorians

725
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:48,292
would simply seize
control for themselves.

726
01:24:48,376 --> 01:24:52,254
No. Cut off the head and
the snake cannot strike.

727
01:24:52,338 --> 01:24:54,381
Lucilia,
Gaius is right.

728
01:24:54,465 --> 01:24:58,594
Until we can neutralize the
Praetorians, we can achieve nothing.

729
01:25:00,138 --> 01:25:01,638
So we do nothing?

730
01:25:01,723 --> 01:25:04,516
No, child.
We keep our counsel.

731
01:25:05,518 --> 01:25:06,852
We prepare.

732
01:25:07,687 --> 01:25:12,482
As long as the people support
him, we are voices without steel.

733
01:25:13,276 --> 01:25:14,693
We are air.

734
01:25:17,697 --> 01:25:20,490
But with every day that
passes, he makes enemies.

735
01:25:20,575 --> 01:25:23,452
One day, he'll have more
enemies than friends.

736
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:26,830
And on that day, we will act.

737
01:25:27,415 --> 01:25:29,291
Then we will strike.

738
01:25:30,209 --> 01:25:31,960
But until then,

739
01:25:33,129 --> 01:25:34,713
we are docile.

740
01:25:35,173 --> 01:25:37,341
We are obedient.

741
01:25:38,926 --> 01:25:40,927
And we are treacherous.

742
01:25:49,562 --> 01:25:50,729
Come on!

743
01:25:59,572 --> 01:26:01,615
All right, that's enough.

744
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:25,580
The Emperor
wants battles,

745
01:26:25,598 --> 01:26:27,766
and I don't want to
sacrifice my best fighters.

746
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:31,186
The crowd wants battles, so the
Emperor gives them battles.

747
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:34,856
- You get the battle of Carthage.
- Massacre of Carthage.

748
01:26:36,818 --> 01:26:38,235
Well, why don't you go
down to the prison,

749
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:40,320
round up all the
beggars and thieves?

750
01:26:40,405 --> 01:26:41,571
We've done that.

751
01:26:41,656 --> 01:26:44,032
If you want to give away
the best gladiators

752
01:26:44,117 --> 01:26:45,283
in the whole of the empire,

753
01:26:45,368 --> 01:26:47,494
then I want double the rates.

754
01:26:47,578 --> 01:26:51,373
You'll get your contract rates, or
you'll get your contract canceled.

755
01:26:51,457 --> 01:26:52,874
You don't like it?

756
01:26:52,959 --> 01:26:56,920
Then you can crawl back down that
shit hole that you came from.

757
01:27:00,007 --> 01:27:02,175
Cassius, please.
You can free us.

758
01:27:31,998 --> 01:27:35,125
Gladiator, are you the one
they call the Spaniard?

759
01:27:35,209 --> 01:27:36,334
Yes.

760
01:27:37,128 --> 01:27:39,337
They said you were a giant.

761
01:27:39,422 --> 01:27:42,591
They said you could crush a
man's skull with one hand.

762
01:27:42,675 --> 01:27:44,426
A man's? No.

763
01:27:45,762 --> 01:27:47,095
A boy's.

764
01:27:49,098 --> 01:27:52,642
- Do they have good horses in Spain?
- Some of the best.

765
01:27:53,686 --> 01:27:56,772
This is Argento and
this is Scarto.

766
01:27:58,191 --> 01:27:59,983
They were my horses.

767
01:28:00,902 --> 01:28:02,986
They were taken from me.

768
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:06,573
I like you, Spaniard.
I shall cheer for you.

769
01:28:07,116 --> 01:28:10,452
- They let you watch the games?
- My uncle says it makes me strong.

770
01:28:10,536 --> 01:28:13,830
- And what does your father say?
- My father is dead.

771
01:28:15,583 --> 01:28:17,667
Master Lucius, it is time.

772
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,295
I have to go.

773
01:28:20,379 --> 01:28:21,963
Your name is Lucius?

774
01:28:24,091 --> 01:28:26,760
Lucius Verus, after my father.

775
01:28:57,416 --> 01:28:59,125
Lower!

776
01:29:04,257 --> 01:29:07,175
- Claudius!
- Yes?

777
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:09,678
- More shields!
- All right.

778
01:29:28,781 --> 01:29:33,535
When the Emperor enters,
raise your weapons, salute him,

779
01:29:33,619 --> 01:29:35,662
and then speak together.

780
01:29:36,455 --> 01:29:39,958
Face the Emperor and don't
turn your back on him.

781
01:29:41,043 --> 01:29:43,879
Go, and die with honor.

782
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:41,061
Hail, mighty Caesar!

783
01:30:44,273 --> 01:30:47,317
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

784
01:30:47,401 --> 01:30:48,641
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

785
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:54,532
- We who are about to die salute you!
- We who are about to die salute you!

786
01:30:56,243 --> 01:30:57,827
On this day

787
01:30:58,537 --> 01:31:01,539
we reach back to
hallowed antiquity

788
01:31:02,416 --> 01:31:06,086
to bring you a re-creation
of the second fall

789
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:08,213
of mighty Carthage!

790
01:31:11,926 --> 01:31:16,346
On the barren plain of Zama

791
01:31:16,973 --> 01:31:20,058
there stood the
invincible armies

792
01:31:20,434 --> 01:31:23,061
of the barbarian Hannibal.

793
01:31:23,771 --> 01:31:26,940
Ferocious mercenaries
and warriors

794
01:31:27,024 --> 01:31:29,401
from all brute nations,

795
01:31:29,485 --> 01:31:33,780
bent on merciless destruction,

796
01:31:34,657 --> 01:31:36,032
conquest.

797
01:31:36,951 --> 01:31:40,996
Your emperor is
pleased to give you

798
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:44,124
the barbarian horde!

799
01:31:52,466 --> 01:31:54,467
Anyone here been in the army?

800
01:31:54,552 --> 01:31:57,470
Yes. I served
with you at Vindobona.

801
01:31:58,431 --> 01:32:00,098
You can help me.

802
01:32:01,392 --> 01:32:03,935
Whatever comes out
of these gates,

803
01:32:04,687 --> 01:32:08,481
we've got a better chance of
survival if we work together.

804
01:32:08,566 --> 01:32:10,275
Do you understand?

805
01:32:12,403 --> 01:32:14,446
If we stay together, we survive.

806
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:17,657
The Emperor is pleased to
bring you the legionnaires

807
01:32:17,742 --> 01:32:21,327
of Scipio Africanus!

808
01:32:32,131 --> 01:32:33,840
To the death!

809
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:40,221
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

810
01:32:44,101 --> 01:32:45,643
Stay close.

811
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:53,526
Come together!

812
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:58,907
Stay close. Staggered columns!

813
01:33:12,129 --> 01:33:14,172
You don't have a chance.

814
01:33:25,518 --> 01:33:28,061
Lock your shields.
Stay as one.

815
01:33:29,563 --> 01:33:31,147
Hold!

816
01:33:33,192 --> 01:33:36,194
Hold! As one!

817
01:33:39,115 --> 01:33:40,448
Well done.

818
01:33:52,336 --> 01:33:56,172
Hold. Down low!

819
01:34:01,971 --> 01:34:03,179
Yes!

820
01:34:15,276 --> 01:34:16,526
Hagen!

821
01:34:40,634 --> 01:34:44,179
This column to the chariot!
This column stay with me!

822
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:49,184
Quickly!

823
01:34:49,852 --> 01:34:52,604
- Get out there.
- Hurry!

824
01:35:33,812 --> 01:35:34,979
Maximus!

825
01:35:47,201 --> 01:35:49,619
Single column! Single column!

826
01:36:34,915 --> 01:36:36,332
We win!

827
01:36:41,714 --> 01:36:44,215
My history's a little
hazy, Cassius,

828
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:47,969
but shouldn't the barbarians
lose the battle of Carthage?

829
01:36:48,053 --> 01:36:49,804
Yes, sire.

830
01:36:51,724 --> 01:36:53,099
Forgive me, sire.

831
01:36:53,183 --> 01:36:55,893
No, I rather
enjoy surprises.

832
01:36:56,687 --> 01:36:57,812
Who is he?

833
01:36:57,896 --> 01:37:00,898
They call him the
Spaniard, sire.

834
01:37:03,402 --> 01:37:05,320
I think I'll meet him.

835
01:37:05,404 --> 01:37:06,738
Yes, sire.

836
01:37:08,949 --> 01:37:10,867
Hail to the barbarians!

837
01:37:25,799 --> 01:37:29,218
Forward! Arms at ready!

838
01:37:42,775 --> 01:37:44,442
Drop your weapons.

839
01:37:48,447 --> 01:37:51,407
Gladiator, the Emperor
has asked for you.

840
01:37:51,992 --> 01:37:54,243
I am at the Emperor's service.

841
01:38:20,938 --> 01:38:23,064
Rise. Rise.

842
01:38:32,408 --> 01:38:34,659
Your fame is well
deserved, Spaniard.

843
01:38:34,743 --> 01:38:37,245
I don't think there's ever
been a gladiator to match you.

844
01:38:37,329 --> 01:38:40,248
As for this young man, he
insists you are Hector reborn.

845
01:38:40,332 --> 01:38:41,916
Or was it Hercules?

846
01:38:43,335 --> 01:38:47,171
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself
and tell us all your real name?

847
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:50,842
You do have a name.

848
01:38:51,635 --> 01:38:53,511
My name is Gladiator.

849
01:38:56,807 --> 01:38:59,976
How dare you show your back to me?
Slave!

850
01:39:01,353 --> 01:39:04,689
You will remove your helmet
and tell me your name.

851
01:39:16,452 --> 01:39:18,953
My name is Maximus
Decimus Meridius,

852
01:39:19,329 --> 01:39:21,289
commander of the
armies of the north,

853
01:39:21,373 --> 01:39:23,708
general of the Felix Legions,

854
01:39:23,792 --> 01:39:27,086
loyal servant to the true
emperor, Marcus Aurelius,

855
01:39:28,505 --> 01:39:30,673
father to a murdered son,

856
01:39:31,133 --> 01:39:33,426
husband to a murdered wife,

857
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:37,513
and I will have my vengeance,
in this life or the next.

858
01:39:44,521 --> 01:39:45,897
Arms!

859
01:39:58,994 --> 01:40:02,330
Live! Live! Live! Live!

860
01:40:02,414 --> 01:40:05,625
- Live! Live! Live! Live!
- Live! Live! Live! Live!

861
01:40:49,628 --> 01:40:52,338
Arms, at rest!

862
01:41:44,850 --> 01:41:49,312
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

863
01:42:37,402 --> 01:42:38,569
Father.

864
01:43:52,936 --> 01:43:54,812
Why is he still alive?

865
01:43:56,064 --> 01:43:57,565
I don't know.

866
01:43:58,066 --> 01:43:59,650
He shouldn't be alive.

867
01:44:00,485 --> 01:44:01,902
It vexes me.

868
01:44:03,655 --> 01:44:05,448
I'm terribly vexed.

869
01:44:16,668 --> 01:44:18,586
I did what I had to do.

870
01:44:19,337 --> 01:44:23,382
If Father had had his way, the
empire would have been torn apart.

871
01:44:23,467 --> 01:44:25,134
You do see that.

872
01:44:25,510 --> 01:44:26,677
Yes.

873
01:44:31,475 --> 01:44:34,685
What did you feel
when you saw him?

874
01:44:36,813 --> 01:44:38,439
I felt nothing.

875
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:42,943
He wounded you
deeply, didn't he?

876
01:44:43,987 --> 01:44:46,197
No more than I wounded him.

877
01:44:50,702 --> 01:44:52,995
They lied to me in Germania.

878
01:44:54,623 --> 01:44:56,707
They told me he was dead.

879
01:44:58,710 --> 01:45:01,295
If they lie to me,
they don't respect me.

880
01:45:01,379 --> 01:45:04,715
If they don't respect me,
how can they ever love me?

881
01:45:06,051 --> 01:45:08,427
Then you must let
the legions know

882
01:45:08,512 --> 01:45:11,597
their treachery will
not go unpunished.

883
01:45:12,432 --> 01:45:13,891
Poor sister.

884
01:45:14,309 --> 01:45:16,769
I wouldn't want
to be your enemy.

885
01:45:17,979 --> 01:45:19,730
What will you do?

886
01:45:32,702 --> 01:45:34,036
This way.

887
01:46:09,406 --> 01:46:12,867
Rich matrons pay well to be
pleasured by the bravest champions.

888
01:46:12,951 --> 01:46:15,452
I knew your brother
would send assassins.

889
01:46:15,954 --> 01:46:17,580
I didn't realize he
would send his best.

890
01:46:20,208 --> 01:46:22,293
Maximus, he doesn't know.

891
01:46:23,253 --> 01:46:26,380
My family was burnt and crucified
while they were still alive.

892
01:46:26,464 --> 01:46:29,008
- I knew nothing...
- Don't lie to me!

893
01:46:35,473 --> 01:46:37,224
I wept for them.

894
01:46:37,309 --> 01:46:41,145
As you wept for your father?
As you wept for your father?

895
01:46:41,229 --> 01:46:44,815
I have been living in a prison
of fear since that day.

896
01:46:45,317 --> 01:46:49,153
To be unable to mourn your
father for fear of your brother.

897
01:46:50,030 --> 01:46:53,240
To live in terror every
moment of every day,

898
01:46:53,325 --> 01:46:56,118
because your son is
heir to the throne.

899
01:46:57,996 --> 01:46:59,455
I have wept.

900
01:47:00,790 --> 01:47:03,626
My son was innocent.

901
01:47:04,461 --> 01:47:06,503
So is mine.

902
01:47:08,506 --> 01:47:11,592
Must my son die, too,
before you'll trust me?

903
01:47:13,053 --> 01:47:16,013
What does it matter if
I trust you or not?

904
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:19,934
The gods have spared you.
Don't you understand?

905
01:47:20,018 --> 01:47:23,479
Today I saw a slave become more
powerful than the emperor of Rome.

906
01:47:23,563 --> 01:47:25,356
The gods have spared me?

907
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:28,901
I am at their mercy, with the
power only to amuse a mob.

908
01:47:28,985 --> 01:47:30,527
That is power.

909
01:47:31,029 --> 01:47:32,154
The mob is Rome.

910
01:47:32,238 --> 01:47:35,866
And while Commodus controls
them, he controls everything.

911
01:47:36,201 --> 01:47:37,743
Listen to me.

912
01:47:38,286 --> 01:47:41,413
My brother has enemies,
most of all in the Senate.

913
01:47:41,498 --> 01:47:43,749
But while the people follow him,

914
01:47:43,833 --> 01:47:46,877
no one would dare stand
up to him until you.

915
01:47:47,837 --> 01:47:50,130
They oppose him, yet
they do nothing.

916
01:47:50,215 --> 01:47:53,968
There are some politicians who have
dedicated their lives to Rome.

917
01:47:54,052 --> 01:47:55,803
One man above all.

918
01:47:56,888 --> 01:47:59,974
If I can arrange it,
will you meet him?

919
01:48:00,308 --> 01:48:02,226
Do you not understand?

920
01:48:02,477 --> 01:48:06,689
I may die in this cell tonight, or
in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!

921
01:48:06,773 --> 01:48:09,441
What possible
difference can I make?

922
01:48:09,734 --> 01:48:11,986
This man wants what you want.

923
01:48:12,070 --> 01:48:14,279
Then have him kill Commodus!

924
01:48:16,908 --> 01:48:18,701
I knew a man once,

925
01:48:19,619 --> 01:48:20,911
a noble man.

926
01:48:21,913 --> 01:48:24,790
A man of principle
who loved my father,

927
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:27,835
and my father loved him.

928
01:48:29,796 --> 01:48:31,964
This man served Rome well.

929
01:48:36,302 --> 01:48:38,012
That man is gone.

930
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:41,306
Your brother did his work well.

931
01:48:41,391 --> 01:48:43,058
Let me help you.

932
01:48:48,982 --> 01:48:52,067
Yes, you can help me.

933
01:48:55,405 --> 01:48:59,116
Forget you ever knew me,
never come here again.

934
01:49:02,787 --> 01:49:05,539
Guard! The lady is
finished with me.

935
01:49:33,985 --> 01:49:35,652
What's your name?

936
01:49:38,656 --> 01:49:40,240
Julian Crassus.

937
01:49:45,747 --> 01:49:46,997
Name?

938
01:49:48,291 --> 01:49:49,792
Marcus, sire.

939
01:49:50,710 --> 01:49:52,419
My father's name.

940
01:49:59,928 --> 01:50:02,096
They must have known
of Maximus' escape,

941
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:05,015
when they found the
bodies of the four men.

942
01:50:05,475 --> 01:50:08,060
They thought it was
a barbarian raid.

943
01:50:09,104 --> 01:50:12,272
These are good men, sire.
Loyal to the Emperor.

944
01:50:19,614 --> 01:50:21,323
Load your arrows!

945
01:50:28,957 --> 01:50:30,874
Prepare to fire!

946
01:50:51,396 --> 01:50:54,690
Then perhaps it
was you who knew,

947
01:50:55,525 --> 01:50:57,234
and never told me.

948
01:50:57,485 --> 01:50:59,736
- I didn't know.
- You didn't know?

949
01:51:01,239 --> 01:51:04,074
But a general is
always in control.

950
01:51:05,451 --> 01:51:09,121
Always in command, isn't he?

951
01:51:10,665 --> 01:51:12,124
Yes, Caesar.

952
01:51:26,055 --> 01:51:28,765
Then give the command. Say it.

953
01:51:45,658 --> 01:51:46,783
Fire.

954
01:52:22,028 --> 01:52:23,362
Maximus.

955
01:52:24,113 --> 01:52:27,241
You commanded legions?
You had many victories?

956
01:52:28,117 --> 01:52:30,327
- Yes.
- In Germania?

957
01:52:32,247 --> 01:52:33,997
In many countries.

958
01:52:35,583 --> 01:52:36,917
General.

959
01:53:26,009 --> 01:53:27,884
You have a great name.

960
01:53:29,387 --> 01:53:32,431
He must kill your name
before he kills you.

961
01:53:41,399 --> 01:53:42,733
Yes, at the far end.

962
01:53:42,817 --> 01:53:44,735
- Senator Gaius.
- Hello.

963
01:53:45,236 --> 01:53:47,195
Senator Gracchus.

964
01:53:48,781 --> 01:53:52,200
Don't often see you enjoying the
pleasures of the vulgar crowd.

965
01:53:52,285 --> 01:53:55,412
I don't pretend to be a man
of the people, Senator,

966
01:53:55,496 --> 01:53:57,998
but I do try to be a
man for the people.

967
01:54:14,265 --> 01:54:16,767
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

968
01:54:16,851 --> 01:54:19,519
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

969
01:54:24,025 --> 01:54:25,650
People of Rome!

970
01:54:27,945 --> 01:54:30,405
On the fourth day of Antioch,

971
01:54:31,032 --> 01:54:35,410
we can celebrate the
64th day of the games.

972
01:54:36,037 --> 01:54:40,290
And in his majestic Charity,

973
01:54:41,042 --> 01:54:45,253
the Emperor has deigned this day
to favor the people of Rome

974
01:54:45,838 --> 01:54:49,257
with an historical final match.

975
01:54:50,051 --> 01:54:54,638
Returning to the Colosseum today,
after five years in retirement,

976
01:54:56,057 --> 01:54:59,518
Caesar is pleased to bring you

977
01:54:59,602 --> 01:55:03,397
the only undefeated champion

978
01:55:03,481 --> 01:55:05,440
in Roman history,

979
01:55:05,525 --> 01:55:10,445
the legendary Tigris of Gaul!

980
01:55:32,009 --> 01:55:35,178
He knows too well how
to manipulate the mob.

981
01:55:35,263 --> 01:55:37,973
Marcus Aurelius had a dream
that was Rome, Proximo.

982
01:55:38,057 --> 01:55:40,851
This is not it. This is not it!

983
01:55:40,935 --> 01:55:43,770
Marcus Aurelius
is dead, Maximus.

984
01:55:44,605 --> 01:55:47,190
We mortals are but
shadows and dust.

985
01:55:47,859 --> 01:55:49,985
Shadows and dust, Maximus!

986
01:55:50,069 --> 01:55:53,947
Representing the training
lyceum of Antonius Proximo,

987
01:55:54,031 --> 01:55:57,701
Caesar is proud to give you.

988
01:55:57,785 --> 01:56:01,621
Aelius Maximus!

989
01:56:14,427 --> 01:56:16,803
They embrace him like
he's one of their own.

990
01:56:16,888 --> 01:56:20,807
The mob is fickle, brother.
He'll be forgotten in a month.

991
01:56:23,561 --> 01:56:26,396
No, much sooner than that.

992
01:56:28,316 --> 01:56:30,108
It's been arranged.

993
01:56:48,628 --> 01:56:51,588
We who are about
to die salute you.

994
01:56:54,926 --> 01:56:56,718
We're with you, Maximus!

995
01:57:39,303 --> 01:57:41,096
Fight on, finish it!

996
01:58:09,333 --> 01:58:11,001
Pull, pull!

997
01:58:43,367 --> 01:58:44,909
Loose! Loose!

998
01:59:13,022 --> 01:59:15,106
- Gut him!
- Kill!

999
01:59:16,567 --> 01:59:20,153
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

1000
01:59:40,591 --> 01:59:42,634
- Kill!
- Kill!

1001
02:00:20,506 --> 02:00:22,716
Maximus the Merciful!

1002
02:00:31,892 --> 02:00:35,395
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1003
02:00:35,479 --> 02:00:37,647
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1004
02:00:44,864 --> 02:00:47,490
Forward, arms at ready!

1005
02:01:17,480 --> 02:01:19,856
What am I going to do with you?

1006
02:01:21,025 --> 02:01:24,486
You simply won't die.

1007
02:01:29,241 --> 02:01:31,618
Are we so different, you and I?

1008
02:01:32,745 --> 02:01:35,663
You take life when you
have to, as I do.

1009
02:01:37,041 --> 02:01:40,710
I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.

1010
02:01:41,253 --> 02:01:43,004
Then take it now.

1011
02:01:56,060 --> 02:01:58,061
They tell me your son

1012
02:01:58,854 --> 02:02:02,774
squealed like a girl when
they nailed him to the cross.

1013
02:02:04,902 --> 02:02:06,569
And your wife

1014
02:02:07,822 --> 02:02:09,739
moaned like a whore

1015
02:02:10,866 --> 02:02:15,411
when they ravaged
her again and again

1016
02:02:16,747 --> 02:02:18,164
and again.

1017
02:02:23,420 --> 02:02:27,173
The time for honoring yourself
will soon be at an end,

1018
02:02:31,762 --> 02:02:33,137
Highness.

1019
02:02:47,403 --> 02:02:50,363
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1020
02:03:00,666 --> 02:03:06,462
General! General!

1021
02:03:08,507 --> 02:03:10,300
- General!
- Cicero!

1022
02:03:17,766 --> 02:03:19,267
- General!
- Where are you camped?

1023
02:03:19,351 --> 02:03:20,643
Ostia.

1024
02:03:27,109 --> 02:03:30,069
- We love you, Maximus!
- Praise the Victor!

1025
02:03:30,154 --> 02:03:32,655
Tell the men their general lives.
Find me.

1026
02:03:32,823 --> 02:03:34,616
- Move along!
- Find me!

1027
02:04:00,476 --> 02:04:02,435
Can they hear you?

1028
02:04:06,023 --> 02:04:09,525
- Who?
- Your family, in the afterlife.

1029
02:04:12,029 --> 02:04:14,364
- Yes.
- What do you say to them?

1030
02:04:18,243 --> 02:04:19,702
To my boy,

1031
02:04:21,538 --> 02:04:24,082
I tell him I will
see him again soon,

1032
02:04:24,166 --> 02:04:27,752
and to keep his heels down
when he's riding his horse.

1033
02:04:29,046 --> 02:04:30,546
To my wife,

1034
02:04:33,050 --> 02:04:35,176
that is not your business.

1035
02:04:42,851 --> 02:04:45,728
And now they love
Maximus for his mercy.

1036
02:04:47,106 --> 02:04:50,650
So I can't just kill him, or it
makes me even more unmerciful.

1037
02:04:51,986 --> 02:04:56,239
The whole thing is like
some great nightmare.

1038
02:04:57,491 --> 02:04:59,325
He is defying you.

1039
02:04:59,410 --> 02:05:02,787
His every victory is
an act of defiance.

1040
02:05:02,871 --> 02:05:06,457
The mob sees this, and
so do the Senate.

1041
02:05:07,251 --> 02:05:10,128
Every day he lives,
they grow bolder.

1042
02:05:11,672 --> 02:05:13,423
- Kill him.
- No.

1043
02:05:15,300 --> 02:05:17,760
I will not make a martyr of him.

1044
02:05:24,893 --> 02:05:27,353
When I went to the Senate today,

1045
02:05:27,438 --> 02:05:31,899
I purposefully told them about using the
grain reserves to pay for the games.

1046
02:05:33,819 --> 02:05:35,987
And did you note what happened?

1047
02:05:36,071 --> 02:05:39,282
- Nothing.
- Exactly. Nothing.

1048
02:05:40,284 --> 02:05:42,618
Not a single word of protest.

1049
02:05:42,703 --> 02:05:46,330
Even the insolent Senator
Gracchus was silent as a mouse.

1050
02:05:46,415 --> 02:05:47,582
Why?

1051
02:05:49,293 --> 02:05:53,004
I have been told of
a certain sea snake

1052
02:05:53,088 --> 02:05:57,133
which has a very unusual
method of attracting its prey.

1053
02:05:57,593 --> 02:06:01,304
It will lie at the bottom
of the ocean as if wounded.

1054
02:06:02,306 --> 02:06:04,640
Then its enemies will approach,

1055
02:06:04,725 --> 02:06:07,810
and yet it will lie quite still.

1056
02:06:08,145 --> 02:06:11,939
And then its enemies will
take little bites of it,

1057
02:06:12,024 --> 02:06:15,318
and yet it remains still.

1058
02:06:18,530 --> 02:06:19,697
So,

1059
02:06:21,033 --> 02:06:22,825
we will lie still,

1060
02:06:23,535 --> 02:06:26,871
and let our enemies
come to us and nibble.

1061
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:30,291
Have every senator followed.

1062
02:06:47,935 --> 02:06:49,685
Cicero, my old friend.

1063
02:06:49,770 --> 02:06:51,690
I thought perhaps I'd seen
you for the last time.

1064
02:06:51,730 --> 02:06:54,273
- I thought you were dead.
- Close.

1065
02:06:54,358 --> 02:06:55,983
How long have the
men been in Ostia?

1066
02:06:56,068 --> 02:06:57,401
All winter.

1067
02:06:57,736 --> 02:07:01,030
- And how do they look?
- Fat and bored.

1068
02:07:01,740 --> 02:07:04,784
- Who's in command?
- Some fool from Rome.

1069
02:07:06,411 --> 02:07:08,246
How soon do you think they
could be ready to fight?

1070
02:07:08,330 --> 02:07:10,123
For you, tomorrow.

1071
02:07:11,583 --> 02:07:14,085
I need you to do
something for me.

1072
02:07:18,715 --> 02:07:20,133
Come, see, witness.

1073
02:07:20,217 --> 02:07:23,261
If you haven't been in the arena,
you can see the show here.

1074
02:07:23,345 --> 02:07:26,973
Giant Maximus is defeating
our emperor, Commodus.

1075
02:07:27,057 --> 02:07:29,684
What are we to do? He's
just defying everyone,

1076
02:07:29,768 --> 02:07:31,435
by doing this to him, they do...

1077
02:07:32,688 --> 02:07:34,021
My goodness!

1078
02:07:35,816 --> 02:07:39,402
- He got him, he's defeated.
- Give way!

1079
02:07:45,492 --> 02:07:48,077
My lady? I served your
father at Vindobona.

1080
02:07:48,162 --> 02:07:49,704
- Back.
- My lady.

1081
02:07:49,788 --> 02:07:52,206
I served your
father at Vindobona.

1082
02:07:52,291 --> 02:07:53,374
Back!

1083
02:07:53,458 --> 02:07:56,669
And I served General Maximus.
I serve him still.

1084
02:07:58,172 --> 02:07:59,755
Stop. Stop.

1085
02:08:00,299 --> 02:08:01,465
Stop!

1086
02:08:02,384 --> 02:08:03,801
Stand back.

1087
02:08:05,095 --> 02:08:08,139
The general sends word, he
will meet your politician.

1088
02:08:09,850 --> 02:08:13,144
- For your loyalty, soldier.
- Thank you, my lady.

1089
02:08:22,905 --> 02:08:24,238
Leave us.

1090
02:08:29,953 --> 02:08:31,662
Senator Gracchus.

1091
02:08:45,469 --> 02:08:46,761
General.

1092
02:08:47,846 --> 02:08:50,598
I hope my coming here
today is evidence enough

1093
02:08:50,682 --> 02:08:53,768
that you can trust me.

1094
02:08:58,065 --> 02:09:00,524
- The Senate is with you?
- The Senate?

1095
02:09:02,027 --> 02:09:04,737
Yes. I can speak for them.

1096
02:09:05,364 --> 02:09:08,699
You can buy my freedom and
smuggle me out of Rome?

1097
02:09:09,076 --> 02:09:10,534
To what end?

1098
02:09:11,995 --> 02:09:14,330
Get me outside the city walls.

1099
02:09:14,915 --> 02:09:18,793
Have fresh horses ready to take me
to Ostia. My army is encamped there.

1100
02:09:18,877 --> 02:09:22,213
By nightfall of the second day, I shall
return at the head of 5,000 men.

1101
02:09:22,297 --> 02:09:24,548
But the legions all
have new commanders,

1102
02:09:24,633 --> 02:09:26,050
loyal to Commodus.

1103
02:09:26,134 --> 02:09:29,303
Let my men see me alive, and you
shall see where their loyalties lie.

1104
02:09:29,388 --> 02:09:31,055
This is madness.

1105
02:09:31,723 --> 02:09:35,059
No Roman army has entered
the capital in 100 years.

1106
02:09:35,143 --> 02:09:37,395
I will not trade one
dictatorship for another!

1107
02:09:37,479 --> 02:09:41,023
The time for half measures
and talk is over, Senator.

1108
02:09:41,566 --> 02:09:44,652
And after your glorious
coup, what then?

1109
02:09:45,862 --> 02:09:49,490
You'll take your 5,000
warriors and leave?

1110
02:09:49,574 --> 02:09:51,117
I will leave.

1111
02:09:51,618 --> 02:09:53,661
The soldiers will stay
for your protection,

1112
02:09:53,745 --> 02:09:55,413
under the command of the Senate.

1113
02:09:55,539 --> 02:09:56,706
So,

1114
02:09:57,040 --> 02:10:01,252
once all of Rome is yours, you'll
just give it back to the people?

1115
02:10:02,629 --> 02:10:03,629
Tell me why.

1116
02:10:09,761 --> 02:10:12,930
Because that was the last
wish of a dying man.

1117
02:10:15,976 --> 02:10:17,852
I will kill Commodus.

1118
02:10:19,771 --> 02:10:22,857
The fate of Rome I leave to you.

1119
02:10:24,609 --> 02:10:26,902
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1120
02:10:28,739 --> 02:10:30,781
His daughter trusts you.

1121
02:10:34,786 --> 02:10:36,454
I will trust you.

1122
02:10:36,872 --> 02:10:38,914
But we have little time.

1123
02:10:39,458 --> 02:10:41,208
Give me two days,

1124
02:10:42,002 --> 02:10:44,253
and I will buy your freedom.

1125
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:46,213
And you,

1126
02:10:47,758 --> 02:10:49,342
you stay alive,

1127
02:10:50,844 --> 02:10:52,511
or I'll be dead.

1128
02:10:54,473 --> 02:10:56,057
Now we must go.

1129
02:11:23,126 --> 02:11:26,712
He'll be waiting for you.
Stand at the foot of the colossus.

1130
02:11:26,797 --> 02:11:28,381
He'll find you.

1131
02:12:12,551 --> 02:12:14,009
It won't work.

1132
02:12:14,970 --> 02:12:17,096
The Emperor knows too much.

1133
02:12:17,848 --> 02:12:18,848
And as for me,

1134
02:12:21,184 --> 02:12:23,227
it's becoming dangerous.

1135
02:12:24,521 --> 02:12:26,772
You'll be paid on my return.

1136
02:12:28,859 --> 02:12:30,651
I give you my word.

1137
02:12:30,902 --> 02:12:33,988
Your word? What if
you don't return?

1138
02:12:35,240 --> 02:12:38,200
Do you remember what it was
to have trust, Proximo?

1139
02:12:38,285 --> 02:12:39,535
Trust?

1140
02:12:43,790 --> 02:12:45,541
Who am I to trust?

1141
02:12:46,126 --> 02:12:49,295
- I will kill Commodus.
- Why would I want that?

1142
02:12:50,088 --> 02:12:51,797
He makes me rich.

1143
02:12:56,928 --> 02:12:59,763
I know that you are a man
of your word, General.

1144
02:13:01,516 --> 02:13:04,101
I know that you would
die for honor.

1145
02:13:05,437 --> 02:13:07,396
You would die for Rome.

1146
02:13:08,440 --> 02:13:11,567
You would die for the
memory of your ancestors.

1147
02:13:11,651 --> 02:13:13,944
But I, on the other hand,

1148
02:13:16,656 --> 02:13:18,491
I'm an entertainer.

1149
02:13:21,995 --> 02:13:23,204
Guard!

1150
02:13:28,043 --> 02:13:30,628
He killed the man
who set you free.

1151
02:13:39,804 --> 02:13:41,639
Praetorians, master.

1152
02:13:47,812 --> 02:13:48,979
Halt!

1153
02:14:54,129 --> 02:14:55,921
Where have you been?

1154
02:14:56,381 --> 02:14:57,965
I sent for you.

1155
02:14:59,551 --> 02:15:01,218
Please, brother.

1156
02:15:06,975 --> 02:15:08,851
What's troubling you?

1157
02:15:11,271 --> 02:15:13,647
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

1158
02:15:15,442 --> 02:15:16,942
I don't know.

1159
02:15:18,945 --> 02:15:21,071
I thought you'd seen him.

1160
02:15:21,906 --> 02:15:24,408
He infects everyone
like a putrid fever.

1161
02:15:26,202 --> 02:15:29,413
For the health of Rome,
the Senate must be bled.

1162
02:15:29,831 --> 02:15:31,874
And he will bleed, too.

1163
02:15:32,751 --> 02:15:34,126
Very soon.

1164
02:15:35,629 --> 02:15:37,296
But not tonight.

1165
02:15:52,312 --> 02:15:55,230
Do you remember what
our father said once?

1166
02:15:56,566 --> 02:15:58,233
"It's a dream,"

1167
02:16:00,111 --> 02:16:02,029
"a frightful dream,"

1168
02:16:04,574 --> 02:16:05,908
"life is."

1169
02:16:08,620 --> 02:16:10,704
Do you think that's true?

1170
02:16:11,456 --> 02:16:12,956
I don't know.

1171
02:16:16,544 --> 02:16:18,087
I think it is.

1172
02:16:20,840 --> 02:16:23,592
And I have only you
to share it with.

1173
02:17:01,172 --> 02:17:02,798
Open your mouth.

1174
02:17:40,086 --> 02:17:41,879
You know I love you.

1175
02:17:43,965 --> 02:17:45,549
And I love you.

1176
02:18:22,212 --> 02:18:23,754
Out. Get out!

1177
02:18:24,964 --> 02:18:26,215
Move!

1178
02:18:30,887 --> 02:18:32,930
Congratulations, General.

1179
02:18:33,014 --> 02:18:35,808
You've got very
persuasive friends.

1180
02:18:41,815 --> 02:18:44,316
My brother has had
Gracchus arrested.

1181
02:18:44,400 --> 02:18:47,861
We daren't wait any longer.
We must leave tonight.

1182
02:18:47,946 --> 02:18:51,573
Proximo will come at midnight
and take you to the gate.

1183
02:18:52,242 --> 02:18:55,911
Your servant, Cicero, will be
waiting there with horses.

1184
02:18:57,914 --> 02:19:00,207
- You have done all this?
- Yes.

1185
02:19:01,417 --> 02:19:03,126
You risk too much.

1186
02:19:04,087 --> 02:19:06,088
I have much to pay for.

1187
02:19:08,508 --> 02:19:10,717
You have nothing to pay for.

1188
02:19:10,802 --> 02:19:13,887
You love your son.
You're strong for him.

1189
02:19:17,100 --> 02:19:19,434
I am tired of being strong.

1190
02:19:21,396 --> 02:19:25,607
My brother hates all the
world, and you most of all.

1191
02:19:26,109 --> 02:19:29,236
- Because your father chose me.
- No.

1192
02:19:30,530 --> 02:19:32,781
Because my father loved you.

1193
02:19:36,703 --> 02:19:39,121
And because I loved you.

1194
02:19:41,708 --> 02:19:43,375
A long time ago.

1195
02:19:48,131 --> 02:19:50,257
Was I very different then?

1196
02:19:56,806 --> 02:19:58,557
You laughed more.

1197
02:20:02,645 --> 02:20:05,063
I have felt alone all my life,

1198
02:20:06,357 --> 02:20:08,025
except with you.

1199
02:20:11,112 --> 02:20:12,487
I must go.

1200
02:20:13,156 --> 02:20:14,281
Yes.

1201
02:20:42,769 --> 02:20:43,977
There.

1202
02:20:55,531 --> 02:20:57,032
And I got you.

1203
02:21:00,078 --> 02:21:01,995
Isn't it late to be
playing legionnaire?

1204
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:04,164
I'm not a legionnaire.

1205
02:21:04,499 --> 02:21:07,084
- Not a legionnaire?
- I'm a gladiator.

1206
02:21:08,378 --> 02:21:09,836
A gladiator?

1207
02:21:10,546 --> 02:21:13,215
Gladiators only
fight in the games.

1208
02:21:13,299 --> 02:21:16,718
Wouldn't you rather be a great
Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?

1209
02:21:16,803 --> 02:21:19,388
I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!

1210
02:21:22,225 --> 02:21:24,059
The savior of Rome?

1211
02:21:32,068 --> 02:21:33,777
And who said that?

1212
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:44,204
Where's Lucius?

1213
02:21:45,415 --> 02:21:47,833
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

1214
02:21:50,753 --> 02:21:52,513
- She couldn't.
- Yes, she did.

1215
02:21:52,547 --> 02:21:54,756
She took it from a basket,

1216
02:21:56,175 --> 02:21:59,928
and pressed it to her breast,
right here above her heart.

1217
02:22:01,556 --> 02:22:04,766
- It bit her in the breast?
- Yes.

1218
02:22:05,435 --> 02:22:09,396
You see, Lucius,
sometimes royal ladies

1219
02:22:09,897 --> 02:22:13,859
behave very strangely and do very
odd things in the name of love.

1220
02:22:13,943 --> 02:22:16,528
- I think it's silly.
- So do I.

1221
02:22:18,614 --> 02:22:19,948
So do I.

1222
02:22:20,491 --> 02:22:22,576
Sister, join us.

1223
02:22:23,202 --> 02:22:24,953
I've been reading
to dear Lucius.

1224
02:22:25,038 --> 02:22:27,039
- I've been reading, too.
- Yes.

1225
02:22:27,123 --> 02:22:31,460
He's a very clever little boy. He'll
make a grand emperor one day.

1226
02:22:33,004 --> 02:22:35,422
We've been reading about
the great Mark Antony,

1227
02:22:35,506 --> 02:22:36,840
and his adventures in Egypt.

1228
02:22:36,924 --> 02:22:39,468
And the queen killed
herself with a snake.

1229
02:22:39,552 --> 02:22:42,888
And just wait until you hear
what happened to our ancestors.

1230
02:22:42,972 --> 02:22:44,806
If you're very good,

1231
02:22:44,891 --> 02:22:48,685
tomorrow night, I'll tell you
the story of Emperor Claudius.

1232
02:22:48,770 --> 02:22:50,479
He was betrayed

1233
02:22:51,689 --> 02:22:53,815
by those closest to him.

1234
02:22:55,693 --> 02:22:57,444
By his own blood.

1235
02:22:58,780 --> 02:23:01,239
They whispered in dark corners

1236
02:23:01,324 --> 02:23:03,784
and went out late at night,

1237
02:23:03,868 --> 02:23:07,204
and conspired, and conspired.

1238
02:23:09,832 --> 02:23:13,668
But the Emperor Claudius knew
that they were up to something.

1239
02:23:13,795 --> 02:23:16,338
He knew they were
busy little bees.

1240
02:23:18,299 --> 02:23:21,343
And one night he sat
down with one of them,

1241
02:23:22,136 --> 02:23:24,137
and he looked at her,

1242
02:23:24,889 --> 02:23:26,431
and he said,

1243
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:30,185
"Tell me what
you've been doing,"

1244
02:23:30,853 --> 02:23:32,562
"busy little bee."

1245
02:23:34,857 --> 02:23:37,943
"Or I shall strike down
those dearest to you."

1246
02:23:39,112 --> 02:23:42,155
"You shall watch as I
bathe in their blood."

1247
02:23:45,868 --> 02:23:48,286
And the Emperor was heartbroken.

1248
02:23:50,373 --> 02:23:52,582
The little bee had
wounded him more deeply

1249
02:23:52,667 --> 02:23:55,377
than anyone else could
ever have done.

1250
02:23:57,505 --> 02:24:00,382
What do you think
happened then, Lucius?

1251
02:24:01,008 --> 02:24:02,843
I don't know, Uncle.

1252
02:24:09,350 --> 02:24:11,935
The little bee told
him everything.

1253
02:25:09,827 --> 02:25:12,829
Open, in the
name of the Emperor!

1254
02:25:13,664 --> 02:25:14,956
Proximo!

1255
02:25:15,833 --> 02:25:18,960
Open the gates, in the
name of the Emperor!

1256
02:25:19,795 --> 02:25:21,129
Proximo!

1257
02:25:23,341 --> 02:25:24,799
Open the gates!

1258
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:32,933
Open the gates, Proximo.

1259
02:25:33,392 --> 02:25:35,644
Do you want to die, old man?

1260
02:25:36,854 --> 02:25:37,979
Here.

1261
02:25:38,564 --> 02:25:40,732
Everything is prepared.

1262
02:25:40,816 --> 02:25:43,276
It seems you have
won your freedom.

1263
02:25:43,361 --> 02:25:46,947
Proximo, are you in danger
of becoming a good man?

1264
02:25:52,036 --> 02:25:55,872
- Juba.
- All enemies of the Emperor die!

1265
02:25:56,415 --> 02:25:58,583
Open the gates!

1266
02:26:04,090 --> 02:26:06,049
Pull!

1267
02:26:08,177 --> 02:26:11,054
Move! Form a column on the left!

1268
02:26:14,850 --> 02:26:18,061
I only need moments, so do not
be careless with your lives.

1269
02:26:18,145 --> 02:26:20,605
If you don't want any part of
this, go back to your cells.

1270
02:26:20,690 --> 02:26:22,941
We'll wait here
for you, Maximus.

1271
02:26:23,025 --> 02:26:24,818
- Strength and honor.
- Strength and honor.

1272
02:26:24,902 --> 02:26:25,944
Go.

1273
02:26:26,821 --> 02:26:28,655
Strength and honor.

1274
02:26:31,284 --> 02:26:34,119
Aim. Arch your bows!

1275
02:27:41,228 --> 02:27:42,520
Shadows and dust.

1276
02:28:24,438 --> 02:28:25,688
Maximus!

1277
02:28:31,153 --> 02:28:32,570
I'm sorry.

1278
02:28:58,973 --> 02:29:00,348
It's done.

1279
02:29:07,314 --> 02:29:09,190
And what of my nephew?

1280
02:29:10,276 --> 02:29:12,277
And what of his mother?

1281
02:29:14,363 --> 02:29:16,906
Should they share
her lover's fate?

1282
02:29:18,617 --> 02:29:20,660
Or should I be merciful?

1283
02:29:23,372 --> 02:29:25,290
Commodus the Merciful.

1284
02:29:31,714 --> 02:29:34,048
Lucius will stay with me now.

1285
02:29:35,217 --> 02:29:37,010
And if his mother

1286
02:29:38,387 --> 02:29:40,513
so much as looks at me

1287
02:29:41,682 --> 02:29:44,184
in a manner that displeases me,

1288
02:29:46,145 --> 02:29:47,562
he will die.

1289
02:29:51,066 --> 02:29:54,319
If she decides to be noble,

1290
02:29:56,071 --> 02:29:58,156
and takes her own life,

1291
02:29:59,742 --> 02:30:01,201
he will die.

1292
02:30:04,830 --> 02:30:06,539
And as for you,

1293
02:30:09,335 --> 02:30:11,085
you will love me,

1294
02:30:11,921 --> 02:30:13,713
as I have loved you.

1295
02:30:15,299 --> 02:30:18,968
You will provide me with
an heir of pure blood,

1296
02:30:19,929 --> 02:30:21,763
so that Commodus

1297
02:30:22,348 --> 02:30:25,308
and his progeny will
rule for 1,000 years.

1298
02:30:29,939 --> 02:30:31,689
Am I not merciful?

1299
02:30:53,546 --> 02:30:56,172
Am I not merciful!

1300
02:31:08,394 --> 02:31:12,397
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1301
02:31:39,842 --> 02:31:42,594
I'm a soldier. I obey.

1302
02:31:45,347 --> 02:31:49,601
Nothing happens to anyone that he
is not fitted by nature to bear.

1303
02:32:22,551 --> 02:32:23,551
Maximus.

1304
02:32:30,225 --> 02:32:32,060
They call for you.

1305
02:32:34,021 --> 02:32:37,273
The general who became a slave.

1306
02:32:38,525 --> 02:32:40,902
The slave who
became a gladiator.

1307
02:32:42,279 --> 02:32:45,073
The gladiator who
defied an emperor.

1308
02:32:47,076 --> 02:32:48,743
A striking story.

1309
02:32:49,912 --> 02:32:53,122
Now the people want to
know how the story ends.

1310
02:32:55,501 --> 02:32:57,752
Only a famous death will do.

1311
02:32:59,672 --> 02:33:02,215
And what could be more glorious

1312
02:33:02,591 --> 02:33:06,344
than to challenge the Emperor
himself in the great arena?

1313
02:33:08,681 --> 02:33:11,724
- You would fight me?
- Why not?

1314
02:33:12,810 --> 02:33:14,852
Do you think I'm afraid?

1315
02:33:15,771 --> 02:33:18,815
I think you have been
afraid all your life.

1316
02:33:18,899 --> 02:33:22,610
Unlike Maximus the invincible,
who knows no fear?

1317
02:33:28,367 --> 02:33:31,744
I knew a man who once said,
"Death smiles at us all."

1318
02:33:32,621 --> 02:33:35,123
"All a man can do
is smile back."

1319
02:33:36,917 --> 02:33:38,334
I wonder,

1320
02:33:38,961 --> 02:33:41,754
did your friend smile
at his own death?

1321
02:33:42,131 --> 02:33:43,631
You must know.

1322
02:33:46,552 --> 02:33:48,344
He was your father.

1323
02:33:52,224 --> 02:33:54,559
You loved my father, I know,

1324
02:33:56,061 --> 02:33:57,562
but so did I.

1325
02:33:59,189 --> 02:34:01,774
That makes us
brothers, doesn't it?

1326
02:34:04,403 --> 02:34:05,987
Smile for me now, brother.

1327
02:34:12,035 --> 02:34:14,871
Strap on his armor.
Conceal the wound.

1328
02:35:09,301 --> 02:35:11,260
Ring formation!

1329
02:37:03,040 --> 02:37:04,665
Quintus, sword.

1330
02:37:06,168 --> 02:37:07,960
Give me your sword.

1331
02:37:11,381 --> 02:37:13,382
Sword! Give me a sword!

1332
02:37:14,885 --> 02:37:18,387
Sheathe your swords.
Sheathe your swords!

1333
02:39:33,857 --> 02:39:35,191
Maximus.

1334
02:39:40,572 --> 02:39:41,864
Maximus.

1335
02:39:42,449 --> 02:39:43,783
Quintus.

1336
02:39:45,452 --> 02:39:46,911
Free my men.

1337
02:39:48,288 --> 02:39:50,998
Senator Gracchus is
to be reinstated.

1338
02:39:52,292 --> 02:39:54,376
There was a dream that was Rome.

1339
02:39:55,045 --> 02:39:56,921
It shall be realized.

1340
02:39:57,464 --> 02:40:00,049
These are the wishes
of Marcus Aurelius.

1341
02:40:01,134 --> 02:40:03,135
Free the prisoners. Go!

1342
02:40:27,911 --> 02:40:29,245
Maximus.

1343
02:40:31,123 --> 02:40:32,706
Lucius is safe.

1344
02:40:49,015 --> 02:40:50,432
Go to them.

1345
02:41:40,233 --> 02:41:41,650
You're home.

1346
02:42:08,303 --> 02:42:10,846
Is Rome worth one
good man's life?

1347
02:42:14,726 --> 02:42:16,518
We believed it once.

1348
02:42:19,731 --> 02:42:21,857
Make us believe it again.

1349
02:42:25,362 --> 02:42:27,446
He was a soldier of Rome.

1350
02:42:31,284 --> 02:42:32,701
Honor him.

1351
02:42:33,161 --> 02:42:35,329
Who will help me carry him?

1352
02:43:20,083 --> 02:43:21,750
Now we are free.

1353
02:43:28,133 --> 02:43:30,009
I will see you again.

1354
02:43:32,887 --> 02:43:34,346
But not yet.

1355
02:43:35,348 --> 02:43:36,348
Not yet.
