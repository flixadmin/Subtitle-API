1
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,322
Hey, Brennan.

2
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:17,118
Mom, I'm watching the thing
with the lady.

3
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,203
I'm leaving. Okay? Be home around 11.

4
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,998
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Brennan.

5
00:01:22,164 --> 00:01:26,335
Let's slowly get those hips up.
Good. Now, hold it right here. Great.

6
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:35,219
Dale. Dale, I'm leaving
for the conference.

7
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:38,806
- You leave me money for pizza, Dad?
- There's $20 on the hall table.

8
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,225
Do not order pay-per-view, buddy.

9
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,061
- What if I want wings?
- You don't need wings.

10
00:01:44,228 --> 00:01:45,605
That's not enough, Dad!

11
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:47,398
The RTI cochlear implant...

12
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,192
...is the state-of-the-art
implantable hearing device...

13
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:54,488
...due to its input processing of sound
via the speech processor.

14
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:57,408
But the most exciting new development...

15
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:01,495
...is the external processor
which fits directly over the ear...

16
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:05,750
...which eliminates the need to put
your face between those breasts.

17
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:12,840
I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm so lost.
And this never happens to me.

18
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,512
My name is Robert,
and I play racquetball. I collect coins.

19
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:20,431
Sweet Jesus! I love Korean food.

20
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,392
I am Nancy Huff.
I know how to make tandoori chicken...

21
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:25,686
...I contribute to NPR every year...

22
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:27,855
...and I love the movies of Rob Reiner.

23
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,107
Pilates changed my life.

24
00:02:30,274 --> 00:02:33,736
I have a boat, and I wanna retire
and sail around the world.

25
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,238
- I love the sea!
- I drive a Mercedes...

26
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:39,283
...and I have a 40-year-old son, Dale,
who lives at home.

27
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,620
- What did you just say?
- I knew I shouldn't have told you that.

28
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,705
I have a 39-year-old son
named Brennan...

29
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:47,416
...who still lives at home with me.

30
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,970
I would like to thank all of you...

31
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:04,350
...for being here with us
on this fantastic, wonderful day.

32
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,728
And I would like to raise my glass.

33
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:11,774
Dale and I wanna welcome you
to our home with open arms.

34
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,570
- Get a room, Dad.
- Oh, for chri... Dale!

35
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:21,283
Well, as you all know, my youngest son,
Derek, couldn't be here...

36
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,828
...because of an important fishing trip.

37
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:29,083
But my other son, Brennan, was going
to be moving into his own place...

38
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,586
...but he was recently let go
from his job at PetSmart...

39
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:36,590
...so he is gonna be living with us.

40
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:39,885
I wasn't fired from my job, I was laid off!

41
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:42,346
But you wouldn't know the difference.

42
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:47,101
I didn't want salmon!
I said it four times.

43
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,939
This wedding is horseshit.

44
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,572
Somebody's awfully quiet back there.

45
00:04:00,364 --> 00:04:02,533
I'm not gonna call him Dad.

46
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:07,037
Brennan, you're 39 years old.
I would not expect you to call him Dad.

47
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:11,876
Well, I'm not going to, ever.
Even if there's a fire.

48
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:15,546
Robert better not get in my face...

49
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:18,382
...because I'll drop that motherfucker.

50
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,925
Jesus, Brennan.

51
00:04:20,092 --> 00:04:24,263
I'm just saying,
I think you gotta think about your options.

52
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,308
I know that you are technically
married now...

53
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:31,145
...but that does not mean
that they have to live here.

54
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:36,484
Dale, I think it's time for a change
for both of us.

55
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,404
Dad, we're men, okay?

56
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,073
That means a few things.

57
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,911
We like to shit with the door open.
We talk about pussy.

58
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:50,456
We go on riverboat-gambling trips.
We make our own beef jerky.

59
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,876
That's what we do.
And now that is all wrecked.

60
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:57,713
We literally have never done
any of those things.

61
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,216
Where did he go to medical school?

62
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:02,843
He went to Northwestern
and Johns Hopkins.

63
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,388
- Is that good enough for you?
- No, it's not.

64
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:10,351
Well, Brennan, those are
very prestigious schools.

65
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,395
I smoked pot with Johnny Hopkins.

66
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:16,106
You don't know anyone
named Johnny Hopkins.

67
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:19,235
It was Johnny Hopkins
and Sloan Kettering...

68
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:22,238
...and they were blazing
that shit up every day.

69
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:25,783
All right, here's a scenario for you, Dad.

70
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,285
Suppose Nancy sees me
coming out of the shower...

71
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:31,372
...and decides to come on to me.
I'm looking good.

72
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,749
I've got a luscious V of hair...

73
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,294
...going from my chest pubes
down to my ball-fro.

74
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:40,214
And she takes one look at me,
and she goes:

75
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,799
"Oh, my God.

76
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:46,136
I've had the old bull,
now I want the young calf."

77
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:49,849
- And she grabs me by the wiener.
- Shut the fuck up!

78
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,947
- Come on, Brennan.
- I'm fine here.

79
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,660
- There you are.
- Hi.

80
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,663
Oh, you look so cute
in your moving clothes.

81
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,498
- How was it?
- It was easy.

82
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,709
The movers did everything.

83
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,213
Where's Brennan?

84
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:24,425
He's still in the car.

85
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:28,387
- It was kind of a rough drive.
- Robert, what's all the commotion?

86
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,223
- Hey, Don.
- Is that your wife, Nancy?

87
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,851
- Right here, Don.
- Can I come over this afternoon...

88
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,853
- ...and touch your face?
- Sure.

89
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,480
- Thanks. Good luck, guys.
- We'll see you, Don.

90
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:41,400
Let's go, Cinnamon. Heel, Cinnamon.

91
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,778
Heel! Cinnamon!

92
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,448
Cinnamon!

93
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,325
Hi, Dale.

94
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:52,161
Hey, Nancy. Could you make me
a grilled-cheese sandwich?

95
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,871
- Sure.
- No.

96
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,249
Dale just ate. He's testing you to see
how much he can get away with.

97
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,126
- I see.
- I'm hungry.

98
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,836
Look in your right hand.

99
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,380
- I don't mind a bit. I really don't.
- No.

100
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:05,633
No, no. He's fine.

101
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:30,991
Hey.

102
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,785
Hey.

103
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,536
I'm Brennan.

104
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,664
I'm Dale.

105
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,874
But you have to call me Dragon.

106
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:42,586
You have to call me Nighthawk.

107
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:03,941
Brennan.

108
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,444
Don't do that.

109
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:18,372
Now, that's enough ketchup.
Come on. Dale.

110
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,667
- I like it.
- That's enough.

111
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,919
Dale, I don't know if you...

112
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:28,966
You might wanna try this. I make
a sauce, we call it "fancy sauce"...

113
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,634
For me.

114
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:34,471
...That Brennan really likes
with his chicken nuggets.

115
00:08:34,638 --> 00:08:35,931
It's my fancy sauce.

116
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:41,311
Well, when Brennan finishes,
I'll give you some of this, and it's...

117
00:08:41,478 --> 00:08:44,732
It's ketchup and mayonnaise
mixed together, so...

118
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:46,692
It's so good.

119
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,736
- I want some fancy sauce.
- Yeah.

120
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:50,946
- I'm not done using it.
- Looks good.

121
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,949
- Can I have fancy sauce?
- Of course. Of course.

122
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,160
- I'm using it right now.
- Okay.

123
00:08:56,326 --> 00:08:59,121
- So let him try some.
- You wanna try it, Dale?

124
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,540
Yeah, I really would like some.

125
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,042
One last spoonful.

126
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:06,670
I think you've got enough there, Brennan.

127
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,006
- So here you go.
- Thanks.

128
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,507
It's ketchup and mayonnaise.

129
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,803
- I don't like it. It smells weird.
- Okay.

130
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,388
- I'll try some.
- You want some?

131
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:17,848
- Sure.
- Okay.

132
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,642
You don't mind, do you, Brennan?
No. Okay.

133
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,730
- Brennan...
- I'm not comfortable...

134
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,107
It's okay. It's probably not good on fish.

135
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:30,194
But my dad's king of the castle,
so if he wants fancy sauce...

136
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,905
- No, it's all right, Dale.
- He can make his own batch.

137
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,281
So you know what?

138
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:39,369
Today, when you were driving around,
Dale was telling me that he's really...

139
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:43,874
...into kung fu, and I was telling him
that you're into kung fu as well.

140
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:48,003
I have a green belt.

141
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:49,880
Read it and weep.

142
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,924
I don't believe in belts.

143
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,510
There should be no ranking system
for toughness.

144
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:57,971
But one time I wrestled a giraffe
to the ground with my bare hands.

145
00:09:58,138 --> 00:10:00,766
That's not true, Dale. Don't be ridiculous.

146
00:10:02,017 --> 00:10:05,062
So, Dale, what have you been
working on recently?

147
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,688
Well...

148
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,067
...I manage a baseball team.

149
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,612
- Little League?
- Fantasy league.

150
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,914
Take a picture. It'll last longer.

151
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:27,084
Why don't you stop being
so confrontational, Dale?

152
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:31,088
- I'm not the one staring at me.
- So, Brennan, how about you?

153
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:35,008
I know you used to work at PetSmart.

154
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,512
- That's right, Mr. Doback.
- Call me Robert.

155
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,182
- That's right, Robin.
- Robert.

156
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:43,851
Robin.

157
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:49,189
Actually, Brennan is
a really talented person.

158
00:10:49,356 --> 00:10:51,441
He's a very gifted singer.

159
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:54,611
- I'm really, really good.
- How good?

160
00:10:55,904 --> 00:10:59,241
I've been called
the songbird of my generation...

161
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,535
...by people who've heard me.

162
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:02,744
That good.

163
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:05,289
The only trick is is that Brennan's...

164
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,752
...particular about
who he sings in front of, so...

165
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:14,506
I'm his mom, for example,
I've only heard him sing twice.

166
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:17,217
That's funny that you say that
because I can sing too.

167
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:19,052
I'll sing right now.

168
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:22,347
If you wanna get down
On these hairy balls

169
00:11:22,514 --> 00:11:24,850
- Hey!
- Why don't you jump right in?

170
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,810
It's a crotch party right up in here

171
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,229
- Stop it!
- Why don't you lick on this big joint?

172
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:32,149
Stop it, Dale! Stop it! Stop it!

173
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,611
That's cute.
I remember when I had my first beer.

174
00:11:35,777 --> 00:11:38,071
That's so funny,
the last time I heard that...

175
00:11:38,238 --> 00:11:40,282
...I laughed so hard
I fell off my dinosaur.

176
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,243
Stop right now. All right?
Let's just back off.

177
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:46,955
All right. Brennan, it's okay. It's okay.

178
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,832
Hey, hey.

179
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,210
- Great, Dale.
- He said a mean thing first.

180
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:53,754
Look, you know what...? Hey, guys.

181
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,007
Okay, sleeping arrangements.
It's gonna be different...

182
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,761
...but because Dale refuses
to give up his office drum set...

183
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,349
...that means that, Brennan,
you and Dale have to share a room.

184
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:08,477
- It's just temporary.
- Mom, we didn't talk about this.

185
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:12,147
Well, it's gonna be an exciting adventure.

186
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:16,443
You wanna show him the room, Dale?
Show him where he can put his stuff?

187
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:21,073
- That's nice, thank you.
- Good night, Nancy.

188
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,744
Hey, listen, I like to have
a lot of fresh fruit around...

189
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,664
...and chocolate chips
in my pancakes. Okay?

190
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,208
- Write it so you don't forget.
- Show him the room.

191
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:34,044
She's Mom now, so...

192
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,129
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, Brennan.

193
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,968
- Good night, Mr. Doback.
- Good night, Brennan.

194
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,104
So just a few basic rules
about the house.

195
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,189
If there's any foods that you like...

196
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,734
...put your name on them,
or they will be thrown out.

197
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:59,486
By me.

198
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:03,407
House was built in 1825
by General Custer.

199
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:05,784
I wanna show you this room.

200
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,036
Hold up.

201
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,747
- You see this room?
- Yeah.

202
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:12,749
Okay, here's the deal.

203
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:17,129
This is my office and my beat laboratory.

204
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,797
Okay?

205
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,008
This is the one rule of the house:

206
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:24,803
Don't ever, ever, ever...

207
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,556
...touch my drum set.

208
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,558
- Understand?
- Don't go in there...

209
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,810
- No touching!
- All right!

210
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,271
There. I was at about six there.

211
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,398
You don't wanna see me go to 10.

212
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,984
Get your shit. We're going to my room.

213
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,243
Honey?

214
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:52,914
I found a chain of islands
that we can sail to after New Zealand.

215
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:55,000
That's wonderful.

216
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:59,129
You know, I've been meaning
to ask you...

217
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,721
Why is it that Dale never left?

218
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:12,642
Well, Dale has always coasted off
my accomplishments.

219
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:14,811
He left college his junior year...

220
00:14:14,978 --> 00:14:17,689
...because he said he wanted
to join the family business.

221
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:21,651
- But you're a medical doctor.
- Believe me, I've told him that.

222
00:14:21,818 --> 00:14:25,364
But he just always says,
"It's all about who you know."

223
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,908
I don't know
where he got a sense of entitlement.

224
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:31,119
Maybe it was his mother passing.
What about Brennan?

225
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:32,913
From what you've told me...

226
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,540
...his younger brother Derek's been
quite successful.

227
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:39,044
When his father and I split,
that was difficult for him.

228
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:44,800
And this one time, when Brennan
was 17 and Derek was 14...

229
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:47,844
...and Brennan decided
to enter a talent show.

230
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,891
He sang a song
from an old pirate musical.

231
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:57,979
But Derek got his football buddies
to replace the choir and sing:

232
00:14:58,146 --> 00:15:00,023
"Brennan has a mangina."

233
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,652
Brennan has a mangina
Brennan has a mangina

234
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:10,367
Finally, the audience and even some
of the nastier parents started singing:

235
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,160
"Brennan has a mangina."

236
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,623
And I have to admit, for a little while,
I joined in as well.

237
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:21,002
From that day on,
Brennan never sang again.

238
00:15:21,169 --> 00:15:25,006
Derek went on to win the contest
by lip-synching "Ice Ice Baby."

239
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:32,389
- Oh, that's a great song.
- It is.

240
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,310
Hey, are you awake?

241
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:39,187
Yeah.

242
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:47,195
I just want you to know I hate you.
And so does my dad.

243
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:50,574
Well, that's fine.

244
00:15:51,908 --> 00:15:53,577
Because guess what.

245
00:15:53,743 --> 00:15:55,912
I hate you too.

246
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,458
And this house sucks ass.

247
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:01,710
The only reason you're living here...

248
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:05,505
...is because me and my dad decided
your mom was really hot...

249
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:08,216
...and maybe we should
just both bang her.

250
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:10,677
And we'll put up with the retard
in the meantime.

251
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:13,680
- Who's the retard?
- You.

252
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,600
- Hey, y'all don't say that.
- Shut up.

253
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:18,852
You'll wake up my dad
and get me grounded.

254
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,937
Just shut up.

255
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:23,815
You and your mom are hillbillies.

256
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:28,945
- This is a house of learned doctors.
- You're not a doctor.

257
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:31,948
You're a big, fat, curly-headed fuck.

258
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:35,494
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

259
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,579
- I'm a curly-headed fuck?
- Yeah.

260
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,331
Better not go to sleep.

261
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,251
As soon as your eyes shut,
I'm gonna punch you in the face.

262
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:45,754
I hope you stay still when you sleep...

263
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,965
...because I'm putting a rat trap
between your legs.

264
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:53,345
I'm gonna take a pillowcase
and fill it full of bars of soap...

265
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,055
...and beat the shit out of you.

266
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,436
I want you out of my fucking house.

267
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,648
No way, kemosabe.

268
00:17:04,814 --> 00:17:07,400
This is my house now.

269
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:12,113
How do you like The Gilded Lady?

270
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,324
I wish we could retire right now.

271
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,451
Won't be long.

272
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,297
Oh, God! It's cold!

273
00:17:30,465 --> 00:17:33,134
Hey! Is anyone listening? Help!

274
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,058
Fuck you, Dale! Fuck you!

275
00:18:22,225 --> 00:18:24,019
...Obviously you guys are hot.

276
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:27,188
Just revealed her cover.
I was like, "Wow, this is hot."

277
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:30,609
A little girl-on-girl.
A little heaven, a little hell.

278
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:35,572
- Hey.
- Hey.

279
00:18:37,907 --> 00:18:40,994
- Why you so sweaty?
- I was watching Cops.

280
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,496
Not supposed to have
your feet on the couch.

281
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:11,149
Hey, man. Did you touch my drum set?

282
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:15,612
- Nope.
- It's just weird...

283
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:20,241
...because seems like someone
definitely touched my drum set.

284
00:19:20,408 --> 00:19:23,453
Yeah, that is weird.
Because I didn't touch them.

285
00:19:23,953 --> 00:19:27,165
- Hey! Did you touch my drum set?
- Hey, knock it off!

286
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,086
I know you touched my drumstick
because the left one has a chip in it.

287
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,797
You fucking crazy, man?

288
00:19:33,963 --> 00:19:37,926
You sound insane, do you realize that?
You should be medicated.

289
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,387
Fuck you, Brennan!
You touched my drum set.

290
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:42,430
I wanna hear that dirty mouth admit it.

291
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:45,517
You get out of my face,
or I'm gonna roundhouse your ass.

292
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,186
You swear on your mom's life
that you didn't touch it!

293
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,396
I don't swear to shit!

294
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:51,731
Because you fucking touched
my drum set...

295
00:19:51,898 --> 00:19:53,942
...because I know
Cops doesn't start till 4.

296
00:19:57,028 --> 00:20:00,198
- Where are you going?
- I'm going upstairs.

297
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:04,119
Because I'm gonna put my nut sack
on your drum set. Okay?

298
00:20:04,285 --> 00:20:07,497
Don't you do that.
I am warning you right now:

299
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:12,252
If you touch my drums,
I will stab you in the neck with a knife!

300
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,798
If you even go in the room,
I will go ape-shit, you hear me?

301
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,633
Don't wanna miss a spot.

302
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,010
John Bonham's playing "Moby Dick"
for real!

303
00:20:21,177 --> 00:20:23,722
I swear to God. I swear to God! No!

304
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,524
I warned you.

305
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:37,736
There's one rule in the house
and you broke it!

306
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,539
I didn't touch your drum set!

307
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,586
I'm pre-diabetic!

308
00:20:59,924 --> 00:21:03,511
You fucker! I'm gonna rub my balls
on your mom's face!

309
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,598
Come back here!

310
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:15,064
I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you!
You son of a bitch.

311
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,692
Your drum set's a whore!

312
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,069
I teabagged your fucking drum set!

313
00:21:20,236 --> 00:21:23,740
My drum set's a guy,
so that makes you gay, you fucker!

314
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,242
I'll kill you!

315
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,162
I think it's gonna go generic soon, okay?

316
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,456
- Line three.
- Oh, thanks, Miles.

317
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,124
Yeah.

318
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,212
Jules? Wait, what's wrong?

319
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:43,384
- Back!
- You touched my drum set, you fucker!

320
00:21:44,427 --> 00:21:47,138
Stop it! Stop it!

321
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:50,725
- Rape! Rape! Rape!
- Stop it! Stop! Stop.

322
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,603
- Stay out of this, Nancy!
- Stop it, you guys.

323
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,814
- You're hurting him!
- No, Nancy!

324
00:21:56,564 --> 00:21:59,067
Cinnamon! Stop it!

325
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:03,071
My mom is being eaten by a dog,
there's nothing I can do!

326
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,823
- No, a story has a...
- Excuse me.

327
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:08,451
- Dr. Doback, the phone's for you.
- Hello?

328
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,995
Robert, they're like animals!
I can't stop them!

329
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:13,790
Stop screaming. Please. I'm on my way.

330
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,125
There seems to be
some savage fight going on...

331
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:18,670
...between my son and stepson, so I...

332
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,631
Family issues, huh?

333
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:25,844
I don't believe in talking about people's
personal lives behind their back.

334
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,263
You know nobody likes you, right?

335
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:32,183
Rape! Rape! Rape!

336
00:22:36,145 --> 00:22:37,272
What's going on?

337
00:22:37,438 --> 00:22:39,691
Robert! They won't... They won't...

338
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,860
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Dale, what...?

339
00:22:42,026 --> 00:22:43,903
- Stay out of it, Dad!
- Stop it!

340
00:22:52,328 --> 00:22:54,998
What the fucking fuck?

341
00:22:59,085 --> 00:23:01,170
Someone got some air. Snap.

342
00:23:01,921 --> 00:23:03,548
- I still hate you.
- Still hate you.

343
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,802
- Such raw power.
- What are you doing? It's Shark Week.

344
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,095
Here's the deal:

345
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:13,016
Number one, you will fix
the fucking drywall now.

346
00:23:13,182 --> 00:23:16,436
Two, you have one month to find jobs
or you're out on your asses.

347
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:19,355
I will arrange interviews for Monday,
and you will go!

348
00:23:19,522 --> 00:23:23,359
Dad, why are you talking to me like this?
I'm your son.

349
00:23:23,526 --> 00:23:24,986
I'm not buying that crap!

350
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:29,032
Today I saw my own son use
a bicycle as a weapon.

351
00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:31,951
You yelled "rape"
at the top of your lungs.

352
00:23:32,118 --> 00:23:36,414
Mom, I honestly thought
I was gonna be raped for a second.

353
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,083
He had the craziest look in his eyes.

354
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,753
At one point he said, "Let's get it on."

355
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,006
That was about the fighting.
I'm so not a raper.

356
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,925
I didn't touch your drum set.

357
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:52,263
I witnessed with my eyes
your testicles touching my drum set.

358
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,016
All right, that's it! That's it!

359
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,101
You two guys leave me no choice.

360
00:23:57,268 --> 00:23:58,895
No television for a week.

361
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,104
- What?!
- What?!

362
00:24:00,271 --> 00:24:02,482
- We are so serious.
- You're fucking high!

363
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,900
Are you out of your mind?!

364
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,861
This goes in Robert's wall safe
and it's gonna stay there.

365
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,905
- No!
- Okay.

366
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:12,700
- This house is a fucking prison!
- On planet Bullshit!

367
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:16,120
In the galaxy of This Sucks Camel Dicks!

368
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:49,696
Hi! Aunt Carol. Aunt Carol.

369
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:55,034
- Hey.
- You can't catch me.

370
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,165
I gotcha.

371
00:25:01,332 --> 00:25:02,834
I gotcha.

372
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,466
Aunt Carol's on fire!

373
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,277
I don't know where you learned it.

374
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,196
- Well, there's lots more where that...
- My God.

375
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:35,867
- Oh, no. What happened?
- What the...?

376
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,910
Oh, my God.

377
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:42,165
Maybe Dale left the back door open
and raccoons got in.

378
00:25:42,331 --> 00:25:44,667
Is this your purse in the freezer?

379
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,754
Yes. It's Brennan.

380
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,382
He sleepwalks and he always puts
my purse in the freezer.

381
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,217
Dale sleepwalks too.

382
00:25:53,384 --> 00:25:55,762
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm not. Look in the oven.

383
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,099
- What's in the...? Couch pillows?
- Couch pillows.

384
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:01,684
Yeah, Dale.

385
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,854
Come on.

386
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:07,940
- It's okay.
- It's really hard.

387
00:26:08,107 --> 00:26:09,233
It's gonna be fine.

388
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,904
They're gonna get jobs,
they'll be gone in a month. A month.

389
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:20,620
Guys.

390
00:26:22,997 --> 00:26:25,875
- Guys. Guys!
- I'll kill you, Leonard Nimoy.

391
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,044
The clown has no penis.

392
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,797
What kind of dreams
are you guys having?

393
00:26:30,963 --> 00:26:32,590
Hey, it's 12:30.

394
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,384
Brennan, your brother's coming today,
so get up.

395
00:26:35,551 --> 00:26:36,969
- Today?
- Yep.

396
00:26:37,136 --> 00:26:40,431
- Shit.
- What's your problem?

397
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:43,351
My little brother's a bigger asshole
than you are.

398
00:26:43,976 --> 00:26:46,437
Let's nail it this time. Here we go.

399
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:51,067
A one, a two, a one, two, three, four.

400
00:27:10,419 --> 00:27:13,756
All right, Tommy, you're the oldest.
I'm counting on you.

401
00:27:25,768 --> 00:27:29,397
Nice vibrato, buddy.
All right, Alice, let's go.

402
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,401
Flat. It's so flat.

403
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,445
You don't even look good
while you're singing.

404
00:27:36,612 --> 00:27:38,364
The worst thing I've ever heard.

405
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:41,784
This is $1200 a week for voice lessons,
and this is what I get?

406
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,536
I'm gonna save it with this solo.

407
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,123
I'm Derek

408
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:51,878
And I can sing high like this

409
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,756
And I can sing high

410
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:00,303
Jesus!

411
00:28:14,775 --> 00:28:18,029
We were so sad you guys
couldn't come to the wedding.

412
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,864
- We completely understand.
- Yeah.

413
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,908
You were busy fishing with Mark Cuban.

414
00:28:22,074 --> 00:28:24,076
Yeah, yeah.
Well, not just the Cubes...

415
00:28:24,243 --> 00:28:27,622
...but we had Chris Daughtry,
Jeff Probst, super-chef Bobby Flay.

416
00:28:27,788 --> 00:28:29,874
It was insane. It was almost too much.

417
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,375
My God, that's impressive.

418
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:33,878
Yeah, we were down in the Gulf,
fishing bonito.

419
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,006
Robert, have you ever been down
to the Gulf on the bonito run?

420
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,008
Always wanted to. I hear it's amazing.

421
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,636
- It's gorgeous.
- Are bonito fish big?

422
00:28:43,137 --> 00:28:44,180
What?

423
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,349
Don't interrupt when he's telling a story.

424
00:28:46,515 --> 00:28:48,976
- It's fine, Robert.
- I was asking about the story.

425
00:28:49,143 --> 00:28:52,188
- What's this guy's deal?
- I don't know. It's okay.

426
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:55,942
Well, Dale, they are
what's called a trophy fish.

427
00:28:56,108 --> 00:28:59,779
So, yeah, they're pretty big.

428
00:29:00,112 --> 00:29:01,364
I'm sorry.

429
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,534
Anyway...

430
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,913
Oh, God, I'm sorry,
I forget where my story was going.

431
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,289
Damn it, Dale.

432
00:29:10,456 --> 00:29:11,666
- No...
- Robert.

433
00:29:11,832 --> 00:29:13,042
- What?
- What? I asked him.

434
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,920
No, he can join in, Robert.
It's really okay.

435
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,964
I asked him twice not to interrupt.

436
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:21,926
Don't be mad at Dale for ruining
the story. And possibly the evening.

437
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,220
It's totally fine.
I have a lot more stories.

438
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:27,723
- Derek, that you do. That you do.
- Yeah.

439
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:31,435
- Guilty as charged with the stories.
- God, you're impressive.

440
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,355
Come on. I love talking to you.

441
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:38,276
From across the room,
I feel like we have a thing.

442
00:29:38,442 --> 00:29:42,530
You and me, man. You're
my new stepdad. You're unbelievable.

443
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:46,826
- I never heard that laugh before.
- Dad, why are you acting so weird?

444
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:49,370
By the way, where's my bro, Brennan?

445
00:29:57,503 --> 00:30:02,091
You're right about your brother.
Total dick.

446
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,801
Told you.

447
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,594
You know what? I still hate you...

448
00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:08,431
...but you got a pretty awesome collection
of nudie mags.

449
00:30:08,597 --> 00:30:11,100
I got them from the '70s, '80s and '90s.

450
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,520
It's like masturbating
in a time machine.

451
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:18,774
So I figure by the summer of 2010,
we can probably set sail.

452
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:21,819
But I think about it every day of my life.

453
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,238
Let me ask you this, Bob,
why wait two years?

454
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:27,867
- I gotta make more money.
- Okay. I hear you, believe me.

455
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,828
What if I were to tell you
that I could sell this house...

456
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,872
...for 30 percent above market?

457
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,542
- That'd be great. Could you do it?
- In a heartbeat, Robby.

458
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:40,046
I got my real-estate license
a few years back for shits and gigs.

459
00:30:40,212 --> 00:30:44,175
I'd do it for four-fifths commish.
You know what gets my dick hard?

460
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,718
Helping out my friends.

461
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:48,721
- That'd be fantastic. Oh, my God.
- Yeah? Yeah?

462
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,223
- It would be kick-ass, bro.
- Oh, man.

463
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,975
Right there.

464
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:56,145
What about Dale and Brennan?

465
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,356
Because they haven't
even gotten jobs yet.

466
00:30:58,522 --> 00:31:00,983
God, change the record.

467
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,902
Sweet!

468
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:07,782
Robert. Don't talk to me like that
in front of my son.

469
00:31:07,948 --> 00:31:11,243
We're talking about our dream,
the boat. Come on.

470
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:15,331
Yeah, it's our dream, but I think
it needs to be done in good time.

471
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:19,001
I'm just saying give it some thought,
okay? That's all I'm saying.

472
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:22,254
Holy shit, triplets.

473
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,174
It's true, three's company.

474
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,343
- It shows tons of bush.
- Hey, careful.

475
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,637
Careful with that. You're crinkling.

476
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,932
That's a collector's item.
It's worth a lot of money.

477
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,350
What's up, faggots?

478
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:37,686
What's up? You're not gonna
come down, say hi to me?

479
00:31:37,853 --> 00:31:38,896
Hi, Derek.

480
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,816
Whoa, calm down, man. I'm just joking.

481
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:45,111
I really like your guys' setup up here.

482
00:31:45,277 --> 00:31:46,862
What is your problem, man?

483
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:50,449
My problem? I don't know.
I don't have a problem, Dale.

484
00:31:50,616 --> 00:31:52,868
I have the opposite of a problem:

485
00:31:53,035 --> 00:31:55,538
I made over 550 K last year.
How much did you make?

486
00:31:55,704 --> 00:31:58,207
- It's not about money.
- No, it's not about money.

487
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,459
For me, it's a little bit about money...

488
00:32:00,626 --> 00:32:02,711
...and I made
that much money last year.

489
00:32:02,878 --> 00:32:04,296
I am the VP of the biggest...

490
00:32:04,463 --> 00:32:08,175
...executive-helicopter-leasing company
on the Western Seaboard.

491
00:32:08,342 --> 00:32:11,262
Okay? I haven't had a carb since 2004.

492
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:14,765
Check these out. See these boys?

493
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:16,267
This is what I live with.

494
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,936
Every day I lather this up
with Kiehl's in the shower.

495
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,730
You wanna touch this shit?
Wanna touch these bad boys?

496
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,693
- Sorry, not gonna happen.
- Is there something you want?

497
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,653
I promised Mom I'd offer you a job.

498
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,739
I told her it'd count
as her Christmas present, so...

499
00:32:30,906 --> 00:32:32,825
No. I'll never work for you.

500
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,118
Fine. I don't care.

501
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,746
Truth is, I just smoked a J
out in my car a few minutes ago...

502
00:32:37,913 --> 00:32:39,790
...so feeling a little spacey.

503
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:42,042
Know what I'm say...?
What's up with you, man?

504
00:32:42,751 --> 00:32:44,378
What you looking at, kemosabe?

505
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,880
You...

506
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,549
You wanna punch me right now.

507
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:51,886
You wanna punch me right now,
but you won't.

508
00:32:52,636 --> 00:32:54,013
You wanna punch me too?

509
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,932
You guys both look like you might
wanna hit me in the face.

510
00:32:57,099 --> 00:32:59,185
You do, I can tell. Why don't you do it?

511
00:32:59,351 --> 00:33:01,020
Why don't you punch me in the face?

512
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,771
Punch me in the fucking face!

513
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,114
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my shoulder!

514
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,532
That was awesome.

515
00:33:13,699 --> 00:33:15,701
Mom! Mom!

516
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,245
Derek, know what's always good
for shoulder pain?

517
00:33:18,412 --> 00:33:20,706
- What?
- If you lick my butthole.

518
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,666
Snap!

519
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,920
- Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Bobby.
- Sure.

520
00:33:26,086 --> 00:33:29,465
Aside from that retard trying to punch me,
it was a pretty good evening.

521
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:33,052
- It was our pleasure, son.
- Why are you calling him that?

522
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,470
Oh, don't, don't.

523
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,431
Bye, kids. I'll check out
that stock you recommended.

524
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,641
Excuse me.

525
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:42,269
- Hi. I'm Alice, I'm Derek's wife.
- Hi.

526
00:33:42,436 --> 00:33:45,898
Is it true you struck Derek in the face
and he fell from the tree house?

527
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,566
Yeah. He asked me to.

528
00:33:47,733 --> 00:33:50,027
That's the most amazing thing
I've ever heard.

529
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,820
I want you to know that tonight...

530
00:33:51,987 --> 00:33:55,491
...I am gonna pleasure myself
to the image of you doing that to Derek.

531
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,284
You know what I mean?

532
00:33:57,451 --> 00:33:59,078
Masturbate.

533
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,829
I am.

534
00:34:00,996 --> 00:34:02,790
Oh, Dale.

535
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,833
You are something.

536
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:07,920
You are something.

537
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:10,631
You're something too.

538
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:14,260
I wanna roll you into a little ball
and shove you up my vagina.

539
00:34:15,052 --> 00:34:19,223
You could just live there.
It's warm and it's cozy.

540
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,474
In your vagina?

541
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:24,103
I wanna walk around with you in there
and just know that...

542
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,772
...whenever I feel
a little tickle or scratch...

543
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:30,276
...that it's just your hair up my vagina.

544
00:34:30,442 --> 00:34:32,486
Please, just do it for me.

545
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,154
What's happening?

546
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,158
Kiss me.

547
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,707
I know. I know. It's too much.

548
00:34:44,873 --> 00:34:47,126
It's too much.

549
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,965
I hate my life, Dale.

550
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:56,594
Dale, I hate my life!
I have nobody to talk to.

551
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,721
- You seemed okay at the di...
- Please.

552
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:00,806
Alice! Honey, come on!

553
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:04,602
Dane Cook, pay-per-view,
20 minutes. Let's go!

554
00:35:04,768 --> 00:35:08,147
Coming, honey! I'm just talking to Dale.

555
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:10,858
This is so stupid.

556
00:35:11,942 --> 00:35:13,277
Call me.

557
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:16,697
- I love you.
- Okay.

558
00:35:22,828 --> 00:35:25,289
- Hey. What'd she want?
- What?

559
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:29,209
Nothing. Who's...? Who?

560
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,211
Alice.

561
00:35:31,378 --> 00:35:35,424
We were just talking. Not...
It was not about sex or anything.

562
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,802
I can't believe you hit Derek.

563
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:41,680
I know. Did you see
the expression on his face?

564
00:35:41,847 --> 00:35:44,600
- That was cool.
- Listen.

565
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,936
I know that we started out as foe.

566
00:35:48,103 --> 00:35:50,773
But after that courageous act...

567
00:35:50,939 --> 00:35:53,984
...that you showed me
against the one they call Derek...

568
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:58,906
...maybe someday
we could become friends.

569
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:03,327
Friends who ride majestic,
translucent steeds...

570
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,747
...shooting flaming arrows
across the Bridge of Hemdale.

571
00:36:07,706 --> 00:36:10,918
I would follow you into the mists
of Avalon, if that's what you mean.

572
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:14,421
Do you wanna see something cool
that only three people have seen?

573
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:20,928
Okay, open your eyes.

574
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,640
See that black smudge
right there on the blade?

575
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,642
- Yeah.
- Look at it closely.

576
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:29,269
- Pretty recognizable signature.
- No.

577
00:36:29,436 --> 00:36:31,897
Randy Jackson from American Idol.

578
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:35,234
Why do you have Randy Jackson's
autograph on a martial-arts weapon?

579
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,820
I bumped into him
and all I had was this sword...

580
00:36:37,986 --> 00:36:40,739
...and you're not gonna not get
Randy Jackson's autograph.

581
00:36:40,906 --> 00:36:43,283
I would've done the exact same thing.

582
00:36:44,576 --> 00:36:47,413
Now, do you wanna see
something really cool?

583
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:49,665
- Of course.
- Turn off the lights.

584
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,546
Industrial-strength night-vision goggles.

585
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,297
Holy Santa Claus shit.

586
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,634
Can you imagine if we had these
when we were 12?

587
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,970
Even better.
We got them when we're 40.

588
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:07,641
You know what's amazing?
They're not that noticeable on your face.

589
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,727
- Right?
- Yeah.

590
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:14,189
I can't believe I've been living here
for two weeks...

591
00:37:14,356 --> 00:37:16,233
...and I'm walking around this place...

592
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,986
...thinking I've got a huge doucher
for a stepbrother.

593
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:21,488
Secretly, you're not a doucher.

594
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,490
Let's play a game.

595
00:37:23,657 --> 00:37:26,368
On the count of three,
name your favorite dinosaur.

596
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,955
Don't even think about it, just name it.
Ready? One, two, three.

597
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,665
- Velociraptor.
- Velociraptor.

598
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:35,252
Favorite non-pornographic magazine
to masturbate to.

599
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,713
- Good Housekeeping.
- Good Housekeeping.

600
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,758
If you were a chick,
who's the one guy you'd sleep with?

601
00:37:40,924 --> 00:37:42,301
- John Stamos.
- John Stamos.

602
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,803
- What?!
- Did we just become best friends?

603
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,388
Yep!

604
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,640
Do you wanna go do karate
in the garage?

605
00:37:48,807 --> 00:37:50,225
Yup!

606
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,330
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

607
00:38:16,376 --> 00:38:18,462
I think they're starting
to like each other.

608
00:38:19,004 --> 00:38:21,048
I got a really bad feeling about this.

609
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,176
- Sword fight!
- I know.

610
00:38:24,551 --> 00:38:25,594
Sword fight!

611
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,768
- Exactly the same!
- I know! That's so weird.

612
00:38:36,396 --> 00:38:37,481
Now you're in trouble.

613
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:40,859
- Come on!
- No!

614
00:38:41,026 --> 00:38:43,237
They're betting against you,
but you can do it!

615
00:38:44,446 --> 00:38:45,906
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

616
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,369
- Is this a bad time?
- What the hell's going on?

617
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:53,455
Ma, Mr. Doback, okay,
Dale and I were just...

618
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,457
Stop calling me Mr. Doback.

619
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:56,959
Sorry. Okay.

620
00:38:57,125 --> 00:38:59,670
Mom, Doback...

621
00:39:00,295 --> 00:39:02,589
...we think it would be very prudent...

622
00:39:02,756 --> 00:39:05,259
- Can we turn our beds into bunk beds?
- Yes.

623
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,261
Why are you guys so sweaty?

624
00:39:07,427 --> 00:39:10,347
We've already figured out how.
The beds match up perfectly.

625
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,767
It would give us so much extra space
in our room to do activities.

626
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:14,977
Please say yes.

627
00:39:15,143 --> 00:39:17,437
You don't need our permission
to build bunk beds.

628
00:39:17,604 --> 00:39:19,815
You're adults. You can do what you want.

629
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,942
So...?

630
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,529
I'm not making myself clear.

631
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,240
I don't give a fuck.

632
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,826
Now, you both have
several interviews tomorrow.

633
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:34,580
I would think you'd be focused on that
and not building bunk beds.

634
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:39,251
- So...?
- So...?

635
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:43,630
- We can? No?
- Yes. Yes, you can make bunk beds.

636
00:39:43,797 --> 00:39:46,091
- I knew it.
- Okay. You are not gonna regret this.

637
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,135
We'll get so much more activities done.

638
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,179
This is the funnest night ever!

639
00:39:52,389 --> 00:39:54,683
This is so scary.

640
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,229
- How you doing over there?
- Really good.

641
00:39:59,646 --> 00:40:00,689
Okay.

642
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,900
Does your son know anything
about carpentry?

643
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:05,611
No, not a th... Did I hear a drill?

644
00:40:06,194 --> 00:40:08,488
- Dale! No power tools!
- Power tools.

645
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,824
- What?
- No power tools!

646
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:14,661
- No, I forgot, I have to brush my teeth.
- That is not your toothbrush.

647
00:40:14,828 --> 00:40:17,372
Oh, okay. Well, I'm all done anyway.

648
00:40:17,539 --> 00:40:18,874
- We did it.
- We did it!

649
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,083
It looks amazing!

650
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,378
Look at that! That looks like
what you'd buy from a store!

651
00:40:23,545 --> 00:40:26,256
- Should've been a bunk bed all along.
- Look at this space.

652
00:40:26,423 --> 00:40:29,176
- We could do aerobics in here.
- So many activities!

653
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,386
- Do step class.
- It's making my head spin...

654
00:40:31,553 --> 00:40:33,889
- ...how many activities we can do.
- Play Army men.

655
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,349
- Yeah.
- Come on.

656
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,731
I never asked you.
Do you like guacamole?

657
00:40:44,858 --> 00:40:47,235
Oh, Brennan! Oh, God!

658
00:40:47,402 --> 00:40:49,529
Brennan! Brennan!

659
00:40:50,113 --> 00:40:52,366
Dad. Nancy. It's bad.

660
00:40:52,532 --> 00:40:54,576
It's so bad. There's blood everywhere.

661
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:58,372
The bunk beds were a terrible idea.
Why'd you let us do that?

662
00:40:58,538 --> 00:41:01,208
- It's so bad!
- How would you describe that?

663
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:06,922
- It's not so bad.
- Right. See?

664
00:41:08,715 --> 00:41:09,841
Put your beds back.

665
00:41:10,008 --> 00:41:12,052
Rumpus time is over.

666
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:15,347
You got a big day tomorrow.
You need your eight hours.

667
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:22,187
And although she was 88 years old,
she never stopped believing.

668
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:24,106
It's 8:20 in the a.m.

669
00:41:24,272 --> 00:41:27,109
Coming up next, a recent study
by the American Council...

670
00:41:27,275 --> 00:41:29,236
Look at her. She's hot.

671
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:33,740
Okay, guys, this is it.
Good luck. Don't be late.

672
00:41:33,907 --> 00:41:36,410
Dad, I need to borrow clothes
for the interview...

673
00:41:36,576 --> 00:41:38,495
...since I don't have any fancy clothes.

674
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,873
Go in my closet, take whatever you need.
You guys gotta look sharp.

675
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,084
This is the most important day
of our lives.

676
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,669
- Okay.
- No pressure.

677
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,087
- All right? Relax.
- Okay.

678
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,338
I gotta go.

679
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:50,507
This is your day. Remember that. Own it.

680
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,551
- This is your one day!
- All right.

681
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,805
Mr. Huff, Mr. Jeener is ready
for your interview.

682
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,141
We'll be interviewing as a team.

683
00:41:59,307 --> 00:42:01,560
We're here to fuck shit up.

684
00:42:06,189 --> 00:42:07,816
Move it!

685
00:42:16,324 --> 00:42:17,701
Hey!

686
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:21,955
- You certainly have had a lot of jobs.
- I'm a bit of a spark plug.

687
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,583
And, Human Resources lady,
when I think...

688
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,669
- You know, it's... Actually, it's Pam.
- I'm sorry.

689
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,756
- Well, Pan...
- No, my name is Pam.

690
00:42:30,922 --> 00:42:34,968
- Are you saying Pan or Pam?
- I'm saying Pam.

691
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:38,513
I'm sorry, who is this gentleman
sitting behind you?

692
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,641
Hello, Ms. Lady.
I'm Dale, Brennan's stepbrother.

693
00:42:41,808 --> 00:42:45,270
I think I might be able to help
with the Pan-Pam dilemma.

694
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,355
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Pam.

695
00:42:47,522 --> 00:42:49,191
- Pan.
- Pam.

696
00:42:49,357 --> 00:42:51,359
- Pand. There's a D on the end.
- With an M.

697
00:42:51,526 --> 00:42:57,074
- There's no D. It's Pam.
- It's like "comb," except P-A-N-M.

698
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,868
- N-N. There's two N's.
- Two M's. That was the confusion.

699
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,411
No, there's just one M.

700
00:43:01,578 --> 00:43:03,663
What do you say we interview you?

701
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:07,000
All right. Yes, that's
a sometimes-useful exercise.

702
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,920
Please put your hand down. Go ahead.

703
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:13,340
How much money do you make a year
before taxes?

704
00:43:13,965 --> 00:43:16,301
I'm not comfortable answering that.

705
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,054
- Come on!
- We're doing the interview, not you.

706
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:23,016
Here's a shot out of a cannon:
Oprah, Barbara Walters, your wife.

707
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,393
You gotta fuck one,
marry one, kill one. Go!

708
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,187
I think we're done here.

709
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:31,233
Mr. Huff, under your references,
you listed Dale Doback...

710
00:43:31,399 --> 00:43:33,735
...which I know is this gentleman,
but you also listed:

711
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,946
- "Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior."
- Yeah.

712
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,698
We are looking
for people we can contact.

713
00:43:38,865 --> 00:43:41,034
We wanna tell you
the stuff we're not good at.

714
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,829
- Our weaknesses.
- So we're clear up front.

715
00:43:43,995 --> 00:43:46,957
- Okay.
- We're not generally comfortable...

716
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,210
- ...in an office setting.
- I get cooped up.

717
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:53,380
I won't go into an office
that's been used before.

718
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:56,133
I am no good before 11 a.m.

719
00:43:56,299 --> 00:43:59,511
I get headaches from computers,
so I can't be around them too long.

720
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,096
I take stuff.

721
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,598
I need someone to go with me
in the elevator.

722
00:44:03,765 --> 00:44:06,768
I have a weakness for sweets.

723
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:07,978
Other weaknesses?

724
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,273
We're slow learners
and we're not particularly good listeners.

725
00:44:11,439 --> 00:44:15,152
- That'll be a huge problem.
- We're also slow learners.

726
00:44:15,318 --> 00:44:19,114
- I needed someone to work...
- Shut your mouth. Shut your mouth.

727
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,574
I think we've had enough...

728
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,784
- Shush up for one second.
- Shut your mouth.

729
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:25,745
- Wait, shut your mouth.
- What did you just say?

730
00:44:25,912 --> 00:44:28,582
- You're just coming off stupid.
- I'm coming off stupid?

731
00:44:28,748 --> 00:44:32,502
You're wearing tuxedos to a job
that requires you to clean bathrooms.

732
00:44:32,669 --> 00:44:36,423
- Leave this office, we're done.
- Do we get any sort of souvenir?

733
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,216
Get out of my office!

734
00:44:38,383 --> 00:44:42,095
I'm looking to hire guys I don't mind
hanging out with for 12 hours a day.

735
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,722
You seem like cool guys.

736
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:46,892
Got hair similar to mine,
you wear tuxedos to the interview.

737
00:44:47,058 --> 00:44:48,894
That's funny, it's ironic. I get that.

738
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:52,731
Underplaying the whole formality of it.
That's funny as hell.

739
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:55,734
So let's do this.
You guys are hired. You're in.

740
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:58,612
Unless you're the weirdest guys ever
and I don't see it.

741
00:44:58,778 --> 00:45:00,280
Great.

742
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,300
- Was that a fart?
- I don't know.

743
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,344
I can taste it.

744
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:23,637
On my tongue.

745
00:45:23,803 --> 00:45:26,181
I'll be honest with you. I did fart.

746
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:29,434
Is that onion? Onion and...
Onion and ketchup.

747
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:33,438
- It stinks. And this is a small room.
- Shit.

748
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,899
Okay, now the tuxedos seem fucked up.

749
00:45:37,108 --> 00:45:40,862
God. We were so close.

750
00:45:41,279 --> 00:45:44,366
So, what do we do for jobs?
Is your dad really gonna kick us out?

751
00:45:44,532 --> 00:45:48,662
Listen, don't worry about my dad.

752
00:45:48,995 --> 00:45:51,456
Got him sewn up.

753
00:45:51,831 --> 00:45:54,834
We've gotta start thinking bigger,
though, Brennan.

754
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:58,129
Listen, what are you really good at?

755
00:45:58,296 --> 00:46:00,966
Singing. I'm a world-class singer.

756
00:46:01,132 --> 00:46:03,802
See? Right there, that's an amazing skill.

757
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,345
Now, what am I good at?

758
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:08,431
I can shred on the drums
and I'm a marketing wiz.

759
00:46:08,598 --> 00:46:11,393
Put all that together, what do you get?

760
00:46:11,893 --> 00:46:14,980
- I don't know, a band?
- No, that's been done before.

761
00:46:15,146 --> 00:46:20,318
Even better: We are gonna start
an international entertainment company.

762
00:46:20,485 --> 00:46:22,654
The biggest and the best.

763
00:46:23,154 --> 00:46:26,157
And we're gonna call it
Prestige Worldwide.

764
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,076
That sounds so cool.

765
00:46:28,493 --> 00:46:32,622
I feel like a lightning bolt hit
the tip of my penis.

766
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:35,041
Yeah. Yeah.

767
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:38,169
We're brothers. This is why we met.

768
00:46:38,336 --> 00:46:40,547
- To form this alliance, right?
- Right?

769
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,174
That's why our parents met,
so this could happen.

770
00:46:43,341 --> 00:46:46,177
- Okay, what do we do?
- We get to work.

771
00:46:46,344 --> 00:46:49,681
And we hit the beat laboratory right now.
Let's go.

772
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,391
- What?
- Wait.

773
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,018
What time is it?

774
00:46:53,184 --> 00:46:54,728
- Four thirty.
- Four thirty.

775
00:46:54,894 --> 00:46:56,813
Four thirty-two.

776
00:46:59,065 --> 00:47:02,777
- I can't go down Whitworth right now.
- Okay.

777
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:04,779
We should go this way.

778
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,116
- What's up?
- Chris Gardocki.

779
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,617
- What?
- He gets in my face...

780
00:47:09,784 --> 00:47:12,162
...and I just don't wanna deal
with the hassle now.

781
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,040
- Are you this scared?
- Can we please go the long way?

782
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:18,376
- Down Cutler?
- Yeah.

783
00:47:18,543 --> 00:47:20,337
But that's 45 minutes.

784
00:47:20,503 --> 00:47:22,297
You're gonna shame me
into doing this.

785
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,841
- You sound stupid.
- You'll be sorry. I'm stupid.

786
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,010
Oh, man.

787
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:30,555
Oh, God, there they are.

788
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:34,059
Oh, my God, is that Dale Doback?

789
00:47:34,225 --> 00:47:36,728
- Let's make him lick dog shit.
- Yeah.

790
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:41,816
Hey, fag-stick. Long time, no see.

791
00:47:41,983 --> 00:47:44,569
Is that your boyfriend?
Is that your butt buddy?

792
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:47,155
Look, Mr. Gardocki,
just leave me alone, will you?

793
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,157
Shut your mouth, esé.

794
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:52,452
You guys just go back and have fun
on your jungle gym, okay?

795
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,871
Does butt buddy have a name?

796
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:58,917
If you're referring to me as butt buddy,
yes, I do have a name.

797
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,418
It's Brennan Huff.

798
00:48:00,585 --> 00:48:03,755
If you don't come over here
and lick that white dog shit...

799
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:06,174
...I'm gonna plow into your nose
with my fist.

800
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:10,178
- I'm not licking any white dog shit.
- I'll lick the shit if you leave us alone.

801
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:13,515
Dale, you're not licking dog shit, okay?
They're kids.

802
00:48:13,681 --> 00:48:15,934
- It's just dog shit.
- It's ridiculous!

803
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:20,271
- Hello, how are...?
- Oh, my nose! My nose!

804
00:48:20,438 --> 00:48:22,982
Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

805
00:48:24,692 --> 00:48:26,194
Get them!

806
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:41,501
So maybe you don't go
down that way anymore.

807
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:43,586
Maybe you go the long way home.

808
00:48:43,753 --> 00:48:46,589
That's what we talked about.
We'll take the long way home.

809
00:48:46,756 --> 00:48:49,592
You know in that one scene
in The Wizard of Oz...

810
00:48:49,759 --> 00:48:52,554
...when the flying monkeys pull
apart the Scarecrow?

811
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,764
That's what it was like.

812
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:57,434
- It's okay, it's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

813
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,228
Is my dad mad about
the stuff that happened?

814
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:03,022
Robert was very upset, yes.

815
00:49:03,189 --> 00:49:05,900
He knows that you interviewed
as a team.

816
00:49:06,067 --> 00:49:07,569
He heard about the fart.

817
00:49:07,735 --> 00:49:09,696
- Oh, he did?
- Yeah.

818
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:11,573
You just couldn't hold it, or you...?

819
00:49:11,739 --> 00:49:14,617
- No. I thought it was gonna be silent.
- It was not silent.

820
00:49:14,784 --> 00:49:17,495
Just kept going, and it made a sound.
It was embarrassing.

821
00:49:17,662 --> 00:49:18,705
It got louder.

822
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:21,749
So listen, Bobby,
I'll get those keys made tomorrow...

823
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:25,378
- ...and then we'll start setting up times.
- Thank you.

824
00:49:26,671 --> 00:49:28,131
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

825
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,466
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

826
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:31,843
- Always nice to see you.
- You too.

827
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,645
Hey, guys.

828
00:49:42,812 --> 00:49:44,856
Looks like your free ride's over, huh?

829
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,774
Have fun living on the streets.

830
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,944
Okay, cool. Good chatting, guys.
Bye, Mom.

831
00:49:50,111 --> 00:49:52,280
- Bye.
- See you, buddy.

832
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,826
What was he doing here?

833
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:58,786
We're putting the house on the market.

834
00:49:58,953 --> 00:50:02,582
- Where are we moving?
- Is the house haunted?

835
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:05,376
Nancy and I are retiring...

836
00:50:05,543 --> 00:50:08,296
...and sailing around the world
on my boat.

837
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,757
We are living the dream.

838
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,175
Well, what about us?

839
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,513
I'm sorry. Robert thou...

840
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:18,640
We thought that...

841
00:50:18,806 --> 00:50:22,644
...you should take responsibility
for your own lives.

842
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,062
This is the exciting part:

843
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,439
We'll put enough money
in your accounts...

844
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,608
...for a security deposit on an apartment.

845
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,068
What's this all about?

846
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:34,739
More than just money, we're gonna
get you another kind of support as well.

847
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:37,742
You're both gonna see therapists.
Nancy thinks it'll help.

848
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:41,663
- Guys, that's nonnegotiable.
- Hold on. We're not going on the boat...

849
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:45,124
...Derek's selling the house,
we have to go to therapy?

850
00:50:46,417 --> 00:50:48,294
- What the fuck happened?!
- Hey!

851
00:50:48,461 --> 00:50:51,589
Look, I know this seems really,
really sudden...

852
00:50:51,756 --> 00:50:54,092
...and just sort of unfair and cruel and...

853
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:57,345
- But it's nonnegotiable.
- But it's nonnegotiable.

854
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:02,058
I got a bellyful of white dog crap in me
and now you lay this shit on me?

855
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:05,144
It's time you started acting like adults.

856
00:51:05,311 --> 00:51:08,398
- Mom.
- I'm not backing down, Brennan.

857
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,941
Don't even try.

858
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:13,194
I know it seems hard,
but it's the best thing for both of you.

859
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,988
We do it because we love you.

860
00:51:15,154 --> 00:51:18,866
Dad, I'm doing this
because I love you: Fuck you.

861
00:51:19,033 --> 00:51:20,994
- Anything else?
- No.

862
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,580
Bon voyage! Have a great time!

863
00:51:24,622 --> 00:51:26,499
Hey, what's up, Derek?

864
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:27,709
Yeah.

865
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:29,210
- Know what?
- Look what I got.

866
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:32,630
I'm sitting here thinking
we finally got a family together here...

867
00:51:32,797 --> 00:51:36,259
...and now it's about to be taken away
because they think we're losers.

868
00:51:37,176 --> 00:51:40,680
- Because they don't understand us?
- Yeah.

869
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:44,350
They don't get
that this lifestyle is a choice.

870
00:51:44,517 --> 00:51:47,645
And all they think about
is that stupid boat.

871
00:51:47,812 --> 00:51:51,190
I swear, I'm so pissed off at my mom.

872
00:51:51,357 --> 00:51:54,902
As soon as she is of age,
I'm putting her in a home.

873
00:51:55,069 --> 00:51:57,822
We have got
to get Prestige Worldwide going.

874
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,949
It's the only thing
that'll save this family.

875
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:02,994
I was thinking we should have
a investor presentation...

876
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,412
...like on The Apprentice.

877
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,748
We gotta start
with some capital somewhere.

878
00:52:06,914 --> 00:52:08,791
Here's the thing, though:

879
00:52:08,958 --> 00:52:12,211
If we're gonna start
a huge multinational corporation...

880
00:52:12,378 --> 00:52:13,880
...I have to hear you sing.

881
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:16,716
Can't you just trust
that I'm a good singer?

882
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:20,511
Just one song, so I know
what your voice sounds like.

883
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,847
Yeah, yeah. I'll just do it.

884
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:27,185
No big deal. I'll just dive into it
and just start singing.

885
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:34,275
Jesus, my heart is beating
so fast right now.

886
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:37,153
Okay, just do it. Just do it.

887
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,363
Just...

888
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:28,955
I don't know.

889
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:32,375
I didn't sing too loud because I don't
wanna wake up Robert and Nancy.

890
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:36,003
My throat's sore. I've had a sore throat
for a month and a half.

891
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:39,006
And this is not an acoustic environment
that's suitable...

892
00:53:39,173 --> 00:53:41,259
...to request this from me.

893
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:44,679
You gotta know, I'm not just some guy.

894
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:48,307
Brennan, that is the voice of an angel.

895
00:53:50,017 --> 00:53:52,770
Brennan, I can't even make eye contact
with you right now.

896
00:53:52,937 --> 00:53:55,606
Your voice is like a combination
of Fergie and Jesus.

897
00:53:55,773 --> 00:53:57,734
Why can't you do that in front of people?

898
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,694
Are you messing with me right now?

899
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:02,739
It's me, Dale.

900
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,074
You're good.

901
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,161
- I know.
- This is gonna sound weird...

902
00:54:08,327 --> 00:54:13,458
...but for a second, I think
you took on the shape of a unicorn.

903
00:54:13,624 --> 00:54:17,462
I felt like I was hovering
above my own body...

904
00:54:17,628 --> 00:54:19,213
...watching myself sing.

905
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,174
Let's move on to other business.

906
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:24,802
First thing tomorrow, we gotta get
cracking on this investor presentation.

907
00:54:24,969 --> 00:54:27,930
And guess what else.
This just came to me.

908
00:54:28,097 --> 00:54:31,392
- We're making a music video.
- Yeah.

909
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,479
What do we do about Derek
and the house?

910
00:54:36,355 --> 00:54:38,316
Don't worry about him.

911
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,286
Oh, it's a great "nabe."

912
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,371
Frank Gifford lived down the block.

913
00:54:52,538 --> 00:54:55,666
- The Giff?
- Yeah, the Giff. Right down the block.

914
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:58,419
I'm getting a good feeling about this.

915
00:54:58,586 --> 00:54:59,629
I am so glad.

916
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,423
Get us that 10-year interest-only loan,
we got a deal.

917
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,593
Hey, fuckers!
Welcome to the neighborhood!

918
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,597
- My name is Craig.
- The neighbor is a Nazi?

919
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:13,601
You guys ever need fertilizer,
I've got a lot of it. Close to 80 tons.

920
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:17,688
Hey, folks! How you doing?
You're gonna love this neighborhood.

921
00:55:17,855 --> 00:55:19,482
Every single house here recycles.

922
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,734
- Okay, we're done here.
- Yeah, okay.

923
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:24,737
Hey, Derek, sprechen sie dick.

924
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:27,365
I don't know how much
you know about therapy...

925
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:30,827
...but it usually starts by you telling me
something about yourself.

926
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:33,538
I work at a college as a janitor...

927
00:55:33,704 --> 00:55:36,290
...even though I'm smarter
than the people there.

928
00:55:36,457 --> 00:55:39,377
Sometimes I see an equation
written on a blackboard...

929
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:42,505
...like half an equation,
and I'll figure it out.

930
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:45,049
- Is this Good Will Hunting?
- No.

931
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:48,219
It sounds a lot like the plot
of Good Will Hunting.

932
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:52,139
Yeah. Anyway.
My best friend is Ben Affleck...

933
00:55:52,306 --> 00:55:55,351
I thought we'd begin
talking about your parents' divorce.

934
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,727
Okay.

935
00:55:56,894 --> 00:55:58,896
How old were you
when they got divorced?

936
00:55:59,063 --> 00:56:01,190
- Fifteen.
- That's a hard age.

937
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:04,318
- Yes. Yeah.
- Do you wanna talk...

938
00:56:04,485 --> 00:56:06,612
- ...about some of those feelings?
- I love you.

939
00:56:06,779 --> 00:56:10,241
- Obviously, you don't know me.
- I love you so much.

940
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:13,828
Thank you. I will take that
as a feeling that you have...

941
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:16,205
...of comfortability with me.

942
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:18,165
It's more than comfortability.

943
00:56:18,332 --> 00:56:21,586
- I mean, I fucking love you.
- Okay. I th...

944
00:56:21,752 --> 00:56:23,546
I'm thinking about our life together.

945
00:56:24,088 --> 00:56:26,173
I feel like I'm walking on a cloud.

946
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,426
My penis is tingling right now.

947
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:32,305
- That is so off-putting.
- You're not feeling this?

948
00:56:32,471 --> 00:56:36,434
In no way, shape or form do I feel
any feelings of intimacy towards you...

949
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:38,603
...in any way whatsoever.

950
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:40,605
You got a really dope front lawn here.

951
00:56:40,771 --> 00:56:42,690
You and your homeboys can play on that.

952
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,817
- You can just say, "It looks good."
- Yeah.

953
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,027
No, that's how I talk.

954
00:56:46,193 --> 00:56:49,572
Oh, you got a really fresh entryway here.
Pretty awesome.

955
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,325
...Show you the front of the house,
which is actual...

956
00:56:52,491 --> 00:56:56,621
Will you vultures please give us
some privacy? He just died last night.

957
00:56:56,787 --> 00:56:58,331
What is going on here?

958
00:56:58,497 --> 00:57:00,791
It was the asbestos in here,
that's what did it!

959
00:57:00,958 --> 00:57:02,418
I've seen too many dead bodies.

960
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,962
- I can't be in here.
- No, no, no.

961
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:10,927
- Not bad.
- Eat shit, Derek.

962
00:57:11,093 --> 00:57:14,722
- Awesome B-day party, broheisens.
- You the man, Derek.

963
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:17,266
Okay, who's this from? TJ?

964
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:19,393
Where are the rest of my gifts, dude?

965
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,395
Totally joking around, TJ.

966
00:57:21,562 --> 00:57:22,813
All right.

967
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:27,360
Oh, yes! Yes! Callaway 3-wood.

968
00:57:27,526 --> 00:57:28,778
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

969
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:30,738
Yeah.

970
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:33,407
- Bomb it down the fairway, bitches!
- That's right.

971
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:38,704
Hi, my name is Jim.
Wanna suck my dick for money?

972
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,540
- It's just me. Hi.
- Oh, my God.

973
00:57:41,707 --> 00:57:44,001
This is the men's bathroom.

974
00:57:44,168 --> 00:57:46,003
Happy anniversary.

975
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:48,506
- It's our second date.
- What?

976
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:52,510
Listen, I'm sick of being
all coy and bashful, Dale. Okay?

977
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:55,680
- We're in the bathroom.
- This'll just take a minute.

978
00:57:55,846 --> 00:57:59,058
There's really little you can do about it.
Let me just hop on.

979
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:02,645
It's all slippery.

980
00:58:03,562 --> 00:58:04,605
Oh, my God!

981
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:12,822
It's getting tingly.
Something's gonna happen, Alice!

982
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:23,165
Oh, we just had sex.

983
00:58:23,332 --> 00:58:26,669
- Just the way I imagined it.
- I like you.

984
00:58:27,586 --> 00:58:28,879
I love you.

985
00:58:29,046 --> 00:58:31,173
- Stay golden, Ponyboy. I gotta pee.
- Okay.

986
00:58:33,217 --> 00:58:35,428
Oh, my God.

987
00:58:35,594 --> 00:58:37,638
You're incredible.

988
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:40,182
Say hello to my little friend.

989
00:58:42,351 --> 00:58:44,729
- Just kidding. It's from Scarf ace.
- Scarf ace.

990
00:58:46,772 --> 00:58:48,107
Shut the fuck up!

991
00:58:48,774 --> 00:58:51,027
- Sweet-ass gift, Teej.
- Yeah, not bad.

992
00:58:51,193 --> 00:58:52,820
- I got it all mapped out.
- Okay.

993
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:56,407
- I'm following your lead, though.
- I'll get all eyes on us.

994
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:57,950
- Okay.
- Just like we planned.

995
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:00,244
And then we'll drop the hammer.

996
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:04,290
What were Dale and Brennan doing
with my video camera?

997
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:07,084
I have no idea.
And frankly, I really don't care. So...

998
00:59:08,085 --> 00:59:09,670
I would like to say a few things.

999
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:13,132
Derek, you are
an outstanding young man, son.

1000
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:15,843
And I would like to say
that this is the image I have:

1001
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:19,180
Sometimes when I'm making love
to your mother and I realize that...

1002
00:59:19,346 --> 00:59:21,807
...this is where you came from,
that I'm so moved...

1003
00:59:21,974 --> 00:59:25,186
...that I talked to my lawyer,
and not only are you going to be...

1004
00:59:25,352 --> 00:59:28,439
...in my heart forever,
but you'll be in my will.

1005
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,191
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

1006
00:59:30,357 --> 00:59:32,568
- Robert, that was fucking awesome.
- Thank you.

1007
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,529
You got a lot of this, buddy.
And you got a lot of these.

1008
00:59:35,696 --> 00:59:36,864
Thank you.

1009
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:39,492
Everyone, if I could have
your attention, please.

1010
00:59:40,284 --> 00:59:42,036
For those of you who don't know me...

1011
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,621
- ...my name's Dale Doback.
- Check.

1012
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:46,624
I'm Robert's other son,
the biological one.

1013
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:51,587
Probably wondering
why we gathered you here tonight...

1014
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,506
...besides Derek's birthday.

1015
00:59:54,131 --> 00:59:57,134
We got a special surprise for you,
Derek, and everybody here...

1016
00:59:57,301 --> 00:59:58,385
- Check, check.
- Check.

1017
00:59:58,552 --> 01:00:00,471
- Dale. No, please.
- Don't interrupt them.

1018
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,681
- I'm begging you.
- You wanna shut this down?

1019
01:00:02,848 --> 01:00:04,767
- Hold on.
- Derek, for your birthday...

1020
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,393
...we thought we'd roll out...

1021
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,771
...a once-in-a-lifetime
business opportunity.

1022
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:11,232
- Happy birthday, Derek.
- Music.

1023
01:00:15,402 --> 01:00:20,533
Prestige Worldwide, wide, wide, wide.

1024
01:00:20,699 --> 01:00:22,993
Prestige Worldwide.

1025
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,996
- The first word in entertainment.
- First word.

1026
01:00:26,163 --> 01:00:28,165
- Management.
- Financial portfolios.

1027
01:00:28,332 --> 01:00:30,167
- Insurance.
- Computers.

1028
01:00:30,334 --> 01:00:33,671
- Black leather gloves.
- Research and development.

1029
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:36,799
Putting in the man-hours to study
the science of what you need.

1030
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,969
Last week
we put Liquid Paper on a bee...

1031
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,428
...and it died.

1032
01:00:41,595 --> 01:00:42,972
- Security.
- Security.

1033
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,390
- And...
- And.

1034
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:46,684
...Investors?

1035
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:48,310
- Possibly you.
- Possibly you.

1036
01:00:48,477 --> 01:00:51,564
- Oh, this is classic.
- We'd like to present...

1037
01:00:52,439 --> 01:00:56,026
...the world premiere of Prestige
Worldwide's first music video...

1038
01:00:56,193 --> 01:01:00,364
...by our first act, Huff and Doback.

1039
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:03,534
- Roll it.
- Roll it.

1040
01:01:04,034 --> 01:01:07,830
Pay close attention, Dad.
It's gonna look familiar.

1041
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,916
- This is... This is perfect.
- Is that my boat?

1042
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:13,294
Yes, it is.

1043
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:15,129
What are you doing on my boat?

1044
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,798
The Niña, the Pinta
The Santa Maria

1045
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:20,509
I'll do you in the bottom
While you're drinking sangria

1046
01:01:20,676 --> 01:01:23,095
Nachos and Lemonheads
On my dad's boat

1047
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:25,306
You won't go down
'Cause my dick can float

1048
01:01:25,472 --> 01:01:28,058
We sail around the world
And go port to port

1049
01:01:28,225 --> 01:01:30,811
Every time I come
I produce a quart

1050
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:33,272
That is offensive. Brennan, Dale.

1051
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,900
I gotta have me my boats and ho's

1052
01:01:36,066 --> 01:01:38,235
Deadliest Catch without the crabs

1053
01:01:38,402 --> 01:01:41,030
We're almost out of gas
Call the Arabs

1054
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,449
Pull up the anchor
'Cause we're leaving dry land

1055
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:46,118
Get below deck
With a dick in your hand

1056
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:48,537
Boats and ho's
Boats and ho's

1057
01:01:48,704 --> 01:01:51,457
I gotta have me my boats and ho's

1058
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,876
Are you ready
for some world-class vocalization?

1059
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,628
- Get a partner.
- Wait.

1060
01:01:55,794 --> 01:01:58,505
- Who's steering the boat?
- Dad, please shut up.

1061
01:01:58,672 --> 01:01:59,882
Please shut up!

1062
01:02:09,683 --> 01:02:11,393
Yeah!

1063
01:02:17,107 --> 01:02:18,567
So...

1064
01:02:18,734 --> 01:02:20,986
...big question is:

1065
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:24,990
Aside from the damage to the boat,
which we will fix...

1066
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:27,952
...what'd you think of the presentation?

1067
01:02:28,118 --> 01:02:34,208
Brennan, I think that what you did
to Robert's boat was horrid.

1068
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:36,710
Having said that,
I think that both of you...

1069
01:02:36,877 --> 01:02:40,339
...showed a lot of enthusiasm
and inventiveness.

1070
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:42,675
Yes. Thank you.

1071
01:02:42,841 --> 01:02:44,843
You gotta be kidding me.

1072
01:02:45,719 --> 01:02:48,389
They destroyed our dream
and you're calling it inventive.

1073
01:02:48,555 --> 01:02:51,141
- No. I didn't mean it like that.
- Yes, you did.

1074
01:02:51,308 --> 01:02:52,559
Come on, you did.

1075
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:56,313
It's gonna be four years, at least,
before we can sail anywhere.

1076
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,025
- And you could care less, admit it.
- I will not admit that...

1077
01:03:00,192 --> 01:03:02,444
- ...because it is not true.
- Oh, yeah.

1078
01:03:02,611 --> 01:03:05,656
But, you know,
I do think that you could show...

1079
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:09,910
...a little bit more attentiveness
to your son and your stepson...

1080
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:11,662
...who obviously need you.

1081
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:13,163
It's true, Dr. Doback.

1082
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:16,208
You've been very cold
and unsupportive of our dreams.

1083
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,210
You wrecked my fucking boat, you goon!

1084
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:20,421
Don't speak to my son like that.

1085
01:03:20,587 --> 01:03:23,173
Your son's costing me $80,000.

1086
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:26,510
We could bicker about this all night,
but what's done is done, Dad.

1087
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:29,513
- Are you guys gonna invest or not?
- That's it! That's it!

1088
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,432
- What are you doing?
- Grab the wheel!

1089
01:03:32,182 --> 01:03:34,059
I can't believe you're being so stingy.

1090
01:03:34,226 --> 01:03:36,729
- Robert, come down.
- It's a simple business decision.

1091
01:03:36,895 --> 01:03:38,564
You jackaloons!

1092
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:42,192
You're failures! Failures!

1093
01:03:42,359 --> 01:03:45,195
And you're embarrassing yourself,
you geriatric fuck!

1094
01:03:45,362 --> 01:03:46,822
- Brennan.
- Two things:

1095
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,783
You keep your liver-spotted hands
off my beautiful mother.

1096
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:51,035
She's a saint!

1097
01:03:51,201 --> 01:03:54,747
Then you sit down and you write Dale
and Brennan a check for $10,000.

1098
01:03:54,913 --> 01:03:55,956
Oh, stop it.

1099
01:03:56,123 --> 01:04:00,002
Or I'm gonna shove one of those fake
hearing devices so far up your ass...

1100
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,962
- Brennan!
- ...you can hear the sound...

1101
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:04,882
...of your small intestine
as it produces shit!

1102
01:04:05,632 --> 01:04:07,343
- All right, here we go.
- Oh, my Lord!

1103
01:04:07,509 --> 01:04:10,596
Somebody should've done this
a long time ago, and I'm gonna do it.

1104
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:12,222
- What are you doing?
- Robert.

1105
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:14,266
There are consequences
for your actions.

1106
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:17,102
- No! Robert!
- Dad!

1107
01:04:17,269 --> 01:04:19,313
- This is not the answer.
- You're next!

1108
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,689
- Understand me?
- Yes, sir.

1109
01:04:20,856 --> 01:04:23,942
- Certain behaviors...
- Let go of me.

1110
01:04:24,109 --> 01:04:27,321
- ...will not be tolerated!
- My ass is on fire!

1111
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:42,044
Wow, the tree looks great, Nancy.
Really tasteful.

1112
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:45,714
Thank you, Dale. That's
a very nice sweater you're wearing.

1113
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:49,510
It was my mom's.
I took the shoulder pads out.

1114
01:04:49,676 --> 01:04:51,595
And, Brennan? Denise called...

1115
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:54,306
...she can't go out with you
on New Year's Eve...

1116
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:57,309
...because she's not your girlfriend,
she's your therapist.

1117
01:04:57,476 --> 01:04:58,852
- Is that what she said?
- Yeah.

1118
01:04:59,019 --> 01:05:00,062
She's a rascal.

1119
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:02,606
Hey, Dad, Nancy?

1120
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:07,820
Would it be cool if Brennan and I
opened just one present each...

1121
01:05:07,986 --> 01:05:10,155
...since it's Christmas Eve?

1122
01:05:10,322 --> 01:05:13,158
I'm gonna go down
to the Cheesecake Factory, have a drink.

1123
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:18,956
But... But it's Christmas Eve.

1124
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,874
Merry Christmas.

1125
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:23,502
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1126
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:26,004
I had my eye on one.

1127
01:05:26,171 --> 01:05:28,215
I hope it's what I think it is.

1128
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:30,509
Oh, my God. Hulk Hands!

1129
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:32,219
Wait, Dale got Hulk Hands?

1130
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:40,811
Well, you reek of Scotch
and cheesecake.

1131
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,272
You know...

1132
01:05:44,064 --> 01:05:48,819
...tonight at the Cheesecake Factory
was the happiest I've been in months.

1133
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:52,573
- Well, then I feel very sorry for you.
- Well, just...

1134
01:05:52,739 --> 01:05:56,743
Nancy, I don't know if I can ever
forgive them for wrecking my boat.

1135
01:05:56,910 --> 01:05:59,621
- Why are you giving up?
- I'm not giving up.

1136
01:05:59,788 --> 01:06:03,792
- You are. You're giving up on our boys.
- But they're 40.

1137
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:06,920
I don't care how old they are.
They're still our children.

1138
01:06:07,087 --> 01:06:10,174
Well, sometime it's got to matter
how old they are.

1139
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:13,051
That's all we do, is... Oh, sweet Jesus.

1140
01:06:13,218 --> 01:06:16,805
Oh, it... You know, they'll go back to bed.

1141
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:19,391
See? They're sleepwalking.

1142
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:21,560
No. No.

1143
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:23,979
See, back to bed.

1144
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:25,355
They'll be fine.

1145
01:06:25,814 --> 01:06:28,275
Just nonsense.
I'm gonna wake them up.

1146
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:31,904
- No. Why would you do such a thing?
- Well, because it's...

1147
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:34,490
- Never, ever wake up a sleepwalker.
- See, that's it.

1148
01:06:34,656 --> 01:06:36,158
- We can't ever do anything.
- No.

1149
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,744
But they could do real harm
to themselves or others.

1150
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:41,497
- Oh, the Christmas presents.
- No, guys... No, don't...

1151
01:06:41,663 --> 01:06:44,041
- No. But...
- We should take control.

1152
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:47,461
- It's always about them.
- How do you propose to do that?

1153
01:06:47,628 --> 01:06:49,755
- Oh, Jesus.
- Whatever you do, don't wake them.

1154
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:52,966
They might do real harm
to themselves or others.

1155
01:06:53,133 --> 01:06:55,969
- Not everybody does know that.
- Oh, the Christmas tree!

1156
01:06:56,136 --> 01:06:59,306
Oh, not the... No, don't...
All right, that's it!

1157
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:01,141
- I'm waking them up!
- No! No!

1158
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:02,976
- Don't wake them up!
- That's a myth!

1159
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:05,312
- Wake up, both of you.
- Don't.

1160
01:07:06,688 --> 01:07:09,233
I told you! I told you!

1161
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:12,528
Stop it! Don't hurt him!

1162
01:07:12,986 --> 01:07:16,156
The pictures! Nancy!

1163
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,412
Oh, my God!

1164
01:07:29,127 --> 01:07:31,463
I was driving around
with a buddy of mine, Topher.

1165
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,131
You guys all met Topher, right?

1166
01:07:33,298 --> 01:07:35,926
Driving around, he has
this brand-new Testarossa, right?

1167
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:40,138
We hit this four-point buck. Dead.
Lying in the road.

1168
01:07:40,305 --> 01:07:42,516
Long story short,
we sue the state of Michigan.

1169
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:47,229
I end up getting 125 G's. Okay?
You know what I spent that money on?

1170
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:49,648
Sniper rifle to hunt deer.

1171
01:07:52,025 --> 01:07:54,361
Either way, the deers lose, my friends.

1172
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:02,536
Good riddance.
Eat all the damn flowers.

1173
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:04,121
If you'll excuse me...

1174
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:08,083
...I think I'm going to go
into the other room to check my hair.

1175
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:10,294
- Excuse me.
- Sorry, everybody.

1176
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:15,257
If you'll excuse my space-cadet wife here.
Let's just say the meds aren't helping.

1177
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:18,802
I'm kidding. Kidding. But not at all.

1178
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:21,263
I have to get some more gravy.

1179
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:22,806
Dale, it's right there.

1180
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:26,351
Shush up, Nancy.
I have to get some more bread.

1181
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:29,229
What did I do to deserve that?

1182
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:35,485
What do any of us do
to deserve anything?

1183
01:08:35,652 --> 01:08:39,573
I pay enough taxes to support
all these lazy goddamn liberals.

1184
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:46,580
Get off me! Off!
Get back. Get back! Back!

1185
01:08:54,212 --> 01:08:56,298
- What do you want?
- Merry Christmas, darling.

1186
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:59,217
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh, that was torture.

1187
01:09:00,677 --> 01:09:04,181
I couldn't eat another bite of turkey
without thinking of you inside of me.

1188
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:06,266
Come on, let's try something illegal.

1189
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:08,769
Tommy, what did you get for Christmas?

1190
01:09:08,935 --> 01:09:14,149
Well, Santa brought me the Bowflex
and $1000 in fresh-minted $50 bills.

1191
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:18,945
Wanna know what I got for Christmas?
A crushed soul.

1192
01:09:22,783 --> 01:09:24,785
- Alice, please.
- Sing along, Santa.

1193
01:09:24,951 --> 01:09:26,119
You know this song.

1194
01:09:26,286 --> 01:09:28,455
What is that noise?

1195
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:30,791
It's... This is the ghost.

1196
01:09:30,957 --> 01:09:33,960
- Just try to be quiet. Okay.
- You're right.

1197
01:09:34,127 --> 01:09:36,546
- We've got to be discreet.
- All right.

1198
01:09:36,713 --> 01:09:39,758
No, no! Oh, hey.

1199
01:09:40,175 --> 01:09:44,513
- Are you all still talking in here?
- What are you doing?

1200
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:48,975
Alice was moving a chair from
the living room into the dining room...

1201
01:09:49,142 --> 01:09:52,521
...for an extra chair
and her back went out.

1202
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:56,858
And I just did the best thing,
which is get right on the muscles...

1203
01:09:57,025 --> 01:09:58,735
- Muscles.
- ...so they don't seize up.

1204
01:09:58,902 --> 01:10:01,363
Just add some heat to it.

1205
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:05,784
Damn it, Dale, sit down.

1206
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:09,496
It's just a real deep, tight muscle.

1207
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,415
Hey, sweetie, can you grab me a beer?

1208
01:10:11,581 --> 01:10:13,333
- I'll get you another Heineken.
- Yeah.

1209
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,502
Merry Christmas.

1210
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:18,797
And how about you, Tiffany,
what did you get for Christmas?

1211
01:10:18,964 --> 01:10:21,508
I got this Mikimoto pearl necklace.

1212
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:25,095
But next year I'm gonna ask Santa
for breast implants...

1213
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:27,180
...because I'm impatient with my body.

1214
01:10:27,347 --> 01:10:30,726
Hey, Tiffany. Wanna know what I got?
A crushed soul.

1215
01:10:30,892 --> 01:10:32,436
You mentioned that.

1216
01:10:33,937 --> 01:10:35,439
- So good.
- Oh, gosh!

1217
01:10:35,605 --> 01:10:39,401
It's gone into a real bad spasm,
so I put a yoga move on her.

1218
01:10:41,153 --> 01:10:44,281
...Grant me this one,
because I was pretty wasted.

1219
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:46,575
So I put my lips
around that breathalyzer...

1220
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:49,035
...and I saw those numerals pop up:

1221
01:10:49,202 --> 01:10:53,290
Point-zero-seven-nine.

1222
01:10:54,082 --> 01:10:58,670
So I started going to Chad
Michael Murray's Christmas party.

1223
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:01,256
I think that was the year.
And just driving...

1224
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:04,468
I have to interrupt. Robert,
while the children are in the living room...

1225
01:11:04,634 --> 01:11:07,554
...I think this would be a good time
to make our announcement.

1226
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:10,599
- What's going on?
- It's over.

1227
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:14,144
I'm gonna be moving in
with my friend Jack Handle...

1228
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:16,813
...and Nancy found
a townhouse in the city.

1229
01:11:17,981 --> 01:11:19,691
What is this? What's happening?

1230
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:23,236
What Robert is trying to say is
that we are getting a divorce.

1231
01:11:23,695 --> 01:11:26,364
- Don't do this.
- No. No.

1232
01:11:26,531 --> 01:11:28,241
- I could've called this one.
- No.

1233
01:11:28,408 --> 01:11:30,243
- Yeah.
- Is it our fault?

1234
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:32,454
- Is it because we were bad?
- No.

1235
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:35,624
The main thing
that Robert and I talked about...

1236
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:38,376
...is that we did not want you two
to blame yourselves.

1237
01:11:38,543 --> 01:11:41,922
- What can we do to fix it?
- Dale, honey, are you okay?

1238
01:11:42,088 --> 01:11:45,050
- Why are you calling him "honey"?
- I cannot stress this enough:

1239
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:48,762
- It is not your fault.
- Whose fault is it?

1240
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:51,348
- Fuck it, I wanna fucking know!
- Let's cut the shit.

1241
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:55,101
- It is directly your fault.
- Robert.

1242
01:11:55,268 --> 01:11:56,728
You destroyed my boat.

1243
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:58,438
You beat me up in your sleep...

1244
01:11:58,605 --> 01:12:02,651
...and worst of all, you made
Nancy and I resent each other.

1245
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:07,531
- It is absolutely 150 percent your fault!
- Of course it's their fault.

1246
01:12:07,697 --> 01:12:11,117
They're the world's biggest dickheads
and they're living in your house.

1247
01:12:11,284 --> 01:12:13,829
- Shut up, Derek.
- I'm sorry, but that...

1248
01:12:14,788 --> 01:12:18,166
Please don't cry like that.
Please don't, Brennan.

1249
01:12:22,045 --> 01:12:26,091
- Mommy!
- Dale!

1250
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:29,135
I told you that they would
feel completely to blame.

1251
01:12:29,302 --> 01:12:33,056
- Oh, let's grow up.
- I think I'm going to throw up.

1252
01:12:33,223 --> 01:12:35,642
- I think I'm gonna throw up...
- Don't throw up.

1253
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:38,645
...all the nice dinner that I had.
I'm gonna throw it up.

1254
01:12:39,896 --> 01:12:42,941
- You're not gonna throw up.
- He's gonna throw up.

1255
01:12:43,108 --> 01:12:46,027
- Come on.
- My God, he threw up. Oh, this is ugly.

1256
01:12:46,194 --> 01:12:48,280
- Hey, guys. Guys.
- This is not nice!

1257
01:12:48,446 --> 01:12:51,408
- All right, dipshits. Right here.
- Stop it, Derek.

1258
01:12:51,575 --> 01:12:56,788
- One, two, three...
- I don't want my picture taken now.

1259
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:06,006
Good luck, and remember, I need you
out of this house by tomorrow.

1260
01:13:06,172 --> 01:13:08,341
No exceptions.

1261
01:13:16,975 --> 01:13:19,603
If there's anything you need...

1262
01:13:19,769 --> 01:13:22,606
...you just give me a call. Okay?
It's all right.

1263
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:32,365
Hey. Are you awake?

1264
01:13:32,866 --> 01:13:34,534
Yeah.

1265
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:40,749
I can't believe we actually have
to move out of this house.

1266
01:13:41,374 --> 01:13:43,752
I know. I feel bad.

1267
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:46,504
You know, we don't have
to whisper anymore.

1268
01:13:46,671 --> 01:13:48,089
Mom and Dad aren't here.

1269
01:13:48,256 --> 01:13:52,636
Yeah, but can we keep doing it, though?
It helps me pretend that they are.

1270
01:13:52,802 --> 01:13:55,639
You must feel just terrible.

1271
01:13:56,389 --> 01:13:59,559
- I mean, I know I feel bad.
- Yeah.

1272
01:13:59,726 --> 01:14:02,062
But I can't imagine how you feel...

1273
01:14:02,228 --> 01:14:05,106
...after my dad looked
right at you and said...

1274
01:14:05,273 --> 01:14:07,776
...it's all your fault that they broke up.

1275
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:11,821
That's funny, because my mom said:

1276
01:14:11,988 --> 01:14:14,407
"If that curly-headed fuck Dale
wasn't here...

1277
01:14:14,574 --> 01:14:17,035
...everything would be perfect."

1278
01:14:17,827 --> 01:14:21,039
- You take that back.
- No way. It's your fault.

1279
01:14:21,456 --> 01:14:23,249
You know what your problem is?

1280
01:14:23,416 --> 01:14:26,127
You live in a fantasy land.
You refuse to get a job...

1281
01:14:26,294 --> 01:14:29,047
...and you don't know what it's like
to work for something.

1282
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:32,801
You don't take responsibility
for your actions. This is all your fault!

1283
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:36,012
You're a mama's boy
who's too chicken to sing in public!

1284
01:14:38,014 --> 01:14:39,391
Yeah, that's right.

1285
01:14:39,557 --> 01:14:43,561
Run away, little boy, you know it's true.
Just avoid everything.

1286
01:14:44,938 --> 01:14:46,606
What are you doing?

1287
01:14:47,565 --> 01:14:50,443
- Dale broke up Mom and Dad
- Motherfucker!

1288
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:54,364
Dale broke up Mom and Dad
Dale broke up Mom and Dad

1289
01:14:54,531 --> 01:14:56,825
- Dale broke up Mom and...
- Brennan!

1290
01:15:02,205 --> 01:15:05,458
Get up, Brennan,
I know you're faking. Get up!

1291
01:15:05,625 --> 01:15:07,335
Get up!

1292
01:15:13,508 --> 01:15:14,634
Brennan?

1293
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:18,138
It's just like Cold Case Files.
It's just like Cold Case Files.

1294
01:15:18,304 --> 01:15:20,140
It's just like Cold Case Files.

1295
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:22,809
People die every day.

1296
01:15:23,226 --> 01:15:27,355
Give him a proper burial
in an unmarked grave...

1297
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:33,987
- Brennan! You're alive! Oh, my God.
- I know.

1298
01:15:34,154 --> 01:15:35,447
I'm alive.

1299
01:15:38,074 --> 01:15:41,745
- You were dead. I saw you die!
- I was faking.

1300
01:15:41,911 --> 01:15:44,330
I used ninja focus
to slow my heart rate down.

1301
01:15:45,415 --> 01:15:47,625
- What are you doing?
- I'm burying you.

1302
01:15:47,792 --> 01:15:51,337
- I'm alive. Brennan, I'm alive.
- You're waking the neighbors!

1303
01:15:51,504 --> 01:15:53,673
- Shut up!
- No. No.

1304
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:57,802
- Now I'm gonna play your drum set.
- Help me.

1305
01:15:57,969 --> 01:16:00,764
Close your eyes.
Let the dirt shower over you.

1306
01:16:01,848 --> 01:16:03,933
This is your fault.

1307
01:16:04,601 --> 01:16:09,105
Oh, I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna sleep good tonight.

1308
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,402
- Don't you touch my drums!
- Zombie!

1309
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:17,697
Zombie! Zombie!

1310
01:16:19,407 --> 01:16:20,575
Get off me, zombie.

1311
01:16:22,577 --> 01:16:23,703
Get off.

1312
01:16:36,216 --> 01:16:37,425
I'm late for school.

1313
01:16:37,592 --> 01:16:41,137
I will kiss you right on the mouth,
Kenny Rogers.

1314
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:44,557
- Just get off me.
- Hey.

1315
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:49,771
So I guess it's really over.

1316
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:52,816
I'd say you trying to bury me alive
pretty much did it.

1317
01:16:52,982 --> 01:16:55,235
You know what I just realized?

1318
01:16:55,401 --> 01:16:57,570
You've been
the one dragging me down.

1319
01:16:57,737 --> 01:17:00,824
I'm gonna go out and get a job
and an apartment...

1320
01:17:00,990 --> 01:17:03,952
...and then I'm gonna get Mom
and Dr. Doback back together.

1321
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:06,830
I'm gonna be the hero,
and you can suck on it.

1322
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:13,002
My life was perfect
before you came here.

1323
01:17:13,169 --> 01:17:17,173
Me and my dad had a perfect setup,
and you wrecked it.

1324
01:17:20,426 --> 01:17:21,469
Hey.

1325
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:25,181
We're no longer brothers.

1326
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:29,310
We never were.
We were stepbrothers.

1327
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:44,784
- That was one of your best.
- These balls fucking suck.

1328
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:47,078
All right.

1329
01:17:47,745 --> 01:17:49,747
Well, look who's here, boys.

1330
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:52,876
Can you give me a job, please?

1331
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:57,255
TJ, get an office pool going.

1332
01:17:57,630 --> 01:18:00,383
Give Ken-Doll Crotch here
two weeks, tops.

1333
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:03,386
Dr. Angel Face,
I just wanted to say thank you...

1334
01:18:03,553 --> 01:18:07,265
...for meeting me on such short notice.

1335
01:18:07,432 --> 01:18:09,767
- Don't call me Angel Face.
- I apologize.

1336
01:18:09,934 --> 01:18:14,564
I'm very alone right now, and the thing
I wanna ask you to help me...

1337
01:18:15,106 --> 01:18:17,859
To show me how I can be a grown-up.

1338
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:20,069
Do I carry
my high-school diploma around?

1339
01:18:20,236 --> 01:18:21,654
What do you do with your hair?

1340
01:18:21,821 --> 01:18:23,948
What happens
if there's inclement weather?

1341
01:18:24,115 --> 01:18:25,783
Where do you...?
What do you wear?

1342
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:27,744
Can you wash clothes
in the dishwasher?

1343
01:18:27,911 --> 01:18:30,872
I notice that there's a long gap
in your job history...

1344
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:34,834
...and it said for 22 years...

1345
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:38,129
...you went Kerouac on everyone's ass?

1346
01:18:38,296 --> 01:18:40,548
I'll be honest with you.
I really need a job.

1347
01:18:40,715 --> 01:18:43,885
And I will take any position,
as long as it doesn't involve...

1348
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:48,097
...having sex with old ladies
for money or bear traps.

1349
01:18:48,264 --> 01:18:50,808
- Those are my two bugaboos.
- Got it.

1350
01:18:50,975 --> 01:18:53,770
There's a catering business,
a temp job is open.

1351
01:18:53,937 --> 01:18:56,356
And you get to play with fire.

1352
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,055
What do you want?
This is my online-poker time.

1353
01:20:11,222 --> 01:20:13,516
I'm ready to take on
the Catalina Wine Mixer.

1354
01:20:13,683 --> 01:20:15,601
Slow down there, Speed Racer.

1355
01:20:15,768 --> 01:20:18,104
I know what it entails,
and I'm ready to nail it.

1356
01:20:18,271 --> 01:20:20,815
I want it, okay?
I want the Catalina Wine Mixer.

1357
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:22,775
- Yo, yo.
- Hey, D-man.

1358
01:20:22,942 --> 01:20:24,652
- You tell him what's up?
- I sure did.

1359
01:20:24,819 --> 01:20:26,321
- Hey.
- Hey.

1360
01:20:26,487 --> 01:20:28,948
Your brother wants a shot
at the Catalina Wine Mixer.

1361
01:20:29,115 --> 01:20:30,283
I'm ready, walking tall.

1362
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:32,160
You're ready to run with the bulls?

1363
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:36,205
I've been earning and burning,
snapping necks and cashing checks.

1364
01:20:36,706 --> 01:20:39,334
Screw it, let's let him do it.
It's a win-win for me...

1365
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,753
- ...because if you fuck up, Brennan...
- Yeah?

1366
01:20:41,919 --> 01:20:46,049
...I get to fire your ass. But if you pull it off,
I look like a genius to the board.

1367
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:48,426
- Okay?
- I get it.

1368
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:49,886
Brennan, here's the thing.

1369
01:20:50,053 --> 01:20:52,889
It's the Catalina fucking Wine Mixer,
okay?

1370
01:20:53,056 --> 01:20:55,183
Are you saying "pow"?
What are you saying?

1371
01:20:55,683 --> 01:20:59,145
It's the biggest helicopter-leasing event
in the Western Hemisphere...

1372
01:20:59,312 --> 01:21:01,314
...since 1997.

1373
01:21:01,814 --> 01:21:04,484
- Why does he keep doing that?
- I have to sell or lease...

1374
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:06,778
...at least 80 choppers to make my nut.

1375
01:21:06,944 --> 01:21:11,616
And you mess with my nut, Brennan,
Randy here is gonna eat your dick.

1376
01:21:11,783 --> 01:21:14,285
Like Kobayashi.

1377
01:21:15,828 --> 01:21:18,790
- I've seen him do it.
- You've seen him eat a penis?

1378
01:21:18,956 --> 01:21:21,834
It was in international waters,
they couldn't prosecute him.

1379
01:21:22,001 --> 01:21:24,504
I tell you now, I'll nail it.
I'll pull it off, okay?

1380
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:26,672
Wait a second,
why do you want this so bad?

1381
01:21:26,839 --> 01:21:29,342
Trying to get Mom and Dad
back together or something?

1382
01:21:29,509 --> 01:21:30,760
- Why do I want this?
- Yeah.

1383
01:21:30,927 --> 01:21:35,765
Because I wanna make bank, bro.
I wanna get ass.

1384
01:21:35,932 --> 01:21:37,683
And I wanna drive a Range Rover.

1385
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:41,562
Well, you better, Brennan.
This is the fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.

1386
01:22:00,206 --> 01:22:01,999
Nancy. Hi.

1387
01:22:02,166 --> 01:22:05,670
Hi. What are you doing here?

1388
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:07,672
Dale's working the function.

1389
01:22:07,839 --> 01:22:10,758
Guys, this is supposed to be jicama,
not bok choy.

1390
01:22:10,925 --> 01:22:11,968
Sorry, folks.

1391
01:22:13,386 --> 01:22:15,763
And I got an invitation from Brennan.

1392
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:19,058
Can you believe
Brennan put all this together?

1393
01:22:21,769 --> 01:22:24,397
And now here we all are in Catalina.

1394
01:22:24,564 --> 01:22:28,234
- It's funny, huh?
- Yeah, it's funny.

1395
01:22:28,401 --> 01:22:30,736
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey.

1396
01:22:31,904 --> 01:22:33,948
Not bad. You're nailing it.

1397
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:36,451
- Thanks, Randy. That means a lot.
- Yeah.

1398
01:22:36,617 --> 01:22:37,869
I don't know what it is...

1399
01:22:38,035 --> 01:22:40,830
...but I wanna deliver one of these
right in your suck hole.

1400
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:44,125
- Is there anything I can do?
- No. Not really. It's your face.

1401
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:46,836
Again, you're doing great.
The Catalina Wine Mixer.

1402
01:22:47,003 --> 01:22:48,880
We're having a great time, having fun.

1403
01:22:49,046 --> 01:22:51,591
You pulled it off.
But if you don't change your face...

1404
01:22:51,757 --> 01:22:53,885
- ...I'm gonna change it for you.
- Okay.

1405
01:22:54,051 --> 01:22:56,179
All I can do is take that in,
consider it...

1406
01:22:56,345 --> 01:22:59,640
...and I'll just do my best version
of whatever I think that would be.

1407
01:22:59,807 --> 01:23:02,560
I don't even hear you,
your face is driving me nuts.

1408
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:04,770
- Thanks again, though.
- Oh, tits. Hold on.

1409
01:23:05,229 --> 01:23:08,608
Hey. Hello, Catalina Wine Mixer.

1410
01:23:08,774 --> 01:23:11,277
How are you? We are Uptown Girl.

1411
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:15,281
We are California's pre-eminent
1980s Billy Joel cover band.

1412
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:17,200
"Piano Man"!

1413
01:23:17,366 --> 01:23:19,285
What did I just say, man?

1414
01:23:19,452 --> 01:23:21,245
We don't play that...

1415
01:23:21,412 --> 01:23:23,956
...so let's keep it in the '80s
and let's keep it fun.

1416
01:23:24,123 --> 01:23:25,249
You having a good time?

1417
01:23:25,416 --> 01:23:27,877
I hope you are
because sometimes life can be tough.

1418
01:23:28,044 --> 01:23:33,007
And I know that sometimes
it's hard to "Keeping the Faith."

1419
01:23:43,476 --> 01:23:45,353
You guys seem to be hitting it off.

1420
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,896
Oh, honey.

1421
01:23:47,063 --> 01:23:48,856
Oh, my God,
this is the greatest party.

1422
01:23:49,023 --> 01:23:50,274
- Hello, Robert.
- Way to go.

1423
01:23:50,441 --> 01:23:52,985
- Brennan, this is fantastic.
- Way to go.

1424
01:23:53,152 --> 01:23:54,904
So impressed.

1425
01:23:55,071 --> 01:23:57,114
- Hi, Dad. Hi, Nancy.
- Hi, Dale.

1426
01:23:57,281 --> 01:23:59,075
- Hey, Brennan.
- It's good to see you.

1427
01:23:59,242 --> 01:24:01,160
Thanks for hiring our company.

1428
01:24:01,327 --> 01:24:04,580
Easy decision. You guys have
a outstanding track record.

1429
01:24:04,956 --> 01:24:07,750
- Just like old times, huh?
- Right, it really is.

1430
01:24:07,917 --> 01:24:09,752
You still have night-vision goggles?

1431
01:24:09,919 --> 01:24:13,756
No, no. No, I had to sell those
to pay for car insurance.

1432
01:24:14,298 --> 01:24:16,300
How about you?
You still breaking boards...

1433
01:24:16,467 --> 01:24:18,511
...or kicking holes in pumpkins
or anything?

1434
01:24:18,678 --> 01:24:20,137
No.

1435
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:24,183
I did start taking baby aspirin
to reduce my risk for heart attack.

1436
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:27,186
That makes sense.
Gotta keep an eye on it.

1437
01:24:27,353 --> 01:24:30,356
- Knock off the sweets.
- Thank you.

1438
01:24:34,610 --> 01:24:37,738
It's a truly funny observation.

1439
01:24:37,905 --> 01:24:38,990
Yeah.

1440
01:24:39,156 --> 01:24:41,742
Dale, the empanadas
are starting to sweat.

1441
01:24:41,909 --> 01:24:44,120
Okay. I better run.

1442
01:24:44,287 --> 01:24:46,038
- Good to see you.
- You too.

1443
01:24:46,205 --> 01:24:49,417
- Take care, be well. Take care, Dad.
- Okay, buddy.

1444
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:51,961
- It's great to talk to him.
- Yeah.

1445
01:24:52,712 --> 01:24:53,838
I gotta go too.

1446
01:24:54,005 --> 01:24:57,133
We should do this again.
I think it was very constructive.

1447
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:03,806
- Maybe grab a bite to eat?
- Sure.

1448
01:25:03,973 --> 01:25:05,725
- Go to Outback Steakhouse.
- Okay.

1449
01:25:05,891 --> 01:25:07,518
I've grown fond of that place.

1450
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:10,896
Thank you for coming.

1451
01:25:11,063 --> 01:25:12,815
Great to see you.

1452
01:25:14,233 --> 01:25:16,694
It was very nice to see you, Robert.

1453
01:25:17,153 --> 01:25:22,658
I think Brennan organized this whole thing
to get us back together.

1454
01:25:24,577 --> 01:25:29,332
You have to excuse me.
I think that I just might cry.

1455
01:25:29,498 --> 01:25:32,877
It's the funniest thing. Bye-bye.

1456
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:39,425
"Start the Fire," buddy!

1457
01:25:39,925 --> 01:25:43,220
Come on, man.
Play something from The Stranger!

1458
01:25:43,387 --> 01:25:46,182
We strictly do '80s Joel music, sir.

1459
01:25:49,435 --> 01:25:51,437
'80s Billy Joel doo-wop sucks!

1460
01:25:51,604 --> 01:25:54,148
Listen, motherfucker,
we only sing '80s Joel!

1461
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:57,068
Take your skank hooker wife
and get the fuck out of here!

1462
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:00,112
Shit.

1463
01:26:00,279 --> 01:26:02,323
- What's wrong?
- All right. "What's wrong?"

1464
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:04,700
Get him out of here.
Get his ass out of here!

1465
01:26:04,867 --> 01:26:06,160
Hey.

1466
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:09,955
Hey, great job, fuck face. You just
busted my nut. This party's shot.

1467
01:26:10,122 --> 01:26:12,667
Just relax. I didn't realize
he would say these things.

1468
01:26:12,833 --> 01:26:17,254
You know what? You cost me money.
So this isn't even a judgment call, man.

1469
01:26:17,421 --> 01:26:20,341
- You're Audi 5000, my friend.
- Can't we talk about this?

1470
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:21,676
No.

1471
01:26:21,842 --> 01:26:23,636
- Hey.
- Shit.

1472
01:26:23,803 --> 01:26:26,597
- Is everything okay?
- No. He just fired me.

1473
01:26:26,764 --> 01:26:28,057
What happened to the music?

1474
01:26:28,224 --> 01:26:30,976
The band left. The guy freaked out.

1475
01:26:31,143 --> 01:26:32,311
Derek fired me.

1476
01:26:32,478 --> 01:26:34,772
- It's no big deal.
- Robert, you don't get it.

1477
01:26:34,939 --> 01:26:36,524
It's the Catalina Wine Mixer!

1478
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:38,943
People have killed
to be in the position I'm in.

1479
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:41,278
- It's a big deal.
- Here's a thought:

1480
01:26:41,821 --> 01:26:44,073
I see an empty stage.

1481
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,992
I see drums, I see a drummer.

1482
01:26:47,159 --> 01:26:49,537
I see a microphone, and I see a singer.

1483
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:51,163
- Dad, come on.
- What?

1484
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:53,290
- We gave that stuff up.
- We don't do that.

1485
01:26:53,457 --> 01:26:55,876
Listen to me.
Dale, look, when I was a kid...

1486
01:26:56,043 --> 01:26:59,171
...when I was a little boy,
I always wanted to be a dinosaur.

1487
01:26:59,338 --> 01:27:02,091
I wanted to be a Tyrannosaurus rex
more than anything.

1488
01:27:02,258 --> 01:27:05,136
I made my arms short
and I roamed the backyard...

1489
01:27:05,302 --> 01:27:09,014
...and I chased the neighborhood cats,
and I growled and roared.

1490
01:27:09,181 --> 01:27:11,016
Everybody knew me
and was afraid of me.

1491
01:27:11,183 --> 01:27:12,643
And then one day, my dad said:

1492
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:16,772
"Bobby, you're 17. It's time
to throw childish things aside."

1493
01:27:16,939 --> 01:27:17,982
I said, "Okay, Pop."

1494
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:22,111
But he didn't really say that, he said,
"Stop being a dinosaur and get a job."

1495
01:27:22,278 --> 01:27:25,656
But I thought to myself,
"I'll go to medical school...

1496
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:29,034
...I'll practice for a little while,
and then I'll come back to it."

1497
01:27:29,201 --> 01:27:31,120
- Dad...
- How is that a skill?

1498
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:32,830
But I forgot how to do it.

1499
01:27:32,997 --> 01:27:34,248
You're human.

1500
01:27:34,415 --> 01:27:37,251
- You could never be a dinosaur.
- Yeah.

1501
01:27:38,002 --> 01:27:40,379
Hey, I lost it.

1502
01:27:40,546 --> 01:27:42,548
- Dad, what's the point?
- Yeah.

1503
01:27:42,715 --> 01:27:45,509
The point is, don't lose your dinosaur.

1504
01:27:45,968 --> 01:27:48,804
Yeah. I hated the way
you guys were before.

1505
01:27:48,971 --> 01:27:50,222
I mean, I hated you.

1506
01:27:50,389 --> 01:27:55,186
But it just kills me to see you
so crushed and normal.

1507
01:27:55,352 --> 01:27:57,146
Listen to me, don't listen to me...

1508
01:27:57,313 --> 01:28:00,566
...Prestige Worldwide,
that's what you gotta do.

1509
01:28:00,733 --> 01:28:04,236
- You're saying we should go for it.
- That's what I'm saying.

1510
01:28:04,695 --> 01:28:06,322
What do you think, Brennan?

1511
01:28:06,489 --> 01:28:08,991
I'm so scared right now.
I'm gonna do what's sensible:

1512
01:28:09,158 --> 01:28:10,785
I'm gonna file for unemployment...

1513
01:28:10,951 --> 01:28:13,746
...and I'm gonna try to get a job
at Enterprise Rent-A-Car.

1514
01:28:13,913 --> 01:28:16,749
They got a excellent corporate structure...

1515
01:28:16,916 --> 01:28:19,919
...and they give you the tools
to be your own boss.

1516
01:28:20,085 --> 01:28:21,962
My dad's right.

1517
01:28:22,129 --> 01:28:23,672
This isn't me.

1518
01:28:23,839 --> 01:28:27,009
I'm fucking miserable.
I had to get up at 10:00 this morning.

1519
01:28:27,176 --> 01:28:31,055
And even though
I just got a tidal wave of nerves...

1520
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:32,890
...I'm going up on that stage...

1521
01:28:33,057 --> 01:28:35,601
...and I'm gonna make beautiful music
for a sad world.

1522
01:28:35,768 --> 01:28:38,103
- Dale...
- That's the boy I know.

1523
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:40,314
This crowd's gonna eat him alive.

1524
01:28:42,608 --> 01:28:44,109
What's he doing up there?

1525
01:28:44,276 --> 01:28:46,654
Somebody get him off the fucking stage!

1526
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:48,948
Hi. How you doing?

1527
01:28:49,114 --> 01:28:52,493
My name's Dale Doback,
and I hope you like to kick it.

1528
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,328
Oh, go get them, Dale!

1529
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:56,872
Boats and ho's

1530
01:28:57,039 --> 01:28:58,916
Get off the stage, you dick!

1531
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:00,793
Stop yelling at him!

1532
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,588
- Terrible!
- Terrible.

1533
01:29:04,755 --> 01:29:06,131
He's a human being.

1534
01:29:06,298 --> 01:29:10,636
Dale has a mangina
Dale has a mangina

1535
01:29:10,803 --> 01:29:11,929
No.

1536
01:29:12,096 --> 01:29:14,223
Gotta have me my boats and ho's

1537
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:16,725
He's up there alone, Brennan.
He's up there alone.

1538
01:29:18,102 --> 01:29:21,272
Gotta have me my boats and ho's

1539
01:29:21,438 --> 01:29:23,315
- You suck!
- What are you doing, Brennan?

1540
01:29:23,482 --> 01:29:24,567
Gotta have me my...

1541
01:29:24,733 --> 01:29:26,986
Brennan, no!

1542
01:29:28,028 --> 01:29:29,572
- What did you do?
- Oh, Jesus.

1543
01:29:29,738 --> 01:29:32,199
I couldn't stand to see him like that.
I miss my son.

1544
01:29:32,366 --> 01:29:36,912
All right. Let me go for a few bars.
Come in soft, but then finish strong.

1545
01:29:37,079 --> 01:29:39,081
- Okay. Hey, Brennan?
- Yeah.

1546
01:29:39,248 --> 01:29:42,251
- Thanks for coming up. Okay.
- You got it, Dragon.

1547
01:29:42,668 --> 01:29:46,839
We got a little change coming up.
It's my main man Brennan.

1548
01:30:43,228 --> 01:30:44,521
Boats and ho's

1549
01:31:02,873 --> 01:31:04,541
Boats and ho's

1550
01:31:52,131 --> 01:31:55,217
- You did it, Derek.
- I made a kite fly.

1551
01:31:55,384 --> 01:31:58,887
Brennan, you're the best big brother ever!

1552
01:32:07,312 --> 01:32:11,233
...floor mats. The ones that match
the seats, and I kind of wanted...

1553
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:13,861
I traveled 500 miles
to give you my seed.

1554
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:16,113
Lumberjack!

1555
01:32:56,695 --> 01:33:00,282
Rock the fuck out of those drums, Dale!
I'm sorry.

1556
01:33:41,615 --> 01:33:44,409
- We're Prestige Worldwide!
- Prestige Worldwide!

1557
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:48,539
- Fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.
- It's the fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.

1558
01:33:48,705 --> 01:33:51,667
It's the fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.

1559
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:53,377
Brennan, that was sublime.

1560
01:33:53,544 --> 01:33:55,796
Amazing. We are so proud of you both.

1561
01:33:55,963 --> 01:33:57,506
- Thank you.
- Incredible.

1562
01:33:57,673 --> 01:33:58,841
- Thank you so much.
- Hey.

1563
01:33:59,007 --> 01:34:02,928
So I made my quota.
Yeah, we sold a shit-ton of copters.

1564
01:34:03,095 --> 01:34:05,180
- That's so good.
- Yeah.

1565
01:34:05,347 --> 01:34:08,767
Look, I'm not great
at this Hallmark stuff...

1566
01:34:08,934 --> 01:34:11,353
...but, Brennan,
when I look at you now...

1567
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:14,857
...I don't wanna kick you
in the head quite as much.

1568
01:34:15,399 --> 01:34:16,733
Thanks, man.

1569
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:18,402
- That was beautiful.
- Nice.

1570
01:34:18,569 --> 01:34:19,945
Yeah.

1571
01:34:20,779 --> 01:34:23,157
- What do we do now?
- We could hug.

1572
01:34:23,323 --> 01:34:25,325
Yeah, you'd like that, faggot.
Sorry. I'm...

1573
01:34:28,036 --> 01:34:29,079
Okay.

1574
01:34:42,342 --> 01:34:44,261
- It's okay.
- Okay.

1575
01:34:57,816 --> 01:35:01,069
- That's what we've been looking for.
- That's the ticket.

1576
01:35:01,528 --> 01:35:02,863
It's fantastic.

1577
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:06,450
We've never done anything like that,
you can't expect it to be perfect.

1578
01:35:06,617 --> 01:35:07,659
It was good.

1579
01:35:07,826 --> 01:35:09,578
- Felt good.
- Gotten close to a hug.

1580
01:35:09,745 --> 01:35:13,957
- Hello, Brennan. Hi.
- Denise. Hey.

1581
01:35:14,124 --> 01:35:16,919
Robert, Mom, Derek,
this is my girlfriend, Denise.

1582
01:35:17,085 --> 01:35:20,172
- Hi. How are you?
- Actually, I'm his therapist.

1583
01:35:20,339 --> 01:35:23,342
- We are in absolutely no way dating.
- Right.

1584
01:35:23,508 --> 01:35:27,304
Brennan told me he was going
to hurl his body off a helicopter...

1585
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:29,598
...into shark-infested waters...

1586
01:35:29,765 --> 01:35:32,267
...so I had a legal obligation to be here.

1587
01:35:32,434 --> 01:35:33,602
I get it.

1588
01:35:33,769 --> 01:35:37,773
Don't wanna appear too eager,
and that is a good strategy too.

1589
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:41,944
- You are an enabler. You're not helping.
- And you are a keeper.

1590
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:43,904
What'd you think?

1591
01:35:44,863 --> 01:35:49,159
Brennan, I thought
you were incredibly brave.

1592
01:35:49,326 --> 01:35:50,410
And I mean that...

1593
01:35:50,577 --> 01:35:53,872
...in strictly the most clinical
and professional sense possible...

1594
01:35:54,039 --> 01:35:57,542
...with no emotional, intimate, sexual...

1595
01:35:57,709 --> 01:36:00,295
...or any other undertones
that you could infer.

1596
01:36:00,462 --> 01:36:03,131
God, you're gonna make me cry.

1597
01:36:03,799 --> 01:36:07,386
What poem is that from?
Is that James Joyce?

1598
01:36:07,552 --> 01:36:09,221
Alice...

1599
01:36:10,013 --> 01:36:12,224
- ...I like making sex with you.
- Yeah.

1600
01:36:12,391 --> 01:36:16,144
I do. But you're also married.

1601
01:36:16,561 --> 01:36:18,230
It's over.

1602
01:36:19,231 --> 01:36:20,607
This is crazy. I'm a mother.

1603
01:36:20,774 --> 01:36:23,527
I have two children,
I have a husband, a beautiful home.

1604
01:36:23,694 --> 01:36:26,780
- I can't be fucking around with you.
- It was fun.

1605
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:30,200
- It was fun while it lasted.
- I'm glad. Well, good luck.

1606
01:36:32,452 --> 01:36:36,290
- No.
- Oh, my God, Dale!

1607
01:36:36,456 --> 01:36:39,459
- Please don't leave me!
- God. Look at that whale.

1608
01:36:39,626 --> 01:36:41,253
Where?

1609
01:36:44,298 --> 01:36:45,716
Dale!

1610
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:52,931
So I was with Seal...

1611
01:36:53,098 --> 01:36:56,476
...and we were taking a chopper up
to Everest base camp...

1612
01:36:56,643 --> 01:36:58,770
- ...and the plot to my Sherpa...
- Derek.

1613
01:36:59,563 --> 01:37:01,773
- Sorry. Okay.
- Remember, we talked about this.

1614
01:37:02,316 --> 01:37:04,943
Dale, Brennan.
Tell me about the karaoke business.

1615
01:37:05,110 --> 01:37:08,071
Really great, Dad.
We call it Karaoke 'n' Roll.

1616
01:37:08,739 --> 01:37:11,825
We got six bars, three restaurants,
and two more wanna sign up.

1617
01:37:11,992 --> 01:37:14,036
- So it's booming.
- Fantastic.

1618
01:37:14,202 --> 01:37:15,954
Most karaoke it's, "Open to everyone.

1619
01:37:16,121 --> 01:37:18,332
- Hey, just get up and have fun."
- Not you guys.

1620
01:37:18,498 --> 01:37:20,876
If you can't sing, just sit down.
That's our motto.

1621
01:37:21,043 --> 01:37:23,628
- It's the big leagues.
- You guys are doing so great.

1622
01:37:23,795 --> 01:37:27,799
Guys, I have a little Christmas surprise
for Dale and Brennan.

1623
01:37:28,842 --> 01:37:30,385
- You wanna see it?
- Yes!

1624
01:37:30,552 --> 01:37:32,971
- You bet!
- Let's go look at it! Come on.

1625
01:37:33,138 --> 01:37:34,848
- Don't peek.
- I smell cookies.

1626
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:36,808
Be patient. No, no. No, no.

1627
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:40,896
- Just a piñata, isn't it?
- Be patient.

1628
01:37:41,063 --> 01:37:43,023
- Be patient.
- Did you get me a tiger, Dad?

1629
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:44,274
Okay, open your eyes.

1630
01:37:44,441 --> 01:37:45,692
Merry Christmas.

1631
01:37:45,859 --> 01:37:47,486
Holy shit!

1632
01:37:47,986 --> 01:37:51,198
Dad, I can't believe
you put the boat in the tree!

1633
01:37:51,365 --> 01:37:52,449
This is amazing!

1634
01:37:53,658 --> 01:37:56,995
- It's The Gilded Lady. She lives!
- I can't believe it.

1635
01:37:57,162 --> 01:38:01,291
- How'd you get it up here?
- Oh, Robert, it's so great.

1636
01:38:01,708 --> 01:38:03,627
- Pirate hats!
- Pirate hats!

1637
01:38:07,130 --> 01:38:08,757
- Hustlers!
- Hustlers!

1638
01:38:08,924 --> 01:38:11,051
Dad, that was so thoughtful!

1639
01:38:13,261 --> 01:38:15,972
- Crossbows!
- Crossbows!

1640
01:38:16,139 --> 01:38:19,059
You finally came to your senses
and got us something cool.

1641
01:38:19,226 --> 01:38:21,686
You both know
this is completely fucked up, right?

1642
01:38:21,853 --> 01:38:23,313
- Yeah.
- Of course.

1643
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:27,484
But Brennan sure can wear
the shit out of that pirate hat.

1644
01:38:27,651 --> 01:38:30,529
- Chewbacca masks!
- Chewbacca masks!

1645
01:38:34,157 --> 01:38:37,244
It's okay that mine's not movie-quality.

1646
01:39:03,228 --> 01:39:06,731
But he's like, "No, because you drove
my car last week, so I can't get it."

1647
01:39:06,898 --> 01:39:10,819
So I'm like, "You're gonna buy it for me
or I'm gonna sock you in the mouth."

1648
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:21,371
Oh, shit.

1649
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:30,839
Well, if it isn't Dale Doback
and his little butt buddy.

1650
01:39:31,006 --> 01:39:33,008
Sticks and stones may break my bones...

1651
01:39:33,175 --> 01:39:36,678
...but I'm gonna kick you repeatedly
in the balls, Gardocki!

1652
01:39:36,845 --> 01:39:39,222
Let's get them!

1653
01:40:25,727 --> 01:40:28,480
- Where do you think you're going?
- Home.

1654
01:40:28,647 --> 01:40:31,691
- We got something to show you.
- Come on.

1655
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:35,529
- You see that white dog crap?
- Do you see it?!

1656
01:40:35,695 --> 01:40:38,073
- Yeah.
- Not too fun down there, is it?

1657
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:39,407
- No.
- You see?

1658
01:40:39,574 --> 01:40:41,409
Your actions have consequences!

1659
01:40:41,576 --> 01:40:46,414
When you oppress people,
they rise up in a fiery anger!

1660
01:40:46,998 --> 01:40:48,667
Go home.

1661
01:40:49,918 --> 01:40:53,213
We're not like you.
We're grown-ups, motherfucker!

1662
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:57,342
Say hi to your dad.
We went to high school together.

1663
01:41:03,265 --> 01:41:05,642
The cops'll be here soon.

1664
01:41:06,518 --> 01:41:09,062
I guess this is what it feels like
to be grown up.

1665
01:41:09,229 --> 01:41:10,730
Hey.

1666
01:41:11,231 --> 01:41:12,983
Can I ask you something?

1667
01:41:13,149 --> 01:41:14,609
Yeah, of course.

1668
01:41:14,776 --> 01:41:16,528
You know back
when you first moved in?

1669
01:41:16,695 --> 01:41:17,737
Yeah.

1670
01:41:17,904 --> 01:41:20,407
- Did you touch my drum set?
- No, I didn't.

1671
01:41:20,574 --> 01:41:22,742
No, really, I won't get mad.
I just wanna know.

1672
01:41:22,909 --> 01:41:24,869
No, I know.
You said you wouldn't get mad.

1673
01:41:25,036 --> 01:41:27,747
I'm saying I didn't do it.
I didn't do it, I never did it.

1674
01:41:27,914 --> 01:41:29,749
- Then I owe you an apology.
- No.

1675
01:41:29,916 --> 01:41:31,543
No, you don't, at all. No.

1676
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:34,170
Why wouldn't you take an apology
if you didn't do it?

1677
01:41:34,337 --> 01:41:37,173
Just because I'm cool.
It doesn't matter.

1678
01:45:17,852 --> 01:45:19,270
You got my passport.

1679
01:45:20,438 --> 01:45:21,481
I'm good.

1680
01:45:25,276 --> 01:45:28,238
Don't worry, not gonna be late.
Don't worry.
