1
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,274
Who am I? You sure you wanna know?

2
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,736
The story of my life
is not for the faint of heart.

3
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,531
If somebody said
it was a happy little tale...

4
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,202
...If somebody told you I was just your
average guy, not a care in the world...

5
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,162
...somebody lied.

6
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,625
But let me assure you, this,
like any story worth telling...

7
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,210
...Is all about a girl.

8
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:35,549
That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.

9
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,802
The woman I've loved
since before I even liked girls.

10
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,638
I'd like to tell you that's me
next to her.

11
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,265
Aw, heck, I'd even take him.

12
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,728
Hey! Stop the bus!

13
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,896
That's me.

14
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,982
Tell him to stop! Please!

15
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,400
Stop!

16
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,819
Hey! Stop the bus!

17
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:59,072
Stop! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven Boulevard.

18
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,367
- Catch a cab, Parker!
- Aww...

19
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,705
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.

20
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,463
What a geek!

21
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,342
- Don't even think about it.
- You're so lame, Parker.

22
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,094
Would you date him?

23
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:24,973
Uh-uh.

24
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,364
Midtown High seniors.

25
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,202
No wandering. Proceed direct--
Knock it off.

26
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,830
Remember, it is a privilege
to be here.

27
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,459
We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.

28
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,878
So behave accordingly.

29
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,089
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.

30
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,925
Come on, people, stay together.

31
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,011
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.

32
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,224
- Where were you?
- Checking out the library.

33
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,352
- Looking at the books.
- Yeah, right.

34
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,064
Charles, can we drive
around the corner, please?

35
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,524
Why?

36
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,526
The entrance is right there.

37
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:21,404
Dad, these are public-school kids. I'm not
showing up for the field trip in the Rolls.

38
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,907
What, you want me
to trade in my car for a Jetta...

39
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:27,077
...because you flunked out of
every private school I ever sent you to?

40
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,247
- It wasn't for me.
- Of course it was.

41
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,582
Don't ever be ashamed
of who you are.

42
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,252
I'm not ashamed of who I am.

43
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,753
It's just...

44
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,380
Just what, Harry?

45
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,090
Forget it.

46
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,427
Pete!

47
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,513
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, man. What's up?

48
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,056
Harry.

49
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,433
- Won't you be needing this?
- Thanks, Dad.

50
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,770
Peter, may I introduce my father,
Norman Osborn.

51
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,355
I've heard so much about you.

52
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:59,025
- Great honor to meet you, sir.
- Harry says you're a science whiz.

53
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,112
You know,
I'm something of a scientist myself.

54
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:05,448
I read all your research
on nanotechnology. Really brilliant.

55
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,159
- And you understood it?
- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

56
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,122
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.

57
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,124
I live with my aunt and uncle.
They are proud.

58
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,877
Hey, you two! Let's move!

59
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,714
- Nice to meet you. Yeah.
- Hope to see you again.

60
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,553
- He doesn't seem so bad.
- Yeah, not if you're a genius.

61
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,680
- I think he wants to adopt you.
- Heh.

62
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:33,560
There are over 32,000 known
species of spider in the world.

63
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,479
They're in the order Araneae,
divided into three suborders.

64
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,857
Wow. That's amazing.

65
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:42,944
This is the most advanced electron
microscope on the Eastern Seaboard.

66
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,322
- It's unreal.
- Wow.

67
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,283
Arachnids
from all three groups possess...

68
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,870
...varying strengths which help them
in their constant search for food.

69
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:56,416
For example, the Delena spider,
family Sparassidae...

70
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:00,754
...has the ability to jump
to catch its prey.

71
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,506
- For the school paper?
- Mm-hm.

72
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:12,182
Next, we have the net web spider,
family Filistatidae...

73
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,267
...genus Kukulcania.

74
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:18,855
It spins an intricate funnel-shaped web
whose strands have a tensile strength...

75
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:24,319
...proportionately equal to the type
of high-tension wires used in bridges.

76
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,446
- Leave him alone.
- Or what?

77
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,448
Or his father will fire your father.

78
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,369
What's Daddy gonna do?
Sue me?

79
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,038
What is going on?

80
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,291
The next person who talks will fail
this course. I kid you not.

81
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,502
- This grass spider...
- Let's go.

82
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,839
...hunts using a set of reflexes with
nerve-conduction velocity so fast...

83
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,551
...that some researchers believe
it borders on precognition.

84
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,887
- An early awareness of danger.
- Those guys are jerks.

85
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,847
A spider-sense.

86
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,141
Hey, look at that spider.

87
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:59,729
Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.

88
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,898
It's a defense mechanism.

89
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,360
Peter, what makes you think
I would want to know that?

90
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,736
Who wouldn't?

91
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,740
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's genetic research facility...

92
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:15,286
- You gonna talk to her now?
- Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.

93
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,414
Armed with these DNA blueprints...

94
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,250
...we have now begun
what was once thought impossible.

95
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,129
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, hateful little things.

96
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,714
I love them.

97
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,924
Yeah, me too.

98
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,762
You know, spiders
can change their color...

99
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,766
- ...to blend into their environment.
- Really?

100
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:41,146
- Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
- Cool.

101
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,649
transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

102
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,944
...combining the genetic information
from all three spiders...

103
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:52,782
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

104
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,451
There's 14.

105
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,286
I beg your pardon?

106
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,538
- One's missing.
- Yeah.

107
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,706
Huh.

108
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,544
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.

109
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:08,381
Do you know that this is the largest
electron microscope...

110
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,799
...on the Eastern Seaboard?

111
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:14,012
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.

112
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,889
Let's go talk about
how we listen.

113
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:24,105
Now, I don't know what
it's like at those fancy private schools...

114
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,191
...but at Midtown High...

115
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,990
Hey.

116
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:38,411
Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.

117
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,163
- Sure. Yeah.
- Great.

118
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,540
Where do you want me?
Over here?

119
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,084
Yeah, that's great.

120
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,169
Don't make me look ugly.

121
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,379
That's impossible.

122
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,888
Perfect.

123
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,189
- Is that good?
- Great.

124
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:12,862
That's great.

125
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,703
M.J., let's go!

126
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,833
Wait. Thanks!

127
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,057
Parker, let's do it.

128
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:01,244
We solved the horizon glide
and the multi-G balance issues.

129
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,955
I've already seen the glider.

130
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,416
That's not what I'm here for.

131
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,294
General Slocum,
good to see you again.

132
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,297
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

133
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,382
- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.

134
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,094
Always a pleasure to have our
board of directors pay us a little visit.

135
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:21,723
I want to see the progress report
on human performance enhancers.

136
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,350
We tried vapor inhalation
with rodent subjects.

137
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,352
Their strength increased by 800 percent.

138
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,479
- That's excellent.
- Any side effects?

139
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,689
In one trial, yes.

140
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,536
It was an aberration. All the tests
since then have been successful.

141
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,777
And in the trial that went wrong,
what happened?

142
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,446
What were the side effects?

143
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,948
Violence, aggression...

144
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,867
...and insanity.

145
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,786
- What do you recommend?
- That was only one test.

146
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,874
Except for Dr. Stromm,
our entire staff certifies the product...

147
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,960
- ...ready for human testing.
- Dr. Stromm?

148
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,923
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

149
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,636
- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.

150
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,639
I'll be frank with you.

151
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:07,727
I never supported your program. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.

152
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,647
Norman, the general gave
the go-ahead to Quest Aerospace...

153
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,733
...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton design.

154
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,654
- They test in two weeks.
- And if your performance enhancers...

155
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,242
...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...

156
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:26,871
...I'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.

157
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,333
Gentlemen. Ladies.

158
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:40,843
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voila! There is light.

159
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,179
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

160
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:47,433
Mm. Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.

161
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,937
Heh, heh. I'm already on my ass, May.

162
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:55,608
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years...

163
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,486
...what else would you call it?
I am on my ass.

164
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,030
Hand me that dish.
The green one.

165
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,033
The corporation is downsizing
the people...

166
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,369
...and upsizing their profits.

167
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,706
Oh, Ben,
you'll get another job somewhere.

168
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:13,459
Yeah, well...
Well, let's look in the paper and see.

169
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,380
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

170
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,173
Computer.

171
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:23,136
Computer salesman, computer engineer,
computer analyst.

172
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:27,056
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

173
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:32,645
May, I'm 68. I'm too old for computers,
and besides, I have a family to provide for.

174
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,732
I love you. And Peter loves you.

175
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,235
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.

176
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,739
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.

177
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:43,906
Yeah.

178
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:49,329
Oh. Hi, sweetie. You're just--
Just in time for dinner.

179
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,081
Hey. How you doing, buddy?
How was the field trip?

180
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,084
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

181
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,754
- You won't have a bite?
- No thanks. Had a bite.

182
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,340
Did you get some pictures, Peter?

183
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,010
Uh-- I gotta crash. Everything's fine.

184
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,013
What's that all about?

185
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,495
In this recombination lab...

186
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:35,291
...we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

187
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,544
...combining the genetic
information from all three spiders...

188
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:43,549
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

189
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,984
Dr. Osborn, please.
The performance enhancers aren't ready.

190
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,488
The data just doesn't justify
this test.

191
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:09,325
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.

192
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,702
Don't be a coward.

193
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,747
Risks are part of laboratory science.

194
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:18,668
Let me reschedule, with
a proper medical staff and a volunteer.

195
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,338
- Just give me two weeks.
- Two weeks? In two weeks...

196
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:26,008
...we'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.

197
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,928
Sometimes you gotta
do things yourself.

198
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,764
- Get me the Promachloraperazine.
- For what?

199
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,977
It begins catalyzation when the vapor
hits the bloodstream.

200
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,273
Forty thousand years of evolution...

201
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,193
...and we've barely even tapped
the vastness of human potential.

202
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,375
Oh, that's cold.

203
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,101
Norman?

204
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,899
Norman!

205
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,109
Norman!

206
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:16,953
Oh, my God.

207
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,582
Oh, my God! Norman?

208
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,377
Oh, my God! Norman!

209
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,713
Norman.

210
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,978
Back to formula?

211
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,514
Weird.

212
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,818
- Peter?
- Yeah?

213
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,069
Are you all right?

214
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,237
Uh...

215
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,324
I'm fine.

216
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,743
Any better this morning? Any change?

217
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,578
Change?

218
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,205
Yep. Big change.

219
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:47,460
- Well, hurry up. You'll be late.
- Right.

220
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,146
Okay.

221
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:15,655
- Goodness me!
- Jeez. Heh. I thought you were sick.

222
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,531
- I got better.
- You see?

223
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,077
- Bye, guys.
- Have you got your lunch money?

224
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,914
Hey, Michelangelo, don't forget, we're
painting the kitchen right after school.

225
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,875
Sure thing, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.

226
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,126
And don't start up with me.

227
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:35,424
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.

228
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:40,096
You're trash! You're always gonna
be trash, just like her!

229
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,849
- I have to go to school.
- Ah, who's stopping you?

230
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,910
Hi, M.J.

231
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,287
Hey, M.J.

232
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:10,042
I don't know if you realize this, but
we've been neighbors since I was 6.

233
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,795
And I was wondering if maybe
we could get together sometime?

234
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,339
Hey, M.J., I got the car. Hop in.

235
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,134
Do something fun? Or, I don't know.

236
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,053
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.

237
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,681
Or not.

238
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,856
- Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!
- Hey!

239
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,065
Hey!

240
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,276
- Stop the bus!
- Catch a cab!

241
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,987
Tell him to stop.

242
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,656
- Check him out!
- Dork!

243
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,388
Dad.

244
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,724
Dad, are you all right?

245
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,851
Harry.

246
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,190
What are you doing on the floor?

247
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,691
I don't know.

248
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,361
- Have you been there all night?
- Uh--

249
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,114
Last night I was--

250
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,701
What?

251
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,704
- I don't remember.
- Mr. Osborn?

252
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,248
Sir, I asked her to wait
in the foyer.

253
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:35,795
- Sorry, my father's not feeling well.
- Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.

254
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:36,962
What?

255
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,674
They found his body this morning
in the lab. He's been murdered, sir.

256
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,051
What are you talking about?

257
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,178
And the flight suit and the glider...

258
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,430
- What about it?
- It's been stolen, sir.

259
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,124
Wow! Great reflexes!

260
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,169
- Thanks.
- No problem.

261
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:22,174
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.

262
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,593
You just get contacts?

263
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,477
Well, see you.

264
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:18,814
- What happened?
- He's freaking weird.

265
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:20,649
Did you see that?

266
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,903
Parker?

267
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,103
- It's a fight!
- Think you're pretty funny, freak?

268
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,315
- Flash, it was an accident.
- So is my fist breaking your teeth.

269
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,193
- Come on, Flash, stop.
- I don't wanna fight you, Flash.

270
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,820
- I wouldn't wanna fight me neither.
- Kick his ass, man.

271
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,915
Huh.

272
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,212
Whoa!

273
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,050
Help him, Harry.

274
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,637
Whoa!

275
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,556
How'd he do that?

276
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,892
Which one?

277
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,435
He's all yours, man.

278
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,661
Flash, get up!

279
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:00,416
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.

280
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,752
Peter, that was--
That was amazing.

281
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,755
I'm out of here. Come on.

282
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,093
Peter!

283
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,536
Woo-hoo!

284
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,505
Ya-hoo!

285
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,633
Whoo! Whoo!

286
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:52,945
Go, web!

287
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,198
Fly.

288
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,868
Up, up and away, web.

289
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,871
Shazam!

290
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:04,706
Go! Go!

291
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,708
Go, web, go!

292
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:41,577
Tallyho.

293
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,081
- Is she back with the beer yet?
- What?

294
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,541
Bring me some beer!

295
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,294
- Get up off your ass!
- I paid for beer--

296
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,962
- Stop yelling.
- Stop it!

297
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,465
You're as stupid as your mother.
Get away from me!

298
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,258
You are drunk, do you know that?

299
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:41,678
Where's she going? Where you going?

300
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:45,349
These dishes are not done.
Somebody's gotta do the dishes.

301
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,852
- Why don't you do them?
- Get in here and do the dishes.

302
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,688
You do them. They're yours, anyway.

303
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,190
I'm going out!

304
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,901
- Were you listening to that?
- No.

305
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:59,488
Well, I heard, but I was
just taking out the trash.

306
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:02,407
- I guess you can always hear us.
- Well...

307
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,868
...everybody shouts.

308
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,328
Your aunt and uncle don't.

309
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,207
Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.

310
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,879
Listen, M.J., about today
at school with Flash--

311
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,714
You really freaked us out.

312
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,217
I'm sorry. Is he okay?

313
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:24,471
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.

314
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,769
So where are you going
after you graduate?

315
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,231
I, uh...

316
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:37,818
I wanna move into the city.

317
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:43,532
And hopefully get a job
as a photographer.

318
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,284
Work my way through college.

319
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:48,870
What about you?

320
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,039
Headed for the city too.

321
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,001
Can't wait to get out of here.

322
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,670
I wanna...

323
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,423
What?

324
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,428
No, come on. Try me.

325
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:06,930
I wanna...

326
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,391
...act...

327
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,060
...on-stage.

328
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:13,562
Really?

329
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,940
Oh, that's perfect.

330
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,776
You were awesome
in all the school plays.

331
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,945
- Really?
- Yeah.

332
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,574
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.

333
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,285
Peter, that was first grade.

334
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,287
Well...

335
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,331
...even so.

336
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,250
Sometimes...

337
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,753
...you know people.

338
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,507
You can just see what's coming.

339
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:48,347
What do you see coming for you?

340
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,601
I don't know.

341
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:59,608
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.

342
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,114
And what for me?

343
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,616
For you?

344
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,452
You're gonna light up Broadway.

345
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,623
You know...

346
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,837
...you're taller than you look.

347
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,340
I hunch.

348
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,094
Don't.

349
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:34,226
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.

350
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,561
Come on.

351
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,980
I gotta go.

352
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:40,982
Bye.

353
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,319
- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
- Yeah, right?

354
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,488
- Look at it!
- Hop in.

355
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:48,907
Oh, my God! What a cool car!

356
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,742
Pretty tight, huh?

357
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:55,455
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.

358
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,998
- Woo-hoo!
- Whoo!

359
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,500
Cool car.

360
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,258
Peter?

361
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,261
What's going on in there?

362
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,097
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.

363
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,935
Well, you're acting so strangely, Peter.

364
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,312
Okay. Thanks.

365
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,611
Phew.

366
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,471
Something's bothering him. Maybe he's
too embarrassed to tell me what it is.

367
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:19,307
Maybe I'm too embarrassed
to ask him.

368
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,143
I just don't know anymore.

369
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,896
I'm going to the downtown library.
I'll see you later.

370
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,692
- Wait, Pete. I'll drive you there, buddy.
- No, I'll take the train.

371
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:32,112
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go.

372
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,626
- Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
- Wait a minute, we need to talk.

373
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:51,172
- We can talk later.
- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.

374
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,259
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?

375
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,303
Because we haven't talked
at all for so long.

376
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,471
Your Aunt May and I
don't know who you are anymore.

377
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:03,685
You shirk your chores. You have
all those weird experiments in your room.

378
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:07,981
- You start fights at school--
- I didn't start that fight, I told you that.

379
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:11,151
- You sure as hell finished it.
- Was I supposed to run away?

380
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,362
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but--

381
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,406
Pete, look, you're changing. I know.

382
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:19,075
I went through exactly the same thing
at your age.

383
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,827
No. Not exactly.

384
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,120
Peter...

385
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,956
...these are the years
when a man changes...

386
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:29,544
...into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life.

387
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:32,005
Just be careful
who you change into.

388
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:38,845
This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably deserved what happened.

389
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,098
But just because you can
beat him up...

390
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,809
...doesn't give you the right to.

391
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:50,732
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.

392
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:54,653
Are you afraid that I'm gonna
turn into some kind of criminal?

393
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,321
Quit worrying about me, okay?

394
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,908
Something's different. I'll figure it out.
Stop lecturing me. Please.

395
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,661
I don't mean to lecture
and I don't mean to preach.

396
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,412
And I know I'm not your father--

397
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,415
Then stop pretending to be!

398
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:12,754
Right.

399
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,676
I'll pick you up here at 10.

400
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,498
Ooh!

401
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,754
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

402
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:03,513
- One, two, three. That's it!
- Who's the man?

403
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,057
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

404
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,475
Yeah.

405
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,853
Ladies and gentlemen...

406
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:14,566
...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.

407
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:21,322
For $3000...

408
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:25,118
...is there no one here man enough
to stay in the ring...

409
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:29,998
...for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?

410
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,669
Who?

411
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,796
I know who.

412
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:40,133
The Flying Dutchman!

413
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,595
Next.

414
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:47,724
There's no featherweight division
here, small fry. Next.

415
00:37:47,891 --> 00:37:49,726
No, no. Sign me up.

416
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:53,563
Okay. You understand
the NYWL is not responsible...

417
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:57,859
...for any injury you may and probably will
sustain while participating in said event?

418
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,320
And you're participating
under your own free will?

419
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:01,529
Yes.

420
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:05,492
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.

421
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,330
Told you! Told you!

422
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,332
Winner!

423
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,750
Next victim!

424
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,505
Are you ready for more?

425
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:23,218
Bone Saw is ready!

426
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:30,308
Will the next victim
please enter the arena at this time?

427
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:35,230
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...

428
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:39,859
...the sum of $3000 will be paid to--

429
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,738
- What's your name, kid?
- The Human Spider.

430
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,699
"The Human Spider"?
That's it? That's the best you got?

431
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,993
- Yeah.
- Oh, that sucks.

432
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,665
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...

433
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:57,085
...the terrifying, the deadly...

434
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,547
...the amazing Spider-Man!

435
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:04,300
My name's "The Human Spider."

436
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,718
I don't care, get out there.

437
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,763
- No, he got my name wrong.
- Get out there, you moron.

438
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,768
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out, little man.

439
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,062
I hope you brought your mommy.

440
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:19,774
- We'll break you!
- You'll need someone to cry to.

441
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:26,197
I'm gonna rip all eight of
your feeble legs off one by one.

442
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,741
Oh, my God!

443
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,577
Oh, my legs!

444
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,371
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.

445
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,374
Kill! Kill! Kill!

446
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,676
Cage!

447
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,437
Hello? Guys?

448
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:03,484
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?

449
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:08,489
Hey, listen, this is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

450
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:12,160
Hey! Unlock the thing!
Take the chain off!

451
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:16,998
Hey, freak show! You're going nowhere.

452
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,542
I got you for three minutes.

453
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:22,003
Three minutes of playtime.

454
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,550
Ooh!

455
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,429
- What are you doing up there?
- Staying away from you.

456
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,891
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?

457
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,104
Ooh!

458
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,025
Finish him off!

459
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,283
Smash him!

460
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,037
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

461
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,209
- Hit him!
- Harder!

462
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:06,589
- Yeah!
- Kick his spider ass! Yeah!

463
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,716
Hit him!

464
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,940
One, two, three!

465
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,943
That's it! That's it! Winner!

466
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,737
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for the new champion...

467
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,198
...Spider-Man!

468
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:36,744
Spider-Man! Spider-Man! Spider-Man!

469
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,259
Now get out of here.

470
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,722
A hundred bucks?
The ad said 3000.

471
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,307
Well, check it again, web head.

472
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:02,353
It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.

473
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:05,940
For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.

474
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,483
I need that money.

475
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:11,029
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

476
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,457
- Hey, what the hell--?
- Put the money in the bag.

477
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,626
Hurry up!

478
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,052
Hey! He stole the gate!

479
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,179
Stop that guy!

480
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:39,015
Stop him! He's got my money!

481
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,475
Thanks.

482
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,145
What's the hell's the matter with you?
You let him go!

483
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,522
Cut him off in the lobby
and call the cops!

484
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:50,735
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he'll get away with my money.

485
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,154
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

486
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,593
- Sir, you gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?

487
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,221
Old dude, man.

488
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:22,600
Come on, folks. Keep moving,
please. Keep moving. Let's go!

489
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,603
- What happened?
- Someone got hurt.

490
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,192
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Stay back.

491
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,528
- Stay back! Stay back!
- That's my uncle!

492
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,407
- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.

493
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,994
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

494
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,538
Uncle Ben?

495
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:45,998
Uncle Ben.

496
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,087
Uncle Ben?

497
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,217
Peter.

498
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,886
I'm here, Uncle Ben.

499
00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:05,977
Peter.

500
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,751
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth Avenue.

501
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,673
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.

502
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:17,924
Whoa.

503
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:53,167
Whoa.

504
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,050
Whoo!

505
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:09,475
Whoo!

506
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:11,018
Hey! Hey!

507
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,707
Get a unit to the rear!

508
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,295
I got the back!

509
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,601
Who's there?

510
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,922
Don't hurt me. Just give me a chance.
Just give me a chance!

511
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:07,593
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?

512
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:09,303
- Ow!
- Answer me!

513
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,974
Stop that guy!

514
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,148
Thanks.

515
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,159
See you.

516
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:34,120
Ow! Ow!

517
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:36,789
No.

518
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:57,309
Freeze! We've
got the place completely surrounded.

519
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,396
Oh, no. My God. Oh...

520
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:48,068
Oh, no. Oh, my God. No!

521
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,371
- Good evening.
- General. Good to see you.

522
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:03,042
Our exoskeleton's got real firepower,
General Slocum.

523
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:07,129
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.

524
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,757
Eighteen. Seventeen. Sixteen...

525
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:11,133
He's clear, let's go!

526
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,885
You're confident about this test?

527
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,346
Absolutely.
Captain Curtis is our top pilot.

528
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,849
Now, what about your commitment
to OSCORP?

529
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,895
Nothing would please me more than
to put Norman Osborn out of business.

530
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,317
Pref light complete. Mark.

531
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,074
We are picking
up an unidentified object, closing fast.

532
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,368
- What the hell is that?
- Can you see anything?

533
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:39,828
Oh, my God!

534
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:52,967
- Say "chess."
- Chess!

535
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,386
- Peter. Oh...
- Oh.

536
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:59,473
Darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.

537
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,727
Pete? Good news. My father got the place
in New York, so we're all set this fall.

538
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,479
- That's great.
- You made it.

539
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:11,569
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.

540
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:15,155
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Dad.

541
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:18,117
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.

542
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:19,868
Yeah.

543
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:26,208
I know this has been
a difficult time for you...

544
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:29,003
...but I want you to try
to enjoy this day.

545
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,380
Commencement:

546
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:35,676
The end of one thing,
the start of something new.

547
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:39,346
- Maybe I don't want to be with you.
- I don't want to be with you.

548
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:41,181
Here's your ring.

549
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,934
You know what? Whatever.

550
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,936
Your loss.

551
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:50,190
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.

552
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,319
And if you ever need anything,
just give me a call.

553
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,501
Can I--? Can I fix you something?

554
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,212
No, thanks.

555
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:59,134
I missed him a lot today.

556
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,055
I know.

557
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,642
I miss him too.

558
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,729
But he was there.

559
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:19,113
I can't help thinking about
the last thing I said to him.

560
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:24,326
He tried to tell me something important,
and I threw it in his face.

561
00:53:26,078 --> 00:53:28,163
You loved him...

562
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,084
...and he loved you.

563
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,630
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.

564
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:40,259
How you were meant
for great things.

565
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:43,137
You won't disappoint him.

566
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:20,841
With great power
comes great responsibility.

567
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:24,219
Remember that, Pete.
Remember that.

568
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,522
Hurry up!

569
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:49,995
This is not a man.
My brother saw him...

570
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:51,765
...building a nest
in the Lincoln Center fountain.

571
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:55,000
I think he's human. I think he's a man.
Could be a woman.

572
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,840
Bobby. Get a load of this!

573
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:04,968
Whoo!

574
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:07,054
He throws up his hands,
ropes come out...

575
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:09,264
...and he climbs up the ropes
like a spider web.

576
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,725
I see the web, and it's his signature...

577
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,685
...and I know Spider-Man was here.

578
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,480
The guy protects us.
You know, he protects the people.

579
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:19,399
Ah, some kind of freakyloo
or something. Wackadoo.

580
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:21,568
He stinks and I don't like him.

581
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,904
- Aah.
- Don't move, lady!

582
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,748
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.

583
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,084
He has those tights
and that tight little--

584
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:40,587
♪ Dresses like a spider
He looks like a bug ♪

585
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:44,550
♪ But we should all just give him
One big hug ♪

586
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:49,346
♪ Look out, ooh
Here comes the Spider-Man ♪♪

587
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:56,770
"Who is Spider-Man?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.

588
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:59,982
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

589
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,943
Mr. Jameson, your wife is on line one.

590
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,528
There's a page six problem.

591
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,613
We have a page one problem.
Shut up.

592
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,323
- Well?
- He's news.

593
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,951
- The clients can't wait.
- They're about to.

594
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:15,205
- He pulled six people off a subway.
- From a wreck he probably caused.

595
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,183
Something goes wrong,
this creepy crawler is there.

596
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,543
Look at that. He's fleeing the scene.
What's that tell you?

597
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,462
He's not fleeing, he's probably
going to save somebody else.

598
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,630
He's a hero!

599
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,633
Then why does he wear a mask? Hm?
What's he got to hide?

600
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,761
She needs to know if you want
chintz or chenille in the dining room.

601
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,472
- Whichever one's cheaper.
- Mr. Jameson, it's like this:

602
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,974
We double-booked page six.

603
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:36,476
See, so both Macy's
and Conway's both have three quarters--

604
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:39,771
- We sold out four printings.
- Sold out?

605
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,189
Every copy.

606
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,335
Tomorrow, Spider-Man, page one,
with a decent picture this time.

607
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,296
- Move Conway to page seven.
- That's a problem.

608
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,655
Make it page eight, give him
10 percent off. Five percent.

609
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,532
- That can't be done.
- Get out of here!

610
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,659
Problem is,
we don't have a decent picture.

611
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,537
Eddie's been on it for weeks.
We can barely get a glimpse of him.

612
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:57,831
Aw, what is he, shy?

613
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:00,101
If we can get a picture
of Julia Roberts in a thong...

614
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,002
...we can get a picture of this weirdo.

615
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:05,589
"Cash for a picture of Spider-Man."

616
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:09,217
He doesn't wanna be famous?
I'll make him infamous!

617
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,521
Hey!

618
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:23,106
Buzz off.

619
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,151
- M.J., it's me, Peter.
- Hi.

620
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:28,028
Hey.

621
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:31,865
- What are you doing around here?
- Begging for a job. How about you?

622
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:37,579
- Oh. I'm headed to an audition.
- An audition? So you're acting now?

623
00:57:37,746 --> 00:57:38,789
Yeah.

624
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:42,876
I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.

625
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:44,211
That's great, M.J.

626
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:47,214
- You're doing it. Living your dream.
- Glamour girl!

627
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,800
- Yeah.
- Your drawer was short $6.

628
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,594
Next time that happens,
I'll take it out of your check.

629
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:57,474
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!

630
00:57:57,683 --> 00:57:59,977
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.

631
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:04,272
It better not happen no more,
you hear me? Don't roll your eyes at me.

632
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,364
Some dream, huh?

633
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:16,451
That's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

634
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:19,413
- Don't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry?

635
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:23,375
Aren't you guys living together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

636
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,420
Oh, yeah. Right.

637
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,756
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.

638
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:34,344
- He'd think it was low or something.
- It's not low. You have a job.

639
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:39,016
You know, Harry, he doesn't live
on a little place I like to call Earth.

640
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,436
No, I guess not.

641
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:49,026
Thanks, Pete.

642
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,362
We should catch up sometime.

643
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:59,119
Let's get some lunch
some evening.

644
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:04,875
Uh-- Well, I'll come by and have some
of your Moondance coffee some day.

645
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,794
- And I won't tell Harry.
- No, don't tell Harry.

646
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,212
I won't.

647
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,133
I won't tell Harry.

648
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,897
Timing's perfect. Hey.

649
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:29,775
Five new contracts. It'll be great.

650
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:35,197
Storming Norman's
making his weekly inspection.

651
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:38,283
Spent half of it on the phone.

652
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:43,580
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help. I'm really lost here.

653
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,707
Are you all right?

654
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:50,420
You look like you just got
second place in the science fair.

655
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,005
No, I, uh...

656
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:55,801
I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.

657
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,552
You were late again?

658
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:00,931
I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?

659
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,558
Around.

660
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,435
Peter Parker.

661
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:08,271
- Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
- Who's that?

662
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,483
- This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
- Dad.

663
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,568
- When do I get to meet her?
- Dad.

664
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:17,030
Well, sorry.
Harry hasn't mentioned her.

665
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:23,161
Hey, Pete, you're probably looking
for a job now, right?

666
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,206
Dad, maybe you can
help him out.

667
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:30,710
- No, I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
- It's no problem. I'll make a few calls.

668
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:35,173
No, I couldn't accept it, sir.
I like to earn what I get. I'll find work.

669
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,008
I respect that.

670
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,845
You want to make it
on your own steam.

671
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:41,847
That's great.

672
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:45,058
What other skills do you have, Parker?

673
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:47,894
I was thinking of something
in photography.

674
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,606
Hello.

675
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:55,819
Let's go! Move it!

676
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,655
Watch the street!

677
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:01,908
Whoo!

678
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,289
Whoa!

679
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,547
Cheese!

680
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,682
They're crap.

681
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:28,852
Crap, crap. Megacrap.

682
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,520
I'll give you $200 for all of them.

683
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:33,315
- That seems a little low.
- Take them somewhere else, then.

684
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,902
Your wife says the tile
for the foyer is out of stock.

685
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,695
Tell her we'll put a rug there.

686
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,031
Sit down. Give me that.

687
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,160
Give you 300.
That's the standard freelance fee.

688
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:47,662
- Tear up page one. Run that photo.
- Headline?

689
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:51,249
"Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Daily Bugle Photos."

690
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,168
Menace? He was protecting
that armored--

691
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:56,135
Tell you what, Atticus. You take
the pictures, I'll make the headlines.

692
01:01:56,296 --> 01:01:57,339
Okay? That okay with you?

693
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,507
- Yes, sir.
- Goody.

694
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:03,470
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.

695
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,723
- I'd like a job, sir.
- No jobs. Freelance.

696
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:08,558
Best thing for a kid your age.

697
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:11,269
You bring me more shots
of that newspaper-selling clown...

698
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,271
...maybe I'll take them off your hands.

699
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:16,233
But I never said you have a job.
Meat.

700
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,526
I'll send you a box of Christmas meat.
Best I can do.

701
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,695
Get out of here. Bring me more photos.

702
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,490
- Hi.
- Hi.

703
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:26,660
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.

704
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:31,331
- Ah. Welcome to the Daily Bugle.
- Thank you.

705
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,250
I'm Peter Parker.

706
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,921
I'm a photographer.

707
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,258
Yes. I can see that.

708
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:54,980
As of today, OSCORP Industries
has surpassed Quest Aerospace...

709
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:59,651
...as the principal supplier
to the United States military.

710
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:02,654
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...

711
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:05,991
...costs are down,
revenues are up...

712
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:09,077
...and our stock
has never been higher.

713
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:11,371
Wonderful news, Norman. Wonderful.

714
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:14,582
As a matter of fact, it's the reason
we're selling the company.

715
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:15,750
What?

716
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:21,131
Yes. Quest is recapitalizing in the wake
of the bombing. Expanding.

717
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:24,092
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.

718
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:25,427
Why wasn't I told?

719
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:29,681
The last thing they want is a power
struggle with entrenched management.

720
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:32,267
The deal is off if you come with it.

721
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:35,854
The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.

722
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:38,023
You can't do this to me.

723
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:43,486
I started this company.

724
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,948
You know how much I sacrificed?!

725
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:56,249
- Oh, Max. Please.
- Norman, the board is unanimous.

726
01:03:56,791 --> 01:04:00,795
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

727
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,464
I'm sorry.

728
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,592
You're out, Norman.

729
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:16,978
Am I?

730
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:24,110
Welcome to
OSCORP Industries Unity Day Festival.

731
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,905

742
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:12,367
Just, I wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.

743
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:17,038
Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what. You think I'm pretty.

M.J., would you do me a favor?
I forgot my drink inside. Come on.

750
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:48,403
- Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
- Oh, Harry.

751
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:52,031
- Have you seen my father around?
- Uh...

752
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:54,659
...well, I'm not sure if he's, uh,
coming today.

753
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:09,174
- What is that?
- Must be new this year.

754
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,305
What is that?

755
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:16,556
That's our glider!

756
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,277
What the hell was that?

757
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,098
Code three!

758
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:17,283
- Oh, my God! Harry!
- M.J.!

759
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:26,709
Harry! Help me! Harry!

760
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:34,425
Out, am I?

761
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:41,057
- Mary Jane!
- Harry!

762
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:46,896
- Hello, my dear.
- Aah!

763
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:49,274
- It's Spider-Man!
- Huh?

764
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:02,370
- Come on, move, kid.
- Come on, Billy!

765
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:08,876
Somebody help him! No!

766
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:13,006
Mommy!

767
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:16,968
- Hold it!
- I surrender.

768
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:20,054
- Oh, boy.
- Hold it right there!

769
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,103
Impressive.

770
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:36,237
Ah...

771
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:54,839
- Mary Jane!
- Help! Someone please help me!

772
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:21,240
Hold on!

773
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:23,910
Watch out!

774
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:36,839
We'll meet again, Spider-Man!

775
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:40,343
Hold on, Mary Jane!

776
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:25,012
Whoo! Well, beats taking
the subway.

777
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,433
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.

778
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:29,767
Wait.

779
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:31,185
Who are you?

780
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:33,938
- You know who I am.
- I do?

781
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:36,149
Your friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man.

782
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,991
Whoo-hoo!

783
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:52,373
Incredible?
What do you mean, he's incredible?

784
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:57,211
No. All right, wait.
Stay there. I'm gonna come over.

785
01:10:57,879 --> 01:10:59,547
No, I'm gonna come--

786
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:03,301
All right. Fine. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?

787
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:06,471
And we'll go and have breakfast
and, um...

788
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:08,931
I wanna buy you something.

789
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:12,435
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.

790
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:17,148
Okay. And what do you mean,
incredible?

791
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:22,361
All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.

792
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:23,780
Don't let the bedbugs--

793
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:32,997
She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.

794
01:11:33,164 --> 01:11:34,499
Yeah.

795
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:38,336
Look, Pete, I should have
told you about us.

796
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:42,340
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.

797
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:45,551
It's just, you know,
you never made a move.

798
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:48,137
You're right.

799
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,556
I didn't.

800
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,979
I'm gonna get some rest.

801
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:00,483
I'm gonna stay up for a while.

802
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,319
What was that thing?

803
01:12:03,903 --> 01:12:09,116
I don't know. Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.

804
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:27,593
Somebody there?

805
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,887
Somebody.

806
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:32,765
Who said that?

807
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:36,769
Don't play the innocent with me.

808
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:41,899
You've known all along.

809
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:47,280
Where are you?

810
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:51,576
Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.

811
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,209
I'm right here.

812
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:03,963
I don't understand.

813
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:08,134
Did you think it was coincidence?

814
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:11,929
So many good things,
all happening for you.

815
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:15,766
All for you. Norman.

816
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:19,729
What do you want?

817
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:22,315
To say what you won't.

818
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:25,151
To do what you can't.

819
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:29,906
To remove those in your way.

820
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,828
The board members.

821
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,497
You killed them.

822
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:40,291
We Killed them.

823
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:41,626
We?

824
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:43,336
Remember?

825
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:46,172
Your little accident in the laboratory.

826
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,800
The performance enhancers.

827
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:55,014
Bingo. Me.
Your greatest creation.

828
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:59,310
Bringing you
what you've always wanted:

829
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:02,355
Power beyond your wildest dreams.

830
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:05,024
And it's only the beginning.

831
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:10,863
There's only one who can stop us.

832
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:15,159
Or imagine if he joined us.

833
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:23,042
Spider-Man. And the Green Goblin.

834
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:26,545
The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.

835
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:28,339
These weirdos
all gotta have a name now.

836
01:14:28,506 --> 01:14:29,826
- Mr. Jameson, Spider--
- Hoffman!

837
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:30,883
Yeah?

838
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,863
Call the patent office.
Copyright the name "Green Goblin."

839
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:37,807
- I want a quarter every time it's said.
- How about "Green Meanie"?

840
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:42,162
Spider-Man wasn't attacking the city.
He was trying to save it. That's slander.

841
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:44,563
It is not. I resent that.

842
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:47,566
Slander is spoken.
In print, it's libel.

843
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:49,535
You don't trust anybody.
That's your problem.

844
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,612
I trust my barber.

845
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:54,003
What are you, his lawyer?
Get out of here.

846
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:56,283
Let him sue me,
get rich like a normal person.

847
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,202
That's what made this country--

848
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:09,547
Jameson, you slime.

849
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:13,050
Who's the photographer who takes
the pictures of Spider-Man?

850
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:15,094
I don't know.
His stuff comes in the mail.

851
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:17,179
- You're lying!
- I swear.

852
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,348
He's the one
who can bring me to him.

853
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:22,435
- I don't know who he is.
- You are useless.

854
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:24,895
Set him down, tough guy.

855
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:26,564
Speak of the devil.

856
01:15:26,731 --> 01:15:29,150
Spider-Man. I knew you two
were in this together!

857
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:32,528
Hey, kiddo, let Mom
and Dad talk for a minute, will you?

858
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:35,197
Sleep.

859
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:53,674
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.

860
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:58,262
No, you're not dead yet.

861
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,639
Just paralyzed...

862
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,767
...temporarily.

863
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:06,854
You're an amazing creature,
Spider-Man.

864
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:09,732
You and I are not so different.

865
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:13,778
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.

866
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,864
Well, to each his own.

867
01:16:17,031 --> 01:16:19,992
I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.

868
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:25,289
And they found you amusing for a while,
the people of this city.

869
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:28,751
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...

870
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:32,546
...is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.

871
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:37,343
In spite of everything you've done
for them, eventually, they will hate you.

872
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:38,511
Why bother?

873
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:43,432
- Because it's right.
- Here's the real truth.

874
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:46,852
There are eight million people
in this city.

875
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:51,357
And those teeming masses exist
for the sole purpose...

876
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:55,528
...of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.

877
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:57,113
You, me...

878
01:16:57,696 --> 01:16:59,615
...we're exceptional.

879
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:04,537
I could squash you
like a bug right now.

880
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:08,374
But I'm offering you a choice. Join me.

881
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:12,169
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

882
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:15,131
What we could create.

883
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:17,716
Or we could destroy.

884
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:21,846
Cause the deaths of countless innocents
in selfish battle...

885
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:24,473
...again and again and again
until we're both dead.

886
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,934
Is that what you want?

887
01:17:28,936 --> 01:17:31,814
Think about it, hero.

888
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:46,453
In spite of everything
you've done for them...

889
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,123
...eventually, they will hate you.

890
01:17:58,257 --> 01:17:59,258
Hey!

891
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:01,135
- It's me again.
- Hey.

892
01:18:01,302 --> 01:18:02,720
How was your audition?

893
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:05,931
- How'd you know?
- The hotline. Your mom...

894
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:08,058
...told my aunt, told me.

895
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:09,852
So you just came by?

896
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:13,689
I was in the neighborhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.

897
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:17,568
I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighborhood, but...

898
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,280
- So how'd it go?
- Oh...

899
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:24,408
They said I needed acting lessons.

900
01:18:25,117 --> 01:18:28,871
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.

901
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:34,376
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.

902
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,796
I'd like a cheeseburger.

903
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:41,717
Oh, but I'm going out to dinner
with Harry.

904
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:43,552
Come with us.

905
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:46,472
No, thanks. How's it going with--?

906
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:50,893
Uh... Never mind.
That's none of my business.

907
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:52,895
It's not?

908
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:55,981
Why so interested?

909
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:58,150
I'm not.

910
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,777
You're not?

911
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:04,156
- Well, why would I be?
- I don't know.

912
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:06,200
Why would you be?

913
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:10,412
I, uh... That's a--

914
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:12,122
I don't know.

915
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:17,169
Sorry you won't come with us.

916
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,590
I better run, tiger.

917
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,309
Hey, check it out, man.

918
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:34,144
Come on, man.

919
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:40,943
Hey, where you going,
baby? Come on!

920
01:19:58,836 --> 01:20:00,254
Get off me!

921
01:20:01,255 --> 01:20:02,673
Hey.

922
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:05,092
- Hey.
- Aah. Aah.

923
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:35,080
Wait!

924
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:42,296
- You have a knack for getting in trouble.
- Ha, ha.

925
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:46,842
You have a knack for saving my life.
I think I have a superhero stalker.

926
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:48,927
I was in the neighborhood.

927
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:53,432
You are amazing.

928
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:57,102
Some people don't think so.

929
01:20:58,187 --> 01:21:01,190
- But you are.
- Nice to have a fan.

930
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:05,152
Do I get to say thank you this time?

931
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:07,529
Wait.

932
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:18,684
Let me in! My baby's in there!
My baby's in there!

933
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:20,936
- Let me go!
- I can't. The roof's collapsing!

934
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:24,606
- Somebody save my baby!
- The roof's about to collapse!

935
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:26,150
Look! Up there!

936
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:34,616
Save my baby, please!

937
01:22:58,307 --> 01:22:59,475
No!

938
01:23:04,563 --> 01:23:05,647
No.

939
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:10,444
- It's okay. Your baby's fine.
- Oh, my baby.

940
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:15,157
God bless you, Spider-Man.
Bless you.

941
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,117
Don't let him get away!

942
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:20,496
Hold it! Hold it right there.
You're under arrest. I'm taking you in.

943
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:22,498
Oh, my God, there's somebody
still up there!

944
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:26,251
I'm going.

945
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:31,590
- I'll be here when you get back.
- Not coming back, chief.

946
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:33,133
Go! Go!

947
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:43,769
Where are you?

948
01:23:45,812 --> 01:23:47,397
Where are you?

949
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:55,155
I'm gonna get you out of here!

950
01:23:57,741 --> 01:23:59,243
It's okay.

951
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,877
You're pathetically predictable.

952
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:10,963
Like a moth to the flame.

953
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:14,299
What about my generous proposal?

954
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:18,178
Are you in or are you out?

955
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:20,973
It's you who's out, Gobby.
Out of your mind.

956
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:23,392
Wrong answer.

957
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:26,228
Oh, great.

958
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:07,686
No one says no to me!

959
01:25:15,027 --> 01:25:18,447
- M.J., will you stop goofing around?
- Harry, relax.

960
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,200
He's here.

961
01:25:23,535 --> 01:25:25,621
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

962
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:28,999
Hi, Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.

963
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:32,294
Work was murder. I picked up a fruitcake.

964
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:34,542
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.

965
01:25:34,588 --> 01:25:35,922
- You look great.
- Thanks.

966
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:38,884
Who is this lovely young lady?

967
01:25:39,051 --> 01:25:41,136
M.J., I'd like you to meet my father,
Norman Osborn.

968
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:42,721
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.

969
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,181
- Hi.
- How do you do?

970
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:46,224
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

971
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:50,145
- Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
- Now, where is Peter?

972
01:25:50,312 --> 01:25:52,689
He'd better have remembered
that cranberry sauce.

973
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:02,032
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.

974
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:06,536
Peter?

975
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:12,834
Peter?

976
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:16,296
Is that you?

977
01:26:19,758 --> 01:26:21,593
Pete?

978
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:25,931
How strange. There's nobody here.

979
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:36,900
- Bit of a slob, isn't he?
- All brilliant men are.

980
01:26:46,827 --> 01:26:48,412
Huh.

981
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:12,102
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, Peter.

982
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:14,104
Sorry I'm late, it's a jungle out there.

983
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:16,940
I had to beat an old lady with a stick
to get these cranberries.

984
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:21,403
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...

985
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,155
...and we can say grace.

986
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,324
Parker.

987
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,452
Here we go.

988
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:37,753
- There we are.
- Oh, it looks delicious.

989
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,755
Norman.

990
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:43,842
Will you do the honors?

991
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,774
- Why, Peter, you're bleeding.
- Hm?

992
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:02,360
Oh, uh, yeah.

993
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:06,948
I stepped off a curb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

994
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:08,658
Well, let me see.

995
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:10,452
Oh, my goodness.

996
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:13,038
- Oh, that looks awful.
- No, it's nothing.

997
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:16,333
I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.

998
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:19,461
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving
in this apartment...

999
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:21,838
...and we are gonna do things properly.

1000
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:25,884
How did you say that happened?

1001
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:28,011
Bike messenger.

1002
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,180
Knocked me down.

1003
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:35,310
Uh...

1004
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:39,272
- If you'll excuse me, I've got to go.
- Why?

1005
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:43,527
Something has come to my attention.

1006
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:44,986
Are you all right?

1007
01:28:45,195 --> 01:28:48,698
I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.

1008
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,701
- Enjoy the fruitcake.
- Dad.

1009
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:55,038
Dad, what are you doing?

1010
01:28:55,205 --> 01:28:57,666
I planned this so you'd meet M.J.,
and now you have to leave?

1011
01:28:57,874 --> 01:28:59,584
I gotta go.

1012
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:04,005
- Dad, this girl is important to me.
- Harry, please. Look at her.

1013
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:06,466
You think a woman like that
is sniffing around...

1014
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:08,176
...because she likes
your personality?

1015
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:11,429
- What are you saying?
- Your mother was beautiful too.

1016
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:12,764
They're all beautiful.

1017
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:17,018
Until they're snarling after your trust fund
like a pack of ravening wolves.

1018
01:29:17,227 --> 01:29:18,478
You're wrong about her, Dad.

1019
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:22,190
A word to the not-so-wise
about your little girlfriend:

1020
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:25,068
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

1021
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:39,207
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.

1022
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:42,377
- You heard?
- Everyone heard that creep.

1023
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:46,464
That creep is my father, all right?
If I'm lucky, I'll become half of what he is.

1024
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:49,071
So just keep your mouth shut about stuff
you don't understand!

1025
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:50,886
Harry Osborn.

1026
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:54,014
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

1027
01:29:56,975 --> 01:30:00,312
Spider-Man is all but invincible.

1028
01:30:00,478 --> 01:30:03,648
But Parker, we can destroy him.

1029
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:05,150
I can't.

1030
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:08,320
Betrayal must not be countenanced.

1031
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:10,822
Parker must be educated.

1032
01:30:12,991 --> 01:30:14,284
What do I do?

1033
01:30:14,492 --> 01:30:18,580
Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.

1034
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:21,791
Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.

1035
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:23,335
Yes?

1036
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:25,420
And then grant his wish.

1037
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:27,631
But how?

1038
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:32,135
The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.

1039
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:33,511
Tell me how!

1040
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,847
The heart, Osborn.

1041
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:39,142
First, we attack his heart.

1042
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:44,522
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...

1043
01:30:44,731 --> 01:30:47,692
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1044
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:50,946
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us--

1045
01:30:51,613 --> 01:30:53,031
Oh!

1046
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:02,082
Deliver us!

1047
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:03,667
Finish it!

1048
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:07,879
- Finish it!
- From evil!

1049
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:15,553
Two milligrams IV.

1050
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:18,807
Get the BP.

1051
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:22,811
Aunt May.
Is she gonna be okay? What happened?

1052
01:31:23,019 --> 01:31:24,354
Look, you have to leave.

1053
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:26,231
- What happened?
- Those eyes!

1054
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:29,567
Those horrible yellow eyes!

1055
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:37,867
He knows who I am.

1056
01:32:21,828 --> 01:32:23,413
I'm sorry.

1057
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:29,586
- Will she be okay?
- She's gonna be fine.

1058
01:32:29,753 --> 01:32:32,422
She's been sleeping all day.

1059
01:32:33,423 --> 01:32:36,176
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

1060
01:32:40,346 --> 01:32:43,266
How are you?
You okay about the other night?

1061
01:32:43,433 --> 01:32:47,103
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.

1062
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:50,315
- Have you talked to Harry?
- He called me.

1063
01:32:50,774 --> 01:32:52,942
I haven't called him back.

1064
01:32:55,028 --> 01:32:56,738
The fact is...

1065
01:32:57,906 --> 01:33:00,742
- ...I'm in love with somebody else.
- You are?

1066
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:02,118
At least I think I am.

1067
01:33:04,788 --> 01:33:07,832
- It's not the right time to talk about it.
- No, no. Go on.

1068
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:11,252
Would I know his name,
this guy?

1069
01:33:11,461 --> 01:33:13,797
You'll think I'm a stupid little girl
with a crush.

1070
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:15,882
Trust me.

1071
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:17,383
It's funny.

1072
01:33:19,385 --> 01:33:22,764
He's saved my life twice,
and I've never even seen his face.

1073
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:26,893
- Oh. Him.
- You're laughing at me.

1074
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:30,063
No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.

1075
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:33,071
But do you think it's true,
all the terrible things they say about him?

1076
01:33:33,233 --> 01:33:37,654
No, no. Not Spider-Man,
not a chance in the world.

1077
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:39,489
I know him a little bit.

1078
01:33:39,697 --> 01:33:42,575
I'm sort of his unofficial photographer.

1079
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:45,912
- Has he mentioned me?
- Yeah.

1080
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:47,497
What'd he say?

1081
01:33:47,664 --> 01:33:49,624
Uh... I said...

1082
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:55,004
He asked me
what I thought about you.

1083
01:33:55,922 --> 01:33:57,966
And what did you say?

1084
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:02,762
I said, um, "Spider-Man"...

1085
01:34:03,096 --> 01:34:07,976
...I said, um,
"The great thing about M.J...

1086
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:09,727
...is...

1087
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:13,898
...when you look in her eyes...

1088
01:34:16,442 --> 01:34:19,654
...and she's looking back in yours...

1089
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:23,658
...everything feels...

1090
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:26,703
...not quite normal.

1091
01:34:27,954 --> 01:34:29,747
Because you feel...

1092
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:31,916
...stronger...

1093
01:34:33,459 --> 01:34:37,088
...and weaker at the same time.

1094
01:34:38,131 --> 01:34:40,258
You feel excited...

1095
01:34:41,134 --> 01:34:43,178
...and at the same time...

1096
01:34:43,803 --> 01:34:45,430
...terrified.

1097
01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:52,061
The truth is, you don't know
what you feel...

1098
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:57,108
...except you know
what kind of man you want to be.

1099
01:34:59,819 --> 01:35:01,696
It's as if you've...

1100
01:35:02,322 --> 01:35:05,491
...reached the unreachable...

1101
01:35:07,076 --> 01:35:09,787
...and you weren't ready for it."

1102
01:35:13,249 --> 01:35:15,001
You said that?

1103
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:18,338
Well, something like that.

1104
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:49,786
Hey.

1105
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:03,925
Dad?

1106
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:11,349
Dad, is that you?

1107
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:19,440
What is it?

1108
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:24,988
Well, you were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.

1109
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:30,410
She's in love with Peter.

1110
01:36:30,702 --> 01:36:32,495
- Parker?
- Yeah.

1111
01:36:32,662 --> 01:36:34,622
And how does he feel about her?

1112
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:39,752
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

1113
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:45,967
He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.

1114
01:36:47,593 --> 01:36:50,638
Oh. I'm so sorry.

1115
01:36:53,099 --> 01:36:55,018
I haven't always been there
for you, have I?

1116
01:36:58,313 --> 01:37:01,524
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.

1117
01:37:01,733 --> 01:37:03,526
That's no excuse.

1118
01:37:04,527 --> 01:37:06,321
I'm proud of you.

1119
01:37:06,863 --> 01:37:11,743
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'll make it up to you, Harry.

1120
01:37:11,909 --> 01:37:15,246
I'm going to rectify certain inequities.

1121
01:37:29,302 --> 01:37:31,095
Wake up, little spider.

1122
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:32,764
Wake up.

1123
01:37:34,098 --> 01:37:35,683
Go home, dear.

1124
01:37:35,892 --> 01:37:37,226
You look awful.

1125
01:37:37,435 --> 01:37:39,687
- And you look beautiful.
- Well, thank you.

1126
01:37:39,896 --> 01:37:43,232
- I don't like to leave you here.
- Oh, but I'm safe here.

1127
01:37:43,399 --> 01:37:46,110
- Can I do anything for you?
- You do too much.

1128
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:50,239
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.

1129
01:37:52,575 --> 01:37:54,327
A smile. Finally.

1130
01:37:54,494 --> 01:37:57,747
Haven't seen one of those on your face
since Mary Jane was here.

1131
01:37:57,914 --> 01:38:00,458
Hey. You were supposed
to be asleep.

1132
01:38:02,085 --> 01:38:06,881
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J.'s family moved in next door.

1133
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:11,052
And when she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...

1134
01:38:11,219 --> 01:38:17,558
...you grabbed me and said, "Aunt May.
Aunt May, is that an angel?"

1135
01:38:17,767 --> 01:38:21,312
- Gee, did I say that?
- You sure did.

1136
01:38:23,981 --> 01:38:26,734
Well, Harry's in love with her.

1137
01:38:26,943 --> 01:38:30,696
- She's still his girl.
- Well, isn't that up to her?

1138
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:35,493
- She doesn't really know who I am.
- Because you won't let her.

1139
01:38:35,701 --> 01:38:38,830
You're so mysterious all the time.

1140
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:41,833
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...

1141
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:46,212
...to let Mary Jane know
how much you care? Heh.

1142
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:48,923
Everybody else knows.

1143
01:38:51,968 --> 01:38:53,136
I'll be right back.

1144
01:38:53,886 --> 01:38:55,388
But--

1145
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,522
Come on, pick up.

1146
01:39:04,689 --> 01:39:05,690
Hey, M.J.--

1147
01:39:05,857 --> 01:39:07,692
Sing your song at the beep.

1148
01:39:09,026 --> 01:39:11,070
M.J., it's Peter. You there?

1149
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:14,198
Hello? You there?

1150
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:19,203
I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in, okay?

1151
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:20,788
All right, well...

1152
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:22,248
...don't--

1153
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:26,252
Don't go up any dark alleys.
Hello?

1154
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:33,092
Can Spider-Man come out to play?

1155
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:35,052
Where is she?

1156
01:40:18,721 --> 01:40:20,264
Ah...

1157
01:40:21,307 --> 01:40:22,975
- What is that?
- That's cool!

1158
01:40:23,184 --> 01:40:27,230
♪ The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the water spout ♪

1159
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:32,151
♪ Down came the goblin
And took the spider out ♪♪

1160
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,670
Goblin, what have you done?

1161
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:37,008
Spider-Man!
This is why only fools are heroes.

1162
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:39,010
Because you never know...

1163
01:41:39,218 --> 01:41:43,598
...when some lunatic will come along
with a sadistic choice:

1164
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:46,851
Let die the woman you love...

1165
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:57,153
...or suffer the little children.

1166
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:01,991
- Spider-Man!
- Save us!

1167
01:42:02,533 --> 01:42:04,785
Save us!

1168
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:07,622
Make your choice, Spider-Man...

1169
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:11,208
...and see how a hero is rewarded.

1170
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:13,461
Don't do it, Goblin!

1171
01:42:13,628 --> 01:42:16,547
We are who we choose to be.

1172
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:18,716
- Now, choose!
- No!

1173
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:49,830
Everybody stay still!

1174
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:00,675
Ahoy up there!

1175
01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:03,761
We're gonna bring the barge
right under you.

1176
01:43:11,268 --> 01:43:15,398
- He's coming back!
- Listen. I need you to climb down.

1177
01:43:15,564 --> 01:43:17,066
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

1178
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:25,199
M.J., you can do it. You have to.

1179
01:43:25,366 --> 01:43:26,951
Trust me.

1180
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:31,122
Hold on tight and go quickly.

1181
01:43:36,627 --> 01:43:38,671
- Hurry!
- I can't. I can't do it.

1182
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:40,548
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1183
01:44:08,993 --> 01:44:11,620
- He's not gonna make it.
- He's gonna make it!

1184
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:23,549
It's time to die.

1185
01:44:31,724 --> 01:44:34,185
Come on up here, tough guy,
I got something for you!

1186
01:44:34,351 --> 01:44:35,561
Yeah, kick your ass!

1187
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:39,148
Leave Spider-Man alone! You'll pick
on a guy trying to save a bunch of kids?

1188
01:44:39,815 --> 01:44:41,275
I got something for your ass!

1189
01:44:41,442 --> 01:44:43,319
Mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!

1190
01:44:43,486 --> 01:44:45,905
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!

1191
01:44:52,036 --> 01:44:53,454
Yeah!

1192
01:44:59,543 --> 01:45:01,337
Spider-Man, watch out!

1193
01:45:33,202 --> 01:45:37,456
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.

1194
01:45:38,374 --> 01:45:41,001
I offered you friendship...

1195
01:45:41,168 --> 01:45:43,045
...and you spat in my face.

1196
01:46:34,138 --> 01:46:37,808
You've spun your last web,
Spider-Man.

1197
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:41,312
Had you not been so selfish,
your little girlfriend's death...

1198
01:46:41,478 --> 01:46:43,188
...would have been quick
and painless.

1199
01:46:43,355 --> 01:46:46,734
But now that you've really
pissed me off...

1200
01:46:46,984 --> 01:46:51,864
...I'm gonna finish her nice and slow.

1201
01:46:56,452 --> 01:46:58,495
M.J. and I...

1202
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:02,625
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.

1203
01:47:56,428 --> 01:47:57,972
Peter, stop!

1204
01:47:58,138 --> 01:48:00,599
Stop! It's me.

1205
01:48:09,566 --> 01:48:10,985
Mr. Osborn.

1206
01:48:11,193 --> 01:48:12,778
Peter, thank God for you.

1207
01:48:12,987 --> 01:48:15,280
You killed those people
on that balcony.

1208
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:18,534
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it.

1209
01:48:18,701 --> 01:48:20,452
Don't let him take me again.

1210
01:48:20,619 --> 01:48:22,663
I beg you. Protect me.

1211
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:26,375
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.

1212
01:48:26,583 --> 01:48:28,085
But not you.

1213
01:48:28,752 --> 01:48:32,715
I tried to stop it. But I couldn't stop it.

1214
01:48:32,923 --> 01:48:35,009
I would never hurt you.

1215
01:48:35,217 --> 01:48:37,136
I knew from the beginning...

1216
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:40,264
...if anything ever happened to me...

1217
01:48:40,431 --> 01:48:42,599
...it was you that I could count on.

1218
01:48:42,766 --> 01:48:46,103
You, Peter Parker, would save me,
and so you have.

1219
01:48:46,687 --> 01:48:48,522
Thank God for you.

1220
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:50,941
Give me your hand.

1221
01:48:52,109 --> 01:48:55,529
Believe in me as I believed in you.

1222
01:48:56,947 --> 01:48:59,742
I've been like a father to you.

1223
01:49:01,285 --> 01:49:02,953
Be a son to me now.

1224
01:49:04,747 --> 01:49:06,623
I have a father.

1225
01:49:07,374 --> 01:49:09,877
His name was Ben Parker.

1226
01:49:11,754 --> 01:49:13,213
Godspeed, Spider-Man.

1227
01:49:20,137 --> 01:49:21,388
Oh.

1228
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:33,650
Peter.

1229
01:49:35,986 --> 01:49:37,279
Don't tell Harry.

1230
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,230
What have you done?

1231
01:50:11,396 --> 01:50:12,981
What have you done?!

1232
01:50:36,255 --> 01:50:37,756
Hey.

1233
01:50:41,135 --> 01:50:43,178
I'm so sorry, Harry.

1234
01:50:44,096 --> 01:50:47,224
I know what it's like to lose a father.

1235
01:50:49,393 --> 01:50:52,688
I didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.

1236
01:50:54,273 --> 01:50:56,817
One day Spider-Man will pay.

1237
01:50:58,443 --> 01:51:01,572
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

1238
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:08,412
Thank God for you, Peter.

1239
01:51:08,996 --> 01:51:11,582
You're the only family I have.

1240
01:51:36,023 --> 01:51:38,400
No matter what I do...

1241
01:51:38,567 --> 01:51:41,695
...no matter how hard I try...

1242
01:51:42,070 --> 01:51:47,034
...the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.

1243
01:51:56,835 --> 01:51:59,171
You must miss him so much.

1244
01:52:00,130 --> 01:52:03,175
It's been so hard without him.

1245
01:52:06,094 --> 01:52:08,972
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

1246
01:52:10,766 --> 01:52:12,559
When I was up there...

1247
01:52:13,310 --> 01:52:16,104
...and I thought I was gonna die...

1248
01:52:17,731 --> 01:52:20,484
...there was only one person
who I was thinking of.

1249
01:52:22,861 --> 01:52:26,073
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.

1250
01:52:27,532 --> 01:52:29,493
It was you, Pete.

1251
01:52:30,827 --> 01:52:32,704
I kept thinking:

1252
01:52:33,121 --> 01:52:35,916
"I hope I make it through this...

1253
01:52:37,376 --> 01:52:41,755
...So I can see Peter Parker's face
one more time."

1254
01:52:43,131 --> 01:52:44,633
Really?

1255
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:50,806
There's only one man
who's always been there for me...

1256
01:52:52,057 --> 01:52:54,017
...who makes me feel...

1257
01:52:54,476 --> 01:52:58,188
...like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.

1258
01:53:00,315 --> 01:53:01,984
That I'm just...

1259
01:53:02,651 --> 01:53:04,152
...me.

1260
01:53:05,237 --> 01:53:07,155
And that's okay.

1261
01:53:09,324 --> 01:53:10,993
The truth is...

I love you so much, Peter.

1264
01:53:39,479 --> 01:53:44,276
All I wanted was to tell her

I can't.

there's so much to tell.

1269
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:03,670
Yeah. There's so much to tell.

1270
01:54:04,588 --> 01:54:06,590
I want you to know...

1271
01:54:06,965 --> 01:54:09,885
...that I will always be there
for you.

1272
01:54:10,052 --> 01:54:13,805
I will always be there
to take care of you.

...Peter Parker?

1277
01:54:31,782 --> 01:54:34,618
That's all I have to give.

comes great responsibility.”

1281
