1
00:03:06,863 --> 00:03:11,367
I got out of the institution
on the day of my sister's wedding.

2
00:03:11,868 --> 00:03:14,370
I had started to get used to the place.

3
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:16,873
Breakfast at 8:00, classes at 2:00,

4
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:20,334
therapy at 4:00 and asleep by 10:00.

5
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:22,962
You can call me any time, Lee.

6
00:03:23,421 --> 00:03:26,007
I will always try to be of help to you.

7
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,342
Inside, life was simple.

8
00:03:29,385 --> 00:03:30,803
Thank you, Dr. Twardon.

9
00:03:30,887 --> 00:03:33,848
For that reason, I was reluctant to go.

10
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:24,440
Hi, Peter.

11
00:04:24,523 --> 00:04:28,527
Peter, yeah,
who you almost successfully forgot.

12
00:04:28,611 --> 00:04:30,446
- No, I did not.
- Come on, everybody!

13
00:04:30,947 --> 00:04:32,698
Are you happy to be home?

14
00:04:34,784 --> 00:04:37,161
I mean, are you happy to be home?

15
00:04:38,996 --> 00:04:40,456
I don't know.

16
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,918
I know what you mean.

17
00:04:58,557 --> 00:05:01,811
Here's a little something
for the lovebirds.

18
00:05:03,187 --> 00:05:04,438
Boy!

19
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:07,942
You look so beautiful.

20
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:10,486
Thanks, Dad.

21
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:14,824
I thought you stopped.

22
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:21,163
Do you know how much
we missed you, pumpkin?

23
00:05:21,706 --> 00:05:23,624
Well, I missed you, too.

24
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:31,632
You know what?

25
00:05:31,882 --> 00:05:33,843
I don't feel too good.

26
00:05:34,343 --> 00:05:36,178
Let's go sit down.

27
00:06:58,302 --> 00:07:00,054
- Bye!
- Goodbye!

28
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,143
- Have fun!
- Goodbye! Take care!

29
00:07:26,205 --> 00:07:27,265
What are you talking about?

30
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:30,185
You want to treat me like I'm a child.
You want to talk to me like a child.

31
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:31,269
- Huh? You think I'm a child?
- You...

32
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:34,046
- You think I don't know what I'm doing?
- You act like a child!

33
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,131
Yeah, right.

34
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:37,967
You don't act like a man.
You've been fired!

35
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:41,387
Well, I'm glad I'm fired!

36
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,889
I'm glad I'm fired!
Boy, I hated that job!

37
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:46,559
I don't care that you hated it!
You're drunk!

38
00:07:46,642 --> 00:07:49,395
I'm not drunk! Why do you...
Why do you... I'm not drunk!

39
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:52,648
- Why do you always say that?
- Get off my back!

40
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:09,999
Watch this. You watch this.

41
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:16,982
Avoid the temptation
of placing your fingers

42
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:19,068
on the home keys by sight.

43
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:24,031
Strike each key so that your fingers
bounce with each stroke.

44
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,408
Do not strike without thinking.

45
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:30,663
Do not even attempt
to steal a glance at your paper.

46
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,999
"My flowers had just
about given up in despair,

47
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:37,253
"so with the exception
of a few potted plants from the florist,

48
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:40,422
"we're flowerless
for the first spring in years."

49
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:42,091
And time!

50
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:47,221
I'm so proud of you, honey.

51
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,099
Getting out in the world like this.

52
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:54,853
When my accident happened,

53
00:09:56,272 --> 00:09:59,567
we were in the kitchen
and my back was to her.

54
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:03,529
Upstairs, my dad was just leaving for work

55
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:05,781
at Havis department store.

56
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:10,119
Because there was a limited amount of time
that my mom's back was turned...

57
00:10:10,703 --> 00:10:13,205
- Lee!
- 1 slipped and cut too deep.

58
00:10:14,456 --> 00:10:17,126
I'm not sure how I could have misjudged.

59
00:10:17,543 --> 00:10:19,962
I've been doing it since seventh grade.

60
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:39,148
Just a precaution.

61
00:11:26,654 --> 00:11:28,155
"Be a leader."

62
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:40,167
I have never had a job before,

63
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:46,298
but I can assure you that I am very excited
about this opportunity.

64
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:48,759
Thank you.

65
00:11:50,302 --> 00:11:54,139
Well, I don't have any references yet.

66
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,851
But I think that the municipal tax office

67
00:11:57,935 --> 00:12:02,690
would be a wonderful place to begin

68
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:06,068
my career.

69
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,163
"Secretary."

70
00:13:33,906 --> 00:13:35,449
Hello. I...

71
00:13:37,785 --> 00:13:39,119
Wait! I...

72
00:13:57,012 --> 00:13:58,180
Hello?

73
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:05,020
Hello?

74
00:14:08,065 --> 00:14:09,274
In here.

75
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:19,076
Hi.

76
00:14:22,955 --> 00:14:23,997
Hi.

77
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,126
Are you the lawyer?

78
00:14:32,965 --> 00:14:34,007
Yes.

79
00:14:35,634 --> 00:14:37,135
I'm sorry. I'll just come back later.

80
00:14:37,219 --> 00:14:38,262
No.

81
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:41,390
No, stay.

82
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:02,077
It said "secretary."

83
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,498
That's right.

84
00:15:11,587 --> 00:15:13,171
Are you pregnant?

85
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,092
No.

86
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,096
Do you plan on getting pregnant?

87
00:15:25,142 --> 00:15:26,184
No.

88
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:30,689
- Are you living in an apartment?
- A house.

89
00:15:30,772 --> 00:15:33,442
- Alone?
- With my parents.

90
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:35,235
Siblings?

91
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:39,031
Well, my sister is going to live
in the backyard

92
00:15:39,114 --> 00:15:41,533
with her husband in the pool house.

93
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:43,785
Are you married?

94
00:15:45,203 --> 00:15:46,246
No.

95
00:15:49,124 --> 00:15:51,293
Have you ever won an award?

96
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:52,586
Yes.

97
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:54,546
What did you win the award in?

98
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,797
Typing.

99
00:16:02,304 --> 00:16:03,639
Are those your scores?

100
00:16:07,476 --> 00:16:08,518
Yes.

101
00:16:09,645 --> 00:16:12,189
"Lee Holloway."

102
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:25,869
Could you get me
a cup of coffee with sugar?

103
00:17:27,556 --> 00:17:29,850
Do you really want to be a secretary, Lee?

104
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:31,601
Yes, I do.

105
00:17:39,484 --> 00:17:42,779
You scored higher
than anyone I've ever interviewed.

106
00:17:44,072 --> 00:17:47,576
You're really over-qualified for the job.

107
00:17:48,243 --> 00:17:51,455
- You'd be bored to death.
- L want to be bored.

108
00:17:59,755 --> 00:18:02,299
I have a part-time paralegal.

109
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:08,180
All I need is a typist

110
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:13,268
who can get to work on time
and answer the phone.

111
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,062
I can do that.

112
00:18:15,437 --> 00:18:19,107
We only use typewriters here,
not computers.

113
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:20,859
That's fine.

114
00:18:21,026 --> 00:18:23,987
It's very dull work.

115
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:26,531
I like dull work.

116
00:18:33,622 --> 00:18:35,916
There's something about you.

117
00:18:38,835 --> 00:18:39,878
You're...

118
00:18:43,048 --> 00:18:46,093
You're closed up tight.

119
00:18:48,386 --> 00:18:49,596
A wall.

120
00:18:51,473 --> 00:18:52,682
I know.

121
00:18:54,643 --> 00:18:56,478
Do you ever loosen up?

122
00:19:00,482 --> 00:19:01,942
I don't know.

123
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:07,405
I'm not here.

124
00:19:22,337 --> 00:19:24,422
Less sugar in the coffee.

125
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:34,558
How'd it go?

126
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:38,854
I got it.

127
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:50,157
I knew you could do it!

128
00:20:05,463 --> 00:20:06,506
Hello.

129
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:22,063
Hello.

130
00:20:23,148 --> 00:20:28,445
You have reached the office
of Mr. E. Edward Grey.

131
00:20:30,155 --> 00:20:33,408
Please leave your message
and the time you called,

132
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:36,536
along with your phone number

133
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,206
and the best time to reach you,

134
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:49,341
and we will get back to you
as soon as possible.

135
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,303
We.

136
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:57,224
Secretary.

137
00:21:09,236 --> 00:21:10,237
Type up this letter

138
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,114
and send four copies
to O'Malley and Barrett.

139
00:21:14,449 --> 00:21:16,076
Right away, sir.

140
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,466
That's good. That's good.

141
00:21:36,137 --> 00:21:38,181
So, you're the new secretary.

142
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:41,643
Yeah.

143
00:21:46,731 --> 00:21:48,024
Excuse me.

144
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:50,402
What exactly is a paralegal?

145
00:21:58,827 --> 00:22:00,078
See you.

146
00:22:23,351 --> 00:22:25,395
Okay.

147
00:22:26,938 --> 00:22:31,318
Up at the sides. Wide-eyed.

148
00:22:56,217 --> 00:22:58,011
I brought you these.

149
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:10,482
I think I accidentally threw out my notes
on the Feldman case.

150
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:11,900
Maybe you could...

151
00:23:11,983 --> 00:23:14,069
Go through the garbage?

152
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:21,951
Yes, Lee. Thank you.

153
00:24:36,901 --> 00:24:38,153
Why are you here?

154
00:24:39,654 --> 00:24:41,739
I'm just waiting for you, honey.

155
00:24:41,906 --> 00:24:44,159
But I'm here for five more hours.

156
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:46,494
I know.

157
00:24:59,048 --> 00:25:00,842
Excuse me, sir.

158
00:25:03,136 --> 00:25:05,180
It's okay. I found another set.

159
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:10,351
This needs more sugar.

160
00:25:10,727 --> 00:25:12,854
- Sugar?
- And six copies of these.

161
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:17,442
Freshen up that trap, Lee.

162
00:25:17,525 --> 00:25:19,319
And put out one more.

163
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:49,891
Mice like to go behind
the chairs, too, Lee.

164
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:52,143
Just because it's hard to reach

165
00:25:52,227 --> 00:25:55,063
does not mean that we don't
take care of every possibility.

166
00:26:01,402 --> 00:26:03,238
Here. Give me that.

167
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,421
Thank you.

168
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:05,592
E. Edward Grey's office. May I help you?

169
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:09,804
We're very happy with AT&T.
Thanks, though.

170
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:11,222
Is he in?

171
00:27:11,306 --> 00:27:12,546
Could you just wait one moment?

172
00:27:15,226 --> 00:27:17,103
You're right.
That is a very good offer.

173
00:27:17,186 --> 00:27:18,396
I'm going back now.

174
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:21,107
Could you just wait one minute, please?

175
00:27:22,984 --> 00:27:24,694
Yes, I do understand that.

176
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:26,738
Submissive.

177
00:27:29,532 --> 00:27:30,575
Excuse me?

178
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:31,826
Edward!

179
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:38,082
Listen, I have no idea if we make over $40

180
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:41,210
worth of long distance calls
to Chattanooga each month.

181
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:47,759
Tell him it's Tricia O'Connor.

182
00:27:49,385 --> 00:27:50,887
Mr. Grey?

183
00:27:58,519 --> 00:27:59,687
Hello?

184
00:28:05,526 --> 00:28:06,778
Mr. Grey?

185
00:28:07,362 --> 00:28:08,988
Ms. Holloway.

186
00:28:18,873 --> 00:28:20,166
Mr. Grey?

187
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,711
I'm not here.

188
00:28:28,132 --> 00:28:29,300
Okay.

189
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:37,600
I'm afraid he's gone.

190
00:28:38,685 --> 00:28:40,019
Is that right?

191
00:28:46,734 --> 00:28:48,736
E. Edward Grey's office.

192
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:51,155
Is that you, honey? It's me.

193
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:52,323
Daddy?

194
00:28:52,824 --> 00:28:54,534
It's so good to hear your voice.

195
00:28:54,617 --> 00:28:55,910
Dad.

196
00:28:56,703 --> 00:28:57,745
Where are you?

197
00:28:58,538 --> 00:29:00,873
I'm downtown, somewhere.

198
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:04,252
Could you please hold?

199
00:29:06,838 --> 00:29:08,840
Do you have a message, Ms. O'Connor?

200
00:29:20,184 --> 00:29:22,478
Tell him to sign the settlement.

201
00:29:28,276 --> 00:29:29,444
Hello?

202
00:29:30,695 --> 00:29:31,863
Hello?

203
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:34,282
Hello, Dad?

204
00:30:53,361 --> 00:30:55,029
How's work?

205
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,614
Fine.

206
00:30:58,157 --> 00:30:59,450
How's Mr. Grey?

207
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,286
He's fine.

208
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,497
Well, Peter called.

209
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,468
Some people, right, have to wash
something as soon as they've worn it,

210
00:31:17,552 --> 00:31:19,387
- you know, for, like, half a day.
- Yes.

211
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,470
And then you got your more
laid-back folk who just,

212
00:31:21,514 --> 00:31:23,808
you know, maybe they'll
wash their stuff when it's dirty.

213
00:31:23,891 --> 00:31:25,601
Which kind are you?

214
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:28,521
I'm the type of guy

215
00:31:29,981 --> 00:31:32,608
who wants to get married and have a kid.

216
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:38,990
I wash my clothes just when they're dirty.

217
00:31:39,407 --> 00:31:43,244
Me, too, and...
And that is what counts in a relationship.

218
00:31:44,078 --> 00:31:45,580
Compatibility.

219
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,375
In a relationship?

220
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:50,858
- In a relationship.
- Relationship.

221
00:32:03,723 --> 00:32:05,474
May I interest you in a little more?

222
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:08,644
- Just a little more?
- Why not? Okay.

223
00:32:15,026 --> 00:32:17,862
You're different
than you were in high school, Peter.

224
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:20,323
L... I changed.

225
00:32:20,781 --> 00:32:21,991
What happened?

226
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:24,535
I had a nervous breakdown.

227
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,871
Me, too.

228
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,499
Sort of.

229
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:38,883
Two items. This and these.

230
00:32:38,966 --> 00:32:40,843
- Peter?
- Yes, Lee?

231
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:45,181
I've read that if you
wear that kind of underwear,

232
00:32:45,806 --> 00:32:48,643
that it squeezes

233
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:51,646
your things.

234
00:32:52,396 --> 00:32:53,731
- Balls.
- Yes.

235
00:32:53,814 --> 00:32:54,815
Balls?

236
00:32:55,691 --> 00:32:57,568
My grapes.

237
00:32:57,652 --> 00:32:58,736
Your grapes?

238
00:32:58,819 --> 00:32:59,820
My...

239
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,989
Your testicles.

240
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:06,994
Your sperm gets squozen,
and then you can't have babies,

241
00:33:07,078 --> 00:33:09,914
and I thought that
you said that you wanted to have babies.

242
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,750
There you go. I said it.

243
00:33:15,836 --> 00:33:17,046
To babies!

244
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:19,882
To diapers.

245
00:33:20,675 --> 00:33:21,759
To diaper rash.

246
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,720
To breast-feeding. And to crying.

247
00:34:12,018 --> 00:34:13,185
Look at it!

248
00:34:14,729 --> 00:34:15,730
Do you see that?

249
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:17,023
What?

250
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:19,233
This letter has three typing errors in it,

251
00:34:19,316 --> 00:34:21,569
one of which is, I
believe, a spelling error.

252
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:24,613
I'm... I'm sorry.

253
00:34:24,697 --> 00:34:26,049
This isn't the first time, either.

254
00:34:26,073 --> 00:34:28,802
There've been others that I let go
because it was in the first few weeks.

255
00:34:28,826 --> 00:34:30,661
This cannot go on.

256
00:34:30,745 --> 00:34:33,890
Do you know what this makes me look like
to the people who receive these letters?

257
00:34:33,914 --> 00:34:36,667
L... I'm sorry. I'm...

258
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:40,004
Type it again and get it right.

259
00:34:57,772 --> 00:34:59,690
You're wasting my time.

260
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:42,858
Bye.

261
00:35:58,833 --> 00:36:01,502
Go type up a bill for that woman for $500.

262
00:36:01,585 --> 00:36:03,587
Aren't you going to proofread the letter?

263
00:36:21,147 --> 00:36:22,189
Lee.

264
00:36:26,235 --> 00:36:28,154
When people come into this office,

265
00:36:28,237 --> 00:36:31,574
you are a visual representation
of my business.

266
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:34,160
And the way you dress is disgusting.

267
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,291
I'm sorry.

268
00:36:40,374 --> 00:36:43,836
You're tapping your toe all the time
and playing with your hair.

269
00:36:43,961 --> 00:36:45,880
You're either going to
have to wear a hairnet

270
00:36:45,963 --> 00:36:47,673
or stop playing with your hair.

271
00:36:51,927 --> 00:36:53,596
And another thing,

272
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,850
do you realize that
you are always sniffling?

273
00:36:58,434 --> 00:37:00,769
I... I'm sniffling?

274
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:03,981
And what is with your tongue

275
00:37:04,815 --> 00:37:06,567
when you're typing?

276
00:37:07,818 --> 00:37:10,237
I'm sorry.
I didn't know I sniffled.

277
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:14,575
Well, you do.

278
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:23,417
Mr. Grey,

279
00:37:25,169 --> 00:37:30,090
thank you so much for
your helpful suggestions.

280
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:34,595
Because I am trying to be

281
00:37:36,513 --> 00:37:39,433
the very best secretary that I can be.

282
00:37:41,018 --> 00:37:42,269
For you.

283
00:37:43,354 --> 00:37:45,272
The sentence should read,

284
00:37:45,356 --> 00:37:49,151
"Without proper guidance
from a knowledgeable source,

285
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:51,612
"my client would never have made

286
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:55,449
"these material decisions on her own."
Period!

287
00:37:55,866 --> 00:37:57,451
I have repeated the sentence twice.

288
00:37:59,036 --> 00:38:02,748
Why don't you listen, think
and then respond.

289
00:38:03,374 --> 00:38:04,708
Okay?

290
00:38:13,259 --> 00:38:15,261
Are you sure
you wouldn't like some wine?

291
00:38:15,928 --> 00:38:18,555
We make it homemade, don't we, Stewart?

292
00:38:19,014 --> 00:38:20,182
Try it. It's good.

293
00:38:20,266 --> 00:38:21,809
Would you like some, Lee?

294
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:24,103
No, thank you.

295
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,854
Not right now, Sylvia.

296
00:38:25,938 --> 00:38:28,399
You know,
Peter talks about you all the time.

297
00:38:28,482 --> 00:38:30,985
He says he's found his soul mate.

298
00:38:32,945 --> 00:38:34,571
Did you say that?

299
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:38,283
I did.

300
00:38:38,325 --> 00:38:40,494
Peter's sister, Lindsey,

301
00:38:40,953 --> 00:38:43,998
is getting married this
coming winter in Vegas.

302
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:48,335
Did you know Peter has
a very stable job at JCPenney?

303
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:50,170
They even gave him a cell phone.

304
00:38:50,254 --> 00:38:52,089
Perhaps it'll be a double wedding?

305
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:57,636
Mom.

306
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:24,872
Ms. Holloway, come into the library.

307
00:39:26,373 --> 00:39:27,750
Immediately.

308
00:39:43,891 --> 00:39:46,643
"refer only to slanderous remarks
made in print.

309
00:39:46,727 --> 00:39:48,062
"In summation of the events

310
00:39:48,145 --> 00:39:51,940
"in regard to the Rubin Berkowitz libel.
Yours sincerely, etc."

311
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,571
Okay.

312
00:39:59,281 --> 00:40:01,075
The phone is ringing.

313
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,623
Answer it.

314
00:40:10,751 --> 00:40:11,794
I'm sorry...

315
00:40:23,013 --> 00:40:24,181
Hello?

316
00:40:24,473 --> 00:40:26,266
This is the office of...

317
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,434
Listen.

318
00:40:27,601 --> 00:40:28,685
You're a big girl.

319
00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:32,773
You can get a much bigger voice
out of that tiny throat of yours.

320
00:40:34,149 --> 00:40:35,275
Tiny.

321
00:40:36,235 --> 00:40:37,361
Ms. Holloway.

322
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:39,571
You told me when I hired you

323
00:40:39,655 --> 00:40:42,157
that you were used to answering phones.

324
00:40:43,075 --> 00:40:44,159
I am.

325
00:40:44,868 --> 00:40:47,162
Did you get enough sleep last night?

326
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:49,581
- L...
- The phone is ringing!

327
00:40:53,043 --> 00:40:54,211
Hello.

328
00:40:55,295 --> 00:40:59,007
This is the office of Mr. E. Edward Grey.

329
00:40:59,216 --> 00:41:02,261
You see? You see?
You see? You see?

330
00:41:02,344 --> 00:41:04,221
That's showing a little spunk.

331
00:41:04,304 --> 00:41:06,140
After all, I'm not running a mortuary.

332
00:41:06,557 --> 00:41:07,599
No.

333
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:19,403
Lee.

334
00:41:20,904 --> 00:41:22,156
Mr. Grey.

335
00:41:25,242 --> 00:41:26,368
Come here.

336
00:41:53,312 --> 00:41:55,397
Did you have a date recently?

337
00:41:59,526 --> 00:42:00,611
Yes.

338
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,365
With whom did you have a date?

339
00:42:07,201 --> 00:42:09,203
- Peter.
- Peter?

340
00:42:09,286 --> 00:42:10,746
Did you have sex?

341
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:15,209
No?

342
00:42:18,253 --> 00:42:19,713
I don't know.

343
00:42:23,258 --> 00:42:24,676
Are you shy?

344
00:42:27,262 --> 00:42:28,514
I'm shy.

345
00:42:29,806 --> 00:42:31,350
You're not shy.

346
00:42:31,892 --> 00:42:33,519
You're a lawyer.

347
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:37,898
I'm shy.

348
00:42:39,024 --> 00:42:40,901
I overcome my shyness to...

349
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,906
In order to get things done.

350
00:42:48,325 --> 00:42:50,285
I don't think you're shy.

351
00:42:55,666 --> 00:42:58,001
Lee, I want to be frank with you.

352
00:42:58,085 --> 00:43:02,422
Now, I know I'm your employer,
and we have

353
00:43:02,965 --> 00:43:04,967
a prescribed relationship.

354
00:43:08,971 --> 00:43:13,100
But you really should feel free

355
00:43:16,311 --> 00:43:18,981
to discuss your problems with me.

356
00:43:30,617 --> 00:43:33,495
What's going on
with the sewing kit and the Band-Aids?

357
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:42,129
Lee?

358
00:43:46,592 --> 00:43:47,843
I feel...

359
00:43:50,804 --> 00:43:52,055
- Shy.
- Shy.

360
00:43:56,268 --> 00:43:57,894
Do you want some hot chocolate?

361
00:43:58,854 --> 00:43:59,896
Okay.

362
00:44:15,037 --> 00:44:17,164
Why do you cut yourself, Lee?

363
00:44:22,544 --> 00:44:24,004
I don't know.

364
00:44:25,339 --> 00:44:27,924
Is it that sometimes the pain inside has to
come to the surface,

365
00:44:28,008 --> 00:44:30,218
and when you see evidence
of the pain inside,

366
00:44:30,594 --> 00:44:33,263
you finally know you are really here?

367
00:44:33,347 --> 00:44:35,515
Then, when you watch the wound heal,

368
00:44:35,682 --> 00:44:38,018
it's comforting. Isn't it?

369
00:44:46,652 --> 00:44:48,320
That's a way to put it.

370
00:44:49,196 --> 00:44:52,449
I'm going to tell you something, Lee.
Are you ready to listen?

371
00:44:53,659 --> 00:44:54,660
Yes.

372
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:56,662
Are you listening?

373
00:44:59,956 --> 00:45:01,208
You will never,

374
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:05,796
ever cut yourself again.

375
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,048
Do you understand?

376
00:45:08,965 --> 00:45:11,301
Have I made that perfectly clear?

377
00:45:12,678 --> 00:45:14,471
You're over that now.

378
00:45:15,389 --> 00:45:17,015
It's in the past.

379
00:45:23,397 --> 00:45:24,398
Yes.

380
00:45:28,068 --> 00:45:29,486
Never again.

381
00:45:32,948 --> 00:45:33,990
Okay.

382
00:45:35,826 --> 00:45:39,287
Now, you know what I want you to do?

383
00:45:41,832 --> 00:45:44,084
I want you to leave work early.

384
00:45:45,919 --> 00:45:48,046
You're a big girl, a grown woman.

385
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,090
Your mother doesn't need
to pick you up every day.

386
00:45:51,258 --> 00:45:56,179
I want you to take a nice walk home,
in the fresh air.

387
00:45:56,513 --> 00:45:58,432
Because you require relief.

388
00:45:58,807 --> 00:46:02,436
Because you won't be doing that anymore.

389
00:46:02,853 --> 00:46:04,229
Will you?

390
00:46:05,313 --> 00:46:06,565
No, sir.

391
00:46:08,775 --> 00:46:09,901
Good.

392
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,626
Look who's early.

393
00:46:28,462 --> 00:46:29,629
Mom,

394
00:46:31,798 --> 00:46:34,217
I'm going to walk home from now on.

395
00:46:36,344 --> 00:46:39,097
I took a shortcut through Hawkins Park,

396
00:46:39,514 --> 00:46:44,102
and it was as if I'd never
taken a walk by myself before.

397
00:46:44,644 --> 00:46:49,816
And when I thought about it, I realized
I probably never had taken a walk alone.

398
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,570
But because he had given me
the permission to do this,

399
00:46:53,653 --> 00:46:55,906
because he'd insisted I do it,

400
00:46:55,989 --> 00:47:00,702
I felt held by him as I walked along.

401
00:47:01,745 --> 00:47:03,622
I felt he was with me.

402
00:47:05,123 --> 00:47:10,754
At the same time, I was feeling
something growing in Mr. Grey,

403
00:47:11,505 --> 00:47:16,343
an intimate tendril creeping
from one of his darker areas,

404
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:22,390
nursed on the feeling that he had
discovered something about me.

405
00:47:24,476 --> 00:47:27,938
The next day, I didn't even bring
my cuticle scissors and my iodine.

406
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:30,816
But I did make another typing mistake.

407
00:47:31,024 --> 00:47:34,236
What is wrong with you?
That is all you have to do.

408
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:37,072
Type and answer the phones.
Is that beyond you?

409
00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:39,449
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it certainly seems to be.

410
00:47:39,533 --> 00:47:41,952
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize to me!

411
00:47:42,035 --> 00:47:45,872
What goes on inside that head of yours?

412
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:38,174
Come into my office and bring that letter.

413
00:48:51,438 --> 00:48:53,440
Put the letter on my desk.

414
00:49:04,618 --> 00:49:08,580
Now, I want you to bend over the desk,
so you're looking directly at it.

415
00:49:10,457 --> 00:49:14,836
Get your face very close to the letter,
and read the letter aloud.

416
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:18,548
I don't understand.

417
00:49:19,466 --> 00:49:21,301
There's nothing to understand.

418
00:49:22,052 --> 00:49:25,013
Put your elbows on the desk, bend over,

419
00:49:25,889 --> 00:49:29,476
get your face close to the letter
and read it aloud.

420
00:49:41,488 --> 00:49:42,739
"Dear Mr. Garvey,

421
00:49:43,657 --> 00:49:46,201
"I'm grateful to you for referring..."

422
00:49:58,588 --> 00:49:59,839
Continue.

423
00:50:04,636 --> 00:50:06,346
Ms. Holloway, read.

424
00:50:19,109 --> 00:50:21,653
"For referring me to your case.

425
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:28,493
"The subject of animal captivity has
been of interest to me for quite a while.

426
00:50:29,244 --> 00:50:32,831
"And my secretary has prepared
research material

427
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,959
"that I think you'll find illuminating.

428
00:50:36,626 --> 00:50:38,253
"If you would be so kind

429
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,426
"as to send me the June 5th letter
of which we spoke,

430
00:50:45,218 --> 00:50:48,304
"my associates and I
will review it immediately."

431
00:50:50,056 --> 00:50:53,727
"Please feel free to call me
at your earliest convenience.

432
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:58,064
"Yours sincerely, E. Edward Grey."

433
00:51:07,907 --> 00:51:09,325
Read it again.

434
00:51:15,415 --> 00:51:16,833
"Dear Mr. Garvey,

435
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,922
"I am grateful to you

436
00:51:25,258 --> 00:51:27,343

438
00:51:38,813 --> 00:51:40,231

00:51:48,656 --> 00:51:51,284
"that I think you'll find illuminating."

441
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:33,201
Now straighten yourself up
and go type it again.

442
00:54:21,309 --> 00:54:23,978
Ms. Holloway. Good letter.

443
00:54:44,374 --> 00:54:45,458
Mom?

444
00:54:47,335 --> 00:54:49,963
The lock can come off the cabinet now.

445
00:54:59,013 --> 00:55:00,348
Honey.

446
00:56:06,873 --> 00:56:10,001
Replace the light bulb
in the hallway to my office.

447
00:56:11,711 --> 00:56:12,712
120 watts.

448
00:56:13,463 --> 00:56:15,590
- Mr. Grey.
- Good to see you again, Mr. Garvey.

449
00:56:15,673 --> 00:56:18,051
You remember my secretary, Ms. Holloway.

450
00:56:18,134 --> 00:56:19,552
I'm sorry about the typo.

451
00:56:30,563 --> 00:56:35,401
It's porterhouse steak,
mashed, no, creamed potatoes,

452
00:56:35,777 --> 00:56:39,655
green peas, iced tea and ice cream.

453
00:56:39,906 --> 00:56:43,159
Okay. Just a scoop of creamed potatoes,

454
00:56:43,534 --> 00:56:48,664
and a slice of butter, four peas

455
00:56:50,083 --> 00:56:52,752
and as much ice cream
as you'd like to eat, doll.

456
00:57:33,292 --> 00:57:38,631
Cosmo's advice for getting your man
to share his feelings more intimately

457
00:57:39,006 --> 00:57:41,759
is to first try some breezy humor.

458
00:57:42,927 --> 00:57:48,099
Whatever you do, don't jump
too quickly into relationship talk.

459
00:59:07,887 --> 00:59:09,555
I'm your secretary.

460
00:59:10,848 --> 00:59:12,350
I'm your secretary.

461
00:59:12,517 --> 00:59:15,603
Just one scoop of creamed potatoes,

462
00:59:16,771 --> 00:59:18,564
one slice of butter,

463
00:59:19,482 --> 00:59:22,902
and four peas.

464
00:59:28,241 --> 00:59:30,201
How many inches away...

465
00:59:31,953 --> 00:59:35,039
Had you turned off the furnace
before you went down to the basement?

466
00:59:44,298 --> 00:59:45,341
Okay.

467
00:59:46,884 --> 00:59:49,595
Maybe you didn't squeeze it hard enough.

468
00:59:50,805 --> 00:59:53,307
Well, there's
always concern about it bursting.

469
00:59:56,978 --> 01:00:00,064
No! God, no.
I haven't had time to get to that.

470
01:00:01,274 --> 01:00:03,776
I'm doing as much as I possibly can.

471
01:00:09,448 --> 01:00:12,743
Where was she when
you crawled under the house?

472
01:00:16,455 --> 01:00:19,917
And the lockbox?
Did you cover it with dirt before you left?

473
01:00:20,418 --> 01:00:21,627
Mud upstairs?

474
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:26,090
No, I'm confused by that.

475
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:27,967
But...

476
01:00:29,135 --> 01:00:33,055
All right. This was the overweight child,
or your nephew from Baltimore?

477
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,725
On the banister.

478
01:00:43,482 --> 01:00:45,026
I have to work.

479
01:00:48,779 --> 01:00:51,949
Okay. Give me a week
and I'll have something for you.

480
01:00:52,033 --> 01:00:54,076
I'm sorry, the office has been

481
01:00:57,204 --> 01:00:58,623
overwhelmed.

482
01:01:01,667 --> 01:01:04,170
Mr. Grey, I'm going to go home now.

483
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:10,009
If you need any more typing done,
I could come back later.

484
01:01:15,848 --> 01:01:18,351
Thank you, Ms. Holloway, good night.

485
01:01:26,567 --> 01:01:28,069
That'll be all.

486
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,951
Here's just one example.

487
01:01:36,035 --> 01:01:39,914
He asked me out to Red Lobster
the other night for a nightcap.

488
01:01:40,122 --> 01:01:41,290
- Right.
- Yeah.

489
01:01:41,374 --> 01:01:44,502
And yesterday,
he asked if my hose were control-top,

490
01:01:44,585 --> 01:01:47,088
and if they were, I
certainly didn't need it.

491
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:49,382
- Your boss?
- Yeah.

492
01:01:49,674 --> 01:01:52,551
You should sue him for sexual harassment.

493
01:01:52,718 --> 01:01:54,845
- I like that idea.
- Hello.

494
01:01:54,929 --> 01:01:59,058
My lawyer's representing a woman who's
suing her boss for sexual harassment.

495
01:01:59,141 --> 01:02:00,893
Is he a good lawyer?

496
01:02:01,977 --> 01:02:03,896
He's the best.

497
01:02:04,355 --> 01:02:06,065
"He's the best."

498
01:02:06,148 --> 01:02:08,401
How long will he be there?

499
01:02:15,116 --> 01:02:16,575
Who was that?

500
01:02:16,867 --> 01:02:19,370
He checked himself into the hospital.

501
01:02:45,813 --> 01:02:46,814
Lee?

502
01:03:18,429 --> 01:03:20,181
Yes? Lee?

503
01:03:22,558 --> 01:03:23,601
Hi.

504
01:03:30,232 --> 01:03:31,942
I just wanted...

505
01:03:35,571 --> 01:03:37,114
I needed you...

506
01:03:39,074 --> 01:03:40,993
I wanted you to...

507
01:03:44,663 --> 01:03:46,457
You need me to what?

508
01:03:54,173 --> 01:03:58,302
I just wanted you not to forget
to go over the Lynch papers for tomorrow.

509
01:04:01,889 --> 01:04:03,390
No. I haven't.

510
01:04:05,017 --> 01:04:06,435
That's good.

511
01:04:10,022 --> 01:04:11,315
Thank you, Lee.

512
01:05:00,865 --> 01:05:05,035
After he turned me away from his house,
he put me back at my old desk,

513
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:07,913
and he just stopped doing it.

514
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,458
He threw out all his red pens.

515
01:05:12,543 --> 01:05:18,591
I kept making typos, but he just
treated me like a regular old secretary.

516
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,551
Are you coming?

517
01:05:20,676 --> 01:05:24,680
After a while,
I began to wonder if that was all I was.

518
01:05:28,267 --> 01:05:30,394
Have we received
any checks from Mr. Garvey?

519
01:05:30,561 --> 01:05:31,979
No, sir.

520
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,815
File these.

521
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:48,829
That's a pretty tie.
But I guess you won't be golfing today.

522
01:05:49,288 --> 01:05:50,289
What?

523
01:05:50,748 --> 01:05:51,999
Your tie.

524
01:05:52,374 --> 01:05:54,168
It has golfers on it.

525
01:06:00,925 --> 01:06:01,967
Right.

526
01:06:05,721 --> 01:06:06,972
Damn it.

527
01:09:14,785 --> 01:09:16,370
Don't be scared.

528
01:09:19,123 --> 01:09:20,582
I'm not. I'm...

529
01:09:31,844 --> 01:09:33,512
That's not what I meant.

530
01:09:37,057 --> 01:09:41,019
I'm sorry, I just... Look here.

531
01:09:42,938 --> 01:09:44,273
I'm sorry.

532
01:09:45,899 --> 01:09:49,528
Okay, but my clothes
get to stay completely on

533
01:09:49,611 --> 01:09:51,488
and I want the lights out.

534
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:23,687
Lee, Lee, Lee.

535
01:10:29,735 --> 01:10:31,278
I didn't hurt you, did 1?

536
01:10:33,906 --> 01:10:34,907
No.

537
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:09,293
Ms. Holloway.

538
01:12:12,004 --> 01:12:13,505
Yes, Mr. Grey?

539
01:12:13,755 --> 01:12:15,507
Come into my office.

540
01:12:18,135 --> 01:12:20,178
But Mr. Marvel is waiting.

541
01:12:23,181 --> 01:12:25,851
Ms. Holloway, come into my office.

542
01:12:26,101 --> 01:12:27,352
Yes, sir.

543
01:12:29,896 --> 01:12:31,648
Finally.

544
01:13:09,061 --> 01:13:10,395
Ignore it.

545
01:13:26,995 --> 01:13:28,914
Now, pull up your skirt.

546
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:32,918
Why?

547
01:13:34,294 --> 01:13:36,963
You're not worried
that I'm going to fuck you, are you?

548
01:13:38,548 --> 01:13:41,468
I'm not interested in
that, not in the least.

549
01:13:42,135 --> 01:13:44,054
Now, pull up your skirt.

550
01:13:45,597 --> 01:13:47,265
Lee, Lee, Lee, Lee

551
01:13:49,351 --> 01:13:50,394
Lee?

552
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:52,187
Lee?

553
01:13:55,732 --> 01:13:57,776
I said, pull up your skirt.

554
01:14:00,821 --> 01:14:02,072
Peter.

555
01:14:03,782 --> 01:14:07,285
I'm not going to be able to
come to the diner today, okay?

556
01:14:11,331 --> 01:14:12,332
Okay.

557
01:14:13,792 --> 01:14:17,504
That's okay.
Because... That's all right.

558
01:14:41,987 --> 01:14:44,656
Pull down your panty hose and underwear.

559
01:14:49,786 --> 01:14:52,330
I told you I'm not going to fuck you.

560
01:17:46,379 --> 01:17:48,173
Get these forms filled out,

561
01:17:48,673 --> 01:17:51,259
and then you can take your lunch break.

562
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:55,805
Bring me my sandwich, I'm eating in.

563
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,604
And you'll have the usual.

564
01:18:06,232 --> 01:18:08,151
No mayonnaise this time.

565
01:18:09,277 --> 01:18:13,657
And send in what's his name.

566
01:18:20,205 --> 01:18:21,247
Okay?

567
01:19:07,919 --> 01:19:09,587
Mr. Grey.

568
01:19:30,567 --> 01:19:34,904
Cock. Place your prick in my mouth.

569
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:37,073
Screw me.

570
01:19:56,134 --> 01:19:58,303
Shit. Fuck.

571
01:19:59,304 --> 01:20:01,931
Mayonnaise. Orchid.

572
01:20:03,683 --> 01:20:05,143
Mr. Grey.

573
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,001
Edward.

574
01:20:49,896 --> 01:20:54,150
Most people think that the best way
to live is to run from pain.

575
01:20:54,692 --> 01:20:58,696
But a much more joyful life
embraces the entire spectrum

576
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:00,406
of human feeling.

577
01:21:00,698 --> 01:21:04,869
If we can fully
experience pain, as well as pleasure,

578
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:08,832
we can live a much deeper
and more meaningful life.

579
01:21:57,422 --> 01:21:58,548
Ms. Holloway.

580
01:22:01,968 --> 01:22:03,177
Yes, sir?

581
01:22:03,261 --> 01:22:05,763
- Bring your typing scores.
- Okay.

582
01:22:30,121 --> 01:22:31,623
What happened?

583
01:22:34,208 --> 01:22:35,710
Are you pregnant?

584
01:22:38,379 --> 01:22:39,422
No.

585
01:22:41,132 --> 01:22:43,468
- Do you plan on getting pregnant?
- Could I...

586
01:22:43,551 --> 01:22:45,637
Do you plan on getting pregnant?

587
01:22:47,597 --> 01:22:48,640
No.

588
01:22:49,265 --> 01:22:51,476
Are you living in an apartment?

589
01:22:51,684 --> 01:22:52,936
A house.

590
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:54,938
Alone?

591
01:22:55,813 --> 01:22:57,357
With my parents.

592
01:22:58,983 --> 01:23:00,610
Are you married?

593
01:23:02,445 --> 01:23:03,488
No.

594
01:23:13,748 --> 01:23:14,999
Are those your scores?

595
01:23:16,793 --> 01:23:17,835
Yes.

596
01:23:24,717 --> 01:23:27,345
Do you really want to be my secretary?

597
01:23:30,223 --> 01:23:31,557
Yes, I do.

598
01:23:36,521 --> 01:23:40,358
This isn't just about typos, tape,
staples and pencils, is it, Lee?

599
01:23:41,192 --> 01:23:43,194
- No, sir.
- What?

600
01:23:44,654 --> 01:23:45,863
No, sir.

601
01:23:50,868 --> 01:23:54,789
I like you, Lee, but I don't think
I'm going to offer you the job.

602
01:23:57,542 --> 01:23:58,626
Why?

603
01:24:00,545 --> 01:24:02,296
It's your behavior.

604
01:24:04,382 --> 01:24:06,259
What about my behavior?

605
01:24:06,384 --> 01:24:07,885
It's very bad.

606
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:15,935
I'm sorry.
You can collect your things.

607
01:24:17,311 --> 01:24:19,397
- Time-out!
- Time-out?

608
01:24:19,564 --> 01:24:21,482
- You're fired.
- You're fired!

609
01:24:21,566 --> 01:24:24,235
You're fired. Now, Lee, get out!

610
01:24:31,701 --> 01:24:35,538
Why did you get glue smear
all over the Ramsey papers?

611
01:24:35,788 --> 01:24:38,374
Because I was fixing your shredder.
You saw me.

612
01:24:38,458 --> 01:24:41,669
Are you aware
you kick your shoes off under your desk?

613
01:24:41,753 --> 01:24:43,463
I can smell your feet.

614
01:24:43,546 --> 01:24:45,173
Do you ever change your panty hose?

615
01:24:45,256 --> 01:24:46,299
Every day.

616
01:24:46,549 --> 01:24:50,511
Every time you erase, there are
little shavings all over your desk.

617
01:24:50,762 --> 01:24:54,223
I told you to take that Walkman home.

618
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:58,478
I don't want the possibility
of your listening to music

619
01:24:58,561 --> 01:25:00,201
when you're supposed
to be working for me.

620
01:25:00,271 --> 01:25:03,816
I saw it in your desk. I know it's there.

621
01:25:04,233 --> 01:25:05,693
I'll move it.

622
01:25:45,858 --> 01:25:48,152
You have to go, or I won't stop.

623
01:25:49,487 --> 01:25:50,655
Don't.

624
01:25:54,367 --> 01:25:56,369
I cannot do this anymore.

625
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:01,457
But I want to know you.

626
01:26:27,859 --> 01:26:30,611
I'm so sorry for what happened between us.

627
01:26:31,863 --> 01:26:37,702
I've realized
what a terrible mistake I made with you.

628
01:26:39,662 --> 01:26:42,915
And I can only hope that you understand.

629
01:26:45,001 --> 01:26:48,212
Be assured you can count on me
for excellent references.

630
01:26:53,050 --> 01:26:54,051
Get out.

631
01:26:56,679 --> 01:26:57,889
Get out.

632
01:26:58,389 --> 01:27:00,975
- What are you doing...
- Get out!

633
01:28:16,676 --> 01:28:19,845
I opened the envelope
the second I got home.

634
01:28:20,012 --> 01:28:25,142
It was a check for $680.
More than he actually owed me.

635
01:28:25,601 --> 01:28:28,896
It occurred to me to tear up the check,
but I didn't.

636
01:28:29,522 --> 01:28:32,149
I felt like I was doing the right thing.

637
01:28:32,233 --> 01:28:35,027
And I didn't tell anybody about any of it.

638
01:28:36,279 --> 01:28:38,698
I pretended to go to work as usual,

639
01:28:39,282 --> 01:28:42,285
and watched his office
from across the street.

640
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:46,789
He hired a new girl
and changed the locks on the doors.

641
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,961
There was just nothing
for me to do about it.

642
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:08,728
My doctor at the institution once said,
"Every journey begins with the first step.”

643
01:29:09,437 --> 01:29:13,149
So I decided it was time
to meet someone new.

644
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:18,195
There was one who tried
to grab and pinch my nipples

645
01:29:18,279 --> 01:29:20,614
before we even made it to his car.

646
01:29:20,948 --> 01:29:21,949
Hi.

647
01:29:22,033 --> 01:29:25,161
Another guy kept ordering me
to pee on his patio,

648
01:29:25,244 --> 01:29:27,204
and when I refused, he said...

649
01:29:27,288 --> 01:29:28,873
I thought you were a masochist.

650
01:29:28,998 --> 01:29:32,043
Then there was the one
who liked being tied to a gas stove

651
01:29:32,209 --> 01:29:36,130
while the burners were on full blast,
and I had to throw tomatoes at him.

652
01:29:36,213 --> 01:29:37,465
Thank you.

653
01:29:37,548 --> 01:29:40,885
For a while I just stopped trying
and stayed at home,

654
01:29:41,218 --> 01:29:43,888
helping Dad adjust to his new sobriety.

655
01:29:44,722 --> 01:29:46,182
Until one day,

656
01:29:46,474 --> 01:29:50,144
out of the blue,
Peter proposed marriage to me

657
01:29:50,227 --> 01:29:52,646
in the basement of JCPenney's.

658
01:29:53,898 --> 01:29:57,401
I think I said yes
because I didn't know what else to do.

659
01:29:57,651 --> 01:30:01,030
Well, I guess I was a little lighter
than you in those days.

660
01:30:01,655 --> 01:30:02,865
Okay.

661
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:08,263
Now, if you hold your breath
through the wedding, you'll make it.

662
01:30:08,287 --> 01:30:10,331
Don't move. I'm going to get Stewart.

663
01:30:10,414 --> 01:30:13,250
You're beautiful.
You're just too beautiful.

664
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:38,901
Lee?

665
01:30:38,984 --> 01:30:41,570
No! I'm not supposed
to see you before the wedding!

666
01:30:41,654 --> 01:30:43,697
Where are you going?

667
01:30:58,963 --> 01:31:01,757
- I have something to say to you.
- Lee.

668
01:31:02,174 --> 01:31:03,551
I love you.

669
01:31:04,552 --> 01:31:06,679
Lee, you should not be here.

670
01:31:06,804 --> 01:31:08,139
I love you.

671
01:31:22,403 --> 01:31:25,489
I'm sorry,
but I don't believe that to be true.

672
01:31:25,948 --> 01:31:28,576
Well, it is true. It is.

673
01:31:31,662 --> 01:31:33,414
This matter was resolved

674
01:31:33,497 --> 01:31:36,542
when I received
your canceled severance check.

675
01:31:38,586 --> 01:31:39,962
I love you.

676
01:31:43,007 --> 01:31:46,010
We can't do this 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

677
01:31:46,302 --> 01:31:47,553
Why not?

678
01:32:02,651 --> 01:32:05,362
Put both your hands on the desk.
Palms down.

679
01:32:14,163 --> 01:32:15,915
I want to make love.

680
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:26,091
Keep both your feet on the floor
until I come back.

681
01:33:16,350 --> 01:33:17,351
Hello?

682
01:33:17,434 --> 01:33:20,604
In case you're wondering,
your fiancée is at my office.

683
01:33:54,597 --> 01:33:57,266
Lee, I'm very fond of you as well.

684
01:34:03,355 --> 01:34:05,733
It's you.

685
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:16,785
What are you...
What are you doing?

686
01:34:16,869 --> 01:34:20,748
Lee, I don't...
I don't know what the deal is with...

687
01:34:21,165 --> 01:34:23,751
I'm sorry,
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

688
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:28,505
I'm your fiancée, Lee!

689
01:34:28,631 --> 01:34:30,674
You are trespassing.

690
01:34:31,592 --> 01:34:34,428
You are making an unwarranted incursion,

691
01:34:34,511 --> 01:34:38,057
a gradual or stealthy
entrance into the sphere of another.

692
01:34:42,519 --> 01:34:44,355
Okay, Lee, Lee,

693
01:34:45,648 --> 01:34:51,028
are you doing something sexual right now?

694
01:34:52,196 --> 01:34:54,323
Does this look sexual to you?

695
01:34:56,909 --> 01:34:58,577
I don't know, Lee!

696
01:35:00,454 --> 01:35:02,164
Why don't you move your hands?

697
01:35:06,293 --> 01:35:08,212
Because I don't want to.

698
01:35:12,257 --> 01:35:13,300
No!

699
01:35:44,748 --> 01:35:49,503
Peter, I don't want you.

700
01:35:54,883 --> 01:35:56,343
Now, get out.

701
01:35:58,262 --> 01:35:59,471
Get out.

702
01:36:02,433 --> 01:36:03,600
Get out!

703
01:36:41,430 --> 01:36:43,432
- Here you go.
- Great.

704
01:36:45,017 --> 01:36:47,144
I brought you some peas.

705
01:36:51,982 --> 01:36:56,779
There are no statutes capable of controlling
the relations between men and women.

706
01:36:56,862 --> 01:36:58,989
There are other ways to show
your feelings, Lee.

707
01:36:59,823 --> 01:37:01,408
More conventional ways.

708
01:37:01,492 --> 01:37:05,496
I expect that dress back,
dry-cleaned, in perfect condition.

709
01:37:05,746 --> 01:37:08,916
I'm just going to leave you
with this literature.

710
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:13,295
Why don't you read about
women's struggle first?

711
01:37:28,936 --> 01:37:33,398
You know, Lee, there's a long
history of this in Catholicism.

712
01:37:34,191 --> 01:37:37,486
The monks used to wear thorns
on their temples.

713
01:37:38,153 --> 01:37:41,573
And the nuns, they wore them
sewn inside their clothing.

714
01:37:41,657 --> 01:37:45,285
Two years ago, when it didn't work out
between us, that was it.

715
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:47,329
I let him slip through my fingers.

716
01:37:47,412 --> 01:37:50,207
You are part of a great tradition.

717
01:37:50,290 --> 01:37:51,792
I admire you, Ms. Holloway.

718
01:37:51,917 --> 01:37:55,754
Without question, he is the most
isolated man I have ever known.

719
01:37:55,963 --> 01:37:58,006
The worm. Amazing.

720
01:37:58,131 --> 01:38:01,343
Who's to say that love needs to be
soft and gentle?

721
01:38:02,511 --> 01:38:05,889
"You are the child of
God's holy gift of life.

722
01:38:07,224 --> 01:38:10,561
"You come from me, but you are not me.

723
01:38:12,396 --> 01:38:18,193
"Your soul and your body are your own,
and yours to do with as you wish."

724
01:38:21,738 --> 01:38:23,407
Thank you, Daddy.

725
01:38:40,841 --> 01:38:42,050
Drinks.

726
01:38:42,926 --> 01:38:44,386
Take what you ordered.

727
01:38:44,469 --> 01:38:47,598
Now don't take anybody else's drink.
What you ordered.

728
01:38:47,723 --> 01:38:53,395
Fifty-seven bottles of beer on the wall

729
01:38:54,938 --> 01:38:59,860
Fifty-seven bottles of beer

730
01:39:02,195 --> 01:39:04,531
Take one down

731
01:39:19,630 --> 01:39:22,090
We're here on day three
of what has come to be known

732
01:39:22,174 --> 01:39:24,843
as the Lee Holloway hunger strike.

733
01:39:25,177 --> 01:39:28,013
Now, you may have heard
that there are those in the community

734
01:39:28,096 --> 01:39:31,892
who wonder if Ms. Holloway is even willing
to starve herself to death.

735
01:39:36,146 --> 01:39:39,316
In one way or another,
I've always suffered.

736
01:39:39,608 --> 01:39:41,652
I don't know why, exactly.

737
01:39:42,152 --> 01:39:46,239
But I do know that I'm not so scared
of suffering now.

738
01:39:46,949 --> 01:39:49,576
I feel more than I've ever felt,

739
01:39:49,826 --> 01:39:56,333
and I've found someone to feel with,
to play with, to love

740
01:39:57,584 --> 01:40:00,545
in a way that feels right for me.

741
01:40:01,463 --> 01:40:04,758
I hope he knows that
I can see that he suffers, too.

742
01:40:05,425 --> 01:40:07,552
And that I want to love him.

743
01:42:39,996 --> 01:42:46,503
Each cut, each scar, each burn,
a different mood or time.

744
01:42:47,420 --> 01:42:49,840
I told him what the first one was.

745
01:42:50,298 --> 01:42:53,009
I told him where the second one came from.

746
01:42:53,176 --> 01:42:55,053
I remembered them all.

747
01:42:56,138 --> 01:42:58,515
And for the first time in my life,

748
01:42:59,307 --> 01:43:01,601
I felt beautiful.

749
01:43:02,769 --> 01:43:04,813
Finally part of the earth.

750
01:43:06,148 --> 01:43:10,652
I touched the soil, and he loved me back.

751
01:43:32,257 --> 01:43:34,551
Where did you go to high school?

752
01:43:37,596 --> 01:43:39,639
What was your mother like?

753
01:43:41,892 --> 01:43:43,560
What was her name?

754
01:43:47,772 --> 01:43:52,694
What did it say under
your senior yearbook picture?

755
01:43:57,365 --> 01:43:59,326
Who was your first love?

756
01:44:03,330 --> 01:44:08,084
When did your heart first get broken?

757
01:44:14,633 --> 01:44:16,551
Where were you born?

758
01:44:25,393 --> 01:44:27,020
Des Moines, lowa.

759
01:44:47,707 --> 01:44:52,671
All our activities melted
into an everyday sort of life

760
01:44:53,129 --> 01:44:56,341
until we looked like
any other couple you'd see.

761
01:44:57,133 --> 01:45:01,596
Turn that over, yes. Just pull it tight.

762
01:45:02,973 --> 01:45:06,059
Now, these pillows like to be stacked.

763
01:45:08,395 --> 01:45:10,146
Largest to smallest.

764
01:45:12,190 --> 01:45:14,025
We had a June wedding,

765
01:45:14,109 --> 01:45:16,820
by ourselves at the justice of the peace.

766
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:20,865
Then, we honeymooned in the mountains.

767
01:45:21,574 --> 01:45:25,412
We only had the weekend
because Edward had to get back to work.
