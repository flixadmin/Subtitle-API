1
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:17,483
Aah!

2
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:18,817
Hi, Jade.

3
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,085
(Gasping)
Jackie.

4
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:21,820
Don't sneak up on me
like that.

5
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:23,856
Oh, I was sneaking up
on you?

6
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:26,191
You're supposed to be
back at the hotel.

7
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:29,161
Sure, limit my exposure
to other cultures.

8
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:31,163
Stifle my educational
potential.

9
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:35,467
Jade, I'm only trying
to stifle your potential
to be harmed.

10
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,436
What if the dark hand
were here, too,

11
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:38,904
looking for
the snake talisman?

12
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,039
Did you find it?

13
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:41,340
Ah, not yet.

14
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:43,142
You'd think
it were invisible.

15
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,578
Oh!
The dark hand!

16
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,066
Stay here.

17
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:48,006
I thought you
meant here with you.

18
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:51,944
Welcome to another episode
of <i> just the artifacts.</i>

19
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:55,981
Your passage
to the thrilling world
of archaeology.

20
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:58,550
I am your guide,
Wesley rank.

21
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:03,689
And today, I have braved
the treacherous
anaconda falls

22
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,191
to bring you
to a secret site--

23
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:10,462
the legendary lost temple
of <i> culebra gigante,</i>

24
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:12,364
a monstrous serpent,

25
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:15,100
said to be thousands
of years old.

26
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,468
And look!

27
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,637
This ancient chalk drawing

28
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,706
clearly indicates
that a snake cult

29
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,609
once worshipped
their fearsome idol,

30
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:26,245
right here
on this very spot.

31
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:29,381
Tsk. Not much
of a temple, is it?

32
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:32,518
And as for <i> culebra</i>
<i>itself,</i> well--(Laughs)

33
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,053
No big snakes around here.

34
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:36,588
What a goofball!

35
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,357
Jackie, why don't
you get in front
of the camera

36
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:39,858
and tell him
a thing or two?

37
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,628
Jade, I don't want
to be on TV.

38
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,196
We are on a top-secret
mission.

39
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,898
No one must know
what we're looking for.

40
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,032
You there!

41
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,600
Can't you see
we're filming?

42
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,002
Who are you two?

43
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,104
Uh, we're, um--

44
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:54,306
archeologists.

45
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:56,074
Stop that!
I mean cut!
Cut!

46
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,376
Edit them out.

47
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,077
Camera hog.

48
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,980
This is my dig.
There's nothing here
for you. Go away.

49
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,482
What are you
looking for anyway?

50
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:05,784
Uh...The exit.
Bye-bye.

51
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,856
Chan...

52
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:13,592
We really have
to stop using
the same travel agent.

53
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:14,793
The dark hand!

54
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:17,062
More archaeologists?

55
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,031
Quite the popular
"secret" site.

56
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,266
The talisman.

57
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:23,368
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Ohh!

58
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,703
Talisman?

59
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,405
The snake talisman.

60
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,174
(Grunts)

61
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,944
Hyah!

62
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,082
Aaii!

63
00:03:37,084 --> 00:03:38,917
Oww! Ohh!

64
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:40,819
Whoa.

65
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,967
Wow! He's an archeologist?

66
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:57,369
Jackie's totally ready
to host his own show--

67
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:00,005
educational, but with an
action/adventure slant.

68
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,808
We're thinking
of calling it
<i>Jackie chan can.</i>

69
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,643
I'm the plucky cohost.

70
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,411
Aw, cut! Cut!

71
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,879
Edit that out, too.

72
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,616
Tch. Rank
is totally rank.

73
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,722
Whoa...The snake talisman!

74
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,790
Hmm...

75
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,225
Talisman.

76
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,661
Whoaa!

77
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,964
Twofer.
Jackie, look!

78
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,766
Busy, Jade.

79
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,769
Sorry.
Camera loves him.

80
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,904
I want another shot
of that.

81
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,273
Get in tight.

82
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,160
Down!

83
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,865
Aah!
- Aah!

84
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,310
(Gasping)

85
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:12,778
Ratso?

86
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,279
Ratso.
Ratso!

87
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,515
Heh heh. Did you see
all the fishies?

88
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,617
Ow!
- Ow!
- Ow!

89
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,252
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

90
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:21,920
Piranha!
Piranha!

91
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,358
(Grunts)

92
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,930
Come on.
The snake talisman
was part of the drawing.

93
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,165
Right over...

94
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:34,933
Here?

95
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:36,335
Oh, it's gone!

96
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:37,703
Destroyed!

97
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,504
The dark hand?
No.

98
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,306
They were
too preoccupied.

99
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,342
Then who?

100
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:46,545
And thus <i> just the artifacts</i>
has the exclusive scoop

101
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:50,349
on this infamous
snake talisman,
whatever that is.

102
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,684
You do think everyone
was fighting

103
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,653
over the chalk drawing,
don't you?

104
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:57,022
Uh, maybe we should ask
an archeologist.

105
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,257
<i>I am</i>
- <i>an</i> a<i> rcheologist.</i>

106
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,693
Oh, right. Destroying
4,000-year-old drawings,
yeah.

107
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,128
That's what
archaeologists do.

108
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,696
Pipe down, you.

109
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,235
Oh...

110
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:12,070
(Cell phone rings)
Hello?

111
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:15,374
Jackie, did you find
the snake talisman?

112
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:16,575
No, uncle.

113
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,677
There was only
a big empty cave

114
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,812
with a drawing
of the snake talisman.

115
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,214
And a ton of bats.

116
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:25,317
Wha? You are not
supposed to be
in a cave of bats.

117
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,387
You are supposed to be
in the temple of snakes,

118
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:31,189
guarded by
one very big snake.

119
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:34,059
Well, there was no big snake
and no temple.

120
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,595
And now there is no drawing.

121
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:39,331
Well, we can always
see it on rank's show.

122
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:43,568
Or we can find rank now
and get a sneak preview.

123
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:48,206
Uh, no big v.
- We haven't spotted chan yet.

124
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,642
In fact, we're still
at the airport.

125
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,578
A mix-up with the bags.

126
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,915
Yeah, I told tohru
we should just do carry on,
but, hey, whatcha gonna do?

127
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,083
Yoop!

128
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,286
(Gasping)
Hang on.

129
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:02,788
T-monster wants ya.

130
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,158
Rest assured, master.
We will find
your talisman.

131
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,033
And I will break
Jackie chan.

132
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,543
Time to tuck you in.

133
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,087
(Snoring)

134
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,358
We're in the middle
of nowhere.

135
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,327
What are we going
to view it on?

136
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,562
Tch. They do a TV show.

137
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,333
Bwaa!

138
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,605
Chirp chirp.
Chirp chirp.

139
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,907
Chirp chirp.
Chirp chirp.

140
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,410
Heh. Sorry.

141
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,524
Here you go.
The talisman. See?

142
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,325
Yes. But what
does it mean?

143
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,162
Aw, crikey!

144
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,164
Sorry
we didn't rewind.
Thank you.

145
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,002
I had the weirdest
dream--

146
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,037
a bird that chirp
like a car alarm.

147
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,373
That was no dream.
That was thieves!

148
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,911
Dahh--ahh...My tape.

149
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:09,047
Wait, they went
to all this trouble,
and didn't take it.

150
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,584
Perhaps there's more
to this drawing than
the drawing itself.

151
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:13,818
Ooh, that's deep.

152
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,886
Zip it, you.

153
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:19,257
Why does the snake
bite its own tail?

154
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,859
Maybe it can't see
what it's eating

155
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,894
because it's got a talisman
stuck in its eye.

156
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:26,998
The snake biting its tail
symbolizes the circle of life.

157
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,201
The end is in the beginning!

158
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,736
The drawing was a map,
telling us

159
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:36,107
that the talisman is
at the cave where we began.

160
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:37,576
In the eye of the snake?

161
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,312
Could be dangerous.

162
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:41,947
You're going back
to the hotel.

163
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:43,114
Oh...

164
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:48,987
Hi, Jackie.

165
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,524
Jade, stop
following me.

166
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:55,293
I got here first.
Technically,
you followed me.

167
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,362
(Sighs)

168
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,100
Don't bother.
I checked everything.

169
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,102
No sign of a temple
or a talisman.

170
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,389
Whoa.
Score one for the jackster.

171
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,831
The temple of <i> culebra gigante.</i>

172
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,367
Right under our noses.

173
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,168
More like
right above our heads.

174
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,306
Snake eye.

175
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,308
See Jackie?
Nothing to worry about.

176
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,542
The snake's
not even real.

177
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:45,777
Wait here.

178
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:46,945
Yeah, yeah.

179
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,619
(Grunting)

180
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,930
(Sighs) Huh?

181
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,601
A snake!

182
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,272
Ahh! Ah!

183
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,576
Jackie, they're all snakes!

184
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:21,012
Bad snake, bad snake,
bad snake. Yaa.

185
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,714
Uhh!

186
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,183
Uhh. Ahh...

187
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,685
(Sighs)

188
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,353
Jackie, you scaled it!

189
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,954
Er, so to speak.

190
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,390
(Grunts)

191
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,597
Oh! Ohh!

192
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:40,965
I got it. I got it!

193
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:43,635
How wrong you are,
little lady.

194
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:45,503
Eh, you there,
camera guy.

195
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,072
Roll film, quickly.

196
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,845
Welcome, I'm Wesley rank,

197
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:56,414
and you're watching
<i>just the artifacts</i>

198
00:11:56,416 --> 00:12:00,919
at the legendary once lost
temple of <i> culebra gigante.</i>

199
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:04,289
I have just braved
a treacherous climb

200
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:08,293
to the temple's harrowing
heights to bring you this...

201
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:10,361
The snake talisman.

202
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:12,964
Liar! Liar! Liar!

203
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,500
Ow! That hurt!

204
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,836
Edit that out.

205
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:22,307
Where did this mysterious
talisman come from?

206
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,042
Why was it here?

207
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,411
And what is that awful racket?

208
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,489
Aah!
Aah!
- Aah!

209
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:38,957
Jade!

210
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,126
Aah!
Aah!
- Aah!

211
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:50,835
Yaaa!

212
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,004
Everything all right?

213
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:54,205
Maybe a sprain.

214
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,740
I meant the camera!

215
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,208
Now, point it
at that exit.

216
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,743
Let's wrap this up.

217
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,150
Ohh! Uh...

218
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,718
Ohh...

219
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,653
Jackie,
are you ok?

220
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:09,988
Oh, I will be

221
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,423
after a week in traction.

222
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:16,427
And with this
phenomenal find
firmly in hand,

223
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:19,731
this is Wesley rank
bidding you farewell

224
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:22,433
till next time
on <i> just the artifacts.</i>

225
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,639
Daah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

226
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,210
Let me guess.
Edit that out?

227
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,351
Seor gigante, I presume?

228
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:49,928
Oh! Why's he
looking at me?

229
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,596
Because it is the guardian
of the temple,

230
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,097
and <i> you</i> have the talisman.

231
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,201
Yaaa!

232
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:57,268
I don't want it.

233
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,440
Here!

234
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,567
Careful, Jackie.
It's thropwing a hissy!

235
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,709
I get it.
It can't bite us up here.

236
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,380
It can't bite you
up there!

237
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,349
Whoaa!

238
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:46,251
Uhh! Oh! Oh!

239
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,986
Ohh...

240
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,858
Jackie!
Use the talisman!

241
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,828
We don't know
what power it has,
too dangerous.

242
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,097
Tch, like jumbo
the snake's not?

243
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,142
Crikey!
I didn't tell you
to film that!

244
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,044
Hello...
I'm blinding it.

245
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:14,545
Snakes don't have eyelids.

246
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,815
Aaah!

247
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:19,017
Jackie, climb up!

248
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,451
Me first.
Me first.

249
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:21,552
You next.

250
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:22,687
Doesn't want me, man.

251
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,527
Hyah!

252
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,662
Uhh!

253
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,164
Throw me the vine.

254
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,565
Throw me the talisman.

255
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,406
Thank you.

256
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,473
The vine!

257
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,210
Nice guy.

258
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,979
(Growls)

259
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,150
Come on! Come on!

260
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,754
The network's
gonna love this.

261
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,396
Aah!

262
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,667
(Nervous mumbling)

263
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:13,838
(Panting)

264
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,407
Sleazo took off
with the talisman.

265
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:19,077
(Humming)
Get out of here,
on my way--

266
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,182
the talisman.

267
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,956
Yaa!
- Yaa!
Yaa!

268
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:41,366
No sign
of the flying monkeys.

269
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,034
Rats with wings.

270
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,006
I'll take the bats.

271
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,752
(Grunting)

272
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,991
Heh. It's all yours,
mate.

273
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,767
Uh-oh.

274
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,771
Aah!

275
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,205
Oh...

276
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,673
Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

277
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,414
Jade! Go! Go! Go!

278
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,284
Ooff!
- Oof!

279
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,687
Why are you still here?

280
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,956
Uh, camera guy
was right. I'm a jerk.

281
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,825
I couldn't leave
without apologizing--

282
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:42,093
not now!

283
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:43,227
Run!

284
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,264
Aaaah!

285
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,070
Aah!
Aah!
- Aah!

286
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:56,941
Oh-ohh...

287
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:58,743
Gotcha.
- Aah!

288
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,378
Aah!
Aah!
- Aah!

289
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,779
Waaah!

290
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,221
(Coughing)

291
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:12,523
Waaah!

292
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:13,858
Incoming!

293
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,331
Belly flop!

294
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,835
Ow! Ow!
Piranha!

295
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,174
Oh. I hate piranha.
Ow. Ow.

296
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,578
(Sighs) Adios, culebra.

297
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,116
The only snake I ever
want to see after this
is the snake talisman.

298
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:40,284
Huh? It's gone!

299
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:50,528
Rank.

300
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,063
What a snake!

301
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,538
Welcome. I'm Wesley rank,

302
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,207
and you're watching
<i>just the artifacts</i>

303
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:07,445
at the legendary once lost
temple of <i> culebra gigante.</i>

304
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:10,781
I have just braved
a treacherous climb

305
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:14,952
to the temple's harrowing
heights to bring you this...

306
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,754
The snake talisman.

307
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,457
I'm on TV!

308
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:20,758
Rank didn't edit that out?

309
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,660
Liar! Liar! Liar!

310
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,328
Ow! That hurt.

311
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,899
Aah! Aah! Aah!
(Sobbing)

312
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:32,537
Welcome to a special edition
of <i> just the artifacts.</i>

313
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:35,339
Wesley rank may not know how
to treat little girls,

314
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,675
but he sure knows how
to scream like one.

315
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,278
Ha ha ha ha.
I'm dino stefanson,

316
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,046
and I'll be your new guide.

317
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,215
Go, camera guy.

318
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:45,583
Look!

319
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:47,185
You'll also get
the full scoop

320
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,854
on how we recovered
this rare snake talisman

321
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,723
from a local pawn shop
rank sold it to.

322
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,760
We, of course,
donated the artifact
to the New York museum.

323
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,564
(Sigh) After what
we've been through,

324
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:02,900
getting the talisman from
the museum should be a snap.

325
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,335
We're off to the jungle.

326
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,907
New York,
the concrete jungle.
Duh.

327
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:16,347
Man: Hey, Jackie.
- Yes.

328
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:19,016
Have you ever worked with
any dangerous animals?

329
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,219
Lion. Lion. Yes.
In Africa.

330
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,354
Small--small lion.

331
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:25,089
I picked up the lion,
hi, hi, hi.

332
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:28,826
But the native, the small--
the native, aah! Aah! Aah!

333
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,394
I said, what? What?

334
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,797
But the mom come behind me.

335
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,633
Then I run,
climb up to the tree.

336
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,568
The lion, grr, grr, grr!

337
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,804
Almost touch my feet.

338
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:44,141
Remember, lion can climb up
to the tree.
