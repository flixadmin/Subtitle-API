00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,760
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,840
Hello.

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,760
Mallus wasn't the only prisoner
to escape.

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,280
And now there's magic.

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,280
Oh, my God.

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,120
An unknown number of
dangerous magical beings

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,280
got spat out across the timeline
and now must be sent to hell.

8
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,120
Going somewhere, Raymond?

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,360
You think it's Nora.

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,120
And if the Time Bureau
finds her first,

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,160
she's going to tell them you're
the one who helped her escape.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,640
Ma'am, your crown jewels are here.

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,760
There's absolutely
no reason to worry.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,760
All is in order.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,840
Excellent.

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,400
I shall wear them out so my
people can adore their queen.

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,840
Yes, of course, ma'am.

18
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,160
Will you be waving from
the north balcony or the south?

19
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,120
I was thinking something
a little more intimate.

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,240
<i>God save the Queen</i>

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,440
<i>The fascist regime</i>

22
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,920
<i>They made you a moron</i>

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,440
<i>A potential H bomb</i>

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,080
<i>No future for you</i>

25
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,360
Wow. Red beans and rice
didn't miss Her Majesty.

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,360
{\an5}Now I understand how Mr. Mix-a-Lot
got his knighthood.

27
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,800
<i>Sir, Sir</i>

28
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,920
Guys, guys, a little
professionalism, please.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,840
What kind of ripple effect
are we really looking at here, Nate?

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,320
Okay. Right now,
the queen gets institutionalized,

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,080
{\an5}the British monarchy fails,

32
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,040
{\an5}and England descends into chaos.

33
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,520
Anarchy in the UK.

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,120
Which is weird but... paranormal?

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,000
Well, something freaky
is definitely at the heart of this.

36
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,600
Our magic-tracking device
detected a massive spike.

37
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,040
All right, then we got a live one.

38
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,600
{\an5}Punk rock London.
Nate, you ready?

39
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,600
{\an5}Well, Ava asked me to
stick around and help launch

40
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,320
{\an5}the magic operations here.

41
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,680
We need to establish
procedure, protocols,

42
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,800
command structure.

43
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,480
So... desk job.

44
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,080
Nate Heywood, cubicle guy.

45
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,840
{\an5}Sad little plant on his desk.
Really?

46
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,360
It's prestigious, Sara.

47
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,200
{\an5}And then when everything's
up and running

48
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,240
{\an5}I come back to the Waverider.

49
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,720
Fine.

50
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,280
Cool kids are off to the Jolly Old.

51
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,000
This is very sleek.

52
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,000
{\an5}Handles all your messaging and data,

53
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,560
{\an5}keeps accurate time in any era,
and counts your steps,

54
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,160
which, to me,
is a little overrated...

55
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,040
and it also contains the air totem.

56
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,480
Thanks, Ray. I love it.

57
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,880
{\an5}Well, you're actually the one
I should be thanking.

58
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,600
{\an5}I feel like you're the only
one I can talk to

59
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,760
{\an5}about this whole Nora thing.

60
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,560
{\an5}Secret's safe with me.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,120
{\an5}Doing bad things for good reasons
is practically our mission statement.

62
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,840
Even Amaya did it.

63
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,440
{\an5}Yeah, but this
is kind of complicated.

64
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,320
{\an5}The others can handle
complicated.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Maybe.

66
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,240
And then, there were five.

67
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,400
Shorter bathroom lines.

68
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,360
{\an5}Yeah, but no one to watch
Patrick Swayze movies with.

69
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,320
Nate will be back soon.

70
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,760
{\an5}In the meantime, we need to go back
before the monarchy goes anarchy.

71
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,880
Never thought I'd get to meet
the Queen.

72
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,440
Not gonna happen.
Too risky.

73
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,360
And besides, she's not the one
setting off Ray's magic-o-meter.

74
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,840
The Queen's favorite new band is...

75
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,080
The Smell.

76
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,520
"The Smell"?

77
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,040
{\an5}Never heard of them,
and I know of every rubbish

78
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,640
{\an5}punk band there is in London.

79
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,520
{\an5}That's because they didn't
exist in this timeline.

80
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Gideon?

81
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,680
<i>The Queen's cheeky jig launched
The Smell's rise to stardom.</i>

82
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,960
<i>They were known as much
for their music</i>

83
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,040
<i>as for a series of improbable
anti-establishment pranks.</i>

84
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,800
All with a magical signature.

85
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,800
Okay, so we're looking
for someone in the band.

86
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,680
{\an5}We could be dealing
with demonic possession,

87
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,600
{\an5}mind control, illusion,

88
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,640
{\an5}or maybe just the run-of-the-mill
royal dementia.

89
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Hold on a minute.

90
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,800
There's your magic man right there.

91
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,960
Obsessed with riches,
given to mischief.

92
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,360
That Irishman there is a leprechaun.

93
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,400
Sorry.
Are you being serious or racist?

94
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,280
{\an5}- Both, love.
- Why is the weasel running the show?

95
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,640
{\an5}If you've got a problem
with me, pie-head,

96
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,000
why don't you just say?

97
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,200
I got a problem with you.

98
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,320
I'm running it, and I say
we need to get close to that band,

99
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,520
which shouldn't be a problem

100
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,560
because everybody left
on this ship is a punk.

101
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,000
Except for haircut.

102
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,480
He hasn't broken a rule in his life.

103
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,880
Yep. Not a single rule.

104
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,720
The Hole-radle of punk rock

105
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,640
and the stickiest floor
in the British Isles.

106
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,760
{\an5}Sounds lovely.
You kids have fun.

107
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll have a bottle of hand sanitizer
when you come back.

108
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,120
Oh, you gotta love that sound.

109
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,920
- What?
- The music, it's the dog's bollocks.

110
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,040
Sorry, I can't hear you
over the terrible music.

111
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,520
We're The Smell,
and you're a bunch of mingers.

112
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,640
And we'll be back
when we feel like it.

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,200
All right, guys, here's our chance.

114
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,800
Somebody's got to slip backstage
and get in with the band.

115
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,560
Yeah, leave it to me. I used to play
here with Mucous Membrane.

116
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,720
I know my way around.

117
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,720
And besides, you're all bloody Yanks.

118
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,240
- Not you.
- Why not?

119
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,560
I don't like him.

120
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,760
Always perfidious Albion, is it?
Never trust a Brit.

121
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
Something like that.

122
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,800
Guys, really,
we don't have time for this.

123
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,920
Somehow Mister Rory
here hasn't realized

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,240
that if he's going to play with fire,
he's going to get burned.

125
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,840
Don't.

126
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,480
Fight!

127
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,920
Oi! You lot!

128
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,120
Thanks for the lift, mate.
Get us out of here!

129
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,320
Come on! Go! Let's go!

130
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,640
Oh, let me out, I'm gonna puke.

131
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,840
Don't let the suit fool you.
Our man's a punk.

132
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,200
He drove on the wrong side of
the road the whole way here.

133
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,360
- I did?
- Nice.

134
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,920
See you around, mate.

135
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,600
All right, Sara,
I found their hideout.

136
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,080
Heading back to the Waverider.

137
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,760
No, Ray, you are our
guy on the inside.

138
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,280
<i>Look, loud music
makes my nose bleed.</i>

139
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,240
I am not a punk.

140
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,640
<i>Well, you are now.
You stay with that band.</i>

141
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,920
<i>Ray? Ray, you there?</i>

142
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,440
You're pressing the button too hard.

143
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,200
Oh, right, yeah, it's my first time.

144
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,360
Listen, mate, there's an old trick
for unmasking leprechauns.

145
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,600
You spill a bunch of grain
in front of them on the floor,

146
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,040
and they're compelled
to count every kernel.

147
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,360
Really? That sounds bizarre.
That's not true.

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,280
- Is that true?
- That's a stupid plan.

149
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,200
Have you got
a better one, big man?

150
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,400
- I don't do magic tricks.
- Oh, great, so the plan is no plan.

151
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,680
- Is that your idea?
- Enough! Both of you.

152
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,280
You know what?
It is 1977 in London Town.

153
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,920
I'm going to enjoy the sights.

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,560
Good luck with your magic problem.

155
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,040
Did you guys just make
Constantine leave?

156
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,760
We'll get back to you, Ray.

157
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,040
- Not your finest work, bud.
- He's gonna get us killed.

158
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,160
You just don't like guys with ties.

159
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,600
That's right. It's like a little flag

160
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,840
hanging from someone's neck,
saying, "I'm a liar."

161
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,240
Look, I'll have Zari follow him,
all right?

162
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,360
But in the meantime,
you and I need to help Ray

163
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,560
find this magical creature
so we can send it to hell

164
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,680
before this whole team falls apart.

165
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,520
- How's it going?
- Good

166
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Great.

167
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,600
All right.
This should be all of it.

168
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,160
These protocols were developed
by Rip and myself

169
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,320
over the last six years.

170
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,640
I did the drawings.
Thank you, Gary.

171
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,600
So, your job is to just update
all of this

172
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,880
for our new magical fugitives, okay?

173
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,200
You got it, boss.

174
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,840
And as we say at the Time Bureau,
the adventure is in the details.

175
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
Have fun.

176
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,880
You okay?

177
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,240
I'm good, I'm good.

178
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,000
It's just... I know you guys do
things differently here

179
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,640
I just didn't know it was
so protocol-centric.

180
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,880
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

181
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,560
Look, I know you're
used to zooming around

182
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,160
in a time machine
with all your best friends,

183
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,480
shooting from the hip
and saving history.

184
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,840
- Always.
- But you know,

185
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,320
the Bureau is not all protocols.

186
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,840
I'm listening.

187
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,320
Come with.

188
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,640
Buckle up Nate, it's Taco Monday.

189
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,640
Instead of Taco Tuesday?
Oh, we dare to defy.

190
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,120
Whoa. Taco delivery.

191
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,240
Are you Mr. Green?

192
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,520
Oh. Name's Gary.

193
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,480
Mr. Green's in the conservatory
with the lead pipe.

194
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,920
Sorry. Bad joke.

195
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,440
No, that was great. Yeah.

196
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,200
My name's Mona, by the way,
just... kind of like Mona Lisa

197
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,360
without the Lisa, so it's just Mona.

198
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
Cool.

199
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,480
Time Bureau?
Is that what this place is?

200
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,080
You know, they just never tell us.
What's a Time Bureau?

201
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,720
You know, like, daylight savings
and time zones and stuff like that?

202
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
We're in charge of that.

203
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,520
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

204
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,040
Oh, it's actually just one...

205
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,080
- Oh...
- One per person.

206
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,520
Okay. Bye.

207
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
Okay.

208
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,120
Got it. Yeah.

209
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,520
What, did we forget
something in the van?

210
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,160
No, I... Seeing as I drove you guys
and you didn't pay me,

211
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,320
I thought maybe I could
hang out with you blokes.

212
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,040
Down with the monarchy, right?

213
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,240
I didn't catch your name.

214
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,120
Ray...ge.

215
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,400
- Rayge?
- Yep, Rayge

216
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,120
it's what they call me,
on account of all my various rages

217
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
against the machine.

218
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,560
Well, I'd like to see some rage,
Rayge.

219
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,600
I'm Charlie. Come on in.

220
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,000
Guys, do you remember our driver?

221
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,560
Well, he goes by the name Rayge,
because of his wicked rages.

222
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,440
- Yeah?
- About what?

223
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,520
Disco music, right?

224
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,760
The Queen, obviously.

225
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,280
Doing chores in a timely fashion.

226
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,600
We hate disco, too.

227
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,320
- Yeah. Hate disco.
- Hate it.

228
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,200
I had to move
from New York just to get away

229
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,720
from tight trousers
and platform shoes.

230
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,600
Do you know how hard
it is to walk in those?

231
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,240
Right, let's hear a rage, then.

232
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,000
Go on.

233
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,760
At this hour?
No, I don't like to force them.

234
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,920
You know, I just let them
come naturally.

235
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,160
But it'll happen.

236
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,880
What about you guys?
You know? What makes you tick?

237
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,320
We're The Smell. We're a band.

238
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,840
What more is there to say.

239
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,320
We're a bit more than that, Declan.

240
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,480
We're a movement.
We're gonna shock the system.

241
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,840
Wake up all the drones.

242
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,280
Present company included.

243
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,560
Sorry, the rice-verywhere.

244
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,200
- Sorry. You see that, Declan?
- What?

245
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,640
The rice. The grains of rice...
they're everywhere.

246
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,840
Sorry if you feel the urge to have
to pick up every single piece.

247
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,200
Mate, are you trying
the leprechaun test on me?

248
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,080
Do you know how hurtful
you're being right now?

249
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,280
Deeply.

250
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,600
Declan's a bit touchy
about being ginger.

251
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,320
- You're all right, Rayge.
- Well, Rayge has got to leave.

252
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,920
We've got to plan
Operation Mum's Bum.

253
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,560
Mum's Bum. Mum's Bum?

254
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,680
Hey, that sounds fun.
I could get into that.

255
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,600
- Well, we could use a driver.
- Can we trust him?

256
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,480
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

257
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,480
So, that's the big highlight?

258
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,360
Eating tacos one day
before the rest of America?

259
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
Yeah.

260
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,400
Oh, hey. There's a blip
on the magic-o-meter.

261
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,520
It's from the Pleistocene period.

262
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,720
Clear your schedule.

263
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,960
We've got a report to write.

264
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,600
Or... or... or...

265
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,480
Or we can handle this ourselves.

266
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,640
Without approval?
That sounds dangerous.

267
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,640
You've got two, but I'm sort of
down to my last nipple.

268
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,560
Gary, Ava hired me to optimize
this department, okay?

269
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,800
And I can't do that waiting
three days for approval.

270
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,920
And we can be time bros.

271
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,280
- What?
- We can be time bros.

272
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,240
- Time bros?
- Yeah.

273
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,840
- Me and you?
- Mm-hmm.

274
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,040
- Oh, but...
- We can reheat your tacos later.

275
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,280
- Okay. Yeah, let's go.
- Yeah.

276
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,440
- This way.
- Okay.

277
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,880
Okay, here we are.

278
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,400
Where are we?

279
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,560
St. James' Park,
next to Buckingham Palace.

280
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,560
St. James' Park, you say.

281
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,240
All right, Ray, we're listening.

282
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,040
The Queen's royal corgis are taking
their afternoon constitutional.

283
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,960
You're gonna nab
one of those little yippers

284
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,480
And bring him back to us.

285
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,560
We're not gonna hurt the dog,
are we?

286
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,520
No. We're gonna hurt the Queen.

287
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,400
She treats her dogs
to beef Wellington

288
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,080
while poor people are starving.

289
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,560
It's time to expose her hypocrisy.

290
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,000
Okay, yeah. No problem.
Dogs love me.

291
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,920
Yes, problem.
They're the Queen's dogs.

292
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,040
They're gonna be guarded.

293
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,280
Question... will the dogs
be heavily guarded?

294
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,680
Well, that's your problem.

295
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,480
It's time to see how far you'll go.

296
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,080
If you got a rage stored up,
now's the time.

297
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,440
Ray, we can hear you gulping
through the comms.

298
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,520
Do we really have to do this?

299
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,560
I mean, we know that Declan
is not a leprechaun.

300
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,680
Well, your machine says
one of them is magical,

301
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,400
so our job is to find 'em
and get it gone.

302
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,960
<i>You're gonna have to do
this the old-fashioned way.</i>

303
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,040
Corgi- napping?

304
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,040
Gaining their trust
and betraying them.

305
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,560
We'll help you out with the corgis.

306
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,200
- QB or wet work?
- QB.

307
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,840
<i>Ray, Rory is going to walk
you through this one.</i>

308
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,840
<i>Easy-peasy, lemon-squeezy.</i>

309
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
Oh, I see them.

310
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,960
Let's go, pups.
Up and at 'em, Sparky.

311
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,760
You see that bench in front of you?

312
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,200
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Sit on it.

313
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,680
<i>Okay.</i>

314
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,880
All right, Ray.

315
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,640
I feel like I should do something,
like maybe a distraction.

316
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Just wait.

317
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,840
This would go a lot faster

318
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,040
if you just do your thing, Gordon.

319
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,560
Can we just nick his van already?

320
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,600
That's why we're here, innit?
Give him a minute.

321
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,640
Mick, you were right.
It's just the dog walker now.

322
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,400
Go and ask for the corgi.

323
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,400
Excuse me, sir. I don't know
if this is royal etiquette,

324
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,520
but, if it may please the Crown...

325
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,320
May I borrow one of those corgis?

326
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,840
Just take him.

327
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,240
Oh. There are those famous
British manners I've heard of.

328
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Thank you.

329
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
Good choice.

330
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,520
How long do you think the poor lad
is going to last in the clink?

331
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,760
Blimey.

332
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,800
My word, that young man
stole a royal corgi.

333
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,360
He did it. He bloody did it.
Go on, roll up, Declan.

334
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,000
Go, go, go, go, go!

335
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,960
<i>We start off the hour with an update</i>

336
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,520
<i>of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth's
beloved corgi, Sparky.</i>

337
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,320
<i>Reported missing
earlier this afternoon,</i>

338
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,920
<i>he has finally been
found behind bars</i>

339
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,800
<i>at the South West London
Animal Rescue for Dogs.</i>

340
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,040
<i>From the looks of it, the pooch
has fallen in with a bad crowd.</i>

341
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,800
<i>Well, at least someone
from Buckingham Palace</i>

342
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,040
<i>has glimpsed the real world.</i>

343
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,760
Rayge, Rayge, Rayge!

344
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,080
To the table!

345
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,240
Oh! Snacks, I'm famished.

346
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,000
It'll only hurt for a minute, love.

347
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,400
- Hurt?
- A tattoo.

348
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,800
Yeah, we all have 'em.
Get 'em after our first prank.

349
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,360
It's a Smell tradition.

350
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,720
Once you get one,
you're one of us, mate.

351
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,600
Oh, that needle's been
sterilized, right?

352
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,840
See, Charlie, told ya. He's a narc.

353
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,000
No, he just doesn't get it.

354
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,760
This isn't a tattoo,
it's a statement.

355
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,760
That ink says you won't
swallow the crap

356
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,160
they force down our throats.

357
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,880
Sometimes you have to do
bad things for good reasons.

358
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,000
So, what do you say?

359
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,440
You in?

360
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,440
Yeah. I'm in.

361
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,600
- Give me the tattoo.
- Yeah.

362
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,600
Now that you're officially one of us,
the corgi was just for a laugh.

363
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,160
We're gonna make the Queen
hand over her precious jewels.

364
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,040
Yeah. Just one question... how?

365
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,080
Leave that part to me.

366
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,720
I'll work my magic.

367
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,200
Another pint?

368
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,760
Yeah, I'd love one.

369
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,920
You should probably have something
in your stomach with this one.

370
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,440
Aren't you kind looking after me?

371
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
I try my best.

372
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,640
Did he tell you he's a dark soul
cursed to walk the world alone?

373
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,600
Something like that.

374
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,120
- I'll be right back.
- Thanks, love.

375
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,360
How the bloody hell did you find me
up here in Liverpool, eh?

376
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,120
Sara had me install
a tracker in your comm.

377
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,760
No one trusts old Johnny Boy.

378
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,200
Can't say I blame you lot.

379
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,480
Yeah, she had a hunch
your baser instincts

380
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,640
would pull you off mission.

381
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,840
Oh, she'd be the one to
bloody know, wouldn't she?

382
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,800
- Here you are, love.
- Thanks.

383
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,000
Just give me a shout
if you want a water.

384
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,600
Will do.

385
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,840
That brooding, anti-hero crap
must be a real panty dropper, huh?

386
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,600
You tell her you have four roommates
and sleep on the couch?

387
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,120
No, I didn't.

388
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,200
She's my mum.

389
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,440
I'm really wishing I had
not said "panty dropper."

390
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,680
Yep.

391
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,520
{\an5}Feels so good to be
back in the field.

392
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,760
Feel that cold Pleistocene
breeze in our hair.

393
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,720
Only thing is I do feel a
little naked

394
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,440
without a clever costume on.

395
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,440
Oh, I'm sort of off of costumes
right now.

396
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,480
Oh, because of your John Cos-play.

397
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,160
What's going on
with you two anyway?

398
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,720
Well, he dropped me,
which sucks.

399
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,880
I mean, you know.

400
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
Why would you say that?

401
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,880
Oh, there's no shame in it.

402
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,640
You know, I just used to think
of you as Amaya's arm candy.

403
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
So, it's nice to know

404
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,120
you're more than just the guy
Amaya dumped.

405
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,880
She didn't dump me...
we broke up to save the timeline.

406
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,680
Yeah, Constantine
let me down easy, too.

407
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,080
Said it was about the balance
of good and evil.

408
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,600
Wait, did she dump me?

409
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,320
Well, all I know is she started
a family with another guy real fast.

410
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,760
You tell me. Oh, but hey, hey,
you get back out there.

411
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,560
Meet some new people.
Change up your scenery a bit.

412
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,360
- Hide.
- Yeah, hide if it heals

413
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,240
- your heart better.
- Shut up. Hide.

414
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,840
- Quitting time.
- No, shut that off.

415
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,480
- You're gonna get us killed.
- If we don't get back to the office,

416
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,600
Director Sharpe is going to kill us.

417
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,640
She hates overtime.

418
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,320
- You're kidding.
- No.

419
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,280
- On three.
- Yes.

420
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,960
- One, two...
- Two...

421
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,080
Three, go.

422
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,320
Gary, go!

423
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,000
It's me, Ray.
Look straight ahead.

424
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,800
Talk straight into your newspaper.
No one will suspect a thing.

425
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
What do you got on them?

426
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,600
Gilly loves monkeys,
Ian's first language was Yiddish,

427
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,520
and Declan,
his nose crinkles when he smiles,

428
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,400
- it's actually pretty cute.
- I don't want to date them, Haircut.

429
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,280
Just tell me which one of them
I'll have to off.

430
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,240
Well, it appears that Charlie
is our mystery... or fugitive.

431
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,600
Good. We'll nab her
and send her to hell.

432
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,560
Hell? What?

433
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,000
Look, all she is guilty
of is questionable hygiene,

434
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,880
playing bad music,
and pulling a couple pranks.

435
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,240
We started this mess.
We got to take care of it.

436
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,320
All right, well,
just give me some time

437
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,640
to figure out what her powers
are before we move on her.

438
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,360
You've got until
the weasel gets back.

439
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,280
What the hell is that
on your arm?

440
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,080
It's my tattoo.

441
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,120
It's a corgi with a mohawk.

442
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,200
You've lost it, Haircut.

443
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
You finally lost it.

444
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,880
It's Rayge, mate.

445
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,240
Were you and your mom close?

446
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,400
Just met her 20 minutes ago.

447
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,320
Died in childbirth.

448
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,280
Two for two. Sorry.

449
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,120
My dad used to call me "Killer."

450
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,720
Never let me forget what I did.

451
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,840
Father of the year.

452
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,160
Wouldn't guess that
to look at him, would you?

453
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,600
You didn't just happen to run
into your parents, did you?

454
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,400
I've ruined a lot of lives,
and that bastard

455
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,960
is just the first one
to call me out on it.

456
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,360
Listen, if want to wallow
in self-pity,

457
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,720
the Waverider has got
a lot of rooms for that.

458
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,320
I'm partial to the kitchen myself.

459
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,920
Oh, I'm not here to wallow, love.

460
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,720
I'm here to fix it.

461
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,920
Give him the old Manchester mangler.

462
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,120
- What?
- Back-alley vasectomy.

463
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,880
Back-alley vas...

464
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,200
No, John, you can't...

465
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,120
Oh, what happened?

466
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,880
Ball kick paradox... you can't
kick your own dad in the junk

467
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,680
because you'd erase yourself
from the timeline,

468
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,840
which means there would be no one
to kick your dad in the junk.

469
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,200
Bloody hell I can't.

470
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,520
Toss off, you legless wanker.

471
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,760
Tommy! Tommy, are you all right?

472
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,360
Get the hell out of my pub.

473
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,640
I never want to see
your face again.

474
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,840
You won't.

475
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,160
Another cracking
Constantine family reunion.

476
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,520
Look, I get it.

477
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,360
There's a lot of things
I wish I could change.

478
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,760
But you can't mess with your past.

479
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,160
Time travel 101.

480
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,360
Oh, it's not just my mum.

481
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,720
There are others I've hurt.

482
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,160
My past...

483
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,920
is coming for me.

484
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,480
What do you mean?

485
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,280
You know what? Forget it.

486
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,560
Ray will be needing us now, won't he?

487
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,720
Hello, punk friends.
Anyone seen Charlie?

488
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,480
- We know what you've been up to.
- You do?

489
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,560
Of course you do,
I'm a terrible liar.

490
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,800
Shut it, Rayge.

491
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,440
If that is your real name.
Which I'm pretty sure it's not.

492
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,240
You said you left New York
to escape the disco scene.

493
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,680
Then explain this?

494
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,240
Mamma Mia.

495
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,600
"Mystery disco band leaves
the audience saying,

496
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,160
'Thank you for the music.'"

497
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,480
Can you even name a punk song?

498
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,840
Well... I...

499
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,040
I told you idiots
we couldn't trust him.

500
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,000
- He's a narc.
- Yeah. Disco narc.

501
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,160
Look, can we just
talk about this calmly?

502
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,240
Calmly?

503
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,440
Is this Rayge chap
ever gonna have a rage or not?

504
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,640
I think we should glue
sequins all over him

505
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,640
and string him up like a disco ball
at the Roxy.

506
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,160
Shut it!

507
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,680
Listen to yourselves.

508
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,200
You lot sound like brainwashed pigs.

509
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,640
So what, the bloke
fancies a bit of disco?

510
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,200
Gilly used to be a nun.
Ian was a mime.

511
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,520
I've done a stint in the lockup.

512
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,200
Declan's not even Irish.

513
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,480
I thought it sounded more street.

514
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,040
We've all got a past.
And it is just that... a past.

515
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,960
I don't care who you were before.

516
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,600
Whoever you want to be now,
that's what matters.

517
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,400
Did you put butter in the coffee
machine again, Gary?

518
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,640
- Yes.
- Hey, Ava.

519
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,200
Oh, hey. Happy Tuesday.

520
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,320
How was your evening?

521
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,600
Actually, it was nice.
What about you?

522
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,960
You ready to get back out there?

523
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,560
Gary told me you guys wrapped up
yesterday's mission without a hitch.

524
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,520
I am very impressed.
I look forward to reading the report.

525
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Good job.

526
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,400
We wrapped it up?

527
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,560
It wrapped itself up.
The blip is gone.

528
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,760
What do you mean it's gone?

529
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,120
Don't overthink it, Nate.
Take the win.

530
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,280
Oh, I got you something
to commemorate

531
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,720
our first mission together
as time bros.

532
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,560
It's an exotic plant to spruce up
your work space.

533
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,160
Looks good.

534
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,880
Mixtape.
If you're gonna be in the band,

535
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,000
you should be able to
at least name one punk song.

536
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,920
Cool. Thank you.

537
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,560
And thank you for earlier.

538
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,240
Oh, sometimes the others think
they're the damn punk police.

539
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,200
I have to tell you something.

540
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,120
My name is not really Rayge.

541
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,080
In fact, it's nothing anger-related.

542
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,680
It's just Ray.

543
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,480
- Just Ray?
- Yeah.

544
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,600
I like that.

545
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,840
So, Just Ray,
what happened to your old crew?

546
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,440
Well, Sara met a special someone,
and they're trying to make it work.

547
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,560
Oh, that will kill a band.

548
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,240
My best friend,
Nate, he has a desk job.

549
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,800
And Amaya, well, she's gone.

550
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,320
I actually really miss her.

551
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,080
She was kind of our moral compass.

552
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,520
Helped us do the right thing

553
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,560
when it wasn't always easy
to do the right thing.

554
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,240
I never knew disco
could get so barmy.

555
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,000
Well, I guess the way we did it,
yeah, it did get pretty barmy.

556
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,120
So,... how long were you locked up?

557
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,160
Long enough to know
I ain't ever going back.

558
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,520
What happened?

559
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,720
Small-minded people got scared.

560
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,680
Turned to law and order
to make themselves feel big.

561
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,920
Prison seems extreme
for a little bit of mischief.

562
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,040
I wasn't sent away
for stealing corgis.

563
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,680
You sure you can handle
the truth, Just Ray"?

564
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,040
Yeah, try me.

565
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,280
Whoa.

566
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,240
- This doesn't freak you out?
- No.

567
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,680
Such rapid molecular
transformation is...

568
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,920
to quote an old friend-stonishing.

569
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,400
How do you choose who to be
when you can be anybody?

570
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,320
Just saw this mug on a toothpaste ad
on the tube.

571
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,800
I liked her smile.

572
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,560
Wow. Must be strange
to completely change.

573
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,640
It is. That's why I have to
hold tight to what I believe...

574
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,560
strong drinks, loud music,
and screwing the system.

575
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,680
Otherwise, I'd lose myself.

576
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,080
You're a pretty cool lady...

577
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,280
or man...
or whatever you want to be.

578
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,640
I wish the humans who threw
me in the slammer felt that way.

579
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,040
They just saw a magical
creature and panicked.

580
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm so sorry.

581
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,680
Oh, don't be.

582
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,760
You're one of the good ones,
Just Ray.

583
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,440
Sara, I figured it out.

584
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,320
All right, Ray.
What are we dealing with?

585
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,800
<i>She's a shapeshifter.</i>

586
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,400
<i>She doesn't kidnap the Queen.
She becomes the Queen.</i>

587
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,760
- I knew it.
- You definitely said leprechaun.

588
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,400
<i>So, I have an idea.</i>

589
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,040
What if I just ask her to stop
impersonating the Queen?

590
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,720
History goes back to the way it was,

591
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,320
and we don't have to send her
to hell.

592
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,880
Ray, so far we've learned
that unicorns

593
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,200
are homicidal maniacs

594
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,280
and fairy godmothers
are psychopaths.

595
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,120
And they're supposed
to be the nice ones.

596
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,480
And these shapeshifting bastards
they put the rest to shame.

597
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,360
<i>We're talking killing sprees,
world wars, you name it.</i>

598
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,760
Yeah, but she's not doing
any of that.

599
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,440
She's manipulating you.
Don't fall for it, mate.

600
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,840
Too late. He's got a tattoo.

601
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,560
Oh, please let it be a tramp stamp.

602
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,720
She's not hurting anyone.

603
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,200
Sit tight, Haircut.
We'll work this out.

604
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,360
<i>Thank you, Mick. Maybe we could...</i>

605
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,520
- He's in too deep.
- For once I agree with you.

606
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,440
Ray has no bloody idea
what he's dealing with.

607
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,040
Ray has been doing this a long time.
He can handle himself.

608
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,720
Sara, if this thing gets loose,
there is no stopping it.

609
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,960
Trust me.

610
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,520
Zari, what do you think?
Has the shapeshifter gotten to Ray?

611
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,840
Yeah.

612
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,280
All right, then,
squad save the Queen.

613
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,200
That's not the plan.

614
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,680
Do you trust me?

615
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,320
Of course. You're my friend.

616
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,160
- We got to go.
- What? Why?

617
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,840
Because my friends don't trust me.

618
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,800
Ray? We just want to talk.

619
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,520
So, your disco mates think
I'll come quietly.

620
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,800
Who are you really?

621
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,880
Look, Declan was right.
I am a narc.

622
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,200
I'm a magic narc.

623
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,240
I was sent here to capture
you and take you in, but...

624
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,200
You ain't sending me back to prison.

625
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,440
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Haircut!

626
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,440
Then what are you gonna do?

627
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,920
You told me that you wanted
to shock people and wake them up.

628
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,880
Well, that's what I'm gonna do
to my own team.

629
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,840
You asked me who I really am?

630
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,680
I'm a punk.

631
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,760
- Come on, Ray, open the door.
- Or we burn it down.

632
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,880
<i>Lunch is here. Yes.</i>

633
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,600
Hey, I have an idea for you guys.

634
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,000
- Who guys?
- You guys. The Time Bureau.

635
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,240
Sorry, that was supposed
to be top secret.

636
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,600
Oh, no worries,
because I was thinking,

637
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,360
you know how time zones
go up and down?

638
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,880
Well, what about sideways?

639
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,760
Sideways time zones.
Huh? Like across?

640
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,720
So you wouldn't have to change
your clock when took...

641
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,040
A solo road trip across America!

642
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,280
- That's genius.
- Thanks!

643
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,400
- What is happening?
- Sorry I have to do this.

644
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,720
And have a nice day.

645
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,720
Okay, you got a sandwich.

646
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,600
I got a sandwich.

647
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,920
Pro tip... Bureau pays for lunch
so make sure you eat enough

648
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,800
so you're not hungry again
until tomorrow.

649
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,760
You really do know
all the boring tricks.

650
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,520
I can see you're in a funk.
Is this still about Amaya?

651
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,200
Lay it on the Gar-Bear.
It's okay to cry.

652
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,280
In fact...

653
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,120
it's encouraged.

654
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,560
Gary, where did you get that plant?

655
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,000
It's from our first mission together.

656
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,240
I wanted it to have
a special meaning for us.

657
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Gary?

658
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,480
Gary, it's magical.

659
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,280
It is?

660
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,200
Gary, stapler.

661
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,600
Today we ride! Hyah!

662
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,960
Well, no sign of Ray
or the creature, Captain.

663
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,680
Sara? Sara?

664
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,640
Maybe you should have
put a tracker in her comm.

665
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,520
What the hell, Ray?

666
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,360
All right, come on.

667
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,080
Sara, Charlie decked me.

668
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,200
Oh, no.

669
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,680
No.

670
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,000
Sara? Sara?

671
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Mick.

672
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,160
Oh, no.

673
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,640
Stop.

674
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,320
Don't hurt my friends.

675
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,000
Your friends are drones.

676
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,600
No, they're better than that.

677
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,320
I'm not taking the chance.

678
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,040
No way I'm going back to prison.

679
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,840
Atom suit... disassemble.

680
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,320
<i>Dr. Palmer voice authenticated.</i>

681
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,840
- Guess you're a drone, too.
- That's enough. Zari.

682
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,520
Great. Now let's send
this beast to hell.

683
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,840
- Wait.
- Hell? What the hell?

684
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,360
Guys, come on, look...

685
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,760
let's think about this, all right?

686
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,360
She is not evil.

687
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,280
She stole your suit
and tried to kill us, Ray.

688
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,880
That's the ballsiest thing
you've ever done, Haircut.

689
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,760
She's only doing what any one
of you would have done

690
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,080
- if you were cornered.
- We let her out, this is on us.

691
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,320
The portal is open, now send
the monster through.

692
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,240
I'll show you what
a real monster looks like.

693
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,280
Like this.

694
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,960
Like someone who'd
rather do what's easy...

695
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,480
than figure out what's right.

696
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,520
Someone who'd send
an innocent to hell.

697
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,760
Don't fall for its bloody
parlor tricks.

698
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,200
Ray said your team's
moral compass is missing.

699
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,320
Can you send her to hell?

700
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
Zari, you're too smart to
fall for this bloody creature.

701
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,960
Now send it through.
I can't keep the portal open forever.

702
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,760
No, I can't do it.

703
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,000
All right, we're gonna
figure this out on the ship.

704
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,600
Fine. But I'm not letting
a shapeshifter on the bloody ship.

705
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,720
What did you do to me, you ass?

706
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,960
It's a lobotomy of sorts.

707
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,520
Your shapeshifting days
are over, sweetheart.

708
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,160
No!

709
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,280
Come on, you cowards!

710
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,600
<i>Bring it on. Come on down here.</i>

711
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,560
We can't just leave
her locked in there forever.

712
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,000
You are on thin ice in terms
of what we can and cannot do.

713
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Those punks were
a bad influence on you.

714
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,360
Oh, well, maybe you just
don't know as much about me

715
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,640
as you think you do.

716
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,120
You were an Eagle Scout,
former CEO of Palmer Tech.

717
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,880
Your favorite musical is
"Singing in the Rain."

718
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,880
You're allergic to cats and Grodd,

719
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,800
and you were knighted
by Queen Guinevere

720
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,360
Sir Raymond of the Palms.

721
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,640
- Okay, so you know a lot.
- Yeah.

722
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,920
But you don't know that I was the man

723
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,040
who helped Nora Dark
escape the Time Bureau.

724
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,080
You what?

725
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,480
She's not going to sleep with you,
Haircut.

726
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,400
That is not why I did it.

727
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,360
I just believe
she can be a better person.

728
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,880
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe she's
a terrible, horrible monster.

729
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,600
But I believe she should be
given the chance to find out.

730
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,520
Everyone else on this ship
has been given a second chance.

731
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,680
Why doesn't she get one?

732
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,520
Look, you better
not be wrong about her.

733
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,560
But right now we need to deal
with our current captive.

734
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,240
She cannot stay on the ship.

735
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,960
Yeah, especially now
with Amaya's face.

736
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,520
It's frickin' creepy.

737
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,320
You broke her, you fix her, weasel.

738
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,760
Make her not Amaya again.

739
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,480
Spell doesn't work like that, Womble.

740
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,680
I took away her power to transform.
It's like clipping an angel's wings.

741
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,480
You can't exactly unclip them.

742
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,640
That was one surprisingly
strong little plant.

743
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,920
Surprisingly full of goo.

744
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,520
I like what you've done
with the place.

745
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,320
Sort of a little
office of horrors theme.

746
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,000
Nate showed the plant
who's boss, Captain Lance.

747
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,400
- Oh, yeah?
- Although the plant

748
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,920
- did get in a lot of punches.
- Okay, Gar-Gar.

749
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,320
All right, let's leave a little
something to the imagination.

750
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,840
Speaking of, you should probably
change your shirt

751
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,920
before Ava gets back.

752
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,400
I can see where your nipple was.

753
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,560
And the handshake.

754
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,280
You already found a new time bro.

755
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,640
He's growing on me.

756
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,480
Okay, but really, when are
you coming back to the ship?

757
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,560
There's a situation that I could
really use your input on.

758
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,520
When I took this job
at the Time Bureau,

759
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,840
I thought I was doing it for my dad
or even maybe a little bit for Ava.

760
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,720
But, the truth is, I was
trying to avoid the Waverider.

761
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,720
- Why?
- Because every room

762
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,520
I went into on that ship,
I was hoping she'd be there.

763
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,040
- Amaya.
- Yeah.

764
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,960
But I'm over it.

765
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,000
Amaya is no longer
on the Waverider.

766
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,080
That's it.

767
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,320
I'm sorry, you wanted to talk
about something?

768
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,880
No, it can... it'll wait.

769
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,560
Maybe a little Bureau time
is exactly what you need.

770
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,560
So, I think you should stay here,

771
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,680
because I like to watch you grow.

772
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,880
- Thank you, Sara.
- Yeah.

773
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,080
Hi.

774
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,640
Wow.

775
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,680
So, enough chitchat. Dinner? Drinks?

776
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,920
Should we just get straight to it?

777
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,760
Whoa, whoa, what did I say
about professional boundaries.

778
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,920
Sorry.

779
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,280
I mean, look at this place.

780
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,400
Can you please tell me,

781
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,440
how do you keep five Legends
on a leash at once?

782
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
Very loosely,

783
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,800
because sometimes we pull you
in the right direction.

784
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,280
Hey, you got a minute?

785
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,360
I just wanted to say-bout the pub...

786
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

787
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,760
Listen, if you're here to have
some weepy, heart-to-heart,

788
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,440
end-of-the-mission hug fest
where you tell me

789
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,840
that my problems are your problems

790
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,960
and that happiness
is just one friend away

791
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,400
and all that bollocks,
don't bother, yeah?

792
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,520
Hey, you don't know me.

793
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,560
I wouldn't do that.
That would be lame.

794
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,560
Yeah, it would.

795
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,640
So, why are you here?

796
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,000
I wanted to give you this
surveillance photo

797
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,320
I took of you and your mom.

798
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,400
Thank you...

799
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,160
you know, for not doing
any of that stuff.

800
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,920
Yeah. Anytime.

801
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,640
I hate cops.

802
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,520
I am well aware of that, Mick.

803
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,960
Well, today we nearly became cops.

804
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,040
Yeah, but we didn't.

805
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,120
No. Thanks to you, Rayge.

806
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,960
- Thanks, Mick.
- All right, are you two plonkers

807
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,880
just gonna stand there
and stare at me,

808
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,200
or is one of you gonna
poor me a bloody pint?

809
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,280
She definitely isn't Amaya.

810
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,080
No. But I do like her.
