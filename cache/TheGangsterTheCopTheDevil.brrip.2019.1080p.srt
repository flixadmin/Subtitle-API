1
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:48,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously?</font>

2
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't it common sense
to drive slowly at night?</font>

3
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's quite a dent.</font>

4
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:57,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

5
00:02:57,792 --> 00:02:59,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, and you?
- I'm fine.</font>

6
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:01,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did you drive so fast
at night?</font>

7
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How are the photos?
- Sorry?</font>

8
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's really no need for that.</font>

9
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:10,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?</font>

10
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Photos are crucial
when claiming insurance.</font>

11
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had better not
change your story.</font>

12
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:16,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's scratched...</font>

13
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:16,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Another murder took place
in a land development site</font>

14
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:18,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">near Cheonan early this morning.</font>

15
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:21,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since last year, many murders
and missing person cases</font>

16
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:25,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have been reported all around
the South Chungcheong province,</font>

17
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:28,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the police
are yet to close the cases...</font>

18
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We want to close them too,
you know.</font>

19
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:32,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We want to close cases,</font>

20
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">go on vacations,
and get promoted.</font>

21
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:42,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turn off the siren!</font>

22
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one in this town
gives a damn.</font>

23
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:50,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They just couldn't care less.</font>

24
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What a filthy world...
- Tell me about it.</font>

25
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gosh, look at those thugs.</font>

26
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trash like them should just die.</font>

27
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:05,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you going?
We're on a case!</font>

28
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:07,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever. Does it look like
we're on a case?</font>

29
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tae-seok!
- See you at the scene!</font>

30
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Can't you even do that?
- I'm sorry.</font>

31
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:13,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously.</font>

32
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:15,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please be on your way.
Please go.</font>

33
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:17,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Be on your way. I'm a cop.
- Sir.</font>

34
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you
to stay out of my sight.</font>

35
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:22,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Block the entrance.</font>

36
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Step aside.</font>

37
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:27,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To what do we owe the pleasure
on this hot day?</font>

38
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does a cop need permission
from thugs to be here?</font>

39
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:33,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir.</font>

40
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:34,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, sir!</font>

41
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:38,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come back another time.
Today's a bad day.</font>

42
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:41,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It must be one of those days.</font>

43
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The roads were jammed
but things aren't better here.</font>

44
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:47,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, fine.</font>

45
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:53,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here. Now please go away.</font>

46
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:01,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You bastard. What do you take
Korean cops for?</font>

47
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:04,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How dare you try to bribe me?</font>

48
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gameland</font>

49
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">here you go, fucking jerks.</font>

50
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys should've
been more careful.</font>

51
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:19,247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How dare gangsters
try to block a cop's way?</font>

52
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please continue.</font>

53
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope you win!</font>

54
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:53,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boss.</font>

55
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That fucking cop's here.</font>

56
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:04,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put it down.</font>

57
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wrap him up and send him back.
- Yes, boss.</font>

58
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I received 200,000 won
in gift certificates.</font>

59
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our share is 10 percent,</font>

60
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:28,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so your total is 180,000 won.</font>

61
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:31,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the fuck...</font>

62
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:33,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Open it.</font>

63
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Salute.</font>

64
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:39,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever.</font>

65
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:45,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're charged with illegal
conversion of gift certificates.</font>

66
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:47,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remain silent</font>

67
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or retain a lawyer if you want.</font>

68
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:51,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're coming with me.</font>

69
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:55,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Detective, why don't
you come in for a second?</font>

70
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buddy, come out here.</font>

71
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't forget to put those on.</font>

72
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good morning, boss!
- Good morning, boss!</font>

73
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:20,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, it's me.</font>

74
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That bastard's back again.</font>

75
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:24,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

76
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:28,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I sent him to a crime scene.
What's he doing there?</font>

77
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ask the fucker yourself.</font>

78
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell Sang-do I'm heading there.</font>

79
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't do this, not when you
receive our monthly fee.</font>

80
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:42,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Taking all the money
for yourself</font>

81
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has caused your boys
to disrupt my business.</font>

82
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:49,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I already advised you against
gift certificate conversion.</font>

83
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Start a currency exchange shop
under someone else's name,</font>

84
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or share the stakes. You know
what I'm talking about.</font>

85
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All that for some chump change?</font>

86
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm busy as it is
setting up new operations.</font>

87
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:03,290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't you cut him off
before he comes over?</font>

88
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My boys need the money.</font>

89
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, fine.
I'll take care of the bastard.</font>

90
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

91
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:21,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you kidding me?</font>

92
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:23,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm your superior, you know.
Where are you?</font>

93
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On my way to the crime scene.
I'm hanging up.</font>

94
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I really don't like this guy.</font>

95
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me just turn off...</font>

96
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The electric fan.
- Keep walking.</font>

97
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop right there.</font>

98
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you wish.</font>

99
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thanks for the ride.
- Thank you.</font>

100
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously? Is this necessary?</font>

101
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gave you a ride!</font>

102
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's my payment.</font>

103
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:04,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, kneel on the ground!</font>

104
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:07,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to report you.</font>

105
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:09,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bloody traffic jam.</font>

106
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where the heck have you been?</font>

107
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gosh, there's a crowd already.</font>

108
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:16,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get rid of them.</font>

109
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, reporters.
One moment, please!</font>

110
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can take photos later.
Can you all move back for now?</font>

111
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Secure the scene properly!
What have you been doing?</font>

112
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, move aside!</font>

113
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay back if you were late.</font>

114
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:37,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't head toward the bridge
and stay close.</font>

115
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:41,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just received a call
requesting for backup.</font>

116
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:56,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move back, please.</font>

117
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People are gathering over there!</font>

118
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gaining an audience!</font>

119
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good day, officer.</font>

120
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you identify the victim?</font>

121
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:08,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're checking his vehicle
number, so we'll find out soon.</font>

122
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He died only a few hours ago</font>

123
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:21,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">between 3 and 5
this morning.</font>

124
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:24,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cause of death is blood loss
due to stabbing</font>

125
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or a heart attack.</font>

126
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my initial impression.</font>

127
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:30,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, come and take some photos.</font>

128
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,455
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you get it?</font>

129
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:46,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make sure
you don't miss anything.</font>

130
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:49,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Seo-Jin. Over here!</font>

131
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you take a look at this?</font>

132
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:54,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you not to call me
by name at crime scenes.</font>

133
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My apologies, Chief Cha.
Anyway, please take a look.</font>

134
00:11:58,042 --> 00:11:59,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

135
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:02,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like rear-end collision,
right?</font>

136
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,583
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It does seem that way,
but then again, it doesn't.</font>

137
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:10,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Could this be the motive?</font>

138
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:13,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish it was. It's better
than premeditated murder.</font>

139
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:35,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way, I should thank you</font>

140
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:38,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for turning one of my boys
into a cripple.</font>

141
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are rules for a reason,
you know.</font>

142
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:44,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever.</font>

143
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:48,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So businesses will be separate
but we'll share engineers.</font>

144
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it.</font>

145
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:54,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shouldn't we resolve
the turf issue though?</font>

146
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's be flexible about this.</font>

147
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sang-do.
- Yes?</font>

148
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:08,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you keep getting favors,
you'll end up getting spoiled.</font>

149
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:14,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't make trouble, and manage
the shop I assigned you.</font>

150
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone has his limit.</font>

151
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:19,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you cross the line,
you'll die.</font>

152
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, do you really think so?</font>

153
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guus Hiddink once said this.</font>

154
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I'm still fucking hungry."</font>

155
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have no capital,
no connections,</font>

156
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:38,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I'm still hungry.</font>

157
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:42,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir.</font>

158
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:47,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My boss is being lenient
because you two are friends.</font>

159
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:51,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why he's giving you
the technology and engineers.</font>

160
00:13:51,792 --> 00:13:53,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The slot arcade business</font>

161
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:58,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is nothing like fighting
over these bars and clubs!</font>

162
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you raising your voice
in front of our bosses?</font>

163
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:03,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give us what?
Just shut up, asshole!</font>

164
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have a death wish?</font>

165
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut the fuck up!</font>

166
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this how you train your boys?</font>

167
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at him glaring at me.</font>

168
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Dong-s...</font>

169
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:19,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you
acting so high and mighty</font>

170
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:20,767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when all you give me
are only the crumbs?</font>

171
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This type of transaction
won't keep the peace.</font>

172
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here.</font>

173
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, boss.</font>

174
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:46,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shouldn't
interrupt our conversation.</font>

175
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here.</font>

176
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You little fucker.</font>

177
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There. Now we can work in peace.</font>

178
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:15,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drink up.</font>

179
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:23,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's good.</font>

180
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cheonan police station</font>

181
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:31,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Choe Jeong-gyu, 46 years old.</font>

182
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:34,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No enemies, debts, lawsuits
or anything like that.</font>

183
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The autopsy report was obvious.</font>

184
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:37,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He has over a dozen stab wounds.</font>

185
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The murderer is obviously
an amateur.</font>

186
00:15:39,292 --> 00:15:40,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He just went nuts.</font>

187
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:43,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't feel comfortable
calling the culprit an amateur.</font>

188
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:45,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No evidence was left behind.</font>

189
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:48,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No footprints, blood, hairs,
fingerprints, nothing.</font>

190
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:52,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since the wallet's gone,
it could be a robbery.</font>

191
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">However, the amount
is too small so...</font>

192
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:56,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People kill others
for the littlest things.</font>

193
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The meeting's over.
Get the captain of unit one.</font>

194
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:00,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

195
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:06,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here, sir.</font>

196
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This case is likely
a robbery-homicide,</font>

197
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so look for anyone
with similar criminal records.</font>

198
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir.</font>

199
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:18,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys, back up unit one.</font>

200
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:21,607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Three separate cases,
but one killer.</font>

201
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What cases?</font>

202
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:24,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen.</font>

203
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A reservoir in seosan
on July 15,</font>

204
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:32,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boryeong Sunbeach Motel
on July 23,</font>

205
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then last night's case.</font>

206
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:38,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A knife was the murder weapon
in all three cases.</font>

207
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Considering the length
and width of the knife,</font>

208
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it could be the same.</font>

209
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'm certain it is.</font>

210
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The suspect is a serial killer.</font>

211
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't the USA, you know.</font>

212
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gun possession is illegal,
so knives are the most common.</font>

213
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:55,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's nonsense.</font>

214
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are over
1,000 murders a year.</font>

215
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Going by your logic, half
of them is done by one guy.</font>

216
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you nuts?</font>

217
00:17:03,417 --> 00:17:06,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you to mess with
another jurisdiction's cases?</font>

218
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does the killer care
about jurisdiction?</font>

219
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:13,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we don't catch him soon,
we'll be in big trouble.</font>

220
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's too meticulous
for this to be a random killing.</font>

221
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He could strike again
at any time...</font>

222
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This job is too easy for you,
isn't it?</font>

223
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:21,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Murder cases aren't a joke.</font>

224
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't just
jump to conclusions like that!</font>

225
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not...</font>

226
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These aren't random cases
I'm tying together.</font>

227
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:30,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They each happened
about a week apart</font>

228
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all around
South Chungcheong province.</font>

229
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:36,068
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No matter how much we think
about it, we're getting nowhere.</font>

230
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,215
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then the conclusion's pretty
obvious, isn't it?</font>

231
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:41,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Screw your nonsense.</font>

232
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you so clever that you
decided to raid an arcade</font>

233
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:46,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on your way to a crime scene?</font>

234
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:48,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you have the time do that?</font>

235
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't they criminals too?</font>

236
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:55,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gangsters and killers
are the same shit.</font>

237
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeong Tae-seok, what's wrong
with you?</font>

238
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:00,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

239
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you that desperate
to get promoted?</font>

240
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gosh...</font>

241
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, that's what I'm after.</font>

242
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's why I want
to catch the killer.</font>

243
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The meeting's over, so move it.
Let's get that killer.</font>

244
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:32,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't drink, so I'll drive.</font>

245
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, boss...</font>

246
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take the boys and head back.</font>

247
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, boss.</font>

248
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:51,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's correct, Chairman.</font>

249
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sang-do may be a bit rash,
but he's a smart man.</font>

250
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:57,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He won't make trouble anymore.</font>

251
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, don't worry.</font>

252
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a good night.</font>

253
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

254
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:40,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The road was slippery.</font>

255
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks fine. You can just go.</font>

256
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:53,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry?</font>

257
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I still hit your car.</font>

258
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fine. You can go.</font>

259
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure about that?</font>

260
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, it's fine.</font>

261
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a bitch!</font>

262
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:29,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it!</font>

263
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:32,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>

264
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

265
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:04,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come back here!</font>

266
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:48,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're all dead!</font>

267
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You assholes!</font>

268
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's there?</font>

269
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:19,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sang-do didn't send him.</font>

270
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't recognize the attacker.</font>

271
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:24,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was Sang-do, boss.</font>

272
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:27,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not a member of a gang.</font>

273
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:30,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His attack felt purposeless
and empathetic.</font>

274
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It felt different.</font>

275
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who else would try to attack you</font>

276
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:36,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in our line of work?</font>

277
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:37,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that.</font>

278
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was too dark
to see properly but...</font>

279
00:24:44,292 --> 00:24:45,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">White sedan, Daejeon 23XX</font>

280
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- get out!
- Locate the vehicle.</font>

281
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you to be careful,
didn't I?</font>

282
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're actually friends.</font>

283
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gosh, sorry to bother you.</font>

284
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The patient looks
damn comfy to me.</font>

285
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are you?</font>

286
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I brought a box of red bulls.</font>

287
00:25:02,917 --> 00:25:05,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, I heard
you were stabbed recently.</font>

288
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:08,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The hospital
reported it to the police.</font>

289
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:11,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you must be
quite embarrassed</font>

290
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:14,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to have been attacked like that.
You're a thug, after all.</font>

291
00:25:16,208 --> 00:25:18,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not as embarrassing
as being a cop.</font>

292
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cops are so incompetent</font>

293
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:24,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that bad things keep happening
to model citizens.</font>

294
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unbelievable.</font>

295
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, model citizen,
Jang Dong-su,</font>

296
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:36,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">tell me everything
about last night.</font>

297
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll catch him for you.</font>

298
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:41,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can probably catch him faster.</font>

299
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

300
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeez. Do you want to bet?</font>

301
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:49,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spill it, asshole.</font>

302
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like I said,
I'll catch him for you.</font>

303
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:56,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine. Do you mind?</font>

304
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:06,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tripped last night
and hurt myself.</font>

305
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, okay.</font>

306
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:18,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should really
watch your step.</font>

307
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:23,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unlucky bastards can trip
and fall on multiple knives.</font>

308
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jang's car is a black Mercedes
with the number 3849, right?</font>

309
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:21,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it, I'll hang up.</font>

310
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:30,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a bitch.</font>

311
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:34,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A rear-end collision.</font>

312
00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:37,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">White sedan.</font>

313
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:41,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was right, shithead.</font>

314
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wish you a fast recovery,
hur sang-do</font>

315
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:54,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeez, look at you.</font>

316
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you okay?</font>

317
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:58,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Have a seat.
- I'm fine.</font>

318
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:02,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel so bad that
I can barely look at you.</font>

319
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:08,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What will happen now?</font>

320
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:12,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You made a mess right after
we signed the contract.</font>

321
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:14,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would you like me to do?</font>

322
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:19,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot of my boys
are cripples now.</font>

323
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:22,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pay hospital bills
and some compensation.</font>

324
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And hand over the main store
and also the one in Seongan.</font>

325
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:30,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll make sure your boys
are well compensated.</font>

326
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:33,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the shops?</font>

327
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was this your plan all along?</font>

328
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:43,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dong-su.</font>

329
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:47,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I gave the order,</font>

330
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:51,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you wouldn't be alive.</font>

331
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, think about it.</font>

332
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm curious too, you know.</font>

333
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:01,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who would mess you up like this?</font>

334
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:04,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you then.</font>

335
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:06,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So fucking embarrassing!</font>

336
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:10,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A gangster getting stabbed?
I'd just kill myself!</font>

337
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:16,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me and give me
two men on this case.</font>

338
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll catch that guy in one go.</font>

339
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you just
go on a vacation?</font>

340
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:24,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I barely have enough men
to run this department,</font>

341
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:27,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so why are you offering
to take someone else's problem?</font>

342
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:30,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chief, it's a huge case.</font>

343
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:32,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you close one,
others will get solved as well.</font>

344
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:34,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will be a long train
of solved cases.</font>

345
00:29:35,375 --> 00:29:36,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Piss off!</font>

346
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:44,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We finally have a victim
who survived the attack.</font>

347
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:47,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did a witness come forward?</font>

348
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:57,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jang Dong-s...</font>

349
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:00,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Jang Dong-su?</font>

350
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:03,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was stabbed a few days ago.</font>

351
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:07,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A 2-hour surgery
barely kept him alive and...</font>

352
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen to yourself.</font>

353
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:10,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just think about it
for a second.</font>

354
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of psychotic idiot
would attack a gang leader?</font>

355
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The killer's not involved
with gangs.</font>

356
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:20,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure of it.
It's the serial killer!</font>

357
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:21,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut it!</font>

358
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:26,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a gang problem,
I'll assign it to unit 2.</font>

359
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:31,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm warning you.
Don't get involved.</font>

360
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:33,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, get out.</font>

361
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go easy on covering for him.</font>

362
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:39,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't the time for that.</font>

363
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you say?</font>

364
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:44,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's what you've been doing.</font>

365
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:46,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You son of a bitch!</font>

366
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's say you're right.</font>

367
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:56,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But Jang is the victim here.</font>

368
00:30:57,042 --> 00:30:58,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't arrest a witness</font>

369
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:00,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for not reporting a crime.</font>

370
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:02,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many crimes
has he committed?</font>

371
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:07,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to bring him in
and have him questioned.</font>

372
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's pissed off
to say the least.</font>

373
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:12,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we don't do anything,
he'll kill the killer.</font>

374
00:31:12,792 --> 00:31:14,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That'll leave us
with 3 unsolved cases.</font>

375
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can Jang find the killer?</font>

376
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a gangster, not a cop.</font>

377
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:22,371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His men have the resources
to find someone in days.</font>

378
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:23,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also, Jang saw...</font>

379
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The killer's face.</font>

380
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:37,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out.</font>

381
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:41,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're spewing
a lot of nonsense.</font>

382
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:42,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get out!
- Jeez.</font>

383
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:59,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you talk
to the landlord?</font>

384
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeez!</font>

385
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:04,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What am I supposed to do?</font>

386
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:06,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to work
in order to earn money!</font>

387
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Birthday?</font>

388
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:15,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is that important right now?</font>

389
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm tired as hell!</font>

390
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't slept in 2 days,</font>

391
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so don't nag me
about a kid's birthday!</font>

392
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:23,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It must be your kid's birthday.</font>

393
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:26,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

394
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:30,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That goddamn kid you mentioned.</font>

395
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:42,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that.</font>

396
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:49,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sharp face,</font>

397
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:53,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">thin cheeks, an angled chin,</font>

398
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a narrow and long nose.</font>

399
00:33:01,917 --> 00:33:04,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His lips are big
compared to his nose.</font>

400
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:12,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's pretty close.</font>

401
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then you shouldn't
have had the kid.</font>

402
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:26,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not the kid's fault.</font>

403
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:33,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find him before the cops.</font>

404
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand, boss.</font>

405
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:17,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, where are we?</font>

406
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. Who are you?</font>

407
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:00,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Block the door!</font>

408
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:01,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let them come out!</font>

409
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you for your cooperation.</font>

410
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:12,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're cracking down
on illegal slot arcades.</font>

411
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:15,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All gamblers should stay put.</font>

412
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:17,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So where's the boss?</font>

413
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get him down here!</font>

414
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah? Hold on.</font>

415
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:34,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, go ahead.</font>

416
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jang Dong-su,
that adorable piece of shit.</font>

417
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:39,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a scheming bastard.</font>

418
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:42,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He meddled with 63 out
of 97 slot machines.</font>

419
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:44,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Should I get a warrant today?
- Hold on,</font>

420
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:46,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">let me ask him.</font>

421
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:50,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, should I request a warrant?</font>

422
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:52,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want?</font>

423
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:54,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The one who stabbed you.</font>

424
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:57,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me everything,
and I'll let this one slide.</font>

425
00:35:59,542 --> 00:36:00,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if I don't?</font>

426
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:05,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since you have my boss
on your side,</font>

427
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:07,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm no use to you, is that it?</font>

428
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, Jang Dong-s...</font>

429
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:12,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The guy who stabbed you</font>

430
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a serial killer.</font>

431
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:19,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a bit strange though.</font>

432
00:36:20,542 --> 00:36:22,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's different
from other psychos.</font>

433
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're the proof.</font>

434
00:36:27,292 --> 00:36:28,692
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell
are you talking about?</font>

435
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:32,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you think
he messed with you?</font>

436
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:43,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Most psychopaths go after girls</font>

437
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:45,809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or people who are weaker
and smaller than they are.</font>

438
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:47,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the killer
attacks just about anyone.</font>

439
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:51,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we don't find him soon,
more people will die.</font>

440
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell's your problem?</font>

441
00:36:56,542 --> 00:36:59,500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hand over the information
and do your gangster stuff.</font>

442
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:01,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a win-win.</font>

443
00:37:01,458 --> 00:37:03,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll catch him,
put him on trial,</font>

444
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and lock him up for good.</font>

445
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:09,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then what?</font>

446
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:12,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing. That's how it ends.</font>

447
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:15,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it?</font>

448
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:21,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When the country's biggest
luxury casino is built</font>

449
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the penthouse
of this skyscraper,</font>

450
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this entire area
surrounding our Zeus building</font>

451
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:29,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will become the hottest spot
in town...</font>

452
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:33,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut the crap. I heard
this place's ruined.</font>

453
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:34,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it.</font>

454
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:39,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone who lined up</font>

455
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:41,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for pre-construction units
have left.</font>

456
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:45,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Naturally, investors
are delaying their funding.</font>

457
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:50,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weird rumors have been flying
since your accident.</font>

458
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:54,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Cheongju region
is another problem too.</font>

459
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:57,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sang-do's boys are moving
into our turf.</font>

460
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:00,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about the punk
who stabbed me?</font>

461
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:03,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We found his car</font>

462
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the Sintanjin-Bound
national highway.</font>

463
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:06,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His car?</font>

464
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:09,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was parked at a rest area
for a few days.</font>

465
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The boys found it.</font>

466
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:14,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where is the car now?
- We brought it back.</font>

467
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:17,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, there was a murder
a few days ago in that area.</font>

468
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:22,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this. I don't know
if it was dumped or lost,</font>

469
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:26,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the boys found it
about 3 km away from the car.</font>

470
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:33,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold onto it.</font>

471
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:35,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, boss.</font>

472
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:43,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello.
- This is Jang Dong-s...</font>

473
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a surprise.</font>

474
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:51,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know
the Sintanjin murder case?</font>

475
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about it?</font>

476
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That bastard did it.</font>

477
00:38:56,958 --> 00:38:57,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

478
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:02,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know that?</font>

479
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We found his car in the area.</font>

480
00:39:10,917 --> 00:39:12,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been doing quite well
lately.</font>

481
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:16,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got all the way up here
by risking my life.</font>

482
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:20,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then some random guy comes along
and gets in my way.</font>

483
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:24,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What other choice do I have
other than cutting him down?</font>

484
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:26,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not like I can move aside
for him.</font>

485
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:29,825
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that psycho
disappeared without a trace</font>

486
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:32,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after walking all over
a gangster's reputation.</font>

487
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey,</font>

488
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:38,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whoever messes with me
has to pay the price.</font>

489
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:42,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reputation is everything
to a gangster.</font>

490
00:39:44,625 --> 00:39:49,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll chop him up
and put him on display.</font>

491
00:39:50,667 --> 00:39:54,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you telling a cop
you'll kill a man?</font>

492
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We punish people
in ways that the law can't.</font>

493
00:39:57,333 --> 00:40:00,291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you saying a bad guy
will catch another bad guy?</font>

494
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:01,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

495
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two bad guys will catch
a sicko that's even worse.</font>

496
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:12,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's his car key.</font>

497
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you not see me as a cop?</font>

498
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:24,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can arrest you right away,
you know.</font>

499
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:27,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You won't though. Why?</font>

500
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you want him
more than I do.</font>

501
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:43,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll provide manpower
and pay the expenses.</font>

502
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:45,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll share information</font>

503
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:48,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and help each other out.</font>

504
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:50,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the prize?</font>

505
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do we split him in half?</font>

506
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoever catches him first
can keep him.</font>

507
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:59,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So if I catch him first,
he'll be punished by the law,</font>

508
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but if you catch him,
you'll finish him off, right?</font>

509
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:05,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Join the game
if you're confident enough.</font>

510
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:17,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Count me in.</font>

511
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:20,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll regret this, you know.</font>

512
00:41:25,792 --> 00:41:26,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a handsome fellow.</font>

513
00:41:28,667 --> 00:41:29,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How old did he seem?</font>

514
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:32,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About mid-30s.</font>

515
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:35,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rain and darkness
obscured my vision, though.</font>

516
00:41:36,333 --> 00:41:38,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep in touch using this.</font>

517
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:45,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A gangster and cop join forces
to catch the devil.</font>

518
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:47,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is interesting!</font>

519
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A gangster and cop join forces
to catch the devil.</font>

520
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:04,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is interesting!</font>

521
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:06,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You motherfucker.</font>

522
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:08,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're in the same boat.</font>

523
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:09,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd be a fool
not to have insurance.</font>

524
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not like
we can draft a contract, right?</font>

525
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:20,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you went to all the trouble
to record me?</font>

526
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck!</font>

527
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:33,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you really think
you could have leverage over me?</font>

528
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:38,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is why I don't trust cops.</font>

529
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:49,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unbelievable.</font>

530
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:55,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just because I'm being lenient</font>

531
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">doesn't mean
you can walk all over me.</font>

532
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, you bastard.</font>

533
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:03,906
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When this is over,
I'll lock you up first, asshole!</font>

534
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:10,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He stabbed Jang Dong-su too</font>

535
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:12,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and is the culprit
behind the Sintanjin case.</font>

536
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what does this mean?</font>

537
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:19,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If things go as planned,
we can close 5 cases at once.</font>

538
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mid-30s, male, average height.</font>

539
00:43:24,125 --> 00:43:26,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Judging from his pattern,
he only kills at night.</font>

540
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:30,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He doesn't care whom he kills
and he only uses a knife.</font>

541
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:31,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's one or the other.</font>

542
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He has an obsession
or he's always prepared.</font>

543
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:37,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are no other clues so far.</font>

544
00:43:43,417 --> 00:43:44,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I made a deal with
Detective Jeong.</font>

545
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:46,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll catch him together.</font>

546
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:48,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Obviously,
we won't tell the others.</font>

547
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can we trust cops?</font>

548
00:43:49,667 --> 00:43:51,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can we trust gangsters?</font>

549
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:52,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who said anything about trust?</font>

550
00:43:53,417 --> 00:43:55,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need manpower
to catch the killer</font>

551
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:57,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and this isn't a case
we can handle ourselves.</font>

552
00:43:58,042 --> 00:44:00,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's get the others involved.
- Then what?</font>

553
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,661
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The major case squad
will take over,</font>

554
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">get the media involved,
and have all the glory.</font>

555
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:09,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not all.
The Chief is protecting Jang,</font>

556
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:11,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so this is the only way
to solve this case.</font>

557
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:14,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The chief will get into trouble
too.</font>

558
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:18,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jang has seen his face
and has his car.</font>

559
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:20,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can't only rely
on the drawing.</font>

560
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:23,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need fingerprints and DNA.</font>

561
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:26,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll help the gangsters
find the killer</font>

562
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:28,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and move in to make the arrest.</font>

563
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:32,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll use the cops
and throw them away afterward.</font>

564
00:44:43,167 --> 00:44:44,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're all
tax-paying citizen too.</font>

565
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:47,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get support
from the cops for once.</font>

566
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:56,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the outside, it looks like
an abandoned cold store,</font>

567
00:44:56,542 --> 00:44:59,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but thousands of slot machines
are built here</font>

568
00:44:59,292 --> 00:45:00,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and distributed
all over the country.</font>

569
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:02,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sons of bitches.</font>

570
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:10,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeez.</font>

571
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure there will be
something to find.</font>

572
00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:16,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably his hair, fingerprint,
or even traces of his fart.</font>

573
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:19,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have to find something
no matter what.</font>

574
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll comb every inch of it.</font>

575
00:45:21,167 --> 00:45:22,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let's begin.</font>

576
00:45:24,167 --> 00:45:26,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll leave all the grunt work
to Jang</font>

577
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:29,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and go through the cases
that have happened so far.</font>

578
00:45:30,167 --> 00:45:32,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the security footage
from the highway.</font>

579
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:34,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go over his pattern.</font>

580
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:37,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He used a vehicle
in all the murders so far.</font>

581
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:40,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's always on the move
which makes him harder to catch.</font>

582
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:44,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We know of 4 open cases,
but there has to be more.</font>

583
00:45:44,917 --> 00:45:47,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even when dealing
with any other cases,</font>

584
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:49,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">always consider the possibility
of serial killings.</font>

585
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:51,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you find anything,
report to me right away.</font>

586
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:53,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a ticking time bomb.</font>

587
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He could pop up anywhere,
so check cases in other areas.</font>

588
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:58,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also, make sure you're discreet.</font>

589
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:10,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll lock up the gangsters
once the case is over.</font>

590
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:11,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice, right?</font>

591
00:46:13,917 --> 00:46:16,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ultimately, it's up to us
to catch the killer.</font>

592
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before we do though,
let's take care of Sang-do.</font>

593
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a bitch!</font>

594
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you insane?</font>

595
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing here?</font>

596
00:47:27,917 --> 00:47:29,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell do you think?</font>

597
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:31,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was waiting for you.</font>

598
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:34,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you broke my back.</font>

599
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:36,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shouldn't have surprised me
like that.</font>

600
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:37,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I almost had a heart attack.</font>

601
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:39,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me some.</font>

602
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:47,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nice.
- Could you look into this?</font>

603
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:50,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's urgent.
- What is it?</font>

604
00:47:51,542 --> 00:47:54,864
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing special.
I found some hair and blood.</font>

605
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Please look into them.
- Jeong Tae-seok.</font>

606
00:47:59,292 --> 00:48:01,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong with you?
This isn't like you.</font>

607
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:03,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What isn't like me?</font>

608
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a filthy world.</font>

609
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ought to get
my hands dirty too.</font>

610
00:48:10,417 --> 00:48:11,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, it is filthy.</font>

611
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a weird one.</font>

612
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:32,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He left the weapon
for us to see.</font>

613
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:36,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Killer is still at large
but cops are clueless.</font>

614
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Incompetent cops."</font>

615
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:44,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now,
even a gang leader is dead.</font>

616
00:48:45,417 --> 00:48:47,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What will you do?</font>

617
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:49,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What should we do about this?</font>

618
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:52,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at you all.
Cat got your tongue?</font>

619
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:54,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Hur Sang-do case...</font>

620
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will be assigned to unit two
and they'll investigate it.</font>

621
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you still not get it?</font>

622
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop staring at the monitor</font>

623
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:04,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and hit the streets.</font>

624
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:06,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right now!</font>

625
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care if it's dog crap,</font>

626
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:13,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">search and investigate whatever
will help solve the case!</font>

627
00:49:13,792 --> 00:49:16,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least try to look
like you give a damn!</font>

628
00:49:16,792 --> 00:49:17,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold your heads high!</font>

629
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:19,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, tell me.</font>

630
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:21,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have a death wish?</font>

631
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is it?
- You said it's nothing special.</font>

632
00:49:24,417 --> 00:49:25,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just got the results
on the samples.</font>

633
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:29,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't believe this.
- What is it? Tell me.</font>

634
00:49:29,542 --> 00:49:32,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">DNA of the recent
South Chungcheong murder victims</font>

635
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:34,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">were detected in the samples.</font>

636
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:35,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

637
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that it?</font>

638
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:40,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was there any unidentified DNA?</font>

639
00:49:40,417 --> 00:49:42,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- None.
- That doesn't make sense.</font>

640
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:44,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you run the tests properly?</font>

641
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:47,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was no one else's
but that's not the issue.</font>

642
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Something big happened.
- Hold on a second.</font>

643
00:49:53,625 --> 00:49:54,625
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go ahead.</font>

644
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:58,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">DNA of the truck driver
and puppy mill owner</font>

645
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">were all found on the weapon
used in the Hur murder case.</font>

646
00:50:01,292 --> 00:50:02,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

647
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:03,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It means one person did it all.</font>

648
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will be officially classified
as a serial killer case.</font>

649
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:10,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got to go.</font>

650
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:14,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jang Dong-su!</font>

651
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was you, wasn't it?</font>

652
00:50:17,917 --> 00:50:18,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was you!</font>

653
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I'll have to call you back.</font>

654
00:50:22,792 --> 00:50:24,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Answer me, motherfucker!</font>

655
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you fucking nuts?
- Damn it!</font>

656
00:50:41,625 --> 00:50:42,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bastard!</font>

657
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your idiot's back.</font>

658
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:51,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He barges in here
like it's his house.</font>

659
00:50:53,042 --> 00:50:55,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who else?
One of your detectives.</font>

660
00:50:55,292 --> 00:50:56,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, we'll talk later.</font>

661
00:50:58,417 --> 00:50:59,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it.</font>

662
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A cop in league with a gangster?
Fuck this world.</font>

663
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:07,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't you a cop too?</font>

664
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:09,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't you?</font>

665
00:51:13,167 --> 00:51:14,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me, asshole.</font>

666
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you kill Hur Sang-do?</font>

667
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:21,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I killed him.</font>

668
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:31,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I blame myself
for trusting a gangster.</font>

669
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:34,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You trusted me?</font>

670
00:51:35,833 --> 00:51:37,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one would buy that.</font>

671
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:39,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing's changed.</font>

672
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:42,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll still catch
the killer together.</font>

673
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:43,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got it?</font>

674
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:48,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When...</font>

675
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:51,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is all over,</font>

676
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:56,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll investigate you properly.</font>

from the beginning,</font>

697
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:04,206

by one killer...</font>

He was my friend.</font>

by someone else</font>

if you wish to catch the guy.</font>

729
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:11,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If major case squad gets him
first, we are both fucked.</font>

730
00:57:14,375 --> 00:57:16,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this what you've been doing
your entire life?</font>

731
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:20,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I pity your sorry cop's life.</font>

732
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:23,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So don't commit any crimes,
you moron.</font>

733
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:26,290

you would be out of a job.</font>

735
00:57:27,667 --> 00:57:29,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some commit crimes
and some catch them.</font>

736
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:32,658
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, and some get stabbed.</font>

737
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:34,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The bastard
attacked me from behind.</font>

738
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still, I took his knife
and got a piece of him too.</font>

739
00:57:37,917 --> 00:57:39,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, hold it.</font>

740
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,866

- You stabbed him?</font>

741
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:42,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did. Why?</font>

742
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I found something.</font>

743
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:56,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell?</font>

744
00:57:58,625 --> 00:57:59,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sons of bitches.</font>

745
00:58:20,625 --> 00:58:21,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jang Dong-su, what's going on?</font>

746
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who are these guys?</font>

747
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Punks.</font>

748
00:59:17,667 --> 00:59:18,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move!</font>

749
00:59:34,083 --> 00:59:35,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get up.</font>

750
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:46,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to hell, you asshole!</font>

751
01:00:33,833 --> 01:00:35,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit...</font>

752
01:00:40,417 --> 01:00:43,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Motherfucker, no!</font>

753
01:00:43,917 --> 01:00:45,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck!</font>

754
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:47,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's enough.</font>

755
01:00:48,542 --> 01:00:49,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's over now.</font>

756
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should go.
I'll clean things up.</font>

757
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he's fine.</font>

758
01:00:55,083 --> 01:00:57,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He just bled a lot.</font>

759
01:00:58,042 --> 01:00:59,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just blood...</font>

760
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out of here, asshole!</font>

761
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now that there
is enough evidence</font>

762
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:20,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to arrest Hur's killer,</font>

763
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the police stated that capturing
the suspect is a matter of time.</font>

764
01:01:24,792 --> 01:01:27,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Due to the suspect's
limited method of killing</font>

765
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:30,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and small hunting ground,
the police are sure...</font>

766
01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:37,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, where are you?</font>

767
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:16,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you seriously napping when
something huge has happened?</font>

768
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:20,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. What's with his face?</font>

769
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:21,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wake up, you idiot!</font>

770
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:26,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have you been up to lately?</font>

771
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:28,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the...</font>

772
01:02:31,667 --> 01:02:32,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you going?</font>

773
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, take this.
It's a kidnapping case.</font>

774
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:38,415
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sun-ho's already there,
so get going.</font>

775
01:02:39,042 --> 01:02:41,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A kidnapping case?
How is that important right now?</font>

776
01:02:41,917 --> 01:02:43,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have
a serial killer to catch.</font>

777
01:02:43,917 --> 01:02:45,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's enough!</font>

778
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

779
01:02:51,625 --> 01:02:54,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't you see that
major case squad is here?</font>

780
01:02:55,458 --> 01:02:58,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're working with unit one,
so take care of this.</font>

781
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:06,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you from the start
that this was a serial murder.</font>

782
01:03:07,042 --> 01:03:09,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now major case squad
and unit one have taken over.</font>

783
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell
do they know anyway?</font>

784
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:14,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're clueless jerks!</font>

785
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:17,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shithead.
What did you just say?</font>

786
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:18,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up!</font>

787
01:03:22,042 --> 01:03:23,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tae-seok.</font>

788
01:03:23,917 --> 01:03:25,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You insisted
it was serial killing</font>

789
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:26,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without any evidence.</font>

790
01:03:26,917 --> 01:03:29,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was no evidence
or even a witness.</font>

791
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:30,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you were so confident,</font>

792
01:03:30,542 --> 01:03:31,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you should have caught him
already.</font>

793
01:03:35,667 --> 01:03:36,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it.</font>

794
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:47,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The victim was a prolific CEO.</font>

795
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:54,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tae-seok.</font>

796
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll find the killer if you
look into his acquaintances,</font>

797
01:03:58,542 --> 01:03:59,542
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so get on it.</font>

798
01:04:02,417 --> 01:04:05,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did something happen
while you were with Jang?</font>

799
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's with all the scars?</font>

800
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:09,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something happened, right?</font>

801
01:04:11,708 --> 01:04:13,699
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut the bullshit.</font>

802
01:04:15,792 --> 01:04:18,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ask his colleagues
about the women in his life.</font>

803
01:04:19,667 --> 01:04:21,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many times does this make?</font>

804
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:24,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you keep changing
the meeting spot?</font>

805
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:26,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is he even alive?</font>

806
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:29,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want the money,
put him on the phone!</font>

807
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:33,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the last time.</font>

808
01:04:33,417 --> 01:04:35,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be at Jeil snack bar
in Wolmyeong-dong.</font>

809
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:36,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come right now.</font>

810
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:47,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?
Go inside already.</font>

811
01:04:47,292 --> 01:04:49,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you come by
to drop off the bag?</font>

812
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:51,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- Please leave it with me.</font>

813
01:04:53,542 --> 01:04:56,375
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is she handing her the cash?</font>

814
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:01,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell.</font>

815
01:05:02,417 --> 01:05:06,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell the world you're here
with cops, why don't you?</font>

816
01:05:13,958 --> 01:05:16,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Who's that on the roof?</font>

817
01:05:17,125 --> 01:05:18,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's him. He's on the roof!</font>

818
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:20,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dong-cheol, he's headed north!</font>

819
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is he?</font>

820
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:25,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sun-ho, lure him
into the main street!</font>

821
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:26,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

822
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where the hell were you?
- Hey, he's moving away!</font>

823
01:05:30,042 --> 01:05:31,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sun-ho, cut him off!</font>

824
01:05:31,917 --> 01:05:32,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!</font>

825
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:37,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't see him!
- What? He's right there!</font>

826
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:40,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The main street!
- Sun-ho, where the hell are you?</font>

827
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:46,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop, you bastard!</font>

828
01:05:50,625 --> 01:05:51,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, he's bloody fast.</font>

829
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:56,410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop right there!</font>

830
01:05:59,792 --> 01:06:01,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll head down!
- Hurry!</font>

831
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:05,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't see him from here!</font>

832
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:08,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're dead meat.
- Where did he go?</font>

833
01:06:09,125 --> 01:06:10,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Catch up when you can.</font>

834
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:12,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up the stairs! Now!</font>

835
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:14,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freeze!</font>

836
01:06:18,042 --> 01:06:20,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He just turned the corner.
Block him from the front!</font>

837
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:21,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which way did he go?</font>

838
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:25,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over there. That way!</font>

839
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:41,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did you take the bag</font>

840
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:43,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you don't know
what's inside?</font>

841
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you shouting at me?
I didn't do anything wrong.</font>

842
01:06:47,417 --> 01:06:49,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone asked me to take it.</font>

843
01:06:50,292 --> 01:06:51,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who asked you?</font>

844
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:54,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell us
or we'll have you arrested.</font>

845
01:06:54,667 --> 01:06:56,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never seen him before.</font>

846
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:00,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He ate alone and asked me
to take the bag for him.</font>

847
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He gave me 20 dollars.</font>

848
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:12,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did he look like?</font>

849
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:15,495
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he looked quite average.</font>

850
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he only eat food here?</font>

851
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:21,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He drank a bottle of soju too!</font>

852
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's the bottle?</font>

853
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The labels differ
depending on the brand,</font>

854
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:31,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but they come in
the same bottle.</font>

855
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:34,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have fun searching.</font>

856
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:36,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got to be kidding me.</font>

857
01:07:41,292 --> 01:07:42,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dong-cheol!
- Yes?</font>

858
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:44,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just check the relevant brand.</font>

859
01:07:44,458 --> 01:07:46,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's not...
- Just the relevant brand!</font>

860
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:47,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is unbelievable!</font>

861
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:49,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the bottles are the same!</font>

862
01:07:52,875 --> 01:07:54,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no need
to work so hard, you know.</font>

863
01:07:55,125 --> 01:07:56,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you serious?</font>

864
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about
the steering wheel cover?</font>

865
01:08:02,542 --> 01:08:04,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The result will come out today
at the earliest.</font>

866
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:09,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I'll only charge
2 million won per machine.</font>

867
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:11,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

868
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:14,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll send the technicians
if you need them.</font>

869
01:08:14,167 --> 01:08:16,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't that too cheap, Mr. Jang?</font>

870
01:08:17,208 --> 01:08:19,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, your generosity</font>

871
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:22,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will make us very happy indeed.</font>

872
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:27,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know if I should take
the good deals he offers though.</font>

873
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:29,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look what happened to Sang-do.</font>

874
01:08:30,875 --> 01:08:32,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch out, everyone.</font>

875
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After Dong-su got stabbed,
Sang-do was killed,</font>

876
01:08:35,417 --> 01:08:38,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and his lackey disappeared too.</font>

877
01:08:39,042 --> 01:08:40,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just shut up and eat, will you?</font>

878
01:09:06,333 --> 01:09:07,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What brings you by?</font>

879
01:09:09,375 --> 01:09:10,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look for this guy first.</font>

880
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:14,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found an odd fingerprint.</font>

881
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:17,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know if it's damaged.</font>

882
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:20,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He could've put something on
his fingers on purpose.</font>

883
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:22,333
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found him with the partial
prints he left behind.</font>

884
01:09:22,583 --> 01:09:23,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's actually a missing person.</font>

885
01:09:24,417 --> 01:09:26,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His print was found
on the steering wheel cover too.</font>

886
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:31,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He hasn't come home
in about 3 months.</font>

887
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he say where he was going?</font>

888
01:09:32,417 --> 01:09:35,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When he's off on a job,
he'd be away for a month.</font>

889
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's away quite a while
this time though.</font>

890
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I reported it thinking
something had happened to him.</font>

891
01:09:40,667 --> 01:09:41,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he make any trouble?</font>

892
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:45,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not at all.
He never missed his rent</font>

893
01:09:45,667 --> 01:09:50,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and never drank any alcohol.
He's a faithful Christian too.</font>

894
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:52,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He lives a good, clean life.</font>

895
01:10:01,792 --> 01:10:04,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Basis of mankind
who raised a monster?</font>

896
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:07,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Night darker than death
sacred violence</font>

897
01:10:23,417 --> 01:10:24,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found an odd fingerprint.</font>

898
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:27,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know if it's damaged.</font>

899
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:29,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He could've put something on
his fingers on purpose.</font>

900
01:11:05,417 --> 01:11:07,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's 017-684-2784!</font>

901
01:11:07,542 --> 01:11:09,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do a background check
on that number.</font>

902
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:11,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also, the recording of
the kidnapper's voice.</font>

903
01:11:12,042 --> 01:11:14,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Send it to me right away.
Right now!</font>

904
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:20,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard you paid a ton
for Sang-do's funeral.</font>

905
01:11:21,042 --> 01:11:24,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't Dong-su one loyal guy?</font>

906
01:11:25,417 --> 01:11:27,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope you
show me the same courtesy.</font>

907
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:33,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't I tell you to just eat?</font>

908
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:35,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You talk too much.</font>

909
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:40,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you ruining
this nice lunch?</font>

910
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:43,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm looking out
for your fucking interests.</font>

911
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:47,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just eat your food!</font>

912
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:55,407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please continue.</font>

913
01:11:57,125 --> 01:11:59,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I sent you a photo,
so check it right away.</font>

914
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also, listen to this.</font>

915
01:12:03,458 --> 01:12:04,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the last time.</font>

916
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:07,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be at Jeil snack bar
in Wolmyeong-dong.</font>

917
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:08,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come right now.</font>

918
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:11,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

919
01:12:12,208 --> 01:12:13,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The road was slippery.</font>

920
01:12:14,875 --> 01:12:16,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I still hit your car.</font>

921
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:28,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Name, Kang Gyeong-ho. Age, 35.</font>

922
01:12:29,167 --> 01:12:32,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was abused by his father
and grew up in an orphanage.</font>

923
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:33,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He has no priors.</font>

924
01:12:33,583 --> 01:12:36,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He calls his 70-year-old mother
everyday</font>

925
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:37,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">although both use
unlicensed phones.</font>

926
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until August, his calls were</font>

927
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:41,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">mainly from
Chungcheong province,</font>

928
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:45,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but he's been calling from
all over the country since then.</font>

929
01:12:45,583 --> 01:12:49,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We traced his calls
and they were mainly from Ansan,</font>

930
01:12:50,167 --> 01:12:52,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">mostly from this district.</font>

931
01:12:52,542 --> 01:12:53,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Daegyeong-dong?
- That's right.</font>

932
01:12:54,042 --> 01:12:55,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are a few colleges,</font>

933
01:12:55,667 --> 01:12:57,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so tons of cheap rooms,
apartments,</font>

934
01:12:58,042 --> 01:13:01,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and thousands of old houses
are in the neighborhood.</font>

935
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a hassle.</font>

936
01:13:03,917 --> 01:13:05,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which means,</font>

937
01:13:06,167 --> 01:13:09,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he hid here after stabbing Jang.</font>

938
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You son of a bitch.
Where are your manners?</font>

939
01:13:12,208 --> 01:13:14,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jang? Don't address him
like he's your friend, asshole.</font>

940
01:13:14,292 --> 01:13:15,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You fucking gangster.</font>

941
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:19,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You cops are no different.</font>

942
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:22,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Motherfucker!</font>

943
01:13:23,167 --> 01:13:25,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Damn it!
- Let go of me!</font>

944
01:13:28,667 --> 01:13:29,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you want to die?</font>

945
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:34,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here.</font>

946
01:13:43,875 --> 01:13:44,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys.</font>

947
01:13:46,417 --> 01:13:47,748
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we don't catch him,</font>

948
01:13:48,667 --> 01:13:50,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we're all fucked,
don't you know that?</font>

949
01:13:54,333 --> 01:13:55,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're in the same boat now,</font>

950
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so let's see this through
no matter what.</font>

951
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:02,620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's just do it, all right?</font>

952
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:28,165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you all receive the photo?
- Yes, boss!</font>

953
01:14:28,667 --> 01:14:31,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As of this moment,
you have one single mission.</font>

954
01:14:32,792 --> 01:14:35,534
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find this fucker at all costs.</font>

955
01:14:35,625 --> 01:14:36,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, boss!
- Yes, boss!</font>

956
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:39,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep a low profile,</font>

957
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:42,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and if you see anyone
who resembles him,</font>

958
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:46,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">call your superiors at once.</font>

959
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:48,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There will be
5 of you in a team.</font>

960
01:14:49,333 --> 01:14:51,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The team leader will update us
every 8 hours,</font>

961
01:14:51,250 --> 01:14:52,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 times a day.</font>

962
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Centering on Daegyeong-dong,</font>

963
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:10,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">search your designated areas
and keep looking further.</font>

964
01:15:12,042 --> 01:15:15,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check cheap motels,
inns, and studio apartments.</font>

965
01:15:16,042 --> 01:15:17,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've never seen him before.</font>

966
01:15:17,917 --> 01:15:19,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then check short-term renters</font>

967
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:21,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as well as
long-term guests at inns.</font>

968
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:24,207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Search all these places
without fail.</font>

969
01:15:25,292 --> 01:15:26,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doan-dong.</font>

970
01:15:29,625 --> 01:15:31,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the afternoon,
check the downtown area,</font>

971
01:15:31,917 --> 01:15:35,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">markets, terminals
and other public areas.</font>

972
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:46,822
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At night, head to
bars, arcades, Internet cafes,</font>

973
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:48,578
<font face="Comic Sans MS">karaokes, and others.</font>

974
01:15:49,042 --> 01:15:50,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Got that?
- Yes, sir!</font>

975
01:15:58,667 --> 01:16:00,373
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check out Jungho-dong as well.</font>

976
01:16:01,458 --> 01:16:02,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That place closed down!</font>

977
01:16:06,292 --> 01:16:07,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it.</font>

978
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:10,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

979
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:16,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I'm outside, so hurry up.</font>

980
01:16:17,667 --> 01:16:18,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

981
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When is the bus coming?</font>

982
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, kid. Come over here.</font>

983
01:16:32,167 --> 01:16:33,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take this then.</font>

984
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:35,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm fine.
- Take it!</font>

985
01:16:36,417 --> 01:16:38,499
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Thank you.</font>

986
01:16:40,042 --> 01:16:41,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about you though?</font>

987
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:44,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Study hard.</font>

988
01:16:46,167 --> 01:16:47,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Jang Dong-su!</font>

989
01:16:47,375 --> 01:16:49,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't the time
to have a team dinner.</font>

990
01:16:49,875 --> 01:16:52,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't keep them working
on an empty stomach.</font>

991
01:16:52,917 --> 01:16:54,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">O-seong will be here soon.</font>

992
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:55,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't you bring an umbrella?</font>

993
01:16:57,625 --> 01:16:58,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There.</font>

994
01:17:00,792 --> 01:17:02,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't pretend to be a Saint.</font>

995
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:04,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You there!
- Yes?</font>

996
01:17:04,875 --> 01:17:08,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't receive items
from strangers like that.</font>

997
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:10,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a thug!</font>

998
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:12,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You seem more like one
if you ask me.</font>

999
01:17:12,792 --> 01:17:13,827
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1000
01:17:14,708 --> 01:17:15,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't laugh.</font>

1001
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bye!
- Be careful, all right?</font>

1002
01:17:19,917 --> 01:17:20,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, sir.</font>

1003
01:17:31,625 --> 01:17:35,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Our dicks may be many!
- But we have one heart!</font>

1004
01:17:35,375 --> 01:17:38,788
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Until the end of time!
- We are one!</font>

1005
01:17:39,083 --> 01:17:40,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you, boss!
- Thank you, boss!</font>

1006
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:50,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hearing that
just made my dick tingle.</font>

1007
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:51,327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a fucking life.</font>

1008
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:53,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe
I'm in league with you all.</font>

1009
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:56,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just get your job done.</font>

1010
01:17:57,333 --> 01:17:59,289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How is working for a salary
the same</font>

1011
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:01,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as risking one's neck every day?</font>

1012
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:06,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're still a fucking thug,
so you can have a drink.</font>

1013
01:18:07,958 --> 01:18:11,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just say thank you
when we give you good booze.</font>

1014
01:18:11,625 --> 01:18:14,241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bring in these liquor,
so drink freely.</font>

1015
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:17,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're involved
in every type of business.</font>

1016
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:19,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you want to join us?</font>

1017
01:18:21,292 --> 01:18:22,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should I?</font>

1018
01:18:23,542 --> 01:18:24,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should.</font>

1019
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:29,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look the part
and will go far in a gang.</font>

1020
01:18:29,583 --> 01:18:30,948
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut your face and have a drink.</font>

1021
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine, pour me one.</font>

1022
01:18:42,125 --> 01:18:44,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I wasn't turning away
to show respect or anything.</font>

1023
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:50,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit. My glass is so greasy.</font>

1024
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:53,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dal-ho! I feel shitty,
so sing me a song.</font>

1025
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:57,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Detective, did you know
that I was a boy band trainee?</font>

1026
01:18:58,292 --> 01:19:02,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll sing a kick-ass song
for you all.</font>

1027
01:19:03,083 --> 01:19:05,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today in Ansan,</font>

1028
01:19:05,125 --> 01:19:06,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there was a murder...</font>

1029
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, shut it. Turn that up.</font>

1030
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:13,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The high school victim
was on her way home</font>

1031
01:19:13,167 --> 01:19:14,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when she was murdered.</font>

1032
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:19,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Considering how young she is,</font>

1033
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the police are ruling out
revenge as a motive,</font>

1034
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:25,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and leaning towards
a sexual assault</font>

1035
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:26,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or a random attack</font>

1036
01:19:26,708 --> 01:19:28,664
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a potential motive...</font>

1037
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:29,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">O-seong.</font>

1038
01:19:30,167 --> 01:19:32,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get the hell up!
- Yes, boss!</font>

1039
01:19:32,125 --> 01:19:34,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Search every unit
along the bus 32 route.</font>

1040
01:19:34,875 --> 01:19:36,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did we miss?</font>

1041
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:38,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">North of Dohwa-dong,
Southwest of Wolpo-dong.</font>

1042
01:19:38,417 --> 01:19:39,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's 1 km from
the central square!</font>

1043
01:19:40,167 --> 01:19:41,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move it!</font>

1044
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's here somewhere,
so stay focused.</font>

1045
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come up from Daegyeong-dong.</font>

1046
01:19:45,042 --> 01:19:46,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll head down
from Songgeon-dong.</font>

1047
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:48,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm searching
the central square!</font>

1048
01:19:48,417 --> 01:19:50,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I found him,
it's the Dohwa Motel district.</font>

1049
01:19:50,417 --> 01:19:53,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gather the boys
and check the cars too.</font>

1050
01:19:53,208 --> 01:19:55,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Witness found
at the Dohwa Motel district.</font>

1051
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:57,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't just search the motels</font>

1052
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and look into bars
and karaokes too.</font>

1053
01:20:00,042 --> 01:20:01,907
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, I'm a cop.</font>

1054
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:05,828
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's staying in room 304.</font>

1055
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:17,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on?</font>

1056
01:20:17,583 --> 01:20:19,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me! Where is he?</font>

1057
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He left a minute ago.</font>

1058
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:23,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I found him.</font>

1059
01:20:23,167 --> 01:20:25,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep your eyes peeled.
We must get him first.</font>

1060
01:20:25,792 --> 01:20:28,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay in your car
and see if he comes back.</font>

1061
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:31,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't take any action
and let him walk back here.</font>

1062
01:20:31,542 --> 01:20:32,942
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't tell me what to do,
you prick.</font>

1063
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cancel the search party</font>

1064
01:20:36,833 --> 01:20:38,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and bring
just two more with you here.</font>

1065
01:21:34,083 --> 01:21:35,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay still.</font>

1066
01:22:04,917 --> 01:22:05,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get down.</font>

1067
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:27,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice to meet you again,
little fucker.</font>

1068
01:23:22,667 --> 01:23:23,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucking bastard.</font>

1069
01:23:26,875 --> 01:23:28,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He drives like a maniac.</font>

1070
01:23:37,667 --> 01:23:38,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1071
01:23:39,542 --> 01:23:40,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop the car, bastard!</font>

1072
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!</font>

1073
01:23:53,917 --> 01:23:54,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck.</font>

1074
01:23:58,250 --> 01:23:59,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop the car!</font>

1075
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:04,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out of the way!</font>

1076
01:24:17,417 --> 01:24:18,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn them!</font>

1077
01:24:53,917 --> 01:24:55,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You fucking asshole!</font>

1078
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:57,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that?</font>

1079
01:25:00,458 --> 01:25:02,164

<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's pretty obvious,
don't you think?</font>

1106
01:29:20,125 --> 01:29:22,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shouldn't have stabbed me,
you puny jerk.</font>

1120
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:20,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's this moment.</font>

1121
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:25,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When life and death
is in your hands.</font>

after killing all those people?</font>

not get your blood on me.</font>

for minor injuries,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">how these arcades
are funding gangsters</font>

isn't it?</font>

1166
01:34:11,333 --> 01:34:12,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1167
01:34:12,458 --> 01:34:15,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You convinced the world
that he's the killer,</font>

01:34:17,292 --> 01:34:19,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything we have on him
is circumstantial.</font>

1170
01:34:20,792 --> 01:34:22,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing directly ties him
to the murders.</font>

give him the death penalty.</font>

to murder all those people.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">What has been
your concept in life?</font>

1176
01:34:41,667 --> 01:34:44,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just can't figure you out.
Do you know why?</font>

1177
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:47,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's because you're not human.</font>

1178
01:34:48,167 --> 01:34:49,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then what's yours?</font>

1179
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:54,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A good cop? A model citizen?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">We live because we do.</font>

1183
01:35:08,208 --> 01:35:09,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wore gloves for my first kill,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I couldn't grip
anything properly with them on.</font>

1185
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:15,740

always be clean.</font>

1186
01:35:17,542 --> 01:35:19,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That feeling when it goes in?</font>

1187
01:35:19,958 --> 01:35:21,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can feel it
from the tips of your fingers.</font>

1188
01:35:23,208 --> 01:35:24,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess
it's something like that.</font>

1189
01:35:26,917 --> 01:35:28,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And these photos?</font>

1190
01:35:40,125 --> 01:35:41,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is it?</font>

1191
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The order's all wrong.</font>

1192
01:35:46,833 --> 01:35:49,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides, how can you say
that these are mine?</font>

1193
01:35:51,833 --> 01:35:55,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And even if I get
the death penalty,</font>

1194
01:35:56,875 --> 01:35:58,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you know I won't die.</font>

1200
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:15,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you sentence me to death
without proper evidence,</font>

1201
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:18,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then that's murder.</font>

1202
01:36:18,917 --> 01:36:23,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The real devils are those who
commit crimes with kind faces.</font>

1203
01:36:24,458 --> 01:36:27,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think about it as creators
and enforcers of the law.</font>

1204
01:36:27,167 --> 01:36:29,453
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you really have that right?</font>

1205
01:36:30,833 --> 01:36:32,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're innocent,</font>

1206
01:36:34,167 --> 01:36:36,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then I am too.</font>

1207
01:36:46,417 --> 01:36:48,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you state that
you've never seen this knife?</font>

1208
01:36:50,708 --> 01:36:51,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did.</font>

1209

<font face="Comic Sans MS">This knife was used
to kill 5 victims</font>

01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It cannot be concluded
that the knife belonged to him.</font>

1215
01:37:08,458 --> 01:37:09,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, you're right.</font>

1216
01:37:10,917 --> 01:37:13,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This knife has nothing to do
with the defendant...</font>

1217
01:37:13,875 --> 01:37:15,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least until now.</font>

1218
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:20,747
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your honor, we'd like
to request a sole survivor</font>

1219
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:26,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of Kang's vicious knife attack
as the state's next witness.</font>

1220
01:37:26,833 --> 01:37:29,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Witness, please take the stand.</font>

1221
01:37:55,667 --> 01:37:58,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've got balls showing
your face in front of me.</font>

1222
01:37:58,542 --> 01:38:00,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn, you look terrible.</font>

1223
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:08,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We pay tax so that you can
arrest and kill those fuckers.</font>

1224
01:38:08,583 --> 01:38:11,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how the law is.</font>

1225
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It arrests people
and punishes them,</font>

1226
01:38:14,625 --> 01:38:17,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it also fucking protects us.
That's what it's there for.</font>

1227
01:38:17,958 --> 01:38:20,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut the fuck up.
You should've let me kill him!</font>

1228
01:38:25,375 --> 01:38:28,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're my last resort.</font>

1229
01:38:28,875 --> 01:38:32,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's use the law
to kill the bastard.</font>

1230
01:38:34,667 --> 01:38:36,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop your bullshit.</font>

1231
01:38:44,458 --> 01:38:45,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turn yourself in.</font>

1232
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:48,412
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you out
of your fucking mind?</font>

1233
01:38:52,208 --> 01:38:54,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you kill Hur Sang-do?
- Yes, I did.</font>

1234
01:38:56,625 --> 01:38:59,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, I did.
- Bastard!</font>

1235
01:39:00,208 --> 01:39:03,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Once this goes public,
you and I are both screwed.</font>

1236
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't force me to use this.
All right?</font>

1237
01:39:08,333 --> 01:39:09,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Surrender and become a witness.</font>

1238
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:11,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the only witness.</font>

1239
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:13,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With you on the witness stand,</font>

1240
01:39:13,917 --> 01:39:15,703
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can link him
to all the murders!</font>

1241
01:39:16,917 --> 01:39:17,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd rather...</font>

1242
01:39:19,458 --> 01:39:20,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just get screwed together.</font>

1243
01:39:21,792 --> 01:39:25,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear that the evidence that
I shall give shall be the truth,</font>

1244
01:39:25,583 --> 01:39:28,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help me god.</font>

1245
01:39:33,083 --> 01:39:34,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your honor.</font>

1246
01:39:34,500 --> 01:39:36,741
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The prosecution's witness is
a wanted head of a gang</font>

1247
01:39:36,833 --> 01:39:38,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who is accused
of several serious crimes</font>

1248
01:39:38,583 --> 01:39:41,575
<font face="Comic Sans MS">including illegal gambling
as well as embezzlement.</font>

1249
01:39:41,667 --> 01:39:44,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing in the law states that</font>

1250
01:39:44,208 --> 01:39:46,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a criminal suspect
can't testify in another case.</font>

1251
01:39:47,292 --> 01:39:48,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I accept.</font>

1252
01:39:48,833 --> 01:39:49,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Witness,</font>

1253
01:39:50,208 --> 01:39:54,781
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how can you verify that you
were stabbed by the defendant?</font>

1254
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:05,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys like me
who get stabbed regularly</font>

1255
01:40:06,458 --> 01:40:09,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">don't forget our attackers
until the day we die.</font>

1256
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:13,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That bastard was the one.</font>

1257
01:40:14,625 --> 01:40:15,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here.</font>

1258
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:21,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had this sketch composited
right after I was stabbed.</font>

1259
01:40:25,125 --> 01:40:27,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your honor,
that is simply a drawing</font>

1260
01:40:27,167 --> 01:40:29,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one drew in
his or her free time.</font>

1261
01:40:29,958 --> 01:40:32,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It has no legal ground and
cannot be proved scientifically</font>

1262
01:40:32,042 --> 01:40:34,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and therefore cannot be
admitted as evidence.</font>

1263
01:40:34,208 --> 01:40:35,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your honor,</font>

1264
01:40:35,792 --> 01:40:39,535
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this is the witness'
medical record from the hospital</font>

1265
01:40:40,167 --> 01:40:42,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">stating his condition
immediately after the attack.</font>

1266
01:40:42,583 --> 01:40:44,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The witness is a gang leader.</font>

1267
01:40:44,375 --> 01:40:47,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Getting stabbed
is normal for him.</font>

1268
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:49,494
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can that be evidence</font>

1269
01:40:49,583 --> 01:40:51,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when he could've been
stabbed by someone else?</font>

1270
01:40:51,375 --> 01:40:53,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's violating
the defendant's rights</font>

1271
01:40:53,667 --> 01:40:55,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and is mocking this court!</font>

1272
01:40:55,375 --> 01:40:57,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn, that fucker talks a lot.</font>

1273
01:40:58,208 --> 01:40:59,493
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, Mr. Attorney.
- Witness!</font>

1274
01:41:00,208 --> 01:41:02,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you be able to say that</font>

1275
01:41:02,292 --> 01:41:03,702
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if your family
was killed by him?</font>

1276
01:41:04,292 --> 01:41:07,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The defendant's right?
Nutjobs don't deserve that.</font>

1277
01:41:08,042 --> 01:41:11,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That fucker
killed people for fun.</font>

1278
01:41:11,792 --> 01:41:15,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not decent myself,
but he doesn't deserve to live.</font>

1279
01:41:15,917 --> 01:41:16,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Evidence?</font>

1280
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll show you the evidence.</font>

1281
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:34,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That night, he forced me out
of my car by crashing into it.</font>

1282
01:41:34,917 --> 01:41:37,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then he stabbed me twice
in my side.</font>

1283
01:41:38,667 --> 01:41:41,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">During the struggle,
he stabbed me in the chest.</font>

1284
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:45,618
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I also cut my fingers trying
to grab his knife. See?</font>

1285
01:41:47,667 --> 01:41:50,124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I were the average man,
I'd be dead too.</font>

1286
01:41:51,875 --> 01:41:53,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should have him
take his clothes off too.</font>

1287
01:41:54,333 --> 01:41:57,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I stabbed his left chest,
so there will be a wound.</font>

1288
01:42:05,208 --> 01:42:08,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also check his hands.
You'll find a lot of scars.</font>

1289
01:42:08,583 --> 01:42:09,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stabbing is a tricky job,</font>

1290
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:11,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you cut yourself
here and there.</font>

1291
01:42:12,083 --> 01:42:13,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your nails get broken too.</font>

1292
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:16,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And lastly,</font>

1293
01:42:20,750 --> 01:42:22,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that fucker wrote this.</font>

1294
01:42:24,917 --> 01:42:26,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Analyze his handwriting,
and you'll get a match.</font>

1295
01:42:28,292 --> 01:42:30,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For reference,
Hur Sang-do was my friend.</font>

1296
01:42:30,625 --> 01:42:33,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hur was killed with my knife</font>

1297
01:42:34,292 --> 01:42:37,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hur and his lieutenant
are both dead.</font>

1298
01:42:37,375 --> 01:42:39,081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel bad for O-seong,</font>

1299
01:42:39,833 --> 01:42:41,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but if Kang spills everything,</font>

1300
01:42:41,917 --> 01:42:43,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we can blame O-seong for it.</font>

1301
01:42:45,875 --> 01:42:47,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hur was killed with my knife
by someone else</font>

1302
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:52,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hur was killed with my knife</font>

1303
01:42:52,917 --> 01:42:57,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">considering the defendant's
extremely violent tendencies,</font>

1304
01:42:58,292 --> 01:43:01,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wanton disregard for human life,</font>

1305
01:43:02,333 --> 01:43:04,369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the pain
suffered by the victims,</font>

1306
01:43:05,125 --> 01:43:11,121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">his sentence was decided
by weighing all the offenses.</font>

1307
01:43:11,875 --> 01:43:14,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ergo, defendant Kang Gyeong-ho</font>

1308
01:43:17,083 --> 01:43:18,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is sentenced to death.</font>

1309
01:43:24,875 --> 01:43:26,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">61st police appreciation day</font>

1310
01:43:27,792 --> 01:43:28,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">thank you, sir!</font>

1311
01:43:29,167 --> 01:43:30,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About-face!</font>

1312
01:43:32,083 --> 01:43:33,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Salute!</font>

1313
01:43:51,333 --> 01:43:54,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boss is coming! Let's greet him!</font>

1314
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:57,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good afternoon, boss!
- Good afternoon, boss!</font>

1315
01:44:57,750 --> 01:44:59,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Only on one condition.
- Which is what?</font>

1316
01:45:00,958 --> 01:45:03,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have me locked up
in the same prison.</font>

1317
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 men played the game
with their necks on the line.</font>
