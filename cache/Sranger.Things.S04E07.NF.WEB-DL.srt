1
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,571
Hey there.

2
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,783
- Quick! Hold it, Robin!
- I got it.

3
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,202
- Get it!
- Kill it! Kill it!

4
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,331
Shit!

5
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,627
Yeah! Come on!

6
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,504
Nancy!

7
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,381
Come on! Please!

8
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,383
Nancy, behind you! Watch out!

9
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,469
Oh my God, Nance!

10
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,221
Robin, get it off me!

11
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,556
Got it, got it, got it!

12
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,099
God damn it! Shit!

13
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,435
Let go!

14
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,270
Come here!

15
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,772
- No!
- Get it!

16
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,651
- Nancy!
- Go to hell!

17
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,990
Come on, come on, come on,
you son of a bitch!

18
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,868
I said come on! Let's go!

19
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,348
- Steve!
- Jesus Christ.

20
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,724
Jesus H. Christ!

21
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,393
Are you okay?

22
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,190
Well, they took about a pound of flesh.

23
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,734
But other than that,

24
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,528
yeah, never better.

25
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,865
Uh, do you guys think
these bats have, like, rabies?

26
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,701
- What?
- It's just that rabies are, like,

27
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,328
my number one greatest fear.

28
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,664
And I think we should
get you to a doctor soon

29
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,291
because once symptoms set in,
it's too late. You're already dead.

30
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,144
All right. There's not that many.

31
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:27,730
We can take 'em.

32
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,149
Right?

33
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,280
You were saying?

34
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,161
The woods. Come on.

35
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,955
Great.

36
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,165
More running.

37
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,801
How'd you sleep, Mr. Wallace?

38
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,387
Have you

39
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,806
reconsidered your position?

40
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,393
Where's the girl?

41
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,565
Perhaps you need more time to think.

42
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,237
Let's go.

43
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,656
No, wait, wait. Please. Wait!

44
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:47,745
Please.

45
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,336
Just don't kill her.

46
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,840
Promise me you won't kill her.

47
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:31,080
We're running out of time here, Martin.
Hawkins is running out of time.

48
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,708
I understand the stakes quite well.

49
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,836
Sometimes I wonder if you really do.

50
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,755
Or maybe you've just done all this

51
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,965
'cause you missed
your daddy-daughter time.

52
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,635
I've given you everything you asked for.

53
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,723
I've compromised my principles.
I've risked my life, my family's life.

54
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,851
All because you assured me
this would work,

55
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,478
that this was the only way.

56
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,147
But I don't see
any progress out there, Martin.

57
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:57,899
You know what I see?

58
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,777
I see a frightened,
traumatized little girl.

59
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,863
Good for us.

60
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,045
<i>The truth is,
you're regressing, Eleven.</i>

61
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,422
You're going backwards.

62
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,133
Eleven, look at me.

63
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,395
Look at me.

64
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,358
I know you're frightened.

65
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,736
You're terribly frightened
by what you've seen.

66
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:47,156
But it's this very fear
that's now holding you back.

67
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,244
If you want Nina to succeed,

68
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:56,541
you cannot hide from the truth,
no matter how frightening it may be.

69
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,420
I saw what I did.

70
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,049
I am a monster.

71
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,928
You speak of monsters,

72
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,346
superheroes.

73
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,517
That's the stuff of myth and fairy tales.

74
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,728
Reality, truth, is rarely so simple.

75
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,773
People are not so easily defined.

76
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:25,236
Only by facing all of ourselves,
the good and the bad,

77
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,447
can we become whole.

78
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,409
What if I don't wanna become whole?

79
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,036
Then that is a choice.

80
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,581
Your choice.

81
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,959
The door is always open.

82
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,211
This place

83
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,255
is not a prison.

84
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,259
This is.

85
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,348
You chose to trust me once.

86
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,727
I'm asking you to trust me again.

87
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,398
Journey with me into the past
one last time.

88
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,694
Stop hiding, Eleven.

89
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,832
What have you done?

90
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,023
How much time did you skip?

91
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,277
You wanted progress.

92
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,238
I'm giving it to you.

93
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,088
<i>What exactly
were you all doing at the lake?</i>

94
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,842
Uh…

95
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,636
- It's comp...
- We were… We were just going for a walk.

96
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,637
A walk?

97
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,681
At 9:00 p.m.?

98
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,849
To the lake.

99
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,101
We were gonna

100
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,437
take a little swim.

101
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,858
Little night swim.

102
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,860
Dusty.

103
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,987
Someone was just murdered there.

104
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,324
Yeah, we… we didn't realize that
until we got there.

105
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,658
That's why we didn't swim.

106
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,161
And Nancy,
was she with you at this night swim?

107
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,162
- No.
- Yes. Uh…

108
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,040
We're not sure.

109
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,708
She was there.

110
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,461
Then she left.

111
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,422
- It's all a little confusing.
- That's when you guys came.

112
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,924
Right. Then they dared me
to say what I said.

113
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:34,967
Oh, yeah.

114
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,552
About the killer.

115
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,095
You're lucky you didn't get shot.

116
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,473
Have you had any contact with Eddie?

117
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,851
That psycho… freak killer?

118
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,144
God, no.

119
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,897
- Nope. Absolutely not.
- No. We haven't heard from him.

120
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,315
- We barely know the guy.
- Who?

121
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,900
Oh, that's a bunch of bull.

122
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,486
- Erica!
- I mean, you realize they're lying.

123
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,945
The whole couch is on fire.

124
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,989
- Erica.
- Just the facts.

125
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,867
Are you lying to these policemen, Dusty?

126
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,578
- No.
- Lying to cops is a crime, son.

127
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,748
- I'm not lying.
- The fire is consuming us.

128
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,959
Threaten them with a little jail time.
Maybe that'll loosen their lips.

129
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,003
- Okay...
- You wanna send our kids to jail?

130
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,923
- We need to take this seriously.
- He didn't mean it like that.

131
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,221
- Shut up!
- Oh my God.

132
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,891
Shut up!

133
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,726
- Jesus.
- Shh.

134
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,105
We're gonna try a more civilized approach.

135
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,440
One at a time.

136
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,276
You first.

137
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,654
- Wait, what? Why me?
- Follow me.

138
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,406
I'm not even in Hellfire.

139
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,907
Do I need to cuff you?

140
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,284
Up.

141
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,286
Chop-chop.

142
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,329
Let's go.

143
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,118
Oh… okay.

144
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,288
- That was close.
- Yeah.

145
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,497
Too close.

146
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,001
Oh, sh… shit.

147
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,043
Steve?

148
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,254
- Jesus.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

149
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,673
No, no, no.
You're not. You're losing blood.

150
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,133
Come on, sit. All right?

151
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,469
All right.

152
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,264
Oh…

153
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,810
Okay.

154
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,814
So the good news is I'm pretty sure
wooziness is not a symptom of rabies.

155
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,609
But if you start having hallucinations
or muscle spasms

156
00:12:56,692 --> 00:13:00,154
or you start feeling aggressive,
like you wanna punch me, let me know.

157
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,572
- Robin.
- Yeah?

158
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,948
I kinda wanna punch you.

159
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,160
Sense of humor's still intact.
That's a good sign.

160
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,119
Yeah.

161
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,624
Okay.

162
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,042
Okay.

163
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,460
- You ready?
- Yeah.

164
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,711
Just do it.

165
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,548
Sorry.

166
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,466
It's okay.

167
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,970
Too tight?

168
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,806
- No, that's good.
- All right.

169
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,185
Okay.

170
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,446
Thanks.

171
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,031
Yeah.

172
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,298
So, uh,

173
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:06,762
this place is like Hawkins,
but with monsters and nasty shit?

174
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:07,847
Pretty much.

175
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,642
Wait, watch out for the vines.

176
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,935
It's all a hive mind.

177
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,353
It's all a what?

178
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,480
All the creepy crawlies around here.

179
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,232
They're, like, one or something.

180
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:21,527
Step on a vine, you're stepping on a bat,
you're stepping on Vecna.

181
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,070
Shit.

182
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,741
But everything from our world
is still here, right? Except people?

183
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,159
As far as I understand it, yeah.

184
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,996
So, theoretically,
we could go to the police station

185
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,540
and steal guns and grenades
and whatever we need

186
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,750
to blow up those bat things
that are guarding the gate.

187
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,920
I highly doubt
the Hawkins PD has grenades, Robin.

188
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,922
But guns, yeah, sure.

189
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,758
Well, we don't have to go
all the way downtown for guns.

190
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,553
I have guns in my bedroom.

191
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,513
You,

192
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,098
Nancy Wheeler,

193
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,516
have guns, plural,

194
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,310
in your bedroom?

195
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,895
Full of surprises, isn't she?

196
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,147
A Russian Makarov and a revolver.

197
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,190
Yeah, you almost shot me with that one.

198
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,443
You almost deserved it.

199
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,947
For your modesty, dude.

200
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,953
Oh my god!

201
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,229
So guns seem like
a pretty good idea to me.

202
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,189
Yeah, me too.

203
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,695
So what are we waiting for?

204
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,792
You know,

205
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,628
what we are to attempt is quite mad.

206
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,589
Even by your standards, American.

207
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,174
Yeah?

208
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,137
You got odds for us this time?

209
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,059
I think…

210
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,397
A thousand to one?

211
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,777
Even if we somehow kill this beast,
we still must escape.

212
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,404
We fail there,

213
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:13,490
I don't think they will be so kind
as to throw us back in a cell.

214
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,451
They will shoot us on sight.

215
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,911
We'd die as monster slayers.

216
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,663
You'll be a legend.

217
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,834
But still a traitor. You forgot traitor.

218
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,627
Monster slayer trumps traitor.

219
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,133
I bet Mikhail
will be proud of his pops, at least.

220
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,217
Mikhail?

221
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,385
- Mmm.
- No.

222
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,598
I can't do nothing right
with him anymore, it seems.

223
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,682
He will say,

224
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,644
"Papa, I bet that bald American
did most of the monster slaying."

225
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,397
He's that age, huh?

226
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,483
Yeah, he is that age.

227
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,903
It is same for you, American?

228
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,613
With your new daughter?

229
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:58,494
The last time I was with El, she wanted
just about nothing to do with me.

230
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,370
I was just in her way, really.

231
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,500
I think back to the way I was with my dad
at that age. I was the same way.

232
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,752
The exact same way.

233
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,134
I think it must be hardwired into us
to reject our fathers.

234
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,346
So we can grow and move on.

235
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,891
Become something of our own.

236
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,813
I hope that's what she's doing.

237
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,399
Coming into her own.

238
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,570
But still...

239
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,072
You worry.

240
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,742
To worry for our sons and daughters,

241
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,577
that is natural, isn't it?

242
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:41,995
Yeah.

243
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,083
But nothing about what El
has had to deal with is natural.

244
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,503
That beast,

245
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,339
that monster in there,

246
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:56,426
it's a part of something
that wants to hurt El. To kill her.

247
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,137
I don't understand.

248
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,556
To be honest, neither do I.

249
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,976
All I know is that thing…

250
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,645
That thing shouldn't be here.
It shouldn't be alive.

251
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,566
Because it is,
it means it still isn't over.

252
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,028
I thought I was put here

253
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,531
to pay for what I've done.

254
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,869
But I might've been put here
for some other reason.

255
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,495
Maybe I…

256
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,748
Maybe I can still help El.

257
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,793
Even if it's the last thing I do.

258
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,589
You almost sound religious, American.

259
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,799
Religious? I don't know about that.

260
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,721
But maybe I should
give that prayer thing a try.

261
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,100
'Cause if we wanna get out of here,
get back to El and Mikhail,

262
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,143
you and me…

263
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,189
We're gonna need a miracle.

264
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,971
Can I help you, comrade?

265
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,932
My name is Yuri Ismaylov.

266
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,523
Hello.

267
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,777
The warden is expecting me.

268
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,071
I have a very special delivery for him.

269
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,240
A rare import from America.

270
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,760
Okay, okay. I'm okay.

271
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,737
<i>Try your best not to blink.</i>

272
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,874
Any more headaches?

273
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,251
Nausea this morning?

274
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,797
How about your memory?

275
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,925
Can you remember what happened now?

276
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:31,683
Perhaps someone else
can help fill in the gaps.

277
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,144
Yes?

278
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,200
<i>Good morning, children.</i>

279
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,993
<i>Good morning, Papa.</i>

280
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:53,205
Today's lesson
is going to be about rules.

281
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,832
Ah, for some of you,

282
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,126
this may seem redundant.

283
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,797
For others,
it appears a refresher is required.

284
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,091
Eleven, please step forward.

285
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:12,099
Last night, your sister Eleven
suffered a concussion

286
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,559
during her alone time in the rainbow room.

287
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,854
Now, she claims to not have
a memory of what happened.

288
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,483
But injuries of this nature
don't simply happen.

289
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,860
Someone did this.

290
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,864
Someone in this room.

291
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:29,866
Now,

292
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,577
who's going to tell me what happened?

293
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,003
She must've… fallen.

294
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:45,841
Fallen?

295
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,885
You've seen her, Papa.

296
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,971
She's clumsy.

297
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:52,806
Stupid.

298
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,604
Eleven, you may step back.

299
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,024
Number Two, please step forward.

300
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,865
Collar him.

301
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,591
Thank you.

302
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:37,934
You think because
you demonstrate some talent

303
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,688
that you're somehow immune
to the rules, is that it?

304
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,024
No, Papa.

305
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:46,651
That the rules don't apply to you
in the same way

306
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,945
that they apply
to your brothers and sisters?

307
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,363
No, Papa.

308
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:52,949
Then why did you attack Eleven?

309
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,786
- Did she tell you that?
- Are you asking the questions or am I?

310
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,663
Did you attack Eleven?

311
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,500
If she told you that,
then… then she's lying.

312
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,714
Papa, please, you have to believe me.

313
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:08,840
Papa, please.

314
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,383
She's lying...

315
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,307
Now,

316
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,059
shall we try again?

317
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,774
What happened?

318
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,108
It was an accident.

319
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:49,422
Couldn't we have tried a road,
or something just slightly less creepy?

320
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:53,218
I think we're getting close.
We're almost out of here. Don't worry.

321
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,136
Eddie.

322
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,681
Eddie. Hey, man. Uh…

323
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,558
Listen, I just, uh…

324
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,143
I just want to say thanks.

325
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,647
For saving my ass back there.

326
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,941
Shit. You saved your own ass, man.

327
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,486
I mean, that was a real Ozzy move
you pulled back there.

328
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,572
Ozzy?

329
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:15,532
When you took a bite out of that bat.

330
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:17,784
Ozzy Osbourne?

331
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,579
Black Sabbath?

332
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,957
- He bit a bat's head off onstage.
- I don't...

333
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,542
- You know? Doesn't matter.
- No.

334
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,253
It's very metal, what you did.
That's all I'm saying.

335
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,505
Thanks.

336
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:36,052
Henderson told me you were a badass.
Insisted on the matter, in fact.

337
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,971
- Henderson said that?
- Oh yeah. Shit.

338
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,389
Kid worships you, dude.

339
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:44,144
Like, you have no idea.
It's kinda annoying, to be honest.

340
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:48,648
I don't even know why I care
what that little shrimp thinks,

341
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,860
but, uh, guess I got
a little jealous, Steve.

342
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:58,825
I guess I couldn't accept the fact
that Steve Harrington

343
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,201
was actually

344
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,495
a good dude.

345
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,374
Rich parents, popular, chicks love him.
Not a douche?

346
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,918
No way, man. No way. That, like,

347
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,671
flies in the face
of all the laws in the universe

348
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,799
and my own personal Munson doctrine.

349
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,096
Still super jealous as hell, by the way.

350
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,308
Which is why I would never have
jumped in that lake to save your ass.

351
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:27,771
Not under any, uh… normal circumstances.

352
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:33,943
Nope.

353
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,156
Outside of D&D, I am no hero.

354
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,286
I see danger and I just turn heel and run.

355
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,998
Or at least that's what
I've learned about myself this week.

356
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,750
- Give yourself a break, man.
- See?

357
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:52,921
The only reason I came in here
was 'cause those ladies

358
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,381
came in straight after you.

359
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,676
Now, I was too ashamed
to be the one who stayed behind.

360
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,803
But Wheeler right there,

361
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,554
she didn't waste a second.

362
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,891
Not one second.

363
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,976
She just dove right in.

364
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,981
Now, I don't know what happened
between you two,

365
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,358
but if I were you,

366
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,736
I would get her back.

367
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,946
'Cause that

368
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:22,701
was as unambiguous a sign of true love

369
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,705
as these cynical eyes have ever seen.

370
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,670
Goddamn it!

371
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,755
Here we go again.

372
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,427
Second on my list
of least favorite things, earthquakes.

373
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,512
Seriously, I'm unsteady enough as it is.

374
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,810
Nancy!

375
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,396
Where are you going?

376
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,605
Nancy!

377
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,033
Nancy!

378
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,417
Come on.

379
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,723
<i>Steve, do you copy?</i>

380
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,725
<i>Nancy? Robin?</i>

381
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,102
This is Dustin. Where are you?

382
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,856
We've been collared by the law.
I repeat, we've been collared by the law.

383
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,065
Do you copy?

384
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,195
Shit!

385
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:44,365
- Should we get lawyers?
- We're not ready for that.

386
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,367
As far as we know,
nobody did anything wrong.

387
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,037
But what if they did do something wrong?

388
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,998
- Anything?
- Nothing.

389
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,920
- You don't think they went through…
- Through Watergate?

390
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,339
Without us? Without a plan?
Without weapons?

391
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,216
They wouldn't be that stupid.

392
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,467
Yeah.

393
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,636
They must just be laying low
'cause the law got us.

394
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,887
"The law"?

395
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,806
What is this, <i>Gun smoke?</i>

396
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,098
<i>The Stupid and the Ugly?</i>

397
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,434
Should I round up the posse?

398
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,186
- Saddle the horses?
- Erica.

399
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,688
Please, just go away.

400
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:16,940
Here's the deal.

401
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,776
Either you tell me what's happening

402
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,654
or I tell Dustin
what I found under your bed.

403
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:25,990
Please, no.

404
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,159
Spill your guts, cowpuncher.

405
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,078
- What'd she find?
- Nothing.

406
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,454
Is it gross?

407
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,956
- Scale of one to ten.
- A hundred.

408
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,082
A hundred?

409
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,918
The serial killer is a dark wizard
from the Upside Down.

410
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,419
And we've been looking for him,

411
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,505
but he's in the Upside Down,
which we can't reach.

412
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,215
At least we thought we couldn't,

413
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,551
until we found a gate at Lover's Lake.

414
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:48,096
That was the reason why we were there,
but these stupid cops grabbed us.

415
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,974
And if you tell anyone about this,

416
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,059
that's including Mom

417
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,310
and Dad

418
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,854
and Tina…

419
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,235
…especially Tina,

420
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,278
I…

421
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,488
Will smother you

422
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,657
in your sleep.

423
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,160
Do you understand?

424
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,871
Hmm…

425
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,831
Erica?

426
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:18,668
Do

427
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,545
You

428
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,213
copy?

429
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,383
The smothering in my sleep part,
but not much else.

430
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,719
Why would they open up a gate
at Lover's Lake?

431
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,929
- What?
- The commies.

432
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,931
- The commies didn't.
- Then who did?

433
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,350
- Nobody.
- So it just opened up for fun?

434
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,895
Erica, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

435
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:41,649
No, she doesn't,
yet she raises an essential question.

436
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,610
How did Watergate open up?

437
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,029
Only two gates have opened,
so far as we know.

438
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,947
One by El, one by the commies.

439
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,408
But it's not the commies
or El this time, so it…

440
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,247
Holy shit.

441
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,333
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

442
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,168
"Wait, wait, wait," what?

443
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,212
There's one thing we've never understood.

444
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,466
Which is why Vecna's killing people.

445
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,176
What's his motive?

446
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,596
Killing teens?
It always just seemed too random.

447
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,306
Too prosaic.

448
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:17,685
On top of that, how does
the Mind Flayer figure into all this?

449
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,021
Maybe this is it.

450
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,023
This is the answer.

451
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,733
What is the answer?

452
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,360
You sure you just want water?

453
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,321
- We have Coke, Sprite, Dr. Pepper.
- Coke works. Thank you.

454
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,492
Okay, just hear me out.

455
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,744
How did El open the Mother gate?

456
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:37,038
She contacted the Demogorgon.

457
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,415
With psychic contact. Just like…

458
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,543
- Vecna when he casts his spells.
- Exactly.

459
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,629
So, what if, with each kill,

460
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,589
he's not simply killing them,

461
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,592
he's making a powerful
psychic connection with his victims?

462
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,177
A connection powerful enough

463
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,389
to rip a hole in the fabric
of time and space.

464
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,807
He's opening more gates.

465
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,891
Bingo.

466
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,560
Copy. We're still at the Wheeler house.

467
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,565
- Why would he be opening gates?
- To take over the world.

468
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,526
Who do we know
that wants to take over the world?

469
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,527
The Mind Flayer.

470
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,321
So if the Demogorgon
was just his foot soldier,

471
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,615
Vecna's his five-star general.

472
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:16,536
A five-star general
with the power to open gates.

473
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,038
- Holy shit.
- Holy shit.

474
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,541
Holy shit. That was incomprehensible.

475
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:25,003
You lost me at "Mother gate."
Please be kind. Rewind.

476
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,963
Okay, so remember the gate?

477
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,423
Oh, no. I blocked that out.

478
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,719
So what was that giant laser?

479
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,866
Might be time to get a maid, Wheeler.

480
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,661
Come on. I don't want to stay here
longer than we have to.

481
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,767
Those aren't guns.

482
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,060
These heels are pointy,

483
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,104
but I was hoping for a deadly projectile.

484
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,024
- I don't understand.
- Maybe you left them somewhere else.

485
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,610
There's a six-year-old in the house.
I know where I keep my guns.

486
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,821
And also, I threw these away years ago.

487
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,542
Jesus. How many did you make?

488
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,044
You said you wanted to help.

489
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,506
I get that grades are important,

490
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,466
but perhaps studying can wait
till we get out?

491
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,885
These are from sophomore chemistry.

492
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:01,349
And this… this wallpaper,
this is old wallpaper.

493
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,811
And this mirror, this went to a yard sale.

494
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,188
And you…

495
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,233
You're not supposed to be here.

496
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,985
No, I gave you to Cousin Joanna
two years ago.

497
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,414
What is it?

498
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,418
Nancy? You're freaking me out.

499
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:33,673
I think the reason
that my guns aren't here

500
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,510
is because they don't exist yet.

501
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:41,639
They don't… exist?

502
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,766
This diary should be full of entries.

503
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:44,684
It's not.

504
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:47,311
The last entry is November 6, 1983.

505
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,938
The day Will went missing.

506
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,982
The day the gate opened.

507
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:54,986
We're in the past.

508
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,739
Dustin! Dustin!

509
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,285
Dustin!

510
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,828
Can you hear me? Dustin!

511
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,414
Du... Hello? Hel… Hello?

512
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,375
- Maybe he really does have rabies.
- Hello! Hello?

513
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,418
What are you doing?

514
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,836
Hello!

515
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:15,715
He's here. Henderson.
That little shit, he's here. He's like…

516
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:18,092
He's in the walls or something.
Just listen.

517
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,427
Dustin.

518
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,596
Dustin! Dustin!

519
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,599
Dustin! Dustin! Can you hear me?

520
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,477
<i>That brings us
to the question you first raised.</i>

521
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,772
How and why
is there a gate at Lover's Lake?

522
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:33,608
Let's analyze.

523
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,527
What do Eleven and Vecna have in common?

524
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,196
Dustin!

525
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,909
- Dustin?
- Dustin!

526
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,913
All right, either this kid can't hear us
or he's being a total douche bag.

527
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,415
- Will found a way.
- What?

528
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:50,666
Will.

529
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,920
He found a way
to speak to Joyce through the lights.

530
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,129
- Lights?
- Yeah.

531
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,590
- The switch. Try the switch.
- Okay.

532
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,593
It's not working.

533
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,094
Guys?

534
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,389
You seeing this?

535
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,788
…to open a tear
in time and space,

536
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,122
just like the Mother gate.

537
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,418
Whoa.

538
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,425
<i>…are these like the Mother gate…</i>

539
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,346
But a gate nonetheless.

540
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,064
It…

541
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,733
Tickles.

542
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,820
It kinda feels good.

543
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,032
Does anyone know Morse code?

544
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:06,909
No.

545
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,787
Wait, does SOS count?

546
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,290
Is that…

547
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,625
Is that good?

548
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:19,380
So our working theory is that Vecna
makes remote contact from his attic.

549
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,425
We don't know why.
We assume he can do it from anywhere.

550
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,139
- Are you even listening to me?
- I'm listening.

551
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,223
It's just…

552
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,728
You said you followed Vecna
through lights, right?

553
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:35,813
Yeah, why?

554
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,357
Because I think he's here.

555
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,876
It's working.

556
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,132
"S."

557
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,468
"O."

558
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,262
"S."

559
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,349
Hey, uh,

560
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,769
remember when I said
they wouldn't be stupid enough

561
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,187
to go through Watergate?

562
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,647
Yeah?

563
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,360
I overestimated them.

564
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,330
Warden,
beautiful prison you got here.

565
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:38,376
How about this? Huh?

566
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,877
How about that? Huh?

567
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,878
Huh?

568
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,005
That's what I thought, yeah.

569
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,508
Warden.

570
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,093
So nice to meet you.

571
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:51,472
Uh, I'm Yuri, of course,
but allow me to introduce you to my very...

572
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,641
Shit.

573
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,684
- Murray!
- I'm sorry.

574
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,186
What?

575
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,772
Can you <i>please</i>
stop playing with that thing?

576
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:02,024
I am not playing. I am practicing.

577
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:05,403
Will you please stop trying
to talk to me and stay in character?

578
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,614
Remember, you are frightened,
scared, confused.

579
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:13,619
- Yes, I <i>am </i>frightened, scared, and...
- Okay. All right. Yes. Good.

580
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,540
Yuri Ismaylov.

581
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,253
At last, we meet.

582
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:23,754
Comrade Major.

583
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,341
This is the Bauman spy?

584
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,138
He looks different.

585
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,682
Uglier in person, I know.

586
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,101
He also shaved his beard
to disguise himself.

587
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,394
Tricky bastard.

588
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:42,189
Silence, American scum!
Enough from you. Enough!

589
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,903
Now this one…

590
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,573
This one I would recognize
a continent away.

591
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:54,285
She was more beautiful
in her uniform, but still,

592
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,870
quite striking, isn't she?

593
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:59,248
Yes, very pleasing to the eyes, comrade.

594
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,542
But not so pleasing to the ears,
I am afraid.

595
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,878
Where is he?

596
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,797
What have you done with Hopper,
you vile commie pig?

597
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,048
As I said,

598
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,301
unpleasant.

599
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:12,928
But, I must say,

600
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,431
I, too, am curious.

601
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,850
The other American.

602
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,435
What did you do with him?

603
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,313
I don't know why,
but I imagine him on a rack,

604
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,858
in the cold, stretched thin,

605
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,985
birds pecking his eyeballs.

606
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,862
Am I... close?

607
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,866
I have heard stories of Yuri Ismaylov,

608
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,286
the Peanut Butter Smuggler.

609
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:39,914
And you…

610
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,417
You are not the Yuri I have heard of.

611
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,463
I am…

612
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,006
I am not?

613
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,633
No.

614
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,594
No.

615
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:59,308
The Yuri I was told of had a screw loose.

616
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,227
And you…

617
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,146
Have many screws loose!

618
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,542
I hope we have not missed the show.

619
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,127
On the contrary, just in time.

620
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:43,519
This key here will give you access
to that weapons locker.

621
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,815
Choose any weapon you like.

622
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:55,656
Work together or alone.

623
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,616
What… what is happening?

624
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:00,411
They are being told the rules.

625
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:03,872
Rules for what?

626
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:05,749
I could tell you...

627
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,752
but that would spoil the fun,
now, wouldn't it?

628
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,842
You wait for the buzzer.

629
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,635
You <i>wait.</i>

630
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,889
You move before the buzzer...

631
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,350
you will be shot.

632
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,853
Is that understood?

633
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,524
Is that understood?

634
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,109
Yes.

635
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:41,410
I'd wish you luck

636
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,996
but it won't help you.

637
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,466
Let us hope your prayers
have been heard, American.

638
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,153
You open for something
a little more challenging?

639
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,967
Try not to show any emotion
as I speak, okay?

640
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,638
Just keep playing the game
if you understand.

641
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,023
Two is still in the infirmary recovering.

642
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,361
He's being watched now,
but once he is released,

643
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:42,030
he and the others
are going to attempt to kill you.

644
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:43,741
Right here,

645
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:45,784
in this room.

646
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:47,828
And Papa

647
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:49,455
will allow it to happen.

648
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,457
In fact, he wants it to happen.

649
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,376
He's been planning it for some time now.

650
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,504
Stay calm.

651
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,299
Focus on the game.

652
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:10,392
There's a reason why Two and the others
were able to escape their room last night.

653
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,729
Why the security cameras were turned off.

654
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,064
Why Papa punished Two today.

655
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:18,776
They don't even realize it,

656
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:22,112
but he is moving them
like pieces on this board here.

657
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,240
Driving them

658
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,826
to do exactly what he wants,

659
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,244
which is…

660
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,083
Why?

661
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,503
You frighten him.

662
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:41,131
He knows you are more powerful
than the others.

663
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,176
And he also knows he can't control you.

664
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,054
That's all he wants.

665
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:48,680
Control.

666
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,225
I saw all this happening.

667
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:54,353
That's why I wanted to help you,
but I only made things worse.

668
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,480
Helping me…

669
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,692
Made Papa hurt you.

670
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,242
And it is why you must escape.

671
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:10,869
Today.

672
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,497
But they are watching us.

673
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,249
Closely.

674
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,880
If you want to make it out of here alive,
you must do exactly as I say.

675
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,173
Do you understand?

676
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,225
Why do you still help?

677
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,769
Because I believe in you.

678
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:41,108
It is time you are free from this hell.

679
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:08,760
Hey!

680
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,307
- I'm sorry!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

681
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,143
For your understanding.

682
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,745
Come on. Come on.

683
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,419
- Okay, that's it. Go, go, go.
- Yeah, okay.

684
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,800
Okay, you guys seeing this?

685
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,844
<i>…seeing this?</i>

686
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,518
Holy shit!

687
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:06,151
We're not moving it,
but we're gonna unplug it. Stand by.

688
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,361
Yank it.

689
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,573
Okay, try it now.

690
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,325
<i>- Try it now.</i>
- Okay.

691
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,869
Um… Uh…

692
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,213
"H."

693
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:28,799
"Hi"!

694
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,342
- Hi!
- Hey! Hi.

695
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:31,385
That worked!

696
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,470
Yes! Yes!

697
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:34,846
Hi!

698
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,848
Okay. Um…

699
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:39,726
Um…

700
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:46,316
"S… T…"

701
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,693
"U…"

702
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:50,070
- "Stu…"
- Stupid? Stupid?

703
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,865
"…C… K."

704
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:54,950
- "Stuck."
- Stuck.

705
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,451
- Yes.
- We are.

706
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,662
- They're stuck in the Upside Down.
- Okay.

707
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:01,289
Uh, you can't get back through Watergate?

708
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,711
- What the hell's Watergate?
- 'Cause it's in water and it's a gate.

709
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,254
- Oh.
- That's cute.

710
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:10,132
- Right.
- Um, no. It's…

711
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,261
That a six?

712
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,595
- "G"?
- No, "G."

713
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,807
- Yeah.
- "U… A… R."

714
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,183
"Guar"?

715
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,560
Guar…

716
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,147
<i>Guar… Guar…</i>

717
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,274
- "Guard…"
- "Guarded."

718
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:30,444
- "Guarded"?
- Okay. Uh, Watergate's guarded.

719
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,446
Perfect. Yes. Yes. Yes.

720
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,198
We think we have a theory
that can help with that.

721
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,742
- Yes.
- Genius child.

722
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:39,077
We think Watergate isn't the only gate.

723
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,246
That there's a gate at every murder site.

724
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,497
<i>…murder site.</i>

725
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:45,667
Does anybody understand
what he's talking about?

726
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,044
- No.
- No idea.

727
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,174
Okay. Seriously?

728
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:56,261
How many times do I have to be
right on the money before you trust me?

729
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:58,847
Jesus Christ.
This kid's gotta get his ego in check.

730
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,307
It's his tone. Right?

731
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,516
- I know.
- Okay.

732
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,477
So… So how far is your trailer?

733
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,519
Seven miles.

734
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,146
Nancy?

735
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:10,984
Uh, I know your house here is, like,
weirdly, creepily frozen in time and shit,

736
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,028
but haven't you always had bikes?

737
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:24,915
So, anything?

738
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,085
Nope. She's sticking to her story.

739
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,462
They went to the lake for a night swim.

740
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,464
Nancy showed up at some point…

741
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,634
Come on!

742
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:39,262
…same thing she said
here on the couch.

743
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,139
Pretty much all she told us.

744
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:42,557
She stuck to her guns.

745
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,435
Honestly, shouldn't have
gone with her first.

746
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:46,436
She was, like,

747
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,230
kinda mean.

748
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,440
We'll find your daughter,
Mrs. Wheeler.

749
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:51,817
Don't worry.

750
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,861
One of these little brats is gonna squeal.
I just know it.

751
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,155
Where are they?

752
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,323
Upstairs.

753
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,200
Moping.

754
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,579
Oh little pigs.

755
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,707
Oh little pigs.

756
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:13,296
Let Officer Callahan in.

757
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,893
- Let's go.
- Careful.

758
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,311
Hey!

759
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,939
Excuse me! No, get back here!

760
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,649
Let's go! Let's go!

761
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:35,819
- I guess it's just a minor misdemeanor.
- Hey! No!

762
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:36,987
No!

763
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:43,243
- Lucas!
- Dusty!

764
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,494
Dusty!

765
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,330
Lucas, Erica!
Get back here!

766
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,790
Dusty!

767
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:27,180
That's your favorite, isn't it?

768
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:30,934
How are you feeling today?

769
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,519
Okay.

770
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,980
Are you up for
some more lessons?

771
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,152
Good.

772
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,055
I feel dizzy.

773
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:10,473
Dizzy?

774
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,517
Yes.

775
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,020
And the light.

776
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:17,856
The light is hurting my head.

777
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:40,253
Sorry to bother you.

778
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,464
- Everything all right?
- Not sure.

779
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:45,508
She says she's still dizzy.
Lights are hurting her.

780
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,218
Hurting who?

781
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,851
Quiet.

782
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:37,852
Follow me.

783
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:45,443
Now,

784
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,696
it's going to be a bit scary in here,

785
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:50,365
but this,

786
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,202
this will lead you out
beyond the lab fence to the woods.

787
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,915
But you're too big.

788
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,049
I'm not going with you, Eleven.

789
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,429
I meant what I said
when I called this place a prison.

790
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:15,723
And everyone here is a prisoner,
not just you.

791
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:20,311
Not just your brothers and sisters,
but the guards, too, the nurses.

792
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,148
Me.

793
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:27,986
Here.

794
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,032
Can you feel it?

795
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,828
Your papa calls it Soteria.

796
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,874
It weakens me. It tracks me.

797
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,251
Even if there were another way out,
he will find me.

798
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:45,503
And if he finds me, he will find you.

799
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,929
What if I make it go away?

800
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,186
You helped me.

801
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:02,812
I help you.

802
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:34,886
Stay calm.

803
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:36,721
Stay close.

804
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,224
Stick to the plan.

805
00:58:58,910 --> 00:58:59,953
American!

806
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,747
I enjoy this part...

807
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:06,626
When they still believe there is hope.

808
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:29,607
Whatever comes out of there...

809
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,568
hold your ground.

810
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:33,695
HOLD YOUR GROUND!

811
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:54,132
What is the American doing?

812
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:55,675
I don't know.

813
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:56,884
Find out!

814
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:28,291
You move so much as an inch,
I'll kill you.

815
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:29,334
What?

816
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:35,923
Oh, come on!

817
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,009
What is this?
Some kind of sick joke?

818
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:40,219
It's no joke. As I said…

819
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,722
…the Americans are very tricky.

820
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,433
Come on. Come on. Come on.

821
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:47,185
Tell me that's not out of fluid.

822
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:49,646
Come on! Come on!

823
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:51,939
If you wanna live,

824
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,692
then whatever sick, twisted game this is,

825
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,445
you're gonna stop it
and you're gonna free our friend.

826
01:00:57,528 --> 01:01:00,323
Then I'm afraid
you're going to have to kill me.

827
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,826
Because your friend is already dead.

828
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:04,952
Come on!

829
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:08,665
Come on! Oh, come on!

830
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:10,833
Come on!

831
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,575
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

832
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,495
STAY TOGETHER YOU FOOLS!

833
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:50,039
Order your men to shoot. To kill it!

834
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:53,459
If I give that order,
I will be shot tomorrow and die a traitor.

835
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,461
You want to kill me, do it!

836
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,844
Come on! Come on! Come on!

837
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,471
Ah! Ah!

838
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:13,271
Get back! Get back!

839
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,525
Get the hell back!

840
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,362
Get back! Get back!

841
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:32,206
I'll kill him! I'll KILL HIM!

842
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,751
TOSS YOUR GUN! OVER TO ME!

843
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,797
You, open all the doors below.

844
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:40,715
You understand?

845
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:42,425
OPEN THE DOORS.

846
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:44,594
You open all the doors,

847
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:46,804
that monster will get loose in this prison

848
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,931
and we are all dead.

849
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:51,934
I will pull this trigger! OPEN THE DOORS!

850
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:09,494
They would need a battering ram
to open that door.

851
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,498
Let the monster feed.

852
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,383
You think I'm playing?

853
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,719
You think I won't do it?

854
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,971
OPEN THE DOOR!

855
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,391
If I open those doors,

856
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,645
I condemn not just myself,

857
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:38,064
but all of my comrades to death.

858
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:41,275
In good conscience, I cannot.

859
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,486
I will not.

860
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:48,866
I gotta hand it
to you commies. You're committed.

861
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:11,973
Stay back!

862
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:14,267
Back! Back! Get back!

863
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,353
Get away!

864
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:23,901
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

865
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,737
- What are you doing?
- No idea. There's a lot of buttons.

866
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:29,198
I can't see.
I need my glasses. Gimme a second.

867
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:30,825
Come here. No.

868
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,285
Give me. Mine!

869
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,836
Running out of time here!

870
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,171
I'm trying!

871
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:52,054
No, no, no. Joyce, we have no idea
what these buttons do.

872
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:53,723
You can't just press away like that.

873
01:04:58,269 --> 01:04:59,478
Get back!

874
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,063
Back! Get back!

875
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,317
Joyce, just relax.

876
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,318
Come on!

877
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:09,322
American!

878
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:15,411
That did it! That did it!

879
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:21,542
Close it, Joyce.

880
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:23,127
Close it!

881
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:13,010
For a second,
I thought we had your miracle.

882
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,891
But out of one prison into another.

883
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:04,288
Right here.

884
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:15,216
That's gotta be a Guinness World Record.
Most miles traveled interdimensionally.

885
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:19,303
- Just inhaled a bunch of that crap.
- It's stuck in my throat.

886
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:29,063
Goddamn.

887
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,526
This is where Chrissy died.

888
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:36,654
Like, right where she died.

889
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:40,157
I think there's something in there.

890
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,330
What the hell is that?

891
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:22,741
No way.

892
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:33,502
Hi there.

893
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:35,087
- Hi.
- Hi.

894
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,468
Holy shit, this is trippy.

895
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:44,680
Bada-bada-boom!

896
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:58,777
Remember, you can't hurt me
more than they already have.

897
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,068
Huh.

898
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:54,792
{\an8}Who knew something so small
could cause so much trouble?

899
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:58,796
Thank you.

900
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,218
There they are!

901
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:05,678
- Stop!
- Run.

902
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:06,595
Freeze!

903
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:09,265
Stop!

904
01:11:12,309 --> 01:11:14,353
Lock it down! Lock it down!

905
01:11:16,313 --> 01:11:17,147
Hey!

906
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:20,067
Where do you think you're going?

907
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:28,367
Against the wall.

908
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,411
Both of you. Now.

909
01:11:33,497 --> 01:11:34,415
No.

910
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:37,459
You don't have to be
afraid of them, Eleven.

911
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:39,920
Not anymore.

912
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:45,301
Take 'em.

913
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:12,077
Come.

914
01:12:15,914 --> 01:12:17,416
Wait here. Don't move.

915
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:19,835
- I'm going to find us a way out.
- Wait.

916
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:21,795
How did you...

917
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:22,755
Like I said,

918
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:25,090
we're alike,

919
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:27,343
you and I.

920
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:07,007
Those stains are, uh…

921
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,554
- I dunno what those stains are.
- Mmm.

922
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,478
Not quite sure how these physics work.

923
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,063
But, uh…

924
01:13:23,023 --> 01:13:23,941
Here goes nothing.

925
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:30,823
There we go.

926
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:35,119
And if my theory is correct…

927
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:39,915
- Huh. Abracadabra.
- Holy shit.

928
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:43,377
All right, pull on it! See if it holds!

929
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:54,263
This is the craziest shit
I've ever seen in my life.

930
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:56,348
And I've seen some crazy shit.

931
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:00,811
Guess I'm the guinea pig.

932
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:06,608
Let's clear the landing pad.

933
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:16,076
Oh my God!

934
01:14:18,996 --> 01:14:20,164
Oh, thank God.

935
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:21,331
That was fun.

936
01:14:26,753 --> 01:14:28,088
All right, guess I'll go.

937
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:29,047
All right.

938
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:34,553
Easy, easy.

939
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:39,641
That

940
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:41,185
<i>was </i>fun.

941
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:42,686
Shit.

942
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,315
See you on the other side.

943
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:48,692
On the other side.

944
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:55,699
Nice.

945
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:30,901
Nancy.

946
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:32,778
Hey! Hey!

947
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:35,572
Stay with me. Nancy! Hey!

948
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,366
Nancy, wake up.

949
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:39,076
- Wake up! Nancy!
- Vecna.

950
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:10,524
<i>Do you remember
what you did, Nancy?</i>

951
01:16:13,944 --> 01:16:16,488
<i>Or have you already forgotten?</i>

952
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:21,034
<i>When I kill someone…</i>

953
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:25,872
<i>…I never forget.</i>

954
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,125
Nancy!

955
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:16,293
I asked you to wait.

956
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:43,695
Why do you cry for them, Eleven?

957
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:48,533
After everything they did to you?

958
01:19:49,534 --> 01:19:50,535
Hmm?

959
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,872
You think you need them, but you don't.

960
01:19:55,582 --> 01:19:56,625
You don't.

961
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:01,004
Oh, but I know you're just scared.

962
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:05,759
I was scared once too.

963
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:12,015
I know

964
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:13,809
what it's like

965
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,229
to be different.

966
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:20,357
To be alone

967
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:22,275
in this world.

968
01:20:56,434 --> 01:20:59,604
<i>I see
you've been looking for me, Nancy.</i>

969
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:02,357
<i>You were so close.</i>

970
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:05,110
<i>So close to the truth.</i>

971
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:09,614
<i>How was old, blind, dumb Victor?</i>

972
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:10,991
<i>Did he miss me?</i>

973
01:21:12,325 --> 01:21:15,245
<i>I've been meaning to check back in,</i>

974
01:21:15,328 --> 01:21:17,163
<i>but I've been busy.</i>

975
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,462
<i>So very busy.</i>

976
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:39,269
- What'd I tell ya?
- Wow.

977
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:42,105
This is amazing.

978
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:44,482
It looks like a fairy tale.

979
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:46,109
A dream.

980
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:49,905
- Alice, no running.
- It's so big!

981
01:21:51,948 --> 01:21:52,866
This is nice.

982
01:21:53,366 --> 01:21:54,200
Yeah.

983
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,162
- Yeah.
<i>- Like you,</i>

984
01:21:57,829 --> 01:21:59,956
<i>I didn't fit in with the other children.</i>

985
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:02,500
<i>Something was wrong with me.</i>

986
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:05,295
<i>All the teachers
and the doctors said I was…</i>

987
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:07,130
"Broken,"

988
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:08,924
they said.

989
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:14,137
My parents

990
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:18,850
thought a change of scenery,
a fresh start in Hawkins,

991
01:22:19,559 --> 01:22:21,061
might just cure me.

992
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:24,397
It was absurd.

993
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:29,653
As if the world
would be any different here.

994
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:40,538
<i>But then…</i>

995
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:45,752
<i>To my surprise, our new home provided</i>

996
01:22:45,835 --> 01:22:46,962
<i>a discovery.</i>

997
01:22:49,172 --> 01:22:51,424
<i>And a new found sense of purpose.</i>

998
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:55,720
<i>I found a nest of black widows
living inside a vent.</i>

999
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:59,516
<i>Most people fear spiders.</i>

1000
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:01,935
<i>They detest them.</i>

1001
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:04,688
<i>And yet,</i>

1002
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:08,108
<i>I found them endlessly fascinating.</i>

1003
01:23:09,109 --> 01:23:10,068
<i>More than that,</i>

1004
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:13,238
<i>I found a great comfort in them.</i>

1005
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:15,991
<i>A kinship.</i>

1006
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:19,202
<i>Like me,</i>

1007
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:22,163
they are solitary creatures.

1008
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:25,375
And deeply misunderstood.

1009
01:23:26,793 --> 01:23:27,752
They

1010
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:30,588
<i>are gods of our world.</i>

1011
01:23:31,589 --> 01:23:33,758
<i>The most important of all predators.</i>

1012
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:36,970
<i>They immobilize and feed on the weak,</i>

1013
01:23:37,053 --> 01:23:40,598
<i>bringing balance and order
to an unstable ecosystem.</i>

1014
01:23:43,935 --> 01:23:46,855
But the human world
was disrupting this harmony.

1015
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:48,732
You see,

1016
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:50,525
humans

1017
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,695
are a unique type of pest,

1018
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:54,863
multiplying

1019
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,073
and poisoning our world,

1020
01:23:57,157 --> 01:23:59,909
all while enforcing
a structure of their own.

1021
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:03,705
A deeply unnatural structure.

1022
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:07,751
<i>Where others saw order,
I saw a straitjacket.</i>

1023
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,297
<i>A cruel, oppressive world</i>

1024
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:15,008
<i>dictated by made-up rules.</i>

1025
01:24:15,091 --> 01:24:17,052
<i>Seconds, minutes,</i>

1026
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:20,013
hours, days, weeks, months,

1027
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:22,140
years, decades.

1028
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:26,394
Each life a faded, lesser copy
of the one before.

1029
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:29,439
Wake up, eat, work, sleep,

1030
01:24:29,522 --> 01:24:31,733
reproduce, and die.

1031
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:34,903
Everyone

1032
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:37,280
is just

1033
01:24:37,864 --> 01:24:38,823
waiting.

1034
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:40,950
Waiting

1035
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:44,245
for it all to be over.

1036
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:49,667
All while performing
in a silly, terrible play,

1037
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:51,961
day after day.

1038
01:24:53,296 --> 01:24:54,339
<i>I could not do that.</i>

1039
01:24:55,965 --> 01:24:58,802
<i>I could not close off my mind</i>

1040
01:24:58,885 --> 01:25:00,386
<i>and join in the madness.</i>

1041
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:02,472
I could not pretend.

1042
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:05,975
And I realized

1043
01:25:07,602 --> 01:25:08,770
I didn't have to.

1044
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:21,324
I could make my own rules.

1045
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:25,995
I could restore balance to a broken world.

1046
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:27,413
A predator…

1047
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:30,625
But for good.

1048
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:40,510
As I practiced, I realized

1049
01:25:40,593 --> 01:25:43,263
I could do more than I possibly imagined.

1050
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:47,142
<i>I could reach into others,</i>

1051
01:25:47,767 --> 01:25:49,352
<i>into their minds,</i>

1052
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:51,729
<i>their memories.</i>

1053
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:57,193
I became an explorer.

1054
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:01,489
I saw my parents as they truly were.

1055
01:26:03,032 --> 01:26:03,950
To the world,

1056
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:09,956
they presented themselves
as good, normal people.

1057
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:12,292
But like everything else in this world,

1058
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:13,793
it was all a lie.

1059
01:26:14,919 --> 01:26:16,254
A terrible lie.

1060
01:26:18,089 --> 01:26:20,967
They had done things, Eleven.

1061
01:26:21,968 --> 01:26:23,386
Such awful things.

1062
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:33,730
<i>I showed them who they really were.</i>

1063
01:26:35,106 --> 01:26:36,441
<i>I held up a mirror.</i>

1064
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:39,944
<i>My naive father believed</i>

1065
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:43,448
<i>it was a demon
cursing them for their sins.</i>

1066
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:46,284
<i>But my mother somehow knew.</i>

1067
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:50,205
<i>Knew it was I
who was holding up that mirror,</i>

1068
01:26:51,414 --> 01:26:55,460
<i>and she despised me for it.</i>

1069
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:58,796
<i>She called a doctor, an expert.</i>

1070
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,925
<i>She wanted him to lock me away, to fix me,</i>

1071
01:27:02,008 --> 01:27:06,012
<i>even though it wasn't I who was broken.
It was them.</i>

1072
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,640
<i>And so she left me with no choice.</i>

1073
01:27:09,265 --> 01:27:10,600
<i>No choice but to act.</i>

1074
01:27:11,517 --> 01:27:12,560
<i>To break free.</i>

1075
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:26,074
<i>With each life I took, I grew stronger.</i>

1076
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:29,035
<i>More powerful.</i>

1077
01:27:30,119 --> 01:27:31,955
<i>They were becoming a part of me.</i>

1078
01:27:32,789 --> 01:27:34,207
<i>But I was still a child.</i>

1079
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:37,710
<i>And I did not yet know my limits.</i>

1080
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,672
<i>And it nearly killed me.</i>

1081
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,645
<i>He was arrested, blamed for the death
of my sister and mother,</i>

1082
01:27:55,728 --> 01:27:57,272
<i>just as I had planned.</i>

1083
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:00,149
But I was far from free.

1084
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:05,697
<i>I woke up from my coma only to find myself
placed in the care of a doctor,</i>

1085
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:07,824
<i>the very doctor I had hoped to escape.</i>

1086
01:28:08,324 --> 01:28:10,535
<i>Dr. Martin Brenner.</i>

1087
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:13,204
<i>Papa.</i>

1088
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,373
But the truth…

1089
01:28:16,749 --> 01:28:20,128
The truth is he did not
just want to study me.

1090
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:23,256
He wanted more.

1091
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:25,967
He wanted to control.

1092
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:31,347
<i>When Papa finally realized
he could not control me,</i>

1093
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:34,100
<i>he tried to recreate me.</i>

1094
01:28:36,519 --> 01:28:38,062
<i>He began a program.</i>

1095
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:40,064
<i>And soon,</i>

1096
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:42,942
<i>others were born.</i>

1097
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:45,611
You were born.

1098
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:50,533
And I am so glad you were, Eleven.

1099
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:54,329
So very glad.

1100
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:03,629
They're not gone, Eleven.

1101
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:07,550
They're still with me.

1102
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:11,429
In here.

1103
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:15,183
You tricked me.

1104
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:17,727
Tricked you?

1105
01:29:18,936 --> 01:29:20,396
No, I saved you.

1106
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,775
You are a prisoner here,

1107
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:25,818
just like me.

1108
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:30,448
To your papa, you are nothing more
than an animal, a monster,

1109
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:32,283
a lab rat to be tamed.

1110
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,035
But the truth, Eleven,

1111
01:29:35,578 --> 01:29:37,705
the truth is just the opposite.

1112
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:42,126
You are better than they are.

1113
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:46,839
Superior.

1114
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:51,636
That is why you frighten him.

1115
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:55,681
If you come with me,

1116
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:59,185
for the first time in your life,
you will be free.

1117
01:30:01,979 --> 01:30:04,065
Imagine what we could do together.

1118
01:30:05,274 --> 01:30:08,152
We could reshape the world,

1119
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,905
remake it however we see fit.

1120
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:13,741
Join me.

1121
01:30:18,287 --> 01:30:19,122
No.

1122
01:31:19,223 --> 01:31:22,018
He had found his strength
in a memory from his past.

1123
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:24,061
<i>Something that made him sad.</i>

1124
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:26,772
<i>But also angry.</i>

1125
01:31:30,109 --> 01:31:31,861
Do you have a memory like that?

1126
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:36,491
No! No! Jane!

1127
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:55,259
No! No!

1128
01:32:12,985 --> 01:32:14,862
It wasn't supposed to end like this.

1129
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:51,399
Jane.

1130
01:32:53,651 --> 01:32:54,694
I love you.

1131
01:33:15,172 --> 01:33:16,215
<i>Jane.</i>

1132
01:33:28,477 --> 01:33:29,437
It's happening.
